Peter whined trying to tug his father’s shirt over his head and hide.  It was naptime and naps were the worst.
“We can’t apply a figure to this unfortunately. There is no one else like Captain Rogers, but if I had to equate it to other high-risk pregnancies involving hormonal imbalances and underdeveloped internal reproductive systems. We are looking at a window of around 13 to 18 weeks to watch very closely for any signs of fetal distress. Given what we know between now and then, 50%. Odds will go up in favor of survival past that mark. I wish I had better news for you both, I truly do.” She sounded so apologetic.
Having finished the less than delicious but extremely nutritious prenatal shake, Steve was raiding the penthouse kitchen for something a bit more substantial. He didn’t much feel like cooking and to be honest he only knew how to make a handful of things. Food didn’t have much variety growing up. So short of  potato soup, stews, and other basics …Steve was no culinary genius.
The polished leather clad man regarded him a moment before returning his relentless focus out of the large floor to ceiling windows. “You say that, and I would like to believe that. Just know that if you're severely compromised, I will forcibly take the situation in hand to defend this country.”
The bathroom door opened and Tony was faced with his omega now griping the sink hard enough that the marble had cracked across the vanity. Steve’s face was twisted up and his shoulders hunched over as he took several harsh breaths.
All Barnes could do was hold on tighter and kiss away the tears. “ We'll figure it out baby, the Doc can help. I need you to take a breath for me baby. Just breath.” It worried him how frail Loki seemed, how he was shaking apart in his arms. “Let me carry it all baby, you've held on to this for to long.”
Steve lay back on the exam table with Tony next to him, the engineer looking over at all the tech probably adjusting all of the pieces in his head. Knowing Stark he would have a brand new sonography machine built that was lighter more compact and provided superior imaging, all before breakfast tomorrow. The trouble would likely be that parts alone cost a small fortune. Tony always had good intentions though and that great inventive mind was something Steve truly loved about him.
Tony immediately caved; He’d never seen Peter so needy and upset. It didn’t take a genius to see the budding abandonment issues the child was already suffering and that broke Tony. Because Stark knew what that was, like to miss your father and need him there only to be left behind. “I’m sorry too baby.” He said wrapping his arms around the little boy. “I’m sorry too.”
The gentle voice coaxed Steve out of his slumber. He had forgotten what day it was, but of course his Daddy remembered.
"Loki. You have a second chance, if you keep looking back you're wasting it. Trust me kid, I know all about second chances."
The heavy hand falling on the back of his neck and shoving him into the tiny cleaning supply area hadn’t been a surprise but a gift. Soon a familiar mass of muscle was pressed to the inventors back.  “Morning sunshine.” he chuckled looking over his shoulder.
The next week was so calm it was almost weird; everyone in the tower started to notice the little domestic behavior going on between the lead pair. It created an air of peace and prosperity that none of them had felt in a very long time. The Tower was beginning to feel like a home, the way it only can when there is that familial stability. Some may scoff at the confines of biology - but it worked, having a head alpha and omega made for a stronger pack.
He remembered those times in flashes and painful dreams, he remember a lot that he wished he could forget. Lady Eir had said it was the only way to defeat the darkness in his head.
“Easy, the rest of the team… Sure I kinda wanna hit Barton but he’s not bad, Nat’s a cool chick…she’s stares at your ass as if it’s a porterhouse steak by the way. Not sure if you noticed that, oh and Brucy he’s like the bro, I never had. Thor…he’s…Thor. See look I even surpassed your expectations, this is me growing up. Are you proud Pep? Do I get a gold sticker?  I‘ll even let you put it on my helmet to show everyone one what a big boy I am.” Tony stopped spinning with a grin noticing the blush on his P.A’s face from mentioning Widow.
Today’s exam was over, there had been a routine weigh in and measurements with a blood draw. Simmons and Bruce were keeping a close eye to be sure that Steve’s nutritional needs were being met -despite the soldier’s high metabolism. It seemed the prenatal shakes were doing the trick, though Simmons mused that they may want to tweak the formula soon as Steve entered the later portion of pregnancy.
Steve seemed hesitant, “I still think this is a awful idea, the guy has problems…there’s no way we can take this. There is a lot of evil in the world but monsters? That’s just not real.”
Steve handled it far better than Tony did. The alpha went through the roof when he found out. Vowing to 'castrate that Wilson kid'.
“Aww…look at that, daddy does have a heart.” Steve quipped before tugging his alphas knuckles up to his lips and gracing them with a kiss. “I’ll be fine.”
"He's Captain America Tony. Do you think he'd lie?" Natasha interjected kneeling down next to the child.
Loki especially had been floored to see how much James' pack seemed to care for him, a man they once stood against. After all hadn't he been a villain in their eyes? A monster? Yet all that had changed, it had taken time but it had changed and now Loki could see that his fear of never being more in their eyes than some creature made of malice - was unfounded. It wasn't even that they did this just for James, they did this for him too. This was plain to see in his talks with Steve or quiet moments in the garden with Natasha.
Steve rolled over watching the two people he loved most sleep, Tony was curled on his side with Bucky at his back -metal arm draped over the omegas baby bump. Rogers never thought he would ever have this, yet here he was. It may have taken 70 years but it was worth the wait.
She made a convincing argument, of course she had. Natasha was a lot like Tony when it came to knowing just what to say . Oh, and there was the other complication in all of this. Tony.
Even Tony could tell how worried his AI was, “Don’t worry J, daddies home and I’ll get Steve all squared away.”  It may have seemed odd to many that the inventor would comfort his creation, but Jarvis was a lot more than just a few lines of code. Despite what anyone had said, Tony honestly believed his AI could learn and express just like a flesh and blood person. Jarvis was family.
Hydra had been floundering since Red Skulls second disappearance fallowing the failed capture of Captain America a few short years ago, the group was scattered at best until she came. A statuesque beautiful woman who claimed a name from the villainous collective's past. The Madam made quite the first impression with an extraordinary show of strength and intelligence. Those struggling to hold onto the reins of the shadowy organization didn't need much convincing.
“He doesn’t want this, and I’m not even sure how I feel right now. My mother struggled to support me, I know I wont have that much of an issue financially with this baby but, what about the job? How can I leave knowing I might not comeback? How is that fair…do I just. Put down the shield?” Steve leaned forward running his fingers through his hair. “I never even considered this as a possibility and now its here and I don’t know what to do. I‘m supposed to be a leader and I don‘t know what to do.”
Now here he was seated at a candle lit table with fine white linen napkins and silver that shined more than his shield. The omega wanted to do this right, trying to break into the vault of his mind and pull out old etiquette lessons from his youth. Steve mildly wondered if they still taught omegas etiquette in school. Something told him they probably did not. That of course did not mean he was going to embarrass himself in front of Tony by scarfing down his food like a starving man.
Steven did not know what to make of what he'd just witnessed. Was this a power all mer possessed or just this one? The Stark-look-alike seemed shocked. “Hey calm down it's alright please let me help you.”
“I see, so you’re simply a servant of his? I hadn’t thought Alexander was the type… though, I could see where he might make an exception. Come boy; let me see what it is your master has sent.” The old man beckoned, yet instead of taking the package he grabbed Steve by the arm and drug the boys slim form into his lap.
A small part of him wanted to snort diversely and say that he knew what his omega needed and didn't need anyone else to tell him, another part of him, the one that held so much respect for the woman beside him, quelled any protest. “I've been trying. Tashka... I really have. I can't fix it if he won't let me.”
What worked for the alpha wasn't a fix for Loki, and that's where he lost focus. James had assumed the things that were helping him were helping Loki.
Something about moments like that force you to look beyond your self -makes you want to come home. Even his love for Steve seemed pale to way his heart shook the first time he pressed a kiss to Peter and Wendy's sweet soft little foreheads. He would give anything for his children, and now...now there could be another one soon and Tony didn't want to miss out on that.
“Repercussions to bad behavior, little something I thought Stark was aware of and clearly has forgotten if you’re here looking like that and he’s no where to be found.” Phil spoke starting to unpack the folded clothing.
The baby‘s eyes were closed at the moment at Loki hadn‘t the heart just yet to wake him to see. Perhaps it was foolish but he hoped they were green. The pup’s hair was rich black and floated in soft tendrils around his crown. It was convincing to be sure, but still …Loki knew that this child did not come from Amora‘s womb. He knows this by the soft glow in the baby’s chest; it is barely perceptible until his own magic caresses the familiar siedr. Loki recognizes it as the gem that he gave Amora.
James looked up and spotted the lean relaxed form of his mate, long limbs lightly pinked from a warm bath. Hair still damp and dripping. A cloying scent of health and need tingling along the alphas synapses. “Lookin good enough to eat doll.”
“Hey! How do you know I wouldn’t be on top!” Tony snapped…cause apparently this conversation was just going great.
The use of her first name sent Pepper back a step. “I have seen you Tony; I have been there for everything so just please, let me be there now. Please I’m begging you just don’t do this, there has to be another way.”
Barnes wrapped his arms around the slender waist of his mate. “There’s no rush darlin, when it’s right it’ll be right.”
Suddenly, the younger man spoke up. “I may have some insight on that.” He said playing a clip of the woman calling herself Madam hydra. The digital memory played back the command memory.
The solder started and blinked at the ginger, “I wouldn’t say he’s mine..” Steve spoke looking away from her, he still didn’t get why Tony and pepper hadn’t bonded. She was perfect, funny, smart, and attractive and she wasn’t just a glorified science project.
Loki smiled to himself as his fingers slid over various shirts before selecting one in a deep plum. For once he was looking forward and not back. The small victory of daydreaming about paint colors or switching out the living room rug. Perhaps it would seem trivial to an outsider, but the truth was it meant he saw a tomorrow. These little ideas meant that Loki wanted more out of his life. Something to look forward to, to plan.
Dinner went by fast, considering Tony was dealing with a sleepy little. Steve nodded off half way through his soup. Tony smiled and was thankful he automated the special high-chair he'd made for the super solider. Letting the high roll ahead into the nursery and tilt gently. Tony's hands guiding the sleepy little's slide onto the bed.
James sat and centered himself, trying to focus back on his mission and all the solid black and white order of it. However, there was even edges of gray in this assignment.
If McCoy had a reply, Loki wasn't listening, already making his way down the halls to his modest office. The omegas demeanor wasn't unusual and both the staff and students knew this. The former villain had a habit of running hot and cold at the drop of a hat, however he was good at his job. He was talented and knew how to handle volatile young mutants who would otherwise end up slipping through the cracks.
Maybe he was a fool, an old fool with ego that still liked a good pet. Maybe he was wrong for winding his fingers through that long ink black hair and pulling Loki's hair back, bending that sinful form to his will and loving the ease of it.
Soon everyone else began to notice the looming darkness and change in the water. The coronation continued, a bit of pitiable weather would not stop this grand event. Instead, the crowd joyously applauded as Thor and his new bride were presented to the court and Odin stepped down, the old king proudly placed the crown on his eldest son’s head.
“Well, the night may not be lost yet” she said, eyeing the ships slow approach. Perhaps this would take her mind off her troubles by playing with the foolish mortal.
The key to any relationship can not be summed up into just one fundamental trait. No one can merely point to one thing over another. Communication, trust, love, desire, flexibility, caring... everything and a million others.
The AI, who had been quiet until now –“Yes Sir, and May I extend my welcome to you Captain Rogers. If you have need of any assistance do not hesitate to ask. It would be my deepest pleasure to aid you in any way possible.”
Over the last few months, she had spent a lot of time with Loki. In that time she had learned he wasn't at all what she was expecting. He liked to read and learn about life here, history and art. He was thoughtful and even kind. Most of all she quickly realized how unsure Loki was of himself and his abilities. The omega was constantly challenging himself. It was almost painful to see Loki wrestling with arbitrary choices that most people take for granted. His depression and anxiety had dug their claws in and ruled every facet of his day. When to get up; what to eat; what to say; everything wasn't just a yes or no it was an essay question in his head.
“Well 11th floor it is then, I suppose she knows I’m already here then yeah?” Tony already knew the answer to that but given how agitated the other alpha looked he thought he’d double check.
Even now over 70 years later, he wondered why he just couldn’t be normal, why the serum couldn’t have made him a whole alpha or even a beta. Why this? It hurt his as much as his malformed lower body.
After the festivities Asgard’s new King would appoint his council and things in the sea kingdom would return to normal. Daily life would resume with one exception, Jane would be queen. The idea of holding such a lofty position made the young siren nervous but with her love by her side and so much support from the kingdom itself – she was sure her new life would come to her step-by-step.
The once prince shook his head to dispel the laughing voice in his head. He has found James and that's what he came here for after all. He steps forward and sees Stark...or rather what’s Left of Stark. Tony is nothing like his former self. A frigidity seems to have settled over the man's features and it's enough to even make Loki shiver. He's seen that before in the face of a mad titan. The way the mortal stands there over the headless corpse and kicks it. Stark just seemed so...passive, was he even mortal now? He looked far to alive for the pain poor Steven had been going through.
The omega looked up to see Stark standing there in black suite and tie, staring down at Steve in disgust.
“I don't think he would see it that way Loki. If pepper was having a problem, I would want her to come to me. If anyone in the tower has a problem we go to someone who can help, even if it's just to listen.”
The other alpha gave him a strange look, questioning in away but too nice to say anything. It wasn’t like there wasn’t rumors about the sexual habits of Tony Stark. The billionaire, playboy, philanthropist had been known to tempt anyone gender or classification be damned. So the doubt meaning did not slip through the cracks.
“I’m sorry what? It sounded like. My ears....They heard...things, words that sounded as if you wanted.... nah you said you want another baddy right?  Since Reindeer Games is off the evil train, no worries schnookipus, I’m sure another evil drama queen from planet Euro-flare will come and ask you to come out and play.”
Tony’s shoulders slumped and he glared at the plating and various pieces. “With great power comes…. gaudy ass duds…doath grandmother know we wearith her drapes.”
“Of course! We shall speak at the feat of victory to follow!” Thor said giving his hammer a swing and obliterating an approaching tank.
Tony stood back and watched his mate pick up the test and look it over. Steve had a good poker face, for a moment Stark had kind words on the tip of his tongue. Maybe at least that bit of him was still human enough that they could try again and if not..then they could adopt. That was until he saw a soft smile beginning to form at the corner of the blondes mouth and twinkling blue eyes met his. “Is it...” he already knew the answer of course as that little Brooklyn smirk broke into a wide grin.
“Sit down Loki.” She says simply and the man looks surprised to find himself standing. “Sit. Down.” Natasha didn't want to have to do it; she detested pushing her own scent to kow omegas. Sometimes you had to use the tools you had, in Loki's case – physical strength would have been useless, biology however was something he couldn't fight. So the redhead lifted her chin and locked eyes with him, the sharp scent of command laces the air.
Amora was different; she was a lustful creature that had a craving for the hearts and devotion of men. He knew this and still, still he allowed her passage into the very heart of him. He welcomed her cloying voice and smoldering eyes, welcomed her lies because at the end of the day - the fantasy of her acceptance felt better than the reality of his solitary existence. At least it had at the time.
The Bones armor was blasting through the sky on the way back to the tower; Tony had gotten his systems back immediately and was already getting the run down from his AI.
Tony looked at her tearful reflection in the steel cabinets. “Thank you Pep,” Tony smiles sadly and for old times sake tipped his head forward, “That will be all Ms. Potts.”
That with the help of a brave group of soldiers, some of which lost their lives, America was safe again. Men that would be forever remembered among the memorials.  Men like Bucky… who would never see the end of the war, or the dream he had promised Steve.
“Good luck with that.” Bruce commented dryly handing a cookie to each pup before the twins ran off to terrorize Pepper and Natasha's other recent family member, a French bulldog named Butter.
The alien omega wasn't the most sociable and honestly, that had been fine for most of them. However, the more she thought about the worse it sounded. Yes- Loki had tried to take over the world and kill a bunch of people – them included. So a little animosity was understandable. Having gotten the full story form Thor later about Loki being just another pawn in a bigger scheme had made a difference to some, to others it was merely a technicality.
The two children had snuck away from their studies to explore. Tony always found his studies to slow and often boring, Bruce did as well but never said anything about it. This search for the unknown and exciting had brought the two little mer far outside the walls of Asgard and into the much darker colder waters outside the siren city.
The memory sent a shiver through the solider.  Tony reached out and steadied him, it was a good sign. The brunette could always tell when he was thinking about the ice.
Electricity, coal, steam, gas, and any combination of the four left Howard with more questions than answers. More dangers than benefits.
Of course this wasn't the Loki he remembered, apparently the original God of lies had been reborn..literally. Into this grinning little tease currently invading his office once again.
Their leaders mind was already made up, come hell or high water they were already in too deep. Even now hydra was assembling around the perimeter to insure that they would not be interrupted. Mallen looked over Beck's shoulder and spotted the silhouette of a woman standing at the far end of the warehouse. Her features obscured in darkness, so she was here to see if Killian's little toy really worked then.
Tony turned his back on the old headstone, his feet felt so heavy yet so light. Looking back at the car sitting on the street a few yards away. He didn’t even have to call out.
“No I,” He grumbled pecking a metal finger on top of the now closed manila folder. “I mean why you’re going on a mission right now.”
If the Ai could have sounded exasperated he would right now, “Sir, as Doctor Banner had advised against this, ‘prank’ you assured that this would be ’different’. Let me be the first to congratulate you on being horribly wrong.”
He licked his lips and began taking satchels of gold from the larger bag, tugging open the drawstrings and allowing the coins to sparkled in the moonlight. Howard had no idea what she could want currency for but the sailor said that mermaids had a fascination with shiny things, more so if the things had value. He just hoped the quantity of the glittering coins would be enough to temp her into giving him what he needed. “My son is very sick; I want you to heal him.”
The others tried to stop him, considering Stark could have used stitches and a head x-ray, but really, who could stop Tony Stark when he had his mind set on something?
Others knew the bitter thoughts and the pain that wasn't just in the mind but leeched out all over. Feeling like you can't breath or that you'll never sleep again. Pins and needles on your skin and cold that just won't leave you. It was real, it wasn't over dramatic and didn't just 'go away' when you cheered up. Because one good day never guaranteed another.
Steve shivered at the words and the scratch of the alphas facial hair on his skin, “Not a chance,” Tony replied as his hips twisted up in a particularly deep stroke. Steve moaned feeling the beginnings of the alphas knot teasing at his entrance. “Think you can take it honey?”
They had talked some about bounding, usually after making love, laying in the dark twined together. It was something they did want, which had been hard for Tony to admit. The truth was that the inventor never thought himself good enough for anyone. Steve was more than willing to show his alpha how much he was worse with another round of slow, heartfelt pleasure.
Loki turned to eye the slight blond as he ran between the two alphas chasing a ball they were tossing over his head. “Is he ill often?”
Loki sat with his head against the glass. He knew exactly what they were going there for. Part of him wondered if this would be the last time he would ever see the school he had grown to love. The stone walls and sprawling gardens that had become a sanctuary on days he could barely gather himself enough to go home. Soft laughter of children through the halls that welcomed him.
“Yeah.. Sorry I’ll just.” I move to get up and he stops me, or at least he get in the way. Lets face it with out the suit he can’t stop me from doing to much.
Loki had reluctantly agreed to the visit with his former employer with a touch of trepidation. He knew there was no effortless way to lie to Charles, even at his best it was difficult to cloak his mind from the man. Not that the Professor frequently allowed such liberties, only when Xavier felt there was no other way to get to the heart of the mater.
“We where lucky, the place that had Wade was very kind. Technically, Wade hasn't shown any abilities just yet. The fact that he carries the gene was enough to put him in a separate children's home.” Kurt spoke and shrugged his shoulders. “The only thing physically is the scarring you see. He heals very quickly but unfortunately his system doesn't seem to know when to stop.”
“ETA 1 minuet and 17 seconds Captain.” and if that wasn’t a great big ‘I do what I want’ from Tony’s electronic child, then Steve didn’t know what was.
Barnes shrugged his shoulders and poured a mug full, “Same, as always, he's a little testy about some things at school I think. Perfectionist ya know, wants those kids to be little geniuses I think.” The alpha laughed and poured himself another cup before sitting down. “He likes it though.”
She didn’t even look up, one well-manicured nail tracked over a glossy surveillance photograph, no doubt already cataloging all visible points of entry. “I’m going over the mission brief, just like you should be.”
“Just a …big fish…” He said to himself as the night grew still around him. The only sound to be had - the creaking of lanterns chain and the briny water lapping at the hull. “Just a…”
There was too much of it here, to much darkness that made everything feel tight. Like all this pain was closing in, high and oppressive like those filthy cave walls back in the dessert.
“Well come on in, Peter wanted Loki to read to him so they should still be up to that. We've got em all packed up so whenever you're ready, I think there's still some breakfast left over if you wanna fix yourself a plate.”
“Captain!” one of the men shouted as their Captain, an older man they all respected, fell at the hands of the opposition. Captain Abraham Erskine was brilliant and kind, not at all the kind of man one would think to lead a group of sailors into battle. He was fatherly in his nature and soft in his words. A learned man whom the crew would often find consulting his star charts or out on the deck enjoying the ocean air with a book of poetry. He did not deserve to be cut down so easily. Erskine was a man who should have gone home at the end of this last tour of service, to his wife and daughters, he should have have died old and comfortable in a bed surrounded by his family and grandchildren.
Peter nodded and looked over to where Daddy was brushing Wendy's hair and fixing it into two little buns on the top of her head the way she liked.
If Steve thought about it to much he wouldn’t be able to think of anything else and right now he needed to figure out where he was and why.
A little, raven haired girl with cool blue gray eyes, or a boy with messy brown hair. His heart even faltered when he considered a tiny baby in a car seat with soft robin’s egg skin and glittering ruby orbs.  It was painful to know that he would even want that, he would gladly take that. Years ago, he would have rather choked to death on his own blood than admit parentage to such a child....but now.
"It wasn't and you know that. If it had been me in that building Tony would have gone in after me. If it had been any of us he would have gone in there - hell or high water he wouldn't have left anyone in there." Steve corrects his friend's dark musings. He knows why Bucky feels this way, because Bucky still does not feel apart of this team.
Bruce stood up walking over to what Tony was looking at, “ These are the reports from the hospital after Cap was shot.”
An hour had passed and they now still hadn't come up with a solid strike team. Given what they knew about Hansen's formula, the woman in question had been brought in, they needed their heavy hitters. That was if the virus was at all like what Hansen had designed it to be. Her fear that her previous (now dead) employer, Killian, had perfected the formula or worse – made it even more effective that even Hansen had imagined, they could be facing someone with all the power of an enhanced soldier time 1000. In a perfect scenario they'd send in Steve and Tony maybe with him as cover. In an even better scenario they would have Thor on deck, a solid force to manage any variable. Alas, this was the worst-case scenario the team had feared when their two leaders bonded.
When the thin omega began to sob Steve just wrapped his arms around the other man. He whispered assurances for the other to let it all out, to purge all that poison from his heart. “Just give it up, you don't have to carry this anymore Loki. You are never alone.”
“Don’t worry I can take it from here,” Steve said as soon as they made it into the bathroom, the chill from the tile soaking into his bare feet sending a shiver up his legs. “Thanks.”
Tony curled his lip at the statement, “Look I don’t know about superior, he hasn’t seen Pulp Fiction yet so really the jury’s still out. But sure why not he’s as Alpha as they get for a guy who likes spandex.”
It was a sight enough to warm any frozen heart, or perhaps to warm. The sweetness almost burning like fire in an already brittle and damaged heart. Not that the little pup would ever know. Or that Loki even understood the slight pain that pricked in his chest when he looked at the bedraggled little one whose chubby finger wrapped so innocently around the heather gray linen of his lounge pants.
Yes, some things had changed, but thanks to the internet, you could find almost anything. Included dresses that would fit a 6ft plus 200 some pound super solider, and make it look decent.
Loki groaned and threw his hands out. "Why do you have to be so nonchalant. Why go on about all this decorum." spitting the words out like they tasted foul. "I've seen the footage stark...the man you used to be. That man wouldn't have thought twice about clearing this desk for me."
She smiled, even if it was a sad and broken express that sat too thin on her aged face. "You have a son."
Returning to the med lab, no one said a word about the previous discussion. It was easy to see that all parties felt it was best left for now. The last order of business would be to conduct an ultrasound. The one done by shield previously, had been grainy and over quickly. Doctor Simmons assured she would get them a good image this time with the sonogram.
“Petey what’s wrong?” Tony knelt down, he hadn’t seen the little boy in months and now Peter was crying. Well he wasn’t father of the year that was for damn sure.
After all...everything he touched turned to smoldering ash so why would his garden have been any different.
“You thought yourselves rid of Amora the most feared sorceress of the sea…well we shall see what you think of me now.”
“No, I would never allow such harm to come to any man, no matter his past actions. I can not speak to a healer’s craft, but from what I have seen from my own brother - Lady Eir is efficient.”
Along with no missions, Steve also had to curb his usual exercise regimen. Gone were the days of 5am runs in central park followed by 300 sit-ups, pushups and squats. In its place was now light jogging on the treadmill and morning yoga with Bruce.  It was different but it wasn’t terrible, although if a certain Alpha had his way ‘enthusiastic sex’ would have replaced everything as workout numero- uno.
The inventor looked up from the wall of holograms; it was the new suit design. “Steve was never reckless Pep; he was so by the book that he could have written it and look what it got him. Now if you don’t mind I have a revenge to plot and unlike those catchy proverbs, it actually is better served hot. Piping fucking hot and preferably up the rectal cavity of my enemies.” Tony spun around moving components left and right, the old suits seemed to bulky now; he needed more speed and more silence. He wanted something that was build to kill.
“Nothin good.” the line crackled slightly from wind, even with the disruption in sound it was not hard to spot the apprehension in Barnes voice. Tony wasn't going to like this. “Extremis is in the wind with a crazy skin head and if that doesn't tickle your fancy, aforementioned skin head is being funded by Hydra.”
Banner blushed slightly, he still felt odd receiving praise. “Your welcome Steve. Honestly, anytime you need to talk I'm here.”
That certainly was not going to happen as Steve was now off the sofa and pacing in front of the TV as he flipped through multiple media outlets looking for an angle that might show Tony surfacing unharmed. “Jarvis tell me he’s ok, put me through to the suit.”
The omega’s words where sluggish and to be honest, Stark was a little concerned about that. “You ok honey? You looked a little loopy. I need you to talk to me and let me know you’re hanging in there ok?”
A line formed between the blonds brow, “Great, so what exactly is true anymore? Since faking deaths is so popular these days you’ll excuse me agent if I’m not suspicious. Are we even fighting Hydra or did Fury do
Chris hemsworth (in all his aussi awesomeness) : And here we have a wild Tony and Steve, aren't they little beauties. Observe the intense scowl as apart of the mating dance. If we remain perfectly still...they may kiss ..or someones left boob will be grabbed. Lets Watch!
She nodded and headed out to the kitchen where poor Stark had been remanded after a particularly annoying comment about how he was sure he could invent some sort of cervix measuring laser pointer.
“Good to be back. All the good little girls and boys tucked in for the night?” Tony asked, making his way into the penthouse and too the bar. After a non-stop flight at top speeds, he could use a bourbon refresher.
Tony snickered, “And they are moody, I know how pep gets. Should we get them ice cream? Hey Jarvis queue up Ally Mcbeal for Capsicle and the Space Viking, That time of the month.
Tony smirked and leaned into the door, breathing deeply to catch that barely there cloying sweetness slithering through the door jam. Ok whatever, he could care less what Steve was doing in there right now because his pants just got tighter with just one sweet whiff. “That a...internal thermometer? Because I could help, hell you can call me Dr. Stark. I have a doctorate ya know. I just don't have people call me that because it’s pretentious. For you though...Mmm. Yep the Doctor is in sweetness!”
“Tony… Tony please.” Steve twisted on the floor tugging hard at the glowing restrains around his wrists. “Don’t…please don’t…”
The tide of public opinion was turning violently. There was a quiet voice in the crowd that began chanting for the end of heroes, for the rise of something darker. Like an infection, that voice was growing, taking root in the lonely and disenfranchised.
It felt like going into the ice all over again. A spike of white hot blinding pain through his bond. Steve wasn't the only one feeling it, as the soldier hit his knees amid the shouts of children he looked up. There just a few feet away was Loki clutching his own chest with wild eyes, sharing a look between them said it all. Something was wrong, very very wrong.
Second was another of Loki’s monstrous pets, a hippocampus called Sleipnir, the creature was old as Asgard itself and had always been untamable. That was until Loki, as a pup the prince had wandered away and come face to face with the monstrous creature. For whatever reason, Sleipnir lowered his head and nudged the curious little mer onto his back. Taking the tiny green-tailed pup back to the palace where everyone was in awe. From that day, Sleipnir had watched Loki from a distance and sought the mer out a time of two. Loki had no fear at all when he heard the familiar drum of hooves on the corals beds one afternoon. He looked up and spotted his curious little toddler swimming right up to the creature. Tony tiled his head to the side before looking back at his father.
The city and the nation held a modest welcome, per Steve’s request to quote ‘hold the fan fair for our boys fighting overseas, I’m just one man.’
Over the following months, the parking garage of Stark industries had been turned into a rose garden - Steve and Pepper kinda didn't hate this one. Everyone whose car was covered in vines didn't feel the same way.   Once again there was a letter detailing how every flower paled in comparison to the beauty of the Widows hair, the ferns a mere whisper when set against her eyes.  If nothing else Loki did have a way with words.
Steve crept back over and ticked Peter’s sides making the child squirm and squeal. They were able to trade off so Tony could get changed; Steve could already see how this was going to go for a while. Chances were that Peter was going to need to be next to at least one of them at all times until he felt safe and sure his parents were not going to ‘disappear’.
Barnes had worked up a sweat helping Stark get a feel for his new enhanced strength. They boxed, ran and took out some aggression on the heavy bags. Conversation between them keeping to lighter topics while putting one another through the paces.
That was the kick in the ass that Tony needed to finally get up on his hands and knees and force the suit up. “Cap was watching wasn’t he?”
“No no…Steve… baby look at me. We can do this, we can beat this. I will be right there every step of the way and I’m obscenely rich so you will have the best care.” Tony was starting to tear up and Steve was desperately trying to stop him.
Unfortunately, he wasn't a man who believed in miracles though, he believed in science and machines. He believed in the copper coils and the sparkling blue lights as they marched from one to the next and lit the large glass bulbs of the workshop. Stark believed in the tangible and the measurable. He required a resolution that he could trust but the fact remained... there was not one he could find.
“So, Mally dear,” Stark's voice echoed around the warehouse. His voice taking on a metallic edge that sharpened each phrase like a razor. “You wanna put your toys away like a good boy before I have put you in time out?”
“They were worried about you, thought the serum might have gone ass over elbows cause I knocked you up.”
The team convened at SHIELD headquarters to discuss their options and try and formulate a plan against this new and potentially deadly threat. The nostalgia of moment might have been night under any other circumstance. It seemed that with all the changes in the last few years, the avengers that the world knew were beginning to bow out to the next generation. Not that they were off their game mind you, but they had expanded their ranks and were training new recruits every year. Sitting around the big round table with familiar faces and the buzz of activity – felt like the year they first came together. Thankfully this time with out the animosity, and a live Coulson.
The idea that he could have missed out on his son’s life, on waking up again to find the person he loved long dead or their mind riddled with dementia. Steve didn’t think he could bear that again. He had such a hard time seeing Peggy like that. The thought of Tony, his Tony, his brilliant husband  struggling to remember what day or year it was.
“So you’re real. Then I have business with you. That’s how this works isn’t it? I offer you something and you grant me a wish or miracle…magic that your kind are known for.”
Barnes did understand,, now that he thought about Loki wasn’t far off from Steve cycle wise, he idly  wondered if maybe that’s what his omega was so worried about. They had been trying with no success, was Loki wanting to stop? “Yeah…no I get it. Look, I’ll keep my ear to the ground for you on this one and if anything pokes it’s head out I’ll be sure to get on the detail. You just look out for Stevie.”
“Ughhhhh STEEEB” Tony groaned theatrically and checked his watch again. “We aren't like any other couple though. Embrace your extra life!”
Bruce had been chatting affably with Colossus outside, they seemed to be having a very enthusiastic discussion about traditional Russian meals. Banner had been much the world traveler in his days before the avengers.
Tony ran his hand back through his uncultivated hair before giving Potts the thumbs up. “Yeah Peps got it…old guys and binders lots of talking that I won’t be doing… making it far less interesting by the way, but sure I’ll be there.”
“They won’t touch him, the nurse called Lady Eir but it only made him worse. I’m sorry your highness…” The girl looked on the verge of tears as the little one whined and hiccuped pitifully in her arms. “He would not eat and all he does is cry.”
Steve really had just steamrolled ahead and assumed the absolute worst of his alpha. “I guess not. He still left, still ran out of here like his britches were burning.”
Part of the Alpha wanted to be angry, wanted to demand why? Why, when he would have been right there, would have listened, would have done anything for Loki. Why, when Loki could have opened up to him, hell to anyone!?  Then he would look at the one person in this world who knew what hell looked like, who could understand him more than even his best friend and James knew....if their roles reversed, he wouldn't have asked for help either.
"I knew that the Nashville summer trip last year would bite me in the ass one day." The man laughed.
Inside the box sat a note with scrawling handwriting with a familiar phrase. ‘I bet you didn’t see this coming.’  Clint lifted the note away to see the object beneath. A pair of booties, tiny yellow knit socks, so small the pair of them fit in the palm of his hand.
The omegas of the house smiled in agreement that this was a move in right direction. Though Pepper did give her employer a stern talking to in the form of a - ‘don’t break Captain America’ speech.
This would be the only reprieve; they had been in here for a while and could afford to be ‘missing’ to long. Steve trailed his fingers down and slid them between the inventors clef, “Your wet. Did you…” Steve gulped down feeling his cock throb at the idea.”
“And I said no, respectfully Sir. You did give me an order to safeguard the Captain and that is what I am doing. He is agitated and would benefit from the quiet. If you would like to join him shortly I can certainly send the lift back down for you at such time when Steven has collected himself.”
She thought about what Bruce said and didn't want to think it was anything so sinister as domestic abuse. Barnes came from the time when Omegas were often taken in hand for bad behavior. Thus far, Natasha didn't think he had that sort of mentality. Given that Barnes wasn't a traditional Alpha, (the serum created by HYDRA had done that to him). Growing up beta, he would have had an outside perspective on the treatment of omegas. Weather he remembered that or not. Not only that - she had seen him in the field, watched his interactions. Barnes was to controlled, he fought so hard for that control that there was no way he'd risk losing it.
To have loved and lost is the cruelest of punishments. It flew in the face of every heartbreak, every supreme grief. If you never know what it is to love and be loved you cannot lament its loss.
“No I get it, everything's off right now. I shouldn't have expected to come back here and be welcomed with open arms. Hell, I'm not even human anymore am I? “Tony shoved his hands in his pockets and shrugged his shoulders, pushing hard on that dark presence that screamed for him to stand up and take what he wanted. The arrogant voice that said he should go out and do as he please.
Sure enough, just as he was tempted to draw up the lantern and weep - there was a splashing in the mist, a flicker of olive, vibrant ruby and gold. He felt his heart skip a beat as the shimmering silhouette circled the boat twice before descending in the inky depth.
Loki had waited this long to let go, casting wards around the house that he'd been working on for weeks to dampen the connection to his alpha. As underhanded as that was, Loki needed this and yet still he couldn't. His cursed pride or fear or whatever it was, could not falter.
The alien smiled hedging his legs around the muscular male’s hips and grinding into him. It was a dirty trick but enough to throw the mortals concentration enough to turn the tables. “My. We wouldn’t want that now would we?”
Bucky eyed the torn flier and picked it up, “Steve won’t like it.” He commented reading further down before quoting the opening line “able bodied men with experience at sea.’ kinda counts me out don’t-cha think?”
“yeah.. it’s, that’s a good idea. On both accounts.” Steve was just ready to end this day honestly. He hoped he could get some kind of sleep although he doubted it. His head was to full, Bucky, the serum, his nature, Tony… why did everything have to be so complicated.
He hated having to do this to her, after hearing how bad off Steve was since the coms to Stark went down. He knew how much Natasha cared about her pack but that was exactly why she needed to stay there. “You and Banner need to stay there. You know I’m right.” It was beginning to look like Hydra had anticipated their arrival; if they had, they may also attempt to infiltrate the tower.
Steve was dog tiered when he came home from his last mission, falling into bed and dieing for the next 15 to 20 hours seemed like a good plan. Well…that is if you don’t live with Tony Stark.
Thor looked away; he did not want to hurt Loki further. Perhaps it was better that he knows the truth, no matter how painful. “She tried to pass the child off as mine. She claimed the Norns ‘created the child as a gift’. When I looked at him I knew she was lying, he reminds me much of you from our childhood.”
Asmuch as he would have liked to relish in her beauty and take solace in her touch – there was another matter pressing in his mind. “Have I missed much? I noticed Duchess was in my mother's gardens and had hoped Loki was visiting, but he wasn't there.”
With Loki's strengths and talents, as well as his designation that made it easier for other omegas and shy betas feel naturally at ease. The first time one of the students hugged him, it felt so strange. Loki just stood there stiff as a board and looked down at the wide-eyed young girl, a girl who had been so scared of her powers. She was terrified of losing control and hurting someone.
Alright perhaps it was a confusion of terms..or maybe just his hair, although Thor had long hair and he was sure the child never called him 'lady' then again Thor was rather grizzled  and not many women have facial hair by choice.  "Can you  you say Loki?"
If i posted a story about !Abusive Tony/Skinny Steve would anyone read that? it would be kinda dark. Just wondering!
That last sentence hung in the air between them and Steve’s face grew red. “Keep me safe…Keep. Me. Safe?  What do you think I am some helpless little breeder you have to lock away so I don’t hurt myself?”
It was time to pick up the pieces and do the only thing he knew how to do, Tony Stark was going back to work, and hell hath no fury than a man with nothing left to lose.
“What will you do, if I say I want to keep it.” That’s really, what I’m worried about. Keeping this baby has a lot more implications than getting rid of it or even putting it up for adoption after its born. Keeping it means the rest of our lives.
Loki prancing around in a European looking bathing suit. All long lines and alabaster flesh, eyes guarded by a pair of large dark sunglasses as he waves his hands commanding jets of water and soap like an orchestra leader. The arches of water raining droplets over the gods lean form.
“40% Sir. I can transfer power to the heel thrusters once you are upright. Using the power left you should be able to surface and make your way to the Shield vessel. Agent Coulson has the Bones armor on board as your back up.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile, he’d dreamed of this when he was younger. Sitting in a crowded theater with someone holding his hand. Feeling small in front of that big screen as colors flashed by, of course in those days the colors were muted by his poor eyes unable to perceive the rich reds and vibrant green.
“Careful pretty boy. Some one might think something, come in here find you flat on your back like this.” Barnes purred into the nobles ear when he had Loki pinned.
Natasha just laughed, “Honestly Stark, do you think I’d ever share my secrets. I would be too much for you. Now be a good boy and pack up, get back to Steve.”
So this is from the last episode, it seemed like y’all just loved all the ideas so I’m just going to do them all!   #10 -Change all the dates in the tower to read 2233 and convince Steve he took a nap for 217 years and everyone is a robot now.
James had gently led him back inside and suggested they watch a movie. The omega had nodded but spent the film staring at his hands.
Tony lowers his head in that shameful schoolboy way when he's done something he knows Steve won't like. “Things didn't go like we thought they would. I had to do something, if I hadn't...I wouldn't be here, Barnes wouldn't be here. I had JARVIS proof Hansen's work before we left. I had him run the formula backwards and forwards and correct all the errors. It was just meant to be a backup, I didn't even think we had enough time but then it was done and Steve...” He looks up and he's smiling. It's a little manic grin, like when he's been up for days in the workshop. “Babe I did it, I fixed Extremis and it's beautiful it's perfect the things it can do. It saved me.”
Sorry it's been a while. My self esteem in off in a drain someplace but I'm fine. Anywho, I tried my best here so hopefully this isn't a steaming pile crap. If it is horrible ..idk keep it to yourself cause I just can't.  Enough of this stuff, here's what you really want. enjoy if you can.
Bruce looked utterly adorable and soooooo ready to hand of the whining, squirming little pink bundle in his arms. “Yeah she’s demanding like you Tones.”
Loki's tone is clipped and if James isn't mistaken – secretive. Seemed that was becoming a permanent feature where Loki was concerned. Still, he couldn't very well jump to conclusion. “You okay doll?”
“No, I’m just wondering if you’re real or if all the stress finally addled my brain.” It would not be that much of a stretch he thought; perhaps he had never even left home. What if this entire week was fantasy and he was really just looked away in some asylum right now. Maybe his mind had broken from losing his wife…and his child.
This earning the alpha a smack on the top of the head and a reproachful glare. “Watch it shell head, their sore.”
Her face was impassive, “ And you can, you can chose to let a child believe is his father is dead and watch a spouse self destruct all for the greater good. You know, I used to work for men who thought much the same, they thought they could take children and turn them into killers.”
The pair exchanged blows and it killed Steve to do it, Bashing the Shield against the face plate between blocking metal clad fists. All the while shouting for Tony to stop.  Finally, the solider was so fed up he put every ounce of strength into knocking his opponent backward.
I decided then that I would never lose you again, no mater the lies i had to tell..if the old me had to die to be free. I would find you and keep you safe, because your last piece of light i have.
In the cold hard light of day when that express shipping kicked in and Clint unwrapped that FedEx box with all the gusto of a kid on Christmas morning. Maybe he realized this was a stupid purchase. He wasn’t going to admit it though.  The Gazelle in the corner and the full set of snacky cups would not allow it. Oh hell no, he was going to use this things and show everyone.
To add to this was the alphas own puzzling behavior. The first day after the heat Tony wouldn’t leave him alone, but now it was hard to get a read on the inventor as he flitted around the tower like a ghost. Never hanging around Steve any longer than he had to, always citing some project that he needed to get to. The last few nights, Steve spent alone on his own floor, staring up at the ceiling and wondering what it all meant.
After the kitchen was cleaned and dishes put away Steve still had to go into town, the package left for him by the door with specific directions of the destination. A merchant’s hall near the castle, to a man named Gideon Malick.
Tony didn’t miss how the younger man’s eyes trailed over Steve on the hospital bed; there was regret and a hint of longing there. Still it seemed that Wilson didn’t understand the protective feeling he was having either. Tony was used to being the smartest guy in the room but this time it felt almost unfair to have the edge this time.
“Ha, yeah I doubt it’s nothing I couldn’t throw together in an afternoon while watching spoongebob. What about you cupid?”
The memory sent a shiver through him. Steve pulled himself from the bed, trying to escape the thoughts of his past by distracting himself. Yet, even that act made the omega’s bones ache from effort, and he felt even more lethargic than he had upon going to bed in the first place.
Tony took it well, until he stood up and just kept muttering the word “baby” and hit the floor. Steve was almost 100% sure that the inventor had a stroke until a nurse cracked a capsule of smelling salts under the brunette’s nose that brought him back around. At which time Tony denied ever fainting, called it ‘
Natasha took a sip of her tea, he was calling her bluff. Fake it until you make it. “Satisfaction brought him back. We say that too.”
Stark laughed manicly falling back into the sofa. “Fucking Barnes..of course...at least he has flare.” With a wave of his hands the doors opened. Tony didn't even bother trying to look like he wasn't falling apart.
Steve lead the charge throwing his shield and using his fists to dispatch the metallic soldiers, the rest of the team working together to destroy the android decoys  left and right that ran about the city causing chaos and destruction. As far as Villains went, Scorpio was still on the ‘underwhelming’ end of the spectrum. The only thing he had on his side was numbers, and maybe hostility.
He did for Tony, for that moment his mind closed in on that one ray of light and thirsted for the comfort the Alpha could provide. Then the guilt came.
Tony thought of Steve, beautiful with morning sunlit hair and sinful with kiss-swollen lips in the moonlight. His omega, the other half of his heart. The one thing he couldn't live without – having to go on with out him. Tony thought of his kids, Peter graduating from MIT, Wendy would go to West Point of course – she was her papa's girl through and through. He'd miss it; he'd miss all of it and then...then that last fleeting horrifying thought. What if there was another even now? A child whose face he would never even get to see and that...that is what cut into him like a red-hot knife.
There was no easy fix for this. No way to undo the damage that had been done because too much time had passed for that. Steve knew all the guilt Tony carried around already for the people he couldn’t save and the weapons of death and destruction that his fathers company made. His husband felt all of those pains as uniquely as if they were wounds on his flesh. Now… they truly were. Steve could see the scars from Vengeful’s rough edges on Tony’s arms and signs of the past months etched on the inventers face. This wasn’t something Steve could chase away with words and touches. No amount of assurance that he could provide would cleanse this away. All he could do was be here. To stand strong and be partner Tony needed right now.
The next few minuets were spend trying to get a nearly delirious super soldier under control, and as much as Tony hated doing it, he ended up growling and commanding Steve to be still. The effect was both productive and unfortunate. It made Tony wonder if that was the real reason; the government never let the truth get out. How hard would it be for some army to soup up an alpha with doubled pheromone production that could kowtow Captain America? The mental image of Steve kneeling before some hydra Alpha made him both sick and incredibly pissed off.
Living in the tower had been an adjustment for Loki, but considering all he had done to prove he wasn't in fact evil had helped his cause. Then there came the blooming relationship with Dr. Banner. That last one had come out of the blue for both of them.  Yet some how Bruce had been the one person who could truly understand him, and the mans calm demeanor was like balm to his soul. Eventually living among the midgardians had begun to ware off on him.
The more they prepared the more possible it sounded. To seal the deal Stark showed them a ‘specimen’ one of his former employees had been able to bring back.
"I'm fine. The food is fine." the food was an inferno blazing down his esophagus and likely eating a hole through his sternum. Did they cook this battery acid?
“The records that SHIELD has were already altered by your father. No one knew the truth but those involved with the project, of which I am the last one still alive.” Rockwell looked down a moment, his eyes half closed as he considered his own mortality. He had come here with one reason. One hope.
Of course, it didn’t take long for his former teammates to come banging on his door asking what he was thinking.
All those pathetic feelings of not playing god and not crossing that invisible line of what was too much. How foolish, nothing was too much! The world needed progress it and sometimes you had to burn away all the old to rebuild the new.
He hadn't felt this numb in years. It wasn't as if he could scream or lose his mind. He had to keep it together; there was a brokenhearted little boy who had already lost his family once that was depending on him. There was no time to morn what he lost because if he let himself do that he would break and he absolutely could not break... Stark men were made of iron.
Green eyes glanced up softening even if only slightly. "Plotting world domination and demise of my enemies. And no, i should say not. Some rather unflattering things have been said by your midgardian reporters seemed to find it sporting to insult my leathers.  MY LEATHERS, which by the way, were hand crafted by the finest makers in all the nine realms and are not in anyway reminiscent of your.....FETISH catalogs!!"
With a hard shove, Cap sent his assailant against the wall of the next landing, the shield returning to his back to gain range of motion. “Bucky.. come on, don’t do this.. don’t be this!”
“Oh Stevie you scandalous little slut. .I love it. Imagine the vanity fair article!” The alpha then proceeded to bounce up onto his knees and put on a horrible high fake voice “ Mister Stark, how do you keep going? Saving the world, crafting revolutionary tech and just being the hansom devil you are?” He then turned and stroked fingers through his hair and put on a suave smirk, “Well Debbie, I suck off Captain America first thing every morning. A double shot of that all American Freedom spunk and I’m ready to face the day.”
Tony sighed happily and polished off his odd lunch. “Don't look so sour honey bunny, You know my favorite treat is still tall dark and handsome with a side of moody.” He winked and lounged back on the sofa.
Tony didn’t mean to but he was pulling a bit of natural rank on this one. He hadn’t done this many times, only once when Pepper had been so angry she was flinging glass wear after a meeting. That had been a while ago, but he still knew how. Its just a matter of letting his instincts take the lead, pushing pheromones and skin to skin contact.  He hated using it on Steve because it was an unspoken promise since he found out, that he’d never try and cow Steve like that. Never use biology against him, but this wasn’t an attack or even about power. This was Tony seeing this man before him practically dying inside.
The eldest prince made his way through the halls until he was just outside his brother’s chambers. He knew by now the guards had alerted their father, their mother would know and soon so would the kingdom. It would be better for Loki to learn of his child from family rather than the gossip of the court.
Natasha silently closed the file and neatly folded her hands atop the block lettering declaring TOP SECRET, “No I’m not, we still have a few weeks and everything is going well. I don’t have to watch her every hour of the day to make sure she’s fine.  She babysat Stark for years and managed not to die or be severely injured. I trust her and I trust the pack.”
He followed the whispers of guitar up the beaten path that lay washed in the hazy yellow glow of work lights. A fond smile touching his lips when spotting the engineer under the old rusted harvesting machine. Rogers stood there a while just admiring the form of the man before him. Tanned skin shining with sweat and grease, the spiced scent of labor and oil sent a shiver down his spine. “Tony.”
“Steve? Sugar?” Walking down toward the bedroom Tony wrinkled his nose as at an acrid tang in the air. “Honey?”
The call would come and James would suit up and head off on whatever it was that SHIELD demanded. Gone for days sometimes weeks, then he'd come home...but he would wouldn't really come home. Not immediately. At first, his alpha would sit alone on the back deck with Duchess' head in his lap and a case of beer resting at his side. Just staring out at the pitch-black woods and star speckled sky for hours until whatever veil lifted from his mind and allowed him to come home. Calls like this never ended well, it was too abrupt. Too much, like waking up after years in a frozen cell to be used.
One last glance in the mirror to confirm the mask: Proud, defiant, cold, intelligent, dangerous. It is better to be respected and feared than treated like beloved little lamb. Loki did not want or need anyone's pity.
“Indeed I do not care what you think, however you mortals are meddlesome creatures with the penchant to tattle-tale like mere pups at the first sign of disturbance! I find concealment to be a far better option that giving you or any of your ilk more ammunition of which to use against me!” He seethed wanting nothing more than to fling the woman out of the cabin all together. Loki knew he was taking this to far but he was so damn tired and all he wanted was to be left alone. Then Romanov appeared and who knew what she would tell James if she had the chance.
“Aww, did Nicky not give you hugs growing up?”  The jabs about the villain’s blood relation to Nick Fury served to throw off Scorpios focus.
James looked back to see Stark open a panel on the side of the gauntlet, inside was a syringe of silvery looking liquid. “Stark...the hell are you doing.” The question was moot really, James knew by the look on the other mans battered and bruised face that what ever was in that cylinder wasn't B12.
They took a moment to reacquaint in the gentler position. Kissing and touching in the quiet, letting the moment warm between. Tony didn’t want this to feel like a ‘means to an end’ for Steve. Bonding was supposed to be intimate as well as functional. He wanted his omega to have a good memory of this moment.
Madam Hydra, or rather Ada. Wasn’t human enough to have the same grudge that her garnet faced predecessor had. She was just seeing if her new toy was worth the effort. It wouldn’t have mattered who showed up.
James wanted that too, and he was her friend, her pack and pack stuck together. So she made the drive to see for herself what was going on with Loki.
He wasn’t like Bruce or Tony who had been successful in their fields even before they chose this rode in life. Rather, it chose them as the case maybe. Natasha , Clint, Thor… they all had something outside of this, they all had something more to give.
Something about the blondes voice didn't exactly scream welcome home, then again Tony shouldn't have expected it to after what he'd been putting Steve through. As soon as the kids were out of sight the omega crossed his arms and lifted his chin. A challenge to even try anything remotely funny.
That night they hadn’t done anything else, Tony had simply taken his hand and the pair of them entered the billionaire’s bedroom. Steve had started to say something about that but Tony just hushed him with a single glance. Guiding him to sit, then kneeling before the omega, and unlacing his shoes. Stark's movements were quiet and careful, warn hands dept at working with delicate machinery - moved swiftly but still treated the simple act with reverence. There was no hurried tugging of the boot or colorful remarks. Tony was just stoic and focused the same way he would be as if in the lab creating.  First boots, socks, and then shirt, each item removed with out the usual flirtation. Steve had not seen this side of the alpha, but he supposed it was always there.  It made his face warm and chest flutter as those work callused hands slid under his t-shirt and tugged it over his head. The fleeting brush of Tony’s knuckles over his skin.
Tony stood up and gestured manically to the shop, “Look at this Steve, the most experience I have at raising things is machines. If I can’t oil it or Sauder it or switch out some fucking screws I have no idea what to do. I was just barely keeping things copasetic between us and now…” Stark stopped mid rant and turned his back to the omega, a hand rubbing nervously at his beard. “I don’t want to ruin this. For once in my life I have something I can’t lose.”
Tony shook his head and sat heavily behind his desk in the home office. “This is for us, I'm doing this for us...,” he said quietly. All altruism aside,  he couldn't just let this fall by the wayside. Even if he wasn't going to worry Steve with it, someone needed to stay on top of this just in case. He could call Fury...then again – he wants to help Hansen and doesn't trust Fury not to snatch her up.  Agent would be out too, for all the good Phil was – at the end of the day, he's still a company man.
Steve sat forward knees on this elbows, fighting the urge to bury his face in his hands. “Is their anyway to prevent it?
Even after these last few years, Bucky still feels like a visitor in the halls of the tower. Still has that awkward stance when the team behaves like a family, as if he's almost intruding. There are times rare when his old friend becomes what he remembers, oddly enough, it's usually with Tony. It's funny how the quirky inventor can bring out that ease in everyone.
Steve smiled and slowly lowered himself onto the floor with a groan. His back and knees bothered him today; he hoped all the more his so-called family would not return tonight then maybe he could boil some water for a bath. He was only allowed to bathe in an old wooden washtub outside usually.
As the sunlight grew dimmer with the end of day, the luminescent jellies swam in through the colonnade arches and huddled together in the palace domes. The small creatures created a flood of soft violet light when they crowed in one place. Bathing the halls in the welcomed hue.
“Hey, it’s ok. I know it hurts but daddy’s gonna make it all better.” He said fondly unwrapping the blanket.
“Right away Sir,” The Ai responded as hydraulics shifted taking the lift down beneath Stark industries.
Stark felt his hair stand on end at the tone in Steve’s voice, the omega’s face took on a look between confusion and fear, reaching out just before those blue eyes rolled to white. This was Tony Stark’s nightmare, forget caves, forget torture, and forget black holes in fucking space. Losing Steve trumped them all.
Simmons hesitated, “Well, yes. However, Steve, I can assure you that the percentages of healthy babies between both bonded and unbounded omega is very close. Given that you are in good physical health and the babies are progressing nicely I see no need for you to do anything you don’t want to do.”
Bruce thought back to simpler days, days before the gamma exposure, before villains and heroes. He wondered how different things would be and for not the first time Dr. Banner knew he wouldn't change a thing. Without that one choice he would have never been invited to join the Avenger initiative and would have never met Natasha or Pepper. His life would be resigned to a lab and his papers.
Once he had…well. It was anyone’s guess what the time pup could get up in his exploring. Loki did not hover as some might suggest him to; he wanted his child to be curious. Curiosity meant intelligence and Loki had been a very curious pup himself. That did not mean he let the tiny mer flounder around unattended.
Tony rolled his eyes, “Yeah well now the sinks not worth anything, come on sugar. This looks intensely uncomfortable and I can’t leave you in here, Pep would murder me if I was well-rested and you looked like a zombie because the twins decided to stage a revolution.”
Although, that’s what made Widow so deadly. Her stealth was unmatched. She could infiltrate a maximum-security base, download all of their Intel and sneak out before anyone even knew she was there. She could also distract one high-strung billionaire with sweets and caffeine to keep him from doing something stupid, all the while pretending like it was nothing more than lunch. Yeah, she was good.
“Steve! I ain’t seen anything like this! It’s not what Stark's looking for!” Bucky shouted over the howling winds.
Then he was left alone in that big master bedroom. “I’m doing this for us Steve, for Peter, for you. I hope you know that. I just can’t let it go, I can’t.” Tony made up his mind, he would appease Pepper for a few days, but he had work to do. He could rest yet. He had to make sure that there was no one out there that could hurt his family.
It took a few days of discussions to decide what to do with Bucky. The talks ranged from the unthinkable to the down right cruel. Meanwhile, the arm Hydra created had been removed - including the kill switch that had been deeply embedded in the shoulder mechanism. All done by Tony, he didn’t like Barnes but it didn’t necessarily mean he blamed him either.
Now to the alpha's absolute horror, he was the old man in the room. Young alpha's with too much privilege and all these high ideals in their heads were starting to take a foothold. Still wet behind the ears (In Tony's opinion) who's idea of a good time was going to some weird restaurant that served craft beer with names like “Rose Rock ale” and “Citric dream logger”. Talking about going gluten free and how their Omegas took yoga. Spending the week with alphas that had soft hands and even softer egos. He's sure he made one of them cry.(Sorry, not sorry)
Phil shook his head and grinned at the chatter before raising his weapon and taking out a few on coming androids. “Well Mac, it's the way of the future isn't it.” “Fits, how’s the traffic cam's look?”
“Crazy stuff right?” Tony said popping a blueberry in his mouth.  “You do need to keep something down though with how you burn calories on the regular this is just going to kick it into overdrive.”
It was wrong then and maybe it was wrong now but who cares. They had each other back, hell, high water, and hydra couldn’t stop them. James Barnes was going to make the most of his new life.
The director felt his mouth go dry. "Whatever game this is kid I'm not playing it." he wanted to though, maybe that made him wrong but he couldn't shake it.
Evidently the recording was still being broadcast and instead of laughing everyone was now glaring at Tony.
While this answer seemed a bit more cut and dry, it did not explain why or how Loki came to be this way. Then again, Loki was a master of disguise. They all knew how well Loki could conceal the truth if motivated. The problem was knowing the truth behind the motivation. “Loki can you tell me what happened?Is your heat normally irregular?”
Like how the children in the tower ran around like little wild animals during play time – with the exception of Nathaniel Barton who tended to draw back when the volume grew too loud. How this worried Clint about the little boys ears.  How Pepper liked to spend her Saturday nights catching up on her guilty internet pleasure – youtube game channels.  Loki found himself smiling as he halfway listened to Tony and James argue over what flavor of ice cream was the best, ( they were both wrong – it's birthday cake).  Through all of this, Loki realized that all of these people hadn't once had an unkind word to say to him. They just wanted to help him, and as hard to stomach as that was ...deep down – Loki wanted to be helped.
Aforementioned man had crumbled into a laughing fit when he walked in on Steve covered in spaghetti with two rowdy pups in high chairs declaring to the pups “I can do this all day.”
Clint and Natasha knew something was up, ever since Steve and Tony came out into the open and parted ways things had just felt tense all over the tower.  It was a trickle down effect neither liked, it had the whole pack on edge seeing the two men avoid each other. Well…Steve wasn’t avoiding, the soldier was seeking and his Alpha turning tail at ever approach. Who the hell knew how Stark's mind worked anyway. Still it was hard to watch Steve take each excuse a little harder each time.
“NO! Don’t say you say calm down Jarvis!” Steve shouted, his cheeks flushing as the line deepen between his brows. “Do you have coms linked back to the suit or not.”
The change had a noticeable difference for both of them. Loki had not seemed too burdened or to be "putting on a brave face" nearly as much.
Tony smiled as he pulled the cap from the needle with his teeth and spat it across the way. “Crystal.”
The kiss had changed a lot; it opened up a door that could not be easily shut. Not that either man wanted to close it. Truth be told this was what they both needed, both been looking for even if that truth was one never voiced. It was a silent simmering thing that grew beneath the surface, and perhaps had been for a while now.
"And yet here you are. You must like me an awful lot to risk an arrow to the eye. Clint isn't exactly happy with you after the whole mind slave thing."
"No..Well, Loki it isn't about gifts." Jane was trying her best to be the mature party in this discussion...even if she had slapped the ravenette when he showed up at her door. She had heard him out though, which is more than most people may have.
“I’m sorry what? It sounded like..My ears heard that you wanted, nah  you said you want another baddy right. Since reindeer games is off the evil train, no worries schnookems, I’m sure another evil drama queen from planet Euro-flare will come and ask you to come out and play.”
Tony looks up and sees Barnes glaring at him. “Yeah well you don't look so hot yourself Robocop. Seriously, caught yourself in a mirror lately? Getting some creepy walking dead vibes. Don't make me start a ricktatorship over here.” He joked, his voice seemed to lack its usual easygoing edge though and the words fell flat and gloomy between them.
After Steve put that plane in the pacific, it turned the war around. It inspired a nation to become their own heroes. The more he thought about it the more he realized that’s what they needed again. Even if that patriotism was all marketing and frills it was enough to give them an edge. To give them a cause, after they had that cause they would be ready to fight.
That day had ended in triumph, if bittersweet for all their losses. There would be many more battles on both land and sea. Captain Rogers would hand pick his crew from those he trusted most. Natasha Romanov, deadliest woman on the seven seas. James Buchanan Barnes, sharpest shooter in the world and Steve’s best friend. Samuel Wilson, best navigator and sharpest sailor Steve had the pleasure of ever meeting. It was a small crew at its core, the military gave them others to join their ranks but this group was one he trusted with his life.
He wasn't lying; the GPS put Buck in town at a super center. This was good; she clocked his reactions when speaking, a sort of mental detection for deception. Given the tremble, had gone uncorrected – it happened again when he set the box down. She could surmise that even Loki hadn't noticed it. That was odd given that the once prince always seemed so cautious of his actions.
The silence between the men was thick as the fog rolling in off the New York Harbor in the early morning. Tony’s eyes bore into the older man before him, trying to read between the lines and look for a threat in the old man’s green eyes that had become hazed with age. The only thing Stark could find was concern. Concern and sadness, perhaps a bit of regret that had been left to fester all these years. It wasn’t a threat that this old timer was hinting at, it was a mistake he wanted to correct before it was too late.
Sam laughed to himself, shifting back on his heels arms crossed over his chest. “Yeah, unfortunately they got a bit banged up this last fight. Like a lot of things it seems.”
Beck held up his hands begging and pleading, still to shocked to understand anything other than the fact the room was a mess of debris and now he was standing on the business end of a metal monster.
“Right, let’s blow this pop stand Capsicle.” Tony said, handing Steve a towelette to wipe the gel from his protruding belly.
“We have to stop… we can’t .” Steve would pant, becoming nearly breathless under the gentle affection.
Steve walked down to the workshop to find the windows tinted music blasting some melancholic pop ballad, it made his lips twitch fondly. He didn’t need to see Tony to guess what he must be doing in there. Probably laying on that ratty old sofa with on arm over his eyes and the bots beeping sadly. Dum-E was more than likely beside himself. It was almost comical how Steve could picture it all in his mind by now.
“You decided that- if you recall the one-sided rambling conversation you had when I was half asleep. I know you were born in a hospital Tony and that’s most omegas now.  but that’s just not how things were when I was growing up. I was with my ma when she helped Bucky's mom deliver his little sister Rebecca. That was just how I was raised to believe that one day I’d have my pups at home in the nest that my mate and I  put together.”
It was a quiet joy. Just between the two of them until Loki began to show. Then the rest of the team joined in the congratulations. It was wonderful to feel so complete. To have this little part of each of them take root.
, were not just empty words for neither him nor some flowered sentiment that his mother stitched into pillows.
“Jarvis?” he tried hoping maybe this was something weird Tony was doing, like maybe the inventor accidentally released some deadly glass into the tower and so now everyone was on lock down in these little cubes. That sounded legit - it was disturbing that something like that did sound legit, this was his life now.
The room was deathly quiet and the Winter Soldier looked down to the bleeding captive. He frowned behind his mask and knelt down a hesitant metal hand reaching out to brush the sweaty blond hair out of the Captain’s face. There’s blood across his face and one of his eyes is swollen and blackening. Something about it…
Loki wanted to go out, they'd all been getting a case of cabin fever for the last week and the last thing anyone wanted was a moody God of mischief. So Bruce was elected ...'
Add to that for the last few minuets Dr. Simmons had been standing in his room looking at a stack of paper work and at him as if she was figuring out how to break some terrible news.
“I know.” Like smile and gripped the offered hand. They had discovered that finding a peaceful closed-in spot helped immensely when Loki felt overwhelmed. “Will you...”
“Oh sorry.. I'm still..I don't know adjusting. Bruce said it may take a while with the bond broken and since I just had my heat everything's out of wack at the moment.” Steve awkwardly tried to apologize. That was just like him to try and down play what he was feeling.
“I don’t know…how they would get it in there?” the younger boy asked, bending to look over the long metal implement.
That evening when Peggy went to bed and Angie curled her arms around her, she sighed and pressed her face into the waitress’s hair. “I’m worried for him.”
They both knew that Jarvis was letting her win, but it was still cute. The AI was an excellent big brother and watchful eye where the twins were concerned. Tony just smiled and shared a look with Steve.
Tony snorted and wound his arms around the blonds’ narrow waist. “I didn’t faint I told you that. It was a mandatory restart. Very technical.”
“You have a meeting Mr. Stark.” Her voice is ice cold and he knows that he's in for it but still he smiles and head over to the bar pouring himself a drink.
“That's not her name...” He looked back at Barnes who was trembling in his chair, “Bucky ...tell them.. that, that can be.”
Not that he minded spending time with his boyfriend, it's just that Bruce was a planner type of person. He liked having at lease an idea of were he was going/ After spending years on the run, Bruce had had enough spontaneity. So with a quick google search and few helpful suggestions he had a rough idea of the day.
After she left, James was alone to sort out what had happened while he was on his shopping trip of lies. Loki hadn't said much as they put away foodstuffs and chatted idly about dinner plans. He hadn't wanted to push, only asking in a conversational tone is Loki and Natasha had a nice visit.
“Shut up grandpa you’re the one robbing the cradle. Now up you go Dorito, off to wash. You smell like sex and while I fucking love that, I don’t want anyone else sniffing you up. I‘m a selfish bastard Steven, and I can admit that. ” The alpha returned with a playful swat to the blonde’s backside.
This is why he can't have nice things, Tony wanted to say no, go to voice mail but who was he kidding. There is only so many reason fellow geniuses called him and it was rarely ever anything good.
Pepper slipped off her heels and gracefully took a seat. “I think there’s been some miscommunication. Actually no, I‘m sure there has been if that‘s what you think this is. I do a lot for Tony, but one thing I am not is his messenger. I think you know that Steve.”
The asset looked at the metallic sounding growl. It was the one in the Iron suit,  Tony Stark ..Stark…Mission incomplete?
Tonight for some reason Tony asked his AI to access Steve’s Music.  He found the collection surprisingly modern if a bit tame. Lots of ‘love songs’ and generally easy listening. When Tony first saw it he almost burst into a fit of laughter and how - well to put it plainly, how ‘omega’ it all was.
Tony needed to get out of there. He needed t o be far away where the world still made sense, where he could think and figure what to do with his life.
“Oh I’m sure you did, but now I’m here so off you pop.” She smiled, her red lips doing little to belie the threat in her tone. She was not above slapping this self entitled pig right in the face.
“Absolutely not.” Tony spoke firmly as he had gps information sent to the suit. Stark had volunteered to go in with Coulson's Team as ground support. It just made sense given with what they were dealing with. Extremis was tech based, Tony was the tech person. On another level he felt it had to be him, he had rejected Killian all those years ago and in a way – jilted Hansen. Maybe in some round about way he had facilitated the two of them collaborating, , after all, Killian wanted to upstage Stark industries.
However, morning and its clarity did not come, as it was suppose to, there would be no soft words spoken from an open heart. No end to the self-loathing worn like a heavy cloak. Loki would once again have to push down the pain because the world was falling apart before his eyes.
Tony acted to do this to Steve, knowing how this continued fight with the old adversary from his past constantly wore on Steve. “I get that but there's something you don't seem to get Steve.” He said moving forward, hands up in peace before pressing one of his palms to the omegas muscular abdomen. “This isn't just about hydra or your abilities Steve, there's a lot more at stake.”
Then again, if he had died what kind of after life was this?  Steve did not recall anything in the scriptures his mother used to read him about heaven looking like plain beige room. Nothing about lying on a small bed with simple cotton sheets. No, he was not dead and something was wrong, the radio…the game on the radio was not right.
The reassurance didn't do much to lighten James' mind. Loki wasn't saying much and it worried the alpha greatly to have some unknown storm n the horizon, still he had to wonder if maybe now they wouldn't have to weather it alone. Natasha, Steve, hell even Tony would be there with them. Loki had allowed her in their home and had found some sort of solace with Natasha. That had to stand for something, this had to mean that there was something good to come out of this.
The young woman snorted back a laugh and then quickly composed herself. “No Sir nothing like that, actually… I would like to order one more test to be sure.”
“I'll be back Stark, this is over. “ Furry spoke with finality as he turned his back and stormed back to the convoy of black SUV's clearly Stark couldn't be trusted. Whatever he had gotten into on that mission may have made him a liability and as bad as the monster he was housing.
Tony could tell that Steve's head-space was much younger than usual and he would have to take additional precautions. Taking out the diaper bag he had in the linen closet for 'just-in-case' scenarios like this.
“Sorry Buck seems like two against one, it’s ok lucky for you I have a soft spot for trouble makers.” Steve smiled letting Natasha run up his arm and settle on his shoulder. He held out his hands for the other two, Same perching on his knee and Bucky standing on his hind legs in Steve’s palm demanding attention.
Loki is bedridden for days following the ill-advised heat. Receiving care for his weakened body is one thing but his mind is another, for that there is no easy fix and even with a small victory of the ravenette finally getting up – it isn't hard too see they are in no way out of the woods. Loki moves silently like a ghost, he does not speak unless spoken to and those replies are somber and short at best. The omega dose not bother to hide himself with illusions any longer and anyone can see the suffering as plain as day.
There were two eyes that stared coldly from the darkness. A mouth that spoke nothing but curses and a heart as black as night. “You ruined it all, pitiful little false mer, you were supposed to secure me my throne and instead I am left to rot. And I shall not forget you Loki…you, you have them all fooled as well. You who are just as selfish as I or maybe that milk breathed little runt has made you soft…well I am not soft. I will have my revenge.”
The beta's shoulders dropped a fraction as he moved the kettle off the stove and began to pour the steaming water into a pair of mugs. “ No I don't. He mentioned something about his last visit to the Barnes'. About Loki.”
When he came back up stairs, the omega was already napping lightly in the corner of the low ceiling room. Steve’s scent had mellowed and it made the alpha glow with pride. Tony slipped in and draped the throw over Steve’s exposed back, it was good he was resting now. When the first real heat wave hit it was likely to come on pretty strong.  Until then Tony had to calm himself down and wrap his head around this situation.
“This may not be something we can do.” Bruce said. “other than to help Loki feel accepted and safe. Even then, we have no idea if that would be enough to balance him out or if there are any other additional factors. Trying to give him medications would be a moot point not only due to his metabolism but that because he is another species we can't predict the reaction.”
“That was before.” Howard muttered and snatched the diagrams from her grasp. “I’ll make one and drop it the oceans …kill all those damn monsters one of these days.”
Taking the tea gracefully, Loki added a few spoons of sugar, “James and I have...decided to adopt.”He said, waiting for a moment.“I wanted to speak to you about how one with our special circumstance would undertake it.”
On more than one occasion, Bruce observed Clint looking particularly twitchy around Steve. Barton what the only alpha in the tower with experience with pregnant omegas and it wasn’t hard to tell that the archer was trying hard to stamp down the need to help out in Stark's absence.
, then this wasn't going to be easy. Images permeated his mind – each more gruesome than the last. The older he became the more mortality seemed to rear its head to remind him '
Jarvis had been playing something softer than what Tony was used to. Pepper thought Tony needed to expand his working playlist to something mellower, turns out - the percentage of small fires/ explosions - had gone down since making the switch.
Then again, Loki was a great actor. He could smile in your face and sell you ocean front property in Arizona while interesting a nun in contraception. He was that good. James knew it and maybe he could smell the bullshit from a mile off and just didn’t care. It was easier to put blinders on than analyze anything to close. Loki was fine.
Steve didn’t linger, he didn’t even look up before turning away and muttering a nearly inaudible ‘excuse me’ before leaving the table.
“…don’t you puppy face me Rogers…no..Ahhh damn it. There it is, the eyes and everything.” Tony leaned up and kissed the soldiers pouting lips. “Yeah, I’m so knocking you up again.”
When Professor X prepared to leave the tower that day, he sincerely hoped that Loki would heed his advice.
He reached over passing a hand over the faucet sensor, “Jarvis are you here?”  Steve hoped to god that the AI was on board.
Consider the worst pain you have ever felt and multiply that by a thousand. Even then, you’re still falling short of what even a breath of this was like. This was worse than the shrapnel in his chest, worse than the water boarding, worse than the car battery he had to tote around or die.
“Keep on climbing though the ground might shake; just keep on reaching though the limb might break. We’ve come this far don’t you be scared now…”
Tony stands up walking over to the workbench, picking up a photo of his family. “I'm sorry Buck. Trust me I know how lucky I am. I love Steve and I just wanted to come home. Our bond is broken now and...I didn't even think about that. All I wanted to do was see what else I could do. Sometimes it's still all I want, but I don't. This thing, Extremis, I feel like it's winning and it won't be long until there is nothing left of me.”
Bruce just shook his head and looked down at his own hands a moment. “You know, I asked someone that once. I didn't think I deserved to be helped with all that I had done. OR..rather all I am. But every one needs help Loki. Sometimes its not about what we think we deserve, but being deserving of what we get. I just want to help you because you need help, I hope that you will let me do that.”
He walked down the hallway following the faint light coming from the bedroom; so far, all signs for welcome home fun times seemed good. What he was not expecting to find was an empty bed.  In the center of the comforter sat a little white box.
She sighed and sat down next to her employer and friend, placing a hand on his knee. “The fact that you feel that way says a lot Tony. Nevertheless, you’re still wrong. This isn’t just your choice, if you care about Steve, you will let him decide what’s right for him. I know that’s hard for you but you have to realize that Steve isn’t  that glowing idol of perfection that your Father said he was. Captain America is an idea, we are talking about Steve Rogers. He’s still that 25 year old kid he was 70 years ago and right now he thinks that you don’t want him.”
“Hey, there you are.” Tony next to me, holding my hand. I wouldn’t have picture him to be that type. He always seemed more like the love em and leave em type. Now that I think about though all the times we have slept together its not like he ignored me after. Sure, we didn’t get all cozy like after but he did just disappear.
Hill looked down a moment and then back to the camera, her face not nearly as trained and blank as it had been before. Now there was something else -fear.
The child grabbed Steve's hand and made for the door. "Hold on there Tony, I've already seen your Dad, so we don't have to okay? Actually...he sent me to come and play with you for the day because you're such a good boy." Steve tried to sound positive  but the skeptical look on the little ones face made his heart ache.
“I know a lot of people think he just tries to be difficult but what if its not that,” He paused selecting a pair of teabags from the cupboard. “My mother...some times she was just so quiet, she'd smile and say everything was fine. She lied a lot. Just because people lie, it doesn't mean they are just protecting themselves. Sometimes they do it to protect others.”
This would be his favorite new toy, the former friend of Captain America, bargaining chip and human bomb.
This love was a sick thing with tendrils that sunk into his soul and bled him dry. Her every word was acid on his heart, every longing glance to his brother - another dagger in his back. Yet, still he loved her… still he wanted.
Meanwhile, Tony was left reeling as the alarms blared inside the suit accompanied by his AI's voice,
The alpha shrugged his shoulders and walked out of the hanger and into the small elevator that would lead up to the penthouse, Bruce following close behind. “I did what I had to do. Why are you disappointed?”
"So..Pizza with extra bacon?" Bruce leaned over and placed a kiss between two sculpted black brows. "It will all be okay, no blood wine tonight ok?"
“Heads up!” Tony shouted firing the RT chest bean at the left torrent. The blast took out the massive gun and rocked the building. The second torrent on the far right of the base wall whirled to life and the main gates opened.  The bases jeeps and mobile artillery moved in.
As the group of former military ascended the stairs to the main door, they were in awe of the sheer scale of the place. If Stark wanted to intimidate any visitors he did the job well. Knocking on the massive door, Steve looked back over his shoulder at the others. They had all been quick to shove the good Captain out in front.
Loki looked down at his hands a moment, considering the broken and cracked state of his one pristine nails. “ Indeed, I can understand such a thing. Tell me Steven.  How  do find life as you are now to who you were then?”
Steve leaned against the car and waved, thankful when Barnes lifted the pup off the cat-like animal's back and set her down on the grass. Wendy broke out into a run nearly colliding with his legs in her excitement. Already rattling off about all the fun, she had as her Omega lifted her up to his hip.
Rogers did understand, sometimes there were things you didn’t want help with. Things that were personal. He knew that it wasn’t just macho Alpha bullshit with Tony, at least not about this. “Yeah.”
Every word had Tony-seeing red. He knew he was supposed to tell the team, knew he was supposed to wait… to do very glorious tactical shit that was usually Steve’s job.
An: I'm having feels right now and this happened. I like to think a lot of Steve's character comes from his mother. I find her very interesting, despite the fact that she is seen as a minor character in most fic cases.
Plates of food sitting untouched before him, the effort in their creation meant to hopefully tempt his senses. The result - a hard lump in his throat and pressure in his chest. The warm savory scents making him want to vomit.
Those images made the elder omega seem like a completely different person. An individual so unlike the man in the coal black suit with its pressed seams and thin black tie. The perfectly shined shoes and slicked-back hair.
Steve, admittedly, had second thoughts almost immediately. Having had a crisis of conscious for having touched another man and liked it, old prejudice that refused to go down with out a fight. But there was Tony. All smug smiles telling him it was fine, that things were different now and everyone had ‘experimented’ at least a little. Promised he wouldn’t say a word, they could call it a one off and never speak of it again. One time didn't mean anything right?
Tony also found he enjoyed the pleasant warmth being around Steve brought, it was something he’d always liked in a literal sense - Steve’s body temperature was a lot higher than normal. Now it was more metaphorical, in the last few weeks Tony had also noticed that he could pick up on Steve’s scent much more keenly that before. He didn’t mention it of course, not wanting to make Rogers feel uncomfortable. It was something they had been expecting, Tony did tell Bruce though  who attributed the phenomenon in part to Tony’s Alpha nose and to Steve feeling safe. Less stress- more o-estrogen = higher pheromone production.
Yes...yes because despite his lifelong fears the more he thought about it and the more he talked about it in therapy – Loki grasped the truth. James Barnes loved him, all of him. Despite this struggle James would not leave him, any thought he had to the contrary was his experiences interjecting themselves on his present. His alpha was not at all like those who had harmed him and Loki knew that now.
Steve wanted to melt right there, just die because this man had ruined him. Following Tony into the bedroom, he was forced down on the bed to take part in his second favorite activity with the inventor. Kissing. Tony liked to say Steve was so innocent because he loved to just make-out like a teenager. The real reason was because there was something so beautifully intimate about the act. People could have sex with strangers, but a Kiss...men wrote songs about kisses.
"I'm not actually."Philip said, sitting back and observing the slim man still folded in on himself.  "I should have sat down with you after reading the file, or at least after you and Barnes had settled in. For all one knows if we had cleared the air.."
The billionaires once perfectly shaped facial hair had now over grown leaving the man looking wild. Once perfectly chaotic hair filled with expensive product - now sported a buzz cut. Gone was the joking air and teasing turn of phrase, what was left behind was utilitarian efficiency. Fury got his new soldier, his very own asset. The question was if he still had the reigns in hand.
Natasha smiled and snapped on a set of bracelets and spun her batons. The weapons sparking and glowing to life. “He’s so cute when he’s motivational. All right boys, enough talk lets go. I’m feeling like sushi tonight.”
Howard sat back in his chair , his hands folded over his knee. Looking every bit the dignified gentleman and less like the crazed recluse they all had thought they would find. “I don’t know her name, but I have been to the location where she stole my son. Have any of you heard of sirens?”
“Um...Phil.” Daisy questioned. She knew all to well how easy it was to lose control and let anger and hate take over. While she didn't know much about Loki, aside from the obvious, she respected Barnes enough to not want to see anything happen to his Omega. “As much as we need the help I think our alien wing-man needs to calm the hell down.”
“Jarvis is playing Tic-Tac-Toe with me, and I'm winnin!” She proudly said starting another game on the StarkPad.
Steve couldn’t help but smile at the snarky remark, “Very funny Stark. What are you doing here anyway? I must be dying if you came out of your tech cave to sit with me.”
Such a flawless illusion of leather breeches with gilded gold grommets that laced up the outside of both legs, topped with a forest green tunic of luxurious shining fabric, accented in panels of black and intricate stitching. His once loose waving hair slicked itself back – not a strand out of place. Nails once bitten and dry now glossed in black polish. Let the games begin.
Whatever dealing Alexander had with Gideon, they were not the kind Steve wanted anything to do with. Or any part of the coin that men like that made. The profit from blood wasn’t something he could hold in his hands. Even if his stomach yearned for food and his, body weak from sickness. He’d find another way to make it, a better way, and an honest way.
The brunette scientist can only laugh and smilingly shake her head. “Yeah, I figured that by the thunder and lightning in the middle of a sunny day. Oh, or by how the complex shook uncontrollably when you landed on the roof.”
As for Tony, he was completely in love with his new son and daughter. The inventor honestly couldn’t put into words how it felt to hold his baby girl and cut the cord tethering her to her bearer, and moments later - do the same for his son.
Steve cannot be certain of what he's hearing, then again – he would have never believed in an underwater world of merpeople either. If Howard Stark's beloved son was still alive perhaps, the old inventor would give up his genocidal plans. Granted, kidnapping isn't a significant step up from homicide but it is a step-up.
Meanwhile, Steve sat on  the nearby sofa  with their daughter. The little girl was going over the great time she had with her aunt’s Natasha and Pepper, and how she got to feel the baby in Auntie Peppers belly.
“Jello babe..the word is jello.” he smiled and gently helped the omega to his feet. “Come on honey lets get you to bed”
Coming home to find Bruce and Pepper working on a baby book in bed was adorable. Who knew Bruce Banner's hobbies also included scrap booking. 'It's calming' was the excuse, not that they asked for one.
Bruce scrubbed his palms over his face. This was absolute insanity. “I can’t stand by and watch you destroy everything including yourself.”
“You don't have to be gentle with me Kurt.” Loki said, he had some idea what Kurt might tell him. The last time they spoke the other man had confided that he and his alpha were considering a family.
Steve really didn’t want to go but Tony had a point. He felt gross and was pretty sure he had a little spit up in his hair. “Fine, but just… he’s sleeping but he tends to wake up every now and then and..”
“Very well, he will make good leverage for the avengers. They would not dare move thinking their beloved Captain is in danger. Take him to the rendezvous  point.” With that, Skull stepped into a hidden elevator and disappeared.
“No… I…I didn’t but…” his jaw clenched. They were trying to trick him.  “I told you!” The blast shot out in a brilliant red beam.
Sudden realization flitted over the soldier's features. “But we just... I mean...it can't be that dangerous when we don't even know.” he spoke, voice quivering just slightly trying to convince himself.
“Papa told me to and I did!” Wendy simpered in her seat. “But now I gotta go again!” She pouted and squirmed. “Pleeeeaaaseeee”
Putting the kids down with the order to 'play nice', Steve headed into the kitchen. Bucky set a freshly microwaved plate down on the table, obviously something can't be forgotten. Steve smiled thinking back to all the times that his younger self had been forced to eat even when he was almost sure Bucky did without. “Thanks Buck”
“Yeah I am, although there is one thing.” Tony says, taking a serious note. “Do you want this? You don’t have to ya know. Things are different now and I would never force or guilt trips you, it’s your body and your choice.”
Tony.. where was Tony. Had they hurt him? Was he hear somewhere? Where they doing the same thing to him?
James didn't want to push because when you push Loki he just pulls farther away. He still remembers the nightmares the omega used to have back in Asgard, how Loki never wanted to be followed or coddled. Eventually, Loki would come to him and just take what he needed. Even if he wasn't really taking because James was fully offering his comfort. Not to mention, when they first bonded and returned to earth. The way the omega was about as pleasant as a wet cat for weeks. He always came around though.
By now, Steve had joined them, “Bruce I’ll do it… I can’t just sit back and …be put out of commission indefinitely. If it’s the only plan we have I think it’s worth consideration.”
Maybe Loki was right, he was a monster. He wasn't the man that Steve loved Tony doesn't even knows who he is anymore. This wasn't an improvement or an upgrade. It was a curse, One he had chosen so foolishly with out even thinking about the repercussions.
“Thanks Buck, I would ‘a eaten a bite before I left but...” Steve trailed off mindful of the little ears so close.
“I hear there are congratulations in order? Is Stark out buying a cigar factory?” Phil said with a smile, setting down a bag at the foot of Steve’s bed. . As much as Pepper was the “mother over SI,” Phil was much the same over any and all agents of Shield, thus extending to the Avengers themselves.
“You’re a life saver Jarvis, thank you that would be great.” Steve smiled pouring himself some juice and heading into the seating area. “Can you bring up the news coverage by the way on wherever the team is? I’d like to see how their doing.”
“Looks like he’s four floors above you and not moving, he may have found something.” Coulson came back on the line.
Tony had never actually done laundry before, he had people for that. Therefore, this whole non-tech, non-spoiled vacation that Steve had insisted on was becoming a horrible nightmare.
Steve had been out on his morning run when he first noticed it. He had worked up more of a sweat than usual, and just felt a little nauseous. This was odd because normally he could push him self much farther before feeling the ache and burn of fatigue. Steve chewed on his bottom lip as he walked out of the park hands at his hips trying to regulate his breathing.
“I’m sorry about …that.” He said gesturing to the boxes. “I just know I can’t really go out right now and I didn’t want you to have to go out and get them for me at all hours.”
Big brown eyes sparkled as they focused on blue. " I know you!!! My Daddy told me! we see'd you ! You're Cap'n America!!"  little Tony clapped his hands and ran to him clamoring and chatting animatedly about how much his daddy had told him about the great Captain America. "Daddy be so happy! He been lookin for you! Come on we gonna find him and then I'll be a good boy!"
Perhaps it was presumptuous to think of things like that. Yet it was hard not to, Steve never though he would ever have children, or even a mate. There was a time the omega never thought he would even make it to the New Year. Now he was here in the future, healthy and happy. Surrounded by a pack or amazing people with a mate who was both wonderful and exasperating at times, and had two little pups.
James was so tender, never once did Loki feel fearful of being taken  while so unwilling of heart. Even when the heat was nearly unbearable. His alpha held him and kissed him, soothed the ache with his fingers and toys, easing him through until the pain subsided and melted into something better.  Always with words of praise on his mortals lips, telling him how he was loved. Loki looked up into those cool clear eyes of his lover, his alpha, and trusted this man with everything.
Something changed between them after that, an odd sort of friendship of equal parts mutual respect and curiosity. Over the next two years, they saw each other frequently even when not on avenger business. Just two friends talking or going out to see movies, Steve loved seeing the films he had missed while in the ice and Tony loved being the one to show them to him.
Fashion, music, cinema- Loki found it easy enough to assimilate with the culture. Then again he had always been like when traversing the realms. He liked to fully amerce himself in a new world and  all of its life.
“Why papa, would you go alone from me?” Tony sniffled and wound his tiny fingers into his father’s long dark hair.
Tony smiled tugging at Buckys belt, “Could be having more fun spangles. That is if you can pull yourself away from your little art project.”
Therefore, Steve can understand why Bucky feels the weight of what happened, he had gone in that building after a target and had no idea until he entered that the guy had rigged the whole structure to blow. There was no way Bucky could have gotten out fast enough, then Tony blasted through a wall and grabbed him by the collar, Tony who was on one remaining boot thruster who knew there was no way he'd be able to carry Barnes out of there. Iron man had grabbed him by the collar and tossed Bucky out, Thor had caught the falling solider just as the building exploded.
'. Yeah, because that's what the old man always did, hell that's what Steve did. Maybe it was just that generation's uncanny ability to just walk it off no matter the trouble. Sure, Tony liked to think he was made of tougher stuff. He'd been abducted, tortured and nearly killed dozens of times and still managed to keep on keepin on. The thing was Tony wasn't a lightweight, you could throw anything at him physically and he'd just get up and throw some dirt on the blood, coming back every time with some smart-assed remark on the tip of his tongue. Any given Sunday he would have stepped right up and took on an alien invasion, megalomaniac tyrant, terrorist organization, monsters and any combination. Hell, throw in a sharknando for funzies! (Damn Barton to hell for getting him hooked on those awful movies).
Didn’t that just tear out their hearts? Steve folded and pulled one of the pillows away to cover himself with to slip out of the bed while Tony kept Peter occupied. The pair cuddled and Tony held Peter above the blanket, though the little boy didn’t understand why he couldn’t get in the bed. Thankfully, Peter didn’t press the issue more did he go looking for Steve and was happy enough to lie down and curl up on Tony’s chest.
Loki had never really had 'friends' and spending some free time with Pepper and Steve made him feel apart of something he never felt before. There was once a time when the omega turned his royal nose up at the idea at standing around gossiping like a group of old maids. There was once a time when the omega twisted his royal nose up at the idea at standing around gossiping like a group of old maids. Yet, Frigga had never been that way, he fondly remembered the group of omega that she surrounded herself with, ones that would enter her private gardens and speak freely as if she was not the queen. There was something so free about her gentle face when she was around them.
When he entered the first thing Steve noticed was his music was playing, the omega blushed. Maybe Tony was going to laugh at the selection. However, that didn’t seem right now that Steve looked around.
“Oh sweetie no! You can have all the chips you want! I will buy that company and keep it in business for the next millennia if that’s what you want. I will literally do any fucking thing right now if you will stop crying.”  Tony felt ridiculous kneeling in front of the toilet trying to calm down a soppy super solider with his pants around his ankles.
"It is not your fault Agent." Loki said noting the look on the other mans face for using the title. "Philip." he amended. "I am not a helpless child and admit it would have been better for me to reach out to those whom I have wronged rather than knowingly allow those wounds to fester."
Steve moved to take Tony’s face in his hands. “No, don’t you ever say that Tony. You are not your father, things happened but that doesn’t mean that they have to stay that way. You’re a fighter babe, our son is just like you and I love you both. Whatever Peter needs we will face that ok?”
“I’ll have you know I have mellowed out a lot. Plus I was kind of planning to ask you bunch of losers to come join the party on a permanent basis anyway. I mean having Bruce there is a bonus, and Thunderella crashes there on occasion. I always did like frat parties, we can all wear togas on Friday nights, eat pizza and get shit faced. First one unconscious gets dicks drawn on their face.”
Tony would burst into hysterical laughter if this was so bad. So instead he just tried to get himself together enough to be of use because it was sounding more and more like he was going to be suiting up soon. If you want something done right you have to do it yourself. “So what do we know.” His voice echoing in the bathroom as he stepped out in search of pants.
