“What the hell was that for?” Tony shrieked as the meat bounced harmlessly off the chain-link fence.
Curiosity ruled out reason as he cautiously approached  the hanging message. Written on the page, in large mocking letters were four letters.
Tony tried to come up with some excuse. Something to tell them that they were crazy or just letting their imaginations run wild in his absence. But he couldn’t. Tony couldn’t say it because some small part of him knew it was true. Some small part of him wished beyond a doubt that it was true. “We’re not like that,” he murmured quietly
“You, Tony Stark, are a beautiful paradox. You call me out on my shortcomings and get on my every nerve. You’re infuriating, endlessly frustrating, and yet I can’t help falling more and more in love with you every day.
“That’ll have to do for now,” said Steve, tying the cloth as tight as possible without causing Tony any excessive injury. “We need to get you to a hospital.”
Sam pushed his shoulders back to stand at his full height as he made his way into Steve’s space. “Someone else who stronger than me? Someone more capable than me?” Sam’s sharp brown eyes bore into his.
Bucky chuckled, but it did little to relieve the nervous tension in the air. “Yeah, that’s… That sounds like our Stevie all right.”
Steve raised a concerned eyebrow. “Are explosions are regular thing for you?” he asked, feeling something between concern and an unfounded endearment.
If you have any speculations or questions, please comment. I need to know if I need to drop more hints.
“Well,” said Bruce running a hand through his hair. “I guess that solves our problem about how to get Tony back to the past.”
"You already asked me that Steve.” Tony replied as casually as if Steve had asked him about the weather.
If Victor Von Doom talked well into the night as was egotistically standard of him, the next time he and Obie could ‘discuss’ shutting down productions would be tomorrow. But tomorrow and for the next week, Obie had meetings out of the country with the Germans, Italians, and the Japanese for some reason. And unless some sort of surprise happened, the company would keep trucking away like normal and those bastards would keep getting their illegal arms like normal. Things needed to change and they needed to change fast.
“Okay, new plan,” said Steve as he thought aloud. “Tony, you stay here. I’ll look for him. Rhodey, tell Bruce to come back here and check to make sure Tony is okay. I’m still a bit worried about him.”
As Steve passed through the door, he gasped taking in the rich splendor of the lobby. The inside was just as eye catching as the outside. Spotless ivory and gold tile floors made the glowing columns rising along the walls, framing the room, looking absolutely magnificent. The ding of bronze elevators and people making small talk around rising streams of white smoke was a strange static that just added to the atmosphere.
“You got it doc.” Tony gave a salute to his hired muscle as he descended back down to the basement to continue his interrogation.
As he waited precious seconds for the elevator to open, Stane tried desperately with honey coated lines to make Tony reconsider. “Tony, let’s talk it out. You don’t want to make any rash decisions.”
Tony shrugged nonchalantly. “It happens. A lot more often than you would think, but it happens. I try not to make a big deal out of it.”
Tony shrugged in ambivalence and turned his back on the conversation. “Doesn’t matter. I’m not going to see him after tonight.”
The smile disappeared from Steve’s face. “Oh, sorry. I just thought you’d like some company. I didn’t mean to get in your way.”
But eventually, they conceded. “Fine,” groaned Rhodey. “I’ll do it. But only if you can get Iron Man to agree.”
Tony nodded. “Positive. I know we get yelled at for a lot of things in life, but this shouldn’t be one of them. You shouldn't be punished for loving something. Or, someone.”
Tony blushed. “You don’t have to, you know. I’m the only one that has to say ‘yes’ when you offer the ring.”
The room was phenomenal. Multiple workstation for various types of projects were scattered about the open floor. Red metal chests stood by each station like tin soldiers, most likely filled with odds and ends that would assist in projects related to whatever station they stood guard over. With a quick look, Tony could guess exactly what stations were designated for what part of his work. A station for welding. A station for drafting. A station for wood and metal prototypes. A station for testing said prototypes. A very large station dedicated just to ammunition. (Obie was being in no way subtly about the potential weapons contract.) A station dedicated to automotive parts. And small icebox and kitchen equipped with late night necessities such as a coffee maker and blender. Tony couldn't wait to fuck it all up.
When Tony’s attacker finally slumped to the ground and didn’t try to get up, Steve whirled to face him. “Can you run?” he wheezed. His lips were cracked and his face was flushed. Spatters of blood decorated his face like bright red freckles.
Tony expected his boyfriend to do something with his chest, but Steve had other ideas. Steve encircled Tony’s nipples, giving them a quick flick for good luck. Then he walked his fingers down through Tony’s happy trail and over the silk bed sheet still trapping Tony’s legs in place. Steve caressed the root of Tony’s cock through the fabric, but he didn’t stay there for long. His fingers fluttered down to Tony’s balls and, without a word or warning, gave them quick, light twist. Arousal raced up Tony’s spine. He arched up like a cat and let out a needy moan that echoed through the entire beach house.
“Bucky, I know you’re trying to help, but I really think you should go,” Tony said through the forest of fur.
Hurt. They had been hurt bad. The limping. The blood. The missing of limbs. The shadows of the past still haunted his dreams no matter how many sleeping pills he took. Next time, it would be worse. He couldn’t do anything about it now. All he could do was prepare for the next time.
“What? I can’t take the initiative once in a while?” Honestly, Tony would rather have calm Bruce dealing with it (make a good impression) than strict Pepper. He didn’t want Steve at the wrong end of a barrel if things went belly side up for some reason.
“Good. Get to work!” Iron Man waltzed out of the storefront in a whirl of brown trench coat and red suit.
“No I’m not,” moaned Tony, flopping down onto his side. “I’m just standing around looking at your fine ass.
“Shut up, you big idiot,” Steve said, pushing that stupid look out of his sight. “I’m being emotional and you’re just stilling here cracking jokes. What kind of boyfriend are you?”
Tony let out a nervous breath as he closed the box and handed it back to his daughter. This was it. Today was the day. And they were going to do it together.
“Well, I don’t know,” Steve drew out the slow contemplative words like saltwater taffy. Tony almost doubled over with laughter. Steve looked like he was really considering the possibilities of other prohibition providers. Face all scrunched up, looking a little green in the gills.
Steve waited a moment before indulging in his. The first drink, it was his favorite part in making giggle juice
As Steve made his way to the back of the quinjet, he tried to focus on finding the younger Tony and not dwell on Colonel Rhodes’ behavior. Rhodey was Tony’s friend. His oldest friend. It wasn’t surprising he’d be protective of Tony. Given Steve’s behavior over the Accords, his recent reconciliation with the Avengers, and the latest development in Steve and Tony’s relationship (them now dating), Steve expected a few extra shovel talks in the future. There were only a few people Tony trusted and despite being his boyfriend, Steve didn’t think he ranked up very high on that list anymore.
Did he see? Did he notice? There was no way he could have. Even Tony was a wasn’t sure if it actually happened. Unless it did. Steve wasn’t the most subtle person in the world. With that sun kissed hair, and that gorgeous shoulder to waist ratio. God, artists would have a field day over his David like figure. And his smile with those sea blue eyes, Steve could make any person melt into a pile of goo.
Dammit all. It was like talking to a brick wall and expecting it to respond with something intelligent and groundbreaking. “How many times do I need to repeat myself, the arm isn’t fucking ready! I did not design that arm to be used as a weapon. And that’s what R&D’s unapproved modifications made it into, a weapon. It’s supposed to be a fucking prosthetic! Its purpose is to help people, not strangle the life out of them.”
Jan’s mouth dropped in in disbelief. “Are you joking? How can you be so blind?” she squawked. “The guy you were eyeing up when you passed out donuts, the guy who couldn’t say more than three words to you without tripping over his own feet; the
Steve snorted. He buried his head in Tony’s chest and tried not to show how worried he truly was. End of the word. Only Tony could casually joke about something like that.
At that exact moment, because the universe hated Tony with a passion, a sleepy yawn came from the other side of the plane. Tony’s eyes went right to the child as he stretched across the long seat like a cat.
Tony snorted. “Pepper says it’s a mess. Still better than my lab back in Boston, but getting there. I’m just two or three explosions away from really making it mine.”
Tony wanted to be relieved at the news, but he was worried about Steve. If Clint spilled about the incident (even by accident) Steve would be the one in trouble, not Tony. Because of his position and money, Tony would only have to worry about a few unsavory rumors passing between party tables and business would continue as usual. However, Steve was a working man. If Steve’s employers, present or future, ever found out it would be goodbye employment and goodbye social standing.
The loud noise was beginning to mute his hearing. “Why the hell would they follow a man like Schmidt?”
“Let’s not think about it now, husband-to-be of mine,” Steve said, sneaking his arms around Tony’s waist. “We’re still on vacation and the ‘no tech’ rule is still in effect. Let’s just relax and enjoy our first night as fiancés. It’s only going to get crazier from here.”
“Jerk,” replied Bucky knocking their heads together. “Now, what’s say we get this food to people who need it before the bread gets any staler. Or, we can find some Hydra scum to knock around. You always feel better after that.”
Like clockwork, the light above the warehouse entrance went out without a sound. No shattering of glass, meaning the lightbulb would be returned to its spot at the end of the heist. Couldn’t be doing stupid things to arouse suspicion this late in the game. In the emptiness, they heard the familiar metallic clicks of a lock pick as it worked the tumblers. It felt like the process took hours, but they were more than willing to move when the familiar opening click and squeak of the door gave them notice.  Natasha gave the signal, a normally ignorable pattern of rocks falling to the ground, signaling them to proceeded as planned. With no time to waste, the Brooklyn Boys moved fast out of the shadows and up against the cold brick side of Warehouse Sixteen.
Steve turned around and looked around at his crew. Sam and Thor stood a few feet behind him ready for orders, but Steve didn’t have any orders to give. Bucky’s well-being was the only thing he could think about. Steve couldn’t do anything until he knew his best friend was safe.
Ms. Potts sighed as the girl rushed down the elevator. “She’s getting married in a month. Tony told me to fire her, but she needs to money to help pay for the wedding. She’s an idiot, but mostly harmless in the big picture,” she explained as if she was trying to convince herself that it was the right thing to do.
Steve had no time to worry about Sam. With grenades, it was every man for himself. He clawed his way up from the ground and into a run. His heart beat loudly in his ears as he tried to get as much distance as he could. Steve felt the ground shake before he heard the exposition. Ducking for the nearest cover, Steve protected his head with his arms as brick remnants and dust rained down on him. His entire body rattled from the expanding force as the cobblestone underneath absorbed and dispersed the shockwave of pressure out from the epicenter.
“Fuck, Steve!” Tony screamed as he came. Every nerve in his body burned as Tony’s orgasm turned his vision white. He dug his fingers into Steve’s scalp as he fucked thick, hot come down Steve’s throat. Steve hummed in satisfaction as he licked up every drop.
“Oh my god. What’s mini me doing up this early?” groaned Tony. He tried to wriggle closer to Steve. His once relaxed eyes were squeezed shut as Tony tried hold onto the last remains of a lazy morning.
Tony frowned. “Lucky shot,” he mumbled, leaning over to check the body. Still alive, but he’d be out for a good few minutes.
“Hey, kid,” said Steve. He walked back over to the other side of the plane and ran a calming hand through the wild mess of brown hair. “Did you sleep well?”
“You made me breakfast in bed.” Tony had forgotten all about the source of delicious smells. Granted, Steve’s blowjobs made it easy to forget about everything.
“Bucky, honey, this is Tony Stark. Tony, this is my husband, Bucky Barnes. He and Steve grew up together. They’ve known each other since they were puppies.”
“My place,” ordered Steve. “We are going to celebrate your accomplishment like normal people and you are going to enjoy it.”
Steve gripped Tony’s arm hard enough that he could feel it through the metal suit. “Tony.” Steve’s breath came out slow and heavy. Clearly trying hard to keep his cool Steve whispered, “If you go out there, you’re a walking target. There is no smoke like when they came in. There ‘s no hiding. There is only you getting your ass blasted to smithereens.”
Stane pulled up a seat next to him. He ran a caring hand across Tony’s back. It was warm, and it felt so familiar. “Tony, I know you’ve got something cooking in that brain of yours, but you gotta tell me what’s going on. I can’t help you if you keep me out like this.”
“You weren’t there!” Tony screamed as bloody memories flashed in his mind. “You weren’t there when they burned those innocent kids to get to me. You’re weren’t there to choke on the smell of smoke and blood as their screams of pain became my nightmares. You weren’t there to dig out the mangled bodies of kids that had their whole fucking life in front of them, and hand over the remains to their parents as they cried on their porch step.”
“I’m going to talk to Steve,” he said, voice quiet but confident. “I’m going to clear up this whole fucking mess, and then we’re going to go home as a family and get ourselves rip roaring drunk.”
“Consider me a concerned party,” the man replied. If he had a cane, odds are he would twirl it with a relaxed ease. “Who I am and who I’m affiliated with doesn’t matter. However, I will offer this piece of advice, free of charge.” His face darkened and his posture became taught. “Stay away from that man Steve Rogers. Nothing good will come associating with that type of person.”
Tony offered a small smile. “It ain’t much,” admitted Tony, pushing his shoulders back. Steve felt a glow begin in his stomach as Tony slowly regained his confidence. “Working in the dirt, you can only do so much.” He pointed to a section near the center of the image.
“I don’t have a choice,” Tony whispered furiously as he pushed aside Steve’s hand. “It’s my name on the line, my design, my fault. I’m not going to sit here and watch while some lunatic burns down Manhattan.”
Feedback is good. Yes, I am writing this for myself, but it's always nice to know that someone else enjoyed my work.
“Wait, wait, slow down.” Sam grabbed Steve’s agitated body. He pressed down into Steve’s shoulders, centring him in the moment. Patiently, Sam waited for the shaking to subside before asking his question. As Steve slowly adjusted to breathing at regular intervals, Sam asked, in a low and comforting tone, “What happened up there?”
Tony was sleeping peacefully on his side. His right cheek mashed into the pillow. A few stray strands, mostly brown but a few going gray, draped across his eyes like a curtain. Slim fingers were tucked under Tony’s chin as if he was holding something precious to his heart. His naturally tanned chest moved up and down with each breath he took, giving life to a maze of scars that should have killed him long ago. Tony’s mouth, open ever so slightly as breath after life giving breath passed between his lips.
Happy was already out of the vehicle, rope in hand and ready to go. “On it boss. Rescue is coming around with Hawkeye’s car any minute now. We’ll stash him in the back until we get back to the base.”
“Do you how many times I’ve sent out requests only to have them ‘lost’ in the disorganized mess you call the hierarchy?” she asked, clearly not noticing Tony’s disinterest in the topic. “I swear, we kill more trees because of mis-filings than anything else. Do you realize how much work we could get done if we just eliminated the paperwork part altogether?”
“Hey. Hey! Knock it off you two” Rhodey said, stepping in between the two men like a teacher breaking a fight between his students. “You’re scaring the kid again.”
“No, I don’t. And I imagine,” said Tony, whispering sweet words into Steve’s ear, “you’d really like to get a few whacks in as payback.”
"Any hunches you can give me Falcon? Origin? Name?" asked Steve, trying his best to hide his worrying.
Steve, to his credit, only closed his eyes and let out a tired sigh. “Still royally pissed at all this, but maybe eventually.” Steve plopped his big head in the side of Tony’s neck. “I’m just glad you’re safe,” he mumbled into the mix of warm flesh and metal, lips grazing dangerously against the surface.
Steve let out a sigh of relief. As much as hated breaking the rules set by the government, in this case the rules were wrong. The way the government was regulating alcohol wasn't leading to reform. If anything, it had lead to the exact opposite. Current legalization led to people sneaking out to dangerous and unsavory that had once been beautiful, safe, legal locations. Speakeasy ran the risk of being shut down for running an operation that had been legal not ten years ago. Of course people might say the roaring twenties was neither here nor there, but some freedoms once tasted were hard to forget.
“No, like,” the words caught in his throat again. Steve tried to work around it, beat around the bush if possible. He didn’t want to admit it, didn’t want to say it. If he said it, then it would become true. And if it was true, then… Steve couldn’t stand to imagine what that could mean.
“I won’t let you get in my way. I won’t let you hold Tony against his will,” growled Steve, stopping inches away from Iron Man’s unmoving form. “I’ll make you pay for everything you’ve done.” Steve shoved the blade of the shovel under Iron Man’s chin, digging the tip into the weak joints along the throat. “First, I’ll beat your head into a pulp. Then, I’ll take Tony someplace where you’ll never find him.”
Directing his attention back to the fight, Tony noticed that Hawkeye’s smoke was slowly clearing. In the back of his mind, he noted that Schmidt and his crew were piling into a getaway car like a clown trope. But that didn’t concern him at the moment. What concerned him was Steve’s wellbeing.
“But you do poop, right?” Tony asked as he leaned over and whispered into Steve’s ear. “If you didn’t, what would happen to all that food you eat?”
He was close now. Steve was so tantalizing close. Their bodies were flush against each other like two pieces of a puzzle. The sound of music, laughing, and a harsh reality had faded into the background until it was nothing more than white noise. Every doubt, every logical thought disappeared from his head until all Tony could focus on, all he could feel, was Steve. Steve’s strong arms. Steve’s strong hands. His dark eyes surrounded by long, beautiful golden lashes that any girl would be jealous of. All Tony need now was to feel Steve on his lips.
“It isn’t that bad,” Tony insisted as Steve wrapped the cloth around his blood soaked shoulder. Tony was referring to his own injury. “Been through worse. I think the bullet’s still in there.”
A high pitched ring pierced his ears as he slowly shook himself back into reality. Steve tried to stand, but his entire body trembled like a fall leaf. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the guys come over to help him up; mouths moving a mile a minute, faces covered in worry. Steve to shake out the empty screams in his head, but he wasn’t able to make out a word beyond the deafening white noise. He tried to ignore the pain, but it was no good. Steve’s body refused to move any faster than required.
“I- I-,” Tony tried to object, come up with a single reason why his fantasy couldn’t become a reality. But no matter how he tried, every excuse evaporated into nothing as Steve leaned toward him.
The were gasped. He reared back and let out an earsplitting howl. Tony stumbled back and fell over, covering his ears as the painful sound went right through him.
This ‘Schmidt’ guy walked into the warehouse, nose tilted up so high with arrogance that Tony could’ve mistaken him for a pig. Oh, yeah. he was going to have too much fun ripping these guys a new one.
“And what exactly is that supposed to mean?” asked Tony. “Are you saying you want me to act like that for the rest of our lives? Sorry to crush your dreams Cap, but that’s no happening.”
As the shadows of the ending day grew longer and cool wind began to nip at Tony’s skin, Steve walked out of the water. There was a snorkel and mask on his head, a few fish hanging off his stick, and a big smile on his face.
“As if you’re loud ass could sneak up on me, let alone land a hit," he said, sauntering in like he owned the place.
“I’m sure,” said Steve, looking around for any sign of what direction they were supposed to head next. “Tony said they should be here.”
"What is the point then?” Sam asked with a taunting shrug. “Going in pairs so we don't get surprise mauled?"
“But you have to admit,” Tony replied with a suggestive waggle of his eyebrows, “It’s a very nice ass.”
“You’re incorrigible Tony, though I doubt you even know that it means,” she responded, not bothering to move away from his approach.
“And you’re sure the guy is going to show, right?” asked Sam, poking the cold ashes in the ashtray. Whoever had smoked was clearly long gone. “Because I heard Stark Industries is offering factory work if this doesn’t work out.”
“To be fair,” defended Tony, running a gentle hand down Steve’s back. “I have every right to be mad since you’re stealing my stuff.”
As he passed Clint on the way out, Phil reached into his jacket pocket for something. “Thank you for the conversation Mr. Barton. Here’s my card. Call if you ever need anything,” Phil handed it over with a wink, before closing what was left of the building door behind him.
The captain looked down at his shoes attempting to hide his grin. “I mean, if it’s not too much trouble, that’d be really swell.”
“Don’t worry,” Tony said, forgetting the legates of disturbing an unreported wreak. “I’ll get you out of there.”
“No!” Steve yelled, jumping at the force of his own voice. He pulled back, realizing that it was too much force and not enough explanation. He cleared his throat. “No, but I thought you were trying to keep your nose clean.” Ex-Russian spy, poking around in places where she shouldn’t, not always a good thing if the feds stopped by to pay a visit.
Bucky wasn’t as convinced. He did one more scan of the docks before ducking back down to join the group. “I don’t know about this,” worry and shadows cast deep lines in his face.
Tony’s mind immediately shifted to thoughts about what to do next. He needed to tell someone about this. Port authorities legally needed to know about the wreck, but they’d ask too many questions. He could tell the Avengers or SHIELD if he was desperate. Didn’t matter who found him. Just so long as someone other than Tony knew that Captain America’s remains had been found. His family and friends had a right to know what had happened. More importantly, Tony needed someone else to know for his own state of mind. Yes, he had to protect his secrets, but he couldn’t stand the thought of leaving an American hero like Captain America trapped in the ice. It just wasn’t right.
“Did he say anything else?” asked Tony, desperate for any other insight the were could provide. “Anything else that proves he’s remembering how to be human?”
The wolf turned around and saw Tony on the other side of the tall, metal fence. He howled and ran at the gate, crashing headfirst into the sturdy metal. Peter jumped back. He was young. Stuff like this was still new to him. Tony, on the other hand, had seen his fair share of feral creatures and knew his limits.
“Yeah, no. You’re right. It’s fine. Everything’s fine,” Tony said, trying not to let the unwelcome surprise ruffle his feathers. He hadn’t planned on introducing Fluffy to other weres for at least a few weeks. Then again, if his failure with online dating was any indicator, life rarely gave him what he wanted.
Abruptly, Thor stiffened and stopped. “Did you hear that?” he whispered, holding out a hand to stop the others from their work.
He heard a disgruntled grunt from inside and felt the anxiety fall off his shoulders. With knowing fingers, he reached behind the helmet and popped off the grey mask.
Schmidt bellowed on. “England, France, and America are to blame for our misfortune! They punish us for the sins of our fathers. They punish us by taking our wares, giving us less than our due credit. They force us into work that is unfitting for men of any nation. They are the source of our economic crisis! And what do we do? We blame the banks when the real blame is larger than that. The blame is on them! On England! On France! On America! But when we look to the countries, to the nation, to the leaders of our nation, they blame us! Make our brothers and sisters in the home country carry crates of money just to pay for the necessities of life.”
Clint rolled his eyes. “I can’t know everything. That’s Phil’s job. Ever since you put me and Rhodes in charge of opening up the new store, and Pepper’s settled me with babysitting your ass because you do stupid things when left to your own devices, my snooping time had dwindled down to zip. Gotta have someone else fill in the blanks every once in awhile. ”
But Steve wasn’t fazed. He looked at Tony’s dick and then locked eyes with Tony. In the depths of those lust blown eyes, Tony saw something more than the hunger of arousal. There was adoration in the deep blue of his eyes. An endless supply of love. Steve look past all Tony’s doubts and just saw him as he was. Steve looked at Tony, and Tony fell in love all over again.
“Catholic,” Steve replied with a cautious breath. “Irish Catholic.” His eyes darted across the stranger’s face, looking for some clue. The reaction Steve was used to was usually instantaneous. But so far, no sign of the usual disgust. “Do you-”
Steve’s eyes drifted over to the goon laying on the floor. The man was beaten up and bewildered, but he didn’t look the least bit sorry for what he had done.
“Don’t be,” said Steve. There was a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth. “I fell in love with your heart. Not a program. It’s just going to take a bit for us to relearn each other. That’s all. You guys are similar like that. Your brains, your humor, your heart, none of that has changed.”
“Better than how we’ve been doing lately,” bemoaned Steve, looking down at the processed meat as if it had answer.
Steve’s eyes drifted to the man on the floor. The dark red splotches on his face were already fading into a dark purple. Steve closed his eyes and took a few calming breaths. As useless as he felt about Bucky’s situation, Steve knew Tony was right. No point in trying to get information like this. “Yeah,” he muttered under his breath. “Let’s go.”
Steve expected the net to start snapping a line at a time as Tony’s magic worked. That wasn’t what happened at all. One minute, there was a net wrapped around the main mast and over half of the ship. The next, it was gone. It disintegrated like dust in the wind, no trace of it to be seen.
How could anyone not be amazed by this? Steve might find it a little unnerving on some level, sure, but the applications of his magic alone—
Steve nodded immediately in agreement. “I’m not a fan of pain myself. Are you confident you can figure it out?”
“You’re better looking than a golem, so I’m going with not-golem in your case. I mean, have you seen a golem? Rocky jumble of pieces with moss on them, makes lots of grinding noises, weird. Just weird. Anyway. I got sidetracked, where was I?”
Steve got smiles and nods of hellos, curious looks from the people that he passed by. He smiled and nodded back, and it was nice. Being able to do that without someone taking a second look, as if he were familiar. The papers had liked to splash his picture because he was photographic and one of the few super-soldiers that made a difference in the war. And while in the war, it hadn’t really mattered if they’d written up articles on him. Steve had been focused on keeping people safe and defeating his enemies.
Steve ran this all through his head. He definitely checked the first box, as he was free and clear of the army. He wasn’t even dating someone right now. Whether he had the strength and talents remained to be seen. He didn’t know enough of Tony Stark to make that judgement yet. That third clause, though, that was the kicker. Steve did like to be committed to a cause, or at least dedicated to something he could believe in. Tony’s magic had somehow picked up on that? From across the continent? But why link Tony and Steve? Just who
It did bring up a little issue for Tony, though. He’d been so focused on the problem yesterday that he hadn’t properly
“I need to get on board ship,” Tony answered, his eyes already on the problem. “If the net’s tangled around the mast, that’s where I need to cut it free. Steve, once I start the incantation, I can’t pause. I can’t be disrupted. Bad things tend to happen.”
Everyone else had scrambled for whatever safety they could find, most hiding in the cabin. They yelled back affirmatives.
“Ready?” Tony faced the net and the thrashing whale and his question was loud enough that it was obvious he addressed the whole crew.
Steve finally moved from his spot. He only had a flimsy grasp on the situation, and it did feel utterly surreal to him, no lie there. But he wasn’t a person that sat still under any circumstances. So he moved, towards this strange man that had accidentally summoned him. Lifting a hand, he pinched the man’s cheek and waggled it gently back and forth. “Not a dream, I think.”
Steve sat a plate in front of him that had pancakes, easy-over eggs, and two strips of bacon. Tony may have whimpered a little as he couldn’t remember the last time someone had cooked him anything, even a meal as simple as this. He bit into it with gusto, found it all delightful, and was down to the last few bites of pancake before questions started leaking through. “Uh, Steve. I was distracted with a summoning spell gone rogue, so I didn’t ask questions I maybe should have?”
“Oh. Well. Sure?” Tony was clear on his need for a familiar, but he had no idea what to actually do with one. Familiars presumably required regularly feeding. Maybe walks?
Tony snorted. “I bet. Well, if you’re really that bored and willing to keep me company while I figure this out?”
“It’s so tangled, they’re not making much headway! Part of the net has gotten wrapped around the mast, with all the thrashing, and you know those nets are reinforced.”
“I’m really not trying to pry here, there’s just things I need to verify. You said you don’t have anyone waiting at home for you?” That made no sense to Tony. The man was gorgeous, for one, why didn’t he have a lover waiting on him? Friends? Someone, anyone. And more than that, Steve was
“God, yes. Liquid intelligence. Gimme.” He went to it like a bee towards nectar, pouring himself a cup nearly brimming over and inhaling it black. Then he poured another because the first cup was just to jump start his system. It didn’t actually supply him with any processing power.
That done, Tony brushed chalk off his fingers before standing just in front of it. Great stonking deities, but this was more difficult than he’d expected. Emotionally speaking, at least. He’d thought he’d long given up any hope of having a familiar or being properly licensed, but apparently not. It was welling up in the back of his throat now and making it rather hard to breathe. He sucked in a deep breath, lifted both hands, and spoke the simple incantation. “
A sad smile crossed Steve’s face. “Not as such, no. My only family I had left was my mother, and I lost her before I was out of my teens. Most of my friends didn’t survive the war. I came home to a city I knew, but no one to greet me. I’m honestly glad you pulled me here, Tony. I was really at loose ends and not sure what to do with myself. At the very least, you gave me a break from that.”
Two men stared back at him. One of them was clearly the mage that had brought him here, as the magic swirled around his extended hands, connecting him to the spell. Steve stared at him, perplexed by all this. He was a nice enough looking man, dark hair with some wave to it, golden skin, a goatee around his mouth. If he were much older than Steve himself, he’d eat his boots.
Both men looked at him, then each other with blank expressions, then back to him. Tony studied him from head to toe, eyes narrowed intently, then swore some more. “I am. How in the ever-loving
For a long, paralyzing moment, nothing seemed to happen. Rhodey’s hand came to rest at his back, not only bracing him, but tingling with his own magical power.
“Well, technically it can, I’ve seen some sentient magical artifacts summoned. And there was that one thing, it was like a golem, that was probably the strangest familiar I’ve seen. You’re not a golem, though.”
A knock at his door signaled that someone was coming into this lab. Workspace, whatever you wanted to call it. Pepper voted for carnage-in-distress. Rhodey was more apt in calling it a horror-show. Tony hadn’t heard high heels on the stone steps outside his door, so it was likely Rhodey braving his doorway. “Come in!”
“Let’s sit down, first. I think we all need alcohol for this conversation.” Rhodey turned around and headed for a staircase, as comfortable doing as if he owned the place.
Since he was first tested for magic at five years old, it had been clear to everyone that Tony’s magic didn’t play by the rules. Anything dealing with creation was somehow this insane task for him to complete. Even a basic fire spell. Wards were borderline, at best. But destroying something? Piece of cake. Tony’s eyes could dissect something down to its molecule without even trying. His magic could dismantle it and leave him feeling refreshed instead of drained.
He turned in place and walked, not precisely quickly, as he was enjoying the air and anonymity. And he liked to walk and think. Certainly he had a lot to think about.
“I keep telling you, you need to upgrade it to a newer model.” Even as he said the words, Tony was heading around the long counter to get a look at the register. It was older than he and Henry combined, the gears slowly stripping away. He’d taken a look at it more than once, replacing something or other.
Steve thought about that. How disorienting that must be, how confusing it probably became. It tied into his second question, of how a regular familiar could even begin to cope with Tony’s talent. Familiars were always smart, of course they were, but to that degree? Steve had seen magicians in action, in the thick of battle. He’d guarded more than a few as they worked because the magic was too complex for a quick one-off spell. Their familiars, try as they might, couldn’t fully protect a stationary mage while they worked. Tony did complex magic all of the time, that was his norm. Frankly, the idea of a normal familiar guarding this man chilled Steve’s blood.
He really couldn’t even think of eating. Turning, Tony shoved a pile of stacked sheet metal to the side and put the tray there. It was easier to do that menial task than look into Rhodey’s face. “Rhodey. That plan we talked about before, you know the one where you buy me out? So that the business can stay open, and I’m your employee, at least on paper….”
The idea of sending Steve off didn’t actually appeal to Tony. He kind of liked Steve and the idea of never seeing him again was depressing. Of course, that was also the familiar-mage bond likely talking. It wouldn’t like the idea of separation one iota.
Tony kept an ear trained on the two men even as he worked on the tiller. This time, it wasn’t that a gear had slipped, but something had gotten jammed into it. The tiller drawer refused to shut properly, and until it closed, Henry couldn’t clear the register and ring up another sale. No wonder he was frustrated.
“Hey, Henry!” Tony called. “Something’s jammed in here. I don’t have the tools to try and fish it out, can I just vanish it?”
Dropping his hands, the mage looked at Steve with a crooked smile. “Hello, Steve Rodgers. I’m Tony Stark, a mage-in-training that just managed to royally screw up a familiar summoning. How, you might wonder. I wonder this myself. I mean, literally, how does my magic think that giving me a
A dark pain began to grow in Steve's heart. It wasn't right. Tony shouldn't be by himself commemorating this event all alone. He should have company. Friends, family, anyone who gave a damn about Tony should be reveling in this opportunity. But Tony had no one. No a single person was around to congratulate Tony on his accomplishments.
“Why not? He’s clearly your type. Blond hair, tight ass, legs for days, and those muscles, god damn,” she groaned. “I’d kill to have him wrap me in those arms.”
Natasha turned to face him, eyeing the bottle sized lump in Tony’s bag. “I said I don’t mind the company. I know how hard holidays can be when you’ve lost someone important.”
“Oh really? And what about us? Isn’t the former Captain America and the mini Stark famous enough for sunglasses?”
“Steve’s here?” Pepper’s eyes were wide behind the silver mask. “The same Steve that dropped by the office?”
“Because Ms. Summers just gave me a rec report for an unlabeled shipment to be delivered to 6-16 within the next week,” she said, handing said requisition request into his shaky hands.
Steve could barely make a sound. He couldn’t even push the small boy off the counter. Steve was just too surprised by Tony’s bold move to say or do anything.
“Great!” Tony clapped his hands in excitement. He had so much planned for today. Plans to make, Steve people to impress, people to destroy. “So, lunch-”
Steve swept his pencil across the page with a confident smirk. “Maybe not, but I know for a fact that you’re too self-conscious for your own good.”
“I think I’ve had enough fun for today, thank you very much,” Tony said as he leaned back into his chair. “Besides, I like watching you chase fish. It’s fun.”
Their uniforms were tailored made to their body type, fighting style, and personality. A luxury reserved for those who went on top secret special op missions. From the collar of their jackets all the way down to their boots, these men’s uniforms were made out of a light, yet durable fabric that ranged from earthy brown to green all the way up to blue? Really? Red, white, and blue? On a military uniform? Whose bright idea was that? Sure the man’s blond hair was so eye catching that even Tony couldn’t ignore it, but that was no excuse for a ridiculous looking uniform. If you’re going to slap the American flag on an active military man, might as well have the guy carrying a giant target on his back saying ‘shoot me.’
“Romanov,” Tony said with a smile. “Beautiful name for a beautiful woman. Won’t be forgetting that any time soon.”
“Nothing,” she said, dismissing the topic as quickly as it had come up. They stood in amicable silence as they passed a few more floors before she asked, “So what business do you have with Mister Stark?”
The pure bright light enveloped his sight, the sheer power behind the blast pinning to the ground. Steve clenched his hands and tried to stay strong. He had to. He had to survive to survive the attack. He had to make sure Tony was alright. He had to-
“Yo!” Sam grabbed Steve’s shoulder and thrust him down into a pile of smelly black trash bags. Steve tried to get up, but Sam just pushed him back down. “What the hell is wrong with you? You need to calm down.”
Anxiety began eat at his nerves. Did he take too long to get here? Did his duties as Iron Man finally destroy one of the few good things in his life? God he hoped not.
Who was he kidding? He was Tony fucking Stark. He was Iron Man, leader and boss of the infamous Iron Family. He could do whatever the fuck he wanted and ask Pepper to send one of her famous “I’m sorry my boss is an idiot,” fruit baskets later.
Thor’s brow furrowed in concern. The grip on his hammer tightened. “I thought you were trying to stay out of trouble,” concern clear in his deep voice.
“Plus a bunch of others,” quipped another gargled voice. “And just so you know, as President of the ‘Steve Rogers is a Stubborn Asshole’ club, resumes must be submitted with a twenty five dollar processing payment.”
“He’s a good kid, Steve. Works hard. Makes me wish that all that kids that came ‘round here were as good as Peter.” Made him wish that more men were as good as Peter, but Tony doesn’t say that out loud.
Tony grinned in delight. Steve’s plan was working. They we’re getting the stolen weapons out of Hydra hands. Who would’a thunk Steve could pull it off.
“The experiment AIM performed on you, we think it worked. Bruce is looking over the data they recorded. It’s not complete, but he’s inclined to believe this little guy, he’s you.”
“It’s okay Steve.” Tony tried to reassure Steve. He kneeled down, his hand hovering over the damaged flesh, wondering what in the holly hell he was going to do. “I’ll take care of him. I promise.”
Thank god for Steve's friends interrupting when they did. Tony’s brain had sparked the idea for a toaster at the last salvageable second, yes, but he had gotten stuck in rambling mode as soon as he retracted from the embrace. And a whole lot of shit often came out on that mode. Like how while Steve carefully drew him, Tony fantasized Steve forcing him up against the wall and fucking him dry as Steve eye groped him between kisses with those sharp blue eyes. He would use those big, working hands to milk them both dry as Tony screamed and clawed his way through-
“I think there’s more important things going on right now, don’t you think?” insisted Steve, pulling a bit at Tony’s arm. Worried lines were etched deep in his face.
He wanted to do was get away from Tony. He wanted to run away from that lying son of a bitch. Steve wanted to get away from Tony’s life, his company, hell, anything that had to do with him or the Iron Family; Steve wanted to wash his hands of it and throw all his shame down the Hudson with only a pair of cement shoes for comfort.
“I don’t know, but it’s in the back of Schmidt’s car. I swear,” Clint voice crackled over the radio. “They’re gonna let it go any second now.”
“Tony,” Steve said and was it just Tony’s imagination or did Steve’s eyes light up when he said Tony’s name. “It suits you.”
Iron Man just stared at the door. What the hell just happened? His missed a lot of a conversation. But a conversation about what?
“Maybe,” said Tony, propping himself up just enough to watch Steve get dressed. “But is it worth the risk? I was a very sensitive, smart kid, remember? It doesn’t take much to figure out we’re fucking.”
“But Steve, I promise you this,” Tony said, taking Steve’s hands in his. “No matter what happens I will do everything in my power to make things right.”
“But he doesn’t deserve to disappear either,” said Tony. He was glad to be back. Absolutely thrilled that the others had thought he was important enough to bring back. But at the expense of someone else, especially a loved one? Tony didn’t feel he deserved that opportunity. “Do you miss him? The other me?”
“Mister Stark,” Bucky said, offering an equally firm handshake, “Thank you for looking after our pack leader. Hope he hasn’t been causing you too much trouble.”
Bruce jabbed a finger into a freshly purpling bruise. Tony stifled a grunt of pain as he doubled over the injury. “You’ve got the underground up in arms because of us, and yet you think it’s a good idea to go wandering around the city with no backup. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you lost your mind.”
He couldn’t find it. The receptionist gave him a strange look. Steve smiled his most innocent smile and proceeded to pat down and empty all the pockets on his body only to come up snake eyes.
Bruce shrugged the feedback off like it was nothing. “Think of it as a reminder not to get injured so often. Don’t want the pain, don’t get hurt. Negative reinforcement. With all the time you spend on my examination bed, you’d think you would have learned that lesson by now.”
Tony froze in his tracks, the words slowly registering into his consciousness as they reverberated down the halls. Heads turned in their directions, and sharp whispers began to pass between lips.
When the man’s face changed to a hue that bordered on blue, Steve threw him head first into the nearby wall. The man cried out as bone cracked against the wood. His head bounced off the surface like a baseball as he staggered back. He teetered about for a few seconds as he tried to find his balance.
“Admit it, you put up with it because you love your boyfriend more than coffee,” Steve said, laying down on top of Tony’s chest. His hands splayed possessively over Tony’s scars.
“So what?” probed Bucky, eying a large standing crate. “We’re just going to open a box and pick out some old tech.”
Steve was taken aback by Tony’s forwardness. He wasn’t opposed. Far from it. But saying those things out here in public, near other people? Steve tried to think of something to say. Something clean, but with clear boundaries aligned with public values and constitutions. But all that came out was, “Good. It looks good.”
“Either way, their supply locations would be good to compare to any documents we have on record. See if anything our Hydra guest knows matches up to what we have on file. Think you can get that for me Bruce? Don't want to be knocking down the wrong doors. ”
. Sleep is important,” Tony said, waving away Steve’s courtesy. “Look, I know you’re worried about my mind getting wiped again; lord knows what tricks Obie’s got up his sleeve, but I’ll be fine on my own. You don’t have to keep me company every second of the day."
Steve felt his heart sink a little, and he silently he berated himself. He was not feeling jealous of a guy he just met, he told his sinful heart. He was not! It wasn't possible and it was most definitely not appropriate. “Your friends are back in Boston or here in Brooklyn?”
Steve could only shrug. “I know a guy,” he lied. He did know a guy, but Tony didn’t need to know that Steve was that guy. Steve hated lying. But Tony didn’t need to know about Steve’s side job. It was better this way. He didn’t need the fight between legal and illegal. Moral and amoral. Steve just needed to remember that Tony was, as far as the signs showed, a straight shooting guy that didn’t need the scandal from seeing a guy that swung both ways.
“What is that?” Steve’s face was white as a sheet and his voice came out as a near silent whisper. “Did you make that?”
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” mocked Bucky as they made their way into the secret back room. Clearly he wasn’t as intimidated by the architectural implications as Steve was. “You’ve been going on about him nonstop for the past two weeks. Hurry up and hook up already.”
“Brothers and sister,” Schmidt’s voice echoed across the crowd slowly gathering in the park. “Do you not see? Hitler is the answer to our problems! Under his leadership, he will bring pride, glory, and honor back to Germany!”
Go after him? Stay? Steve should be given his space. They both need a little bit of space after what happened. But at what cost? Losing Steve? Tony was already at his wit’s end not seeing that beautiful smile for the past two weeks. If he was going to lose Steve, he might as well go down kicking and screaming.
“No,” Steve insisted. “We can take care of ourselves.” Didn’t matter what Tony proposed, Steve had considered every possibility and this was the best one of the bad lot. Granted, this idea was seeming less optimal with each passing second, but Steve didn’t see much of a choice.
“I don’t know,” said Bruce with a shrug. “Punch to the diaphragm? Asthma? Shell shock? Cracked ribs? Punctured lung? You’re going to need to be more specific than that.”
“Sure there is,” she reassured him with an all knowing smile. Natasha pulled away, giving Steve a little space as she thought aloud about the specifics. “Knowing Barnes, he’ll want the shiniest meat-cycle I can find.” She began pacing back and forth, muttering in Russian under her breath. “Can you give me a few days to shop around before I report back?” she asked. “Little rusty when it comes to the local intel, but I should be able to find something.”
Didn’t matter. Tony could figure that out later once he was dry and his scales were gone. But one thing was for sure, Captain America was finally coming home. And nobody, not even Captain America could know that Tony Stark; genius, playboy, millionaire, merman was the one who found him.
“Chicken sandwich, hold the mayo,” she said, shoving a white wrapped package into Tony’s hands. “Eat.”
“And I met my ‘someone special’ on my walk? That makes absolutely no sense, Pep. How could someone I’ve only just met become a ‘someone special’?”
He saw a few nods of approval and Steve felt a little more at ease. Even the greatest tacticians needed a little reassurance that their “run and hide” plans were valid options. He felt like a coward setting everyone in pairs when he knew they were more than capable of taking care of themselves. But with valid threats on the cusp of an underground war, Steve wanted to take no chances. Pairing Bucky with Sam and Thor with Jane was the best he could do with their crappy situation. Thor had a bad habit of taking dangerous risks for, as he put it, “The glory of battle!” and Bucky was still recovering from the five-on-two-beating he took two days ago. He needed Sam and Jane paired up to keep tabs on his two loose cannons.
. Tumblr is for reblogs. Still learning how to use twitter, so for now it's random thoughts and hopefully writing updates.
“Where are my manners,” Steve said, breaking the silence and offering a hand. “I’m Steve. Steve Rogers.”
Tony’s mouth curved up into a cheeky smile. “Depends, what did you have in mind?” he asked, voice dry as sand.
Tony tried to shake off the noise, but he had frankly had enough of this bullshit. Quick as he could, Tony reached up and unclasped the helmet. A familiar “click” and it was like breathing for the first time. Tony lifted the helmet off his head and shook the sweat from his brow, finally free from the sound cage.
Tony sighed. He removed his foot and casually walked around to the other side. He looked down at the grunt’s face, covered in dirt, sweat, and blood. “Just to be sure I understand, you’d rather ripped apart to keep your tongue than give up now and go back to your friends and family in one piece.”
“Steve, why don’t you have a seat,” said Tony because enough was enough. It was time to get to the bottom of things.
Without a word, Steve nodded his approval. Tony’s lips twitched up into a weak smile as he reached for his tie. Steve’s sharp eyes caught the small tremble in Tony’s fingers as he loosened the intricate knot around his neck. With practiced fingers, Tony removed his tie and let the silk fabric slip down to the floor between his fingers. Next came the buttons. Deft fingers worked each ivory button open until Tony’s entire chest was exposed.
Steve’s lips turned up into a devious grin. “What do you want, Tony? Do you want the sheet on or off?”
“Yeah,” the man said, wincing at his own request like it was the stupidest thing he could ask for. “They’re really good. Reminds me of home. Think you could show me how?”
Bruce shrugged. “Won’t know for sure until we get back to the compound and I can run some actual tests. But for now, yes. Looks like you’ll live for now.”
And after months of being held captive, being squirreled off to some secret facility was the last thing Tony wanted to do.
With the stress from life pushing down on him, it would have been natural for Steve to lash out and yell something about ‘not knowing what the fuck they were talking’ about before giving them a thorough facelift. But with Tony saying it in his joking sort of way, Steve blushed pink with embarrassment. "Yeah," said Steve, with a guilty smile as he rubbed a thumb against the back of his hand. "We're working on that."
The center was still warm. The dark taste of meat coated his tongue and Tony almost moaned. Fuck you Zeek and your weird antioxidant detox diet. No amount of kale essence tea could replace a good piece of red meat.
“Imma wear my purple one today,” Morgan said as she hopped down off her father’s hip. “Do you know where it is?”
“Yeah?” he said into the phone. A chill ran down Steve’s back as the cold, harsh voice of Iron Man replaced the softness in Tony’s eyes. “Yeah, he’s with me. Yes Pepper, my pants are still around my waist. No, I didn’t. I dislike that you insinuate that I … Okay. I understand. We’ll be there in a second.”
Tony turned around and made a beeline for the door. He heard Steve whine, but he refused to look back. Injured or not, he wasn’t sure if he could say no to Puppy Eyed Steve a second time.
Jan nodded. “Of course. I just got so excited thinking he might ask you out. I didn’t stop to consider what might happen if things went bad. I’m really sorry, Tony.”
Iron Man’s arms waved back and forth, trying to find something to hang on to. His hand grazed the side of something solid. Praying for something sturdy enough to support him, Tony made a desperate grab for the beam. He missed and fell down to the floor with a loud crash.
“I do,” said Bruce with relief at the temporary peace. “It’s actually quite good, and I know what the inner circle likes. Plus, Iron Man has already tasted your stuff and has insisted on paying you at least $2 a bottle.”
“You really shouldn’t,” Tony grumbled. “Look, kid, hate to tell you this, but we’re not going to grow up to be Captain America. We got what we got and I just made do. There’s no way I could ever be like Cap.”
The hope in Tony’s eyes faded. His smile disappeared. He looked down at his hands and tried to hide the disappointment on his face. “So, I was mistaken then. You and Bucky. You guys are… You’re seeing him.”
The phone on the desk rang, breaking the tension between them. Tony marched over to the receiver and picked it up before the third ring.
Morgan grinned. “I made a picture” she said, showing off a drawing made with all the crude creativity of a five-year-old. Which, to be fair, she was. “See? That’s you and me and daddy.”
“We gotta split up,” Iron Man said, mind present and ready to command his troops. “War Machine and Rescue, you two cover me and make sure those whack jobs don’t escape. Keep ‘em nice and corralled. Hawkeye, keep us informed if they make any sudden movements.”
“Anthony,” he said with a calloused grip of his hand. Working man then.“But everyone calls me Tony.”
Steve! What had happened to Steve? He looked around and saw Steve getting jumped by three guys. Two had his arms restrained and the third went for the body hits. Blood was running down over Steve’s eye, and he was already bent over in pain. Tony dug his fingers into the ground. He had to help Steve. Steve didn’t deserve to deal with this type of shit.
Her eyes were on the flashing lights as they moved down toward the basement level. “Your things are already prepared and in the car.”
But just as Steve was about to take Tony’s cock in hand and rub him awake, a sharp, insistent knock came from the other side of his door.
“Yeah! A lot of folks in Brooklyn have temp work or seasonal contracts with Stark Industries. And a lot of folks I know are looking for full time work at Stark Industries, but haven’t gotten close to getting. But you actually got in. And you have your own business card!”
There was a gentle tug on Steve’s sleeve. “Steve, will you tell me a story?” asked Tony. “Mommy always tells me a story before bed.”
Finally, Tony mustered up the strength to break out of the super soldier’s grasp. He gasped, desperate for air. A thin line of saliva connected their lips like a glistening thread of fate. Steve licked the thread off Tony’s lips with a cheeky grin. “Can’t say no if your mouth is full.”
Tony looked at the enclosure and saw the wolf, sitting politely at the edge of the cage staring intently at Tony’s breakfast.
"Trying to give you a present,” Tony said with a smile. “But I guess I'm not welcomed here since..." he gestured to the barrel trained toward his head.
“I see,” said Steve as he looked at the three figures drawn beneath a smiling sun. “You got my uniform right and I love your tutu, but why is your dad wearing sunglasses?”
“When I draw you, I learn something new about the man I love, every time. I’m reminded why I’ll never get tired of the view. I remember why I love you. ”
Steve chuckled and it made Tony’s heart melt into a pile of goo. “You say that to all the pretty dolls?” he asks in an equally deep, quiet voice. He moved closer, eyes downcast, but not looking down at Tony.
“Just make sure you limit past you’s exposure to future technology. And don’t touch your younger self,” warned Bruce. “We don’t know the effects of AIM’s experiment yet. Will you fade because of the paradox? Are we in a stable time loop? Did the timeline break when he came here? The universe as we know it isn’t falling apart. Seems to be fine when he interacts with people or things. However, we don’t know if the knowledge he’ll take back will change things or what will if you guys interact with each other. Talking seems safe, but if you guys touch for more than a few seconds it could cause a time paradox.”
“Oh now you don’t,” Tony growled. He pushed himself up, ready for battle, only to feel the tug back down as Steve’s firm grip held onto his arm.
There was no sign of any emotion on War Machine’s mask, at least none that Steve could see after a quick sweep of his posture. But there must have been something there because the suit leaned over and whispered in a disgruntled voice, “He’s not here.”
"Yeah, I really did.” Tony’s voice was soft to Steve’s ears. No air of superiority. No malice or anger. Just Tony. Steve liked that. “But, you know, maybe you can pay me back by making me the first person you put in there."
Quick as he came in, Iron Man veered off and away from the main fight. He ran as hard as he could in a straight toward the center of the building. No time or energy for weaving in and out of aisles. He just had to trust that his family would pick off any unwanted tagalongs, and that Steve would be right behind him when he turned around.
He hobbled over to the service counter and leaned out the truck window. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He wanted to remember this; a strangely peaceful evening in the middle of a war-torn country.
“Yeah. Of course,” Tony said. He moved to the side and welcomed his guest inside the narrow tuck. “It’s small and a bit messy, but feel free to make yourself comfortable.”
His heart skipped a beat as his chest trapped the thin air in his lungs. So it was Steve. His eyes hadn’t deceived him.
Tony tried to forget the ‘almost’ kiss as he made his way to the edge of their sanctuary of streetlight. If Hawkeye chose to alert Tony, now of all times, he need to be calm, collected, and a responsible boss, not a panicking mess about coming out as gay. “Steve, stay there,” his voice is still a bit shaky, but his assurance stabilized his warbling emotions.
Tony was jealous of the attention they received. He wished other men would look at him that way. Hell, Tony wished
Natasha cocked her head to the side. “Are you talking about red, white, and beefcake? I walked by them a few minutes ago. Can confirm, they’re talking about you.”
Panic gripped his heart. Where was Tony? What the hell was he doing in a place like this? Was he in trouble? Worse, was he in danger? Was the Iron Family holding him hostage because of what happened with Steve? He had to find him. He had to find Tony.
Tony couldn’t help but laugh at Clint’s disgust. “You’re just jealous of all the angry sex I’m going to get when this is all over. It’s going to be so fucking fantastic that I won’t be able to sit for a week.”
“You’ll excuse me if I don’t believe you.” Steve looked up toward the light and then back at Tony like he was trying to decide the lesser of two evils. He bent down, and laid a hand on Tony’s uninjured shoulder. “I’m going to get us a cab. Wait here until I get back,” his voice was quiet, as if trying his best to reassure the both of them.
Tony cocked his head to the side. “ ‘That kind of company?’ What are you- Oh! You misunderstand. We don’t go around soliciting sex. The girls are here to remind you of home. Not the girl next door. The Red Cross hires women with degrees so they can engage you in a conversation. Not just… well, you know.”
Tony looked down at his mug. He rolled it around and let the tea slosh up against the rim of the cup. It was getting cold. “Sorry that I took his place.”
“I don’t need that kind of help Obie. I just,” he saw something gold pass by just beyond his line of sight. “It’s personal. I need to take care of this myself.”
Hours later, they lay in bed together, Steve’s chest plastered against Tony’s side. Both looking up at Tony’s hand as he held the ring above their heads so it could sparkle in the moonlight.
She stopped him mid-sentence. “What did you tell me back in Russia?” she asked, jabbing a finger into Steve’s face. “Whatever happens, we do it together. Same goes for you Steve. I may be trying to keep myself on the straight and narrow, but I’m not heartless. I know you have a hard time asking for stuff, but if you ever need me, you know I’ll back you up. I owe you, Steve. And you know how much I hate owing favours to people.
Down the hallway, the elevator pinged. Tony walked into the kitchen, announcing his presence with a loud yawn as his bare feet padded across the floor. His hair was plastered flat on one side and a floppy mess on the other. Brown and grey stubble decorated Tony’s jaw and neck all the way down to the purple hickey barely hidden underneath a loose fitting white shirt. Tony stretched his arms over head, revealing a bit of beautiful skin above the waistband of his sweatpants.
“No, I think you’ve been told that’s all you are. Take it from a man that’s learned it the hard way. What you’ve been told, and what is the reality, are often two very different things.”
“I’m not going to fall over.” Probably. Odds were good, at least. Tony prudently went back to the bar and sat down in a stool to lower the odds further. His balance was a little impaired some days.
As they walked back to Tony’s apartment, the bags of new clothes in Steve’s hand, Steve posed the first one. “You said that your magic likes to destroy, but exactly how does it work? You’ve only said it takes a long incantation, that it’s tailor-made for each instance, but that doesn’t explain how it functions.”
“I do not know,” his companion said, so shocked he was listing under it. “Seriously, I do not know, you did everything perfectly as far as I could see. Uh, sir? Do you understand me?”
It was obvious that Tony didn’t need a guide, he changed streets with purpose, his feet pounding against the hard cobblestone. Steve was close on his heels as he followed him down the winding streets to the base of the hill, where the docks stretched over the water.
“Oh, I’m plenty close enough. But I’m not sure if I’m stable enough. Another dip like that, and I’ll go careening.”
The motor was loud enough to make talking difficult, but Tony didn’t let that stop him. He yelled back to her, “How long has it been going on?”
Rhodey ran a hand over his short, wiry hair. “I meant like, mental prep. Shit, I don’t know what I’m saying. Where’s your chalk?”
Tony’s hands wrapped around Steve’s arm, feet scrambling for purchase. But he trusted the hold, didn’t try to squirm. “Good catch.”
“Morning,” Henry returned. An amiable man with a fatherly paunch and bushy mustache, Henry always seemed right on the verge of a smile. “Your timing is good, Tony. This stupid contraption is acting up again.”
The motor throttled back as Marsha brought them around to the opposite side of the ship from where the whale was. There was already a rope ladder over the side, anticipating them. Steve reached up, stabilizing the bottom of the ladder, and Tony scrambled up it like a monkey. Steve waited until he was over the rail before following him up.
“No, don’t react like that. I know that you think it’s impossible, but fuck it, Tony. You haven’t really tried.”
“Sure.” Steve followed him to the far wall, where the men’s clothing hung on racks and displays, letting Henry direct him.
Rhodey’s expression was a study in sympathy and concern. “Gods above, Tones, I know we suspected this was coming, but it’s still damn hard.”
With Rhodey’s very capable help, they drew out the large summoning circle on the wooden floor. No one knew what kind of creature a mage would call upon. Tony had seen everything from unicorns to dogs. It was whatever the mage’s own magic deemed suitable. People tended to draw large summoning circles. Just in case.
“As you have already stated, this is a pretty basic spell. How am I supposed to prep for it, Rhodey?”
. He took the walking disaster that was Tony in stride and didn’t get upset with him, cleaned the kitchen, and even cooked for him. Tony couldn’t remember meeting someone this nice in forever. Even Rhodey and Pepper yelled. For good reason, granted.
Steve rather sympathized with that. Especially as the obvious implication was a doozey. “If you summoned me as a familiar, even by mistake, does that mean I’m currently bound to you as a familiar?”
“No, it makes perfect sense. Why would my magic choose you, instead of some other soldier nearby? Because it was going for one of the best. Because that’s apparently what I need, more than a creature of some sort. Although how I’ll explain this to the magic council, that I do not know. Steve.” Tony grimaced, eyes falling to the floor. “No, that doesn’t matter, I guess. I’m sitting here talking like I can keep you, but obviously I can’t. You’ve got family and a life to get back to.”
Steve’s expression relaxed, transitioning into a slight smile. “I like this one. What do you think, Tony?”
Steve sucked in a startled breath that expelled on a choked laugh. “Great gods, man, but your eyes really are something. How long did it take you to see that?”
Steve had to parse through some of that but he got the gist. “So, let me understand this properly. You’re a mage-in-training, which means you’re at the stage of summoning a familiar? Which you attempted, and got me?”
And what did it say about him that he actually entertained the idea of staying? Steve had been admittedly unhappy for months now, but he didn’t realize just how much until he was staring a clean slate right in the face. The idea of starting fresh here was oddly appealing. But would he even be allowed to?
“Hell, you’re serious.” Tony let out a half-laugh, shaking his head. “You’re a strange one, Steve. But okay, let me see if I can put into layman’s terms. So, to me, the world doesn’t look like simple structures. I can see the design of everything, right down to its smallest part.”
“Uh, well, shit I might as well tell you. You’re bound to hear it from somebody.” Tony winced, already resigned to the inevitable reaction, and steadfastly looked anywhere but Steve’s face. “I’m already in trouble with the magic council. Because I’m twenty-three and still haven’t sat for the last of the Trials, see. They’ve given me thirty days to finish—twenty-nine now—or abandon my license. If they hear that I summoned a man, well, I’m not sure how they’d take it. Probably not well.”
“Go ahead,” Henry responded with a wave. “Now Steve, how about this shirt? It’s a good color and I think it’ll give you enough room in the shoulders.”
