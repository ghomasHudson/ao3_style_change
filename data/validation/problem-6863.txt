Coiling in his muscles, burning in his lungs… pulsing through his veins. A fire he could feel moving under his skin, tightening-
And there was no point in trying to plan this thing with Steve, because it would only make him angry.
He remembered thinking of a million things that he wanted for Steve... he remembered there being reasons he could never be those things...
For the fact that Steve had just thoughtlessly pulled Tony in to kiss him, because he wanted to. The fact that it was unpolished and undramatic and…
But he couldn’t quite work out what that post-it made his blood run cold… He found himself trying to remember how long this FOCUS stuff was meant to last – and, when he couldn’t, he concluded that it was probably wearing off. And there was still just about enough of it left for him to consider
It was enough to stop the laughter in Steve’s chest. Enough to extinguish all the warmth in him, somehow…
Tony realised that the girl’s parents were probably in that group somewhere – or, at least someone she wanted to know she’d done good…
have to worry about how uncomfortable it’s going to be, because the doctor won’t,” Bucky seemed to work it out as he was saying it. “But, I don’t know – I think I just trust that this is going to be as good as it can be. That he’d actually explain stuff, and ask me before he did anything, and try to make the whole thing less shit. So, I guess… now there’s no point worrying, or something.” He shrugged again, like it wasn’t a big deal.
“Thank you,” he said, gesturing to the bloodstained T-shirt on the floor beside him. Bucky just frowned and shook his head.
“Ha. Well. I’m not really any great expert on what I’m feeling, either,” Tony muttered. And then, more firmly, added, “And anyway, you might be right that… well, me feeling good or bad about something isn’t really any indicator that it’s good or bad…”
better, actually. He hadn’t worked out what this slow, crawling sadness was, exactly… but ‘better’ wasn’t the word.
how it felt to wake up in the 21st Century when you never expected to wake up at all. The strange mix of relief and terror that eventually boiled into a numb, confused trauma.
There was a stir of adrenaline that was somewhere between shock and temper, and a beat of total silence in his head.
this is, there you are at every appointment and still feeling bad for not caring enough…” He shook his head affectionately;
A strange little shiver ran up Tony’s spine, hot and compulsive and somewhat at odds with his elated sobbing…
So, thinking back through all the little details of Steve that he had longed for in the last few weeks, Tony dropped his head to kiss Steve’s throat. Steve barked another moan, throwing one hand to the back of Tony’s head and wrapping his other arm tight around Tony’s waist. A spike of pleasure shot up along Tony’s spine, a more immediate, compulsive heat building where Steve had him gripped hard against his body. His kisses became rougher, sucking deep, burgundy marks over the tender skin below Steve’s collarbone.
to catalogue his thoughts and get into the right mindset… The fact that Bucky had always understood that, had always been happy to meet him there, on those occasions that Steve could walk.
Stape was still standing by the double doors, at least fifty feet away from them – there was no way Steve would be able to get to him before he had the chance to fire a shot. Not with his legs as weak as they were.
,” he threw his hands out theatrically, looking at Steve to confirm that it really was that ridiculous.
3) Tony makes mention in this chapter that he thinks Adam might be mentally ill. He does not say this in a derogatory way, but just to reassure you, this is not going to be the full discussion of this point, and it's not going to be given as Adam's whole motivation (I'm really not a fan of the whole 'X has a mental illness, we can tell because they behave unconventionally, that explains everything!' trope... and it was only when I realised where the chapter break was going to be that I thought maybe it would raise concerns like that... anyway, having already over explained too much, the point is that it's not going that way.)
He couldn’t help himself. He’d been the same since he was a kid – always looking for patterns in strings of numbers, or trying to work out the mechanics of things, or trying to translate things in his mind. A little game, really… But, you know… He really might be able to work out the science of this place, if he had a few minutes…
Not even at the joke Tony had been making. It was just so far from what he’d expected Tony to say – Steve was so surprised to hear
He flinched slightly, and wondered if this was the sort of thing he wasn’t supposed to be thinking about…
It was a calculated gamble, the first time - on himself, as much as Steve. It was taking a step in the hope that it would be the right one, because it seemed likely to lead somewhere better. Because, in spite of his lingering apprehension, Tony had a good feeling about it.
himself look up… relieved to find that Tony had turned away from him, to gesture towards the couch on the left-hand side of the room. Steve followed Bucky to sit, awkwardly, at one end of it – leaving as much room as he could at the other.
He tried ignoring that too, at first. Instinctively, it felt like something he shouldn’t be thinking about…
“…There must be some sort of interface system, for this…” He mused to himself. And Steve smiled, softly,
“...I mean, I get that we might need a way to… restrain him, at first,” Tony went on, when Steve didn’t. “From what you said, I mean. But… does it have to be that, specifically?”
reminded him of all the other things he’d meant to think about, before he got to this bit. Pointed out,
At last, and without really thinking about it, Tony reached over and picked up the sketch. There was a warm, soft feeling when he turned it over, something he knew should be deeply unnerving but
On another night, it might’ve been different. Steve might simply have put his head on Tony’s shoulder, knowing that Tony understood, and cared, and maybe on another night that would’ve been enough.
Of course, as soon as they arrived at the Princess Aura Folk Dancing Competition, Tony had started to think they should’ve perhaps been a
“The idea is to think of it less as a weapon and more as a defence… although, it would be able to contain a weapon, obviously…”
that there was nothing more important than stopping this, that this whole ‘fantasy’ was just Tony leaving him forever and that all he had to do now was
He gave himself a nod of encouragement, before he took a deep breath and walked through to the bedroom to get dressed…
And he was slowly coming to terms with the idea that his entire existence had changed, in ways he couldn’t even process yet…
Steve stared at the keys for a moment, before closing his hand around them and squeezing them tight.
He knew he was. He knew that his thoughts didn’t usually work this way, that his body didn’t feel like his own, that the way his emotions were running away from him wasn’t natural-
seen before… thousands of times, now that he thought of it… a look he’d never been quite able to place, until now.
“So, the first you knew there was a problem was when you went to move your arm?” Tony frowned, glancing up to meet Barnes’ eye. He realised that it was much easier to do that, when he was actually thinking about something else…
It took Steve a second to comply with that one, simply because his body was so overwhelmed. But he clawed himself onto his stomach just as soon as he was physically able – rewarded by what was either a sharp pleasure or a dull pain when his still-sensitive cock was pressed against the sheets.
fell into the same routine, on nights like this. The same running order, the same positions, hitting all the same beats every single time. Having Bucky do something else conflicted with a subconscious expectation, a corporal assumption. Like walking into somewhere very familiar, and finding that first step just wasn’t there anymore…
“Yeah, I’m okay,” he smiled – meaning it, this time. Steve smiled back, and kissed his forehead, and brought Tony’s head to rest on his shoulder again.
He heard Steve’s breath hitch again. He felt the kick in Steve’s chest, the immediate reaction to that sentiment, specifically. Tony knew how hard
An unbearable wave of agonised guilt, crashing into him as a solid mass, knocking the air out of his lungs-
“You look tired,” he observed gently, noting the heavy slump of Tony’s shoulders and the shadows under his eyes. Tony gave an indignant smirk.
But Rhodey stepped into the workshop before Tony could finish the thought – and immediately paused in alarm.
Steve felt an affectionate smile pull at his lips, despite all the emotional turmoil that had just crashed over him.
And Steve liked the way Tony shivered into the sensation, the trembling moan he could feel on Tony’s lips - and there was nothing more to think about. He caressed his hands over the curve of Tony’s ass, grinding up against him, deliberately dragging a low, keening moan from him-
problems I have with you right now are the same damn problems I’ve had since we were eight years old,” Bucky groaned, affectionately. “You
I’ve spent twenty years in this house… But, honestly, sometimes I think that even if I woke up human tomorrow… I still wouldn’t be able to leave the house without bumping into things, or know what anyone was talking about when I got there.”
Steve allowed a more genuine smile for that - before he glanced down at the briefcase, and remembered his bad mood.
not even an Avenger,” Pepper commented, taking another large swig from her water glass. “I don’t know why
...What, just accept that sometimes he fell into an all-consuming, physical urge to be good for Steve, and offer himself up for Steve, and let Steve take care of him… And that was just… Fine?
He could hear Wesley whimpering quietly as he unfolded it, his eyes immediately drawn to the letters tastefully embossed at the top of the page,
attention six months ago, when we discovered that it was frequented by this fine, upstanding citizen,” with a wave of his hand, the image behind him clicked through to a mugshot. Steve felt his ribs ease just slightly when he recognised the picture. Eliot Fisk – a mid-level black market arms dealer, listed as a family associate of a criminal organisation that the Avengers themselves had been investigating for weeks.
The decorative marks that Steve was casually appreciating might have great significance to Thor. This might be the setting of a thousand formative memories… Somewhere Thor would never get to see again, as much as he’d like to…
This time, there wasn’t that little pause when Tony stood up from his work. This time, they were already in the middle of a conversation – the talk they’d almost started last week, about the true nature of progress.
In this chapter Tony tells Steve about the night that Obie turned him into a vampire, which includes discussion of the fact that:
It suddenly occurred to Steve that, in all the time they’d been on this alien planet, this was the first non-human he’d seen. Well, that he’d known… Everyone they’d spoken to so far was completely fluent in the language of 21
The conversational equivalent of strapping his shield to his arm and running headlong into battle, because he couldn’t bear to do less.
By the time they got to the corridor again Tony’s heart was racing, his head swimming with the effort it took just to breathe-
“Oh, God, Oh-fuck-oh-fuck-oh-fuck-” Tony panted, his voice getting higher and tighter and more desperate as that feeling inside him built and sharpened and,
Tony let his lips trail up along Steve’s throat, leaving a line of deep, purple bruises from the sweep of his shoulder all the way along to the back of his ear – Steve’s breathing getting higher and faster as Tony moved, Tony rocking into him in time with Steve’s ever increasing panting. And then Tony broke away to nip very softly at Steve’s earlobe.
Tony had slipped into a pleasant, dream-like state, blissfully unaware that he was actually crashing from an adrenaline high.
And… God, this seemed like such a big moment, and the only person he wanted to tell was Tony… and he wasn’t sure he should. And that was weird, right? To have committed himself to someone and not be sure he should mention it to
And then there was the very surreal experience of hearing Tony’s voice in his head and out loud at the same time.
those things embarrassed them, and not that they did them. It’s a work in progress, I grant you – but steady progress. And, before too long, we should be able to administer a dose to the whole of planet Earth that will make people forget their slavish devotion to ‘the way things should be’. That’s all. They won’t forget who they are, or what they knew, or who they love – just that these plants haven’t always been a fact of life. They’ll forget that they weren’t working on the full potential of these drugs, before.”
Steve had spent that time sitting rigid at his desk, waiting in vain for the dizziness to pass, flinching between one impulse and the other.
“Actually, you might,” Tony corrected, kindly – but still Steve inhaled sharply, bracing for something. Tony leant back to look at him when he explained, “that’s not actually the criteria, Steve. Not for anyone else, at least. People aren’t only trustworthy up until they keep one secret – otherwise you wouldn’t be able to trust a single person on Earth… I’ve lied. I’ve lied to you before, and kept things from you, but you never assumed that you could obviously never trust me again… I’m not saying what you did wasn’t wrong. I’m not saying you shouldn’t learn anything from it. I’m not saying it’s not a big deal if you lie to me – you really
“I love you,” he sighed, stroking a lazy palm up along Steve’s spine. He felt Steve tense against his hand, rolling his back to meet Tony’s movements, still sucking greedy kisses along his neck.
“Which leaves me with the question of where I’m going to get a cryo-chamber from…” he breezed on… And then cocked an eyebrow, his smile tightening as he considered “...Unless I
And, just as Tony was thinking that was quite an involved idea for her to bother discussing with either of them right now, Steve casually observed,
“Because… You know, we actually have a blood donor shortage in this country. A lot of places do. There aren’t enough people who donate blood anyway, and then a lot of
Secondly, in order to manage expectations - 1. this is a fade to black, so you do not get to see this smut scene in the next update (although you do get to hear about it, and you do get *other* smut at the end of that update)
Steve understood Tony’s instinct to retreat from his rant, once he’d had it. He saw the hundred of people who’d ignored Tony’s hurt feelings, or belittled them, or asked him what right he had to them in the first place. The learned response of just not showing them, trying not to have them…
Century hadn’t even existed in 1940s, and certainly not for poor families like his, so they still didn’t really occur to him.
That was the only explanation that Tony could think of for his sudden, ludicrous change of heart. That he’d simply lost his head for a second…
like a burn – and Steve couldn’t catch his breath in time to protest, before he felt Tony’s fingertips, now wet with lube, pressing at his rim. Steve groaned low in his chest, lifting his ass, rocking back to meet Tony’s hand. Tony pushed two fingers all the way into him, slow and firm, pressing and then twisting inside him as he pulled away just as slowly.
Steve was going to be sorry for saying it. He knew Steve would panic, that he’d feel bad – that he’d try to take it back.
At least, until he felt Tony press another sweet little kiss to his skin, an inch lower, his hands slowly spreading Steve open.
Without the benefit of prior focus, it all seemed like a mess of noise and motion, at first. Bucky, hands already held up in front of him, backing towards the swimming pool with an exhilarated grin on his face. Tony darting in between groups of people in swift, jumping motions, as though he was looking for somewhere to hide. The low murmur of the people around them looking up and asking what the hell was going on…
The Tony Steve left in 2023 had been real, and he mattered, and Steve had loved him - and there was nothing he could do to bring that man back, or make amends for all the hurt he caused him.
Tony felt a genuine sadness well up in him, when he finally had to let go to open their door. A sweet sort of sadness, but still… he had a feeling that it was just going to keep on cooling into regular sadness, from here. But he managed a smile as he stood aside to let Steve through, and he vowed to wait until Steve was asleep before he did anything silly, like think about any of this. Or cry.
He remembered the rush of exhilaration as he argued with Tony in the yard, the thrill of sexual tension and unrequited love… Things Steve would never feel again, no matter where he went back to…
Eventually, in desperation, Tony had resigned himself to this most tedious and uncomfortable of chores-
It was like the first bite of food when you’re starving, or finally sitting down when you’re exhausted, or coming into the warm after so long out in the bitter, endless cold… He just couldn’t stop now. The thought of going back to that sad and lonely reality was suddenly overwhelming, terrifying, so much worse than actually living it had been. And he
about it, at the time. Something fundamental and basic and good. Steve could remember that feeling - almost clearly enough to recreate it…
Steve’s rhythm faltered just slightly, as he forced his hand into his pocket, pushing his pants further down his thighs as he grabbed the little tube of lube. He stilled for a second, leaving Tony to rock frantically against his mouth as he flicked the cap open, and wet his fingers. And then he pressed his fingertips against Tony’s hole-
he still the sort of person who would’ve chosen a perfectly tailored suit over a designer one, or who would’ve turned up to a business meeting in a Hawaiian shirt, or who wouldn’t be seen dead in ‘pleather’, or any of the things he’d been
“And if we bring anyone else in now, all they can do is try and take the place by force, or do exactly what we’re doing now and try to infiltrate by stealth. And if they try to take the place by force, they’ll be going in blind, and the Adam’s might do anything, especially to the people from Anni Vara. They’ll destroy all the evidence, for sure.” Tony reasoned. “And if they’re going to send someone to do it by stealth-”
But he ignored that, and made himself look up to where an image of a lush, green landscape was now being displayed on the screen. When he looked back, Dev was holding one of those little hand held remotes, used by CEOs for PowerPoint presentations the world over… there was something laughably mundane about that, but Tony ignored that too.
What it really meant was that there were times when Steve was so fucking horny that he couldn’t think straight. Times when every muscle in his body tensed with a desperate need for release, times when it was all he could do to keep himself from openly panting. Sometimes it was triggered by the most minor or mundane of things – sometimes, as far as Steve could tell, it wasn’t triggered by anything at all. He had literally no idea why he felt like this today. He’d just woken up with an uneasy awareness of his own body, and a weary understanding of exactly where it was going. It had quickly heated into a compulsive, irritated feeling, like an itch he couldn’t find. Then a low ache, and a painful erection that hadn’t relented even slightly in the last few hours – and Jesus Christ, Steve wished he hadn’t worn the Captain America uniform to this stupid meeting.
Steve let go of a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He felt like he should be more prepared for that question. Obviously, Bucky would want to make sure that Tony was okay after what happened. He would wonder
This little interaction was a perfect analogy for that void Steve still felt, that specific sadness that seemed to soak
to happen…” he breathed, like he might’ve been talking to himself. And then he picked his clothes up, hiding in the motion as he carried on talking. “I meant all of it too. I mean, I don’t actually know exactly what I said… But I know I meant it. And it was good, if that’s what you’re asking. I am happy it happened.”
“Not really,” she admitted, “But I still have to go, so. All the latest reports have been uploaded to your server… Do you have anything you want to ask about?”
By now Tony’s regular thoughts were beginning to filter through. Not that the urge to throw himself into Steve’s chest had worn off at all… But Tony was starting to think of other things as well. He began cataloguing the important details of the situation, trying to put them in order.
He could only remember growing increasingly distracted by his own discomfort as he argued with himself, bouncing between the fact that he obviously couldn’t drink anything on this planet, and the fact that he couldn’t actually go for four days without a drink….
“Good,” he purred against Tony’s throat - waiting until he felt Tony's arms fall heavily to his sides again, before he dug his fingertips hard into his thighs. “I
“His fault! He threw it!” Bucky gestured wildly towards Tony, as Peter began to stalk across the patio.
just going crazy - or had fallen victim to some entirely separate curse, let’s not show research bias - but
However nervous it made him, however unlike him it was, however much he might later regret it, Tony knew the right response was,
He could just have easily found himself loitering in the parking lot of the Navy Hospital, or sitting on the wall outside Frank Fitzgerald’s bakery, or standing by the subway sign on Futon Street. It could have been any date between 1935 and 1943 - as long as it wasn’t snowing.
By now, he’d completely forgotten his plans to take notes when this happened - but he was very aware of it happening.
“What happened?” Steve demanded, cataloguing the blood and bruises he could see on Tony’s arms and chest and neck. That crescent moon cut that seemed to appear under his eye after
Steve took a deep, shuddering breath, trying in vain to contain this wave of emotion, suddenly panicking that Tony would think he was upset-
“Oh, nothing bad – I just keep feeling… I don’t know, they almost feel like muscle cramps? In my shoulder, mostly…”
to say instead of ‘weird’, or…” He seemed to catch himself, just as he was getting carried away. “Sorry,” he said again, dropping his eyes.
Steve had spent so long wishing that he could just apologize for what happened in Siberia - that, maybe, in his wildest dreams, he and Tony might one day be able to talk
He literally couldn’t remember why, but he was sure the arc reactor was… Significant, when it came to sex. That Tony usually felt a very specific way about it, that it always got a certain
“I can’t think about this right now. This is… just… a lot, and I can’t just answer you… right away, like this.”
It was a feeling that soaked into him - like being sun-drunk. A warm, heady relaxation that softened his limbs and made everything comfortable and pleasant and… nice…
In one instant, Tony felt that curl of shame, that anxiety about how it must’ve looked in the cold light of day, that crisis of identity as he struggled to imagine himself doing it-
“I was just thinking that I love every single thing about you,” Steve replied, casually. A pretty blush appeared over the bridge of Tony’s nose as he lowered his eyes, shyly.
“Look, if it’s worth anything to you – I really am just a doctor,” Stape explained, in a pleading tone. “I’ve spent my entire life trying to make sick people better – and your blood, the things it could do for medical science… I’m just trying my best to help people, and I wouldn’t
“I love you,” he breathed, still barely able to speak. And then he lifted Tony gently, lowering him back onto his feet – letting Tony fall into him, when his legs proved too shaky to support him.
They were already walking under the entrance banner when Nat tugged against Steve’s grip, bidding him to stop. When he turned, Steve discovered that the others were all red faced and breathless - more from giggling than from the walk.
He sat up, and ran his hands through his hair, and stretched. And listened. After a second or two of total silence, Tony felt sure that Steve was still sleeping. He wasn’t sure why he was relieved, but he was. It was only a few minutes alone with his thoughts… but he’d take it.
Of course, what actually happened was that Steve spent the first two hours trying to manage the warring factions in his own head - the conflict between his newfound determination to relax and his deep-rooted instinct to
“Yeah, I really don’t know what that was about, by the way” Steve told him, somewhat enthusiastically “Your dad didn’t even like me that much, I swear – well, he never acted much like he did…”
that Clint had been watching his every move since he’d first arrived. A few times, Steve had caught a glimpse of him - just a movement in the shadows, far above his head. Other times, it was a feeling that he knew who he was being watched by. Most of the time, it was nothing at all, not even the slightest clue that anyone was there-
“And the fact is I’m just not smart enough to beat you at that game” Steve told him, with a soft little laugh “I just… Today, I tried to tell you I thought you were smart. And first you put yourself down, to distract me. Then you bigged
to understand what he meant, and… And at first, he just kept them, and he wasn’t cruel to them, and he – it was my
“Oh, I do,” Tony pre-empted his inquiry, “And, actually, I still have to – although not as much. I can use nutritional fuel really efficiently, so – but yeah, there still needs to be
And he hated the world, for the fact that he could never make Steve love him back, for the unfairness of it. Knowing that however hard he tried, Steve just didn’t care about him-
And Tony remembered too late that he wasn’t supposed to be ‘testing’ Steve, and hadn’t left himself time to work out if this impulse was spiteful or reasonable… so the response came out faltering, and hesitant,
This wasn’t something he could sweep under the rug with a blunt ‘there’s no way to know what’s going on’.

to panic about being caught… although, to be honest, that instinct was starting to wane, as… he just became more comfortable in the situation-
to slow down, trying to let Tony breathe… Still rocking into him, urgently, kissing the side of his face messily, “You’re beautiful when you come”
“There’s also another USB; literally all the files from the Facility are on there.” Tony carried on “And we wrote a rough guide to the plan on the back of a drug pamphlet – you should probably read
He answered it purely to shut it up – it was just one thing too many. He wasn’t even planning on waiting to find out whether it was Pepper or Rhodey. Whichever one it was, they’d just have to understand that he couldn’t do this right now. He’d already opened his mouth to say it-
And he looked at Steve, lying on his back, still drifting in and out of awareness… that pretty, happy smile on his lips…
And then an entirely different thrill ran through Tony’s body, and he had to freeze and bite down harder to keep himself from coming.
had crawled its way into everything else since Tony was a kid, like the roots of some poisonous weed that Tony had never been able to pull free because then everything else would crumble-
He looked over to see if Tony was listening to him – his best guess was that Tony was trying very hard to…
Steve almost smiled to think of where he’d be right now, if he’d followed his original programme to the letter.
She smiled and shook her head – there was no money allowed at The Facility. It was all covered by the not insignificant fee that Tony had stumped up to ensure this in the first place.
“I know” Vanessa answered quickly, and then caught herself “I mean, I know I’m not supposed to know – first names only and all that, but, you know I know, right? I mean, I didn’t know you two were…” And she gestured between them.
And, oddly enough, it was the exact same image that flashed up in his mind. Him, naked and pleading and offering himself up… Steve, stroking his hands over Tony’s skin… Strong, and commanding, and kind…
“So, yeah, you ready?” Tony muttered, glancing over to his equipment and then back to Bucky. And Bucky just grinned, and put his feet up on the examination table, and stretched out.
a big deal, and before I knew you… And then, when I did get to know you, everything changed,” he sighed. “Before that, I just thought Vampire was another word for super soldier. I knew the blood drinking thing was a bit creepy… But that’s basically all I thought I was keeping from anyone. And then there was just this… Draw to you. And this… desire to protect you. And then that thing with the photographer, and… And then I realised I didn’t know
Steve’s breath hitched pitifully as his cock throbbed hard again, grabbing hold of the sheets with his free hand, gripping so tight that his fingers went numb. Trying to disperse some of this agonising intensity.
firmer now, sending a low roll of pleasure through Steve’s flesh. Steve moaned, deep in his chest, briefly torn between pushing himself up into Tony’s hands and pushing down against the sheets-
And then Tony pushed deeper, past the back of his throat, taking his entire length. The head of Steve's cock was suddenly engulfed by that impossible tightness, a searing pleasure shooting all the way through the core of him, piercing deep into his muscles. He let go of a shuddering cry, his hips already rocking upwards as that initial hit rolled through him, his body acting on autopilot,
And when he thought of himself, consumed by anxiety because of a physical urge to ‘take care of Steve’, or pacing the halls of the Tower in anticipation of Steve moving in, or that instant, dizzying attraction he’d felt the second he laid eyes on him…
He remembered that he’d cleared the room with a sonic blast rather than a spray of bullets - because he couldn’t risk hurting Bucky. Tony was sure he would always remember that detail, because he’d been so intensely, sickeningly focused on it at the time. He’d repeated it to himself, over and over, as the jet neared the landing site,
much like he was speed reading. But, with a lot of effort and the last dregs of the drugs, Steve was able to make his way through a good few pages of background information… He pushed himself until he realised he’d just read the same sentence three times, and recognised that he’d reached some sort of limit. That he’d better say what he
And, with that, Steve realised that this might even be a weakness – that, maybe, loving Tony like this would give him all sorts of vulnerabilities that he hadn’t had before.
… I have spent most of that time with you thinking I’d like to sleep with you…” And Tony broke out in a grin when Steve said that, which felt like a
But Tony remained still, and calm and in control. He took a few seconds to consider Steve’s face, his gaze lingering on Steve’s lips before he kissed him again –
weak, to have given in like that. That maybe there wasn’t even anything for Tony to look past, that maybe Steve didn’t have to feel guilty or ashamed at all.
None of it had worked. None of it had even seemed relevant, like they were all words from an alternate reality…
“Oh my God, me too” She told him enthusiastically, her previous embarrassment completely swallowed by her drunken confidence. “I’m Vanessa, by the way.”
He just whimpered into the sheets, chained down and spread open and just letting Tony fuck him. That pleasure in him building faster now, like it pushing up at his skin, concentrating deep in his muscles as Tony fucked more and more of it into him – until he felt like he was physically, bodily full of this sensation, until it pushed right up at the very limits of it, the very edge of so-good-it-almost-hurt
And then Steve looked up at him, his gaze sharpening, whatever tension he could muster gathering towards Tony-
A montage of well meaning strangers scrolled through his brain, reciting a list of support groups and help lines and offers to talk, if he ever needed anyone… All of which would be more of a chore than a comfort.
“If I ever give it another go, I’ll let you know – you can tell me whether it’s good food done terribly.”
And Tony saw Zan flinch. He was sure Steve must’ve seen it too. But, obviously, as per the plan, Steve pretended he hadn’t.
Steve felt Tony melt in his arms, his hands still gripping frantically at Steve’s hair even as the rest of him was overwhelmed. Steve barely broke the kiss as he laid Tony back into the sheets, lying on top of him, pining Tony between his legs. He felt Tony whimper softly against his mouth, a sharp tingle in his lips that set of a sudden flush of heat all over his skin-
But more than that, it was the overwhelming freedom of being able to say it back. Being safe enough, and sure enough, that he could just let it fall out of his mouth-
And he thought, if he just nodded his head… Tony would stop this, and unchain him and take the tape off of his mouth, Steve knew he would…
For a few seconds, the workshop was full of the sound of anguished panting, as each of them tried to calm themselves down. Steve just about managed a breathless
And in its place, there was only this warm, heavy feeling of total comfort, washing through him like water. Tony’s body collapsed from under him, falling as a dead weight into the couch. And for an endless moment, he just felt as though he was floating, suspended in this thick, heady sensation.  Everything felt good. Every inch of him throbbed with pleasure, every shapeless thought that drifted through his head was happy.
The only question now was whether Tony was going to ignore Nat’s instruction to bring drinks back with him...
he own those two nice shirts, and a pair of outdoor shoes? What had he been thinking when he bought those? Was there some instinct that human beings are born with, the way starlings know to collect sticks for their nest – a biological impulse to acquire a cold weather coat, and hang it in a wardrobe?
“Depends what you mean by difficult…” Steve muttered. Tony raised his eyebrows in a friendly, questioning gesture – and, even though it would be a tedious topic of conversation, Steve grabbed at it with both hands. “We have to meet with the new Washington liaison. He wants to talk to us about
“You really don’t believe that someone could love you this much?” Steve whispered, still committed to defending Tony even when his brain was mainly white noise.
“You’re going in!” Bucky yelled as he chased after him and back into the palace. Steve watched him go, a nostalgic smile on his face the whole time…
Steve could feel it fluttering under his ribs as he struggled through those last few strides, tingling sharper in his jaw as he stretched out to try and grab the side of the pool -
Steve’s hands caressed over Tony’s hips, his thumbs tracing the line of his groin, encouraging Tony to part his legs. By now Tony’s lungs were burning, an aching desperation throbbing from the small of his back to deep in his thighs. He was so tense and breathless he could barely get the words out,
he was going to see Tony Stark again. Why Bucky couldn’t just go on his own. Even if she didn’t ask him, she’d want to know… And Steve felt uncomfortable with that question being out there at all.
? Even though, really, he already knew what had grabbed Tony’s attention. He hadn’t thought about it when he was saying it, but he recognised it now…
“Tell you what,” Tony suggested, putting his notes aside with a flourish. “Why don’t I make us more coffee, and we can talk about superhero ethics for a while instead - I’m bored of intelligent virus design for one night.”
“Hey,” he said, softly. And he heard Steve take a little breath, and he could swear he felt his heart clench.
He’d collected two and a half pints within an hour of Tony’s call, telling himself it was because the med lab was likely to be deserted at this time of the morning…
And Tony warned himself to pay attention. That, now more than ever, he had to know as much as possible about the drugs in this place.
Steve lifted his head, blinking away the shadows so that he could look at Tony again. He recognised a hot, bodily thrill, distinct from all the other physical pleasures, as he watched Tony stroke his hand over his cock…
, however vulnerable Steve felt right now, however genuine his fear of hurting Tony, he was still going to say
Nick actually smirked. Which was infuriating, of course - but not in the same league as everything else Steve had to be angry about. It began pinching in his head as soon as Nick closed the door. Vicious, hot little thoughts that seemed to pull a piercing irritation up through his skin.
Steve managed a deep, shuddering breath. He found himself at the centre of this swirl of lights and colours. He began to process his surroundings, one item at a time.
three seconds, before a man in a white suit appeared from the opposite corridor, smiling directly at Steve.
, if he only felt confident to tell them all these because he knew they weren’t going to remember it
here, a connection he needed to find and analyse, a train of thought he had to finish, a feeling he had to find a name for… Something.
“You were going to say, ‘you were never normal’,” he asserts, confidently. Steve’s eyes flash with recognition, his lips parting in amused surprise as Bucky clarifies, “that’s the joke you were going to make. That you would’ve made… before…”
Steve’s day hadn’t been any more productive than Tony’s – although, by the time he got home, he didn’t have the energy to storm out of the elevator. Instead, he sloped in wearily, letting his jacket fall heavily from his arms.
you know where you’re going to go from here, what you’re going to do for the rest of your life,” She placted, “but trust me, whatever it is, you can’t do it on your own. You’re going to need someone-”
He’d hoped to get further through this process before he had to drink again. He knew that the moment he tasted Steve’s blood, his perception would shift – and he had no faith whatsoever that he’d resist the temptation to call Steve
“I tried…” Steve whispered… but the thought of finishing that sentence was suddenly overwhelming. If he couldn’t take the blame, if he couldn’t spiral into all the things he wished he could have done… Then he was just left with what had actually happened. How he really felt about it. And the idea of having to go through those events again, trying to find the words for all those conflicting emotions, struggling to decide whether he should say he was hurt or angry-
hate when people do that. And…” He took another little breath, a blush colouring his cheeks now, “Honestly, even more embarrassing than that… I probably
With that in mind, he refocused himself on what he was really here to do. As subtly as he could, he looked to make sure that no one was watching him…
to be watching the news. He even knew that it was good for him in the long run, that he felt better for having some first-hand experience and opinions on the last seventy years, that it did help him to feel a part of the world…
, which would be worse than him just ignoring me mostly,” Steve went on, like the words were being physically dragged from him. “And you’re wrong, anyway. He probably
Helpfully, his brain decided now would be a good time to pick at this wound. Maybe it recognised that no amount of thinking or planning or Captain America-ing it would
Tony could feel the outline of Steve’s cock, pressed hard against his thigh. He could feel the blood pumping hotter and faster under Steve’s skin. He could hear the little pleading notes in Steve’s breathing.
Steve smiled, and kissed him again, before lifting Tony and turning to lie him flat out the couch. Steve knelt between his legs, looking down over him, watching his chest rise and fall-
It was such a mundane, functional consideration, for someone who’d just that second stepped out of fairyland-
the way I love you, and there isn’t anyone I’ve thought about more than I’ve thought about you. And, if I ever lied to you when you asked me what I was thinking, it was almost always because I was thinking about you – and I know it sounds ridiculous for me to say, why didn’t you know I cared about you, when I was always so scared of you finding out how much I cared about you, how much I – wanted, you…”
Hoping that Bucky was okay wherever he was, that he’d managed to find some happiness in that broken world.
As Steve carried him those few broad, slightly clumsy steps to the bedroom, Tony could literally feel himself losing hold of so many trains of thought. He simply didn’t have the capacity to overthink this in the way he probably should, he wouldn’t have been
to let that calm settle in, to fight against the wave of euphoria and comfort that he associated with that taste-
The short version of the story is that half my work got pinged by the Covid App, and we've all had to rearrange our rotas on no notice - which has involved me picking up some night shifts, and screwing my sleep schedule totally, amongst other things 😆 So a few things had to get rearranged in the short term.
“Well, he could never think of anything to say that wasn’t about you, if that makes you feel any better” Tony added, as a meaningless piece of neutral chatter.
Steve placed his hand over Tony’s, gentle but firm, and guided him to lay his palm over his heart. For a moment Tony just absorbed him. The rhythm of his pulse, the rise and fall of his chest, the warmth of his skin…
He went back to all those individual thoughts that he’d not been able to listen to, while Tony was there…
So, firstly, I am very sorry that this update comes two whole days later than promised - it ended up taking far longer than I was expecting to catch up on everything. However, I HAVE caught up, at long last - so the next update is still due on the 18th. Many thanks for your patience, and apologies again.
But what was the use? It wasn’t even as though he had an alternative plan to try to convince them of.
Jesus, Tony felt that look at the pit of his stomach. That completely honest affection and awe, and desire, still – all entirely for him.
He barely even heard it when the security guard let go of that oh-so-familiar sigh, and uttered a phrase that Tony had heard a thousand times - and always in that same weary, superior tone of voice.
And now that he knew that, his brain jumped in to keep up. A human instinct to place this emotion, now that he’d named it. He
A strange, high-pitched giggle bubbled over Tony’s lips, followed immediately by a snort from Bucky. Tony felt something inside him slip, setting off a shuddering chain reaction that ran up his back and gathered in his shoulders - but still, he tried to contain it. He swallowed hard, trying to douse the mirth simmering up in his chest. He took a deep breath as subtly as he could. He tried telling himself that it was an old joke, an obvious joke, that it wasn’t even funny… And when that didn’t work, he tried quieting his mind completely…
“Uh… Honestly, nothing I can think of,” Steve shrugged. “I mean, I’ve been very well provided for, so far…”
“It wouldn’t, obviously,” Tony answered, irritably. “Otherwise I wouldn’t have called him. It was just… a stupid thing I said while I was working. It was a joke, that’s all,” and he threw his arms out helplessly,
And then, without really noticing, he’d finished his meal, and when he looked up he saw that Tony had also cleared his bowl.
“You feel bad because you can’t donate blood?” Tony enunciated, not sure himself what tone he was aiming for. And he saw Steve swallow, and he
Thankfully, Steve seemed to understand what he was getting at - because Tony was still far too shaky and uncoordinated to actually undress Steve himself.
at the idea of any man taking it upon himself to spike the water supply with that… until after it happened.
Steve lifted Tony into his chest, so that he could turn and lie him out on the couch behind him. Tony grabbed at him instantly, pulling Steve on top of him by the front of his shirt. And then, as soon as Steve kissed him again, Tony ran his hands up along his back, under his clothes, stroking the flats of his palms over Steve’s bare skin. Steve shivered, and immediately moved to shrug his t-shirt up over his shoulders, wanting to feel more of Tony pressed against him, not wanting anything in the way. Tony caught on quickly, snatching at the shirt and tugging it over Steve’s head. And then Tony’s hands were all over him, caressing desperately over Steve’s arms and shoulders and chest, his eyes wide and dark and his lips just slightly swollen…
And then the gentlest touch against the inside of his thigh, like an static shock that shot all the way through to his spine – his legs falling apart before he’d even processed that that was the instruction. And then he felt the mattress dip beneath him, as Tony settled himself between Steve’s knees. And then Tony’s palm on the back of his neck, cool and comforting and confident… like a balm….
heard that word recently,” Tony explained. “But I’m sure that wasn’t it…” As he always did with questions that he couldn’t immediately answer, Tony turned to Jarvis, “J, why do I know that name?”
thought you should tell me, and Sam said no. Sam already told me that – still defending you… And, do you know what, that isn’t good enough. That’s not a decision you get to hand off to
Steve whimpered, and gasped, and writhed helplessly against Tony’s hands, as Tony dropped his head to lap at him again, shorter and sharper, the tip of his tongue pushing into him before it swept deftly along the edge of his hole, and then again, and again.
feels,” Steve teased, his mind flashing back to that hotel room in Paris, and the sound of Tony purring,
The last time that Tony had been angry and hurt enough to hit something, he’d chosen to hit Bucky. The one part of the whole sorry affair that he felt ashamed of. The thing that meant, after trying that hard and losing that much, Tony couldn’t even claim the moral high ground. Not completely.
about sex was still something of an issue. It had gotten a little easier in the last few years, but, yeah, still not his
– didn’t even look at me the whole time I was there, I get the impression he doesn’t want me there. I mean, he even answered
In fact, less than an hour after he got into bed, Steve gave up on the idea of resting all together. Trying to force himself to sleep had proven more stressful than simply staying awake – so, he got up. Without giving it any real thought, he pulled on some old clothes and headed down to the gym. Throwing a few blows at one of the punching bags had always been his go-to solution at times like this.
The pressure built in Steve’s hips as he let his mind run away from him, the immediate, visceral relief of contact finally giving way to warmer, lower pleasure.
In the grand scheme of things, it didn’t seem like that big an alteration to make to a timeline - not compared to letting Loki get away with the Tesseract, or stealing the Pym Particle in the 1970s. But now Steve found himself musing about the way that little change might’ve rippled into something bigger. What would’ve happened, if he hadn’t been quite so thrown by Tony’s ‘
“Bullshit,” Steve replied darkly. “You’re just trying to replicate the serum, like a thousand other people. Just trying to make yourself rich and powerful, without any thought to the consequences, just like them.”
maybe I’ll be able to work out what needs doing first, and how - so, to start with, I’m going to need you to make some notes…”
That he had met Steve, and been attracted to Steve, and liked Steve, and then fallen for Steve… just like people do. That a lot of this really wasn’t so different for vampires, at least at the start. That it really hadn’t been an instant blood bond, or an ancient supernatural draw to Steve… just a spark. A spark that grew into a friendship, and then a bond of trust, and then the vulnerable, desperation of genuine, human love…
Bucky didn’t think much of it, at first. At that point, he was still distracted by the previous conversation, and the conflicting ideas about what he should do about it.
Everything else, yeah – at least for the time being. Right now, as ridiculous as it sounded, Tony really could believe that he and Steve could have something. That it could balance out and be good and make sense… Even if it was all the product of this euphoria, even if it did evaporate in the morning, right now he could see it…
A wave of pleasure rolled through Steve’s body, hot and deep and needy. All the tension seemed to rush to his groin, his shoulders falling limp against the sun lounger as his hips braced up against Tony’s lips. He gasped, as Tony flicked the tip of his tongue over his slit, one hand grabbing mindlessly at Tony’s hair. Tony sucked against the head of Steve’s cock, before taking the length of him
He had to remind himself that he was out of practice when it came to human interaction. That he was trying to
“No, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t just…” Steve started, and seemed to lose himself in the middle of it – obviously so much more interested in something else.
Tony break this impossible anxiety into problems and tasks and solutions was… somewhat overwhelming, amongst other things.
Remembering every interaction they’d ever shared in one instant rush, suddenly seeing what should’ve been obvious at the time.
It was like all that love, and all that relief, all that released tension and hope and soothed hurt, was in this one kiss. Tony felt his body take over completely, every part of him trying to press closer, every sense just flooded with him.
This chapter makes a reference to the holocaust, as something Steve has seen that has changed his view of the world. There are no actual details or specific memories discussed.
“I don’t see why I should have to go along with this, just to avoid one,” she shot back. “Vision didn’t even
The thought of owning something like this, the simple idea that he wasn’t excluded from things like this-
“Look Steve, I know you’re one of those people that need space with things,” Bucky sighed, dragging Steve halfway out of his haze. When he opened his eyes again the room was too bright. It took him a second to focus on Bucky, now sitting in his jeans in the wicker chair at the end of the bed.
Partly, it was because he’d already decided to do this another way - and he’d spent too long thinking about this plan to throw any part of it away in a moment of passion.
love. A physical feeling, a simple, incorruptible feeling, beyond any string of complex thoughts and emotions that he’d been calling
Steve had spent his whole life judging everything he did, and everything he was, by how much better it could have been. He’d always been too focused on his obligations and his failings to see the rest of the picture.
Tony didn’t actually know what catastrophic outcome he was scared of, much less whether it was reasonable.
The times he could swear he’d seen Steve glance down at his wrist, or run his other hand over it, and wanted so much to ask him or reassure him or cover… but, obviously, that would’ve been suspicious.
one had come from inside his own head… Or if the lute-lele guy was actually singing about the inside of his head…
he should care so much… But, suddenly, Steve could see exactly what he’d been doing all evening. Trying to eat up the time until he saw Tony again, trying to do something with the excess of excitement – trying to find something he could control in the midst of this confusing situation.
“There is nothing you could do, or say, that would make me want this any less,” Tony went on. “There is nothing you
. And we can’t have something harmful disappear forever, because it’s what we know. You know, I’d say that was all pretty
“Well, I don’t know, maybe its not the same thing, but… I don’t know, the way I think young people talk is how everyone else expects elderly people to talk. I remember when I was maybe a week out of the ice, I referred to someone as a fella, and whoever I was talking to snorted this little laugh, like it was really… quaint, or something. But that wasn’t how it sounded to me…” And Steve noticed, as he was talking, that Tony was softening again, his eyes widening in recognition. It helped the words come easier. “And, I don’t know – even if I
“Because in seventy years’ time, I’ll still look like this – and he’ll be dying,” he sighed, bitterly. “And he’ll have to look back on all those wasted years, when he could’ve been meeting someone he
or whatever you want to call them, and, yeah, maybe I’ll have to put up with that. But, I’m not worried about it this time.”
“No, I get that,” Tony assured, easily – because he did. Immediately, he felt like he knew exactly what Steve was talking about…
talked about what he was talking about, without a single thought to whether it was appropriate or on brand – or even whether it was actually right. This was just what he was feeling
“Okay. So, I think I’m pretty safe just outright asking what all these drugs are” Tony went on, swallowing the smile down like it was medicine. “I mean, people
He watched, in slow motion, as Tony’s shock sharpened into confusion, and then – God, even worse – began to warm into something like
hated that the vampire thing was a secret. It had long since changed from feeling like his own personal business to feeling like a lie of omission, something he
Maybe it was something in the tone of Steve’s voice, or the little blush that coloured his cheeks, but Tony was suddenly more curious than he was irritated… If he’d been talking to anyone else, he might’ve called it ‘concerned’.
Instantly, Steve snapped back to focus on the photographer again, a literal growl rolling from somewhere low in his chest. Tony’s blood flashed hot at the sound of it, but he ignored that reaction in favour of a more pressing concern-
“Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you,” he smiled, kindly. “I was just hoping to catch you, when you got home.”
And, that much, Tony could’ve accepted as his famous bad luck. He hated going into situations blind, and he hated the idea of anything alien, and all in all he wished someone else could’ve done this. But that much he could deal with. That sort of thing he was used to.
And he would’ve liked to share the burst of enlightenment that came with it - he would’ve liked to share this perfect example of how alike they really were, and how they were both making the same mistakes… He’d have liked to be able to use this as proof of something.
Tony could tell, Steve was still a few minutes behind him. His lips were softened with sleep, his brow creased with confusion… But, when their eyes met, Tony could hear what he was thinking, as clearly as he ever had-
a lot he had to do, when he got home – and not just tonight. There were so many things he’d have to think about, so much work he’d have to do, so many changes he’d have to make. And it was going to be painful, and confusing, and imperfect. And it was going to take a
He was pulling Tony into him, caressing his arms over his back as he kissed him deeper, this desperate desire to –
Tony’s heart skipped a beat when he heard the door open, and then returned with a vengeance as he heard those familiar padding footsteps approach. And then he glanced up. And there was Steve
By the time he reached the Sanctum Sanctorum he was breathless and weary, hardly even aware that he’d run there at full speed. His physical exhaustion seemed fitting, like it represented not only his final sprint, or even this epic mission, but the struggle of his entire life up until this point…
be able to provide for Steve, and look after Steve, exactly as he was always meant to. There would come a time when Tony could ease that tension in Steve, and sate that hunger in him, and be a part of that power that was for him alone, now.
sweet, and… I’m just… sorry I forced that on you, when you’re just trying to be nice – you don’t have to go along with that, it’s okay, I know.”
The second wave of sensation crashed over Steve a moment after Tony stopped moving, like the wall of exhaustion that doesn’t hit an athlete until two feet
“Come on, let’s get this over with,” he said, cheerfully. “And if you’re a big boy, and don’t make a fuss, we can get ice cream on the way home.”
Now that he thought about it, he knew that Galileo had taken them on a walk through the city, from the sleek corporate building they’d apparently arrived at to their hotel. He had no idea how long the walk had been, or the route it had taken, because there were whole chunks of it where he’d completely zoned out…
plan, is to wait a little while longer, and then kill all the humans herself. And the workers. And then tell the Council that our family bravely stood up to this invasion – using Father’s research, that they’ve always denounced. Tell them that the humans enslaved the troops and killed them, and would’ve done more if it weren’t for us. Then no one would come after my Dad for the hostages, or the research. Then maybe they’d respect him, and us. She thinks the humans are going to mean the difference between us all going to prison, and us running the world.”
“Are you feeling any better yet?” Tony asked, turning to Rhodey first. He was pleasantly surprised by how normal his voice sounded.
Which was in itself enough to snag Steve’s attention. But when he looked more carefully, Steve could see that it was a candid shot; a badly lit 6x4 like the ones he’d found in all of SHIELDs 90s files… he couldn’t make out the details from here.
“I love you,” he smiled, just because he liked saying it so much. And because he loved the way Tony smiled when he did.
The fact Steve liked to walk to meetings, on the rare occasions that it was possible. That he liked the time
“Well, we weren’t playing an especially affectionate couple,” he winced through his smile. “And we weren’t playing a couple for very long, as it turned out… But yeah, that was uncomfortable enough that you really don’t have to worry that you added to it. Honestly.”
“Oh fuck-” Tony barked, cut short when he felt the friction of the couch pressed hard against his still-sensitive cock. And then he felt Steve’s hands pushed against the inside of his thighs, parting Tony’s legs, and Tony raced to surrender to it. He spread his legs, lifting his ass, already begging, “Jesus Steve I want you to fuck me, please fuck me, please-”
. I don’t know. I don’t think I’d be outside right now if it weren’t for Steve… and I don’t think I’d be outside right now if it weren’t for you. I don’t think there’d be a me for Steve to save, and if there was I don’t think he could have, so… I think that’s roughly what I’m trying to say,” Tony surrendered, accepting that those were all the words he had right now.
His mind slipped back into consciousness before he could open his eyes, his head still thick and heavy with sleep, his whole body still weighed down with exhaustion… his arms trying to reach out for something, his fingers curling against his palms.
like the sort of thing he used to beat himself up for. He even remembered agonising over these very issues, in another life - fighting the temptation to play favourites with his new team, telling himself that he had a duty to be Captain America for everyone equally, tying himself in knots trying to justify his loyalty to Bucky… Steve suspected that a past version of him would’ve at least felt uncomfortable with his total lack of interest in this-
Thinking about it now, that was probably a good way to sum up the crisis that Tony had fallen into since he last saw Steve – he didn’t know whether he wanted it to have made things better.
“The Avengers? Yeah, they’re fine. A few routine meetings, all went as expected – no international crimes or life threatening missions, this week,” she assured him, sounding amused. And then, oh so smoothly, she added. “I should ask
Which made this the first time Tony could acknowledge that Steve had an effect on him, in just that simple human way. To realise that maybe some of these new ideas and feelings were simply the result of
“Tony…” He begged, his voice high and whiney as he teetered on the edge again, some of the tension returning to his wrecked muscles as he tried to push against it. And then he felt the slightest stutter in that brutal rhythm, Tony’s fingers flexing around Steve’s cock as his thrusts became sharper and shallower…
“Hey,” Tony greeted him with a smile. “You hungry? I just remembered that grilled cheese sandwiches exist.”
clear cut, probably not. Even though I’m sure people here would be pissed at justice not being done, especially if that’s just normal justice to them… I’m pretty sure I’ll sleep okay, knowing I didn’t let a plague doctor get thrown into acid.” Steve just
He didn’t like how distant Tony seemed, how uninvested he was in the conversation - like he was talking to a stranger.
He’d spent the entire evening in his office, making sure all of his paperwork was up-to-date and getting a head start on next week’s workload. Wanting to make sure that he was as free as he could possibly be for their appointment tomorrow – that there would be no reason for someone to phone him, nothing he might be called back into the office to deal with… No reason for anyone to ask where he was on Friday night.
was specially blended for newcomers – it has a nice, smooth transition.” She explained, handing Steve and Tony a drink each.
He was saying it for himself as much as for Bucky. Making sure that caveat got laid down with the foundations of this thing. Because Steve wasn’t sure what was going to happen with Tony, or what it meant… But, if he was going to start working it out, then he might as well start here.
you doing?” Steve enquired, as he lowered himself to a sitting position behind Tony, glancing over his shoulder in a questioning sort of way,
Steve could push that line back. He wanted to be with Tony so much, he could accept a compromise… But he couldn’t
it all was, how each tiny detail added something to the atmosphere of the room, how it all came together to create an invisible sense of spectacle and excitement…. Even Tony was starting to tingle with anticipation - and
- I’m just saying… You have to be able to be upset, sometimes. You have to be able to let some things be about you,” and then he sharpened his features again, making sure to load his tone when he finished, “and you can’t keep holding yourself responsible for every reaction I might have.”
The air around them seemed to thicken. Time slowed and expanded, as Tony let his eyes run lower, over Steve’s shoulders, and chest-
I’m thinking that I’m above law as a concept, and that I’m against all regulation, and that I hate to follow orders – because that whole bit with me signing up to the army, the
“You have literally no concept of how much paperwork there would be, if anyone saw a frost-bitten Captain America standing on my roof,” he sighed. And then there was a pause. “So, when are they coming back for you?”
on this-” But Steve had laughed even harder at that, and then Tony’s giggles got the better of him, and then neither of them could talk for a good few minutes-
It wasn’t like Tony hadn’t made mistakes when it came to the people he loved, before now. Made choices that had hurt them,
But then he realised… All the time he’d spent in that ‘magical’ place, with all those drugs to enhance every sensation and all those incredible events to feel good about… None of it felt as incredible as this moment.
It didn’t erase the anxiety completely, of course. The hollow metallic clang of the doors still echoed in Steve’s memory, the smell of damp concrete was still closing in on him… But it helped to have Tony’s interested expression to distract him.
Pepper, he decided. This particular catastrophe - the immediate aftermath of it, at least - was definitely more of a Pepper thing.
Steve’s voice caught, his grip tightening sharply in Tony’s hair as he tensed up against his mouth, and came. Tony hummed softly against him, still sucking gently, swallowing until Steve collapsed back against the sheets, completely spent.
“I swear to God, you so much as cut me…” Steve breathed, his whole body tensing upwards, his heart pounding painfully in his head.
They’d spent most of the drive in silence. Steve had answered all of Sam’s well meaning questions as politely - and as briefly - as possible, until eventually Sam stopped trying.
Peirce nodded - but didn’t unbunch his shoulders. His eyes remained fixed on Steve with a rabbit-in-headlights level of focus, as he replied, carefully,
And Tony knew that if he tried to talk to Steve firmly, and maturely, and led in with a bunch of confident assertions about fixing these issues and helping Steve in the long run… just like his dad used to… Then Steve would no doubt feel like shit afterwards, just like Tony always did. And he’d resent Tony for telling him what
That a tiny little part of Tony would kind of want to tell him - Jesus, that was a terrifying impulse. Like standing on a high ledge and realising a little part of you really wanted to jump-
“No, I just…” Steve started, obviously still somewhat giddy. And then the dazed smile broke into a full out grin as he carried on, “I was just wondering if you’d thought about what you want for Christmas, is all.”
“Look, I know I don’t have any right to have this conversation,” Steve went on, more cautiously. “I just… realised I never had the right to take this conversation away from you, I guess. That it should’ve been your choice… So, if you just don’t want to hear this, that’s fine – I know this is the most inconvenient, awkward way I could have done this, but I
“I don’t think so,” Rhodey shrugged, “but like I said, I didn’t really see anyone to want to say anything to.”
…But, well. Fair’s fair. Tony had invented the stupid Alien-planet-card thing. He could hardly demand Steve talk about his feelings when he’d already refused to.
Except that, as Steve was standing up again, and pulling himself out of his own head, his eyes so happened to catch on the scrap of paper that was sitting on the desk-
the answer to your question. The fact is, after we saved the universe for everyone else, I was just left in a world without you - and I couldn’t bear that. And, thanks to you, I had a choice. Not the choice to bring the man I loved back, or to change the past we had together - but a chance to find that love again. The
drink the water,” Steve muttered, before he could stop himself. He felt the flinch from Tony, and the corresponding kick in the pit of his gut - the oh-so-familiar feeling of fucking it up with Tony, specifically.
He felt Tony groan against his cock, his movements getting harder and faster as he began to jerk himself off, taking Steve to the back of his throat again and again in time with his own thrusts. Steve could feel Tony’s desperation, moving in perfect unison with his own. He moaned, feeling that pressure swell inside him, pushing up against the very limit of him over and over-
It was only a few notes about the blood. When it was taken. The readings from the little heart monitor. A few details about the serum and measurable effects it had on Steve’s biology, all of which he knew by heart, by now.
any secrets between them now. Not even the fact that Steve loved him. Steve didn’t have to watch what he was saying, or think how to avoid certain topics before they came up, or try to think what he was going to do with his face-
That he didn’t want to tell Tony he was sorry so much as he just wanted to be able to say what he was thinking, however dramatic and impulsive and in the moment.
Whatever ‘it’ was, Tony only had to see it to know that it was something natural and reassuring and good…
, when standing in front of a clusterfuck of other people’s mistakes… Just acknowledging that for him was such a huge thing Tony had just done… and he probably didn’t even realise…
– but it just came out a whimpered string of A and G sounds. And then Tony moved to kiss lower down his neck, sucking hard enough to mark his skin, and lower, until he reached the curve of Steve’s shoulder. And then then he bit down again, just a
Steve knew those rosters well enough to be sure there was no ‘Natalie Rushman’ on shift today, either-
he remembered, in Bucky’s voice, before he’d even finished standing up. He tried to ignore it. He tried to tell himself,
But he shook the thought away for now, determined to concentrate on whatever Tony was about to tell him.
A recognition that he wasn’t just living for himself anymore – or, he wouldn’t be, if he ever got to share a life with Tony.
A muted alarm sounded in Tony’s head then. Or, no, maybe alarm was too strong a word for it – he was still far too spaced out to be
. I can join the Army, and sign up to SHIELD, and work with the Avengers, but that doesn’t irrevocably, undeniably make me a team player – but the
, and you weren’t like anyone else, and it wasn’t like falling in love with anyone else. It was… confusing, and painful, and I didn’t – I didn’t understand how anyone
Lying on his side a few inches from Steve, sleeping soundly, his face completely relaxed and perfectly still-
The swell emotion that rose up in Steve’s chest then was probably the only thing powerful enough to overwhelm the giggling. It surged through him as a sense of simple, wordless elation, an immediate recognition of everything that one line represented.
to pay you?” Tony corrected, with an air of impatience. He felt Steve take a step closer to him… The quiet power that radiated from him, that maybe only Tony could feel, at this stage…
question,” he continued, putting his coffee aside. “I need to lay out all the information, work out all the different variables in all the different problems -
Except nothing was okay now. For Tony at least, nothing had really changed since Steve had rammed his shield into his heart. Since the day Steve had explained that he’d
The little tug of novelty, the personal appreciation of the aesthetic, a basic human interest in what was going on… He’d felt all of that, the first time around.
They weren’t informing the authorities, because it wasn’t time to do that yet – they were only going to see if they could get an invitation to the third floor, and maybe meet the management team. Really, it was no further through the process than their break in, they were no more in need of back up, yet.
But at some point, a thought had occurred to him - a thought that didn’t immediately drift out of his mind, like all the others. A thought that kept repeating, the same words and intonation, on a loop… like a song he couldn’t get out of his head.
“…You said we could leave this until tomorrow,” Steve answered, weakly. Trying not to grin, in spite of everything.
He ran the flat of his tongue over Steve’s thigh, lapping the pool of blood from the crease of his groin, his other hand still holding Steve’s leg in a firm grip. Feeling that high building, that
That, even though he was sure there were things they had to talk about while sober, and things they’d have to work on when they got home, maybe Tony had really meant it when he said-
“Yeah, they left that side of things out of the comic books,” Steve smiled – deliberately indulging this.
“Okay, well, I should probably let you try to get some sleep,” Tony tried to joke. “You humans with your daylight hours and all.”
...The prospect of walking for a mile in this weather - in these outfits - was not an appealing one. Just visualising it was enough to gather the sweat along Tony’s back.
It was so strange - Steve was sure he’d spent the last twelve years of his life listing people he’d like to see again and landmarks he’d like to see as they were and long demolished places he’d like to visit one last time… Why couldn’t he think of any of them now?
“Well, let's at least try to… loop around,” Sam suggested, making a wide, unsteady arcing gesture with one arm.
Tony was still delighted by how happy Steve looked, every time he said it - and he’d said it a few times, since yesterday. He
And then Tony sucked hard, dragging the blood up through Steve’s body, physically ripping that pressure clean out of him. It was like a damn bursting. Suddenly all this excess feeling, all that pleasure and pain and longing, just rushed free of him, breaking him open at this point of entry. He lost himself completely, swept away on this tidal wave of sensation, helpless against the sheer abundance of perfect, limitless pleasure.
have bullied his way into this, and justified it even – it would’ve been quicker, and easier, and there was so much at stake…
He didn’t know where that thought had come from, and he didn’t have the capacity to analyse it greatly - but he felt it…
His hand reached out and took the flyer down from the fridge, just following an instinct to be as close to Steve as possible, to grab at whatever part of him was within reach. Tony ran a fingertip over the familiar sweeps and curves of Steve’s handwriting as he thought about him…
He couldn’t believe he’d actually let those feelings put Tony in harms way. That he’d let Tony walk into a mission that he
Steve let the heady strangeness of it wash over him; the power there was in surrendering, the liberation of total submission. The softness of Tony’s lips and the warmth of his mouth and the taste of him, all part of the same charged sensation. And then Tony broke away again, and Steve heard himself let go of a small, urgent whine.
A sadness at the realisation that this epiphany wasn’t absolute or immovable – that the issues he’d managed to ignore today hadn’t actually disappeared…
Steve took a sharp, shuddering breath and very pointedly told himself not to get distracted by that.
And then, just as it was reaching that tipping point, Tony saw it - like a life preserver thrown into a stormy sea-
It took Tony a few queasy, weightless seconds to find the horizon again, to make sense of himself in these entirely new proportions…
“No problem,” she smiled back. “Oh, and I got a call back from Sotheby’s by the way – apparently they don’t have a translation for the Baxter Book, so they can’t say one way or the other. But, honestly, I don’t think it’s going to get a lot of interest, so I think it might be worth picking it up anyway?”
it worked, how all of these thousands upon thousands of servers were connected to this shared global network…
Obie made him popcorn that night… Maybe three nights after he’d murdered him, Obie had made Tony popcorn, and come to find him in the den, and started on another of his softly spoken explanations…
many questions. Impossible questions. Ethical, philosophical questions with no right answer. Practical, physical questions that he’d never have the data to solve. Shapeless emotional questions that he didn’t know how to begin asking…
Steve went to carry on the joke; he almost winced and apologised and pretend-begged him not to. But then he registered the earnest expression that had suddenly appeared on Bucky’s face, and he stilled.
“Uh, no, not now,” Tony answered immediately. “I’ll have to modify some programmes first… set up some equipment…” Which wasn’t true. Honestly, he wasn’t even
just thinking of all the ways that we wouldn’t get pushed around this time, all the individual things I’d push back against…”
But then he’d grown up enough to question his fathers self-serving assertions, and learned the truth about the so-called ‘greatest generation’, and come to realise that no one was completely good like that…
involved in it,” Tony informed him. “You decided to get involved with it, so now the only question is how you’re going to get out of it. You think you stand a better chance siding with them, or with us?”
“You know what, Nick? Tony was kidnapped by terrorists, who wired a car battery into his chest and ordered him to make weapons for them - and he built a robot suit out of discarded missile pieces, and not only did he escape, he took down the terrorist organisation for good measure. And rather than thinking that was an astounding feat of bravery and brilliance, and thinking how lucky you’d be to work with someone like that, you decided to emotionally torture him. Really
The soft jolt though his bones brought him to his senses a bit…. Enough to recognise that Janine had brought him to a little side room, maybe twelve feet squared – just big enough to fit two little couches, facing each other. He was on one, and Janine was just sitting, patiently waiting, on the other…
Steve had been pacing in the same jagged pattern since they’d arrived back at Tony’s house, nearly an hour ago.
All of which was coming up against the growing, giddy observation that… this did seem to be going really well.
By the time they reached the bottom of the staircase, Maribelle was already greeting a group of people at the bar. They both paused, knowing they would have to wait for a better moment to intercept her – knowing there was no need to communicate that fact.
for a while, and then everyone just forgot about him. I don’t think there was a scandal or anything,” He shrugged. “It’s like, no one ever mentions Barbara Stanwyck anymore, but she was still working until the 1980s…”
At the time, Tony had been consumed by how nice it was to see Steve smile like that… But, now that he thought about it, he recognised where that smile had come from.
Steve allowed himself to grin, thinking of all the mysteries that his younger self would unravel with the help of his friends - thinking that, however many weird and wonderful possibilities he considered, he would never come up with something as strange as the real explanation.
“Here,” he gasped, as he lunged entirely gracelessly for the desk. Snatching the little tube up and pressing it firmly into Steve’s palm. Steve understood immediately, setting it aside deliberately. And then his grabbed at Tony’s shoulder, and his hip, and rolled Tony onto his stomach in one swift motion.
And he looked up at Tony, and they shared a sigh, and a shrug. A silent gesture of understanding… an understanding they’d never once spoken out loud. One of the bonds they’d
“So… Now what?” Bucky asked cautiously, snapping Tony out of his daydreams. Tony felt a phantom blush of embarrassment, as he realised that he had no idea how long he’d been lost in the middle distance.
He could find endless social and political metaphors for their situation, each leading to a different conclusion. All of them underpinned by unspoken assumptions that Tony could never quite pin down.
However, the immediate area was now otherwise deserted, and that would do for Steve’s purposes. Casually, he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a USB pen - which, of course, he had to turn upside down three times before it would click into place. And then, as he sat back in his chair, an unexpected swell of relief rolled up his back… and he realised.
Zan stood and fidgeted for a few moments. Tony glanced around the room, as casually as he could, trying to spot if anyone was paying attention to them. He didn’t
On the rare occasions that he’d dared to try for something more than a one night stand, for those rare people he believed he had the chance to build something with, it had always been Tony doing the chasing. It had always been him promising to move heaven and earth, offering to change any part of himself - whether he was able to see that through or not - for anyone who might
? I mean, could it really make everything worse, if you got to enjoy someone’s company for a little while…?”
He was so consumed by anger on Steve’s behalf, so hurt for him, so desperate to make it better and so frightened that he couldn’t
He had been swamped by that feeling of pure and simple rightness as he finally wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, the relief of feeling Tony’s bodyweight pressed against him-
“Okay, so, four weeks until Bucky is home,” Tony agreed, softly. And Steve was so overwhelmed with love for him, so elated to think that Tony was really
“Tonight’s is in… about an hour and a half” Tony informed him, squinting at the clock at the back of the room. “Assuming you want to go tonight. Or there’s a gangbang happening in The Blue Room. Those are our choices, apparently.”
“From who?” She asked, glancing around the room as though to illustrate her point. Tony felt his cheeks warming.
… Which was already proving harder than he’d expected, now that those reactions were actually there.
“You really don’t see why someone would like you?” Steve asked, sadly – but Tony was quick to correct him.
He clawed his way into Steve’s embrace, kissing him hungrily, his low moaning muffled against Steve’s lips. One hand found its own way under the back of Steve’s shirt as Tony instinctively sought out more of him, his mind running ahead to ideas of pushing Steve down on the couch and tearing that T-shirt off of him and running his palms over those beautiful shoulders-
It was the first time any of what they’d done had been presented to a completely sober mind. The first time Steve had any hope of putting it into the context of his life… his reputation, the expectations of him, the history of his life so far…
And then Sam stepped back to look into Bucky’s eyes, a smile tugging gently at the corner of his lips as he gave his head a tiny little shake,
deserve this,” Tony carried on, his tone just a little darker, as he shifted to straddle Steve’s hips. “You deserve to be celebrated for all the things you’ve done, and rewarded - you deserve all the nicest, most wonderful things in life, because you are the most extraordinary person in the world…”
. But to engage in something that shows no malice and causes no ill effect, if it pleases you, is not the same – however it is judged in the society you come from.”
“Yeah - I mean, either sounds good…” Steve replied, still answering on autopilot… his brow pinching in thought as he recognised the tense excitement simmering under Tony’s skin. Like there was something he wasn’t saying… “Why, are you hungry?”
They stopped to look at one another again. There was no question to be asked anymore – just a terrifying moment to be shared.
“Oh, I think it’s just scans of the paper file - but I didn’t look through those as carefully,” Steve admitted, apologetically. Tony looked up at him with a reassuring smile, before he stood up again and weaved his way over to one of the computer Towers.
It felt like being one shaky step from safety - the panic increasing as he edged ever nearer, the resolve building up in his shoulders as he prepared for the final leap.
Steve’s shoulders bunched with an irritated sort of weariness - a vague idea that he was too bothered right now to be bothered with anything…
relief of surrendering like this - like it had taken all his strength to keep himself from falling into this position, and he’d finally been allowed to let go-
“Hold the light over the floor, wait for the beep, press the button on the end there, and then drop it down on the floor…” She carried on narrating, even though Tony was doing it all ahead of her instructions.
“I accept this compromise…” Tony smiled. He let Steve’s shirt fall open, stroking his palms over the newly exposed skin before he leant in and kissed Steve again.
Tony pressed his body against Steve’s, barely breaking the kiss as he pushed Steve onto his back and crawled on top of him, Steve’s hips pinned between his knees. And then he pressed himself up on his arms, so that he could look down on Steve.
of him. The latent strength in Tony’s grip, the edges of rough skin on his fingertips, the warmth of his palm-
So, maybe the atmosphere was still having some impact on his moods. Maybe he was still thinking and feeling things he normally wouldn’t… Or, perhaps it was more accurate to say that he wasn’t feeling all the things that would usually be there…
of memory. It doesn’t just carve out a section of time and ‘take it away’. It’s a genuinely therapeutic drug. Take these people, for example.” And he gestured to the cells.
2. I hope it's made equally clear that Wanda is also in a very bad place, and that her outbursts are likewise affected by her grief - this really isn't intended to be an anti-Wanda statement, just an idea of what might happen if you get two very hurt, very angry people with a difference of opinion together at a party (spoilers, sometimes they fight)
After all these years, after fighting - and winning - the damned war, after getting married and then being
This was his claiming right, his reward. He needed to be reminded again and again. Tony was finally his.
Steve’s thoughts went back to the conversation he had overheard that morning at church, that gossiping group of friends. He couldn’t help but wonder if any of them ever spared a thought for the comfort of illegitimate children and their poor, damned mothers, beyond ones of contempt.
He ignored Tony’s leaking cock, which was achingly hard and begging for some relief, even gently slapping away Tony’s hands when they tried to wrap around it.
No, Tony decided. Rhodey would learn that Tony had sold the estate, that he was working for the man who had bought it, and nothing more.
Rhodes’ letters had always been such source of comfort to him. Each time one arrived, Tony would stop whatever he was doing and run off somewhere quiet to read it and respond as quickly as he could.
He sucked hard, moved his tongue around, exploring the veins on the side of Steve’s cock then drew back, bringing the tip of the cock almost to his lips and then swallowed it once more to the hilt. He buried his nose in Steve’s soft pubic hair, feeling divinely dirty, revelling in it. He couldn't stop this for the life of him.
Tony lifted a hand, cursing at it for shacking, and reverently touched the inside of Steve’s thighs. Steve was hot as fire under his fingertips. Carefully he grazed over Steve’s shaft, finding it already hard. He caressed the member over fabric and then tugged it out, mouth-watering at the sight, the proof of Steve’s desire of him. He closed his lips around the swollen head, hearing Steve’s startled cry above him. He rejoiced at tasting the bitter drops on his tongue before he swallowed deeper, hungry for more. Steve moaned, a sinful sound that had Tony struggling to look up to him once again. He was rewarded with the glorious sight of Steve looking down at him in wonder, eyes wide and mouth open in a silent o. What a spectacle they must present at that moment.
The deafening bang had the flock fly in the air in a million different directions. Steve lowered his shotgun, satisfied to see a duck lying on the far riverbank, its feathers scattered around like a morbid halo. The dogs barked and made course for the fallen prey.
“I can’t find Mr Johnson’s latest report,” Tony said, apparently to no avail, since Steve was too absorbed in whatever he was reading to respond to him.
Anyway, a thousand thanks to my wonderful beta reader EachPeachPearPlum, and to my equally wonderful beta/cheerleader AvengersNewB. I really love you guys ❤️❤️❤️
Steve made a conscious effort to keep his voice calm when he finally addressed Tony, afraid that the man would either close off entirely - or, even worse, flee again - if he felt pressed.
All this worry had been, unfortunately, keeping Steve from getting a much needed good night’s sleep. After tossing and turning in his bed fruitlessly for what seemed like hours, he finally decided to give up.
Steve couldn’t blame him. After all, how much different had his own behaviour towards Tony been? Steve could never forget the unforgivable way he had behaved towards Tony those first weeks he’d returned to the manor. He had tried hard to seem as cold as he could, to make it clear to Tony that their relationship was nothing more than a transaction, a business deal.
It was a rather chilly evening and, while Tony was leaning on Steve’s desk, finishing with the lord’s paperwork, Steve had spent it seated on an armchair by the freshly lit fireplace, sketching idly in a notebook.
“Utopia,” Tony whispered, tone tired. Today had been a tiring day and lately, sleep hadn’t consciously been a part of his schedule.
It had taken Steve almost two months of them being in each other’s company again -two months of them working together, of them
It took Tony a moment to answer. He sounded relaxed, content and almost asleep. “Hmm… What do you want me to say?” His voice was breathy, quiet, a siren song for Steve’s ears alone.
Stone sat in a chair near the lit fireplace, nursing his cup of tea with a leisurely air of contentment. He did not acknowledge Steve’s presence in any way, so Steve, not one to get flustered with etiquette, simply took a chair across from him and waited.
It had been easier to deal with at first. After seeing Tony again for the first time in years, the memories of their bitter parting had come to life, haunting Steve once again, but they had at least served in reigniting those feelings of hurt and anguish that had followed him for years. Steve had felt safe in his anger, his pain. Tony couldn’t hurt him any more than he already had.
No, it was something Tony arranged in secret, a meeting away from the house, - in an inn, of all places - with a man of whom the mere mention apparently made Tony bloom with happiness. He recalled something Tony said specifically:
He had made his decision based on bitterness and anger, expecting to meet only the shallow man that he had convinced himself Tony had been all along, only to be met by a worn but still kind-hearted version of the Tony he remembered.
Suddenly feeling spontaneous, he turned to the room again. “That’s enough work for now, Stark,” he said, finding Tony looking at him, bewildered.
Steve needed to take a step back and think everything through. He needed to strategize. No matter how hard he wished to, he knew he couldn’t afford to accuse an earl of assaulting a member of his staff - and Tony Stark of all people - without any evidence or witnesses.
I can't tell you how nervous I was of how this story will be received, with my lack of beta and english not being my first language and all... So thank you for the kind words! And please do comment if you like the story, I love to hear from you. It certainly gives me an extra push to write.
Tony secretly feared that Barnes’ coldness was due to him being privy to more of Steve’s secrets than the rest of their group of friends. It made him wonder which of Steve’s and his secrets Barnes knew. Was it the past? Or the even more humiliating present? His always careful -almost clinical- inspection of Tony every morning at the breakfast table certainly was telling enough. The thought of Steve discussing such things with Barnes… well, it wasn’t a pleasurable thought, that was certain.
He supposed it was unavoidable that his first appearance amongst them would stir such excitement. As a lord, Steve knew he had several societal obligations, attending church being one of them. Though he had, he admitted, been a little neglectful in exercising his faith since he had moved to the estate.
“I did some work on the property for Mr Coulson, a year or so ago. Unfortunately, by that time I no longer had resources to be of assistance in any other way. I fixed the pump to the well and some of the windows… Donated some old furniture, too,” he finished simply and happily went on with his tea.
Bucky had clearly decided he was going to speak his mind though, because he persisted despite the warning. “He has always been your weakness, Steve! I’ve known you for, what, nearly ten years now? All this time, you never did manage to move past him. I know he’s caused you a lot of hurt, Steve. But
On the story, I debated a bit about if it should stay only in Steve's POV but I honestly tend to write multiple POVs so... not sure if that will be the case with this story, but this chapter is written from Tony's POV.
It was only then, in the darkest hour of the night, after having spent hours basking in the pleasure of Tony’s body, that Steve finally allowed himself to admit he may have been blindsided by his tempestuous feelings for the man, after all.
This chapter was betaed by the wonderful EachPeachPearPlum, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart for her infinite patience with me.
Whatever their reason, they all chose -blessedly- not to engage Steve in conversation, seemingly content to observe him from a distance, while Steve chose to focus on the Reverend Phil Coulson’s sermon instead.
How low he had come. How he had found himself so weak in the face of the one who got away, too weak to let Steve go when he first declined Tony’s offer. That he had instead offered him something he knew Steve couldn’t resist. Something he had readily denied others who had previously asked.
“Sorry I’m late, my lord,” he mumbled, while feeling Jarvis silently judging him for his tardiness, as per usual.
Watching the way Tony’s frame all but swayed, struggling to stay upright, Steve decided it couldn’t be so. He might have acted a fool more than once in regards to his behaviour towards Tony Stark, but
, that it would have been impossible for him to simply walk away. When he thought of what Tony had said, though, he was left puzzled, alarmed, even. Tony had obviously arranged to meet someone, a man, under Steve’s nose. That name,
Of course, with time, he learned to adjust. Having Bucky around had helped considerably. He managed to become a constant presence in Steve’s life in a very short time, and then he met Peggy. In his late wife, Steve had finally found someone who could keep him grounded and sane.
When they got to the stables, they were met by an ever-diligent Peter carrying fresh towels, no doubt having guessed they’d both need to be patted dry after getting caught in the rain.
Up close, Steve could see that the door had been left ajar in what, not many weeks ago, would have seemed a clear invitation. Before Steve found the courage to reach for the doorknob, he heard Tony’s familiar voice and it made him freeze in his tracks.
“I never said it was,” Bucky replied, fixing Steve with a penetrative stare. “You’re still in love with him, aren’t you?” he asked slowly, more of a rhetorical question than anything else. “Even after all these years...”
The housekeeper, Miss Potts, was another example. No one could doubt her fondness for Tony if they caught the two of them bantering as they were prone to do. At first, Steve had been afraid Tony had been overly familiar with his teasing tone, that somehow he had been more involved with the young lady than was proper, her being a woman beautiful enough to rival even Lady Natalia in looks and manners. Very soon, though, he had realised their relationship was more akin to that of siblings than lovers.
Seeing Tony up close, his cheeks flushed in embarrassment, rubbing his hurt behind with one hand, Steve couldn’t help himself any longer.
“I like Mr Gibbins,” Steve protested. “He did a wonderful job with Admiral Johnson’s summer house. He has an eye for aesthetics and symmetry.”
Also, in case you were wondering what an occasional table was, in the words of my beta peach: "it's that small table that stands in alcoves and corners and serves no purpose other than being a place to put vases and ornaments and shit."😂😂😂
“...Because I have the distinct impression that she would greatly disapprove of this…thing you have going on with Stark,” he finished, lifting a daring brow at Steve.
“Yes, my Lord, that you did,” he uttered and then Steve was upon him, forcing him silent with a claiming kiss.
Jarvis still insisted on assisting Tony with getting dressed. Since Steve had brought his own footman along with him, the old butler had apparently decided he had nothing better to do in the mornings but tend to Tony.
Steve couldn’t possibly know anything about Stane, surely. How would he ever learn about the man? Though, to be fair, Steve had known of Stane’s existence as well as his involvement in the company.
Irritated, Tony got up and headed for the desk. He started going through the rest of the papers that were randomly piled there, all the while keeping himself from starting on a string of expletives that, if said aloud, would definitely escalate the situation.
But still Tony was denying anything wrong had happened and Steve knew that it could only mean one thing. That he didn’t trust Steve, at least not enough to confide in him and seek his help.
“Must you leave already?” Tony whined, but Steve could already hear the lady’s light footsteps coming closer to the door.
He cleared his throat, turning his attention to Peter to give the boy the reins and exchange them for a dry towel. He pretended he didn’t notice the unwavering interest with which Peter was watching his and Steve’s interactions.
Bucky took a gulp of his drink. “No, nothing’s wrong,” he denied, not convincing Steve for a second.
Shaking his head, Steve forced on a smile. “I’m perfectly fine, Timothy. I just have a lot on my mind, that is all. You know me, all duty and no fun...”
