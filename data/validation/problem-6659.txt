“Now we have to figure out what to do with you,” Sam says with a sigh, “I’m not actually keen on spending any more time in this rotting rathole. And there’s always the danger that my cousin will come to check his property.”
“What can I do for you, Captain Rogers?” he asks, eyes soft and kind, smile welcoming, as Steve enters the room. T’Challa is sitting at the table, holograms glittering behind him. He had been working, and Steve feels bad for taking the future king’s time.
“You’ve got a bad timing, Rogers,” Tony says, and he doesn’t quite sound like himself. He refuses to meet Steve’s eyes, for start. “I’m needed in a meeting. My assistant will show you around.”
”We'll deal with Barnes. Don't worry,” Natasha reassures Steve, pats his arm. ”But I have to tell you, I never saw you and Stark coming. Who are you and what have you done to Steve Rogers?”
No, even though Captain America had ceased to exist the moment he had dropped the vibranium shield for Tony to pick up and hang on his wall, Steve Rogers is still a man of action.
The morning comes, and Tony barges into the kitchen where the early birds, Steve and Natasha, already sit.
”You're not my Steve. I can tell that – you look older. You look like you've lost a part of yourself. But you're Steve. Tell me, what happened?”
Then, Tony runs off to lick his wounds somewhere else. Probably the workshop. Steve leaves him be, knowing Tony wouldn't let him in either way. He retreats back to the couch, calls Natasha – no news – and then starts a drawing that quickly turns into a picture of Sam holding the Captain America shield.
“I don’t want to,” says Sam gruffly, “And what about you?” Then, something dawns on him. He turns to Steve, gasping,
“Ever since…” Steve continues softly, “Ever since the battle of Manhattan. First, I thought he was some self-centered jerk. Well, he gives that first impression to everyone, but there’s so much more to him. I latched on to him after battle. Everything was… him, and it never stopped. I loved him in silence. Still do.”
Steve grasps her shoulder, offering her comfort. He knows well enough how it feels like to be kept apart from people he cares about.
”Carol… Carol is a friend of Fury's,” Steve explains, pulling Tony closer to him. Tony comes willingly, landing on Steve's lap.
Wasting no time, Steve is on his way. He half-jogs to Tony and his breath is caught in his throat as he sees
He knows he needs to tell Tony about how his parents died. The sooner the better. But should he warn Thor about Loki soon ruling Asgard in disguise, T'Challa about his cousin wanting to take over Wakanda? Perhaps he should, but Steve has no idea how to contact the men.
“You know what!”  Tony turns to Steve. His eyes are dark, his mouth in a fierce grimace. “I would have helped you! If you’d come to me, I would have helped you with Barnes! See what I did? I came after you in fucking Siberia! If you had just told me-“
Steve doesn’t go with Sam and Wanda. He stays sulking in the cabin, unable to let go of the silent phone. Not even Shuri has texted him an update on Bucky. Frustrated, Steve huffs and throws himself on the bed, stares at the stained ceiling.
There are things coming. Ultron. The accords. Destruction of Asgard. Wakanda. And Thanos. They all seem like domino pieces, tumbling over each other until they reach the worst possible outcome.
Tony is working on improving Sam's wings and Steve – Steve draws. That’s almost all he does. What he draws, well. He could fill hundreds of sketchbooks with only pictures of Tony. He draws other people, other things, too, but he always comes back to Tony.
He’s staring at Tony, who’s stepped back so that he’s standing half behind Wanda. Tony’s eyes hold a cold defiance in them. He’s fiddling with his wristband, as if he’s readying for calling a suit.
“Yeah, well, T’Challa would murder us all if we endangered you and let you smuggle Wanda out. Come on, back to your room,” Bucky answers her.
“Are you sure you don’t want to redesign your suits? I really have some good ideas,” Shuri is saying while peeling an orange.
Tony lets go off Steve's hand he had been holding in his lap. ”I need time to think,” he says glumly, ”I just wish you'd told me sooner, you know?”
She settles right in ‒ befriends Wanda in a second. She even starts to get along with Tony, who’s still not convinced that she’s more of a genius than he is.
Tony looks the same. A little more worry lines on his face, a little less light in eyes, but otherwise, the same.
As he caresses the face of the sleeping love of his life, free from all the worries, Steve remembers the grim place he has come from.
Tony's kiss takes Steve's thoughts away from the things to come. They kiss like they're each other's oxygen, Steve pulling Tony flush against him by his waist.
Steve has been slowly inching his hand towards Tony, not sure if he wants to grab his hand or place it on his thigh.
Steve does something brave. He reaches to place his hand on Tony’s cheek, slowly and gently, seeking consent in Tony’s eyes. Tony doesn’t flinch away, he stares at Steve, transfixed.
Throwing one last scrutinizing look at Steve, Natasha lets it go. Probably thinks he's thinking about Bucky, but Steve's mind chants
Natasha squints at Steve, a little too long for Steve's comfort. ”I thought you and Sam were going to look for him?”
Tony, maybe sitting on the edge of a couch, leaning slightly forward, shoulders tense, eyes closed, as he says, “
”I thought you were my only chance,” he said, ”Then I had another. I screwed it up. And I lost him, for good.” His voice broke, then. ”Peggy, I lost him. He's
”Yes,” Natasha says, leaning back on her chair. Every time Steve hears her speak, he thinks of her last words to them.
“He came to visit us, you know,” says Clint as they’re on their way to his farm. Sam is piloting the ship, humming to himself to fill the quiet. Wanda is dozing off, and Clint had been inspecting his arrows, brow furrowed, for the past half an hour.
“Then you might as well call me T’Challa,” T’Challa answers, gesturing Steve to take a seat next to him. “Now, tell me, what’s on your mind?”
“No, Rhodey, I don’t think so! Yeah, the kid told me he doesn’t want to be an Avenger after all, but he’s still rounding up on me! You know what, today he’s called Lizzy three times ‒ three times, Rhodey! Have some mercy on your niece, Jesus Christ… Niece, cousin, it’s the same.”
Jarvis must alert Tony of Steve's presence, as Tony is suddenly looking up, eyes locking with Steve's.
“How was your day?” Steve asks in turn, eyeing Tony’s profile. Judging by the shadows under his eyes, he’s in dire need of sleep at least.
A soft patting of feet snaps Steve out of his spiraling thoughts. He glances at the digital clock – time has ran by and it's nearly midnight.
“What? Do you think you can walk across the continent of Africa and then swim across the Atlantic Ocean? I doubt even Captain America could do that.”
Tony doesn’t answer. He takes deep breaths, making Steve grow worried. What if this is causing him an anxiety attack?
Steve doesn't know if Tony’s ever going to feel the same Steve feels. It doesn't matter: Steve takes what he can get. Tony – warm and alive, heart beating. Holding him in his arms had felt heavenly. If that’s what he's going to get, he'd work with that.
”Home?” Natasha repeats, confused. ”What exactly is home to you? That miserable apartment of yours?”
It’s then when Sam returns, throwing the phone back to Steve. “He almost hung up on me,” Sam states, “but let me talk with some assistant. They’ll come and pick up Wanda tomorrow, from the gas station we visited.”
”Don't worry about him,” Steve whispers against Tony's lips, ”He's gone, sweetheart. He's gone. You're safe.”
Steve is used to Tony calling him Cap or Rogers, but he rarely goes for plain ‘Steve’. Suddenly, Steve’s heart beats a little faster. “Might be,” he says, locking eyes with Tony. He then realizes how close they are. Steve could count Tony’s eyelashes. He leans forward, sees the confused, slightly unsure look appear in Tony’s eyes…
Bruce's words ring in Steve's ears as he stands outside Peggy's house. The day is lovely, the sun is shining and a cheerful group of children is riding their bikes past Steve, their clear and innocent voices laughing.
The evening of that same day, Steve and Tony end up alone in the living room. Tony’s had a long day ‒ meeting after meeting, and he’s had to deal with Pepper, and Steve suspects the break up still stings.
has been busy for the past few days, dealing with the aftermath of everything, as well as preparing for his new duties as the ruler of his country.
Currently, Steve’s standing in a small studio apartment in Philadelphia. Sharon is shuffling through some documents, checking if there’s any mistakes. Steve looks around in the shabby place. It’s most likely one of those SHIELD hiding spots he’s already familiar with. Sam has a similar one in Long Island.
Maybe Tony would start to hate him again. That would serve Steve right, messing with time, with Tony's life.
Tony sighs, sipping his coffee. “Although I do regret bringing him into our fight. Well ‒ we were short of choices then. Should’ve tried to summon Thor or something… That guy sure loves to fight.”
“Anyway,” Shuri sighs, “I thought you might want to wait until he’s up. Then you could leave together.”
”I need to talk to you,” Steve says to him solemnly. Steve can see Fury's eye swift behind his glasses.
Peggy understood. With a pained smile, she got up and walked over to the record machine to put on some music.
Tony, Jarvis?” Steve asks softly. His heart pangs as he stands in the darkness, knowing Tony is just in his reach.
“No.” Wanda shakes her head. “I think T’Challa would come to aid. And there’s the new guy, Strange.”
”Tony,” Natasha interrupts his rambling, ”It's alright. Everything is perfect.” There's a smile on her face as she looks at Tony, something like fondness sparkling in her eyes. She hops off of her chair, informing them, ”I'm heading to the gym now.”
Carol's eyes move from Steve to Tony. Then, she says, ”I have a family to visit. If you'll excuse me…”
The blonde watched everyone, was silent for a few seconds before continuing, it wasn't going to be for someone else to come in and interrupt him, that was already fed up. --Well, continuous, the first rule of the contract is ... -- and again it was interrupted, to which the blonde only took his hand to his face.
-Si... -he answered more quietly, sitting on the bed, hugging the pillow. Damn hormones, by the fact of being man the hormones attacked with everything, technically because it's not normal for a man to be pregnant, but Stark was a special.
-Stephen. -The Chestnut-tree laughed at the opposite behavior. -I think the ring can be anyone, as long as it has been chosen in a special way and no matter how ostentatious, as they say... The intent is the one that counts. -He said tenderly.
The child put aside the bottle of shampoo, he watched his parents with those curious eyes to know the world and responded. -Tito...
Stephen and Anthony found the jewellery observing various engagement rings, the employee had offered to help them but preferred to see them first.
-I'm hungry... –he warned the chestnut to swim walking down the halls to go to the kitchen, and was in the room when a dark bulge in one of the corners of the room caught his attention, after all that was not normal.
The blond smiled at that image, was tender, but he had to tell him that what he was doing was wrong. --Peter...--he called, the Castañito just turned it over to see while the shampoo was still pouring. --Did you throw the shampoo? --the question was obvious, I knew it was his little one.
-Do not leave me with that now you want to become a avenger... but... –turned to see his opponent. –maybe if he wants revenge.
The door was opened by the Winter Soldier, he went into the room and it hurt that his Tony was in that state.
Okay, really no one expected such a character wanting to participate in the contract called "Conquer Tony Stark." Now all you needed to do was specify the contract and sign it. Who would take the heart of genius?
Peter watched him with those big eyes that both remind her of her husband, then turned and watched what he was doing, and then looked at his father again. -Dad...-he talked, Steve laughed about it, his son was blaming Tony.
Many super soldiers watched the goalkeeper closely, Steve sighed and went on. --As the contract said again... --and again it was interrupted.
-that was... Cute... In a way, my love. — He approached the child and no matter what other eyes would be upon them, he kissed the millionaire. -That's one of the things I fell in love with you...
-Just sit down...--He sighed frustrated the Captain, when he observed that everything was already in order, he decided to continue, hoping that no one else would interrupt him anymore. --Well, as I said before all this fuss, the contract must have certain rules, such as... -- the door was opened again interrupting Steve, but this time when everyone turned to see who it was surprised.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just as Tony came in and saw all the candidates smiled, he didn't know he had so many people behind him, however his smile was erased when a certain Titan came in.
-I'll also participate in this contract. -- talked Thanos. -- With Stark next to me the universe will be balanced.
The time in the complex was passing fast, that's when Steve came into the room meeting with Tony lying on the couch while he was eating doughnuts.
-Listen to me Anthony, I love you more than you imagine. -He held Stark's face. -I love you. -and right after he kissed him on the lips. They lasted a few seconds until they were separate. -Who told you You were fat?
I'm not crazy about that thing. –he turned to see him between frightened and angry. –Why don't you do it?
They had gone to a somewhat elegant restaurant, asked for a table, and decided to order their food, both men were eating while chatting about irrelevant issues, work stuff and other things. In addition to looking flirty one again.
-Are you going to abandon us? –This time it was Barton who put a look of puppy abandoned in the rain for the scientist to yield and help them.
The chestnut came to the corner with no worries when suddenly he stopped dry, he carved his eyes to know that what he was seeing was real, indeed, it was.
A the office came the guardians of the galaxy. --We are the guardians of the galaxy and we are here for the contract. --said Peter Quill very excitedly.
The blond sighed, and walked to the back of the couch, meeting Peter who was playing with the baby talc, Embarrandose and dirty completely.
The chestnut was overflowing a lot of emotions, he was shocked when Stephen had said that, he was not expecting it.
-Sorry for the delay. --said Peter a little sorry. --but we too want to participate, I know what you're thinking, I like Mr. Stark and no one will stop me from participating in the contract. --He said earnestly.
-Anthoska... I'm going to love you even fattening up to the point of not being able to get out of bed. -He smiled. -And if you put yourself like a pig you'll look more adorable -he thought.
had finished eating and for the luck of Stark, they asked for dessert; a very sweet one because Tony loves sweet things.
Tony was tensed to hear that Tito of his son. "But if Peter doesn't have grandparents..." he thought.
Steve and Bucky were in one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. offices, the day was sunny and with few clouds. But the reason they were gathered was for one person, or rather the person they wanted.
They finished eating their dessert, both were very comfortable, could not change the environment and then Stephen spoke:
-boys and girl, I'm joined too. -- This time it was Scott. -- Sorry if I interrupted but got lost on my way here. -- he sat in one of the chairs next to Thor.
He was watching for a few seconds, analyzing that thing and looking for possible solutions to solve that because in a way did not want to approach, or crazy did, was then when Barton made his appearance.
-yes. –The doctor answered and came out of that place, turning to who knows where, since he did not want trouble, he went into the elevator and took out his cell phone to write a message to Captain –Steve your "Tony" is in danger. –and with that finished, he sent his message.
They spent a few minutes when the door of the elevator was heard, the two Avengers did not turn, they knew that with only a second that the lost sight of this one would escape and then they could not sleep by means that their new enemy wanted to take revenge.
-Thank you. -the eldest opened the box while it was watched by the chocolate eyes of his partner, Stephen looked at the ring, sighed, his blue eyes perched on the chestnut that looked at him curious and immediately smiled. -it is for you...
-Oh my little roll. -He held his hand. -Don't say that, besides that's characteristic of you, and I like it... -kissed his cheek.
And so they took another half hour, they knew that if they took his eyes off him, his little enemy would escape and it would be worse. It wasn't until our dear Captain America entered the scene.
Steve stared wide eye as he saw Nat for the first time be taken in such a way. And for some reason Steve thought Nat actually liked it more as she came right away at Bucky’s brutal pace and possessive touch. Clint had closed the door to give the two some privacy but all Steve could think about after that was if he would be just as brutal with Tony if they ever did it. With a shiver he brushed the thought away. He’d never be like that he thought. Tony was too precious to the blond for him to take advantage. He’d do it slow and sensual like Clint did with Nat. Or the other way around he didn’t really know. All he knew was that he wanted Tony and he planned to make him his.
Steve was grinning like a drunken fool when he saw the beautiful brunette arrive on the bleachers. He couldn’t help but wave at Tony as the cute nerd shyly waved back. His teammates (including Bucky) had whistled at him when they realized that Tony was there to watch Steve. The whole team had already seen the two walk around campus together. With Steve’s arm wrapped around the smaller teens waist. Face like a victorious warrior that had just claimed his prize.  There were a few teases here and there but Steve really didn’t mind as long as he had Tony with him. “Come on Rogers, get back here..you can be a lover boy later..” the coach shouted when Steve had started running towards Tony. The blond Instantly groaned when he remembered he still needed to practice. Tony had awkwardly smiled at Steve as he gave him two thumbs up making the blond grin stupidly before turning back.
He said he wouldn’t leave...that he’d take care of him...what a lier, Tony thought bitterly as he took out his phone from beside him again. He should of known, he did know..but Steve always made him forget how much he hated him. How much he shouldn’t love him, how much he had hurt him. It was like a stupid joke that the one person he loved the most in this world was the one person who he shouldn’t. And it hurt so much. God he needed help. This really wasn’t good..Before he could think on what to do, a message had popped up inside his phone from Bucky. Tony stared at it for a few moments till a small smile had form on his face.
“You can thank me once i get you all hot and bothered in bed..” Steve grinned as he carried the giggling brunette into the master bedroom.
Tony puffed as he played with the food on his plate. The wedding would be tomorrow and Killian had visited to drop off a Gift that Tony would need to wear for the wedding. The whole family gasping in delight when the Alpha had popped a fifty thousand diamond necklace romantically saying placing it on the omega’s neck saying “ just a little something new for tomorrow..” Tony stared in amazement at how thoughtful his new alpha could be. The whole Dining room boomed with cheers and laughter before instantly turning silent as a familiar figure stepped into the room. Tony frowned when he noticed everyone in the room freeze in their place. Eyes wide open as they continued to stare at whatever or whoever was behind Tony. The suspense was too much for the brunette before he turned around to also freeze in his spot.
That’s why people like Bruce settled to wait than date. It was honestly a whole lot easier than having to deal with losing a cuddle buddy. Granted there were perks to the whole pre-soulmate relationship thing. But Bruce didn’t want all the drama that came along with it. That’s why it really was better to just hang out with friends…unless those friends were named Steve and Tony. Then that would be a whole other story.
A few moments later two guards came in escorting an expressionless Pepper. “Come sit and eat...celebrate our newly formed bound as a witness from your kingdom..” Steve smiled and gestured for her to take a seat near them. Once the red headed woman had Settled herself on Steve’s left the blond made no hesitation to show the woman who her prince now belonged to. Tony had been staring unconsciously at her when Steve bit into his ear making the brunette shiver beneath him bit a small blush spreading.
“Ma, im home…” Steve called out as he opened the front door to their house. Tony following akwardly behind him. He had only planned to walk Steve home, but was a bit surprised when the tall blond had suddenly grabbed his hand and guided him to their porch before opening the door.
It had been a shock when the village elders had asked for him to come forward when it was time to announce who the protector had chosen. He hadn’t expected the creature that had been protecting them for five years would ever find an omega like him interesting. Although he did know he was attractive to most of the alpha’s and even beta’s in his village. He hadn’t thought it’d be the same with the protector. Maybe this was his true calling after all since there was no way for him to reject being called out by the elders. he had done his best to avoid getting married to any of his village’s alpha’s due to him not finding them a good enough alpha for him. Not that they weren’t any good. It was just that he never felt they were the one for him. But when he had heard his name being call out from amongst the crowd, it was the point where he couldn’t say no anymore.
Thank you so much for your wonderful reviews and patience foe me to update my stories! Your comments always make me want to write and post faster! Please enjoy this update and hope to hear what you guys think
Tony inhaled sharply as the servants had finished decorating him with jewelry. He only wore a red silk wrapped around his waist while the rest of his body lay bare for the whole kingdom to see. His arms and chest were draped with  extravagant jewelry. Head placed with a small thin golden crown as his hair was neatly combed for the occasion, Even though his curls would stick out eventually.
At that moment he had promised to claim Tony as his when the time was right. Hoping and praying the human wouldn’t be bonded to another while he was still protecting them. Curse their stupid agreement to be not be seen by human’s. Before he had left the elders of the higher ranks Steve had agreed to not be seen and his words were bounded to his chest. Marking it with a curse that would burn him inside out if he ever made contact with the human’s who didn’t need his help within the five year duration. Thankfully no human Alpha had taken a claim on Tony yet. His Tony now that he thought about it.
When the food was done Tony frowned as he saw how little Steve had cooked. The lasagna looked like it was only good for two to eat, and there were three of them. “Steve?” Tony said with a curious look on his face as he continued to stare at the dish his hybrid had made. “Yes Tony?” Steve asked innocently with wide blue eyes at his master. “I...um...never mind...you know what? Let’s eat...Thor we can share my plate!” Tony called out as Thor beamed at him. Steve’s face fell as he choked on his own saliva at hearing that. Blue eyes turning cold as he watched Tony take a slice of the dish, stabbing a fork into it before feeding it to the humming hybrid. No! Tony should be feeding Steve! Not Thor! And the lasagna was supposed to be for them! How could he give his portion of the dish to Thor? Steve whimpered as his ears and tail dropped at seeing Tony continuing to feed Thor like it was normal. Like he shouldn't be doing that with Steve instead. With another whimper Steve went and nudged his head against Tony’s head, the brunette glanced with a smile at him. “You want some too?” The brunette asked making Steve smile wide with a nod. “You can have the rest were good with this...” Tony said as he pointed at the lasagna left  on the table. Steve’s face fell again feeling utterly defeated as he sat down on one of the chairs. Sulking miserably as he glared at the other hybrid getting all his master’s attention. Like he was Tony’s hybrid...No! He wasn’t! Steve was Tony’s hybrid! And Tony was Steve’s Master. Only Steve’s! It had always been that way since the wonderful engineer had found him and brought him here to THEIR home. A lump had formed on his throat as he remembered that faithful night. Was this what was happening now with Thor? He knew Thor had an owner but..what if they wouldn’t find him? Would Tony take him in too like he had taken in Steve? Was Steve not Tony’s only hybrid anymore?
Tony asked frantically as he dove to the floor to help a fallen Thor who was covered with flour, burnt toast and cracked eggs. “I...ugh..was trying to make you breakfast as a thank you for letting me stay here...” Thor mumbled as he patted the flour off of him, A bit of yolk dripping from his head. “I am sorry...i truly don’t know how to prepare these things as my master had servants do these things for us...but i tried...” he said with a shy smile as he offered Tony a burnt toast from the floor. Thor was finally talking. A small amused yet thoughtful smile appeared on the brunette’s face as he took the burnt toast Thor had offered him, Blue eyes staring dangerously at that. “Gee Thor that’s really sweet of you but Steve here always cooks breakfast...so you don’t have to worry with that..and don’t worry I don’t know how to make perfectly good toast too” he said with a wink as he bit into the dark toast. “That’s from the floor..” Steve reminded him making the brunette spit it out.
Steve had been doing a couple of runs every morning for four months now, swimming for two and on summer he was going to boot camp. All while he was getting the right vitamins and meds and hospital visits. Sarah his mom had hired a trainer and a private doctor to help him in his mission. He wouldn’t be able to see Tony during the summer when he’d be in boot camp but he’d endure. He’d make sure that he’d be fit to protect his precious alpha from other omega’s swooning over him.
It would be too hard to pick just one. He hated choosing, especially since now he knew that all of them wanted him.
this story really isn’t about them being related or not..it’s the story of their uncontrollable love for each other, weather they were related or not...
If it wasn’t for Steve’s mom knocking on the door asking the two if Tony was staying for dinner. Steve didn’t know how far Tony would of let him. The two had instantly jumped from each other as far as they could once his mom had opened the door. Eyes looking a bit suspecious as she plastered a grin. “We’re having mashed potato’s and fried chicken…” She trailed. “Um…would you like to stay for dinner?” Steve asked with a very flushed face as he tried to even out his hair. Tony was red as a tomato as he tried to straighten his shirt, nodding a “sure!” Before adding “i-i could help with te potatos…” he offered with a smile. Mrs. Rogers beamed at that offer. “Why that honestly sweet of you! Come on down the kitchen and we can get started!”
The king hummed at the sensation of Tony’s hands rubbing and roaming the edges of his wet body. Face burning beat red as tried to control his inner desire to take him then and there. He really should wait since it would be rude to interrupt Tony with bathing him.  Instead he focused his hands on roaming the smaller man’s body as he started rubbing some oil on his palms as well and spreading it on Tony’s back and neck. A small moan escaped the brunette’s trembling lips as he started to wiggled his ass a bit on Steve’s erection. Steve chuckled at the brunette’s action. Guess he wasn’t the only one getting impatient. With a hot breath he leaned over Tony’s shoulder as he ordered Tony to lift his ass up a bit.
He had promised to make Prince Tony his soon...he didn’t expect it would be this soon..he’d have to thank the bitch somehow
“Wow! Look at the time! My shirt isnt gonna dry it’s self ya know..we better get upstairs now!” Steve hurriedly said as he tried to hide his redden face from the brunette. Pulling Tony along side him as fast as he could before his mom could embarass him anymore. He had slammed the door shut once they were finally in his room. Face all flushed as he awkwardly apologized to Tony about his ma. The smaller teen just laughed as he reassured Steve that his mom was great. And the brownies were outstanding.
A groan escaped the king’s mouth as he bucked his hips forward at the sweet sensation. His large hand quick to wrap around the princes dark curly locks. Making Tony choke as he buried His cock deep inside the Princes warm mouth. Tears trailed down the Princes flush cheeks as Steve began face fucking the quivering brunette. His pace becoming more jerky as he pounded into the Princes mouth.
Steve, Steve, Steve...was all his mind could think of as he continued to press against the other, crap..he couldn’t even kiss someone else even with alcohol in his system as the only thought that was running through his mind at the moment was a certain blond. The kiss he had shared right now wasn’t what he had expected it to be. Kissing Bucky, felt like he was kissing a brother..but it was nothing at all like Kissing Steve, who was his actual brother. Which was just god damn so confusing really, How fucked up was he if finally kissing someone who wasn’t actually related to him hadn’t had the same effect as kissing his own flesh and blood. Oh how he wanted the world to devour him right then and there.
I hope that answered your wonder question! And please feel free to ask more! I am always open to them..gosh you were right XD i seemed to answer more than what i was planning on answering
As the two sat down on the living room sofa Steve Carefully settled his arms and chin on Tony’s lap, making himself comfortable before asking what Tony wanted to talk about. Tony chucked nervously for a bit before he went into serious mode all of a sudden as he stared at the anxious Hybrid. “So...tomorrow i will be escorting lil miss pepper out to L.A..she had asked me to come along with her on a trip to see her client and do business there..” Tony trailed as he noticed Steve tensed up. “When will you be back?” The blond asked as he leaned closer. “I’ll be back after two days..so Thursday..and don’t worry..I’ve already talked to Clint, i asked him if you could stay with him and Natasha while I’m out and he said yes...”
“And did you like it?” Steve asked with a shaky voice. Tony frowned at that, not sure if he should answer honestly that kissing Bucky felt more like kissing a brother, which was fucked up since kissing Steve always felt good. Before he could make up his mind though Steve had lunged at him furiously, Mouth capturing his in an instant. Making Tony’s knees go weak as he instinctively leaned into the kiss. Feeling large arms wrap around his head, Pressing him closer as their tongues danced together. Before Tony could get lost in the kiss even more however Steve had pulled away, making the smaller teen whine against him. Face all flushed out, panting and beautiful.
“Peggy...sorry to interrupt but could you two give us a ride home?” Steve asked as he began shoving Tony inside the backseat, not waiting for the other to reply. “Oh...sure, sure...no problem...Daniel darling..you know where Steve’s house is right?” Peggy asked as she turned to glance at Daniel who nodded with a smile at her. The blond quickly got in and held the brunette tightly against his chest, arms never letting go of Tony as the car drove off.
Ned, Harley and MJ all laughed by the pool while being served non alchocolic cocktails by a  waiter. He was about to go over there before strong arms suddenly grabbed him from behind.
The group of girls from earlier were now behind the blond and brunette’s back asking them if they were alright. Steve sighed as he turned and started talking to them. Bucky as well. Tony immediately felt a little out of place as the people in front of him were all so beautiful and all seemed to really know each other. While he was there being all short, dull and nervous as he tried to fix his glasses. A few seconds pst by and he could tell they all seemed to have forgotten about him so he sneakily started walking in a fast pace down the bleachers while they still had their backs to him. There really wasn’t any point in staying there looking like a total night lamp while all of them chatted happily. He would just rather go home and be by himself, squealing his heart out as he got to interact a bit with Bucky again. Maybe he could have a bit of snack inside his room while writing about Bucky again.
That morning Steve had been extra attentive and pampered Tony with lots of kisses and touches. The brunette had immediately felt better as Steve fed him breakfast. This was all he really wanted, for his brother to be with him. Be right next to him. When they were about to get up from the bus Steve had lingered on their kiss a little more before pulling away, making the brunette feel a bit light headed as he tried to breath normally again. But just as they had got out of the bus, Steve immediately drifted away from him the moment his friends (along with Peggy) had greeted him.
And Steve took this as an advantage. Since he’d place his arm agaisnt the seat, letting Tony’s head lay comfortable against it. Head eventually relaxing to his side as he’d continue to play with dark curls.
“Tony you know you shouldn’t be wandering off like that...it’s dangerous..you had me worried” Steve said with a serious tone. The tiny omega nuzzled his wet head against the hydra’s chest as he muttered an apology. Saying he didn’t mean to make him worry. With a sigh Steve shook his head before scooping up the wet omega into his arms. “It’s alright...just please pick the flowers that are actually near our home next time”
Steve smiled brilliantly at the large banquet table filled with meats, pastries and wine. decorated with lavish gold, petals and wild fruits from the palace gardens. Tony had never been so full in his entire life as Steve fed him different kinds of sweets and dishes that where only grown and harvested in the Hydra’s lands. Back at his old kingdom his father had never let him eat too much as it was improper for a Stark prince to eat his fill, saying that noble bloods should never give in to gluttony as it was one of the disgusting sins that turned one into an absolute wreck. Steve however was having none of it as the brunette had known the hydra loved to over indulge in what the table had to offer, though seeing him train and fight in combat Tony knew why he did so.
“I’ll get us something warm to drink...tea?” Pepper asked as she got up the small couch. “Coffee is fine..boiling hot please” Tony answered with glee, making Pepper shake her head with a grin. Coffee had no affect on the brunette when he decided to sleep anyways so there was no problem. “So..what are you up to over there?” Tony asked with a smile. “ i just finished making some dinner for us..” Steve answered awkwardly after hearing a light moan in the background. Tony furrowed his brows at that with his cheeks a bit tinted. Steve had already told him about Natasha’s situation earlier so he didn’t have to ask what that noise was, especially since Steve was looking all too flushed as well. after a few seconds of staring at each other’s redden faces Clint suddenly appeared into view in the camera, waving at Tony. He was in his boxers eating a banana. Tony waved back asking how Nat was while sipping the hot coffee Pepper had given him.
It was one of those nights where Steve had Tony mostly to himself since Pepper was never present for these events. So Steve had made it his mission to always sit right next to Tony whenever it was time to start.
Thank you so much for reading this short little sweet fic that i wrote within three or four days...this was just pure fluff and so fun to write!
That’s why during the summer he had made it his mission to be more outspoken, more straightforward because heck even if he didn’t look like an alpha, didn’t mean he couldn’t act like one. Who knows maybe some of the alpha’s might back off of him if he started talking like them. Then Steve wouldn’t get so upset whenever he’d catch them bullying him. So that was that, tomorrow He’d be the alpha Steve truly deserved. Oh he couldn’t wait to show his tiny yet feisty omega what an alpha he could be for him tomorrow. He inwardly smiled as he finished drinking his milkshake. While the others started throwing fries at Clint.
“Because i love you Tony! I just love you so much, more than a brother should...that I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore!” Steve choked as he tried to pull the younger teen back to him. Tony couldn’t help but open his eyes as he stared up at his brother with a startled look. “W-what? No...you don’t love me..” Tony whispered making the taller teen shake his head at him. “Yes, yes i do Tony...i love you so much even though i know that it’s wrong...that’s why i kept avoiding you whenever there were people around...i wanted to get my mind off you...i went out late because I couldn’t trust myself around you anymore...the more we were alone together, the more i wanted to do things i know I shouldn’t...i tried keeping my distance as much as possible but every time i saw you inside the house with your messy hair and puffy eyes wake up so beautiful inside your bed i could never control myself...i tried but just couldn’t...” Steve trailed to lean down closer to the wide eyed brunette. “Im so sorry if i ever made you feel like i was ignoring you...i..i just wanted you to have a normal life..maybe find someone else that isn’t me...but...the moment i saw you with Bucky...i...i just couldn’t...i know this is selfish but i want you Tony...all to myself..your mine...” before Tony could realize it Steve was crying against his shoulders. Hugging him tightly as the tears fell on his side. For a moment they both stayed that way. Steve stiffening a bit when Tony stayed silent.
Steve spares one more glance at the direction where Tony had disappeared, half excepting him to be standing there, observing Steve’s exchange with Lisa-Marie. There’s no one there, however, so Steve follows Lisa-Marie inside.
“Come on, Tony,” Steve says gently. He’s aching to comfort Tony with a touch, but keeps his hands firmly around the coffee cup. “He fought well. Let’s not dwell on the mistakes we’ve made. What’s happened won’t be undone.”
”Everything alright, Rogers?” Tony asks. Steve can't stop looking at him; like he's his everything. He is. ”Why are you looking at me all funny?”
She had. Steve knew she had gotten married, had had children. As she should have, as was her right. To move on. Be happy.
”But you're here,” Tony continues quietly, looking at his hands. The tone of his voice sounds wondrous and Steve's heart skips a beat.
”Everything’s fine.” Steve tries to smile. He thinks his facial muscles have forgotten how to smile but then, he can't help it. Slowly, they start to work.
As Steve is scrutinizing Bucky, Bucky is watching over Steve’s shoulder instead, eyes calculating, mouth twitching.
“What are you up to?” Bucky asks, looking from Wanda and Shuri to Steve and Tony, slowly raising his eyebrows.
“I-“ Tony says, but doesn’t find the words. That one small syllable is still music to Steve’s ears. ¨
Steve grins and flips them over, swallowing the surprised sound Tony lets out by collapsing their lips together.
“It is,” Lisa-Marie agrees, “Shall we get inside? It might start raining soon, and Ms. Maximoff is waiting.”
“Unless…” Wanda continues before Steve can propose any desperate solution. He’d take the girl with him if it came to it. Or send her to Wakanda. “I could go back to… You know. Vision will be there. I think he could understand me ‒ I like him, even though he took the other side.” She licks her lips, turns to gaze at her feet.
”Cap? Rogers?” Tony's voice. Sometimes, hearing Tony's voice still takes him by surprise. Tony throws himself next to Steve on the couch, raising his eyebrows at Steve.
He could've live in the tower for years, be with Tony, fall deeper and deeper in love. Steve thinks about the other Steve Rogers on the bottom of the Potomac River and hates him.
When they part, Steve can see the changes in him. Bucky’s face is a little more relaxed ‒ and he has a new arm, the latest Wakandan technology, probably produced by Shuri.
“I don’t know much. I think he does things with portals, but he’s more of an ally than an Avenger. Oh, and we have Peter, but he’s a kid.”
“I have nowhere to go,” she says, speaking for the first time since their escape. Her voice is hoarse. Steve rubs the back of his neck. Technically she’s right.
“All should be fine now,” Sharon announces, handing the documents to Steve, who glances at his new identity. Apparently, he’s legally called Mathew Cavanaugh, for now.
“Lisa-Marie Rhodes,” she says, offering her hand. As Steve shakes it, he wonders why her name strikes a familiarity in him. He shakes her hand a little too long, so that she starts to look a bit uncomfortable, her smile freezing on her face as Steve analyzes her features, trying to figure her out. She has dark brown skin, similar cornrows as Shuri ‒ same intelligent glint in her eyes as well ‒ and she’s wearing bright pink lipstick, but nothing in her is a familiar as her name.
”I- I promised you a dance. We never got that,” Steve said to Peggy to steer the subject away from Tony. His voice was rough. He didn't sound like himself.
When Steve turns around, he's not quite prepared for what he sees - it's Carol Danvers, floating in the air, arms crossed across her chest, a playful smirk on her face.
“Yes,” Steve says without a doubt. It’ll be good ‒ Tony needs people around him, to stop loneliness from eating him alive, and Steve knows he doesn’t feel resentment towards Wanda either. He may even be sorry for locking her in the facility.
In this world, Tony Stark hasn't born yet. In this world, Steve Rogers has a breakdown in front of the house of the woman he had once been in love with, not ready to face his own harsh reality.
Tony chuckles. It sounds ugly, heartless, and morbid. “I thought you’d already forgotten you gave me the phone.”
“What’s your plan? Are you just going to sulk and pine here, maybe grow a beard?” Sam tries to tease.
“Hello?” Steve answers. His voice is shaking, his hands are shaking, his legs are shaking. He feels weak, collapsing on the bathroom floor, leaning on the washing machine. His heartbeat is in his throat.
”I won't, sweetheart. I won't,” Steve replies, hugging him tighter, pressing his face into Tony's hair.
“I just thought,” Shuri continues, “It’ll take me a few more weeks, at least.” She grimaces at her words, as if it was a disgrace it would take that long. Steve had nothing to complain. Shuri had worked and worked, and as much as Steve wanted to see Bucky up and about again, they weren’t in a hurry.
“I’ve been trying to help,” Wanda admits, “The truth is, the state of the Avengers doesn’t look so great know. If we were needed now, there’d be only Vis and Tony.”
Then, he catches Steve sneaking up on him. He looks startled, like a deer in a headlights, staring at Steve. “Uh huh, you know what, I got to go. Yeah, I’ll call you tomorrow. Bye!”
“Vision,” Wanda says. Her cheeks flush a bit as she takes the phone. Steve shakes his head fondly. There’s a relationship he hadn’t seen coming.
”You don't have to lie to me, Rogers,” Tony says, his usually warm-toned voice cold as ice. When he turns back around to face Steve, his eyes look defeated and lightless.
Again, Tony is looking at Steve like he's lost his mind. He scratches the back of his neck. ”Um, haven't thought of dinner, actually.”
”Good,” Steve breathes. He picks up his backpack from the floor. ”I'm going to swing by my quarters to drop off my stuff. What's for dinner?”
He appears at the tower one evening, exhausted, but content that he has made it. Through space and time, hiding from Asgardian guards, from SHIELD/HYDRA agents, from his own doppelgängers. Having to face Red Skull again. Getting that dance with his girl.
Of course she had. Time travel wasn't a hard concept to wrap one's head around for a woman who had been there to witness the creation of Captain America.
Lisa-Marie’s smile is understanding. “It’s fine. Perhaps not, but I assume you know a certain Sharon Carter?”
A sudden noise makes them drift quickly apart. They both lift they’re heads, lips reddened by the kiss, to see Wanda and Shuri standing by the doorway. Shuri has her hand pressed against Wanda’s mouth, but she has been too late. It was Wanda’s sudden gasp that had broken them out of the kiss-haze.
Steve wants to pull Tony close, hold and caress him. Instead, they sit with a space between them. Tony is forking leftover noodles into his mouth, eyes on the TV where a movie is playing.
“Sorry!” Tony suddenly shouts, “I’ve had enough of your ‘sorry’!” He throws the glass across the room. It shatters against the wall.
“Ceiling lady?” Shuri says, “When was the last time he had problems with at least one of his suits?”
With the knowledge that the threat of someone taking Tony away from him is gone, Steve lies down on the mattress, pulling Tony with him. He's so happy he could burst. When his hands start to find their way underneath the waistband of Tony's sweatpants, Tony interrupts their kiss. ”I need a slightly better explanation. Later. Oh, and Jarvis? Close the blinds in case the flying wonder woman comes back.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, thinking back to the days when he was just a small boy from Brooklyn. “I never saw this coming.”
“You’re welcome to join me in my bed tonight,” Steve whispers to Tony, putting an arm around him, pulling him as close as possible.
”Tony,” Steve says solemnly. He can't hold it anymore. Tony needs to know the truth about his parents and Bucky.
“Tony, he… I think he asked Vision to stop you from leaving, but Vision hit Rhodes instead. He fell… before Tony or I could reach him.” Sam looks grim, chewing on his lips.
Right now, he's wondering, how would Tony react if Steve reached over with his foot and ran it up and down Tony's shin.
“Jesus Christ… I come back and you’ve fallen in love… Steve, you have to take action. You don’t want this to end like Peggy.”
Steve stands up and goes to Tony, letting his hands travel up Tony's sides. Tony shivers, eyes glistening with something – perhaps hope mixed with wonder.
They find Wanda in the common room, half glancing at some mindless soap opera on the TV, half scrolling through her phone.
”Alright, Rogers. Um,” Tony says, clearly not knowing how to react. Steve is still sort-of holding him, hands hovering over Tony's waist. Steve knows this is perhaps out of character from him. In this time, he had been falling, but hadn't known how to be around Tony. Tony definitely had no clue.
Soon, he can't stand up anymore, collapsing on the curb. The suppressed sobs strangle his throat. Steve wipes is face, the snot mingling with the tears.
“Unbelievable,” Tony mutters to Steve, pouring him a coffee without asking. “Young people… It’s the same with Parker… Remind me to never let him meet Shuri.”
“Is everything alright?” a soft voice interrupts them. The both turn their heads towards it, and see Wanda, hesitantly standing at the doorway.
”Did you have a nice trip?” Steve asks, taking a gulp of the tea. Tony has prepared it just how Steve likes it – sweet with honey.
When Steve had seen her during their little side-quest in the 70s, he had wondered. Peggy had been as beautiful as ever – ethereal, but Steve had only felt a feeble tickle of nostalgia when he had silently watched her. He wondered – what could have been, wondered if Peggy would've accepted that Steve had fallen for another in the end.
“She fought in a war in Wakanda. And she’s super smart. She’s got all the ingredients. How is Parker, by the way?”
Natasha gave Clint a look of deep disgust. "Clint I swear if any of your food ends up on my plate I'm stabbing you."
Steve seemed slightly dazed when Tony pulled away.  His eyes hazy with arousal. "Tony. What are you doing?"
Steve stared at him intently before nodding and together they made their way from the living room to the elevator. Once they were in and heading straight to the penthouse Tony turned pushing Steve against the wall with a kiss.
Tony looked at Steve before sinking to his knees. "I've wanted to do this for a long while and today gave me the perfect opportunity. I wanted to thank you for saving me earlier."
Steve's head jolted up at the sound of his voice. "Tony." he breathed "Your awake. How are you feeling?" he reached for a cup of water bringing it to Tony's mouth.
Tony poured a cup of coffee and drained it straight ignoring Bruce. Pouring another cup he turned to Bruce feeling more human.
"Will do Robin Hood. Although I would suggest you treat the cook nicer otherwise you'll get a nasty surprise" Tony said as he blasted another alien in the face. He loved his job. He flew away before Clint could reply.
He knew but he didn't care, after all how else was the world going to move forward to new advancements and make unexplored discoveries? Also it didn't hurt that when he was creating things he forgot about the wormhole.
Thor and Hulk were as usual doing the most damage. However the battle was getting harder as it went on.
When everything settled Tony glared at the rubble around him shifting a few pieces away before getting out of there.
Tony licked his lips as they stared at each other. He froze as he saw Steve's eye follow his tongue.
After he had everything on and had removed the helmet he made his way to the kitchen and coffee. He found Bruce leaning by the coffee maker with a cup of tea.
Steve stared at him softly "Yes, and not just because I'm already inside you." he thrust up as if to remind Tony of that. As if he could ever forget.
Tony smiled. "Go home Steve, take a shower and get a good nights sleep. Tell everyone I miss them and hope to see them soon."
Tony squeezed his hand. Steve's mouth twitched halfheartedly. "You have no idea how scared I was. How much I would miss you." Steve met his gaze with intent.
"I can't believe it, we're soulmates. All this time waiting was for you." he smiled breathlessly at Tony who couldn't resist and leaned down to kiss him.
Steve had started recapping over the comms when he noticed Tony wasn't making his usual comments. In fact no one had been replying.
"Tony are you okay? You seem-" Steve hesitated as he tried to find a word that would encompass the fact that Tony had bags under his eyes, stained shirt and messy hair.
Steve laughed "I have done this to myself before, I'm not completely inexperienced." he twisted his fingers before spreading them apart.
Instead he went to the workshop. Where he had made a new Stark Phone for SI, new arrows for Clint, updated Widow Bites for Natasha, data updates for Dummy, U, Butterfingers and J.A.R.V.I.S. Right now he was making another suit for Steve (because the man went through them like tissues).
Flying away from Manhattan he started looking for anything that would help. As he got further from the city he started to see water tanks. Tony let out a sigh of relief.
Tony eyed Steve as if daring him to say he wasn't interested. "-Or we could continue and I will make this the most amazing night of your life."
"I hope so because I'm keeping you forever." Tony murmured as he pulled away and kissed Steve's tattoo.
"Hostages are being held by an enhanced person by the name of Jonathan Blake." Steve's jaw was flexing in irritation.
"Tony!" He yelled pushing Tony over onto his back. The reactor wasn't lit. Steve's breath caught. His trembling hand reached for Tony's pulse, nothing.
"Yes Sir, we indeed have one located here." The little area that held the EMP started flashing. "However sir I must warn you that it will stop your arc reactor an-"
As always when they fought together Tony thought that they made a good team. Their moves perfectly in tune with the other. Like a choreographed dance. Tony directed a beam on Steve's shield which bounced it off into the oncoming horde. It took a while but finally all of the aliens around them were defeated. Thor landed next to them. "That was a great battle my friends."
As the rest of the building started collapsing Tony grabbed the last hostage shoving them out, before everything fell on Tony.
"Tired only a few scrapes. They are extremely worried about you. Thor is refusing to have movie night without you."
"I deserve that. However I do hope you know that we are going to sit down with the team and have a talk about the fact that you didn't let us know you were going to do that. You scared everyone Tony."
Tony nodded enthusiastically pulling away and pushing the bottle of lube into Steve's hand.  Steve coated his fingers before moving behind Tony, he pulled Tony's fingers out replacing them with his.
He was holding a gun with one hand and his other hand was lifted up with a fire ball hovering. Shit...he had Pyrokinesis. This was not good.
"Shut up." Tony muttered as he reached for his own shirt before stopping. Steve seemed to know what he was thinking though as he put his hands on Tony's. "I wasn't joking. You are gorgeous, all of you."
Steve threw his head back into the pillows and started laughing. Tony moaned as the motion caused Steve's cock to press into his prostate.
Back then it was expected you would try to wait for your soulmate. Not everyone followed that of course but now days it was extremely rare.
"Tony seeing you like that was awful and it has given me the courage to ask. Will you go on a date with me?"
Tony swallowed and nodded, together they both pulled off his shirt with his pants quickly following before Steve joined him on the bed wrapping Tony in his arms. Tony's hands moved to Steve's back sliding slowly up and down. Tony drifted feeling lazy and content when one of his hands slipped to Steve's butt cupping it. Steve jolted before pulling Tony's hands away and kissing them. "Sleep Tony."
Every so often Steve would lean down to kiss him and it built their desire ever higher before it exploded. Gold light filled the room brightly as they released before sinking into their skin into new tattoos. They smiled at the merged image of the Arc Reactor and Steve's shield that was now on their shoulders.
"Thor! Tony needs you. He isn't breathing! Suit override Steve Rodgers 66-24-69-35." the suit peeled away from a secret pocket and Steve grabbed the spare reactor holding it as Thor landed.
As they settled down into the afterglow Steve pet Tony's cheek. "I was meant to come to the future. It all happened for a reason, I was meant to come here and find you and the team."
"No J I would rather you didn't." Tony said as he pulled out the EMP before taking a deep breath and pressing it. A sharp pain went through his chest and he dropped the EMP to the ground as his armored hand went to his chest. Tony fell to his knees but as he did he was glad to see that the pulse had taken down the robots. His breathing got heavier and he could hear the team talking through the comms. Minutes were passing quickly and his vision was starting to blur before his eyes slid shut.
He reached out to take the mug from Tony who made a pained sound. "but coffee." he whined making grabby hands at the cup.
"Indeed Anthony this is most divine." Thor was on thirds. Tony had long given up trying to figure out where it all went. Maybe a portal in space.
"Yes. Yes I thought it but I didn't think that I said it out loud." Tony paid close attention to the way Steve's eyes widened and the smile that started to spread across Steve's face.
Tony pointed to the forming glow and Steve's eyes snapped fully open as he stared at the light. "We're soulmates." he breathed out in shock.
They slowly made their way to the bedroom stopping often to either pull off a piece of clothing or press the other to the wall kissing them senseless.
Steve didn't seem to realize until Tony moaned, Steve lifted onto his elbows to look at Tony. He groaned at the sight of Tony's fingers moving. He grabbed Tony's wrist.
"Steve, I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?" Tony asked after dinner was finished and the team was relaxing, watching The Lord of the Rings again.
Steve stirred awake as he felt his tiny master rustle a bit inside his arms. He whined a bit as he leaned from behind to see if his master was already awake, He wasn’t. Although the brunette was moaning a bit in his sleep as he was unconsciously grinding his bum against Steve’s morning wood. Steve bit a moan at that as he started to buck his hips against his master’s soft round ass. with a light blush spreading on his face as he started to sniff Tony’s neck. The brunette smelled of arousal which only made Steve get harder, loving how Tony was moaning and grinding against him in his sleep. If only Tony was awake...Steve would easily try and persuade him that they should breed. He didn’t know if Tony would say yes right away but he would try. He had already promised himself he would make Tony know how much he wanted him, and he would go through with that promise especially with that other hybrid around the house. With a soft moan escaping Tony’s parted lips Steve groaned as he bit the engineer’s soft ear, earning him a shiver and another moan from the sleeping man pressed against his chest. With a satisfied grin Steve purred as he continued to buck his erection against Tony’s soft bum. Last night had been a success as he pushed Thor off the bed when the hybrid had tried to crawl on the bed and settled on Tony’s feet. Steve immediately kicking the other blond, disguising it as him trying to stretch his legs but Thor probably knew it was really a kick since it was a bit too hard. The other hybrid had flown and landed against the wall with a crack. startling Tony who was half asleep by then, thankfully Tony hadn’t thought anything of it and had asked Thor to go back to the cough saying the bed just wasn’t big enough for three of them. With a defeated look Thor walked out with his ears and tail low. Steve smiled triumphantly as the other hybrid closed the door, Quickly hiding his smile with a yawn when he noticed Tony glance at him.
He made a small sound as he buried his head underneath his pillow.  About fifteen minutes, as he’s about to dose off he hears his hone ringing. peeking his head from his pillow the screen showed a video call from Steve. Clicking on answer he saw the blond laying on a bed face soft and breathtaking as always. “Hey..” he said. “Hey” Steve whispered. “Who’s bed you in? And What time is it there?” Tony asked wondering why Steve was already in bed. “It’s still early..i just wanted to lay down..we just finished dinner..Clint said i could leave the dishes for him tomorrow to wash ..oh and this is his bed..I’m sleeping here while he’s at Nat’s..”
Steve groaned as he tried to stretch, his whole body ached as he had been chopping the big three near the river for some time now. It was a good sturdy tree that would do them good when he’d start building an extension for The cottage. Since Harley had asked for Steve to build him his own room since he was too old to still be sharing a room with Peter, who would always bring Wade inside making the blond alpha squirm in disgust as Peter and the other would start being all lovey dovey in front of him. Steve had come to terms that Peter and Wade just couldn’t be separated. And he guessed Wade really was a good kid underneath all that stupid mouth of his. He had to be if Peter liked him.
When asked by Sam why he was okay with Steve helping Bucky, Tony just shrugged again saying he knew how awful heats were and wouldn’t want anyone suffering through them alone. Even Bucky, Damn...Sam really wanted to ask Tony if he could be his Omega instead. Because shit, who wouldn’t want a smart, rich, non-insecure, caring, understanding and beautiful omega like Tony? Even Loki and Thor were starting to give subtle hints that they wanted Steve out of Tony’s picture.
Steve forrowed his brows for a bit before realizing what the other meant. “Oh yeah…yeah…” he stupidly laughed as he started to undress right away. Not realizing how massive he looked without his shirt on.
ditasitepu35 Asked ‘since cat hybrid is a human form, is there a possibility that the hybrid could live iindependently without an owner?’
the omega whimper in his arms before, tears trailing down his cheeks as he clung desperately at Steve’s sides.finally relaxing as Steve released a lot of his pheromones. making Tony finally feeling all his pint up exhaustion from the days before. when the kiss had ended all Tony could do was close his eyes as Steve cradled his head on his chest, just like he use to when they were younger. Steve pressed Tony’s head against his chest a bit more, letting the omega smell his pheromones more. A smile formed on his face when Tony had finally fell asleep.
Help, right..he was helping Tony. God he shouldn’t be thinking too much about the blond. he was probably only fooling himself into thinking that Steve was actually staring at him. or even enjoying those kisses they shared. God he was pathetic. He should really kick himself now. He didn’t even know if Bucky would actually want him, let alone Steve. who right now had a few of the cheerleaders shouting at him with big smiles on their faces. They also looked to be flirting with Bucky but Tony’s eyes stayed on the blond cheerleader who kept coming near Steve whenever she had the chance,a frown appeared on his face at that. Why did he feel this strange feeling when she was around Steve? He didn’t even feel anything when a girl had suddenly ran up to Bucky and hugged him..wait...Oh God, how could he do this to Bucky? he was already a cheater! And he wasn’t even dating any of them. Oh he was horrible..horrible..how could he be learning all those lessons to be a good boyfriend to Bucky when he was already falling inlove with Steve. He didn’t deserve them, He really didn’t.
