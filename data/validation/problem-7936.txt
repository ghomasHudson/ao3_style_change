A robot-hand-shaped hole appeared in the door.
“Yeah, right. Did you hear him shouting the name of his lawyer? He’ll never get convicted. No one’s going to take a guy who dresses up in a costume like that as a serious threat. I mean really, who does he think he is? And what are you smiling at?”
“Come on, it’ll be educational. I could tell you about this guy I met in Italy when I was a guest lecturer fifteen years ago.”
“Whatever.”
lllll
”Okay. I believe you. And we will fix this, Tony. We'll find a way to stop Ultron.”
“Wait what?”
Tony had refused to make eye contact when Steve had asked him about what he’d seen, being the first of them to get hit. All he'd said was: ”She was trying to rattle us. Exploiting our darkest fears. It’s psychic propaganda, it doesn’t actually mean anything. ” Which Steve felt was at least somewhat of a contradiction – surely an individual's deepest, darkest fear, pulled straight from their own mind,
7 days and several rounds of banter later
“It must feel unusual having that shrapnel out of your chest, Stark; you want it replaced?”
“She left, Cap.”
“So, I saw the papers last week.”
“Tell Captain Cyclops that he can’t make us deny our love to the world!”
“Yes, please.”
“They’re not cigarettes.”
lllll
“It almost killed you, too, Tony!”
“Well, it’s kind of a blur actually, but it looks like you’re giving boxing lessons to a class of robots.”
“A lid.”
Because he had backed down, once. Never again.
“I heard you the first time, soldier.”
”We couldn't even give them a proper burial. We had to cover up that pit to keep the animals from getting to them. And I thought, as we dug, ’we’re doing what
“It’s just, I think you just fried my brain, a little. Seriously, don’t do that. What are you looking for?”
A shadow fell over Tony’s face.
“You want me to tell you about my conquests? I bet pulling techniques have changed a bit since your day.”
”They can show mercy. Humanity. Forgiveness.”
“Stark.”
“Yes, that’s true. Why waste time on learning the game when you can just flex your muscles and smile and have them crawling all over you? Even that ‘blushing virgin’-look works in your favor. And hey, look, he can get even redder! Who’d have thought?”
“What do you say, sweetheart, you want to publicly deny our everlasting love?”
“What does it look like I’m doing, Stark?”
Tony looked so wretched, that before Steve knew what he was doing, he'd gotten up off the bed and pulled Tony into a hug. ”We’ll stop him.”
“And you’re supposed to tell me I’m wrong, not give me that smug little smirk. You think there’d be nothing in it for you? I’ll have you know I’m universally acclaimed as an amazing lover.”
“No. I made a promise to Pepper. No more hiding in a shell. I’m a new man.”
Tony held a hand up to the robot approaching him.
“Yeah, I noticed.”
Fury had reappeared and called a meeting in the kitchen in an hour, and Steve headed upstairs to have a shower and a change of clothes before it was time for another confrontation. In the guestroom he had been assigned, he took off his t-shirt, wet with sweat from the exertion of chopping a couple of trees' worth of wood for the Barton household. If he was honest with himself, maybe some of it was due to the emotional exertion of arguing with Tony, too. Workouts barely made him break a sweat anymore, but stress could still set it off just as easily as it had before his transformation, when his hands would go clammy at the bare hint of an upcoming fight; the knowledge of the pain to come, the knowledge that he'd lose, the determination to go through with it anyway, every time. A tiny stickfigure-shaped art student with sweat pearling on his forehead, unable to back down in the face of a bully because he knew the psychological pain of surrender was worse than any pain the punches could cause.
Steve was disappointed he was hoping they could find a possible hideout from the old case but so far no luck. “Thanks for informing us” Steve said to Davis and Fury, “we will continue to look and well inform you once we find anything useful” Fury tells them. “Your doing your best, don’t lose hope” Peggy comforts them “we won’t Fury out” The Director said and hangs up. “Well that was a waste of time” Tobias said miserably, “oh come on now darling that wasn’t a waste of time this could help use narrow down our lead” Peggy tries to stay hopeful “maybe” Tobias just said “I wonder how dads doing” he wants to know.
Back in Tony’s lab, “And done I even had 10 minutes to spares” he said smugly as he puts on the bracelet on his wrist it’s small and narrow like any other bracelet but this one has a very special surprise.
Steve opens his eyes and he is shock to what he sees. They are not in the tower anymore, instead it was a large dark forest, with the largest trees that he ever seen in his life. “Where are we?” He whispers, It was Tony who responds to his question “Well Cap, Thor calls this place the forest of rebirth, this is were I’ve been training for the last several weeks” Tony told him, but he got a feeling that Steve was too amazed to even listen to him.
“Hey J do you know if there’s any sausages around this tower?” He asked his AI.
Fury sighed again “No I’m not there’s a fucking mess and I need to fix, you know what to do other agent Hill” he asked her and in turn she shook her head. “Yes sir I’ll get it done” she replied, “Good, get to it we need to this as soon as possible we already wasted enough time already” he said with frustration. “Of course Sir” Maria said and then quickly left the room leaving again Fury to his thoughts, he prayed that he could fix this before it was too late god help him.
How will Tony’s training go?
“What’s up point break did you miss me since this morning” Tony teased with a smile on his face.
[At the crime scene]
But life didn’t seem to be on Tony’s side, as he was about to use his new tool the door opens and Daniel with his henchmen came through the door ‘shit’ Tony thought.
With a sigh he turn to his son, “in just gonna go down and get the sausages Bambi. Don’t worry I won’t take long and if I do you can rescue me” he joke at the end. Tobias gave his dad a sad smile “sure dad I’ll always come and rescue you” he said.
Once he was done there was a long pause, Tony didn’t know what to say or how will John react to his rant of the century. But sure enough John spoke “So what’s it like being trained with a god that must be an honour right?” He just said like it was a joke.
A week went by after the birthday incident. Tony felt tension in every corner in the tower mainly by spangles, who even though fucked him into next week is still not happy with the stunt he pulled. So tony can’t even be bothered with him at this point. and the lovely spy twins are still being petty dicks, they make snide comments and what does steve do nothing so yeah Tony’s piss like they are pissed at him so the feeling is mutual.
But he had to control himself for bit so he can say some rules to stark. “If we does this, we keep it between ourselves and not tell the team I want them to think we became civil through talking and not from you spread like a prostitute. And when we fuck, we do it on my terms for it” he grunted.
“yes please Jarvis, thank you” was all Steve said, as he made his to Thor’s floor.
But lucky for them, this killer was sloppy, they were clearly in a rush to get this done before someone sees them Natasha concluded. She spotted a hair just by the passenger side of the car and not only that she spotted a lighter outside the burned car. “found something” Natasha shouts and Clint and a young agent came over. “Bag this, and send this to Doctor Banner” she told the female agent, she nods and proceeds to gather the evidence.
Hello everyone
Everyone nodded in agreement and they got into the vehicle, Rogers and Tony were the last ones standing outside it was a bit awkward at first until Clint shouted at them to get their asses in.
Lots yelling, lots of accusations
John came back with a wooden box in hand, “here you mom told me once that this was pass down your family for generations and who knows maybe it’s  something that could help you with your training” John hands him the box as he sits down beside him again.

~~~~~~~
Peggy looked up and gave her son a big smile “ darling what a lovely surprise, how have you been?” She asked.
“I would’ve usually said yes. But i had so much fun today. I can’t be mad a this. I’m mad at something else, though,” Tony answered whispering and smiling fondly.
To say that Tony Stark was in love with books was an understatement. Was there a term stronger than being in love to express how we felt about something? Find it, then apply it to Tony, and even then, it wouldn’t be strong enough. Tony lived for books, and we won’t talk about those he owned. There was something about them. It was possibly because they were the doors to countless universes. It was particularly because it made Tony forget. Forget that his life wasn’t perfect, forget that sometimes he was overwhelmed. When Tony read, he lost himself in the words, his mind went elsewhere.
“I love you too.”
Tony looked at Steve, really observed him and his face, and he saw this expression.
Perhaps Tony spent a lot of time in the bookstore. Perhaps he went there every day. See, Tony loved studying, but he always has trouble setting aside his distractions to fully concentrate. So, when he saw the bookstore had a café, he decided it would be a good idea to spent a few hours per day there so he could study. It worked. Tony really could focus on the work he had to do for his classes and the assignments he had to do. If he had spare time, he took the book on his bag and read for a few hours. So, it worked. Until that time when he noticed Steve and he decided to sit next to him. And they met again the day after. And the day after that.
“Oh, so now you want to show me what’s inside,” Tony said laughingly. “I see.”
“Yeah, I guess you could say that. I mean, I like them enough to work here.”
. But more importantly, he felt himself fall for Steve even more. He didn’t know it was possible. He thought he couldn’t be more in love with him than the day he realised Steve was sleeping with a small Iron Man plushie, and all he had wanted to do at this moment was hug Steve and kiss him and he loved him so much it hurt. But, he apparently could. Since all his feelings were now bursting through his chest, they wanted to break free, and maybe Tony could let them go, could open the cage. And so he did.
“Natasha. He’s close to Steve but Natasha is the person he confides in and who knows everything about him.” Steve won too, obviously.
First, it was one date. Then it was a second one, and a third one. The rest is history. All you have to know is that Tony is in love with books and that maybe it’s what made Steve fall in love with him.
. It took him about a week to figure what it was exactly.
“But you said he tried to steal the money…”
“None of these, he doesn’t wake up before 10 am, when everybody even Tony is already awake.”
Steve was like a bomb. All the want and need he was feeling since he had met Tony were now trying to take control of his actions, trying to break free, to find a way to fly of their own, and maybe Steve didn’t want to control them anymore, maybe he wanted them to fly, to taste was freedom felt like. And so he did.
“Yeah. But I wanted to read a few of his books. Also, subtle way to approach the nickname, Steve, really.”
And so they suited up and went to the convention as Iron Man and Captain America.
“Do you ? Want another Cap ?”
Tony didn't remember falling in love with Steve. He remembered their first meeting, and the fight they had about something so stupid and trivial. He remembered sacrificing himself and wanting to say goodbye to Steve, without knowing why because Steve was a stubborn idiot. He remembered everything, but he couldn't remember falling in love with him. He just woke up one day and realized it. He woke up that day and immediately thought of Steve, of his smile, his laugh, his voice, and told himself “I'm so in love with him” and that was it.
“Oh ?”
They spent two hours visiting the place and playing games that were avengers related. When it came to quizes, they won almost every time. Once, Tony was answering a quiz about Steve.
“If you don't want to it's alright really, I just thought that it could be nice, and we already spend so much time together in your bookstore and I like you so I wanted to… ask you out. Which I just did. Twice. Please say yes so I can shut up.”
to buy one whenever he walked before the bookstore – and it happened pretty much every day. So when his bookstore shut down because the owner moved, it was his worst nightmare becoming reality, the end of his life. Tony absolutely needed to find a new bookstore.
But Tony lost his smile when he saw what Steve had bought. His face suddenly couldn’t show anything else but surprise, then happiness, then fondness. Because in front of him was Steve, holding two plushies, holding hands. Captain America, and Iron Man. Holding hands. God, Tony loved him.
“That’s a very good choice you made” the young man said as he took the books from Tony. He had taken Hamlet and Alice in Wonderland.
Steve and Tony were in love with each other, but they thought the other didn't love them that way, so they never said a single thing about it. One year later, after one year of soft touches, fond smile, and
“Book lover, huh?”
“He would never admit it but he loves cooking for the avengers. Specially Steve.”
“What if we visited the place first, and then we choose what we want to do ?”
Maybe the books weren’t the only piece of art of that place. See, the shop assistant was beautiful, really beautiful. He looked young, around Tony’s age actually. His smile was small but warm, his eyes dashing. And he was tall. Very tall.
“And this Baron, he's the father of Cyprienne? And God why are those names so difficult ?”
So he kissed back. He was kissing Steve. Steve was kissing him. They were kissing.
“As in… a date?”
There was a peaceful silence for a while, where Steve and Tony were just smiling at each other. It was something that happened a lot.
“I’m not sure. What if he doesn't like me back ?”
Before he knew his mom wrap her arms around him, gently rubbing small circles on his back. They were like that what seem like hours, but once tony had calm down he pulled away from his mom and gave a sad smile.
Bruce also appropriates that tony isn’t afraid of the other guy, he loves the other guy, Bruce doesn’t really know why but he will leave it alone for now.

[2011]
Steve didn’t how to feel about this, the one woman who he thought he would spend the rest of his life with 70 years ago, is the mother of the man he’s been sleeping with. God this is such a mess but you can’t deny that he does have a thing for small sassy brunettes.
He does some little experiment to see how good Bruces tolerance is, he pokes and jabs. Even though it seems harmless it does aggravate him too.
Tony just raise an eyebrow “really, well you know how I love myself after all Natasha wrote that lovely report about it” he said back. Steve heavy sighed “please Stark can we just talk like normal people without any sort of animosity, just please” he beg. And Tony was surprise at Steve’s tone he sounded defeated, maybe this was Tony’s chance to speak out and form some understanding with Steve and maybe the others too.
After Steve left, Fury just slumped down back into his chair, fuck what a mess he’ll probably need to talk to Tony to make sure that he was alright and to also inform him about the file that he just received. For fuck sake Tony’s is going to be devastated.
“Have you fuckers stop being petty children.. hm?” They didn’t respond, “Good” Fury continues. “To answer your dumb questions the Marks deaths was not an accident you are right in that regard “ Clint made a smug grin from that comment. “However, Tony did not kill them and will never do that, so I have no idea what you idiots have been smoking to think of that” he spats and the team wince at that.
However he was taken out of his thoughts when he heard his phone ring, he sighed and turn over to were his phone is and grabs it to see who it is.
After the incident with Stark his nightmares didn’t surface and he felt more relax, hell him and stark became quite civil towards each other. But recently things became stressful again, there was a difficult mission and two agents died and Steve couldn’t help but blame himself.
Thor continued his tale, but the next tale goes into a dark turn. “Humans became the dominant species of your planet, and with dominance there was power and with power in peoples grasp there was greed, control and evil. There was a group of those kind people who decided to take the world for their own, and they succeeded for very long time, which cause others great pain” Thor said with sorrow and Tony felt sympathy for him.
“This has been great Peggy I’m glad that your son is doing well, but I really need to finish these files. We can do this another time” Fury said politely. Peggy had a look of disappointment but she nodded to ready to leave.
“Tobias that’s enough” Tony sternly spoke which made Tobias wince a bit. “Look I know that your angry at him, I get it I’m a little pissed off myself. But right now it’s not the time we got a bigger problem now” he told his son. Bruce was now more concerned “what happened?” He ask, Steve turns to Bruce “there was an attack where Clint and Natasha where investigating the crime scene, Thor has headed to see what happened” he explains.
But today, he knows that he disobey Rogers direct order from the moment the left the quinjet.
Thor was the first of to speak “glad you can make it Anthony you look wonderful” he said sincerely. Tony tried not to blush at that comment, and he was definitely trying to not blush under Rogers gaze. He kept staring at him it look like lust at first, who could blame him his tux fitted him perfectly and showed his ass...ets in all the right places. But when Tony actually looked at Rogers what he saw wasn’t lust it look like he was in awe but he couldn’t understand why. Rogers notice and quickly looked away from Tony with a red face it almost made Tony giggle, almost.
Tony has been staring at the ceiling for what seemed like hours, late night was good the combination of pain and pleasure was what tony needed then, but now all he could feel was pain from every part of his body.
But he guess he will know soon enough.
Hope you liked this chapter it’s about to go dark in the next couple of
Tony had a small smile to his face,
Then Tony heard the door open, and quickly look at that direction and who came in made his heart beat twice as fast. “Ah Anthony you’re awake, excellent I thought I had to throw cold water at your pretty face, I’m sure you would like that wouldn’t you” Daniel spoke mockingly as walks towards the bed.
“Alright, we’ll start now. So close your eyes and clear your mind” he said.
“Oh fuck...hmmgg” tony moan, the sensation was too much but it felt so good Rogers hit his prostate over and over that he could see stars, he was going to cum soon. Rogers seem to read his mind as he held tony with one hand, he use the other hand to grab Tony’s cock and jerk it off in a fast pace. “Cum Stark, let me feel you” Rogers demanded and Tony obeyed, everything went white, he felt himself spasm and his own cum spurting between them, landing on there clothed chests.
It was awkward to say the least Steve didn’t know what to say for how to leave without making Tony think it was because of him. But then Steve look at Tony’s neck and notice the neckless Tony is wearing “I never seen you wear that before” he stated and Tony looks down to look at his neckless “ur yeah my mom gave me this on my birthday apparently it’s special” Tony said to Steve. “It’s beautiful, it suits you” Steve compliments without realising what he just said, Tony looks shock and he was blushing furiously which made him look adorable in Steve’s mind ‘god sake snap out of it’ “um what I meant to say is... um well ur” Steve stutters. Tony was looking at Steve with an amused look and then he suddenly giggled which he hadn’t done since he was at least 12.
Back again, sorry it took so long had a little bit of a writers block and I’ve been very busy recently too but I’m happy o got to finish this chapter for you lot :)
Then a big alien invasion happens, but the team fought them with all they got, then there was a missile aimed for New York, so tony did one thing that he could do, take it to space and so he did and what he saw up there terrified him. He almost died but didn’t, they arrested Loki, went to shawarma it was good Tony thought and then they said goodbye to each other as they wanted to do there own thing except for Bruce Tony manage to convince him to stay and become science bros. Tony shook hands with Rogers and apologies and so did Rogers but it wasn’t genuine he thought, god how did his mom even love that man tony will never know.
“Bambi fine thanks, he’s here at the tower already” he simply replied.
“Have you two notice that Thor keeps going down to Starks lab for the last serval days?” Steve ask the two spy’s.
A lot of teeth that biting into his lower lip, a tongue that was trying to gain access into his mouth and you know what tony let it, hell he embraced it nothing could fix anything like angry sex. Which surprise tony as yet again he didn’t expect Rogers to be into this, hell tony thought he was a virgin.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tony open the door and saw his beautiful mom on her bed reading one of her favourite books, “hi mom, surprise” he said gently.
“Jarvis where is thor right now” steve asked
Tobias laugh as he walk down the hall “I love you 3000” he shouted then he disappeared into his room. Tony chuckled “wow 3000, did hear that JARVIS my boy loves me 3000”, “ I did sir should I say congratulations” he spoke with some sass in his voice and Tony laughs at his AI.
Tobias looks at his dad again realising how much emotional pain he is in he sighs and relaxes a little. He smiles at his dad and Tony smiles back, “come on kid, let’s just go, we can talk about this later ok” he said tiredly, he just wanted a nice morning with his son and now it’s ruined he just wanted to go back to his penthouse and cuddle with his kid and watch some Disney.
“Sir I’m detecting that you are bleeding from your rectum I believe you have a tear and I advice you need to go and seek treatment” Jarvis spoke with a hint of concern.
“Steve it’s not my tale to tell, but if Anthony allows it he might tell you himself, but as of right now you don’t deserve that right” she said with sadden emotion in her voice.
Hope you all have a nice day 😁
Peggy could feel the tense between them so she decided to speak again “that would be lovely darling and Steve since we have cleared some things up, why don’t you now go and help your team at the crime scene I’m sure they need your help” Peggy suggested. Steve’s knows she only saying that to keep some space between him and Tony for awhile, even though he wants to talk to him badly but he knows Peggy has good intentions on doing this, Tony needs this and Steve himself and once thing have settled maybe they can finally talk.
“Oh that’s easy, there’s two reason why you’re here do you want to here them?” He taunts and Tony resisted to roll his eyes but instead he glares at him. Daniel laughs at Tony’s glare “aww aren’t you adorable, ok so first reason is because I want you here, you’re going to be my pet for as long as I want darling” he grins wide which scares Tony. “And the second reason is because me and Hydra know your little secret you got some special eyes or maybe more and we want to know what it is and see what we can do with it” he reveals and this shocks Tony’s how did they know about his abilities were they spying on him? Is someone he knows a mole?
“During that time mom was getting sick I guess  her memory got away with he” Tony said, “So was this what you wanted to talk about, our past and Hydra?” He asked.
“Sit” she ordered, and Steve complied. They sat down and Peggy look at Steve for a moment, how did this happen, what made him act like this Peggy wanted to know it hurts her to think that Steve was capable of being a bully, he hated them and now he’s one of them.
~~~~~~~~
Natasha and Clint where scoping out the area of where the Marks where killed, some of the SHEILD agents where there as well, helping out to gather any evidence of Hydra or Daniel for that matter.
Thor’s eyes widen “are you saying that you think me and Anthony are...” “having sex yes” Steve interrupted. Thor couldn’t believe what he was hearing from the captain, he would never think Anthony that way. Sure he is beautiful in every sense of the word, but thor cares too much to ruin the friendship that they have and there also the fact that Anthony is with the captain.
[Three hours later]
(See the end of the chapter for
Sorry it took awhile been rather busy with life and had a little bit of an writers block but finally finished this chapter woohoo
At this point both Natasha and Clint argue, while Steve was saying nothing he couldn’t shake the feeling about how Tony reacted to him and about that kid too it just didn’t make sense.
John told Tony once he had a lot of discrimination against him due to his race, because his mom was white and his dad was black. You see back then in the 60s when Davis was born, interracial relationships was still an issue so he got pick on a lot from the kids and the adults, and the older he got the worst it got too. But he never let it get to him once he got older as once he starting his career he met people who treated everyone equally and respected them too, of course Peggy was one of them and they been friends since he was just 20 years old, after all they both have the same abilities so it’s no wonder that they meet.
Let’s start at the beginning.
Pepper looked up at tony and gave him a glare. “ have you get your phone recently tony, the avengers have been trying to reach you for hours. I’ve tried to reach you for hours, have you forgotten what I was planning for you today” she said coldly which tony will never admit scared him.
[meanwhile in Fury’s office]
Tony could see Natasha face change like she felt that the situation here was wrong, “Steve I think...” she started but Steve interrupted her. “I don’t think you would be a killer Stark although you did make weapons that killed hundreds if not thousands of people because you were careless to check where your weapons were going” He sneered. Tony froze as he was back up against a wall, how could Steve so heartless, so cruel to him, by bringing up his mistakes.
Steve could only shake his head, “no it’s not about stark, Well it is but I was talking to thor and he has given him some new thoughts about stark” he explain vaguely. Both the spy twins were confused on what Steve was talking about.
Tony didn’t know what think of her plea for forgiveness, he was never going to forgive no way that’s for sure but she seems sincere maybe prison did some good, probably.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony didn’t know what to say to Steve or how to explain it. But now it’s not the time he had to go and get his son. He step away from Lily, “don’t ever come near me again and for your own sake leave as far as you can” he warned her and she nodded knowing what he meant.
“Sorry” he mumbled looking sheepish and couldn’t look at them. Then he felt a gently hand on his upper arm. He turned and saw his mom looking him with worry, “Darling tell me what’s going on?” she asked kindly. Tony looked at each person and when he saw his Bambi who nodded, he gave a sad smile on return. Tony sighed and looked at his mom “it’s a long story mom you better sit down” he said, his mom gave him a gently squeeze as a sign of comfort “Ok darling tell us in the beginning” . And that’s when everyone sat down and Tony begins his tale.
“To be honest I really don’t know” he simply said he can see Peggy was in thought for a moment then “you do realise that’s a stupid answer” she said bluntly. Steve gave a wet chuckle at that comment, he sighed and looked down to the floor “I am really sorry Peggy, I want to fix this but I don’t know how” he admits.
Tony went in to the kitchen to gather all the ingredients that he needed, whilst Tobias just sat at the counter and chatted to his dad about his studies. Whilst talking, Tony notice that he’s missing the sausages that he needed for the breakfast, sure that might be a minor thing but that’s always been there traditional breakfast.
The woman nodded “and what about Mr Stark what should we do with him?”
“Yo J any updates yet?” Tobias spoke up to the AI, “As of right now Young Master Carter I have narrow down at least 10 possible location that look similar to the blue print I found. I am currently narrowing down a bit further to find the one that is most likely where Sir is kept” Jarvis informs.
“Didn’t you say you’d found a way to call on your suit wherever you are?”
They didn’t tell each other about the visions Wanda Maximoff had given them. Something had sent Banner and the Other Guy into what seemed to be a deeper rage than usual, something had shaken up Natasha (the signs that she was shaken were infinitesimal, but even that was disturbing), and something had made Tony grind his jaw in determination and seem to double down on his usual self-loathing (which he hid almost as well as Natasha hid her demons, but the exaggerated boasting and posturing had long since given him away in Steve’s eyes). But Steve had no idea what that something had been, for either of them.
“No, don’t ... Oh, come on!”
“I doubt it.”
Tony stood up straight.
“You guys need help?”
“Well, for the first time I’m slightly relieved that I was frozen down long enough that I don’t have any living relatives who can read about my supposed affair with Howard Stark’s
Agent Hill open the door, looking rather irritated. “Sir, agent Barton, agent Romanoff and Captain Rogers would like to speak with you. They say it’s rather important” she said.
TBC..............
Tony felt rage and fear at the same time. “So what, is this why your back to come get some sort of revenge, well hate to being the bearer of bad news but you deserve it after what you did” he said coldly.
“J, can you be so kind to tell me why my beautiful music has all of the sudden stop it’s  kind of ruining my flow you know” he teased.
Woohoo I’m back with a new chapter
Bruce got a message from Jarvis to got to Tony’s penthouse and this concerned him, he was still waiting for the evidence to arrive, but yet he hasn’t heard from SHEILD which made him worried. But as for right now, he went out of his lab a and headed into the elevator “penthouse please Jarvis” Bruce said to the AI, “certainly Doctor Banner” Jarvis replies.
Then there was Thor who said that he will be waiting in his room for Tony to arrive and start their training.
~~~~~~~~~
Steve was shock at this, he wasn’t a bully, he hated bullies this can’t be right, right?.
“So the others two are getting Brucie bear and point break?” Tony asked like a whisper, Fury gave him a sympathetic look which was unusual in Steve’s opinion. “Yes, they should be here soon” he reply, Tony sighs “ok then I’ll we just wait until they arrive then I guess” he said nervously.
Hope you liked it and I’m hoping get to post the next chapter in a few weeks :)
But Natasha ignore it and continue their topic. “Ok sure, Stark does provide us with the equipment that we need to fight anything that the bad guys throw at us. But it’s his attitude that we are more concerned about” Natasha explain. Which Fury raise an eyebrow, he didn’t speak and let her continue her rant.
Steve was getting suspicious with stark and Thor, for serval days now thor keeps going down to Starks lab and not coming back up for hours. It wasn’t him who notice it, Clint and Natasha have thought the same thing as well.
Once they were inside, it was busy you could say. Important people everywhere, military men and women from captain to major, there wives and husbands who are lawyers, judges or businessmen. And let’s not forget the singles who are most likely top businessmen and the press who manage to get an invite inside of the gala. Tony was prepare on how to mingle with these people, he just hope the others will be ok.
TBC.........
“I’m fine” he whispered Ignoring the tears that came down his face.
“How the fuck did you.. ahh” Tony hissed in pain from the slap that Daniel gave him. Tony wanted to shout at him, swear and insult him for the monster that he is but Daniel wrap his hand around Tony’s throat and squeezes it tight. “Don’t you dare speak to me like that pet, you’re meant to be a good boy but instead you’re being a bad boy and bad boys get punish. Now I’m only doing a light punishment but next time I won’t be so kind, nod if you understand?” He growls and Tony with wide scared eyes nods.
“Sir, Captain Rogers is demanding to enter your floor” Jarvis burst out saying. God tony doesn’t want to deal with Captain self righteous right now or any of the avengers in fact he just wants to lay on his couch with the ice pack on his head and drink his smoothie.
The leader walk away and went to his personal office and picked up a small photo that had two young boys in it. Whilst looking at the photo he smiled to himself, his plan was finally coming together after all these years of waiting, soon he will have what he wanted, soon he will have his Tony back and couldn’t wait to get started.
Shacking off that memory, Tony gets out of his car and walks towards the house. He rings the door bell and waits for a minute, ten door open and he smiles “long time no see old man” Tony teased.

The right side of the bed was cold, Rogers left hours ago with out saying anything and now tony feels numb. He’s feels lonely and he wanted someone to be here with him to comfort him that’s all he asks for but life can be a bitch to him so he doubts anything good will happen today. Tony thought about what design he was going to do once he is in his lab.
Again hope you all like it and hopefully the next chapter won’t take too long.
In back so sorry I left it so long I’ll try to be more quicker with my updates next xx
Howard looks up at his son, he left some sense of relief in his son’s words “Thank you Anthony that’s means a lot. And I’m glad that Tobias is doing well, you’re a amazing father I wish I was there more for him and for you” he spoke with regret in his voice.
But they diminish over time and now, there only but few who still process the power that his mother gifted them.
I’m back with a new chapter
Steve looked at Fury straight in the eyes and said “Why did you really except Stark into the avengers, tell me the truth sir?” He demanded.
“I love you too mom” and tony left.
“Look Rogers I’m only going to say this once ok, you want to know the truth fine, Stark was brought to the team because he is different then most people a special kind like you or Banner, hell even Thor. But the reason was I owe him he’s been through a lot in his life and before you even open your god damn mouth to protest I’ll stop you right there” at which point steve shut his mouth. “Good, as I was saying I owe Stark and his family more than you know, but I also believe that stark can be of great us in this team for not only for this mind but his skills as well. I shouldn’t be the only one that see this you and the rest of the team need to see it as well and if you do you might actually see him in a different light” Fury finishes.
Tony sighed god how did he even get into this mess, oh yeah he knows, he knows damn well how that happen. It all started about ago two months after that stupid battle in New Jersey of all places.
“The time is 8:30pm Sir the rest of the avengers are ready and waiting down stair should I notify them that your ready sir? JARVIS ask
Steve paled, he thought he was subtle maybe not stark, as he limp a bit when he walks into the kitchen, ok so that was his fault but still he made sure that he wasn’t found out.
Anyways hope you like it and as always sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar
So that’s what Tony does, he’ll make sure he find his inner soul, make sure to be stronger. He needs to protect his family he has to, and this be the thing to do it.
Tobias look at his dad in shock and in fear, he knows this is serious if his dad is crying. “Will you tell me once we get to the tower?” He ask whilst gently patting his dad shoulder to give him some sort of comfort.
~~~~~~~~~~
Tony was lost for words this can’t be true, Daniel the man you was his best friend when they were just kids, the man who gave him his first kiss, the man he could of loved. But instead he became a monster and hurt like no one else has ever had.
I’m back sorry for the long wait this chapter was a bit tricky but I finally done woohoo
[Back in Fury’s office]
However, there are times were tony can be a little frustrating, he’s brash and too blunt to the point it comes across rude. He doesn’t listen to steve when he needs to and he puts everyone in danger. And he does disrespect somebody of the other team members, sure they are rude to him but tony goes for the jugular and damn right hurtful comments which aren’t necessary.
“So, I guess I’ll start by saying that I come from a some what unique family” he starts he can sense Clint was about to retort but he put his hand up before he could make a tasteless joke. “By saying that it is regard to my birth, you see Maria isn’t my biological mother, Peggy is” he confess.
Tony looked at the wooden box, it looked old but yet beautiful it had these patterns of swirls and a symbols that made it look majestic. He opens the box and inside he was surprise, there were three items inside, the first one was an old photo maybe from the 1920s or 30s it was a man and a little girl could that be his grandfather and his mom he wondered.
~~~~~~~
[Inside the Tower]
A large warm body was pressed up against him, but he felt the man shift. He knew that the man was up, he looked at the time 5am god why does he have to be up so early every time. The man got up and went to the bathroom, Tony pretend to be asleep and waited for him to leave. A few minutes later the man got out the bathroom and was about to leave the room until....
“ Steven I would never touch Anthony that way, he is yours, like you are his I will never get between that bond” Thor defends
They talked for an hour or so until tony realise he had to go back to the tower otherwise the team might actually kill him.
“Your room is just down the hall on the right JARVIS will help you if you need it” he said. Tobias nodded “ok thanks dad, good night and I love you” He said as he walked away, “Good night Bambi and I love you more” Tony spoke.
See you soon bye 😊
But life turns out for the better, in the end Tony made a new element and also had a ‘heart felt’ message from dear old dad ‘greatest creation my ass’ tony thought to himself.
But that was then, and he tried not to be angry so much, he tried to see her regularly, but with SHEILD, avengers and bucky it’s hard to keep up sometimes.
Then after a few minutes of silence torture Steve finally spoke up “ I’ve been having nightmares again, about the war, about bucky. It’s been going on for the last couple of weeks” oh god what is he getting out he thought to himself but he continues. “But after we had sex the nightmares stop and I wasn’t so stress anymore and tell me if I’m wrong but we didn’t had a single shouting match for about a week”
Please feel free to comment or kudos
Well I guess you have to wait and see.

[2 hours ago]
“Tony” Steve spoke softly, he felt of guilty about all of this, Tony’s Past was traumatic but yet extraordinary he wants to make this right to help Tony and his family that the best he. “Yes Steve” Tony said shyly, At that point Steve stands up “I am so sorry Tony, but I promise I will help you to bring down this bastard” he growls and shocks Tony. “Yeah man me and Nat can gather info about this guy whereabouts” Clint adds and Natasha nods in agreement.
People think that Fury hates him but in fact it’s quite the opposite. They’ve known each other for a long time and Tony tease Nick by calling him uncle when he use to visit his moms house, he miss those days some times.
A minute later, a very pissed off spangles came through the door. “STARK!” Steve shouted as he strides closer to tony.
“Tony how did you..” Steve tried to speak but Tony interrupted him “It’s a long story and as everyone is here I guess I start at the beginning with you guys” he tried to smile but from the way Steve was looking at him he failed in that regard.
Tobias looked at Steve with murderous eyes, and strangely Steve felt intimidated. Now he shouldn’t feel that way not to this kid, but the way his green and brown eyes boar into his soul make him feel unsettled.
“Ok so how do I find my souls point break?”
“The name of our abilities can be different around the world, we call it wolf sense, while other may call it truth seeker or even eagle v....” at that point Tony quick with his hands preventing Natasha from attacking him with a knife. “Nat what the fuck are you doing” Clint blurts out, Tony rolls his eyes “relax Legolas Nat here wasn’t going to kill me” he said simply which confused the team. “But Tony how can you be sure” Bruce shyly ask, “because he’s using his ability on us Bruce” Nat stated.
[2009]
Hi everyone hope you well and safe
Steve open the door and looked in and what a sight it was. Stark was spears out on the bed completely naked, he was also half hard and he was fingering himself and god that made Steve’s dick twitch at the sight.
Fury wasn’t gonna snap yet he needed a little bit more information from them first and judging from their faces, only Steve seems uncomfortable from Barton’s question. Hmm interesting.
Once Tony got into his lab( well more like an office really, it’s just a desk with some tools and materials around the place). “hey J put up the schematic would you please” “of course sir” Jarvis responded, the schematic was similar to the blade that his mom gave him on his birthday it was nearly. He had hope to incorporated into his suit but he hasn’t got enough time so instead he had to do plan B there was no time to waste and went to work.
He shrugged at Thor “Probably not, but does that really matter now” he just said. Thor wanted to argue, but he knew that would be pointless, Tony is a stubborn man. “Very well” Thor simply said, “let’s begin shall we” he spoke again and motions to the both of them to move closer to him.
Both of them looked up at him, Clint was the one who spoke first, “Yeah we have, are you jealous that our spoiled resident genius decided to go for more muscles” he teased.
“So.... are you three fuckers are going to tell me what was that I saw out there?” He questions them with a sneer. Before either Steve or Natasha could answer, Clint the idiot like he always is jumps in first. “It was Starks fault sir, what Steve said to him was the truth and he’s in questions for the Marks deaths, which I personally believe were murdered” he finishes with a smug look and at this point Natasha slaps him across the head.
The gala was meant to be a nice, peaceful gathering. But instead Tony got a surprise unwanted visitor.
It was cold, the forest was surrounded by thick fog, he couldn’t see anything. He needed to find it but couldn’t he shouted and shouted hoping it will answer him but it didn’t.
Tony sighs “Right now I need to get change for my training with Thor. And in the mean time the penthouse is yours to do as you please, just don’t break anything ok Bambi” he said jokingly. His son gave a small chuckle and they both went to their rooms.
TBC......
Clint hated stark, he was so arrogant and flaunts his fortune at anyone’s face to show how much better he is.
But he knows that would be childish and fruitless, what he said was wrong and perhaps too far. But there was so much that happen that he’s got more questions than answers, like who was that kid? , was he really Tony’s son?  and if so then how is that possible. The kid look like he is in his late teens and Tony is only 32 and if he is Tony’s kid then that means Tony was very young himself when that kid was born. Steve felt his stomach tighten, something was very wrong and he needed to know what the hell is going on with Tony.
Tony cringe from the touch and from Daniels words, he needed to get out. He hope that the Avengers will come to rescue him soon, but right now he needs to find away to escape on his own until the team comes. “Why are you doing this and where the hell am I?” Tony ask hoping that Daniel is stupid enough to give him a clue on where he is.
Enjoy 😊
Steve’s face even look more enrage from that statement, and then proceeded to grab Tony by the collar and pulled him closer to him. In any other situation this would be hot, but right now Steve is pissed.
Bruce is in between he talks to him nicely enough and they science too, but the first couple of days Bruce was, you could say disappointed which tony felt guilty.
Tony couldn’t say how long he’s been strapped to the bed, but he can say he was getting fucking annoyed about being tied down to the bed. The muscles on his arms and back were aching, he needed to move his arms as they were going numb.
[present]
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright big guy, when do we start?” Tony said. Thor had a big grin and his face “ right now, but first tell me who trained you and what have you learned” Thor ask. Tony hesitated at first, he wasn’t sure if he should tell the truth about his real mom, but Thor was the only one who showed him kindness, the one who listen to him the most. So tony decided to tell him everything, his birth mom, when his abilities develop, when his training started and who trained him.
Then warm feeling disappeared and Tony was back in the work shop, Thor was looking at him with a kind smile on his face. “So I was right your worthy and the mjolnir recognise you as one of asgardian children” he spoke in a softy voice tony never heard him speak in that tone before.
“I need you to get mom and Davis here, I want you personally to get them. Look before you ask why I know about Daniel and I don’t why you kept that from me so you and I will talk once you get here, but please Nick I trust you to get them” he rants
“Yeah sure I’ll do that for you kid and I’ve made sure my best agents are searching for that man too, you have my word Tony that I won’t let anything happen to your family while they under my protection. What about your son where is he?” Fury asked
As he walks deeper into the woods, this is when things start to change. Throughout his time of training Tony always ends up here. This place it’s cold, dark and evil, it’s like a inner part of his trauma morphed into this place. There’s a creature around these woods always ready to chase, always taunting him, the voice of this creatures was familiar, but Tony couldn’t pin point who it belongs too.
Natasha was confused on why steve wanted to see fury, what did thor day to Steve. “ Steve why do you need to see fury for?” She ask him.
His heart was beating fast, the chill was running down his spine, Tony was terrified and the creature knew it. “Aww Anthony trying to be a big strong man, but let’s face it you’re always going to be the little scared slut, your nothing but a hole to use, a toy to play with. You’re nothing boy, you hear me NOTHING” the creature shouts.
“Let him in J” he said
“I don’t know Clint, I watch Tony for months and not once I didn’t get the hint that he was in so much pain, we screwed up badly. But I swear to you that we will fix this, fix us, we will not make this mistake ag....” Natasha stop in mid sentence when she turned around towards the car and notice something odd.
And hope you enjoy this chapter :)
Though he gotta admit he does miss MIT, so maybe going back and get another degree in engineering wouldn’t be a bad idea.
He turned his head and gazed down his arm and then he like an idiot he realised that his bracelet where still on his wrists, he laugh in surprise “God for a genius I’m a fucking idiot” he mumbles to himself. Of course Hydra wouldn’t think that his bracelets were anything but jewellery but oh boy were they wrong, this would help him break out of these.
The team were brimming with energy, eager to fight. It’s been 12 hours since they had their meeting, Jarvis still hadn’t found anything yet but the team are still in high hopes that they find there genius soon.
He felt a hand on his shoulders he looks to see Peggy being much closer to him “ Don’t apologises for me darling, just be here for him now ok that’s all I ask for. I know he can be quite a handful, you just need a lot of patience and learn when he needs help” she said with comfort in her voice and Bruce smiles back at her.
“Is that how Stark sees it Captain?” Fury asked with a hint of anger in his voice. Steve was ready to reply but for once he wasn’t sure, first saw that and sighed again.
And I’ll will see you next time hope you all have a great day 😊
But anyways Steve shake his thoughts out of this head, “who the fuck are you kid?, who let you in here?” Steve questions. But the kid ignored him and went straight to Tony.
Steve was nervous as walk out of the elevator, he can see the others by the couches. Tony looked nervous as well and scared it worried Steve and wondered if that’s because he’s here. He didn’t want Tony to be uncomfortable in his own home because of him, he felt guilty of what happen and hope that he can fix this.
0.......
But unfortunately luck wasn’t helping him today as he spot pepper sitting by the counter drinking a glass of wine.
Clint gave a dark chuckle, but he didn’t speak it was Natasha instead. “He means that we got a report from SHEILD that showed that Lieutenant Marks and his wife died in what seems like a car accident a couple of hours after you left the gala abruptly.
With a pleading look in his face he tried to defend himself again “but... but Thor..” he trailed off but Thor decided he had enough of Steve’s excuses.
Megan gave a small smile “ she’s doing well today we had some difficulty yesterday. You see she had a slight panic attack as she didn’t know were she was, but today she is fully aware of her surroundings and seeing you today will be a nice surprise for her” she responds.
Fury grunts and motions Steve to follow him, “come on then, we better go back and you better pray that Tony will be willing for you to help him” Fury said as he walks out of the room.
And then there was Steve, It was so strange to him that Tony had these abilities and not only that being worthy to Thor’s hammer, to Asgard and now they have to train to unlock even more power, how strong is Tony really Steve wonders.
“So what’s the plan Tony?” Steve asks, Tony then became serious “first off, J make sure you surveillance every corner in this city, any car, truck or a plane that may look suspicious and also make sure our security is top notch”  He told is AI, “certainly sir” Jarvis replies. “Good now secondly you two” He points at Bruce and Steve “are going to look after my family and keep guard, while I be in my What you’ll call a mini lab” he told his team and then he remembers “oh and J be ready for the rescue suits for my family” he informs Jarvis “of course sir, they are ready when you give the your order”.
“I never blamed you for that you know, I never once thought it was your fault I got raped. The only people I blamed was those people who did that to me. Even though I wish it could have been differently  a good thing did came out of it I got my son who is becoming a man of his own I’m proud of him” Tony said trying to lighten the mood in some fucked up way.
Hope you all like it and keep a look out for the next chapter it going to be interesting though I’m not sure when it will be posted but hopefully it won’t take too long.
Steve was confused to say the least when he left Fury’s office, but one things for sure he needed to fix what ever mess he did. He needed to see Stark in a new light and see what Fury and Thor see in him.
“Sorry Pepper, there was a bit of traffic going on in the streets I should have called I’m sorry I didn’t I’ll get JARVIS to remind me to call you next time” Tony said sincerely. Pepper was taken back by his apology, she was ready to tear him a new one, but then again Tony looks worn down. She hasn’t seen him properly in weeks or was it months she wasn’t sure. But seeing him now, maybe she has been a bit too hard on him.
[somewhere in a deep dark forest]
Steve wanted to protest but then he saw Tony who jump in front of his mom “Steve please just go” He rasp  like he was going to cry. Steve never seen that from Tony before, did he really go too far?
Sure stark can be funny at times but Clint is sure that he just laughing at them and not laughing with them.
Speaking of the people, he should really listen to what they are saying. Quickly he got out of his thoughts and look at the trio in front of him.
Tony can only describe John as a good man, brave, wise and kind to him. John is now a retired cop, he’s was one of the best cops ever in New York City, he solved hundreds of cases with great results. He never backs down from a case even when others try to take him down.
He notice that wrist were cuffed and he was stretch out in a T position on the bed. Now in a panic, Tony open his eyes and looked at his surroundings. He notice that he is in nothing but just his boxers which made his stomach turn a bit. But what he finds is that he isn’t in his room at the tower, instead he’s in a large white and red coloured room.
“So, this coffee has been the light of my life for a very long time I think my body knows how to cope with that thank you very much” he said sarcastically. But Steve just grunted, “look I’m not here to argue or talk about your coffee, I’m here to talk about you” He said with a hint frustration.
“Actually, Steve is still at the bar talking to my husband” a woman’s voice spoke behind him and it send him a cold chill down his spine. No this can’t be her, no way.
Steve sighed and got out of bed and went to the kitchen in the common room to get hot chocolate according to Peggy it helps with sleep so he might as well give it a try.
Steve didn’t want to leave, he wanted answers, why is Fury and Peggy here? Who is this kid? And why did he say he was Tony’s son? How is that possible, Tony is too young to have this kid at his age right?
Tony hates being treated like, he was the only one who gets a dressing down from spangles and no one else does when they disobey. Ok, so they rarely ever do it, but Tony’s seen Clint and Natasha do it but Rogers doesn’t seem to mind so that just so fucking unfair as far as Tony is concern.
Peggy just chuckle which confused tony, “oh sweetheart, it’s not a present that I brought. It’s something that is past down to the family and I want you to have and maybe you could even improve it” she said.
Enjoy :)
“Men report” Daniel ordered
But Thor continues, “ if your s better man that all America thought you were, you stop hurting Anthony. You tell the others to stop hurting Anthony. But let me tell you captain if I ever hear or see that you continue this hatred towards Anthony, then I’ll show what I can actually do with mjolnir do you understand?” He ask with intimidation.
The man gave a sickening grin. “We will send a message, you know what to do” he responds.
Hope you all have a great day 😊
Tobias wanted to help people the best way he could and as long he can remember he wanted to be a lawyer.
But then he whined at the loss of the fingers, Rogers laugh “god your like a bitch in heat, the press were right you’re are a man whore,
To him, which made Tony relieved, he finally found it, it was there whole
P.s. also I wonder if you guess could help find a fix that I’ve been trying to find for ages but remember the name of it, the story was basically all the avengers were caught by some villain and the bad guy had this magic staff that can look into peoples past. He uses it on Tony and it shows how his life was very abusive ie his dad been the main one, but in the end was a happy ending and Tony and Steve got together, I know it was completed and I think it had either 6 or 7 chapters. Hope you guys can help me with this and also hope you all are doing well 😊
Then he walk away, he walk fast trying to escape the crowd. He could hear Steve calling for him in anger, but he didn’t care not right now he needed to leave now. But before he could exit the gala, Pepper step in front of him. “Tony!, what are you doing people are staring at you. Have you lost your mind, these are very important people and if you stop being selfish for one...” “Pepper stop talking alright” he voiced in anger.
“Yeah. I couldn’t find a cap plushie. They were all gone everywhere I went when I was looking for you.”
“Do you ? Or not ?”
“It's Victor Hugo, babe. He always chooses weird names for his characters.”
“What? Steve. Did you listen to a word I said ?”
“He once found an Iron Man plushie, and now he sleeps with it and thinks the other avengers don’t know about this. They do. Tony too.” And of course, Tony won, the animator saying he had a great imagination. Ha. And Steve did one for Tony too.
Rhodey was right, Tony knew this. But how could he ask the perfect and beautiful Steve out?
By hanging together, Tony learnt a lot about Steve. And Steve learnt a lot about Tony too. At first, they were a bit shy, for they didn't know each other really well. But now, things were different, and Tony and Steve were as close as two fingers of a hand. There was however a slight problem : Tony liked Steve. And not only as a friend.
Yes. He was. Steve made two steps forward, found himself less than an inch from Tony.
, they were still two idiots in love. In secret. The others, they didn't say anything either, but they knew. They figured it out immediately. How could they not, when it was all they could see ? But they talked, and decided to let them fix it, because it wasn't their place. (And also because Natasha had made a bet with Clint).
Tony spent about two hours in the store, taking books in his hands, observing and assessing them, skimming the ones that looked interesting. When he figured out what he was going to buy, he walked to the till. That’s when he saw him.
They were now back in the tower. If he was honest with himself, Steve was sad, because reality kicked him and he realised the day was over. He would never have Tony for himself like this anymore. But the day had to end, Steve couldn’t control time. He had to face the truth. They had a great day, but it was over now.
“Does it change anything ?”
“I’m Tony. And you can tell your mum that it’s a really, really beautiful place.”
“You and me both,” told Tony, and he turned around to look at the other man. God, he was beautiful.
And with that, Steve was kissing him.
“Look. He's handsome and nice. I like him” said Tony one day to his best friend.
Steve.was.kissing.him. Was this real ? Was this really happening ? Tony was so lost in his shock that he felt Steve pull back, and
“Got it.”
”I know the horrors humans are capable of inflicting on one another, Tony, I'm not stupid, I …”
“I’ll do more than that if you shut up.”
"Yeah."
“Tony, I’m sure Pepper never for a moment believed you’d give up the suit forever, and I’m sure she’ll forgive you when she goes to identify your body tonight.”
”We ran into an SS patrol, in Poland. Just a few guys and a truck. It was dark, on this forest road, far from the nearest village. We took them out quick, so that they couldn’t report our position to Hydra. One of the younger soldiers got hit in the gut and didn’t die right away, but Jones had seen something and called us over before we could decide what to do about him. And … There had been people, in the truck. They had led them out into a clearing in the forest, made them dig a hole, lined them up …” He had to stop and take a deep breath again. ”… lined them up, and taken them one by one behind the cover of dirt heap, made them strip, and shot them, sending them falling straight into their grave.
Tony hadn’t moved since Steve began telling the story.
“Oh. Right. That.”
“I said I understand it. Not that I found it hilarious.”
. The Waldorf Astoria, please. Stark Industries are paying.”
“You built 42 different Iron Man suits ...”
“Why? Are you jealous?”
“No.”
doing that, I’d be the one getting the best end of the bargain, obviously.”
“While talking makes you do
More than once since Maximoff had whammied Tony, out of the corner of his eyes, Steve had caught Tony looking at him with a look of pain on his face, and Steve worried that he’d somehow been part of whatever Tony had seen that haunted him so.
“She’s gone, Tony.”
And the ghostly smell of the pit full of corpses was chased away by the very real smell of Tony’s aftershave, musky and heady, smelling slightly like wood. To Steve’s surprise Tony hugged him back, and for a couple of seconds they stood there in silence, until Laura Barton shouted from downstairs: ”Okay everyone, dinner in fifteen minutes a d I mean it!” and Steve jumped back as if he'd been burnt.
Pepper slammed down the newspaper in front of Tony.
Steve had to make a longer pause. His lips were dry, his mouth felt like sand. He could smell the stench from the pit. There shouldn't have been that bad of a smell, no one there had been dead long. But they’d been dirty. They’d spent a while in that truck, considerably longer than just what it would have taken to drive out from the nearest village. They’d been rounded up like cattle, possibly from a series of villages and small towns.
“I know, right? I mean, I give them one little line about stripping and suddenly the whole country knows I’m having hot, steamy sex with Captain America. Obviously, that’s what ended my relationship with Pepper. She just couldn’t handle the competition. Wait.”
“Holy shit.”
“Don’t choke on your beer, soldier. How long do you think we’ll have to kick back and relax before that weirdo is back on the streets again?”
And Tony thought Steve was naive. Tony thought he had too much faith in the goodness of humanity.
“I told you, I destroyed all the suits.”
“You’re welcome. Nice punch.”
“No. No, it really isn’t!”
suits, per se. See I gave the specialized models different names so that ...”
“No! You look! That stuff almost killed me!”
“I don’t want to hear about your ... your boyfriends, Tony.”
“See, that’s what I ...”
“Good. And, you know, if we
“I’m sorry, are my flexible sexual preferences making you uncomfortable?”
“Yeah well, figuratively speaking, of course. I was just being poetic. I can be poetic.”
”That is not what a soldier is. Sure, there will always be opportunistic, twisted individuals in any large group of people, but that’s not …”
“He’s
“Careful, Capsicle. That’s a four-letter-word.”
“It’s an expression, Mr. General Audiences.”
”Well, we both agree that my so-called solution certainly turned out to be anything but.”
“You think the lid of a cooking pot is gonna be good stand-in for you shield? Really?”
“Ehrm ...”
“And you, Stark. Glad to see you weren’t serious about leaving the suit. What took you so long in here?”
"Tony!"
lllll
“Yeah. That’s pretty much what it feels like, too. Come on!”
“I think you’ll find there are very few things I haven’t done, Stevie-boy. Especially in the bedroom.”
Contradicting that statement, Steve’s neck burned with a rising blush as he turned and faced Tony again.
“You know I don’t understand half of your references, don’t you?”
“So, how long do you think our honeymoon will be?”
“Hi Cap.”
“They occasionally contain some interesting reading.”
”It changed
lllll
“Tony! Really, I ... I don’t think so.”
work. I don’t know if Dum-Dum was thinking the same thing, but as soon as we were done, he ran back to that soldier on the road, who was still wheezing and clinging to life somehow, and he stood over him and just … went berserk. Punched him over and over, and just screamed in rage. I had to tackle him to get him to stop. I know Bucky understood, but I think the others would have gladly watched Dum-Dum beat that boy to mush. Montgomery said the kid was dying anyway. We'd meant to kill him to begin with. Which was true. So I shot him. I just walked up and shot him right between the eyes. I couldn’t watch Dum-Dum do that. I couldn’t … I couldn’t let us turn into the thing we were fighting.” He looked up at Tony. ”But maybe a little part of you always does.”
”They called that a 'solution', Tony. And I’m sorry if I don’t understand the technological genius of your ideas, but every time I hear anyone, ally or enemy, talk about simple, one-step solutions to complex problems, I just hear … I just hear ’ultimate solution’. Well, I don’t believe in solutions anymore. I've spent my life fighting bullies, I did that before the war, I did it during the war, whether it was Hydra or an out-of-line Dum-Dum, and I no longer harbor any illusions that I won't be fighting bullies until the day I die, one way or another. And sometimes … sometimes the fight is where I feel the most at home. So you’re right about me. And you’re wrong.”
“I’ll stick with ‘sweetheart’, sweetheart.”
“Tony! It’s alright! I know you don’t believe I’m capable of it, but I do actually understand your humor. Better than the press does, apparently.”
“Did you just say ‘whatever’?”
“See? You have to learn to seize the moment, soldier. You sure you don’t want me to help you out, give you some pointers ... ? ”
Tony sends Thor a grateful smile, “Thanks point break, I am trying I swear it’s just hard you know” he told him shyly. And in return gave him a kind genuine smile “ it’s alright Anthony we got all the time in the world. Now I must go, enjoy your meeting young wolf” then he was gone.
Tony sighed and a small smile appeared on his face “ it’s quite late to talk, how about we get some rest and ask all your questions tomorrow ok Bambi?” He said with tiredness in his voice. Tobias looked at him with a sad look “sure dad, you promise?” He ask gently stepping closer to his dad “I promise” tony answer and they went closer to hug each other. Tony was so relived that his son was safe, but he would need to speak with Fury it’s no way he didn’t know about Daniel escaping prison.
Steve look like he just struck gold “Really? Yeah sure I promise, lead the way... Tony” god why did he had to say his name like it was the most precious thing the world.
Not only that, lovely spy chick inject him in the neck that apparently slows down the poison from killing him and she also gave him a lovely review ‘iron man: yes, tony stark: no’ how thoughtful.

He sucked the fingers like he would suck a cock, he wants to show Rogers what he’s like in bed after all lots of people have praise him of how good he is in the sheets department. He looked at Rogers wit a sultry look, he can tell that Rogers is turned on, he knows that Rogers wants him like all those men before him so this was noting new to him. It doesn’t make him feel worthless or use, no he just fine with that.

“Clint” she rasp “what happened?” She questions. Clint took a big sigh “thank god your alive Nat I was worried there for a second. The ambulance is on its way, one of our agents was a double agent, Hydra” he confirmed.
Stark around, he looked ill, pale even. He was all wide eyed that enhance his already brown doe eyes, which Steve will never admit to stark how attractive it was.
So I’ll see you soon
“ J, tell capsical that I kindly denied his request” tony said to the AI.
Tony had to think about this for a second, thors warning scared him, but Thor believe he will be able to master it, he had to do this right he had to take it seriously like when he trained with his mom and Davis.
“Tony, oh Tony” a mock whisper, he knows that voice.
Thor listen to all of it,
“STEVE”
What the fuck, do they think he killed them, they can’t think that right?. “You can’t honestly think I killed them, look I may be a lot of things, but a murderer isn’t one of them” He protest, this is getting bad quick and his son must be wondering where he is, god help him.

Before tony could even finish his sentence Rogers grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and slammed him against the wall. Tony was shock at this he never suspected Rogers to do that maybe he we went too far mentioning his mom.
he felt honoured to be told of this part of Tony’s life and he swore to himself he wouldn’t tell a soul. And with the information that tony gave him, he develop a plan that would benefit Tony’s training.
“Look Steve what happen last night was a personal matter and Pepper knows. I didn’t just leave, because I felt like it, I’ll call her later to tell her all the details I assure you and then we will both deal with the matter properly” he tried to explain professionally without sounding nervous in front of his team.

“If your going to see the boss man, then we’re going with you, we would like word with him about stark too” Clint continues.
It seem to work sort of and as Clint nodded with a big sigh. “Your right” he said, this is when he heard the ambulance sirens, “good they’re here, come on let’s get you up” he said to Nat.
