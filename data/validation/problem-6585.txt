Tony yanked down his pants. Tony’s hand tangled in his hair, dragging him into a deep kiss. Their tongues fought briefly for dominance before Steve gave into his submissive instinct. He was barely aware of Tony’s head bumping against his entrance. He hooked his leg around Tony’s waist, keeping him close, desperate to keep the closeness. They both moaned as Tony thrust forward, filling him in one full stroke. It was a frantic brutal pace between them. The only sounds were the slap of their skin and their cries of pleasure. Steve clawed at the cement floor, searching for something he could brace against. His alpha’s thrust grew rapid. They were close. He clenched around Tony, so needing release. It came when Tony’s teeth sunk into his neck. He screamed as a blinding ecstasy swept through him. Tony held him closely as he reached his own release. The alpha collapsed on top of him.
“I’m surprised. Does the great Tony Stark has time to spare for someone of such little use as me?!” he said.
He hadn’t begun firearm training with her yet, but he had taught her gun maintenance and safety. It took a week for him to convince her that touching the weapon wouldn't hurt her. Now, she could disassemble and reassemble every weapon in their training inventory in under a minute.
“Put on the suit lets find out,” said Steve. He needed Tony safe. If that meant by force so be it. He wasn’t going to lose him.
“Don’t do this.” Steve had been through so much. Both parents had. Tony was the one picking up the pieces.
Tony waved goodbye and man went running. As he made his way through halls piece armor attached to him. By the time he made it out he almost wearing a full suit. He grabbed the faceplate jetting toward him.
With that, they started searching for Piper's notes, finding two. One had a perfect diagram of a car, likely meant for Tony. Those with animals or motorcycles were meant for Steve.
“Only being thorough,” said Matt. He could probably get more from the billionaire, but then he thought of Steve. Matt took his signature stamp from his suitcase and pressed it on the document.
She quickly washed her hand and brushed her teeth before coming out. Rune was still out. Piper threw a stuffed animal at him. He huffed and threw a pillow at her, eyes still closed but aim perfectly.
She pressed against the bars, trying to get a better look, but it was impossible to get a good look.
Stardust by Artie Shaw started playing. A seam appeared in the cement wall. It slid away revealing a giant metal door.
“S.H.I.E.L.D. the good guys. My grandfather was a founding member. Apparently they were friends. And he’s Aunt Maria’s boss.”
She nodded. He sniffed himself unable to pick up on any change but trusted there was a difference. With the sheer amount of sex they had, it wasn’t surprising that he carried the alpha’s scent.
"Friends and family. Your grandfather and granny Peggy made me feel human. And then I met your father. He made me feel like an omega but also treated me as an equal. People love you. If you let us close, we'll be there for you to make you feel human. Let us show you how much we love you.”
He got out of bed, taking the crumpled letter from the floor. Steve took it to the sink and went in search of matches.
As they walked toward their mystery destination it grew colder. Her breath began to fog. The tile floor grew painful cold against her bare feet. She didn’t ask for Lena to pick her up. No, she wouldn’t show that weakness. Soon she was shivering.
He turned red, forgetting the alpha behind that earned the reaction. Steve pulled away. Wincing at the separation.
Tony flinched uncomfortably as the scent of burnt sugar and bleach filled his senses. He knew the trance-like state. Tony forced himself to purr. It was a deep raspy unused sound.
He wanted an honest answer. The slightest appearance of weakness could give away so much. She aimed a confused expression in his direction.
"It was fascinating before we get to the pup. We should discuss what I discovered about Steve," said Bruce.
Piper smiled and sat between her parents as Jarvis started the movie. Uncle Bruce and Aunt Natasha sat next to each other. For some reason, Uncle Bruce looked nervous. She shrugged, not getting adults. Halfway through the second movie, Piper started nodding off. She blinked and her friends started leaving. She waved sleepy goodbyes to them.
"We have to bring in an expert on genetics and neonatal studies. I'd recommend Dr. Edith Star. She fell off the grid a few years ago," said Bruce.
Steve took the alpha’s wrists in his hand, pushing him to the floor. He straddled the alpha’s waist. Tony was as confident ever.
“No, he’s an alien,” said Piper. That got a real smile out of Winter. It brought a usual but pleasant warmth to his expression. “Where were you during the Battle of New York?”
Polio - On Saturday, June 17, 1916, an official announcement of the existence of an epidemic polio infection was made in Brooklyn, New York. That year, there were over 27,000 cases and more than 6,000 deaths due to polio in the United States, with over 2,000 deaths in New York City alone. From 1916 onward, a polio epidemic appeared each summer in at least one part of the country, with the most serious occurring in the 1940s and 1950s.
He caught the omega in an embrace, bringing him into a kiss. His hands snuck into Steve's pants, moaning when he touched the lace.
“No, they want you there. Their entire reason them being there was to inject you with whatever was in that dart. I’ve already reported my findings to Director Fury,” said Natasha.
Tony flinched. He wanted to shoot out the windows and take his omega back. It wasn’t the right approach, no matter how tempting it was. Growling when the alpha of the apartment moved closer to Steve.
Rune offered her a cookie. Taking a bite without looking. Frowning when she tasted oatmeal and raisins. Oatmeal was one thing, but
"Even if nobody comes, I'll get us out. I don't know-how, yet, but I will get us out of here. It doesn't matter how long it takes."
"Her strength may make an appearance when her motor functions are more developed. Has she had any difficulty nursing?"
"Does it have to do with Piper?" Pepper knew Maria was head of the investigation, but Maria was incredibly tight-lipped about it.
Suddenly, Tony yanked himself away from Steve. Piper's faded scent clung to Steve. The sharp agonizing pain shredding through his heart almost made him believe there was shrapnel still caught within his chest. He took a deep straining breath.
“That’s not how it works anymore. You’ll be able to choose an alpha, and if none are to your liking, you’ll be allowed to go through it alone with the proper tools," said Edith.
“That would be extremely unlikely. This state is activated by three high pitched tones, inaudible to our ears but well within her range of hearing. Each tone lasts a certain amount of time and is played in a specific order. If there's even a slight variance, the soldier state won't be activated."
Lena stopped in front of the door of his enclosure. He backed off. Her presence was enough to make him go still.
That was all it revealed. They struggled against each other, landing a strike at every chance. He didn't know how long they fought for. A powerful blow the neck sent him to the ground. A cool metal hand wrapped around his neck, scruffing him. He went limp. Unable to fight the powerful command. All he managed was to hit the emergency button his bracelet. The alpha stomped on his hand, breaking his fingers, but the signal had already been sent out.
Tony nodded. Steve shakes with silent laughter, closing the space between them. Their forms lying side by side. Tony was gazing at him with admiration as if he were the most beautiful thing in the world. He caressed Tony’s cheek. Steve shivered at the sensation of arousal. Tony’s hand tangled in his hair, bring him into a kiss. Steve gasped into their kiss when Tony’s hand snuck down his stomach to his cock. His free hand ran up down his back. The alpha hot breath tickled over his skin. He looped his leg around Tony’s thigh holding close, increasing the friction. Their tangled moaning forms were pressed firmly against each other’s, their skin damp with slick and sweat. Steve whined when Tony broke their close contact. The alpha moved atop him. Their breathing came in heavy pants. He bared his neck in silent submission. Steve moaned when Tony's sharpened teeth grazed against his sensitized skin.
“They aren’t so bad. Pepper and Maria want us to start cooking healthier things. I guess that means raisins. So who you waiting for?”
Steve raised his shield, gun at the ready. The Avengers had split up to cover more ground. He heard a jet take off, but instinct told him his pup was here. Clint and Hill would catch the strays. Raising his shield in time to deflect a spray of bullets. His shield gonged as a mental arm slammed against it. He had a million questions for them, but none of them matter. Nothing would stop him from finding his daughter.
He took off from the garage. Barb’s ride was smooth. She was perfect. He stopped by a small park. Steve parked his bike. He walked into the park. He took a seat on a bench. There people walking their dogs. Children were playing on the swing set, their parent or nannies watching them. He itched to call Tony.
“Extreme emotion. Specifically anger. You more than anyone understands how dangerous that can be,” said Tony.
"In a way. You'll be in a structured setting where you'll be the focus of your educator's attention."
Piper woke up in a foreign space themed bedroom. She was in a space shuttle bed with Rune still asleep beside her. A solar system lighting feature spun around the room. It even had all seventy-nine of Jupiter's moons. Nodding off in chair was Daddy. He looks so tired. There were bags underneath his eyes.
He put Piper in the playpen. She whined, pressing against the mesh barrier of the enclosure. "It will only be for a little while, Piper. I need to make dinner,"
Steve nervously ran his hand nervously through his hair. With all, he was feeling why was guilt among them. What Tony said was true. Even with all his power, he failed to save his best friend. Tony only pointed out what he already knew, but that didn’t stop it from hurting. He hadn’t even looked back. There was such deep regret in his voice, but at the moment he didn’t care. What was he thinking? Tony didn’t care! Steve realized he was shirtless.
Winter was brought to ground. Before he even had the chance to get up, the heel of a boot came crashing down on his head. A pack of alphas surrounded him, striking him from every angle. All he could do was curl into a ball, protecting his head.
Tony came out of the haze when the threat was handled. His breathing was heavy. It had been years since he brought into such a state.
Those crystal blue eyes snapped open. A kiss was pressed against his lips. He pulled away throwing up into the toilet. Tony slowly raised his head and flushed.
“I can, but not on my own. With you and her parents' help believe recovery is well within her grasp.”
Fury directed Loki to his cell. Loki paced the circular cell, before standing in the middle. Fury took a position at the control panel.
, he didn't want a new task. He wanted to go home. Fury pointedly blocked the only exit. Steve doubted he could fit through the window in the bathroom, so he would just have to hear what the man had to say.
Piper crept closer but he didn’t look at her. The lack of response meant he didn’t believe she was a threat. He stunk of sweat. When was the last time he bathed? Under the body odor, there was something … something that reminded her of home. He smelled of pine and mint. Piper’s eyes watered at the memory but she pushed back the tears. Focus.
Steve leaned against the fridge. He hoped Thor was alright. There were few signs of the demi-god since Greenwich. Thor could handle himself; he was sure the man was fine.
Tony hadn't thought it would work so well. Omegas' neck was sensitive even more so in Steve's case since his heat was suppressed so long. Steve was steadily leaning more of his weight against him. He moved a pillow over his lap, resting the omega's head there. Steve's distress disintegrated was replaced by that heavenly vanilla honey scent.  He massaged the muscles of the omega's neck, hitting the right places. Soon Steve was putty in his hands.
Steve took his hand, leading him to the kitchen. He grabbed a loaf of bread from drawer and cheese and butter from the fridge. Steve made them a grilled cheese enough for the two of them.
"It was,” she nodded. “Along with other penguins he'd saved. Theodore couldn't believe it. He almost didn't recognize Steve, who had lost his fluffy baby feathers and grown into a strong penguin against all odds. Steve and Theodore along with their new friends fought back against the elephant seals, freeing the beach."
Steve's pupils retracted to normal size. He bit down on a pillow, trying to hide his agony. His form quaked with deep pain. He writhed. Never in his life had he felt anything like. His muscles contorted angrily against him.
Their tongues fought for dominance. Eventually, he gave in, allowing his alpha to take control. He was pinned between the glass and his alpha. Tony’s muscles flexed possessively around him, keeping him close. His fingers tangled in the alpha’s thick brown hair, preventing him from breaking their kiss. Their hips rocked together, creating wet friction, causing them both to moan. Steve broke the kiss. Both were left panting. He turned, so his chest was pressed against the glass. Steve spread his legs.
"His mistreatment of test subjects was well documented. Though that didn't stop S.H.I.E.L.D. from offering him a position on their research team. He refused. Igor immigrated to Slovakia in the mid-'50s with his son Ruslan. There they changed their names to Martin and Thomas Toth.”
Steve arrived back at the New York S.H.I.E.L.D. facility at eleven that night. It would be close to one in the morning when he got home. He swung onto his bike, starting up the engine and speeding home, not caring if it earned him several tickets. Steve pulled into the garage. He toed off his shoes before entering the penthouse.
Steve found two bowls and filled them with stew. He set them on the counter. It was still pouring outside. Tony came back wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt.
Tony nodded. When Steve was settled he returned to work. At three in the morning, he decided it was to get some sleep. Steve would want to leave at the crack of dawn. He had maybe two hours to sleep. Tony went to wake Steve, gently shaking him. Steve grunted clearly not wanting to be disturbed. The omega yanked him on top of him. He was pinned against Steve’s firm form. Steve’s arm circled snuggly around his waist. Looks like he was sleeping like this.
Steve leaned over, kissing the alpha on the cheek. They were relieved when they got to the hotel. The hotel had gotten them a bottle of champagne. Their bags and clothes were already there. Among bag was Tony's Mark-6 suit. They’d only be staying here the day than leaving for their honeymoon tomorrow. Steve kicked off his shoes and unbuttoned his pants.
“A new neighbor got in a fight with his boyfriend. I let him stay here until things settled down,” said Matt.
The statement made Steve realize how little he and Peggy truly knew each other outside of that work environment. Maybe it was the adrenaline caused by war but she was a comfort and he did love her. She was safe. In his heart he still loved her, but their story was over. His attention refocused on the photos on the coffee table.
He stopped by one of the drawers, pulling it open. Lingering on the lingerie tucked into the corner. He promised. It excited him. Maybe it would serve as a temporary distraction for Tony. He tucked a random set into his bag. When he went to the kitchen was struck by the smell of bacon. Steve hurled barely making it to the sink. Now he had to brush his teeth again.
Steve paused in his pacing only to punch a large hole in the wall. The turmoil of his anger could be clearly seen in eyes. Along with the deep sadness. He wiped the drywall from his knuckles. His form thrumming with emotion.
“Took community art classes whenever I could afford to, but I couldn’t afford college. Since I was ill so frequently, it took me longer to graduate from highs school, so I was held back,” said Steve.
“I’m under strict orders not to tell anyone of your condition by Fury. Especially Stark,” said Phil.
Tony flopped onto his back when his knot released. Steve moved to his side and huddled close to him, hiding his face in the alpha's neck.
The tension at Pepper’s house had been soothed for the moment. The three of them sat at her coffee table trying to relax. Wine had taken the edge of Pepper and Maya, but Steve remained alert.
Steve's concentration broken when the door to their bedroom slammed. Tony came storming into the studio. Aggression, anger, and hurt were leaking off him in waves.
“Having you here is not something to motivate, Tony Stark. It’s umm it’s actually more embarrassing than that. You’re here as my uh-
Steve tackled her, pinning her to the floor. He slammed her hand against the floor until she forced to let it go. He growled baring his teeth. Something skittered across the floor, out of her line of sight. Nat stayed calm waiting for Steve to come out of his agitated state.
“I promised I would come back for him. I won’t leave my friend behind. I don’t care how long it takes,” said Piper.
“That was impressive. You're fast, but you've got to have thicker skin. The reaction is half what they crave,” said Steve.
Winter did not recognize the pup. She was hunched over, her fingers curled into claws; her snarls the only sound echoing through a stunned silence. Glass crunched harmlessly underneath her feet as she strode closer to him. She timidly touched his swollen face, whimpering softly.
Tony nodded. The footage appeared in front of him. Something was calming to watching the omega sleep so peacefully. He lost track of time as he worked.
“It’s nothing,” said Steve trying to refocus on his current task. Steve was blushing. Tony smirked as he wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist holding him close. His hands traveled under Steve’s shirt.
“What is it, Rune?” asked Steve. He may have a better chance of regaining her trust by going through Rune.
There had to be more reason than that. She wouldn’t have fought unless she had to. Rune was innocent in all this. He was another pawn in the game.
I'm sorry this update took so long. My update may be a bit sporadic but I'll try and get better. I've not given up the story.
Rheingold Beer - was brewed at Rheingold brewery in New York holding 35% of the state market at its peak. Every year the would hold a Miss Rheingold contest the winner would be featured in the beer's advertisement. In the 1940s and 1950s in New York was a highly anticipated event.
With all his time on stage, Steve was used to putting on a fake smile. He could get through this. Some of the questions proved harder than expected. They were of ethics, public knowledge, and what the world should expect after this. These were mixed easier, softer questions about their romance. That’s what half the audience was here to see. Steve kept up appearances. He felt every second of those two hours. Finally, it was over. As soon as their dressing room shut, Steve hurled into a trashcan.
“Writing condolences to the families of lost soldiers was the worst part of my job. I lost count of how many I’d written over the years of war. It was the least I could do. I can’t imagine how difficult it would be confronting their families in person,” said Steve. Sharing that bit of information calmed Tony.
"What do you want to do for your bachelor party? As your best man, I should have a clue on what you have planned," said Rhodes.
“I’m more than just Captain America. Sometimes people don’t see that. I’m more than just a soldier,” he said.
He nosed against Tony's neck. Before he wrapped his arms around the alpha's waist he shot from the bed.
Tony set her down on the changing table. He took a breath before unfastening the diaper, throwing it out and putting her in a fresh one. Ever since they'd started introducing solid food her diapers had taken on a new level of stink, apparently, that was normal.
Tony went to the lab. Taking out the communicator that Thor had given them in case of emergencies. Thor had given each of the Avengers one. Tony smirked when he heard a beep then a recording telling him to leave a message.
Phil explained the new functions S.H.I.E.L.D added and the electric start. He easily started the engine. It purred loudly.
Steve drew a breath, his chest tightening. Piper squeezed his hand releasing the clenching hold in his chest.
In 1960 the first oral contraceptive was approved by the FDA as contraception. The Supreme Cout in 1965 gave the right to use birth control ruling it was protected by the constitutional right to privacy.
Tony stayed up a few hours after Steve had gone to sleep, listening to Steve’s gentle breaths. It had been so long since he’d seen his mate in such a peaceful sleep. Eventually, he fell asleep to that image.
“We believe you’re about to be drawn in the Mandarin campaign and we have to get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.”
He tried soothing her. Steve raised his shirt, trying to get her nurse to preoccupy her. She pushed away from his chest, whining. They switched off, walking her up and down the aisle of the plane. They landed around 9:15 pm. A car was waiting for them. Piper was still crying.
“Soldier?” asked Steve. Female betas or omegas were unheard of in the military in combative roles of the military.
“You don’t have to do this in a few minutes they’ll be healed,” he said. His cracked ribs would take a few hours to heal, though.
Piper jotted down her answer. She grabbed the packet and went into the living room where Papa was looking at something on his tablet. She climbed onto the couch, peaking over his shoulder, catching the glimpse of the title
Steve's sweet exterior was worn away from the show. What remained was tired and moody. It was clear he was done for the day. Their bond did little in helping Tony navigate his mate during this time. Steve's state was in flux. He ran his fingers through his mate’s hair easing him into sleep. When they pulled into the tower garage, he almost did want to wake him. He gently nudged Steve awake.
She wiped her ink-covered hand on her shirt, trying not to get any on the steps. Piper crumbled up the pieces of the pen in some paper. She’d throw it away later.
She smiled. He went to the closet grabbing the unopened Ergobaby baby carrier 360. Tony ripped open the box. Piper watched him from the playpen. He adjusted the straps and put Piper in facing his chest, so she wouldn't accidentally grab something he was working on. She smiled nuzzling into him, happily cooing.
Her every action seemed to be judged. She stepped backward, not wanting risk getting into trouble. Winter kneeled in front of her.
Steve left Stark Tower, starting an easy jog. He still found the building ugly, but it was home now. Normally, he would do two or three laps around Central Park, at a sprint, but Steve decided to take it easy today. He stopped at the 107th infantry monument. Steve always stopped by it. It was dedicated to the men in WWI.
"Steve, it's made of fiberglass and has wooden teeth. It's not real. And not nearly enough of an excuse for me never to see you laying on the beach again."
“Welcome to the future, Captain”, Zola said proudly, holding the door open for him as they stepped inside.
“You are staying away from him, do you hear me?” the blonde said firmly. “You’re not to see him or even talk to him again."
His threats were cut short when Steve’s vibranium shield hit his suit of armour, sending him a few metres back.
“I wouldn’t put it like that.. we’re not in a phase where people walk around with oxygen support and huge anti-pollutant suits like astronauts do.. but that’s exactly what we’re trying to prevent here”
Steve stayed silent, the card still between his fingers. He could see how hurt Tony was, maybe he could still feel something after all, and he might have been harsh to him. Thinking like the way he knew, he followed him, only to find him at the same spot that Coulson’s body was a few moments ago, the blood still visible on the wall. A soldier who lost a comrade in battle needed comfort, and as a Captain he needed to provide him with that.
“Japanese food? No.. can’t say I have..”, he blinked, narrowing his eyes at the images. “That doesn’t look very tasty..”
Tony’s heart suddenly felt heavy. He stood up, leaving Steve at the spot as he moved inside, taking off his suit and sitting down, an empty stare painted on his face.
Steve walked inside slowly. It was daunting to be in such a large room when there was only the two of them, but he walked up to the telescope-like item and tilted his head at it. “What is this?” he asked with a baffled expression.
Tony was enjoying every single moment, taking in everything that was happening as Steve started to become even louder, panting and moaning, finally finishing while crying out his own name, something that filled him with so much more satisfaction than before, seeing how the liquid seemed to be running down Steve’s thighs and on to the suit, touching it with his finger and bringing it up to his lips, taking a teasing, smug lick, before pushing Steve’s hair out of the way.
“That you have your ways with the women of your city,” Steve said, keeping his eyes set down into the contents of his glass, staring at his own reflection, tainted red in the wine, “and of other cities.”
Tony rested his head on Steve’s back, smiling dazedly at him, his cheek against Steve's back. “You know, I don’t believe that this was wrong. At all,” he said.
“The last report we ever got of you being alive, was back in the 40’s, you dived into the ocean, didn’t you? The date today is...”, he stopped, not sure how the man would react to the news. “..the 15 of January..2013..”, he said, swallowing down.
Steve enjoyed kissing Tony's skin, pushing himself up against him to lick up and down the tendons in his neck, his hands firmly in place. He didn’t want to admit that he was falling for this man, just as he had fallen for the girl before. With her, he had made no move. With Tony however he couldn’t hold himself back. Without Falcon there to stop him, to be his moral compass, he was very easily swayed. And he opened his heart to Tony; especially when it meant that Tony would protect his people instead of slay them.
“But you can’t say it was a lost battle,” Tony pointed out. “Your technique was really good; I’ve never seen anyone using a shield as an offensive weapon before.”
Tony had had his eyes fixed on Steve when he uttered those words until he noticed Steve's eyes widening, the man behind Steve holding his own very spear - a gift from the gods themselves – where it pierced through the dark armour.
“I do know that our weapons are Stark Industries branded. And that his missiles gave us a huge advantage at the most dire situations.”
Tony rubbed his cheek in surprise after the kiss, smiling at him. “I’ll keep it in mind then,” he nodded as he placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “When you’re here, I will always be this Tony.”
Steve nodded to him and walked forward, opening the main door of the building, walking up the stairs. “The last step is a bit creaky.. the landlord would always tell us to skip it at night to avoid causing more noise..”, he told Tony as they stopped in front of a door. The building looked so dusty, and Tony tried to ignore the mould creeping in the corner, staying close to Steve when he stared at the wooden door with the number 8 on it.
His tone was a mix of surprise and excitement, he was honestly in loss of words, not knowing what to say, what the appropriate reaction was.
“No. You’re a recovering alcoholic.”, Steve growled; he would never forget his talk with Tony, watching him being so desperate for a sip from his bottle on the floor, unconscious when he busted into his hotel room in flames to rescue him.
“I wouldn’t say it was without cause”, Tony said, one eyebrow rose. “I challenged you, didn’t I? You used your shield to defend yourself, that wasn’t fighting. If you weren’t an Athenian, you would be praised for shedding that blood, it would have been a sign of victory.”
He missed it. He actually did, he missed chatting with Steve, suggesting movies and shows to watch, music to listen, a new takeaway place to try out. It was fun, relaxing and casual, exactly what he needed to make sure that he was actually feeling good for a change. A changed man, that what he said he was when the reactor was removed from his chest, leaving a huge scar at its place, when he waved goodbye to his suits. It didn’t last long; the world needed protection and his suits were needed again, so he threw himself into work, especially now that he found himself more alone again. Building, night and day, making sure that his suits were even better than before.
“Not bad at all! What about walking?”, Tony prompted him, and Steve could hear the eagerness in his voice.
Steve bit his lip. “No rules and customs?” he replied. “But law, and legislation, is reliant upon rules being set in place.”
“I'm…”, Tony whispered. What was he supposed to say? That he was sorry? Did he honestly hoped that an apology would solve everything?
Once they were secured, he finally had all the time in the world to open the bag where they kept the Gauntlet. His eyes were shining once again; at last, an artifact, an ancient relic of the past was in his touch.
Every hit counted, and soon they managed to push him closer to the gapping portal. “What about now?!”, Steve asked Reed.
“Tony! Stop staring and go inside!”, Steve shouted as Tony froze in place, just looking at his once business partner being turned into a monster right before his own eyes.
Steve looked over at him sadly. “You stop yourself from changing,” he admitted. “So many barriers, so much chaos and you’re torn between becoming a good person... And being a God.”
Tony came down the stairs, buttoning up his Armani blazer and smiling at the newcomers. That guy certainly had a sauve air about him, and he reflected his father’s (as seen from the videos, of course) attitude, which Steve was still in the process of trying to decide if he liked it or not. Still, there was something about that man, something that he couldn’t place his finger on. Not in a bad way, of course, but then again, they didn’t really introduce themselves to each other.
Tony stared at the glass, looking at the scientists straight into their eyes with a victorious smirk.
The walls were painted in a beige colour, the wooden furniture blending just in, especially the large, king sized bed with red duvets. The new means of technology that were prominent in the rest of the building were present in the bedroom, like a big TV screen on the wall and a monitor on the mahogany desk.
The blonde moved something from the back of the closet, taking a dark green uniform outside and placing it carefully on the bed, dusting the pins on the shoulders and chest carefully. Tony recognised it from the various photos he had seen of Steve in old newspapers, even though they were extremely rare; it was easier to find photos and articles of him in his Cap attire instead.
He decided not to mention the fact that Happy told him a few things about his life, he wanted to hear them out of Tony.
“You use me as a scapegoat, you bring me here then mock me and my teachings, and then you use your sharp tongue to cut me,” Steve answered. “I will not be a victim of your abuse, or any other Spartan. I pry into your reputation and you use it as an excuse to talk about how once more, your people are superior. Any excuse to wedge that in, of course. So yes, you bring me here just to laugh, as though I am your entertainment to make up for your lack of theatrics. I am a fool to have had such hope for a man who crushes dreams.”
Steve had never felt so embarrassed in his life, holding his hands up to his face as he tried to run past them, only for Falcon to grab his arm.
“I expect nothing more than to be cared for,” Steve said, mulling over the idea that it could be a sign, praying that it was the approval he had sought from his mother so badly. “I want this, Tony.”
Tony nodded in return, moving to settle himself on top of Steve, his long hair covering the side of his face.
“Yeah, good idea”, Tony replied, rushing outside the room with the Captain, protectively helping him up, his captain-like instincts kicking in.
“So what, you can call me Winghead or something?”, Steve laughed. “If that’s the case, I’ll have to call you Shellhead in return.”
“In this instance, I am not following blindly; I know she is looking out for me. Her intentions are to protect me from what plagues those who open their hearts,” he said, and he had never really answered that question until just now.
“More than you can imagine, really. I guess, I could come even if your teeth are okay.. Does that count as a date?”
“Stop the car right there, please”, he said once he spotted the old building he used to live in, getting outside the car before Tony could do the same.
“Don’t try to play that card on me! A break means you’ll leave and never come back, just tell me that you’re leaving me now, it will hurt much less”, the billionaire replied.
“Perhaps my journey here was not so fruitless after all,” Steve said with a smile, touched by Tony's words, with genuine hope starting to glimmer within him once more.
Steve relaxed, trying to figure out if he was doing the right thing, wondering whether he could really change destiny if he fought against it.
He didn’t falter, not once, even as he stood so close, his hand reaching for the chin that was close to his and lifting it to stare directly into Tony’s eyes. Tony heard his words as he kept his eyes narrowed, always tired when Athenians would bring up the same argument, always considering Spartans to be less civilized than themselves, always thinking that they wanted help.
From the hill they could see the lights of fires lit in people’s homes and the other buildings, the small dots flickering now and then. Steve would go there to think when he needed space, knowing that few people were able to enter the armoury or make the long voyage to get to it. “You seem to be good with luck,” he said. “I mean, you have a lot of it, it seems.”
“Come..”, Steve lead them to the kitchen, their two cups sitting there, with steam coming out of them. “I got the hot chocolate ready but I need your help with the last bit.” With that said, he pulled out the biggest pieces of marshmallows that Tony ever saw, placing one at every cup - it was hardly able to fit in, which confused Tony. “Can you toast them for us? Like that one time that we made smores?”
Steve glanced at him, and Tony nodded. “Yes, let me stay in Athens for a while, have a change of heart,” Tony encouraged him, pushing the hair out of his face.
Just like that, the first kiss came, and so did the confession. It was definitely nothing like the way Tony pictured everything to be. It was clumsy and sloppy, but somehow it felt right. And the fact that Steve actually responded to his feeling left Tony astonished. Steve Rogers,
“Yeah! Well, we can test them now, but I used my new repulsor technology to ease the propulsion so in theory, they should work like a charm”
“Is that it? You just saw a fairy, a real one, and you are just going to go back to sleep? Are you not interested in the slightest about me?”
With another loud shriek, he felt a painful jolt of electricity running from his head to his legs; he couldn’t move them anymore, their functions were disabled, and he knew that he could so easily take that controller away from Zola’s hands and restore the power. That was if he was able to walk there. He used the power he had in his hands to try and get closer, but an armed man came close and kicked him back on the ground.
Tony internally cursed his big mouth; he should have spoken after all this, not during the progression of what it seemed to be such an intimate moment for them.
“He’s responsible for, this, and you shall stop before you’ll be forced to suffer the consequences of your actions. Do you want to face divine punishment?” he asked them with a striking voice.
Steve panted, “That was a... Dirty trick.” He panted, his head rested just by Tony’s shoulder, watching him and how pleased with himself he seemed to be, the sticky liquid covering his upper leg and hip.
Most of the time he blamed it on the heat of the moment, their sweaty and exhausted bodies high on adrenaline perhaps seeing things that weren’t exactly there, his more..animalistic urges coming out when they both were at their most vulnerable state. And most of those times, he couldn’t help but think that Tony was throwing him an invitation of sorts, by how he loomed over him, lips apart, with no intention of moving.
Steve's eyes widened at the revelation. “Do you think? That she’s allowing me to love?” he asked with hopefulness in his voice.
And Steve braced himself. Knowing that the man was in front of his people again, he expected Tony’s attitude to switch back into that of the son of Ares, his eyes lowering at the thought of it.
Steve ran ahead, clearing the way for Tony, looking behind his back to make sure that he was following closeby - what was he doing?!
“Such a mind-set is bound to be able to change, over time. Patience my friend, which is a virtue.” Steve said, getting to his feet and lightly patting Falcon on the shoulder.
“Tony.. what is.. that?”, Steve asked carefully, letting go of the engineer and standing in front of him, shielding him from the potential threat.
That’s why when he saw the first opportunity to jump in another adventure, he didn’t think twice about it. He needed to be quiet about it though, he attracted too much attention lately, so his usual associates just wouldn’t do it this time around. And that was when the Commander walked into his office. Dressed in a dark blue waistcoat, blonde hair slicked back and having the posture of an obviously military experienced man.
“Negative”, the billionaire replied from inside the suit, still seated on the table, arms at side. “Those functions are exclusive to the Captain”, he said again, giving Steve some time to process what he said. “They are not defensive or offensive, they are part of Mr. Stark’s entertainment scheme”, he added.
He even stepped down to the workshop, inspecting all the suits that were left idle; he was scared to tinker with him out of respect, but Steve prompted him to go ahead and try them out. After all, he had to be ready to use them if Kang set an attack on them.
Much to his annoyance, Steve could read Tony like an open book. Tony noted how Steve seemed to fold his arms and watch him carefully, which caused him to move into his seat, feeling like Steve could see right through him. And he was right, Steve knew exactly how messed up, fragile and broken Tony was, which annoyed the young genius so much, that much that he locked the Captain away, refusing to let him in for days. He hated that, he despised it when people saw past his disguise, even if he let out desperate calls for someone to do that. With Steve though it was well.. different. The Captain seemed to respect Tony’s wishes after a while, not imposing himself and giving Tony all the space he wanted, which always ended up with Tony coming back for more of the soldier’s comfort.
Tony chuckled sadly, his palm over Steve’s hand. “I’ll remember that promise.. Don’t let me down, I will do my best to not let you down either”, he nodded, shutting his eyes, letting Steve pull him closer for a hug, both of them sitting on the bedroom floor, by the bed they shared for so long now.
Tony of course rewarded him, kissing the huge wet nose and Steve chuckled, a weird sound but cute nevertheless, at least to Tony.
“Why did we stop?”, he asked the driver, who simply pointed in the distance, where the helicopter above them turned its lights to.
“You know, they deserve to laugh over something that doesn’t involve killing something more… innocent people, if you want to put it that way. Especially the children. We are raised in a very particular way, it’s almost not fair," he admitted.
“Yeah, I've seen that. You’re messed up, all of you”, Tony hissed, hating the fact that he didn't have his armour to protect him right now; it was probably still in shard somewhere in the background, locked away from him. Being a common prisoner to those doppelgangers was something that he wouldn't tolerate in the slightest.
“I don’t regret coming out here with you," Tony said after a couple of moments of silence, slowly drifting to sleep, kept warm by Steve’s body.
“Come on, don’t be so difficult. I’ve read your files, you don’t really have a place of your own after you came back from your round. We’re offering you a new life and a home, Rogers. You should at least consider it, spend tonight there.”
“I don’t like goodbyes…”, Steve whispered as he hugged him close, and this time around, Tony didn't pull away or didn't react to it; he wrapped his own arms around Steve and smiled to him.
This man worked with his father back in the day, in fact, most of the things Tony himself knew about the Captain, besides facts stated in his old film reels and comics, were drunken statements of his father. To hear everything that happened back in the day from the hero himself however, was a different case. Those thoughts really kept him going, but eventually, he lowered his head, the tiredness of the day getting to him.
Tony chuckled, throwing Steve the device, who did what he did best - smashed it on the ground and placed his hands on his waist.
“I’ve been wanting to meet you for months now, I’m not going away just yet!”, Tony exclaimed as he flew on the bed and took a sit, crossing his legs and arms.
Steve had known this would happen if he came to Sparta, that he would get his morals questioned and picked apart, and who was he to walk into a land and change them entirely? He kept quiet with a bitter look on his face, narrowing his eyes a little and pursing his lips tightly.
“I’m surprised you know of it,” he said, walking down the many staircases, the amphitheatre already crowded. Many of the locals took the good seats at the front; royalty tended to sit near the back for a better view.
When they finally reached the city walls, Tony was amazed by the marbled structures and columns, walking through the different places in the Agora, already hearing so much. Even the way the people talked was slightly different to the way he was used to. Nobody seemed to really pay attention to them, as they were busy themselves, and he found himself wandering around with Steve having to pull him close in order to not get lost.
Steve sucked on Tony’s nipple, groaning softly at the familiar taste that he’d enjoyed. His other hand stroked Tony’s well defined stomach muscles, trailing along each small bump and dip.
“And why don’t you tell me more about your people?” Tony replied, equally as irate. “Every time I say something, you just take it like an insult. You don’t try to defend your people, prove me wrong; you keep giving up, and I never thought the son of Athena would act like that.”
Tony’s research gave more results, and his team of scientists and engineers were able to harness the energy coming from his bigger in scale arc reactors. Steve listened to him with a bright smile as he rambled, saying how their city would have more trustworthy and clean energy than it ever did before. Criminals were brought in justice by Steve every day, and Steve was enjoying what he did once again; using his abilities to ensure that his beloved country was safe once more. Everything seemed to have been fixed, all but one thing that needed to be taken care of.
“And you need to understand that what we could find in the South could be more beneficial for all of us, your old man would agree-”
“What? No.. I mean.. maybe? I don’t know if it counts as a confession, I guess I can..”, Tony mumbled, mostly thinking out to himself. He was a man of logic and yet, at that very moment, he was ready to do something so spontaneous, surprising himself.
“But what about your father?” Steve whispered. “Will he not dislike this? You said you follow your father’s will.”
Steve was in his room doing sit ups when he’d heard the small beeping of the communication card go off, and with a heavy sigh, got to his feet and walked over to the desk to stare at the small flashing card. The bright cyan arrows were lit up along with the words ‘communication from Iron Man’. It wasn’t flashing red, which was a good sign at least that meant that it wasn’t urgent. He picked up the card, along with grabbing a bottle of water with his other hand from the table, popping off the cap using his teeth and guzzling the water down as he held the card up, tilting it and squinting to read it. The communication was a text one, which was a change for Tony considering he loved being so vocal.
“Don’t force me to hurt you, Stane!”, Steve yelled at the large monstrous man as he rolled at side and threw his shield on his back, hearing the man growling in pain.
Steve looked at him and then at the flowers, nodding thankfully and stepped inside the cemetery, walking along the graves with heavy heart. He recognised some of the names he passed by; men that fought by his side, kids who brought in smoked and magazines, and he couldn’t help but feel guilty; what if he was the reason why they were buried right here, six feet under? What if,because of him, he deprived some wife’s husband, or a child’s father? With heavy heart, he reached a corner of the graveyard and stood in front of the marbled tombstone. Peggy’s name was written on it, along with the date of her death, which upon further inspection, it was quite recent as well.
Steve could feel his stomach tied in knots, an ominous feeling taking over him; whatever was hiding under that blanket, it sure wasn't good. Taking a deep breath, he lifted the sheets, eyes widening in shock and disbelief.
“Yeah, I really enjoyed the jokes and everything,” he nodded, making his way out of the theatre with Steve walking alongside him. “It’s a shame we don’t have this back home."
Steve nodded, letting out a couple of short breaths. “S-shall I..?” he stuttered, sitting up a little.
He got ready, slipping on his gun holsters over his dark blue shirt and brown trousers, taking one of the bags with him. Steve soon joined him with the heavier things and guns, all concealed for now, looking like a proper tourist in his hat.
Steve lifted his body up to Tony’s hands. His knees felt weak but he had to hold himself up, even though he wasn’t quite sure what he was doing, and Tony guided his every move. His shoulders shifted anxiously, the tension moving from one side to another, but the second Tony trailed his lips down his back, the tension slipped away and he dipped his back slightly, fingers grasping the sheets.
Steve shut his eyes again, taking in a deep breath as the night breeze swept by and sent a shudder down his spine as he moved a bit closer to the fire for warmth. “Not just flattery,” he said. “Very beautifully worded flattery.”
Tony hummed at Steve’s reply; he couldn’t be any happier, and he still didn’t know exactly why. Why was this man making his heart flutter with a simple smile or the words he said? But it didn't matter why. Tony didn’t want it to go away, and he held onto Steve tightly, shutting his own eyes and letting Morpheus come to him.
He yawned and stretched, rubbing his eyes as he stepped over to the selection of suits in glass cases, staring at each one of them and trying to remember where he’d seen them and what they did, there were a couple of course that he’d never seen in action at all, but he was sure one day he would.
He took his hand out of his pocket to pinch the bridge of his nose to stop any tears from running down, letting it rest at his sides, eyes widening when he felt a warm hand against his own, fingers holding tightly on him. He didn’t turn to face him at first, part of him so desperately seeking the comfort he needed, but when he did, Tony was standing beside him, looking at the tombstone with a strong look on his face. His bright blue eyes seemed to be focused, and their glimpse was almost magnetising.
Tony nodded in return, shifting to the edge of his seat when the chorus stepped on stage, setting the scene with their song, after which Tony clapped in amusement. He sat back then, and started to pay attention to the different masks and costumes, and the way the characters would mock and criticize their society, finding himself agreeing with most of the jokes and laughing softly to himself.
“The conditions are not so good. There was a heavy snowfall so there’s a high chance of avalanche. So listen to what I say and we’ll get there safely,” said Fleur.
Tony smirked. He had been given a small taste of the omega and wanted more. And he didn't think he could ever get enough. Maybe he could convince Steve to make their arrangement more permanent.  Steve didn’t understand how difficult it was for someone to keep his interest. He grew so bored with people quickly, especially in any truly intimate sense.
He stayed with her until she was sound asleep. The wall of the cell sunk into the ground allowing him through when he was ready to leave.
They force their way through the crowd, and toward the hotel. Tony unlocked the door to their room. Steve sat on the bed.
Rumlow didn't give a shit about an apology, he wanted submission. "It was your own fault. Why should I apologize?"
"I'm sorry I know it's uncomfortable, but its an important part of an annual exam. I’ll be as quick as possible. Please put on the gown,” she said.
Steve smiled. Thor was the person who may have more trouble understanding the references of today than him.
A mixture of guilt, relief, and insecurity played across Steve’s expression. He raised Steve’s chin. His heart wrenched when a tear slid down Steve’s cheek. He kissed his love.
Piper's eyes widen, stunned to see Theodore smiling. It lit up his expression, melting away the frigidness. As suddenly as it appeared, it was gone. She wanted it back. It looked so right for him, but she doubted she would ever see it again.
He closed the distance between, wrapping his arms around Tony. Their chest firmly pressed together. His face hidden in his alpha’s neck. Sighing as Tony’s hands ran circles down his back.
Steve smiled and started purring. He was a bit surprised when Piper started sucking her thumb. It hadn’t been a habit before. It seemed to be calming her down. Once they finished Frozen, Sing was next. Steve paused Sing when he noticed both pups were asleep. Jarvis turned off the TV. Steve picked up Piper.
“Has Coulson asked you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? He’s been trying to build up the nerve to ask you for months,” she said.
When he got back to the lab there was a case on his table. It was the safety box he'd given Steve to put his treasures in. He opened the box everything had been protected. He put it down beside him. Two hours later he had a cure. He made two doses. None of the Extremis soldiers survived for it to be used on them. He gave a vial of amber liquid to Hill.
"Tony, let's just get her out of here." Steve knew they would have to discuss it, but now all he wanted was to enjoy the fact that they had their daughter back. He took off his coat wrapping it around Piper, making sure to cover her face in case she woke up. There was no need for her to see this. They hurried back to the entrance.
When Steve’s maternity leave ended nearly two weeks ago he had expected a flood of requests, but there was nothing. He'd checked in with S.H.I.E.L.D to make sure they were aware of his availability, but nothing happened.
Tony nearly snarled when he caught the scent of another alpha on Steve. He swiftly shook off the momentary lack of control.
Circular robots came out of their hidden slots in the wall and started working on the mess. Tony brushed the glass from his clothes and hair. The smell of gin, brandy, and whiskey clung to his clothes. He showered. Then he went out to the beach. Steve was sitting at the shore. His shield rested beside him. Tony cautiously approached.
“When I went under the world was at war. When I wake up they say we won. They didn’t say what we lost,” Steve said.
Piper grew anxious after a few minutes of sitting there. The scent of stale distress made it impossible to relax. In the end, Piper gave in and took a seat across from Lena, so the whole hour was spent playing chess. The match ended in a draw, and Piper was finally allowed to return to her room. Winter sat, unharmed, in their chair.
Nothing he'd done to her was meant to intentionally harm her. Winter only worked toward her betterment. If it could be considered that. He was teaching her how to fend for herself. She wouldn’t have survived this long otherwise.
“We stay together!” Piper clung to Rune, holding his hand tightly. There was little she could do to mend to promise she’d broken to Winter. She would find him again, no matter how long it took. But Rune was a promise she could keep.
“Piper is located in a transarctic mountain base. There are likely cameras hidden among the mountain range,” said Hill.
“No!” Winter shouted harshly, but he didn’t use his alpha voice. The cards went flying as he retreated to his corner. Piper sat stunned. She gathered the cards and tried again, this time setting up solitary. Theodore crept out from his corner and settled by her side, seemingly fascinated by the movement of the cards.
Zola thought so little of his field of study and the possibilities it possessed. Lena preferred Werner Reinhardt’s work on brainwashing, which posited a far less invasive approach. Unfortunately, Werner had been assigned to the alien object team, so Lena had to make do on her own.
He pushed a small box wrapped in red and white paper toward his husband. Steve carefully unwrapped it. Tony twitched. It was a present it was meant to be ripped open. Finally, he took off the lid.
"I want a blood sample from the child. And I want an MRI of her brain. For that, she'll have to be semi-conscious."
He led her onto the dance floor. Steve was careful of his movements, not wishing to hurt her by treading on her toes.
Piper bit her lip. She liked knowing that she could open and close the door, even though she hadn't built the confidence to exit the room without permission.
"Pepper," said Steve. He'd never been so happy to see her. He wanted to know the plan. It would help him settle down.
“Sorry for surprising you, but I can perform a body scan to see if your birth control is effective," said Jarvis.
Piper flipped through the pages of another textbook. She had already read the thick texts twice, memorizing most of the information and answering the review questions in her head. Winter was staring into space, in off mode, completely still and seemingly unreactive. She ripped a page from the book, throwing the crumpled paper ball at Winter.
A photo montage of the pup was playing. She was smiling in every photo. Winter had seen the pup had smiled before but never like. The ones he’d seemed dull compared to those being displayed. Winter knew as long as she was with them, he’d never see her make that gesture. He had to get her back to a place where she could smile like that again.
He followed after his mate. Thankfully, Tony made the smart decision of not smashing cake in his face. Tony licked the frosting from his fingers. Steve blushed turning away. Well-wishers followed them to the car. Tony sped out of the driveway.
Steve slowly woke, falling back into the pillows. His arm stretched out for his mate. He growled when he discovered Tony wasn’t there. Steve got up from bed and went out into the hall. From there, he heard Tony talking with Rhodes. He went into the kitchen, giving a quick wave to Rhodes before throwing his alpha over his shoulder and grabbing a jar of pickles from the cabinet.
Lena stayed silent but left the door open behind her when she exited their quarters. Piper went to the doorway, watching as the woman walked down the hall away from them, not even looking back.
"I have to make a call," he said. Tony nodded. Steve went out to the deck. A warm breeze hit his face. Natasha first.
An explosion sent Piper flying backward. Flames engulfed the air. Pieces of the ceiling and roof came falling down. Ms. Ann was passed out on the floor, her head bleeding. Piper grabbed her, dragging her toward the window. Piper went back into the flaming wreckage going after the two other children there, leading them to the window.
"It isn't like to be in such a rush. Does have anything to with what may be waiting for you at home?" said Natasha.
"I see no reason to leave. I have everything I need here." He’d been a homebody for the last three weeks. It hadn’t even bothered him.
"I thought Howard would have it reset to you when he died. He probably thought whatever was inside could be useful to you," said Steve.
“I was learning a skill you wanted me to! You’re punishing me for doing what you said!” growled Piper.
Steve leaned into his alpha. Tony was purring. Sirens could be heard in the distance. S.H.I.E.L.D.’s emergency services got there first. Steve pressed further into his mate.
“Alright, I’m going to give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons tie yourself to those chairs and I’ll let you live. In five, four, bang! You should have already been gone,” said Tony.
“Thor, I’m no fan of your brother. He killed innocent people for power. And threw my mate out a skyscraper-
It was more than a simple shock collar. If she ever got out it, would probably activate a tracking system. She didn’t have the tools available to break it off.
The ballroom was beautiful. It was clearly designed by Piper’s grandmother. The large was bathed in natural light that streamed through tall arched windows. Hanging from the arched ceiling was a single elegant crystal chandelier. Drops rainbow reflected light spotted the center of the checkered cream and white floor. The walls were painted a delicate cream. Tucked in the corner of the room was a grand piano.
“Okay,” said Steve. He took a breath. Steve gently pressed on the cool metal edge. The reactor rose slightly. Steve turned slowly turned it.
Steve scowled when a familiar floral scent touched his nose. What was she doing here? His frustration lessened slightly when she hugged them.
Steve easily got to his feet. His gown fell to the floor, leaving him only in his underwear. He put on the blue pants the nurse left behind. There was a sliding door leading onto the balcony. He opened it, Tony followed behind him. It was beautiful they were surrounded by lush forest.
An archer stood in the rafters. The man came down from his perch. He was dressed in black and well built. He had sharp dark blue eyes and brown hair. An alpha. Steve was naturally on guard.
Her mouth watered when she smelled Papa’s stew coming through the vents. She didn’t want to wake either them, so instead she recited all of Jupiter’s moons in her head.
Steve groaned when at the slight dampness in his pants. Tony was instantly looming over him. He moaned at the simple lick of he the alpha's breath against his neck. Steve sunk further into the cushioned seat. Tony closing what little space there was between them.
"A familiar blueprint. It would have been shorter if I weren't so pleasantly distracted." Tony had thought they won't need it was a simple precaution. Never had he felt to urge to mark an omega even in rut. Steve brought out that urge.
He couldn’t wash Tony’s scent from his skin. Steve soaked a washcloth in the sink, cleaning the mess between his legs. He caught his reflection. A shimmering mesh collar silver locked on his neck. It was nothing like the thick leather ones. He was forced to the heat facility. Those left him with blisters and raster along his neck. If he hadn't seen it, he wouldn't have known it was there. He blushed when he remembered how desperate he was for Tony to mark him. It was safest if to keep it on. Purples splotches marked the unprotected skin of his neck. Several bite marks decorated his pales skin. He was proud to wear them. Even though Tony tried to mark him, Steve still had full trust in him.
The gaspy breathy way Steve said his name was almost enough to send him over the edge. Steve’s teeth traced over the tender line his neck, causing him to moan and grind into the omega seated on top of him. He rolled their positions, so the beauty was perfect skin was pressed closely against his. Tony shivered, fisting the carpet as Steve’s hand traveled underneath the waistband of his pants, timidly rubbing him.
“Of course, I’m jealous!! But I know what it will do to you!” Tony took a breath, forcing himself to calm down. Yelling at his mate wasn’t getting him anywhere. “Why does he want to talk to one of us now? He’s been in S.H.I.E.L.D’s custody for days now?”
He was tired of biologists. With Bruce and Edith, he was out of his element, with Steve it was easy. They settled on the couch. Jarvis put on the nature channel. Tony hadn't watched the news for days. He didn't want to be reminded of the portal. It already ate away his nights. Tony got out the nesting couch when it got late. He needed to sleep in an actual bed. His back as killing him from all those nights on the ground.
Steve lurched backward, only to further exacerbate his panicked state by hitting his back against the corner walls.
His voice was shaky with fear and defeat. Tony slowly touched Steve’s face. He whined. The omega shivered with the effort to control his mind. Steve fell backward, clutching his head. He slammed into the wall.
Steve nodded. They pulled up to the tower. He took the bag from the back seat. Steve took a breath before leaving the car. He stared up at the tower. It wasn’t too late to turn back. No, he would regret not talking with Tony. Steve went to the elevator and hit the button for the penthouse floor.
His eyes widened. Not possible. He would have known. Wouldn’t he? It explained why he cared. Was this his pup?
"Okay," he said. Steve quietly left the room. Sliding to the floor when closed the door. He closed his eyes, trying to block the sounds Piper was making. He knew what memories her crying would bring back for Steve.
"We have to tell each other when we see we're a the point. So please trust me when I say if you do this it may lead to a mental break. I don’t want to see our family more hurt than it already is if I can help it," he said.
Clint sat across from the other alpha, playing with his arrows. It was easy for him to imagine what hells Steve and Tony wanted to put the bastard through. He would be thinking along the same lines if anyone touched his children.
Tony caught him in a kiss, his arm locked around Steve’s waist. His armor fell away breaking the boundary between them. He pressed closer to Steve, wanting to get rid of his distress. Their foreheads touched. Their gazes locked. Again they meet in a gentle kiss, which grew in its passion. His hands wandered memorizing the feel of Steve’s form. Steve broke their kiss, baring his neck. Tony brought his nose against it, deeply breathing in his scent. That honey vanilla scent took over his senses. He never wanted to part from it. Tony lapped Steve’s neck savoring the taste and the shivering reaction it caused in his omega.
This had to be the man Rune warned her about. She’d have to stay on guard. His actions alone made him were reason for concern.
Tony took a breath. It was difficult, almost impossible, for him to be the hopeful one. It wasn’t in his character. He was always a realist. Steve was the one capable of lifting a person’s spirit, and even in the most dreadful of situations giving them hope. He kissed Steve hoping it would bring a brief distraction. Steve pulled away.
But a mental tripwire had been already been ignited, setting off a chain reaction. Piper screamed at the top of her lungs, and tackled the beta to ground.
“I’m not even trying,” said Tony. He leaned in closer, causing Steve’s blush to deepen. “Does it just come effortlessly?”
He pushed her head down, forcing her to stare at the ground. Piper bit back a whimper when he started sawing off her hair with the blade. Her eyes started watering. She wouldn’t cry. It was only hair, it would grow back.
“Spread your legs a bit more." His voice heavy with desperation. Steve gradually spread his legs, releasing more of his alluring scent. A scent that beckoned his inner alpha to break free. He forced the urge down. With his free hand, he ran his fingers through the slick running plentifully down Steve’s inner thighs.
"The that would normally go his healing abilities is being diverted to the pup's development. Even so, he'll heal rather quickly," said Dr. Star.
Tony put the plate in front him with three sandwiches. Steve dug in. When he was done Tony gave him a tub of strawberry ice cream. Steve blushed. He took the tub and settled on the couch.
“I don’t know. We have no idea what she had to endure. I doubt she'd answer if we asked. None of us have been the most eager sharers. Steve, are you okay?” said Tony.
Tony went through a list of activities. Half them Steve couldn't do while pregnant. They agreed on the aquarium. As soon as he got there he regretted not bringing his sketchbook. They had it mostly to themselves. His favorite exhibits were the otters and whale shark. He took a seat on a bench, watching the giant fish swim gracefully through the water.
Peter looked mildly put out. He kept glancing at Steve nervously, not because he’d been caught-- It was a long car ride upstate and a majority of nerves related to the initial capture had run their course--Tony bet the anxiety stemmed from the way Steve was drowning everyone else out in his increased brooding energy. It wasn’t at all helped by the scruffy beard. His mouth just drawn down into a frown that could set anyone on edge.
It was Tony’s turn to roll his eyes. “Under everyone’s mask is another and another and another. People can’t stand to see themselves for who they really are Rogers.”
It’s funny how you can never forget a stranger’s footsteps. Especially when they were once called a friend.
“Here’s a joke. Self proclaimed hero responsible for the deaths of hundreds.” Tony rolled back his shoulder to force Steve’s hand to drop away from it. The churning heat in his gut from too many whiskeys mixed with the burning brand of fingertips became overwhelming for him. Tony staggered and had to steady himself against the wall. “Punchline is a bit shaky I know.”
“JARVIS was an older AI that had developed a habit of… Evolving past his protocol. FRIDAY is much more forward. I wouldn’t mention my name to her if you don’t want me hearing about it,” Tony said, laughing when Steve muttered a few choice words for her. The laughter wasn’t immediately followed by self-loathing for once. He was too confused by the way Steve’s face still had a lingering blush.
“Not even breaking a sweat,” Steve said, despite the words, there was a shortness of breath there. Tony rolled his eyes and fired another blast in the second Asgardian’s direction, this one was better prepared, trying to get out of the way and only getting a brush of the blast on his side.
He didn’t wait to see if Steve would comply. Just yanked him back hard enough that their teeth banged together. Years worth of desperation scraping its way to the surface. Tony dug his fingers into Steve’s shoulder to gain leverage. Pushed himself closer so he was just off the floor. Chest to chest with the man that he shouldn’t be touching like this. Touched him more. It was never going to be enough.
“What? No, not at all," he replied quickly. “I just wanted to say, you’re a great teacher." He felt his cheeks flushing at Steve being so intimate without even fully realising.
Steve took a breath carefully; he wasn’t used to others just sitting there as he greeted them but, as Falcon had warned him, Spartans were a different breed entirely. Tony’s dark hair was striking, it made his sapphire eyes stand out and look even more piercing as they seemed to burn through his soul with the stare he was giving Steve.
“And yet I chose you,” Tony smiled. “Of all people, I chose the Athenian, an enemy of my people and my father. And yet I can’t seem to be able to run away from him."
Reed was quiet, taking in every little clue that they might have gotten, even though in typical super villain logic, he was sure that Kang would reveal his oh so great master plan soon enough.
“Hmm... Anyway, thank you”, he smiled, turning his wheelchair around. “I’ll see you later, say hello to Natasha for me”, he told Bucky as he wheeled his chair back to his room.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Ma’am”, Steve nodded, shaking her hand and quickly following her. He was sort of relieved to notice that she didn’t slow down because of him.
“I guess I just wanted his approval.. you know? Sometimes it’s good to know that I’m doing something useful, that I’m not just a burden to him, to my mother.. I always wanted to impress him, one way or another, and no matter how messed up his ideas of how I should be were, I followed them, just to please him. Even when I drank the entire glass he handed to me, it still wasn’t enough.. That’s where you came in”, he said, looking at Steve, relieved to see that he was still listening to his every word. “I know it was Cap, but.. when I would go to my room and read your comics, I felt that someone was actually thinking that I was doing something useful for once. Every time that Cap would raise his thumb and I would read ‘Good job, Soldier!’, I couldn’t help but think that it was directed to me.. and that made me feel special.. I now know that every kid that read the comics thought the same thing but.. it was comforting to me”, he admitted.
The blonde wandered into the large lab, hearing the lights buzz back on as he walked in further, flicking a little before maintaining their bright glow. He didn’t know where to look whenever he walked into Tony’s lab; there was always so much to look at, so much to take in and never once was anything the same as his last visit. If anything remained exactly the same, then there was something wrong with Tony.
“I only came here once, you know.”, Steve broke the silence, his eyes fixed on the tombstone and the flowers around it, refusing to look up. “During the funeral… I couldn't say anything to him when we were left alone…”
Tony hesitated for a moment before letting Steve pull him up and walk with him back in the huge bedroom. He noticed how Steve seemed to be scanning the room; it was the first time that the soldier found himself there, it sure must have made an impression. Laying back on the bed, he instinctively grabbed Steve’s hand when the blond turned away.
Steve took him through them, though it turned out that Tony was better at mathematics than he let on, so he moved from that to literature, showing Tony plays just like he wanted to learn and going through them with meanings and in depth analysis.
“Might as well”, Tony muttered, as he grabbed the missile in the last moment, redirecting it towards the portal.
“I know how you feel,” Tony said, “that’s exactly how I view certain items in my possession.” He stood on his toes to inspect the helmet carefully. “Does that helmet have a story? What are the wings for?”
“I mean it.. it’s fine..”, he said, giving him his usual, strong rub on the shoulder. “You don’t have to worry about me”
“Like I said; I’m Tony Stark, perhaps the surname rings a bell? Howard Stark? Manhattan Project? Worked closely with the government back in your Cap days”
Steve felt the jolt again, but this time he jumped right back on his feet, sending two soldiers who charged at him across the room and on a desk full of monitors.
being with them seemed the right thing to do. Besides, Pepper seemed to be properly happy with Happy (what an surprise, Tony used to think to himself), and Pepper even urged him to find someone suitable to be my Tony Stark’s side.
The bodies of the two demigods lay in the battlefield together as their souls rose together to Mount Olympus, hand in hand, staring down at the cities that they once sought to protect battle for supremacy.
“I can’t vouch for that, you know. If you’re familiar with my title, I’m sure you know what people say about me," Tony said as he noticed the way Steve was looking at his chest.
“Do you wish to touch a star? Well, I’m going to build something, better than Daedalus, and bring the brightest star for you to hold. Then we can place it back to the sky," Tony said with a bright smile, looking over to Steve.
There he was, alone in a brand new apartment, preparing for the the next day, the day that he would get back what belonged to him. He yearned for it, the sound of bullets, the mud between his soles, the feeling that he was helping his country, his old neighbours from across the hall. He was going to get it again, and that overwhelmed him.
“And I mean, I love you as my friend, I really do. My partner, good old Winghead. But maybe deep down there’s something.. more. Something that I may not be able to exactly put in words right now, but I know it’s there. I think I might be in love”, Tony finished, rubbing his carefully trimmed bear at those words that he haven’t uttered in what it seemed ages to him, and he was probably right.
“So, ever since you met me, have I ever stopped disappointing you?” Tony asked carefully, waiting for Steve’s reply.  “Should I give up hope?”
“Well, you better believe it, Stark”, Steve said with a chuckle. “Those pictures sure sugar coated a good number of things.. but that’s what people wanted to see, right? So they gave it to them”, he added as he saw his shield being thrown at some HYDRA soldiers behind a shut door.
“I was in the middle of something very important…”, Tony muttered, not remembering how long it had been since he stepped outside that lab room. Calling his Steve a lab rat before seemed so much harsher now that he had been on the other side of the insult.
But it still didn't feel right; Steve knew that keeping Tony there would only hurt him more when it would be time for him to go. He wasn't a replacement, not in the slightest, but it sure was a good way to try and accept Tony’s death and move on, especially since he could actually talk to Tony and hear his opinion in so many things. Next thing he knew, Tony would develop Stockholm Syndrome, and that was something that Steve wanted to avoid; he wasn't going to keep Tony there against his will more than he deemed necessary, but they didn't seem to get nowhere. Kang was nowhere to be found, they didn't receive another message from him nor they've witnessed another sudden appearance of Tony from yet another universe, which was good news. However, Tony was separated from his friends and family, his team was out there looking for him and they couldn't contact them in case that would have more consequences.
Steve just stared at him leaving, confused by the sight. The circle device which looked planted on Tony’s chest seemed so out of this Earth, like a part of a machine that didn’t belong on the human body. The blue light it was emitting was also alarming and it sure cause Steve to just stand on spot, wondering what was even that and why Tony possessed it. His earlier words about him needing a bodyguard made him think that Tony was indeed valuable, in a way other than being the CEO of his company; maybe he was unique in the kind of way Steve was; one of a kind. He didn’t doubt that, a man with light coming out of his chest seemed out of place even in this strange future he found himself in. Confronting him about it wasn’t a solution, the genius ran out and clearly didn’t want to explain anything to him.
He chuckled, and my God, was that the chuckle of an angel, if angels even did laugh like that. It certainly was contagious though, and managed to give him a bit more courage, leaning closer and pushing Tony’s hair away from his forehead.
“And are you prepared to return to Athens with part of you missing, Athenian?” Tony hissed as he approached carefully.
“Do you want it as well?” Tony asked a smile curving one corner of his mouth. “I mean, me coming with you?”
Tony examined him; was he breaking down in front of him? Was he about to do so? He wasn't sure, but something told him that Steve needed to hear him.
“I understand him, you know.”, Tony spoke calmly. “Why he did this… you couldn't handle the thought that you of all people was done with him… that he lost your trust, that he was dead and gone in your eyes, that he betrayed you. He was strong, you know, I know he was. But every man reaches a breaking point and I'm confident that you were his…”, he said as he knelt down to face the tombstone properly. “He felt that he disappointed you, over and over again… He’s probably at ease now… knowing that he sacrificed his life for a good cause and restored himself in your eyes.”
“Is this not... Private?” he managed, trying to speak quickly. “My mother ensures that the baths I take are for me alone.”
Steve nodded to him to show that he was thankful, but the words weren’t reassuring in the slightest, if one thing, they made him feel even worse. He kept quiet until the helicopter was clear for landing on the pad on the top of the tall tower, Tony sighing in relief once he stepped outside.
“You’re lying to me again, Richards! Just for once in your life, be honest! Tony died because of all this dishonesty and distrust, and now this happens? And you refuse to just spill out the truth?!”, he shouted. He couldn't be calm any more, not when the body of his friend that he buried not even a week ago was laying there in the same room as him, along with a man responsible for his death just as much as he was.
The large blonde wolf wrapped his arms around him, chin perching on Tony’s shoulder as the man picked up his tablet. It was just like the times where they would relax, Steve coming in after his work out and cuddling Tony from behind as he would check whatever was going on around the world, Avenger emergencies, company business. Tony scratched him as he continued to read; this could become a routine but on the other hand, he also wanted his human boyfriend back for many reasons.
As soon as he was suited, he flew outside, giving orders at Steve, letting aside their argument for the sake of saving the Helicarrier, equally needing each other’s cooperation.
A faint pink blush painted Steve’s cheeks. He just got complimented by an attractive man who just happened to be a fairy as well. A real fairy. Well, that was a memory he would be unable to forget even if he wanted to.
“Yeah, of course, like always they thought I don’t speak French and I pretty much showed them all. I really put up a good show”, Tony giggled, holding the door open for them.
“And because, you’re my friend,” Steve said. “You’ve let me into your home, given me a shelter, let me share your bed and given me companionship. You listen to me, Tony. As long as it's taken, you understand why I want to protect my people now.”
“Stark!”, Steve yelled, his head resting on Tony’s chest, but he couldn’t hear anything. His fingers ran across the reactor, looking at Tony with a worried, guilty look on his face. All of the sudden, he felt angry, upset. “
“Stay away…!”, Tony insisted, curling his legs up to his chest. “Don’t come any closer, I’m warning you..!”
Steve’s eyes widened as he felt Tony push deep inside, and then Tony was filling him, some dripping down his thighs as his own release followed. He collapsed on the bed with a loud thump, panting heavily. Never before had he been in such pleasure and he lay there with his knuckles bright red from how tightly he had clutched the sheets. His palms were red too, along with most of his body, his pale, delicate skin covered by patches of heat and sweat as he closed his eyes in satisfaction. He didn’t want Tony to pull out. In fact, he loved the feeling; it made him feel complete.
“It seems so. There seemed to be reports of gems attached on the gauntlet. According to legends and various stories from around the world, the ‘Infinity Stones’ granted the wearer of the Gauntlet all kinds of different powers.Time manipulation was one of them, can you imagine, being able to control time and space? Anyway, they’re probably precious stones, which explains the different colours..”
“And you are welcome in Athens when you suffer from illnesses because of your ‘bravery;’ our doctors are quite experienced,” Steve said with a smug smile.
It was then when Thor and Natasha rushed inside too, adding their own opinions on the matter, Natasha mainly warning them about Bruce, and him not taking it too well.
“Oh? How so?”, Tony asked curiously, doing the same to Steve, playing with the wings that were hanging from his cowl.
“Yes,” Steve answered. “But it’s because I enjoy your company now. I don’t know you enough and I want to get to know you.”
“I don’t want to be alone either," Tony agreed, thinking for a couple of moments. “Do you want me to come with you? Do you trust me enough to let me inside your city walls?”
Tony took a moment to look at him, stroking Steve’s cheek gently. “Don’t be scared. I’ll take care of everything,” he said with a soft whisper, lowering his hand again to start rubbing slowly, watching Steve’s reaction, leaning forward to press a number of kisses to Steve's skin when he noticed Steve's shoulders move.
“If you want to pay back a debt you can send gold, goats, anything that you deem appropriate, but being intimate with me isn’t repaying that,” Tony said. “Is that why you’re staying? To save your people, after I told you that I’m going to do it anyway? Your teaching is more than enough; consider this my being a human.”
“Good morning”, he said as he sat down next to him. “I see you helped yourself with the coffee”, he pointed out.
He smiled, got inside his car and Bruce joined him, all parting ways but knowing that this wouldn’t last long. One way or another, they would end up together again. Because the world needed them to.
It had been almost a month now since Tony Stark disappeared from the face of Earth. Rhodey and Pepper called on the Avengers for help; with S.H.I.E.L.D disbanded, they didn't know who else to contact. They both tried their hardest to figure out what happened, but it was almost like Tony really just… vaporised, just ceased existing. No signs of struggle anywhere that he may had been, no notes, no indication on where he could be.
“Deep breathes, you are barely making any sense...”, Steve stopped him before leading him to the main living room area and sitting him down on the couch. “Start from the beginning, what’s going on...?”
“I’m not sure.. we’ll have to wait and see”, Tony said, even though he didn’t dare to mention that Steve was going to be the centre of the conversation, most likely.
“The perks of being considered a God amongst mortals?” Tony huffed as they set off. The journey would take them quite a while.
Taking a deep breath, he tried to leave everything just like he found them, heading outside and quickly into his bedroom, dropping on the bed and muttering something, his brain still trying to process everything, but seemed impossible, especially after his emotional visit to that mysterious tribute room dedicated entirely to him.
“So Pepper was into this as well? I’m having a talk with the two of you once we’re back..”, Tony replied as he inspected the other man, making sure that he was all right. “So what, are you coming with us now? Because we’re actually ready to head up to the North any moment now”
“Oh..wow..it’s hard to open my mouth”, he struggled to speak, swallowing down as soon as Steve brought the cup to his lips, letting him have a sip of the most chocolatey hot chocolate he ever tasted. His eyes widened to express his feelings towards it. “That’s..that’s definitely a fitting Christmas Eve hot chocolate - is this what you did today?”
He found himself being quite silent, nodding and smiling as Bucky talked about his first meeting with Natasha and how they got together.
“That’s Colonel James Rhodes, but we all call him Rhodey. By all, I mean I do. He’s a friend, we go a while back, ever since college”, Tony explained as he noticed how Steve’s eyes seemed to be fixed on the tent’s entrance. “He’s a good friend, he won’t let anyone know, if that’s what you’re worrying about.. as for the rest of the crew.. well, I’ll have to come up with something more than rely on their code of honour to keep quiet about the discovery. Ideally, I would have found you all by myself, but this didn’t happen so..”, he trailed off. “Come on, we’ll get the first chopper back, what do you say?”
“Let’s not focus on me, shall we?”, Tony said, but the look on Steve’s face of pure interest did make him sigh. “I know that you knew my father, but the man you met and I’ve lived with was different. I know that maybe I can’t convince you otherwise, but there’s no point of bringing him up if you’re going to deflect what I might say”
Tony was still thinking of that moment, of that kiss waiting to happen but never did. “Y-yeah..but look at you! You’re flying!”, he exclaimed after he got back to his senses, not staring at Steve’s pectorals peeking through the wet white shirt.
Just like Tony said, it was slowly getting brighter outside until the low winter sun had risen and illuminated the room with its light.
Steve knocked his knuckles lightly on the door frame as he walked in to give Tony a quick heads up. James kept walking down the hall to check on another VIP down the way, his men following him. Dugan came in beside Steve.
“Ah, I see,” he answered. “I don’t drink but thank you for the invitation.” He looked back up, curious as to how James and Clint met but he didn’t want to ask because it felt rude. “Thanks for thinking I was of drinking age though. Usually people think I’m a lot younger than I am.”
She eyed him. “There are lines we don’t cross even in this business. Bakuto has crossed them all and then some.” She sipped her tea again and then Li Qiang re-entered, coming over to set down the documents and leave. She pushed the folder towards James. “We have a saying in Mandarin:
Putting cheese on each portion he added the finishing touch, set a plate down in front of each one of them, and poured those who wanted one a glass of red wine.
“He didn’t say a word. Came in, said you’d been shot and that you were at the hospital. Pet, he didn’t even say what happened.”
“Oh, of course. Allow me to take you to her,” the man said, turning and making his way for the stairs. He led them down a hall and then upstairs to the next level where the jewelry was kept.
An hour later, Sarah came home from a day out with her friends at the salon and she searched for someone in the big house. It was quiet. The dishes in the kitchen were still there. At least, one plate was. Everything else was neat and tidy as it should be and she figured the only person in this house so bold as to leave a plate out was her son.
he had made a solemn promise to James not to unlock those front doors for anyone but Natalia and then after she had arrived he could start letting in customers. Seeing as he had fought his incredibly protective and loving guy on literally every other safety measure he wanted to put in place, Clint thought it was only fair that he at least do this.
“You know... you don’t have to put up that front with me,” he said and placed a hand on top of the book. “You just found your match in stubbornness and hot-headedness.”
Even though his wrist was still giving him a hard time Tony would not ask Pepper for help again. And then the phone finally rang and Howard didn’t make it to the phone before Tony did. Dugan placed their usual order and after a moment of silence Dugan told Tony to make his personal favorite. As per usual he didn’t care to wait for an actual reply and hung up on Tony. His personal favorite?
While Steve asked Benni to tell his big brother about all the things Natalia had taught him, Tony rested against him once again. He didn’t feel particularly hungry, but exhausted. Before he could do anything about it, he drifted off.
Steve loved this soft version of Tony who pressed his face against Steve’s chest and mumbled happily. “Like a baby,” he answered with a chuckle. Steve remembered kissing Tony and of course the whole night but as soon as his head hit the pillow, he was out until now.
“Tony,” he said, putting a hand on his shoulder, “you sure you’re tired of doing nothing?” He was only too eager to be given work to do and so Steve told him to get dressed in the suit Sarah got him and meet him in the basement. Sarah and Tony headed upstairs to get him dressed.
“You have no right to tell me what a hero is.” Steve said, brushing himself off and glaring back at Tony.
Tony chuckled softly, giving him a brief kiss. “Well, what do you think of it?” Tony asked, raising one eyebrow. “Could it be a sign? If you want to see all this in real life, you only need ask."
“Well, you have now proudly disproved, those myths and you know that my cooking skills are apparently some of the best around Greece," Tony said with a chuckle.
“The guys back at the training camp, it stuck, only my girl calls me James nowadays. She’s dropping by later, you should meet her.”
“Belongs to: Anthony Edward Stark”, he read out loud and shook his head, placing the toy back on its shield, picking up one of the comics. Mint condition, he couldn’t even comprehend how much those would cost now. His chest felt heavy as he read more about the adventures of Captain America and Bucky, his trusty sidekick, remembering how the teenager would protest whenever he would see how the tapes portrayed him.
“You know..you see a few things over your life that make you reevaluate what you’ve been doing, what you’ve been offering to the world. With the weapons I was developing, I was doing more harm than good.. Sure, I could keep our country safe, but what about rebuilding what’s been broken, what about offering people second chances? I had a second chance offered to me, I wanted to do the same to others...”
“You come back from whenever you were for a whole month and starting talking about leading and organising the Avengers?”
Tony chuckled at his comment. “Why are you so sure of that? I’ve seen how women look at you; clearly they value you a lot. And elegant is one of the countless compliments that you receive, I’m sure.”
And for that moment, Tony didn’t wish for anything else, just to be there, in Steve’s arms, which felt perfect, almost like it was meant to be. Now, he didn’t believe in those tales about fate and destiny, but he could be a real romantic when he least expected it. Some people just had this talent; to make Tony fall for them and just let him be his self around them; from what it seemed, Steve was one of them, if not the one. Yeah, positive, cute thinking, which was exactly what he was used to. Tony snorted at his thoughts and gave Steve a confident smile.
He was slowly starting to fall asleep, thinking of quite a few things, mostly wanting to go back and visit his mother’s grave at some point, wanting her to see the brand new Sheriff star on his chest. He smiled at the thought; she was always encouraging him to fight for the greater good, and there he was, clearing up the towns from criminals and all kinds of smug faces.
That was until Steve decided that he had to leave for a while; the Captain and Natasha were still affected by the fall of SHIELD and the Winter Soldier’s sudden reappearance. They didn’t talk much, but Tony knew that Steve was planning to leave, going after Bucky and trying to get him to remember who he was. Of course he offered to tag along, but Steve was right; he couldn’t leave the base of operations, and with the two of them being the co-leaders of the Avengers, at least one of them needed to stay in charge while the other was away.
Tony focused on kissing Steve’s back, his free hand resting just above Steve’s entrance and approaching it slowly, not wanting to scare Steve.
Happy’s smile seemed genuine, and Steve nodded to him before they made their way downstairs and into the car.
“That’s what you get for not sleeping on the plane when I told you to do so”, he said with an faint eyebrow raise, already changed into a casual band t-shirt and jeans. “Wash up, we’re getting lunch, I’m starving”
“I left it back in the temple,” Steve said. “I saw no reason to carry it with me. I would usually, but after previous occurrences... I thought otherwise, as punishment.”
Tony watched the man as he left and sighed; it was always the same. He always questioned why the Athenians kept coming when they knew his reply; still, Steve’s words made him doubt himself and the teaching he grew up with for a couple of moments. Returning to his private chambers, he did not allow anyone to bother him, not even Rhodey. He needed to collect his thoughts, but it only made him doubt all that he had been taught.
Tony’s own fingers moved lower, too, his hands sliding down onto Steve’s waist to hold him in place as his tongue moved lower, licking the base of Steve's neck, looking up to Steve for his reaction a moment later.
He said his final goodbyes when the funeral crowd was disbanded. Standing in front of the grave, with Tony’s name carved on the marbled stone, he was at loss of words. How many times had he been in that situation? He hated it, he absolutely despised it, after so long, he found it impossible to say anything more to the loved ones that disappeared from his life. Even after all this, Tony was still someone very important to him. That’s why he was so upset, disappointed, scared. Right now, he didn't even know how to feel. Fists clenching, his lowered his head.
He sounded confident, he had to, but it was true; he felt like an outsider, but learning more about the relationship between and Steve and Tony in that universe he was just convinced that the two of them just… belonged together in a strange, not explainable way. They had such history together and more ties to link them than he could ever possibly imagine. He would love to see them together, he would love to meet his counterpart but in this messed up situation that he found himself tangled in, he was the survivor.
him, how much he started to mean to him, how scary was to imagine a day away from him. Pepper was right, being in love was terrifying and hurtful.
“I've met the Avengers there… speaking of the Avengers… I'm speeding up the work on the Tower, the top floor can be our… headquarters. Also, we’ll need a battle cry… how about Avengers Assemble?”
The journey was long, and the snow storm didn’t make it easier either; the wind was blowing into their faces and they had to stop more than once to repair some of the vehicles.
“Yes… you’re the only survivor… do you understand why we want you here…? Safe? They all seem to have passed whatever portal is sending them to my universe dead… so there is a huge chance that sending you home before settling this will… kill you.”, Steve said as he gently helped him up, his most caring side rushing to show once he saw Tony being so shaken and distressed, just like he expected.
Steve tried not to think of his head being split open; he signed up for this, whatever it was, there was no turning back.
The only way to fight fire was with fire it seemed, and the fact that Tony seemed so confrontational seemed to trigger a battle defence in Steve’s attitude. Tony watched him carefully, circling him as he spoke, both insulted and intrigued by the Athenian’s guts and desire to oppose him, not used to people back-talking to him; after all, he was the son of Ares himself, the god of war, not just any of the other gods. He had power and honour, and a blood lust worthy of a thousand Athenians.
And he didn’t remember a thing. Fixing his brain took so much time and effort, and when he did find out what he did during that cursed war, he couldn’t help but wonder why the hell he got the person he mostly cared about killed. That bond seemed non repairable, but somehow they managed to do it. It took some time to fix that broken trust, but that smile and hug were honest. But the true question was whenever Tony could actually confess or not. Would he risk it? Just like he did every time in his past, like when he trusted Bethany and Rumiko and it ended up with him getting hurt and blood on his hands? Steve’s blood was already there, despite him being alive and smiling like always to him when they met. They even started going out, just the two of them. Tony wasn’t sure if those classified as dates, but he enjoyed them. He even liked it when Steve started letting him get closer, his cheek almost against the man’s chest, the beating of his heart audible. And when the lights went off, the reactor’s light emerging from the billionaire’s chest lit up Steve’s calm face, who would smile down to him and say that it was time to go to bed.
“We have come to correct you, to save you from yourself,” The large voice of the blonde man boomed, and then he gestured over to the brown haired archer, tugging him by the ear. “Or correct the mistake of this foolish demi god.”
“You’re my equal, Athenian. I would not bully you, you would be treated with respect,” he replied, his voice stern. “And if anyone tries anything...well, they’d have to deal with me. If you ever wish to come you’ll be an honourable guest and have full Spartan rights during your stay. And what if I ever decide to visit Athens?”
The chance was finally given when they escorted Thor and Loki, both heading back to Asgard, taking back what belonged to them. They were all dressed in normal attire, away from the uniform formality. They agreed to part ways for now, but promised to stay in touch and come together when they were needed to.
He was trained well and soon enough he became more useful, even tracking down bandits and bringing them in, glad that he was doing his job well. His reputation preceded him and after the Marshall retired he took his place, clearing up the smallest towns.
Tony stared at his hands when Steve grabbed the scrolls away, not really wanting to show how that discouraged him. After all, he was trying to show a different side of himself now that he was away from his people. They expected him to be bloodthirsty, all day, every day, and that was probably the impression that Steve got of him. But it wasn't one he wanted to project now. “No, stay here if you want, I’m going now," he said quickly. “You were here first.”
“Of course I have a name!”, the fairy replied all offended and Steve noticed that his wings fluttered faster; oh no, his pouting was actually kind of cute. “I’m Tony”
Even though he admired love from afar, he never had the chance to experience it. He was forbidden to.
Tony smirked, a victorious smirk. Steve was starting to warm up on him, or at least he chose to believe that.
“You should know better, right? Being a veteran and all.. my boss is perfect for putting up a show, always has been. So I would advise you to think twice before believing everything that you may read in the papers.”
“I’m sorry that I doubted you. Should have figured out that were was no way that you would be behind this..”
When Steve spread his legs, Tony bit on his lip, seeing how he was more open to him, giving himself so willingly, just like he did every night, fulfilling every deepest and darkest desire of Steve’s. Now it was his turn to have that privilege, and with another swift movement, he pushed inside a second finger, his eyes narrowing as he pushed Steve to moan more, even louder.
Tony looked up to him, keeping his hand in place as he watched Steve’s flushed cheeks, smiling at him faintly. “Don’t tell me that you never did this before?” he asked, one eyebrow raised. “On your own?”
“Watch your mouth, soldier. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. You’ll sit down and let Reed here run the tests. Then we’ll figure out what happened and how he can prevent more… of you… ending up here. Cooperate and you’ll return home soon, all right?”
When he came back, he carried pieces of wood, and he set them down and worked at them until orange flames jumped up, lighting his contented smile.
“So you and her..?”, Steve asked, pointing at Tony and then at the closed doors. “I’m sure she’ll warm up to you”
“And as son of a goddess, the son of Athena, do you refuse to help when others ask for your assistance? When you say that you will help them no matter what?” he finally said, not wanting to say those things out loud even as he spoke them. “You know, maybe you are right. Maybe I should go back to abusing my power and be feared. If the Gods can’t save me, nobody can, and I’m all right with that.”
Tony opened his eyes, blinking a couple of times, adjusting to the light. He looked up to Steve and smiled lazily, hugging him closer. “First day of teaching, huh?” he asked.
Tony picked up his pace, encouraged by Steve’s moans and soft groans, focused on pleasuring Steve. He gritted his teeth at every thrust, unable to form any other sentences than Steve’s name, and he felt Steve push himself aback against him, enjoying this more now that he was used to it. “Do this for me," Tony said as he leaned forward, whispering against Steve’s ear.
His eyes fell on the monitor on the desk with the keyboard sitting by it. Staring at it, he took a deep breath and sat down on the chair, looking at the black screen.
“Alluring?” Tony said in a low voice, shivering when he felt Steve’s fingers on him, pushing himself closer.  “You know, I would give credit to the stunning Athenian in front of me as well. You are simply beautiful."
He was woken up by the sound of the street outside; he didn’t open the window just before he went to sleep, but there it was, wide open. His back was turned, so he didn’t see the man who was standing behind him, frozen in place by the night table with his hand going for the napkin resting on top of it.
“That’s now what I meant but… I feel that you do.”, the engineer continued. “You and him… you've got a long history, I can see that… and I can say for sure that… he did feel the same way…”
“Oh, it was very pleasant indeed.” Steve said, closing his eyes as he lifted the fabric of his tunic over his mouth to hide his smile.
Steve was the man who gave orders, not took them. Though his eyes couldn’t help but catch the sharp, strong line of Tony’s jaw along with the gentle shine that covered his face from the sweat and heat from the suit. Everything was perfect about him, his perfectly cut goatee and bright sapphire eyes that were glowing from the light emitted by the reactor. He’d fallen for Tony Stark; after all, Iron Man was his second love. Steve clenched his teeth even harder together, growling at Tony’s command. But the more he looked at him the more he wanted to move, he pounded his body against the metal suit, the loud knocking of his dog tags against the metal suit echoing in the large laboratory. He was trying to swallow down his moans but he couldn’t, he moaned even louder the more he admired Tony’s sharp features and how he seemed to want to dominate him, finally seeing the possessiveness in his eyes that he had yearned for, secretly.
“So, you’re still alive, huh? And here I was getting excited that you were gone”, a familiar voice was heard in the distance.
Tony shouting seemed to be pointless, Steve knew how to perfectly work his jet boots by now and started hovering in midair before adjusting his posture and jetting off to the distance. His heart started beating faster; what if he fell, what if something happened to him if he ended up there safely? He suddenly remembered the failsafe; of course the scientists had a way to stop Steve if they wanted to, there was no way they could fight against him, and the only way to stop him was to take away the gift they gave to him. He had to hurry up, there was no time to spare, the jet boots could get Steve there faster than his fastest car in his garage.
Tony raised his hands, looking to Steve first, unsure if he could have permission to touch or even attempt to draw anything with something that he valued so much. “And they belong to you? How well can you draw?”
Steve rubbed the warm water over his skin and over the well sculpted muscles, much bigger than a normal Athenian's. It was partly why he took it upon himself to hide his body with his large tunic. “Let’s hope not,” he said.
The nightmares happened way earlier in the night than other times. Tony sat up quickly, looking over Steve, who was shaking more visibly than any other time. Drops of sweat were rolling down his forehead, his light gray shirt already stained. He was holding tightly on the bed sheets, his teeth gritting together. What scared Tony the most though, were the screams. They occurred so often, and it felt like Steve was actually calling for help.
Yet, he was still up there. The huge wave that was released pushed him back, falling down the void. The call to Pepper failed, and taking one last look at the alien ship being destroyed, he closed his brown eyes, dignified and ready to face the end.
“Some..names, mainly”, Steve said, not sure if he was able to talk about that, but at that very moment, the only person he spent enough time with to build some level of ‘trust’ was oddly this man sitting opposite him. “Friends.. I want to see if any of them are..alive”, he said, straightening his back.
The voice surely made Reed uncomfortable, but Steve narrowed his eyes, approaching with caution. He recognised that voice, but he couldn't remember where he heard it before, and the video was too dark, most likely on purpose.
“And you managed to do that,” Tony said, looking around for the thing he would need to gather for their journey and his stay in Athens. “Perhaps we can practise at some point, teach other some tricks."
“Yes, I’m grateful, they really are...they feel amazing, they are more than I could ever wish for”, he nodded. “I’m looking forward to today, Tony said that he will show me what else they can do”
Despite Tony's words and demands to stop the attack, the Spartan king and leader of Greece’s finest army decided to march on war, sending Tony deeper into his pit of aggression and regret. He'd promised Steve that he would protect his people and beautiful city, and yet, his own people were preparing for war, walking for days and revising their plan of attack.
The captain let out a long sigh, taking a moment to bury his face into his palms before maintaining his posture.
“As a child, I was very sick and my mother is the one who pulled my soul from the river Styx, before it had met its end,” Steve said. “Before the fates could sever my thread entirely, she saved me. So I am in her eternal debt, as her son.”
Steve's felt dizzy, his mind felt uncoordinated, and he let his hand slide down Tony’s neck and across his shoulders. “I... I’m unsure...” he murmured as he hunched his shoulders a little, his meekness returning without Tony's mouth for distraction.
Steve led the horses back to Sparta, through the long journey under the already dark sky, his hair flying back as they moved with speed. Occasionally, he glanced over his shoulder at Tony, giving him that warm comforting smile to reassure him he was safe as he held on.
“I don’t have to.” Tony said, and then he decided, shifting himself to make himself more comfortable, head rubbing against Steve's skin. “Well, I take it that you like it more this way then. I think I’ll be fine here.”
Tony blinked at his question, not really sure how to reply, or what they'd even agreed to do in the end. “We can try?” he replied.
“I don’t either, it felt...perfect,” he said, “to trust myself in your hands. And you really looked after me.”
He did have a good heart; he just didn’t get to show it much, the Spartan atmosphere requiring him to be tough most of the time. Steve stepped up behind Tony, tilting his head at the spear and patting the man lightly on the shoulder.
Steve shook his head, but Tony was able to spot a smile as he walked past him and into the elevator. Tony kept complaining when they got stuck in the traffic, going on about how faster it would be if he could fly them both in their destinations, but Steve was pleased that the trip was slow, as he could look at everything around them, tall old building, golden decorations and statues, things he only saw in books before. He jumped on his seat as the drove past Moulin Rouge, fascinated by the red windmills as he kept repeating how he always wanted to see them in real life.
“Tony, what are those?”, Steve asked curiously, dragging him along a small bridge right behind the majestic church. He was looking at the bridge’s sides, both covered with different kinds of padlocks.
Steve nodded too. He didn’t know why he felt so sad about it. He had done what he had come to Sparta to do and he should have been happy. But he didn’t want to leave Tony; he liked his company.
The scientists gave each other a victorious look, and it looked more sinister than Steve could even fathom, which made him feel slightly phased.
“No, leave it. It builds character”, Steve replied as he got it properly in his hand, weighing it and swaying it around, satisfied with it. “Thank you, Tony”, he nodded softly.
“Perhaps we both need each other in order to be better people,” Tony nodded, rubbing Steve’s hands. “It feels right to do this, to be with you, nothing else.”
“Real thing? Well, catch your breath and I would like us to try it... I’m ready for it when you are, Captain”, Tony replied with another chuckle. He couldn’t stay mad at him, not when their relationship seemed to have taken another spin for the better, now that he was allowed to take control. “It had to be me, it had to be me to see your face when you would finish”, he said after a small pause, excusing himself.
Loving Steve Rogers could be classified as a Herculean labour. Sometimes Tony thought that fighting an army of Doombots or freeing the city from yet another villain attack was way easier than talking to the man he was in a relationship with.
Steve looked at Tony’s hand for a moment and then shook it firmly, feeling a small spark as they touched, his eyes darting up to Tony’s eyes to see if he felt the same.
“Oh, I know he does”, Tony nodded. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he tried to get rid of me to take over the company, hence the need for a bodyguard”
It did make sense to him to trust Steve. After all, he was just like him, a child of the Gods, having to face so many troubles and problems above his abilities.
Tony found himself looking at Steve’s focused expression more than the writing itself, moving his hand as Steve showed him, creating the same little marks that he did. “It’s not that complicated, is it?” he asked.
Steve shook his head, unsure whether he should trust him or not, he always regretted opening his heart to others, and this was no different.
Tony shook his head, the bolt of thunder answering for him anyway. “The son of Zeus. Yet another son of the all-father," he said, even though he didn’t dare to add a snort to his sentence; threatening the gods was never admirable. “And the Cupid behind you? Who is that?” he said, pointing at the smaller man, wrapping an arm around Steve.
“You lied to me.” Steve simply said, his voice abnormally calm, haunting even. “Avengers world? Us building this world from scratch? Together? While you… you were destroying another world behind my back?”
“I’ll hold you and we’re both going down”, he said in a more serious voice, dangling from the edge as he climbed down next to Steve.
Tony could see he felt alone, isolated, and that he wanted nothing more than for this fight to be over. “Because I’ll tell my people that they are wrong, that there’s room for change,” Tony said. “That attacking your city will only bring further torment to our home. And if you don’t want to be here, take me with you.”
“You might not be considered a threat, but you better stop pretending to be hero, Stark”, he added coldly.
Steve took a better look at him. He was just an inch or two shorted than him, that carefully trimmed, almost to perfection, beard covering part of his face. He was sure that the fairy man noticed the height difference because he immediately fluttered his wings and lifted himself off the ground, looking at Steve with a smug expression plastered on his face.
“I’m sure that you’re just as good with a gun, Mr Stark”, Steve said with an honest nod of his head.
“I am not one of your women,” Steve scowled, placing his hand over his chest protectively. He was still flustered, backing off into the corner by the door.
“There is no point of you venturing into my home. Do not lie to me and wish for their well-being when just days ago you were preaching their destruction.”
Steve kept himself protecting Tony, glaring almost like a lion, with his golden hair framing his face.
“I told you I’m making more than just weapons," Tony nodded, taking it in his hands to show Steve how the front could spin at will. “And, thank you, it means a lot coming from someone like you.”
Tony was beaming as he was standing next to Steve, getting congratulated by journalists, veterans, doctors, families. He needed to do this, this what exactly what he planned when he first decided the program, not create weapons. He wanted to offer soldiers a chance to fight again if they wanted to, but above all, his priority was to give people back their lives.
, he said after a deep breath, carrying on inspecting the ice with his own eyes, the men already starting to dig up the shield. There was something really exciting about seeing his hero in person. Well, he had no idea what his condition would be, but based on simple scientific assumptions, his body would have been probably preserved.
“That’s right. I’ve read about the job in paper, sir, I think that I’m qualified enough for this job.”
He wasn't sure if he was allowed to use the term friendship when Steve seemed to be holding back so much, while Tony was going all out instead. But Steve gave him a look when he used the word friendship.
Steve nodded, his faith restored in the man whom he thought had broken his heart, and he placed an arm around him. “Not once did I regret falling in love with you, Tony.”
“Well, you have me now, so don’t worry about that. Not that I will replace you, guys," he said to the horses as they huffed, getting on the chariot behind Steve to hold onto his waist.
The stranger seemed to be eyeing Steve, almost like he recognised him, which did attract Steve’s interest more. Maybe they did know each other in whatever universe he came from, which would make their communication easier.
“You’re so afraid of letting people close to you, and that’s how I feel as well. Not afraid because you’re a coward but because you really don’t know how to act, what to give to them, what your status allows you to do” Tony insisted. “Try to prove me wrong.”
He could see it now, that faint movement, his little finger twitching; he was coming back to his senses, after what it seemed like a century. Technically, a century did pass, and it was then that Tony realised how shocked the soldier would probably be.
“See you tomorrow, Tony. And thank you. For everything”, he added with a thankful bow of his head, stepping outside. He knew that Happy and Tony stalled so they could make sure that he could walk into the building just fine, and Steve didn’t disappoint them; he felt proud, relieved that he could do such a simple thing on his own.
