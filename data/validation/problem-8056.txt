“Is Tony, is a threat, but you are burying you head in the sand to that, chasing make believe monsters and getting so obsessed over it that you do stupid things that get people hurt. It was behaviour like this that led to you creating Ultron and ruined Iron Man.” He paused and frowned at Tony, as if coming to a new realization, “Is that why you’re building yourself a new team? Because the Avengers know your not fit to be in the field anymore?”
“Mr Stark, that’s so…. Wow, I don’t know what to say, I’m like honoured and I totally think of you as a Father… I mean older brother figure, you’re way to young to be my Father of course, and I’d never think you were old…”
“See how smart she is?” Steve asked, ruffling Tony’s hair as he went past him,
“I know.” Tony whispered, “It’s okay.”
Without even thinking about it both Clint and Natasha broke the limbs they were holding making the Skrull howl in pain.

“Pete, you okay?” Tony called up to him, “Jarvis get the suit in here so I can get him down.”
Chuckling Steve texted to say he was on his way, “Everything alright?” Pepper asked as she came onto the stage.
“Him and me both.” Tony replied, grabbing the menu to look at the desserts on it, “Fuck it, I’m gonna order all the desserts they have, we can share them and get diabetes and tooth cavities together!” He all but bounced the phone and picked it up, “Everyone else choose what you want and I’ll order it up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry Mum.” Clint said,
“Okay, okay, settle down guys, chill.” Tony said holding up one hand, “One at a time please.”
“Indeed, we will need a great deal of fire power in order to take down such a vast army.” Vision said, “From what my data banks recall, Manhattan was nearly destroyed by just a very small portion of Thanos’ army under the command of Loki.”
“I want to make a deal.” He called out stopping the Consultants reprimand,
Once Tony had finished speaking to Jarvis the three of them quickly turned in, while Tony had said there was no issue with him sharing a bed with Steve, both of them were awkward as they actually got into bed together and shut out the light, laying side by side, very conscious of the fact that their shoulders were touching.
“Dude, for Christ sakes that’s my Mom!”
Zach’s tiny body slammed into Killian, his burning hands wrapping around the madmans neck burning into his flesh as Zach poured all of his rage and hatred into his attack.

“If we fit the harness about my hips, thighs, and have an additional support around the waist and back then this should work.”
"Well just because Peter Stark is well again isn't going to stop the investigations. He was still injured and ended up in hospital as the result, you could be sued for psychological trauma as well as for the cost of medical bills, and OSHA are insisting on a full investigation, your own insurance company is insisting on investigations being carried out, they won't pay unless the building and labs pass all safety checks." The PA let out a shriek as Norman threw his coffee cup at the wall, the ceramic mug shattering on impact and hot coffee spilled down the wall.
*****
“Agreed.” Tony said, “And as a further failsafe, I would insist that you only have half of the command codes, and I keep the other half. That way the chances of this weapon ever falling into the wrong hands is reduced.”
The rest of her was no easier to look at. Her figure was naturally in decline, her body no longer able to maintain a decent muscle mass, and her determination not to gain weight had resulted in a far too restrictive diet that made her bones far too prominent beneath too thin, over stretched skin, that had been nipped and tucked over and over to the point that there was no give left in her abused flesh which looked to be in danger of splitting it was so tight. Her breasts were practically comical, sitting as high and firm as a twenty-year-olds and were as round as a couple of grapefruits. They were also on display in the far too low cut dress and the woman kept thrusting them at Steve despite his lack of attention or desire.
“It did, especially since my metabolism has gone insane and I need to eat like five thousand calories a day now.”
“This is the best shit ever!” Deadpool declared.
“Bosses?” Tony had planned to just threated Curien, maybe give him a few more bruises, he had not expected to engage the man in conversation or to be given information so freely.
“Maybe we should go to an ice show at some time.” Natasha suggested.
Sam led Steve and Tony into the spare bedroom, pointing out that the bathroom was just across the hall and said he’d go and put the kettle on and have tea ready for them.
Jolting awake Tony became away of Steve leaning over him, his hands on his shoulders and a worried expression on his face.
Tony blew him a kiss, “Is that threat or a promise, Nicky, Darling?” He threw him a wink for extra measure and Fury snorted, rolling his eye.
Silently he berated himself and his choices which had led to this mess, if only he’d done as his parents asked and left being a hero until he was older than this wouldn’t have happened, no one would know about him and Zach having abilities, they would be safe and not facing having their family torn apart.
“The UN will be made aware of this and implementation across the globe will follow on their go ahead.” Fury said.
“As do I.” Tony hissed back at him, “And after you lose in court how much influence do you think you will still have? And I think you will find that many would be sympathetic to Peter’s cause when they learn that he was simply defending his friend who your Son attacked.”
“Zach, honey. Daddy and I spent my heat together, but we haven’t made babies.”
*****
New York.
Tony whimpered, how was he supposed to get through a day with Steve wearing that and not jump him the first chance he got?
He leaned over Tony’s shoulder trying to understand the code that Tony was typing in, it looked like gibberish to him, just random letters and numbers.
They didn’t have long to wait. The Mad Titan arrived with his army within hours, send hordes of Chitauri across the planet who were tackled by the various heroes and military forces, the Leviathans being targeted by the weapons and destroyed before they made ground fall.
Chuckling appreciatively, Steve adjusted his grip, tightening his hold on Tony and moving them so the Billionaire was beneath him. He could feel Steve’s erection against his thigh, hard and damp with precum, and Hello! Steve was big all over. Tony would bet that there was a good nine or ten solid inches rubbing happily against his thigh and the thought of having that firm flesh buried inside him made his own cock twitch and leak between his and Steve’s stomachs.
“Can we have cake?” Zach asked brightening up at the prospect of a party, “Chocolate cake?”
“Jesus.” Steve spat, “He tortured his own Son.”
“You should talk to her.” Steve said, “And be careful. Natasha, Sam, and Clint should be arriving here soon, I’ll let them know what’s happening.” He paused, “I’d join you but Peter…”
*****
“Fine, thank you for asking,” Tony replied. So what if they were a little odd, Toby did toast things, he just got carried away doing it and burned everything to a crisp, and Micky had a thing against meat, and eggs, and frozen foods! Cathy was alright though, she was always bubbling and huffing steam happily.
“And his spine?” Bruce asked voicing the question that everyone was thinking but not daring to ask.
Tucking his gun away he turned on his heel and headed back for his car as the street behind him erupted into screams for help and calls for an ambulance.
A spoonful of the pink goo and the headphones on and blocking out the noise and Peter’s headache began to subside and his stomach stopped twisting so painfully, allowing him to sit up straight without feeling like he was going to topple over or throw up everywhere.
“Right.” Steve agreed. “I’ll keep that in mind.” He frowned when Peter shivered, the air was cool and now they weren’t running it was a lot more noticeable. “Let’s get the food and get back to the tower.” He said. “Want to race there?”
Of all the places to end up this would have been the last one that Tony expected to find himself.
“Sweetie you can play with us, it’s only for a week and you will see him every meal time.” Steve said attempting to soothe the distressed boy, but Zach was having none of it, squirming out of Steve’s hold and ran to Peter throwing himself around his legs and clinging on as hard as he could.
After that he started going back out onto the streets, short patrols on Wednesday and Sunday nights, and a long patrol on Friday night.
“Hey!” Tony jerked Peter so he was sitting up, his tear streaked and reddened face visible, “Don’t you say that, don’t you ever say that, don’t think it because it isn’t true.” Peter choked and hiccupped, sniffing hard. He flinched when Tony wiped his cheek with his thumbs and looked at his Mother with watery eyes. “I will never regret adopting you Peter.” Tony said, “I love you so much. I don’t care that I didn’t give birth to you, that doesn’t matter, because you are my boy, my Son, just as much as Zach is.”
“Alright?” Steve asked looking at the cut on Tony’s temple. Whatever Tony was going to say in response was cut off as a cry came over his coms.
A pair of sunglasses was similarly created with different levels of tinting in the lenses so Peter’s eyes could adjust.
Steve snorted, well as an adult he might be sick of fast food but the teen in Pete was still loving it no matter how much he was having.
“When will they be back?” Rogers demanded, cutting off Clint’s ramble, which to be fair, could go on for hours. Clint shrugged,
Cautiously he approached the sceptre, unaware of Wanda watching from the shadows or the magic that burned in her hands. With flash of crimson Wanda’s magic invaded Tony’s mind and took him into his nightmares.
“Attack!” Came a yell from above and suddenly a rain of wet toilet paper came crashing down on them.
Surprise flashed through baby blue eyes that was quickly replaced by suspicion, “What, how..?” he looked to Tony, “What is going on?”
“I’m sorry Sir but there is a disturbance in the lobby.” Jarvis apologised.
Only a handful of journalists had been allowed inside the building to cover the event, all specially selected and thoroughly vetted as they would be more inclined to give detailed reports on the event rather than just celebrity gossip.
Paralysed.
They had just reached the part where Ariel was about to sell her voice to the sea witch when there came a knocking on the window.
“And you are now grounded.” Tony declared, he hauled Zach up by his arms and set him on his feet, “And you can help clear this mess up.” A snicker came from over head and Tony glared up at the ceiling, “And don’t think you are getting out of it either Featherhead, get your ass down here and grab a mop and bucket.”
“Maybe.” Peter said. He sat forward and cut to the chase, “But are you guys okay with this?”
Fury snorted and Natasha rolled her eyes. These two should be given white walking sticks if they couldn’t see what was right in front of them, and she would bet the next six months of her salary that neither of them had a clue.
Tony enjoyed settling Peter into his new home, spending time with the beta boy who it turned out was quite the little genius himself, having an aptitude for Maths and Science which Tony planned to expand on, tutoring him himself, to supplement his school work which he was getting via the internet as Tony hadn’t had a chance to get him enrolled in a school in Malibu yet, and Peter was off school right now due to bereavement, they had yet to bury his Uncle and Aunt, something that was going to be painful for the poor child. He’d already lost so much in his short life it just wasn’t fair.
They knew, thank God, at least something was going right. Although…when did the Avengers get back, weren’t they wanted fugitives? Tony shook his head, he didn’t have time to think about that.
Tony was jolted awake by a stinging slap to his backside which made him yelp and sit up disoriented and slightly miffed at being so rudely awoken. He was met by Steve’s grinning face which made his stomach do all sorts of stupid things that it really shouldn’t do, like backflips.
"It seems that young Mr Stark is a very lucky boy." The Doctor said to Tony and Steve as they came back in, "It doesn't appear that he has suffered any lasting damage at all. However I am going to order some more tests just to be on the safe side, so I am afraid you'll be staying with us for a little but longer." he said to Peter who grinned back at him.
Clint grinned, “Lets put that to the test.” He moved to strike the Skrull but Natasha held out her arm, preventing him from advancing further.
“I didn’t.” Tony stammered. “Aunt Peggy and Obie did that. Said it was better that I didn’t see them. Insisted on closed caskets too.” A horrible thought suddenly hit him, “Oh God. They knew, they had to have known.” He staggered to the couch and perched on the edge of the cushions, his body taut and hands clenched into fists. “Obie lying about it I can understand. He was an asshole. He wouldn’t have wanted the Cops pocking around the company, they might have turned up his double dealing sooner. Christ, for all I know he might have been paid off by Hydra to keep his mouth shut, could even have been part of them! But Peggy?” he looked to Rhodey, who had met Margaret Carter a few times. “She couldn’t do that, could she?”
The Avengers will continue to function.” Tony said, “At present I am obviously taking a leave of absence from the field but will be working to rejoin the team as soon as I am able. Until then, Iron Man will be replaced by a fully functioning AI code named Vision, who will be leading the Iron Legion.”
Tony’s snort was weak almost despairing. “How will we be?” He asked, “We have us, and a planet of armies more interested in wiping each other out than defending the human race. We got lucky with the Nuke exploding outside of our atmosphere, if it had blown on earth we’d be looking at radiation poisoning and Nukes are the biggest arsenal we have for defence, a defence that is also a suicide, so if the Chitauri come again the chances are we lose, the entire planet looses with us.”
Happily Zach ran about in the snow seemingly impervious to the biting cold as he set about rolling a ball that grew and grew until it was twice as big as himself! He then called for reinforcements to help get the head put on the snow man because he couldn’t reach that high. Peter helped him to get the head up onto the impressively fat base and made sure it was stable, they then got an old knitted scarf from Bruce to put about the Snowman’s neck and an old beanie from Natasha to put on its head. Steve painted some tennis balls black and cut them in half so they could be used to make the eyes and some buttons down the front of the snow man, he also painted some golf balls to be used to make the mouth. Clint provided a bright orange sock stuffed with silver foil to serve as a nose instead of a carrot, and finally spray painted some scrap metal that he cut down into stick arms which Zach stuck into either side of the snowman completing his body.
Lactation.

“I wonder what other stuff I can do though.” Peter mused. “Super senses, and super strength, what else…”
Tony didn’t seem to bothered by this though, he was snoring softly, one of his arms hanging out of bed and one of his legs outside of the blankets and curled up over the other bunching the blanket between his legs.
“Cool, get the bastard sweating.” Tony said and looked thoughtful, “Maybe I should open my own school. A school for the super smart scientific and engineering geniuses of tomorrow,” His eyes widened, “We could use one of the floors in the Tower, we could offer schooling for our employees children.”
On the other hand. Tony had been in boarding school most of his childhood, he’d been packed off and pretty much abandoned by his parents, Howard being too busy with work and thoroughly disinterested in an Omega Son, while Maria had been too busy drowning in Valium, wine, and vodka.
“It’s called knocking.” Tony said blanking the screen as swiftly as he could and wrapping his dressing gown tighter about himself, “What can I do you for?”
A sharp in take of breath startled both men and to their horror, when they turned and looked they saw Zach standing in the doorway.
Tony met Steve in the hospital corridor and leaped up into his arms, wrapping his legs about his waist and clung onto him like a demented koala bear, attacking his mouth with all the fierceness of an octopus.
“I think so,”
Smashing his way through computer equipment and medical supplies Tony came to a stop before a medical table where a man in a lab coat was holding a scalpel to Peter’s throat.
“Tony!” Steve protested, “Not on the coms.” He was grinning though even as his cheeks flamed., He served to avoid a tank whose occupants Thor was taking care of, Hulk caught the tank like it was a toy car and threw it just as easily roaring with delight and bounded after Steve as he turned sharply heading for the castle with Clint and Natasha hot on his heel, however a barrier blocked the jeep forcing Clint and Natasha to leap out and take their fighting back to the ground, while Steve was able to jump over it and stay on his bike, grinning as Tony sped past him in a blur of crimson and gold.
“How lost you feel when you have no Mother to turn to for guidance and comfort.” Natasha whispered. She did not remember her parents, she had been too young to recall them, but, from what she had observed, how others spoke of their parents, their mothers. How families interacted, how Peter and Zach were with Tony, Natasha could feel that longing for her own Mother, the woman who had given her birth whose face she could not recall.
It would have been the perfect moment had it not been for Justin Hammer whining that Natasha had broken his arm, the sirens screaming, the phone cameras flashing, and Clint Cat calling them. The date that followed two days later had been perfect and hadn’t involved any of those things, (Except Steve refused to have sex on a first date despite Tony being very willing to put out) He didn’t resist on the second date though, and they had been going from strength to strength since then.
“Get back!” The Doctor snarled, “I’m warning you…” The scalpel dug into Peter’s throat drawing a little blood, “I will kill…”
Tiredly, Rhodey, Matt, and Sam all made selections off the menu, while Vision floated around the room, finally asking for a soda water when pressed by Tony, as he liked the way the bubbles fizzed in his mouth. Steve had already eaten and was content to share in the absurd amount of sweets Tony ordered up to the room, and set about trying to make Bucky feel as comfortable as possible. Getting him to take a seat before the TV which Sam and Matt were fighting for control over while Rhodey tried to ignore them and Tony egged them on, urging them to get “Butt naked and start wrestling on the carpet!”
“Yeah, I do.” Tony agreed, “I have a huge ass problem with you sending a no doubt murderous sociopath into my home, near my Son.” He glared at Natasha, “Give me one good reason why shouldn’t call the cops and have you arrested?” he spat at her, “You came into my company on false pretences, that’s corporate espionage, you’ve been in my home doing God knows what, and did you touch him?” He pointed to Zach, his anger growing exponentially, “Did you? I swear if you so much as a lay a fingertip on him I will beat that smug smirk right of your face and have your flayed corpse strung up outside my property.”
*****
“Ah, metaphor, interesting.” Vision glided further into the compound his form between solid and immaterial which would make an attack harder, “I don’t think that there is anyone here.” He said turning around to face Rhodey, then movement from of the corridors caught their attention and they both turned, Rhodey powering up a repulsor just in case.
He gave up alcohol completely, throwing out every drop, cut back on his coffee consumption even though it was like cutting off a limb. He consulted nutritional research to find the best and most nutritious diet he could adopt while pregnant and made a conscious effort to eat properly.
“No details then.”
*****
“You’re getting back in there?” Sam sounded shocked which earned him a risen eyebrow from Tony, “Well, you’re injured, that arm needs to rest, hell, it needs properly setting, you need to go to a hospital. Both of you.” He added looking over at Steve who had finished the pizza and was pouring tea.
Evil bitch!
“Right, okay.” Steve agreed, hoping that he wouldn’t do anything embarrassing in the night, like snuggling against Tony, or god forbid, wouldn’t wake up flush against him with his morning erection pressing against Tony’s thighs, or worse, his backside!
There were times, glimpses of mostly forgotten shadows of memories, like images of dreams, of a time before Hydra, before the ice, before all of this. If the asset concentrated then he would get glimpses of a diverse group of men in old fashioned military uniforms. He’d remember the sound of laughter, of voices, he’d even see filthy streets in some smog filled city where vintage cars rolled down the road and two children played.
Clint grinned, “You get my spectacular chilli for dinner tonight!”.
“Tony!”
"And when I had a similar incident because of the snow, you told me that it wasn't my fault and that I shouldn't blame myself." Steve countered. "You explained about triggers and PTSD and what happened to you and why you are afraid of water. You can't blame yourself for this."
“I am sure you all recall Zach Stark’s abduction two years ago when the terrorist Aldrich Killian was using the Extreamis virus to turn people into bombs. He had Zach abducted to blackmail Tony into stabilizing the virus for him, and as added incentive, he injected Zach Stark with the virus.
“Oh I should think so.” Tony said carrying Zach on his hip easily.
“It won’t be like that.” He said stubbornly, “You’re not forcing me, I want to do this.” That much was true, he did want sex with Steve, very much, at least his brain did, his body might still be another matter.
“It’s a boy!” Clint bellowed out onto the balcony earning a cheer.
“What, you think that stopping assholes from beating up old ladies isn’t cool?” Ned demanded.
Once he’d gotten MJ free of the webbing the two of them walked back through the park at a relaxed pace, speaking with Ned on the phone.
“African American, late middle aged, blind in the left eye.”
“This can’t go on.” He said once Tony had rinsed his mouth and was sipping the water. “You can’t keep having nightmares like this.”
“Yeah I know.” Tony said, “I wouldn’t have said diving here was a good idea if there wasn’t a way back up.”
“A woman, Maya Hansen. She shot me and Peter with something.”
“Can we have marshmallows?” Zach yelled as he played a far to energetic game of tag with Peter.
Rhodey took charge of dealing with the police, since Killian had been a civilian the crimes he’d committed couldn’t fall under military jurisdiction and with the FBI’s involvement due to Zach’s abduction and some of Killian’s crimes having taken place in different states it was going to be a jurisdictional nightmare for the investigating offers involved in sorting out the mess.
“I still say that costume did nothing for your ass.” Tony said, looking at the original Captain America suit that was on a dummy, all shiny material and tights that made Steve cringe, he’d felt like an over-sized sugar-plum fairy in that get up.
“I’ve multiple movies backed up on Netflix and Amazon prime.” Steve said, “Plus playlists of extremely loud noise which our teenage son claims is music.” Steve looked very unconvinced of this, but then he said much the same about Tony’s taste in music.
The landing pad of Stark Tower.
“Perish the thought Sir.”
“Wasting no time are you?” Tony asked
“Well that’s impressive.” Steve said taking a step back and watching with amazement as Peter lifted the bell bar with one hand.
Curien shook his head, “I don’t think they are Hydra, I don’t know, maybe they have connection but Osborn never said anything about Hydra, and I never met anyone who was obviously working for them.”
"You are rigid in your conviction?" Steve asked nipping at Tony's ear.
“I’m sorry Thor.” Steve said, clasping Thor’s shoulder, “I know how it feels to loose your Mother, how the pain strikes in your heart as fierce as a fist that feels as if it would shatter your heart completely.”
“That doesn’t explain why you wanted me to be here.” Steve said. “I’m not computer expert.”
“I am.” Steve said giving a nod.
“I can’t have deep baths or go swimming.”
“Most pleasing.” Thor agreed eagerly shoving more marshmallows on his stick and thrusting them into the flames, a little too enthusiastically since they caught fire!
Hospital.
Tony snorted, “Please, like your skinny little ass could possibly compete with my perfect pair of peaches!”
“Okay.” Peter agreed, it would mean he wouldn’t have go out of his window again, at least not then, but he would likely have to do so plenty of other times. Who knew being a superhero could be so difficult?
“Now that is impressive.” Sam chuckled.
“It’s perfect boys thank you.” Tony said hugging them both and heading back to the common area where a buffet was waiting for him, with pizza and cake!
“I’m really sorry Mamma, I didn’t mean what I said and I promise I’ll never say it again or frighten you again.”
“I don’t know, the doors locked and he’s not answering,” The door rattled and was knocked on again, “Bucky are you alright?” Stark sounded really worried now and the giant Steve was probably about to start kicking down the door. Swallowing hard Bucky forced himself to speak,
Pepper selected him a pair of Ralph Lauren vintage style jeans with a Dolci and Gabbana cotton martini fit shirt in light blue, tucked in at the waist and a Dolci and Gabbana belt slipped on for added style, and to complete the look a Gucci wool blazer in charcoal grey.
“Uh huh, and today we’re gonna go to a space station around Neptune!”
“Mr Stark! OhmyGod, its really you, I am such a huge fan of you and Iron Man, you are like my ultimate hero, you are so super cool!” Spider Man cried, “Is that baby Lily? Oh my God she is so cute, she looks like you! Well that makes sense she is technically your daughter isn’t she? Do you think she’ll grow up to be a superhero? Well how could she not when she’s your daughter? And Captain America! Wow, you’re so big I mean like really big!” he made hand gestures at his shoulders meaning Steve’s impressive musculature. He looked between Steve and Tony and cocked his head, “Are you two like… you know,” Again came the hand gestures and Tony closed his eyes and let out a deep exhale.
“We gonna go see Mamma now?” Zach chirruped bouncing into the lounge, his cheek smeared with jam from his breakfast.
“The boys?”
SI PR deemed it a success and the team enjoyed that brief moment of peace, then they had practical back to back missions as they found Hydra bases they had to go and take care of. Three in the space of one month, and if that was not enough, Dr Doom, or rather Dr Dumbass as Tony insisted on calling him, decided to launch an attack on New York to call out Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four, thus ending the partial anonymity they had enjoyed prior to the exposure.
“So is that a yes?” Steve asked cautiously.
“What the…”
“Ain’t that the breaks.” Clint drawled in amusement, he was holding out his fingers to Espresso, the black kitten was batting at them like they were a toy. Gingerbread, who’d been terrorizing a toy mouse, saw this and bounded up the sofa to join in.
"Thank God you're okay." Tony said to Peter while Steve thanked the Doctor, "We were so worried, we thought...." He broke off and swallowed hard, stroking Peter's hair back from his face, "We were really worried baby."
“Jesus Christ!” Clint cried as he threw open the car door, Natasha right behind him, the two of tearing down the road to where Thor, Rhodey, and Bruce was running towards the base.
Twisting his head as much as he could Peter saw Tony’s face, his head hanging limply inside the cradle of the Iron Man helmet, blood was dripping from a cut on his head and his features were slack.
Tony panted, it was getting hard to breath with all the smoke in the air and his eyes were stinging and watering. He looked down at the ground below the smoking and burning debris and felt the catwalk shifting beneath him, it wasn’t going to stay stable for much longer not with Killian burning it.
“Then lets get packing.”
“I do, Agent Romanoff,” Fury said and for a moment he actually looked sympathetic at Tony, “We ran some blood work on you and something quite unexpected showed up.”
“Have the lights dimmed too Jarvis.” He said to the AI, “Peter’s not handling light too well either.”
Norman scoffed, “It’s clear where the boy get’s his lack of decency from.” He said looking to the school board, “But then, what can be expected from an alcoholic, sexually promiscuous Omega.”
“You sure man?” Sam asked, “That head injury looks nasty,” He squinted at the cut on Steve’s head, “You sure you don’t need the hospital, either of you?” He looked back to Tony, making the effort to keep his eyes on Tony’s face not going any lower, a gesture Tony appreciated.
“Dear God, do you flirt with everyone?” Sam asked.
“Hmm, for dinner, I thought Bruce was cooking up one of his curries…”
A suit appeared at the hospital window and spoke in Jarvis’ voice startling everyone.
Tony hummed contentedly and let his eyes go half lidded, enjoying the relaxed atmosphere, and only paid half attention to the story that Thor had begun to tell Zach and Peter of the times he and the Warriors three had camped out and what they had gotten up to during those times, the epic tales that would be told and the songs sung of past victories.
“We can try.” Steve agreed, not making an promises since they might not be able to do so.
He could go and see Shield Shrink department, but he had little regard for psycho therapy and was avoiding the department like the plague.
“As soon as he is conscious I’ll need to speak to him.” The detective said, “He has information that we need, and a lot of people are very angry with him, hence the attempt on his life I should imagine.” He nodded to the officers on the door, “He’ll have a police guard at all times.”
He wasn’t being any help to Peter either, the poor boy was stoically trying to hold in his tears, trying to stay strong and not demand comfort of his own when Steve knew he shouldn’t have to demand it, he should be receiving it anyway.
Tony screamed on the narrow bed he’d been placed on. He’d been stripped out of the Doctors clothes and another hospital gown had been shoved on him, his wrists had been bound to the bed preventing him from moving and his legs shoved apart so the Doctor, not the one he’d knocked out, a different one, could see the birth canal.
“I’ll be fine.” Tony replied as he turned the car around, “One I get my Son back.”
“Can I wear my Professor clothes?” Peter asked.
Of course it wasn’t all gone even now. The water was dark red from the amount that had come from his hands and his sleeves where he hand immersed them into the water, yet there was still more on his body, still more on his face, his clothes, his throat.
“Yeah but that’s not ten grand!”
He had Zach lay in the centre of his bed in nothing but his nappy, and was checking his palladium levels when Natalie Rushman came into his room.
“You could have saved us, why didn’t you do more?”
Okay, so maybe he did trash the house slightly to make a collider in the basement, and perhaps he shouldn’t have used the old prototype shield to make everything even, but really, Tony didn’t care, all that was fixable and soon a brand new element was created.
“Christ, Jay, unless the tower is on fire, I don’t care.” Tony yelled, closing his eyes and fisting Steve’s hair.
“You want this.” Steve said looking Tony over critically,
Swearing under his breath Howard headed back down to his lab to write up a report on this failure. He’d been sure that this would work, sure he’d gotten the serum right this time. But no, once again he was faced with failure, just as his Son would no doubt prove to be.
They were supplementing Peter’s diet with the take aways since the portions the hospital were giving him were not enough for his enhanced metabolism.
“It’s just a factory man, we’re not Hydra or AIM.” Another worker, one dressed in coveralls said.
This is a request not a demand.
“It wasn’t dubious!” Harley protested.
Tony pressed a kiss to Zach’s head and held him tighter. “He’s gone, Stellina, he can never hurt either of again.”
From behind Tony Wanda smirked relishing in the pain she felt radiating from Tony, she was about to send a fresh wave of magic into him when Pietro appeared at her side.
Men had walked on the moon, there were technological devices on the surface of Mars sending back images and data, other ships had gone far out into space, beyond Neptune. Pluto wasn’t a planet anymore!
“There are no need for restraints.” Tony said, “Sergeant Barnes is willingly going to the station, he has made no aggressive moves towards anyone, he does not need to be cuffed.” The police weren’t happy about this, but after some more arguing they agreed and Bucky found himself being led to a car and shown into the back seat with Tony climbing in besides him.
“I’d like a Daddy, Mamma. I never had one, him died before I was borned.”
Panting Tony stared at Bruce, “What?”
“Uh, Hi Pep, want Breakfast, Steve made loads. Steve, Thor, Bruce, this is the evil Queen of Stark Industries and my soon to be murderer, say high to the nice lady with her murder shoes.”
“Yep, and even my very own sexy lap dancers dressed in nurses uniforms to keep me entertained.”
“Let’s see.” Bruce said making his way over and kneeling down besides Zach to look at what he was pointing at, “Oh, no, that’s a Gibbula Cineraria.” Bruce said, “A sea snail, and look, there’s some Whelks, see the conical shells?”
“Certainly, this is the Hartwell Fertility clinic. Mr Stark need’s to come in for an additional blood test and scan of his ovaries to ensure that his treatment is not causing any negative effects on his body.”
Steve gave them both a tired smile, “I’ll work on something.” He said meeting Tony’s gaze and rolling his eyes in exasperated fondness.
Peter fired his web slinger at the ceiling and climbed up the webbing, spreading himself out above the door and stayed very still.
A week later, Steve stood in the common room waiting for Tony, he was wearing a pair of jeans that Natasha had picked out for him, along with a crisp white button shirt that was tucked into the waist band of his jeans, showing his trim waist, and a new suit jacket in grey/blue, with his hair styled and gelled into place by Natasha and a musky cologne scenting his skin, he was as ready for the date as he would ever be.
“This isn’t over Stark,” Rogers called after him, “You can’t just turn your back!”
From Hungary he was on foot. He had a little money on him and was able to purchase some food, which he consumed on the go. He didn’t dare use public transport. It was always too crowded and there was too much surveillance.
Tony appeared to think on it, "Golden shower?"
“Holy fuck!” Tony gripped Steve’s shoulders tightly and shamelessly moaned as lightning bolts of pleasure ran through him. “Fuck me that’s fucking perfect, I can fucking feel that, I can feel all of that!”
Steve winced as he heard a door slam and knew that it had been Tony who’d slammed it, “Wade, could you possibly consider not behaving in such a… you like way?”
“No.” Ross said, “What I am saying is, Pride comes before a fall. An old adage but a true one. Tony Stark is a very prideful man an arrogant man, and look at what has happened.”
“You could have kept your hands out of Steve’s pants though.” Pepper said watching as film Tony slipped his hand down the front of Steve’s jeans, causing the soldier to turn scarlet and yelp in a very unmanly pitch.
“Fine!” Tony said getting out of the car, “But just know this Rogers, if I am gutted by a guy with hook for a hand then I blame you entirely.”
“I need to call home too.” Tony said, “See how the boys are doing, and how Jarvis is getting on.” His nose wrinkled, “If I’ve been labelled as a terror suspect Pepper is going to be getting a lot more flack off the media, which she is so going to take out on me.”
“I understand Jarvis.” He said as the lift reached the lab, slower than normal, giving Jarvis time to explain. “Thank you for alerting me to this.”
"What?" another asked,
Peter sighed, and wondered if he could somehow talk Natasha into slipping a tranquilizer to Ned, it might be the only way to keep him from begging Tony for a ride.
“Congrats man, I didn’t know you’d become a Father. But hey, if they grow that quick them you must have super sperm!”
“No you dork, I mean really Likes you.” Peter said rolling his eyes at Steve, “You should ask him out.”
“So you’ve been shopping?” He asked frowning at the box.
“Don’t even think about it.” Rhodey warned Natasha, his gauntlets trained on her. The Black Widow regarded him dispassionately. Though if you looked closely you could see the gears turning in her head as she thought the best way for her to get out of this.
“I know.” Peter slumped, “I feel like shit for it, I just…, I felt angry and I couldn’t stop from mouthing off. I don’t know why. Do you think it’s because of the mutation?”
One thing he was not, was grown up enough to not enjoy blowing things up when given the opportunity.
He was relieved when he got to put his shirt back on, hiding the arc reactor from view along with his scars, Steve had gone quiet again as he collected up used cotton balls and put them into the bin.
“Stuff your mouth, brat.” The Billionaire growled.
Winter had never had sweets before and adored the taste of pastry, cakes, and cookies, getting positively gleeful at the taste of chocolate!
Tony narrowed his eyes, “You are manipulating your way with science.”
“Well that’s settled then.” The Principal said happily, he extended his hand which Tony shook as did Steve.
“The fuckers fast!”
“Oh, no, well, I guess, but I can’t exactly do that when I’m not seeing anyone. It takes two to make a baby, and being a single parent doesn’t leave much time for dating.” Not that Tony was interested in dating, he’d not thought about it at all since Obie’s death, firstly because he was pregnant and still recovering from Afghanistan, then he had a baby to take care of, the palladium poisoning to deal with, then Peter came along, and the last couple of years had just flown by; Tony had been completely consumed by caring for two children, purchasing land to build the tower, getting the tower built, moving to the tower, and then all the shit with Loki had happened, sex had really been the last thing on his mind.
“I’ll make sure it is.”
“About that.” Pepper sighed, “We are going to have to tell them about this at some point, we can’t keep fobbing them off with serious but stable.”
******
It was so unfair that people only focused on the weapons and not the rest of it.
“Excellent.” Pierce replied, “Now keep an eye on Fury. The Asset can deal with Stark and Rogers.”
“Just let it out sweetheart.” Steve soothed, rubbing Tony’s back and rocking him back and forth, “It’s okay, I’m not going anywhere, I’m right here, and I won’t be leaving you alone.”
Rhodey would soon have to head back to work, the military wouldn’t grant him leave for much longer and Tony would never allow Rhodey to risk his career.
“Lithium dioxide.” Fury said, “It’ll take the edge of the symptoms, help you get back to work. Help you fix this.”
“Fiend, thou shalt not prevail this day!” Thor bellowed flying towards Doom knocking bots out of the way so he could strike at Doom. The Dictator flew back blasting energy beams at him, Thor roared gleefully casting off the blows with Mjolnir, taking out Bots and advancing on Doom. He brought Mjolnir down upon the dictator as Doom fired at him, the energy bounced off Mjolnir in a high arch shooting out across the sky and hitting the Arc reactor powering the Iron Man armour.
“Is she alright, did they hurt her?”
The cold air in the lab made the infant whimper, he began to wriggle and his face creased as began to cry in distress.
“Gets is from her Dad.” Steve said looking proud at Lily despite the fact the word was not really the best one.
“You can have a few chocolate chips in your porridge.” Steve offered as took the saucepan off the stove.
“So Ned said that after news spread of me being suspended, MJ marched right into the Principals office and demanded to go on record. I’m not sure if they have a record, but she wanted to go on it, giving her side of the story and wouldn’t leave until the Principal had it all down in writing and had another two teachers sign the statement and print copies of it so her testimony couldn’t be destroyed.” Peter explained, panting as he jogged beside Steve.
“Vanquished our foes?” Tony murmured, “Is he for real?”
Steve sighed heavily. “Both of them are very sensitive and thoughtful boys, who put themselves out for the good of others. Peter decided to use his abilities to help others, that was what he wanted to do, he could have chosen to use those abilities for the wrong reasons, to hurt people, to commit crimes, but he didn’t, he chose to stop muggings, drugs deals, and assaults. He was helping people, saving people, but he didn’t realize the danger he was placing himself in, as children often don’t, as such rationality comes with age and experience.”
“For me too.” Steve murmured, waiting for Tony to relax, but as he said those words a horrible thought came into Tony’s mind.
Gathering what little strength he had, Tony made to shove past Rogers, planning to go and lock himself into a bathroom stall until he’d calmed down enough to show his face again, but as usual, Roger’s wasn’t letting him walk away, grabbed him by the arm and spun him around, his fingers gripping painfully tight to Tony’s bicep,
“Can we Mamma, can we please!!!!”
*****
“Come with me and you won’t get hurt.” Maya said, not relishing the thought of frightening him further.
Kissing was easy, they both fell into effortlessly, their bodies leaning against each-other, Steve moving to half lay over Tony his hands running up and down Tony’s sides while Tony ran his through Steve’s soft hair and down his back.
“No and they are in the city with Sam and Clint.” Steve said grinning as Tony dramatically groaned,
“Shit situation.” Steve mused.
“Easy now baby, just breathe with me, slowly now, in and out, in and out,” He soothed Tony, “Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it and then slowly release it counting back from ten. We’ll do it together okay? Ready now, deep breath in,” He sucked in a deep breath and held it for a second and then began to exhale, counting as he did.
“Sorry.” Tony mouthed to Peter. He typed out a message on his tablet and held it up to Peter.
Unable to think of what else to do, Steve got to his feet and rounded his desk, placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder to try and comfort him or something, but the touch sent Tony into even more of a panic, having him throw himself across the office, slamming painfully into a filing cabinet and pushing himself against it so hard that it seemed like he wanted to force his body inside the furniture.
Doctor Curien laughed, “I’m not interested in information boy, I am interested in you, your physiology, your anatomy, how you came to be….this.” He gestured to Peter’s thigh, “Clearly you have accelerated healing, and by your crawling around the ceiling I would say agility and speed too, what else can you do?”
“Coffee,” Tony said, pouring himself a large cup full and choking on it when his name was screeched, “Of fuck me I’m dead.”
“There are too many civilians around.” Natasha noted keeping herself turned to the side and observing the agents out the corner of her eyes, “We can’t risk this becoming a gun battle.”
Tony could resist leering at the Alpha Female, “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
“We lived so we could punish them.” Winter grunted, “We lived to make them pay, the ones who hurt us, and made us hurt others.”
“Uh, honey, no, don’t use that word, that’s a bad word.” Steve said, staring at far too innocent eyes and a big gummy smile,
“I regret I have lost contact with Sir.” Jarvis replied, the AI sounded worried which sent a jolt of fear through Steve.
Steve remained in the waiting room until Thor got back with a very sleepy Zach who had thoroughly exhausted himself.
Tony and Steve exchanged amused glances and the Captain went to have his own shower before joining the family on the bed for Dr Who and cookies.
“It’s about a grand per person.” Tony said, “Not including the drink.”
“I want to go with you.” Peter said suddenly surging forward and throwing himself into Tony’s arms, “I wanna stay with you and Zach.”
“I’ll say one thing for your hike, its worked in getting him tired out.” Tony said with a chuckle as he sat down besides Steve before the fire and rested his head against his chest.
Tony made a face, “That is a terrifying thought, considering the fact he’s had children!” he sighed, “His wife’s asked me to find him something to do to get him out from under her feet all day.”
“Thanks for the protective stance in there.” Tony said as they got in. “I don’t think I could have fought off all of them without the suit, even if those guys aren’t Hydra they are all creepy as fuck.”
“No, but I think Stark will if he gets anymore insults.” Clint laughed, he patted Zach on the shoulder, “Come on, lets get this cleaned up and then why don’t we see if we can shoot auntie Nat with your Nerf Gun?”
“So long as it doesn’t disrupt the hospital fine.” The consultant said. He looked down at the pale, pitiful figure of Curien in the hospital bed, “He hardly looks capable of committing such acts.”
Tony was broken out of his staring when this new Steve looked up at him, his face creased with worry, “She’s hungry, I don’t have any food for her,”
In the distance sirens could be heard screaming, police, ambulance, and fire department vehicles were rushing to the scene and not a moment too soon as Natasha and two of the workers uncovered a woman who was barely clinging to life. She was badly burned and had crush injuries to her lower body, needed immediate medical treatment if she was to survive.
“What?” Tony looked at her in confusion, “I don’t… months ago, I haven’t gone into heat in nearly a year. I’m going into heat-secession.”
He had already undergone a laser ablation surgery on his fallopian tubes to clear away the scar tissue. He’d told a white lie, or a big fat lie, and said he was going to a series of meetings in Malibu, where in reality he’d spent a few days in a clinic getting the treatment.
They all paused for lunch and Steve amazed Tony by the fact he’d already caught one fish while he had killed and to keep it fresh had placed it in shallow water to gut later.
Natasha and Clint looked uncomfortable, their own history was deeply shrouded in secrecy and Clint had very good reasons not to reveal much about himself, Thor however had no such qualms and soon began to speak of his own history, how he’d always been the favoured Son, how Loki’s true parentage had been hidden from him, how much that had tormented his younger brother and what had led him to acting against Asgard and Thor. How Thor had come to Earth the first time, met Jane, learned humility, something he was still learning.
“Wheres your locker and what’s the pin to your phone?”
“The LGBTQA community has been very vocal since the press conference,” Pepper said, “We are getting a lot of positive press as the result, and with the pride parade not too far away, there has been a suggestion that SI host an LGBTQA gala for the occasion.”
“Sorry about this.” Steve said, although he didn’t sound overly sorry but that might had something to do with the fact that he was cradling Tony’s thighs which were very pleasant to hold onto. He didn’t have long to appreciate it though as more bullets were fired and suddenly there was a car screeching to a halt in front of them forcing Natasha and Steve to stop running or run right into the car.
“It can’t be true.” Tony said, shaking his head, “I’ve never shot myself up with anything like that, or been shot up with anything like that.”
It had taken Steve, and Vision over three hours to dig his body out. Reed hadn’t been able to help them, he’d been sobbing over Sue’s broken body. Steve had carried Tony’s body from the devastated remains of Long Island. Carrying him, with Vision following silently, and Reed carrying Sue’s body.
Moments later Tony was presented with an arm extension grabber in hot rod red and gold with a shiny bow on it.
“Jarvis sent me your coordinates.” Rhodey said, “I just saw an airship heading off, should we be following that?”
“Jarvis, suit now!”
“Umm honey?”
“What does that mean?” he demanded.
“And technically you are dead.” The boy said, “S’all over the news, your house and shit…”
The base was eerily silent as Vision and Rhodey arrived and stepped through the doors. Both were on their guard, expecting an attack to come, most likely from Wanda who was the most trigger happy so to speak, Rogers and Romanoff knew to hold back and wait for an advantage before firing where Wanda just ploughed in.
The coffee he drank, grimacing at the terrible taste, the food he ignored, focusing on the clock across the room and watched at the minute hand ticked away.
“Baby…” Steve said covering Tony’s hand with his own,
Steve grit his teeth and sighed heavily, clearly fighting losing his temper, “Look, I get that you don’t like me, fine, I don’t care, but we have to put this aside..” He broke off as Tony spoke.
“He needs medical attention.” Steve replied, “He has some superficial burns, possibly a concussion, and a broken arm.”
“Let her in, Fri,” Tony said. Blowing a raspberry at Lily who squealed in delight, curious at the miniature human, the Bots milled around, chirping at her, and tilting their claws as they watched their Father playing with a tiny human.
“Dude, if you go there you’re gonna cause WWIII in like ten seconds flat.” Peter snorted, he sat down on the sofa, “Do you think Mr Stark would mind if we ordered snacks, I’m really hungry, like starving hungry. Like I might faint if I don’t eat soon hungry.”
He felt pathetic for bawling his eyes out over an argument with Steve, like a cliché over emotional Omega who fell apart after every row with their Alpha, who always turned on the waterworks when voices were raised.
“I think given the circumstances they just might.”
“I’m sorry.” Peter said, his eyes filling with tears, “I didn’t mean to cause so much trouble, I don’t want to be trouble for you, but I keep messing up and I don’t know how to stop.” Tears began to spill down his cheeks as he spoke, “It’s like my brain just stops working, like my body does stuff before I can catch up with myself and everything gets screwed up and I don’t know what to do and I’m scared I’m turning evil, that the spider bite is making me evil!” He broke off into sobs that had Tony pulling him into a hug.
“Can you stand?” Steve asked, turning Tony’s face and scowling at his bloody lip,
“Uh, I’m not an Avenger.” Peter said blushing scarlet, “I’m um, in training I guess.”
Tony groaned in dismay when Zach jumped on him and began to yell in his ear, Steve chuckled at the little boys excitement.
As Tony took to the air Rhodey joined him and between them they rained down repulsor blasts on Killian until he was face down on the ground as Zach had stepped away giving them the chance to go in low and finish him. They continued firing until there was nothing but charred piles of smoking flash and bone left which Natasha took pleasure in kicking into the wind.
Zach was upset, he didn’t understand why Peter had gotten so mad and didn’t like that he’d be separated from his brother for a week. When it was time for Peter to go back to his room after dinner, Zach began to throw a tantrum, crying and demanding that Peter stay with and play with him.
When the three awoke they were all in what looked to be a cellar, their wrists bound to metal frames while a few thugs looked on.
“Don’t you even think about leaving me.” Tony ordered him, his voice tight as he held Steve’s hand, “You had the nerve to get under my skin, to come into my life and turn it all upside down and make me feel things for you, you don’t get to do that and just fucking die on me, you hear me Rogers?
Since becoming enhanced Peter’s appetite had shot through the roof. He’d initially lost weight as he had struggled to eat enough to maintain his body weight now his metabolism was running so much faster.
With the success of the Christmas cake under their belts the team began to bake other goodies, mice pies, sugar cookies, and yule log. The efforts ranged from inedible to possibly a criminal offence against cooking, haphazard, singed, and finally something presentable and edible.
“Easier said.” Sam said unable to keep from glancing at the camera, he was also sitting rather stiffly and looked very self-conscious. Natasha looked a step away from stabbing the film crew!
Steve wasn’t sure what he had said to that, he doubted it had been very polite, as he had bolted for the garage, taking his bike and driving for New York and Stark Tower.
Steve was taking another bite of cookie and actually bit his lip he was so startled by this.
Peter ran across the what looked to be a lorry loading bay and fired his webbing at the roof, looping it around a flood light, using the webbing he climbed up to the roof and ran over to the nearest skylight, there was too much dust and too many cobwebs on the glass for him to see down into the room below but he could see lights on down there.
“Are you guys joining us?” MJ asked, as politely as possible, She was a teenager and parents sticking around for a sleepover/movie marathon was not cool.
“God forgive me, I’m sorry Buck.” Steve choked out, wrapping his arms about Tony’s neck he kicked down onto Bucky’s face, kicking him repeatedly until the soldier let go and Tony was able to get them away.
Tony nodded and looked across to the other bank, “Wanna race?” He asked, “Breast stroke only.”
“Two minutes,” Rhodey replied, “Are we targeting aliens or the ship?”
“Hi, Rhodey.” Peter said, while Zach yelled out “Platypus!” around a mouthful of pancake.
******
“That does not provide many areas on earth.” Vision said, “The Arctic perhaps..”
“I think we have to ask ourselves, is it right that someone who actively invites attacks upon themselves and their property by posing as a “Superhero” and taking the law into their own hands, had two impressionable and vulnerable minors in his care?
“I think we should head back to the villa.” Bruce said, “Tony could do with a lay down, and I don’t know about the rest of you, but I think I’ve had my fill of this part of the island today.”
“Got away.” The asset said, “I need maintenance so I can complete the mission.” He’d be punished for his failure, but not until after the mission was completely, they would want him to finish that first before they chastised him and put him back on ice.
Tony had died trying to shield civilians from a falling building, that Thanos’ forces had destroyed. With his armour badly compromised from battle, it didn’t stand up to the force of the falling rubble and Tony was crushed beneath the debris.
“Okay Tony bear down.” Bruce instructed.
"Why doesn't your pretend Mamma have us over to Stark Towers?" Flash jeered at Peter, as they entered the lobby of Oscorp Towers.
“You, young man are in a lot of trouble.” Steve said, “What were you thinking, running off like that?”
“Tony baby, open your eyes now, come on sweetheart I need you to open your eyes.”
“Stark, can you hear us?” Natasha shouted, she flinched when a deafening bellow erupted from across the car park and suddenly Hulk was slamming down besides them and tearing into the debris, the giant rage monster paused only once and gave another earth shaking roar which had the workers gathered by Thor and Sam swiftly moving to join in the digging.
Lifting his head Tony nodded and began to tell Steve what he’d seen.
“Mamma come wit’us.” Zach whined as he scrambled into the chair at the table and swung his legs resting his chin on his hands.
“Not even close.”
Constipation.
Natasha opened her mouth to reply to that, but Roger’s cut her off, “We’re not here for that. We’re here for Bucky.”
“But?”
“Is there anything you don’t want to talk about or are not comfortable speaking of?” The host asked.
The guy made another gagging noise as Peter moved him to the edge of the bed and suddenly a wave of black vomit that stank to high heaven poured out of the poor man’s mouth, splattering over Peter’s outfit. The guy fell froward off the bed and began to violently convulse, more and more of the black fluid oozing out of his mouth as he writhed on the floor.
“Jay, access the news feeds, look for violent crimes or road traffic accidents, hell anything where people have been injured in Washington in the past three hours.”
“I don’t, why do you think he gets away with everything?” Tony said gesturing to the devastation in the house. Presently Bruce came out of his self induced isolation and snorted at the mess.
“He’s right.” Wanda said, before Natasha could protest, “Stark hurts everyone, he’ll do the same to Bucky.” She paused and added, “Maybe even make the Winter Soldier work for him.”
Steve determinedly convinced himself that he could get through a snowball fight with the team and kids and that he would have a good time doing it. Painting a smile on his face the next day as they headed out to Central Park.
“No, the Penguins and Polar Bears might get hurt!” Tony protested and laughed at the look of genuine confused astonishment that Vision gave him, “Arctic is not a great choice, human beings a freezing conditions don’t go well together, not even super humans.” Vision hummed in agreement at this and frowned,
"We have sheer slopes to ascend, smooth faced and prone to tremors that may throw us off as we attempt to climb higher." Steve's teasing fingers walked up Tony's thighs and onto the cleft of his buttocks. "We then face the peril of the twin peaks, the smooth globe like planes which we must cross, before we can venture into the depths of the dark crevice where lays the heart of the enemy territory."
Steve nodded grimly hoping that they would have that ability soon.
“It’s okay, you were asleep,” Tony reassuringly said, he made to move and regretted it as his erection thumped into Steve, the larger Man blinking in surprise and suddenly becoming aware of his own erection rubbing against Tony’s thigh.
“Do you think the Avengers should speak out?” Steve asked looking to Tony,
“I don’t know.” Steve admitted shaking his head as he sat back down besides Tony, his face creased with concern as he stared at the Omega’s bruised throat, he could see finger shaped bruising there, his best friends fingers had nearly crushed his Omega’s throat.
“Good point.” Tony agreed turning back to Lily who was frowning at her feet and trying to reach for them, “Its all still so simple for you, isn’t it, little miss?” He asked, “The biggest concern you have is learning a new word and being able to grab your feet, isn’t it?” Lily grinned at Tony and let out a giggle, “Yeah, and pretty soon you’ll be learning to crawl and we’ll be running after you, trying to keep you out of trouble, and then you’ll be walking and we’ll be breaking our necks to try and keep you safe, by which time you’ll be talking and saying everything we really don’t want you to say and getting into so much trouble that we’ll be going grey and probably bald from worrying about you so much. Because that is what happens to people with kids you know?” Tony nodded to Lily who giggled at his serious face, “Having kids makes them grey and bald, but you don’t care about that do you? All you care about is having fun,” He lifted her up so she was over his head and made whoosing noises as if she was flying, making Lily squeal in delight. “Which is just how it should be.”
Steve frowned, “What do you mean?” He asked, and Tony sighed,
Steve wrinkled his nose, “No, I don’t want that. But I want to do something, to get my opinions out there; if these assholes can say stuff like this, then I have the right answer them back.”
“As tall as Steef?” Zach asked.
“Yeah, we don’t want Morgan learning bad words.” Steve agreed in a shaky voice.
Tony glared in Clint’s direction and saw the smirking bastard taking photos on his phone.
Gritting his teeth he continued on, wincing for the pain in his arm, he needed to see a Doctor, needed to get this treated or he risked infection. He hoped the damage wasn’t too bad, but at least it wasn’t is dominant arm and he could get an apprentice to work under his tutelage.
*****
Clint grinned unrepentantly and began to cackle at Steve’s flushed cheeks while Tony glared, “I hate you Barton.”
“I’ve been busy,” Tony ground out,
“Okay when do we set this up?” Peter texted.
“Robbie!” A harried voice called from down the path,
“Then you know why I have to be with him.” Tony said looking at the pair, Bruce sighed and ran a hand through his hair.
“Scan all possibly security feeds, hack road traffic cameras if you have to, Jay, just find her. We need to have a conversation.” Tony said.
A frown flitted over Tony brow and then he scowled, “Jarvis you tattle tale!” He yelled, “I’m gonna ground you Mister, and now you’ve got a physical body I can make that grounding literal!”
He hated lying to his parents, hated that he was so bad at lying that Steve had seen through his act of being perfectly fine and had come to speak to him about it. Peter had been lucky that Steve had just figured it was to do with his enhancements, which, technically was true. But that just made his guilt all the worse, because Steve trusted him enough to never suspect that Peter would be hiding something so big from him and Tony.
“I’m kind of a solo act, but in the event of like an invasion, then I’d be happy to help. I mean I can’t be a friendly neighbourhood spiderman if there’s no neighbourhood can I?”
“How old is he?” The woman asked running her fingers through the Toddlers curls.
Normally when Zach awoke at barely dawn Jarvis would distract him with word games, Dr Who episodes, and Peter, who also awoke earlier than Tony.
“Watch your mouth.” Steve growled at the man, “Or you’ll lose a few other body parts.”
Zach hummed and frowned as he thought hard. “I’ll eat yucky greens.” He offered, “And help pack not just get in the boxes.”
Fury shrugged, “I don’t fancy their chances against Agent Romanoff, do you?”
“Well, there doesn’t seem to be any point in my staying here, the Avengers are gone, what use is The Falcon on his own?”
Bruce smiled. Peter really was the best of kids, many who’d suffered what he had would have become sullen and aggressive, turning their backs on the world which had caused them so much pain. Peter however was friendly and kind, a very well adjusted child which was remarkable considering what he’d been through.
“Fuck that shit.” Tony snarled, “I’m Iron Man.” He launched himself at Thanos locking himself around the Titans back, blasting them off the ground and them slamming them back down. He beat Thanos into the earth once, twice, three times, before Thanos seized hold of him by his right foot, dragging him forward and slammed him down into the ground on his back, then up and over his shoulder and back again.
Once the bath was ready Steve carefully placed Tony into the tub and then climbed in after him, laying down in the water and smiling as Tony came to lay over his chest.
“Hey I resent that!” Deadpool cried, rounding on Tony, who gave him an unimpressed look, “I am an equal opportunities guy, I am a switch all the way, I can crack the whip and I take it up the crack just as well!”
The tour proved to be just as boring as Peter had thought it would be, the tech and everything way behind anything his Mamma had, the only thing different were the lab animals that Tony didn't have. This was wear disaster struck as the spiders that had been exposed to gamma radiation had gotten free of their tank while the class were present. Amid the screaming and panicking Peter got pushed over as frightened kids ran for the nearest exit, he was just scrambling back to his feet when he felt something on his ankle, without even thinking about it he tried to shake it off only to yelp in pain as something sharp sank into his flesh.
“Stark.” An accented man suggested.
******
Not the race of blue eyed blondes that Hitler had wanted, but a race of humans that were not burdened with diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, cancer, sickle cell, lupus, Huntingtons, MN, MS, and so many other illnesses. A race where learning difficulties and behavioural difficulties were not just managed but eradicated, no more dyslexia, or ADHD, no more mental health and the side effects that came from the treatments.
“No, of course not.” Steve said having to clear his throat, “And, um, is there anything I can do?” He asked, “We need to contact Natasha and Fury don’t we?”
The next thing Tony knew, some kind of projectile was whizzing past him and he found himself face to face with a young but rather undersized and skinny Alpha.
“Fire Cracker!” The host chuckled, “I assume it will be a long while before Fire Cracker joins you in the field though.”
Once everyone was done eating they set off in different directions to carry out their activities, making plans to convene back at their make-shift camp late afternoon for ice creams and a came of beach ball.
“Is she your daughter?” he asked, curiously,
Tony, Steve, Rhodey, Vision, Sam, and Clint all testified. Matt and Peter both had secret identities to maintain so they could not testify, and no one wanted Deadpool on the stand for obvious reasons.
The Skrull laughed and morphed into Tony again, Clint loosened his hold for a second then punched the Skrull in the stomach, “Answer me!”
Bucky’s metal fist hit Cull in the gut, then the face, and he emptied his mk5 into the creature managing to puncture it’s flesh creating a wide wound that leaked a black blood. Cull roared, backhanding Bucky across the field, he slammed into a couple of chitauri as he went, grabbing the neck of one and snapping it, he wrestled with the others, getting one of their staff weapons and stabbing the other then shooting the first.
This led to questions about how the team was coping with one of the their own having suffered a permanent injury and how Tony’s boys were coping.
“Dude, gross much.” Harley made gagging noises and batted Tony’s hand away when he ruffled his hair.
“Promise me you’ll be careful.” Steve breathed into the phone and Tony knew just by the sound of  his voice that Steve wished he was going to meet them too, that staying away was killing him. But Peter needed one of them to be at his side and right now that one had to be Steve.
The party was going to be held at a miniature bowling ally with pizza and ice cream after. A Post Script note from Cal’s parents asked for any dietary requirements like gluten and lactose free to be given to them in advance so they could alert the diner before the party and ensure that the needs would be catered for.
“Company?”
“It’s okay, we’re all okay.” Tony assured him, rubbing Zach’s back, “Daddy is alright now, see sweetheart?” Sniffling Zach lifted his head and looked at Steve, his face puffy and red. Steve managed a wobbly smile.
Vision and Deadpool arrived on the scene first. Deadpool leaped from Vision’s back and announced himself with sexual inuendo while Vision went to take care of Wanda. He was the only one who could after all.
“Why didn’t you save me Mamma?”
“That’s cheating!” Telling Pepper was the ultimate way to get Tony to back down and Rhodey knew it, using it to his advantage.
“Shut up!” Roger’s bellowed, using his super strength he managed to wrench Deadpool’s katanas from him and delivered several bone crushing punches to the Merc’s face which only had Wade prat falling backward and pulling Rogers down with him, at which point he wrapped his legs about Rogers waist and flipped them over to straddle him, actually gyrating his hips as he did so,
Steve frowned. The law was not something he knew that well, not beyond layman’s understanding. Really they needed professional legal guidance.
“Have you any idea how embarrassing it was to make the damn video?” Steve countered, “Or how many condoms I had shoved into my boots, socks, art supplies, inside my draws, and even left in my coffee mug by Clint and Tony after I’d done the video?”
“Your Son…Zach…Peter…”
“The one on the outskirts of the City, on the border of Nassau County.” MJ said.
Natasha opened her mouth to speak but webbing slapped over her lips silencing her, then more wrapped about her wrists forming cuffs to restrain her.
“You cut my Son?” Tony whispered looking up from staring at Peter’s mutilated body to the demented Doctor behind him.
“I know.” Steve said the moment Peter drew breath, “But you really hurt your Mother.”
“Can we go camping on the beach?” Peter asked, “And make a camp fire on he beach and make s’mores?” He’d heard several of the kids at school talk about doing that and going camping with their family and was keen to try it himself. “It’s a teacher training day on Friday, so we can fly out Thursday night and spend Friday, Saturday, and Sunday on the Island and come back Sunday evening.”
“I’m sure she could win a beauty contest,” Pepper said, smirking as she came into the lab. It was still a bit of a shock to the system to see Tony interacting so easily with a baby, but then, he treated his bots like toddlers, so perhaps she shouldn’t be so surprised after all.
“Just to Shield.” Tony said pouring the batter into the frying pan, “It shouldn’t take me long.”
"Oh, we submit!" Tony panted teetering over the edge, "We fully and freely submit!" He came apart beneath Steve, who continued to thrust inside him until he too was climaxed and rolled over onto his side.
*****
Shield HQ.
“I don’t see why not.” Steve agreed, “We can work out in the gym together, so long as you can keep up with your schoolwork too.”
At dinner he was given his favourite dinner which was macaroni cheese, with extra bacon, and had a slice of his birthday cake, a Dr Who themed birthday cake of course and blew out the candles as everyone sang happy birthday to him.
“What have you done, what have you done?” Maria screamed at Howard, as he carried the convulsing Tony out of his lab. The boy was no longer crying, but his convulsions were worsening and his nose and ears were bleeding.
“I know the feeling.” Steve said, “I was worried when I was first enhanced, worried I wouldn’t be accepted, that I would just be seen as a science experiment, a tool for the army to use rather than a person.
“Hey Spiderguy!” Ned greeted with a yawn, “You in position.”
“Got yourself a get out of jail free card.” Tony said taking a seat beside the doctor who was pulling away, trying to sink into the pillows and mattress. “Its nice to see that karma got hold of you even if the law didn’t.”
Tony too would be changed by this, he would be devastated, broken. Any chance of their having a baby together would be gone because social services would take the child from them.
“Of course Sir. I shall awaken Doctor Banner and inform him of the situation.”
“Iron Man!” The boy declared, and sure enough he had on an Iron Man costume.
“On it babe.” Tony called back finding his way into the battlements of the castle and took out soldiers in his path, with Jarvis’ help he found the power source for the energy shield and fired missiles at it knocking it out, “The draw bridge is down people.”
*****
“And it is.” Steve breathed, “Now how about we finish this off together, then take it back to bed with us, along with Lily?”
“What?” Steve was looking even more confused now, “Tony, what does our ages have to do with anything? And find someone my own age, my age is ninety, what am I going to do with a ninety year, I can hardly take them to the local dance hall can I? They’d dislocate their hip doing the Lindy Hop!”
“If it’s a Junior then it’ll be James Junior.” Rhodey put in.
Bruce was right, Peter was right. He did like Tony, really like him. Wanted to go steady with him. But how could he?
When she’d seen them both engrossed in building a space rocket, Pepper and rolled her eyes and said she wasn’t sure which of them was in fact the child, Tony had proved his maturity by sticking his tongue out, which of course made Peter snort with laughter.
“Tony’s in the lab. You can go down and speak to him when you’ve thought about what you want to say.” Steve said, “You can also join us for dinner, but for the rest of the time you are grounded, Jarvis will also be monitoring your Internet access and won’t allow you to use the tablet for anything but homework related searching.”
He was outside on the lawn and turned with a frown. “Well it’s about t…” He didn’t finish the rest of the sentence as a repulser blast was fired at him and he only just had a second to dodge it, or he would have gotten the lot to his face!
“Wanda Maximoff has been given psychokinetic and telepathic abilities by the sceptre.” Jarvis explained, “She is able to manipulate matter, move it, change it, and destroy it. She can read minds and implant suggestions and hallucinations, which she has done to various test subjects, resulting in violent behaviour both to themselves and others.”
“Yeah, on the other side of the Island.” Tony said, “There’s a cliff face and several rocks you can dive from, the sea is deep enough that you won’t hit the bottom.”
“We’ll take the stairs.” Bruce said knowing the others wouldn’t want to wait.
“A Boy.” May called back as Bruce carefully cut and clamped the cord.
Deadpool nodded, “Sure thing Iron Momma-bear, I won’t touch your webblicious cub, I’ll save all my touching for you.”
Whoa, back up there Rogers, Tony was not his Omega, no matter how much he might want him to be.
*****
“Why don’t you tell them?” Tony shouted at Rogers, “Tell them how you and Romanoff hid my parents murder, how you’ve lied to my face for fucking years!”
He was older than his own Tony had been, in the mid-forties, rather than his thirties. He was smaller too. His Tony had been six feet tall, his chest and shoulders broad and muscular.
“So, what, they said they’d get you off them?” Tony asked looking about the shit hole the dumbass was living in.
“Yes.” Steve said, “It didn’t work, he had blood tests when we got back to camp.”
“Small stuff.” MJ said.
“Find the sceptre.” Thor ordered heading back up into the air.
“OUT!” A soldier barked in German aiming a rifle at him.
Tony snorted and shook his head, “There is no fixing it, I’ve already tried, I’ve been through every element known to man, there is nothing.”
“You don’t have to.” Tony said to the Android, “You are more than welcome here.”
“Sweet Man, you did that in no time at all.”
"It's Osborn's fault." He snarled, "I'll sue that arrogant, incompetent assclown into hell for this, I'll see his company ripped apart and burned to the ground." He was clenching his hands into fists looking very much like he wanted to get them around Osborn's throat.
Fury leaned forward folding his hands and resting his wrists on the desk, “It will only be used to deal with hostiles.”
Before they could head to Rose Hill or Fuck-hell as Tony called it, Tony had to stabilize the extremis in Zach’s body.
“Hmm, maybe pint-sized!”
“What do you think of Right Here Waiting For You by Richard Marx?” Tony asked Steve.
“We’ll get back to you.” Steve said, they needed to talk about this in private and figure out what was best before they made any solid decisions regarding the wedding.
“Well, this is nice and depressing.” Clint said, setting shot glasses on a tray and brough them over with the tequila, lime wedges and salt, “But can you two kiss and make up so we can go back to focusing on Hydra?” He directed this at Natasha and Tony who looked disgusted at the suggestion, Tony looked around Clint to Natasha.
Tony got Zach kitted out in his winter clothing before he allowed him out onto the balcony to go and build some snow men (They would go to central park for the snow ball fights as Tony didn’t think it would be safe on the balcony)
“Hey Jay, how you doing buddy?” Tony greeted the AI.
Sam would be next, his body beaten so hard into the ground he was practically flattened, but still reaching out for Rhodey, who’s crumpled body lay close by, the armour crushed inwards piercing his flesh and crushing his body beneath its weight.
“Who the hell are you and what the hell are you doing in my garden at 2am?” an irate and suspicious sounding man asked.
“Yes,” Tony said, pointing at Rhodey, “Yes I hit my head, I’ve hit my everything and what I’ve said was true, the question is, what are they doing here?” He pointed to Clint and Natasha.
“But if he did that then he’d be denounced, the president and the joint chiefs would see him stripped of rank and dishorably dischared.” Steve said.
“We will, but not yet.” Fury said, “We’ll go tonight, or rather the early hours of tomorrow morning, when the guards are sleepy and won’t be paying much attention. Two am, meet us at West Potomac park and don’t be late.” He said the last to Tony who give him a ‘who me?’ look.
Tony looked at him and then at his puppy eyed boys. He sighed and rolled his eyes, “Alright, one hour, then I want you back up here.” He was then smothered in hugs and kisses by Peter and Zach who eagerly scampered off to join Sam and Natasha on the way down the path to the sea.
“Oh, and just to let you know, the parties cancelled.” Tony said to Happy as he headed for the bathroom, “Let Pepper know will you?”
That vicious little bitch hated him, Tony knew that. She blamed him for her parents deaths. A Stark Bomb. He’d never sold to anyone but the US Military. But Stane had. Tony suspected it was one that he’d sold and was looking into it, along with all the Shield files he’d amassed after the data dump.
“Five, four, three…” She smiled as Clint bolted for the nearest door, “Predictably easy as always.” She cheerfully sent the video to Laura, Clint’s wife, it would be the perfect blackmail material for when Clint was trying to get out of doing the washing up. With a bright smile on her face, Natasha heading for room to go and get changed into the beautiful emerald green Gucci gown that Tony had purchased for her.
“Well it had to come out sooner or later.” Sam offered, taking the damp towel from the back of his neck and rubbed his hair with it.
After reading the Doctor’s report Steve set the pages down, “I don’t understand all that is written there.” The super soldier admitted, “But I think I get the gist of what he’s saying.”
There was something wrong, very wrong.
Sam set the Quinjet down on the roof of the hospital where the trauma team were waiting to meet the Avengers team.
“Of course he did.” Tony sighed, “I swear to God, I will chop that pain in the arse into tiny little pieces and throw them all into separate active volcanos!” Rhodey nodded not looking like he disagreed with the suggestion,
By the time Zach and Peter got home from school Steve and Natasha had worked out a strategy for the ground assault on the Hydra base while Tony and Sam had worked out a coordinated arial strike. (They had stopped including Thor in strategizing because Thor’s main strategy when it came to battles while it hit everything that moved until it stopped moving and that also included air attacks)
Finally Thursday evening rolled around and the family all piled into the Quinjet which was stuffed with their belongings, food, drink, and toys, plus camping equipment so Peter and Zach could camp on the beach.
“Play it.” Tony said, scooting over the bench so Steve could sit besides him, “Wanna watch a Shield/Hydra home movie?”
She was a young woman of perhaps thirty, she had a baby strapped to her chest in a papoose and a toddler at her side holding her hand. “What have I told you about watching where you’re running?” She scolded Robbie.
He shrugged his costume had been terrible.
“Fury sent us to keep an eye.” Clint said, “The dicks at WSC were breathing down his neck, they want you lot kept under surveillance, it was us or Rumlow and his pack of trigger happy fuckwits.”
“Why?” Tony asked.
“Murderer.”
Vision frowned. From what he had observed on the TV, and during the meeting they had had at the compound, Tony was not using this other Steven Rogers for anything, and he seemed to genuinely like Lily. Vision was still learning about humans and their interactions, but he did not think that Wanda or Sam were correct in their assessments.
Clint had been the epitome of the naughty little brother. Hulk and Thor had been the badass big brothers that no one wanted to mess with.
“Us having babies won’t happen for a very long time.” Tony explained, ignoring Sam and Clint.
“Its like that.”
The latter was explained when a left over from Woodstock staggered out of the bathroom telling his two bed partners not to go into the bathroom for twenty minutes.
“You are worth something to Stark though, and that makes you worth something to me.” The man said then he grinned, “At least you’d better hope you are worth something to your whore of a mother, or you’ll die burning from the inside out.”
“We’ve got him Cap, go with Pete.” Natasha said, “Tony would want you to.”
Choking on his own tears Peter made an abortive attempt to go to him but Rhodey pulled Peter to his chest and held him tight, Pepper and Happy flanking him as they comforted Peter, letting Sam, Natasha, Clint, and Bruce go to Steve.
Thor’s palm slammed into the table making it shake and groan, “I second such a plan!”
“Where is he Jarvis?” Steve asked summoning his shield to his arm,
Tony groaned as the metal twisted and began to pinch, threatening to crush his foot, his ankle protesting when he tried to twist free.
38 years ago.
Tony’s seatbelt was stuck, he’d hurt his arm in the crash and his hand wasn’t moving that well so he couldn’t undo the lock, when Steve had leaped out the car the man who’d attacked had lunged inside and with only one person left there he turned his attention on Tony back handing him with that metal hand which nearly knocked Tony out then that hand and the flesh one were wrapped about his throat and squeezing.
“Traitor!” Tony grumbled, but did not put up a fight, he was dead on his feet, his entire body was aching, and he felt completely rung out, as if he had been put through an old fashioned mangle.
After his first talk with Steve, Tony found himself able to talk to the Alpha more freely and felt the better for it. Sharing his experiences through the wormhole, his worries about a second attack on earth, and his nightmares seemed to help ease them, they didn’t go away completely but Tony started to be able to get a few uninterrupted hours sleep a night and eventually even a few days a week without nightmares.
“Ugh no Star Wars references, it is the Stark Side, you’d be coming over to.”
“I never even met her parents how could I have possibly killed them?” Tony sneered.
“They are Cap, I was just joking.” Fury said putting a hand up in surrender.
“Pepper…” Tony began, but she cut him off,
“How dare you say such a thing?” he asked of her, securing Lily better in his arms, “Tony has been nothing but welcoming and generous to me and Lily, and looks to have been to all of you too, not that you’d know it by the “Abundance of gratitude” you’re showing him,” His voice dripped with sarcasm and his generous mouth was pulled into a sneer,
*****
They actually made Steve feel a little bit more secure about his outfit as they checked in and went to the suite.
The world went insane of course. Once the news broke it was on every newspaper, magazine, and news feed.
Steve nodded feeling grateful for her concern and support.
“No, Wanda, he doesn’t.” Wanda screeched and launched herself at Vision, lashing out with her magic, which passed through him ineffectually as he fazed, moving closer to her until he was right over her, at which point he became solid again and pressed the mind stone against her head draining the magic out of her.
Poor Zach, he had no idea what was happening or why it was happening, with his brother in hospital hurt things were bad enough, but being told he wasn’t allowed to go to school because he was different was too cruel.
Steve remained on the floor comforting Peter for several minutes, while the others glanced at each other awkwardly until Natasha sighed, “We should debrief, pool all the intel we have on what happened at the base, all of what Jarvis discovered, and set up a watch rotation on Tony. He might be out of Sokovia but that doesn’t mean he’s not still in danger.”
“I’m the chair guy, not the running guy, I’ll monitor communications while you do the running.”
Sokovia
“No but…”
“I don’t want to go either but we have to Zach.” Peter said patting his little brother’s back, “The law states we have to go to school, Mamma will be in trouble if we don’t and you don’t want Mamma to get in trouble do you?”
“Sure there is, and I actually enjoy ball gags, especially where there are leather collars and leashes involved!”
“Sounds good to me.” Steve agreed looking rather sex-dazed, he also had a Cat-that-got-the-cream smile on his face and a strut in his step as he walked to the shower with Tony, joining him beneath the spray, the both of them eager to get clean and go and eat so they could satiate their hunger.
“I think you should talk to Mamma first.” Peter said, “Then, ask Steve.”
“We will be conducting some interviews.” The host said, “But they will be arranged at a time convenient to yourselves and none of the topics mentioned in the contract will be raised.”
“We can’t just have the sex without the fight?”
*****
“Miami. A.I.M is based in Miami. Owner of the company…..” Tony slapped the steering wheel in frustration as he tried to recall the name of the billionaire owner and creator of the outfit. Pepper had a meeting with him recently, Happy had been unhappy about it. Alan…Arlen….Adrian? Tony couldn’t remember.
Tony hummed, “It better be a damn good breakfast Rogers.”
Chili.
“I would suspect Pietro of being the perpetrator of Sir’s injuries.” Jarvis said, “He is known to use conventional weapons as well as his super speed. His sister prefers to use her powers alone. That said, I would not be surprised to discover that she too had attacked Sir.”
“Where are you going?” Tony cried after him, tears now spilling down his cheeks.
“Your voice still squeaks, you’re a kid.”
“It’s given us each-other, it’s given us Zach and Peter.” Steve said rubbing Tony’s back, “That’s a lot more than a lot of people get.”
“Are you okay?” Peter asked, holding back from hugging Tony in fear of hurting him more, but was pulled into the family hug anyway.
At first Tony thought he felt shitty because he was recovering from giving birth. Having stitches in his unmentionables, bleeding heavily, leaking colostrum and eventually milk, aching in his pelvis and slowly recovering stomach muscles, and being on the verge of total exhaustion would have made anyone feel like crap.
Stark was in Vienna. He knew that, it had been all over the news, that Stark was having a meeting with the United Nations in Vienna.
The boys promised, Zach kissing Tony and bounding out of the car, running into the play ground to join his friends. When it was Peter’s turn he gave Tony a smile and promised to call if he needed to, then headed into his school at a much more sedate pace.
He almost jumped out of his skin when his mobile rang and he answered the call without even looking at the number, his heart leaping inside his chest when he heard the voice through the ear piece.
“Well I…guess so.” Bruce stammered, he really didn’t have a lot of experience around children and often felt out of his depths when dealing with Zach. Peter was easier as he was older, but Zach was still a toddler and Bruce was often unsure of what to expect from him. His eyes widened as Zach set his panda down, slid of the sofa and toddled over to him and climbed up his legs to sit on his lap.
Steve nodded, “Everyone be ready to leave by then.”
“Screw you!” Zach spat at him, “My Mamma and Daddy will beat you up!”
“Or artist.” Steve offered.
Deeper and deeper he swam, forcing himself to go further into the cove, frantically searching for Tony, ignoring the burn in his own lungs, ignoring the need to breathe, ignoring everything but finding him.
“Director.” Natasha said and gave a curt nod to Maria, Tony however scoffed and shook his head,
“Communications?” Peter typed imagining ear pieces and walkie talkies and such.
“Hurts.” Tony ground out, the pain not fading completely even as the contraction finished, the bathroom door slammed open and heavy boots stomped across the floor. Tony sucked in a deep breath and stared at the door to the stall as each one was kicked open.
Clearly this was Jonny’s work and his sister would smack him upside the head for her see through outfit.
His knee had been replaced and pins had been put into his tibia and his femur.
Steve was quiet for the rest of the day, he put on show for the others but he couldn’t fool Tony who knew he was still feeling upset. Figuring the best way to help Steve was to show him that he had nothing to be ashamed of, Tony revealed something about himself to Steve as they prepared for bed that night.
“I’m grounding all of them.” Steve said, “No sweets for two weeks either, or desserts!”
*****
“Would St… I mean Mr Stark even want me on his team? I haven’t exactly been great to him.”
He mentally added making Shieldra a thing to his to do list and took out his phone to looking through his overflowing e-mail box, deleting anything that looked boring, for example anything that came from the members of SI Board of directors. His PR liaison, wanting him to do meet and greets with the rich and thoroughly brain dead. Any aspiring politicians wanting to glad hand, and any e-mails from Pepper’s assistant that wasn’t Pepper herself sending an E-mail practically screaming at him to respond.
“Captain Rogers is requesting your presence Sir.” Jarvis said, “And I must alert you to the fact that Master Zach has instigated full scale war in the lab with Dumm-E, Butterfingers, and U, and Agent Barton is aiding and abetting via the ventilation ducts.”
He had known something was wrong as he began to regain more awareness once he had been brought out of the coma.
“Yeah baby. Tell Rhodey to tell Sam to fly Matt out on a Quin jet, they’ll get here faster than a conventional plane.”
“Don’t move.” Daredevil growled at her.
The tears were back and this time Tony didn’t try to hold them in, he stretched his arms out and Steve carefully pulled him into a hug, “God I love you so much.” Tony said into Steve’s chest, “I don’t know how I managed to get through life without you before, but I know I never want to be without you now.”
“I’ll die first.” He rammed his forehead against Rogers, making the smaller man stagger as dizziness assailed him.
“How did you nearly burn the kitchen down?” Tony asked, laughing as he folded up the letter,
Despite his unorthodox addition to the team Spider-Man, AKA Peter Parker was a very welcome member of the new team of allies they were building.
“That’s okay,” She said, “I’m Lydia, we have English together.”
“And we’ll help you.” Happy said, “I may not have training in rehabilitation but I can learn, and I taught your sorry ass how to box.”
He’d never believed that new parents didn’t have time to shower, now he did. Three days went by in which he didn’t get out of his pyjamas, brush his hair, or do anything but try and sleep when Zach slept.
Beyond the odd cold, a few chest infections when he’d been teething, Zach had been remarkably healthy, then, without any warning his temperature spiked and began to complain of his muscles aching and feeling sick.
“Because you ordered me to, and I quote, “Butt out of my culinary endeavours, I know what the fuck I am doing!” FRIDAY replied sounding smug,
“I was always going down with infections and illnesses.” He went on, “Everything from colds to stomach upsets to chest infections and the like.”
“How’s it going?” Bruce asked, while Zach and Peter took the shells to decorate the sand castle city.
“We do still need to talk.” Steve said, hissing as Tony’s hand slid under his shirt, “Have a discussion, set some rules about talking to each other more…” He bucked his hips as Tony’s hand undid his flies and fondled his growing erection.
Fresh tears filled Tony’s eyes but these were tears of joy as he held his baby girl for the first time, taking in the details of her face, her chubby little limbs, tiny hands and feet, the wispy tuft of hair dusting her scalp, she was the most precious and perfect thing Tony had ever seen in his life.
“Yeah, sick all over my furniture.” Tony groused, “Barton!” He yelled and Clint turned away from the camera he was holding up to his face with a frown,
Tony met his gaze without flinching, “I’m doing what Howard never cared to. I’m ensuring my families safety. Hammer is rich, he’ll spend a handful of years in a minimum security prison and then get out on some technicality or other, buy a judge or two to get his freedom and then he’ll go and find himself some new genius psychopath to help him get revenge. I’m not letting that happen, that idiot has cost enough lives already, too many. He needs to be stopped for good.”
“…and after the Met we’re gonna get Ice cream!” Zach was babbling as he lead and half-asleep Peter into the kitchen by the hand, Peter was rubbing his face, his hair standing up every which way, and looked equal parts adorable and hilarious.
*****
“Thanks Jay, see you in the morning.”
It was still a bit of a shock, hearing that Irish female voice instead of the familiar British Male voice of Tony’s AI, why he hadn’t repaired the program Roger’s didn’t know. Tony always seemed to emotionally attached to his mechanical inventions, like those robots in his lab, and those malfunctioning kitchen appliances, treating them like they were people instead of just the lumps of wires and metal that they were made of.
“To…tear us apart?”
“Uh huh,” Clint said, “Tony got a call, they’re reconvening at ten tomorrow..” he glanced at the clock, “This morning and will have their decision.”
While he could have left the job of speaking to Peter and drawing out what was bothering him to Tony, Steve didn’t want to leave the difficult aspects parenting to Tony, he wanted to share the responsibility himself.
“You’re a Munchkin until I say your not a Munchkin, now go to bed.” Tony said.
“Advice?” Rhodey rose an eyebrow, “Dating advice, surely you’ve been on a date before.” At Steve’s shame faced blush Rhodey gaped, “Holy crap. Well, uh, I assume I don’t have to explain everything…you know about how Alpha’s and Omega’s….work right?”
Clint Barton and Natasha Romanoff’s past missions.
“I’m good.” Peter said with a shrug, “My head’s still a bit woozy but the Doctor said that’ll wear off soon.” Tony made an unhappy noise at this information, clearly not loving the fact that Peter was going to be suffering after-affects from the tranqs. Peter’s attention however had switched back to Zach whom he bounced on his lap, “What’s this about trouble here being a super-hero?”
“There’s fishes too.” Zach said, “What fishes are they?”
“Mr Stark how do you feel now you are out of the hospital?”
“So do I.” MJ said. “I’ll take three months grounding if necessary but I’ve got to see Pete, I need to know the dumbass is okay.”
“Just keep breathing baby, nice deep breaths, don’t clench up and I’ll be with you soon I swear.”
Steve grinned and saluted her, then stepped onto Rhodey’s booted feet and wrapped his arms about the mans neck, holding on tight as they blasted off.
Oddly enough it was not fear that filled him then, it was sorrow that he felt as he acknowledged this, sorrow for Steve, for Zach, for Peter, sorrow for the pain his leaving would cause them. It didn’t seem fair, they had been so happy, had so much planned. He’d had so much planned, so much he wanted to do before he died. He’d wanted to marry Steve, to see his boys grow up, maybe have another baby. He’d wanted to open his school, see future generations advance mankind. He’d wanted to go on more camping trips, family holidays, picnics. He’d wanted to argue with Steve over what to watch on TV when they were old and grey, wanted to be one of the couples who walk slowly along the piers arm in arm, still in love after decades together.
A small involuntary laugh escaped his lips and everyone, Tony included looked at him, “You are impossible.” He said with a shrug, “Incredible and impossible.”
“Ladies first.” Iron Man said gesturing for Loki to get on board ahead of him and Steve. The Demi-God snorted lightly and sauntered past them both looking far too comfortable and confident for Steve’s comfort, something was wrong with this situation, very wrong.
“There is loads of presents under the tree and loads of them have my name on them!” Zach squealed.
“Hey Cap, you haven’t said, do you want a boy or a girl?” Sam asked over the coms as he swept down, grabbed three soldiers and took them up into the air then dropped them from thirty feet down onto several other soldiers.
Within ten minutes of getting back to the tower Tony was in his under-suit and ready to go, joining the others on the quinjet and strapping in while Clint took them into the air and got them to cruising altitude at which point they could move around freely.
‘Not as bad as when we trekked all the way from Rio to Mexico City in bare feet’ Winter commented in Bucky’s head, ‘They were sore for days after that’
“For blaming you for Ultron.” Steve said, “I thought… well never mind what I thought, I was wrong. Wanda said that she did to you what she did to us, that she made you see… Tony, are you okay?”
“You haven’t.” Natasha soothed,
He always had my back and that continued right into adulthood and even after I became Captain America. He would still try and look out for me and watch my back even though I could fight for myself.
“Get him off me or I swear I will amputate my own limbs!” Tony growled kicking at Deadpool like he was a rather a nasty smelly dog, not that it made much difference, as Deadpool continued to cling like a limpit as they went back inside the tower.
Realizing that he had no choice, but to go and see Tony in person and try to shake some sense into him, Rogers went to New York and to the newly renamed Stark Tower.
“But you have risked your life for strangers, fought along side a group of strangers whom you had only just met and then formed a team with them.”
“Hey!” Bruce protested, cutting into the increasingly unpleasant discussion, “That’s enough, both of you.”
Besides her Clint let out a grunt, “Who can blame him, we all nearly got nuked for Christ sakes. Who’s stupid fucking idea was that?”
Steve scoffed, “They wouldn’t charge us, we’re The Avengers.” Natasha gave him a hard look.
So Lily-Bee was just another adorable nickname to the list. He had his own for her too, Princess, and Little Star.
“Jarvis activated your Ultron program.” Steve said, “He’s currently in the Vision armour and standing guard in the hall, there are six Iron Legion drones over the hospital and more guarding Stark industries.”
Tony was wearing Captain America beach trunks.
Steve clapped a hand over his mouth and bolted from the cell, he shoved past the rest of the team, going to the nearest toilet and threw up everything that was in his stomach then collapsed onto the floor sobbing.
Tony’s eyes narrowed, “Call my Son a brat again and I will be facing criminal charges for ripping your tongue from your head.”
Gulping in air and sniffing hard as he tried to get his emotions under control Peter looked from Tony to Steve, “How? Will I have to leave school?” Part of him wouldn’t miss school, he always learned more with Tony anyway, but he would miss Ned and MJ, and he didn’t want Tony and Steve to have to go through the trouble of finding him another school or home educating him.
“It’ll be mute man if you don’t shut up.” Natasha said, “And as for what brings us here. Clint and I have been stood down from active Shield Duty until such time as Fury can get it up and running again. Clearing out Hydra has made things difficult, it could be a long time before Shield is back in business.”
Sam did not seem as pleased by it, neither did Natasha, but Rogers was proud, though he wished that the other news stations and news papers would leave off. Which was one of the things that he wanted to talk to Tony about, one of the many things actually, since it seemed Tony and Steve were making overtures to other groups to form a team of their own against this imagined threat of Tony’s.
“He’ll bleed to death you fool, you hit the artery.” Doctor Curien snarled, and suddenly the Doctor was beside Peter and wrapping a strap about his upper thigh, tightening it painfully tight to cut off the blood supply.
Tony’s eyes were open but glazed as he rose from the bed, Steve was laid out snoring quietly but Tony didn’t see him, he didn’t see his bedroom, or the penthouse at all, what he was seeing was a wasteland of a destroyed, post-apocalyptic world.
“You could have done more.”
“Because he be lonely by himself, he needs family.”
After that things went worryingly silent and the adults were foolish enough not to worry until it was too late and Zach was riding around on a wooden crate that now had a lawn mower engine fitted to it and skate board wheels and was being remote controlled by Harley and Peter who had used cannibalized an old remote control car for the parts.
“No, but…”
“Oh yeah,” Tony stepped away from Steve and grabbed the kitchen roll to finished wiping foam out of his hair, “Its upper state New York, just an old storage factory but with enough land around it for expansion.”
“But you did, get him back I mean?” A troubled expression passed over Steve’s face,
“But it’s not fair, I’ve done nothing, and I want to be with you!” Zach wailed.
“Let the idiot in, I’ll let…. The other idiot in.” Sam said, getting to his feet and going to the door, letting Vision deal with Deadpool, while he let in Peter and surprisingly Clint.
“I doubt much would shock Mamma.” Peter said, “But I appreciate it.” He then surprised Steve by reaching out and hugging him tight, “I love you Dad.” He said fiercely, “I love you and Mamma so much.”
Thor thumped down on the ground and sent Mjolnir into a swing, holding out his hand for her return, “The sceptre must be here.” He said, “They’d never have achieved this without it.” He caught Mjolnir, “We’ve found it, at long last.”
Zach sniffled, lowering his cuddly toy from his face and looked at Tony, “My Daddy was bad.” He whimpered, “Hurted you.”
“You too big guy.” Tony said, “Now lets get after that bastard and get my son back.”
“Knew I’d be fine.” Peter grumbled sulkily.
Somehow that suggestion had been turned into an “Epic slumber party” Steve wasn’t quite sure how that had happened but he had a sneaking suspicion that Clint was involved as he’d seen Peter high fiving the archer and that was very damning evidence.
“Why wouldn’t it be?” Zach innocently asked, “Them goes on date thingy, then Steef buys pretty ring like Rory did for Amy, then them gets mawwied and has babies,” He frowned “How does them do that bit, how does the baby get into Mamma’s tummy?”
“Well I’m working on making a web fluid.” Peter said relaxing further, “And I’m not allowed on the ceiling, Mamma’s blood pressure gets too high if I do so,” He easily dodged the pillow Tony threw at him and grinned.
Professor Xavier had agreed to an alliance should the need arise, Logan had grunted by way of response, but that was his normal response to practically anything, Colossus was of course ready and willing, every solid crome inch of him was practically vibrating with enthusiasm, which had Tony thinking naughty, Deadpool like thought which he promptly shut down, still dreading to arrival of the deranged lunatic.
It was mind boggling, fascinating, and left Steve feeling so out of place and lonely. He missed the forties so much, despite the war, despite the poverty, at least then he’d had friends, he’d had a purpose, he’d known how to interact with people. Here, he had nothing and no one. Reading the files on the Howlies had been depressing to say the least. All dead, save for Peggy who was retired and in a home, suffering Alzheimer’s disease, which he’d learned was a form of senile dementia.
“Duh, of course, plain steel is so out of fashion!”
Pressing a hand to his chest which ached from where he was still aching from his arrythmia earlier. He was more than ready to take a shower and curl up in bed when Steve came out of one of the guest bedrooms looking bewildered.
“I can’t!” The man protested,
“I have to find him!” Steve said suddenly grabbing Tony and squeezing his upper arms so tightly that Tony knew he’d have bruises.
“He said you’re not getting one.” Zach piped up as he retrieved his nerf bolts.
Clint shrugged. “I do enjoy the odd spanking..”
“Jealous Cap?” Sam asked him with a grin.
Pepper sighed and trailed a hand through Tony’s hair. She wouldn’t mention the slight tremors that were running through Tony’s body, nor the tears that were seeping into her blouse. Tony rarely if ever let anyone see him cry, he preferred to hide it from view, having been well taught by Howard that crying was something that only babies did, not Men, not Stark Men.
Everyone froze, Clint and Natasha glanced at Steve who had gone ashen.
“I’m not a munchkin, you’re a baby Hobbit!” Peter shot back, “You’re even getting hairy feet like Mamma.”
“Ass kicking can wait, debauchery first.” Tony said resting an elbow on Steve’s shoulder so he could card his fingers through his hair, “Lets go down his corridor a little way.”
It had a consciousness, a will of its own. It wasn’t one they could speak with or reason with so far as they could tell, while they could map out the consciousness and show it on a holographic display, they couldn’t communicate with it.
When he reached the penthouse floor, Rogers expected to be greeted by Tony, and his Other Self, but instead, he found Clint on his knees on the penthouse floor, waving a toy over the face of a giggling infant, who was laying on a play mat that had other toys dangling from arches over her head.
“Buzz kill.” Tony pouted, he said goodnight to the bots who Jarvis took back to the lab, promising to be down in the morning to see them.
“Who are these kids.”
From besides him Steve snorted into his hands and Tony shot him a glare, which he then levelled at Jarvis’ nearest camera, “Don’t think this won’t come back to bite you the next time you need an upgrade.”
Damnit, Hammer tech, why did trust that idiot Hammer to build the security systems and the self-destruct, he should have replaced the lot when the moron went to prison.
“Down here?” Steve asked with a frown, “Why?” What could possibly be down there that Tony would be interested in?
Steve smiled at Wanda, his chest puffing with pride.
“Not without a cost.” Thor said, bowing his head, “My Mother died at their hands.”
“Aye.” Thor said give his friends a smile as tears shone in his eyes, “Truly now I do feel lost. Where as first after her death I felt I knew my course, I knew I had to avenge her and prevent Maliketh from using the Reality Stone. Now that both are done, I am at a loss as to what my path shall now be.
“You are as arrogant as Stark’s memories say you are.” The Skrull hissed, it bared its teeth at Clint, “You think you can intimidate me? Why do you even care? After all..” The Skrull’s form shifted into Clint’s “You have to watch yourself around this guy, he might break your back.”
“This isn’t your fault you know?” Steve said, “The enhancements, Peter getting hurt, non of it is your fault.”
Meaning he had something to hide elsewhere. Damn AI, too smart for his own good, probably going to go Skynet and take over the world.
Steve flinched at the mention of Bucky.
“Sir is wounded and needs immediate medical assistance and retrieval.”
“Oh,” Steve stretched and placed his arms behind his head so he was a little more propped up as he looked down at Tony, “I don’t really care either way.” He replied, “A little boy like Zach and Peter would be nice, but a little girl would be super cute too, especially if she has your eyes and dimples.”
“Yeah.” Peter said shaking his head. He glanced at Ned and MJ.
Even if they didn’t, Peter and Zach’s lives would never be the same again, already their schooling had been interrupted, possibly permanently, the schools might refuse to ever allow them back, the other parents might protest against their inclusion, even attack them for simply being different. People might attack them anyway for being enhanced, the anti-mutant brigade were already coming out with their banners declaring the boys unholy abominations. Monsters that should be done away with.
“It was, that freak Doctor set it off.” Tony said, “Has that bastard’s body been found?”
*****
Rose Hill.
Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve, “Are you just humouring me?”
“It’s patient 087.” Doctor Curian said heading to the tentacle guy’s cage, “He must have broken his restraints and tried to escape.”
The detective smiled, “Keep telling yourself that Osborn, at least you believe it.”
“Not here.” Steve said, “We should get out of here,” He looked to Tony, “The Mansion?”
Still, needs must and if he had to suffer a permanent or, longer case of early pregnancy symptoms in order to get pregnant then so be it.
“Stark would have come even if I’d killed the brat.” He said sulkily, he wished he’d had longer with the boy, learned how his mutation had worked and learned everything he could from him.
What were they doing to him? Hydra were sadists, they’d enjoy making Tony suffer as he gave birth, wouldn’t give pain relief, wouldn’t offer any comfort, and that was assuming they didn’t deliberately hurt him.
“Sadly yes, Sir.” Jarvis replied, “I also have a video recording of your confrontation with Loki, would you like me to show that to Miss Potts and Captain Rogers too?”
Sam was sat in the kitchen drinking tea, there was a suspicious glass at his elbow with melting ice and the dregs of an amber liquid. Whisky most likely, well neither Steve nor, Tony could blame him for needing a drink after a couple of superheroes dropped on his doorstep.
Intensive care was bad, the coma was bad but he was alive, the main thing was he was alive.
“Hmm I promise.” Tony purred, “Especially when we’re talking in the language of love.”
Steve walked confidently down the red carpet, having clearly experienced this sort of thing in his own world, but was not so cocksure or arrogant as to forget to smile to those who called his name, or to raise a hand to wave.
On and on he fought until finally he managed to defeat the Bots in his vicinity and ran to Tony. He fell to his knees besides him, carefully reaching out to take the dented face plate off so he could see Tony’s face.
“Post hypnotic suggestion is more likely than full on mind control.” Tony said, “And POW’s have been broken before now, sleeper agents created by terrorists. When it comes to torture there is only so much anyone can take, and those bastards have had decades to break him.”
“So much for not getting too excited.” Steve drawled sharing a long suffering look with Pepper.
“This is Gingerbread, and this is Espresso.” Peter explained, lifting Espresso, the black kitten into his arms, the kitten meowed and squirmed bouncing down onto the sofa, “Zach saw an advert about an abandoned animals shelter and wanted to go and help out.”
“Sweet!” Clint cheered.
Bloating.
“Don’t be late.” With that Natasha hung up.
“Mamma?” Peter’s sleepy voice caught Tony’s attention and he demanded that Steve put his phone to Peter’s ear.
“I should protest at being man handled like this.” Tony said, as he lay in Steve’s arms bride style, “I’m not a Princess you know.”
“Work can wait, and I’ll stay,” Steve promised, “I’ll wake you if you start to have a bad dream.” He paused, “Unless you’d rather I get Pepper…”
He sat Tony down on his bed and set about turning down the covers and then actually got down on his knees before Tony to take off his shoes for him. Tony flexed his toes as Steve stowed his shoes and began to look around for Tony’s pyjamas, finding a simple vest and a pair of sweat pants for him to change into so he’d be comfortable while he slept.
Rogers barely resisted the urge to put his fist through the TV screen.
He would share more than just his worries and his past trauma, he’d speak of his experience growing up in Brooklyn, the things he’d get up to as a child when he was well enough to get into mischief, the scrapes that he and Bucky had gotten into, how they’d constantly come home with skinned knees and filthy hands and faces from playing in the alleys and the streets, daring each-other to clamber over walls, through broken windows, and into abandoned buildings.
“Mr Stark, Thank Heavens I have found you.” Vision said looking Tony over and made swift work of the wrist cuffs and took hold of Tony as the Omega lurched forward,
Steve whimpered and gazed up at the ceiling, begging for mercy as Tony made himself comfortable upon him, rubbing his nose into Steve’s chest and smacking his lips quite contentedly, it would have been a perfect scene, a perfect moment, had Steve not had an erection about to explode. He looked down at Tony, wondering if he could move the Omega, but one look at that relaxed face and Steve knew he couldn’t do it. Tony didn’t get enough sleep as it was and Steve was damned if he was going to disturb him for something as trivial as this.
Peter gave Bruce a tight lipped smile, his expression darkening as Clint came closer to him, “Why did you do that?” He screamed at Clint running at him, his hands balled into fists which he beat against Clint’s chest. The blows were weak, barely enough to knock Clint back half a step. But the rage was so uncharacteristic for Peter, that it knocked the wind out of Clint, that with the guilt he was already feeling, had him falling to his knees before the enraged boy.
“Great, thanks Honeybear,” Tony called back,
“Not me. That’s him, not me.”
The tension on the jet was rife as Clint pushed the engines as fast as they could go. The phone line was still open but Tony wasn’t responding anymore. Steve had heard shouting in German right after Tony had told him that they’d found him and since then nothing.
Steve tried to catch Peter as he fell to the ground but his own vision was blurring and he stumbled, trying to reach out for Zach, tried to tell the little boy to run, but it was too late, he was falling to the floor and blackness was swallowing him whole.
MJ snorted with laughter while Ned punched the air at Peter's snark, they were both scolded by the teacher for not paying attention, Flash getting a free pass as usual.
“You look like the stay puffed monster.” Zach laughed,
“Fine, just a static shock.” Tony said, “Someone doesn’t want me looking in here,”
“I just don’t want to lose you.” Peter said, “We saw it on the news after the phone cut off, we saw you fly through the wormhole and we waited, it felt like forever before you fell back through and it didn’t look like you were alive.” His voice had started shaking and his eyes were shining with unshed tears, “I thought you were dead! I thought you’d gone and left me like everyone else!”
“We have scheduled team training sessions twice to three times a week depending on everyones availability.” Steve explained, he was dressed in a vest that clung to every muscle and a pair of tracksuit bottoms that were so tight they should have been illegal.
Zach was an early riser.
“JARVIS.” Is Tony Stark’s A.I. who runs this tower and assists in the piloting of the Iron Man armour.” The Host explained to the camera.
He cried out as he hit the road and forced himself to roll over, struggling to his hands and knees. Clasping his bleeding stomach with his good hand he forced himself to his feet and staggered to the pavement, something whizzed past him then another thing, and another. Norman was shouting and swearing again obviously trying to finish him off, but was thankfully a bad shot.
“Yes sir!” Steve chuckled, giving Clint a mock salute, while Tony put his wallet into his inside pocket,

“Yeah, Doctor Frankenstein.” The cop sneered from the door, “And don’t worry, I’m sure the prison MO will be more than happy to assist you in changing your shit bag. The inmates too no doubt.”
The Twins remained illusive too, Clint and Natasha had been reaching out to all of the European contacts for news on the pair but so far nothing had turned up, the closest had been a possible sighting in Slovakia but it was unproven and when Sam and Clint had gone to search Bratislava they had found nothing.
Steve was torn between watching Zach and Thor discuss No No words, Tony give Rhodey a dressing down, and Peter trying to escape from sweeping with no success as his Mother spotted him and put him right back to work.
Tony sniffed and turned his head to look at Steve his eyes dark and swimming in anguish, "I can't loose him."
“As to our differences,” Steve said, answering Christine’s question. “I a lot less quick to judgement. Having lived longer and seen much more I have learned the value of taking my time before making decisions. Especially ones that can effect not just myself but many others. I have probably mellowed somewhat too, am less quick to anger and tend to look before I leap, again, probably something that can be contributed to age and experience. As I am given to understand, this worlds Steve Rogers had but one week in a military boot camp before being dosed with the serum, then became a… performer? Before rushing into an active war zone to save his friend. The Title Captain America being a stage name that was adopted by the military rather than an actual rank insignia.”
Thor had not taken Zach far from the hospital, he took him to the nearest fountain and slowly lowered them both down into the water which bubbled and hissed at the heat coming from Zach.
“Check, so um should we use like military code, like Roger, and watch your six, and taking point?”
“He created me.” Trevor confirmed.
“Ah, our little mutant is awake it seems.” The Doctor said coming into view, “Quite the interesting specimen you are, Mr Peter Parker-Stark.”
“What about Thor?” Clint asked,
“Aye.” Thor said, while he had never treated a human in the battle field he had assisted many Asgardian warriors with their injuries and knew how to stem a bleed. Placing his large hand over the wound he pressed down firmly while Bruce got a BP cuff around Tony’s arm and inflated it, clucking his tongue at the reading and then took his pulse.
“In your hands it might as well be a machete.”
“It’s okay.” Steve chuckled, “I know, having a crush makes everyone nervous.”
With Steve opening up about his own childhood, Tony began to speak about his, slowly at first, only sticking to the good parts, the times he’d shared with Ana and Jarvis, meeting Rhodey in college, the things they had gotten up to. Then as the weeks passed, he began to reveal the extent of Howard’s abuse, his distant Mother, suffering from untreated PND, and having been broken down by Howards neglect and alcoholism, he even eventually spoke of Ty Stone, how the bastard had raped him when he’d been drunk and drugged off his face. How that had ruined sex for him, how he’d never had another Alpha until Obie.
“I had Ice Cream with Daddy.” Zach said happily.
New York.
"Did you get that? Okay, thanks Natasha, we'll let you know when we hear anything." Steve disconnected and sank back in his seat. "She and Bruce are going to pick Zach up and take him for ice cream. Bruce thinks keeping him distracted will be a good idea." Tony nodded pressed his lips into a thin line. "They've called Pepper and she and Happy are flying in from Malibu. A message has been left for Rhodey but he's on some training exercise and won't be back for another three day so it might be a while before he hears what's going on."
“I’ll reprogram you and give you to a drive through, for the rest of your AI life you will be taking orders for burgers and fries.”
Curien didn’t think so, he was a scientist, a mathematician, the numbers made sense to him, the benefit outweighed the cost, and one day, when people were living with perfectly healthy bodies, having perfectly healthy children, and the human race had been advanced by a thousand years, they would see that he was right too and would praise him for his bravery.
“Alright Wade, what the hell are you doing here?” Matt demanded, Deadpool shrugged,

Vital Intelligence System Intervention Organisation Negotiation.  VISION
“Recruiting reinforcements?” Steve drawled letting himself enjoy the fact that Tony was alive for a few moments before he had tell him the horrible news about Zach.
Naturally Tony was eager to sleep with Steve again and not just in the sexual sense, but he was also nervous. Things weren’t the same now, he couldn’t just jump into bed and curl up anymore, he had to shift himself from the chair into bed after he’d finished in the bathroom, had to position himself into as comfortable a position as he could get and then he was pretty much stuck there.
“Maybe.” Tony said a wry smile curving his lips, “I might have been taking Zach and Pete for an early morning walk. Or perhaps we’d have been going to the park and while they played I would take a seat on a bench and you’d be there sketching or something.”
“You may be sure of that. I am not.” Norman grunted.
“We don’t know that Hydra is involved, this could be pure Shield.” Natasha cut in, “The plan isn’t to harm.”
“His think tank thought it up.” Trevor elaborated, getting up from the chair when Natasha released his collar, the idiot went to a filthy dresser and got a couple of beers while babbling about his stunning performance bringing the Mandarin to life, seemingly not understanding how serious his crimes actually were.
