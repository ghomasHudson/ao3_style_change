“Oh my God.  Oh MY GOD, Steve!  The fuck?” Tony shouted, pulling back from the tangle of Steve’s arms and glaring up at him.  “You’re Captain America.  Holy shit. Holy shit, Steve! What the fuck is going on???” Tony demanded.
The irony was, Tony thought, that those poor boys were probably going to get such a long talk about taking responsibility for their actions, they’d be offering up body parts before it was over.  He sighed and ran a hand through his hair, wincing as his palm caught on the bump.

Certainty was supposed to be comforting. He’d just lay here and wait for the comfort to arrive. Any minute now, he thought with a bitter huff of a laugh.
He took a moment to wonder at the irony of the fact that his attempt at regaining a sense of autonomy had resulted in a situation where he was in even less control.  He didn’t even know his current client’s name or where he was going.  Not that Steve felt threatened, exactly, just completely out of his element.
“I got your badge,” Happy announced, holding a plastic badge with Tony’s picture on it up to the camera.  “Captain Rhodes let me make it on your 3D printer thing.  Gotta tell you, Boss, that sure is an amazing piece of machinery.  They print guns on those things, did you know that?”
Ignoring the Pepper-voiced angel on his shoulder, he hit three-hundred and twenty-two while Steve talked to the Chef, squeezed and breathed out again, finding the rote of it getting easier and easier.  There was a lulling quality to listening to Steve talk, and Tony let it carry him along for a moment.
He twisted and repositioned himself a few more times, finally settling.  Closing his eyes, he tried to clear the thoughts from his mind, but he could feel them pulling at him.  He sighed, brow furrowing. A moment later, he felt a light stroke of fingers over his forehead and through his hair.  He huffed a low, pleased sound, and sighed again. God, that felt good. Shellhead hummed, a low, trilling sound that Steve could barely hear over the waves, but it never failed to soothe him.  He opened his eyes long enough to see Shellhead hovering above him, looking out at the sea while he threaded his fingers through Steve’s hair, an unreadable expression on his face. Sleep snuck up on Steve before he meant it to, but he dreamed again, this time that he was marching, marching in rows of soldiers, marching and singing, but it was all wrong.  It wasn’t, but it was, and he knew it, and only at the end of the dream did he realize the soldier next to him had a hole where his eye should be, and he was marching, marching forward, in rows of the dead, and someone was crying, and he needed to find them, but he couldn’t, because they were all dead, everyone was dead,
He could feel his knuckles scrape against the underside of the table, but kept doing it.  It gave him something to focus on, something to ground him, keep him here instead of letting his head run away, like it sometimes needed to when things got to be too overwhelming.
“I don’t deserve you. But,” Tony sighed, “I am a selfish bastard,” he finished after a moment, almost as if he were speaking to himself.  He sounded sad, and Steve didn’t like that, nor the words themselves.  They weren’t true.  Whatever…whatever this was between them, Steve knew they weren’t true.
Sure.  Because in between bringing down a black market arms ring that operated at the highest echelons of government and running a multi-billion dollar global conglomerate, Tony Stark was going to want to spend his free time getting to know the stripper he had to pretend to marry in order to avoid a felony charge.
Not that Steve had quite believed him the first time he’d watched Tony don the leather suit and metal helmet with its two bulbous glass eyes and descend to the bottom of the lagoon in a bubble of precious air.   Steve was somewhat used to the sight now, though it still both baffled and amazed him that Tony would ever even think to do such a thing, let alone actually come up with a way to do it. Yet, who but Tony would be so bold as shape the nature of things to suit himself?
“Ah.  I see,” Rogers said, shifting a bit in his seat, shoulders hunching like he was trying to make himself smaller, which was, let’s face it, a physical impossibility as far as Tony could tell.  “So, this, ah.  This whole thing isn’t really your idea, I take it?”
“I know.  It wasn’t your fault, though, Buck.  None of it, okay?” Steve said against Bucky’s shoulders as the other man clung to him and gave him a good shake before releasing him and stepping back.  “You gotta stop blaming yourself.”
“You’re him,” the woman said.  “The Raj’Inama.  The one they’re all talking about.  Look, Almec, it’s Tony’s special little pet, do you see?  Isn’t he divine? Of course, he would be.  Tony always had good taste.”
Actually, he understood perfectly.  Quite frankly, the idea of not having to talk to Howard was a gift in and of itself.  If he made a list, it would probably be 1) Four More Inches in Height; 2) Firefly Back On the Air; 3) Not Talking to Howard; 4) World Peace (mostly because this would annoy Howard); and 5) Personal Acknowledgment from George Lucas that Han Shot First.
“You saw how he fought, Tony.  That’s not—that’s not some crofter’s son who marched off to do his duty and is going back home to plow fields. The map table, the weaponry, this new idea for the walls you said—
“I should check in,” Tony said, pulling his phone out of his pocket.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Pepper and Rhodey exchange a look that left Pepper sighing and shaking her head, though a smile kept trying to work its way out.  “Should I?  Or is that too, I don’t know, clingy or something?  It’s weird, isn’t it?  Is it weird?”
Tony’s appetite was gone.  He picked at the pastry shell with his dessert fork until it was crumbs without eating any, while his mother looked on approvingly.
His breathing evened out, and the painful throbbing in his cock seemed suddenly distant. He could hear the roar of blood in his ears. His hand closed around the handle of the wooden paddle, and he picked it up, testing the weight, then slapping it against the top of his thigh. It made a nice, soft, cracking sound. It had a good, wide bloom of pain to it. Heavy and warm, the kind that hung around after the blow. The kind that went deep into the flesh and left a nice, stinging ache there. He liked it.
“Yeah,” Tony acknowledged after a beat, looking down at the toe of his shoe digging in to a divot in one of the deck planks.  “I didn’t know what to do.  I wanted…”  Tony began, sucking in a breath and cutting off the words in a cold rush of air down his throat.
Well, fuck me, Tony thought, looking up and blinking in shock at the two figures framed in the doorway.
“What’s—“ Tony started, then cleared his throat when the word came out ragged.  “What’s that even supposed to mean?”
“You have done more than enough, I think,” the taller of the two said with a slight snort of disapproval.
being controlled.  He is! I told you!” he growled, looking down at Anto and raising his fist again.  “You lying, little—”
“Not right away, anyway. I’ll be there for the wedding, of course,” Bucky clarified. “I need to go home. Brookland. Bruce said it was safe now. I’m a Lord now, after all. I should see what I’m Lord of, I suppose,” Bucky said, voice tight and raw with all the words he wasn’t saying clawing to get out. “I—I need to go, Steve. I need to see it. Them. I need to see them.”
pushed into him.  That was what it was, or as close to it as Tony’s mind could seem to grasp.  This thought should, of course, alarm him, but those thoughts were all held at bay by some invisible force.  He could almost see them, out of the corner of his eye, but he had no connection to them. The worry, the fear, the pain, all of that was too far flung for him to reach, and so, he just…didn’t   “I will not let him hurt you,” Jarvis promised Tony, who was clutching a broken transistor that he definitely should not have been playing with.
“Ah, crap, I was going to bring dinner,” Tony said, following Steve into his apartment.  “Sorry—I just. I forgot.”
“I told him he could be building security.  I think he cried a little,” Tony remarked, waving the meat fork in the air.  Tiny reams of steam were drifting out of the edges of the grill.  If he leaned over, he could probably get the boring kind of facial.
“James R. Rhodes,” Steve said with a frown.  “Air Force Academy.  Aerospace Engineering major.  Top 3% of his class…Looks good, but why him?”
“I know,” Steve acknowledged, glancing away.  His knee was bouncing underneath the table, and he forced himself to sit still.  “I mean, I don’t like it, but...I just think...we can’t pass this up. If he’s serious, then--then I think I should do it. There’s so much we could do with that kind of money.  Your business, Sam’s program...we could help Wanda with her brother’s immigration thing, and, I don’t know...a lot of stuff. I’m not--I’m not saying I
Steve looked around the cabana, unsure now what he was supposed to do.  He heard Tony heave out a frustrated puff of air, and glanced over at him.  Tony was gripping the edges of the tablet and looking up at where Steve stood in the middle of the cabana.  “You’re welcome,” Tony finally acknowledged, though it was like the words had to be pulled from him.  “Go swim.  Eat.  There’s beer and water in the cooler. Rest, read, I don’t care,” Tony said dismissively.
“What’s wrong, Tony?” Steve asked with a frown. He was playing with Tony’s hair where it curled at the nape of his neck, still a little damp from their shower, though his hand stilled at Tony’s words. “Did something happen with Batroc and those files he has?”
“That’s…” Bruce cut himself off, a deep frown pocketing his features as he returned Tony’s steady gaze. “That’s…interesting. That’s really…that’s
“One of the other concubines said they never stay long before they are sold off,” Steve replied, setting his sketchbook to the side. “She hoped to be sold to your harem, I think.  Amara.”
“Skywalk. Best view there is,” Tony replied, shoving his arms into his jacket, which he had taken off at some point in the helicopter.  Steve remembered that because Tony had rolled up his sleeves and Steve had the occasion to notice he had surprisingly nice arms, a thought he definitely was not thinking about again, he told himself firmly.
“Day-glow painted, KISS-themed mini-golf too dull for Tony Stark, huh?” Steve joked.  “Interesting, how, exactly?”
Tony’s head dropped to his chest and he put his hands on his hips, stranding that way for a long moment.  Finally, he raised his eyes, dark pools that locked on Steve and there was so much Steve could read on his face, anger, guilt, shame, a whole mix of emotions on vibrant display.  For once, it seemed, Tony wasn’t hiding anything about how he was feeling, but Steve still didn’t know why, what had driven Tony to this point.
Then, Tony’s parents died, and he had been probably nanoseconds away from spiraling into a series of bad coping mechanisms when Steve found him at the reception after the funeral.  Steve had clapped a hand on Tony’s shoulder and said something nice.   Something consoling and perfect and impossibly sincere, the way Steve could.  Tony had somehow just…walked into Steve’s chest and stayed there where it was warm and safe and free of any expectation. Where someone seemed to understand what it felt like to lose everything and have everything you’d planned on taken away from you all at once.
“Shhh, it’s alright, Steve.  You don’t have to say more than you need to,” Tony offered in a gentle tone. “You know it wasn’t real.  You’re safe. You’re safe, and…
“It’s not any of them. And, I don’t mean to be rude because you were real nice about helping and all, but it isn’t any of your business, anyway,” Steve said.
Though, Tony knew Steve well enough from past experience to realize that getting Steve’s back up about something was generally not the way to go about getting anything accomplished.  Immovable object, thy name is Steve Rogers when he’s got his mind set on something, Tony thought with a tinge of reluctant admiration.  He’d loved that about Steve, once, when he’d believed it was directed at finding Tony completely, if somewhat bafflingly, wonderful, this unshakeable certainty that Steve seemed to have about it.  About Tony.
Tony lifted his eyes to Steve’s, feeling them burn. To bright, he thought.  The sun.  It’s too bright.  It wasn’t, he knew, but it felt that way.  Everything that wasn’t dark felt too bright.
“That’s just the fun, happy stuff they put in the papers,” Tony replied, shaking his head.  “I had it all planned out, you know?  My whole life, how it was going to go.  Party, party, sextape, party, graduate, Nobel, party, take over company, party, probably another sextape.  The basics. Now…now, I have absolutely no idea.  I don’t know what I’m doing.  I got mad, got drunk and a little high, and ended up blowing some asshole in the alley behind Machine.  He threw a fifty at me, and I took it, and…I don’t know.  A few weeks later, I stood out back waiting for the club to empty and said, ‘It’ll be fifty’ to some guy in a suit, and then it was just easier to do this than to think about anything.  Shit coping mechanism, I know, but…I was handling it.  School, the lawyers, mom calling crying, I’d go screw some John, forget for a bit, and…I was handling it.  Then you happened,” Tony gritted out, throwing an accusatory hand in the air.
“I’m obsessive about work sometimes.  To the point I can forget about everything else going on.  And everyone.  I’ve been told this is problematic for a relationship,” Tony replied slowly, keeping his eyes on Steve as he watched the smile wobble a bit, then fall off Steve’s face.  He dropped his gaze away from Tony, then raised it back again.
He didn’t go. He looked at Tony, his eyes dropping to the necklace Tony wore, where a sky-blue stone caught the candlelight and seemed to almost flicker to life, the way a nightblossom might open to the moon.
Sometimes, when he closed his eyes, he could see the lines, bright streaks against the back of his eyelids. Sometimes he didn’t, went days without thinking of it, but it was always there, the possibility that he could think of it, lurking, waiting, and he thought that might be worse than actually thinking of it. The deliberate, carefully controlled not thinking about it. It took such effort sometimes, but he couldn’t let it be any other way. He wanted that nowhere near him, nowhere near Tony, as if the thoughts themselves could leach out, spread their taint, and he both loathed giving them that power and couldn’t deny that they held such sway.
For a second, just before his conscious mind shut it down completely, the image of Tony in a place like that came unbidden to his mind. Tony, with his perfectly-tailored suit pants pushed down to his knees, his hips thrusting his cock in and out of some anonymous person’s body, the muscles of his ass clenching as he came. He blinked and squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, banishing the images and the thoughts that went with them. The card was still in his hand.
“Hey, grab all the shampoos and soaps you can for me, will you? Maybe a couple of towels. Need the Rio to complete my set,” Natasha said, her voice teasing and light, and he knew it was more for his benefit than hers.
Steve frowned, something tugging at the edge of his mind when he tried to probe at the memory. The world tilted, curling in on itself, and Steve felt the floor rushing up to meet him, then strong hands grasping at him, holding him up.  A bluish light filled his mind, so blue, like the sky on one of those perfect summer days.  It seemed to expand, taking up all the space inside him, until he was filled with it, this light.  This blue, blue light, blue like the sky, blue like the light in the sky above the mountains. Blue like...he stopped, everything grinding to a halt in his mind. The light seemed to shatter into infinite pieces, splinters piercing deep inside his head.  Blue light. Blue.  Blue everywhere. Around him. In him.
“That one is going in the retailers’ promotional packet,” she laughed.  “You can’t buy this kind of publicity.”
There was a note on the door telling him that Bucky and Clint were at the bar down the street watching the game and that he should come join them for a beer, by which he meant a note saying, “Bar. Come.”  He wasn’t really in the mood though, and instead, made himself a grilled cheese sandwich and switched on the radio long enough to catch the last of the game.  He stripped down to his boxers and stretched out on the sofa, some ratty, plaid thing that Bucky and Clint had picked up off the curb, but it served.  One of the cushions had duct-tape over half of it because Clint swore that stain was dried blood, the result of increasingly horrific possible scenarios whenever you asked Clint about it, and he could feel the smooth tape against the back of his thigh.
The guards exchanged a look, and the younger of them glanced over at Steve with a sort of conspiratorial look.  “It is likely he and General Rhodes are merely rehashing the day,” he said, mouth pursing as he clearly tried to contain a smile.  “I imagine the King has a few, uh.  Words.  For his General.  To remind him of the day’s events, should his memory have faltered.”
Once Steve’s hips stopped bucking, Tony pushed himself up on his knees between Steve’s legs and spread Steve’s knees wide apart.  He wiped his hand down his stomach, coating it in the mess, before wrapping it around both of their cocks and holding them together in his hand, using Steve’s own seed to slicken them as he slid his own cock along Steve’s in his hand.  His thrusts picked up speed, hips pumping and snapping his cock into the circle of his hand where he held Steve’s.
“I know,” Steve said, letting out a soft chuckle, and shooting Brock a deprecating smile.  “I was thinking that,” he stopped, sucking in a breath and rolling his lip between his teeth.  Finally, he looked up at Brock. “I was thinking that maybe I should take Stark up on his offer.  If it’s even a real thing, which it probably isn’t, but if it is...one million dollars, Brock.  I mean, how can we...how can we not at least
“Smokes cigars.  Fancy ones,” Steve said instead.  “Crappy tipper,” he continued, catching the brittle huff of almost-laughter from Tony.  “The thing in Afghanistan.  That’s what you mean.  That was Stane,” Steve continued, moving the subject back to one he instinctively knew Tony wouldn’t linger on, then immediately regretted the impulse.  In the frosted gold metal of the elevator doors, he could see Tony’s distorted reflection shift a bit, head snapping back just a fraction before he caught himself, hands curling into fists in the center of his chest.  It hadn’t even really been a question, because he’d known the truth of it even as he said it, but Steve waited, letting it hang there between them, on the chance that Tony’s answer might actually give some insight.
“They’re…awaiting arrest,” Steve said, drawing back and looking slightly over his shoulder, then down at Tony with the most innocent expression this side of—of unicorn whisperers and baby goats.  Steve held out his hand to Tony, who grabbed it and let Steve heft him up, which, whee, that was fun.  God, he was clearly still drugged. Tony peered around the side of the van, where four other black-clad would-be kidnappers were currently in states of not-being-conscious.  “I was worried,” Steve said with a light shrug.
“You have given me something far more precious,” Tony assured him as they walked out of the circle, hand in hand.  Steve looked back, once, but it was just a circle of stones again, like any number of others, the strange feeling of wrongness seeming to have left him as quickly as it had come.  “But, if would like that I wear a ring, we can have one made. You can even design it,” Tony was saying.
“---I mean by making things worse,” Fury was saying.  Tony peeked around the corner far enough to see Fury with his hands on his hips, pacing back and forth in a small line, while Steve leaned against the wall, looking about as interested in what Fury had to say as Tony usually was.  “Look, Cap, I get it, okay?  I’m not saying what the guy did was on the up and up.”
Steve heard Tony give a harsh, guttural cry, and before he could react, Tony was twisting around and sinking down in one, swift motion, hands twining in Steve’s hair and mouth finding his, nearly knocking Steve backwards with the force of it.  Tony’s tongue raked into Steve’s mouth, swiping deep, hard and insistent.  Steve heard the squeak of Tony’s hand across the mirror, but didn’t register the reason until one of Tony’s hands, slick with his own come, wrapped around Steve’s cock, pumping it in swift, practiced strokes.  Steve hadn’t realized how close he was, because it didn’t take long before his body stiffened, balls tightening as Tony’s hand twisted around his length, thumb tracing the pulsing vein on the underside and wrist flicking in sharp, quick motions around the head.  He shouted his cry of release into Tony’s mouth, spilling himself over Tony’s hand and stomach as his hips jerked spasmodically, riding out the crest of pleasure, body instinctively searching for more as he pumped into Tony’s hand.
“I’ll just have to find some way to suffer through my ignorance,” Steve said, studying the card for Volcanic Eruption with interest. “Here,” Steve said, taking Tony’s hand and bringing it to the curve of his neck. “You’ll crash us into the ocean if I look at you right now.”
“We’re just going to stay here and not talk to anyone,” Steve promised as the elevator dinged and the doors slid open.  “See you for dinner tonight?”
“Arm’s best,” Bucky said, patting his metal prosthetic with a stoic look.  The arm Tony had made him, the bastard. The two boys swallowed audibly, faces draining of color.
Stopping at one of the overstuffed chairs in front of the dark fireplace, Tony leaned on it, or tried to.  His arm promptly slipped off the curved top, and he stumbled forward before righting himself, cheeks going pink.   Steve had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from smiling. Okay, so maybe Tony was a few years off from being The Tony Stark, Steve admitted to himself.  It was kind of…refreshing, in a way, to see him so awkward and self-conscious.
Steve frowned in confusion, then looked down at his hand.  As soon as he did, it started to hurt, though he had forgotten about it until that point.  Tony lifted it up and examined it, then got up and rummaged around in one of the trunks. When he came back, he had a bowl of water, some cloths and a small jar of ointment.  He washed Steve’s hand until the blood was gone and the wounds clean, then applied some of the ointment, which smelled a little like vinegar, and wrapped the wounds in thick, cotton strips.   Tony’s ministrations were strangely soothing, Steve thought, as he watched with a sort of detached interest. Exhaustion seeped into his bones. He blinked up at Tony, who smoothed his hair back once again and nudged him down onto the bed.
“No one does that anymore.  We may be the only people who even remember that being a thing,” Tony said.  “He kept a jar of that in his beat-up hatchback for years on the off chance someone ever stopped him at a light or something and asked if he had any, for the sheer joy it would give him to say, ‘But, of course,’ and drive away,” Tony explained at Barnes’ curious look.
it. A house by the sea, remember? You offered me everything you could give, once. There is nothing more that I want, but it must be everything of you. You’re taking yourself away from me, piece by piece, and I can’t---I don’t know how to make you see that I want those parts, too. You took me as I was, once, broken thing that I was, and loved me for someone I barely recognized, but desperately wanted to be. Please. Please, let me,” Tony moaned against Steve’s lips, but Steve wasn’t sure what it was Tony was asking to do, so he just clung tighter, moving the hand that pressed against Tony’s chest up to slide around and cup the back of Tony’s neck, pulling him closer, letting himself leak out and filling the empty places with what Tony offered so willingly. “Let me love you as you love me,” Tony repeated, voice rough and low, breath hot in the space between them. “Let me show you.”
“You know that isn’t what I meant,” Tony replied, lightly jabbing his finger into Steve’s side in mock rebuke.
“I--what—what???  No—yes---no—this—he was fine!” Tony heard himself nearly shouting, though his voice came out raw and hoarse.  He knew he shouldn’t be yelling, but it was like he was at the end of a tunnel, his voice sounding tinny and hollow.  Everyone was moving too slowly, too calmly, asking questions and making decisions, making this real, and he wanted to tell them to hurry and to do more and to stop and wait because this wasn’t right.  It was all jumbled in his head, and nothing made sense, because they were supposed to have ravioli.  He’d already ordered it.  And dessert. Steve had a sweet tooth.  It wasn’t a date, but—
Brock’s business honestly sounded to Steve a lot like the same kind of set-up as the time his mom’s neighbor, Mrs. Elway, bought fourteen boxes of health supplements that she tried to convince Steve and Bucky to buy some and then resell to their Army buddies, who were then supposed to get other people to sell them.
“Of course, of course,” Stane said, walking over to shake Sousa’s hand.  He was so close to the camera then, Steve could see the last vestiges of his hair, soft, graying wisps he had combed over the expanding bald spot on his head.  “How have you been? Still with the Bureau? Keeping at the home movie thing, I see.”
Tony stopped dead at the top of the stairs, looking at Steve with a hard expression that Steve couldn’t place.
“I believe it,” Howard Stark announced, walking over to stand in front of Peggy and tipping a dark, amber-filled bottle into her glass.  “That a new one?” Howard asked, squinting at the camera as he sat down in a chair opposite Peggy.
“See,” Fury started, glancing over his shoulder at Steve, “the thing is, the longer these rumors are out there, the harder it is to find him a mate, and Howard, he’s got a pretty solid idea of what he wants out of this whole Bonding thing.”
Steve’s voice sounded thin and strained.  Wrong.  He pushed the heel of his hand against his forehead and ground it in, then let his arms fall to his sides.
Btw, if you think that Tony's reaction to Steve in the garage was unrealistic, I direct you to the time a guy I liked tried the yawn and stretch move on me and I panicked, ran to the bathroom and hid for 45 minutes, because the horror that he might know I liked him outweighed any desire I had to find out if he liked me.  Ah, dear, young sabrecmc...
“Okay, okay,” Tony began, feeling the excitement start to well up again.  “So, in the first detection set, we had a gravitational-wave transient, GW150914.  Now, if we analyze coherently across the LIGO network using a suite of accurate waveform models that describe gravitational waves from a compact binary system in general relativity, this tells us that GW150914 was produced by a nearly equal mass binary black hole of masses,” Tony explained. “Taking into account that the dimensionless spin magnitude of the more massive black hole is bound to be < 0.7, and figuring the luminosity distance to the source and the corresponding redshift…assuming standard cosmology, of course.”
Tony was definitely not supposed to touch anything that his Dad kept locked away in the safe.  That had been drilled into his head well enough that it actually stuck.
“You don’t need to,” Steve said, and God, that sounded weak and almost pleading even to his own ears.
“I think I told you that you couldn’t afford me,” Tony said by way of greeting when the phone call clicked on.  He forced himself to pause where he held the soldering iron against one of the shoulder joints of the Mark Let’s Not Do Those Numbers. He knew what the phone call was about, or
At this, the man laughed out loud, a booming sound in the quiet of the night.  At first, Steve was horrified that the man was laughing at him, which was always awful when the other children did it, even if he told Bucky he didn’t care what they thought.  After a moment, though, Steve realized he hadn’t heard many men laugh like that, carefree and open, without ribald jest or cruelty behind it, and he stared, mouth agog.
“I don’t miss,” Clint huffed waspishly.  Geez, next time there was an alien invasion, Steve was just holding back the team’s caffeine for a day.  The aliens would give up in no time.
“Of course!  Of course, you’re right.  This is brilliant, Captain, just brilliant!  People will really be able to relate to an everyday person,” and Steve had to stop himself from asking her if she’d actually met Tony Stark, “who becomes a superhero,” she finished, nodding to emphasize her agreement.  Steve smiled in return and then she was just blinking at him. Tony would be rolling his eyes.
“Not well,” Steve affirmed.  “That’s…something of an understatement, but let’s go with that,” he continued with a slight smile that Tony thought was directed inward as much as to Tony. “Tony…look, we’re not always going to agree.  I’ll try to handle it better than I did this morning.  I meant what I said.  About Simpson.  If he’s your guy, then that’s good enough for me.  But…I get mad sometimes.  I say the wrong thing.  I don’t say enough of the right things…I’m trying, though,” Steve told him, voice ebbing with weary frustration.  “I really am trying, Tony.”
Well, obviously, he could, because Stern pushed all his damn buttons and he’d gone off-map at the first exit, much to Pepper’s dismay, but Stern was the link to Pierce, and if this really went that far, then they had to know about it.  It wasn’t just the company at stake, not anymore.  Obie was willing to kill to protect what he was up to.  How far would someone like Pierce go?  Someone with that kind of power wielding it to subvert and destroy exactly what he was supposed to protect…Well, fuck if that didn’t sound familiar, Tony thought, lifting his gaze to the mirror.
“I hated hearing that from you.  I knew it was a line.  Something you’re told to say to clients, so they don’t feel guilty about what they’re doing.  I didn’t want to think of myself that way,” Tony went on.
He walked down the hall, but the billiards room sat empty.  Jarvis had already spirited away the glasses, returned the pool stick to its proper slot on the rack and emptied the ashtray.  Erased, Tony thought.  We do a lot of that around here.
He pressed forward once again and causing Steve’s head to snap back to the ground, and even Tony felt the wave of sensation roll through Steve as he clenched and tightened around Tony.  Turnabout was fair play, Tony supposed.  A moment later, Tony felt the tension from the tip of his cock suddenly release and felt a rush of warmth along his shaft, easing the way for the knot.  Despite that, he heard a sharp gasp from Steve as his whole body shuddered at the feeling of Tony’s knot retracting from deep inside him.  When his body told him it was okay, he slowly pulled out, rocking back to sit on his heels, utterly exhausted.
Cam would be worrying himself, no doubt. He hoped Tony said something to the boy to put his mind at ease. Oh, Steve knew he would be punished somehow, but he didn’t want Cam to think… Tony wouldn’t, not really, not a
Steve dropped his gaze and bowed his head slightly, and it was the most beautiful and terrifying thing Tony had ever seen. Tony wrapped one hand around the base of Steve’s neck, massaging his thumb over the mark he’d left earlier. He felt a tremor shake through Steve’s body and placed a long kiss to the top of his head. “Not that, as an Alpha, I don’t appreciate the gesture, it’s fantastic and all, but I do miss seeing you look at me,” Tony urged.
“This morning, my favorite general stopped by, probably to play with his toys, spent five minutes staring at this, then started mumbling incoherently and shouting words that made even my ears burn and now, he wants to call a war council to redistribute our forces accordingly,” the King told him, sounding not so much angered by the development as bemused.  “So.  I’m going to require a bit more of an explanation than, ‘I put them where they go.’”
“Stop that,” Tony tried, hoping he sounded sufficiently discouraging.  “Does anyone have like a wipe or, I don’t know, a hose?”

“Yes.  No.  Sort of?” Bruce replied, scrunching up his face.  “The BARF stuff, it used to, you know, project the altered memories onto a sort of digital infrastructure, but you kind of need a—well, a whole lot of sophisticated pieces to make that work, okay?  So, he’s been tinkering with it, apparently.  Upgrading.  All that nanotech stuff, I guess, though I don’t know why he—”
“I know the wheels are too thin,” the King snapped just over sixty heartbeats later, because Steve had been counting.  The King sighed.  Dropped his quill and leaned back in his seat.  He crossed his arms over his chest and looked at Steve with a blazing sort of intensity, as if he had just suddenly realized Steve was there.  “So, tell me. Soldier. Why are the wheels too thin?”
He was going to have to choose, but there was a weight on his neck, and his hand was empty, and he thought he already had.  Soldiers are the shield for those who cannot raise a sword, he thought grimly, remembering Phillips’ words.
Steve hummed, a contented sound that Tony wondered if he knew he was making.  Tony smiled a bit at the noise, a fissure of pleasure ghosting down his spine, and curled his toes into the sheet underneath Steve’s leg.
Did you…was this…you aren’t serious.  You didn’t.  Because of what I—that was stupid!  I told you!  I was being an idiot, for crying out loud,
Steve let out a long, low moan against Tony’s mouth. God, that felt good. He always liked that when he touched himself, but someone else doing it was far, far better. A jolt of hot pleasure singed a line of fire down to the head of his cock.  Tony gave Steve’s nipple a slight squeeze, not too hard, but hard
“I remember you.  From when you were young,” Fury told him.  “Always thought Howard didn’t know what he had.  Guess maybe that wasn’t quite the case.”
He showered, shaved and spent far too much time trying to get his hair just right.  He was standing in front of the dresser mirror picking a piece of lint off his sleeve when Bucky came into their room, stopped for a moment, the let out a long, low whistle.
The door to the garage was closed and, presumably, locked, which seemed to give Tony some comfort. For a lot of reasons, Steve saw no reason to inform him that the gesture was useless.  He knocked lightly and glanced up at the security camera hovering above the door. That was new.  He tried to fix his face into a smile.  It felt like trying to put on a mask that didn’t quite fit right, but he tried, fairly sure he was probably not managing to pull it off.
“Beautiful and perfect, so damned perfect, Steve. Please believe me. Please. Please let me. Let me love you. Let me love you as you are, as you love me. You have no idea what I see when I look at you. I see everything. Everything, Steve. Please, Steve, you are everything. Please let me,” Tony pleaded, his mouth grinding hard enough into Steve’s back that Steve could feel the scrape of teeth and a dampness where Tony’s cheek pressed against the expanse of Steve’s back. The hand that had been rubbing lightly across the skin turning grasping, digging into the skin as if Tony could pull something out of him, and maybe he could.
Careful searches on the computer led to the discovery that he had full Internet access and his bank card worked just fine on anything he wanted to order.  He bought something called “How to Please Your Alpha:  An Omega’s Guide to Happiness,” and then, when that went off without a hitch, “Your Omega Body,” which said it was restricted and required an Alpha passcode to order, but the confirmation popped up on his screen as soon as he entered the bank card number.  Steve had apparently let the computer remember  his Alpha passcode for ease of ordering, bless his trusting soul.  The book arrived two days later in a manila envelope. Tony tossed that aside and promptly downloaded as many electrical and mechanical engineering texts as the computer could handle.
“I guess,” Steve said with a shrug.  “It’s okay.  They’re pretty good about hiring veterans.  Sam found it for me.”
It took Tony a second to realize that Steve was trying to find a story to share with Tony like he used to.  No well-dressed, musical-loving bird in a supply closet, but Steve was trying, which sent a burst of warm, eager hopefulness pooling low in Tony’s stomach.
Standing in front of his closet, filled with a shaded gradient from black to cream, Tony waited for the suit that screamed I Am Totally Unaffected By This to jump out at him.  When it didn’t, he sighed and reached out and grabbed the first one that his hand hit, a dark, steel gray, and dressed quickly, since Rhodey was probably waiting.
“Maybe a lack of perfect information is part of the risk,” Steve shot back, then let out a puff of air through his nose.  “Come on, Tony, do you honestly think I don’t know what someone trying to take advantage of me feels like?  This isn’t it, okay?  Trust me.”
Brock stretched his arms over his head, popping his back, and took his drink when the waitress returned with it, taking a long sip and smacking his lips a bit at the taste.  “How about we head over to the Grand? Try a few slots, maybe some cards…I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling lucky.”
to be good enough, were they?” he asked with a note of self-recrimination lacing his voice, though it was old, Steve recognized.
“I threw up on him, and he put me in a decontamination shower in the Chem lab,” Tony recalled with a twist of his mouth.  “Your basic love at first sight thing.  Or, I fell in love with him, anyway.  He…he fell in love with my dad’s bank account, as it turned out.  Got paid for his time and left.  I learned a very valuable lesson, or so Howard liked to remind me from time to time.  That’s it.  End of story,” Tony finished with a shrug, aiming for nonchalance and missing by a mile based on Pepper’s sharp look.
“You know my father, too?” Steve asked, his voice wavering.  Truth be told, everyone in town knew his father, and most didn’t exactly hold a high opinion of him, and by virtue of being his son, of Steve, and it stung, sharp and biting deep inside, to think that this man might think that, too, though he didn’t rightly see why it mattered.
“I love you, too, Tony,” Steve said, voice warm and thrumming around Tony as he stepped around the counter and pulled him closer.
“Okay, that…that came out wrong.  Not—not busy, just,” Tony stammered.  “I was…he knew—he. Obie knew how to get me to not pay attention, alright?  The shiny, new thing over there, and I—I signed a lot of things, okay? He’s the fucking CFO, for Christ’s sake, how was I supposed to know—”
Something about the way he said it didn’t particularly inspire confidence that it wasn’t going to end up in the nearest trash can, but there wasn’t much of a choice.  If he just mailed it, it was probably less likely to actually make it to Tony.  Someone like him probably got tons of actual fan mail.  And weird people leaving proposals, suggestions, threats, and all kinds of things for him at the front desk, Steve thought with a sigh.  Of course there was a system.
“Yours,” Tony managed to choke out.  The back of his throat closed off, and he had to work to swallow, had to remind himself to breathe, all he could seem to think about was how full he was, how stretched out and filled up he was, how amazing it was that he could do this, take that big, beautiful cock all the way into his body like it was made just for that one, singular task.  A heady rush of power and desire buzzed through his head and down his spine, settling low and warm in his belly as Steve drew back, catching the head of his cock on Tony’s rim a bit, teasing, almost, then rammed back in hard enough to make Tony’s teeth clack together.
“I should shave you,” Tony murmured, tongue tracing the line of Steve’s rib before he bit down, making Steve’s body jerk and a startled cry escape, partly from Tony’s teeth and partly from his words.  Tony looked up at him over the flat of Steve’s stomach and grinned, then released his mouth and hummed.  “I like this,” he continued, tracing his fingers lightly back and forth over the thatch of hair.  “You being golden all over. Do not mistake me.  But, I liked you the first night, too, when your pretty cock was set against your bare skin, all smooth and gleaming.  I like you all ways, I think,” he said with a low laugh from the back of his throat.  “You’d have to keep still for me.  So still,” Tony sighed.  “Could you be good for me like that?  I think you could.”
.  Please, tell me how we do this, Steve, because I can’t—I can’t see it,” Tony pleaded, lifting watery eyes to Steve’s blue ones.
A heavily embroidered robe over a fabric so fine Steve could see the skin of his hand through it followed.  An incredibly intricate necklace of crystalized glass flowers that sparkled in the light.  A reddish-brown necklace of topaz beads.  A soft fur cured so well that the underside was like the velvet of a young deer’s antler.   Steve wanted to tell himself he was picking things at random, but each time something stood out, it was his mind saying how much Tony would like to see him in it that warmed his chest.
“What’s got you so excited?  Find some pirate treasure?” Steve asked, tucking the oars up under his arms with a grin.
Tony looked around the empty space, then turned in a circle and started for the door. He really should wait outside. Or just leave. Go back to the Tower and wait for tomorrow’s mail to show up on his desk with divorce papers neatly tucked between the latest invitation to decline and shareholder reports he wouldn’t read. He sat down on the loveseat instead, looking around the apartment, though this time with a slightly different eye. His first impression--small, dingy, poor--was still true enough, but like last night, when it was filled with friends and food, he could see bits of Steve in the crevices.
Steve thought he might have made some kind of high-pitched sound only dogs could hear.  Kirk grinned, tucked his own lip into his mouth and tilted his head back with a knowing smirk that set a wicked gleam in his eye.  He pulled the comforter over with his foot and scooted back off Steve’s lap, sinking to his knees between Steve’s legs and running his hands over Steve’s thighs.  Steve sucked in a stuttered gasp of air, body revving up like an engine being primed.  He can do zero to orgasm in three—point-two seconds, Steve thought wildly, gazing raptly down at Kirk.
Tony hummed contentedly, and blinked up at Steve.  “I am...very, very good,” he slurred, then let Steve gently lower him to the bed and curl around him. He took Steve’s wrist and brought the inside to his mouth.  Steve felt twin needles enter his skin, and then a low, pleasant pull that reached a line of heat down low in his belly, all the way to the end of his cock.  Tony drank for a while, then pushed Steve’s wrist away and sighed, curling closer into Steve.
He could feel the heat of embarrassment spread over his chest and neck, warming the skin.  Tony, however, just sighed, gave Steve a soft smile that made his eyes shine and crinkle at the edges, then reached out to wrap a hand around Steve’s cock as if it was the most natural thing in the world.  Steve’s hips jerked up of their own accord at the light touch, sending his shaft pumping into Tony’s hand.  Dear Lord, it felt amazing.  He bit his lip, tried to remember to breath and forced himself to keep still when all he wanted to do was keep doing exactly that forever.
“Yes,” Tony agreed as neutrally as he could. He wouldn't know, not really. He hadn't had his own space in, let's see...oh, right, ever. But, he imagined it was nice. It must be, since everyone kept taking it away.
He pushed his tongue into the heat of Steve’s mouth, sliding it along the side of Steve’s, flicking the tip, the way Steve had done.  Steve groaned, low and deep, sending a shudder through Tony.  Heat spread through his belly, a rising pressure on its heels.  His hips juddered forward, rocking against Steve.  He could feel the hard length of Steve’s cock against his stomach, making his own pulse with need.  A spurt of wetness coated his backside, dripping down between his legs as his limbs went languid and boneless.
“Tony!  Tony!  Open the door, Tony, please!” Steve shouted, pounding against the glass with his fists.  “Tony, dammit, open the door!”
His nose and mouth were covered by a molded plastic oxygen mask that ran to machine making the pumping noise.  Wires and tubes piped out of him to various machines and bags hung on a metal pole next to the table.  Large twin booms hung from the ceiling with lights on the end, pointing down, illuminating Steve in a strangely soft halo.  The only bright point in the room.  The only bright point, Tony mentally repeated, letting the thought clang around in his head while his mind tried to take in what his eyes were seeing.
“I’m a soldier.  What else would I do other than this?” Steve asked with a huff of laughter, meaning it rhetorically, but it came out like more a plea.
“The conductive coupling’s a nightmare.  I think it’s the temperature drift at that altitude,” Tony said.
“Good. Thanks. That’s—good,” Steve said.  “Sorry,” he sighed, wiping a hand across his mouth.  “I know you didn’t, it’s just—this is important, Buck.”
“Well, I’m a romantic guy,” Brock smiled, eyes glazing over as he watched the news switch over to a story about a new baby giraffe at the zoo.  “But
“You’ve just described any of over a hundred possibilities in the downtown area alone,” the investigator snapped in annoyance.
“You’re beautiful,” Steve said. Immediately, his cheeks felt like they were on fire, and he glanced down, feeling suddenly exposed.  He liked giving compliments, it just always seemed like he picked the wrong ones, even if he didn’t mean it the way it sounded.  “I mean, you’re not--well, you
Well, dear husband, you have come to the right place, Tony thought, mentally cracking his knuckles as he pulled out his phone and started typing out long lines of code.  This. This one thing.  This, he could fix.
Having Steve by his side…it smoothed away all the hard edges.  They weren’t gone, of course. The hard things were still there.  Afghanistan. Obie. His panic attacks and nightmares. His workshop full of apologies.  Everything was still there. But, they didn’t seem as insurmountable as they had just a few days ago, and that was down to Steve, no way around it.  He could go back to how things were before if he had to, but, God, he didn’t want to. He wanted this, with Steve, where it was smoother, easier, just a little easier, but enough.
Steve threaded his fingers through Tony’s, squeezing tightly. Tony looked over at him, eyes swimming with softness, and Steve knew he understood.
He didn’t want this burden.  He didn’t want any of this.  He should’ve died when the Valkyrie sank with its hellacious cargo.  He had never planned on being found, on shouldering someone else’s life again.  He wanted to run, strike out, something—something that would end it, finally, even if it was a terrible end.  He could handle that.  The dying.  He was getting good at it, he supposed. But, if he did that, he doomed the boy to the same fate, and he couldn’t let someone else die for him.  Not again.
“Well, home, sweet, technologically-challenged home,” Tony groused, following Steve up the steps and through the front doors.  Steve stopped long enough to check his mail, which seemed to consist of a flyer for a coupon to a sandwich shop.   “Remember when you double-dog-dared me to hack the Pentagon’s servers?”
“Steeeeev,” Anto repeated, earning an expression of delight from Steve, then tapped his own chest where his own scar marred his flesh, though Steve couldn’t see it.  “Tony.” Steve nodded. Anto pointed at the lion and waited.
“I don’t know what you want me to say,” Brock replied. “I get what you’re saying.  A million dollars, that’s a helluva lot of dough for a night, and it isn’t like he’s asking for a kidney or your firstborn or even some kinky shit, though maybe this is what gets him off, who knows.  I mean...I guess...if you really think it’s what we should do. Because this is totally up to you.  Your call, Cap, okay? I don’t want you to be all, “oh, Brock pressured me,” or some shit the next morning, you know?”
He liked the storms, and was rather glad of the company of the noise rumbling around outside on this night.  Felt like an old friend come to call.  If Lizzie or Willie’s kids were here, they would demand he tell them a story about the Man of the Mountain.  They loved those stories, even Zachariah, the eldest, who insisted it was all a bunch of nonsense. Made the little ones shriek with delight, those stories did, he recalled, with a light chuckle that quickly devolved into a cough.  He sat his tea aside, pulled a rag out and held it to his mouth, his thin body wracking with the force of the cough. His stomach cramped, but there wasn’t anything in there to object to, and finally, the fit subsided, and he pulled the rag away.
“That this would’ve been a lot better if you’d been helping me build it from the get-go,” Steve answered.  “That maybe we should try that instead.”
“Girl,” Bruce announced with a broad smile. “See,” he said, pointing to the screen. “Well, I’ll leave you two for a bit,” Bruce said. Or probably did, Tony wasn’t really paying him any attention, but Bruce pushed the stool back and got up, giving them a quick nod before he walked to the other side of the lab.
Denial, probably, he admitted as the guard stepped out of the booth and approached the Audi.  It might be the only thing keeping him going.  Steve was going to be okay. There just wasn’t any other option, so why even bother thinking about any outcome other than that?   No reason to worry about something that wasn’t going to happen.  Nothing was going to happen to Steve.  It couldn’t.  It—no.  Just
“So.  Who is going to win?” Peggy asked, placing her hand over Tony’s where it held the figure.  Steve watched the movements of the figure slow, and finally, finally, Tony head lifted up enough to catch Peggy’s eyes.  He shrugged, then looked down again.
Finally, the pain in his chest waned to twin, dull aches. “Better?” Tony asked, and Steve managed a jerky nod.
“Hey Rhodey,” Tony mumbled from the hollow of Steve’s neck when a shadow fell across the sand next to where he huddled against Steve’s body.
Tony’s hands worked the zippers and buckles on Steve’s training uniform probably faster than even he could have.  Perks of designing it, he assumed, then felt an odd mix of want and a strange, chagrined sort of pleasure at the idea of Tony making this for him and thinking about safety and utility and how to get it off him in the most efficient way possible.  A moment later, he felt cool air wisp over his heated skin, and he dipped his shoulders enough for Tony to shrug the uniform off him and push it down, past his waist, letting his fingers follow the rough material over Steve’s body until they gripped Steve’s hips where the bone carved out against the taut skin there.  He could feel Tony tracing the line of it, from the curve of his waist, slanting down towards where Steve’s cock jutted out between them.
Steve eyes dropped to Hammers’ lap, and he felt a wild surge of hysterical laughter threaten to spill over.  He was not going to laugh.  Was
“Um...excuse me?” Tony blurted out, a whiplash of bright, white pain lancing across his chest. He swiveled back around to watch Rhodey lean against the desk next to where Tony sat, arms crossing over his chest. “That's not—no. That's not possible.”
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed going over the preliminary designs for an upgraded guidance system before he heard a knock on the door.  The security camera showed it was, of course, Steve, holding a brown paper bag and a Styrofoam container that Tony’s mind instantly categorized as food, making his stomach rise to the occasion with an empty groan.
“I—yes,” Steve replied, though he honestly couldn’t remember if Zola had said any such thing.  It seemed the answer the King expected to hear though, because he let out a small huff of laughter.
“I—I guess,” Tony mumbled, glancing over at one of the pictures lining the wall.  This one had a bucolic scene involving an old wagon wheel leaning against a stump with a large oak tree in the background dripping bright orange and yellow leaves under an entirely out of proportion sun.  He should really frame some of Steve’s drawings and hang them up.  Even Steve’s creepy nightmare paintings might be better than the ode to Duck Dynasty theme this place had going on.  “It’s all just a movie, though.  I mean…this is theoretical, right?   I guess, maybe the H-bomb is kind of the metaphor, huh?”
“Little pressure tactic,” Tony said.  “I get it. Soldiers wanting something, anything that will help, clamoring to their Senators and representatives.  Looks bad not to help wounded vets.  Lots of pressure coming from Congress, it greases the wheels, right? It’s just business.”
“No,” Steve said, putting his hands on his hips and trying to look anywhere but at his best friend, who was, even Steve had to admit, not entirely wrong.  He just wasn’t sure if Bucky was entirely right either, and it was the space between those two things that was driving him crazy.  What had started out as sex for money had turned into, well, sex for money, but with some sort of strange almost-friendship thing forming between him and Tony over the past month or so he’d been making his regular visits to Tony’s house.
him, just some fuzzy image that wouldn’t quite coalesce.  He shook his head to clear it, then turned back to face Jarvis, crossing his arms over his chest as he did.  “I mean.  Look around you.  I’ve got everything I could possibly want,” Tony finished in a flat, listless tone.
“I’m not…I’m not saying you did everything right, Tony.   You didn’t hear the question he was asking, true, and I think you should seriously think about why that is, but everything you did, Tony…everything you did for him was an answer,” Pepper said, her voice going soft, one hand reaching out to rub at his arm.  “You’re already more than half way there.  You like Steve.  Steve likes—or liked--you.  Those feelings don’t just disappear over a bag of takeout, Tony,” she continued, so sure that he could almost believe it, though he was fairly certain that was desperation trying to convince him she was right.  “Maybe he doesn’t remember he cares about you, but he’s the same person, give or take a few years.  Whatever it is in him that made him fall in love with you in the first place, it’s still there, somewhere.  You just have to find it again.”
Oh.  Well, who knew?  That explained a lot, actually.  Happiness.  Of course.  Made complete sense.  He should have realized.  It was obvious, after all.
Steve stared down at Tony for a beat, then leaned his head down and kissed him. Lightly.  Softly. With just the barest touch of his lips.  He felt Tony sigh against his mouth, then join the kiss, hardening his mouth against Steve’s with a surge of almost desperation, until he pulled away slightly, giving Steve a narrow look.
“And now, I’ve seen all of them, except the Holiday Special, which you insist does not exist, despite what the Internet says,” Steve said drolly.  “Tony’s been getting me caught up to speed on some things that I…sort of missed over the years.”
“The list of people who put me first is pretty short, so if you think I’m going to just pretend you’re not on it, you’ve got another thing coming,” Tony replied tightly, then let out a breath.  “I’m not—I told you, this isn’t guilt. This is…okay, fine, there’s some guilt.  You win. Happy?  But, it isn’t just guilt, it’s…can I like doing things for you?  Why am I worrying about this?  You like the thing.  Hell, you
“Ah, some--well, I mean it isn’t uncommon, even these days.  Some Alphas still want, ah, confirmation, so,” Coulson replied, sounding wildly uncomfortable. Well.  At least Tony knew what would make the man’s composure falter.  Good to know.   “Tony, that’s not what Captain Rogers—“
“Eat,” Steve said, nodding at the sandwich as Tony sat down with his back to the tree trunk.  Tony took a bite, earning an approving smile from Steve.  “So…”
There’s always a choice.  Wasn’t that what he told General Fury?  We only tell ourselves there isn’t to excuse what we’ve already chosen.  Was that true here, too?  He didn’t know.  Cam didn’t have a choice.  So many others here didn’t, either.   He just wasn’t sure if he was one of them.
He drank down a long swallow.  And then promptly started choking.  Smooth.  Outstanding.  The guy was clapping him on the back as he coughed and sputtered.
“No—no, you’re right.  You are.  God, I mean, I want it to all be Howard’s fault, because I can just keep on hating him and leave the side of self-loathing out of it, but—okay. Okay, look, so…,” Tony stopped and cleared his throat.  “I haven’t thought about kids.  I’m…open to it.  I’m selfish enough to want you to myself for a while, but…kids.  Not hating the thought.”
“Well...yeah, I guess--you know, forget it.  So, this mind-meld thing, how long is that going to go on here, Spock?” Tony asked.
“I—yes.  I draw.  Some.  I’m not—it’s just a pastime.  Nothing more,” Steve rushed out.  He could feel embarrassment heat his face, but there was little he could do to hide it.
“How many times you look at that ugly muppet in the drawer in your workshop in the last twenty-four hours?” Rhodey asked, forehead creasing in speculation.
“And that was Bucky’s,” he said, pointing to the nearby hunks of ashen dirt and debris. “Mom used to hate it when we’d yell back and forth,” Steve remembered.  “Said we should have a proper, civilized conversation instead of acting like a couple a’pirates, but she knew we loved hearing that.  Made us want to do it more.  I think she thought it was good for my lungs or something.  Or maybe she was just glad I had someone.  Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.”
“Too early to get maudlin, eh?” Steve guessed.  “I’m Irish, ye wee fish. Maudlin’s in our blood,” he said, letting the accent he tried so hard to get rid of slip in.  Shellhead’s eyes went almost comically wide, making Steve laugh and slap a hand atop his thigh with a whoop of delight at Shellhead’s expression.  “Ma made sure I could talk without it. Said I’d never amount to anything, if I couldn’t speak proper English. ‘No one’s gonna hire you if you sound like you fell off the boat yesterday, Stevie,’ that’s what she’d say.  I can speak the Gaeilge, too,” Steve said. “They banned it in the schools, but I taught Bucky some anyway. We said it was our secret language.”
I made dinner, mom, Tony thought to himself, eyes going to the rather forlorn looking attempt at apology cuisine. He'd dressed with care, too, to please and distract and whatever it was that how he looked was supposed to mean that he didn't want to think about. Done his hair, or made the attempt, anyway, though flyaway curls kept wanting to escape even though he'd used enough mousse to plaster Sasquatch into a shellacked primadonna. Fixed his eyes the way his mom said they looked best, smokey and doe-eyed at the corners, set off by a touch of mascara. Not too much. They don't like too much, you'll look tarty, Tony recalled with a laugh. Too bad MAC didn't make an I Fucked Up Grey. That'd be a bestseller, Tony thought with a flat nothingness.
“’Course we’re good here, Tony, come on, man.  You know I got your back,” Rhodey responded immediately.  “Call me tomorrow, okay?”
It still rankled.  It had taken forever to get that damn goatee going, Tony thought with a exaggerated sigh that everyone in the limo ignored.
“The night you met Cam, Zola sent me to serve Lord Hammer,” Steve said, his eyes boring into Tony’s.
“Fine, fine, throw some rabbit food on there for Spangles here, J,” Tony grumbled, but he did it, so Steve took that as a win.  Tony could be oddly solicitous at times.
“You—you didn’t—“ Steve started, breaking away from Tony’s mouth and feeling the familiar warmth of a blush creep up his neck as he carefully slid out of the tight sheath of Tony’s body.
“Was there some confusion on which big, ugly Tower you belonged in?” Tony questioned sharply, as Steve stood there somewhat numbly, passing his balled-up dress jacket back and forth in his hands, suddenly nervous under the stares of everyone at the table, though he couldn’t quite say why, other than the scrutiny itself was unnerving, particularly on the heels of Tony’s accusations. He knew it was a different time, and consenting adults and all that, as Clint had taken great pains and rather frank detail to explain.  But that didn’t mean he felt comfortable with the idea that everyone thought that he’d been…doing that.
“People are not so very different. Here or in your Free States, I think,” Tony said, tossing something of a challenging look to Steve.  “They seek the same things. Security. Comfort. Love. Is that not right, Bruce? You’ve travelled the world more than most. What say you?”
He cleared his throat again, suddenly wishing for a drink.  Tony was bouncing a little on the end of the bed, blinking fast, mouth slightly parted, all energy and motion that he was trying to contain.  Steve hadn’t exactly dressed with this in mind, but, well. He figured he could make it work, and Tony was…highly enthusiastic, was one way of putting it, so that helped.
Shellhead had nodded and reached up to brush the hair back from Steve’s forehead, not quite catching Steve’s eye, but his gaze had roved over Steve’s face with an almost covetous look, like he was trying to memorize whatever he saw there in the shadows.
“They’re on the desk,” Tony said, turning his head and nodding down at the large desk strewn with papers.
