“Is everything alright?” Pepper asked frantically. It wasn’t everyday that Tony called in a day off, in fact he could count with one hand the number of times he had missed a day since he graduated and started working.
His family could definitely be a little weird and exhausting at times but there wasn’t a thing he would change about them.
“Mmh yeah, I got a call a few hours ago that he had passed and I inherited his place,” Tony tried to say casually, but he was pretty sure Pepper knew him enough to know that it was a mask and he wasn’t that calm underneath.
“You could say that,” Tony said, swallowing his last bite. “The pancakes were delicious, thank you.”
“Here you go,” Tony said while giving his ID. “Do you know any place that would be open right now where I could grab a bite?” It had been hours since he had last eaten and  airline food was still trash, even in first class.
Two and a half hours later, the plane finally landed and Tony made his way to the rental car office. If he was spending a night in this place he was at least going to be able to drive himself.
“Want to help give birth to Cutie Boots?” the man asked once he had crouched next to the heaving goat. “I promise I’ll make you do the less traumatic parts,” the man looked Tony over before sending a brief smirk Tony’s way.
The following week could have been called the best in Tony’s life. Definitely not Pepper’s though, she had berated Tony so many times for being on the phone with Steve when he should’ve been working, she probably lost count at some point.
When he had looked up Jarvis years after he had left home and was able to look back at what was once his life without feeling a pang of pain in his chest, he had expected to find them in a place like Hungary, since that was Ana’s home country. But to find them in a small town in Illinois of all places, had Tony shocked.
The song isn't exactly one for slow dancing so Tony starts by just kinda moving around. It's silly and he would be embarrassed if it were anyone else but Steve. Steve just stands there looking at him until Tony grabs his arms and makes Steve move with him. Soon Steve is loosening up and moving along with Tony. They start jumping around each other and by the end, they are breathless from laughing at each other.
“Are you sure you won’t finish on time,” Steve said sadly over the phone. “It’s our anniversary,” he finished and Tony could so clearly picture the pout on his face.
It wouldn’t do him any harm to just check the damn thing, he thought .A few minutes wouldn’t make him miss his flight. Tony made his way to the red  barn, the door gave  a squeak as Tony pushed past it.
in front of the blond, blue eyed man before him) “I’m Tony by the way and you may want to start by telling me what you think you are doing inside Jarvis’ barn.”
“Alright then, let me go change and I'll meet you there,” Steve said hurriedly while making his way out of the barn.
“Wow, you sure were hungry.” A voice startled him, making him look up to see a man, Clint from what his name tag read, on the other side of the counter.
“Mmm,” Tony muttered to himself. “What about… Jarvis, he would've had a ball knowing there is a goat named after him,” he wasn't sure where the idea had come from, but it felt right.
“This is it.” Tony muttered to himself with a sigh once he had parked in front of the courthouse. He took a few minutes to balance himself before exiting the car and making a beeline for the entrance.
15 minutes later Tony was sat at the booth of the diner and he felt, strangely, like he was waiting for his date to show up (which made no sense
They said their goodbyes to Nat before starting their walk to Steve’s house. He had insisted that if Tony wanted to enjoy the town he had to do so by walking and not just go through it with a car.
“Come on, let’s introduce you to the wonders of 21st-century music,” It takes Steve a few moments to process the statement, in which Tony starts to doubt whether he made a mistake and crossed a line.
“I’ll have blueberry pancakes, Natasha,” he finished saying once he had read the nametag she had on her apron. This was probably the Natasha Bruce had told him about.
“Does it really matter either way?” Steve said while gazing up to look  Tony in the eyes, like it was really that simple.
Steve had a hunch he would be the one who would have to feed the pet and take them out but he also didn't want to say no, they were good kids and he was sure they would try their best.
While it was true that Tony hadn't been with anyone for a while, it was no excuse to hit on this wonderful guy he had just met and definitely wanted something with besides a nice fuck (which he
“I’ve never seen you around here before, are you just passing through?” The man asked. It was obvious that the diner was well known around the town and everybody frequented.
Living at the Compound with everyone when before it was only him was a good change, suddenly the mornings stopped being cold and the nights lonely.
After having cut a banana into small pieces Steve turned only to be met with three pairs of equally pleading eyes.
Another case won, Tony thought to himself as he descended the stairs of the court on his way to his car. He had been practicing for over 15 years and every time he won a case he still got the same giddy feeling of having accomplished his job. Not that going against someone like Justin Hammer was anything of a challenge.
After some seconds where it looked like they were deciding who would be the one to speak, Harley spoke up.
Even Tony could admit that neither of them wanted to undo the embrace, so they stayed like that for what felt like hours until their teammates came to them celebrating the success.
“The band playing, it looked like you knew the lyrics,” Tony says as he busies himself with some wire at the workbench.
And of course, out of the few people, FRIDAY allows inside without request, it has to be Steve. Sweet and kind Steve.
And with that Steve was left alone with Morgan once again until a pair of arms hugged him from behind.
“Well, if those super-advanced glasses ever made can take a break, how about you join us for dinner?” Steve asks while grabbing a bench beside Tony and sitting on it.
“I mean you could come to my place after we finish here,” Steve said so casually that Tony almost choked.
“I’m not really his son, I’m not his blood,” Tony quickly corrected, though he had always thought Jarvis and Ana were more parents to him than his own ever were.
Tony took his phone out intending to call someone to come help when the sound of the door opening echoed through the barn. In came running a man with his hands full of blankets. The man did a brief pause once he spotted Tony crouched next to the animal but quickly recovered and went straight to the goat in need.
That was one thing Tony would forever be grateful about, Jarvis died surrounded by people who love him. According to Clint, Jarvis was good friends with everyone and had also managed a barn next to his place that kept him occupied. Just from what both of them had described to him, Tony was actually excited to visit the place, which was now his, and make plans to keep it functioning.
Tony had opened the door to his car when he felt the phone in his pocket vibrate. There were only two people he cared about and one of them was overseas fighting a war so it probably left Pepper, his assistant.
The place actually worked for them and they all started to make their lives here. Clint took care of the diner alongside Nat while Bucky and Sam became the mechanics of the town. The quiet community worked well for them, and they had all been here ever since.
The inevitable happened and after all the celebrations, Steve wanted to talk and God did they talk. It was a really nice afternoon at the balcony of the Compound, totally perfect for some heart-to-heart talk.
Tony took that as permission to lean closer. They were so close that Tony could feel Steve’s breath on his face. After a second Steve closed his eyes and Tony leaned in and kissed his cheek. At that, Steve let out a soft gasp and Tony lingered there for a few seconds.
It's just a light press of lips but it takes Tony’s breath away, by the gasp from Steve he guesses the same for him.
Tony was more than surprised about what Clint had said, he had never expected Jarvis to talk about him and less in such a fond way, if the way Clint greeted him was anything to go by. Just thinking about the way Jarvis never seemed to forget about him, despite the fact that Tony never made an effort to contact him, made his eyes sting and his chest ache.
“I will!” Steve interrupted with enthusiasm, which he quickly covered by ducking his head and blushing. “I mean I- I come everyday already so it wouldn't be a problem.”
“Objection!” Justin Hammer could be heard saying loudly from the other side of the court. “The defendant’s history as Director of the Office of Management and Budget is not relevant.”
Tony is more than sure that the last thing he will see on his mind the moment he dies will be the smile Steve gave him after breaking the embrace. Messy hair and wide eyes Steve just gave him the most pleased, relieved, and warm smile someone had ever given him.
Up until this moment he still doesn’t know who moved first, but all of the sudden the two of them were wrapping their arms around the other, right in the middle of the battlefield in Wakanda, as if trying to prove that it was real and they had won.
He’s halfway in implementing a super sensitive circuit board when the doors for the workshop open and someone steps in.
It was now obvious they had gone to him on purpose, he could admit he was the more easy-going parent. Steve would complain about him giving them too much leeway and spoiling them, but those were children and if he could he would give them the world.
Before Tony can start to apologize and throw some jokes to forget about what happened Steve answers by standing up and taking Tony’s hand in his.
The second half was the one he was most excited about, he couldn’t wait to tell Steve that he was officially going to move full time with him. He had been fixing everything for the past few months so that he could work fully from home and only have to fly to New York for trials.
Steve and Tony texted everyday for the whole week and Tony fell even more deeply in love with Steve if possible. They talked about everything and nothing and Tony had never been more impatient for the weekend to arrive.
“No, but I appreciate the offer. I’ll just go sign the paperwork and make my way back.” “Alright, please know that you can call me for anything. Stay safe Tony,” Pepper said, and Tony almost wanted to tell her to come with him, but he knew that if he wanted closure of some kind he had to do this alone.
“Can’t you send the documents and I'll send them signed?” Tony asked, the last thing he wanted was to go on a 3 hour flight to a place that would only bring him bad memories. He had stopped keeping tabs on what was happening in Illinois after Ana’s death. There was nothing for him there.
“Next Saturday, I’ll take you somewhere nice,” Tony said, he wanted enough time to plan something special.
“I truly doubt that, but guess we’ll just have to wait until I see one of your paintings for me to make a verdict.”
By the time he arrived downtown it was 11 at night. He doubted many things would be open this late so Tony drove to what appeared to be an old and rusty motel.
"If it were up to me I'd say yes," Tony said which immediately prompted the kids to get excited, "but you know who has the final word."
Thirty minutes and a lot of blood later, they had successfully delivered the cutest baby goat Tony had ever seen; it was full black with a white spot in the middle. Tony knew it was impossible but he would have liked to take the baby goat back to New York with him to raise it.
After taking a shower and dressing  in the grey Tom Ford he had packed, Tony started picking up the few things he had left laying around. Once he had closed his bag Tony realized that the good mood he had gone to bed with was now gone and he had been left with a deep sense of dread.
He was sure Steve would agree once he saw how passionate they were about getting a pet. They had been putting it off in the past because they were still too young but now that was no excuse. In some months Harley was going to be ten and the others were not staying far behind, Peter being seven and Mary four. He'd say he missed them being smaller but they had Morgan with ten months to remind them that the toddler stage was better than the baby stage.
With tears in his eyes Tony left the house, fully intended on leaving Hinsdale and going back to New York 𑁋to his routine𑁋 when from the corner of his eye the barn caught his attention.
"What are you three doing here?" Tony asked once he recovered from the shock. If they were able to bypass FRIDAY, who announced their presence every time they stepped foot in his workshop, he probably should have a nice chat with them about how wrong it was to keep overriding FRIDAY's protocols, though he was sure FRIDAY let them most of the time.
Worry started filling Tony’s mind, he had to do something with them, he couldn’t just leave them here all by themselves. Maybe some neighbor might be willing to take them in.
“I was definitely correct in my previous statement,” Tony said after having taken a second to admire the art. “Steve, these  are fucking amazing.”
After having parked in front of the house Tony found himself hesitantly opening the door with the keys he had been given. Inside, the house was somehow even more domestic. The whole house had dark wooden floors, white walls and it was so well furnished that there was not a doubt in Tony’s mind that this had been Ana’s doing.
After he arrived at the motel he greeted Bruce, who was still at the counter preparing to head out, and went to his room. There he took a shower, brushed his teeth then fell into bed.For the first time in a long time, Tony was actually excited about what awaited him the next day.
As if he had read Tony’s thoughts, Steve chose that moment to show up with his blond hair still wet (he had clearly taken a shower,which was totally normal and not something to fuss over), wearing a blue henley that did wonders to his eyes.
“Well, now I’m reassured,” Tony said dryly. He could admit that he was a city boy through and through but he wasn’t scared to get his hands dirty (
After Tony wraps things up, he glances up at Steve only to find him with a curious face, mouthing at the words from the song still playing in the background.
Hearing his voice for the first time after years of nothing, certainty did wonders to Tony’s infatuation for the man. He really could not pinpoint the moment he realized that not only was he majorly screwed up, but also that he was completely sure it could be the worst possible situation someone had fallen in love within the entire history of humanity.
"We wanted to ask you something," Mary said sweetly once she had rounded the table and climbed into his lap.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said hurriedly, “I truly didn’t mean it like that, it’s just that I have some of my art at home and you said you wanted to see them, but if you changed your mind it’s totally ok, I unders-”
The second he stepped inside, the smell of bacon and pancakes filled his senses.There were a few people sitting at the tables off to the sides, so Tony decided to sit on a stool at the counter.
“Your honor, the state has introduced evidence that suggests that Mr. Walsh's former position is relevant to the case.” Tony answered already expecting Justin to object; the man couldn’t even pretend to be a little competent.
“Everybody knew him, he came around the diner everyday,” Clint said fondly. “Well, let me tell you it’s a pleasure meeting the famous Anthony,” Clint gave him his hand, which Tony gladly shook.
It suddenly hits Tony how young Steve really is and how much he has already lived while not enjoying the little wonders of life. It makes Tony want to give him the world and if he has been reading the past few months of night talks, soft smiles, and warm touches right, Steve might want the same thing.
Since last week, Tony had started working on Peter’s birthday gift, some high-tech glasses for when not being in full suit turn out to be the perfect gift.
Bruce took a few seconds typing before he answered. “You could probably check the diner one block away, Natasha and Clint, the owners, tend to work late until midnight,” Bruce said while giving his ID back. “One night would be 50 dollars.”
“Of course, my name is Bruce and I am the owner. If I could just see your ID, I’ll register you right away,” Bruce said politely.
On his way back to the motel, Tony thought about everything Clint and Natasha had told him about Jarvis. At one point Tony thought Jarvis had spent the last years of his life alone, but now he knew how wrong he was, and he could not be happier about what he had discovered. Just from Clint and Natasha’s tone, Tony could tell how much Jarvis was loved.
"I expect you to be responsible and not just forget about them once you grow bored, we'll go looking at shelters tomorrow."
Tony was not ignorant to how his life revolved around his job and nothing else. He had no friends 𑁋besides Rhodey or Pepper𑁋 or personal life. He woke up only to do his job and as Rhodey and Pepper had been telling him for years, maybe that wasn’t the healthiest of lives.
After Bruce came to Earth bringing the news of Thanos, Tony didn’t doubt it, and immediately (meaning after hours of thoughts and second-guesses) he called Steve.
Tony had learned that Steve had been a soldier once who had been discharged along with Clint and his two best friends, Sam and Bucky. After coming back they had trouble reintegrating into such a loud city like New York, where they were all from. With the help of Clint’s friend Natasha, they moved to Hinsdale, for a fresh start.
"Fine," Steve said, prompting the three children to jump in delight, making Morgan giggle around a mouthful of bananas.
He felt bad for lying to Steve, but Tony had planned to surprise him by arriving earlier and taking him on a road trip for their anniversary and if he didn’t want Steve to suspect a thing he had to surprise him.
Tony isn't exactly sure why he does what he does next, maybe it’s the easy ambient or the way Steve is looking at him. Determined, Tony stands up, walks to where Steve is sitting, and offers his hand.
The whole walk Steve talked about the places they were passing and by his tone while he talked about everyone that lived here Tony could tell that he loved this town.
“I met them last night, they seemed like good people,” Tony said, actually meaning it. Both Clint and Nat had treated him like a friend despite having just met.
"And what would that be?" Tony asked suspiciously, brushing a stray of her blond hair behind her ear. They only ever teamed up when they wanted to gain forces to get whatever it was they wanted.
If someone would have told Tony that they were going to be able to save the entire universe just by fighting together he would have laughed at their faces.
Looking at how the street lights illuminated the city with a soft glow now, Tony could admit that he understood the feeling of wanting to stay here, where everything seemed to go in slow motion compared to the big city Tony was used to.
“I am sixteen years old and I am about to bury my fourth parental figure. I died trying to save the world before I had even told the girl I like that I have a crush on her. Fuck you you’re fucking tired.” He started whaling on Steve’s chest again, but Peter’s strength was finally giving out, and he forgot to tuck his thumb properly on one of the blows. His thumb broke with an audible crack and Peter howled, collapsing onto the floor. “Agh god. Ow ow ow ow—no don’t you fucking touch me.”
“Book it, JARVIS.” Tony would start how he meant to go on, damn it, and he wasn’t going to Coulson as a friend, or a fake-submissive or any of that.
Telling them about the Howard of his own world and his use of the Soul Stone to bring Tony into existence went way more smoothly than Tony had anticipated. They weren’t mad, they didn’t recoil or look at him with pity. They had reactions and questions of course, most of which were so suited to their personalities that he could have hugged them all in dizzy relief. Thor, probably the most familiar with the infinity stones out of everyone there, deemed him “a soul worthy of the cosmos.” Clint added that the universe “fucking owed Tony one,” then proceeded to ask what else his “upgraded Soul XP” was good for. Natasha, who out of all of them probably had the most warning that something like this was coming, simply thanked him again for what he’d done for her other self, then called the other Nat some Russian slur that Tony chose not to ask for a translation of. Coulson thanked him too, not for what he’d done for the other Natasha, but for telling them. (Someone said something then about some file of Coulson’s, which didn’t make sense, and the rest seemed in a great hurry to move on from that topic after it came up.)  Bruce and Tony got into a brief discussion about the potential science of the whole thing, which was abruptly shut down when Bucky pressed a heated kiss to Bruce’s lips, then pointed at Tony.
The reality of that truth just hit Peter harder the longer he let himself think about it, until soon there were tears mixed in with the vomit and snot. Given that he’d gotten his start in the superhero business through a radioactive spider bite he had sort of assumed he would never again manage to hit his ceiling for gross-out material, but this was definitely coming close.
Everyone but Peter laughs. He’d like to think it’s more nervous laughter because he feels a little sick and vaguely like he should be offended by it at all.
He turned his eyes from the screen as the footage rewound and started to play again, focusing his attention instead on Steve. His partner’s eyes never left the image in front of him, not even when Phil sat down and put a hand against his thigh. Phil wasn’t entirely confident Steve realized he was there at all until he spoke.
“That’d be really nice sweetheart. You’re so thoughtful, aren’t you?” Tony squirmed, praise working the way it always did when he was down far enough to accept it. His hands sank lower, one hand cupping his cock for the first time. It didn’t hurt, which a part of him had honestly expected after how intense the scene with Phil, Thor, and Clint had been, but his body was definitely expressing its interest in the proceedings slowly. Thinking of Steve, he tightened his grip, trying to force his dick to get with the program already. His Dominant’s hand encircled his wrist before Tony had even realized Steve was moving. (It was unfair that someone so absurdly muscled could also move so quickly and quietly.) “Slowly. We’re not in a rush.”
The task proved harder than he’d thought at first. It had been years since Tony had had the opportunity to design for fun, and it turned out that part of his brain was a little rusty. Steve even threatened to take the tablet away when Tony unintentionally found himself opening the files for Clint’s damn boomerang arrows again.
“It really isn’t the norm around here to measure stuff like that without cause,” Steve assured him. “But there’s some people I can get us in touch with about putting together a study. I’m sure they’d be thrilled to get your input on the design, and they’d probably be a lot easier for you to talk to about this end of things than I am.” Steve expected a smile at that, or at least an acknowledgement, but Tony was still glaring at the chart in front of him, lost in thought and wordless frustration.
“So if I wanted to know how the others are doing, maybe see the, through your—collective eyes? That makes you sound like a spider. Fuck I hate magic. Look, you know what I mean.”
One of the most surprising things Peter has come to learn over the past weeks is how boring some elements of superhero life could be. The first few times he’d seen Tony reviewing footage from Avengers training sessions or battles Peter had been overflowing with excitement. He’d expected
“You will. You are. By giving him space to handle an important problem, by showing him that you’re not just going to change everything on him because he submitted to you once, you’re doing that. Not the way you want, not the way you’d prefer, but his submission isn’t supposed to be about you anyway. You’re a good Dom, Clint.” Clint was far from relaxed by the end of Steve’s little speech, but he looked a little less like he was seconds away from taking the shortcut through the vents and into the range, so Steve was counting it as a win. “Bruce’s notes say that when hand feeding isn’t an option Tony seems to do better with food just being left out rather than directed specifically to him like during a meal. So help me get some more of these vegetables cut up so we can get something into your submissive, hmm?”
There were a few more laughs to be had as Masdee attempted to work out how to formally plate and consume the food, then gave up and grudgingly followed Steve’s advice to eat with her hands. They had never spent this much time together outside of battle and strategy sessions, so their conversation stayed mainly focused on business, though with a slightly more personal edge to the anecdotes they shared. Steve offered up the story of Peggy being the first to test the shield by shooting at him; Masdee, of course, agreed that Steve had known nothing about women, and then contributed her own anecdote involving a herd of wild goats who had nearly ruined her first stealth mission.
Right. Dinner with the Avengers. And it was insane, Peter had actually lost it, because what he planned to say was something along the lines of ‘cool, see you later.’ What he actually said was,
I should also stress that I would also count reading the numerous other wonderful fics set in D/s verses as a form of research too. AtomicFrond’s “Stiletto” is an absolute masterpiece of D/s world building, and I learned a lot from it especially about how to incorporate explanatory details into the actual narrative without derailing it; same with TheKinkyPet’s “Power and Paradox,” which makes amazing use of paratexts like news articles to enrich the reader's sense of the world. I try very hard, of course, to never draw too heavily from just one story, so I read widely within the D/s tag, but those are a couple that have definitely left a mark on my own writing.
He found Rhodey in Tony’s own bedroom, right where he’d left him. On the bed next to him were laid out a full set of clothes, including a cozy-looking pair of sweats and an unfamiliar t-shirt and pair of underwear. Tony picked up the latter first. They were black briefs, soft but relatively plain except for the lace panels that would sit above each of his thighs. He stared at them nonplussed for several seconds, then flushed as he remembered a throw-away comment he'd made on the contract next to the box marked ‘cross-dressing.’
“Any pain here this morning?” The previous morning, even the gentle pressure Bruce used against his thighs had still been enough to make Tony squirm a little bit. Today, he found himself dipping his low back, raising his ass a little higher in the air to meet the touch.
For now, however, this particular vision should provide some valuable insights about one in particular.
Mark II must just have not gotten around to showing this particular tradition off to Barnes, because the bots definitely knew what Tony was planning. All three let out a long string of celebratory beeps and whistles, and then hastened to clear all extraneous objects from the floor of the shop. As soon as the room was prepared, they made their way back to Tony and Barnes and lined up side-by-side right behind a piece of discoloured concrete that apparently marked the starting line in this universe.
We join the team a few weeks after the events of last chapter as they look toward the end of their vacation. Tony and Bucky enjoy the afterglow of a long-awaited scene, and the team welcomes a visitor.
The 24 hours that followed the Avenger’s return to the Tower were awful. Tony hadn’t thought there could be anything worse than the cold dark of radio silence, but at least there was still some degree of hope to be found in ignorance.
Suspension bondage, one of the more intensive and dangerous forms of Shibari, had therefore been on Thor’s dream list for ages. Steve had always meant to learn, but there was always some crisis or another, and then after Tony…well, he’d never gotten around to it. One of the goals Steve had set with Dr. Domen, however, was putting more active, focused effort into strengthening his relationships in the present, so he had spent several days practicing (with the gleeful help of Clint, whose comfort with heights and experiences in the circus made him an ideal test subject.)
“That…that was something our Tony was working on shortly before he died. There’s obviously no pressure for you to share the same interests or investments, but I always felt that the idea showed a lot of promise. So if you’re interested we could spend today talking about what you’re imagining for you professional future here, and how S.W.O.R.D. might fit into that future.”
“Easier?” Tony scoffed, just barely remembering to add a, “Sir?” Steve chuckled again, this time leaning right down so that Tony could feel his breath against his neck, and oh god Tony wanted to live in that sound, he really, really did.
Tony arrived in front of the home he knew to contain Dr. Stephen Strange distracted by the annoyingly persistent urge to rub the sting out of his ass. Rhodey, he’d learned that morning, could pack a wallop when he wanted to, and he had no issue with turning all his trademark focus on turning Tony’s ass red when he felt it was warranted.
“Take it from the handler of this team: none of you are low maintenance,” Phil advised with a wry smile. His hand tightened just slightly at Tony’s neck (the way a collar might if they ever—) “We don’t love that you’ve been through all the things you have, and I’m not going to lie and tell you that Dominating you isn’t work. But you let us
“Mmm, yeah you do need, don’t you? You’re all need and wide-eyed curiosity and I swear Tony it is the hottest fucking thing. Now you’ve distracted me, where was I…ah, the spreader bar, right. Well, I could put a nice thick plug in you—glass, so I could see hints of your pretty hole opening up. You’d be dripping for me then, I’m sure, just like you are now.” As if to prove his point, Clint collected the pre-come pooling on his fingers, offering it to Tony who sucked them into his mouth like he was starving. He threw every bit of frantic desperation he felt into it, swirling his tongue, alternating depth and pressure, working Clint’s with the same skill and attention he would absolutely use to work Clint’s cock if given half the chance. When Clint went to take them back, Tony whimpered again, increasing the suction as if he could force Clint to stay if he was just good enough, dedicated enough to his task. “Fucking Christ, Tony, look at you. So fucking desperate for even a phantom hint of it, it’s amazing you’ve gone so long without a Dominant when you clearly need it so badly. Fuck.” Clint slid his fingers out then, but before Tony could complain, the spit-slick digits were wrapped far more tightly around his cock than they’d been thus far. The relief of the friction was as sweet as his first deep breath of oxygen had been when Carol had returned him to Earth, burning and soothing right down to a cellular level. “I’d let you kneel for me with the plug in for a good while. Maybe even watch some TV. That’d drive you just a bit crazy I think, being ignored when you felt so needy.” Tony grunted an agreement, because even hearing it was enough to make him want to sob in frustration. “Yeah, sugar cookie, you’d want to be the star. But the part I’m still trying to work out is would you want my attention once you really had all of it? When I took the plug out and fucked you right there on the floor, so hard and fast and deep that you could feel it all the way through, and you were begging me to let you come, would you still be so desperate to have me focused on you?”
“It’s not really your fault, you know,” he rasped. There were no notes in SHIELD’s records of Steve also having tried to choke the guy out all those weeks ago, Natasha had made sure of it, but it would be obvious to anyone who knew what they were listening for when they heard the man Taskmaster speak. (
“That definitely means you’re doing it right. I am highly suspicious of anyone who says that being responsible for a kid in any way involves less than constant anxiety. Tell me everything. Spare no detail.”
“You’re not,” Phil said back in a voice near a whisper. “No one ever wanted or expected you to stop loving or missing him, Steve, and having days where the pain of it is a little closer to the surface doesn’t mean you’re going backwards. It doesn’t mean you’re broken.” Steve said nothing to that, but then perhaps there was nothing else left to say. Words could only cover so much of what they had all lost together, and the kinds of psychic wounds that left behind. “Handler talking now, okay? Natasha is ready to go down for you—don’t argue with me, this isn’t a debate. Sleep first if you need to, but then spend the morning with her. Have lunch. Then you’re going to see Dr. Domen in the afternoon.”
“Ow ow fuck, Rhodey, ow! Jesus, stop, man!” Rhodey popped him a couple more times before he even bothered replying, and Tony squirmed until Rhodey readjusted, settling a heavy thigh on top of Tony’s legs, anchoring him in place.
Even despite what turned into a bit of a workshop binge, he still beat Steve to bed that night. He was on the edge of dozing when the noise of heavy footsteps preceded Steve’s entry into the bedroom. (Weird…for a big guy, Steve rarely sounded like it when he walked.)
“My first and only foray into spying didn’t turn out to be a major success either. I’m sure Coulson would have had a thing or two to say about it if he’d been there.”
“All of it I guess. I mean, your world, your Tony, that’s such a definite thing. There’s a whole identity, a whole life built around it. I don’t…it’s not like that for me. It could never be like that for me.”
Still, it was more awkward than he’d expected to be alone with Natasha. The last time he’d seen her in his own universe she’d promised to return in a minute. Instead, Clint had made the journey back alone, utterly destroyed and beaten by her loss. It wasn’t odd the way seeing Phil still often felt; unlike Coulson, who had been gone now for much more cumulative time than Tony had known him alive, it was remembering how the world had been without Natasha that still felt alien. If what Tony had tried to do in his final moments had worked, hopefully the others wouldn’t have to get used to that gaping wound where Natasha’s smoky laugh and mischievous grin had once been. But Tony…well, to him, seeing her was sort of like thinking you were experiencing phantom limb pain, only to look down and realize the part you thought was missing was still there.
It wasn’t until he was practically fellating Bruce’s index finger to ensure he’d gotten the last of the juices from a particularly plump raspberry that Tony realized his jeans had grown uncomfortably tight. He had no idea when during this whole process it had happened, but he was harder than he had been in recent memory, and had zero smooth ways to escape the situation unnoticed. (Fuck fuck fuck why had he had to ruin this? Why did Tony always have to make it weird?) Panicked, he opened his eyes and looked at Bruce, attempting to gauge the damage. Bruce stared back, his pupils blown so wide the brown of his irises were nearly invisible.
Steve had just hustled Tony out of bed and to his morning date with Coulson, and he was looking forward, with an intensity bordering on the pathetic, to collapsing immediately back into bed and falling asleep with his nose pressed against Tony’s pillow. (What? He could cope with having his near-constant bedmate stolen from him in the early hours of the morning, but that didn’t mean he had to like it.)
“You don’t need to worry about that, sweetheart, I’ll take care of all the complicated stuff. You just sit there and enjoy, hmm?” There was just enough of that Steve-specific resistance still active in Tony that he hesitated for a moment, apparently unsure whether he wanted to fight the frankly ludicrous idea that a mind as complex as his couldn’t handle riding Steve’s cock. Steve heaved a put-upon sigh and glanced in Thor’s direction.
like that, he hadn’t come since the milking episode with Bruce (a procedure Bruce had recently begun threatening to repeat if Tony didn’t take matters into his own hands), but right now he also hated it. His dick was throbbing between his legs, and god even the pillow underneath him was starting to seem like a viable option to rut into to get some relief.
“Bruce.” Steve stayed far away from his Dominant tones, which could easily have pushed a dropping Dom into further discomfort, but he injected just enough Captain America that it cut through the haze that the other man appeared to be in. “Take a drop kit down to the workshop, or wherever Tony is right now. There are generic ones with the first aid kits in the main bathroom. JARVIS, the emergency override codes haven’t been changed, correct?”
Masdee was still making the appearance of being somewhat distracted by the food. After extracting a promise from Steve that he wouldn’t rat her out to Shuri, she even ordered a replacement dessert from the kitchens. But something about Masdee’s tone had been far too…knowing. Reflexively, Steve eyed the door.
“I think that no matter what route we decide to regarding SI, we shouldn’t make any moves until after that evening. And I think you should go with Tony as his date.”
“Sounds…floofy.” This was not, perhaps, Tony’s most precise or scientific assessment. He was somewhat distracted by twinned and wholly opposing desires to push Bruce away and fold himself into something small that Bruce could wholly encompass.
“I…I told him he would talk about expanding the dynamic soon, but then I got hurt, and it kind of went on the backburner,” Clint said.
That didn’t mean there weren’t some close calls,. The genetically-enhanced owls had killer claws, and the foamy shit they were spraying everywhere turned out to be extremely caustic; a few of them teamed up and directed enough of it at the Hulk that they burned a small hole in his thick green skin, causing him to roar and nearly drop the civilians he had been carefully lifting to safety. Several of them screamed in terror.
For the first time, Rhodes falters just a little. Peter is almost viciously satisfied by the sight of it.
“I—I’m sorry?” he offered, feeling just submissive enough, still, to be extra-devastated by the idea that he’d somehow managed to upset his Dominant. Steve sighed and forced at least a facsimile of relaxation back into his frame. (Tony spared a moment to feel giddy at the fact that he was familiar enough with Steve’s body by now to know just by feel that it wasn’t the real thing.)
“Thor Juice,” she interrupted, unsure if she was laughing or crying. “Enough to bring down a herd of rampaging moose.”
“And I see that once again I must remind you of the importance of precision in your language. What exactly does ‘it’ entail, Mr. Stark?” Tony was very nearly distracted from his purpose by the re-emergence of Phil’s most official, bureaucratic tone, but he somehow managed to stay focused. (He also made a mental note to point out the heroism of said focus later, because truly, it was amazing anyone could think of anything but sex when Phil used Agent mode to joke with his partners.)
ready to enter into a new relationship with a different version of the man you just started to grieve.”
“Absolutely not. I think it was when it first happened, Tony said something about it getting infected multiple times, but by the time he got here it was on its way to healing properly. All I’ve done is help it along and prevent the infection from reoccurring.” Looking every bit the absent-minded professor, Bruce pulled a pen from behind his ear to chew on. “And of course submission in this context means you think that it’s possible that this universe could be impacting him physiologically. It would be highly unlikely, but he did go down incredibly fast yesterday. Even our…the other Tony, I really don’t know if even he was that responsive, and if you believe half of what they say about Trues…”
“I’m not going anywhere. None of us are going anywhere.” Tony’s voice was rasping and ravaged, but none the less decisive for all the pain bleeding into it. Steve glanced around the room, practically begging someone else to speak. He’d seen two versions of Tony under nearly every imaginable (and several un-imaginable) form of stress, but never before had he run into the issue of Tony choosing not to act. ‘Tony Stark’ and ‘retreat’ were laughable concepts to try to put together, and even without the bigger picture of who Spiderman—Peter—was to Tony, it just didn’t fit. No one else seemed to know what to do with the idea either, with the sole exception of maybe Natasha. (Was she keeping things back, even now, protecting whatever secrets Tony had given her and only her about the other Peter Parker?)
There's also a mention of a past consensual punishment scene between D/s Steve and D/s Tony. The scene itself is not depicted directly (though it'll probably show up as a one-shot someday if anyone is interested), but Steve hints that he was somewhat reluctant to deliver said punishment and did so because Tony explicitly and repeatedly requested it as a way to force him to discuss a difficult topic. If this is a trigger or something you want to avoid, skip the paragraph that begins "How much could he reasonably be expected to tell Tony?"
, had instead folded himself into a cross-legged position, but the visual wasn’t much better. It was almost everything Steve had dreamed of since he’d lost the other Tony: his oldest friend and partner curled up at Steve’s feet next to Tony, a man Steve had just started to accept he would always love in every possible variation.
Immediately, Bruce’s hands were on him. First he made slight adjustments to Tony’s posture, widening the space between his knees, shortening the distance between his feet, turning his elbows so they were no longer hyperextended. Then the touches became a little more deliberate. The pressure of Bruce’s fingertips on Tony’s spine increased, tracing every vertebrae with quiet, careful attention. He lingered silently in some areas (Tony’s hipbones, his shoulders, the tense muscles between his brows) and skated easily over others, but always with a sense of complete comprehensiveness, like he was determined to know every facet of Tony’s body.
On and on it went. Peter was positive he had gotten at least one question wrong, but then the next question was up before he could dwell on it. After a while, Peter stopped worrying about whether or not he was right, and the whole thing felt almost fun. It had been ages since he’d had the time or inclination to really put his mind to much use beyond staying alive and making improvements to his suit and web-fluid. He’d worried that maybe he wasn’t capable of feeling excited about knowledge and learning for the sake of it, that at some point the lazy and ignorant act he’d been putting on had become a realty.
Your second is a complex but extremely important question. The first thing we need to do to answer it is tease apart sex and orientation. While they often go together, it is also very possible for orientational needs to be met in non-sexual ways, and vice-versa; indeed, just like in our own universe, some in the D/s universe prefer sex never enter into their interactions, orientational or otherwise. As to what those without the resources to hire professional Doms or subs do, most workplaces and government agencies have funding available for such instances; because orientational wellness is recognized as a fundamental component of health (and because, as noted above, sexuality and orientation are to some degree able to be treated separately), such practices do not carry the stigma often associated with sex work in the senses that are more familiar to us. (This is not of course to say that these stigmas an associated prejudicial violences are appropriate, of course!)
Since a few of you have expressed interest in the Avenger’s ever-expanding wish-list for Stark, I’ve provided a few of the items and accompanying commentary below.
“He never told me. I mean, I knew Stane had got ahold of an arc reactor, but I thought…I mean, by the time I knew him he had spares stashed everywhere. Guess this was why.” Steve’s usually expressive voice was almost entirely flat, as if he couldn’t bear to feel anything else. The sound of it combined with the violation playing out onscreen were too much.
Pepper sighed, cycling through the other open holoscreens so fast it made Steve dizzy. She finally landed on the team calendar. There was, as far as he could see, nothing particularly interesting about it. Steve’s therapy sessions were marked down, as were everyone’s days at SHIELD, as well as some key deadlines for Tony’s various projects. She pointed a perfectly manicured finger at a date just over a week away.
Natasha was already back on her feet. She charged not at Tony but at the deflector shields, managing to hook one of them with her baton and send it careening toward the other side of the room. Rather than leaping out of its way, Bucky used his metal arm to grab hold of the thing. Steve considered calling out an order, or at least a suggestion, that attempting to hijack unfamiliar, advanced tech made by Tony himself was a bad idea, but ultimately he decided not to waste his breath. Bucky had ever once listened to Steve, or to anyone else, when he didn’t want to.
“Especially at first it felt like a good way to focus my brain. I couldn’t have subbed last night, everything was too busy and jumbled together in my head. Domming doesn’t seem to slow it down the way submitting does, it just—focalizes my energy. Does that make sense?”
“I—maybe I wish that too a little bit. Christ knows why, all you'n I have ever done is break each other into pieces. But when everything falls apart there's still some part of me that always looks for you. God I hope I don't remember saying any of this in the morning... g’night, Cap.”
Tony couldn't even begin to respond to praise like that, could barely even force himself to listen without putting his fingers in his ears and shouting nonsense to drown it out. Phil, thankfully, didn’t force the matter, and instead moved on entirely after only a few moments.
“That was…I mean, it’s not like it’s easy to forget you’re a God or whatever, because have you seen your arms? But it’s different to actually see it used for something like that. You fought a
At first he’d selected one of the benches in the corner in an attempt to stay out of Tony’s way. Then a spotlight came on, illuminating a surface that turned out to have a little card reading ‘Reserved: Spider-Man’ on it. This was probably one of the dorkiest things Peter had ever seen in his life, but it turned out to be more than a symbolic gesture. The space seemed to have been set up with him in mind.
Today, though, he’s too excited to wait. Tony has recently received a substantial shipment of vibranium from Wakanda, and he’s invited Peter to help reinforce the Tower’s walls and windows with it. Even if Peter still felt as wary toward Tony as he had in the beginning, he thinks he couldn’t have passed up such an opportunity. When Peter had told Ned about it at lunch today, he had been slack-jawed and speechless for close to seven minutes. (In Ned time, this was definitely a world record.)
“No. If he sticks to form it’ll be days before he surfaces again. I’ve already lifted the blackout here and at SI, but I’m keeping the extra set of eyes on your place and at May’s work. Just until we can be sure he didn’t pick up on you being at the scene.”
Natasha, meanwhile, sat beside Clint on one of the bar stools. She was devoid of make-up, hair loose and wavy around her shoulders the way it only got when she showered and let it air-dry. Tony had been in the same room as the other version of her when they’d both been changing on more than one occasion, and yet this was by far the most naked he’d ever seen Natasha. She didn’t make any attempt to help Clint as he collected food for all of them on three separate plates, she just leaned lazily against Coulson when he sidled up next to her to drop a kiss on the top of her head.
“No, but it is though. Why are you so interested in Peter, in me? Why call me last night and tell me he was here?”
This was a brave, thoughtful and important intervention in a world that still so often reduces all of us to precisely these kinds of figures. And I write this post in gratitude for all Tony Stark has done, and hope for what he will continue to do.
Which was what was making the sight of them laconically draped over various pieces of penthouse furniture almost unbearable. Clint hadn’t moved for so long that Steve was genuinely confused about how he’d managed to avoid the need for bathroom breaks; some of the others were slightly more mobile, though rarely for any longer than it took to make a phone call or retrieve more snacks.
“I should have written it out on a post-it or something, because this is the third time you’ve asked so far. But you’re with it enough to string a full sentence together this time, so yes. I’m a lying liar who lies, because I wanted to be here to surprise you.” Tony sat up, slightly alarmed by the idea that he’d apparently been so far out of it for that long, but winced as soon as his eyes were fully open. The combined light of the TV and the flood lighting in the penthouse living room felt hotter and brighter than being under actual interrogation lights. He hid his face against Rhodey’s chest. “What’s—ah. JARVIS, dim lights by 70 percent. Shh, Tones, it’s normal, it’s fine. Just some sensory sensitivity brought on by going down as hard as you were earlier. Actually, Steve, maybe get me a blindfold. I was going to hand feed him lunch anyway, no reason he needs to have his eyes open while he starts coming back up.”
work well together. They’d made it through more than half of the documentation from Wakanda already, and Tony had been incredibly effective at translating some of the more poetic and technical materials into language that Steve understood.
“Sometimes I really miss your oblivious days, Rogers,” she snapped viciously, and Steve let it pass because this was the most singularly hopeful thing he had ever seen Natasha Romanov do and he was damned well not going to risk saying or doing anything that might compromise that. “I figured the reactor could sit in the centre, framed by the collar. Even if he doesn’t want the collar all the time, we could put it on him when he handed off the reactor. That is…that is where we’re heading, right? With all of this?”
Clint’s kisses were that same mix of playful and commanding they always were, like a mix of a dare and a private joke. After a few minutes of necking in the entryway, though, Tony realized he wasn’t responding the way he normally did. Kissing Clint was easily on his top five list of things likely to push Tony down toward a submissive headspace, even when neither of them were actively trying to make that happen. But today, Tony’s mind kept whirring, and not even just about Peter. That wasn’t how his brain had ever worked. Once it was going on one thing—like trying to keep his kid’s doppleganger alive despite said kid's best efforts—then it was also planning upgrades to Rhodey’s armour, and making revisions to the SWORD documentation he hadn’t looked at in weeks, and—
Holy shit, the response to last chapter brought me to tears. Like everyone I am struggling with how to be in the world right now, and fandom continues to be an incredible source of comfort and stability. Thank you all so very much for reading, commenting, kudosing, and posing some great questions to the Doctor. Thanks, too, for checking in on how I'm doing, and offering updates about yourselves. I love hearing from all of you, and am holding you all close to my heart in these challenging days.
going to ask to kneel, dammit. They tried to keep orientation stuff out of dates, and besides, it had only been a couple of days since he’d last had much time for submission. There was no reason for his mind to convince itself he was in such desperate need for it.)
Tony hadn’t taken the housing unit off his chest the other night for the punishment, too comforted by its presence in an unfamiliar and stressful moment. But it felt right and already familiar to remove it now and hand it off to Bruce, who looked just as overwhelmed by the gesture as Steve had that first night.
“And why are we doing this? Why are you being punished?” Natasha asked, her hand resting possessively on his ass. Contrary to her suggestion, the language of punishment and forgiveness felt essential to Tony for reasons he couldn’t yet explain even to himself. But Natasha was, apparently, deadly serious about how he was supposed to understand its purpose.
“It’s okay if you’re not ready for this. I can still go get Bruce or Nat or basically anyone else, really. No hard feelings.”
“Hulk want to see Tin Man smash team,” he informed them, then sat down on the floor with a ground-shaking thud.
By now, Bucky was sitting at full attention in his seat, eyeing the room with the cold calm of a sniper. Steve’s own growing sense of alarm was stifled only by his desperation to prove that he wasn’t screwing this up, too. Surely no matter where else he might have gone wrong, he could be trusted to keep track of one teenage kid?
“What…what if when they test me…what if…” Tony trailed off, unable to finish the sentence. He didn’t want to grow up to be disappointed by someone! Or even worse, be a disappointment. He’d done plenty of that already. Howard laughed.
Content Notes: Rhodey provides some backstory about D/s universe's Tony and his relationship with his father. It involves deliberate withholding of access to submissive headspace and resources. If you need to skip it, stop reading the chapter at the paragraph that begins "I met my Tony..."
Tony had never fully appreciated everything he had put Pepper through back when they’d been together until right at this moment. Waiting was absolute fucking agony. Taskmaster had some kind of device that cloned tech (stolen it from SHIELD back when it had been overrun by HYDRA), so the team hadn’t taken more than the bare-bones equipment in with them. This meant no comms, and no monitoring aside from a small group of SHIELD agents that formed a perimeter around the building they were in. They had reported back to Coulson about a loud crash about twenty minutes ago, and had otherwise been pretty much useless. Tony was all for oversight, and it was obvious that the resurgence of SHIELD in this universe compared to their collapse in Tony’s own had been good for the world, but right now he despised every single one of them.
Peter doesn’t know how to begin to digest this. Rhodey at least doesn’t force him to try to do it quickly, or in front of him. He turns instead to Steve, who has apparently been watching this entire scene play out with a horribly blank expression that’s worse than what Peter’s heard Bucky call his ‘kicked puppy’ look.
Content Note: In this chapter, Steve's pilot program faces resistance from advocates calling themselves the 'Coalition for Natural Orientational Wellness.' The group is particularly against the potential for using Wakandan cross-training practices, arguing that people should only be encouraged to accept and live within their classified orientation. This rhetoric obviously has a lot of overlap with certain anti-trans positions. These are not arguments I nor any of the protagonists of this story endorse, but they may still be triggering. This sub-plot will be a recurring element of the story, so avoiding it entirely might be difficult, but if you want to skip the more direct representations of CNOW (heh) and their arguments in this chapter, jump past the email Steve reads (beginning 'Director Rogers.')
Steve knew the words were a mistake even as he said them. He had just barely gotten the kid to begin trusting him. Putting Peter on some kind of exhibition for Bucky and Sam, both of whom he barely knew, would undoubtedly have blown up in all of their faces. Even worse, though, is what happens: FRIDAY pauses for so long that Steve begins to wonder who exactly he’s supposed to call if the AI built by a dead man is on the fritz.
“Honestly, I’m worried you’ll tie yourself in knots if I explain too much at once. Can we compromise, make the call on a day-to-day basis? Today what I’d like is to have you kneel for me until you start to feel any kind of discomfort, so I can determine whether or not the subtonin is impacting your joints at all. Does that sound like something you feel up to?”
“Explain it to me anyway.” This was enough to stop Tony briefly in his tracks. His own team had never really shown much interest in
“You don’t have to—” Steve’s exhaustion was threaded through the half-hearted protest, but Tony could hear the cautious excitement there too. It felt like having been listening to a radio turned one or two clicks away from the correct station, only to have someone finally find the right frequency. The buzzing and static were gone, leaving behind nothing but crystal-clear sound. (If it wouldn’t have made him the most pathetic human being ever to live, he might have fucking sobbed right there on Steve’s dusty boots.)
Ah, yes. I recall the revelation of Stark’s orientation being rather a scandal at the time. Let me show you…
“Tony, listen, if you’re still worried that it isn’t safe, we can give you any information you need. You can speak to Ultron yourself, or to Bruce, or Shuri—she’s helped you guys tweak the programming several times—or—”
He still didn’t know how he felt about it, really, and he wasn’t sure he waned to figure it out. So Tony lingered over the kitchen table, opening and closing his messaging app multiple times. The kid had left hospital AMA that morning; how soon was too soon to check in on him?
“Have you eaten?” Peter whirled in surprise, as if he’d been entirely unaware of Steve’s presence. (That was oddly reassuring. The kid clearly wasn’t flustered by the fame and mythos that surrounded Steve or the rest of the team. The risk that he’d end up bonding more closely with someone besides Tony appeared to be irrelevant.) Natasha was already in motion as they spoke, gathering a heaping plate full of leftovers from dinner; luckily, it had been Tony’s night to help cook, so the meal of steak, green beans, potatoes and salad was more nutritious than the standard take-out that the team relied on for sustenance far too often. Peter’s wide, slightly wary eyes never left Steve’s face, but Steve could see the way he began to orient himself toward the living room’s low table in anticipation of the meal. (Yeah, the kid was definitely hungry. Steve wondered how often he’d eaten enough to actually be full after his transformation. If his metabolism was even half of what Steve or Bucky’s was, probably never.)
“Hulk know this one. Banner no interrupt. Dalton say atoms of same element are alike, have same mass.” Another pause, and did that mean—was Bruce talking to the Hulk, quizzing him on middle-school science? And was the Hulk responding? “Theory updated when atom—atom…broke?” Hulk knew the answer wasn’t quite right before he even bothered consulting Bruce this time; he sighed heavily and smacked himself in the head with enough force that it would have left anyone else with a low-grade concussion. And if there was one thing Tony Stark had never been able to just sit back and watch, it was Bruce or Hulk’s self-hatred manifesting. He reached up (
Steve spent an enjoyable morning and early afternoon with Rhodes, hammering out more of the details of his agreement with the team. Reviewing the man’s contract had been enlightening; he was in some ways a stricter Dominant than the others, more inclined toward an emphasis on protocol and manners, which he’d jokingly attributed to his military and Southern backgrounds. He also placed high value on a whole host of non-sexual practices, including some Steve had never heard of let alone practiced.
It’s almost a relief when Rhodes gets there. At long last, he can turn his attention back to other people’s problems.
He and Natasha had enlisted JARVIS as a somewhat reluctant recruit, but as the AI had explained, he had limits.
“It has been…complicated. Most of the major players who the Feds have proof were in the know about Howard’s cover-up have been indicted by now. Which is nice, and it does mean that I can finally feel safe taking my garbage out at night and other silly little things that got difficult near the end of the stand-off. But it still comes with a price. Morale is low—a lot of people resigned, and then another wave once the stock drop came in. For the most part the ones who are left respect you and think you did the right thing in sharing the information about Howard, but I think a lot of them are feeling a little lost. Maybe I am too.”
No one bothered putting up too much of a fight, and soon the lot of them were marching to the elevator. Everyone except Clint, who took his time getting to his feet and then sidled up next to Tony. (Ever since their date, he’d been far more willing to press his way into Tony’s space. Nothing scandalous, just the odd jostling of shoulders or brushing of hands on knees.)
“It’s Tony,” she reported with a grin. “He slept for six hours, which Thor confirms, and now he’s demanding to know about something in Peter’s file.” The sleep, at least, came as a relief. Steve wished it had been longer, but he knew damn well they were lucky to get that much out of a Tony in crisis-mode. The latter piece of news didn’t seem worth smiling over, however, and he arched a questioning brow in Natasha’s direction. “This is good, Steve. He’s had access to all my intel on Peter since he first asked me to keep an eye on him, and he never once accessed it. He might not be ready to actually see him, but he can’t seem to go back to pretending he doesn’t exist either. It’s a step.”
Being fucked this way, in a position that should have afforded Tony so much control and was instead showcasing Steve’s endless strength and precision, it was so much more devastating than if Steve had crawled on top of him or held him down. It was honestly fortunate that neither of them lasted a particularly long time, because the orgasm building in the pit of Tony's stomach didn't feel like something he knew for certain he would survive.  When Steve’s huge hand wound around his cock, he shook his head and whimpered.
In less than two minutes he had logged into the SI systems and was gleefully slicing his way through the various firewalls and protections around Fletcher’s personal server. His calendar listed him as in a meeting with Melissa Collins, the current director of CNOW. (Hold on, Tony had made fun of that acronym before, somewhere in Steve’s files…)
, Tony. To a Dominant that’s everything. To watch a submissive start to thrive and heal under your care, it’s way headier than the best drug. I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”
“Breathe, doll.” Didn’t he understand that Tony couldn’t breathe, that pain had never, ever been like this before? He didn’t need breath, didn’t need anything but Bruce’s flogger pulling him apart with every delicate, perfectly-aimed blow. “
Steve froze in the act of digging a blue gumball out from between the couch cushions. It wasn’t entirely a shock. Tony had alluded to wanting to separate his own identity from the armour before, but Steve had never fully trusted that he wouldn’t fall back in love with the role, especially in a context where he was better supported and appreciated by both the team and the public at large.
Bruce didn’t stop his steady exploration of Tony’s body, but he did make the little grunt that meant he'd been asked a question that really made him think. (Tony never failed to feel proud every time he drew that sound out of Bruce; it was like the opposite of drawing poison from a bite, as if he was pulling the threads of Bruce’s gorgeous, complex mind closer to his own.)
“The bloodwork,” he said, in lieu of a traditional greeting. There was simply no point; Bruce at least tried to be more polite than Tony tended to be when he was focused on a problem, but the result was usually that he lost track of a conversation midway through and the whole thing took five times longer than just getting down to business.
When her phoned chimed, his first instinct was to pitch it across the room. This was, he recognized, the height of petulance, but he suspected he might bare a kind of instinctive grudge toward Nat’s phone for quite a while. The damn thing had started all of this, broken their beautiful vacation bubble and turned it into something fraught and ugly, and yes Steve’s phone had gone off seconds later, and yes it was more the news the phone had been bringing that had been the real issue, but Steve had chosen his enemy dammit, and it was the little black rectangle sitting on the bedside table of the guest room looking all unassuming and forgettable. He barely resisted the urge to stick his tongue out at it, then reflected that perhaps he was stretching even his body’s limits with the amount of sleep he’d gotten the past several days.
It was a close match, made even more entertaining by the trash-talk the girls were throwing at one another. Peter was eager to see how it would end up.
In what was becoming far too common a scene, Tony stood in the elevator of Stark Tower with no clear destination. He’d gone down to the shop at first, planning to continue his sneaky work for SI, only to find that Pepper had replied to his encrypted plots to save the R&D department from itself with one of her own.
Tony should really have gotten up at that point. They were on a tight deadline, after all, what with him needing to learn an entirely new universe well enough to be able to convincingly impersonate one of its most beloved members. And it wasn’t as if lying here would bring him any closer to Peter, or any of the others he’d lost. This had never been Tony, to just allow himself to stop and succumb to his own demons this way. After Afghanistan, after the Mandarin and Ultron and the Civil War, even after the Snap, he’d found solace in never staying put long enough to truly feel the full weight of anything. So why wasn’t he moving?
, all things that were the very antithesis of what Steve loved about him. “What did he have that I didn’t?”
“They can’t have him back,” Clint vowed suddenly, shrugging when all the eyes of the room were sharply on him. “I’m just saying. I know he has no intention of going anyway since he thinks it could risk undoing things, but even if somehow it turns out that that’s not the case, I’m going to fight for him. They don’t fucking deserve him, they never did.”
That seemed, Tony mused, like the perfect metaphor for Natasha: malleable right down to the cellular level, refusing to choose between strength and adaptability.
“It is 2018, Sir. Excuse me, Avengers, but per security protocol 731-B, I performed a full body analysis when the new arrival entered the Tower. There are some crucial variations in Sir and the previous Mr. Stark’s anatomy, which I can review with you on a holoscreen. However, I can say with great certainty that this is some version of Anthony Edward Stark.”
“I had thoughts along pretty similar lines,” Pepper confided. “And now he might leave.  We might lose him all over again, and the cruelest thing we could do in this instance is fight for him. This whole superhero gig, I just don’t see what any of you see in it. Seems like a big cosmic joke to me.”
As I’ve matured as a writer though, I have also tried to leave myself room to let things evolve based both on conversations with readers and just from general spontaneous things I don’t anticipate until I’m actually writing the thing. To give examples of both: a few of you commented in the first half of the story that you (a) wanted to hear more from Bucky, and (b) that you felt like his and Tony’s subby bonding felt a bit too easy. I’d already intended to explore their relationship more during the vacation chapters, but this encouraged me to spend some time reflecting on Bucky and where he was at and what he might need and want from his relationship with Tony going forward.
“10 years now. Feels like forever at this point. Sometimes I think it’s unhealthy to love him as much as I do.”
Steve leaned against the frame of the door, fingers curled against his mouth, successfully hiding the smirk on his face. His eyes followed the curve of Tony’s bare leg. It was riddled with a light smattering of hair that progressively became sparse the further up his leg he looked. Steve was dying to see the curve of his hips and the firm muscle that granted him enough strength to lift heavy materials, the dusting of hair that trailed up his pelvic area, to his abdomen and then his chest.  It was a beautiful sight to behold, and Steve had something sharp and dry at the tip of his tongue but the words were stuck there.
Tony nods hastily, eyes blown wide and tears falling down his face. Why isn’t Steve here to save him yet?
Tony took in a deep breath. He could feel emotions begin to bubble beneath the surface. To put it plainly, he was frustrated, he wanted to be mad at Steve but was mainly at himself. He couldn’t understand what Steve wanted to hear. He was a genius, able to look at a problem from all angles and solve it efficiently, but this time there were missing variables. Tears were burning the brim of his eyes, and he didn’t realize he’d stopped mid-sentence until he began getting out a weak “I can’t do it, Master.”
Steve took a sip of his water, then spoke. “So you’re new to this lifestyle. What made you decide to try it to begin with?”
“There is no date, I stopped him the other day for speeding, which definitely doesn’t constitute a date.”
“No, I’ll take care of myself later this was…this was exactly what I needed.” His breathing was still a bit short as he talked, he was in the process of gathering coherent thoughts again after having them obliterated just a moment ago.
Antonio furrowed his brows. “Who the hell said anything about me loving Rogers? And for that long might I add.” Yes, he was lying, but did they really need to know how his disgusting pining was so much deeper than wanting a quick fuck?
They weren’t making eye contact right now, both of them staring up at the ceiling as if it would give them answers on how to proceed. Tony decided to sit up. It was most comfortable for him that way, which meant Steve would get a clear view.  To avoid this, he turned on his side, facing the alarm clock, which now read
It works out that way. Tony’s not sure what he’d do if Steve felt anything but disdain towards him, and Steve wouldn’t be caught dead like this. It only works out as long as Tony’s in denial. He can rationalize anything, from drinking to dying; he finds an excuse. The thing about love is, it isn’t an excuse, it’s a human condition, something that can only be warded off but not for  long. It’s inevitable like death, but he finds love to be a more severe condition.
“Lying might work when you’re doing it to yourself, but it won’t work on me. Why are you really here?”
Tony scrunched up his face a bit. He’d never really thought about it. Subconsciously, he might have come to a decision, but he’s never had to answer this question. Overall, Tony had a pretty normal life. CEO of a tech company, making enough money for himself and then some, a small group of friends that he loved dearly, and yet there was this feeling that was like an itch.
Steve sits up, and Tony cringes at the pain of strands of his hair being pulled, forcing him to look up.
Steve takes a deep breath. Well this is awkward. Or maybe he’s the awkward one. He can’t exactly tell. This isn’t the first time Tony’s just invited him over for this reason, needing to get Steve out of his mundane routine. However, he can’t focus on small talk or even the occasional deep talks they have. Hell he doesn’t even want to look at Tony, in fear of those thoughts invading his mind, encroaching on his self control. It's eating away at him, but he doesn’t know what to--
“Oh please, I know exactly what Clint would do if we swapped bodies, and it definitely does not involve cartoons. Listen, we can still do the fancy date thing if that’s what you would prefer, but it’s been a hell of a few days. I thought you might like to just relax a little. Rhodes said you all used to watch cartoons in your dorms on Saturday mornings, and, well…” Coulson waved a hand toward the cereal and the Scooby Gang, and Tony loved every inch of the guy in that second, right down to his pink-slippered feet. He still wasn’t entirely clear on some of the details of why, but he knew it was sometimes hard on the team that he was closer to Rhodey and Pepper than Mark II had been. And yet Phil had asked for Rhodey’s help, and had gone so far out of his own comfort zone in planning this date, solely to make Tony smile at the end of an endlessly long week.
been doing—remaining on the verge of Dominant deprivation, rarely eating enough to satisfy your metabolism, isolating yourself—should be counted as self-harming behaviours. But I concur that you didn’t make any of the larger scale attempts at self-sacrifice that typified your other major losses. Why do you think that is, Steve?”
JARVIS must be dictating his messages, as well as the team's responses. It made sense; the team had been planning to complete as much of the work on the playroom as they could for the day, so their hands were probably too full of paint rollers and tools to be juggling phones. (The fact that everyone but Natasha was probably there also made his internal battle over who text in the first place entirely irrelevant, but he was going to choose not to dwell on that one.)
Steve didn’t want to say it. The very last thing he wanted was to vanish the smiles and laughter that had filled the penthouse, a precious coating over the awkwardness and pain that had been the last several days. The urge to reach out to Tony, to put him on his knees at Steve’s feet and stroke his hair and never let him leave, never even let him
had survived Thanos. Twice. He’d taken down Aldrich Killian and murderous AIs and a dozen other foes. (He’d had Captain America’s shield embedded in his fucking chest.) He didn’t need to be coddled or protected; being alone had made Tony ruthless and resourceful and unyielding, and it was about damn time this version of the team knew that.
However, I am also happy to have the opportunity to return to this topic, because I also suspect that in some ways orientation at times is more of an interpretive lens for sexuality than it is a determining force for how such interactions look or feel. Here’s what I mean: take Captain Rogers and Agent Romanov’s scene in the most recent chapter. Aside from a hefty dose of body worship, which is a go-to kink of Rogers’ when he is distressed, there was very little in that reaction that would need to be defined as orientation-based. Even in the MCU Tony’s universe, it would have easily been classified as a fairly vanilla encounter. The main thing making it a scene, then, was that the participants both framed it that way to themselves. Dominants who partake of sex as part of their orientation are used to understanding most expressions of care, including sex, as a part of their Domination, and submissives similarly experience receiving such care as an aspect of their submission. In short, most sex is scene-based not because it necessarily has to be, or even because there are heavy kink elements involved, but simply because that the is the lens through which most people in this universe are socialized to understand most human interactions.
The promise of access to a computer or a phone was a tempting one, but some part of Tony wanted to do this as Phil clearly preferred; he maybe even liked the idea of Phil gathering up the things Tony wrote at the end of the sessions, placing them in a dedicated folder with the same kind of care he would give highly-classified intel. There was just one problem.
It had been as exhilarating as it was terrifying, and Tony still had no idea what to think about the whole thing.
Tony wasn’t okay. He kept going through the motions, mainly because he didn’t know what else to do, but he felt completely disconnected from all of it, as if his life was a mildly entertaining television show he was watching at the end of a long day. It certainly didn’t help that he spent the majority of his days with Pepper, plotting out a press conference and celebration for a man whose just slightly ill-fitting shoes he would spend his life wearing.
For the span of several breaths, the yearning on Kamala’s face was as bare and easy to read as if he’d known the kid her entire life. Tony wondered if the constant challenge that was Peter Parker across two universes was really making him better at this whole kid thing, or if this particular one was just more transparent than others.
“I uh…I can’t. I have an art class. Nothing big, just one of the free ones over at the college. I was just comin’ up to say goodbye.”
Of course, it turned out he should have trusted Natasha. She took them to a small Vietnamese restaurant that was viciously protective of the team (the owner chased one intrepid photographer who attempted to press his camera against the window of the place with a broom.) They didn’t blink when Natasha told them Tony wouldn’t require a kneeler, either, though she did pull his chair out for him in an exaggerated show of gallantry. Each of the tables was taken up almost entirely by large, ornate spinning glass tray designed to facilitate the sharing of dishes, and Natasha ordered not a single meal but a host of small plates. It was the closest Tony would really come to being able to graze the way he preferred while in public, and his eyes felt just a bit watery as he smiled gratefully at her.
“You just kicked me out this morning without. I mean. You people are all about the damn talking, and this is the thing you decide to just be chill about? Really? Do you not care even a little that little that I just screwed up our entire friendship?”
By the time Phil had completed his debriefing meetings as well as his initial round of notes, it was passed three in the morning. His eyes itched with exhaustion powerful enough that he didn’t trust himself to see the numbers in the elevator, and he requested instead that JARVIS just take him to wherever Steve was.
This is an interesting question, and one that different individuals on the team would likely answer uniquely.
Too many of you are loyal enough to Stark that I am choosing not to answer questions about my current location. What I will say, as it pertains to seeking Stark out, is that I have reviewed the possibilities and will intervene if and when my presence will aid rather than regress his progress in his new universe.
Clint had frowned at that, but let it go in favour of leading Tony from the elevator and onto the thirty-first floor of Avengers Tower. In his own world, Tony was pretty 31 had been one of a number of floors that provided conference and meeting space, and nothing he could see about the floorplan here seemed radically different.
Tony didn't know when he'd started crying. He didn’t even realize that he had until the tears hit the lingering remnants of ice cream on the spoon, turning it into a wet, salty mess. But it didn't feel like he would ever be able to stop.
“Don’t you fucking dare,” Tony growled. He didn’t know much, could barely process or even recognize the wildly conflicting responses he was getting from himself. But he knew that the thought of Clint leaving was about the only one worse than somehow disappointing him or screwing this up. “I’m…I might not know the things you all do, and I’m probably broken in some new and fucked-up ways. But I told you all that first day, I’m not some delicate fucking sugar cookie either. So don’t go treating me like one now, Barton.”
As to the first, this universe does have to make some concessions in terms of labour practice in order to accommodate orientational needs. (There’s a brief allusion to this in my Chapter Five responses.)  There are particular provisions set up for new submissive which (were Stark’s status not a secret) would cover the fact that the team is currently devoting extensive time and resources to his care. Settled Dominant/submissive dynamics, while still requiring time and energy, are not quite as demanding. That said, I would speculate that the tension between labour and orientational needs is a significant aspect of Stark Industries’attempts to cover up the fact that the standard 8+ hour work day leaves many in states of borderline deprivation.
Steve liked May Parker a lot. It was obvious that whatever their recent difficulties had been she absolutely adored her nephew, and she was unimpressed by both her setting and the company in a way he really respected. She also didn’t mince words, a quality he normally loved in people but which became rather more complicated when the tough questions were being directed at his submissive.
“We’re lower on graphite than I’d like. JARVIS, how fast can we have a shipment brought here from the main SI plant in the city?” Apparently the fact that the suit needed small amounts of graphite and carbon fibre to ensure Tony’s feet didn’t end up singed was common knowledge around these parts. Even Bucky knew it.
this way. I didn’t know it could ever feel like this…it’s like—like I’ve been running races my whole life with a permanently sprained ankle, and it had always been that way so I didn’t know it wasn’t supposed to hurt that badly and be so much harder for me than all the other runners until the pain was just…gone. I submit to her all day at work, the same way all of her subordinates do, and that feels easy and right and natural. When we go home I can submit if I want to, or not, and sometimes I don’t feel like it for days at a time at home and that’s okay, I can have that without feeling dep starting to creep in. So yeah, maybe if I’d done things a different way I could have found out how to run the races with less pain, the equivalent of like a fancy brace or something, but my damn ankle still wouldn’t be
“If you turn off the Iron Guard Dog I’ll stay in the Tower on one of the guest floors and work remotely,” Pepper volunteered quickly.
Tony, which—” Bucky growled, low and guttural, an echo of the ugly feeling that that message had left churning in Phil’s gut. And when Bucky spoked, the clipped, harsh tone of his voice suggested hints of the Solider.
“Do SHIELD people literally just work out all the time? Is this a building full of himbos?” Peter wondered aloud, largely to try to keep his mind off of his nerves. Tony snorted.
Thank you as always for the comments, kudos, and questions, and please keep them coming! Talking to all of you about this verse is such a delight and a huge motivation to keep scribbling away.
making major, life altering decisions directly relevant to his care,’ she also didn’t belabour the point once she’d made it. Instead, they moved on to discussing Steve’s progress, and how he intended to maintain focus on his recovery even while his time with Tony would greatly increase.
“Next Maintenance Day…I could try taking a look at the arm, see if it needs any tuning up. I should have time between now and then to look at the schematics and your Tony’s notes.” Barnes didn’t look away from his efforts to pry a self-made trophy comprised of wire, paper-clips and batteries from Butterfingers’ claw, but the ear-to-ear grin that crossed his face would have been visible from a mile off.
“That’s not really necessary,” Rhodes smiled, lifting their submissive’s head and slowly slid away, allowing Bucky to seamlessly replace him. “Tony’s like a kid sometimes; he’s curious as hell, and he absolutely hates feeling like he’s missing out on something. If you keep things too quiet around him when you’re trying to get him to sleep he’ll usually keep himself awake out of sheer stubbornness. Best bet if he starts to stir is to just start blabbing. Soon as he feels like he’s still in the middle of the action he’ll drift right off back to sleep.”
If he’d ever imagined being hungover for the first time around Captain America, Peter definitely would have expected something harsher than the quiet disapproval in his tone. An air horn maybe, or being thrown out of bed at 6:00 am and forced to do chores. Somehow, Peter still couldn’t find it in himself to be grateful.
The very best part of all of it was that with Jane here, Tony could experience everything as both a magical and a scientific event at the same time. He darted happily between observing Thor himself (who was now sopping wet from the rain and apparently unconcerned about this fact—Tony was not complaining about the view) and reviewing the data that poured in through Jane’s screens tracking wind velocity and direction, precipitation, and a myriad of other factors. Every once in a while she or one of the others would shout a direction at Thor, but for the most part Jane just talked Tony through what they were seeing.
And Tony did, almost before Steve had even finished giving the instruction. He very nearly made a crack about this being the first order he’d given all day that Tony had actually listened to, but something (he’d later hope it was intuition, that some part of him had reached out to recognize Tony even that early on) made the words die on his tongue.
For a second or too, Natasha closed her eyes, the bald way that this version of Tony sometimes wore his emotions overwhelming her. But before Steve would ever have started to worry about her capacity to cope, she had gotten down onto Tony’s pillow, meeting him at his level and tipping her head foreward so their foreheads were pressed together.
“Good. Now, give Peter about another half hour of your time and energy, and in exchange I will make you the world’s best preemptive hangover food. Which we will then eat with our feet up on that fancy-ass slab of granite white folks insist on calling breakfast bars these days. Thoughts?”
Most of the time he still felt awkward and embarrassed by such reminders of what the shared wealth of the team could do. It was a power no one really needed or deserved (or at least, one which should have been accessible to far more people than it was, even though someone inevitably called Steve a socialist every time he pointed this out.) But occasionally, like now when he and the rest of the team could use Tony’s submission-free day to get the bulk of the playroom redecoration finished, he found himself pretty grateful.
“No no, definitely not. I swear. Look, I get that this is all a pretty big shock, and if you want to come here right now and see for yourself that Peter is okay then that’s fine. I can have a car sent to wherever you’re at.” He paused to see if May would immediately take him up on the offer. He heard the muffled sound of what might have been a sob, and he winced. “All he’s doing right now is sleeping, and there’s a lot of things I’m not going to talk with you about without his explicit permission and involvement. Why don’t you go home, let both of you get a decent night’s rest? Then I can have you brought here first thing tomorrow morning, and we’ll get all of this sorted out.”
“I’ve thought a lot about what I could do, what kind of gesture I could use to start scenes. I like the way Phil does it, but that’s him. It’s not me. I didn’t know what I could say or offer that wouldn’t seem trite or overly-sentimental. But I wanted you to know. I need you to know.”
The logic made sense, and in some ways it was a relief to have another out. But it was harder, this time, watching the team suit up and prepare to leave without him. When Natasha hugged him goodbye he held on for several seconds longer than was strictly necessary, and could only manage a pretty wobbly smile when she pulled back to look at him. This version of her didn’t promise to return as her counterpart once had; perhaps the loss of her own Tony had wisened her against those kinds of assurances. But she did blow him a playful kiss at odds with her otherwise focused and neutral demeanour, just to see Tony laugh.
“So Tony wants…what, to refuse to do the test? Hit SI first so that if they ask for it it ends up looking like they’re just grasping at straws?”
“You and I have had this conversation before and I will have it with you a hundred more times if you need, but we will always wind up in this exact same place, won’t we?” Natasha sighed and looked away, then visibly winced as Bruce bent her knee. “Nat. Let’s try again. Are you in any pain following your scene?”
The problems started when he got back to his office. Steve had long since accepted that he would always have an absurd amount of e-mail. Way back at the beginning he’d tried to respond to all of them; it seemed rude not to. After he had spent his first three days as SHIELD director doing little else, however, his Tony had intervened. He’d sat Steve down and talked about the myriad of reasons people sent emails, and how even some of the ones that requested replies or were marked urgent were comparatively low-priority. They’d spent the better part of a day practicing sorting messages using Tony’s inbox as a model (mainly, Steve suspected, because Tony got a thrill out of it whenever Steve deemed a message from the government or the Stark Industries board unimportant), and Tony had also designed a program that ranked e-mails automatically.
Cautiously, as if about to handle an unstable weapon (actually, with way more care than Bucky tended to treat dangerous weaponry, Steve admitted grumpily), Bucky reached down to stoke Tony’s hair, murmuring something in Russian. Tony rolled instinctively toward the noise, his head practically in Bucky’s lap, and Steve bit harshly on his own lip to stop from grinning.
Then a flash of memory hit from the night prior (or maybe it had been early this morning, who the hell knew.) Steve had been sitting in the same chair he was now, but he’d been gripping Peter’s hand. All around him it was chaos. Sam had had Bruce on speakerphone and followed his instructions as best he could. Bucky (and maybe MJ, though maybe that was just wishful thinking) were fetching supplies and offering what reassurances they could to Peter. And through it all, Steve sat there, solid and unmoving even when Peter had to cry or vomit again or when he yelled at them all to go.
shot a string of webbing by accident, and was trying to figure out what had caused it to emerge at such a weird angle. Then he realized it hadn’t come from him. The person he’d thought had been tossed was in fact soaring around the room quite voluntarily.
“That’s not-it’s better than nothing, but you’re not exactly the norm, are you? I mean, a lot of you work together or have the opportunity for even minor orientation-based interactions during the day if you want or need them, right?” Tony didn’t include himself in this description of the more daily kinds of submission, which Steve made a mental note to try to dig for more information about later. (Surely the team had at least offered…) “And it’s more than that, even, isn’t it? I mean, right now Phil is punishing Clint for something that happened when he was on duty as an Avenger. Doesn’t that kind of already break the work/personal barrier that’s supposed to be the norm this pilot program is breaking?”
For the first time, Coulson really looked at Tony, and his frown deepened. Tony considered making his second quick exit of the day, wondering with a distant kind of distress if there was a record for that kind of thing and how close he was to breaking it. But when Coulson spoke again, he was back to his usual brisk efficiency.
version of him. But somehow he’d consented to stay for two damn weeks, by which point he expected all of them to have worked past the immediate relief of the superficial resemblance enough to realize they could only ever make him act the part of the man they’d loved. (And hopefully by then the pitiful bursts of hope Tony got when the smallest damn things happened, like Clint smiling at him or Phil giving Tony every bit of his attention every time Tony spoke, maybe by then those would be gone too.)
“I mean, you’re not wrong,” Tony conceded, spinning in place to give Steve an exaggerated waggle of his eyebrows. “But as I am currently forbidden from wearing the good captain out that particular fashion, I’m forced to get creative.”
He’d done his research privately because, as he’d told Cap when he’d stumbled upon Tony’s initial viewing party, he wanted to spare the rest of them the need to relive this for his benefit. But several of them seemed upset that Tony had taken the initiative to find information on his own.
As the time stretched on and the team still didn’t return, those small and almost certainly unintentional acts of Tony’s were no longer enough. Steve stood and began to pace the length of the penthouse, wondering whether he’d be able to lift the shield, and for how long, if he went after the Avengers now. Then Tony moved and made a slight hissing noise. It was quiet, something Steve probably would have missed entirely without his enhanced hearing, but it was there, and it was decidedly pained. Now every Dominant drive Steve had was all but screaming at him to
Both those strategies were temporarily unavailable to him, however, due to the fact that his head felt like it had been stuffed full with cotton wool. The glacially slow movement from one thought to the next, which had felt like a welcome relief during his scene with Clint, was now a major hindrance. It annoyed him enough that he was unfairly pissed at Clint for making him this way; Tony rejected several of the other man’s subtle, reassuring touches, and refused outright Clint’s multiple attempts to bring the discussion temporarily around to dinner. Finally, Clint got frustrated enough that he rose from his place on the couch next to Tony and stalked out of the room. Pepper followed his angry path through the house with an uneasy expression.
Today’s chapter is what I’m referring to as the mid-season finale of you great unfinished symphony. We get closure and insight on some important plot and character points, and set up a lot of moving pieces for part two!
Tony loved workshop days the most. The rest of the time his Dad had only a few settings: physically gone (searching for Captain America), mentally gone (booze was usually the culprit on these occasions), or emotionally gone. The latter times were the worst, because Howard would be there, right in front of you, and he might even be sober, but he might as well have been thousands of miles away. Those usually happened during the big fundraising events Tony’s Mom put on, though Howard had also been known to check-out during kiddish milestones he considered beneath his son, like piano recitals or elementary school ‘graduations.’
“You are most honourable, Friend Tony!” Thor congratulated him, waving a hand containing a half-eaten toaster strudel in greeting. “But what is this trial you speak of?”
“No. You look at me, don’t look away.” He thrust up again, then twice more in rapid succession. Tony’s mouth fell open in a wordless cry; he wanted to hide from the intensity of all he could see in Steve’s fierce gaze, but he was powerless to do anything but obey as Steve mercilessly brought them both closer and closer to the brink. “I see you, Tony. I’ll always see you.”
“He needs you. I’m not sure if it’s drop or something about this conversation. Probably both. Steve and I can make it through the rest of this without him, so I think you two should go back to what you were doing when I got here.” Clint had leapt to his feet and was across the room and looming over Tony, tall and muscled and determined before Tony’s brain could even compute the fact that he was being handed off.
By dinner, Tony had slid all the way up to baseline without even realizing it had happened. Coming up out of headspace had never been this smooth before. He stared slack-jawed and stunned at Steve, who just winked in reply.
“Based on an earlier version SHIELD made, yeah. Means it can be turned into any shape, though Steve being Steve, well he likes the familiar. He rarely takes advantage of that function when he uses it.” He whined, just a little, when Bruce stopped massaging him, but the thick, fluffy socks he slid up Tony’s feet afterward did actually feel pretty nice. “JARVIS, dim lights by 30% and put on some Mozart. Uh, let’s go Symphony 40.”
Eventually, even being held and fed by Rhodey wasn’t enough to distract Tony from the silence of the room. Especially since everyone kept staring at him like they were waiting for something. And hell, they probably were. It wasn’t as if there wasn’t a million damn things they should probably have been talking about, like how Tony had gotten here and what had happened to other-Tony and when he’d be leaving the Tower and—yeah. Not going there yet. Not until he could even think it without wanting to hyperventilate.
“…of course. Yes. Please inform the General that I will join her this evening, though I may not be able to stay long.”
For how frequently his own Natasha had talked about wiping red from her ledger, the way she’d given her own life to right the series of wrongs that had led to the Snap, he supposed it was unsurprising that this version would take such deep pleasure in her adaptability rather than a set of specific kinks or tools. Part of that range seemed to also mean she could recognize when talking just wasn’t necessary; when Tony didn’t say more beyond a thoughtful grunt, they lapsed into a silence broken only by her quiet instructions about how to move his body, and the gentle ripples and splashes of the water enveloping them.
When he’d fantasized about Coulson staying around in the other universe, fixing the cracks in the old team before they became universe-ending fissures, it had always been a very abstract thing. Tony was not a soldier or a spy; the closest he’d ever come to having a handler was Pepper, and she’d started to feel her own limitations in the role the moment Tony became an actual combatant. To have Coulson standing before him, calm and competent and ready to give Tony anything, it was almost intimidating. And still, his answer came easily.
“Yes, pet, I’ll make sure to get Tony set up with a safeword before we proceed any further. But that’s not your job to worry about right now, is it?”
There would be no convincing them as a unit, that was certain. So he would need to get one of them alone. Bucky would usually be his best option on that front, but on this particular topic Bucky was a double-edged sword. He’d seen Steve at his worst after the loss of the first Tony, and was therefore more frightened than any of them to be presented with potential evidence that Steve might be slipping back anywhere near that place. Steve tried with Bucky exactly once, alone in the gym in the wee hours of the morning, and gave it up as a bad cause within minutes.
Every morning, Tony went to his favorite doughnut shop. He’d order a few, a cup of coffee, and leisurely sit and eat, or rush out the door depending on whether or not he was running late for some meeting. Every morning, a tall blond caught his eyes, bulging muscles, looking as stern as ever while ordering a cup of coffee and a doughnut.
“We can definitely bond through a threesome, and to my pleasant surprise both of you are very handsome. I’m obviously the best looking one, though.”
With that they head their separate ways. Steve mulling over his thoughts the entire ride home, wondering how he would ask. If he can still ask. Tony brought it up, and he’s obviously still thinking about it. Steve chews on his bottom lip, contemplating how and when he should bring it up--because not doing it is no longer an option. He can no longer ignore the shroud of darkness that grips him, he needs release. And Tony is going to give it to him.
Coming back to the table that carried his box of doughnuts, he found a note. Tony’s brows furrowed as he sat, his eyes scanned over the note.
Tony nodded stiffly, tears in the corner of his eyes that softened the firm look on Steve’s face. Maybe he'd been lying earlier; maybe this was his favorite part of being around Tony, him being compliant and needy. Whatever it was, it motivated him to keep pushing Tony. Steve’s fingers worked in a ‘come hither’ motion, slow and steady, his free hand rubbing the back of Tony’s thigh gently.
Tony says nothing more, but Steve hears the clicking of something so familiar, something hypnotizing and something that makes his cock twitch. When Tony finally reveals himself, Steve’s mouth parts and for a moment all the air leaves his body at once. He’s gaping, he knows he is, and Tony looks so proud and gorgeous. His hair immaculate and slicked into place, a sheer lacy robe that rides high and grazes his upper thigh with matching panties and garters, all sharing the same deep red rich hue that compliments Tony’s skin beautifully, sheer stockings and sleek black heels. Tony’s long and lean body looks like it's made for lingerie, and Steve wants nothing more than to bend him over and grab a handful of his perfectly done hair and fuck him relentlessly. The only question is whether to start with his ass or his face first.
Ned beamed. Wide, unselfconscious, and toothy, the kind of smile they’d both worn so much as children but that Peter had assumed they’d lost forever somewhere along the way. Except it made him feel different to see it now. Back then smiles like that had meant simple camaraderie, secrets of the kind that little kids shared like sneaking treats or staying up past bedtime. Now it made something stir in the pit of Peter’s stomach, a sort of protective triumph he mostly associated with his time as Spider-Man, and with the few chances he’d had to experiment with Dominance when he’d first been classified as a Switch.
This is an excellent question. To some extent I spoke to it a few weeks ago (in the responses to Chapters 43 and 44.) And my response there still holds; I suspect that once the balance between work and orientation is more equal, there might be more interactions that explore sexuality outside of orientation.
“I used to be on the other side of this. Maintenance Day,” he added, when Tony’s confusion apparently showed through. “The arm our Tony gave me…it’s really complex, and it took a while to work all the kinks out. But maintenance—well let’s say I didn’t have the best associations with that. So he turned it into this, this
“Put on something mindless, JARVIS. That hilarious rom-com with the guy who looks like Bruce, maybe?” Watching
They trooped toward the playroom together, Bucky in a reluctant lead next to Tony, who seemed sleepily bewildered by the whole thing. Both of them kept sending glances backwards towards Rhodey as they went; this was unsurprising from Tony, who might always look to Rhodes first in moments where he felt uncertain or unsure of what was coming next with the rest of the team, but for Bucky, who usually responded to ‘outsiders’ with either aggression or withdrawal, it was nothing less than a stunning development. Rhodes had earned not just Bucky’s trust, but that of the Solider, and he’d done it so quickly and seemingly with very little effort. (Who the hell was this man?)
“No, you’re not.” Natasha had her hair in the thick, tight curls that she’d worn as Natalie; they had been Tony’s favourite in his own world, and it was too much of a coincidence for that decision to not be deliberate here, too. (Natasha had dressed up for him, just as Bruce had.) She, too, had finished eating, and was staring intently at Tony from her seat across the table. “No one’s going to lie to you and say that some of the attraction won’t always be the resemblance between you two. I’m sure the reverse is true for you as well.”
They’d gone through the list of exactly what Tony was being punished for before this had started, and Tony had agreed with most of it, but this…this one was too much, too far. He shook his head, face rubbing against the leather of the bench, and Steve sighed from behind him. Tony knew a brief moment of relief and disappointment when he thought Steve might have already given up on this whole punishment thing.
“Good to hear you admit it!” came a voice from the living room. Seeing Rhodey walk toward him with no bracers, no visible signs of pain except for what looked to be a stiff neck from sleeping on Tony’s couch all night…yeah, this universe had some perks. (
Pepper did not like being surprised. Pepper especially did not like being surprised when it came to Tony Stark. She had trusted one version of him to these people years ago; she’d had little choice, with Tony practically half-dead from sub-dep and Pepper herself unable to assist him. And then, as the Avengers had begun to provide for more and more of Tony’s needs, he and Pepper had fallen away from one another. It had been gradual, so slow that she thought she was imagining it at first. There hadn’t been a fight, no dramatic scene on one of their parts. They’d just begun to call one another less; then her visits to the Tower became more infrequent, and focused on business. Before Tony had died, they hadn’t spoken in weeks, and her first thought when she’d heard the news was how much she regretted allowing the distance to grow between them, so that she couldn’t even remember the last meaningful thing they’d talked about.
Steve wouldn’t think about the implications of that moment again for months, though, not until Christine Everhart had unintentionally exposed Tony’s biggest and longest-held secret. But the hint of a pretty pink flush that stained Tony’s cheeks as he sat down, that pretty much never left Steve’s mind.
. Even Tony hadn’t managed that in his own universe; oh he’d tried in his spare time to find what was left of his weapons; he bought them from those willing to sell, and destroyed many more, especially from those Obie had dealt to under the table. But then Ultron had happened, and the Accords, and Thanos, and there was no real choice about letting the recovery of his weapons take a backseat to saving the world. It had haunted him, though, even as he lay dying (or so he’d thought) on the battlefield.
And he did. He murmured of cruelties he could barely comprehend, knowing they would hurt Pepper even worse than they did him, because it had been her Tony, her universe, who had really borne the effects of what this Howard had done. He confessed, too, about his own Howard’s play with the Soul Stone, how he’d turned Tony into the only one who could have beaten Thanos, saved Natasha. He hadn’t intended to share quite so much.
Content Notes: First response includes representations of physical violence from an enhanced teenager toward an adult, as well as discussion of grieving the loss of a parent. I also want to note that the POV character sounds and likely is vaguely suicidal at the beginning of the response. He's not making any definite plans beyond using time travel, but given that the context of said time travel would be rather different than in the canon, it takes on a different valence here. If you want to avoid the most direct discussions of that, start reading several paragraphs in at "He came to suddenly and violently."
, Tony. In a lot of cases that’s going to be synonymous with orgasm, but it doesn’t have to be when that’s honestly not what you want or need in a particular moment. I’m perfectly happy to watch you enjoy your body for now, and let that take us wherever it takes us.”
When Steve reached him, the intensity of the camera flashes tripled, but the second Steve had put his arm around Tony and guided him inside the boundary to the park, they light and sound stopped just as suddenly. Tony’s expression briefly registered surprise, but he didn’t ask, and Steve didn’t explain until he had led them to a quiet table toward the outer edge of the heavy, thick gates that surrounded the space.
In hindsight, that should have been his first clue that something was not quite adding up. Pepper might get annoyed or frustrated with him sometimes, but she had never really been the type for guilt trips. As it was, Tony was so relieved to have her on his side, not threatening to tell the team or otherwise prevent his actions, that he agreed readily.
When they actually got to the penthouse, though, Bruce stood frozen for a minute at the threshold where the hardwood floor of the main living area turned into the tile of the kitchen.
All of his admirably strategic thoughts were put rather on hold when Hulk leaned down, stuck his nose in Tony’s hair and sniffed. Audibly. Then a large green hand was reaching out, hovering near Tony’s arc reactor without touching it directly, followed by sound somewhere between a moan and a growl. It was quiet in a way that the Hulk so rarely managed to be, but all the more devastating a sound of pain for that.
“She’s gotta be another Inhuman,” someone near the back of the room said. Tony, expecting Steve to smack down anyone using that kind of language, was unpleasantly surprised by the nods that followed. He didn’t dare call it out, though, for fear of exposing himself as an alien to this universe. Instead he focused on the footage.
“Plausible deniability, baby. If this ends up hurting us on the market tomorrow, the Board has no cause to say you knowingly did something to endanger the company.” As a peace offering, he took her foot into his lap and began massaging it just the way he knew she liked after a long day in towering heels. She groaned and tipped her head back even as she muttered discontentedly about how she’d had to put up with Rescue hovering in her window all day like a ‘damn Iron Bat.’ (Tony was so copywriting that.)
“It ends up being a really delicate process. Some degree of burning is often healthy for the Earth, plus we don’t want to mess around with global weather patterns too much. But when the fire gets too big, or suddenly shifts direction and risks the lives of the responders or major populated areas, Thor can often turn the tide in our favour just a little bit,” explained a familiar voice from a few feet away. Tony spun to find Jane Foster seated at a makeshift desk, scrolling rapidly through several meteorological maps and projections on her laptop. Tony had really only known Jane by reputation in his own universe, but he doubted she was any less brilliant in this one. He very nearly introduced himself before she stood and threw her arms around him a tight hug. “I’m surprised you never made it out here to watch before….well, anyway. It’s great to have you here. Come sit with me and watch the show!”
“So wait, though, only people who are classified as Dominants or high ranking switches could ever take on leadership positions? Doesn’t that just open up the potential fo a whole new kind of discrimination, the kind everyone here told me doesn’t exist toward submissives?”
Tony’s hair was windswept beyond repair, his clothes were wrinkled and smelled heavily of smoke, and he probably looked just as wild-eyed as he did after days in the workshop with little to no sleep. And he didn’t care even a little bit.
Even as he fought the very real temptation to hide from Coulson (who would be so disappointed if he knew what darkness his childhood hero carried inside him), some part of Steve was relieved by the presence of his handler rather than his submissive. Steve would never have left Coulson in need if he’d been down already, but the thought of having a submissive’s needs and desires in Steve’s control held, for once, very little appeal. How could Steve trust himself to care for and guide someone else when he was so utterly lost?
“I’d also be happy to talk you through any of it personally, Tony, just say the word. My wife and kid barely know who I am anyway,” Richards, another signatory on the almost-open letter assured him. (Try to turn him against Pepper and Cap more like…it really was annoying how predictable these people were turning out to be in every universe.)
Content Notes: This chapter involves Tony dealing with both Bruce and Phil's non-physical punishments. Neither are easy for him take, but are well within the limits they've all established.
“I…no? I mean, I don’t think so. It—it was exciting, and Thor was…” he trailed off, unable to articulate the sight of a demigod wrapped in rope and begging for his touch, but Bruce nodded like the sentence had been complete.
“I’m living in a Tower full of superheroes. Gorgeous, supermodel-level people who have all recently expressed interest in—what hilariously anachronistic way did Barnes put it, ‘making time'—with me. And then they asked me to fill out a bunch of paperwork.”
“I want a grilled cheese sandwich. And we should use the Iron Legion when they come for us.” Steve was halfway to the kitchen to seek out ingredients for the requested meal when he spun on his heel.
in moments of crisis, sat with a stiffness that was entirely at odds with his sprawling posture. A rumbling noise from outside was enough to confirm Thor’s mood without looking at him at all (and damn this meant Steve was going to have to make yet another apology to the meteorological society for his teammate’s unpredictable effects on weather pattens.) Bruce’s head was buried in his hands while he took the long, deep and measured breaths that meant he was trying to avoid an unplanned transformation.
Slowly, painfully, the room swam into view. It was nowhere near as sophisticated as Peter expected the old version of the medbay had been. Much like the shop, a lot of things were still in boxes, or scattered about the room. Especially near Peter’s bed, the floor was a cluttered, chaotic scene. Empty vials and bags of fluid looked to have been thrown next to the IV pole. A small collection of textbooks, including one still open to a chapter on allergic reactions, lay abandoned near the door. One box, which Peter suspected had contained the monitoring equipment he was currently hooked up to, was spilling leads and cables all over the place.
In any place, any time, any universe, Tony would always recognize the sound that Pepper Potts’ high heels made when she walked. He almost always heard her before he saw her, even when it shouldn’t have been possible like when the music in the shop was blaring or the SI board members were all screeching about their latest outrage. And for years that noise, that perfect combination of authority and feminine softness, had heralded safety and stability and comfort and love.
“J, I don’t care what the environmental system scans say, they’ve gotta be buggy or something. It’s freezing down here. Raise temperature another 5 percent.” His AI did as he’d been instructed without commentary, for once, and Tony wasn’t sure if the silence was comforting or if it made him feel even more lonely. Either way, he had to get the hell out of here.
By the time Steve’s hands were between his legs washing his cock and balls, Tony was glad for the excuse to be making small whining noises. It turned out even talking  bout their scene was enough to make him half out of his mind again.
The ageplay verse is of course a kind of happy AU where no one dies and Tony gets all the best parts of Hamilton. I also used that one to think through Steve/Eliza parallels; it’s so easy to read Steve as one of the other major male characters in Hamilton, but canonically Steve seems so often to define himself and his actions based on loving others, so I really wanted to take that up here and think about what it would be like if the world actually let him do that instead of tragically ripping it away.
It hurt. It ached at what felt like a cellular level to watch them together, to see how seamlessly this Tony could slide back into his old patterns and routines. It felt like being unmade all over again; so much of Steve’s sense of self had been destroyed and then re-shaped around the absence of Tony that to be presented with this irrefutable evidence that the man in front of him was some version of the man he’d loved was…well, it was not so much like seeing a ghost as realizing that he’d been one all this time, himself.
“Hmm. I’m bettin’ it would be a little much for me to here for something like this right off the bat. I have some meetings back in the city that I’ve been putting off since I went on leave. Maybe I’ll head out today, give you all some space to get his routine established, then come back in a couple days.”
“Hate to disappoint, but it’s not really anything interesting. A lot of jeans and tees, coupla cheap but decent suits, nothing really—”
“It wouldn’t work like that. Part of the release comes from knowing you messed up and being forgiven for it. If we punished you frequently on that scale for no reason you would just end up resentful—not to mention extremely sore.” As if to prove his point, Bruce increased the pressure of his hands on Tony’s ass and thighs until Tony hissed and tried to roll away “Punishments aren’t magic. They’re not going to erase years of pain and trauma and all their residual effects in one go. But that doesn’t mean what you’re feeling now isn’t real or meaningful, Tony, and it also doesn’t mean that all this won’t eventually help with the things that are hard. It’s just a more gradual process; it’s about learning, over and over again, that we’re here, that we aren’t going anywhere, that we’ll pull you back in line and remind you that you’re deserving of love and care and attention as often as it takes.”
Steve reaches towards the drawer at his desk and plucks out a cigarette and his lighter. He lights it and inhales deeply, then exhales--letting his eyes fall close for a second, reveling in the pleasurable combination. Steve thrusts his hips up to get more, using his free hand to shove Tony's head down further to take his entire length down his throat. Hearing Tony gag sends a chill running up and down Steve's spine, drool runs down his balls and he can feel Tony's throat encase his cock. Steve grunts and inhales once more, fucking Tony's face rougher and listening as he chokes.
He folded up the rules and placed them back on the nightstand. Soon, he was asleep, that is after rubbing one out to the memory of Steve’s voice.
Tony repeats, the grin on his face still prominent and his eyes glowing beautifully bright. It takes another few thrust to get Tony coming without touching his cock, he gasps and claws at the desk, and Steve wonders if he knows how badly he’ll be ruined. Steve pulls out his cock slowly. “Your slut hole is gaping,” Tony doesn’t respond. He looks as if he’s been fucked senseless. Too bad.
Tony didn’t know whether to quirk his lips upwards into a childish grin or spit them out sarcastically to ease the awkwardness. He chose the latter.
Tony had a half a doughnut in his mouth and was probably pressing on the gas a bit too hard. He’d seen the cop car out of the corner of his eye but figured, he wasn’t going
“Why wouldn’t I? I gotta live up to my playboy image. And this way, sex in the suit  is always be an option. The question is, why would a big bad Hydra agent use lubrication?”
Steve jumped at the sound, and saw Tony, a smug smile set on his face, leaning up against the door frame.
, when he realized he should be tying his shoe and not staring at his friend's unfortunate (well, actually, very fortunate) situation. For god's sake it wasn’t like Tony had known Steve had a thing for show-casing which direction his dick was pointed (a nicely curved right it would seem), it had just happened.
Steve shot him a grin, patted the side of his face, as if chastising a child, and Tony swore it only served to turn him on because he was hard.
Tony would call it an empty threat, but Steve’s made him do a lot of things before. He still doesn’t move, though.
Tony’s shaking harder again. The minutes pass, and when he hears familiar voices, his stomach finally gives up. He vomits.
Antonio rested his head onto Anthony’s shoulder. “Nonsense. I’m a fantastic liar, and way too sober to tell you about my
“What are you wearing?” He asks, which is his way of trying to get over the shock of Tony looking so damn good. It’s partially because he’s never seen a man look so sexy before. Men don’t wear lingerie, they're not supposed to look feminine and yet--
Tony rolled his eyes, handing over the required information “I’m sorry, but I could have sworn you were an officer, not a detective.”
Tony backs up in disgust. He feels sick to his stomach again, but before he can say anything, Steve yanks him back and slaps him harshly. Tony’s face stings.
Steve felt uncomfortable in the public eye, having to bite his tongue at times and ignore stupidity. Tony put on a good act, obviously used to being a public figure by now. He charmed the audience and interview personnel just by smiling at them. Over all they were able to keep up petty appearances, and Steve was quite irritated by the end of it. Feeling Tony run a finger down his back as they walked out, though, had him forgetting why he was so pissed off.
Tony’s nod was stilted, tension rising with the reminder of what was to come. He could do this, he told himself. Steve showcased a warm smile briefly, and that in itself eased Tony’s nerves a little.
Saying he was annoyed was a vast understatement, not because of the bullshit speeding ticket, it was the fact that he was edging on twenty minutes late that worked his nerves. Rolling down his window he spotted the officer from rear view mirror.
Tony says nothing, keeping his mouth open and letting drool roll down his chin, not verbalizing how much he wants to be used, but still wanting. Steve shoves his cock back into his mouth, pumping in and out, and Tony moans at the texture hitting his tongue, the taste and the sensation that hikes up his spine.
“Not hard enough. I’m here to test your limits, and I’m not telling you to do something you can’t do. So, again, from the top.”
Steve had the hands of a worker, rough and worn, and strong. His touches, however, were gentle when meant to be. He took his time in some areas, near his hipbones and thighs, the hunger in his eyes evident with every swipe of his fingers.
He clicks. It takes a second to load but when it does, the action is already on-going. The brunet male groaning and trying to push back on the other's cock, but having no choice but to be still and take whatever is given. Steve wants it, he craves it, he needs that form of control and Tony had offered, in a sense.
Tony didn’t usually enjoy anyone else’s place but his own, but Steve’s living quarters were different. He lived in a small loft. A room separator split the place in half for what he assumed was an art related side, (he could spot canvases covering the other side of the wall), and a living quarters, where he found a kitchen, a bed, and so on.
Tony’s not sure who let out a sigh first or who decided to give off bedroom eyes first, but it was an equal exchange of both. Tony didn’t touch himself. He watched as Steve grasped his erection and palmed himself. Tony dug his nails into the flesh of his hands, teeth biting into his bottom lip to keep any ridiculous sounds from leaving his mouth.
After grabbing some tissues and cleaning up, Tony sighed and landed his head on Steve’s chest, wondering if this was pushing things too far. Steve, however, didn’t seem to mind, matter of fact he pulled Tony in gently.
Quite possibly the need for someone else to take control of an aspect of his life, though he couldn’t really place his finger on it. He didn’t realize how long he’d been quiet until Steve spoke again. “You alright?”
A dark chuckle left Steve as he pulled up. Tony could hear the cap of a bottle of lube being popped open, followed by a teasing a finger at his entrance. Steve ran his finger around in a circle, and Tony squirmed and tried to get more stimulation, begging shamelessly until he was breached.
“You did such a good job,” Steve said, always letting Tony know how wonderful he did following Steve’s lead after they messed around because Tony seemed to like it. Tony shook and nodded, thanking Steve in the most gentle way, that made Steve shiver.
Steve let out a whimper that acted as an agreement, pulling himself up off of Tony’s lap so he could be led in the right direction. Tony’s room was less extravagant than Steve would have thought, matter of fact, it was quite simple. Sharp lines, dark shades with hints of warm colors to tie everything in. The place looked untouched, as if Tony didn’t spend much time in, it if any at all. In retrospect, it made sense to Steve. Stark was a busy man.
After coming into Steve’s hand, Tony’s hips lowered, and Steve pulled his fingers out gently. Tony was still trembling, smiling as Steve leaned down for a soft kiss.
Tony nearly choked on his own spit. “So I can’t choose to eat without having to be in a relationship? I eat lunch!”
“Understand and memorize the submissive part underneath the first rule, which is patience. If you fail to recite this satisfactorily, you’ll be punished. Do I make myself clear?” Again, the tone was stern but at the same time calm; Tony almost shivered.
Tony gasped again, feeling his vision white out at the edges and a tingling sensation at his temples. He’d have an angry bruise around his neck that would last for days, turning from red to a purplish blue, then to an ugly yellow, little reminders of his insolence and need to be put in his place. Just thinking about touching over these trophies elicited a moan that came out more as a wheeze than anything.
“I’m going to touch you,” said Steve, already beginning to do so with a warm hand on his arm, “and you must not touch me as I do so.” He finished firmly, the same hand wandering down to Tony's pelvis.
Tony looks just as shocked as Steve feels. “Oh--I honestly didn’t expect you to say yes. How about eight?”
He felt dizzy when Steve pulled away. Tony’s lips chased, but the blond only ran a fingertip along his lips and smiled.
He licks again and again. Soon, he’s sucking the head of Steve’s cock, and through half lidded eyes he looks up to see Steve’s staring back—more dominant than cold now.
Steve’s voice made him want to listen, stern but soft when need be. It was amazing from the few times they’ve interacted how badly he’s come to want Steve. Just one kiss could either tie him over or send him over the edge.
Laughter and chatter flowed, their order was taken and Tony went with an unusually healthy option. Jan waved her hand in protest afterwards.
Tony licked at the tip, sucking up the precome eagerly, which got a distinct exhale from Steve.  The hand in his hair gripped harder, but Tony refused to rush. He took his time, licking along the shaft, then back up to the head. He enjoyed the texture along his tongue, sucking the tip, then moving to suck on his balls. One of his hands stroked up and down simultaneously, in sync with the sucking along the tip of Steve’s cock, and Steve’s hips bucked in time with Tony’s rhythm.
The sound of Steve shutting and locking the door made him jump, bringing him out of his thoughts for the moment.
. Tony still had to get used to that, not because he didn’t like it, but coming from Steve’s lips nearly left him hazy.
“Fine, yeah its about that.” Steve’s fumbling with his fingers a lot more now, and Tony’s leg seems to be jumping in place a mile a minute. They’re both nervous.
He shouldn’t answer. It’ll cause some terribly awkward conversation in the morning but- “You, fucking me, Q-Quinjet.” Too straightforward. Steve might get up and walk away right now, knowing Tony was fantasizing about fucking him—he was pretty sure Steve wasn’t straight, but he was also almost certain the soldier wasn’t into him.
Tony rolled his hips, grabbing the armrest for leverage while his eyes were sealed shut. The small pants turned into full on moaning and cursing, a flush making its way down Tony’s chest as he heaved in and out. Steve wouldn’t admit it, but he could fall in love with Tony like this; and he hadn’t even gotten to the best part.
“I like art, and I like your art,” Tony said simply, as if that were a perfect justification. Steve was right- he did look obviously uncomfortable.
Tony raised a brow by the end of it, reciting it while keeping the edging on with a pompous lilt in his voice.
“Even back home you weren’t this scared,” the man sits up, lifts his leg, and strikes Tony with a hard kick across his face. Hard rubber soles feel like being hit with a damn bat, pain blooms across his skin and he cries out in agony. Most of the agony stemming from the man that looks so much like his closest friend torturing him.
“Again, this time I want you to say it like you believe what you’re telling me. We’ll do this until you get it right.”
At any rate, he decided on white garters with a light blue ribbon in the center of the thigh, the color carried throughout the lace of the garters and panties. Next, he put on the panties themselves. He loved slipping on stockings, seeing his thighs slip behind opaque nylon made him shiver, followed by the garter belt, snapping and securing each section before slipping on his trousers. He heard a slight creak in the door, then two soft knocks.
“Yeah, I like sex, but it’s never been about how I feel. It’s just a good thing, like any other distraction. It’s good for when I need it.”
After marking the event in his phone he called up Pepper. “I need you to do me a huge favor and cancel any plans I have after 5 p.m next Thursday…and possibly the next morning.”
They were kissing after that, Steve couldn’t stop himself from making little noises and gasps every time Tony licked or sucked at his bottom lip. One of Tony’s hands reached towards the front of the babydoll and rubbed the pads of his thumb against Steve’s nipple, the combination of the lace and Tony’s insistent fondling had him keening. Already, Steve felt hot, bucking his hips and craving more. Tony looked down and groaned in satisfaction,
“How dare you treat me like one of your lackeys. I am everything this pathetic excuse for a terrorist group wants to be. I am superior, and I’m making you an offer to better yourselves, to become bigger and to spread like the disease the lesser thrive on. And you sit here and eat as if you've got a fraction of what I have to offer.” Tony doesn’t yell, but his voice raises a few levels and his face plate is removed, the look on his face reads pure disgust. Those eyes of his glowing a brilliant blue, hair a true black, and chiseled features that have Steve seeing why he’s able to woo the public.
Tony’s eyes were blown wide, and his lips were parted in a dumbfounded way. He felt humiliated and overwhelmed all at once, but he also felt a great sense of wanting. He cleared his throat. “Oh, well I’m not sure if that’s something I’d be able to do.”
Tony couldn’t say what he wanted; all he could reply with were broken sentences and whimpers that went straight to Steve’s cock.
“Good, you should come by my place--” Steve opens his mouth to protest and Tony interrupts “--not for a party just to hang out. You’re such a recluse.”
“You wanna suck my cock, Stark?” Steve’s Brooklyn accent slipped enough for Tony to hear the 'a' in his last name sound longer.
Tony bit his lower lip before nodding, then quickly remembered Steve couldn’t see him. “Yes Master.” His voice was low, he could already feel himself stirring.
Adjusting his knees a bit on the hard floor made it so he didn’t slouch. He wanted to focus on the arousal of this situation, being so close to what he wanted but not getting it, they were both in this boat, though Steve embodied the first rule, patience. However, Tony found his own constant need of appraisal annoying and disheartening.
Steve went quiet, and Tony really wanted to hit himself in the head for that one. Like he’d previously stated, they weren’t on that level of comfort, and their silence was proof of that.
“It’s no big deal; I’ve slept in worse conditions for 70 years,” Steve joked, and Tony cracked a smile.
“Like with all relationships, sometimes things just don’t work out. In my case I don’t think either me or the submissive were getting what we wanted out of it.”
They didn’t bring up the subject of limits after that, leading into other typical subjects. What they both do for a living, where they live, interests, normal first date stuff. Conversation went by easier than expected, and they ended up not touching the subject of dominant and submissive for the rest of the night. Steve seemed genuinely interested in him, asking questions that weren’t prying, yet Tony could tell he wanted to know more.
Tony sucked his teeth. “Alright, Captain smartass, let’s play the alphabet game. Think of a word that begins with each letter of the alphabet and we go back and forth.”
