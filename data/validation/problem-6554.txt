He hefted his backpack on and locked the door behind him before setting out on the sidewalk. The cement was still damp from the night’s rains, and water still trickled down the curb as he traversed the uneven sidewalk panels. He loved Brooklyn, even now. Though it was far more wealthy in this day and age, it still held greenery and charm that no other borough had.
Despite all of that, Steve just had a pressing numbness in his gut about the whole thing. He feared what Tony would say, but he wasn’t sure what words he was actually afraid of. He couldn’t imagine that Tony was calling him up on a date (he’d made it clear that wasn’t what this was) but there was always a chance that maybe Tony was just trying to get his guard down, to make him more susceptible to saying yes.
“I don’t think I remember one.” He stood up, brushing his hands on his pants. He moved and picked up a stool on his way over to Peter, plopping it down beside his son and sitting down. He knocked Peter with his shoulder. “What’s up?”
“Tellin’ yourself that doesn’t work for very long,” Bucky said.  He squeezed a little tighter, though Steve already felt like his ribs were going to fracture. “You’re still Stevie Rogers to me. You don’t gotta pretend like you ain’t scared ‘cause I’ll see right through it.”
He scurried over to Emory, keeping his head low as he peeked through a baseball-sized hole in the wall. He blinked slowly and his contacts’ HUD flicked to targeting mode. Scanning…scanning.
Then he woke up, he felt a weight in him that hadn’t been there before. His body ached, and there was a tiredness in it that didn’t seem like it would go away anytime soon. His limbs felt heavy as he pushed himself up, and he noticed that the lab was darker, the lights dimmed.
Peter pretended to focus on his Starkpad, but then clicked it off. His reflection in the black screen was conflicted.
“Hey, speaking of which, where are you parents, MJ?” Steve asked after having gathered the courage to say something. Peter was his son, for God’s sake. He should have to feel small in the presence of his—
Tony grinned. “You wanna shower again? We can do that. And you know you don’t have to change the sheets. You just do that because you’re a good soldier, darling.”
A dog was staring at him, its tongue lolling out and eyes vacant. There was a faint pounding in his head that he soon realized was the sound of gunfire. He groaned and sat up—until Blaine shoved him back down.
Steve had only talked to Peter about Mary Jane once before they started dating, and it had been an uncomfortable conversation that Steve had forced. Nothing like the longwinded talks that Tony seemed to be hinting at. Of course, he hadn’t even known at the time that Peter was talking to Tony about it more. Maybe he should have suspected something then.
He should have come right back to the barracks. He should have walked in crying and gone to bed. No one would have said anything and they wouldn’t have mentioned it. It would be over and done with.
Blaine shot Steve a look that he could tell was a ‘I can’t believe you’re sending me off with a fucking
,” Steve replied with a wheezy kind of chuckle. “Tonight’s probably gonna be bad, but that’s why we’re here a day early. The shock’ll wear off by the rehearsal.”
Tony was high, and he didn’t think Steve had noticed. But he could tell in the way Tony’s hands ran over his body over and over like he’d forgotten what he’d just touched. He was probably on some combination of Xanax and Adderall, which definitely wasn’t healthy, but as Tony would say, he hadn’t died yet. And if Steve was being honest, he seemed almost normal on this combo. Almost sober.
Steve gazed at the blue shafts of moonlight on the tile, dimly wondering just how long they were going to live. How much of it he was going to spend with a gun in his hands, his shield abandoned in his attic long ago.
Sam’s voice went gentle, like it always did when he went into therapy mode. “It’s okay. I get it, man. No hugs is just as fine as lots of hugs.”
“Yeah, I know,” Peter said distractedly. “They want to film in the Tower. And do you have Pops’ old address? They want to ask to see if they can film there too. Just to get the feel of what kind of places I grew up in.”
Even though he’d walked way too far to get here just to immediately leave, Steve wasn’t going to complain. He wanted out of here. “Sounds great. See you soon.”
That party had been a fluke, as they’d discussed. The vulnerability he’d seen in Tony that night had disappeared when he’d sobered up and rushed out of the apartment the next morning.  Steve couldn’t really blame him for that—he wasn’t sure he would have fared any better had roles been reversed.
“Once we’re in the house, we have six minutes to disable the security and begin extracting intel,” Steve continued. “Cueball, you’ve got that under wraps, right?”
“You’re allowed to tell me to fuck off, for starters,” Tony began. His index finger tapped lightly on the frame. “And I did mean to come down earlier, I just…”
“Dammit, Peter, tell me what you said, right now,” Tony snapped. Everything seemed too quiet. “When you were yelling at him, what did you say?”
“I so do. Like how you do that shrug thing when someone makes you happy.” Tony’s brow furrowed a little. “It’s like you aren’t expecting people to make you happy. Or something. What’s up with that?”
But stepping outside meant he was drowned in the noises of gnashing dog teeth, the clicking of ammo clips locking into place, and the shrill cries that signaled mortar fire.
“With my internship, it’s just easier,” Peter mumbled. “I already talked to Dad about it and he agreed.”
“What’s in this compound anyway?” Steve asked quietly as Blaine brushed the red snow from his gloves.
Not-Tony rolled his eyes. “No, Steve.  I’m just saying that you have to be rested. You’re stressed, you’ve been through a lot.” Not-Tony moved from where he’d been leaning and headed for the bar. “You’re not required to stay here. But there’s plenty of room if you want somewhere familiar to sleep.”
“You said you didn’t love me anymore. What else did I need to know, Tony?” Steve’s eyes opened, and he met Tony’s gaze, unafraid this time. That pulling in his heart had stilled, and the dark matter that had taken the place of all of that affection kept his entire being solid. There was no wanting now, no desire.
“Excellent,” said Blaine. “While Cueball is extracting data, our objective is to find anything that will get us closer to Kim. If things go belly up, head for the trees in the southeast corner of the property, at the edge of the stone fence line.”
“Today is a day that’s gonna go down in every history book of every country on this earth. Many of you will die, many of you will make it through today and die tomorrow, but some of you will live. And all of you will fight.”
It doesn’t escape Steve that Tony hasn’t offered an affirmative on whether or not he’ll help, but he pushes that aside.
Natasha doesn’t flinch back; she takes it all in stride and stays steady as the wave of emotions washes through him. He doesn’t need to be a spy to know that the twitch at the corner of his left eye speaks volumes.
“Language! Sarah’d tan your hide for that kind of talk, pal,” Bucky chastises, and there’s laughter twinkling in his eyes when Steve pulls away. It’s the same laughter from when they were little more than children, when Bucky was all mischief and temper, and his ma and Bucky both could set Steve straight in an instant.
“Come here.” Steve hauls him backwards towards the roadster, leaning back against it as Tony eagerly finishes unbuttoning his pants. He shoves them as far as they’ll go, tangled around Steve’s ankles, and then he drops to his knees.
To guide Tony in the right direction, his own personal moral compass, when Tony has only ever been the other side of the same coin.
Tony lifts one shaky hand to the back of Steve’s head. Even running his fingers through the hair on the nape of his neck feels like too great a task. “I love you, anyway.”
They both know it’s a lie, but this time Bucky doesn’t call him on it. When Bucky doesn’t respond, Steve closes his eyes, turning as far away as he can.
Tony turns away with a heavy sigh and crosses the short steps towards the side table in the small sitting room, a half-empty bottle of scotch loosely capped beside overturned crystal glasses from the night before. Or maybe this morning, it’s hard to say.
“You have a lot of nerve coming here, Steve. One phone call and you’d be behind bars. And you know it, too. You know it and you came here anyways because poor fucking Tony Stark would never call in his own partner. Well, you’re right again,
“It’ll be hard for him, Rhodey,” Tony runs a hand through his hair and tips his head. “Hell, it was awful the first few times I ran through that sequence I prepared for the MIT grads. I mean, I know
“That’s not what I–” Steve groans and runs a hand through his hair. “I just meant that, he’s going to be looking out for you. The kid’s loyal. So, it’s the least we can do, as a team, to look out for him, because he’s new to this and, uh, like I said, he’s a good kid.”
The gloves had been a gag Christmas gift Natasha had brought to their first gift exchange when the original Avengers had moved into the Tower. They were bright purple, fuzzy, with a big, glaring Hulk face on the back of each hand, much to Bruce’s chagrin.
“Why wouldn’t I be okay with that? Bucky can do what he likes.” Steve replied, and the tousled brown hair had popped off his chest, presenting him with a full view of grinning, gloating Tony Stark.
“What if it never gets any easier?” He feels pathetic even asking, small and childish. Steve hardly recognizes himself when he looks in the mirror anymore. He’s been lost a long time. Adrift.
A nightlight to chase away the bad dreams. The strands of Steve’s hair catch in the blue light and cast unsettling shadows on the wall behind him.
“I love you, Steve,” he swore brokenly, chest seized up tight. He wondered if it would be his heart or his lungs that gave out first. He supposed it didn't really matter.
“How many times do I have to remind you to call me by my given name?” he teased, giving her an easy grin as he leaned one arm across the edge of her tall desk.
Steve slipped quietly through one of the double doors, sharp eyes scanning the room. He couldn't repress the smile that tugged at his lips at the sight of his dark-haired beauty standing behind his overly long, arched workbench-turned-desk, profile lit by the holographic screens that littered the air, brilliant eyes seeing a whole other world in the strings of code, clever hands flying as if conducting a symphony. His intensity was breathtaking, his passion a masterpiece, and the super soldier had to take a moment to admire it.
It was true, Cap's little band of merry men (and Natasha – did that make her Maid Marion? He wasn't brave enough to ask.) had left their belongings behind in favor of beating a hasty retreat, which meant they would need to come back sooner or later, and there was no telling how long this would take. So, Tony pressed his lips into a thin line and motioned for Cap to follow.
“I'm sorry, too,” the blonde told him, smiling again, albeit with a hint of grief lurking just below the surface. “I didn't handle things very well – scratch that, I screwed up entirely. You're a wonderful man, Tony, and I should've known there was more to it when you agreed to sign the Accords. I should've taken the time to talk to you in private, to hear you out, to actually discuss it, but I was just so
“God, I miss you,” Tony whispered, leaning in to press a kiss to the cold lips of Captain America's memorial statue.
He snagged Tony's left wrist around the back edge of the table, securing it with a strap whose other end was tied securely to one of the legs of the workspace. “What the-” was all the billionaire managed before Rogers whipped his counterpart's loose tie off and wrapped it around his mouth as a gag. A millisecond later, he'd pulled the dark-haired man around and secured his right arm with the second strap he'd installed. His fingers flew through the motions of undoing his paramour's belt and pants, and he took a brief instant to glance up. He saw the panic, the fear, and it made his chest ache, but then recognition flared in those dark eyes and the pain was gone.
So, he'd been left broken and bleeding, the cavity in his chest, where his heart had been, filling up with anguish and denial and fear (always more fear). But his fear twisted to anger, as it always had, and fueled him to take actions he might not have under other circumstances, make choices he would never have dreamed he could make, all for the sake of numbing the pain and drowning the fear. He'd been tasked with hunting down that proud, stubborn man and he didn't put up much of an argument, knowing someone else would be sent out in his place, someone unconcerned with keeping a fugitive alive; there wasn't a word strong enough for the desperation that consumed him at the thought of irretrievable loss, something so overwhelming it felt like he was looking at it from the outside, like he couldn't actually feel it. So, he'd built his own team, met his love on the battlefield, and pitted friend against friend, tearing them all apart the way only his special brand of fucking up could. Then, his paramour had escaped, clever thing he was.
Clint was the next to notice, voice garnering everyone else's attention as he called, “Hey, Tony! Hickey buddies!” He gestured between Tony and himself, apparently having made no effort to look anything other than quite thoroughly debauched. The billionaire couldn't help flushing a little, regretting his decision to include turtlenecks in Steve's side of the closet, making a mental note to remedy that later.
The captain made short work of releasing Tony's wrists, hands slipping under his torso to gently pull him backwards onto his feet and help him straighten up. The dark-haired man's knees gave out, but Steve was ready for that, holding him upright with ease.
“If it makes you feel any better, when Sam and I were getting heated after our training session last week–just a bad session, we’ve been workin’ our shit out–Steve tried to step in to defend Sam. We’re mostly good now, so I told him as much and reminded him that, if anyone, he’s the reason for the braces by putting us all on that field in the first place. I thought he was going to pass out.”
Tony is gloriously naked and Steve should wait, pull back to savour his beautiful form, but it feels like too much effort to draw himself away from Tony’s sparkling gaze. Desire pulses between his legs as Tony brushes up against him, cock hard and nudging against Steve’s hip.
Tony swallows hard, biting hard on the inside of his cheek to hold back his own tears. If it’s possible, Steve seems to sag even further into his arms.
The wound in Steve’s chest feels just as fresh. The nightmares are paralysing. Even when he was first waking up in the present, adjusting to a new world where everyone was long gone and nothing made sense… Nothing has ever compared to this.
“Feel like we haven’t fucked ‘im in ages either.” Bucky teased, a hand sliding back down his chest, aborted when Steve grasped his wrist and pinned it to his own thigh on the couch.
Nothing will ever be the same. After all their options run dry, they stop talking. It’s been days, and Tony hasn’t said a word.
Steve took the plate with him, wandering down to the workshop. The door didn’t immediately open, and though he loathed to use his override codes unless absolutely necessary, it felt like the right time. He owed Tony an apology.
Steve doesn’t say anything when he walks into the room, standing near the bed where Tony is haphazardly packing his belongings into the duffel like an overstuffed sleeping bag. It must be driving Steve mad, Tony’s vindictive mind supplies, because Steve Rogers still packs a bag the way he had during the war, every item in its place to conserve and maximize space.
, acting under extreme duress, and the Avengers will not see him doubly punished for the sake of unfortunate politics.”
When everything tasted like honey and nothing hurt. He hadn’t worked so hard to have this, only to be
Tony bites out a sharp laugh. “Of course you’d think that’s why our marriage is ending. Did I miss you being this oblivious before I proposed, Steve? I feel like this is new, but maybe I was just blind back then.”
“No. That’s enough. I’m not doing this now.” He rubs absently at the scar beneath his shirt, swallowing hard.
“No, you don’t,” Tony snaps, gesturing a touch too wild towards Steve. “What part of ‘don’t want to see you, stop calling me’ didn’t make it through your thick skull? Get out.”
“Tony’s dead. You can’t change what you did and you can’t bring him back. You need to start accepting that.”
There’s a flash of doubt across Steve’s pale features before he’s yanking out, shuffling up the bed on unsteady knees and stripping the condom off to jerk hard and fast onto Tony’s face.
Tony dragged his eyes to Steve's face, saw the focus of his dreams for the last two years, saw the want and rage and confusion there, and the
On the way out, the dark-haired man tucked bridal-style into Steve's arms, he said, “IT, really? That's what you came up with?” and Rogers' laugh echoed through the deserted building.
The billionaire trembled beneath him and around him, letting out a low moan, earning a wicked chuckle. He enjoyed tormenting the dark-haired man sometimes, especially when he was laid out like a feast for Steve, and Steve alone, but his words were more of a reassurance for himself; he knew Tony liked it rough – was not-so-subtly reminded of it quite often, in fact – but he was always afraid he'd hurt him. So, regardless of the fact that the tech genius was relaxed from his recent orgasm and that Rogers had covertly slicked himself with a fair amount of lube, he was still worried that he'd caused him pain. The salacious words were meant to evoke a response that he could use to gauge the situation, and the positive feedback he received now was a relief and a turn-on.
He slid his hands down to grasp the undersides of Tony's thighs, pulling his legs up close to his chest, then lifted him almost completely off his dick and brought him down hard. The new angle seated him deeper than he'd thought possible, and effectively cut off his name as it left his lover's mouth, ending it in a loud moan. Just as he had earlier, Steve set up a swift, hard pace, snapping his hips upward every time he maneuvered the billionaire down, each thrust landing squarely against his prostate. He delighted in the loud noises he elicited, the curses and pleas, and the sound of his name fueled his fervor.
where his nose was pressed to the skin of his collarbone. He hummed sleepily when the strong arm that was wrapped around him tightened possessively, getting a gravelly chuckle and a kiss on the head in return.
“Okay, I'll make you a deal: if you can stay quiet for the next... let's say two minutes, I'll take the tie away. Then, I'm going to bend you over the desk and fuck you as hard as you want.” There was open desire in those whiskey eyes, along with a touch of surprise at the use of such a crude word; Tony had been asking him to “
Seeing as they were, he hummed his appreciation as he went down on his lover, garnering yet another barely-contained noise of pleasure. He bobbed his head at a decent pace, fully intending to bring Tony to swift climax, but the man was either stubborn or gifted with stamina. It took far too long for Steve's liking, and all of the tricks he knew, for the tech genius to tip over the edge, but when he did, he fell apart in the most beautiful way, back arched, keening moan, completely enthralling. The blonde drank down everything he had to offer, then straightened, not bothering to curb the impish smile that stretched across his lips.
It wasn't right. It hadn't gone the way it should've. There was too much he'd left unsaid, too much he needed to get out, before it chewed up what little was left inside and left him entirely hollow.
“I wish you wouldn't drink,” Steve cajoled, and it brought up memories of another time, long ago it seemed, when he'd uttered those exact words and looked at Tony with sad eyes. The tech genius hadn't been able to deny him then, had promised to work at cutting back (successfully, with his paramour's encouragement), but now he turned to face the blonde and defiantly took a long swallow from his tumbler, bitterly pleased with the glare he received.
“Alright, fine, yes, I've been drinking. Not like it matters.” At least the last time they'd had this exact conversation, he'd been happily drunk on margaritas. Now, though, there was no room for sweet drinks, only strong, bitter ones.
It was Natasha who brought him out of his trance. He didn't know what she did, if anything, but he suddenly snapped back to himself and locked onto her piercing green eyes. She gave him the tiniest quirk of her lips, a sunny grin by her standards, all her words conveyed in that minute movement; he hoped his own expression said everything he felt. She studied him a moment longer (oh, hey, she was blonde now, how weird was that), then her face changed in that subtle way that meant something else had garnered her attention. She gave him another warm look and stepped gracefully to the side, exposing the decidedly rugged countenance of his paramour.
in those beautiful eyes, and release ripped through him, made him shudder and twist, screaming Steve's name, and he never once broke contact with those eyes. Through the overwhelming sensations – he'd never cum that hard in his entire life – he watched Steve's expression contort with the pleasure-pain of his own finish, and if that wasn't the hottest thing he'd ever seen, well, it must have been, because it sent violent aftershocks rolling through him.
The liquid in the glass looked woefully under-measured, so he shrugged and added some more. Two fingers, then.
Pitching his voice a few notes higher than normal, slipping in a hint of French (a skill he still retained from his time in the war), he called, “Mr. Stark? I'm with IT. I've come to place those lines you requested.”
Everything he'd been keeping buried inside came welling up, anger and fear scrubbed away over the last few hours, leaving only pain and sorrow behind. Tony pushed himself up on his elbow and looked down into Steve's face, chest aching for the love in those sparkling eyes and the warm smile that felt like home. He watched his paramour's brow slowly furrow with concern, imagined how his own expression must look, and spoke quickly before he lost his nerve.
just crazy, that he'd spent the majority of his life believing he'd never be able to form a meaningful relationship with a single person and then this crowd of pariahs and outcasts had wormed their way into his heart, and now he cared so much that sometimes it hurt to breathe – so devastated at the thought of millions of people wanting to hunt them down if they didn't cooperate, terrified at the prospect of the things that might happen if they didn't agree to be collared, and he'd made his decision. He'd said it was to protect innocent lives, and that was true to some extent, but what really mattered were the lives of the people closest to him. So, he'd made those promises, picked up that pen and signed away his soul, willing to stagger and bleed under the constraints the drafted words would impose on him, so long as it meant his family was safe.
“Don't do anything too outrageous. You have to be there for the team, especially while I'm away. They need you.”
“You didn't,” Tony insisted, pouring every ounce of accusation into the words. “You could have and you didn't, Steve. I'm here, I'm okay,
“Tony,” the super soldier groaned, licking up the exposed line of his partner's neck. He smirked at the whining moan he received and said the name again. “Tony, I'm going to cum deep inside you, you know that, don't you? I'm going to cum inside you again, but harder this time.” That made the dark-haired man shudder and Steve smirked. “Tony, touch yourself.”
This wasn't going at all as planned. It wasn't supposed to be this heavy. It was supposed to ease his pain, not redouble it. Why had he thought this was a good idea? Because for a genius, he was awfully stupid, that's why.
He tasted the sharp tang of blood, a taste he was intimately (no pun intended... or maybe it was...) familiar with, and Steve jerked back with a gasp. Tony met his eyes, doing nothing to douse the fire he felt burning in his own, and deliberately cleaned the blood that had spilled onto his lips with a slow swipe of his tongue. He darkly enjoyed the way those baby blues followed the movement, the unrepressed anger he saw in them. He tugged gently against the big hands still closed around his wrists, a delighted shiver running through him when they flexed bruisingly tight for a moment, and then he was free.
Tony had been bitching for days about some very specific type of wires – something that, of course, went right over Steve's head when he'd gone into detail – for some particular purpose – again, no clue what – that the IT department of StarkIndustries was supposed to be installing. The company's eccentric owner could absolutely have done it himself, but it was apparently a tedious task that warranted only enough attention to complain about in favor of whatever grand project in which the billionaire was currently entrenched. Thus, a perfect cover for the captain.
The tension in his core erupted with Tony’s voice ringing in his ears. Everything blurred white for one blissful moment as Tony’s body gripped Steve tight and went tense, quivering as it found release at just the right moment to leave Steve breathless.
Steve pressed his mouth to Bucky’s forehead, evening out the small lines as Bucky slept. The questions circled round and round in his brain, driving him insane.
Steve gives in because he has to. He’s given Tony all the right answers, and Steve understands how they got here. It was inevitable. Maybe it always was and he’s not surprised that he missed it.
Beyond incredulous, Tony scoffs and shakes his head with wide eyes, letting his voice drop softer. “You’re a fucking mess.”
He tries to remember what Steve has told him about Barnes. It’s not much, just that he’d been captured by HYDRA during the war, and again after he’d fallen from the train in the Alps. Between 1945 and present day, Barnes has been a HYDRA assassin, seemingly unaware of his actions and controlled by means they’ve yet to uncover. And Steve had loved him. Deeply, passionately, with all the heartache of a man from the forties trying to be something he wasn’t, forced to love his best friend from a distance.
Tony squeezes his fingers. “They haven’t told me much. Nat and Sam, they’re—there’s something they aren’t telling me, isn’t there? Besides the obvious, that is, because I’m sure you’ll remember that you told me this was just another mission and then I find out there were
Tony resists the urge to yank him down by his tie, listen to the rewarding sound of him choking as the knot twists against his throat. Instead, he focuses on kissing him deeper, pouring in all the heartache, loneliness, and bitterness that he’s lived with all these months.
Steve picked up the pace, pumping his hips and tugging Tony back onto his cock with every brush forward. There was something deliciously forbidden about fucking Tony this way, his body reacting purely out of muscle memory, tightening and releasing without explicit permission and Steve felt his self-restraint splitting at the seams.
“I’m not going to talk about this,” Steve says. “If you’re not going to help me, then just say so and I’ll go.”
The moment Natasha and Scott step out of the car and make their way up the front steps, Steve knows something is wrong. Natasha looks grim, but she smiles at Morgan and ruffles her hair. They haven’t seen them in months, and he finds himself wondering why they’d left Bruce behind.
Steve strides towards him in half as many steps which forces Tony to lean back to look up at him as he reaches over him and shuts the door. This time, Steve pushes it hard enough to leave it rattling on its hinges.
Steve shifts in the chair, drawing Tony’s attention back to the scene. Realization slams into him like a train.
It appears there’s nothing more to be said, and he has a sneaking suspicion that Bucky already knows it anyway. As he’s stepping over the threshold back into the hallway, Bucky’s voice trails after him.
Pepper breaks off with a loud groan that turns into a scream, and the midwife settles peaceably between her legs. “Alright, honey, alright. Not long now. Pops, why don’t you get up there and hold her other hand, huh?”
Tony gives him a calculating look, like Steve’s a series of codes he can’t quite figure out, tongue trapped between his teeth and poking just barely at the inside of his cheek. “Steve.” Tony ducks his head when Steve looks away, holding his eye. “Steve. Just—I’m here for you. I’m here
But Steve’s been setting aside the issue of their relationships for months and he’s not surprised that asking for Tony’s help today means he’s going to have to step into the limelight and face the music.
In a moment of uncertainty afterwards, when the anger had been set aside, Tony had asked if maybe he’d rather try exploring things with Bucky instead. Tony sitting there, face smooth marble, and offered to lay down their bond, as strained and non-existent as it was, had made Steve want to be sick.
Tony padded into the bathroom adjoining the workshop, body screaming in the best way, on the hunt for a wash cloth. Behind him, and in the centre of his mind, he could tell the super soldiers were whispering to each other.
“Hold on.” When Steve opens his mouth again Tony shoots him a fierce look and he snaps it shut. Tony allows himself two shuddering breaths, just two, enough to stop the trembling in his fingertips even though the rest of his arm still rattles at his side and a small gust of wind might tip him over.
Before he can get another word out, Tony surges forward and kisses him, his mouth firm but pliant over Steve’s. Tonight, Tony’s kiss is awkward and uncertain. There’s a slight tremble to his hands, unsteady when he reaches up to frame Steve’s face and as one palm drifts down his neck, Steve can feel the way Tony’s breathing shudders and he leans further into the kiss.
Watching Steve and Tony dance around each other had been a unique form of torture, especially after he’d caught on to what Steve loved about the Omega. Tony was a force to be reckoned with, all harsh words and cutting remarks. When he laughed, which had been rare in the beginning, Bucky felt it down in his toes.
Shirt tossed to the floor, Steve’s hands glide through his hair, tracing the lines of his jaw and pet down his chest in a sweeping arc that should warm him from the inside out. It shatters everything,
The tight reins Tony has on his emotions uncurl and slip from his grasp. “How am I ever going to be happy without you?” Tony demands, muffled into Steve’s shoulder, clenching the hand that isn’t tangled in Steve’s hair into a fist pressed into his shoulder blade. “How could you do this to me. You promised me. You
Maybe they can finish this tomorrow, when Tony’s had enough rest to regain the fire he needs to battle it out with the world’s most headstrong soldier. Does Steve know that he didn’t actually punch Hitler over two hundred times?
“Let it be stated, for the record, that I can be a very forgiving man.” Tony flicks them a charming smile. “Given the right incentive, of course.”
“Guess the cat’s out of the bag.” Then Steve was placing one big palm on the side of his face, cupping his cheek as if he were something delicate. “We were going to talk to you. Or at least I was.”
“You figured out time travel and you haven’t figured this out yet?” Steve grins up at him, Tony’s smile contagious. “That doesn’t sound like Tony Stark to me.”
The fact that she can admit she’s made mistakes and isn’t perfect is far more than he could ever expect to get from Rogers anyhow. He should take it. Maybe if the world doesn’t end, they’ll come back to it again sometime.
The chiming of Steve’s phone in his pocket draws him away before the exchange goes any further. Tony doesn’t watch him stride out of the room, exchanging sharp words with someone on the other end.
“My turn now?” Tony takes a deep breath and looks down at his hands. They’re loosely clasped in Steve’s and though he’s nodding, there’s caution swirling in Steve’s eyes and Tony imagines that it must be the mirror image of his own. “The letter you sent me–”
“God, you’re as bad as he is, aren’t you? Do I have to do all the work here?” Tony demanded, and then he was fisting a hand in Bucky’s t-shirt and forcing his mouth against Bucky’s, kissing him hard.
Ripping his head back, Tony gave a fierce shove to Bucky’s chest, forcing him back enough to get his mouth on his neck and sink his teeth into Bucky’s gland. Bucky tasted like sharp metal, the copper of blood, thick, delectable cream and –
Tony knocks back a second mouthful of scotch and cringes when Steve takes a step towards him. It’s not quite a flinch, but it might as well have been with the way that Steve’s face morphs into a grimace as he clenches his hands at his sides.
“It felt real.” Tony’s hands clench in the duvet. His shoulders shake, and whatever he’s seen has his heart pounding rapidly in his chest. “It felt more than real. God.”
“You never say you’re sorry, you know that? You have to know that by now. Not ever. I can count on one hand the times I’ve heard you apologize, and even then, nothing changes. You don’t do anything differently. It’s just empty words.” Tony’s lip curls back in distaste. “Empty words, empty promises.”
He’s missed sparring with her, verbally and physically. Natasha promises a dance of direct strikes and elegant, cutting subtleties that he respects and that keeps him on his toes. Of all of the Rogues, she’s the one he actually wants to forgive.
Tony shakes his head, incredulous. “What does that even mean? Honestly, Steve! I was never in a relationship with Captain America! It’s always been about you. Steve Rogers doesn’t have to be a coward. That was a choice
While he touches him, Tony never stops kissing him. Maybe between one kiss to the next he could reach inside Steve’s body and yank out his soul.
Steve feels himself crack, glass spider webbing outward and little shares tumble free onto the ground. But Tony isn’t finished yet, he’ll want him to walk across the glass until his feet are bleeding and push him down onto his knees to watch him crawl.
“Then you better not come,” Tony says simply, before he drops to his knees and swallows Steve’s cock to the base. He jerks forward as Tony sucks, holding himself back from thrusting into Tony’s mouth as his cock disappears into the sinful circle of his lips.
“God, did you go back in cryo with him or something? This takes slow-on-the-uptake to a whole new level Rogers–”
“Yes,” Tony says, tone bland to his own ears, “And maybe I’ll walk back. Or take the suit. I need some time.”
“Steve’s training ended earlier, and he wanted a day at the beach,” Tony says, waving them off with nonchalance.
Over and over, Natasha tried to force the life back into Steve’s body as Tony retched again, bringing up more seawater onto the harsh wood of the deck.
Tony had simply blinked in surprise, and then looked a little hurt. It wasn’t until later that Steve had realized that was Tony’s spectacular way of twisting the simple question into a comment on his Omega-hood; his lack of domesticity and nesting being a question of whether he was broken, or maybe not enough for the two mega-Alphas.
When the man wasn’t driving him up the wall, he was driving him half-wild with flirty comments that seemed to increase daily. They seemed to get worse around the time Steve noticed Tony’s eyes flickering over his ass when he walked by and the way he seemed to find more and more reasons to reach out and touch him these days.
In no time, FRIDAY had had a massive shipment of items from weighted blankets, to adult colouring books, to scent diffusers. She’d selected some inspirational quotes that were just on the right side of cheesy, contained in crisp black frames along the walls.
Steve’s not going to stop, so Tony cuts him off and aims to finish this. “I do have an idea. I do understand. Only I wish it was that I couldn’t stop seeing you on our wedding day. Fuck, I wish I couldn’t stop thinking about dates or kisses or the first time you told me you loved me. Are you listening? I would kill for that.”
When he gets home, Tony will tell him. They’ll come up with a plan and bring Barnes in, give him whatever he needs to feel safe and be whole again.
Tony stumbles into the room, tripping over his feet and the inconsistent rhythm pounding in his chest before he drops to his knees in front of Steve. Every part of Steve’s body is trembling, rattling around like shutters in a tornado and Tony can’t remember a time where he’s ever seen him like
Steve reached down to get a grip on his cock, resting hard and throbbing against his belly, and pleasure crackled along every nerve ending. He’d let Tony watch. He’d
Tony grins. “There’s only so much genius to go around and you’re looking a little worse for wear these days. Don’t sweat it.”
As far as Tony’s concerned, it’s worlds different than Clint, off gallivanting and luxuriating in family life on the farm for a couple extra days. Two more days of comfort than Tony’s been graced with, if anyone gives a damn.
“Hmm? What? Oh, uh, wagon wheels.” Tony offered distractedly, giving JARVIS a series of instructions that set the model spinning and twisting at double the rate, a rapid sequence of formulae appearing.
Steve doesn’t have a response to that, it seems. All he would have to do is admit it. Apologize in a way that was real. It might not change everything but it would be a start, enough to bring Tony to a grinding halt; a reason to tuck the papers away at the bottom of his suitcase and forget them for a time.
He dragged a hand over the soft red and gold material and was bombarded with a flurry of Iron Man images. Tony had truly been a genius, the creativity in his mind knowing no bounds and Steve had admired every mark of his suit, from the desert to the last.
Tony laughed, drawing his gaze when he licked his lips, glanced him up and down, and said, “I said we should just jump your bones.”
“Do you…” Tony trails off, his eyes flickering back up as he moves marginally closer, the tip of his tongue darting out to touch the corner of his lips.
“Are you listening to me? The end of the day. I mean it. I want flights booked, pardons issued, security privileges reinstated, the whole nine. Get Rhodes on it too, he can update the team and start preparing a training protocol.” Ross prattles off, incessant.
Tonight, things are different because Steve is halfway out of bed with his feet already on the floor before Tony wraps his fingers around Steve’s forearm and tries to hold him still. As if he could restrain the super-soldier if he didn’t want to be held down. Steve wants to go, to flee to some unknown black corner to lick his wounds in private while Tony sleeps, but it won’t change anything.
“Like you mean it.” Tony can’t resist goading him, licking behind his teeth between quick words. “Kiss me like you’ve missed me, soldier.”
, Tony thinks, because he doesn’t fight it, just gives the wizard the floor, watching with a mask of blanketed indifference when Dr. Strange speaks. The wizard talks in blunt riddles about a coming threat, greater than Earth has ever experienced, and the potential for the end of the world.
They’ve been treating Steve with kid gloves since the battle, tiptoeing around him in the same way he’d watched everyone tiptoe around Pepper. Maybe what Steve deserves is to be yelled at. Bucky’s never shied away from setting him straight before.
When he woke later in the morning, Tony was already gone off to the office, and he found himself tucked into the corner of the living room couch in the soft, late morning light.
A dark, uncertain thought creeps into the back of his mind, remembering how Steve had gazed out into the horizon only minutes earlier.
He can’t hold back the tears, eyes blurry, and Tony’s concerned face swims before his eyes. “Then, where are we? What is this place?”
“Suit integrity, 49%, Sir. The likelihood of you making it back to the surface with the Captain is only 15%. I have to advise you to turn back.”
He’d woken Steve slowly, hands roaming across miles of perfect skin, mouth tight around the head of Steve’s cock as he sucked him off with long, languid strokes. No need to rush.
“Nothing important,” Tony whispers back before he answers the rest of Steve’s anticipated questions with a tongue in Steve’s mouth and a firm grip on his jaw.
Steve is infuriating like this. In a perfect world, Steve would just give Tony the answer. There’d be no cause for concern because Steve has a tactical head on his shoulders and could provide Tony with the best plan of attack and a series of secondary plans if needed. It would be so much easier if Steve would just tell him what he thinks, because Tony knows he has an opinion he must be dying to share. He
“I know what you thought.” Tony ground out, opening wet eyes to glare at him. The sobs abruptly dried up and something cold and flat raced forward to take their place. It was worse, devastating. “You thought you’d just come home like nothing had changed and—” his voice cracked and Steve winced as Tony cleared his throat, visibly steeling himself, “—
“Steve, if you wanted to wrestle you could have just said something,” Tony teases, trying to shake him off his legs. The team groans in their ears, and beneath the cowl Steve is certain his cheeks have gone red.
Tony to watch, talking to him in that never-ending monologue and telling him what to do, how to stroke himself just right, the way that Tony would if they were there together.
No one follows him, so he makes his way down to the workshop where he locks himself in and pulls up the newest mark of one of the Iron Man gauntlets. The bottle of brandy in his workshop seems like a fitting afternoon treat, and he pours himself a generous snifter.
Would this be better or worse if Tony touched him? God, he might die if Tony didn’t touch him again soon. Right now.
It hits Tony abruptly that he’s not really sure. He’s happy, yes, blissed out and this is the best he’s slept in months. But there’s a lot that’s lying in wait, just below the surface, and Tony’d be a liar if he said there wasn’t still complicated layers of hurt, underlined with rejection and anger waiting to overflow. Some of it probably didn’t even belong to Steve, but it’s all there, swirling in the same gnawing pot of confusion.
There’s so much water under the bridge, so much Steve should say. He’s often wondered if that’s what these dreams are about: preparing himself for whatever comes next with a clear conscience and giving him an opportunity to apologize, to come clean, to make things right before he’s finally able to move on.
Peter, who had been in the process of tugging off his mask, flushes bright red and looks between them, alarmed.
“I do understand that. I understand that’s what you think, anyway. You wouldn’t have done everything because you didn’t do anything. Steve, you didn’t even scratch the surface, understand? You never even apologized—”
“It’s not,” Steve leans forward, rests his elbows on his knees and bows his head. “It’s not. I am sorry. So fucking sorry. For everything.”
It’s hard to know how to feel, his kid making friends with the Avenger’s own version of the Three Stooges. But for now, he allows it, enjoys it, even.
“He’s not feeling himself. I know him, better than any of you, once he’s feeling better, he’s going to want to—”
Steve all but growls, plastering his mouth to Tony’s again and drawing him more firmly into his lap. This time, when Tony rolls his hips, Steve thrusts up to meet him, his entire body trembling with something far more intense than lust.
There aren’t any more pieces left on the plate, so Tony plucks another clementine from the basket of fruit on the table and carefully peels back the skin. He separates it into two halves, laying one down for Morgan to pull apart before he peels off a piece from his own.
Tony shoves himself in between Clint and Scott, dragging Peter along with him which forces Steve and Sam into the other car. At least when they make their entrances, the tension won’t be glaringly obvious. Pepper is riding with them too and she settles her manicured fingers light on his forearm and squeezes every few minutes. Tony tries to count the beats between squeezes for any semblance of a pattern but finds none. He focuses on the lights on the ceiling and breathes
In his nightmares he belongs in Hell for all that’s happened between them, but if this is Hell, he’d stay. He’d stay here forever just to catch a glimpse of Tony’s body moving like liquid confidence, his bright eyes mapping out another genius invention.
“Never.” Steve’ll swear it again and again, every day until he dies. “Never going to stop loving you. Never going to stop wanting you. Tony, yes—” Steve groans, dropping down to nip where Tony’s neck meets his shoulder as one of Tony’s wandering hands makes its way into the waistband of his jeans.
Tony hesitated, a self-deprecating smile on his lips. “I honestly don’t think I could get rid of it if I tried. Not yet anyway.”
Steve doubles over from where he’s collapsed to his knees and retches onto the pavement. Natasha tries to wrap an arm around his shoulders but he shoves her off with too much force and sends her sprawling backward, not processing what she’s saying. What does it matter? What could she possibly have to say to him now?
Tony’d likened it once to the unnerving in-between he’d experienced in Afghanistan; time lost all meaning as night stretched on like the endless expansion in the cave and the sedation of the sleeping pills created a spectacular form of claustrophobia. A mixture of chemicals and the disturbing realities of his own mind.
“I really fucking missed you, Buck.” Steve says, stepping forward and wrapping Bucky up in his arms. He claps him hard on the back, holding onto him like he’s about to disappear again.
“Of course, that’s not what I think, Buck. I’m just saying—” Steve breaks off, abruptly realizing that he doesn’t quite know what he’s saying. But that’s definitely not what he’d meant. He’d only meant—
It’s a hammer to his fingertips, and Tony starts to shut him out. He closes the door where Steve can’t reach him, throws up the wall meant for everyone else. Everyone else, not Steve.
Steve clenches his hands into fists and looks down at his fingers. There’s no wedding ring. Where is his wedding ring?
Tony doesn’t whisper how he wants Steve to make love to him, possess him until Tony feels raw and home again. He kisses the unspoken words into Steve’s mouth and rolls against him harder, trying to spur him on.
“I’m trying to figure out what I’m missing here. Everyone else seems to understand. So, there must be something more that I’m not getting. That I’m not… understanding.” Steve speaks slowly, clipped as if he’s handpicking every word with hesitant fingers waiting to have his knuckles rapped.
“Hey Parker,” Tony’s plucking away at some wiring while Peter is watching sequencing FRIDAY has put together regarding limb attachment. “Have you noticed anything strange about Cap, recently?”
“Wouldn’t that be a sight? Tony Stark, stealing away with all our warm fuzzies into the night to build his Alphas a nest.” Clint crowed; his laughter contagious to those nearest him.
“Steve, what the hell!” Steve whips around to see the source of Tony’s distress. Five perfect fingermarks denting the hood of his vintage car. Shit.
When he tries to sleep, later, exhausting himself with an argument he’s probably had with Steve a million times in his head already, sleep actually comes. It’s soft and gentle, so unfamiliar after the months of barbed nightmares.
Shoving his other hand into the puppet, Steve cracked his eyes open and glanced down at the little Iron Man. The material was worn now, pilling and thin from too many tumbles through the washing machine. But it didn’t matter, Steve had his eidetic memory and when he looked at it, it was like looking right into Tony’s perfect, handsome face.
“All that’s well and good, Rhodey, but how exactly are we supposed to be a team again without trust? Without everyone on board?” Natasha aims right for the jugular, her question pointed and laced with a half dozen other questions she doesn’t voice.
He’d escaped after the birthday party, crying off some excuse about a last-minute project when Bucky had tried to corner him, and had crawled into bed sometime after three that morning only to roll right back out before dawn. Steve had caught him around the waist and tried to pin him in place, but he’d dragged the spare blanket off the bed with him and padded out of the room, wiping his eyes and on the hunt for caffeine.
tumbling from his lips in a steady stream. A benediction he would say every day for the rest of his life.
Tony surges forward and kisses him, spicy and sweet, deeper than Steve would have anticipated. Tony kisses with fierce determination and confidence, like Steve already belongs to him and this is just another way of staking that claim.
“Anyways,” Peter digressed, his own cheeks tinted, “have you guys seen my PJs? I mean, it’s not really a big deal or anything, but I could have sworn I’d left them here the last time I’d stayed. I would have packed an extra set.”
Peter shudders and goes limp, tears slipping out of the corner of his eyes. Steve feels him disappearing, even before he goes. There’s a snap second of horror where Steve knows he’s disappearing, just before Peter’s arm turns to ash between Steve’s fingers, and Tony pitches forward with a gasp.
Because this had to be a dream. There was no actual reality in which his own daughter had a relationship with Steve and he did not.
“If I still lived in the tower, I would,” Bruce replied with a yawn. “But I’m not getting out of bed and driving across town to tell you the same thing I can tell you over the phone.”
A secondary explosion rocked the ground, the force of it lifting the shield slightly and throwing Steve onto his back.
Tony decided he wasn’t going to take Rhodey’s advice and even entertain the idea of going after Steve. They had a friendship and professional whatever relationship that was perfectly good enough. Steve’s company was all he really wanted anyway, and he could get that without a relationship or dating/
“They’re coming, don’t worry about that,” Steve growled. “Was kinda hoping I’d have this room finished to serve them in. Or should I go to whatever supermodel’s house you’ve been staying at this week?”
As they hoisted Maria into the craft, Steve didn’t look at the floor where he knew a Stark Industries logo sat waiting for him.
Something twinged in his chest, but it was an emotion Vision couldn’t yet categorize. He was still learning, and catalogued it away to reflect on later, once he’d learned more of this world.
He felt a little empty. Because as much as Steve wouldn’t allow himself to admit it, a part of him had left with Tony.
Steve took Tony’s hand and stood, carefully putting weight on his foot. It stung a little, but the nanoparticles quickly adjusted inside the wound. He started to follow Tony out, but paused in the doorway.
There wasn’t anything he could say to that, because as scorching as his words had been, Peter was right.
Steve laughed—it came so easy. Everything good came far too easily when Tony was around.  He sipped his drink, watching Tony with fondness in his eyes as he scrolled through the tablet.
“You guys are right up here,” Steve said, heading up the worn wooden stairs toward one of his guest bedrooms.  The room was cozy, but it was the only other room besides the master that had a double bed. Steve had bought it for when Peter got married, but…well, he supposed this worked too. He set Tony’s duffel on the bed. “Right in here.”
Down the hall, Steve was sitting on the edge of Peter’s racecar bed, gently running his fingers through Peter’s freshly washed hair. Peter himself was fast asleep, one chubby cheek mushed against his pillow in the cutest possible way.
He let out a little huff, closing his eyes. He tried to remember what it felt like when he used to do this for real, relaxing his palms just slightly, letting his nose brush against Tony’s.
He crossed his arms, gaze wandering around the hallway of glass panels that allowed views into various meeting rooms. There were rooms for tracking new potential recruits, labs for experimentation, strategy and tactical centers—anything they could possibly need. It was important to Tony that they all felt safe here. Avengers Tower was owned by Avengers. The compound was their home base, but the hard hitters of the team still gathered here out of habit.
The grounds were the heart of the base. Despite the white, clean interior of the training facilities, the grounds were in the middle of nothing but dust, shit, and sand in the middle of Saudi Arabia. Once a powerhouse for its oil refineries, after they had dried up the place became a wasteland. America saw the chance and took it.
“With my internship at Oscorp,” Peter continued, “Every week I’m with him it’s going to take me an extra twenty minutes to get to work. And Harry and Mary Jane are close here, and I assume Harry and me will be working on a lot of stuff together…” Tony doubted it. Norman would have Peter working on the best of the projects. “So it’ll just be way easier to live here. And I don’t have a lab to work in at his house.”
Tony’s ghost was there, right in front of him, hands on his shoulders, fucking blue eyes just boring into him as he called his name over and over.
He owed Tony a thank-you. For raising their son and letting him pursue his dreams at his own pace. A young scientist already featured in magazines worldwide, but still in the same year of school as the rest of the people his age. Tony had really learned from his childhood mistakes to turn Peter into far more than a chubby-cheeked baby boy.
Steve narrowed his eyes, finally able to look at his son. “Peter, calm down right now. We can discuss this—“
And as Steve watched Tony explain how water that wasn’t name brand could have any number of harmful additives—additives that might as well be poison, Steve—he knew that this would be enough.
“Something you wanna tell me?” He couldn’t hide the uncertainty in his voice, and yeah, maybe it would sound like fear to some. To Steve.
Tony leaned his head back, his smile ticking up a little more. “And then I just let him in and I’m so happy. Like, I’m happy again. I thought I was happy waiting for you but now I really feel happy. I feel like I’m young again, y’know? I feel like—I don’t know. I feel great.”
“And I never had a problem with it. I mean that,” Steve said with a squeeze to his hand. “It wasn’t like you’d call every five seconds if you didn’t know where I was. I called you every night because  I--because I loved you and I wanted to make sure you were okay.”
Steve looked away. He could handle this. It was just a little drive with Tony. And really, they had been divorced for fifteen years. Bucky was being dramatic.
Peter, thankfully, hadn’t taken his father’s womanizing route in his romance and instead was still dating Mary Jane. Not even a year of college and a distance from Boston to New York had separated them.
“I don’t want you to wait for me, though,” Steve said, and he couldn’t believe the words coming out of his mouth. He barely knew this Tony—he’d been here for less than a week and now he was talking about coming back?
Tony laughed, stealing another quick kiss while he could. “I think so. But I kinda just like you, so I’m sure it would’ve happened anyway.”
He took a slow breath and his heartbeat started to spread out, slower beats. Easier to shoot between them.
“Francine, let Rhodey know I’m on the way,” he said with a grunt as he rolled out from under the car.
“No. I’ve spent fifteen goddamn years waiting for you to change your mind,” Tony snapped. “You are always my first priority. If you want to try again, I’ll drop Jackson. I’ll hate it, but I would rather have a second chance with you—I mean that.”
Taking a nap was so much easier with Steve in the apartment. Bucky still wasn’t used to wanting protection. He didn’t want protection. He could protect himself. But something about…something about sharing the burden made him able to relax so much more. His apartment was a tiny Brooklyn fortress. The government had “gifted” it to him in exchange for staying in New York. Bucky wasn’t happy with having a permanent address, but he had made enough preparations for an attack that he could at least sleep in the place.
“I know. Sometimes that worries me.” Tony played it of like a joke, but Steve could see the concern in his eyes, and maybe a bit of fear too.
Bucky blinked and he was back on the platform, Steve hunched over the table, his face buried in the crook of an arm.
A blaster materialized around his hand, and nanobots flowed from the reactor under his shirt, giving him a skin-tight bulletproof vest in a matter of seconds.
Steve wanted to meet this person—a woman, he guessed—just to see what he lacked that she had. All the years fighting beside each other, a friendship turned romance, all of that history amounted to a big fat nothing now.
In some ways, Emory filled the spaces Peter had left in him. Emory was just a kid. A kid who had been raised military and who had already been in Steve’s unit (though ‘unit’ was a loose term now) for four years. Emory had given up the possibility of a normal life, of a family. Steve wasn’t sure if his supposed military experimentation had been Emory’s choice, or if he had been the only candidate to fit the bill. Sometimes Emory faltered when his brain or body moved too fast, and his tendency for self-punishment left Steve to be the one to stop his angry fists and torn knuckles from hitting anymore concrete.
All of a sudden the strange man’s face seemed to change before his eyes, though it didn’t change at all. His mind just put all of the parts together and assigned the name he had spoken thousands of times in thousands of variations.
Tony’s lips feathered along his brow, then pressed to his cheekbones, his jaw. “I’m right here, Peter’s right here. That’s where we’ll always be.”
Thor was drunk, and that meant he was insistent. “What if I cast a spell to relieve the alcoholic properties?”
“You and me,” Steve repeated, hoping to drive that point home. To plant something in Tony’s mind as to why he might have suspected this was going somewhere else.
“I don’t buy the technology and I sure as hell don’t choose where I work,” Steve growled. “Trust me, I’m just as angry as you are. I just wasted valuable time and valuable resources rescuing a stupid little girl with a death wish.”
Rhodey frowned. “Slow down, Cap. We aren’t going to hurt you. And I promise you’re going home after this. I promise you.”
Tony lifted his hand, also sporting a band. His was the reverse: red titanium alloy with a vibranium stripe. “Yes, but I meant it when I said we have to clarify we aren’t married. I don’t want anyone think they’re getting out of this without getting a mega-wedding.”
There was the sounded of sneakers on concrete and both Steve and Tony looked over to see Peter rushing up the stairs. He paused at the top, his teenage hesitance for familial affection kicking in, but then he hugged Steve tightly.
He didn’t like this idea. His heart loved the idea, which was yet another reason why he should have said no immediately and left the restaurant.
“Oh fuck that,” Bucky said, and Tony detected emotion in his voice—almost desperation. “Peter hasn’t called Steve in way over a year. Not even for Christmas or anything. After everything Steve sacrificed—for both of you. You abandoned him. That’s fuckin’ cruelty. You had to know that’s cruelty.”
“Yes, it is.” Tony crossed over to him, grabbing a napkin from the table and wiping his lips along the way. “What’s up, Spangles?”
He heard a door open and tensed, waiting for gunfire, but then he heard Sam’s voice and allowed himself to relax a little.
Their conversation the night before hadn’t been anything special. Crashing on a deserted island hadn’t even been anything that would bring them closer together. Nothing new had really been exchanged between them. There was no cataclysmic event that tore them to their core like Steve had always been expecting.
Morgan gave him big puppy eyes full of concern, and damn if it didn’t melt his heart. He took her hand and gave her knuckles a kiss in promise.
He’d been one of the old-timers who had seen a spiking divorce rate as a parallel to immorality, even if he never said it that way. He tried to be open-minded, he tried to see how people’s idea of marriage had changed to let divorce be a viable option. Hell, he’d come out two years ago as a man interested in men, and he still hadn’t been able to accept that one.
His therapist said he shouldn’t compare himself to Jackson. She said it would only make his feelings worse.
He sat back in his chair, nearly falling to the floor thanks to how forward he’d been sitting. Approved. He hadn’t ever expected to hear those words, and he’d been too afraid to look into the next steps because that always seemed to guarantee failure.
Tony stood idle beside a lab table, staring down a piece of equipment that wasn’t functioning the way it was supposed to. A minor adjustment to the wiring should have resulted in a connection between the power source (low voltage though it was) and a light to flick on in the center chamber of the sphere-like piece of machinery. Instead, he’d gotten a whirring noise, followed by a grating noise, followed by nothing.
Tony’s eyes were soft. “I just wanted to say that…I mean, I know it doesn’t mean much coming from me, but I’m really proud of you. You, uh, you look happy.”
“No, no, Steve,” Tony said with a shake of his head that Steve couldn’t see. “Just a fever. I called her doctor and they didn’t pick up. I called Bruce, told him what was happening, he just said I had to wait it out. Wait ‘til it breaks.”
And that he was. Jackson Slade was in the same tax bracket as Tony, with a collection of companies that apparently rivaled the success of Stark Industries. But Steve wouldn’t have guessed it by looking at him—Jackson, despite his fancy tastes, was about the most humble person Steve had ever met. It was impossible to hate him.
“We could figure it out if you don’t want to sign,” Tony offered, as he always did. “They can’t come after us now, nobody agrees with the government interfering. The only opposition that would hold any weight is the other superhumans.”
Natasha pointed to a drone photo map of the little area. “He has a courtyard. It’s maybe four feet from the car to the front gate. We’ll be exposed for all of ten seconds.”
His hands moved to Steve’s hips, wary and unsure. He shook his head, though he let his lips brush the base of Steve’s palm.
Lying to Steve came so easily. It didn’t even feel like lying, and that made his stomach twist up on itself.
Steve let out a snort, and settled into the couch a little more. “Well you’re gonna have to wait a few minutes, ‘cause I just got comfortable.”
He glanced behind him before reaching over to pick it up.  A quick flip of the helmet revealed it was no model. It was a real, working Iron Man helmet.
“Those are things he needs to sort out himself,” Iron Man said. “You’ve done your part to help, Steve. You’ve gone above and beyond for him.”
Blaine moved onto his stomach and Steve squeezed in beside him, grimacing as the branches scratched at his face.
Steve’s lips pressed to a hard line. “You’re smart. I’m really impressed that you connected those two—“
After a few more attempts to free himself, he fell limp, barely registering the world as he was taken through the streets of Mykonos hooked in the arms of two of his best friends. He didn’t hear Sam, but he knew he would show up before too long. All three of them were going to become witness to one of his dramatic episodes.
“Did you think we’d ever get here?” Tony asked quietly as they admired one of Morgan’s drawings with a summer theme. She’d painted ice cream with drips of paint. “Walking through a gallery looking at my daughter’s art? Actually together with a kid?”
“Pops, c’mon,” Peter groaned, but Steve could hear the smile on his lips. “Okay, well I just wanted to make sure.”
“Candice,” Tony said with a smile, not moving from his spot beside Steve. “I didn’t know you were coming.”
Definitely not a Catholic church. He remembered a few times in the war when men had showed real fear—those rare and fleeting times of panic. If he closed his eyes he could still smell the acrid scent of spent artillery, the choking dirt and dust, the impossibly loud explosions that cleaved the earth all around. He remembered men praying to the Lord, or Jesus, or “Whoever’s Up There.” Screaming to live, screaming to die, begging to be good enough to find paradise. He remembered wondering if
“You know when Steve saw Peter last?” Bucky continued. “Seven months before your wedding. Almost four fuckin’ years ago.”
“I know we haven’t seen each other, Pops, and I’m sorry about that, but this was just supposed to be my weekend with Dad and Jackson, y’know?” Yet Peter didn’t sound very apologetic. “Maybe Dad told you this, but they aren’t going on a honeymoon. We’re going on vacation, ‘cause it’s my spring break. MJ’s coming too.”
Tony led him toward the living room and Steve felt hollow. His footsteps resounded in his ears with each step.
“Always good,” Steve hummed in reply, soaking in the sensation of Tony’s calloused fingers moving along his skin.
He tipped his head up, catching Steve’s lips in a kiss. This time he tasted sweet. The ache was gone, replaced by tenderness as Steve’s arms wound around him, hugging him tight. Tony moved against him, settling into Steve’s chest as he deepened the kiss.
“I have known Stark a long time,” Vision said in careful monotone. “And while he may make self-destructive decisions in moments of deep pain or weakness, he displayed none of those traits when he asked us this.”
“You know what’s best for you,” Iron Man said. He was still just hovering there, not helping the team and instead talking to him about his stupid personal problems again. “I think this is the right choice.”
Steve had forgotten what it was like to be the public’s plaything. A few photos of handholding with Tony and suddenly he couldn’t leave his apartment without being bombarded with paparazzi. He’d never understood tabloid press, and he definitely didn’t like them, but he understood that the photographers were just doing their jobs. It was the writers and editors that spun stories out of nothing—much like they had done in this case.
“Okay then, do you love me?” Steve asked, and he didn’t try to hide the malice in his tone. He knew the answer.
