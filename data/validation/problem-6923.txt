The other heroes in the headquarter were obviously worried about what was wrong with him, after all, he looked so bad and even the cheeky sayings he kept dropping no longer came as fast as a shot, as they used to be. They seemed tormented as if he would do everything to ensure that no one noticed what was wrong with him.
He felt the guilt that he had not even heard that twenty-four years ago children had been killed by his grenades. He knew it, that was clear. He knew that innocent children were killed in the war every day. But in the middle of a city? In the middle of a maybe even peaceful city?
Tony stared at him for a moment. Below him lay a man who had betrayed him and brought his friends and colleagues into an incredible danger. The people had died because Vision had not spoken earlier. Vision responded to Tony's stare and pulled himself up against the other's armor. "Take me to him," he said weakly, clinging to Tony.
"Henry Bolton has just reviewed Stark's records. Our nice friend here just dropped a GPS transmitter under the tree."
"The biggest problem we’ve got right now is that we don’t know who or what we are dealing with. The creatures obviously didn’t come from Earth. SHIELD agents are already trying to figure out what kind of aliens they are," he said, almost resignedly just looking at Natasha. "The fact is that it interacted with the mind stone. In recent months, we have been able to locate large amounts of energy all over the world more often, which then disappeared almost immediately. Agent Romanoff has heard of it." He pointed to her and Natasha nodded briefly and then spoke for herself.
“Friday," Tony shouted when he was finally alone. He wanted to ask a question but there was a knock at his door. Annoyed, the mechanic briefly closed his eyes, then wiped his face and tried to sit in a halfway upright position in the big bed. "Yes," he shouted and put on a fake smile. Rhodey opened the door and smiled in relief as he saw his best friend lying on the bed. "You look awful!" he greeted but then gently touched Tony's healthy arm and sat down in a chair by his bedside.
Tony could not finish his thought, because Steve carefully pulled him to him. Tony froze as the other pulled him into a strong hug.
Now all came up through this video again. In front of other people, he still managed to bury those emotions. But when he was alone, ...
, but the claws were too deep in his skin. Tony screamed loudly and the alien did so, too, but it did not let go. Sweat formed on Tony’s forehead as the mechanic kneeled on the bridge.
Tony looked at her. "I don’t know. Without authorized access, it's nearly impossible to turn her off, let alone to get that kind of private information."
"It’s not long from now," he whispered to the unconscious. "I'm so sorry, Tony, I'm so sorry. How could that have happened?"
"No, that's not me. You are predictable. You all are. Oh yes. I was even able to foresee Vision's stupid game. I knew that he would finally betray me today. I knew you would want to save him for his heroism."
"I'm not stupid, Rhodes. You can be the babysitter, if you want. But then please bring me my food and everything, too."
Tony had died because of him. He himself was responsible for the mechanic's decision, he thought. He shouldn’t have left him alone, they would have found a solution.
Tony's heart was throbbing too fast and he was sweating heavily, even if he was cold. Burkwill put his head into his hands, just for a moment. Just for a moment, everything was too quiet.
If you kill me, then I am with my children and my wife. Then my earthly life is over and I’ll see my family again, and I won't have to think about you monsters anymore. In any case, it will be better for me.
"I should -" Tony asked in surprise. Only then did he realize that the supposed rock was a suitcase that was just starting to suit him up. "What about Pepper?" He shouted in panic.
Steve made a frightened sound, but then their lips rested and fireworks seemed to explode in Tony. He paused for a moment, waiting for a reaction from the other. His heart was pounding almost painfully and the blood rushed in his ears with excitement, as he had not known in years. They were only a few inches apart, but Tony could still feel the slight smile of the other.
"That with Bucky really was not my idea!" Tony started again, but Steve only laughed and pulled the smaller one closer.
For the next ten minutes, Steve hit monsters as much as he could. He and the others, too, had gained new courage and strength through the arrival of Natasha, Rhodes and Vision.
He got up and took his jacket from the holder and reached for his glasses. He stroked his hair again. They would perform as a team today and they would have to be sovereign. His thoughts had not even drifted to Steve at all, but now he felt that throb in his chest again.
The inventor sighed. "Okay. Then I’ll take a look at that thing again. Dum-E, will you bring me a coffee, please?"
"I painted this one," she said, handing Natasha the thick paper with the pencil drawing. "And a day later I took these pictures at the point where I saw the thing."
By his own fault, he thought. They should have signed the contract together. He knew that he and Steve were the unofficial leaders, that everyone would either follow him or the soldier; there were hardly any other possibilities.
Since then the old man has worked in his own garden, isolated from neighbours and friends; he used to run a horse before it was being shot due to an illness. Nevertheless, he somehow had built up contact with SHIELD and offered them the top floor of his house if there was an emergency; he could not use it anyway.
Bucky waved. "Then we have to risk that. I know Steve. He'll look for Stark until he's sure he's alive ... or not." He was quiet for a moment. "But he wants answers. The team would break up without Stark
"Please don’t say you bring me something now. And I ate something!" Dum-E had brought him a banana a few hours ago after his stomach began to make uncomfortable sounds. But he could not take the time to eat something decent. Obviously, some Avengers had been attacked, and what happened in Norway could easily come to the US. His suit had to be ready.
Panicky Steve dug in the sand. The fear grew bigger and bigger as he just found more sand. Sweat gathered again on his forehead. "Please don’t. Don’t fucking do that to me," he murmured, almost looking like a dog searching for a bone. His hands slid through the damp sand, pulling out only this again and again. His breathing was much too fast now, and he felt stabbed in the lungs.
Young Kima was sitting a little bit lost at the end of the table, furiously pounding it with his pen. Peter Krum, who was sitting next to James, leaned forward to listen to the words of another mediator – a stupid and below average farsighted woman, widowed just two years ago. She complained about something she was not intelligent enough to comprehend. Peter listened, and James was sure the younger man must be bored because of her. He glanced at James quickly and then thumped loudly on the table.
"I heard from Rhodey that you are awake again! You're surely back in the workshop, but you didn’t call me. Do you know how much panic rose because of you?"
Dum-E came humming softly in his gripping arm, he held a bandage, which Steve took thankfully. He let out a quiet breath but clearly tried to hide it from Tony.
He knew Natasha didn’t mean to sound mean, and she was probably exhausted but her tone made him angry.
"He has done a couple of yards alone today. No help whatsoever!", his eyes sparkled with the tale and Tony buried his head in the shoulder of the bigger one. He was glad to see his boyfriend that happy. "And he thinks your idea of getting dinner is very good, Tony. He is very happy to be invited."
Tears gathered in his eyes. No, he would not cry in front of Natasha. She had not seen him weak yet, he was not allowed to change that now. His lips trembled slightly, but he was still staring at the screen on which another reporter was doing some analysis of the combat.
"Our mission has always been and will always be to save as many people as we can, just like we’ve done in Toms River. Like we’ve done with Anthony Stark, who was the subject of many questions."
Only after a moment did he realize that he was just under the bridge, bullets landed close to him and someone pushed him down again. Somewhere a man screamed and the shelling stopped for a moment, only then did Tony's perception clear up. Dragenbach knelt beside him on the shore and loaded a weapon that he must have picked up from the ground, and a shadow danced with a shield. Tony coughed and blinked again to clear his mind.
Steve didn’t move, but he knew it was true. Rhodey glared at him angrily, as if trying to get something out of Steve. The soldier didn’t know what he would have to do to prove he didn’t want to hurt anymore. It was clear that Rhodey did not believe he would care for Tony, but he wanted to prove him wrong. Nevertheless, he said nothing.
As the doors opened he lazily shuffled out of the elevator and went through the large glass door into his workshop.
Steve stopped in frustration and put his hands on his knees. "Fuck!" He shouted and shot a branch that laid on the ground with his foot.
Tony's eyes wandered to Vision. He did not know what he should do. He had used the situation to help the two agents, but as naive as it sounded, he had assumed Burkwill would release all the prisoners. Burkwill had judged him correctly.
“Between the pub and the hotel was a forest. A path led through it, and at this point, the forest was not so big, so I walked right through it. It was cold, but there was still no snow lying on the ground, it had just started to snow. I was pleased, you know, because of the flakes that were dancing and because my wife was still alive, and the worst was over and so on. Somehow, I slipped. I can still remember the pain. For two weeks, I had a bruise on my thigh."
The two attackers weren’t hurt, so they went directly into a next attack. Falcon, too, had attacked the brain and Clint shot one arrow after the other. With his huge hands, however, the monster struck out as if trying to fish the Avengers and the arrows from the air.
He saw out of the corner of his eye that Vision was straightening up and Natasha looked at him briefly as she changed places with Clint.
A shadow crept over the beach and Steve looked up. But there was nothing to see except a few clouds. Shaking his head, he let his eyes wander again. Suddenly he stopped. There was a cable! A little further behind was a red piece of sheet metal.
Now he opened the silent door and looked at the small package on the floor. It was barely bigger than a book and very thin. Tony felt his hand start to sweat with excitement. The last time he got a parcel, he found a letter and a phone in it. Steve squeezed his hand and pulled him two steps into the room. He bent down and looked at the package.
He added something, but Tony did not listen. His eyes searched the room as he considered what he would do in the next few hours. He certainly could not sleep while they were so close to getting the madman. Or getting caught by him. He swallowed.
He felt himself on the verge of panic attack. "You!" He shouted, putting all his hatred into the voice he dedicated to his teammate. "
He groaned briefly and Tony knew that it must be terrible for him. It had been Tony's fight and Steve did not have to be there, and yet the only person among them who was really in danger was his best friend. Tony felt bad. "I'm sorry," he wanted to whisper, but no words left his mouth.
While Steve tried to fend off three little monsters at the same time, he could see a bit of how Vision and Rhodey were heading for the brain.
Clint nodded to her. "The man wants us to find him. He knew he would leave us clues that would allow these conclusions."
"Please take your role in world politics seriously," Hill concluded, closing the hologram. She nodded to Natasha and Clint before looking again at Steve and Rhodey. "For Tony's sake."
"We were forbidden!" Scott interrupted in confusion, looking at the map Friday had projected across the table. Two points were drawn on it, probably symbolizing two planes, Bucky realized.
"Help ... help my ... my wife," he tried to ask the brown-haired. It did not take a second before the first hit hit his head.
As he passed, he grabbed another apple and walked back to the elevator he had come from a few minutes ago. Natasha watched him with raised eyebrows.
Rhodey got up. "Even if I still want to punch Steve in the face because of his decision, he's right." He stood next to Steve but didn’t look at him. "We have to search for Tony. He needs every help he can get right now."
"'President: 'Cohesion is important at those times' - a large Alliance with Russia and China in Sight?'" Restlessly, some of his people sat down differently. Burkwill waited a moment. He smirked slightly.
The whole time they had been working side by side in silence. Both knew that that was not the purpose of Steve's stay in the workshop, but they had nothing to say to each other. Or they had too much to talk about.
"Shit," Tony mumbled, steering his suit towards the two soldiers, who were probably in deep trouble. With his repulsor, he put down two aliens, but more of the things came crawling from all corners of the park. There were holes in the ground as the critters came rushing out of there. Steve and Bucky were pushed further and further in the direction of a tree. Tony wanted to fly in to get them out, but the aliens grabbed him and he had to dodge. He could not fly in from above because the tree was too old, too dense, for him to get through.
"I think you all have something to do. I'll talk to you all again tomorrow. Stay alert and watch out for information." Fury threw one more penetrating look at the Avengers before storming out of the room to do tasks that would cost him whole nights.
He should have done more in the last few months, he knew it now. He should have called Steve to make Captain America and his team return to the United States. He would have given them the new suits, then at least he would have fulfilled his tasks. Instead, he had just been hanging around, working, but not effectively.
Tony searched for something else. He knew he had to focus on something like this during such panic attacks. His gaze went down the hall, right across the room from the elevator. Normally Natalie would sit there, a corpulent woman, but with a huge heart. Tony had once seen her son at a high school event promoting a college. The woman often spoke of her child, her precious, who was now alone in life and soon would be twenty-five. Tony had often been able to talk to Natalie over the past few months, albeit sometimes over trivial things. He had come to appreciate her very much. Now she was not there, and Tony was very grateful that she had not watched his little uprising panic attack. He did not know what it was, but with his hand, he continued to run over his neck, and his nose scratched hard.
"I wasn’t there," he admitted and could not banish the frustration from his voice. "And that was a huge mistake every time again. But Tony, this is different. I'm here now, all of us are. And you won’t have to deal with this man alone."
"Rhodey, you got something?" He shouted to his friend. The situation was critical, they could not fight for a long time anymore. Friday had repeatedly warned him that he was still bleeding and it would soon be dangerous. But Tony could not stop.
"My legs are still working, Cap," Tony explained, moving ahead, but he was sure that would be an exhausting road. He was very happy at the moment that the painkillers worked wonders because the steps were narrow and high and he was sure that this could be exhausting even if you had no bruised ribs.
. He thought the bald man was a quite interesting person. He was not too dump and he certainly knew how to behave. The blond man annoyed him. He was stupid and evil, did not once thought about his actions. But he helped and keeping him close was doing good on James.
Steve just nodded, because now he had to act. More and more beings poured out of various gaps in the ship. The few government troops who had come behind them were firing at the monsters as best they could, and his team did what was possible.
Tony nodded, even though the other man could not see him. His heart throbbed with excitement as his thoughts rolled over. One of his comrades, of his
It was bad. And he always wished to wake up, and when that was the case, he wanted to fall asleep again because of the pain.
"Probably outside. The tomatoes are growing very fast, maybe she picks some", Natasha replied. "I came to see her earlier and talked to her. She was very happy about the invitation."
It made no sense for him to search for more information. The best SHIELD agents were set and Friday went on and on. But Burkwill had been careful. They could confirm the three states, but nothing more. At least the mechanic could use his arm again, and his ribs did not hurt too much anymore.
"Tony! You know what I meant ... If we know anything about the woman, I'll let you know, we'll go right then."
"But remember what he did to you, Stark. The risk he took was far too big for you to just set it aside. Stark, I want to give you a hint if you're still alive. From enemy to enemy." Burkwill grinned. Tony shuddered at the thought of how crazy this man was. He talked about probably dying and then grinned the next moment.
"Stop," he screamed suddenly, so loud that everyone heard it. For a moment, Tony stopped running, but Steve grabbed him and pulled him into safe hiding. "I have Vision," Burkwill continued. "Lay down your arms, or he dies."
"And where exactly is this brain supposed to be?" asked Clint. "The thing that keeps the ship going is not likely to be it, is it?"
Tony stared at his friend for a few seconds. He did not want to break his promises, but in the end,  he would have to meet him alone, Tony knew that. But at least for searching him, the others would help. He nodded. "I promise," he answered softly.
His hands put almost automatically many cables together in the next few hours. Concentrated, his gaze shifted between the new leg splint and the computer screens. The music played loud in his ears, but he only noticed it marginally.
There was a brief silence in the room after the presentation as the attendees processed the information. "And we can be sure of that?" Wanda finally asked, her accent stronger than usual.
"That Stark woke up is very good," Fury explained. "I’ll need to hear what you've been talking about, Rhodes. Today we’ll only explain that you all work together again and that Stark’s awake and that he’s doing well. We’ll completely refuse information about the aliens."
"Still not," Clint said. "But these monsters couldn’t have acted alone. They didn’t seem to be very intelligent. Someone must’ve hired them and gave them orders."
I messed it up. I was selfish, I really didn't think and I mean - like I... I almost killed you." His voice broke in the end and Tony just stared at him silently. He didn’t say anything.
The look of Natasha could have killed, but Tony had to smile despite the serious situation. It somehow seemed like three months ago. Rhodey said something and Tony nodded in agreement. They were fine. The grip on his shoulder grew a little stronger, and he realized that Wanda said nothing.
He headed straight for a cluster of smaller aliens. He loaded his weapons and fired, but despite the energy behind them, only one of the creatures fell to the ground. Tony chased past them to get a better picture of the situation.
He was glad to be finally able to go to the workshop but would have rather done it walking straight and with a bottle of good whiskey in his hand, instead of moaning like a child about pain that was kind of caused by him. The elevator drove quickly and silently down, and the security password was directly required.
He desperately wanted to turn around, but the monster did not let him. That could not happen, Burkwill had promised him something else.
"Tony!" He shouted, hoping the other one would hear him. As Steve looked over the fallen tree, a fox looked at him and fled straight through the undergrowth.
If Tony could move, he would tense up now. Barnes was there and he ventured to get close to him. Somewhere in his head he heard Pepper talking that none of this had been wanted, but he also heard his mother screaming, but much louder.Barnes' voice came now from the corner where Steve's voice had been before, right next to his right ear.
"Cap, the cockpit is empty," Clint said over the coms. "There has to be a place that transfers control of the ship back to the pilots."
"New York, then?" Tony asked to end the silence that was about to go over the elevator. He looked directly at Natasha. Steve was standing right next to the door, but he tried not to look at him. He only glanced at the man who studied him. He wore a white T-shirt and a leather jacket over it. The pants were wide and exactly the style Steve had three months ago.
The younger one looked at him silently. "But you have to trust us more. We could have helped you if you had said what happened back then, we - it doesn’t even matter," he interrupted himself and took a breath. "You have to get more involved with everyone. Steve and you, I rarely saw you say goodbye. You didn’t even look at him. Take care of him, Tony, I know that ... "
"It’s important that none of you seem nervous when addressing this very sensitive issue. I expect complete commitment from you. In addition, the government should see that they have done the right thing to free all of you from your allegations."
By now almost all the people had gotten up. Agents went to the doors, holding their weapons ready, Natasha had run to the big window and looked out. Vision stood in wonderment in the room and was pulled by Wanda to the side and Barnes looked petrified on the hologram while Steve had run to Tony. He quickly typed on his cell phone.
Tony froze. That was Steve. On the other side, someone let out an irritated breath. Tony tried to open his eyes, but they still didn’t obey. He wanted to shout something, but not a single sound left his mouth. The others had searched for him - and had found him.
"About forty-five minutes, sir," the AI said. Tony nodded. Definitely faster than a normal plane, he thought. It took less than two minutes and all the Avengers were fully suited on the plane. Only Rhodey and Tony did suit up.
He could still see Burkwill grinning. "I lied to you, Stark. Tomorrow is not my son's birthday. He became thirty
"Why?" Tony asked without taking his eyes off the track. "Is the TV broken? Did Vision make the kitchen burn? I'm sorry, I have something crucial to do right now. Can you give me that screw there, please?", he asked, pointing to a small piece of metal that had fallen off his table.
Tony could not back down when he bumped into a work table. The louder he screamed, the more the knot loosened in his chest, which had grown ever larger since the psychopath's appearance.
"They were travelling with a special force in Norway and Sweden. A few days ago, they messaged us from a town called Tromsø. They are apparently on the trail of a suspicious group, but they can’t promise too much. I gave the agents a strict ban on reporting via private cell phones or social networks."
"Can you do that?", he finally asked and pointed to the stairs and with the other hand on Tony's upper body.
"This conclusion is not in the files but seems logical. These beings had a spaceship, boss. According to SHIELD agents, the aliens aren’t smart enough to build something like that. And the ship must have been seen from New York at least on the radar, but no one has reported anything. Either the aliens can do more than we think or they came in a very unusual way to Toms River."
The others started to listen. "Even Rhodes is not present," Vision stated and Natasha nodded affirmatively.
In a sad attempt to attract attention, Tony tried to scream, but the cries for help were little more than a painful scab. He closed his eyes as the pain rushed through his whole chest again. He was thirsty, very thirsty. His arm and head began to hurt again; every breath hurt, he wanted to get away from here. He had known what would happen if he flew away with the alien, yes. And he wouldn’t have had a problem if that would have been his end. But now that he was alive, he wanted to continue to be so.
"Laura said, you and Steve, you should definitely come when everything calms down here. I think she would also like to have chopped wood again. And the tractor could also be looked at again," Clint addressed him and put his hand on his shoulder. Tony was pleased that "you and Steve" had come so naturally and nodded.
He was sure the others wanted to help, too, but he had to do it alone. Not only because he owed it to Tony also because the others should not act illegally. If only he went, the others could stay, only he would have to reckon with the consequences. They were not allowed to hear about it.
A small murmur went through the room and James could see the name "Hannah" in the symmetrical lines on the wall. His fingers drummed on the black leather of his chair.
"You’ve got something?" Clint asked over the microphones their partners, who were searching on the ground.
"Was she the security leak?" Natasha asked. Her eyes had been wandering attentively all over the faces of everyone in the room.
But the soldier gave an apologetic look to Tony at that moment and he knew that he was concerned about him. His heart raced briefly before he could calm down again.
, was still under water. The smaller aliens even moved back to him, their only job was to protect the brain. But Tony was faster. His repulsor took a moment to recharge, but then the energy beam struck the water and hit something. Several of the aliens on the water surface roared with pain, but then the larger head of the
"If you can go through the widths of the internet and break through some firewalls, so we can reach them? Or if you can continue to build my suit?"
And, as if nothing had happened, he closed the window again and Tony looked at the image of an island that formed the desktop wallpaper. He had to pull himself together, not to cry, as he stared at the ground below. Still nobody moved, they were all affected. They stood in silence until Steve reached out and gently placed his Hand on Tony's. His eyes stared for a few moments at the hands that lay on top of each other. He felt the warmth of Steve, whom he had already missed so much. He looked up into watery eyes, but then he tore his hands away and stumbled back a few steps.
"Maybe they discuss their issues?" Scott Lang asked from the couch where he had just analysed video footage of the attack.
Tony nodded to Steve and then turned back to the window. Behind the tinted glass, he could see the houses in the streets of Manhattan. In this part of town, the buildings were old and had not been renovated for a long time, but they were relatively cheap. A homeless man stared after the big car and screamed something the mechanic could not hear through the closed windows.
!" Steve said almost in unison with Peter. "Don't tell him that! He might actually believe you." He scolded.
Peter picked Sammy up and set him on the other end of the blanket, letting him stand on his own again before grabbing his hands.
Steve's eyes widened slightly at that, humming at the light sucking on his skin. He scooped Tony up into a bridal carry and walked quickly to the staircase, trying not to just run up the stairs.
He hopped up and sprinted down to the workshop, slowing down once he was out of sight. Tony shut the door and sat down at his welding table, using AC/DC to block Steve's prodding from his end of the bond.
"All right, I'm coming!" Steve laughed, following Peter along inside, paying their admission in and trailing the boy as they entered. "Where you wanna go first?"
Tony clicked his tongue and rolled his eyes, going over to retrieve the stroller and buckle Sammy in before turning back to them.
Tony yelped and rubbed his already sore ass, trooping down to the living room. He smooched Peter's forehead, gently tucking a blanket around the sleeping child before trudging back upstairs to his bathroom, more than happy to see Steve already in the steaming water. He stripped of his boxers again, sighing happily as he stepped into the warm spray.
Steve watched for the moment, still in slight shock and ghosting fingers over his lips as the kiss still tingled on his lips. A small, dopey grin started to grow on his lips, but he tried forcing it back.
"I know." Steve responded back just as quiet. "But that's what you told me. Then said I don’t deserve someone like you. But that is far from true, love. I just wanted you to know that."
Steve's hands immediately shot up to lace into Tony's hair, pulling the man close and into a deep kiss. He could taste himself on the man's lips and his lip hurt from biting it, but he needed to touch Tony. Needed to be connected.
Tony buried his face in the comforter, mentally ticking off everything he was being punished for; the tears didn't prick up in his eyes just yet, but he let himself be susceptible to the pain, and not the pleasure. Steve continued to swing the paddle a bit harder each time he swung, listening out for Tony's voice in case he was going too hard.
"Alright." Steve kissed back, standing up out of the water carefully. He grunted slightly as he stepped out, walking a little awkwardly towards the towel rack. His muscles were still fairly sore.
"Mm," Peter nodded, hair falling in front of his eyes, "I lub you too." He laid back down on Steve's chest, curling up into his warmth before falling asleep again.
"Ready." Steve answered back, taking Tony's hand in his. "We'll be back, Peter. Be good until then." He said, giving the boy a smooch as they headed into the garage to the car.
"I knows." Peter sighed, playing with the baby's fingers. "Don't mean I gotta like it all da time, dough."
Tony sifted his fingers through Pete's hair till the boy calmed down, gently wiping the drying tear tracks off his face.
"Do you wanna talk to him or me? Or give him space?" He asked softly, "He probably is upset, I just hope he doesn't think-- y'know."
Tony hollowed his cheeks as he pulled off, nosing at Steve's cock with a hum. Silently, he leaned up to capture Steve's lips, fumbling to the side to grab the lube from the nightstand drawer.
"Okay, bambi, thank you for telling me," He murmured, "I'm gonna go talk to Papa, okay? Go ahead and wash up for dinner. I love you."
"Peter, you know the tickle monster is my weakness. I just can't fight him off by myself." Steve said over-dramatically, falling over on the bed.
"Do I, now?" He said softly, grabbing gently at Tony's hand and bringing them towards the bed. "Care to show me just what all that is,
Sammy babbled up at Steve, looking confused when Tony popped a binkie in his mouth. He settled down on the walk home, quietly snoozing in the stroller once they got home.
"You're one to talk. I saw you hobbling around, James Buchanan. Quite surprised with you." Steve smirked right back at him.
"And I'd hope he still does." Steve's voice rang in as he entered the lab, looking at his boys before joining them on the couch.
"So you can't hear my thoughts," Tony murmured, a slight twang of relief in his gut, "Strange. You must be able to hear something else, then."
Tony curled up, hearing Steve's thoughts filter non-stop through his brain. He gave Steve an eskimo kiss, sucking in a breath as he started to relax.
Steve ground back with a groan, his pants starting to get tighter. Not yet, though. Not yet. He moved down Tony's body, kissing at the bare skin until he faced the black lace. Steve brushed against the bulge lightly, tugging the panties down to free Tony's cock and start taking it into his mouth.
"So damn sexy," Tony breathed, almost tripping over himself to get to Steve, "Please, officer, been such a bad boy, got in so much trouble today--"
"Oh, Honey," Raavi said seriously, "We are gonna make this happen.". And with that, he ran to the back of his salon to prepare some things.
what is going on, Buck." Steve scolded in a hushed toned. "Besides, how would I have known if I butt dialed you?" He sputtered.
The blond chuckled when they separated, looking over to Peter. "Now you aren't the only one sticky." He laughed warmly, turning to peck Tony's lips again.
"When he comes over, you lay on 'im and I'll lay on you and we can squish 'im!" He whispered, grinning proudly at his brilliant plan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter nodded, moving around in his hammock to give Tony room. When the man got in, the boy climbed up onto Tony's chest and laid down. "We gonna move my stuffs in here later?"
Peter sighed dramatically, dragging his stepstool over to the sink to wash his hands again. He dried them off and stepped down, hopping over to the couch to grab his discarded penguin and curl up into the cushions.
"Mmm, donuts," Tony mumbled, yawning before letting his eyes slip shut, easily drifting back off to sleep.
"How do you want me, love?" Steve asked with a gentle purred. "You want my mouth? Want me to work you with my tongue and lips?"
Tony glanced at Peter, who was still attempting to talk with a full mouth, glanced down at his own arm, then back up at Steve.
, as punishment, you have to help me clean your mess." He explained. "Daddy said to do it yourself, but there is a certain process to it that you'd have to learn. So helping will do."
Everything in his body slowly started to return to their normal rates. Tony's sense started to clear up and he could recognize his surroundings. He was in his bedroom, not snow. And Steve was holding him.
The boy mumbled a half-hearted apology before picking up a different crayon, still casting them suspicious looks.
I don't believe that for a minute," Tony tsked, "I get all these calls from the school that you get pulled into the principal's office. And you didn't think I'd find out?"
Tony frowned and shook his head, letting Steve go over to him. He scooted up onto the other kitchen stool to watch it unfold.
' all deh time, an'-- an' Gwenny says her parents yell lots an'--" Peter burst into tears, covering his face with his robe.
"Do you wanna go see if they'll let us watch a little while, then?" He suggested. "It could be sort of like when you were a kid?"
"So, do you like food?" Steve asked a little awkwardly, letting out a chuckle. "What I mean to say is would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow? I'm no Master Chef, but I think I do pretty well. I can make us something."
When Steve had walked into he and Tony's shared bedroom and saw his dress uniform laid out upon the bed, he was a bit curious as to why. When he walked up to the setup to find a note beside it written in Tony's hand, he was all the more curious.
Peter waited a beat to let his Papa settle before running out of his hiding spot, roaring as he jumped onto Steve's chest.
Tony sucked in a breath and waited for the reprimand for crying to come, but only felt himself sink under Steve's lips; he sniffled, weary-eyed as he turned himself back over to look at Steve. Tony opened his mouth to talk, but all he could do was whine softly, more shame washing over him.
He attacked Steve's neck, shoving him against the bedroom door. Steve grunted as his back hit the door, head automatically tilting upwards to give Tony more space. He was...conflicted? Was that the right word? He wasn't even sure what angry sex was supposed to be like. Guess he was finding out now.
"It's your birthday, we can do whatever you want to, Tony." Steve smiled softly at him. "Today's supposed to be pretty warm too, so a walk would be great. And I might get a bagel myself at that bakery. But yeah, we can go for a walk today."
"You don't really make it difficult to be, Tony." Steve noised softly, stroking at Tony's arms. "You turn me on on an everyday basis. You're perfect."
Steve peeked an eye open as he felt Tony shift, nose poking his chest. He nuzzled Tony's hair softly with a happy hum.
"I don't know, am I?" Tony could only grin smugly as he opened the top drawer desk, pulling out his glasses and slipping them on, giving Steve a look.
"I have a few. But I dunno if you're up and ready to go again," Tony teased, "You might wanna sleep some more."
Once Sammy was burped and rocked back to sleep again, Steve managed to wriggle under the blanket with his husband. He curled around him, wrapping his arms around and gently dancing his hands over Tony's chest.
"God. We'll have to get baby stuff then," Bucky sighed, screwing in his half of the hammock, "And take baby classes. Actually, I think Clint's still registered as a babysitter, so we might be good."
"I...I've never bothered to. But it’s only because there are so many lies out there, I don't want Tony to think it'll make me second guess everything." He murmured.
"Hi Samwich." Steve smiled back, smooching the baby's cheek happily. "We'll change you and we'll go see daddy and bubba, okay?"
"I think that's a great idea, Tony!" Steve called into the living room as he worked on making the chicken for dinner. He smiled hearing the glad giggles and laughs coming from his boys. This was the way he wanted it all the time.
"Hmm, then I have my work cut out for me, no doubt." He hummed working out knots and leaving soothing kisses in each spot he finished with.
"Yeah, have fun with that surprise while I work," Tony laughed, opening the bathroom door to a disgruntled six year old, whose jumper was on backwards with mismatched socks.
Tony tugged on Steve's hair, mewling into his neck. Steve moaned aloud from the tugging, soft and quick gasps leaving his lips as his hips bucked up into Tony of their own accord. His moans got quicker as time went on until he finally came, head lolling downwards and arms shaky as he tried not to fall onto Tony.
. Most of our first year together was me in bed with a cold, and him on top of the covers so he wouldn't get sick."
"We can worry about that, I'm sure. We can just cart what's need to your house when the time comes." Steve explained, screwing in the other half.
He got up from the table, making his way up to Peter's room. He knocked on the door, shifting foot to foot.
"Oh my god, we're going to get to have a baby!" He grinned, Hugging Tony to him. "A little tiny person. A tinier person than even Peter to take care of."
"Then we better get home before that happens!" Steve gasped back playfully, scooping the boy up as they left the store.
Tony whimpered into his kisses, slowly turning himself around and sagging against Steve, wrapping his arms around him.
"Another thing; You need to keep your baby blues on up here on your dancing partner, Cap. Not on your feet." Tony said with a chuckle, raising up an eyebrow slightly following a smirk on his lips.
Steve twitched out of sleep feeling hands rake through his hair, looking up with a soft smile at his husband.
"I know, feels good, yeah? That's called a 'drop'. It's probably the best part of a subbing experience," Tony explained, "You'll fall asleep, okay? Let your body readjust. When you get up, we'll play some more, alright?"
“If you think he is implying that werewolves are involved? Then yes he is.” Tony answered, setting his plate of breakfast down and looking carefully at his team members to gauge their reaction.
Steve reached into his shirt for the chain around his neck. Attached to the chain were a set of dog tags.
"Growth spurt? Puberty? Whatever you wanna call it, it just hit me the summer before my senior year. Coaches wanted me to play, but I still was dealing with a little asthma and didn't wanna risk having an attack on the field. I would doodle all the time in class for years, so my freshman year I decided to join the art club since they actually would take me as a member. I enjoyed it immensely and I've been at it ever since.".
"See? All done," Tony murmured to the boy, bouncing him slightly as he walked back to his bedroom, "And Papa's waitin' for you."
"Can't sweep dere by mahself." Peter said softly, curling into Tony. "How come you 'n Papa is sad? Is it cuz ub wut I did?"
He finished the sentence with that, standing quietly to clear his finished plate and offering to take Steve's and start on dishes. They weren't at that level yet- that probably wasn't a thing where Steve was from- and Tony almost let the B- word slip out of his mouth. I mean, they certainly had some form of chemistry and kissed a few times, but that does not a romantic relationship truly make. Maybe after a while longer, but not yet.
"Shoosh," Natasha quipped after smacking Clint again, "Eat quietly." She sighed and gave Steve an apologetic smile.
"Okay. But if it gets to be too much, let me know okay? Then we can watch something else." The blond sighed, turning back towards the movie again.
The blond cupped the brunet's cheek and pulled him into a kiss, soft and tender, expressing his thanks. He pulled back and rested his forehead against Tony's before speaking again.
Tony stirred in his sleep, waking with a jolt next to Steve. He took a careful breath and slowly relaxed his hands from his boyfriend's shirt, trying to settle himself down. He nudged Steve's chin with the top of his head, pressing kisses to his bruised collarbones.
Tony stumbled toward the kitchen, and finding his prize, made his way back to the bedroom, hissing at the cold on his welt.
"Tony--" Steve said in a sing-song tone, but it sounded a bit threatening. "Now I know that is a flat out lie."
"I know you are gonna be a good boy. We'll miss you, but we'll be back before you know it, okay? Love you, munchkin."
"Well now you know one of the reasons why we say not to run in the house." Steve said softly as he stood.
"I say that sounds absolute perfect beyond perfect." Steve giggled, leaning in to capture the lips. "Spend some time in front of a warm fireplace, doing whatever we want--"
He bounced Peter as he carried him up to the art room, grabbing one of Steve's unused sketchbooks and some pencils for them to work with before sitting on the floor.
." Steve chuckled. "It’s a little weird, but it works out. Efficient, I suppose. We don't have to if you don't want to."
"Once you're done, go wait in the car. I'll be out in a few minutes," he hummed, kissing the top of Steve's head while he passed on his way to the stairs.
"That's what you've thought?" Steve whined softly, helping Tony out a bit. "You flatter me, Mr. Stark." He murmured, reaching under Tony's shirt and skirting fingers along his chest.
"Today was ex'saustin'..." Peter mumbled sleepily, snuggling his penguin. "Walkin' and cryin' and bakin'... Its hawd work..." He yawned softly.
"He took a bath, got changed, and immediately asked me to read to him my thesis on the possibility of Artificial Intelligence that can learn," Tony sighed, "He fell asleep by the second page."
Tony nodded in agreement, gently setting Sammy down so he could still chew, standing on cracking knees.
"Of course, baby..." He whispered, kissing Tony quick before heading to get the bandages. He cleaned up the wounds carefully and wrapped the bandages around Tony's wrists.
." Tony grinned, stopping Steve once he got down to his boxers. "You're so gorgeous. I don't even know how I landed you. Like, really." He pushed Steve towards the bedroom, shutting that door closed.
"Then we'll just have to get to know each other then. The project isn't due for a couple months, so I've got time.".
"I wouldn't be opposed to that. As long as you let me do the same." He stated softly, lips against Tony's cheek. "I'm so glad I waited for you. I love you. Very, very, very much." He chuckled, continuing to outline.
"Love you, too. So, so much." He whispered back, noising at all of the kisses and touches. "I don't know what I would do if I had never met you." He ran his hands along Tony's body carefully, touching every bit he could lovingly.
Tony scrabbled at his pillow and moaned loud and unashamedly, reaching up to thread his fingers into the hair at the nape of Steve's neck. "Please, please sir, move, I can't take it anymore," He begged again.
"I really love him, Steve. I don't ever want him to have any Christmases like my childhood ones," Tony murmured.
The brunet crawled back up and was leaned forward between Steve's legs. He wrapped his hand around Steve's cock and helped stroke along with the other. Tony leaned in to find where he had placed the hickey on the other's neck and latched on once more. He gave one good suck at the spot and one good twist of his wrist, and he felt the blond come under the touch with a loud, broken moan.
The blond nodded. "Yep. It’s how they explore at his age since he can't crawl or walk or talk just yet." He explained gently.
"I don't know how sorry you can be, Stevie, given what's pressing into my lap," Tony hummed, jostling his knee to rub against Steve's cock, "You sure you're not lying, boy?"
"I never tried to go out and learn to dance because both Peggy and I said we were waiting for the right partner." He said quietly.
"It’s winter. It’s gonna be cold, buddy." Steve explained, helping Peter dry off. "That's why we are putting you in warm jammies and under warm blankets so you don't catch cold. It stinks to be sick right around and on Christmas, trust me."
"We need to get the house ready. Open doors and stuff. They're insanely efficient, it's scary," Tony mumbled, pulling back to look up at Steve, "They'll be here within the hour, so we should start planning where we want things."
"You are very welcome." Steve grinned back at him. "You are a very good boy, mostly, and very sweet. The tantrum last night was a little naughty though, but all kids get a bit upset.”
Peter gave a noncommittal noise to which Tony laughed again, shaking his head as he left to find his wallet and keys. Steve looked to his boys with a hum after Tony left, finger still being chewed and arm being tattooed.
"Shut up and fuck me good," Tony breathed," tangling his fingers in Steve's hair, "I wanna be hobbling and covered in bruises. Get the crop if you want, I don't fuckin' care, I just need you in me in the next ten minutes or I'm going to
The blond looked up from his sketch and looked over to Peter warmly. "Of course you can, Peter. What's up?"
He leaned down to kiss Steve's temple, moving to pull on boxers and sweatpants before returning to Steve's side. The blond automatically moved to Tony when he made it back in the bed, latching onto the man with his arms and nuzzling his neck before falling straight asleep.
"Lemme know when you's talks about things I can talks about," he frowned, slipping off his booster seat.
"Oh no, I'm not leaving without a kiss," Tony frowned, leaning over to Peter to smooch his temple, "Be good for your Aunts and Uncles, Petey. Papa and I'll be back soon, don't worry."
"Let me take it out of the oven so I don't burn the house down first, huh?" He grinned, moving to the kitchen.
"We need to start wrapping things for him," Tony murmured, "I got a few other things from Santa, y'know?"
"I'll take you out for seafood date nights," He hummed, bringing Steve's hand up to his lips to kiss his knuckles, "You won't go without, honey, but we'll have to keep it away from mister allergic."
"Yeah, I'm fine. Just excited." Steve said with a smile, heading into the bedroom and setting the bags down.
"Compromise is better than nothing, bubba." Steve answered softly, laying back on the couch with Peter. "JARVIS? Queue up Terminator for us, please. But can you sort through some violence, please?"
He was trying to keep himself from getting too attached, but he knew it was already too late for that.
He gave Steve a quick kiss on his lips and cheek before going up to Peter's room, trying the handle to see it locked.
"Didn't mean to startle you awake. Tried being gentle." Steve murmured, looking up at his husband happily, "You were resting so well, didn't want to wake you. But we are on a bit of a time crunch..." The blond said bashfully.
This time when he wakes, Tony doesn't jolt up. He lays on his back in bed, breathing heavily but responsive. He yells up at JARVIS to "not notify Captain Rogers". The AI complies and Tony gets up on his feet. He dashes out of his bedroom and down the connecting hallway, determined to stop these nightmares once and for all.
Steve nodded picking up the paddle. "Okay." He whispered as he ran the paddle softly along Tony's bottom. "Bend over, please."
"At the end of the semester, you are to pack all of your things and get on the next plane to California, back to your mother." Howard spoke in a grave tone. "You will not be allowed back here at the college or on the campus.".
"You like to think that sometimes, Tony." Steve chuckled before hearing Sammy fussing in the other room.
mouth..." Steve panted out, whining slightly at the loss. His body was slack against the desk, keeping himself standing.
He used his leverage to thrust up into Steve, relishing in the sounds of moans, skin on skin and the squeak of the mattress.
"I mean, I'll be able to help him through elementary and middle school. Once we get a groove going, I think I'll be okay taking the bulk of the work." Steve explained. "But once he hits high school work, with algebra and physics, that's all you. I can probably do the history and English subjects."
Steve groaned, feeling Tony stroke him and hearing the huskiness of the man's voice. He trailed his hands along Tony's sides, moving his thumbs up to flick softly across the nipple rings.
"...I can't believe I never noticed those. I'm sorry." Steve said sincerely, reaching to pet at Tony's hair. "You don't... You don't still do that, do you?"
"You're weekends, I'm weekdays. Perfect," Tony laughed, going to the coffee maker, "Sounds like a plan. Write it in the itinerary."
Tony nodded and sniffled, slowly sitting up as not to get dizzy. He leaned on Steve and sucked up his warmth while trudging up to the kitchen, stomach rolling at the thought of food.
"Mh hm, standing there thinking of what you're gonna do next. I know that look. I see it on your daddy too much." Steve explained, keeping his eye on Peter.
"Don't think there is anything else for now." He confirmed. "I think this is enough to try out for now and see where things go from there."
blow anything up--Tony went over to his and Steve's bedroom, kicking off his shoes before cuddling up next to Steve. He put the laptop in his lap, staring with 'Tony Stark' in the google search bar. He sighed at the results, deciding to go for Google Images.
"What?" Steve asked curiously until he stepped in front of the mirror, flush crawling down his body.
"Hey. We're in this together," Tony shushed, squeezing Steve's hand, "C'mon, I'll hold your hand while we walk in."
"If you wanted to, what you could--" Steve stopped, covering Peter's ears for a second. "What you could do is try both at once and keep the dad a mystery, if you really wanted to, anyway." He explained quietly, uncovering Peter's ears.
Steve moved everything out of the way and scooped Peter up quickly, shushing him softly to soothe him as he carried him up to Peter's room. "It’s okay, it’s okay bubba. We'll get you cleaned up and in clean clothes, okay? We'll be alright."
"Its always in the snow. Absolutely freezing. During a memory when I still had the ARC reactor. I would find you in the middle of nowhere, but you were absolutely
"Steve, if I fully let you into my bond, you're going to constantly feel what I'm feeling," he whispered, leaning against Steve's chest, "You're going to know
A small beeping noise started to come from Tony's pocket. He pulled out his cellphone and the beeping stopped. As Tony unlocked the screen, the voice of an older English gentleman emitted from the phone.
"Merman. He is clearly male." Tony corrected, pulling up a screen with video from his face plate. It was from when Steve had it in his grotto, the merman swimming around his collection happily. "This is him before, by the way.
"You're as cute as a button, oh lord," Tony laughed, putting the stopper in before turning to help Peter, "Here you go, bud. Shoes first."
"I'm still amazed, myself. Of course, neither of us liked to leave our apartments all that often, either." Steve responded, wrapping arms around Tony's waist and holding the brunet on top of him. "But I'm so glad we had met. So,
Peter eagerly grabbed his penguin and his new box of crayons and drawing pad, following the pair down to the workshop.
Steve shook his head with a chuckle. "Maybe, but there is no way he could've know we were soulmates or anything. How could he of?" He explained.
Tony stood quietly in Steve's arms, not really wanting to return the hug: he felt disgusted with himself, more guilt prickling on his skin. He let Steve hold him for as long as he needed to, staying in his own thoughts.
The brunet sighed, letting his slacks fall back to the floor and turning to shoot Steve an amused smirk.
much. And we love you just as much. And if we all don't love each other, it would be nearly impossible to find someone with as much love." Steve explained earnestly, giving a small smile.
Tony kissed Steve's spine, gently prepping him before sliding the vibrator in, making sure to nudge his sweet spot.
Steve waited until Tony was in the shower before speaking with the others, letting them play a bit with the baby.
"I can go get you a warm blanket and get you covered. I'm sorta wide awake now." He said softly. "I could let you sleep a little longer and I can go finish up on the mural and start cleaning a bit? Make some coffee for when you're up?"
"I don't wish for a different soulmate. You are the best one I could have had." Steve said sweetly, kissing Tony's lips. "You are just what I deserved, Tony. I could think of no one better. And if you don't believe me, you can hear my thoughts to be sure, I'm positive."
"She...what?" Steve asked, a bit surprised. He knew that soul mates were getting far and few behind, but he didn't think they were just gone. "Why'd she say that, baby?"
"What's this about, Peter? What did we do to get you upset like that?" Steve asked earnestly. "We were having so much fun just before that. Now you're acting like Daddy when he would get into one of his moods."
"I did." He replied, loving how Tony blushed. "I heard from Steven's caretaker what you two had been doing at school, and I am very disappointed in you for it."
attune to the differences, Steve Stark-Rogers," He giggled, "But I'm always up for the conversation."
"Did you laugh, Sammy? Was Daddy being funny while bubba and I was gone?" He asked quietly, sitting down with the others with Peter in his lap.
"Now, you are going to staying laying against this. And let me do as I wish." He stated. "You have the right to remain silent, but noise is greatly appreciated. But you are to inform me of anything that is not enjoyable for you. Do you understand these rights spoken to you?"
"Don't tell me I don't pay attention to you. Who do you think payed for you to go to MIT? For you to go here?."
"He's got one guy, Bucky. Dude's got a metal prosthetic, awesome as hell," Tony replied cheekily, putting the boxes on the floor before trailing after her back to the van, "I dunno if he's poly, though. I'd have to ask."
"I won't apologize, Sir, you really are fine to look at," Tony murmured, "I can't help but imagine what it's like to ride you, Sir. You're
They both slept throughout the night soundly, Steve waking quietly just before sun up. He peered down over at his husband lovingly, small streaks of the rising sun landing gently on Tony's sleeping face.
"He'll learn all these things soon enough. But you can't keep him completely clueless forever." Natasha added. "Just take it small bits at a time of what he is exposed to."
"We should probably talk about punishments, since he is at that age," Tony said quietly, "So we're both on the same page and stuff."
Before Steve could finish, Tony had gone. He sighed, but complied, carefully slipping on some pajama pants and changing out the sheets on their bed.
"Why did you run into the table, silly boy?" Tony crouched down next to Peter, brushing the tears off his face.
to warn Steve about, crashing around his shoulders in suffocating tendrils, completely taking him under.
"As for occupying, I can take him out for a Father/Son day of our own." He suggested. "Go to the park for a while to play in the snow before it melts, go out for cocoa, and just spend the day together."
"Always good for ya', baby," Steve hummed with his accent coming through. "Always good..." He yawned sleepily, shutting his eyes and snuggling close to Tony and falling instantly asleep.
He turned around to see a strong blonde, arms crossed in front of him and a slightly irritated face. He was wearing a partially put on dress shirt and an untied bow tie around his neck. Tony didn't really pay too much mind to it though.
"Maybe. But Dr. Frankenstein stole from the graves. Because it was less suspicious." The blond stated. "Why would our suspect risk being caught with such evidence left behind? And why would those parts be the only ones important from Mr. Wilson here?"
"Point." Tony left his stuff where he stood, flocking down the stairs to pull on his shoes, a hoodie, and fingerless gloves.
The next few weeks flew by; the lab was completely covered in grease and sweat, hard work and frustration thrown into upgrades for Dummy, new projects, and tinkerings for his AI system. Another 2 AM binge had Tony awake and covered in oil, blinking rapidly at the clock next to his computer. "Just another hour, then bed," he muttered to himself, eyeing the birthday messages already filtering onto his phone.
When Steve woke next, it was later in the morning. The spot beside him in the bed was cold, so Tony had to have been up for a good amount of time.
"How the hell did this escalate like this all of a sudden?" Steve breathed, looking down at Tony and leaning with the man's touches.
"I'm still sorry, though." Steve said quietly, watching Tony carefully. "I'm sorry that I made you think that was all about what you told me. I just--" he sighed, running a hand through his hair. "You're all I have left. And I don't want to lose you. Not over something like this."
"That's our cue to leave," Bucky said with a laugh, watching Clint sullenly follow Natasha, "Have fun, you guys. Call if you need anything."
They trooped back down to Peter's room, Tony not at all surprised to see the boy cleaned up and sitting on his bed.
"Mm-hm..." Steve hummed, shutting his eyes and settling back into the bed in the blankets. "'Night... Love ya..."
"You haven't called me that in quite a while..." He murmured, keeping his face into his husband's neck.
"It's going to be a lot of talking and stuff, you know that, right? He's gonna ask why I'm there, and I'll-- I'm going to explain everything, and I'm probably going to cry," Tony replied quietly, "He'll ask you questions, and ask me questions--" He took a deep breath, squeezing Steve's hand again.
"He's been through a lot," She murmured, putting an arm around Clint, "I'm sure he'll give you details. We didn't really know until Clint walked in by accident."
"They're donuts, Tony. It’s not too bad once in a while." Steve grinned as he ruffled Peter's hair. "Plus he was extra, extra good for his Auntie and Uncles. He earned it."
Steve continued to smile to himself, waiting until he heard both Peter and Tony's soft snores before letting his eyes fall. He let the gentle breaths lull him until he was asleep with them both.
Steve took Tony in his hands with a smile, carefully pumping him in time of the rhythm of his fingers; In, Out, Up, Down, In, Out, Up, Down...
Tony nodded and slipped in a third finger, spreading him apart much quicker. "You're already so loose f'me, babe, been playin' with yourself when I'm not around?" he murmured, pulling his fingers out to slick his already hard cock up, positioning himself under Steve. Tony massaged his thumbs into Steve's hips before pushing in, resting so Steve could take time to adjust. Steve's eyes fluttered shut for the moment as Tony pushed in, trying to keep his breathing slow as he adjusted.
"Well I'd hope they'd be controlled. I didn't mean you could outright beat me up, stupid," Tony laughed, kissing down his length, "Now
He leaned down to press kisses on Steve's inner thighs, gently nosing at his cock before taking him into his mouth.
Steve cleared his throat anxiously, lounging back on their sofa. "Um, let’s see where we can continue... Ah! Um, seven letter word meaning to part two ways?"
"Well, that kind of killed the mood for a little bit. Just when we got to the good stuff. Worry is always a buzz kill. Sorry." He sighed, feeling bad for working himself up over Tony's breathing.
"Universe decided to play nice with both of us in that regard, I suppose." Steve smiled softly, backing up as Tony pushed him. He fell onto the bed as the back of his legs hit the side, looking up at Tony from that position.
"Mmhmmm," Tony hummed around his muffin, swallowing it, "Poor thing. We'll get you baby food soon, sweetie, just as soon as the Doc okays it."
"I.... can't," Tony managed, hiding his hand under the blanket, "You can come in, though, and it’s unlocked."
Steve leaned up quickly, looking to Tony apologetically. "I’m sorry. I forget that I'm bigger, sometimes," He admitted, "Want me to grab us towels?"
"There will be sleepless nights, no doubt about that, but you'll love him regardless." Sharon added. "May not seem like you will just yet, but it'll be there. And he'll love you back."
He trooped up the stairs, not surprised to see the boy curled up in his hammock with one of his new chemistry books.
now and not the other way around-, Tony relaxed into it, body leaning closer for more of the comfort Steve was currently exuding.
of stress. And too much isn't good for you. Not in the same way too much chocolate isn't good for you. The bad way." The blond explained as eloquently as he could. "Can't be totally silly all the time like Uncle Clint, but you can't be too serious, either."
"Um...?" Steve stared back a little lost from the action, eyebrow twitching upward in a questioning movement.
He heard a voice call to him, but couldn't think of who it belonged to at the moment. It continued to call to him, and arms wrapped around him in a way to try and calm him.
"What am I gonna do with you?" The blond said to his husband fondly, shaking his head with a chuckle.
Sammy babbled at Peter and crawled over to him, grasping at his ankles to pull himself up, wobbly as he clung to Peter's shirt once he stood.
Nervously, he nodded, gently accepting the baby into his arms. Like he was taught at class, he kept the baby's head supported on his arm, cooing softly at the fussy baby.
"Yoga. Meditating. Something to try and ignore the noise." He said softly. "I may work in that sort of business, but it’s weird to hear friends getting down and dirty."
Steve gave him a sympathetic smile before heading downstairs to make the soup. He came a few minutes later back up with the soup, some juice, and crackers, setting the tray on Tony's nightstand.
"Papaaa, I can't find m'sneakers!" Peter yelled, pouting as he stuck his head into the nursery, "Ew. Babies are gwoss."
"Dang, you eat a lot," Tony laughed, diving into his one piece, "Got enough for an army there." He moaned loudly at his food, "Oh my god, Steve, this is
He stopped when his eye caught two packages on their bed; with a wry smile, Tony picked up one, chuckling.
"I'm just playin' with you, Petey," Tony hummed softly, rocking Sammy in his arms, "I didn't mean to scare you, pipsqueak."
"Oh my god," Tony rolled his eyes heavenward, shaking his head, "I regret showing you that movie, I regret Bucky
Tony grinned and held the boy down until his face turned red from laughter. He leaned down to smooch the boy's nose before pulling back, watching Pete gulp down air while he giggled. Steve watched with a smile when things calmed down, using that to drive away the last of his nightmares.
"What are the things you think about that are more interesting than my history lectures?" He asked gently. "Is the way I teach too boring?"
Tony just sighed and cuddled the boy closer, pulling his arms into the sweater to wrap around Peter.
"Don't let me come, Sir, please, wanna last y'a long time," Tony breathed, taking the opportunity to crawl back from the edge, "P-please, Sir--"
"Yeah, you three made a nice pile in my guest house, if I remember correctly," Tony drawled, "Only Buck was the limping one, right Bucky?"
"I get ahead of myself. I'm afraid if I don't plan it now, something could go wrong. I guess I just overanalyze things too much." He hummed, resting his eyes. "I love you, Tony. I love you so damn much. Always remember that, you're perfect..."
"Well yeah. I'm just surprised he picks up on it so fast." The blond said, smoothing Peter's hair. "He might want to stick to just blowing kisses to Peter, though." He chuckled.
"He's got your eyes," Tony mumbled, keeping Peter close his chest in the slight breeze, "And your color hair."
"We might as well go in. Besides, it's chilly," he grumbled, wrapping one of the blankets around himself and grabbing a pillow, "Let's go cuddle in our warm bed, and not out in the bright light."
He immediately dashed for the pile of plushie around the store, carefully selecting his victims to take home. Steve smiled at the boy's reasoning and giggled at the half boy-half plush mound that was running back to him near the cash register. He picked off the penguin covering Peter's face, giving the boy a grin.
Steve nodded again, slowly standing up to get out of the tub and dry off. He leaned against Tony for a moment, kissing his cheek. "Then we'll go see the house?" He asked softly.
"Mhmmm. Really weird," Tony hummed, grabbing the tiny bucket to scoop up water, "Close your eyes, honey."
Natasha flicked him a look before opening the first of her gifts, smiling fondly at the nesting dolls wrapped in tissue paper.
"Still stuffy and hot." He murmured, rubbing sleep from his eyes. "I don't get sick too often anymore, but when I do, it hits me hard..." Steve hummed gently, leaning into Tony's touch sweetly. His skin felt nice and cool against his face.
"So needy, hm? You want me to fuck you, but you want it all to last." The man hummed sweetly. "How do you propose we sort that out?"
"Naturally, I was the one to make sure it was done correctly." Natasha chimed as she came into the area. "The boys will be plenty safe. I promise you."
He sunk to his knees to press gentle kisses on the inside of Steve's thighs, nudging his cock through the panties.
"You do. But you like to spoil him. He's someone to spoil." Steve grinned over at him. "I recall you being adamant of spoiling me when we were dating. In case you forgot."
"Peter, love, shhh baby, calm down." Steve soothed, brushing the tears from Peter's face and kissing his cheeks. "We wanna know what's wrong, baby boy. Why'd you feel you needed to draw everywhere, bubba? What's going on?"
"We'll be back," Tony told Steve, kissing his cheek before letting Peter lead him over to the public restrooms.
"Don't touch, hon, they had to put in stitches." He explained softly. "And you're hopped up on pain meds at the moment, so yeah. You should be relaxed. God, I'm so sorry Tony."
"You make it sound like I'm a piece of meat." Steve said with a slight smirk, working on washing himself down. "Now I have to be careful cleaning myself because someone made things sensitive."
"That plan backfired, little man. We will end up making sure you sleep. You should know that. Plus it'll help you get better, sweetie."
He laughed softly and unlocked the car, buckling in the sleeping child before turning to Steve to look at Sammy. With a tentative hand, Tony tucked the blanket around the baby before taking him from Steve to put the baby into his car carrier, taking the time to make sure he was completely secure. Taking a cautious breath, Tony climbed into the passenger seat, reaching over to take Steve's hand.
“It’s hard for someone to eat slowly when there are presents to open after." Clint said through a mouthful of food, earning him another smack from Natasha.
Steve nodded, finishing up his plate. "That sounds like it would be neat to have. We need to just start writing things down that we want house-wise in a notebook or something." He hummed.
"Mind? We don't mind at all, take him," Tony laughed, going for his swivel chair before grabbing his forceps,  beckoning Bucky to sit, "He loves staying with you guys. It’s totally obvious he gets away with stuff that he wouldn't here."
"I'm one thousand percent sure. I've thought about it, and I want him--or her-- to be partially you," Tony murmured, kissing Steve back, "Okay?"
"Feels good." Steve noised sweetly as Tony worked, loving both sensation. He could feel his cock harden more and more to match up with what Tony did to him. "So good, baby."
"Nope." Tony said bluntly. "He's working on his project tonight. Trying to finalize. Hey, can you pass me that Phillips?".
He moaned shamelessly, little breathy gasps leaving his lips. Steve's moans started to mingle with Tony's as he picked up their pace. He faltered only slightly for the moment, leaning up against the headboard and bending his knees for Tony to lay back on if he wanted or needed to. He took advantage of the new position, leaning in to leave kisses and small nips along Tony's neck and collarbone.
"About us," Tony clarified, wrapping his hand around Steve's cock, "Specifically, about me making love to you in my bed."
"I'm getting the hang of this Dad-thing, I guess," Tony chuckled softly, rubbing his thumb over Steve's knuckles, "He sounds exactly like you, Steve. He's gonna be just like you when he's older."
"A-ah--" Steve voiced out, rolling his hips back. "Jeez... Ya fill me up. Feels good--" he praised, starting to move his hips up then back down in slow, short thrusts to start.
"Killin' me, Stevie, ya killin' me," Tony hummed, smooching Steve's lips sweetly, "Oh well. I think mine might top yours, but we'll see."
"Yeah, okay, you get to bathe him then," Tony replied, switching children, "Go have fun in the sink."
"Since you seem to think it funny to make more of a mess, you get to clean it yourself and don't get to stop until it’s clean." Steve said with a huff. "I don't know what has gotten into you lately, but it needs to stop."
"Shut yer face, Barton," he called, taking his flustered state to go grab the boxes that contained his lab equipment.
"I know you do, baby. I think you really like touch," Tony chuckled, "I'd love to play around with that sometime. I bet you've got little spots all over you that'd make you squirm, hm?"  He smooched Steve's breastbone, tucking his head under his chin.
it was starting to hurt. Tony could feel the welts start up, but he kept with it, managing to hold back the sting of tears.
"Boo. No fun. It’s our wedding night. That, like, practically calls for me to be lovey." He stated. "You never did explain what I was doing since you said you weren't going again yet."
"Nothin' wrong with sentiment, baby. It’s a good thing." He rubbed Tony's back gently before breaking the hug. "I'll go over and get dressed, then we can go."
"I'm gonna get it, and finally make a home bar like I've been wanting to," Tony replied excitedly, washing the soap out of his hair, "It's a tropical thing, with rum, cherry liquor--"
"I wanted to see Ouija, I'm a big fan of horror films," Tony grinned, "If not, we can always watch a kid's movie. Freak out the kindergartners."
Sammy giggled softly and reached out for Peter, dropping down onto his stomach to attempt and crawl over to him. He whined when he only got partway, squeaking when Peter helped him up.
Once the food was finished, Steve went upstairs to wake Peter first. He saw the door open and the boy gone, hurrying to their room just to be sure.
Nodding, Tony stumbled to the couch, curling up into the soft pillows. He choked on spittle, shivering until Steve came back with blankets.
"Yeah baby, he did," Tony laughed, carrying the child downstairs, "You wanna help me set the table?"
Basically sex since I accidentally lost a half a chapter, so have fun until I can get the next part up!
Steve turned to capture Tony's lips into a deep kiss, speeding up the rest of his movements slightly.
"It's my job to help, Mr. Stark-Rogers," Blake chuckled, shaking both their hands, "A nurse will be around to take his vitals again before he leaves, then you'll be free to go. Have a good rest, Peter."
"Just because we adopted you, doesn't make you less special or love. If we hadn't adopted you, we wouldn't know what our lives would be like. Certainly wouldn't know how to take care of a kid or a baby." He stated. "We may have not conceived you, but you are still our boy. Our first, intelligent, and loving little boy. Heck, you are so much like daddy, no one would know you aren't blood related."
"I know, shhh," Tony soothed, quickly spreading out the blanket and setting the basket down, "There, see?"
Steve raised a brow and turned back to the eggs. "I'm not sure what of the things he just did makes him like me."
"I know, I know it’s a love thing and I'm pretty sucky at emotions," He mumbled, Steve's hands freezing against his hot skin.
Steve smiled up at the other and wrapped arms around Tony's waist, pulling them close to where their hips pressed together once again.
"People are obviously making an ordeal out of it if they are coming to me saying that my son's been gallivanting with some other guy like a 'love sick school girl'.".
"The funny thing is, I don't think he's ever been with a guy until last night. So she must have quite an impression on 'im." Steve hummed, kissing the top of Tony's head. "And Clint yelled because he saw the ring. And Bruce mentioned something called Red Light, and there was waffles. That was the extent of the breakfast." He chuckled.
Tony quickly shut his mouth and dug his fingers into the comforter, offering his hips up to Steve. He shot a pleading look over his shoulder, wanting him to just, "
"Yes, but I've not decided how yet," Tony murmured, trying to keep himself from getting too excited, "Usually I would suspend students for being such naughty children, but I can make an exception for you, if you would agree to a different punishment, on my terms."
"This is insane." He murmured, trying not to look like a person dropped in a country he knew nothing about.
The blond breathed a content sigh, leaning against the desk. "Glad you like it. Really, I should be doing that for you. You are the birthday boy, after all." He pointed out softly, petting Tony's hair.
The blond's eyes popped open, thinking he had heard something. Steve listened carefully in case he'd hear it again.
With a tiny growl, Peter cursed under his breath, stomping away. Tony watched him leave with a sigh, turning to Steve.
"No! No, no. Steve you didn't do anything wrong, trust me! You are reacting beautifully to me, its wonderful." Tony assured, making a small test roll of his hips against Steve's and earning a pleasant moan from the other in return. "This. This guy is why I stopped. It's sort of something that leads to some more intimate stuff that I didn't want to rush you into, but uh..."
Tony flicked his eyes open and grinned up at Steve, kissing at his collarbones. Steve huffed a small laugh himself, hugging Tony close before gently scooping him up.
The baby made a small whine in return as he was handed back to Sharon, the woman shushing him softly.
“Well that's uh… that’s apparently a thing,” Steve said with a huff of breath, still earning a look from Tony “It explains why U had been acting out of her normal self lately, too…”
"I'm not being mean, Tony. And I know you're hurt, I'm the one been taking care of you. Now is that mean?" He answered, running his hands along Tony's sides softly.
"It doesn't feel good, still." The boy sighed, leaning with Tony's hands. "’Specially when you try to do somethin' good. It makes me feel bad..."
He closed the distance and gently pressed his lips against Steve's, hand cupping the blond's cheek tenderly. Steve made a soft sigh against Tony's lips, leaning slightly into the kiss. His eyes fluttered shut, opening only when they parted. His head fell back against the floor, looking up at the detective more dazed than beforehand.
"Told you he kicks ferociously. Let's sign him up for soccer," Tony laughed, pressing slopping kisses over Peter's cheeks.
"I am small and warm. You better like it," Tony grumbled, about to close his eyes when whimpering came over the baby monitor, causing him to sigh. "Never. Not a single moment of peace," he whined, rolling off of Steve."
"I don't... I don't know, Steve," Tony rubbed his eyes, unaware that Peter had snuck into the room to listen in, "I love you, more than anything, and I really do, but I-- I don't know if--"
Before he had started to drive, he texted Tony and let him know they would be home soon. He peered back at Peter with a smile, just thinking how adorable his boy was as he pulled into the parking space at a Walgreen's.
"I wouldn't mind if you said it a billion more times, to be honest." Steve said slightly breathless, but continuing to kiss Tony's face as he carried them onto the couch. "You happen to be my favorite, as well. What a coincidence." He chuckled warmly and petted at Tony's hair.
"That was an accident, daddy." Steve replied, giving Peter one more smooch before placing him back on the couch. "But be good, okay? And help keep an eye on your brother and your daddy."
"Hey now, Steve. All that actually can wear anyone down if done enough, okay? And you're still getting used to actually having legs and walking. Takes a while to build that kind of strength up." Tony explained, shutting the trunk of the car and carefully grabbing Steve's shoulder in assurance. "There are more ways of being strong, y'know? And no amount of evil sea witch magic can take your strength away. ' Cause that heart of yours? What I've seen of it, its Herculean."
"You are so old fashioned. Roll in the hay?" Tony snorted, smooching Steve again before getting up, "Yes, yes. A few things. C'mon."
"Then sleep a little, love. Take a catnap." Steve replied, giving Tony an eskimo kiss. "I'll hold down the fort until you wake up."
"Whatcha dwa'hin ova der, Daddy? Wit all da lines?" Peter asked curiously, looking at Tony's schematics.
"Bye guys. Thank you for watching over Peter for us." Steve called back at them as they left, then turning back to Peter.
"Whatever you say, Steven," Tony smirked, righting himself to pour another cup of tea, "Don't push your brain too much thinking about it. I should have my own diagnosis of our case in the next two crossword answers."
“Bucky!” Steve nearly whined, groaning as he covered himself fully in his blanket. “They didn’t have to know about that, y’know. You jerk.”
"I think he's more upset that he thought you were pregnant," Tony chuckled, standing up, "He's got my complex, that's for sure. Doesn't like being wrong."
He quickly changed him and put him in his bear onesie, scooping Sammy up before going and getting his teether ring.
"Alright, sir. Just calm down a bit and we'll get him in quickly and taken care of." The nurse explained, calling a doctor over quickly to take Peter.
"You're such a weirdo," Tony sighed, setting Peter down and handing him his backpack so the kid could scurry off, presumably to find Natasha.
Steve sauntered back over to the bed with his belt in hand, cracking it in his hands as he looked at Tony.
"Jazz hands," Tony muttered under his breath, making the tiny motions, "I mean, yeah, but I'm sore as hell. Tell them you literally fucked me over?" He grinned, placing sloppy kisses all over Steve's face.
"I'm so fucked up Steve, you don't deserve me, oh my god," he whispered, leaning into Steve's touch.
"I couldn' find m'paypah an' Unca C'int wuz busy," Peter teared up again, shaking in Tony's arms, "I jus' wanted Lucky t'be here f'him."
"Tell me about it," Tony laughed, cuddling Peter to his chest, "We used to do the same with you and pull-ups, mister."
"You had a severe allergic reaction to shrimp, which I would suspect could be all shellfish," He answered for Peter, "Thankfully, your dads were smart enough to get you here before you could go into a full shock, so we were able to keep you sedated. You should be discharged within the hour, and for the parents--"
Tony kissed him silent, easily slipping in a third finger; once he was sure Steve was loose enough, he slicked up his already hardened cock, quickly replacing his fingers. Steve moaned as Tony slipped in, rolling his hips to meet the other's.
"That's the point of soulmates, Tony," Natasha said gently, "You have to let Steve in completely for the healing process to begin."
He was quiet for a second before he felt the tremors come on again, and he burst into tears, clinging to Steve.
"Well it’s true. And I couldn't be happier about it." Steve whispered to Tony, kissing the top of his head and wrapping arms around his waist.
Steve was already on the floor with Sammy on their blanket, playing "This Little Piggy" with the baby's toes.
Wheeling himself out from under the machine, Tony looked up at Steve, then his hand, squinting at the blood.
"You know something? You can mark that in the record books, because that is probably the first time you did something that benefitted someone besides you.".
He poured more lube onto his hand, pulling Steve up slightly so he could lather up his cock, having the blond straddle his lap.
He waved a hand at his flush, still pouting at himself. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's waist gently, continuing his kisses.
"Steve--" Tony's mouth was unhinged slightly as he watched Peter flip through the book, "Is this us? As
The boy then looked at Steve, wanting let down to crawl into his bed. "We gonna reads 'fore going to sweep?" He asked, burying himself under the blankets and cuddling Wade the penguin.
"Alright, Mister making-up-the-crossword," Tony interrupted, "Despite being a genius, I can't read your mind."
"I know," he laughed, glad to see the realtor's car parked outside, "C'mon, Babs is waiting for us."
"I'm so glad you're mine now. Officially." Steve grinned, looking to Tony. "All in heart, soul, and writing. And I'm yours all the same and I love it." He chuckled, smooching the top of Tony's head.
"Oh baby, don't be sorry, it happens to everyone," Tony soothed, rubbing Peter's back, "In fact, when your Papa and I first got married, I was sick
'Ay, Ay, sir.' Steve teased back, following Tony back into the car with a content expression settled on his face the whole ride back home.
He gently washed the lather out of Peter's hair, slicking the curls back before grabbing a washcloth.
"I dunno," Tony replied, leaning back to look down at the baby, "Weird. I think I picked him up. I don't-- I don't remember."
"It's ordered," Tony announced, phone in his hand, "Best get a move on, Barton. Guiseppe's closes at eight tonight."
The team was quiet, most of them looking in disbelief except for Bucky, who still had careful eyes on Steve in the chamber.
"I don't want Peter to feel left behind or unloved, whatever the case may be." Steve whispered back quietly, curling around Peter and tangling his own legs with Tony's. "I couldn't bear it if either child ever felt like that..."
"Hush, you, he's fine," Tony chuckled, slipping his hand back out, "But you make a point. We'll open them after pipsqueak's gone to bed."
Tony licked his lips and nodded, shifting the yawning child in his lap. He didn't really have anything else to say, opting to fall into uncomfortable silence. They sat for a few moments in it, till Bruce broke the quiet.
Steve grinned at that. "I like that idea. I like it a lot." He leaned in to kiss Tony's cheek before he made a quick sketch for the setup. "We could outline each other along the wall and fill it in for the silhouettes. Then work from there.”
"Someone's a little grumpy." Bucky said softly. "You got up early, so that might be why." He stated carefully. "Sorry, Pete. We're just talking. Not something your dad and I do one-on-one often. I bet its quieter here than upstairs, though."
"'M sorry..." Steve apologized between kisses. "You did start it, though. Gettin' me all riled up..."
It didn't even take Tony's words before Steve came hard with a loud moan, upper body going lax against the mattress and hips starting to buckle as he started to white out a bit.
"It's okay, Steve, he doesn't have to," Tony said softly, stroking Sammy's curls, "I don't blame him." He smiled again, shame and regret rolling over him in waves.
with-, but the boy had grown into a brave, strong, and kind young man before his eyes, and Steve had made sure he was there for him. Not as a lover, as he had wished to be with his Tony, but as his godfather; As the one he could confide in when he felt he could confide in no one else.
Slowly, Tony tugged Steve's shirt up, pulling back to toss it aside, running his hands up his chest. "You're so gorgeous, holy fuck," Tony breathed, taking a nipple into his mouth and gently biting on it, sucking it sensitive before moving onto the next one.
"I want you to keep this in," Tony hummed, dancing his fingertips over Steve's skin, "And if you're good, I'll use the vibrator, 'kay?"
"I'm probably just paranoid," he shook his head, "But I'm gonna go up the restrictions on his computer, okay? I'll come back once I'm done."
Steve smiled back softly, lightly playing footsie with Tony as their legs were tangled. "I'm always protective of the people I care for. The bond just intensifies it with you. Plus, you're one of the few left on that list."
"Have you ever heard the term 'Opposites Attract', Steve? You may be different, but that's what makes you two work.".
"Oh, hell..." Steve breathed with a soft whine. "I know, no noise. But I probably would've made my lip bleed again. Oh,
"So pushy." Steve joked lightly, kissing Tony sweetly before they settled under the covers. "I had to get my mistletoe kiss in somehow." He smiled, nuzzling Tony's hair as the blond shut his eyes. "Love you."
"I know what you're thinking, and yes, they're straight from Moscow, one of the originals of the Romanoff clan's antiques," Tony grinned, shifting a squirmy Peter into his lap, "Took forever to find, though."
"I jus' don' wan' you an' Daddy t'not lub me anymorh when d'baby comes," he whispered, large tears rolling down his face as he crumbled.
“I am cheeky. I've heard it’s one of my best qualities," Tony laughed, rinsing the soap out of his hair.
"Hmm, well we can look into it or other things more sometime soon." Steve said, a smirk on his lips. "Maybe for your birthday since that'll be coming up soon, right? And you'll officially be a big boy." He teased playfully with a laugh.
"He's my smart lil bub," Tony cooed, smooching Peter's forehead, "Just like his Daddy. Real proud'a him."
Tony looked back at Steve and saw the worry and hurt on his face. He turned his eyes away from Steve before talking softly, his voice breaking in the process.
"Don't use words like 'slut'. They are demeaning and ugly." He said seriously, slipping in a third finger.
, let alone reply to Steve. Instead, he flopped his head down onto Steve's shoulder, clawing at his back to try and get purchase.
"Just a second, baby." Steve called as he finished up the bed. "Okay, Peter. You can come in. Stay here with Daddy, I'm going to go get us a snack before bed."
"Sorry, I’m not familiar with how it all works in the aftermath." Steve teased. "It was fun, though. The whole thing. And it felt...amazing, to say the least." He sighed in content.
"Then tell me so I have an idea." Steve purred against Tony's skin, hands making the curve of the brunet's ass. He kissed down along Tony's spine slow and lingering.
"Tooooneeeey." Steve hummed back playfully, following Tony inside. He booped their noses together, lightly smooching Tony's lips.
He took the kids to Peter's room and climbed into the hammock, setting Sammy so he could watch Pete doodle on his notepad.
Tony walked up from the basement, covered in grease from setting up his workshop. He looked between the three of them and sighed, shoulders slumping.
apologize, let Daddy hear it." He whispered to Peter. "He may not show it, but his feelings are hurt, Pete."
Well, I felt you had a bit of a problem and I figured I'd help out." Steve grinned to him, petting at his hair. “What were you dreaming about?”
"That's very nice of you, Peter." Steve answered kindly. "When you are older, we will discuss the differences of boys and girls though. Apparently I need to have it with Daddy since he can't seem to tell." He huffed, looking back over at Tony.
Steve nodded silently, nudging contently at Tony's hand from being petted. He wasn't sure how much he would like this, but it was something new to try and he would try it.
Steve nodded and moved towards Tony, stroking at his hair. "I know. But it’s good to get it all out. Cry until you can't anymore." He said with a soft sigh, shutting his eyes for the moment.
"He's so smart, but he still is learning basic things for kids his age that he can't learn from a book." Steve said with a soft grin. "It’s really an odd combo, but I wouldn't change it. He perfect as he is."
Meanwhile in the kitchen, Sammy was having a nice time exploring bubbles as he was gently cleaned in the sink.
"What? Nothing of the sort! W-Why I'd never--" Steve sputtered and scoffed, warmth creeping up his neck as he cleared his throat. "A ridiculous notion..." He murmured.
"Yeah." The boy hiccupped as he tried to calm down from his laughs. "We gonna eat lunch?" He asked softly, resting his head on Tony's shoulder.
Tony sighed, but reluctantly went up to their bathroom. He waited for Steve to close the door before removing his shirt, wincing at his husband's gasp of horror. White, black, and red scars laced over his chest, some places slightly bubbled up from the burn. Tony sighed down at it and started to pick at a scab, feeling a little shame.
"You did. You were such a loving toddler, it was so cute." Steve grinned, taking Sammy and playing with the baby's fingers. "Loved giving kisses."
Steve was about to state something as he was opening the dorm door, but was interrupted by an arrow flying past his head and into the door across the hall. Tony stared wide-eyed at the arrow and Steve just groaned inside at the other person in their dorm room. The other person was chuckling uncontrollably.
Steve kissed Tony's lips softly with a happy hum. "I'm excited too, you have no idea. But it’s not certain the baby will completely be a mini-me." He sighed. "But I can't wait to have all that again. And some things we haven't gotten to do yet. It'll be so great."
"I know you miss them, sweetheart." Steve soothed softly. "If I could go back and fix that, I would in a heartbeat. As least we know they aren't hurting. They're someplace good..."
"Alright. Got the math for Mr. Smarty Pants over here." Steve chuckled, entering the lab and joining Peter on the couch.
Steve's face grew hot with a blush. Tony loved that Steve still had that reaction after being with him for five years already.
"I was trying to help Daddy try and understand how much he always means to me. And everyone else." Steve explained softly. "He has a hard time believing it himself, so I'm trying to help him. It'll take a bit and it may not always be pretty, but it never means we are arguing bad enough it would me us separating."
"I honestly don't see it." Steve hummed, helping fix up the presents quietly. "I'm obviously better looking. At least in your eyes, right?" He asked, giving Tony puppy-dog eyes.
"There'll be more. I think you and Bruce and Clint get along well," Tony hummed, putting his cold feet up on Steve's thigh, "I should get Bruce over here, but I'm afraid if I do he might try to bring 'sorry for you loss' gifts. Well, I might rethink that, given your schoolgirl outfit's still hung up and hasn't been used again--"
Clint snorted, not at all surprised at Tony's formalities, "Yeah, yeah, Stark. Now you can rub it in Howie's face, yeah? Now go help Nat get your stuff while I talk to the big guy."
He moved along with Steve's hand for a small while longer before taking his hand away, letting the blond take over the reigns. Tony knelt back as he watched, subconsciously reaching forward to palm himself through his trousers as he observed the other; analyzing him for hopefully future romps, he supposed.
The blond blinked at the other for the moment, giving a hum in thought.  "Your eyes are on me the whole time, yet you don't receive the lecture. What is it you think about as you stare at me, Tony?"
"Uh-huh. We's getting da good stuffs." Peter said matter-of-factly. "We's gonna eat 'n swing 'n slide n' all sorts a'stuffs!"
"If you need anything while you're... going through this, please call us," Tony offered up, "I'd like to help in any way I can, even if its booting some of the medical bills--"
"All right, you got me. Caught me more by surprise, I'll admit." Steve managed to squeak out, clearing his throat after.
"Be they objects or body parts." Steve sighed fondly, glancing at Tony. "I assume you were there the whole time and heard everything?"
"Hopefully, it’s all good things." Steve answered for Tony, sitting next to him on the couch. "Ms. Potts recommended you highly. And we trust her judgement highly." He smiled lightly.
"Oh god, has Papa been tattling on me?" Tony teased, hefting Peter up, "That's supposed to be a secret, bambi."
Steve had another quick couple of sneezes before deciding to carefully try and venture out of the tub and grab a towel to dry off. When Tony was done making the bed and covering it in piles of blankets, he popped his head back into the bathroom, smiling at Steve in his pajamas.
"Steve, I'm sorry. I just hit something big and wanted to work on it, and I completely forgot about it.".
"Uh, well not really a friend." Tony said carefully, rubbing at his chest where the arc reactor laid. "I used to have people over a lot. I may not know them, but I didn't care. Sometimes they stayed the night but left the next day. Pepper had saw many of those pass through over the years, so she assumed I was probably back to my old ways..."
"Just a little," Tony grinned, still playing with Steve's hair, "Just you wait. I'll find something new to bring my blushing virgin boyfriend back out again."
"Peter, sweetie, do you need some help with your clothes?" Steve chuckled softly, picking up the boy and resting him on his hip.
“What would we have worried about, Steve?” Natasha finally asked, voice careful and full of genuine curiosity and concern “What happened?”
"Yeah. There's a ton of room to expand, which I need," Tony mumbled, leaning into Steve's touch, "Got all your art set up?"
"Next time you wake me up, don't do it by shoving my face into your chest," He laughed, kissing Steve's lips, "You're such a teddy bear."
much. Besides, he's in second grade. I hope you know your colors," Tony teased, "It won't be hard. I'll take a week off to help you guys get started, and see if I can convince Pep to let me work from home more often."
"You are adorable flustered. See you tomorrow, Steve. Its a date." The man hummed, waving as he walked away.
"--We'll see. Of course, legally, I'm perfectly allowed to visit the child if I wish. But, with the way things are looking, I just want my child to be in the arms of willing, loving parents."
"Be like what? A thoughtful fiancé? All right, then." Steve chuckled, kissing his pout. "If we do, it won't be anything quick this time. It'll be nice and slow."
"If you wanna wait, that's okay," Tony smirked, sliding onto the back of the bike, "Let's go, sweetheart. I want to hear your screams. You know, outside the bedroom."
cuddling," Tony grinned back, easing Steve up to help him out of his shirt, "I miss your body warmth."
Steve's hands moved all along the sides of Tony's face tenderly and petted at Tony's hair in praise, keeping his hips from twitching forward into the warm, moist heat.
"A—ah," Steve noised as Tony's fingers moved in and out of him, nodded quickly. "Yes. Yes he has. He does. Oh, he does." He breathed, rocking back onto Tony's fingers.
He easily fell asleep amongst his boys, snoring softly into Steve's shoulder. Steve chuckled softly to himself, peering over at Peter.
to letting Howard get to me. Peter knocked on the bathroom door in the middle of it all and told me I wasn't allowed to break Papa's heart."
"It's called sex, Stevie. Look around, pick stuff you wanna try," Tony hummed, grabbing a cart, "I know we're gonna get you specific lingerie while we're here. And-- oh,
"Our 'fun day' sorta went downhill, didn't it?" Steve laughed humorlessly as they settled on the bed. "I always wind up doing that somehow. Sorry about that." He murmured.
"This is perfect, Tony." Steve said softly, smiling at his boyfriend sweetly. "I never would have expected this. What made you think of doing all this just to take me dancing?" He asked curiously.
"Huh--oh." Tony inwardly cursed himself for forgetting to bandage himself up. He slipped off the bed, hissing slightly as he accidentally re-opened the cuts.
"He's been henning since we met," Tony replied with a raised brow, not even flinching at the smack upside his head.
"We can watches a movie or plays games or we can do some 'speriments--" Peter prattled on excitedly, wiggling in Tony's arms.
"It was unexpected, but it wasn't bad. Hurt my ass a bit after with the spanking, though." Steve answered softly. "You have fun, though?"
, sir!" Steve said with a playful scoff. "I'll have you know Tony thoroughly enjoys our escapades. And I'm quick to go whatever speed he wants me to." He preened, setting up another piece and screwing it in.
"Cause I wuz gon' suhpwise you an' Daddy!" He wailed, sniffling as Sammy whined in his arms and patted his face, "You ruwined m'suhpwise, Papa--"
"That’s what Ms. Foster told us the day that we got you." Steve hummed softly, reaching to pet Peter's hair as a comfort. "She said you were the most perfect little guy when you were in her care."
"I mean, money's always good. Especially until we get our house, that way I can pay on this place. That and for supplies if I can get commissioned." He said softly, kissing the top of Tony's head. "But blow jobs are always good as well." He chuckled.
"Don't thank me for that. I don't want to ever have to do that to you again." Steve said solemnly, kissing the top of Tony's head sweetly.
"Ah, mm..." The blond mewled as Tony worked him with that mouth of his. "Ya always have such a way with words." He chuckled, a shiver of want going up his spine as Tony flicked his tongue along the underside.
"Got it, pipsqueak?" Tony hummed, rolling out his own batch of dough to use the other cookie cutters.
"I think it’s more so him than it is me." Steve said at a whisper, covering the baby carefully with the blanket as they headed outside to the car. "He's so
Steve tried to hold back from it, he really did. But Tony started to work his neck once more, and he couldn't help it. He came in Tony's hand, letting out a quietened whine as he did.
"You're okay, lil 'un, I promise," Tony murmured, holding Peter's hand comfortingly, "Not much longer and we can go home and get you all comfortable in your own bed with Wade, alright?"
With the end of May drawing near, along with his birthday and the big unveiling of Steve's project, Tony had been having a pretty good semester end. Steve still needed to decide for his final piece, so he and Tony had been spending time together regularly. So much so that the girl at the café kept looking at them in a judging way. Most of the time Tony dismissed her, occasionally sending her a look that said "Mind your own business, lady.".
"Well no shit," Clint rolled his eyes, "We should put you back in the hospital for this shit, Tones."
“And the team will try and keep missions that might pop up around full moons under control. That way you aren’t out in the field and are targeted by enemies when you go into ‘beast mode’.” Clint assured as well, trying to keep a light tone. “Anyway, what we’re trying to say is that the team’s got your back. We’ll help you, furry or not.”
"It a plush penguin from the gift shop. Not an actual penguin." He clarified to the others. With Tony, he probably could have got a live penguin.
"Mmm. Stop that, you'll make me blush more," Tony tried to scowl, ending up with a childish pout, "Go call them and ask. And catch them up on Mister Shellfish and stuff. I think I'm gonna go work a little bit so I'm completely free for our date night." He smiled softly and gave Steve's cheek a kiss before turning to head off to the workshop, humming under his breath.
He took his clothes from his Papa and slipped on his underwear, letting Steve zip his bear onesie up around him.
"I honestly think it’s a scientist thing. They want to search and find out what makes anything tick." Steve said, leaning in the touch with a sigh. "But we will talk about it. Because he knows better."
"I had a tough day, and things had been building, alright? It’s not-- It's not all that big," he muttered miserably, "I got burned really badly, my head wasn't in the game, I let myself get under too much. Felt like I constantly failed everyone, as a parent and a husband and a friend and I was
"Now we just finish adding the markings." The blond hummed as he scratched on the paper and showed it to Peter for reference.
"We're going to hope that doesn't happen for his sake, though." Steve sighed, looking Tony softly. "I'll call the doctor tomorrow and get him checked over just in case. Get him taken care of."
"Oh man, I gotta go.". The brunette rose from sitting quickly, grabbing his things. Steve looked at Tony with slight worry in his eyes.
Tony slowly led Steve through the three step waltz until they were seamlessly gliding over the pavement: another memory buried in Tony. Colorful flashbacks of himself in ballroom school with his mother nearly made him falter, but he caught himself in time, spinning out as the player strummed his last chord. Steve pulled Tony back in close at the end, pulling him into a soft kiss with a happy sigh.
Tony gave it a second before pushing in the second bulb, greedily watching Steve's ass close around it. "You're gorgeous, babe."
"I know sweetheart, and your Papa and I try very hard to do that, but Sammy is really, really little," Tony explained, "We do have to include him."
Steve's pace started to quicken, hand pumping himself and hips thrusting upwards to meet the strokes. More frequent moans of want started to escape Steve's lips, the sounds themselves bringing Tony along in the want of touch.
"I love you too, mi amoré," Tony murmured, reaching up to scratch Steve's scalp, "My soulmate." He got a dazed look on his face, a tiny smile on his lips. "Wow," he breathed, laughing weakly, "I still can't believe you're mine."
"Hello. I'm Steve. And I am going to guess you guys aren't really movers, hm?" He said with a half-smile.
Tony felt his heart flutter at that: he nodded, softly smooching Steve. "Thank you," he mumbled, reaching up to cup Steve's face.
He grabbed a tissue from the coffee table to gently soak up the blood that trickled down Peter's leg. Pressing the tissue to the cut, Tony leaned forward to smooch Peter's temple.
He and Steve had signed the papers not four hours ago, and were on their way home from the agonizing wait of approval that had officially made them Stark-Rogers rather than Stark-and-Rogers.
"Shhh, it’s okay. It’s okay, just let out whatever you need to." Steve said sweetly, continuing to rub Tony's back in small circles.
Peter only looked up and sighed, placing his book aside so he could climb into Steve's lap, snuggling into his chest.
"I want it to be for you, though." Steve whispered back. "As long as you can be happy, I'm happy. And you deserve so much more happiness, Tony."
"That's adorable." Bucky chimed, finally getting away from the kitchen and bringing in the cookie tray for the others.
"Bed. Yeah. I need sleep, after today," Tony yawned, closing the closet doors once they were done, "We can invite the others over tomorrow for Christmas things, if you want."
"Oh Steven, you say the damnedest things," he crowed, grinning as he fully climbed onto Steve to lay down, "I never said I didn't have
. I still-- fuck, Steve. It still amazes me that we were neighbors for eight years and didn't even know... we didn't even know."
?" Steve gasped. "You're lucky you don't have a concussion or broke something, baby." He cooed, kissing at Tony's head.
"You're okay, sweetie," Tony soothed, grabbing Peter's favorite pajamas before heading to the bathroom, "It was just a little misunderstanding and you're not in trouble."
Sammy whined, so Tony picked him back up, whispering gently to the baby while dancing him around the room. Peter looked at him and harrumphed, turning on his heel to march out of the room in a huff. Annoyed, he slammed the door to his room, hopping into his hammock to re-read one of Tony's old papers. At the slam, Sammy startled himself and started to cry, clutching his tiny hands at Tony's shirt.
"Yeah, he did, and he's in trouble for it," Tony sighed, still petting Peter, "Papa and I are gonna sit down with Auntie Tasha and Uncle Bruce to talk about them being the responsible ones while we're away."
"Mhm, I know," Tony replied sweetly, slipping out of his sweatpants into jeans, "You can stay in the warmth, if you'd like. The grown-ups need to go work."
Steve rolled his eyes playfully at that. "Well, a kid can dream, yeah?" He grinned. "I think I might just temporarily lose my strength a bit where you two could keep me down." He hummed.
"Just make sure you always let Daddy know how good he is at being a daddy for me, okay?" Steve requested quietly. "He likes to think that he isn't good enough. Can you do that for me?"
"Mmm, sounds perfect. You think he'll love it?" Steve asked quietly after the kiss. "You don't think he'd be mad switching to a new room, do you?"
"And I think it’s nice to know that you have someone for sure destined for you. Not everyone gets to have that..."
"Of course, Love." Steve hummed, cleaning up before carefully scooping Tony up and heading upstairs to their room.
"So what?" Clint proclaimed. "Though some may disagree, Love is Love, no matter which way you look at it. If you have that, then who cares what other people think?".
'You want to eat it?' Steve asked surprised, following Tony along in the kitchen while the other looked for plates. 'But its burnt...'
That's when he lost it. Tony completely broke down in Steve's arms, shaking uncontrollably. Steve hugged Tony close and tight to him, kissing along his face gently and wiping away the man's tears. He rocked his husband in his arms, shushing him softly. It took a few minutes for Tony to calm down, but he got there, eventually sniffling into Steve's shoulder.
Once Peter was napping, Steve looked for Tony and found him in the bedroom. He crawled up onto the bed behind the other, wrapping his arms around Tony gently.
"Don't gotta beg, baby." Steve hummed, slowly pressing the finger in and moving it smoothly. "I got ya, Tony. Don't worry, I gotcha..."
"Don't I know it?" Steve grinned, nuzzling into Tony's neck gently. "The best. One and only, just for me." He purred, leaving a kiss on Tony's cheek.
Steve was the first to wake, but he didn't open his eyes. He stayed in this half rest with a soft hum, hugging Tony closer.
Steve took in a deep breath, letting it out slowly with a content sigh. He leaned his face up and left soft and tender kisses on Tony's face, humming happily. Tony murmured at the kisses, smooching Steve's nose before slowly pulling out, collapsing into a heap beside him. He sighed happily, curling up into Steve's warmth.
Steve smiled softly as they pulled into the parking lot of the aquarium. The fact the boy wants to help it was nice.
Taking a breath, Tony put his hands on either side of Steve's head, sitting back to get a better angle. He thrusted slowly, leaning down to capture Steve's lips. Steve kissed back, deep and wet as he moaned against his husband's lips. He moved as Tony did, along with each thrust and in perfect sync as only they could.
Tony had told Friday that she should tell Steve that he would not come down again. After that, he had piled a pillow over his sweaty face and tried to fall asleep without worrying about getting rid of his clothes.
"I'm sorry," Steve said, putting his hand on Lopez's arm. Tony's lips fell. Steve never told him he was sorry. He shook his head almost imperceptibly. This was a mission, Steve did it to let her speak, and besides, Steve didn’t really knew about his relationship with his father.
The wood that draped the walls was riddled with woodworm holes, and a large carpet covered the furthest parts of the floor. Tony was cold. The man had told them in a few words that although they were all allowed to live upstairs, they were by no means supposed to put their shoes on the stairs. There were now eight pairs of shoes in the narrow hallway downstairs, and Tony and the other Avengers in socks.
"Maybe Rogers deserves some kind of award or whatever now," Rhodes muttered, but Tony could understand him. He looked up from his work.
Slowly, Natasha went forward and Tony followed her to the door. Again, the stale smell of the stairwell fell into Tony's nose as the woman opened the door, and while they were putting on their jackets, Lopez held out a blue T-shirt to Steve.
"I know," Tony recalled, taking the package from Steve's hand. It was very light. "But why is he sending us something?"
Tony felt his mouth go dry. His thoughts skipped. He could not trust any of his comrades to do such an act. He felt his pulse rise and the panic grow in him. He had gotten sick and was about to say Friday that she had to inform Steve, but he knew better.
He could not imagine that it would be of supernatural value to be the only one in a breed to have ears. "So there are more of these things, either," he concluded, "or where they come from, hearing has the only advantage of being the leader of a group. So the leader is likely to be better equipped against enemies, and so can warn his herd. Friday?"
When he opened his eyes, the light was burning. He immediately closed them again. He frowned and tried again. It worked.
Jesus, Google Translate improved well. Took way shorter to translate this than expected. So, that’s kind of nice. I wrote this story a long time ago, actually started like two years ago, right after watching Civil War. Then I made a break somewhere in the middle. The story gets way better once we come to that point. If they first couple of chapters are more like semi-nice, keep in mind it really gets better.
"It's okay," the mechanic answered frantically, even if it was not okay. "We have to go, we can help you. And we have to find the brain."
Cameras clicked wildly, Tony even heard that through the TV. He looked up in surprise. He wouldn’t have thought that the US would put a case to his teammates.
Steve shook his head. Obviously he was not the only one Tony was important enough to, to not follow the director's instructions. "Can you contact him?"
So, yeah. Y'all don't have to like it. I can do way better, I don't know what came over me when I was writing this. I just wanted you to know that I know, too, that this doesn't make too much sense.
"There is no electronic signal from that spot," Kima said as he stormed back onto the bridge. "But footprints of two people. One limps. They were looking for something and then ran away. Should I pursue them?"
His breathing slowed noticeably and his thoughts drifted off in his dozing state to his conversation with Steve earlier.
They were a team again. The flight back had been quiet and Steve had noticed the looks of Rhodey on himself and Vision had observed the newcomers thoroughly, but nothing else had happened. Without big words, they all went to the living room.
It seemed so clear now. During his time at MIT, he often walked along the path that linked sights throughout the city over 2.5 miles in length. He was surprised that he did not immediately realize it, but it had become clear to him through the hidden clue of the stranger. Mind and Hand, MIT, Boston.
"What's that?" Lang asked immediately. Only now Tony could see a flash in the little light. "An injection?" He called. "What’s that going to be about?"
Hey! Yeah, I thought it would be a good idea to write in an accent. And the 'ya' part is basically everything I know. But for some reason I kept it. I don't know.
Tony had begun to build his suit after Friday assured him that she would initiate some ways to establish contact with Lang and Wilson. The new one obviously had a really good equipment, otherwise, he would not have been able to change sizes at the airport, and Wilson was definitely equipped with his resources, so Tony was a bit startled that the contact had been broken off. But it was not his priority, because they were both heroes and in a group with some well-trained agents.
as it was over Tom's River. Only a conspecific. They all look alike, which sometimes makes it hard for people to tell them apart."
The sweat ran down his forehead and the mercilessly strong wind made the other's hair constantly move.
"The brain was so damaged that we could not analyse its functioning. But if more of these beings emerge, the top priority must be to eliminate the leader," he continued. He looked at the persons next to him. Nobody seemed particularly surprised, Vision even nodded affirmatively. Barnes looked at Tony for barely more than a second before crossing his eyes and he turned away, whispering something to Steve.
"Tony, are you still awake? We have to think of a plan. Hey, whatever's going on in your head, turn it off. Steve wants to talk to you, and we could find Pepper's cell phone in China. We’ll find somebody from Burkwills group. Agents in China are already on it. Tony?" He asked again, but again the mechanic said nothing. In his head were images of Pepper and Steve.
"Um, huh?" Tony asked very intelligently. His hands moved nervously at the shock of the woman suddenly standing next to him.
But there were still about a hundred meters of the deck in front of him and then he still had to somehow find a control room or perhaps a kind of power supply through the building.
Next to a chimney, a corridor began that probably led to the four rooms and the bathroom, as the man had explained to them.
The honest smile widened on Tony's lips. He, too, had been scared in the last few days, but he certainly wouldn’t admit it.
A part of the bridge had already collapsed anyway due to the explosion. Tony aimed at the big corpse and shot. He gave a slight twitch as the rest of the bridge collapsed with a loud crash, sending waves on the lake, which everything but calm at this moment. The creatures roared and screamed and beat with their arms, but did not seem to be able to swim. Without waiting longer, Tony shot forward, knowing that Rhodey was following him. Friday scanned the targets in the water and then indicated that the big creature, the
"I'll tell you later. I have to go soon. Just so you know it; we were officially considered to be a self-employed team by the government. So we're the Avengers again."
Steve looked around and decided to head south. He had his shield on his back and he watched attentively.
Tony could not help it. He was reluctant to shut down his AI, but Fury was right: Friday was obviously a security hole, and on such a controversial issue, they could not afford more mistakes. Tony reacted as if in a trance, but his thoughts went back to the video. How did this person know all this? How did he get into his system? Why was it about him and how was he supposed to know where he would have to appear in six days?
He nodded. "I've made mistakes, big mistakes," he began softly, trying to sound as reassuring as possible. "We’ve all made mistakes. But the biggest mistake would be to argue now. We have to look for Tony, together." Steve exhaled slowly as Rhodey finally let the gun down. He seemed to calm down.
The last lights in the park had gone out and with just the few street noises that now reached the park, it seemed eerie. Tony was torn from his thoughts by a movement across the river; about how Howard would react if he knew that Tony and Steve had more or less made a confession of love.
Steve got up jerkily. He heard Bucky turn his head and Vision follow his movements, but Steve didn’t go far.
"Fine. Can I go now?" Tony asked annoyed and tried to move with his good arm in a vertical position, but jerked back immediately. He was glad that his ribs were apparently just bruised. That wouldn’t make the next months to hell but only bother him for a few weeks.
Shaking his head, the woman watched him. "We'll send you back to your quarters right away, Mr. Stark. Just let us finish our work first."
For both, nobody was allowed to go to the workshop, even though the methods of punishing this rule break were different. Tony grunted grudgingly at the unwanted visit, sending him out, sometimes even talking to him briefly, while his father ...
"SHIELD searches a number of Internet files for images that show the monsters. The FBI also scours through many files in search of answers. But we’ve got no information about these things. There were only two matches with the beings and images on the Internet."
"Some question how you all were able to be there so quickly. They now question the security systems of the US. Others declare you all should be in prison now. Some warn against further attacks, others are revisiting the old conspiracy theories and sending a lot from Area 51. This has become a popular destination in recent days. A few are waiting for the press conference, but they are also talking about it all day long. The
"The scan didn’t show much more mistakes. A cord on the neck joint is loose, but it's in an open position so that you can fix it quickly," she replied. Tony hobbled to his chair and ordered Dum-E to bring the suit to him.
Steve quickly threw his shield to relieve Bucky. One of the creatures instantly fell to the ground, but Steve didn’t care; he was thinking about how to somehow kill the brain.
"Excuse me for being late," another voice suddenly answered. Frowning, Tony looked at Fury. He had an agent join the high-security meeting via the internet?
The old, blood-spattered man had managed to escape from the car. Searching for help, he looked at the younger man, who pulled him by the hair.
Again they fell into silence, which was almost unpleasant. Earlier, Tony recalled, they had often talked about something. And once they were silent, then it had not been unpleasant.
The plate pulled over the whole thick body and released only a few unprotected places. At the important joints - at least for human beings - such as shoulders, elbows or the knee and in the groin area the brown skin was to be seen. "There are very few unprotected spots," Tony explained aloud. "Did you scan everything? Project it there,” Tony said, pointing to his right. Friday built up a life-size image of the being and Tony pinched his eyes in disgust.
"Stark?" Fury asked. If he was surprised, he did not show it. Rather, he sounded annoyed at the interruption. Tony just shrugged his shoulders in amazement. "Friday?" he asked again, but the AI did not answer.
"A-AH!" Steve practically screamed out in pleasure as he came in Tony's hand. He chanted Tony's name over and over in pure bliss, body buzzing and thrumming in ecstasy.
"By the way, I just remembered; our Christmas gift from Bucky is an unlimited babysitting pass." He grinned. "Any time we want or need some 'extensive alone time', we can just call him up and send the kids over. Isn't that nice?"
"No need to apologize. I actually find myself flattered that you think of me in such a way." Steve hummed, thinking for a moment. "There is still the matter of how you'll save your grade. In lieu of what you just told me, I think I have an idea that'll help your grade and may be within your interests--".
"But they aren't something I can bring out to the beach." The genius said sadly, eyeing the merman's pout. Those faces were sure to tug at his heartstrings no matter what.
"Yeah, as much as he'd probably enjoy 'reading' more." Steve chuckled, closing up the book and scooping up the baby to put back into the stroller. "You'll probably be ready to sleep once we are headed home, huh?"
"You gots money?" Pete asked, going on his tiptoes while Steve paid, "Cause we need somes for the store."
"Mmm... That would be a sight to come home to." He hummed, hands trailing down to the dip of Tony's back.
"You do so much, babe. Just being here is more than enough," Tony murmured, sitting back so Steve could sit up, "You're my
Steve huffed a slight laugh at that. "Well, that's because he doesn't feel like matching. And he hadn't really decided to go out anywhere much before we met. So he's a little out of practice."
With that, he stomped out of the building, somehow managing to drag Steve behind him. Steve glanced back once more before they exited, seeing Eugene's face start to turn red.
He knelt by the bed, watching the boys carefully with a small smile. Tony went over and put his hands in Steve's hair, bending over to smooch the top of his head.
"The adventures will be in development, but the three origins are all here in this book." He explained quietly. "Just figured one would be enough for tonight since Peter wanted to hear about Spiderman."
He took a breath and looked down at the baby carrier, laughing softly as he bent down to pick up Sammy.
Tony was standing in Steve's doorway, looking a lot like a little kid asking to sleep with his parents after having a nightmare. Then it hit Steve. Nightmares. Right...
"Speaking of keeping it G, I don't think it would be a bad idea to watch some Christmas specials." Pepper offered, playing with Peter's hands. "Peter likes Frosty and Rudolph and all of those, right?"
"Yes, Sir," Tony replied softly, a blush covering his cheeks, "I've been really naughty lately. You said you'd promised me a lesson or two."
Tony. Those warm, honey brown eyes losing the light they always had; that Steve adored seeing. Those lips that would crinkle into that bright smile that he loved-- knowing when they did that it was genuine-- going slack and lifeless. That warm, toned skin that he had longed to touch again so many times over becoming pale as the blood stopped flowing through it. The Tony he loved more than anything, gone in a complete instant when he was told he no long had to fight to stay on this Earth.
The blond looked at the photo options the man brought to him, nodding towards the one Tony had found in agreement.
"Dat's it! See?" Peter grinned, watching Sammy plop himself down again, "One more time, like we practiced, but I'm gonna watch, otay?"
"A-ah," Tony moved his hips slightly, taking the pressure off his backside, "D-don't be sorry, I needed that."
Steve just moaned loudly, feeling Tony hit his spot over and over. He lasted a few more thrusts before he came with a cry, face buried into Tony's chest. Tony grinned into Steve's chest, only thrusting a few more times before feeling Steve clench, thrusting up to the hilt before coming, moaning loudly into Steve's neck. Steve panted against Tony's chest, leaning against his body and leaving open mouthed kisses on his skin.
," Tony begged, broken whimpers dripping from his lips as he tried to push back onto Steve's finger, "I've been so naughty, need t'learn--"
Tony laughed and accepted the spoonful, licking Steve's hand before pulling back, licking his lips. "Thank you," he murmured.
"You believe me yet, kid?" He breathed, shucking his own shirt aside and stepping out of his jeans, "Or y'still need convincing?"
"The only tantrum I can really remember is when we got up late, and you were gonna go into work," Tony grinned, "I went
"You get to deal with yelling children this early in the morning," he complained, grumpily pulling the sheets over his head.
"Well, first we start out with why you feel you have come here for help." Rhodes explained, setting a clipboard in his lap with a pen to take notes. "And after that, we start from the beginning. I may ask you some questions eventually as well, Steve. Just so you won't be caught off guard."
"We got that for you because you've been good, munchkin. You earned it. And you still deserve it." He explained. "You aren't in any trouble, baby. You were trying to do something nice."
"No. I mean, yes they are sensitive for merfolk, but that's not why it feels good." The man clarified. "I meant your touch, specifically. Its gentle and soft, but inquisitive; careful not to overstep or poke and prod. Its soothing and... tender. It feels so good..."
"Well, it is my genu-ine pleasure, sir." Steve answered back in the same accent, nuzzling his cheek before stretching a bit. "We probably should get up for a little bit. Gather up the others, make breakfast, and send them on their way. All that jazz."
"Sad, but true. We think our mailman set it up, but I thank him every day for it." Steve said as he sat back down to feed the baby. "It helped me find my someone to love and led us to have a wonderful family. And I couldn't be happier."
"Can I touch it? What material is it made of?" Tony asked, carefully reaching out towards the 'tail'. He was only met with quick recoil.
"You've never treated me like a son, anyway." Tony retorted after a bit more silence, grabbing up his case and pushing past Howard as fast as he was able.
"Dork. I love you though..." He whispered sweetly. Steve continued to pet at his hair, staying beside and later dozing off.
"Uh huh." Peter switched marker colors before fixing up the last of Steve's tattoo, crudely writing 'Daddy' across the middle of the heart.
Fury pinched the bridge of his nose, letting out an exasperated sigh as is right-hand-merman swam up beside him with an expression to match.
Tony rolled his eyes fondly, sitting back so he could tug his shirt off, trying not to frown at the scars. He pulled on Steve's shirt, very close to tearing it off before tossing it aside, leaning down to take a nipple into his mouth.
"You like it though, don't ya Tony?" He hummed against Tony's ears, starting his thrusts long and deep and nibbling at Tony's neck. "Like me fucking you with my huge cock, yeah?"
"Nothing. All the boxes and furniture's in. We'll have to go shopping for our new bed, though," Tony replied cheekily, smearing grease on Steve's cheek, "Thank you again, guys. You're always welcome to stay at che Stark. Guest house is empty, feel free to stay when you're not missioning."
Although they didn't have an official wedding, Steve hummed the wedding march as he walked them into the home with a smile. He leaned in to plant a smooth kiss against Tony's lips, their first as an official married couple, and that somehow made the kiss feel so much sweeter. Tony curled his arms around Steve's neck, gently pulling him down to kiss him till he couldn't breathe, pulling back only when his lungs started to burn.
a blowjob," he teased, "I can barely keep my hands off you at home, why think the first moment we're alone I'd only want a
"Now then, we are having a lazy day today, so that means cereal for breakfast." The blond proclaimed. "Morning cartoons and the like. We'll have a guy’s day today."
Tony ends up in the hospital for trivial reasons, and it turns out to be much more drastic than originally thought.
They relaxed back into comfortable silence, nothing but Tony's breaths filling the air. He soon drifted off, quietly snoring against Steve's shoulder. Steve grinned softly at his snoozing husband, curling up beneath him carefully to keep himself warm in his naked state. Once he found a comfortable position, he easily drifted into slumber alongside Tony.
"Don't be too loud, we don't want the other students to hear," Tony whispered, still stretching Steve out, "I'm going to give you the best fucking of your life, understand?"
"Oh. Are they big people's gifts?" Peter asked with doe eyes as they headed back to the kitchen. "That why I gotta stay with Unca Bucky while youse is gone?"
"Don't worry, I plan to fatten him up a bit. Get meat on them bones." Tony chuckled flatly. "But I would like you to help us build him a style. Poor thing's never been made over."
"Just going to get a wash cloth to clean us up, don't worry." Tony assured with a soft pat to Steve's leg. "When it dries, it gets a little gross and uncomfortable. Plus we should at least get underpants back on. Give us a bit of coverage."
Slightly hesitant, the merman made his way inside, trying to ignore the warlocks, um, 'decor choices' in many skulls embedded in the walls. When he made it inside, he was greeted by a dark figure, the figure's face a vibrant red contrast to the rest of his body.
"Sorry I'm worrying so much. It’s a vacation. We should be relaxing." He admitted. "I'm just...not used to being away from Peter like this. It'll be different."
“Well, compiling any info we can and finding patterns is really all we are going to have to work with for a while.” Tony replied, spearing his eggs with his fork annoyedly “Strange isn’t even in the dimension, so we won’t have any help from that jackass for at least three months. So it’s just whatever mythos we can find of werewolves and our data to guide us until then.”
He sighed, trying to figure out a way to maneuver himself without waking Tony and Peter so he could pull out the cookies.
"I know it doesn't look like too much. Kind of small. But the food and service is great." He explained, giving Tony a soft smile and shrug.
"You nipped my nose, that's what." Steve chuckled, moving in to nip Tony's nose back. "There. Now we're even," he hummed proudly.
Steve looked to him softly, glancing to his stomach and back. "I think your stomach is thinking differently, hon. I can make something else if oatmeal's not your thing."
"Change the sheets real quick, please, I'll be right back," he murmured, stealing a kiss before throwing on pajamas and hobbling out the door.
"Come here," he ordered, rolling his eyes at the sheepish boy, "Don't look at me like that, young man. You know what you did. Get over here."
"It’s your turn to talk with Peter, anyway. I'll try to calm Sammy down." He said, shushing the baby gently.
"Sorry, my train of thought runs faster in my head and I can't quite get it all out," Tony muttered sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck, "I--ah, I don't know. I like big dogs, but they shed a lot and I don't know if my allergies would appreciate it. Oh my god, we should get a little Pomeranian, they're
Steve's moans started quiet as Tony started moving, slowly increasing in volume each time it even barely touched his sweet spot.
The bike wobbled slightly as they slowed to their stop, Steve's control faltering slightly for obvious reasons.
'Aye Aye, Sir.' Steve said, a playful salute and a smirk on his lips. 'Now go before you're late and Pepper fillets ya.'
"You're back! Oh, here I'll help you with those." He said excitedly, taking a few of the bags from Tony and carrying them up to the room. "You get everything, okay?"
"Good God, I feel like I'm on Seinfeld or some shhhhoot right now," Clint muttered, sitting down heavily on their bed.
"Very well actually. The food coma has set in, so half of them are out and the other are relaxing." Steve whispered with a smile, heading toward his fellas. "That picture's gonna be my new background, by the way."
"Something in the middle should be good." Steve explained, wrapping a towel around his waist and hugging Tony from behind. "We'll just be in public, but it’s a date so be dressed slightly nice.”
"Not bad, just embarrassing at the moment, you dork." Steve huffed playfully before Tony started to move downward.
"And I'm pretty sure that's heavily exaggerated." Steve answered, hiding his face in his hand for the moment in embarrassment. He was pretty sure he heard someone giggle from down the aisle at that.
"All yours. Only yours. Only ever yours." Steve moaned, head fallen back against the blankets and pillows. "A-ah, fu-- there, Tony.
Peter nodded, still not speaking as he got out of his hammock and followed his Daddy. He grabbed Tony's hand in his, a pout on his face.
considering your soulmate's a guy." He joked, looking to Tony sweetly. "It’s okay you haven't been on a real date. Neither have I. So we'd be able to figure it out together."
"It's not a waste of time, baby, you know it’s not," He replied quietly, "Don't do that to yourself."
"Y'know, we should probably move to one of our bedrooms," He stated, "Unless you're comfortable lying on the wood floor. Couch would be okay too, if curling up on my quilt is too far."
"All right, all right." He grumbled with a small smile. "How're you feeling? How're... How're the bruises...?"
"Awful, awful man," Tony muttered with no real sting to his words. He drank his coffee and finished off his sandwich, holding the still-warm cup in his hands.
"Good boy, such a good boy." Steve praised, helping Tony through. The way Tony clenched around him soon brought him over, coming with a deep sigh and filling Tony up.
"All right, Mr. Sassy britches." Steve chucked, smooching the boy's cheeks. This earned an offended squawk from Sammy, the babe smacking his leg.
"It's easier to kiss you when I don't have to chase you all the way down to the beach." Tony hummed, putting a hand over Steve's. "I hope that's okay with you, by the way? I've been wanting to at least do that for a while now."
"I'd hope not." Steve answered back softly, hugging Tony close and kissing his face. "But I didn't mean just that way. I meant with how we act with each other, too. I don't want us divided like that, either."
"Then you'll just have to stay in mine till I can get you a more comfy one," Tony replied, carefully stroking Steve's hair.
"I guess." Tony was fiddling with his razor in the tub, more of playing with it than actually doing anything with it; he refused to make eye contact with Steve, opting to stare at the silver in his hands.
Pacing in the room, Tony had already started rattling off the Fibonacci sequence out of anxiety, nearly jumping out of his skin at the hand on his back.
"I tend to not skirt around my desires, Rogers," Tony replied, voice dropping an octave, "I get to my point. Unless you have objections?"
He gently smoothed his hand over Steve's stomach, rubbing circles into his hips while he scissored him open. Steve arched into the touch, noising happily into the attentions.
"But you have the same problem." Steve explained simply, glancing down at the obvious tent in the crotch of Tony's pants.
Steve hummed at the touch, running his hands along Tony's sides. "What're ya doing there, mister?" He grinned down at him.
They had been playing for about 5 hours, all joking and occasionally roughhousing along the way. They were getting ready to play a rhythm game when Steve had to go use the restroom. He excused himself momentarily to do so. When he came back, Bruce was playing the guitar part to a fairly quiet and slow song in Guitar Hero. Tony had fallen asleep in his bean-bag.
"Now how is that going to go with a vampire?" Steve chuckled, noising gently as Tony began to work at his collarbone.
"Yeah," Tony replied softly, leaning up to press a kiss to Steve's chin, "Our young days of being reckless and in love. Now we're just parents in love."
"I can hear ya smoochin'!" Peter groaned playfully, continuing his coloring. "I can't consuntwate on my pit'ure."
do was nod in response. Tony smirked, running his thumb over the slit in Steve's cock; he loved watching him jump, greedily swallowing him back down till the head nudged the back of his throat. Tony held him there for a few seconds before hollowing his cheeks and humming.
Tony nodded, ruffling Peter's hair. "Yeah, he was pretty awful. But he made it easier for me to stay with Pops." He explained softly.
Once on the level of the workshop, Tony quickly typed in the passcode to get inside. His heart skipped, relief coming over him when he saw a big floof of red and yellow fur on the spare couch in the space.
"I love you, too. Very much." Steve whispered back, hugging Tony to him. "We'll help you through this. You'll get through okay, I promise."
"Well we've had a pretty great ride so far." He said softly, lifting Tony's face back up to meet his. "I have faith in us. In you. We can get through this all together. If we plan to get married, that's how it will be anyway. So we best get started." He said, giving Tony a small smile before kissing his lips.
"Holy hell, Steve, I'm so proud of you baby," He breathed, "Babe, you're a published author, and your art's out there--"
"Pete, you can't say stuff like that to your Papa," He sighed, "Even if you think you're joking. He loves you very much and it really hurts him when you say stuff like that."
"Tony, You are the closest friend I have made in a REALLY long time, and I would like to see wherever 'this' could go. I'm willing if you're willing.".
"--She's expected to recover, but we're not sure how much memory she'll have. However, she signed the papers for release last night, and according to her doctor, Samuel is ready for release, if you'd like to see him before signing the last of the paperwork."
The TV flickered to life and the movie began, nearly startling Peter, but he took a breath and kept watching.
"See? He likes you!" Tony said happily, giving the bot a pet himself. "If DUM-E approves, you couldn't be bad. Not that I thought you were, but..."
He pressed kisses all over one side if Peter's cheek while Steve kissed the other, reveling in the boy's laughter.
." Peter stated simply. "An' it looks funny sometimes. Like youse tryna eat 'chother's faces. Looks slobb'ry."
"Buh Daddy makes d'best stuff when he's not careful," Peter hummed, putting the blueberries next to Steve's mixing bowl, "Its good f'him to not be careful."
"She's gorgeous, Steve. I've always wanted to ride a bike with a hot man," Tony grinned, sliding on behind Steve, "Come on, come on. I'm hungry and I wish I could have you."
"Yeah," Tony replied, still dazed slightly, "It'd be convenient to move the diaper station too, or at least put it closer to us, so we don't wake Pete up by opening doors in the middle of the night."
"She's sweet on him." Steve teased back, taking his french toast and coffee bounty into the dining room to sit down and eat before he started the rest of the day.
"There's a woman here to see you, Steve," he announced quietly, "She's waiting for you in the living room."
Oddly enough though, he felt okay about it. With Steve, this felt right. What they were doing should be fast by normal standards, but it didn't feel rushed at all. They only had the summer for certain, at least with Steve as a human. If and when Steve had to go back to the ocean, would the other still want to see him?
Steve nodded carefully, taking a deep breath. "I know. I just-- I'm excited." He said with a grin, kissing Tony back before going off to find grab the blanket they had gotten made for the baby.
He wanted to make sure Howard knew with absolute certainty that he was upset, but refused to show him to what extent. Because as much as he hated to say, Howard was right. With him being basically banished from the campus next semester, he wouldn't get to see Steve anymore. It burned Tony up inside just thinking about it.
He nodded seriously, clumsily reaching down to pull his hospital gown up, showing Steve the red and white lacerations running up his thigh.
"Hey, don't talk like that. You're good at a lot of things," Tony replied, raising an eyebrow at Steve, "I'm the only self-deprecating one in these parts."
"Experiments? Do you wanna learn about the suit?" Tony chattered, hugging the boy close as he skipped down to the lab, "Or we can work on your spiderman suit. Maybe we'll have it ready in time for Halloween!"
Steve squeezed Tony's hand as they headed into the building, being lead into a small office as a meeting room.
Tony excitedly ushered Steve into the room. As he walked in, Steve noticed a few things. The room had a few difference compared to his dorm. There was extra space where a lab table was present. There was a little section that had some sort of chemicals lined up on it, while the other side had a mechanical-looking whats-it that seemed to be in the process of being built. That no doubt was Tony's, he thought.
Peter padded into the kitchen, still in his onesie, a yawn stretching him out. He grabbed one of his kiddie yogurts from the fridge and a spoon, completely ignoring the adults as he went to watch cartoons.
"Right," he eventually replied, staring blankly as Peter filled another page with a Christmas tree and presents, "Happy."
The boy stomped off, door slam much too loud in the house; Tony sunk down onto the couch, head in his hands.
"Of course it is. It’s from Bruce. I expected no less." The blond chuckled, shutting the door behind them just in case. "You got your own, too. You should open it first. See what surprise waits inside."
Steve smirked at that playfully. "Always so impatient. I love it, though." He hummed, making quick work of the rest of the outline. "Alright. I'm done. Now, c'mere." He grinned.
"Considering we have our first words permanently plastered on our bodies, I'd say it’s a pretty good sign we love each other," Tony drawled, lifting his hips up.
Steve gave a gentle nod, eyes still shut. "Haven't been sick in a long time..." He sniffled. "Sometimes I forget how much I hate it. I'm in good hands, though...Thank you, Tony..."
"BUT I DON'T WANT SOMEONE ELSE!" Steve nearly wailed, tears trailing down his face. "I don't care about finances or the business or whatever the fuck else. I want
Sniffling, Tony nodded, busting into tears when Peter leaned up and smooched his cheek. "I love you both, so much," he whispered.
"Is that a robot? Looks pretty neat." A unfamiliar voice hummed, causing Tony to turn and have his eyes met with a Mr. Tall, Blond, and Handsome. And holy cow, was he just a vision.
," Tony snorted, turning into the neighborhood, "I might have to pull over from how much sap is in this car right now."
"Mm. Work. I need to finish a few projects before we leave," Tony sighed wearily, "I really need to get caught up. I'll take tomorrow to bust those out, and sign a bunch of papers for Pep, start the schematics for the next line of Starkphones, and edit Jay's coding so he can be transportable on my phone--"
busy cooking right now." Steve said with a grin. "I don't think I wanna stop the tickle monster, anyway. He seems to be having fun."
Steve looked up over at Peter from the touch, reaching up and placing his hand on Peter's. "I love you, Pete. Very much."
Tony snored on for an hour and some, waking up happily rested. "Mornin beautiful," he mumbled into Steve's skin.
"What's that about Daddy?" Tony asked, rounding the corner, "Sorry, I went and put my own jammies on."
"Don't lose your patience." Steve warned, running his hand down along Tony's back and slipping the boxers off.
"I just don't want it to be so obvious that I painted this half," Tony laughed, "You can fix it up if you want, but I think it looks okay." He paused, knowing a flush was sinking onto his cheeks.
"F-fuck--" Tony writhed in Steve's lap, arching as he tried not to cry out from the pleasure soaring through his veins.
Tony groaned loudly and reached up to tug on Steve's hair, only lasting for a few more thrusts before coming, spilling over their chests with sticky liquid. He cried out in ecstasy, letting his eyes flutter closed.
With Tony having been working constantly down in the lab, it gave Steve plenty of time to plan out what to do for Tony's birthday. He had the evening planned out, had gotten to talk with Bruce in private for help with part of the present. But with all of the time he had to himself, only really going down to the lab to at least make sure Tony was eating and bringing the man coffee, he missed Tony. So he was glad that that the man at least was going to take a break for his birthday.
"No, no, they don't hurt, love," Tony whispered, looking sadly at the multitude of colors nearly covering the underside of his arms and chest, "Thank you, sweetie."
Tony shook slightly, but managed to get an arm around Steve, letting him fall to his side onto the bed. Carefully, he pulled out, still panting heavily.
“Human clothes don’t really fit right on huge ass wolves.” Tony explained back, crossing his arms. “I’ll have to work on something to keep his clothes from shredding each time, but him being in there right now is probably best. Bruce and I are trying to help with as much as we can, but we aren’t exactly werewolf experts.”
dollar couch, not to mention the rug and wall-- when he does stupid stuff, that doesn't warrant a smack. But this--" Tony ran a hand through his hair, leaning back in his chair.
"Okay, Okay. Enjoy the now." Steve chuckled as he settled in again. He kept his eyes on Tony, them drooping slightly in comfort. "I love you." He purred, kissing Tony back before settling into his pillow.
Tony's reply was a soft whimper, accompanied by his fist tightening into Steve's shirt. He nuzzled into the blond's neck, unable to help the stray tears that leaked onto Steve's neck.
He helped Steve lie down on his back, immediately tucking him in under the sheets while he came down from his high.
, and I very well know I'm adorable, because you'll get up and get me coffee in the freezing morning when I'm all warm and snuggled up in bed."
Steve stood silent, watching the exchange nervously and the staring match going down between the two men.
"He wasn't upset with you at all, sweetie." He informed softly. "He just remembered a bad thing that happened a year ago and it makes him really sad thinking about it."
"Now you're just asking for it." Tony smacked the paddle against his backside, smoothing a hand over the skin, "Keep making your punishment worse, Steve, and I might get out the belt for you."
"Steve seemed like such a good boy. And you make it sound like he's the one stirring this up. How do you even manage to get in the principal's office to do that without him knowing?"
"Like-- do that to me? I mean, I have a higher pain tolerance," Tony continued quickly, feeling his face heat up, "But-- yeah, I mean, if you don't want to, that's okay--"
He scooped up Sammy from Peter. "I'll give him a change first, then you two can hang out and play, okay Peter?"
He knew the words would fly over the boy's head, but he kissed Peter's temple anyway, clinging to the boy.
He kissed Peter's forehead, not surprised that the boy scrambled away at the first chance he got. With that, Tony cupped his bowl of soup, stirring it.
"Daddy and I can't help we love each other and like kissing. It’s just what parents do together." Steve hummed in explanation. "You won't find it gross once you're married one day."
?" Steve said, giving Peter a warning look before sighing. "It’s great you've got him this far Pete, but
Tony flicked through the racks, Steve's size in his head as he picked out some white and black laces, nearly falling over in laughter at his third choice; he quickly hid it under the others, saving it for later.
"Steve, Steve, shhh, we got this," Bucky interrupted, pushing on the blond to steer him toward the door.
"Whoa now, Peter. That is no way to act. We never meant any trouble by it, baby bear." Steve explained softly, standing up with a sigh. He looked over at Tony with a shrug. "I was just trying to help."
"I love you too, bambi," Tony murmured, "Now, get some sleep, a certain someone's gonna be up early tomorrow, and probably very cranky about it."
Steve sighed happily at the thought, snuggling Tony closer. "Mm, all the talk about it is going to make me want to go now." He hummed. "I can't wait."
He placed the ball in Steve's mouth, being careful to not pull his hair while he tied it around his head.
Tony thumped his head back again, tugging on his bonds. "Yea, yes, please, fuck me Sir, make love later," he whined, needy, "Please,
"And as your friend/ guide to the human world, it is my honor to take you on your first shopping trip." Tony said with a grin. "We need to get you your own clothes if you are going to be staying here, and then we'll go from there."
Tony sighed and slumped against the floor, tapping his fingers against his chest as he stared at the ceiling. Peter wiggled his way to Steve, laying on his lap and looking up to him.
"I miss them," he managed, closing his eyes to try and keep his tears in, "God, I miss my mother like hell. She should be here to see her grandson, even
"All right then. We're gonna have you brush your teeth and then getcha in the bathtub." He explained, scooping Peter up and booping his nose. "Had a long day, gotta get clean." He grinned.
Sammy continued to giggle from the kisses, cuddling back against his Daddy and reaching happily for his beard again. Tony couldn't help but laugh, brushing the happy tears off his cheeks.
"Awe, thank you, munchkin," Tony laughed, crouching down to ruffle Peter's hair, "Does he have a name?"
"I never put the tantrums on you. You only do that when you are upset with work." Steve laughed along, kissing Tony's cheek. "But I know you try not to. You do well, Tony. You're a great daddy."
"Mmm, love your sounds, Tony. Love hearing you moan from what I do. Love making you feel good--" he purred, making his thrusts harder and quicker with a soft groan.
He barely lasted a few minutes, having to bite his lip to keep from crying out as he came. Steve tilted his head back as he gasped, feeling Tony come undone around him. He let out a quietened moan when he finally came, hands digging gently into skin.
"You catch on pretty quick." Tony said breathlessly, voice a bit husky as he let a hand trail slowly along Steve's chest. "Sure you're just a merman, and not some sort of siren trying to seduce me? 'Cause you feel pretty good at this, and that's not to be taken lightly, coming from me."
"You're not distracting anything," Tony whispered, "Never, sweetheart. Okay? We won't mess around in front of the mirror, but know I don't mind being able to see you in so many different perspectives from what I usually see. It's intimate for
"I can't keep my goddamn hands off you," Tony grunted, biting his neck before dragging him off toward the bedroom, "Too damn sexy, makes my cock stir, damn--"
Tony pulled over a chair and let Peter stand on it, watching his eyes light up as he reached over to pet the baby, as if he was made of glass.
"Baby, I don't know if the marker would be best for those." Steve said softly. "Those lines on his arms are booboos. And Daddy doesn't like a lot of attention to them."
"Nonononono, bubba bug." He said, grabbing up Sammy then scooping up the binky. "Don't need you hurt, too. That would be terrible."
"More than okay. I have a higher pain tolerance than most, Rogers," Tony panted, kissing him back, "I wanna do that again. A lot."
Steve wasn't too sure if Tony should've told him that exactly, but it seemed to stop Peter from worrying.
"It'll be perfect, babe. I just know it." Steve hummed happily, hugging him tight. "It'll be the first thing to call ours." He said, nuzzling into Tony's hair.
"He's gonna be such a good brother," Tony murmured, smooching the skin behind Steve's ear, "He'll be a good babysitter when he's older, too."
"But no one ever said it was my true love. My non-living, breathing, object love maybe. But not my true love." Steve grinned. "My true love is much more special."
"Too old for this, Rogers," he wheezed, ignoring the blond's laugh, "Come, come, you're my personal furnace."
"Alright Jay, do your magic, buddy. Erase all history, and up the protection level to five. Add in an override code, eighteen digits, and send it to my phone, under Steve's name."
He spit out the name of the company as if it was poison. Tony's blood rushed into his ears. He did not sell weapons anymore and for a good reason. It's been a long time since he set his company on a new course. But not twenty-four years. His tongue felt thick and furry when he wanted to say something.
Tony didn’t mean to say that, he wanted the soldier to stay and maybe even comfort him, he wanted it to be the way it used to be. But he knew that wouldn’t work. "Give me the time," he said instead.
It was faster than expected and Steve could only jump quickly, so the creature had fallen over the edge of the ship and dropped hundreds of feet down into the stormy day.
When Steve let his eyes wander, they got stuck at Rhodey. The man stared completely disoriented, now motionless.
Clint cleared his throat. "Barnes was at SHIELD with Wanda earlier and they both asked a bit. The route the ship must have taken would have passed New York City that the States should have had noticed. Now we’ve got to check what went wrong there."
From that moment on he knew what the man meant to Steve and how much Steve meant to the man. He knew the two needed each other, and it would cost a horde of
For some reason, Tony had hoped he would have a moment of peace after Steve had left, even though he'd been surrounded by a depressing silence for so long in recent days. So, it bothered him that almost immediately several doctors and nurses came storming into the room who all demand answers from him and checked the monitors.
Tony nodded. "Dum-E, get the slime from this creature. Wait, no, I’d prefer to do that. No offence."
It took him a few seconds before he realized that this was probably sandstone and there, on the edge of his field of vision, the sky. His breathing rattled and hurt and sweat ran into his eyes.
Clint denied again. "Barely. We can only hope that we find a trail. But at least we now know where the monsters came from. Based on this, we may be able to find out more about these things. About Sam, Scott and the two ... the three agents, we can only hope to find them in time."
It took barely half a second before a person reacted behind the camera. It was apparently a live broadcast because the man answered something with a German accent and then you heard the shot. He echoed loudly in the conference room. The agent Smith fell backwards. The other four jumped and shouted something that none of the viewers could understand.
"That limits the search for the culprit, but it doesn’t make it much easier. There’re a lot of bad guys over there."
"What?", Natasha asked and simultaneously the mechanic turned to Steve. For the first time, he examined him correctly. His blond hair was illuminated by the small display of his cell phone.
"Who is this? Did you get him off the line?" the soldier asked, leaving room to Fury to hear what Tony had to say.
Now the soldier moved. He groaned briefly as he woke up in the uncomfortable situation, then let his eyes glide sleepily through the room. Only a few seconds later, Steve saw that Tony was staring at him. He immediately opened his eyes.
Steve leaned back in the couch and put the phone on the glass table in front of him. "And what do more serious newspapers write about it?"
"I'm sorry, not even traces have been found so far", admitted the AI and sounded a bit disappointed.
"I know. And that’s why I have to hurry now to get down so I can start the analysis before the therapy starts. And the therapy does not last too long, anyway."
"What the hell was that?" Bucky shouted, shooting wildly to protect himself from seven smaller monsters who attacked him.
As the mirrored doors quietly pushed open, he could take a look at the large area. The modern kitchen with the cooking island had been used a lot by Vision in recent months. The new Avenger had cooked frequently and Tony, Rhodes and Natasha had to taste the results. He rolled his eyes. He hobbled to the island as fast as he could to get some food.
The man was talking to agents again and tapping his watch before turning and staring at Barnes. "Rogers, Stark, you knew about that?"
Tony grunted in agreement and flew back to the center of the park. Steve and Bucky were still fighting, but by now they already had a kind of protective wall of dead bodies. Clint's arrows were in several of them, but right now, he stopped shooting. "They're cutting my tree down," he shouted in panic and waved to Tony. Below him, some of the aliens stood and dragged and dragged at the old tree, and some again sought out stones from the exploded bridge to throw them.
Clint waved his hand and the important data hovered in the air above the glass table. Steve was still excited about the new technology, even though it all developed almost a bit too fast.
"I ...," Tony didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t help. He was tired, suffering from severe headaches that had come back and most of all, he didn’t want to face Steve. His stomach tightened, and again he felt like he had to vomit, but he held back any gag reflex.
Tony saw that Barnes raised his eyebrows. "Even if we find him then we would be right in front of him. Alone. Should we attack him then or what?"
Bucky had killed his mother, Steve had known and then defended the killer. Natasha, Rhodey and Vision did not know what had happened back then, they just knew
Tony almost choked. Burkwill had actually got a tank into the city center. He landed next to the two soldiers. "Are you alright?" Steve asked quickly. Tony nodded under the mask, even though he was still sick and hurt, but this was about something bigger than that. The soldier's blue eyes lay on him for a long moment and seemed to analyze him closely. Worry and fear lay in them. Tony turned to the battlefield.
"We will not give any information about the attack and its causes." His one eye watched admonishingly through the ranks. Flashes from the cameras were reflected in his eye.
Vision nodded understandingly. "Could he remember something? When he carried the monster away? Did something happen?"
"Oh, someone looked up what you've been doing recently," Burkwill said. "Aren't miniature cameras not great? Sorry about the coughing thing, that makes the whole thing a bit uncomfortable."
"The floor plan of the building?" Wanda guessed, but Tony shook his head. No floor plan looked like that. "No, that was really a path. The Freedom Trail," he explained. "It practically leads through all of Boston. I used to run along it a lot during my time there," he muttered.
"But first I have something to show you," whispered Burkwill again. He nodded to the lake, which stretched out below them. "There are my people sitting. And there," he said, pointing to the other side of the bridge. "And there."
When Tony woke up again, he needed a moment to realize where he was. With rising fear, he tried to move his little finger to do something. It worked. Relieved, he sighed. He could move. Slowly he opened his eyes and was immediately blinded, yet he didn’t close them. He looked around, his jaw clenched. He lay in a big room. The walls were mostly dark glass, and appliances and other equipment stood everywhere displaying a variety of numbers. The glasses on other side of the room were tinted, but Tony could still see a large park. Then he recognized the place.
"Ah--" he cleared his throat, already feeling the hairs rise on his arm, "--If I told you, you'd probably use it to your advantage, and I
"Y'so good, Stevie, so good," Tony panted, tucking his head into Steve's neck, "I love you, love you so much--"
"You two must've known Tony for a long time, I'm guessing." Steve stated, helping Clint unload the dining table.
"Well that depends on how much you're wanting, birthday boy." Steve said sly. "But you still don't get the surprise until tonight, though."
"Not lying. Sorry." He groaned, feeling Tony's leg rub. Steve moved his hips and rubbed up against it with another groan.
"Well, of course." Steve laughed softly, starting to relax a bit. "Depending on the number of spare sheet sets, we are definitely going to have to do laundry often." He smirked, laying back in his seat. "Just hope we remembered everything."
"Fuck, Steve," Tony put a hand over his eyes, trying to stop crying, "I never-- I didn't want y-you to find out, not like this."
Propped up on the bed, a very tired Sharon smiled over at Tony, a glaze in her eye that hadn't been there the last time they met. In her arms, a little bundle squirmed, tiny hands in the air as a baby's cry filled the room.
"From the mouths of babes." Steve teased lightly, giving Tony's hand a soft squeeze. "Behave, munchkin. And help with your brother, okay?"
"Looks like that nap did wonders, huh bubba?" He grinned, picking the boy up for a smooch when the table was set.
"You're adorable flustered." He teased, smirking at the other playfully and earning a laugh from the human. "I have to go, but I'll come back tomorrow. Promise."
"Yeah buddy, real superheroes," Tony replied with a hum, ignoring Steve's disapproving frown, "Maybe I can make you a Spiderman costume, hm?"
Tony sniffled and crawled into bed, still crying as he laid down; the tears soon swelled into the roaring panic attack he was
Steve walked close to Tony under the spray, wrapping arms around his waist and scrubbed gently to clean him up.
He could feel Steve while their hips were pressed together, the blond's interest nearly hard beneath him and clearly present by touch. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but this wasn't something he had explained to Steve yet. This would be something new and confusing to the merman, and while it is flattering, the thought of having to explain this Steve and show him how to handle it made Tony nervous.
. Your aunts and uncles are lucky you decided to do this now." Steve said, scrunching his nose, causing Sammy to giggle.
"And that's what worries me." Steve said with a chuckle. "I know what happens when you are 'interested' in something. It basically means I'm gonna be your little experiment."
He could hear Steve beneath him, the soft mewls coming through his 'voice box' from the sensations. The blond moved his hands underneath Tony's shirt as well, slender fingers skittering softly along the sides. As infatuated with Tony's light as he was, Steve knew not to touch it. Everything else as far as he knew was fair game.
"Love ya too, Daddy." Peter said, kissing Tony's cheek back, making grabby hands as Steve showed up with his cheerios.
"Now remember, we have to sanitize before we go in and stay fairly calm so we don't freak him out, okay?"
Steve almost had to gather up the composure to speak, feeling Tony open him up. "I dunno. I'm not sure if he's the jealous type." He explained. "I don't exactly go around with other people to know."
"Sorry, babe." Steve hummed sweetly, a smirk playing on his lips. "How's about you come and warm me up, hm?"
"I can see why," he smirked, "You make the cutest noises, and look so fuckable over my lap. Does your boyfriend find places to spank you? Get his hands all over your ass until your cock is throbbing?"
"Oh, you're not kidding." He breathed, eyes raking lower with a pleased noise. "You are so great, you know that? Absolutely wonderful, I swear. Damn."
"Every single line. Ma thought it was the cutest thing ever. Lord knows if I could even remember it all now.".
"Oooh, you're gonna make me shiver with antici.......pation." Steve joked back playful, leaning up into all the touches. "Love hearing what you plan to do with me."
"Oh yes you will. That's getting dry-cleaned and stuffed in the closet. Right in front." Tony grinned, nuzzling into Steve's side. "Love you, officer Rogers," he snickered.
"I dunno what to tell you," he mumbled, "I think he has two dads, and you're the one who's good at emotions and shit."
"Y'all are a bunch of pansies," Clint said around his cookie, almost choking when Bucky thumped him on the back.
"Fuck yeah," Tony breathed, slipping his hand in to palm at Steve's cock through his boxers, "I want you in me, over the table. Got that?"
Resting his head against the swing, Tony smiled fondly at Peter, happiness and thankfulness swelling in his chest as he watched his little boy laugh and smile in the sun's rays. Eventually, Peter tired himself out and Tony had to carry him back to the picnic blanket, not surprised to see Steve with Sammy perched on his lap, reading a book.
"Got you, baby, I got you," Tony panted, gingerly pulling out of Steve and wrapping his arms around him.
"Yessir," Tony replied almost shamefully, shivering at the silk wrapped around his wrists, "I'm sorry, Sir. I won't disobey you again, Sir."
." Steve said in faux realization, grinning and kissing gently at Tony's chin. "What would I have to do to prove that I am yours and only, truly yours?"
"Yeah. Pete had fun messing with my new StarkPad," Tony chuckled, kissing him back, "You look frazzled. You okay?"
"Well, it'd be whatever he can eat all right." Steve answered. "When we find out what he can have, you can help pick out stuff that he might like to eat."
"I'm gonna give him a bath, then you're giving him art lessons and we'll go get him his own sketchbook," Tony hummed, taking the baby bag from Steve, "We'll have a movie after, and I'll make some pasta for us. Good?"
"Well I'm not letting them stay home alone, either. What're you talking about?" Steve laughed, kissing Tony's collarbone chastely. "I'll be the one to embarrass him by showing the girlfriend or boyfriend the baby pictures."
"You're our baby, our first baby, and we love you so much, honey, no need to cry," he whispered, booping their noses together, "Everything's okay, I love you so much."
"They won't have me stay overnight, either, so I might as well stay at Bucky's till I get better," he muttered.
Steve did nothing but pant and nod in agreement, taking a moment before rolling off of Tony with a huff of breath. His nerves twitched, still feeling his high.
"Son of a--" Steve said nervously, quickly bandaging up the gash and scooping Tony up. He rushed up the stairs and headed into the kitchen, looking for the keys to the Mercedes, some juice and something sugary to eat before heading out to the garage.
“No... I could’ve sworn U had followed me outta there, though!” Tony answered getting antsy again, “We should probably go and check— oh man, she’s gonna be so mad if I let her in there by herself!”
Tony nodded, grabbing the brush and visioning Steve's mark, taking a second to trace it with his finger before starting to paint. Steve glanced at Tony's tattoo, moving to paint it on. He used the Victorian lettering that Tony had wanted, moving his brush fluidly.
Steve just grinned at that. "I was just speaking honestly. My mouth has never had problems behaving before." He hummed.
"Aw, baby. I didn't know, I'm so sorry, don't cry." Steve said apologetically, entering the room slowly. "I just wanted to be sure you were being careful with your brother. You can still surprise Daddy? I was very surprised with what I saw. You were being so good, Peter.".
"But I don't wanna." Steve said with an exaggerated pout. "The bed's comfy and you're warm and-- Jeez, you've made me lazy." He chuckled, nuzzling into his pillow.
"Okay, you go hide, and I'll hide, and we'll get him," he whispered back, helping Peter to the floor.
Steve leaned in and kissed Tony's lips gently, giving a content hum. "I love you. You always help settle my thoughts."
"Eager Mcbeaver wants your attention," Tony laughed, standing with Sammy on his hip, "I'll clean up in here, Papa, you go watch a movie."
"I can't wait." Steve said happily, squeezing Tony's hand back with his good hand. "Can't wait to take our little baby home."
There sat a young man. Not that Steve wasn't young himself, but this guy looked like he should be in his last couple years of high school and not in college. The younger man had semi-neatly kept, dark brunette hair and deep chocolate brown eyes that looked like they held a whole other world within them. He seemed slightly small with a semi-slender body build. And there was a slight bit of fuzz under his lip, where it looks like he hasn't been trying to shave it in fear it would never grow back.
"I'll playfully tease you, but not be mean." Steve assured softly. "I'd be a bully otherwise. And I hate bullies..."
