He picked up the soldering iron and nearly fumbled. Tony shuddered as his mind connected the dots and furiously sorted everything out. Dread and fear washed over him and he opened his mouth to give JARVIS a word of warning.
Steve made quick work of the rest, and before long he was able to free Tony from his prison. Any exposed skin that was in contact with the roots was raw and the deeper wounds glistened with a red tinge. He gave Tony’s shoulder a solid shake, but the other man stayed unconscious. He was still breathing though, and seemed otherwise uninjured.
A whisper of something threaded through the fingers of fog, almost dampened to silence but not completely. It slithered over the rocky ground, flitted out of reach of Steve’s combat boots, and twisted in the air. The sound dissipated as if it was never there. It was so quiet, Steve would’ve missed it if he wasn’t listening. A thin creak.
Tony scowled. “I can handle myself, Rogers.”
Tony groaned. “Please tell me I’m not seeing what I’m seeing.”
So what if he was self-centered and spoiled? And a multitude of other negative personality traits? He still had his Tower, JARVIS, and the armour. That was all one needed in life, really. After all, he was Tony Stark.
Tony looked down at the wrench held loosely in his hand. He was sitting in his lab, and he didn’t know how long he’d been zoning out for. A holographic image of something or other spun in the air above him. Even after careful consideration, he still wasn’t sure what it was supposed to be. Tony placed the wrench down on the workbench and crossed his arms. If he tilted his head just right and squinted, the contraption vaguely resembled an espresso machine mashed up with flight stabilizers and air conditioning.
Jan leapt up and shrank down to Wasp size. She hovered in Steve’s face. “If I hear anything about you hurting Tony, you’ll regret it!” With that, she flew off with a zoom.
“Tony, what’s wrong?” Steve set the torch down at the fire and grabbed Tony by the shoulders to bring him back to the fire. “Stay close to the fire. I need to get to the tree.”
The surprise HYDRA attack in the late afternoon managed to put a dent in the armour and loosen several components, so Tony placed one of the more damaged pieces on the table in front of him. JARVIS helpfully brought up a schematic of the piece, a pauldron. The holographic 3D model glowed an electric blue, while the damaged parts were highlighted in red. Tony reached for a screwdriver and got to work.
Tony raised the faceplate so he could bare his teeth in that obnoxious grin Steve didn’t like. “Aren’t you the one who said I don’t follow orders? Besides, it’s for science!” He rolled his eyes again when Steve just kept looking at him. “You’re not changing my mind. See you later.”
Tony flapped his hand in Loki’s general direction. “I know how to get home, Loki. It’s fine, I can handle myself. Go have fun with your dance battles.”
Twenty minutes later, Tony admitted defeat and stopped. The fog was still pressing in around him and visibility was still down to zero. Throwing caution to the wind, he called out. “Steve? Can you hear me?”
Tony jerked. “Jesus, what’s with everyone and sneaking up on me lately? Never mind, don’t answer that.” He squinted at Steve. “What are you doing here? Were you just lurking about outside like a creeper while everyone else is partying?”
Tony swayed, but his eyes stayed steady. It entranced him, filled his being with something barely comprehensible. His thoughts stilled under gossamer threads of quiet. He pressed a hand against the glass to steady himself.
Sam looked at Steve in consternation. “What the hell happened to you guys in there?”
Normally, Tony would have replied with something smart, but terror still clung to him. “I- I don’t know. Let’s get out of here. Fury’s got all the data he needs.” He grabbed Steve’s elbow and tugged.
“This isn’t funny, buddy.” Tony blinked in the darkness, but all he got were bright bursts of light flashing behind his eyelids. Looking at glowing holograms for so long had made it difficult for his eyes to adjust.
“Is that why you’ve been lurking outside the club?” Tony tried to stop and turn, but Steve’s hand remained firm and steady, and he nearly tripped over his feet. “Who knew you were hiding such creeper tendencies under that perfect face. Wow.”
Tony drank the last of the coffee. He scrunched his face and looked into the distance. He considered his options. “Not today. I have work to do. At home. I can do tomorrow though.”
He took a few more steps and looked around. The suite looked just the way he’d left it earlier that day. He glanced back at the open elevator for support, then walked further into the open-plan living area. The silence was a palpable heaviness around him and he flexed his fingers. The servos in his gauntlet whirred, but even they seemed muffled. Tony crossed the room to look out the expansive windows.
Steve looked up at the opening. “Do you think you can hang on to me? Or can you fly us out?”
“Tony!” It was futile. Steve knew that sound simply did not penetrate the Timefog. No sound came out, and no sound went in. Visual was only marginally better. Even with his senses enhanced, Steve could only see a few feet into the fog.
He huffed. “So that’s where you were hiding him. Thanks for showing me.”
It’s too late.
The tree roared and Steve sighed. “Yeah, that’s what I thought.”
“Fire.” Tony let go of Steve’s leg. “You have to burn it, Steve.” He had to stop to catch his breath. “That’s the only way.”
He tried to pull the offending hand off his shoulder, but Steve wouldn’t budge. “If you insist on going in, then I’m going with you. We don’t know what’s in there, and it’s better to stay together.”
A hand clamped down on his shoulder. “Tony!”
Steve squeezed his shoulder. “Not your fault. I can get us out, but you’ll have to hang on to me, okay?” He draped Tony over his back and made sure his grip around his shoulders was secure before standing.
Tony shook his head and pressed his hands against his cheeks. He ducked his head and grinned.
Steve grimaced. “Don’t distract me, Tony.” His muscles bulged as he tensed. “Loki is right. You’re heading away from the Tower.”
Jan raised her eyebrows. “What was it about?”
Tony gripped her hand. “It was-” He scrunched his face and looked at her. “It was crazy. I was being chased by something in the Tower, and something was wrong, and there was something about an elevator?” He looked down at their hands. “That’s so weird. I could clearly remember everything when I woke up, but now I barely remember any details.” He didn’t mention that even if he suddenly forgot what the dream was about, he still felt visceral fear just thinking about it. He smiled at her uncertainly.
A slithering sound caught his attention. With his eyes adjusted to the darkness, Steve spotted a tendril reaching towards his leg. He huffed and cut it down with the shield. The root seized and curled spastically into itself, before withdrawing into a crevice. Nothing else came at him, so Steve looked towards the only source of light in the cave.
Tony winced and rubbed the spot she poked. “Okay, fine. Do you want proof too? A selfie of Steve and me at the Power Gym? Or wherever?”
It was Saturday, and Jan was throwing a party at Club A.
Even with minimal lighting, Steve could tell Tony looked unwell. That was an understatement. The paleness of Tony’s skin contrasted unpleasantly with the heavy darkness under his eyelids. His face was streaked with dirt, and his breathing was so slight Steve had to watch carefully to make sure he was still alive.
“We have to start somewhere.” Steve forged resolutely ahead. “Teamwork doesn’t just happen spontaneously. You have to build a foundation. Work on interpersonal relationships.”
Jan turned her head so quickly Tony thought she was going to sprain her neck. “Oh my God, you’re right! His face is so red. Wow. I guess he heard us.” She turned back and glared at Tony. “And I’m serious, he was totally asking you out! You need to say yes!”
“At your current heading, you will come out of the Timefog in approximately eighteen minutes.” JARVIS’ voice announced, crisp and clear.
Tony trembled where he was pressed into the corner. “Do I assume that you’re still here, JARVIS?”
Receiving no response, he tugged at one of the roots holding Tony in place. A faint hiss and it shifted, but stayed in place. Steve gripped it tight and ripped it away from Tony’s chest. A shriek pierced his ears and sticky black fluid sprayed across his arms.
He stood there, in front of the Dojo, quiet and motionless. He still couldn’t pick up anything peculiar with his senses. But suddenly, a flash of colour in the corner of his eye. Steve turned his head and looked. And did a double-take.
Tony scowled. “No I’m not. Look, it’s right there!” He threw a hand up in the Tower’s general direction. At Steve’s disbelieving expression, he looked in the direction he gestured in. All he could see was the edge of campus in the distance. A smattering of trees and buildings petered out into the dim haze that was the Timefog.
Steve frowned and pulled back a little, nodding his understanding.
Could they?
"Yeah, you keep saying that but, uh, weren't you doing philanthropic medical work in Calcutta when Romanoff here dragged you into our little freak show?" Tony asked, but Bruce leveled him with a flat look.
Stark swallowed again, and Steve felt something hard pressing against the thigh he had shoved between Stark’s legs, but Stark just fought to keep his composure and said, “I take it you’re the self-appointed  disher-of-desserts?”
with… But not in this instance. Not here, not now. It was a boy. It had to be. And besides, Steve wanted a boy, and if Steve wanted a boy, Tony would give him a boy.
He let out a heavy breath. "Oh, boy. Here we go. What's that?"
"What?"
what Tony thought about this.
"It's not a

Tony closed the doors and went back over to the counter where he'd stacked all the goods, and Steve nodded his understanding as Olivia began to whine. He frowned at her and said an unsure, "Uh…?"
Like seeking out the aid of the witch.
"Hey! I thought I was supposed to be 'Natasha' in here." He looked at the doctor. "Isn't that what you said? He's not following the rules!"
The entire morning, Tony felt off-kilter and cotton-brained. Neither being electrocuted multiple times in Dr. Pym’s lab nor the coffee he had in the morning did much to improve his energy levels.
Finally, the elevator kicked into motion, and the terrible moaning faded.
“Most definitely, Sir.”
He gave a choked scream and spun on his heel, whipping his hand up on instinct, forgetting that the repulsors weren’t working.
He nearly leapt out of his skin.
Steve’s hand was a solid point of warmth. “You’ve been saying that a lot recently. Have you been sleeping at all?”
Steve settled into parade rest and looked him in the eyes. “It’s already been discussed with Fury. I’m staying here with you until you’re done.”
Natasha studied Tony’s wounds and wan face with a critical eye. “You’re going immediately to the infirmary whether you like it or not, Stark. You look like you’ll fall over even before I taser you.”
He jammed the shield in again and held on as the ground trembled and bucked. The tree roared and the root nearest to Steve ripped out of the ground and towards him. He retrieved his shield and leapt away just as the root slammed into the space he occupied a moment earlier. He cut down a flailing limb. “That all you got? I’m not exactly impressed here.” He hefted the shield and threw it at the black wound.
Tony’s brain felt like it was steeped in molasses. “What? No, nothing. I’m just tired. I need to go home.”
The elevator slowed to a gentle stop and the doors opened.
She patted his hand. “Do you want a hug?”
Steve frowned and held onto the armour. “That’s not a good idea, Tony. Fury didn’t say anything about going in.”
Steve crept closer, shield in hand, and grimaced at the sight in front of him.
Tony shook his head in consternation. Jan being concerned was one thing, but Cap? Totally random. Maybe Steve was feeling particularly in touch with his emotions today.
Steve nearly vibrated with tension. “I talked to JARVIS. He said you’re free tonight or tomorrow.”
Tony ducked his head and fiddled with the coffee cup. “Right. Uh. Yeah, sure. I’d like that.” He ignored his burning cheeks. “But try not to dent the suit, okay. I just cleaned it the other day.”
“Right. Making sure that I’m doing okay. Did Fury also tell you to do a psychiatric evaluation on the narcissistic man-child that he sent for this highly important mission?” Tony looked at the readings from his gauntlet’s holographic display. “Because clearly I can’t be trusted to do anything important by myself, because I’m careless and don’t care to think about anything other than fooling around, making myself look good, and throwing money around. Right?”
A spasm ran through the other man. “Steve, Steve, it’s too hot. I can’t do it. Get it away from me. Steve!” Tony grabbed at him, fingers white with effort and panic.
Wasp’s voice spiked sharply in excitement. “Right?! You’ll look so hot in this, the campus won’t know what hit it!” She settled down and grabbed his hand. “But really, you look under the weather. Are you sick?”
A weak chuckle sounded by his ear. “Getting a piggyback ride from Captain America himself. Who would’ve thought?”
“Very well, Sir.” The lights and sounds of an active workshop fade until it’s dark and quiet, with only the light near the elevator illuminating the space. “Are you feeling alright?” Tony picks out the concern in JARVIS’ voice.
He shuddered and pulled his covers up past his ears. Clearly, he needed to stop thinking and start sleeping. He wiggled into a more comfortable position and closed his eyes with purpose.
Tony turns off the soldering iron and sets it in its cradle. He looks about the workshop in a daze and decides sleeping would be more productive than whatever he’d been attempting (it had seemed important). “I’m calling it a night, JARVIS. Shut it down for me, would you?” Distantly, he wonders at the detachment in his voice.
“He’s right, you know.”
Steve choked and tried to loosen Tony’s grip. With a heave of his body, he rolled them closer to the fire and trapped Tony’s body beneath him. He grabbed Tony’s flailing hands and sat on him. “You have to fight it, Tony!”
Tony rolled his eyes. “I’m going in to get better readings. Being outside the Timefog isn’t really giving me anything new. Don’t worry your old self, Cap. It’s only a little ways in.” He smirked to himself. “You can sit this one out if it’s giving you the heebie jeebies.”
The howl that erupted from the tree shook Steve’s bones and jarred his teeth. He ripped the shield out of the trunk and the howl turned into a shriek that threatened to rupture his eardrums.
Tony veered left.
“Let me go!” The sheer panic in Tony’s voice made Steve feel ill. “Let me go, let me go, let me go, let.
Steve nodded enthusiastically. “Of course. Monday then? Or would Tuesday work better for you?”
He left Steve standing at the doors.
Tony shivered. “Yeah. I decided to go in to get better readings. But then I thought I saw something, and JARVIS was acting up. But hey, got some fresh new readings for Fury, so success?”
“Nooo, you have to stop. Listen to me. Steve definitely wants to go out with you! He’s socially awkward, and you’re socially awkward, that’s why you’re having communication issues.” Jan grabbed Tony by the face again. “Trust me, I know what I’m talking about!”
Tony snarled at him and tried to buck him off. Steve held fast.
Loki sniffed. “I was going to challenge you to a dance competition, but I have to say I agree. It would be too easy a win against you in your current state. I’ll challenge you another time.”
They hugged for a good moment before Tony drew back. “Okay. Now, please tell me there’s a good selection of cheese here, because I’m craving some cultured milk products.”
He should probably apologize to Steve in the morning. Thinking back, their argument after class had been completely silly and pointless. Way to annoy the one guy who would volunteer to have your back, Stark. That and the whole Timefog business had turned the day into a gong show. Then again, if Steve hadn’t been there annoying him with his all-American face, he probably wouldn’t have gone into the Timefog in the first place.
Tony woke with a full body jerk. He looked around his bedroom with a hammering heart until he realized it was the alarm that woke him. The last vestiges of an already forgotten dream slipped away, leaving only unease in its wake. He took a gulping breath and pressed a hand against the arc reactor. It was just a dream. He was fine. Everything was fine.
They picked through one of the available cheese platters, undisturbed by the other party goers. After a quiet moment, Jan placed her hand on Tony’s knee. “Did you want to talk about it?”
He assessed the situation.
Steve sat him up and got an arm around his shoulders when it was clear Tony couldn’t summon the strength to hold himself up. “I’m not leaving without you, Tony.”
Tony hummed noncommittally. “Maybe later.” He leaned into Jan, glad that she was such a good friend.
He grinned fondly. “That’s the spirit, J.”
On the far edge of campus, a figure walked at a sedate pace towards the undeveloped side of the school. A figure that was wearing gleaming red jet boots. With a gauntlet. Tony was walking away from campus at two in the morning.
Tony flexed his numb fingers. “Right. Lead the way then.”
“Oh. I guess so.” Tony hummed. “He also really wants to do a training session with me, but I fobbed him off on JARVIS.”
He unhooked the shield from its harness and hefted it in his hand. He cast his eyes about and strained his ears to hear more. Another creak, fainter but longer than the last. Steve advanced silently, grip tight on the leather of his shield straps. The cheese trail in front of him became uneven, spotty. The cheese seemed to be running out, and Steve hoped that Tony had enough left to complete the trail, wherever he was going. He refused to imagine Tony hurt and compromised, stumbling about in the fog with no way out. Tony was fine. Tony was smart and clever, and knew how to get himself out of difficult situations if he put his mind to it.
Steve stared at her, eyes wide. “Yes?”
Tony’s knees nearly wobbled from relief. “Oh I’ve missed you, JARVIS buddy. Never do that again.”
Jan huffed. “Oh, Tony. Maybe he actually means that he wants to be friends with you! I understand where you’re coming from, but sometimes an offer of friendship really is an offer of friendship.”
Steve grabbed the offending appendage and looked at him funny. “Are you okay, Tony? I’ve been calling for you. Did you not hear me?”
Tony patted her shoulders. “Okay, okay. I get it. I’ll take your word for it.”
Steve grinned at him. “How does tomorrow sound?”
Tony stepped around Loki and headed in the general direction of the Tower.
Today was no exception. The two of them had another argument after classes ended for the day. It was another stupid fight where Tony tried to be as obnoxious as he could and Steve exercised his disapproval. He had to admit, he’d said some words he wasn’t proud of, but Steve had hit back just as hard, pointing out all of Tony’s shortcomings like he was reading off a checklist. All of it had lodged itself in Tony’s brain, bouncing around like a pinball game with no game over.
Tony groaned and rolled his eyes. “Fury can go clean his eyepatch or whatever he does. I’m going down to the workshop. Alert me only when it’s absolutely time to head out.”
Tony crawls into bed and closes his eyes.
Terror gripped him.
Steve leapt onto the carpet of roots and brought his shield down hard. The entire structure trembled and bucked as if trying to throw him off. But Steve held on, and brought his shield down again and again, until the web he stood on splintered and caved.
Amazingly, the guard started strolling casually toward them, as if nothing was out of the ordinary.  He couldn't see them well enough to realize that Don and Hank were partially free, Don realized, not coming from the brightly lit other room into the dark open space of the warehouse floor.
"We can't destroy him." Tony's artificially distorted voice behind her made her stiffen. How long had he been there? How much had he heard? Carol should have heard his metal boots scraping against the pavement as he came up behind them, or felt the disruption in the air as he landed.
Wanda snorted. "We could have used you a few months ago in LA. He and Hank took the microwave apart to use some piece or other of it to make an electromagnetic field generator."
"It's not the same," Tony's voice was still low, tired. "You don't have repulsor beams in your gloves." He half-raised one hand, palm facing out, and Steve could see the small bruise on the inside of his elbow, where the IV needle had been. "You have no idea how easy it would be to... I blew a man's head off with them."
“No,” Steve agreed.  “Most people lead boring lives.”
Did every woman he knew other than Wanda have to sound so gleeful? He wasn't that bad, surely. Tony buried his face in his hands, closing his eyes; it felt strange to rub his hands over his face and not feel the slight rough catch of facial hair, another reminder that his body wasn't his own anymore. "I hate my life," he muttered.
"They probably got it from the Russians; they've got stockpiles of just about any kind of dated chemical weapon you could want." The newcomer shook his head, looking disgusted, then added. "I'm Jim Rhodes, War Machine. Everybody calls me Rhodey. I guess you're Spiderman?"
were cheaper to produce. The contract should have been theirs on the basis of quality alone.
Carol's lips twitched. "You were nineteen. Would you be that stupid now?"
"So, what did I miss?" Clint's voice.
Sam wasn't sure it had as much to do with the recent Registration mess as it did the fact that superheroes showing up in the middle of a building evacuation had never been taken as a positive sign by most New Yorkers.
The Wanda spoke again, and proved his assessment completely wrong. "Chthon is trying to free himself from his prison and return to this dimension. That's why he sent me here."
What hold had he had over Sin, that she would carry on fighting for his warped cause even after his death, to the point where she tried to
Cap let go and slowly withdrew his hand, looking miserable. He reached back and rubbed the edge of his shield, sighing. Peter wondered if Cap was even aware of that particular nervous habit; he was pretty sure he was the only one who had noticed it.
The library was one of the rooms in the house that Steve had always associated with Tony; there had been a lot of nights early in his time with the Avengers when Steve had spent hours very late at night or early in the morning sitting in the library talking to Iron Man. He'd usually been woken by nightmares of the war or the explosion that had killed Bucky and trapped him in the ice; he'd never known what Iron Man's reasons for apparently never sleeping had been.
Thank god. The implications of his theory were frightening, enough that Jan preferred not to think about them. The squid's partially decomposed tissue samples were almost a relief in comparison.
"That sounds dreadful," Aunt May said. "Were many people killed?"
. "The team doesn't have time for this right now.
"All right," Steve said, "I think we can make that work." He hesitated, and then, unable to resist asking, "How are you going to explain this," he gestured vaguely at Tony's altered body, "to the board members?"
"How else was I supposed to promote my book?" Carol edged around a trio of businessmen who were standing smack in the middle of the path to the main door, talking loudly to one another.
Tony sighed, his shoulders shuddering again. "Sorry. I'll be out in a minute."
That was a very good question, actually. Would the pregnancy just disappear? Jan doubted it - a spell handcrafted by Loki would never be that convenient or nice. Yet another reason for Tony to decide not to keep the baby; it wasn't worth his life.
He reached out wildly for more power, all of his careful training and discipline deserting him, and it was there, waiting hot and orange-gold as fire just beyond his reach.
"I said I'd dance with you somewhere public," he went on. "How could you think I'd want you to lie about us?"
He could hear the ring of Thor's boots against the floor and felt the edge of Steve's shield brush his armor as the two of them drew even with him, blocking Doom's exit from the vault.
he sighed, not bothering to mimic Agatha's voice this time.
"Anything else you want to see as long as we're here?" Steve asked, as they left the exhibit, sliding an arm around Tony's waist, quietly reveling in the way Tony leaned into him. He'd missed this, too; Rachel was an incredibly passionate woman, but she wasn't much for simple displays of affection.
Usually he couldn't keep the cat away when he was fletching arrows — the feathers and the sinew he used to bind the fletches on were apparently some kind of cornucopia of cat delight, and Matt/Patton/Churchill would sit inches from his feet and
She looked larger than life, leaning casually against the edge of Doom's desk as if she owned it. Some trick of otherworldly power made her seem more real than her surroundings, turning the rich gleam of the desk's polished wood dull and the glow of the LED desk lamp thin and watery. The barbaric splendor of all that armor and fur should have looked silly alongside the sleek, expensive computer and other electronic equipment. Instead, she wore it with as much aplomb as Doom did his own armor.
Clint said.
The X-Men would know for certain, would probably be able to give her every detail of what had happened to her brother over the past year, but asking them was out of the question. No mutant who knew what she had done was ever going to willingly speak to her again. Not to the woman who had accomplished with one sentence what Reverend Stryker and dozens of other anti-mutant Extremists had tried to achieve for decades. Even Pietro, if he was all right, might not want anywhere near him.
"That sounds like a good plan to me," Steve said, grinning more widely.
The wind was cold, much colder than LA, but at least the air out here was clear. A strand of hair lashed at her eyes, catching on the edge of her mask, and Carol shoved it away with the back of her hand. "Just think, we could have spent the past half hour fighting something with twelve tentacles that oozes caustic slime."
Rhodey snorted. "The next time you open a conversation with 'Rhodey, old friend, can you do me a favor?' remind me to say 'hell no."
He made himself turn away from Tony and Thor, back to Sam.  "You said Sin vanished as well.  Are any of the intruders still here?"
It still surprised him occasionally to wake up and find Tony in bed next to him.
"Why don't I like the sound of that?" Jan asked.
"Maybe I should suggest that Tony earmark his next donation for that gallery. Can you do that?"
Tony nodded once more, not saying anything. Clint was having enough trouble getting the words out as it was. And Tony had done more than his fair share of sleeping with people in deeply unfortunate circumstances; who was he to throw stones?
"A warehouse where?" Jan pressed insistently.  "Where did Thor meet with Loki?"
"Don't ask," Don muttered. He glanced down at his cane, debating for a half-second the merits of turning into Thor and letting him handle this. On the one hand, with Carol apparently back on the West Coast for the day, Thor was the only Avenger here capable of going toe-to-toe with Loki. On the other hand, Loki might very well react to Thor's appearance in the lobby by blowing the building up, along with all the innocent bystanders who happened to be in it.
“So,” he finally asked, after several minutes of watching her try not to pick at the edge of the bandages on her hands, “are you… going to be okay?”
"That's a useful trick." She didn't say thank you, probably because Steve, in her shoes, would be worried that his phone was going to either be damaged by Tony's hacking, or simply self-destruct when he tried to turn it off. He'd seen the promotional material for the StarkPhone; it wasn't cheap, especially the super-thin little black models like that one.
SI would have been desperate without this deal, though, so Tony had shoved his unease to the back of his mind, smiled across the table at his audience, and done his level best to make explaining the data on various powerpoint graphs and spreadsheets sound vaguely dirty. He'd discovered long ago that anything could sound suggestive if you said it with the right intonation.
"You should leave him alone. He'll come out when he's ready." Wanda swept her cards into a pile with one hand and started shuffling them again, then cut the deck and laid three cards face up.
In the recesses of his mind, Don was protesting that lithium toxicity was grave indeed, but Thor overrode him.  "Nay, I do not think he shall."  Any other outcome was unacceptable.  He would not stand helplessly by while a comrade died before his eyes due to Loki's treachery.  "But we must be gone from this place, and find him aid."
Hank shrugged back into his lab coat with an inner sigh of relief, and closed the storage cabinet door firmly on the folded pile of red fabric he'd just shoved inside it.
Hill shrugged one shoulder. "For our purposes, it doesn't matter whether she's actually hearing her dead father's voice in her head or just thinks she is."
Steve jolted back to alertness, leaning forwards, his eyes focusing intently on Tony’s face.  “Tony?”
At least Simon was safe in California. Maybe she ought to be grateful that he hadn't spoken to her yet. Apologizing to Clint had been difficult enough; she didn't know how she was going to face Simon again, after Chthon had used her to destroy Vision. She couldn't afford to mourn Vision yet, not with Chthon still attempting to break free, and she couldn't be around Simon without mourning him.
"Good." Tony said, forcing his voice to be steady again. He opened his eyes and looked up at Steve, managing to dredge up a smile from somewhere. "If you're going to stay, though, you'll need to put on some eye protection. I wasn't kidding earlier about the hot metal."
"Aren't you going?" he asked Jan plaintively, when the date had begun looming inescapably over him. "Can't I just go with you? Or not at all?"
"It  ain't," Logan announced, dropping his evening-long pretence that he  wasn't there with them, wasn't listening to them, and didn't know them.   "Spidey here was just giving us a demonstration of why it took him  until now to figure out that you two have been sleeping together for the  past two months."
"I don't usually have doctor's appointments. And when I do, they're generally on time." Most of Tony's hospital experiences had involved the emergency room, and if there had been any waiting, he'd been too unconscious to notice. He'd tried to avoid doctors entirely during his first year as Iron Man, when he had still needed the breastplate to keep his damaged heart beating properly, and even after his heart condition had become public knowledge, the habit had stuck.
"We have contingency plans," he said, trying not to let his bitterness show and probably failing. "The Tieri contract was not a guarantee." Except it had been, or should have been. Layton and the others were right to be angry.
"You mean, like the video camera in the Helicarrier's morgue?"
He'd been able to do that, once. Not since Afghanistan, not really - he'd lost the ability to not care what people thought of him at some point in those caves, building the armor slowly under Yinsen's watchful gaze - but before that, no one's opinion had mattered. His father's always had, but his father had died, and the longer Tony spent in charge of SI, dealing with the people Howard Stark had screwed over, the more he realized that his father had been a deeply unpleasant man whose opinions were not necessarily worth respecting.
However much he'd spent, it had been worth it; getting the outside of the building completed in three months was nearly miraculous in New York, where scaffolding often clung to the outsides of buildings for years.
Doom inclined his head.  "Perhaps.  And perhaps not."  He lifted his own energy weapon and shot a long stream of blue-white fire at Clint, sweeping it across the hallway as Clint dropped to the floor to duck beneath it and started to roll back to his feet.
"He can hear just fine from over here," the Falcon called back, taking a step forward so that his body was halfway in front of Don and Loki. His teammates occasionally forgot that he was a superhero as well, and every bit as capable of defending himself as they were; maybe it was the cane.
Clint froze, the visible portions of his face a study in shock. "Shit," he blurted out. "Don't tell me Tony's dead."
"Yeah, but since he's still alive, I'm guessing he was in the armor. That time he wasn't, and Rhodey was. And then he went on some kind of rampage, and Tony had to put on some suit of armor he'd made out of scrap metal in our lab and chase him down. But he's been great for years, and Hank's mostly sane now, so maybe-"
There was no furniture in the front hall, but the staircase and the marble floor were the same. Untouched, this time, with no sign of the crack in the floor where Thor had once dropped his hammer, the uneven spots in the plasterwork where scratches and gouges had been filled in and painted over innumerable times. The smell of fresh paint and dry plaster dust was everywhere.
Loki's malicious laughter rang in his ears.  "You've made it even easier than I expected, Thunderer.  No mortal heroes to aid you, no Warriors Three to guard you.  I didn't expect you to be alone when you used my pretty little toy.  It makes a woman wonder."
"I'm sorry," he blurted out. "I shouldn't have done that."
," Hank snapped, and then, "Sorry.  I haven't been awake much longer than you have."
He was debating the merits of re-introducing fleximetal into the armor's knee and elbow joints when the knocking was repeated.
Hank, Jan knew from long experience, frequently didn't notice what women were wearing, and sometimes didn't even notice their hair color. But he still noticed her, even after their relationship's spectacularly messy ending.
Steve appreciated that.  It meant he didn’t have to pretend to be reassured.
"I kept the knife," he repeated, more loudly. "Took it 'way from the sonuvabitch who cut me, after I broke 'is wrist. S'in my coat pocket."
Tony waved a hand. "If I have to, I can go back to the West Coast and fly back any time they have a new spell to try on me. I actually had to be in New York this week anyway, for a board meeting." He made a wry face, and added, "I'm running a lot of SI's R&D department from the West Coast now, but most of my board don't want to go any further from Wall Street than you have to go in order to go antiquing in Connecticut. Not unless it's to Europe."
"What solitude?" Don muttered. "There are three hundred Asgardians there now, and they're all huge. And loud." He knew what Thor meant, though, much though he didn't like admitting it. Neither of them were lonely for company; it was a different kind of loneliness. He missed having people to talk to who understood, whom he didn't have to pretend around.
And there were still tests left for him to perform on Tony's blood samples. It was why he'd stayed behind in the lab after the others had left. This was his job, now, and he intended to do it right. He might not have been able to turn Tony back - it had taken Loki's magic to do that - but he could at least make sure that he and Don hadn't missed anything. Make sure that there truly were no side effects from all that time Tony had spent as a woman. Or from his brief and ill-fated pregnancy.
Jarvis's reaction the next time he saw the top of the coffee table was going to be interesting.
Wanda nodded. "We know. The spell is too complex to be solely Loki's work. Dr. Strange believes he had help from another magician, and I agree. Not the Enchantress, though; it's much too subtle for her."
"I hate magic," he muttered, and fired his repulsors at the nearest Doombot just on general principle.  Then he spun to aim them at what he was assuming was Doom himself, and groaned internally.
"It's funny. I meant to bring her back, and then I found her, and we had sex, and then I was on a plane headed back here. I was in the Heathrow airport when I saw the press conference you all held after you took down the Mandarin and Red Skull." He shrugged, scrubbing a hand through his hair. "I think maybe I took advantage of her somehow, like maybe we made some kind of trade." And what a way to prove himself worthy of that second shot at life; he hadn't deserved to die, but men who took advantage of women were scum.
Good for Jessica. That must have been before she'd decided that Simon needed to hear what Wanda had to say.
Steve reached down and took Tony by the wrist, pulling him to his feet. Tony stiffened, hissing through his teeth as the bruises Steve knew were there under his shirt must have made themselves known.
His own project, Steve decided, was hopelessly unfixable. He hadn't been paying enough attention to his work, and he'd nearly erased through the paper in two places, and the vase was still lopsided. He wasn't getting the curvature right, or the reflections.
"BMW?"
Steve shook his head, but Tony thought he saw his lips twitch, just for a second. "I'll go tell them you're awake," he said.
"It would be nice not to have to once in a while."
Tony left the doorway and went to stand beside Wanda. "One of us should have realized that something was wrong before it was too late," he said, keeping his eyes on Hank instead of on her.
“I don’t-“ he started, not sure if she wanted a chance to compose herself before speaking to Wanda, or if she was just being polite, and Carol gave his shoulder a little shove.
Tony’s lips stretched into something that might have been a smile.  “You’re a terrible liar.”  He hadn’t had a chance to shave in the past twenty-four hours, and dark stubble blurred the edges of his goatee, stark against pale skin.  All traces of the gold underarmor were gone, reabsorbed back into wherever it went when the armor shut down.
"I wear a bra," she said, dryly.
"I'm not." Carol's voice was firm, level. "Not anymore."
"We're not talking about Hank."
"Jan's not creepy," Steve pointed out. "And she apparently wanted you." He was still a little bitter over that, jealous, if he were honest. Even discounting the fact that Tony had entered the relationship under false pretenses, before he'd told Jan that he was Iron Man, and that the ink on Jan's divorce papers had barely been dry... if Tony had had to date a fellow Avenger, a little, selfish voice whispered, why couldn't it have been him?
"I think he thinks you're still dead," Peter blurted out.
"You mean, like LSD, the walls are melting?"
Jarvis had 'suggested' that it might be time to move Matthew Churchill Patton/Avenger-cat/Redwing's Lunch over to the mansion at least three times in the past week, ruthlessly quashing Tony's objections that the construction work might frighten it and/or provide it with an entire new realm of things to break, get stuck in, or otherwise destroy.
"You take the Wrecker, Iron Man," Steve ordered. "Your armor has the best chance of standing up to his crowbar. I'll take Piledriver. Falcon?"
He shook his head, trying to force the high-pitched ringing noise out of his ears, and reached out for the bent remains of the lamppost he had hit, his gauntlet clinking dully against the metal. The armor's damage reports scrolled through his head as he pulled himself upright; it was barely dented.
The blond American hadn't been the only person who'd come here to see her. As the thing-that-was-not-her-aunt spoke, a hazy memory tugged at the corner of her mind. There had been another visitor, a beast-man with blue fur, who had accused her her of doing something terrible, and had begged for her help. She had laughed at him. She didn't know why; she had listened to him plead, and opened her mouth to apologize, to tell him she was sorry, but she had no idea what he was talking about, but instead she had mocked him, and sent him away. She hadn't known him either, but she had the nagging feeling that she should have, and that she knew the blond American from somewhere else, too.
They ought to have sent someone else to come and fetch him. It wasn't fair to send Jan.
Pepper raised her eyebrows. "After six years of working for you, it takes a lot to surprise me," she said dryly.
ooOOoo
She knew how to fight. She had to remember that. She had combat training from some of the most skilled fighters in the world; she could protect herself.
Chthon and Loki and the threat they both represented were far more important than his personal problems, whatever those were.
had a few more things to focus on.  Tracking down Doom's location was vital, but it didn't feel like they were accomplishing anything.  At least if he had a tool of some kind in his hand, or a computer system to mentally hack in to, he'd feel like he was
It wasn't difficult work, by any means. It was just, as a rule, deeply boring. On the other hand, boring meant that nobody in New York was trying to blow anything up, which was always a plus.
"I know," Steve said, trying not to think too hard about what Bucky killing someone 'not cleanly' might have involved, even if that someone had been a monster like Crossbones.  "But if she's hurt Hank or Jan, I don't care how crazy she is.  SHIELD's psychologists can have her when we're done with her."
Wanda was sitting up in bed, an IV line in the crook of her arm.  They had stripped off her costume and put her in a light blue hospital gown, and her hands were wrapped in bandages – from touching the spear?  From Strange’s tattoos?  In Times Square, they had glowed with so much power that her gloves had been burned away.
If Tony was being honest with himself, that probably played a larger role in his decision that they didn't need to take on Wanda right now than he really liked to admit.
"Yeah," Clint said, his voice strained. "We stopped Loki." He looked and sounded as if he were trying not to laugh, and kept darting little glances at Tony.
Strange lunged forward and seized the spear in one gloved hand, striking Sin's forearm with the other.   He twisted it free of her grasp and leaped back, miraculously avoiding tripping over his cape, just as she broke Carol's hold.
Tony grinned. Joking about it somehow made it feel, if not less real, then at least more remote, less important. None of the other Avengers were willing to touch any subject involving Stane or alcohol in any way that wasn't dead serious and slightly judgmental.
She had kissed him the first time to make him stop crying – silent, embarrassed tears he had been trying to hide behind his hands, his shoulders shaking. "He was like the big brother I never had," he'd said, "and I never got to tell him that, you know?"
Tony really, really hated magic.
There were times when Tony really loved other engineers. He stood, unobtrusively gripping the back of his chair as he did so, and ushered everyone else out of the conference room with a big, fake smile plastered over his face. Then he closed the door firmly behind DeFalco and sagged against the wall, pressing one hand to his stomach.
The first Doombot had appeared directly in Wanda's bedroom.  She had been awake, fortunately; she didn't sleep well these days, not since they'd brought the Dee manuscript into the mansion.
– "I'm sorry Chthon did that to you."
"Not everyone wants to hear apologies," Wanda said, "or explanations." There was a rustle of cloth as she shifted on the worktable; its hard, metal surface couldn't have been comfortable, but Hank hadn't moved the couch in yet. It, like the ants and other live specimens, would be transported last, after all the equipment was in place. "I... tried to call the X-Men. Only Beast would talk to me, and he won't tell me where Pietro is. He just wants to know how I did what I did, and if I can undo it more completely."
"You'd run out of money and lawyers long before the world ran out of idiots," he told Tony.
He was never sure if she was joking or not when she said things like that.  Was Clint the only heterosexual person on the entire team?  Hank barely counted, what with naming himself after various female insects.  The next thing you knew, Sam would turn out to secretly like guys, too, and Jan would hook up with She-Hulk and that would be kind of hot.
"Okay," Clint gasped.  "I'm-okay."  He didn't sound okay, or look it, but if he could speak, he was breathing again.  "She's fav-favoring her left side.  I tried to flank her.  Don't let her kick you."
Tony shifted uncomfortably, rubbing at his chin with his hand and feeling the rasp of his goatee against his palm. As frustrating as the Extremis's new limits were, they weren't completely unmanageable – he'd functioned without it, been Iron Man without it, for years. Even if the Mandarin's rings had burned his Extremis abilities out of him entirely, the way he'd initially feared, he didn't need to sense the armor in order to wear it and control it. He would have missed it, though, like missing a limb he'd only recently grown but had already come to rely upon. Like missing the burn of alcohol against the back of his throat.
Steve let his head drop to the side of the bed, onto his folded arms, and let his eyes slide shut. Tony was going to be okay. Tony had to be okay. He just had to keep telling himself that.
He moved automatically, the moment he saw her face start to turn away from him.   The edge of his shield came down on Sin's right forearm with a crack of shattering bone, and the spear dropped from her hand.
"I'm too busy trying to run my company and pull my weight on the team and keep the people in DC who hate me even more now that I've debauched Captain America happy to have time for anything else," Tony was snarling, as he snatched his laptop and tablet off the floor. "Get out of my lab. I have work to do."
"I don't know what's right any more." Tony's voice sounded strange, quiet and hoarse and choked off by the tightness in his throat, and, as always these days, not deep enough. "I don't think I've known for a long time."
Wanda had just plugged the deep fryer in and added the oil to it, planning to help Jarvis chop vegetables while the oil heated, when an electronic chirp announced that the Mansion's proximity sensors had been triggered.
Tony practically stalked out into the hallway, shoulders stiff. "I can take care of myself, Steve," he said, when the door had fallen closed behind them. "I haven't suddenly become fragile or breakable just because I got pregnant and had a miscarriage. I've recovered just fine from far worse. I don't need you to coddle me."
Tony eyed the little toy with a smirk. "I can't believe you kept it. I thought you hated all that Captain America merchandise they used to sell. Which you really ought to have gotten some sort of royalties for, by the way."
"It's not your fault," Tony said, just as Steve said,
"I can't believe you didn't tell me about the two of you," Wanda was saying with forced cheer, giving Tony a playful shove. Tony swayed with the motion, completely unsmiling; he looked shell-shocked, pale. The session with Strange must have gone very badly. "Now that you're a girl, it's your obligation as part of the feminine sisterhood to tell me and Jan exactly what Cap looks like naked."
It would have been frustrating, if it weren't so cute.
"What should I do?" Steve asked, his stomach going tight with old, familiar fear. Tony's heart was going to stop beating right in front of him; he was going to keel over, blue-lipped and gasping, and then-- "Can you charge it up here?" he asked, ruthlessly cutting off that line of thought, "Or do I need to call Happy or Pepper or somebody?"
"Fine," Tony muttered, distinctly ungracious. "Get Strange, then. Don will just apologize more."
"I need to finish this first," he evaded.
"Ansel Adams is not the only famous landscape photographer to take pictures of the American West," Steve said primly.
It would have made him uncomfortable even were it not Tony, even had it not involved him. That kind of devastation was private. They had had no right to—
"Oh, thank you," Wanda said dryly.
"I know. I've done that. It ended up with Steve dead and Tony suicidal and half of us hating the other half." Carol narrowed her eyes and pointed at Wanda. "Tell Tony I want to talk to him," she added, grimly.
Strange ducked fluidly out of the way, shouting something incomprehensible, and glowing red bands of... something... wrapped around Doom's torso, pinning his arms to his sides.
"How powerful is she?" Hank had folded his arms across his chest, the glass pipette forgotten in his left hand.
Tony watched Clint leave, then turned to Steve. "I'm not used to taking days off. I was bored." He looked up at Steve, offering him a smirk. "You said you'd stay here and distract me."
"Took Jan and Hank?" he echoed.  There really was a disturbing amount of blood covering Sam's costume.  He thought of Bucky's SHIELD uniform, the night Sin had caught him with her poisoned dagger, and of Sharon's face and hands covered in bright red blood, so much blood, all over her skin and clothes and tipping the ends of her hair when she bent forward and it brushed his face, and was that why Doom had needed to drain that man of blood like a slaughtered animal?
"So," Pepper said, her voice serious and businesslike, "do you want me to call a press conference for tomorrow, or do you just want to walk into the meeting Tuesday unannounced and break the news then? And if you're going to do that, can I watch?"
At least, that was what Steve had concluded at the time. Now, with a little more perspective on where Tony's head had been back then, he wondered if there might not have been more to it than that.
Right now, though, it felt obscurely comforting to have Cap stride in and take charge of things. It was something familiar, something Wanda had thought that she had lost forever, during those few brief hours when she had believed that Cap was dead.
"If you even think about killing me and wearing my skin," Loki hissed, her breath hot against his bare cheek, "I will make you scream as no mortal man ever has before you die."
"You're my friend, Tony," Steve said, turning his face to the side to dodge the kiss. He could smell Tony's sweat, not unpleasant, but
"Good work, Avengers," he said, making sure to glance in Tony's direction so that he would know he was included in that statement as well. "Now, what were we doing before these goons showed up?"
Don exchanged glances with Hank, frowning thoughtfully. "You gave him misoprostol?"
He was halfway to his feet when the guard realized what was happening.  The man shouted, drawing his gun and charging forward.
There were moments when Steve doubted that, but saying wouldn't do any good. Neither would getting angry, which was impossible anyway when Tony was touching him that way.
Tony avoided reporters like the plague these days, both in and out of the armor. He had adjusted the armor's voice modifiers to conceal his new, feminine voice, but he was still paranoid about the idea that someone might notice a difference and connect the dots.
Tony's punch glanced off Steve's shoulder as Steve twisted his upper body back out of the way, and then Steve grabbed him by the arm and swept his foot around to knock Tony's legs out from under him.
"Not be pregnant! That's what I want to do."
"Your aura has altered." Strange was staring intently at him now, the piercing blue gaze unnerving, as if Tony were a particularly interest specimen on a lab table. "Here." One gloved hand traced a circle in the air just over Tony's heart, and Tony felt his stomach lurch.
Alcohol, however, wasn't the only way to make things easier to handle for at least a little while. And Hank was still staring at his half-exposed breasts, albeit with a slightly wild-eyed expression, as if he truly wanted to look away, but couldn't.
Sin laughed, a surge of glee filling her. She and her father would reshape the world in his image, create a new Reich on American soil, one that truly would last a thousand years.
Steve sighed. He really would have liked a home-cooked meal, but not enough to go through the effort of cooking it. Not when he still ached all over from getting tossed around by Doom's magically augmented laser blasts. "Call whichever one you want. I want pepperoni - Sam will, too - and Jen will want a meatless one with mushrooms and peppers. Actually, you'd better make that two with mushrooms and peppers."
The Doombots' green surcoats and capes were on fire, burning with the same green flame that hedged them all in, and white and red chaos lightning crawled over their metal armor.  Only one still looked normal, and he was trying to simultaneously destroy one of the others and attack a twelve-foot-tall Jan.
What the hell had that been? His heart was pounding, and he felt sick, shaken, and desperately in need of a drink. Where had he known that man from? Why didn't he remember?
"I think Steve can handle you arguing with him," Jan was saying. "It's good for him. And accepting Loki's help isn't out of the question as a last-ditch solution, but I don't think things are that desperate yet."
to," he repeated, voice sharp and brittle again. "I-"
"Pepper got to me first," Steve confirmed. "Trust me, the threats aren't necesary." Watching the way Tony had been hurting while under the toxin's influence had been agony. And watching and being unable to help had been nearly unbearable. There had been far too many times in the past where Tony had been hurt and Steve had found himself unable to do anything, but this time had been one of the worst, because he had so much more to lose now. "The other day, I-" He broke off, not knowing how to continue or even if he wanted to.
going to kick Hank out, but his staying wasn't a good idea, and Steve doubted Jan would welcome his presence as a longterm thing. And to his credit, Hank clearly knew that.
On second thought, Tony pinned underneath him, panting, his lips parted and his skin streaked with sweat was not actually any better than Tony straddling him. It didn't help that Tony was acting more like his old self than Steve had seen in over a year; not just the way he had before the transformation, but the way he had before the serious drinking had started, before the bizarre lashing out of the armor wars. It was as if Steve had suddenly been given his best friend back.
"Loathe as I am to admit this, my treacherous kinsman hath a point." Thor sounded aghast, through whether it was at the idea of being used as a vessel for Chthon, or over the fact that he was agreeing with Loki, Tony wasn't sure. "Only a monster would do such a thing to a woman who was with child."
"Carefully," Jan said. "I have plans for Hank's ass that don't involve you damaging it.
Awake.  “Good.  That’s good.”  The doctors had brushed his questions aside when he’d asked about her, and it had been obvious from their careful non-answers that no one been sure whether or not she would ever regain consciousness, and if she would still be Wanda when she did so.  Strange was still unconscious, so no one was entirely sure what Wanda had done to banish Chthon, but she had used the spear to do it, and everyone else who had tried to draw on its power was either dead or badly injured.
He couldn't look at the dark hair falling down her back without remembering what it had felt like, couldn't look at the clothing without remembering the body under it. The body she'd never chosen to show to him.
"I can get the next round of refills," he said.
"Did he really just make air quotes when he said 'law' and 'morality?'" Clint asked. He ducked a roundhouse swing from one of the A.I.M. hirelings and slammed his elbow into the man's ribs, doubling him over. Then he turned back to their main antagonist, an arrow nocked and ready to shoot.
"You're not listening, are you." Steve said.
He had fallen out of the sky like a rock when Loki had reversed the spell, landing in a crumpled heap on the ground like so much discarded machinery, and Steve had stopped breathing, utterly convinced for one horrible, stomach-churning moment that he was dead.
Steve  had never heard MJ sing before; given that she'd had several small  parts on Broadway, it shouldn't have been surprising that she was good.   Peter had told them all at great length about how wonderful she was  when he'd proudly announced tonight's performance at breakfast every  morning for the past three days, but he wasn't exactly an unbiased  witness.
Tony's stance was a perfect mirror image of Steve's, leading with his right foot instead of his left, in classic southpaw fashion. "So it's because I'm an amateur," he snapped, "not because I'm a woman. Interesting how you never went easy on me before."
Atlas laughed. "Make me, little man."
"Oh." He wasn't sure if that made things better, or much, much worse.
Carol gave an absent hum, and turned another page.
A home she had destroyed.
"You're easy to see, even with all that dust in the air." It wasn't much, as jokes went, and Clint didn't smile again.
"It's been a very long year." The words sounded more serious than Steve had meant them to, largely because they were true.
Carol snorted. "Hank and Tony and Thor are all idiots. There wasn't anything else they could have done, not with the way HUSAC was breathing down our necks. Tony's going to give himself another breakdown if he doesn't stop feeling personally responsible for every single bad thing that happened under the SHRA."
Tony smiled. "I can do that."
"I'm sor-" Don broke off. "Right."
"Cap told you to get a tetanus shot, too."
Real screw-ups followed you around for the rest of your life.
Hands closed around Wanda's arms like a vise, and she was yanked violently off her feet as the grand staircase collapsed in a crash of splintering wood and plaster dust.
The entire team was gathered on the Mansion's back lawn to watch the quinjet arrive, just as they had not quite three months ago, when Tony had first returned from California. Jan, Steve suspected, was there to prove to herself, and possibly to everyone else, that she wasn't bothered by Hank's presence. Don Blake, doctor's bag in hand, was ready to whisk Tony off to the Mansion's infirmary as soon as he stepped off the aircraft. Sam was there because Steve had asked him to be, because he needed someone to keep him from pacing back and forth with nervous tension and snapping at everyone. Wanda hadn't given a reason for coming, but from the way she was fiddling nervously, rolling a tiny ball of chaos energy around her fingers, Steve assumed she was there out of concern for Tony.
"No." Wanda made a slashing motion with one hand, dismissing the statement. "No we don't. She's coming here. I can feel her coming. She's the source of the chaos power Strange and I have been sensing. I don't know how I didn't realize it before."
"Clint wants me to kill the Marcus character off in a really bloody way. You know, he's got something he needs to talk to you about, and you should probably go easy on him when he tells you."
“I don’t even know what she did,” Jan admitted.  It had stopped Sin, or whatever it was Sin had become, and that was all that mattered at the moment.  If there were any side effects... they’d deal with those later.
He'd come so close to losing this.
He was wearing make-up, visibly smudged around the eyes. It looked... strange.
If he let himself start, it was far too difficult to stop, even after months of Steve's solid presence at his side.
Jan would be there. She might even be leading the post-mortem on the fight with Agatha Harkness and the Masters of Evil. She and Steve alternated as chairman of the team these days.
"I was young and innocent then. I didn't realize how hard it was to get costumes to drape properly and still stand up to abuse. Looking glamorous takes both planning and hard work."
They made it all the way across the hall and into the Greek and Roman gallery without seeing anyone conscious. Carol hesitated at the entrance, her eyes flicking over the dozens of statues that lined the massive hall. Any one of them provided enough cover for a man or woman to hide behind, and the stone columns that supported the roof only made the potential for an ambush worse.
Tony spun on the ball of his right foot and launched a kick at Steve's stomach. Steve's hand clamped around his ankle and yanked, his foot sweeping Tony's supporting leg out from under him, and then Tony was flat on his back, staring up at the high, white ceiling. He rolled before Steve could pin him, and scrambled back to his feet. "I thought we were done with this whole chaos spear thing after Strange took care of it last spring." At least Strange was awake now, though the fact that Chthon had been able to take him out so easily made that less comforting than Tony would have liked. Worse, his hands were apparently going to take days, maybe weeks, to heal completely.
Steve went still, his eyes going to the living room door for a moment before returning to Ben and Tony. Sam, Clint, and Jan were probably all waiting on the other side, trying to listen in. Jan, as co-chairperson of the Avengers, had an actual reason to be present for this interview. Clint claimed he was waiting outside to 'offer moral support,' by which he meant 'satisfy my burning curiosity.' Sam was also there for moral support, but in his case, the offer was genuine — he didn't need to spy, not when he knew he could just ask Clint for all the gory details later.
"We don't know what this substance he and the others have been exposed to is," Dr. Brackett said gently. "We have no idea what it's currently doing to them, or how it's going to continue affecting them. Our lab is running tests right now, but it's going to be a little while before we have any real answers."
She had a split-second impression of a dozen bodies, far more than the two guards her mole had described, and then the floodlights came on.
Steve flushed, and pulled one of Vision's noir stories off the shelf at random, going to sit in the chair opposite Wanda.
"I was planning to," Tony said, not quite snidely. "I caught a couple of hours of sleep at the office today, at lunchtime. I can go to bed after I finish this for SHIELD and go over today's security scans from the cathedral and run a probability scan on where the next subway accident is likely to be." Which meant he'd skipped lunch.
For a moment, Jan found herself missing Hank so much that it hurt - not the controlling, unstable jerk he'd turned into, but the Hank she'd fallen in love with. She had smiled at him like that, once upon a time. They had been teammates and partners before they'd been married, and she missed that almost as much as she missed the feel of his arms around her.
"We may not have to fight either," Steve said, with determined optimism. "Wanda only said that he wants to break free, not that he actually can. Without her to take the spear for him, he's in the same place he's always been."
"I think we're the ones who need her help, actually," Steve said, his face wry.
"A perception of unreliability is a death sentence, especially in the current economy." Layton again, harping on his favorite topic. He'd been an accountant before rising to executive level responsibilities, and profit and loss and balance sheets were near and dear to his heart. Tony might have empathized more if he wasn't always such an irritatingly pompous doomsayer about everything. "There isn't a bank in New York that would loan to us if we needed it," he went on, "or extend any significant amount of credit, not when there's no guarantee who will be in charge of SI in six months."
"Wanda," Clint blurted out. "You remember me now. I mean, you look... are you okay?"
Tony winced, wanting automatically to deny it – wanting to deny anything that Thor said to him in that tone of voice – but knowing that it was true. He wasn't especially proud of it, but the ability to follow through on the most practical or effective course of action was vital in the business world as well as in politics and superheroing, and someone had to be the pragmatic one. "This has nothing to do with that," he said, instead. "Steve, will you just compromise for once? Sometimes surviving is more important than principles. We don't have to actually
Surely Strange had to know this was happening? A magical event of this magnitude taking place practically on his doorstep would be impossible for him to miss.
It would, Steve reflected, be reassuring if Tony occasionally demonstrated a little more concern over his own health. The Extremis allowed him to shrug off injuries more quickly these days, but not
The inside of the cathedral was dark, illuminated only by the candles on the high altar, and by the flickering red glow of a dozen or so tiny votive candles left burning below the image of the Blessed Virgin. A middle-aged white man in a green windbreaker was praying at one of the stations of the cross; he didn't look up when they entered, Strange's magic subtly clouding his perceptions and hiding the two of them from his sight.
One of the Doombots had stepped back from the fight, and was tampering with the vault door, trying to manually bypass the security.  Had Doom programmed it to take care of the door, was he remote-controlling it somehow, or had he actually deigned to show up for this fight in person?
They make horror movies about this kind of thing."
"You really think I'm having a miscarriage?"
Steve's frown deepened, his jaw tightening. "The Red Skull is dead. Who is she taking orders from now?"
"About time." Carol let go and floated back from the beam, rolling her shoulders to try and work the strain out of them. She resisted the temptation to rub at her eyes — her hands were too covered in debris for that to do anything but make things worse.
Hank didn’t say anything, just turned his head into Jan, his eyes closed, and Don immediately felt uncomfortable and intrusive.  He cleared his throat awkwardly, deliberately letting the end of his walking stick clack loudly against the floor.
"Actually," Tony said, for the sake of accuracy, "he can't.  Not as long as the Helicarrier's in motion."
Tony put a hand on his arm, giving in to the impulse to touch him, and didn't contradict the obvious lie. "Someday, we will manage a date that does not end in supervillains or disaster."
"As long as we're discussing unfortunate hair, I think we all need to have a moment of silence to contemplate the horror that was Tony's perm." Jan gestured at Tony's with her empty shot glass.
"Steve," Tony said, sounding halfway between exasperated and amused at  Steve's expense, "I really don't think Luke and Jessica need a  chaperone."
"I want the Scarlet Witch alive," a male voice proclaimed.  "The other two are unimportant."
The result was immediate and explosive. Tony's eyes snapped open, and he came up swinging, fist catching Steve in the face hard enough that he saw stars for a moment.
The artificial heart was ugly and alien-looking, an asymmetrical not-quite-circle of grey metal surrounded by scar tissue. There were a lot of scars, more than the last time he had seen Tony shirtless.
"Jan." Hank spun around, his face heating and the bottom dropping out of his stomach.
Life would be much easier if other people weren't so inconveniently binary when it came to sex. Change into a different gender and suddenly no one knew what to do with you anymore.
sick — part of him, in fact, felt very aggressively healthy — but the memory of Tony curled into a tight ball on the bed, eyes screwed shut in pain and dried blood under his fingernails, was still vivid.
It wasn't surprising, exactly, especially given the response Peter had received from the school district when he'd revealed himself as Spiderman, but it was still disappointing. It probably didn't help that the press had still not gotten tired of the shocking revelation that he and Tony were a couple, something they seemed to find more newsworthy than anything the Avengers had actually done over the past month, which only seemed to spur various self-appointed 'moral guardians' on. The last time he'd called the team in LA, Simon had answered the phone with "West Coast Avengers; we don't give interviews about Tony Stark's sex life." He'd been embarrassed and apologetic when he'd realized who he was talking to, killing Steve's hope that he'd recognized the Avengers Mansion's number on the caller ID and was only joking.
Tony stood obediently, stepping forward to mold himself against Steve's body. His hands still on Steve's waist, he pulled their hips flush together and kissed Steve, hard.
It paled beside the infuriating loss of the spear’s power to the Scarlet Witch, but that had been defeat at the hands of a foe who, while not as great as Doom, was still worthy of at least minimal respect.  Being forced to allow SHIELD’s busybody agents to haul him – him, Victor von Doom – away in cuffs, on the other hand…
"Tony. I'm sorry it took me so long to get here. They wouldn't let me in the ambulance."
Tony rolled his eyes, secure in the knowledge that no one could see his face. "There are times when you're even less mature than Spiderman, Hawkeye." He probably should have been amused by it; people had been reacting to his sex life with everything from envy to disgust since he'd been seventeen. He didn't feel like being amused; his head hurt, his chest hurt, and reporters were starting to cast glances in their direction.
"So, Captain America, how's your boyfriend doing? He was a total wreck the whole time you were dead, and I was wondering if he'd gotten over that yet?"
Wanda was silent for a painfully stretched-out moment, staring at him with a stiff, blank expression. Then her face twisted, her eyes going bright and glassy with tears, and she jumped to her feet, leaning across the table and enveloping Tony in a hug.
Wanda smiled. "Thank you," she said. "I would like that."
"Safe," Carol repeated. "You mean, like Strange was safe?" Even at her worst, even when she'd been drinking, her problems had never caused anyone else to be hurt. She had come close once or twice, avoiding it only by luck – Tony could have been injured badly, that time she'd thrown him through the wing of a plane, or the airliner itself could have crashed – but nothing like the trail of collateral damage Wanda's possession by Chthon was leaving, even now.
She pulled him towards her, nails digging into the edge of his jaw, and kissed him.
"That's good, I guess." Very good, actually. He might still be angry with Tony, and disappointed that his friend had turned out to be not quite the man Steve had thought he was, but he never wanted to repeat that horrible week the year before last, after Tony had disappeared for nearly a month and then turned up again in St. Vincent's hospital, half-dead of hypothermia, malnutrition, and a raging case of pneumonia.
Steve nodded.  “Do you need to sit down?” he offered, as she came to stand by his side.    As much as he didn’t want to, he gently slid his hand from Tony’s hair and sat up straighter, ready to surrender the room’s only chair to Wanda.  She’d drained herself to the point of unconsciousness to save them; in her position, he’d be dead on his feet.
"Iron Man is fine," Tony snapped. Hank glanced back over his shoulder to see him propped up on one elbow, glaring poisonously at the crowd in the doorway. "Now go the hell away."
But none of them would know the aftereffects of chaos magic as well as she would, and none of them were here right now.
Wanda and Tony looked up with twin startled expressions. Then Tony looked away, misery clear in every line of his body.
"You don't have to forgive him just because he's hurt, either, you know. If you're still mad at him, you're still mad at him."
"You're going to be okay," he said, and for a moment, he could almost hear Sharon's voice echoing the words, touching his face with bloody hands and lying to him desperately.  You always told people they were going to be okay.  He brushed a few pieces of hair back from Tony's forehead, and tried to think of something more comforting to say.  "Just lie still.  We're calling an ambulance."
Doom's mailed fist slammed into Steve's side, knocking him off balance.  His shoulder hit the side of the vault and he pushed himself off it, intent on blocking Doom from reaching the doorway, just a fraction of a second too late.
"The big guy doesn't like it when people betray him," Jan said. "He takes it personally."
"You really were awesome," Peter said.  "I liked the second-to-last one best, the slow one."
"You what?  There are manual releases.  What did you do to it?"  He frowned slightly, and the light on his discarded chestplate flickered on for a moment.  The scattered pieces of armor wobbled, then went still again, the light going dark.  "Ow.  Okay, bad idea," Tony said, and tried to sit up.
"Unfortunately, I think most of the people with our level of experience already have commitments." There were more and more superheroes becoming free agents again, now that the Initiative was no longer mandatory, but people who had already opted out of it weren't likely to want to get involved with it once more.
Behind him, Clint had an arrow nocked and ready, hopefully one with a blunted tip. He was making an effort to walk quietly on the stone floors, but his boots still made audible clicking noises. Sam was having more luck, moving nearly silently beside Steve.
Tony took a step toward him, intent on finding out, when a hollow boom sounded from one of the upper stories, followed by a loud rumble as the floor abruptly shook under his feet.  Part of the building had collapsed; he hoped it wasn't structural.
The moment her eyes — and weapon — left Sam, Clint released the arrow he'd had drawn and ready. It tore through the air in a graceful arc and slammed into Sin's shoulder.
The gym at the mansion wasn't finished yet, and wouldn't be for at least another two weeks, so they were still using the one at the Avengers Tower – moving into the mansion was proving to be a slow, gradual process, and even now that the vast majority of both of their things had been moved over, and both they and Wanda were sleeping there, they still seemed to spend about eighty percent of their time in the tower. It was where everyone else was, where the fully functional lab was located, and where the gym didn't still have only half a floor.
Pepper let out a short bark of laughter. "Really? You and Rhodey are the most oblivious men on the planet. I mean, for God's sake,
He took a step forward, and Tony, without even thinking about it, found himself taking a corresponding step back, right into Rhodey. He wobbled on the stupid heels, and Rhodey put a steadying hand on his shoulder.
ooOOoo
"Yeah?" Clint said. "Well, we regret the time you let Magneto pick your clothing."
"I'm already packed," he said. "When do you want to move in?"
They were supposed to be copies of Ultron V, complete with fixed, glowing red grins, but Jan had tweaked the scenario, turning them into generic robotic figures. Hank appreciated the gesture, though it might have been nicely cathartic to pound the snot out of a series of slightly-malfunctioning Ultrons.
She grabbed Agatha's heavy silver tea tray and threw it at the window, mimicking the motions she had seen Cap make so many times. Cap's training had mostly focused on hand-to-hand, but he had shown Clint how to throw his shield once, and she had been there to see it. Clint had been ridiculously smug.
Tony leaned his weight a little more heavily against Steve, his skin hot against Steve's bare shoulder. "That numerous mutants appear to have spontaneously regained their powers, and that they'll have to ask the X-Men if they want more detailed information. Even if I actually had a clue what was going on, I wouldn't tell them. Not now that I have a choice."
"I'll talk to Carol." Steve came at Tony abruptly, aiming a flurry of blows at Tony's arms and shoulders. "We all agreed to give Wanda a second chance."
A waiter appeared by the table as if by magic, the sign of a very expensive catering service. "Can I get either of you anything?" he asked. "There is an open bar tonight."
"I will pull you from active duty if I see you using the Extremis," he said into Tony's skin, as he started unbuttoning Tony's shirt. It was a promise, not a threat. "And to hell with Chthon. You'll be a liability if you end up in such bad shape that you can't take care of yourself in the field."
"Such timidity from the great sorcerer supreme," Doom said.  "You and Dr. Blake are two of a kind, both afraid of the risks necessary for true power."
Clint snorted. "Like anyone will do anything. He's a rotting corpse who lives inside a containment unit."
The words didn't matter — it was the intent behind them that incinerated the tentacles around Sin, engulfing them in eye-searing white light and forcing them back through the crack in reality that they'd slithered through.
"No," Steve said, thrusting his hips upward and to the side to throw Tony off of him, and rolling to pin him to the ground in a knee-on-stomach hold. "I didn't. You surprised me."
The little screen in front of her had a box in the corner displaying the time and date for the plane's projected arrival in New York City. She blinked, rubbing at her eyes with one hand, and then looked at it again.
Steve could feel himself blushing. "I don't see how that matters," he said, more primly than he'd intended to. "Or that it's any of your business." He didn't actually add "young lady" to the end of that, but the temptation was strong.
"Clothing that actually fits would be a start." Pepper gestured at Tony's dress shirt, now over-sized and hanging off his shoulders. "So would a bra. We wear them for a reason, you know."
How could he have thought that Tony was less attractive as a woman than he'd been as a man? Or not curvaceous enough?
Carol was still standing in the doorway, her arms folded across her chest. Tony put a hand on her arm, nudging her forward, and the door swung closed behind them, appearing to move of its own initiative.
Sam nodded. "Longer than you know. Things were getting bad before you came back. Englehart's superhero legislation's going to set a real bad precedent if it passes, but it's a drop in the bucket compared with what was going on before."
"With your own health? No, I don't." When did this turn into a fight?
He turned the final corner sharply enough to pull almost half a negative G, and nearly ran directly into Thor's armored chest.
Tony slid over and forwards, settling his weight on top of Steve. "I really love the super soldier serum," he observed, and then set about demonstrating how much.
Steve was right – it had been an obvious move, and as fast as Steve was, Tony still ought to have been able to avoid it, or at least avoid being so thoroughly pinned. What was wrong with him today? Tony was nowhere near Steve's level in hand to hand combat, and never would be, but he usually managed to avoid being flat on his back twice in under two minutes.
"I was planning to." Steve cradled the cat against his chest, not seeming to care that it was currently wrapped around his arm, kicking and biting and making vaguely demonic sounds.
His hair was damp, strands of it sticking to his neck and face, and a sheen of sweat glistened on his skin. The sports bra and undershirt he was wearing left his arms bare, so Steve had ample opportunity to notice that while Tony might have lost some mass, he had lost nothing in terms of muscle definition.
Chthon reached for it, his presence like a vast weight in her head.
There was a thin thread of blood running out of his left nostril, and he didn't even twitch when Steve touched him, but he was alive.  He was even breathing.
It hadn't been the source of the training he'd objected to, but that fact that they hadn't had a choice, and that there had been no way to be sure of what the government planned to use them for. And recruiting children was... Steve frowned, and shrugged, uncomfortable now. "I was twenty-one when I signed on for it. I was already an adult. I've seen what happens when you put kids in costumes and send them into war zones." He wondered sometimes what Bucky would be like if he'd had a chance to have a normal childhood - he'd had that taken away from him long before the explosion.
That was mockery, wasn't it? They were all far too casual about coming back from the dead, Clint reflected. He had died, and then been brought back... somehow. He still wasn't sure exactly what Wanda had done, but since it had resulted in Clint Barton still walking around breathing air, he wasn't complaining.
"Of course we'll help," Steve said firmly, as if the Avengers had already discussed the situation and come to a unanimous conclusion.
"And you read it?" Wanda asked, staring at him in mild astonishment.
If her urgent return to the East Coast hadn't been prompted by an apparent lapse of sanity on Tony's part, she might almost have been grateful for the excuse to leave LA. The trip... hadn't gone well, though it hadn't been as bad as she had feared. She'd expected shouting and bitter fighting and that she'd leave miserable. She'd gotten the shouting in spades, but if anything she felt... slightly better for it, actually. Not better enough to want to stick around and keep doing it, but better.
She raised her eyebrows at him, arms folded across her chest, and pointed out, "The media is going to eat you alive."
Her father's voice whispered at the edge of her mind, commanding and impatient, as always.
They might not be able to repair things this time, not when they had wronged Wanda far more deeply than anyone in the superhero community had ever wronged Tony or Hank during the Registration fight – they'd been acting of their own free will. Even if the entire team and the superhero community at large were prepared to forgive her, something he'd bet money most of the world's mutant population was never going to do, she might not be able to forgive them.
Sam, who'd been halfway to his feet, doubled over, but still managed to grab Doom's ankle and yank.
"When we get there-" she began, only to be drowned out by a squeal of feedback from her communicator as the chaos magic surging around them fried something.  She turned it off and raised her voice instead, shouting to be heard over the wind and the dull whine of Tony's jet boots.  "What you promised, before.  If Chthon takes control of me-"
"If he does," she pressed.  He was clawing at the walls she'd put up to keep him out, now, hissing that she wouldn't be able to keep him out for long with so much of her power walled away.
It was silly to hover in the doorway, Steve decided.  The tiny little room had no chairs, but there was a second bed parallel to Wanda’s.  He sat down heavily on it, leaning his shield against his feet.  “Are you sure you’re okay?”
"Mine," Clint said. He held up his own glass and proclaimed, in solemn tones, "I never lost my virginity to Sharon Carter in the back seat of a flying car."
If the press had managed to catch up with him, they would have only pressured Iron Man for more news about his boss's transformation. It was the only news story involving the Avengers that the Bugle and the Times had been printing for the past ten days.
A.I.M. had been responsible for the fear toxin that had put both Tony and Jan in the hospital last month.
This time, the Masters of Evil consisted of Helmut Zemo, Mister Hyde, and the supervillain formerly known as Goliath, who had finally gotten tired of stealing Hank and Jim Foster's name and begun calling himself Atlas.
"Good," Jan told her, "because Cap and I are keeping her on active status. With things the way they are, we're going to need her. And I don't think the team can take having two more people in the field who won't talk to each other. Hank and Tony and Thor are dangerous enough already."
“You brought me back.”  And she hadn’t had the spear then.
The noble, determined pose never worked as well for him as it did for Cap. Looking unimpressed, Don said, "No, I was there for the 'we'll agree to respect one another's secret identities and not pry into our teammates' private lives' speech that apparently only I remember."
Tony shifted a little closer to him just in case.  "Give up, Doom.  Even if you get out of that box, there's an energy field surrounding the mansion and grounds that disrupts access to the Negative Zone.  Next time you try to break into my house, try not to do it using a copy of technology I worked on."
"The Dee manuscript is going to be stored in an airtight, temperature and humidity controlled glass case." Hank's smile was considerably more fixed than Jan's. "It will be kept at 50°F and 49% relative humidity, inside a secure vault. In the dark. You can examine it if you want to."
"I always figured there was something going on there," Jessica Jones said, more to herself than anything else.
Steve nodded; Doom could devote himself to a goal with a single-minded intensity that was frightening, the same vanity that had prompted him to hide his face behind a mask making him refuse to acknowledge even the possibility of failure.
Hank seemed not to hear him, another ill omen.
In biology, unexpected results meant new avenues to explore, rather than "somewhere within these millions of lines of code is an error to be found and fixed."
"That one." Dr. Brackett nodded at the room directly across the hall from Tony's.
Steve was still frowning, and Tony wasn't sure if the stiff set of his shoulders was due to Wanda's situation, or the reminder of what Marcus had done to Carol, when he'd used mind-control to seduce her into leaving the team and traveling to another dimension with him. And to make her think she'd fallen in love with him.
Steve.
“Wanda,” he managed.  He cleared his throat, and the next part came out significantly less hoarse.  “They let you up.”
"Not the charging, the heart. I look like one of Dr. Frankenstein's less successful lab experiments." Tony looked back up, away from Steve, staring blankly at the shower wall. "You'd think being literally heartless would make all of this easier." Then, very quietly. "I just want it to stop."
Hill looked at him, her eyes uncomfortably sympathetic; he preferred her cold, professional mask, he decided. He even preferred it when she snarled at him. "You didn't request pictures," she said.
"I can't give you anything for the pain until Clint comes back with Strange on the line," Hank said apologetically. Now that he'd established that Tony wasn't in immediate danger of dying, he felt generally useless. Which, if this was like most cases of spontaneous abortion, he pretty much was.
Strange spread his hands. "Even the power of the Sorcerer Supreme pales beside that of an elder god. I, too, would not be able to accomplish the task alone. I have faced Chthon before, but never at his full power."
Steve glared at Tony, feeling his face start to burn again. This entire game seemed to be designed for the sole purpose of humiliating him and making him uncomfortable. He'd told everyone something about himself that he'd kept hidden for years, trusted them with one of his longest-held secrets - one that in his original time could have gotten him kicked out of the army, arrested, thrown in jail - any Tony was acting like it was nothing, like it was something to mock.
“When I get out of here,” Doom vowed, “I’ll make what Odin did to you look mild.”
"Not as different as I thought." She shook her head, a lock of hair falling into her face. "Sometimes it feels like the past few years never even happened. I missed New York," she added. "LA's not the same. It never gets cold there, and all the buildings are too new."
He almost reached out to take Steve's hand, then remembered just in time that his left arm was a tangle of tape and plastic tubing and moving it would pull at the IV.
Tony's lips twitched, but the look in his eyes was far from amused. "Steve, you flinched. You didn't even want to look at me."
Jan made a sort of sighing noise, and sagged against him. Clint grabbed for her, catching her around the shoulders before she could hit the floor. "They breathed that stuff in, didn't they?" He looked at Steve as he spoke, his tone imploring Steve to tell him that it was under control, was going to be all right.
It wasn't unusual for Tony to do that. Steve firmly squashed the thought that Tony could easily have used the Extremis to call him at any point, without even the need for access to a phone; he'd spent weeks trying to get Tony to use the Extremis less frequently, and just because it would be more convenient for him right now if Tony used it didn't mean it couldn't hurt him.
After a moment, Tony said, quietly, "I know you're back. I know it's okay." He wrapped an arm over Steve's shoulders, his hand resting on Steve's back, as if to hold him in place. "I am getting better, I swear."
The communicator wasn't dead.  He could feel it transmitting, if he concentrated, though doing so made his temples throb warningly.  It just wasn't picking anything up, and Steve's frequency wasn't working either.  What was-
Olivia nodded. "Good," she said, firm and proud. "And then I can do to them what Anna Tasha showed me to do. Wanna see?"
Tony just tweaked a smile at him. "A lot of flowery words there, buff and blonde."
Steve folded his arms again, once more tucking his hands into his armpits. "She's not gonna wanna go."
"Tony, you don't have to—" Bruce said with a sigh, but Natasha cut him off with a good-natured, "How old-school of you."
"All right. Wish I could cram half a pound of bacon down my gullet."
"It's just milk. It's just milk. It's just milk," he told himself and closed his eyes and poured it over the bowl of paint chips. He cracked open his eyes to make sure he didn't pour too much in, and once he thought he had the balance right, he set the bottle with the remaining milk aside and dug into the muesli.
He reached out and took hold of Steve's right hand and moved his arm so it was around Tony's waist with his hand on Tony's lower back. He then took hold of Steve's left hand with his right and switched so that Steve was holding onto Tony's hand, elbows bent and hands just below shoulder-height. He put his left hand on Steve's right shoulder. There was still some breathing space between them, and Steve wished to pull Tony closer so their bodies were flush with each other, and he wanted to curl his arm tighter around Tony's waist and pull his hand against his chest and hold onto him like he would never let him go again because he was right: Having Tony in his arms was a bad, bad idea.
Tony hummed and said, "No, that's sweet, babe. That's really sweet. You know there's such a thing as sudden infant death syndrome, right?"
“I mean, here I’m trying to fuck you into submission—”
Rhodey just blinked before he said, "All right," and set Tony's phone out of his reach before he pulled his out of his pocket and said, "Call Pepper," to it.
"No," he conceded. "It's not the
, and she fucking tried to take his hand for some fucking stupid reason. He was able to wrench his arm away in time, leveling her with the most murderous glare he could muster, and she frowned, her brows drawing together in hurt as she shrunk into herself a little.
Steve had never stripped out of his uniform so fast in his life.
"Which is stupid and ridiculous and sexist," Hill muttered.
Tony had a feeling he knew what that was without needing the precise explanation. "What the hell are you reading?"
Barnes snorted a laugh. "You kidding? They won't have that shit on for days."
"And no detours," Steve told the driver, still in that stupid accent of his. "This ain't a Gray Line bus tour."
would be there at the end of it. You, with your bad habits and your loud music and your absolutely neurotic way of looking at the world. Because I could stay, and I could marry Peggy, and I could settle down with her and have a family with her, and maybe I'd be happy. I don't know. What I thought was happiness then isn't what I know happiness is now. But I wouldn't… And you wouldn't be…"
OK, not a road he wanted to travel down.
"Yeah, but it was 'cool' to do. I don't know, man. I don't pretend to understand what people did in the past."
and made a dash for the steps, but not before the elevator opened, and Pepper came storming off wearing a fitted cream-colored suit, those six-inch killer heels she was so fond of, and a face that read she was out for blood. She stopped dead in her tracks the moment she saw Tony, and Tony grimaced a little and said, "Oh, that's your angry face. I don't like your— Wait—"
"Well, I was going to say 'frame,' but I guess 'form' works, too."
Steve pushed the remnants of eggs and hash browns around his plate, his appetite suddenly deflating, and not because it was satiated from the food he'd already eaten. "Probably wondering how things might have been different if he hadn't been so stupid."
Bruce startled. "Uh, Maddie?" he asked. "Who— who's Maddie?"
he'd lost Barnes yet again. He watched as Steve moistened his lips, seemingly contemplated something, then nodded, resolute at whatever he'd decided.
"I think that witch was right. I think you two need each other. You do OK apart, but together, you can't be beat."
Maybe it did.
"That one I'll give you," Rhodey said and took a sip of his drink.
"Hmm?"
"Yeah, but it…" she said then trailed off, evidently as she tried to figure out just exactly how Tab A fit into Slot B.
"Maybe so," Steve said in that annoyingly diplomatic way, and Tony rolled his eyes and stifled a groan because Steve was in too fucking deep here to see the forest for the trees, "but he's ready— He's not running any longer. He— He's ready to come home."
He faked a gasp. "That's hurtful, big green. For the record, I am ridiculously delightful, and Steve worships the very ground I walk on."
He felt himself being pulled from his slumber, a hand brushing the hair away from his forehead, and knowing it was Natasha watching over him, he snorted a laugh, his eyes closed, and murmured, "I'm not made of glass, Nat. I won't break if you leave me by myself."
"No," she said with a considered and curt shake of the head. "But it seemed like you were happy— or you thought you were happy. But now that you're with Steve, it doesn't
"Oh," he said and felt that was sufficient. "OK, you have to promise you won't say anything. I want it to be a surprise." He shot a glare at an innocent-looking Thor. "That means you, too, Goldilocks. I want Steve to actually be surprised by this, not have to pretend that he totally didn't already know what was in the box."
"Wait, there's no natural way to… You'd have to hack me open just to rip out…"
Steve just passed her off and turned to his plate to get back to serving himself his dinner, and Tony held a suddenly fussy Olivia and went to put her on his shoulder—
but to
He did mean it. There was a certain comfort, to an extent, to going back to that body, and he had missed it and everything that went with it.
"You want me to teach you how to dance?"
Pepper shook her head some, but she smiled at him and said, "That dress looks amazing on you, by the way."
, was the only thing he could be bothered to think at that moment, and he reached out to brush his fingertips against Tony's newly transformed face when Hawkeye shouted into his ear, "
"'Old man' is your pet name for me," Steve muttered and shot a knowing and somewhat unimpressed look at him.
"My parents died literally, like, a week before Christmas," he added and shook some crystals onto a snowman. "I mean, not that— We didn't spend a whole lot of time together anyway — not even during the holidays — but...it was still... I didn't want anything to do with Christmas for a long time. Tried to play it off like I was too cool for it or something, but it wasn't..."
Bruce smiled at him then said, gently and like he was handling Tony with kid gloves, "You— You know Steve's not coming home, right, Tony? You know he's dead, don't you? I know what you think you feel, Tony, but he—" He shook his head some. "Even Steve couldn't have survived that."
Steve grinned, trying for the boyish charm that had disarmed Tony in the car. "Come on! Not even a little hint?"
Tony glanced at his watch, and he looked around the lab and said, "J, close up shop. Cap and I are going out for coffee."
He turned to her and said, "I— Nothing. Never mind. Inside joke between me and Steve."
A somewhat hysterical part of him wondered if DUM-E's claw would suffice for forceps. You know, just in case. Not that he wanted DUM-E, of all 'bots…down there…doing
"Look, who cares what something
"No? No, what? Honey, I know sex ed in the dark ages was non-existent, but trust me, that pearly-white shit you squirt out of your dick when your balls tighten up and you feel so good you can't do anything but—"
Steve just looked at him, flat and unimpressed, while the doctor smiled yet again and said, "I know you're uneasy about this, but I will need to examine you. Especially in light of your…
Steve nodded, swallowing, like he was processing what Tony was telling him and filing it away for understanding and reference. "OK," he decided. "Are we still calling you 'Tony'?"
Tony's eyes went wide for a fraction of a second before he turned to Steve and said, "Shit, how do I look? OK? Abysmal? Do I need to touch anything up? Do I have food on my face? How does my cleavage look? Do I look even? Did I spill any food on me? Are the earrings hanging the right way? What about—"
"Ah!" Barton said and put a hand up again. "Shh! Anyway, who'd I do?"
if that means they turn out to be the 'right' ones in the end."
"She usually takes a nap after lunch, so I put her down on the couch in the penthouse. She, uh, she lives here, obviously. With you and her Daddy. She likes to draw and color and paint and play with dolls and play games. Evidently computer games. She's gone on about Natasha, Clint, and even Thor. She said something about a 'Mad Eye,' which is definitely something she picked up from you. There were a whole bunch of other people she mentioned, too. A Sam and a Wanda and even a Hank Pym—"
She harrumphed a little and scowled at him. "Ah, yes, that oh-so-wonderful dry sense of humor of yours. I'd almost forgotten about it."
"Very well, Captain," he said and set another slice on the griddle.
"OK, your position in the group as grumpy old man is intact."
"Maria," Bruce supplied.
"All right, but if you do, just tell me. Anyway, so what do you mean?"
Steve shrugged, adjusting himself some against the pillows, hands still clasped behind his head. "Maybe that's the point? Maybe that's the great irony in all this? Tony Stark doesn't just take life, he creates it as well. It's not the first time you've created life, you know."
Steve just shook his head, but he dropped his arms and went over to grab the clothes. He went to hand them over, but he held back at the last second and instead pressed his face close to Tony's. Tony rolled his eyes at the puckered lips, but he still kissed his idiot of a husband anyway and received the bounty of clothes in return.
They walked the way back to the Tower, Steve with a firm hold of Tony's hand, the spring sunshine setting beyond the buildings to the west, and Tony was pretty sure he saw a couple people shoot pointed looks their way, but like earlier, no one really, honestly seemed to care. They stopped at a cross-street and waited for the traffic to clear before they continued on their way, though the most they had to contend with was some older lady smiling at Tony and saying, "When are you due?"
"Just what?"
"When you say I look younger, is that a good thing or a bad thing?"
"Well, of course you don't see it," Barnes said. "You think he acts that way with everyone."
He cried out in delight as he grasped hold of it, and Tony smiled and settled into the bed and said, "Just like a boy scout. Always prepared."
OK, that was a little… Though, if, like Natasha had said, he just wanted to count
it was to smile and how much prettier women — and thereby even girl!Tony Stark — were when they did so. He tsked a little and shook his head, the coffee carafe in hand as he went from Avenger to Avenger, pouring them each a cup of the good stuff.
"Of course," rang out an accented voice different from the witch's, and the Council caught their first glimpse of the being it was said that the witch herself brought to life from straw and some old rags. He was tall, fair-haired and with fine features. He gave a sort of smile to the Council before he produced a bottle of mead and began to fill their goblets. There were rumors in the town that his skin was of a purplish tinge, but upon close inspection, it appeared to be only mottled with dirt and use, and the Council could only figure that the stories of the witch bringing the man called 'Viz' to life had been greatly exaggerated.
He just smiled at her. He didn't know what else to do. "Yeah," he said, not wanting to rattle her small world too much. If he could hand her back to his other self without having broken her in any way, he'd chalk it up to a win for him. "Yeah, we do."
the Slut, you might say."
Jesus, they were married
"No, I mean it," he said, his annoyance with the kitchen door seemingly having passed. "You look wonderful. Seriously. I know this hasn't been... I know it's been..."
"Look, I know I promised you the specs for the projects, but I kind of fell a little behind with them," he said as he went over to the elevator and hit the button. The doors opened immediately, and Tony stepped on, barefoot, and Pepper followed. As the doors closed, he glanced down at himself, and he burst out laughing, much to Pepper's confusion.
Tony would swear some element of relief crossed his face for a fraction of a second, but he still continued to rub his hands up and down Tony's arms as he said, "So, does this mean you've come to accept it?"
But Tony just set perplexed eyes on him as though the words Steve had just spoken didn't make any sense, his face suppler and more youthful looking, his chin smooth, his lips plump and red—
Tony stared at him, the tablet heavy in his hand, and knowing Bruce, just like Steve, had more important matters to attend to and he really was OK at the moment, he said, "Yeah, fine. I'll be in my lab."
Steve patted the hand that still rested against his chest. "Yeah, JARVIS told me about that. I'm sorry. I didn't want you to— I just wanted to surprise you. When you started dropping your hints about it the other day, I was afraid I was going to give the whole thing away—"
His daughter now presentable, he finished cleaning up then picked her up and settled her against his chest before he carried her out of the room, whispering a quiet, "Shh! Papa's still sleeping. Let's let Papa sleep for a little while longer," as he carried her past his and Tony's room and over to the steps.
The water still running in the bathroom, he reached down with his right thumb and forefinger and pulled the ring from his hand. He turned it over a few times and saw there was an inscription inside of it: three numbers separated by dashes, 04-24-2014, and what looked like an etching of a robotic face of some sort. It was small and hard to really tell in the light, but it sure looked like a face of some kind.
He didn't know if it had done the trick, but at least Steve didn't seem to be holding it against him if the way he put his arms around him after that was any indication.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him. "Isn't your side all for…drowning the government in a bathtub?"
It's human. It's totally one-hundred-percent human." He looked at Bruce. "Right?"
"OK, but we're still doing the press conference tomorrow, right?"
"You're teaching her outdated forms of communication," Tony said from the floor.
"Oh, my god, Steve!" he all but cried, dropping his arms as he leaned over the table some. "I swear to god, if you don't get inside me soon, I'm going to jump on you and do it myself!"
look, Thor completely ignored Natasha's comment and said, "If there is one thing I have discovered over my many years of life it is that one can never be too careful or too cautious," his tone seeming to indicate that he found humor in Tony's ambivalence to his guardedness.
He shrugged. "I don't know. I'm just curious."
"Esmeralda," Thor said by way of greeting.
Bruce just ran a hand through his unruly hair. "I know that, Tony, but you're not a— This is completely uncharted territory here. You're not a woman. There's really no good, solid information to go on for this. You might have the most uncomplicated pregnancy in the history of the world…or you could be dead of a hemorrhage or something like that tomorrow. And is this even something you
"I might be."
"I would not take over the world just to make Pepper run it for me."
She gave a broad and understanding nod. "Well, luckily, JARVIS seemed to realize there were extenuating circumstances. He let us back in."
"Captain America keeps his nose out of it?" Steve rolled his eyes but said nothing.
He stripped off his gown and folded it neatly before he set it on the sink. He took a look down at himself — at the large, swollen belly that had dropped a bit in the past few weeks — and put his hands to the swell. He ran gentle hands over the flesh and said, "I'm not sure if I want you out now or if I want you to hold on until your father gets his star-spangled ass home."
"Tell Steve, and I'll kill you."
Steve just blinked at Tony. "Rule 63?" he murmured and Tony smiled a little at him, brown eyes soft and twinkling with what Steve knew was untold amounts of love and affection.
"Oh, my god," he muttered and looked down. "Really? Now?"
"I'm giving myself exactly as much credit as I should." He rubbed a hand over his face again. "Look," he said and went back to fiddling with the stylus in his hand, "Pep and I couldn't even make it work, and I can't make it work with Pepper…"
"I can promise you one of those things," he said and squirted a line of paste onto his brush.
He reached down and fisted both their cocks in his hand, and Steve keened high in the back of his throat, and Tony chuckled a little and murmured, "I guess it has been a long time for you, hasn't it?"
Barnes looked him over like he was actually considering this while Natasha smiled at him and said, "You look good."
Steve to put it inside of him already. He honestly couldn't ever remember begging any other partner, well,
Steve shook his head. "No, you need him here." He set a knowing look on Tony and added, "I'd feel better if he was here."
"We know the damage that scepter can wreak. Put it in the wrong hands, we could have another event like the one in New York a couple years ago. We had a home-field advantage on that one. No guarantee we would the next time."
"I think you're supposed to say 'Native American,'" Bruce murmured.
Natasha glanced back at him, smiling coyly. "Do you want to see?"
"Are you just telling me what you think I want to hear?"
"Uh…" Pepper said for lack of anything better as she looked down at the little blonde tyrant, arms raised like she was afraid to touch, and she looked up at Tony and said, "What's going on here?"
tell you, there's a lot I
Overall, it was a relatively benign affair. Maybe too many were too shocked by what had just transpired or maybe they just didn't believe it, but there was nothing that altered the fabric of reality. He had several more questions shouted at him, and he answered them all with his trademark charm and wit. He even got the assorted journos and photogs to chuckle a few more times.
He just shot what he knew was a pathetic look at her, and she frowned at the sight he quite clearly made then reached out and brushed away a few stubborn teardrops with her thumb.
"Yeah?"
He scoffed. "You don't really think the government would imprison us just to breed us, do you?"
was in the room?
"Yeah, well, the owner of that company that I run just came out on national live television and said he'd been turned into a woman and was pregnant with Captain America's child. Think answering for
"Nope," he said and shook his head. "Don't even start that shit."
Tony just looked back down at the little girl sleeping in his arms, and he rocked in the chair a couple times and watched as she opened her mouth in a gummy yawn but kept her eyes closed, and she gurgled a bit as she settled more securely into his arms. Olivia. His little Olivia.
understand. Any of them. Yeah, sure, Barton got to make fun of him and Hill and Natasha got to dress him like a goddamned doll and Steve got to fuck him in new and interesting ways, but none of them understood what this was
"They mean well," Steve murmured in reply and stroked his thumbs against Tony's cheekbones. "I guess I'll see you tomorrow?"
"Oh, come on, Nattie—"
Steve was still apprehensive, face pinched and arms folded tight against his chest. "She doesn't have any defects or anything, does she?"

to him, someone to support him and needle him and tease him and love him — oh, god, did he love him. Someone that would — and did — pick up the pieces when Tony shattered, like when Jarvis and his parents had died in that awful wreck right before Christmas. For the first time in his life, Tony was alone, and not that he was that close with his parents in the first place, but at least he had them, and at least he had a family, however perfunctory it was.
"Yeah."
He considered this a moment and shrugged. Sure, he would definitely paint himself with a gigantic target on his back, but—
"Aren't babies born with blue eyes?" Barnes asked from where he stood over by the workstation table, arms still folded as he leaned back against it.
why no one's panicking, and that's why Steve's been seen with this woman around town. Because it's not just some woman; it's Tony Stark. Honestly, the media's at fault for this whole thing."
But now...
Then again, maybe he would have a better rapport if it had been
But he was totally not depressed!
"Well," he said, safely and carefully tucking the fantasy away for another day, "who wants to live forever anyway?"
"Because you've never fallen for anyone as quickly as you did for that little girl," Rhodey replied, his concern matching Bruce's. "And your definitely-not-alternate-universe future husband just waltzed right out of here with her."
"I don't want to—" He looked down at his hands and flexed them, curling his fingers in like that could somehow absolve him of the frustration now thrumming through his body. "The serum, it... it repairs my cells — keeps them from breaking down, replaces the ones that do. Unless someone takes my head off, I'll probably...live a very long time."
Tony sat back and pulled up the article on his tablet. "Sex, babe, and lots of it. Something about some compound found in semen that helps to soften the cervix or something like that. Oh, also, nipple fondling. I know you're a big fan of that. Says you've got to go at it a while, but I'm pretty sure if there's one thing I
"Tony, give it back," Steve said, not even bothering to hide his tired sigh.
"That's what I said!"
Tony turned so that he could kiss the top of Steve's head. "Cheer up, old man. Just remember everyone kept telling me you were dead at the time, so, of the two of us, I think you got the better deal."
"No, I'm not saying that at all," he said with a curt shake of his head and opened his eyes. "What I'm
," which completely belied her point, and Tony went over to the closet and pulled out a blanket that he thought had been washed recently and draped it over the little girl snuggled into the middle of his bed, her eyes closed and her mouth slack like she'd already fallen asleep. He stood back and gazed at her a moment, and figuring there was nothing wrong with it, he leaned over and brushed his hand over her hair and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead and said, "Sleep tight, baby girl."
But he was thankful to have them there regardless, even if they only sat on the couch and watched the feeds of the battles and the blackouts from whichever affiliate had the best shot at the moment while he paced and tried to breathe and tell himself this would all be over before he knew it. He wasn't sure if he meant the labor or the Avengers' current mission. He didn't even know what state Steve and the others were even in at the moment, and part of him didn't care. He just wanted Steve to get the fuck back to the Tower as soon as possible because Jesus Christ, he was the one that had done this to him; he should be the one to see it through to the end. Or get it out of him. Or
"I told you to stay up here," she murmured to him, but there was the hint of a smile on her face.
Tony hummed a little in thought and moved his hand from Steve's abs to the hand Steve still had atop his belly. "I thought you didn't even want this one in the tower of misfit superheroes?"
Tony could hear the hesitance and confusion feeding through the connection as the Cap said, "Uh, I wasn't— I think I might have dialed the wrong number. I—"
"Not even friends with benefits?"
he was seeing it.
Tony hitched in a breath as Steve slid his finger down from his clit to his vagina and pushed in without so much as a how-do-you-do.
, but he spent more of his life as an assassin than he ever did as some schmuck from Brooklyn. And did I mention that he
In the cloudy gloom of the wet afternoon, Tony slipped his oversized sunglasses onto his face, and he led the procession into the building, ignoring the quite obvious looks of confusion and intrigue being directed at the group by others coming and going from the building. Two of them were quite clearly Avengers, and Avengers that were dressed and primped and definitely on their way to someplace official, and before they were able to strut their way to a less crowded part of the building, Tony was certain he caught a few cell phones being pointed at them. Hopefully they wouldn't recognize him as Captain America's gorgeous mystery brunette with the sunglasses on, but even if they did, well, it wasn't like he and Steve had arrived together.
" he murmured in horror.
" Barnes asked, face pinched in confusion.
He noted that they were both still standing, and he nodded for them to take the chairs in front of his desk. They shrugged and sat, and he leaned back in his chair and looked at them.
Rhodey's approval, and not that he'd ever really doubted that he'd had it — Rhodey had no problem telling him when he thought he'd gotten mixed up with someone that was just using him for his name or his money — but it did mean a lot to him to know his oldest friend  approved.
. He'd given birth. Holy shit, he'd
He had a feeling it wouldn't be the last time that he would.
," he said, and no, he totally did not sound catty at all.
Bucky just looked confused.
JARVIS was silent a moment before he said, and Tony would swear he sounded a little mournful, "
Tony grunted and muttered a quiet, "
He had just moved her to the other breast when Steve woke up, yawning and murmuring a sleepy 'good morning' to him, and Tony watched as Steve looked over to his vacated side of the bed, frowned, and said, "Why's your side all wet?"
It was soggy, and he tried not to think about why that was, and through his displeasure, he heard Tony say, "Smile, Steve. She's watching you. Don't hurt her feelings."
Figuring that was good enough, and checking his watch to make certain he wasn't running short on time, he clicked the 'play' button and waited for the video to begin.
dying," he corrected. "And I may have imbibed a little too much."
He sighed and exhaled a breath as he clicked the button to run the program. "I don't know why I'm even bothering with this."
"No," he said with a shake of the head. "I get it. I— It wasn't what I thought it was. I thought I could feel
He pulled away, maybe a little sheepish, and he met Steve's gaze then glanced to the baby on Steve's shoulder and said, "Yeah, maybe we should watch what we do around her?"
Actually, now that he thought about it, maybe he was a bit hungrier than he let himself imagine. His lunch at work had consisted of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and an apple, after all.
ther! This fellow they got for Tony sure deserved some sort of Academy Award for his performance. Steve had almost bought it several times over the course of his little speech. The only thing that had kept him from falling over the ledge was the sheer absurdity of the whole thing. Waking up in 2015.
Tony jumped back, head immediately turned in the direction of the giggling toddler, who had once again found her way into the bevy of presents before her. Steve frowned at the loss of contact but said nothing, and Tony patted him on the arm and said, "Since you won't let me install Friday here, I guess I'll have to go put the coffee on for us. I'd threaten to bring Dummy with us next time, but why torture myself just to get the 'Stare of Disapproval'? There's five thousand other less annoying ways I could do that. You go try to keep the munchkin from tearing into the gifts too much. I promised the others I'd get it on video. Barton, that asshole, in particular wants to see her open his present. If Laura wasn't able to override him, I shudder to think what he got for her."
"I didn't say—"
"Need help?" he asked because even if he didn't know who she was, he had no desire to see her get hurt.
But Tony just shook his head and patted his back. "Don't mention it, babe. Happy to do it."
"I don't know," she said, a hand at her forehead and a frown covering her face. "I don't know, I just—" She dropped her hand and focused on him, resolute. "Are you OK? How are you feeling? Can I get you anything? Were you drinking coffee? You know you're not supposed to be drinking coffee, right? Does Steve know you're drinking coffee—?"
Steve went to counter what Esmeralda had said, but Tony said, "Technically, I am her mother. I mean, I am a
Cap looked like he was trying hard not to laugh, eyes shining with something that looked like fondness and emotional release. And tears, if he was being perfectly honest. "Yes, he is," he said and kissed her cheek again, the words coming out almost as a soft sigh. "Papa's the best."
, and just admit that my way sounds better and even forms better with the mouth. It's the 'S' at the end of your name and the beginning of mine. That's what fucks it up for you. It just sounds better for it to be 'Stark-Rogers.'"
