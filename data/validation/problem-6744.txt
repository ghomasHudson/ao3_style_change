But it starts to become increasingly obvious what Tony’s doing, as he stands up from the bed and sinks down to one knee in front of Steve. Reaching out, he takes one of Steve’s hands in both of his own, and presses a gentle kiss to his knuckles.
Unable to bite back his grin, Tony held them at an arm’s length, looking the boys up and down to make sure that they weren’t hurt, then let his gaze wander over to Bruce. He had a small cut on his forehead, curly hair slicked back with sweat, but other than that, they all seemed to be in good shape — albeit slightly slack-jawed at whatever was behind Tony.
“It worked like a charm back in the day,” Steve defended. “And this is my first mission with SHIELD. They only found me a couple months ago. Haven’t been doing much since then. Catching up on reading, mostly.”
Maybe he’d just seen too many sci-fi movies over the years not to be wary of messing around with genetics.
Thank God Osborn had stopped the car just then, because Tony would’ve jumped out of it either way, running up to the huge, towering dinosaur. He was a man of science, after all, a man of technology, of
Steve rushes out before he can give himself away, turning around just as the doors start to close, to offer a smile. “I’ll see you tonight, sweetheart.”
“No, really,” he said, tracing an X just over his heart — or, well, just over where his heart used to be, nearer the left side of his chest. “I can’t even tell you how many times I dressed up as Cap for Halloween. I had a little plastic shield and everything.”
Still, even with all this new knowledge, all these tricks he could use, being under the spell of a truth serum wasn’t exactly a delight, and the sooner he could be rid of it, the better — the safer. Not just for Tony, but for everyone involved.
No, Tony wanted to say. I carried that damn phone with me for two years and every moment I wanted to smash it. He killed my
that I can’t make fit. Because I hate being left behind. I hate what it takes to love someone who would leave me behind.”
Hope smashed through the numbness, bringing an agonizing return of feeling. Tony buried his face into the other man’s neck, too terrified to open his eyes in case this was a dream, in case he made a mistake and had to wake up.
Yet early in the afternoon, Tony was annoyed to notice that a) he had a body, and b) it was hungry. This was all Steve’s doing, bringing him lunch every day like some kind of Pavlovian zoo keeper. Yet when he checked, the super-soldier hadn’t budged from the same spot on the couch he’d occupied all morning. From the projected images around him it looked like he was reading the current reports from the Wakandan crisis team that Shuri had assembled while the rest of them focused on Titan. Tony watched him for a minute, not liking the way Steve’s shoulders were hunched over, the frown pinching his features. Typical stubborn idiot of a man, giving them all a day off to get their minds right but filling his own head with tragedies beyond his reach.
I don’t make it. I’m sorry if it’s selfish, but I just… I wanted you to know. That’s how I feel.” He ducked back under the oxygen mask, gasping.
“I have spent my life in the pursuit of horrors only because I thought it necessary,” the Mad Titan said heavily. “I truly believed there was no other way. Yet your visions have brought me to doubt this conclusion. Thus I find my resolve shattered.” Thanos shook his head, still studying the ground. “I thought it was strength that granted me the will for victory. But I must wonder instead if this is a weakness, the way my mind seeks even now to defend my former arguments, to applaud intent above consequence. Despite knowing the pointless ruin my actions have wrought, this weakness places an easy peace within my reach. Even now, I believe I could bear the cost of this failure, could forgive myself and live a life without regret for any of my past choices.” He paused, sighed. “All save for one.”
and watch from afar. If Nebula succeeded in using the Space Stone, they’d come back and guard the other Stones until she returned. If she failed, they’d come back and bury what was left of her and wait for Thor’s friend to make a new Gauntlet, then hope Thor had better luck.
The serum-driven hunger was pretty much constant, but even by his standards, Steve realized, his body was ravenous. “I probably should.”
?” Steve breathed, lowering his shield almost to the ground. Somehow Tony shook off his own surprise and stepped forward, nanobots ready to launch a defense.
Schmidt floated closer, a peculiar intensity in his eyes. “How fitting that of all living souls, it comes to you and I, here at the end,” he murmured. The Captain registered the possible threat, Nebula also on guard. Steve couldn’t care. “I have spent so many years searching for ways to complete my service and be free, to no avail. But thanks to you, Captain Rogers, I see my path to redemption.”
That day had held so many terrible moments, but one of the worst was realizing that their own reckless resistance had just inspired the younger Mad Titan to even greater villainy, the Avengers once more creating a threat they had barely managed to contain.
The sharp intake of breath by his ear shocked Steve’s brain into something like alertness, knocked him right out of the drift and back into his body; every part of him scrambling to take it back. Danger. Wrong. “Wait, no, no, don’t answer that,” Steve said desperately, trying to dispel the sudden tension he felt in Tony’s arms and body. “That’s not… It’s not a fair question, I shouldn’t have… You’re alive, you’ve always been so alive and I’m- it’s not- no, stop, don’t worry about it.”
And then, with a sting of remorse, Steve realized why. Thanks to the terms of his parole, Steve still wasn’t allowed to leave the Compound without clearance. It was no coincidence that for the past couple of years, Stark had rarely bothered to show his face there, despite living in Stone’s ridiculous mansion a mere hour away. But Bucky was still in Wakanda and had offered his help in the upcoming battle. If he’d stuck with that team, Stark would have had to work alongside the man who murdered his parents, all while fighting the end of the world.
Of course. Last time Tony had been fighting, the adrenaline taking the edge off his injuries. But now the agony is hitting him fresh, his mind unprepared, and Steve feels his breath hitch when he looks up to meet the eyes of the tall man - Strange? actual doctor, Tony had said - and recognizes the open worry there. Danger, the Captain says, and Steve can only agree.
They were over-prepared, he thought in sudden shock. Over-drawn with the knowledge of the impossible stakes in play, the unspeakable price of failure. Steve’s usual trick of an inspiring speech could only serve to wind them up further.
With the car’s privacy in sight, Tiberius sped up, his longer stride forcing Tony to uncomfortable effort, his grip on Tony’s arm becoming too punishing to ignore.
“Take your time, junior,” Tony said, enjoying the eye-rolling among the more seasoned reporters in the crowd.
The Soul Stone placed her hands on her hips and surveyed Steve and Tony, still sitting tangled on the ground. “Any other housekeeping requests, before I go?”
As requested, Steve helped Tony smash every screen in his former bedroom, until there were no shards left big enough to see his reflection. Then the other man stood guard by the door as Tony turned his attentions to the bed. By the time he was done, the adrenaline had long since faded, leaving Tony shaking with exhaustion.
Tony sagged against the door, feeling hollow, echoing with horror at all the failures he had wrought.
Instead of explaining, Dr Palmer tossed him the phone and waved him out of the room so she could finish her work on Steve’s array of machines. Tony lingered near the doorway, and Steve watched him listen to whoever was on the phone as two masked nurses started swapping his bed’s standard fabric curtains for four large plastic sheets.
Final plan confirmed, the Asgardians made their farewells for the night, and the Wakanda team drifted together for a quick discussion of duties.
“You shouldn’t be here,” Steve mumbled, the stars showing him the truth, how some wishes were never meant to be granted, how some endings could never be happy… The other man said nothing, but for a moment his eyes were so sad that Steve wanted to- he needed to-
“…yeah? Maybe.” And Tony stored away his regrets for what might have been, alongside all the others. “Anyway. Once we got to Titan, we met up with some other folks looking for Thanos. Rocket’s people. Decent fighters, but not… Luckily we had some time to kill. That’s when the wizard used the Time Stone to sneak a peek at the future. Steve, he said we could win. That there was a way. But only one.”
understand?” Tony bit out, as if irritated by his confusion. “What should I tell you? What makes you think I need
Taking comfort in childhood rhythms, Steve smacked the other man lightly on the ribs. “Sympathy is free, you know.”
Tony squeezed his fingers and Steve looked down, surprised to find their hands were still united. “Don’t let the Great Grape Ape get in your head, Cap. We got this.”
. Tony tried his best to eat but it turned out getting dumped was even worse for the appetite than getting impaled. Not to mention the one reliable constant in the universe: hospital food sucked, even in Wakanda. To distract him from the bland meal, Pepper started asking him about the other future, and so he told her everything; even the Steve parts, at her request.
Slowly, Tony stopped listening, unable to keep up with Steve and the team’s responsible words; instead, he let himself fade, his mind drifting through wistful memories like a child wandering through empty rooms, leading his exhausted body onward into sad, scattered dreams.
Tony had heard. Tony had promised. And Tony was still here. It was more than Steve could have dreamed, and the relief kept the words flooding out, a stuttering torrent that skipped haphazardly between sentences, nonsense swirls of half thoughts and memory fragments snagging on each other, as if fighting for release. Tony listened anyway, quiet as he steered Steve to the bed, settled him in to rest, held him close like some rare, fragile thing; somehow his attention helped the sharp pieces slide free, his presence smoothing them out, one by one. The surface part of Steve drifted through it all, wrapped warm and content in Tony’s arms, listening in fascination to his own voice babbling, on and on, until the torrent eventually slowed to a trickle, then eased, leaving only the occasional drip of sleepy whispers in the silence.
Sometime in the early morning, Steve opened his eyes to find himself fully awake. The monstrous pain from his dreams had been reduced to a crushing ache simmering below the surface, the rest of him floating free somewhere far above. He heard himself groan.
The look Steve gave him in response was almost helpless, and Tony realized with a vicious thrill that despite the slow pace he’d set, the other man was barely hanging onto his self-control. “Tony. I don’t want to hurt you.”
Across the street the huge alien stood quietly, eyes fixed on Tony’s approach. Overriding Friday’s chatter about power readings and proximity curves, Tony chose to make a dramatic landing halfway between the alien and the Sanctum’s door. He straightened slowly, praying his trembling wouldn’t show through the armor, and found a smirk had appeared on the alien’s massive face.
T’Challa had been watching them both, and now spoke. “You are welcome to visit Wakanda at any time, Captain Rogers. And of course, your friend may keep you notified of his progress. But for now, I believe he is correct, and your presence is required elsewhere.” There was sympathy in the prince’s eyes, but a faint trace of disapproval too.
The other man was avoiding his gaze. “I… What if I don’t know, Tony?” he asked, defeat and shame and something worse in his voice.
At first, pure relief kept Tony stuck in place, speechless. But the carefully hidden hurt in Steve’s voice cracked his heart wide open, and then - despite his mind listing a thousand reasons why this was a
Given the last time Tony had seen the man he’d tried to kill him, it was a bold move. Decent, really. And Tony didn’t have it in him to refuse. “Thanks,” he said, and stepped into the small room. It too looked basically unchanged, except now, someone else’s stuff was scattered around, stuff he hadn’t seen before. Boots here. A metal arm there. Last time, Steve must have cleaned up before Tony got back from Titan. Funny. He’d never mentioned it was Bucky’s room originally. Made a certain sense. Close as he could get.
The real Steve could make any room look small. He made gravity itself seem optional. The real Steve would never allow himself to be so… diminished…
But May was squeezing his shoulder, a steady strength in her voice. “It’s okay, Tony,” she announced, glaring at the doctors. “He can do that, it’s okay. Right?”
Out of reflex, Tony flinched back; Steve slowly turned his head, narrowing his eyes on the tycoon’s face. “Be careful what you wish for, Stone,” Steve said, ice in his voice. “You may find my full attention uncomfortable.”
“We go back,” Tony said, a dangerous light in his eyes daring Steve to disagree. To deny him. “And you sign.”
It’s the cruelty of the god’s lie that takes his breath away all over again, that burns worse than the shame of his failure.
. But there’s no guarantee it would work out so well with anyone else. Howard told me once that Erskine’s greatest accomplishment wasn’t his mysterious formula. It was that he chose the best person possible for the job. And after meeting you, I agreed.”
As if Steve needed an explanation. People can talk. None of his business. He sat anyway. He could be calm.
There was an exasperated familiarity in her voice that Tony envied. Peter was lucky to have someone who knew him that well. Who would love him anyway. He glanced down to his hand, noting the neatly placed needle, then squinted up at the I.V. stand beside his bed. The label font was too small to read unaided; he tapped his chest but Friday must have started the nanites recharging while he was out. “What’s in the bag?” Tony asked, trying not to sound suspicious.
And so, when he could stand, he returned to his post. Tony knew there was no place for him by Steve’s side, but leaving the injured man alone was unthinkable. When the morning came, when the others returned… Then, he’d go. And he’d make sure Steve would never have to look at him again.
. Where once he had seen only Steve’s arrogance, Tony now found traces of desperation. Underneath Steve’s scorn, he could see hints of anxiety, even insecurity. With growing self-loathing, Tony traced the strange new echoes down through the years, discovering how Steve’s perpetual confidence had so often rung hollow with vulnerability, and doubt, and fear.
The Soul Stone looked from one to the other. “Is that… all you want?” No, thought Steve. Home, and peace. But that was never the mission, and so he nodded.
Steve sighed again. “You would have been kind, Tony, I know. But I’ve seen how many people get pulled into your orbit, how often they end up wanting more than you can give. The burden of that… I see how it weighs on you. And I didn’t want to be someone you had to push away. So keeping my distance felt like I was keeping you close, in a weird way. As close as I could get, anyway. I don’t know. Does that make any sense?”
Bruce didn’t take his eyes off Clint. “Maybe if the adults had done better at talking, he wouldn’t have needed a side.”
“I just…” And just like that, Steve was hit with an errant flash of recent memory of Tony pressed against the glass, all dark eyes and promises. “I don’t…” Steve had been asking for…
“Can you two step back and let me get on with this?” Nebula complained. Oh right. Potential instant death looming, if the Gauntlet failed. Tony had nearly forgotten that part, and he considered summoning his suit, but this close, it wouldn’t make much difference. He did briefly regret that Steve was not on the
Yet a dark worry fell across Tony as he stepped into the small room. Usually Steve’s bulk dominated confined areas without even trying; now his body was a small huddled heap on the floor. He sat by the bed, staring blankly at the wall. He’d grown a beard, a while ago by the looks of it. There was a hint of red around his eyes. Otherwise he looked fine. Maybe kinda bored, like he was waiting for something.
Once they had the more comfortable Gauntlet formation, they experimented a little more; working together, they figured out how to use the Space Stone to search through the blast wreckage and extract the remaining Stones; Time and Mind. They opted to leave the Time Stone until last, and so they tried the Mind Stone first.
Tony took a breath, because what he was about to ask wasn’t fair, was in fact unspeakably cruel, but he couldn’t solve what he couldn’t see; then he reached out and took Steve’s hand, weaving their fingers together, apology and vow. “Promise me that you won’t go alone.” Steve flinched, but Tony kept going. “Promise me that you won’t leave me behind.” The other man was shaking his head now in horrified refusal, but Tony had to keep going, had to ask, had to try. “Promise me that whatever happens, we face it together.” Steve’s grip had clenched tighter with every word he spoke, was now agonizing; Tony held on regardless.
“Yes, of course, always,” Tony whispered. Then he braced Steve’s head between his hands, forcing Steve to watch him, hear him. “I swear to you, Steven Grant Rogers, I am going to help you. Whatever it takes.” Tony looked all scrunched up, as if he was trying not to cry. “It’s going to be okay, Steve, I promise. You’re going to be okay.”
More often, there’d been bad days. Sometimes she couldn’t remember a Steve Rogers at all, blinking at him with kind indifference. He would cut those visits short, unable to bear the necessary pretense, and walk the long miles home, his mind ringing with silence. Those had been the worst days of all. He wondered how those days had felt for Peggy.
Strange would have to meditate deeply upon the process first, but he promised that upon his return, he would know the best way to help save Steve’s life.
“Private island,” Tony said. He gestured vaguely at the freezer. “Food, if you’re hungry,” he stated. “TV works, if you’re bored.” He could have been reciting the dictionary, for all the life in his voice.
,” Vision says; a blaze of blue and orange light flares behind him, so bright they all must shield their eyes from the dazzle, but when Steve looks again, he sees a portal, and he runs.
“Friday, can you run that last update against the Norway projections, please?” Foster’s team were tasked with catching his errors and, yeah, it was a massive relief to know they were supervising, but last month’s space plumbing snafu had just been embarrassing. In hindsight, Tony supposed a toilet so powerful it also flushed its user ass-first into vacuum may count as “excessive force”. Darcy was still sending him Alien Resurrection gifs.
“Maybe not,” Tony and Bruce said in unison. Bruce caught his eye, grinning. God, how Tony had missed him. He gestured for Bruce to go ahead.
“He wasn’t that bad, at first,” he whispered. “I didn’t really… It all felt so…” He broke off, shaking his head. “It was too hard to explain. Then he started getting worse, but it was too hard to talk about. He slipped up a few times, but people just see what they want to see.”
Steve sank back, at a loss for how to respond, because absolutely none of what Tony had just said was true.
And so Tony said nothing, did nothing, tried his best to feel nothing. Instead he sat still in endless sinking exhaustion, trying to keep his breath steady, trying to pay attention as the others argued back and forth about strategies and deployments.
The mission is supposed to be simple, so of course, it quickly turns into a shitshow. The villain du jour has invented a device that Jarvis identifies as a terror beam. The neurological effects are bad enough to drop Nat where she stands, but downright catastrophic when Bruce gets hit next. The rest of the team are diverted to stopping the Hulk’s rampage while Tony and Steve close out the mission.
- came through; the secondary team then departed for Norway, carrying a modified tracker that stated Steve Rogers was on board. Tony watched the Quinjet take off, then turned to Steve.
Dizzy with unexpected relief, Tony opened his eyes to find Steve poised in full combat readiness. “Location, Friday?” the other man demanded, sudden ice in his voice-
“Yeah, about that; no, not once we go back and undo everything,” Tony spoke up beside him. Thanos stared from one of them to the next, a dark understanding dawning on his face. “What, you think you’re the only one with a magic glove? Except ours is in much better shape, and now, thanks to you, we have the Infinity Stones.”
A sleepy-eyed Bruce appeared at the door to the lab. “Hey, I think there’s a meeting? You guys coming?”
They got out of the car, Steve carefully securing his shield on his back, Tony’s nerves shrieking with awareness at every step. Ty would see…
Six weeks since the reunited Avengers had announced to the world that there was a way to bring everyone back, broadcast on every radio and TV left on the planet.
The journey upstate took nearly an hour, which they spent in silence. Tony focused on the road, the car, the passing details of the countryside. Only once did Steve speak, looking up from his phone.
“You’re in a temporary pocket of unreality that stands outside of space and time,” she said smoothly. “I am the Soul Stone. None of us are alive as you understand it, but we all possess an awareness of our existence, within our spheres of specific interest. I myself am patterned after all that is alive which in turn patterns all that lives; this invites me to develop certain characteristics that resemble what you call consciousness. You might say that I am awake while the others merely dream. As for the rest of your questions, well,” and here she grinned. “That would be telling.”
Yet it was all a fucking joke. They were too late. The threat was too vast, and Earth wasn’t ready. Thanos was coming; somehow those few words held more weight than the thousands Tony had spoken over the years, were more effective than any of his arguments. His pleas to prepare. Because he’d
When Wilson and Carol had left, Scott sat down beside Tony despite the many empty chairs. The former thief’s usual ebullience was nowhere to be seen as he slumped forward to stare at the floor. They sat and waited in silence. An endless minute passed, then another, until across the room, there was a outburst of frantic activity. Tony shot to his feet, Scott grabbing his arm to steady him. The blonde doctor was barking orders at her team as they rushed Steve away, out of sight. Strange followed for a short distance, then returned, approaching him and Scott.
The food was anonymous mush in his mouth, but Steve kept chewing. Tony would be waking soon, and Steve had to plan, had to think through what he wanted to say, but every time he tried his mind looped away again. Chewing. No taste. More damage, from the Stones? Or just the shock, like Sam kept saying. Reassuring. Good. But wrong. There was something wrong, Steve thought.
The coiling irritation in his belly curled tighter with every passing minute. Steve tried to focus on the day’s necessities, but he could hear the early morning chatter of the team slide slowly into discontent.
“Ah, sweet Anthony, I’ve missed you,” Ty said, laughing, his voice dropping low. “Come upstairs, I’ll be waiting.”
The work meant he and Steve were now both falling into bed exhausted, rarely at the same time, and waking just in time for breakfast. It was selfish but in all the bustle Tony missed their previous morning routine, craved the quiet early moments of feigned sleep where he could watch Steve with his flowers, fingers hovering over impossibly delicate sketches. As the big day approached, a growing part of Tony despaired at the idea that those moments were over for good.
And it seemed Ty had been recording every second of their sessions. One screen showed Tony kissing Ty on the cheek, over and over. On another, he was rehearsing lines, frowning in concentration. But none of the videos showed Ty giving him orders, he noticed. If the other man appeared at all, it was only as a passive recipient to Tony’s compulsive efforts. As if
“Not there yet,” Tony answered. “We gotta walk a bit from here. Protected grounds, Shuri said. There’s a rare species of cricket.”
Clinging to the thought, huddling into its meager comfort, he let himself sink again. The absence of hope was an agony so overwhelming that it negated his suffering, leading him into an almost pleasant numbness. He wondered if this was the same peace that would let a soldier die with a smile. The end he’d denied to Steve.
In one quick motion, Steve ripped Tony’s shirt right off his body and Tony threw his heart in a box for later because oh my
Their destination was a wide flat area flanked with two huge pillars with mysterious alien symbols carved into the stone. Nothing moved save the wind blowing a few forlorn specks of snow, and it was the loneliest, saddest place Tony had ever seen. Red Skull led them past the massive pillars, Steve and Nebula silently watching their guide with somewhat murderous expressions. Tony stepped almost to the edge where the mountain dropped steeply away and took a quick glance over. He was usually fine with heights, conveniently, but his stomach lurched at the sight of the stone platform far below. Shaken, he gladly retreated to Steve’s side; the super-soldier was still ominously quiet. Enough stalling.
Given the increasingly strained faces of the lab team, Steve had anticipated delays, but the timeline was still a blow. Not Tony’s fault, though. “We’ll take it slow if we have to. For now let’s work through the variables. Figure out if a strike on Titan is even feasible.”
, and maybe Thanos was right, maybe life wasn’t worth saving, better to let the end come so all of this could be
“Get the fuck off me, Ty,” Tony snarled, breaking his arm out of his fiancé’s grip and stopping dead.
“That, but also…” Steve took a shaky breath. “Sometimes if there’s a chance of getting what you want, it’s harder than living without it. I think, after so long… Running was just easier.”
More voices gathered, said gentle things, maybe cried. Peter gave way to Bruce. He heard Nat sobbing on the floor, her arm curled around his feet. Provoked to worry by her grief, Tony tried to look around, to see who was missing. But everyone he could think of was there. Everyone, except…
And yet… Tony hadn’t mentioned her. Hadn’t really talked about what they were doing at all. He’d just followed Steve back to his room that first night and crawled into his bed like it was routine behavior. And after a few nights, it was. At the time, Steve was slow to question it, content to savor every second he got to spend with Tony after such a long and bitter separation. But as days turned to weeks, he felt more and more as if there was something hanging over him, something vast and hidden and unspoken between them, and it loomed larger every day.
“What?” Steve’s mind was spinning off in tangents again, his focus becoming slippery, erratic. For a moment, it wasn’t Tony, there across the table. Just a stranger wearing his face.
FRIDAY speaks. Approach, space. Alert. The Queen stands firm, demands. Response. The Captain listens. The ship is damaged, injuries, problems. The Captain hears. The team hears. The Queen hears. Bad joke. Inappropriate. The Captain sighs. The team cheers. The Captain leaves the room. The team leaves the room. The team goes to the ship. The Captain goes to the room, to the place he stares at the ceiling.
Wanda gave the billionaire a slow smile, her eyes gleaming with loathing. “Good.” Steve stifled a sigh. Another team issue he might have to address. Luckily, Stark just ignored her.
“Actually, I believe it may be possible,” Vision spoke up; briefly, he met Tony’s gaze, both understanding and acceptance in his preternaturally calm eyes. Tony felt a mixed wave of remorse and pride as the android tapped the Mind Stone in his forehead. “I have been studying this artifact ever since I became aware of my own existence. Despite my efforts, I am still not sure how it works. Yet I believe that the gem’s matrix could be destabilized by a sufficient power…” He hesitated and turned to Wanda beside him. “…that is of a similar kind to its own.”
Yet here, gathered in the familiar neutral space of the mess hall, no one on the team felt much like celebrating. The mission to Vormir had shaken them all deeply; finding out Strange had kept Tony alive only so he could die later had improved no one’s faith in their plan. On top of that, Steve’s chances of successfully wielding the Infinity Stones were much slimmer than Thor’s or Nebula’s; despite the cool confidence the super-soldier was projecting, there was no guarantee that his eventual attempt would result in anything but failure. Since their return to Earth yesterday, Tony had convinced the team that they should install only one Infinity Stone at a time on the Gauntlet while gathering all the data they could; the slower process would give Steve the best possible chance of success.
Tony threw him a disgusted look. “Man with a fucking plan. God, Rogers, take a fucking seat. There’s no way Ross is gonna be seen locking up
With Tony at his side, the modern world felt welcoming in a way he’d never expected. Really, Steve had grown to rely on him so much, losing his guidance would-
“Yes,” the Soul Stone said simply. “And we choose against you, Thanos, son of A’lars. You may no longer command us.” A thrill of hope sang through Steve; he looked down at his and Tony’s entwined hands to find the gold gleam of their shared Gauntlet had been restored, but the inset gems looked oddly dull. Unresponsive. Danger, insisted the Captain, wrenching his attention back to Thanos. Stand. Fight.
“FRIDAY, location,” he heard Rhodey say over the roaring in his ears. He should have thought of that, but he couldn’t think, couldn’t breathe.
. He’d tried for a casual tone but his voice had shook so he just sounded weak and scared instead. Tony sat up, again checking for witnesses, but it was still just the two of them in the small room.
?” Steve bit back, muscling right into Stark’s space, looming over him despite the suit’s added bulk. “I’ll tell you why, because he has the
Steve’s body was seized in another round of punishing chills, his teeth chattering. “B-but I c-can’t,” he mumbled. “Can’t w-wake up until it’s m-morning.”
Every second until then, Tony would watch over him, because that would keep Steve safe. The plan echoed round and round in his aching head, bringing him comfort, bringing him pain.
Then Tiberius was pulling away, and Tony was getting pushed roughly into the car, scrambling all the way over to the passenger’s side. As his fiancé started the engine with one hand and fumbled at his zipper with the other, Tony had just enough time to take one last victorious look out through the windscreen. Enough time to see, so that by the time Tiberius hit the accelerator and shoved his head down, Tony had already accepted the truth. The window was empty.
“Yeah, I heard you fought Thanos. So how’d our bots hold up in battle?” Shuri asked, still scanning the data.
, his whole body and mind ringing loud with new, limitless possibility. Taken with amazement, he didn’t realize his own lack of response until Tony drew back, hovering as if uncertain.
Tony was grinning for some reason; he looked up at the Soul Stone and shrugged. “Maybe just hide yourselves a bit better this time? Y’know, strike all this ‘achieve infinite power’ nonsense off everyone’s bucket list between now and ever.”
Yet Tony didn’t move to attack. Instead he bowed his head and began to make a strange choking noise, almost lost amid the soft whine of the suit’s repulsors. Steve stepped after him, instincts screaming, but stopped as Tony recoiled. As the other man continued backing away, the stifled sound strengthened and resolved into something recognizable and hideous and gasping.
Tony had helped with that, more than most. Maybe more than Steve would ever know. Trying to keep up with his teasing had at first sent Steve into interesting places that often led to useful insight. Steve had assumed this was by coincidence until he’d noticed how closely Tony would watch for Steve’s reaction, his words carefully shaped to provoke but not harm. In the following months of observation, Steve had begun to appreciate the subtleties of the other man’s attention. Tony approached their friendship like he did all of his designs, all off-handed dazzle on the surface but with a steady brilliance underneath. And he never looked at Steve with awe unless Steve actually did something to deserve it.
Deep within his chest, the tiniest glimmer of anger stirred. Tony glared up at the central screen, stepping away from Steve.
“I really didn’t think we’d ever get here,” Steve murmured, his brow furrowed even as his fingers traced the shape of Tony’s eyes, his lips. “Even after Thanos, being your friend again… It felt like more than I deserved. I knew the real you would still hate me, so I figured it was hopeless.”
Of course, then Thor kept talking. “Indeed, Stark, my quest has taken me far since last we parted, but I return with grave tidings of an unspeakable peril, an enemy who seeks to tear apart the very fabric of existence itself, and from whom I fear the Earth is in great imminent danger.”
Tony pasted a smile on his face. “Just some work knots in need of detangling, nothing that can’t wait.” He bounced past her to join the others, hoping in their company she’d let it go. And thankfully, she did.
“At least we know if I go in first and don’t die, we’ll have a shot,” Tony murmured, then gasped. “Uh, kinda need to breathe here, soldier.”
That shook Tony enough that he retreated a step and looked wide-eyed at Steve, who stepped forward. “You wiped out half of all life in the universe,” the super-soldier said, keeping his voice slow and even. “Tell me why.”
. Every day had ended the same, with Steve bored and unsatisfied, trudging back to the empty apartment his mother had worked so hard to keep. A small angry part of him still wishing it would burn to the ground. Becoming Captain America hadn’t been just a job or a privilege. It had been a fairytale.
“My sister is already on the plane. You are welcome to accompany us,” T’Challa said, Okoje quietly falling in beside them.
you talk to me so rudely, showing me no fucking respect, I am your fiancé and you will not speak to me like that-”
Just as they stepped apart, Natasha emerged from the nearby hut and waved them over. “Cap, Tony, you need to see this.”
; Tony gave a soft whimper, yielded, and Steve felt stars dazzle behind his eyes, soaring throughout his soul.
, Steve reached out and pulled the other man onto his lap, shoving the heavy table carelessly away to make space. Tony gave a tiny yelp of surprise but instantly relaxed into Steve’s arms, seeking his mouth again. This time, though, Steve was ready, and-
“It appears your affection for Stark has grown much deeper since my departure, Steve Rogers,” Thor observed. “The heat of shared adversity may well forge great passion from friendship’s ore, yet I am told you and Stark were most grievously estranged these past two years. In truth, I am having difficulty reconciling these observations.”
They pulled up before the front door, Tony squinting up at the blank, empty windows. Ty’s preference was to bus in his domestic staff obscenely early every morning just so they’d be gone before he woke in the afternoon; the tycoon resented all signs of life in his home that he did not expressly permit. Lunchtime was usually the busiest hour, but from the eerie silence, it looked like Ty had given everyone the day off. No witnesses, Tony thought. It made their mission simpler.
Tony shook his head. “If there’s a body.” In his head, red planet, red suit. “No one should face that alone.” He didn’t know the words, couldn’t think through how to say it, to make Steve understand. Bad breeze. Empty echoes.
“I’m warning you, Rogers,” the other man said, a glimmer of threat back in his eyes. “Leave me the fuck alone.”
Steve hesitated. “Before I took the serum… Erskine said it would only enhance what was already there. Red Skull was monstrous, and became a monster. Bucky said I just grew an outside thick enough to match my idiot insides. But Bruce… I never asked. Where the rage comes from.”
. Therefore it didn’t mean anything. Maybe if he had been single he would have paid more attention, wouldn’t have just shrugged and let it go, but he had been blessed with Pepper long before he met Steve. She was his whole life. And somehow, failing to save her and half of all life in the universe had kinda killed off his libido, so. The whole Steve thing had not been a problem thus far.
He followed the corridor to the kitchen, where there was no sign of any activity. Unusual, since it was approaching dinner time, but he could hear faint sounds of life further ahead. His stomach was keenly aware he’d skipped proper lunch - energy bars did not count as nutrition, he’d been thoroughly informed - so Tony scooped up an apple before he left. The sounds were coming from the sunny side of the house, in which case he knew exactly where they’d be.
Steve’s eyes flicked to the screens behind Tony, where his double was most definitely not stopping; as his gaze slowly slid back towards him, Tony watched the horror unfold on Steve’s face.
Steve stopped abruptly, surprising the former medic. “There’s something wrong with me,” he told him; fast, before the words could melt away again. Broken, wrong, nothing, gone…
He knew he had a choice to make, but for some ridiculous reason he couldn’t quite grasp what his options were. His thoughts kept colliding, spinning off onto useless half-baked tangents. A random memory surfaced. His mother laughing, the year she’d brought him to the sea. He’d been so sick, but they’d both been so happy, that last summer before the reckoning. Before the coughing, and the distance, and the lies….
“Tony, wait, please, let me-” he called, scrambling to his feet to follow, but he stopped when Bucky’s hand landed on his shoulder.
Enough. “On your feet, soldier,” Tony commanded. He stood in front of Steve, blocking his view of the horrific reports, and held out his hand.
“I don’t know, Steve,” the other man said softly. His eyes were uncertain behind the glass. Haunted. “Sounded pretty accurate to me.”
God, Steve had so much to apologize for. Despite his resolve to be patient, Steve had the sudden impulse to stampede into the other room and demand to know what Tony was thinking. He could only imagine what the other man must be feeling. The video of his parents would have been devastating to witness, both as a son and as evidence of Steve’s betrayal. Despite their friendship, Steve had expected the worst of Tony, had kept quiet for fear of Tony’s vengeance if he ever discovered the truth. Yet even under the worst possible circumstances, Tony hadn’t lashed out. He had recoiled instead, escape his first anguished instinct. Too late, Steve had seen the danger in his inaction, had understood the awful cost of his silence.
Ty screamed in fury, looming closer to the camera as if he could burst through the screen. “This is my
Something in his voice sent warning thrills through Steve’s whole body. “You’re the furthest thing from a coward, Tony, why would you-”
The others were far less open to the idea, Barton scoffing audibly. “Tony, these are manifestations of cosmic forces,” Bruce said carefully. “Who even knows if they
“Yeah,” Steve said. Then the man said nothing more, instead just licked his lips and waited, eyes smoldering. Beautiful. Wretched.
Tony wasn’t sure he knew how to speak of Titan. It all felt too impossibly cataclysmic to fit into normal words. But he nodded, and the super-soldier opposite him snuggled deeper into his pillow, and somehow, in this sideways version of the world, it was safe to think back.
“Mortals,” the Soul Stone sighed. “At least the rest of you appreciated the trip.” She smiled down at Gamora who beamed giddily back at her; Thanos looked away, still silent.
Steve had no physical trouble carrying the smaller man, but he admitted it may have been a tactical mistake when Tony’s tongue made him stumble twice before even reaching the stairs. Halfway up, Steve had to drop him thanks to a particularly effective use of teeth. By the time they reached the bedroom, Steve had lost his shirt and both socks, while Tony had been stripped down to only an undershirt and, to Steve’s glee, neon purple Hulk boxers.
Tony shot him an amused glance, a cover as they both shifted towards defensive stances. “Damn wizards, never sharing the shortcuts.”
“I’m so sorry,” Tony said, and he meant it. The young Queen’s mind was the most brilliant he’d ever known, but he knew all too well how bitter failure could taste for someone so used to success. No wonder Steve was upset. He’d seemed genuinely invested in helping her.
Yet Tony had gathered him into his lap and was rocking him back and forth, still there despite the words. Not gone.
Dr Palmer leaned over him. “The transfer can be stressful so I’m going to give you something to help you stay calm. Is that okay, Captain Rogers?” Nice. She was nice, to ask first. He gave a quick nod, and a few seconds later, he felt his fear dissipate.
creeped him out. “But how can you know where to point it if you’ve never gone there from here?” he asked, rejoining the others.
Which added another name to his list, he was surprised to find. Apparently forgiveness was a sneaky beast. Too late to change anything now. “Take me to him.”
“I know, I know but… I can’t, Tony, I… The future, it’s… There’ll always be a fight, and this means there’ll always be me, so I’ll have to keep fighting, and I can do it, I can fight but every time it takes more and it’s blocking me out, he’s blocking me out so there’s room for nothing else and there’s nothing left except fighting and waiting and watching everyone go on without me and it’s too much, I can’t, I’m not- I’m tired, I don’t want to fight anymore, please don’t make me fight, Tony, I’m nearly gone, it’s gone, there’s nothing left and
The first wave of shock was almost peaceful, seeming to stretch every second into a century. Tony found himself blissfully aware of every molecule of his surroundings, the leaves on the trees sparkling under the low beams of the day’s last sunlight. In return for peace it seemed such a small thing that he couldn’t quite make himself speak. Then the second wave hit, shame and terror and self-loathing, because he realized why; he had nothing left worth saying.
The young Queen stared at him; again he watched the spark of hope return life to a haunted face. His friends were so willing to believe. He hadn’t expected it. Beside the Queen, Okoye was frowning, and Tony prepared himself to explain.
Wrestling his own surging terror, Tony tried to find words to respond, to comfort, but he ran out of time.
His friend snorted and clapped him on the back. “Great, cos I’m kinda not in the mood to whoop your ass again.”
“Pretty good, right?” Ty’s voice purred over the speakers. “The surgeries were very expensive, but what a result. He looks
it. I couldn’t believe how fucked up I was, after. I tried to just move on and forget about you, as if nothing had happened. I didn’t want to think about you ever again. When I couldn’t stop, I told myself it’s because I hated you, but…”
Vormir turned out to be a morbid slump of a planet, seemingly perched on the perpetual edge of twilight. The land was a maze of shallow puddles between dunes of black sand, the sky above eerily lit by an eclipse stuck on the brink of totality. Luckily, it had human compatible air so Tony and Steve could throw the breathers back through the portal before Nebula closed it.
. Tony would have liked to be grateful, but the absence left him echoing with uneasy anticipation. He tried to drown out the disquiet by laughing louder, chattering harder, to apparent success.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed. “Yeah.” But he didn’t move until the full minute was up, and neither did Tony.
He really shouldn’t be encouraging such behavior, could see in his mind a dozen ways it could all turn to horror, but Steve decided not to intervene. Instead, lying back in the golden light, he let himself savor the love stampeding like a wild thing through his home, this one jeweled moment within infinity.
Finding out that Steve was this close to breaking - had maybe been broken, unnoticed, for a while - was like watching the world end all over again.
Halfway through trying, Tony threw up from the pain and it became clear to both of them that the correct answer was, in fact, no. Steve placed him carefully back on the ground, bracing him upright when he slumped dangerously forward. Tony would have thanked him for the help except he couldn’t stop his teeth chattering enough to form the words.
Tony allowed himself a grin. “Amazing. I wouldn’t have lasted ten seconds without them. If I’d had FRIDAY with me, I would’ve had him.”
Tony’s answer was that awful bitter laugh again. “Uh, you know what, that’s a great question,” the other man said, his armored hand swiping clumsily at his face.
“No, it was awful,” he admitted. “But the relentless physical misery kinda took my mind off things.”
She gave him a withering look. “Please. If you’re going to steal my boyfriend, I think you can at least call me Pepper,” she said; nearby, Sam choked on his drink.
“Excellent, you’re all here,” the tall man said. He had the haughty air of a bored substitute teacher, a well-shaped goatee, and Tony had absolutely no idea who he was. Judging from the fearsome array of weapons that had appeared, neither had anybody else. Tony glanced down at his bare palms, only then realizing he could have summoned the armor.
worthy, you are good, so good, I’m the one who fucked up being your friend and you deserve so much better, you deserve everything, you… Tony, you’re the best person I’ve ever known.”
- Steve had taken him deep once more, heat and stars, everything, everything, while Steve’s hand was sliding under Tony, eager fingers seeking, and just that first brush of contact against his asshole had Tony punching at the mattress because what the fuck else had he been doing with his life and yes, he begged, Steve, more, that, pleaseplease
From somewhere above, Steve muttered something breathlessly unintelligible that may have included his name; then the other man sped up, helplessly thrusting in needy little jerks that deepened until Tony was left gasping for air, reeling for balance because the world no longer included up or down, left or right, back or forward; only Steve and not-Steve; only Tony, lost, and Tony, found. With a merciless groan Steve came, hard and fast, fingers clenched tight in Tony’s hair with just the right amount of carelessness, just on the right side of rough.
But the other man wouldn’t look at him. “I have to,” he whispered. “I have to, Steve, you don’t understand-”
Tony watched him go, strangely reluctant to follow right away, and for reasons beyond what was happening in his pants. Because sure, he’d had… lapses before. Going on years, really. Moments of appreciation in a Steve-ish direction. Obviously. Look at the man. But it was just biology, he’d always reasoned. Accidental stimuli. Nothing Steve was
Tony nodded. “At first.” A shy smile broke over his face. “Then, everything, Steve. It was so… beautiful. Elegant. Like... The best math you could ever imagine. I saw.. I think I saw the future. Or maybe a bunch of futures, they all spilled over so fast but god, Steve, I
May snorted softly, but she motioned to the door, then led him upstairs to the ICU. Doctor Palmer spotted them arriving and showed them to Steve’s room right at the end of the hall.
Steve was reaching for him now, was frowning at Tony’s own shirt, had grabbed a handful of the fabric near the neck. “May I?” he asked; Tony nodded, neither knowing nor caring what he was agreeing to because the mannerliness of the request paired with the wild look in Steve’s eyes was giving him heart feelings mixed with dick feelings and they really did go together nicely in a wine and cheese sort of a-
“Oh, I did,” Tony said, then bit his lip. “I tried to. Made it easier to live with. But deep down I knew. What I’d done. What I was.”
wow, it took much longer than i expected to put poor Steve back together, i had no idea his arc was gonna swoop so low when i started but there it went, zooming right off the graph paper. (if you really want a fun time, try watching LOTR with Sad Steve in your head, oh my GOD)
“-not improving,” Helen was saying, and Steve saw Dr Palmer was hovering behind her, reading the machines.
The AI obliged. “A ship has appeared in orbit, boss. The system detected no sign of approach. It just wasn’t there, until it was. According to its entry vector, it is heading for New York.”
Shuri rolled her eyes and brought up some rapidly scrolling data from her wrist interface. “You’ll sit until I say otherwise, Stark. That was a nasty kebab impression you had going on. Plus whose idiotic idea was it to use my nanobots as an internal bandage?”
Steve winced, seemed to retreat further into himself. “I’m so sorry,” he blurted out. “If I scared you, before.” Steve brought his hand up to the scar on Tony’s shoulder, traced its permanent reminder of the worst day of his life. “Or ever. I really didn’t mean to… I never wanted to…”
Clint sat up, delighted to indulge in his favorite topic before a fresh audience. “It’s all of his usual bullshit, but now his diva ass doesn’t bother to show up for anything involving the Avengers until we’re already on the field. He literally phones it in to briefings, bails on press conferences, he flat-out refuses to train with us. This past year he’s spent all his time either out west or off with Stone getting his rich ass kissed by paparazzi.  Honestly, he’s been acting like he’s above the team ever since his buddy Ross fucked us with the Accords, and I’m over it.”
Dazzled, Tony grasped after sense, but when the hovering doctors made no move to intervene, he saw no possible refusal.
“Play it,” he whispered, then closed his eyes and listened as his former bodyguard’s voice rang out in the empty room.
“You don’t remember me?” the Soul Stone asked, a glint of merciless ice in her eyes. “How unmannerly. But I know you, Thanos, son of A’lars. To win my favor, you freely murdered the one you loved. I know exactly who and what you are.” Gamora gasped and backed away from her, Tony placing a comforting hand on the child’s shoulder.
Tony glanced up, found Steve’s face. “Hi,” he breathed, and Steve’s heart swooped again, hope and longing smoothing out into joy and amazement.
It seemed he wasn’t the only one. After they landed, Nebula and Rocket stayed in the cockpit running scans of the local area while Tony, Thor, Bruce and Steve rejoined Clint and Natasha in the larger cargo area. The two spies had already finished up the final equipment checks, and for the next few minutes, there was nothing for the strike team to do but wait. Steve looked around. There had been an awkward moment back on Earth when he’d first realized the initial team was going to include only the original Avengers, but considering they hadn’t fought together since Sokovia, having a kind of reunion now felt nice. Felt fitting, being here together in this terrible now.
Steve kept his gaze steady on Tony’s face, looking up at him. “See, Tony? You’re not alone anymore. Please, just tell us how we can help.”
When their adversary realizes he’s defeated, he sets the device to self-destruct. Tony pushes Steve out of the way and takes the full brunt of the resulting blast.
Tony coughed once, experimentally. “As I recall, I told you not to watch that movie.” His voice was croaky but functional, and brought a smile to Rhodey’s face.
,” Tony groaned when Steve moved to sucking hard on his neck, proving himself still capable of some speech.
“He’ll come back,” Steve murmured, but the shapes of the words were drifting in and out of focus, blurring the urgency of their meaning.
Tony felt his blood freeze. “You know me?” Despite his galloping heart-rate, his own voice sounded casual, even bored, but he was glad to note Wong and Rogers appearing at his back.
Once, her words would have shattered him, but Tony just nodded, vaguely numb. She took his hand, kind even in this, and he kissed her fingers, refusing to hide his regret. People called him a genius but it was Pepper who had challenged him more than vice-versa, whose insight and wisdom he relied on more than anyone knew. Keeping up with her had been exhilarating, sometimes infuriating. Here again, she was speaking a truth he wanted to resist, except… he could see what she was saying. Sometimes pain could be as shocking in its absence as its presence; somehow now, under the shock… he was okay.
Tony grinned. Keeping up with MJ meant the kid’s life would never be boring, even outside of his Avengers duties. “I’ll pass on the compliment.”
Despite the urgency in the chatter around him, Steve had drifted too far out to keep track of concern. He lay still, not resisting, as gentle but efficient hands changed his sheets, replaced his pillow, smoothed his hair. As he had done for her, badly, at the end. As she had done for him so patiently, countless times before.
this look on him before. In Siberia, as part of the sick mind-games of a twisted man. But this time, it was
“I know she will,” Tony said, and that won a smile from the young Queen. “And if it’s magic you need, maybe the wizard can help you out. Talk to Nebula and Thor. Whoever goes, they can bring the message back to him.”
The other man winced visibly, another bad sign of his exhaustion. “Uh, yeah. He left again for the Sanctum, but I could call, get him back here?”
“Uh,” Steve said, their words stinging more than he’d like. “Okay, I hear you. But is that really… I mean… Isn’t that just the job?”
A few minutes later, Nebula announced it was time to disembark, and, still attuned as one, they broke the circle, busying themselves with their individual equipment. No one said anything, because nothing needed to be said.
, at all times and everywhere. He wanted to find something useful to do, but he didn’t even know where to begin. People at SHIELD had offered to help, but they all looked at Steve with so much awe that he felt like even more of a fraud.
Helen took a deep breath. “I’m afraid it’s too late for that. The tests showed significant exposure. An infection has already taken hold, and unfortunately, it is progressing rapidly.”
“Hours,” Helen said with all the harsh kindness of her profession, leaving no room for false hope. “With aggressive treatment, maybe a day.”
Steve remembered everything. The sound of air, then water rushing through the cracked glass. The metallic taste of panic, despair. How his lungs had burned as he’d drowned. How they’d kept burning, how he’d kept drowning, unable to die, unable to escape. The cold enveloping him, seeping into him. Then the ice. Tiny shards of agony, white hot splinters of pain as his cells died and were reborn and died and were reborn and died over and over. Destroying him. Creating him.
A portal opened in the freshly deserted room and Strange emerged, his cape set to full haughtiness. “I’m taking the Time Stone to Wakanda,” he announced curtly. “We must hope Thanos will focus his attack there, or he could destroy half the Earth.” He hesitated. “I promise I will see to your friend on my return.”
Yet Tony was sinking lower in his chair. “But it wasn’t,” he whispered, “Steve, it- it wasn’t hard at all… I’m a fucking coward, I know, but I just
Steve watched Tony flinch away, his dark eyes wild with denial. “Then we need to replace the serum, he needs… Bruce is back, he’ll figure it out, and Shuri, we can get them here, get him the serum and then he’ll be
Tony looked helplessly at the doctors. “It’s his decision,” Dr Palmer said quietly, as Dr Lewis stared at the floor. Helen just shook her head.
The phone erupted in white sparks, but he’d already let it fall to the ground; from deep inside the mansion there was a strange, electrical sizzling.
“Exit strategy,” he said. Dead garden, empty sky. “I thought, since the ice didn’t work, fire might. And this way, there’s no mess. So you see? You don’t have to do anything, Tony. Either way, I’ll be okay. Don’t worry about it.”
“I love you,” Steve repeated, then he had to duck back under the mask, feeling like he might suffocate under the weight of his sudden, agonized hope.
Peter. In a blast of pure panic, Tony considered smashing out a window to escape. He could deploy the suit before he hit the ground.
Wilson turned to Strange, who shrugged. “He has suffered a nasty concussion,” the Doctor pointed out. “Clearly he’s in no shape to fight.” Slowly, Wilson nodded, his mouth set unhappily.
The isolation room was anonymous and dull, all ugly lines and blank gray surfaces. Transferred to a steel gurney, Steve made himself hold still as the four nurses cheerfully but thoroughly wiped him down with some foul-smelling liquid. After, they moved him to the new bed and hooked him up to the new machines. As they worked around him, Steve counted down the minutes by the beeps of his new machines, the sedation remixing his fear into a whirling drowsiness.
“The pilot mentioned an injury,” the General said instead. She was staring at the hole in his side, the source of the pain Tony kept losing track of, and which turned out to be bleeding again.
High overhead, Rhodey passed by, his nanotech suit gleaming in the sun. “Area is secure, Cap,” he announced over the comms. “Looks like we’re free and clear for phase two.”
It wasn’t a hard question, but Steve actually had to think about it. “Can I just say ours? I kinda don’t see a difference anymore. If it affects him, it affects me.”
She tilts her head in birdlike curiosity. “Your presence here suggests victory, and yet…” She steps near and Steve averts his gaze, choked anew by the concern in her eyes. “It seems you have paid a terrible cost.”
So he begs. “Just hold on, Tony,” Steve says, “you’re safe now, you’re nearly home. Just hold on a little longer, please.” But Tony falls silent, stays silent even as a chorus of voices around them joins in, keeps murmuring words of support into the silence even after the Wakandan healers take Tony away, someone else carrying Steve away to where he waits and waits and then away again to a quiet place where he can rest, soothing voices and warmth in the dark, arms holding him close until he stops, until he sleeps, until he dreams.
, Rogers,” Tony gasped, shoving him away so hard that Steve sprawled out on his ass. The other man made it a few more steps alone, but by the time he reached the stairs he had to sit, collapsing with a graceless crash. Tony buried his face in his hands and cried, visibly shaking. Each sob wracked his whole body, the painful spasms visible even through his armor.
Of course, she came to his rescue. “They told me it’s been six months for you,” she said. “That we lost, the first time. But you came back and saved everyone.”
Thanos laughed, a brutal sound. “Then listen well, sorceress,” he proclaimed. “For my purpose is just and my cause is true-”
“Considering it was classified information, you shouldn’t even know his name,” Steve said, glaring at Stark.
Steve opened his eyes, wanting to sneak a look at their faces, watched as one by one they had the same idea, met his gaze, each other’s. Only Tony still had his eyes closed, directly opposite him, and Steve let himself look at the billionaire’s face, let himself savor the sight. Job within the job. Tony opened his eyes, looked around at everyone else. Then Steve. Only Steve.
Steve took a breath, staring up at the ceiling as he gathered his thoughts. “Finding the Winter Soldier was Avengers business, but finding Bucky… That was for me. I didn’t want to stop, but I thought… I knew if I told you, you’d still help me look for him, but I thought, if you knew, watching me search for him might hurt you.” He shook his head, impatient. “Or, maybe it wouldn’t. Maybe hurting you was out of my reach, maybe nothing I did would matter to you… I didn’t know which would be worse. So I didn’t want to find out. And I kept telling myself, there would be time to explain after I found him, after he was safe, until eventually I just stopped thinking about it. Then, when I saw the video… I knew from the start it was a mistake, that I was making everything worse by being such a coward, but that day, when you looked at me… that’s when I realized it was too late, that I’d already lost you.”
“Okay,” Steve said. “I won’t, I- Whatever you need, Tony. Tell me, please. You have to understand, I want to make this right.”
No one said a single word until Nat returned. Whether that was a blessing or a curse, Steve didn’t know, but when she came back, there was rage darkening her face. “He’s gone,” she announced.
“I’ve got you, I’ve got you, I’m okay, you’re okay, Tony, it’s me, I’ve got you…” But it really was Steve’s voice in his ear, Steve’s arms holding him close, keeping him safe, Steve’s scent and breath and touch. The man he maybe loved, somehow, impossibly, returned.
Then Shuri, Rocket and Tony were off, arguing back and forth about something quantum and complicated. Steve didn’t like Thor’s expression and gently steered him into a chair, resting his hand on the Asgardian’s shoulder. Time was, he wouldn’t have dared presume, but small affectionate gestures meant a lot these days, he was learning. Steve tried to follow the rapid debate but was lost as ever until Tony eventually took pity on him, slowing down enough to explain the basics.
Instead Tony watched Steve from afar while wearing his best party face, jibed and fooled as he usually did, but as the hours wore on, even he could feel his efforts falter. By the time the kitchen delivered a late roast supper he was about ready to quit and go to bed; luckily, Barton volunteered to go fetch them all a round of food, so Tony didn’t have to get up. Unluckily, Nat took his chair to sit beside Tony, and he braced himself for the inevitable interrogation. How like her to wait until he was exhausted, then pounce.
Slowly, the waiting room had been filled to capacity with the exhausted bodies of Earth’s defenders, hearts heavy despite the great victory. Tony saw their grief and hated them for it, closing his eyes against their tears. In turn, he felt the others shrink away from him, their silence speaking volumes. It just wasn’t
“Thanos is most likely on Titan. It is reported that the planet has been restored to how it looked before its destruction. Therefore I believe he still possesses a working Gauntlet.” The android seemed to hesitate. “I… can confirm the Andromeda galaxy was equally and instantaneously affected by his actions. Rumor suggests the same throughout the known universe.” Steve was surprised to feel his heart lurch. Clearly some part of him had still hoped there was some limit to the Devastation, some peaceful oasis beyond horror’s reach. Onscreen, Nebula shook her head. “I am now returning to Earth. Expect me in a week.”
“I don’t know. Likely the herb was stolen, or maybe sold by one of our own. The enhancements to Captain Rogers’ abilities follow the elixir’s basic pattern. But it seemed the Europeans further enhanced its effects with gamma radiation. Somehow this made the changes permanent, irreversible.” Shuri hesitated, looking over at where Bruce and Okoye were feeding the newly kindled fire. “But now I cannot synthesize a new serum without the herb itself. I have tried everything I can think of, but the herb’s magical properties are beyond my understanding. It’s just… it’s not possible.” Her voice trembled, a rare crack in her usual confident demeanor. “Despite my hopes, my brother will truly be the last champion of Wakanda. And then the Black Panther will be no more.”
As the tycoon’s face dropped, Tony smiled. “Of course, losing your little safety blanket leaves you rather exposed, doesn’t it? Plenty of sharks will be circling.” He let his voice cool to ice. “Once word gets out, that is.”
She sighed, moving to the end of the bed and picking up his chart. “And he meant every word, I’m sure,” she said. “Right up until he didn’t.”
After a fearsome and lengthy battle on the outskirts of Wakanda, Thanos was at last decapitated by Thor, his army fleeing into full retreat. Doctor Strange, War Machine and Spider-Man immediately returned by portal to New York, arriving right on the stroke of midnight.
It felt like hours before Tony was able to open his eyes again, but the clock on the dashboard claimed only minutes had passed. Steve was still holding him tight; the sensation filled him with a rising warmth that helped steady his trembling limbs.
“Of course not,” Steve said, aghast. Everything was coming out all wrong. “No, Tony, that’s not what I- I thought if I could find Bucky first, I could find out the truth. Of course I would have told you once I knew for sure. I just didn’t want to tell you something so awful without confirming it first.” He clenched his teeth in frustration. His reasons had felt so solid at the time, but now, hearing them out loud, they sounded… weak. He mustn’t be explaining them right.
Ty didn’t reply, but Tony could hear him breathing. “Party of the century,” the other man said eventually. “Yeah, right. More likely weak beer and a pig on a spit. Yet given the cause, I suppose we should at least show our faces.”
At Nat’s nudge, Clint looked over; his eyes widened, then narrowed. Grudgingly, he nodded, so Steve tried to let his fury go, but it was just… Tony was trying so hard to act like he was okay, laughing with Bruce and Rhodey over the latter’s awful sandwich tastes, but here and there his hands would shake, and there was still that brittle edge to his smiles. Steve would not stand to see him upset, but from the soft looks from the rest of the team, they seemed to agree that Tony was to be protected. Gradually, the impromptu meal felt less like the tail end of a funeral and more of a celebration, the group only growing more raucous as the food ran out.
“No, don’t-” Tony grabbed his arm but the other man brushed him off, instead striding towards a babbling Ty with his shield raised for a killing blow-
The whole team would meet for morning debrief over breakfast, or supper for the night shift. Then Tony would disappear off to work in the main lab with some combination of Thor, Rocket, Bruce and the Queen, plus Nebula on occasion. Steve would head to Command Ops; from there he could manage the international crises of the day with the steady assistance of FRIDAY, plus usually Rhodes and Clint on the day shift, with Nat and Okoye handling nights.
Already halfway out of the room, Tony spluttered a laugh. Forget snark, the AI was becoming a downright sass machine. “Will do.”
for trying to save the world from a nest of Russian Nazi super-soldiers. Short odds are he’ll call back in the morning with a plea deal.”
“You’re the gift, kid,” Tony murmured in his ear. Somehow he had the words for this. “I’m sorry that I haven’t been around as much as I should. I’m sorry for- well, a lot of things I haven’t done. Some that I have. But I hope you know that meeting you, knowing you, has been the single greatest honor of my life. You mean the world to me, Pete. From now on, I promise to show it, I’ll do better, I swear.”
,” Steve blurted out; the denial had launched itself straight from his gut, bypassing all conscious thought. Only by focusing desperately did he manage to avoid embarrassing himself further. “I mean… Tell me what happened with Thanos.”
“Do you know what this, Captain Rogers?” she asked when he joined her. A hologram of some sort of plant was projected before her, rotating slowly.
The fact that Stark wanted nothing to do with the Avengers anymore had made Steve’s life much easier.
Of course, he’d been the one to save them all, had instantly seen the threat, alone on the battlefield, and made the unthinkable choice. Accepted the cost. Bruce had figured it out afterward from the energy readings, had explained this final gift he’d given them, one last solution to a problem nobody else had foreseen.
His recorded voice went on begging, but Tony had blocked out the sound, consumed with the sight of Steve staggering backwards, away from the screens, away from Tony-
Ty scowled, his expression dark as thunder, his shoulders slumped in defeat. “If you have demands, name them.”
“-so you think he may have some connection to the Soul Stone,” Doctor Strange finished, his excitement no less.
Instead of answering, Tony took Steve’s hand and placed it squarely on his own crotch, so there could be no mistaking the situation there. This was not a subtle move, since he figured the bulge could probably be seen from space. The other man looked down, then back up at him, his expression still closed off, still unreadable.
Tony exhaled slowly. It definitely wouldn’t be his first preference for a conversation, and he wasn’t sure he was ready to be reasonable yet, but Steve had his sad face on, and that was not okay. Not today. “How about you say whatever you wanna say, and I’ll listen. I just… may not have much to add.”
Yet even nature decreed that some lives could thrive on annihilation, on tragedies; on terrible cracks in the peaceful order of things. Like a rare flower long deprived of sunlight suddenly blooming in the devastation left after a forest fire. It wouldn’t last. He knew it couldn’t last.
Tony sank back on the couch, sagging under his growing exhaustion, because, in truth, he wanted to go. Seeing the kid was always an instant mood boost, and it had been months. Any other time, he would have fought to go. But right now, he couldn’t afford the effort.
It’s not enough. It’s not enough but Tony blinks, then pastes a fake smile on his face. “Saving half the universe, huh? Worse ways to go.” Yet his eyes are hollow with their sympathy, and there’s a distinct tremble in his voice that wasn’t there before. The man looks
Yet when Captain Steve Rogers finally forces his eyes open, the scepter is lying beside him, immune to his confusion; when he hears footsteps crunch upon the shattered glass, he rolls to his feet, ready to keep fighting.
Oh, sure, on Friday he’d gone along readily enough with the team’s schedule, following commands without a fuss, otherwise ignoring Steve’s entire existence but in a polite sort of way. He’d left early to continue his lobbying on Asgard’s behalf, promising a punctual return.
Something warm and terrible breathed through him like a sigh, and Steve felt his eyes roll closed, felt the exhaustion lying in wait rise to pull him under.
Steve tries not to snarl his reply but fails. “I’ve seen what it can do. Besides,” he tries to smile, again fails, “I know we can’t risk any more branches to the timeline. Bruce made that clear.”
“That last break was pretty nasty, even for you. Honestly, I don’t know what you Avengers are trying to do to each other in these training sessions but maybe y’all should take it down a notch,” Dr Lewis went on.
He touches the strap on his wrist, aching for who first put it there. “If I change what happens here,” he says heavily, “it won’t change what happened before, will it?”
“Does anybody know, Tony?” Steve asked, when he could breathe again. “Do you have someone you can talk to-” Tony shook his head, once, still with his back turned, and Steve ached with the misery etched into his every line. “Then can you talk to me?” he whispered. “Please?” Steve held his breath, numb with hope.
“Don’t get your sparkle-pants in a twist,” Tony said breezily while rolling his eyes, which meant he was properly injured. “Got my head rattled by some road, saw stars for a bit, which up til that moment I had assumed was just a cartoon thing-”
Only when Thor returned in a blast of rainbow glory had the balance finally tipped in Earth’s favor. With help from Mantis and Wanda, Spider-Man and the Hulk had finally managed to wrench the Gauntlet from Thanos’ hand. Faced with certain defeat, the Mad Titan had briefly managed to escape his captivity and order his armies into one massive, futile attack. Hoping to avert a massacre, Thor tracked Thanos down on the battlefield and fought him, one on one, the Asgardian king eventually decapitating the Mad Titan in a single stroke. As their commander fell, the alien armies turned tail and fled.
Tony stared back, oblivious to the tears descending in a slow hopeless slide down his face. “I don’t… I don’t
Natasha took a long steadying breath, then pinned Tony with a sharp glance. “I’ve been trying to get him to sleep. You’ve always been the Steve whisperer. Maybe you can do a better job.”
“Wakanda,” he heard Tony agree. “They’re on full alert. Uh, also, Thanos lied. Thor’s alive, and he’s on his way home.”
As Sunday wore on, Steve’s fury didn’t dim, but it did retreat to the back of his mind. Doctor Strange came to join him on the roof for a time, which helped. Steve asked endless questions about magic that were probably really stupid, but the Doctor didn’t seem to mind. He wouldn’t talk about the threats he’d alluded to, but he was refreshingly candid about the basics of magical power, explaining how its mastery was not an innate gift born to a lucky few, but a skill anyone could learn. When the Doctor left him to his watch, Steve stared out over the city, his thoughts aglow with all the mysteries of the universe.
“I’m guessing it’s not for the bagels,” Tony said, initiating a deeper proximity scan. If Hope and Scott were present like they should be, they were currently undetectable to his sensors, which was kinda a
Tony thought back to how sick he’d been with his cheeseburger binge right after Afghanistan, and nodded. He sat with Rhodey in their comfortable silence and let his thoughts wander. Accelerated healing always felt peculiar. Waking up with the pain erased, his mind still raw but his body left eerie. Disconnected. Like the way he knew he should eat but wasn’t actually hungry yet; the way he should be a post-apocalyptic mess but felt a hollow calm instead. He could feel a suffocating urgency raging within, but somehow he was sitting beside it, watching. He knew he could dive in, should dive in immediately and let the momentum take him. It was what was going to happen, after all.
Rhodey pinned him with a cutting stare. “Maybe there was ‘something’ that should have happened. Maybe the ‘problem’ is that it didn’t.” Airquotes. Really?
“The squid squad hit New York looking for the Time Stone,” he said. “And got it, but it was still attached to the wizard that owned it. Doctor Strange. Actual name, actual doctor. They took him back to their ship. I managed to sneak on board, but I wasn’t the only one.”
But of course, Steve had come prepared - Cap smirk - and was already holding up a small bottle that Tony recognized as lube.
“I honestly didn’t really think about it,” Tony said, glancing at the closed door. If someone, anyone, walked through, he would have a reason to hang up. Stop it before he really got started.
was fully repaired, Tony usually spent his evenings working on in the lab until the minute Steve came and got him; all bar Sundays, when he and Rhodey took their upgraded nanosuits out for a spin. The rest of the lab crew seemed content to nap when they dropped; if nothing else, their erratic schedule meant there was always at least one other person awake and working in there. But as he was kinda the key to the restoration of half the universe, Steve insisted on putting Tony to bed at a reasonable hour. At first he’d argued for a full eight-hour window to recover optimal function, but Tony claimed to be one of those rare humans who naturally thrived on just five hours’ sleep a night, so Steve had given in. Well, maybe Tony had had to convince him. There may have been a presentation. With bullet points. And a few scans, with expert testimony from Shuri and Bruce. Anyway. Early in the second week, Tony had stopped arguing when Steve showed up every evening, and halfway through week three had admitted that the regular schedule may have improved the quality of his work. Steve tried not to be smug.
“Saline and electrolytes, mostly.” May glanced over at him, eyes inscrutable. “How bad was today, really?”
“Before we go in there… There’s some stuff you should know,” Tony said. He wished he felt something, anything, but he was empty, and Steve was only looking at him like that because he didn’t
Tony turned to find himself under sharp-eyed scrutiny from Rocket, but the raccoon merely shrugged. “I guess I have some time to waste. Lead on, fancy genius.”
“And who’d we lose?” Tony asked, as if this whole conversation hadn’t been leading up to that question, this moment.
“I know.” Pepper moved on to smoothing his hair, and he watched her eyes. There was so much he needed to say to her, so much to explain, but he couldn’t find a way to begin.
Steve stepped towards Tony, still desperately trying to find words to apologize, but instead of saying anything he was taking the other man in his arms and then Steve was kissing Tony and he was-
A golden sort of happiness flooded through Tony, warm dawn after the longest night, but Steve didn’t wait for him to respond. Instead, the other man looked down and Tony’s gaze followed as if dragged; they both watched as Steve pulled out halfway, only to slide slowly back inside him, and Tony felt a cascade of pleasure detonate throughout his entire body. The noises he made as a result were both embarrassingly loud and mathematically inevitable but Steve gave the sexiest groan in history in response, falling in to bury his face in Tony’s neck while muttering his own string of curses.
“Ah, dammit,” Tony muttered, then he was standing in a rush. “I, uh… Give me a minute.” He sounded so odd, but when Steve opened his eyes to apologize for the awkwardness, Tony had already left, the other room empty behind the glass.
. Unable to bear the man’s touch, he flinched away, his very skin aching at the loss of Tony’s heat.
The crisis intervention teams were in good shape, having run several difficult missions each since the Devastation. In contrast, the lab crew were relatively sloppy after long weeks of inaction, but a further ten days of drills brought them back up to fighting speed. After Shuri began running nightly healing sessions on the whole team, Steve pushed them harder than Tony would have thought possible.
Yet as the minutes slipped by and Tony stayed gone, a restless unease rose within him, wearing away at his equilibrium. The serum hunger soon drove him towards the kitchen, where he spent a busy hour raiding the freezer and cooking the best meal he could assemble. Yet despite his enhanced appetite, he struggled to clear his plate, and had to force himself to swallow. Cleaning the kitchen and checking over his gear ate up another hour or so, but eventually he ran out of distractions. He found himself back by the window, staring without seeing as the ocean waves rose and fell.
Yet the tall man was unimpressed by the display. “Oh, calm down,” he said briskly. “My name is Doctor Stephen Strange. And I’m here to help.”
“I know, Steve,” the other man said simply, defeat and something worse in his voice. That… made no sense. That couldn’t make sense, it didn’t-
Yet there was no pain, no chaos, no suffering this time. He just opened his eyes to find the same alien sky, but now, he and Tony were not alone. Nearby, the hulking form of Thanos loomed over a small, green-skinned girl. Steve would have assumed she was the Soul Stone’s current form except they both seemed so confused to see them.
,” Steve breathed against his ear, his name sending scalding electric sparks all the way to his cock. He pushed Steve to sit up and helped pull the shirt over his head, then for a good eight point three seconds forgot how to breathe. He’d seen Steve shirtless before, of course, but in this moment…
But the other man winced at the sound of his name, and Steve’s confidence wobbled. “-thank you,” he said instead, his words tangling together. “For staying, for not- not leaving me alone, I don’t know how I would- I can’t do this without you. I’m sorry, I know that’s not fair to say, but Tony, I just, I can’t believe you
He takes one moment, there beside Vision’s body, then he stands. He takes stock of the grieving around him. Romanoff. Rhodes. Banner. Okoye. The survivors bear no significant injuries that he can see. Nearby, the raccoon is weeping. The Captain reaches down, grasps a paw, pulls him to his feet. No one quits today.
“I know,” Tony whispered. Sorry, he was forever sorry. “But they’re gonna need you when this is over.”
“It might just be a coincidence, but I think it’s worth exploring. I may invite Heimdall for tea, once the Asgardians are settled,” the Doctor said.
The other man’s touch was gentle. Reverent. Just like Steve remembered. Tony’s thumb skimmed Steve’s palm. Despite the layers between them, Steve felt a single thrilling jolt dart throughout his entire being, as if the ripped seams of the past two years had been smoothed back into rich, glorious alignment. Tony turned Steve’s hand over, then enfolded it tight in both of his, their fingers entwined as if in prayer. He was shaking, or Tony was, he wasn’t sure; Steve couldn’t be sure where either of them began anymore, where either of them ended, whether they were two or some ecstatic unitary one-
Steve’s awareness had been building towards the evening all day, anticipation now tingling throughout his entire body, a languid expectation born of knowing exactly what was to come later. The tallest hill over the lake. Sunset on the water. He knew because they did much the same thing every year. Once, he’d believed that traditions belonged only to the past, weapons of the restless dead that linked rigid unforgiving claws into all that may be. Now, Steve saw them as beacons within an uncertain future, familiar landmarks meant to help the living negotiate a compassionate path between holding on and letting go; a contract eternally evolving, to be willingly renewed.
“Mr Stark! Mr Stark!” The kid was nearly levitating with excitement. “You gotta see-” He glanced over his shoulder, “uh, something’s
Yet the kid tossed him a smile regardless, and next thing his bed was folding itself neatly upward into a semi-reclined chair. Show-off. “You stay put until I get over there,” Shuri ordered. “I’ll be done in a few minutes.”
“Get the hell outta here,” the other man said, rolling his eyes. Even now, treating goodbyes like they were no big deal.
No room for defeat. “Hey. Eyes up. Look at me, soldier,” Tony commanded, words like iron, cold and sharp. He waited until the other man complied, the fear in his eyes almost breaking Tony’s resolve. “Steve, please,” he whispered, his voice softening. “I know you’re scared, but you need to do this, okay? For me.”
Hovering above the Sanctum’s rooftop, the blank planes of Iron Man’s mask leered back at him. “Oh, gee, is
Gamora got to her feet, squaring her tiny shoulders, and stared at the Mad Titan, a thousand unspoken words passing between them. Then she reached out; Thanos took her hand gently, smiled. “Live free, little one,” he said softly.
Preoccupied with guilt, it was only after she’d left and he was walking along a random corridor alone that he realized he had no clue where Steve might be. He nearly asked FRIDAY for the super-soldier’s location, but then remembered she hadn’t been installed here yet. Everything in the Wakandan palace looked the same, and yet it felt nothing like the place he had known. Tony spotted some familiar faces who stared at him without recognition, counted many unfamiliar faces; his ears caught snatches of cheerful, ordinary, wonderful conversations as he passed. Wandering these halls was like walking through a dreamworld, and the weirdness soon began to stretch him thin.
Yet Tony chose not to comment; instead he began to speak, low and soothing, rattling off facts about the space network, thoughts about his suit, his myriad ideas about how to find the lost Soul Stone. Nothing really personal, Steve noticed, but he couldn’t blame Tony for his reserve considering Steve’s own betrayal had helped to shatter that line of communication forever. He lay back and closed his eyes, concentrating on the lilt of Tony’s chatter; of course, sleep soon came calling, but this time Steve resisted. He’d gone two long years without the sound of Tony’s voice. He could sleep later.
And now… Tony swallowed, tightened his arms around the sleeping man, as if that alone could keep Steve safe. The one lifeline that had kept him sane through the past six months was the knowledge that if they were successful, if the wizard was right, then the unfolding horrors were only going to be temporary, and someday, for someone, everything would be okay again. The belief had kept him skimming over the surface of all those desperate weeks, had provided him with the necessary mental leverage to survive the setbacks, the doubt, the fucked up sickening wrongness everywhere he looked. Even through every golden moment he got to spend with Steve, Tony had kept part of himself clear, aloof, because his faith in the wizard’s end meant believing he couldn’t keep any of it, the good or the bad, and so, right to the end, he had kept himself ready to let go.
May had frozen in shock, but with a deep breath she rallied. “You know Peter would never agree to stand by and watch people get hurt if he thinks he can help. And he’s a teenager, Tony, he always thinks he can help.”
“A soul for a soul,” the Stone said slowly; the small girl gasped. “I accept your bargain, Thanos of Titan.”
Steve knew just what to do. He held out his free left hand, waited. Tony reached out with his right hand, and they linked fingers. Serene within their circle, Steve bent down until his forehead pressed against Tony’s and closed his eyes. They took a breath together, then a second.
“Broken,” Tony said, still ice cold, yet his stance had softened. “For now, anyway. T’Challa says they can help.” He paused, ducked his head. “I thought you knew.”
Tony gave him a odd look, but right then the microwave pinged, recapturing the other man’s attention. “In other news, Zemo officially confessed to the bombing, so I - ouch,
Thankfully, it seemed to work; Tony was now sleeping soundly, sprawled across Steve’s chest. Unfortunately, that meant Steve couldn’t move, not even when Thor's return was accompanied by a visibly emotional Bucky. At the sight of his best friend’s distress, Steve yearned to stand and hug the man, but he equally couldn’t bear to disturb Tony’s rest.
it felt to hold Tony this close, as if they had always been designed to fit this way. Somehow with Tony’s cock in his mouth Steve felt more fully himself than he had on any battlefield, his mouth drawing forth merciless ecstasy, Tony twisting under his fingertips into some beautiful wild thing.
But instead of yelling, Tony carefully folded his arms, schooling his expression back to that flat, anonymous calm. “So really, it’s my fault,” he said, his voice tight and eerily quiet.
The General ignored him entirely, which only confirmed his guess. She’d be the first to glare at him whenever he was stupid, but still, she was kind. Actually, the Wakandans were all uncommonly kind, each discreetly ignoring his bullshit this past year, calmly handling his haphazard contributions, adapting to his unplanned absences. Working with them had been an honor and a joy, but he supposed it was finished, now. Unless the world ended. Out the window, Tony spotted familiar configurations of trees and fields, green and lush in their summer finery, and was seized with a bizarre ache to don his suit and fly in the opposite direction. He could escape, go anywhere. Take himself nowhere and just fly.
Usually Tony could think of two dozen ways to dodge any question, but here he was, drawing a blank. “Sometime soon, I promise.”
“How can you know where your toe is if it’s hidden in a shoe?” Nebula countered, then shook her head. “Inaccurate, but the sensation is comparable. Further explanation is redundant.” And she stormed through the portal as if embarrassed.
“I am,” Steve said, then he sighed again. “I will be. We will be. I hope. There’s just some stuff we need to… It’s complicated.”
Steve shook his head. “That won’t be necessary.” The Soul Stone seemed confused, so he explained. “Once we’ve stopped Thanos, we won’t need the Stones anymore. You can all go free.” He paused, turned to Tony. “Unless you can think of anything?”
But Tony’s whole body was still trembling, his mind still trapped in a thousand universes where Steve hadn’t listened, had murdered Ty and become a killer all because of him, all because of Tony’s stupid selfish pathetic-
Right, the plan. Tony remembered. Shuri, Bruce and Thor were heading back to Earth. There, the Queen would use the Gauntlet’s design to create transport devices for the remaining Infinity Stones, to bring them to Earth for safekeeping. Once Thor was safely off-world, Nebula was going to use the intact Gauntlet to wield the Space Stone. Thanos had found the Soul Stone on a planet called Vormir, and the android had argued there may be some useful information there; maybe they could even find a way to track the missing Stone. Privately, Tony suspected Nebula just wanted to pay her respects to her sister, but he didn’t want to rain on everyone’s optimism parade. The new Gauntlet should be able to handle a single Stone without difficulty, but just in case, Rocket was gonna pile the rest of the team into the
Steve set about pulling back the bed sheets and had Friday turn the Aircon on high in the bedroom so the bed could air while they were in the bath, he also brought through some candles which he lit about the bath and had Friday play quiet relaxing classical music to help them both relax.
“Excellent, I’d have hated to have to persuade you.” Somehow Natasha made the word Persuade sound very painful.
The asset was troubled. His arm hurt, the Iron Man had shot him and taken a chunk out of it, disabled three of the fingers and caused the rest of the arm to spasm. He needed servicing, repairs had to be done, he had to return to his handler and get maintenance.
“But they do feel the same!” Zach exclaimed bouncing on Bruce’s knees, making him tighten his grip to secure the toddler.
Once Tony had finished speaking to Jarvis the three of them quickly turned in, while Tony had said there was no issue with him sharing a bed with Steve, both of them were awkward as they actually got into bed together and shut out the light, laying side by side, very conscious of the fact that their shoulders were touching.
“Because you’re an idiot. He can’t just come out and say he’s enhanced, think about what would happen you dumbass, He wouldn’t be allowed to do anything normal anymore, do you think they’d let him stay in school, all those losers on the school board and those paranoid asshole politicians?”
Smashing his way through computer equipment and medical supplies Tony came to a stop before a medical table where a man in a lab coat was holding a scalpel to Peter’s throat.
“How do I know that?” Tony bellowed, making Zach jump and whimper, since he wasn’t used to his Mother yelling, “I’m sorry Stellina, don’t cry, it’s okay.” Tony soothed, picking him up.
It turned out Steve had been planning a romantic proposal at the Tower, had all of the team involved, had been going to have rose petals on the floor, candle light, romantic music, everything. Then Tony had surprised him with the Paris trip and he'd had to change plans on the hop. He'd been looking for places to propose since they'd arrived, The Louvre, Notre Dame, Versaille. Saint Germain. But in the end it was out in the street with fireworks blowing overhead and dozens of Parisians and Tourists around them celebrating New Year that Steve had chosen to get down on one knee.
“We will try and keep you out of the media as much as we can.” Pepper assured the parents, “But we can’t guarantee that your names won’t get out there.”
Had Maria known what Howard was doing to him? Had she cared at all what her Son was going through? By the time he’d been old enough to remember, Maria had been pretty much lost in a Valium fuelled haze and hadn’t been able to notice anything at all.
“Hopefully he burn the energy off before we get home.” Tony said to Steve with a sigh, as Zach gobbled up the candy floss and looked like he was vibrating with the sugar high, bouncing along besides Peter as they headed to one of the stalls to try and win a toy.
Tony sighed, “I’m not sure we can.” He said, “I’m not that young anymore. The Palladium did a number on me, I’m sure how healthy my eggs are or even if I am still fertile. There is also the Avengers to consider. I can’t be Iron Man when I’m pregnant, it wouldn’t be safe.”
“He has fled Novi Grad, possibly left Sokovia altogether.” Jarvis said, “Traffic and security cameras were limited in the city and even more sparse outside of the capitol. It was possible to track him as far as the city limits, after that I am afraid he was lost.”
“I at least won’t kill you myself.” Tony offered, “I’ll encrypt the details on wherever witness protection sends you, that’ll at least make things difficult for Ross and Stern to find you.”
Ned’s face fell, “That sucks.” He admitted. “I guess you’d be in danger too huh, from people wanting to use your powers for evil.”
“You carried me over your shoulder by my legs and had my face banging into your ass!” Spiderman exclaimed, “I was nearly face planted in the crack!”
“Fools!” the Skrull spat, “Even if Stark was jolted out of his sedation, he would be in no condition to do anything!”
“Can we speak to him?” Steve asked, perched on the edge of a scruffy and worn out sofa that was tucked into a corner of Tony’s workshop in the Tower, set before a chipped, stained, and wonky coffee table that wobbled whenever it was touched and threatened to collapse completely if too much weight was put on it.
“Maybe we can start an arrangement between super-villains and heroes.” Tony said, sounding Breathless and Steve looked up at the sky to see him fending off half a dozen bots. “Schedule attacks so that we don’t end up dealing with each-others enemies or pains in the asses, and Victor Von doom is a giant pain in the ass.”
Yeah, a chance. A mind rapist, a Hydra volunteer. Steve had let a wolf into his home and didn’t realize that sooner or later it would turn around and rip his throat out.
“Maybe,” Sam said glancing around the kitchen, he grabbed a couple of wooden spoons from a ceramic pot on the countered and offered them to Steve to a roll of bandages.
The next twelve years are going to be hard, far harder than you can imagine if you make the same mistakes I did. That is why I am writing this to you, to give you a chance to make different choices so you don’t have to face the same losses and have the same regrets as me.
“Pepper, she knows about this?” Steve was livid now, his face was red and the veins in his forehead were popped.
“I’m sorry.” He choked out, letting Peter beat him, not deflecting the blows or trying to calm him down, just letting Peter get the rage out of him.
The day started out perfectly well, almost normal, or what passed as normal in a tower occupied by Norse Gods, rages monsters, homicidal assassins, demented archers, spider mutants, fire mutants, super soldiers, super soldier groupies, and slightly deranged geniuses.
“Can I go, please say I can go, please, please, PLEASE!” Zach yelled bouncing up and down in his excitement.
Tony was right. Rhodey did indeed freak and insisted on coming over to the Tower, as did Pepper, so both were there when Matt arrived.
Zach immediately charged into the room and leaped onto the bed and then on top of Steve, the Super soldier managing to catch the flailing limbs and get him sat on his stomach.
Tony was strong, he’d survived worse than a gun shot, he’d had open heart surgery in a cave for God sakes, been tortured hours after it, had gone through being blown up multiple times, fought a demi God, an alien army, gone into space with a nuke and lived to tell the tale!
“You are certainly your Mother’s Son.” The man said, lifting Zach up and slinging him over his shoulder like he was a sack of potatoes. “Just as much trouble, more than you are worth.”
Somehow that suggestion had been turned into an “Epic slumber party” Steve wasn’t quite sure how that had happened but he had a sneaking suspicion that Clint was involved as he’d seen Peter high fiving the archer and that was very damning evidence.
The question took Steve slightly by surprise, and he turned, seeing Tony, half awake, yawning, and scratching his head. It was an adorable sight that struck a pang in Steve, as he recalled similar occasions with his Tony, the Tony who was gone now, lost to him, along with the rest of his world.
His knees protested as the thumped the ground with an audible noise and he grimaced at the feel of warm blood seeping into the trousers of his suit.
You won’t be alone though, even when I’m gone, I promise you’ll never be alone. Auntie Pepper, Uncle Rhodey, and Uncle Happy will take care of you. They’ll do the things I won’t get the chance to, and I’m sure they’ll tell you all about me, although a lot of it won’t be true. Don’t listen to your Uncle Rhodey when he tells you about the exploding bubblegum machine in M.I.T. He exaggerates everything, and I only lost part of my hair, not all of it.
The boys promised, Zach kissing Tony and bounding out of the car, running into the play ground to join his friends. When it was Peter’s turn he gave Tony a smile and promised to call if he needed to, then headed into his school at a much more sedate pace.
“I am sure you all recall Zach Stark’s abduction two years ago when the terrorist Aldrich Killian was using the Extreamis virus to turn people into bombs. He had Zach abducted to blackmail Tony into stabilizing the virus for him, and as added incentive, he injected Zach Stark with the virus.
“I would suspect Pietro of being the perpetrator of Sir’s injuries.” Jarvis said, “He is known to use conventional weapons as well as his super speed. His sister prefers to use her powers alone. That said, I would not be surprised to discover that she too had attacked Sir.”
Staying a relaxed as they could, the three of them made their way towards the exit and the agents who were trying to appear as if they weren’t searching for anyone and were just part of some beefed up security.
‘Not as bad as when we trekked all the way from Rio to Mexico City in bare feet’ Winter commented in Bucky’s head, ‘They were sore for days after that’
Steve gaped at Tony while Thor rounded on him with an enthusiastic “Aye Captain, we shall spend a night drinking deep of ale and rebounding each other with epic tales of our past loves while we watch fair maidens take their clothes off while swaying to loud music!”
“Everything is going to be fine.” Steve said as he bounced a cranky Lily in his arms. She had not enjoyed flying at all, or the time change and disruption to her routine.
“Nah, that’s alright.” Tony said patting Steve’s impressive bicep, “I’m not looking to get back on the dating scene.” He pulled his hand off Steve’s arm with some difficulty, really wanting to keep it there for a little longer. “But you should, start dating I mean.”
“Thank you Bob.” Tony said, “And lets see, who have we got here, hello Miss Brown, been a while, chewed up anymore billionaires lately or have you gone vegan?”
Tony shrugged, making Lily giggle at the motion, encouraging him to start bouncing her which brought out a peal of giggles. “Trying to hide this, or put a spin on this will only come back to bite us in the arse sooner or later. If we tell the world straight away then we show that we have nothing to hide and the world is far more likely to accept Steve and Lily-bee!”
Demands were being made for her to stand trial for her crimes, for her to be deported back to Sokovia where she would certainly face a death sentence for treason and terrorism.
Some of the snow Zach was holding melted and rained down onto Steve’s head and face, rolling down inside his collar and sending an icy stream down his back. In a second he was unable to breathe, was stumbling and falling to his knees as he began to gasp and choke for air.
“Sorry,” Tony slurred, not really sure why he was apologising, but feeling like he needed to anyway.
“Mamma, if you marry Steef will him be my Daddy?” he asked Tony, his heavy lidded eyes gazing up at the Billionaire Omega as Tony tucked him into bed.
Steve snorted at the unlikely scenario, “You have seen way to many movies at this point.” They both stopped and jerked their attention towards the boys tents were there was a yell, a squeal, and then laughter.
Although Tony was certain he wouldn’t be relaxing. Not when he would be fighting off ants, flies, mosquitos, neck and back ache, and quite possibly a masked psychopath from a slasher flick.
“The doctors discovered it while they were patching Stark up after your fight.” The Skrull panted, “Everyone knew you and he were involved, it was easy to guess who had fathered the child.” It grinned a sickly green grin, “Two for the price of one. A bargain. They get Stark’s genius engineering and a second generation super soldier.” It laughed, “And you delivered them both on a platter, Captain.”
So where would he hide….the lab, of course his lab had a bathroom, well a toilet and sink. If he wanted to hide this kind of thing he’d do it there because he was the only one to use it.
“I know I want to marry you but…..why does it have to be so complicated. In my day people booked the church, got rings and outfits, then had cake and bootleg champagne at their parent’s house.”
His legs would get tangled, his feet getting in one leg instead one leg each. Annoying things, pants.
Stark may not have wanted for any of this to happen, but he chose to become Iron Man, he chose to withhold his weapon from the American Government, he chose to continue being this icon which naturally singles him out from others and in doing so he put his family at risk.
Tony’s smile was tight as he kissed Zach good night and he had to support himself on the wall outside Zach’s room.
“No, I think it’s a good thing, but I also think Peter can do more than be a community service officer.” MJ replied, “He can find out what’s going on as Oscorp and expose Osborn for the creep he is.”
“Isn’t it?” Tony asked, “I chose to have the sceptre here. I said that no one would get to it, believed that my systems couldn’t be beaten, that I could face any threat and then Killian starts blowing shit up and everything goes to hell, all because of my damn ego.” He kicked at the nearest table making it shudder and scattered a box of screws across the floor.
Pepper smiled. She liked this Steve Rogers. He was good for Tony, good for all of them. He had already proven that he was protective and supportive of Tony, and this show of understanding that Tony needed privacy showed that he was a kind and thoughtful man too. Something else Pepper approved of.  She also thought that maybe the questions of a romantic relationship between Tony and this new Steve Rogers, may not be too far from the truth.
Violet softened as Tony charmed her and happily spoke of her Son’s fourth marriage to a woman thirty years younger than himself.
Once he did that, once he made everyone stop singing Stark’s praises and made them see him for what he was, Steve could show them the truth about Bucky, bring him home, where he belonged.
A broad smile lit up Thor’s face at last and he hugged Tony so tight that Tony feared his ribs might break, “Thank you friend Stark, we will be most honoured.” Thor said, “And I must recount to you of how my Lady Jane came to have the Reality Stone inside of her. You see, it began when she stuck her hand inside a rock, and the reality stone then stuck itself inside of her….!”
Feeling exposed in more ways than one, Tony quickly grabbed his vest and pulled it on to cover himself, he flinched as Steve’s hands moved to the sagging waist band of his trousers and batted at the hands with his cheeks flushing, “I can do it.”
“Tony!” Steve went after him and wrapped himself around Tony, taking his hands to stop him from hurting himself,
He would not say anything to the Captain but he wasn’t going to give up. He wouldn’t give up, Steve didn’t want to go through IVF treatments anymore than he did but that was not the only thing available, he could get laser surgery to clear away the scarring and cysts, he could have a D+C done to scrape clean his uterus, he could also have drugs that would increase his ovulations, to get his remaining ovary to work better. All of this he could and would do, but he wouldn’t drag Steve into it, he would go through this on his own, it was his fault that they were unable to have a child so it was his responsibility to fix it and come hell or high water he would do so.
The committee ordered a recess for lunch having spent the morning going over everything with Tony a second time and clarifying further points with him, leaving the Billionaire feeling exhausted as he stepped outside with Rhodey, to meet Steve and Lily.
As he had been an only child before Tony had adopted him Peter was more than capable of entertaining himself even without internet access beyond what was necessary for schoolwork so he made it through the week of his grounding without feeling too bored.
“Get out.” Tony hissed his breathing growing louder as his agitation grew until he was screaming, “Get out, get out, GET OUT!”
Clint was happy to be filmed practising his archery at the range. He enjoyed showing off his skill and answered all of the hosts questions on the bows he used, the type of arrows he used for each shot, how he judged distance and wind speed to get the perfect shot, and from what range he could fire from.
Vision stares ahead, through the driver and into some other sacred place of his own. “I can sense Wanda.”
“Would you like to know the news?” Vision interrupts and Tony lets a soft chuckle escape before—uff, alright, yeah, that was the ache he was warned about.
of all people, Steve was left a little flushed and embarrassed—well, more than usual. He had claimed that he would be the one to decide who Tony Stark was and said, in a stern voice, that “Tony kind of reminds me of Howard, but those similarities are the greatest difference between them; it’s like… the more they’re alike, the more they aren’t” and that was when he had stopped talking.
hiding something from me. But, because I am also a tired human being and there is still a lot to do, I will
“—and you don’t ask them any questions. Got it?” The young man fishes out some baby wipes from under the hoard of trash. He hands then to Natasha who takes the hint and starts wiping herself down. Its no shower but it would have to do. “I heard from some of the people that dropped by that the rumor is it started behind a Dairy Queen that got swallowed completely—or destroyed, some of ‘em were hazy on that. Electric blue, they said. Like a cool eruption of lava that stopped for a few minutes, enough for some more folks to leave the area, and then moved for a quick minute before stopping completely.” They get out of the car, Natasha tying the oversized shirt into a balled up knot to the left of her hip to look more natural and feeling fresher than she had in days.
“Look,” Tony starts, and Rhodey breathes in softly at the tone, “I’m not saying we all made good choices, because we didn’t—”
A hand, small and frail and so very gentle, runs through his hair. Tony doesn’t open his eyes, tries to keep the flow of good memories running through his mind.
“And I do not do well in health, young Stark.” The voice replies, teasing. “I bring you to my lands, the land of my offerings, in hope that you will understand at last. My all-seeing eyes have seen the future, but they have also seen the past. Will you stand up to Madness and Death? Or shall the world perish in quake and fire?”
Jarvis is going through as many video feeds as metaphysically possible, looking for hide or hair of Enchantress. Hopefully Amora will pop up before the end of the night or, if nothing, Tony manages to finish his project.
He’s watching, and breathing heavily, and he can hear Bucky’s voice in the back of his mind full of disappointment
He’s most likely dreaming, trapped in his subconscious’ nightmares and Steve has known Tony long enough to understand the hellish visions that are probably plaguing the genius.
“Alright, Jarvis, let’s pay a visit to this psychic and then lock up the suit, I’m going to try to go civilian and get some information. You have the address for the psych and the last known-image of where Amora was, right?”
Tony’s head still aches, though the throbbing in his temples has changed into something almost familiar, almost telling. He should feel surprised that it has taken almost a whole day of being captured to start to feel even an inkling of dread and that ell-tale dizziness of an other-worldly presence try to enter his mind, submerge him in the murky waters of unconsciousness.
“I have to make sure you actually listen this time.” Steve sounds like he’s only half-joking. “C’mon, we should get going.”
—she had already slipped two of her last twenty-dollar bills into the center cup holder of his car, one of the only things more often cleared out in the mess of the car.
And Fury can see it all. Can see where it went wrong, that Natasha had to know something that only Steve would know, and he had known, and... something happened, then, something with the death of Howard and Maria Stark thrown in the mix. And then violence, a fight. Something Natasha tried to warn Tony about and—
The silence returns. Wanda, mind blank, forehead pinched, tries to focus beyond the throbbing of her head. Sam has turned around, and Clint, although looking bothered, has a considering tilt to his head, to the slant of his mouth.
“That doesn’t--” Steve tries but his face is scrunching up as he loses the lucidity of the response. “Why are you doing this?”
you power, because we both know that you are no match for me,” Loki grins, hand smoking as he removes the leather strap holding Thor’s head up. The god falls, a heavy, dead weight on Loki’s side but he quickly deposits him against the wall, eyes never leaving Enchantress’ eyes. “Come, then, show this
But there's that familiar voice that's soothing him even in his sleep, a warm, calloused hand that's flat on his forehead, cooling his fever with their heat and shoving those fears and memories and haunting with only his tone and touch. He cracks an eye open and it's like the past only modern: Howard as he would look in this day and age but it's not him, not Howard Stark, but a close resemblance even when Steve thinks there's no resemblance at all.
“Where, then?” Sam asks, finally looking to his left to meet Scott’s gaze. Wanda murmurs something in her fitful rest and her eyes move rapidly even in sleep.
“OH, yeah!” Peter squeaks, “It was crazy! He was giving me signals and everything, telling me when to move and I think that for a moment he even covered me with an illusion, It was all bang! Bang! Crash! ‘I will never forgive you’, ‘I am bound but not really’ and It was really weird but okay in a way…” Peter continued his senseless babble while Tony tuned him out.
Tony tries to say something, anything, but the only words that slip past his defenses are intelligible, quite possibly keyboard-smash jargon.
He’s riding shotgun to someone running his body. It kind of reminds him of the whole Loki incident, the way Clint explained seeing everything and not being able to move. Each hit and each swing was painful and he couldn’t stop. He couldn’t do a damn thing.
There’s a murmur of assent as Peter joins Natasha in the helicopter; Thor nods and gets ready to leave as Steve turns to Tony.
The car ride to whatever undisclosed location throws him a bit, too. With the Compound under official renovations and falling more into UN territory than Stark's own, Fury busies himself with what may be afoot, and thinking ahead about what is to come.
“What does the name have to do with anything, man—” Sam starts, rolling his eyes and shaking his head at Clint who returns the gesture with a shrug.
“What this left me with,” Ross says, a little more somber after Rhodey’s comment, “is someone technologically advanced that could leave a message and remain incognito from government surveillance and review. Cards on the table, everything leads back here,” Ross taps his knuckles against the table, “more specifically to Stark. Aiding and abetting criminals in Siberia is one thing, once it is
“What you do is not only foolish and frivolous but will lead to damages and consequences unforeseen and unparalleled,” Loki forewarns, “the Tesseract is already highly volatile, by breaking apart some of its components you are removing the equilibrium of the universe itself! Stop, Amora, before your own tenacious avarice and childish obsession destroys this world and all those we must protect!”
“A mother soothes her child; a brother foes wild. Who can save the world but the one that destroys it?” She smiles gently now, eyes glowing violet. “The hero is not one who fights, but one who doesn’t submit.”
Had there simply been... enough of the man present in the workings that the UN—127 countries, too now, simply not noticed the physical absence?
Closing his eyes, Tony pitches himself forward and feels his lips press harshly against Steve’s unresponsive, slightly parted lips. He fixes the kiss, moves back a scant half inch and relieves the pressure to a soft brush, a gentle kiss that says more than Tony could ever say in a lifetime.
Tony doesn’t say anything as he approaches, much to Rhodey’s displeasure, and still doesn’t speak as he maneuver’s the other man to sit on a bench a few feet behind where he was standing.
“I am flying blind here,” the voice says with a hint of mirth, “but I am not here to access secrets of the princess of Wakanda. I have… something for you.”
Tony should have known better than to expect anything, really. This was just another testament to everything that led him here, biting his tongue while Ross paints a tragic picture with his hands, with his righteousness.
“I don’t know what the hell you’re thinking,” Steve growls as he shifts his attention to the chains and the metal clasp on the floor, “but I sure as hell am
“He’d been working on a new suit before this whole mess. God knows Rhodey—” Pepper’s voice cracks, “—he and I thought it would be a good time to step back. Maybe stay in the politics, if he really had to, because he has his own health to think about, his own people… it’s what’s keeping him alive.”
years working with her,” Clint said, pinching between his brows, “and now you think you know everything about Nat? If its safer for her to stay inside, she will stay inside those goddamn walls. Natasha wouldn’t take extraneous risks, especially if T’Challa tells them that she
"I wasn't exactly given a full debrief as she was on her way out. She did hint that Stark's life may have been in some kind of danger from Ross and alluded to some kind of blackmail or the likes that the man could be holding against Stark to make him complacent. I do admit that, although it would be hard to stick something serious on the man, there is quite a lot that
in Siberia. He had expected Zemo to tell the entire sordid story. Preach it from his cell, proclaim it all to the world.
“What was she doing that she can’t do now… that is causing this.” Sam finishes and sighs as he leans forward, bends his arms on his knees and slumps his head onto his palms.
“My Brother had his hand in such a misdeed!” Thor booms, startling Tony. Tony tilts his head back and gets an upside-down image of Thor, who sort of looks like he’s smiling but it’s probably a frown.
“She told me you would come, and that the Valkyrie Sveid was a sign.” Missouri looks up into Tony’s eyes, so incredibly sad. Tony swallows thickly.
“Tony, now’s not the time to start acting like a dame, we’ve all seen you without a shirt, and missing much, much more.” Steve growls. “The damn thing she tossed at you melted the armor like plastic, take. The damn. Shirt.
“What… what was it you dreamt?” Steve asks, staring at the jet’s inner paneling. “It can’t be too much of a coincidence that you… see Vision warning you and we get contact.”
“What’s wrong?” Hank asks, not one to beat around the bush. Patience, he thinks to himself, is overrated. Hope is watching the split screen monitors as if waiting for something, like she knows something I going to pop up and scare them at any given moment.
He accepts her strange apology in a wave of sensation. Something’s odd. She wants to show him something, he can feel it, like a slight tugging at the back of his mind.
But no one answers and Tony laughs morosely at himself and shakes his head. Steve doesn't realize that his hand had been moving and that lines and curves have formed a person, how light scratches of black became hatching and cross hatching of the shadows of the man that Isn't-but-
Tony’s a little glad that he chose to wear just regular jeans and an old Led Zeppelin t-shirt when he starts to blend into the surprisingly crowded street. He scruffs against the rubble-strewn road with the front of one of his Chuck’s, kicking away some smaller chunks of loose gravel. There are people just milling about on the main street, murmuring to each other while others rush by in something akin to fear. Tony grimaces and walks up the steps of the Victorian style wooden home.
“Spiderman!” Tony shouts as Peter kicks off the ceiling and lands precariously on his hind legs, hunched forward. He’s up to the first isle already, hand splayed open and ready to fire just in case. “Back-up is on the way; they should be arriving momentarily.” He asserts and Peter nods; lack of names should be prominent by now, judging by what Loki had said.
“Alright, alright,” Rhodey concedes, “you don’t get to say things like that while looking like hell and expect me not to cave, man, that’s just not right. I call emotional blackmail on that one but because you look so—”
Natasha watches the news play with muted words in the corner of a diner in Huntsville, Texas. The subtitles tell her it is the end of a press briefing of Stark Industries, the ticker reading something about Pepper Pots, CEO of Stark Industries Continuing Commitment to one thing or another. She has bleached her hair and cut it into a slanted bob-cut, swapped her clothes for tattered cargo pants and an olive tank top. With a backpack and a few days’ worth of grime on her, she looks like any other backpacker on the road.
When Rhodey is gone and Tony has moved to take his seat on the bench, he doesn’t speak, had only said goodbye when the two left a few minutes before. Tony simply went back to his workshop, sat on the bench and stared at his hands with Rhodey’s words ghosting over him.
“This isn’t perhaps as urgent as unsettling,” Vision begins, “but I believe I know where the Rogue Avengers are.”
“I get that you want to understand what’s going on, why St-Rogers chose he path he did.” Rhodey taps on Tony’s forehead, getting the other man’s attention. Tony puts down the small metal bits in his hands and looks up at Rhodey from his crouch between his legs. “But you flew a nuke into space because you knew It was the only way. You went out alone and destroyed all those weapons Stane was selling under the table. Understand this,
“It was a dream,” Scott replies. Steve huffs, still leaning forward. “I mean, do you have prophetic dreams?”
"Oh, dear. Mother leader of Æsir will not be happy nor pleased.” The young maiden’s pink lips purse into something akin to a frown, her glowing, light skin dulls momentarily. “Her powers are fading, the words are seized; a darkness grows upon your realm; the anger that grows will overwhelm. Whose name do you pray with each breath? Who will miss you most in death?" Those eyes shift slightly into a pure, wretched blue that steals Tony’s breath.
“Lights, please?” Steve asks and, shit, he’s so breathless Tony wants to laugh, wants an award or something but then the lights are coming on.
Fury watches the steady rise and fall of Tony’s chest. Lets the sounds of machines around them fill in the silence, and understands, once more, why it is called ‘life support’.
“S-Steve--” Tony gasps and his back arches, the fire in his body growing hotter. He knows he won’t last, can’t, isn’t fighting it for a second but Steve is pressing his fingers against Tony’s hips, forcing him down and Tony feels his whole body shuddering with the strength in the hands denying him is pleasure.
“Your Iron Man is in the second room; be wary, Amora is most adept at traps and snares. When you enter, forgo the first room with my brother. I will unbind him from Amora’s entrapment. You will go for your comrade and leave both Thor and Enchantress to me.” Loki doesn’t turn from the building, intense emerald gaze focused on the rotting wood. His Midgardian clothing looks almost uncomfortable for such a mission, tight black slacks, a black coat and green scarf; in almost a blink the clothes are melting, distorting until the Asgardian is dressed in golden metal armor, in his traditional battle garb.
“Yeah? Nah, actually, I think I’ll find him in a bit. Just keep an eye on him, please? Make sure he doesn’t go through another episode. I know it’s been a while but…” Steve trails off.
“Your watch will be ready upstairs,” Tony finally says, “I’ll make sure Vision takes it to the hangar to you. I suggest giving your legs a break for now and taking the wheel chair for at least a few hours.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, tired already, “wouldn’t want to glitch out in the middle of dinner and suddenly bust out a gauntlet or something. I think I’m past the age where
He was Tony. Beneath his armor he’s a billionaire, playboy philanthropist and beneath that he’s hard wires, long nights, gallons of coffee, secret whispers to DUM-E, loud music, greasy band shirts and his own strange brand of compassion-sympathy and humanity hidden beneath the nuts and bolts, hidden behind the white-blue glow of the arc reactor.
Jarvis, in fact, was created with the only specified instructions to help Tony. There wasn’t much else written into the program that would tell of its specific utilitarian purpose. The programming would state, in layman terms: “This A.I is hereby given free evolutionary reign so long as it fulfills its purpose and can branch out, be snarky and, hell, get its own set of characteristics, like a personality—this program is limitless only to its official objective”.
“That’s right,” Ross straightens up, begins to pat down his jacket. “Appeasement, of sorts, I suppose, although it seems like nothing will stave off the strictest regulations except—”
“Ah, here you all are. The signals are still being scrambled so we couldn’t find you, looked around for a bit; we’re ready for you outside. Two wounded, correct?” The S.H.I.E.L.D. operative looks at the small group and shrugs. “There’s a medic in the ‘copter, let’s move out; Director Fury wants you all in his office ASAP,” he breaths and the team is amazed at how much the young man can spill out in a single breath. There’s terse silence as the Peter and Thor shuffle towards the exit of the Auditorium; Natasha quickly leaps and stalks out the door without a sound and Steve gets off of Tony, spares a glance at the once again hidden and guarded expression and sighs.
"Perhaps you should have kept your agent for more than a SparkNotes summary." Pepper criticizes. "And learn to train your agents in some kind of cryptic-speak. Is there an international Spy-Lingo?" She pauses. "Maybe throw in some psychology in there, the Behavioral Sciences are really moving government agencies and law enforcement forward into the future."
“It seemed like fortuitous timing that we noted the Quinjet was once again flying from her perch,” T’Challa says, “Nakia is a member of our esteemed River Tribe and the Head of the Social Outreach Department.” Nakia nods at T’Challa as he speaks, the shell necklace on her neck rustling slightly.
Tony knows this can go wrong in numerous ways. They’re each-other’s weakness, Achilles’ heel, just another target amongst the targets stacked on their backs. From a logical perspective they’ve just basically endangered the other even more.
Loki whispers, gaze steady on Tony’s profile. “There is no stopping this. He’s been marked, he’s been chosen. Tony Stark knows what he has to do.” Loki tears his gaze away to look at Steve, an inkling of sympathy in those understanding green eyes.
Tony watches, in awe and fear, as the portal flickers for a split second; arms raise and hands splay, further apart than before, fingers stiff as the opening bends and warps with depleting power. The air crackles as the energy spikes and ebbs. The portal shrinks marginally; the stars fade away into endless space.
Things, they make sense now. Somehow, Tony knows exactly what’s going to happen, like dominoes lined up and ready to topple; he needs a few more days to tick off the first one and
“This appeasement,” Vision begins, “does this mean that this so-called registration will be off the table, so to speak?”
So far, in his search for the madwoman and the power to end the world, he has found brief mentions of the
Steve simply stood there, the need to chase after Tony beaten by the need to know just what was going on. He closes his eyes, turns towards the screens and takes a deep breath.
Natasha chastises herself, looking back down at her plate. The pancakes had lost all of their appeal three minutes before. She had to focus, though: a mission. Something to do, she needed a goal.
“I dunno, I remember… I was looking at some schematics for-for uhh… shit, I don’t even remember and then I got… dizzy-ish?” Tony looked contemplatively at Steve, as if looking for agreement, before continuing, “well, I must have collapsed and fell off the workbench and then you woke me up and here we are. Oh, man. My head is
and finally used his liquefied muscles to hold himself up, moving away from the warmth and support of Steve’s hard body. “I’m fine, though, really.”
It didn’t feel like a predator out-waiting their prey. It looked like someone... trying to find the time. The perfect time.
"So, Miss Potts, where is Stark?" He was going to follow with a snarky remark when, quite unexpectedly, Pepper responded.
The link, it’s a two way street. Tony keeps his eyes closed, thinks with all his might, tries to picture himself sending his thoughts across, and pleads.
“And Viz, he… he turned to me. Like I had just been standing at the other end of the table, and he looked at me and said ‘our hands are tied, now. You must go’ and he… like time unfroze. He looked right at Stark and told Ross that we were in Sokovia.”
for what seems like the longest while. His eyes dart to each smile, each hand gesture and most critically, where ever they
the kind of uproar people are throwing at things like ‘law enforcement harassing civilians’ much less retired, old men, so if you could kindly—” But Hope isn’t looking for a response as she slams the door shut on the man’s face. Still, as per the job, the man doesn’t immediately remove himself from their newly-grown porch.
"I understand that Stark returned to the United States sans Rogers or his friend. I also know, however, that Ross didn't arrest him even after breaking the Accords to go get them—odd, considering Ross's penchant for punishment and blackmail. Then, changes and amendments started getting pushed through, miraculously, though Stark himself didn't deliver them personally they seem to have stemmed from the man himself."
“I have the video footage of last night from the time you entered at eighteen-oh-four up to when Captain Rogers woke you at ten thirty-eight this morning. Would you like me to sift through, frame by frame for any strange occurrences?”
of being asked about Scott-goddamn-idiot-too-dumb-for-his-own-good-Lang, about bullshit like the Sokovia Accords, and if he has to hear the last name Stark one more time, on top of the most recent four AM move—
“It’s nice to think that you’d do the same but you’re just tricking yourself into thinking that, Tones. You’d call Pepper to lead the charge on official channels. You’d have FRIDAY scouring the entire technological world. You would go and personally investigate any leads. Happy probably wouldn’t let anyone out of his sight and would demand for check ins.
“No, automatic pilot to P-Parker’s signal, it’s the weakest right now so he’s fighting some pretty big interference. Open communication line with S-Rogers.” Tony directs, launching off in the direction of Peter’s already weak signal.  A dozen more commands appear before his eyes until there’s the clear sound of a battle underway and harsh breathing.
“Wanda, no one knows we’re here,” Scott says, handing her another bottle. This time Wanda pours some into her cupped palm and splashes on her face before drinking more. Her skin feels grimy with sweat, but her head.
“So, pretty much, I’ll get my answers when this is all done and over with, huh?” Tony looks at the bitten apple, demanding answers with a sharp glare. The maiden’s tittering laughter flows with the whispering promise of the wind. The lands all fade off into obscurity. Tony feels like he’s falling and then—
“Yeah,” Tony whispers hoarsely, letting his eyes drift closed, allowing Steve to press him back into the bed. Steve pulls out tenderly, watching Tony’s features for any pain or discomfort but Tony’s eyes remain firmly shut. Steve sighs, curls his body towards the nightstand and fetches the shirt that he had placed there last night in favor of sleeping shirtless.
, Fury thinks, trying to absorb all the information he can as quickly as possible. He doesn't understand how the edifice—and the people living in the building, for sure—don't look... different. Perhaps some stealthy tech on the windows, make it look like all the other apartments despite the darkening by the plastic, and still.
He looks at the silver-plated watch in his pocket (not the old pocket watch, worn and so full of unhappy memories with each tick of the hands) and hauls it out of the small pouch by the black bands.
He meets her eyes over the hood of his mid-90’s car. With an exaggerated gesture of ‘my eyes are on you’ he loudly whispers, “no questions!”
“Yes, Scott Lang,” the voice responds with a touch of humor, “I am god, but you may simply call me T’Challa.”
The air is still and chilly; the temperatures never quite rise above scorching and never dip down to
Tony’s slightly changed—he’s in sweatpants, the easiest thing to put on without having Vision dress him, and a large sweater. The skin around the new arc reactor is more sensitive than before, or maybe it's just from the time without one that Tony can’t remember if it always felt like that.
If he can manage to get Thor to Asgard while he finds and pin-points Enchantress’ location he can be sure of Thor’s safety and get what he needs. It’s a win-win.
“Then maybe someone else from Asgard?” Steve tries. “Give me a second and we’ll regroup, Black Widow? Get to the main street. Thor, I’m in your near vicinity. Ironman, are you close to our spots? Have you met up with Spiderman yet?” Steve says in his most authoritative tone, the sound of him running somewhat louder than before.
“Tengo collares, cenizas enbotellados, y rosarios hechos todos del cometa, todo lo que se necesita pa’ mantener alejado el mal! Desde’l cielo y al infierno, nada te tocará!” An old woman with a tall black cart says, going up to the first table where the family responds to her in low Spanish. Natasha freezes in front of the counter,
There’s an explosion of light from the other side of the debris, and Steve struggles, tries to find a way to get through but Loki is grabbing his arm, dragging him out.
, bites and still-forming hickeys littering his neck, scratch marks against his shoulders and biceps. Tony groans and feels himself twitch, licks his lips at the canvas of flesh before him.
"You know, Rogers, there's a lot out there that's changed. But there's still a lot that's the same, really." Tony says offhandedly the next morning. "You just have to know where to look." It's one of those rare moments where they aren't fighting, and even rarer is that no one else is around. Steve is honestly and completely surprised and he turns to look at Tony, in some jeans and a faded "Judas Priest" shirt, sunglasses and a bowl of Fruit Loops.
The skies are lit with fire in the darkness of the night, a fiery scarlet like a streak of blood smeared across the onyx abyss. There’s a faint veil of gray there, like smoke, or maybe… maybe it’s the haunted and mourning specters of the innocents that have perished thus far into this ailing nation and they’re there, crying in the night, looking for a brief respite or just hoping to be exercised, looking for a way to be saved after it was too late.
People, Tony muses angrily, taking deep breaths, don’t tend to think in the long term, do they? Don’t try to think about the people left in their wake. He doesn’t remember Hank Pym very well, tries to remember the last time he was in a room with the senior and can only picture his daughter Hope. Hope, who’d only repeated ‘no comment’ the first few days Tony had been able to keep himself running despite everything.
The building Jarvis indicates is vacant, empty. All that remains are the smeared remains of a chalk outline on the far wall of the abandoned office. Tony’s fingers skip along the brown smudges, each contour and cut of color against the eggshell paint. The lines all came together at the base of the floor and rose to the ceiling and across, like swirling branches of color.
question. Aaron thanked her for her interview and the woman asked once more if he would let her know if he found out anything that would help her get her daughter.
“Do you have any hope for the people that may have gotten stuck in there”, Aaron asked, iPhone recording between himself and the tear-stained face of the older woman. She shook her head even as she said yes, that her daughter had been mid-shift and would have been in the Dairy Queen that was first over taken.
Tony closes his eyes, imagines Steve laid out before him, feels those strong fingers carding through his hair so gently, hears that husky voice whisper, “am I stupid for still wanting to try? For still loving you?”
