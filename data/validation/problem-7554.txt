"You're willing to be questioned by the Black Widow," said Maria.
Steve watched as Tony fell asleep. The alpha twitched nervously in his sleep. Tony's expression became fearful. Steve purred, running his fingers through Tony's hair. It wasn't enough to stop the oncoming nightmare. Tony struggled against him. He was afraid if he let go, the alpha may hurt himself.
Piper got up from her desk; going to the easel Rune was glued to his seat. He likely thought this some kind of test and it likely was. Only one person knew the answer to it.
“Have you ever heard the saying ‘don’t look a gift horse in the mouth’?” asked Lena, a little heatedly. Piper shook her head. “It means to find fault in a gift that has been given to you. Don’t be ungrateful, Piper.”
“And what does that matter?” said Peggy.
“That’s wonderful Steve. No nightmares?” said Barny.
“Okay,” she said.
*****
"Tony stays with me," he said.
“Boyfriend?”
“You’re failing utterly at distracting me,” she said.
“A lesser work,” said Tony.
“Yes, I’ll make sure he gets to his destination safely,” said Jarvis.
"How about something simple? Toast may be," said Tony.
“Captain,”
“Why would I know that?” Rumlow asked dismissively.
"It's something to look forward to," said Steve.
“You have to.”
"Like I said before it’s a biological imperative. Stress can't deny your body's deepest desire. You want a pup more than anything. That biologically primal urge doesn't care that it isn't Piper. It’s only following your demands; it wants something to cradle in its arms and nurture,” Edith explained gently.
“It looks so natural for you,” said Tony.
She failed in so many ways. How could she not have noticed until now?! Not only had she failed herself. But worse than that, she’d failed her friends. That was unforgivable. She couldn’t let that stand. Her arm shot up, grabbing the rod as it moved to strike her again.
“One day I will teach you the dance of Asgard,” said Thor.
“I guess it went well,” said Tony.
“Maybe I can reverse engineer it from this. If I figure out the right parts, maybe I can track down his location or least get us one step closer.”
“I pulled some strings with the Smithsonian. The frame is extremely durable, and in case anything happens to it, I’ve made copies,”
Piper sighed. Unlike everyone else here, Winter was the only one who never intentionally hid something from her. There was something wrong with him that made him so limited in what he was free to do. He was sick.
“What era is this based on?” asked Steve.
"I was tired."
“Shh, it will be okay," Tony hushed.
“Hey, Nat?"
He could ask her the same question. It wouldn't surprise if him she'd been waiting up for him. She'd made her intentions clear.
"Don't you want to see, Daddy?"
“Where will go next time?"
He pulled away from his alpha. Steve took his shield from Natasha. She followed him to the bedroom. She took a seat on the closet bench.
“You won’t be disappointed. If you follow me, we can begin.”
*****
"A week after your honeymoon probably sooner," said Pepper.
She nodded.
“I’m done,” she said.
“Perfectly healthy.”
Steve shot from bed. Outside staff was already were getting the yard ready for the wedding.
He hated the word affair. It made what they shared sound dirty.
“It’s not that I don’t trust you, doc, I'm wary,” said Steve.
The nearest suit landed next Tony, opening for him.
“Like you controlled the cube,” said Steve.
Tony soared through air speeding toward the plane. Toward his mate and unborn pup.
She moved the wand over his lower stomach.
Steve respected Pepper. She was a nice omega. By all reason, he should like her. The bridge to friendship was denied by his inner omega. She was a rival. It was a petty dislike. He'd be polite. Her calls were always ill-timed. He pulled away from.
“Don’t think I could even if I tried. You can though,” said Steve.
"I made you a promise. It will be here soon. It's a bit of a junker, so we'll have to build it from the ground up."
“As always, sir, it’s a great pleasure watching you work,” said Jarvis.
He smiled when he saw a box of jellybeans. They'd always been his favorite candy. There was another knock on the door.
"Promise me," demanded Steve. He didn't want Tony going back on his word.
“Jen?”
“So sure? What if I give you a name?”
The light turned on as they walked in. It was filled with cardboard boxes and plastic containers.
His sensors locked on the missile, speeding toward the city.
"Sure."
"What's up, honeybunny?” asked Tony.
*****
“Bru.”
He went to the door.
“Let's get you cleaned up. Jarvis, get the bath ready," said Steve, picking her up.
“You did good.” Many recruits didn’t last more than five minutes against him in a fight.
"My metabolism requires me to more than most humans. Even more so now that I'm eating for two," he said.
“We’re looking into this.”
“Go ahead, Pipes.” She rushed outside. “Is she out, Jarvis?”
“Can you get someone to treat him properly? I’m not sure if I did it right,” said Piper.
"What changed?" asked Steve.
“I don’t need anything fancy,” said Steve. He never wanted to be a dolled up omega, always flaunting the expensive gifts their alpha lavished upon them.
“An iPad, Lena gave it to me. It has lots of interesting things on it." Winter glared warily at the object. "Her giving this to me means nothing. It doesn't change my level of trust with her. It's just something to do. Do you want to look?"
“Hey, beautiful. You’ve gotten yourself into some trouble." He was relieved to see those blue eyes. The fear vanished from Steve’s expression and his heart rate calmed. "Sleep," he commanded, lacing as much alpha authority into the single word.
“I wasn’t done yet,” she said.
“You only ask me for this information a few days ago. And it's a very exclusive social circle."
He sighed. “Piper wants you to question her physiatrist. That’s the only way she’ll talk to him.”
He nodded.
“I can’t protect you out there!” said Tony.
“Steve, has you on diaper duty?”
“And these will work on me?” he asked.
Rune sat on the playground swing, swaying back and forth. He’d been waiting for Piper for three hours. He smiled when he finally saw her, but it faded when he caught her scent. She climbed up the rock wall to one of the many fenced perches and he followed her.
“Go,” said Pepper.
“The surgery was a success,” said Wu.
Pepper let herself into the room. She was greeted by Steve puking into a trashcan. Pepper quickly shut the door. No one outside of this room could see Steve like this. It would bring up too many questions. Ones that weren’t ready to answer yet.
“Be gentle don’t get water in her nose,” said Christina nudge him into the shower.
“What’s he doing on this?” said Natasha.
She reached toward the studio doors. Ah. That's where she thought he was. Steve would lock himself in his studio for hours when he was having a bad. Tony thought Piper would put that together. He sighed, pushing open the doors to the studio. Piper looked around. The confusion was so clear in her expression. She started whimpering.
“Daddy.”
“Come on, it’s breakfast time,” said Steve.
“Don’t cry, sweetheart." This only caused a new flood of tears. He couldn’t smell the distress but Steve was nearing it. Steve's gaze was glassy. Tony tensed he’d seen this before.
“It’s wrong again.”
“I found this.”
“So it predictable?”
“No, you don’t get to
Banner was uneasy with his surroundings. They were high in the sky and things could go terribly if he were pressed too far. He kept an eye on Steve. Staying close to the briefly familiar was easier to focus on. Out of all the people here, Steve’s intentions were the clearest.
“Not that the Jesus look doesn’t work for you.”
“Hello, Piper.”
“You’re a realistic girl. So I’m going to show you just how much the odds are against you.”
"You coming to bed?" he asked.
January 18, 2016
"Yeah, that glare that makes everyone run away from you."
"Okay."
“You were watching?” said Steve.
“Are you sure, sir? That’s a breach of Captain Rogers’ privacy,” said Jarvis.
He traced over the message, sure it was written by his own hand.
He listened to the classic rock station Tony had on. Five minutes later Tony came back. He carried a small evergreen wreath with a white ribbon winding through it. Tony placed it on his lap.
“I put you through so much,” said Steve.
“Dari?”
“I need to get something. I won’t be long,”
"I'll be there," said Edith.
“We’ll try this again later.”
“Are you sure?”
“Help me up."
Natasha stood in a S.H.I.E.L.D black site interrogation room. She had been called in to take over a particularly difficult interrogation. They’d been looking for this man since the Cold War. An old man with thinning white hair and pale gray eyes stared back at her.
Steve sighed. “Just a long day."
"I look forward to getting to know the person behind the shield," said Tony. He wanted to see if there was a flaw in that golden boy persona.
A fireman trudged toward her. She reached out to him. He picked her up, putting a respirator over her mouth. It didn’t smell right. Her struggled faltered as she fell to the influence of the gas.
“Get to a computer. I just sent an audio file. Listen to it,” Nat said.
“I’ve waited seventy years for you to ask me,” she said.
“Don’t get used to it. Steve is only with us temporarily,” said Tony.
“You may be more stubborn than that alpha of your,” said Killian.
Steve reached out for Tony.
He pushed a finger in. A tight wet heat surrounded the digit. Slowly he stretched Steve open. He watched the lustful expressions cross Steve’s face. Steve’s started making short mewling sounds. The omega flexed around his fingers trying to take them deeper. Each one was more beautiful than the other as Steve grew more wanting.
Steve was a month along when he lost his first pup.
“Sure, he could. He’s a genius.”
Tony flipped them, pinning his omega underneath him. He gave in to his instinct claim, setting a brutal place, only slowly when the felt his omega contracting around him. He sunk his teeth into Steve’s neck right as they reached the release. Tony collapsed onto Steve. He slowly came out of the haze.
"Of course. Do you want me to run a background check on the candidates?" said Jarvis.
“I’m fine.”
“You’ve broken a finger. I’ll have to reset it.”
“I'm trained to treat adults, not children, Piper," said Barny.
“Do you have something to say?”
“Yes, sir.”
Steve popped off the wooden lid. He smiling when he saw rusted falling apart 1942 Harley Davidson WLA.
Not long into the flight, Steve began squirming in his seat. It was impossible to find a comfortable position. He pulled uncomfortably at the collar of his shirt.
“Can you even get drunk, Cap?” she asked.
“Piper.”
“I’m so happy you’re here. I was going to… never mind.”
“You were exactly what Tony was looking for,” said Natasha.
“It doesn’t matter,” said Piper.
There was something chemical to the omega's scent combining unpleasantly with his natural honey vanilla aroma. All that was thickly buried under the stench of distress. As he dug further into the omega's scent he caught a whiff of an alpha. It was barely enough to pick up on. The omega heart was hammering. He was scared. Yet outwardly he was almost perfectly calm. The taste of salt lingered in the air from the omega's tears. The man's clothes lacked the specific rustle of winter clothing. His footsteps were too soft they lacked the weight of a rubber sole. The warmth in the air surrounding the omega ran higher than most, but he couldn’t pick up on the scent of heat. He was unaffected by the cold. Matt caught the irony scent of blood but couldn’t pick up a fresh source from the omega. How did he get here? He hadn’t heard him come up from the stairs, elevator, or fire escape. The only reason he’d come up here was heard a thud. Had the omega jumped from another rooftop? That was maybe a twenty-foot gap. Every instinct told him to protect this man.
“I’m not asking for her to face them. We only need a few pictures she to prove she's back,” said Pepper.
“I’ll retrieve her shortly. You’ll be watching the interaction on the monitor until I deem it safe for you to enter the room next door.”
“I’ll go get the doctor,” said Maria. Rune nervously glanced toward her. “I’ll be right back, Rune.”
Steve was unable to focus on his surroundings. The anxiety was unshakable. At least he was out of that memory. He was able to latch onto the deep rumbling purr of the alpha beside. It blocked out the sound of his racing heart. He reached toward the source of the sound, coiling around the warm form. Deeply breathing in that comforting scent.
“Most alphas have become more well-manner. There are still staunch traditionalists who believe omegas are meant to be barefoot and pregnant, but their numbers are shrinking,” said Barny.
She nodded. Lunch arrived. Winter brought the tray toward them, placing it the middle of the cell. Piper stumbled over, unable to walk a straight line, before sitting across from him.
Steve nodded. "How would you feel about me working again?"
“You may not enjoy that,” said Bruce.
“Tony,” he whimpered.
“Do you think you’ll have a better chance of getting through to her?” Steve asked, a little aggressively.
Tony went back to the penthouse. He played with Piper on the floor hoping to distract her from her hunger. Tony placed a new toy in front of her. She was completely uninterested. Her gaze was focused on the elevator. Tony sighed.
"Keep this between the two of us. I value my privacy. I don’t want something that was meant to be a private moment exposed,” said Steve.
“No.”
“I don’t judge my car Lola is one precious possession,” said Phil.
"Fury, may come to visit. I’ve held him off as long as I could.”
“What?”
“Probably have to figure out how to tell the public about me being found,” said Piper.
Steve snarled, throwing his phone against the wall.
Tony jumped in his seat when someone touched his shoulder.
“He can’t make us do anything. He knows that and isn’t trying to trick us into thinking otherwise,” said Piper.
“Want to try again?” asked Tony.
“He’s my mate. I know,” he said.
“Have ever felt anything similar to it?” asked Lena.
“I don’t know.”
"No."
“Then who gave them to you.”
"Omega." His voice was soothing, melting his fears.
Tony winced when Peggy slapped him on the back of the head.
“Why haven’t they come after me yet?” asked Steve.
The two were never far from each other rest of the day. Cuddling helped build reassurance. Steve fell asleep earlier than usual. Tony fingers twitched. He went into the bedroom and got into bed. Tony closed his eyes trying to sleep. He tossed and turned in bed, waking up Steve.
“Shh.”
The last four days had gone relatively smoothly. Piper and Rune were near inseparable at times. It reminded Steve so much of himself and Bucky. Tony was right; he seemed to have made strides toward regaining Piper’s trust. But not Steve. She was wary of Steve.
“May I suggest you hydrate before returning,” he said.
He went to the alpha's lab. Tony's red eyes were trained on the computer. He was watching it again. Steve sighed. He'd lost count of how many times they'd watched. At this point, he couldn't take watching it again. It made him feel sick, stirred the potent guilt within him. He leaned over his alpha's shoulders and turned off the monitor.
“It will be over soon enough,” said Tony.
“I’m fine, Tony. I promise."
The man's head was bowed. His gaze focused on his pup. There was such confliction to him. Prideful and joyful at the birth of his first child, but worried and fearful of the fate of his mate.
“I love you, Steve.” The omega's reaction was perfect. A light pink blush spread across his cheeks and a gentle smile appeared.
“I told you to take it easy."
“Winter!”
"Sorry, caught in a thought. You two are in better shape than I thought you'd be,” he said.
He took the ring from his pocket.
“You wrote nothing in your report, Turner,” said Fury.
Steve took his breath.
A nesting couch is a luxury. And the giant pregnancy pillows he saw looked amazing. He wished he had those things for his first pregnancy. It would have made things more comfortable for him.
"Maybe," he sighed. Steve expected a clever come back. The offer was tempting, but he had to report to S.H.I.E.L.D. He hated the confinement of it. There were things he wanted to do free of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s watch. Visiting Peggy for one. He owed her that. The sooner he got it done, the better.
“Power at 400% capacity,” said Jarvis.
The omega caught him in a kiss, nearly pulling him into the bunk. Tony pulled away.
Thor growled, breaking eye contact with his brother.
“I thought you couldn’t hypnotize someone into doing something they don’t want to do,” questioned Pierce.
"Good." He settled back against Tony.
“No,” said Steve.
“What do you want to do with the rest of our day?”
"We don't have to hide anymore."
"Why didn't they put him down?"
"I like peppy," said Steve.
“Will that help?” asked Maria.
Steve raised his shield as Natasha pointed her scavenged weapon at him. She swiftly lowered it. They both took a moment to catch their breath.
“Alright. How’s the water?”
“By how much?” asked Steve.
"It does. Why?"
"We were doing a simple breathing exercise, and it triggered her," said Bloom.
"Whoever it has to have a spine of steel. But be non-threatening enough for her to believe she can get the upper hand both mentally and physically. Piper will use any perceived weaknesses against them.”
“It was great. I'll to do it again,” said Steve.
“We will,” she said.
“Fine, it’s an honor to meet. I'm not sure what's more of a surprise. You moving in or you being Captain America," said Happy.
“Thank you, Barny.”
Steve remembered the mess he’d walked into which hadn’t had the chance to fully absorb until now. The penthouse was a mess.
said Rhodes.
“Where are you going?”
"Good, he hasn't come up has he."
Tony snarled. “Careful.”
Steve pulled away from him, placing a gentle kiss on his forehead. Tony touched on a darker subject that needed to be addressed.
"Jarvis, pull up a photo, an arctic landscape."
His alpha lay on his side by him, his fingers slowly moving up and down his stomach. Instinctively spreading his legs further. A whimper escaped. Jolting when the alpha's hand was on him, tracing him slowly through the thin fabric.
Lena sighed. The girl's stubbornness was one of her more bothersome attributes.
Tony tensed.
"A little longer," sniffled Steve.
“Just in case,” said Tony.
"Is this real?"
Pepper sighed.“Is he okay?”
“There are eighty-three museums in the five boroughs,” said Jarvis.
“I won’t,” he said. However, pleasant the idea of bondage with Captain America was. It was a stressor for Steve.
“You could still fly out with me to Georgia,” said Tony.
“Were you with her?” asked Steve gently.
Steve noticed a box on the kitchen counter.
Steve ripples around him, wetting their stomach with seed. He shouts jerking his hips. His knot pushes through the slight resistance. Pleasure found them again as their teeth sunk into each other's neck, reclaiming each other. Tony collapsed on top of his mate. Steve blinks his eyes, his lashes clumped.
“He’s wary, Fury. Writing anything down would shatter the timid trust I built with him,” he said.
"Yes, Sir.:
“Ready to go?” he asked.
*****
“Keep, that fire Piper. It will only be used against you.”
“It’s okay,”
“I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job I’m watching Pepper."
“Dr. Star, how is he?” asked Fury.
Rune twitched when he heard Pepper's car pulling into the driveway. He quickly put his plate in the dishwasher. "May I go, Uncle Tony?"
He nodded. Steve’s scent revealed how deeply he wanted him. Tony's hands snuck underneath the omega's shirt, pulling it off.
“I’m good like that,” said ponytail.
“It’s handled there’s no reason to worry your pretty little head about.”
“I don’t wanna be you." She bit her lip, realizing how she sounded. "I didn't mean it like that."
Steve sat in their kitchen, spinning the empty mug across the counter. So little was accomplished today. Like yesterday and months before that. The unproductive weight bearing on his shoulders kept growing. He wanted to do something instead of sitting on his ass. At least Tony had the lab. What did he have besides Captain America and Piper?! Art, maybe? Tony seemed to have so much more outside of being Ironman.
Steve nodded.
The drive home was too quick. They sat in the tower of the garage for several minutes. Steve grabbed Tony's blood pressure medicine from the back seat. It was a temporary prescription. He shook a pill from the bottle and offered it to Tony.
“Will you met with her doctor?” asked Steve.
“Fine,” said Rhodes.
Fury nodded silently. “You don’t know the half of it."
Maybe she would have something to help him with his cramping. He went to the office. Edith smiled up at him.
“One more big push, Steve.” He gave it one more big push.
"What will you do?"
“I’ve asked some, what you smelled like-
“How about that,” he said.
“There’s some news about you,” said Edith.
Tony hung up. They'd been dating nearly a month. He hadn’t grown tired of Steve. The two were polar opposites; they should be at each other’s throats.
Steve nodded. Peggy always knew of the mutual pinning between Steve and Howard. She had Steve’s heart, but not his lust. She thought of asking Howard once the war was over if he’d be a donor for Steve once they settled down and married. That was a dream from long ago.
"Steve, all I can tell you is I'm sorry."
“A helicopter and a private jet,” said Tony.
“Now,” said Natasha.
“You have a good face.”
The mention of his father completely ruined whatever mood they had.
“I can’t tell you,” he said.
“Ready to go?” asked Clint.
“I don’t feel so good.”
“How can I help, sir?”
If Jarvis knew, Tony would k. That was actually a bit of a relief.
“How long will I be Grant Walters?” he asked.
They settled down on a table, earning suspicious looks from some. Zemo didn’t seem bothered by it. Carl started chatting away.
“The alphas who say that are the most clueless,” he said.
Winter woke from the first peaceful sleep he could ever remember having. He was laid out on his side, pup tucked against his chest. His arm held her close.
“Load her. I’ll handle the boy.”
"No trouble at all." Steve took a look in the pantry, finding several boxes of Kraft Mac and Cheese. “Jarvis is this safe for me to eat?” asked Steve.
Steve slept in till noon. It had been a peaceful sleep. The only benefit of his heat was it allowed him to sleep. He groaned when he felt a small wet spot under him. It was getting worse. Steve showered, hoping it would lessen the scent of his slick. He dressed and went to lunch. Steve tensing when he felt every alpha’s eyes on him. As soon as he finished eating he returned to the safety of his room. There was a knock on his door.
“Fine, nurse get him some scrubs,” said Blackwell.
“As much as I love these I prefer you bare,” said Tony.
*****
“I’ll have Happy pull up with your things,” said Tony.
“My therapist says it will help with my PTSD,” said Steve.
Tony shrugged.
Steve backed away. The metal man was unknown to him. All he could smell was metal and blood.
“I'm sure."
"I don't think she'll leave the property," said Steve. But that didn't make things much easier. It was a massive piece of land.
“You speak of control yet you cause chaos,” boomed Thor’s voice over the others.
“Blue Steel.”
“I thought that-
*****
“Of course, when?"
“We’ll start once finished your meal,” said Phil.
“I can’t leave without you.”
“Yes.”
“I’ll have to talk to him about it,” said Tony.
“That obvious?” said Steve. He couldn't deny. If he did, Natasha would know he was lying.
Did he really have to dignify that with an answer?! Of course, he had to because Tony would take it as a personal victory if he didn’t. Why did Tony have to be like this?!
“I am a camera,” said Jarvis.
She yanked her hands away.
“What parts?”
She was trying to absorb the information given to her. This would be the story of a lifetime if anyone were to get wind of it. Captain America still alive was one thing. Another thing was him being with the notorious playboy. The hero that embodied virtue with the one that embodied pride, arrogance, and indulgence. The headlines were already flashing before her mind. At some point, while she in thought, Tony snuck out of the room.
“Alright,” said Edith.
"Thank you."
Steve took a seat on the couch.
He followed her to the gun range. The trainees scattered as soon as she entered.
“You could be more involved,” she said.
They walked hand in hand to the elevator. It took them to the penthouse.
Dr. George Wong waited outside his office for the Black Widow. A sleek black car pulled forward. Its black tinted windows rolled down.
“I know.” Tony sighed.
Winter woke first. How long had he been out? A curtain separated him from the pup. He easily broke the restraints on his arms; something he'd never done before. They were in a locked recovery room. His injuries had hardly been attended to and he ached badly, but his pain was not a priority.
“Okay, that wasn’t mine to give away. That belongs to my friend’s sister. And that’s why I’m going to kill you first,” said Tony.
“It’s alright. Can’t say I haven’t been tempted. The urge has been stronger than ever. But, I can’t do that to you.”
The flight back was delayed by an hour. By the time the reached the training facility, it was twelve in the morning a new day. He rushed to his room, not even bothering to change out of his tactical gear. Steve grabbed his phone there were no messages or missed calls from Tony. He called him. The phone rang.
“He was lonely,” she said.
"Me, no. Captain Rogers, you are. You are a hero to the omega community. Without you, I and millions of other omegas may not have rights and opportunities we have today."
"What war were you in son?"
“You’ve said that before,” said Tony.
Tony relaxed his offspring was safe. It was upsetting that Steve had fought in such a condition. How did he not put it together? It all seemed so apparent now. Steve couldn't have kept this to himself.
“Please, Steve I’m so sorry."
“Steve.” This time he got a response. Steve met his gaze, but he still wasn’t there. “Can I touch you?”
“There’s a bathroom over there,” she said.
Tony put his hand over Steve's stomach.
Tony cupped the panicked omega’s hand in his face. “Look at me!”
"You can't expect me not to. Jarvis showed me what happened."
“Don’t talk about him. Don’t talk about either of them. I don’t wanna talk about them!”
Piper shoved him off. “I was tired of being treated then less than nothing! Aren’t you?”
"Jarvis, what is it?"
Winter's brow scrunched trying to figure out the right words. The task grew in difficulty when she started crying. What he was saying clearly wasn't working.
Steve nodded, refocusing his attention on the punching bag.
“Forty days I can make that,” said Tony. His head fell back into the pillow. That included Christmas. He still needed to get a present for Steve. Going overboard wouldn’t work with Steve.
He sighed, hating how she was right. Especially about something as intimate as this.
“I’ll decide that for myself,” she said. Natasha grabbed her bag from the locker. “Call him."
Tony yanked it from Rhodes’ hand, ripping open the box. Tony pulled a bubble wrapped package out. A note was taped to it.
“I can get the muzzle off, but you have to promise to not hurt me. Do you understand?”
“Well, I look I got to change it every time you hack in, Tony.”
She pressed against the bars, trying to get a better look, but it was impossible to get a good look.
“Let’s keep them occupied,” said Tony.
There was so much more at risk. He has a pup and mate to protect. She took two large packets of paper from her suitcase.
"But-
Tony clung to the edge but was forced to let go when the piano came rolling toward him. A blast from his gauntlet sent it crashing into one of the helicopters. “That’s one.”
He didn't know his name. How was that possible? How could anyone not their own name? What had they done to them?
"And you think you can bring him back."
*****
“Right away, sir."
*****
Distress leaked from underneath the door into the hallway, so Natasha picked the lock and let herself in. The unbridled scent of distress sent her reeling back. Taking a deep breath through her mouth, she steadied and pushed forward, shutting the door quietly behind her. No one else needed to see this. Steve was curled up on the bathroom floor, shivering. It was wrong seeing him in such a state. She'd seen many a broken man, but this was different. There was hope for repair.
“It won’t always be easy, but I’m comfortable with him. I’m not running into this blind. I’ll be careful,” said Steve.
"You did," he said, ruffling her hair.
“No,” whimpered Piper.
“Why the hell should I take orders from you?” he asked.
“What is it?” he asked.
Steve nodded but stayed silent. It was best not to feed into it. Doing that would only egg Rumlow on. He got into the jet, taking a seat next Natasha. It was a long flight to Egypt. Their target was hidden in the Mount Sinia mountain range. It was supposed to be a place of peace.
“Don’t mock me!” growled Piper.
He answered his phone. Tony hadn't given up. The alpha was kissing his neck.
“I’m sorry.”
A sudden wave of panic spread over him. The crayon snapped. He covered his face trying to work through the building panic.
*****
"Then he's alive. That means I can find him. I can still keep my promise," said Piper. She smiled.
“You’re blackmailing me,” said Steve.
“You’re lying.”
Tony rolled his eyes.
“Where’s Steve?” asked Rhodes.
*****
"Been getting more of that now than before.”
Tony held his mate close as the pleasure of his release spread through him. Slowly releasing his hold. Tony licked his refreshed claim. He shallowly thrust into his omega, earning a soft tired purr. When his knot went down he moved from Steve. He lay next to his mate, running his fingers through Steve's hair.
Low growls echoed through the forest.
“I can give Mrs. Potts a redacted version of the requested documents,” said Jarvis.
“He wasn’t the natural parental type, but he learned. Maria tried making up for it, but a boy needs his father. He tried so hard to get Howard’s attention creating such amazing things when that failed he started acting out, which gained Howard’s attention for a moment. Eventually, he just ignored it,” she said.
*****
He shook his head. “Pup.”
Steve schooled his expression. There was no questioning the sincerity in Tony’s voice. His heart was racing. Tony loves him! The alpha only said because he thought him asleep. Those weren’t words the alpha said lightly. Would he ever say them aloud to him though? How could he sleep now? It was such a thrill. He nuzzled against Tony’s neck. Tony purr lulling him to sleep. Steve woke hours later. Tony was working on a virtual screen. His free arm was wrapped around him. The bruising on Tony’s chest and neck faded greatly since he’d fallen asleep. He smiled brightly.
“Give me your hands.”
Steve woke late the next morning. His mind caught in the dense haze between awake and asleep. There was no rush to wake up.
“He’s not here.”
Natasha let herself in. She seemed to have the same idea, bringing three bottles of wine. She poured each of them a glass.
“How long do you have to wear the brace?” asked Steve.
"We have little data on the reaction. I don't know how hot she'll run. Or if that's a side effect we have to worry about," said Bruce.
“Hey, sweetheart,” murmured Tony.
“Maybe another time,” said Steve.
“Oh, I just thought,” said Steve.
Winter listen to sniffling sounds of the pup crying. He gritted his teeth doing his best to block it out. Eventually, it stopped. He sat up, checking – okay, she’d only fallen asleep. Her cheeks were still wet with tears. She was shivering. Winter dragged the mattress toward her, pausing - not sure how to pick her up. He nudged her onto the mattress, pulling the blanket over her.
"You must stop staring at me like that."
"And I thought I broke my toe," said Winter.
“They’ll need time to adjust. But soon they’ll have to talk with someone,” said Tony.
“Is that all, sir?” Lena asked.
“You’re the neighbor,” he said.
Tony picked her up and placed her on her blanket in front of a pile of blocks. He put a bottle in the warmer and Jarvis turned on the news. The toys seemed to catch her interest while Tony waited for the warmer to bing. He tested it against his wrist. When he tried taking her from her toy she cried.
She remained still. He pulled a syringe from his pocket and stuck her with the needle. Still no response; she was out. Jeff sighed. Safe for the moment. He wiped the blood from her forehead.
"Would you be asking me to spy on them if the alpha wasn’t, Stark?”
“I don’t want to get their hopes, or mine, up until I’m sure,” said Natasha.
"Thank you, what's next?" asked Steve.
“Bye Tony."
“I’m afraid I don’t understand,” she said with a timid shrug of her shoulders.
“You have no idea what you’re doing to me,” said Tony, running his fingers through Steve’s damp hair.
“Tony?”
“How’d you’d sleep?” asked Tony.
“Read, we'll be here for a while."
Tony nodded.
Tony winced. Piper clutched him as she cried. Crying wasn't the right word for it more howling wail, revealing the true extent of what she'd endured. He wasn't sure how long deafening sob went on for. Steve couldn't help. Every time he drew near Piper’s screaming rejuvenated.
He had never experienced it personally, but he had witnessed it.
"Must have gone out of business," said Steve.
"By who?"
Rune peaked timidly, from the fluffy warm jacket in which he was wrapped, to look at the beta. She'd nearly thrown herself off the jet to save him. He didn't want to let that kind of person go. When he asked Piper what parents were, she’d told him,
“We’re finished for today, Piper.”
"How would you feel if you were forced to stay at home with Piper?"
“All of it.”
“I’ll go to my room,” said Steve.
They fell into comfortable ease. The two lay comfortably on the couch. Tony was bathed in Steve’s wonderful scent. The omega was sandwiched between him and the couch. He played with Steve’s necklace. Every now, his fingers ‘accidentally’ ran over Steve’s scent gland, causing the omega to sigh and shudder. Steve met their lips in a brief kiss. Tony cradled the omega’s face keeping, him from breaking in the kiss. He let Steve pull away, smiling. Tony ran his thumb over his cheek. They kissed a few more times as the movie continued. Steve fell asleep around twelve. Tony gently nudged the omega awake.
He woke to five men charging at him. Gunfire made him go rigid. Where was Tony?! He shifted seamlessly into attack mode. A collar shot around his neck, depleting him of his strength. He yelped, crying out for his alpha. The sudden loss of strength was terrifying. A blur of red and gold streaked across his vision.
“Sedate him!”
That smile. There was something to it. She imagined him with longer hair and a sullen expression. The image it brought forth made her drop the photo. Its glass cracked. It had to be an eerie coincidence. Bucky would be older than Papa. It was only a coincidence. Bucky fell off a cliff no normal human could survive such a fall. There was no other way to make sense of it.
Rumlow followed the medical, keeping a close eye on the doctor who had threatened him.
The doctors found no signs of abuse. Tony would have felt more relief if he didn't know Piper's healing factor. The boy likely had similar abilities. He looked at Piper's hand. There was still blood under her fingernails. Her palms were callused. Bruce was already on his way.
“I didn’t think you’d be awake,” greeted Tony.
The test tubes had a timed seal lock.
“Well, here we are on the roof.”
Steve jolted. Tony was hobbling one foot, the other bleeding.
Steve pushed the alpha into his nest. “Before that sleep.”
“Nothing, could keep me away,” said Lena.
“Papa,”
Tony smiled.
“Alpha."
"You need to see this," said Tony.
“Jarvis?”
“I’m sorry for what I said, Tony. I was hurt."
"What Jarvis?" Tony asked.
The smell of his distress flooded the room. Edith hit the vent button airing out the room. Thankfully, the walls were scent proof and soundproof.
“Sleepy?” asked Tony.
“Of course, I’m jealous!! But I know what it will do to you!” Tony took a breath, forcing himself to calm down. Yelling at his mate wasn’t getting him anywhere. “Why does he want to talk to one of us now? He’s been in S.H.I.E.L.D’s custody for days now?”
“Papa! Daddy! I’m here!” she screamed. It was an instinctual cry. Fueled purely by a child's urge to cry out for their parents when they were scared. Why, what was the point of calling for them? She didn’t know why she did. It was all instinct nothing more. Her heart ached. The cry cementing the idea of their rejection. It was too much! She screamed.
“Permanently?”
“There you are." He could finally relax, but he didn’t dare move.
“How many alphas have you been with?” asked Tony. There was a sudden spike of distress in Steve.
"No, idea. He erased his identity there may not be one," said Steve.
“Not my type,” he said. All the pinups were pretty beta women and male or female omegas. He shook the thought from his mind, his attention returning to the bike. “And now Doris is in a museum."
“How can you be so calm?!”
“Steve.”
“Yes.”
Steve’s expression softened. “Just having you home helps me.”
“Are you sure? You’ve never visited before,” said Happy.
“Nice to meet you,” said Steve.
“You’re safe," he whispered.
“Why did you tell me?” asked Steve.
“Once! I’ve been there for you every time! Every time I want comfort from you’ve been gone.”
He strode into the kitchen. The aroma of stew filled the room. They hadn't enjoyed it last night so Jarvis put it on a low simmer. The longer it simmered, the softer and more flavorful the meat would be.
Tony took a breath, forcing back the anger.
Steve went to the first guest bedroom he found. It had little decoration. The room was clean. Proving the alpha wasn't much for long term company. He crawled into bed, but it was too soft. Steve dragged the blankets from the bed, spreading them out on the floor.
“What’s that?” asked Winter.
“I can’t take that,” he said.
“Please be okay, Winter.”
“This isn’t stupid, Steve,” he said before placing a gentle kiss on Steve’s cheek. Steve smiled.
Piper blinked she remembered. The first time she entered that state she had no memory of what happened. Never was it this clear. She was gaining some semblance of control over it. Piper hadn’t done anything to learn how to control that power. It could have been an outlying incident. Even if it was an outlier it's existing leaned toward her gaining control.
*****
Tony carefully lifted Piper's legs, tucking the diaper underneath her. He quickly fastened the tabs.
“Why didn’t you tell us!” hissed Tony.
“You should be happy he wasn’t the one that got you,” said Natasha.
', but this time the bigger dog won. Tony sighed. He didn’t blame Steve. Grief was sickening. No, the blame laid in the people who’d taken their daughter. He took another breath before entering Steve's room and was surprised to find the omega eating.
“You could have gotten yourself killed,” he said, exasperated. The pup obviously had
“Tony, I know what you’re thinking, but we have to help the president. Steve would want that,” said Rhodes.
Joseph Louis Barrow, best known as Joe Louis was an American professional boxer who competed from 1934 to 1951. He reigned as the world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949 and is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time.
“One of the ones you keep hidden in your room and refuse to let anyone see?” asked Natasha.
"No, you go ahead," he said.
“Beyond that, we have to figure out her triggers. If we don't, it could be disastrous," said Bruce.
“I’m not leaving!” growled Steve.
"That’s normal.”
He purred as Tony's hands wandered his form, never traveling uncomfortably low. The alpha's touch effortlessly drawing out his purr. He was timider in exploration, running his hands down the alpha's form, keeping his touches to alpha's upper chest and back. His mind grew hazy from the heavy scenting. A particular loud gunshot triggered Steve. He rolled off the couch, shielding Tony underneath him.
“Daddy.”
A feeling of unease swept over Steve. Something was wrong.
"Well, you heard him, Piper. It’s time for you to get up."
“Honey?” said Steve.
“Steve, you’re still psychologically omega. It will work,” said Edith.
“Stop him on this floor,” said Tony. He did Fury in his home.
There was an explosion. The team was sent in different directions. Large parts of the ship fell away. Tony was looming over him shielding him, holding him close.
Steve's sweet exterior was worn away from the show. What remained was tired and moody. It was clear he was done for the day. Their bond did little in helping Tony navigate his mate during this time. Steve's state was in flux. He ran his fingers through his mate’s hair easing him into sleep. When they pulled into the tower garage, he almost did want to wake him. He gently nudged Steve awake.
“Where to, boss?” asked Happy.
"Start with the cake tasting at Fantasy Frosting. Jarvis has already put it in your calendar," said Pepper.
parent. Are you?”
“Steve, look at me.”
She raised her head, focusing in on his voice.
“Sweetheart.”
“I don’t want to be like that again.” Piper shook her head.
The nurse was likely placed there to keep an eye on him. He wanted space. Steve closed and locked the door to his room. He curled up in a tight ball in. Tears wetted his skin. He screamed into his pillow until his voice went hoarse. He was too wired to attempt sleeping.
“Have you had sex with outside of heat?” she asked.
“Call Banner," said Tony. After several attempts Banner finally picked up his phone.
Natasha spotted Rune watching them. Maria and Pepper gushed about the boy and were not put off by his abilities. Even though the boy caught his room on fire several times. He picked up the subtle similarities between the boy and Thor. Natasha put Piper down.
Winter was left in seclusion, something he’d once enjoyed. But he'd adjusted to the pup's sounds, and the new silence was grating. Her condition was unknown. All he was sure of was that she was alive.
“What about the purchase on the dark web?” asked Rhodes.
"It's okay, baby girl."
Piper quickly opened it. It was loaded with educational apps. She soon discovered it was only a simple touch screen, though. It had no further functions than to collect her answers and send them off somewhere. There was no Internet access. What would she do if it did have more functions? She could make nothing useful out of its parts.
“Go brush your teeth.”
“Of what?” asked Tony.
Steve rolled his eyes. How could he expect a mutated bear attack?
“Take them off before I tear them off,” warned Steve.
They plan landed at the nearest S.H.I.E.L.D. agency. Tony picked up his mate. Hill along with a group of agents were waiting for them on the airstrip with a stretcher.
“Dinner, it's my turn to cook," said Steve.
Winter rushed to her side. He pressed his ear against her chest and was relieved to hear the steady sound of her heartbeat. He cradled her in his arms.
“I can only imagine,” said Steve.
Clint’s arrows bounced off the harmlessly off the bears’ pelts. Natasha’s electronic blasts only agitated them. Their efforts weren’t useless. The beasts’ movements slowed considerably. The smaller bears cried and ran from Natasha and Clint toward the larger one. They nuzzled against it, whining and crying as if hoping to wake it.
It was a quick motion that could easily be missed in a blink. Steve nodded.
"So there's someone walking around with latent Asgardian DNA,” said Tony.
Tony unfolded the scrape of paper.
Rune and Piper were lying in the grass, enjoying the sun against their skin. She’d never take it for granted again. Her ears perked up when a car came down the driveway. They climbed up the playground to get a better look at just who was coming. The driver’s car gave nothing away about who the person was. It was some kind of Hyundai.
Piper was happily wiggling to the song.
“Stay.”
“Couldn’t cook if her life depended on it,” said Tony.
"Shut up."
“Press down gently on the edge. The reactor will emerge then turn it and it will come out,” said Tony.
"Yes."
Steve sighed. The risk was minimal. He could easily leave whenever he wanted. If he stayed out any longer he risked drawing attention to himself.
Steve quickly jotted down a list and handed it to him. He grabbed his Mark 5 suit. The suit melded to him.
“Back off Tony!”
“How can you expect to refuse?”
Tony caught him in a kiss, his arm locked around Steve’s waist. His armor fell away breaking the boundary between them. He pressed closer to Steve, wanting to get rid of his distress. Their foreheads touched. Their gazes locked. Again they meet in a gentle kiss, which grew in its passion. His hands wandered memorizing the feel of Steve’s form. Steve broke their kiss, baring his neck. Tony brought his nose against it, deeply breathing in his scent. That honey vanilla scent took over his senses. He never wanted to part from it. Tony lapped Steve’s neck savoring the taste and the shivering reaction it caused in his omega.
Bruce returned to the guest bedroom. The appointment could wait until tomorrow. He did not want to test Steve in a potentially moody state.
"Two cheeseburgers with extra pickles, large fries, and two strawberry milkshakes."
“Losing this. I’ve lost so much,” said Steve, tightening his hold on the alpha.
“Apparently, you share a deeper connection with Captain Rogers than you previously thought."
“Yes, I’ll move in with you,” he said.
“Hey, hot wing want to party just you and me. Let’s go.”
Winter snarled, flashing his teeth.
Steve's feet tapped nervously. He told Tony he'd be back as soon as he could. And he tried. He did all he could do to get them out of there as fast as possible.
It was perfect timing, too. Pierce would be visiting soon. Lena double-checked Piper’s restraints, before returning to her office to study the newly gathered data.
“Howard," said Steve.
“Really?”
“Me too.”
Tony squeezed his hand.
Tony ran his finger through his mate's hair. He purred Steve huddled against his chest.
“So, is that a yes?”
“What do you want?” he asked. Rhodes tossed a newspaper at him. There was a front of him flying through the skies as Ironman. It was titled:
Tony brushed away the hologram, focusing on the center of his attention. Steve turned, kissing him. The omega’s skin smelled of the pine soap that the gym used. It didn't mix well with Steve's natural scent. Tony’s scent markers had been washed off. Steve ran his fingers over the reactor in the man's chest, the metal cool under his fingers.
“No, he’s an alien,” said Piper. That got a real smile out of Winter. It brought a usual but pleasant warmth to his expression. “Where were you during the Battle of New York?”
“How did you explain the damage?” he asked.
“Steve.” Tony let the alpha tone flood into his voice.
"If I ever become a danger to her, do what's best, don't spare my feelings."
“No, we could use a little worse,” she said.
Steve growled, getting up from his seat. He didn't want to hear about the war. He'd seen what those rockets could do. Steve pushed the thought from his head. That was the past. He wanted to focus on the present, getting his mate back. There was nothing he could do. He was trapped here. His mate was somewhere and there was nothing he could do to help.
“Really? I thought you’d be a bit hesitant after what we put you through,” said Steve.
“Where else would I be?”
“What was your medium?” asked Tony.
He picked her up, rocking her gently. Her cries turned to soft whimpers. He gently rubbed her back.
“We have to go,” she said.
“Am I interrupting?” she asked.
“A bit longer.”
“You have to hold mine or Daddy’s hand,” said Steve. He needed one of them to have a connection with her.
"A week after your honeymoon. Maybe sooner," said Pepper.
“He’s having a heart attack.”
"Easy."
Pepper left. She didn’t take Steve’s cool behavior personally. Compared to most omegas in this situation, Steve’s behavior toward her was cordial. He wouldn’t warm up to her until he wore Tony’s mark.
“I thought you’d have more respect for books,” said Lena.
The door opened. He pulled into an empty space. Rhodes stopped at the motorcycle in one of the parking spaces. It was painted a deep blue and had brown leather seating. The bike was too modest to be Tony's. So Tony’s omega was into motorcycles and potentially military. Where did he even meet this person? Rhodes went to the penthouse floor. When the doors opened he heard, someone was humming from the kitchen. He dropped everything when he saw who was in the kitchen.
Tony returned to the lab.
“How many agents did I-
Piper watched as Rune’s tension melted away after a few minutes. He began playing with the couple. Piper had never seen Aunt Maria and Aunt Pepper look like that. It hurt. She went to one of the many hideouts in the playground. She wanted Papa and Daddy to look at her like that again. Piper hugged herself. She tried not to cry. It just hurt.
"Mom, what would you do? You put with Howard and me. I don't know how you did it." He took another sip of his drink. "I wish you were here. You'd know what to do."
“Still hanging onto the past. The promotion hasn’t changed that much,” he said.
His little girl was gone. He gripped his phone tightly. Whoever did this was a dead man. He called his mate.
“Ready to go?”
“Do you not like the one you have?” said Tony.
Steve hadn’t thought of taking Tony’s name. He didn’t think he could part with his name. His pup would carry the name Stark not him. He needed the connection to the past it gave him. “I’ll be keeping my name. May I ask you a personal question, Thor?”
Tony scruffed Steve. The omega went limp. Steve was crying. It tore at his heart. He wasn't sure if it was solely caused by the physical pain or the emotion inflicted by using an alpha command. Tony kept Steve scruffed, knowing as soon as he let go the omega would strike.
Fuck, he forgot about Bucky. Chester Phillips dangled the chance to allow Steve to face Zola but was denied that after Bucky's death. And was likely terrified of losing that chance again. But they didn't actually lose their baby. They could survive without this closure. The downfall of letting Steve go through this wasn't worth it.
“Pup.” She met his gaze.
“Guess who has to pick up the pieces, Steve?
“What do you think dark blue and white color the theme?” asked Pepper.
“And the girl?” he asked.
"Is there any good news," said Tony.
"Where's Tony?!"
“And you’re sure you are okay?” he asked.
"Poor thing best let him sleep," she said.
"It shouldn't but it just some stupid thing does. Omegas and alphas are treated differently. Even though they can do the same things, but a lot of times, people will choose an alpha over an omega. And when they do choose the omega they get paid less.”
“Mr. Stark, I’m so sorry,” cried Harley.
The kid tossed the bag at him. He went through the supplies. Harley dropped some clothes next to him.
Happy nodded.
Steve started skimming.
"I can't focus."
“No, I thought pretending may help you.”
“What?”
"I can arrange that once we're finished here," said Phil.
He grabbed it. “Didn’t expect you to call so soon,” he said.
“Lean your head back.” Steve rinsed the shampoo from her hair, careful to not get any in her eyes. When the bubbles died down he interrupted her play, wrapping her in a fluffy towel. She giggled when he dried her hair.
“How is he?” asked Tony.
Steve placed his phone on the bedside table and put on a pair of shorts. He went into the kitchen and took a seat at the island. Tony placed a fruit salad and glass orange juice in front of him. The fruit was fresh and smelled good. It looked good too, but he couldn’t get himself to eat. He poked at it with his fork.
“Foolish man,” she said.
“She’s my favorite bike”, said Steve.
February 13, 2012
"Is there anything to be done for it?"
"I thought you weren't that kind of doctor," said Tony.
Tony appeared on the phone. Steve found himself calming. He held back the phone so Tony could get a better look at him. The alpha relaxed. “I was shot."
(See the end of the chapter for
He quickly woke up. Holding her painfully close to his chest, he searched for a threat.
“An egotistical genius like his father. And a royal pain in my ass,” said Fury.
“No.”
“Whose turn is it to make breakfast?” asked Tony.
“Steve was telling me about his dream," said Natasha.
“Yes, do you wish to see it?” asked Jarvis.
Happy gave a tired smile.
*****
Tony squeezed Steve’s hand. The omega relaxed slightly at the contact. "I'm sorry."
Steve smiled and let her inside. She placed the box on the coffee table.
“Good, wear this one,” said Steve picking one of the jackets.
“You know you should come to Stark Tower sometime. The top ten floors are all R&D you’d love it, its candy land,” said Tony, picking up a tool.
"I thought it was supposed to be sunny," said Rhodes.
“Yes,” said Steve.
Tony's concern melted some of Steve's frustration. “No.”
“Alright, Steve.”
"We'll have to get a car with a backseat and a trunk," said Steve.
“You saw what she did. That was the same glass used to build the Hulk’s cell. She isn’t a child she’s a freak.”
"You can choose which one we take."
“Hey, Nat."
“Why the delay?” asked Natasha.
"You were watching me sleep?"
He got into the car. There was work to be done. He pulled into the nearest hard wear store. The alpha weaved through the aisle, collecting things as he went. Two carts of supplies later he was ready. He checked into a nearby motel and started working. Several hours later he was done.
“Of course,” said Jarvis.
“Mr. Stark, if you can join us for some of those sessions. I believe that will be beneficial for both of you."
“It’s fine,” said Rhodes.
Tony groaned.
“Machines.”
“You can’t expect me not to look," he said.
Piper woke pressed between Theodore’s chest and the glass wall of their cell. Lunch was waiting untouched on the floor. She raised her head.
Winter raised his head. A momentary warm comfort spread through his chest. And when it faded, he shook his head. The crying had started again, only there was no sound now. The humming had stopped when she started sucking her thumb. Their meals continued to follow the same schedule, but their captors made no move to take Piper away.
"I hate it, but trust whenever I do I have you," said Steve.
Winter knew he looked horrible. His face was a mess of green-purple bruises. He'd broken several bones in his face. His nose was crooked and his eyes were blackened. By the throbbing sensation in his side, he'd broken at least four ribs.
“When?”
“I loved seeing that demanding side. I can’t believe you ripped my pants off," said Tony.
"I'm worried that today might be ruined by what Banner has to say," said Steve.
He kissed Tony goodbye and went to the garage. Parked next to Barb was Vivien. She was named after the famed actress Vivien Leigh. The bike was fully transformed from its dilapidated state. It was painted a deep red. Steve wanted black but they flipped a coin over color and Tony got to choose. The bike had many gadgets and Steve barely knew half of them. Apparently, the bike could fly. He’d yet to test it. Tony got the idea from some wizard movie. Steve grabbed his helmet and went in the direction of the S.H.I.E.L.D.
"A little longer."
“I’ll move if you give me one good reason why I should allow you to keep punishing yourself like this.”
Hours later Lena closed the book. Piper huffed she hadn't finished!
“I can, but not on my own. With you and her parents' help believe recovery is well within her grasp.”
"How much longer until he gets here?" she asked.
Stepping Reflex - Even though the baby cannot support his own weight, if his feet are placed on a flat surface, he will begin to step one foot in front of the other. The stepping reflex usually disappears by 2 months.
“Are you sure? I should at least help you clean up,” said Steve.
“You invited danger into our home!”
"Shh, go back to sleep."
“I’m sorry, Nick. What were you saying?” said Tony, flipping the monitor for all to see. Weapon plans.
He hoped this would take some of the weight Steve’s.
“Fine,” he said.
“Ant, boot,” he said gesturing to the so-called god.
She took a sterile syringe from her bag.
“What happened?” he asked.
“Morning,” said Steve grumpily.
“Promise?”
“We’ll throw that one away,” said Tony.
“Thank you, sweetheart,” said Tony
They nodded. There was a flash of a camera. The owner seemed very proud to have served them. Tony went to pay.
“I didn’t ask for your opinion,” said Lena. He growled. “Besides, this is Piper’s choice.”
Several black SUVs pulled into the alley, Agent Hill exiting one of the vehicles before it came to a full stop.
“Give me some good news, man,” he said.
“You’re such jerk,” said Steve.
“Sedated.”
"Let's go check on, Papa."
"Not everyone saw you on that date."
Steve went to his room. He needed a shower. Steve went into the bathroom. The walls of the bathroom black and the counters were white marble. The fixtures were black or steel. One of the walls were glass, so a person could look out on the city from the tub. In the corner was a large glass steam shower.
After his appointment, he wandered the halls of S.H.I.E.L.D. There was a tap on his shoulder. His fist slammed into the wall, leaving a large crater in the cement. Widow barely managed to avoid him.
"I volunteered for this assignment," he said.
He carefully eased out of bed.
*****
“What’s in it for me?” asked Harley.
“Only a few minutes,” answered Jarvis.
Steve returned to his room, giving Clint the space to do whatever he needed. He took a seat on his bed. Steve called Tony.
“Okay.” That was worrying. Steve tried the pump once and hated it.
“No reason to destroy hotel property,” said Tony.
“I ate before I left, but thanks,” he said.
"I doubt she'll talk during the first meeting. If she doesn't like Bloom, we'll try the other doctor," said Steve.
“Of course he did,” said Tony.
"I do," said Steve.
"Don't get too use it, pumpkin. I won't have it much longer."
Steve leaned his head against Tony’s chest, listening to his heartbeat. Steve jolted himself away. Too much touch would only speed up his heat. He slid out of his seat, making space between himself in the alpha. “I’m going back to sleep."
“That great news,” he said. It was one less worry.
“Dogs never had one though. Their fur and dander caused my asthma to act up,” said Steve.
The man's bio appeared before him. It was nothing unusual. Just another well dressed alpha man trying to compete or join his company. Happy’s concern over Pepper triggered his protective instinct. He went to check on Steve, even though he just been with him minutes ago. He went upstairs to check on his mate. Steve had burrowed underneath the blankets. Resting under one of the layers of blankets was Steve’s shield. He slid in next to his mate. The purrs instantly started up again.
“Hey, whenever you want, me, I’m yours,” said Tony.
“Don’t sound so surprised. I’m a man of many talents,” said Tony.
Tony and Steve came clean all that had happened in Antarctica. To his credit, Dr. Wong kept a straight face.
“I’m Piper and you’re one of the Battalion Chiefs,” Piper spoke up enthusiastically.
*****
“Doing what?” asked Trevor.
Bruce ran had through his curled hair. He flipped through the page. “How much of it did you understand?”
He followed Steve open-air bathroom. High wall grantee, no one would see his omega. He joined Steve under the spray.
Steve slowly got off the alpha lap and out of the tub. He wrapped a towel around his waist. The floor was soaked. He’d cracked the tub in his pleasure. First the shower tiles now the tub. Tony got out of the tub.
“It’s a cool room. Jarvis did an excellent job of decorating.”
“I know."
“It wasn’t her fault,” said Tony.
Piper was so lost in her fascination that she’d forgotten it was attached to a person.
"Let her through," said Steve.
"There's a lot more out there nowadays. Learn anything from Howard's notebooks?"
"Don't apologize."
He wasn’t ready or fit to have a pup. He needed more time. Steve took a breath and took the test. He placed on the counter and sunk to the bathroom floor.
He mimicked the motion, flipping over the first card of his deck. It was a five of diamonds.
“You were taken out by a flying ass plate. That isn’t fine,” said Steve.
"Too bad."
"I doubt that," said Steve.
Steve stayed in bed until eight in the morning. He carefully moved the sleeping alpha from his chest, setting his head on a pillow. Steve kissed Tony's temple. He couldn’t take the scent that clung to his clothes. Steve threw them in the hamper. The smell of distress clung to his skin.
Piper sighed. Winter made his want for a change of subject very apparent. And he would not be open to the question again any time soon.
"It was an accident; it happens." Steve could hear her muffled cries. He didn't try to pick her up. "Do you want Daddy or I to give you a bath?"
"How may I help, sir," said the nurse, not looking up to meet him.
He instantly frowned, growing concern.
Steve knew there was a stranger in his den, but what he didn't know was if she were a threat. This woman was encroaching on his mate. It didn’t matter. They were getting out of here and going to New York or to visit Peggy for a few days. He was sick of the helicopters circling around their home. He tossed their bags to the lower floor.
Tony nuzzled Piper as she purred. Steve's fingers tapped nervously against the counter.
Tony grudgingly allowed her in. She turned on the ultrasound machine. A black and white image of his daughter appeared on the screen.
The only pattern he was able to hang onto in life. He had to keep following it. It was all he had. All he knew. The time to complete his task was shortening. He had to start.
A beta nurse with sun-kissed skin came in. “I’m here to take out your staples. And I’ve brought you some clothes." Her hands were shaking. She turned pink when she got a full his chest. The nurse quickly got to work.
“Sleeping,” said Aunt Pepper.
“You know how I feel about surprises,” said Steve.
“Tony?”
Steve pulled out a crochet lovey that shaped liked duck.
“But to answer your question, she’s not your offspring.”
Lena took the key from under the doormat. She dropped her bag by the front door. The entire house was asleep. She went up the steps quietly, careful to avoid the squeaky one, then opened the door to Carl’s room. She kneeled by his bed and tears welled in her eyes, only just now realizing how much she missed her pup.
“If I tell you will you tell me where he is?”
Piper jumped down.
"It isn't only your heat. Though its a fantastic bonus." Tony nuzzled against Steve’s neck. He didn’t know what the hell this was, but he wasn’t going to let it go any time soon, no matter what pain it may cause him in the future.
“No, they had me somewhere else before. But it looked a lot like here. All gray and cement.”
“Good, except for being attacked by angry green Winnie the Poohs,” said Natasha.

Steve bit his lip. “At least, I’m trying. She wouldn’t want this. Please, we’re hurting enough without you doing this.”
“We believe you’re about to be drawn in the Mandarin campaign and we have to get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.”
Hours later she woke him up. Steve groan at being disturbed but opened his eyes.
“Bye,” she said.
“I’m sure she’d be happy to host you,” said Charles.
“It will be a little while longer until I feel anything,” he said.
Piper growled at her.
The ballroom was beautiful. It was clearly designed by Piper’s grandmother. The large was bathed in natural light that streamed through tall arched windows. Hanging from the arched ceiling was a single elegant crystal chandelier. Drops rainbow reflected light spotted the center of the checkered cream and white floor. The walls were painted a delicate cream. Tucked in the corner of the room was a grand piano.
"That doesn't mean I don't want to see your eyes."
She sighed.
Steve took off the lid, revealing a photo of his mother. Tears leaked down his cheeks. “How?”
Tony took his hands off the wheel. They were shaking.

“Sure, what’s good here?” asked Steve.
“Piper, we have to look to make sure you were stable. We have to know if you're healthy," said Tony.
"NO, IT ISN'T!"
“Thank her for her consideration. This is a very thoughtful gesture. And I hope to one day thank her for it in person,” said Steve.
“Did I just witness Captain America’s first attempts at flirting?” said Tony.
"S.H.I.E.L.D. does a masterful cleanup."
Bloodied footprints ruined the pristine layer of snow. Soon enough they would be hidden. He couldn't stop crying. This wasn’t him. He’d never run. This wasn’t a bully or enemy he was running from, but someone he was falling in love with. He hated how he wanted to go back. How wanted Tony to hold him. There was such safety to his embrace. It was as if he belonged there. His inner omega scratched weakly against the confines of his mine, whimpering for them to go back.
“French toast I’ll help,” said Steve.
“The board wanted him. There’s always a glass ceiling,”
“We are staying,” said Tony.
How? How could she do this? It answered why she was here, Winter thought. Strong and intelligent.
“There’s nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out some pigeons though,” said the guard.
Jeri signed. She’d been Stark’s lawyer from the start. Out of all the attorneys of him to pick he chose her fresh from law school. His reasoning was she seemed to have a ruthless edge sharper than most and he couldn't be more right. She handled all his legal needs in New York. Her car stopped in front of the apartment building. She walked from into the apartment building.
“True,” sighed Steve, tilting his head back. He jolted when Tony’s hand slid up his shirt. The alpha turned his head to the side wordlessly asking if he’d done something wrong. “Your hands are cold."
Another deep snore.
"Do you think Piper knows we're still looking for her?"
“I had a mission come up I may not be there for him,” said Steve.
"I was a fool to believe such an organization had been brought down. They found a way to survive," said Steve.
“This isn’t the first time. As soon as I fall asleep, you leave. You can sleep in a tin can but not by your mate.”
“Christ, woman!”
“You’re welcome.”
Killian injected him with the serum. A burning sensation spread through. A fire lit under his skin. Killian put the IV back in his arm. The grabbed his chin.
“Sorry did you say?"
"I don't want to talk about it," he said, hiding his face in the alpha's chest.
“I wanna go home!” she screamed.
“Steve.”
"They aren't," said Tony.
Tony nosed against his neck, scowling when he couldn't pick up Steve's change in scent. There was nothing in the omega's scent to signify he was mated.
“What do you want, Rumlow?” asked Steve.
“I’ll come to fetch my med-bag when things cool down here,” said Edith. "It may only last a day," she added.
