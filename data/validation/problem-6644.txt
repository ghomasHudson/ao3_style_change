"But here we are! You just standing there with your calm, understanding face like I'm not the most despicable person on earth, like it's not my fault that crazy bitch got exactly what she wanted from you. Like I'm not the cowardly piece of shit who was too afraid of telling you how much I loved you when you really needed to hear it most.
“I must be on my way. I am gladdened that you will make a full recovery my friend.” He said to Steve.
“You were so concerned and you went through so much trouble to keep me from over exerting myself.” He said gesturing to the restraints. “I’d hate for you to fail your mission now.” He smirked.
After days of adamantly avoiding Steve, he had the audacity to look Steve in the eye and tell him it was for his own good.  It took everything he had not that pop him one.
Tony had just single-handedly delivered the finishing blow to Steve’s already broken heart. Of all the things he could have said in that moment Tony had uttered the very things that had always plagued and haunted his soul since he could remember. That he would be useless, worthless, expendable and unwanted to those who he cared about most.
A/N: I hope you all aren’t too upset with me over the events that has transpired the last several chapters but some things just needed to happen. Here we have a little bit of Tony’s point of view and perhaps just a little bit of light will be shed on a few things. Or perhaps it’ll inspire even more questions. Without any further ado, on with the show.
"You are incorrigible." She sighed before giving him one last kiss. She stepped back and grabbed her purse. "I'll be back later tonight." She said walking to the door. "You will have to cook dinner for you and Ellie tonight and –"
They had relocated themselves into a small common room where Tony was now destroying everything in sight.  Steve just let him go.  Letting him get it all off of his chest.  Most of his screams and shouts were incoherent.  But from what Steve could make out Tony was profoundly upset about how the simulation went.  There was a lot of garbage about a lot of the little stuff in his life here and there but Steve could make out what was really bothering him.  Tony was doing his best with a lot of pressure on him and it just wasn’t enough.  He kind of knows how that feels.
Night had fallen and the cold was starting to set in. Now that he had settled down between a few wooden crates he had time to really think. His ideas were impulsive and mostly irrational. He ran the last several days over in his mind. He shuddered thinking how close Natasha had been to dissuading him. She probably would have succeeded if he hadn’t received that transmission. He cringed at the thought. He had to get his head in order.
He took another look around and saw an umbrella. He ripped the rubber off and made sure none of the metal components remained on it before swaddling the infant with it.
Instead, he subtly twisted his wrist and flicked his fingers unassumingly altering the settings on his watch armor. By the time Rumlow registered Tony’s movements it was too late. A shockwave him and the other agents away from the door.
But no, Fury and Pepper won’t let him considering all the trouble they had gone through to keep him. Coincidentally, Fury said something about how it was incredibly fishy concerning the soldier’s existence. Considering all his recent targets, there may be a possibility that the infamous Harker may have been a puppet all along. And if so, they had to consider the possibility that SHIELD was compromised.
“Heh, that’s smart, good strategy.” He looked sideways at the siblings worryingly. They looked back equally concerned.
“Wow, Ellie you are incredibly talented.” He said as he began viewing a few landscapes she had pinned to the wall.
“No. Now it’s time to get back to work. Jarvis, resume music.” Tony gestured for the soldier to turn in his seat.
“Mr. Stark and Captain Rogers are of no bother to me. Please allow them to continue.” Xavier stated in absolute authority yet somewhat gently as if talking to a child.
A small child manifested into view and hobbled onto the piano bench next to the woman. Steve realized with a start that the small child was Tony.
“No! Not that, I mean what happened between you two? You and Steve?” She demanded cutting him off. Her face was contorted painfully.
His mind is trying to come to terms with this revelation. Surely Thor must be mistaken. Surely they can overcome. But then again…
“I did Cap! I really did! I did it based on yours and Thor’s intake with a thirty percent error margin.” He said shaking his head.
“Be well Professor, I hope to see you back on my ship soon.”  Fury said as Xavier boarded the X-jet.
“The prisoner still needs a psychological evaluation.” Added official number two. “And Everett Ross still hasn’t had his interrogation, yet. If we let you in, there would be hell to pay.”
“I think I’m going to be overly cliché here and order the prime rib, medium rare, with a loaded baked potato and a beer.”  Tony stated flashing the waiter a grin.
“Not my fault you’re sensitive enough to feel the pulsing electromagnetic waves.” Tony responded ignoring Barnes’s apprehension. “If you want we can stick you in the MRI tube instead.” Tony suggested sinisterly.
“Now, when I attach this to the bone anchor and cybernetics it’s going to hurt like a mother fucker but only at first from the initial contact, after that you should be fine.”
Rumlow charged him again. He was quick and cutthroat. Suddenly, the Strike soldier landed a solid punch to Bucky’s ribs. Our soldier coughed up blood immediately. His damaged lung tearing anew from the impact. He tried to remain evasive. This guy knew his stuff. He hardly felt any openings in his guard. Bucky couldn’t find a clear shot.
Tony looked away ashamed of himself. Steve was one of his most important friends and it took until now to truly understand this very important part of Steve, the pain he must be facing daily.
“Pretty much everyone is on standby until further notice. Fury’s orders. Blah blah blah. I do believe tomorrow bright and early is when we are all going to hold a meeting and see what information Thor had brought for us.”
He knew it from the start that this was Bucky. Of all the times to be right about something. He realized in wretched horror that the only way Bucky could be here now was that he had survived his fall and Steve had left him behind for Zola to find. His whole world had been turned upside down and inside out. It felt like everything till now had been some stupid joke at his own expense. He was wrenched out of his self loathing thoughts by the soldier’s, no, Bucky’s response.
Bucky had also become very acquainted with the local library, borrowing books left and right for Steve to read while he was at school or doing chores. But no matter how many distractions Bucky managed to provide he knew the one thing Steve wanted desperately was to just go outside and be free. Free to run around and just soak up the sun and get dirty.
"I broke out." He said as he wiped his face. His voice was laced with all the undulating emotions he was feeling up to this point.
“Aww, I’m fine, Babydoll.” He smiled and ran his hand through her curls. She giggled and looked up at him adoringly. He felt immediate relief from their interaction. He held on to her the rest of the way back to the farmhouse.
“Wait, wait, wait!” Clint interceded. He turned to Barnes. “How do you know the hologram is Yggdrasil?”
Steve spoke this time, “Yes that is why this case is so troubling. They are in fact perfectly healthy.”
By the time Steve had finished the dishes and had successfully gotten Ellie on the school bus, he had completely forgotten about the odd dreams with the mysterious man in the flying suit of armor. He made his way around the property, taking note of the things that he would need to get to eventually, like mowing the lawn, trimming the hedges, and cleaning up other yard debris fallen from the trees.
With the tiniest bit of solace, he promised himself that he was going to spend the rest of whatever time he had left helping where he could. Just because Calamity is taking over the world doesn’t mean the other villains are going to stop making a racket and hurting people. He would stop them while he could. No one was going to stop him from doing that, not even Tony.
The plan seemed to be working swimmingly until it wasn’t. After Steve, with the help of the Thing, manage to usher a few civilians they found out of the perimeter zone a new wave of puff balls emerged out of a factory to the west.
“My Dear, I do wish I could say that I choose randomly but alas everything is not without a purpose. I do not wish to give you too much information, I do have goals to meet after all. However I will give you this. I choose worlds that, yes, are indeed plagued by war, violence, chaos, and true evil in of itself. However, I also choose worlds in which all these horrors were brought about by a significant influence from an infinity stone. And as it happens your tiny planet that you call Earth has been tainted and influenced by three of the six. I could not have asked for a better circumstance.” She replied giddily.
“My friends, though my people have ways to evacuate a planet, the task of that magnitude does not come without profound risks and extreme consequences. As such laws have been put into place that if the conditions are met we could perform such a task.
“HE’S INNOCENT!!” He screamed again in desperation the electric noose was once again wound around Bucky’s neck and they managed to keep him pinned on his knees. The Soldier stopped struggling.
Now Steve was really crying, this time however, they were tears of utter joy. He cradled her small convulsing form close to his own shaking body. The other children cheered, Johnny let them go and they swarmed Steve and Becka.
“I want the flyers in the sky. Take out as many as possible look for clusters and find the source. Torch, keep a perimeter don’t let them spread any further.”
“Yeah, let him in.”  Steve turned in the stool he was seated in to face the doorway.  Charles wheeled himself in slowly admiring the various works, finished and unfinished, distributed throughout the studio.
“But in order to achieve this, I need to leave my mark and collect souls from each and every realm.” She said matter of factly.
“Yeah, Babydoll, the armor was doing some very fascinating things in my dreams last night. I had to get it down.”
Then the Rhododendron started to laugh ominous laugh. "It's fine. It's fine. It's fine." He muttered in a mantra.
The ominous tone in his voice was the only warning Ellie got before Steve began to gently poke at her sides. Her delighted squeals of laughter widened the smile on his face so much that it hurt. After a moment, he finally let up.
After what felt like hours, though was probably only mere minutes, Barnes finished the last sequence of the algorithm. He sighed heavily and looked up at Tony. Tony, however, was studying the algorithm with frightening intensity.
Steve took a deep calming breath. It had been three months since the closure of their last biggest mission, the Calamity case. He and Tony barely had any time to spend together while cleaning up the aftermath of the battle with Calamity.
It took everything in Clint’s willpower not to roll his eyes instead he took a deep breath and replied.
That was her primary job in this case, to find the woman.  But Tony took that from her. She knows deep down that she is overreacting and that she should expect Tony capable of such things. But she just can’t get over it. She had searched all of these media avenues before and came up with zilch.  But Tony came in and researched them and found the woman despite her efforts.  She wasn’t necessarily angry with Tony she was more angry with herself and the situation.  She cannot understand how she had managed to miss what was clearly right in front of her.
At the time he couldn’t figure out why that desire was so strong and so prominent, but he had always chalked it up to being overly concerned and wanting to give comfort.
“This is it!” Tony wailed in relief. “It’s rendering! This is it!” Hot tears sprang to his eyes and his team cheered and cried behind him.
“I don’t know I just started drawing and this is what came out.”  He retorted a little annoyed with Tony’s attitude about the subject. The crazy genius then walked off to fiddle with his phone.
“Sorry, Mama.” She replied looking perfectly chastised. Then she turned to Steve. “Are you coming Daddy?”
Tony sighed heavily. That was the whole god damn purpose of this entire fiasco. The very thing Tony spent the last two days trying to figure out.
It wasn’t until almost an entire week after the Fuzz Buzz incident did Steve finely get a reprieve from the constant stifling and anxious atmosphere that seemed to follow him around while he was in the presence of everybody else.  And it came in the form of Johnny Storm of all people.
The very top floors of the tower belonged to Tony. He wondered how that was going to work. Speak of the devil, Tony was standing in the doorway in a fancy suit and everything.
“Fan-friggin-tastic!!” Tony exclaimed with the howl before sinking into the sofa with a long-suffering sigh.
He kinda felt sorry for Fury. It wasn’t entirely the Directors fault, he felt. If only he had realized sooner that the Doom bot was adaptive. If he had disengaged sooner and came up with an alternative plan things would have been different.
At the absolute least, Tony had finally managed to decrypt the thumb drive. It was gnarly and difficult but it finally happened.
Tony snapped out of his BARF induced catatonia and screamed. He bolted from the stool he was sitting upon and ripped the technical hardware from his face and threw it across the room. He began hyperventilating, completely unable to control his tumultuous emotions. He grabbed at his head and tried his hardest to suppress his erratic thoughts of painful despair.
“The beds ready.” Steve said simply, wondering what asinine thing was going to come out of the genius’s mouth this time.
Some of his best and favorite memories took place at none other than Coney Island and Rockaway Beach. They had scrimped and saved for months to make sure they could make it out to the amusement park at least once every summer. There had never been a time he laughed harder during those long summer days. Probably the only time he would wholly welcome an asthma attack. To die laughing, he decided, wouldn’t be a bad way to go. Bucky did not find that idea very amusing.
The Captain nodded idly, he was at a complete loss for words. A father is supposed to protect his children! But to do such heinous things… despicable!
One of their tails, a very versatile minisub, was closing in on Bucky’s prone form. It extended a claw intending to nab him. Iron Man quickly closed the gap but another pressure bomb went off knocking him back more. Another sub unit had caught up with them. The claw clasped around Bucky’s left leg and started to pull him in. Tony tried again to reach the soldier as he was becoming more and more concerned as Barnes’ vitals kept spiking.
“Okay, here it is.” He took a deep breath. “It was hell, plain and simple. You have no idea what I would have rather gone through instead of watch, front row seat, as I killed my friends. As I did innumerable things to ensure Loki had his way. Consciously, I questioned nothing. If Loki commanded it, it was done. Simple as that. If he told me to knife myself in the heart I would have done it instantaneously, without hesitation.” He bit his lips and wiped stray sugar, the corner of his mouth. He looked Tony right in the eye and continued.
“Shit.” He muttered. “Is he lucid?” Tony asked apprehensive. Maybe if he was having an episode Tony could just leave him alone.
The Captain flinched back and held up his shield, not sure what to expect from her. Especially after watching her easily take out Johnny and Ben. Steve peeked around his shield when nothing happened. He saw a look of disbelief on the woman’s face. Apparently whatever she meant to do to him didn’t work.
“Well, with that I believe I will sleep well.”  He smiled as he had tired written all over his face.
“And another thing, what were you doing carrying that crap anyway?” As Tony was about to go on yet another livid rant Steve decided to intervene.
As he floated along the vast empty space he couldn't help but to sigh and shake his head at all the stupid decisions that led him to this very moment.
“Why go through all of this trouble? Why involve us like this?!” He demanded frustrated beyond anything he’s ever felt before.
He looked upon the sketch in his lap knowing that this is one of the ‘what ifs’ he was constantly plagued by.  ‘What if we had gotten married, what if we had settled down in that old farmhouse, what if we had kids and a dog, what if… I were happy?’  He knew he would have to eventually let it go.  That he would move on because there is no possible way to have that kind of dream now.  But he just couldn’t.  It felt like to give that piece up would be giving up a big piece of himself and he was just not ready to do that.
Steve had been lying in bed for the last two hours wide awake. Natasha and Steve had spent nearly an hour just talking and bonding. She reassured Steve that it was okay to feel the way he felt and that if anybody had a problem with it… Well… He was talking to the Black Widow after all. Gruesome details aside he was extremely grateful for her support.
He pulled the net closer looking at the butterfly but not really looking at it. His mind was still utterly consumed by the man that had just disappeared right before his eyes.
He closed his eyes to concentrate. “It’s been almost a week since San Jose. That’s plenty of time for them to reach New York. They’d have to lay low but where? Where? What would Bucky deemed safe but obvious enough for me alone to find?”
"No, this isn't real." He said again as the black cracks spread across his vision webbing out in sharp harsh angles.
“They’re fine. If Steve thought they were fine, then they’re good.” Tony managed to groan out before the world began to spin and he promptly passed out.
“Tony, where are you on your ‘T.C.T.C.D.’ repairs?” Tony dramatically rolled his eyes showing his distain at being handled so ‘officially.’
He smiled to himself, ‘Honestly, I’ve got nothing better to do. I like the idea of going out the right way this time.’
Steve sighed. “But he’s my responsibility, it should be me that brings him in.” He whispered brokenly.
Horrifyingly enough the opportunity had arisen later that afternoon. It was breaking news over every channel, network and station. The vice president had been assassinated along with his entire family. The shooter had been identified as the very same assassin that took out Senator Wolfram and Colonel Nick Fury Director of Shield, the Winter Soldier.
The soldier shouted at everyone to get away as quick as possible. The hole pulsed then dilated even wider.
Was she cruel? Benevolent? Both? Why couldn't he think of anything useful to ask her? He still didn't know hardly anything about her, he didn't even know her name…
All too soon it was bedtime for little Eleanor. Steve carried her up the stairs and made sure she accomplished her nightly routine. He found, however, that she was quite self-sufficient in that area. With clean teeth, brushed hair and donning her favorite nightgown she practically drove into bed. Steve laughed merrily at her antics.
Barnes nodded mutely and began to gingerly remove the wrapping and gauze. Tony watched him appraisingly. His shoulder looked red and angry but only because, as Tony discovered upon closer inspection, it was mostly fresh scar tissue.
“ He started to sexually assault Gloria, many times in front of Jimmy. There’s, uh, a more detailed account that I’m sure Maria can provide later about the kids testimony and medical analysis, Anyway when the boy tried to intervene George beat him good. The bastard was able to talk his way out of the accusations and the abuse only stopped when George mysteriously drove off of a bridge.
“Ah you, the walking contradiction. I was wondering when you would finally speak to me.” She smirked wickedly at him. Her look was the very embodiment of a cunning fox bearing its teeth.
Steve was finding it hard to gain his balance. Something was off and this new development wasn't helping. There was something… Something that just wasn't right.
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Yes.” He said looking back at the ceiling. “What are you waiting for? Use it! ‘Cause I ain’t saying shit!” He shouted.
“No common physician or scientist has ever encountered the likes before and have concluded a new possible strain. Our people, however, know different. Thus this meeting.” Bruce concluded and took his seat.
Steve could not help but to think that he would come out of that bout completely unscathed. He wanted to laugh.  It felt like he was getting to know the crazy genius all over again.
“Ehem, yeah, and we just played some of the old fashioned outdoor games.  Tag was the most popular, and hiding’n go seek tag was a nice twists I introduced to them.  Then the dad came home from work via carpool.  I expected them to get quiet, to become well behaved and respectful.  But when they realized his arrival they screamed so jovially and excitedly I thought there was a fire or something.
Then all of a sudden the Professors consciousness was assaulted by a massive amount of noise. Many many thoughts were impaling him all at once. It seemed like a huge crowd of people were heading this way. Funny thing was they all had the same voice. It took a moment for the renound telepath to realize that the assault of many thoughts was coming from one person. The closer this person got the more fragmented thoughts he could clearly make out. ‘Donating Dumm-E – Fury is a Douche Bag – Boring Meeting – Repulser upgrade – More crotch Room in case of arousal…again – Annoying worry wart Capcicle – My awesome sexiness –‘ Were just some of the thoughts that assaulted his mind. His attention diverted back to Steve when the Captain had the overwhelming urge to voice his gratitude.
Speaking of dead ends, there had been relatively no new developments in the Calamity case, even with everyone pooling their resources.  Despite all of the information Calamity provided it was all still useless.  It’s like she knew no matter how much she revealed, none could hope to stop her anyway.  Tony had yet to completely decipher the encryption but kept assuring everybody that he was close.
“Sir, the suits primary system has been compromised. I have severed the link to the tower but I can’t hold it off much longer.”
Tony groaned internally at Clint's responses. He was tempting fate, talking to a celestial God like that. Then again Tony has absolutely no room to talk.
Harker may be dead now but Graham Rhododendron was still running the show. There's no way to know if Graham was pulling the strings all along and Harker was the true puppet or if the Rhododendron, now master less, and thus aimless, was in possession of some truly devastating power and now out of control.
In a highly secure underground compound deep in the heart of a restless city a slender figure ran frantically into the main control room.
Tony took a deep. He really, really did not want to be here. He could already feel himself get agitated knowing he was going to have to interact with this prisoner and it likely wasn’t going to go his way. Luckily, he reminded himself, that he may have brought along an ace card.
“At least I’m not the one wearing a pink bunny suit!” Tony rebuttaled, scanning desperately for an opening.
“Oh Steven, they are not comfortable with it at all, but do it to protect you.”  The Professor expressed softly.
“Make no mistake my dear, as my keystone your purpose in my plans has already come to fruition. I felt it imperative to at the very least give you a modicum of peace while I fulfill my purpose of laying claim of every soul on your little planet.” Calamity’s demeanor shifted to dead serious. She approached Steve and grabbed his chin making him look her in the eye.
Now Harker looked really scared. He turned around and started to run. He was this fat pink waddling mess and Steve could not help but to think how immensely humorous it was if he wasn’t so God damn angry.
“Oh come on now! You are all standing so stiffly. Please sit, I am not here to hurt to you or stop you.” She drawled.
“Welcome back to reality Cap, I was wondering if we were going to lose you.”  He smiled as he rearranged various objects on the work table.
Steve was utterly lost, but didn’t let it show. He nodded politely. Ellie’s attention was already fixated on the sundae.
He really did not know how a heart could endure so much pain and still keep beating. The last few weeks alone were horrible enough and then add all that to his entire life?
The only reprieve Tony got was the fact that Jarvis was able to alert him that a small number of his team were in fact waking up from Calamity's coma. Unfortunately, he had no time to celebrate as the five-minute warning had come immediately after. No point enjoying his team's awakening if there was no world for his team to wake up to.
Besides the God-awful scream, the whole scene seemed rather innocuous, as Calamity pulled a bright white light from his body. Yet Tony knew on a deep fundamental level that what he was witnessing was by far the most horrific and detestable thing he could ever possibly witness. Even more so than even the most gruesome, bloody genocide ever committed. This thing he had just witnessed he knew would leave a lasting scar on his very soul.
Tony could perceive the terrifying smirk in her voice. Like he said before, when Thor arrived things were going to get lit.
“Oh God! This is nasty!” Tony nearly bellowed as his face scrunched up in disgust. “How fucking old are you?” He exclaimed as he desperately wiped the wetness out of his ear, dreadfully hoping it was merely saliva and not something… else. Tony wouldn’t put it past him.
"For now. Perhaps in a millennia or two I shall retest your planet and try my luck then. I cannot stop here and I cannot go on without Midgardian souls. I did not come this far to only come this far."
“Yeah, not much time for anything knowing the world is ending. I’m pretty sure my tamagotchi is dead.” Tony smirked. Steve eyed him a shook his head.
Steve shrugged to himself and followed Tony as he meandered through the various halls of the helicarrier until they reached the room that overlooked the brilliant starry sky from all angles.
Soon enough due to the extreme stress of the day; they both fell into a light sleep.  Of course such peace can only last so long.
“Yeah!” He replied, swallowing thickly. “I’m fine, I just-“  He sighed. He did not know what to say. “It must be the shell shock.” He replied finally. “I’m fine.” He tried to reassure again.
“Alright, unwrap those bandages and let’s take a look.” Tony instructed, taking the case from Dumm-E.
"Indeed, I think the hardest part was pulling all the strings that led your long-lost brother back into your path. I knew the guilt would consume you. Still, it wasn't enough. Leading you to believe that your mate was unfaithful to you took a bit of good timing. Finally, by that point your mind and heart were falling apart, yet, it still wasn't enough."
“You weren’t there! After you stupidly dove into the giant zapper and destroyed it you were going to die! You were dying in my arms, Steve.” His voice wavered. “Your body was so broken and your skin was ripped apart.” Tony choked. “There was so much blood…”
If Clint had any ordinary arrows he had probably use them by now. All he could do was use the high-tech ones he had left. That machine they had, however, seem to jam and scramble anything technical they had.
"It's something Calamity said." He replied. "I re-watched the footages a couple of times, trying to get a feel for her, trying to figure out her angle." He explained.
Oh, how he wished his brother was here to see this. He would have been the greatest damn uncle on Earth. Maybe at this point he would have been one hell of a father too…
Steve found a peace he hadn’t felt in nearly a century as he watched Tony’s sleeping form. The couch was close to a window so he could still see as the clouds lazily drifted by. But despite the epic sci-fi action film and the enchanted clouds out the window Tony held Steve’s focus completely.
Tony gently prodded the flesh next to the anchor wall and was entirely pleased to see a perfect merger even better than his own arc reactor socket wall. He had considered letting the Doc check out his socket wall, then thought better of it. He’ll just design a technology similar to Dr. Cho’s sometime later on, that is, if they all survive this.
Suddenly the scene changed again and they were now standing in the middle of a desolate wasteland. There was not a lick of gorgeous color anywhere. It was all grey. The dirt, the sky, it was all grey and devoid of life and color. It seemed like he was standing on the edge of the world, looking down into a deep ravine where it seemed like the planet itself was cracked in half. He was about to ask where they were but when he looked up at the sky and saw the three moons, broken but there, he knew exactly where they were.
In the meantime, Clint and Natasha were waiting for Steve to emerge. They were starting to get worried. They had heard a lot of commotion going on in the facility and were hoping that the Captain had things under control.
There was something itching at the back of his mind.  He resolutely ignored Hank in favor of focusing on that inch.  There was something important…  Yes…  Important.  He did not know what.
“Okay, official number one and number two are probably still behind this door.” The genius warned. “Can you stand by yourself?”
When the last of Anuk's black twinkling light faded from the sky, it irrevocably and resoundingly marked the end of the Calamity case.
He sat back down on the edge of the bed. The buckle of one of the useless restraints was digging into his thigh. He did not notice however because he was desperately trying to piece together his broken heart. He was so utterly confused. He thought… He actually thought he and Tony had something.
Two old biddies walked by and tutted at their behavior before walking into the drugstore. Steve and Ellie simultaneously mimicked them then turned to each other and laughed.
Before he even took one step in the direction back to the others a strange sensation overtook him.  His back went ramrod straight and the hair on his body stood on end.  Something in the air shifted and Steve knew even before it happened there was a bad vibe in the air.
However Natasha, also seemingly with Coulson and Maria, was a bit unhappy with Tony’s response.  Everyone had been working tirelessly to find this woman and all the sudden Tony had come up with the information they been working so hard on.  She interjected.
“That’s what she said.” Clint muttered from his place on the workbench. Only after hearing the resounding slap against the back of Barton’s head, courtesy of Natasha, did Tony continue.
Bruce nodded and continued, “These people have normal brain activity, there is no feasible reason they should be in this condition. Since you sent me the information, one more case has popped up in the same exact condition as the others and is currently located at Mercy’s General Hospital in Hoppsville, New Jersey.”
All of a sudden the Captain was surrounded by his team. Thor was on his right, Johnny on his left, Ben at his six and Scott crawled up on his left shoulder.
Then suddenly, mid-stroke, he paused and frowned, feeling an odd presence. He looked up to find the man standing right over him apparently observing his progress.
Steve enjoyed how excited she got over something as simple as riding in an elevator. He watched as her face lit up when he let her press the floor button and how her smile widened when the elevator lifted.
Steve was usually the most clearheaded and mature one. He kept them all in line and it was a hard responsibly especially when working with someone like Tony.  The Captain was a saint.
Bucky remained silent, pensive. It honestly irked Tony more than the others presence. Barnes was as nearly hyperverbal as he was and when he was silent like this, it was scary.
The two doom bots closed in on him and he had realized last minute that they had essentially cornered him. He found himself at a literal crossroads. Behind him were the doom bots, straight-ahead was a large bank, to the right was a street blocked off by a collapsed building and to the left the portal.
She led him to the living room and let him ease her down into her armchair. He noted the lovely floral pattern and placed the matching ottoman in front of her after she was seated comfortably. He knelt in front of her.
Having his ire stoked yet again, Iron Man deployed yet another onslaught of seeker and homing missiles, half to the wretched rabbit, and the other half to the hell bird hatchlings.
“Well, to start things off, I’m glad you’re here. Honestly, after last night I definitely wasn’t expecting to see you so soon.” Tony began. ‘Or at all.’ He thought in amazement.
He had intended to write everything that he learned that day about the mystery man into this journal. He had tried his damnedest to not think about everything that had happened the last two days. It was a tad easier when he had Ellie to focus on all day, but now she was asleep and he was alone.
He knew the science behind nutrition, knew his brain would perform at more optimal levels if he only would eat more. He knew this, truly. However, he had extreme difficulty keeping anything down. His stress and anxiety absolutely would not let him consume the nutrition he needs in order to, ironically, alleviate the stress and anxiety. Even if his mind and heart were finnaly in the right place his body refused to catch up to him.
"Steve, my boy, come in, come in! I haven't seen you in a few weeks." The shopkeeper, Frank, as the embroidery on his shirt says, exclaims jovially, offering his hand out to shake.
He showed her the hope of a future with Peggy Carter and his exhilaration of having his best friend fight by his side. He showed her what it felt like having his heart ripped out as he watched helplessly as Bucky fell to his death. He made sure to leave not a single detail out. He showed her what it was like when he made the decision to make the ultimate sacrifice. How he was ready to give everything to ensure millions could live in his place when he brought the Valkyrie down.
“After everything that has happened,” He started. “You can imagine how surprised I was to receive this.” He waved the letter about.
It was so odd how the first details to fade were the most important ones, like the man's eyes, nose and mouth. Even odder still was how thoroughly and completely his dream erased from his mind so quickly. The only thing he knew for sure by breakfast time was that a man operated the futuristic armor. That's it. He could not ascertain age, race, or any other physical attributes except that he was definitely male. Yet, Steve knew with absolute certitude that he could see the man clearly in his mind the moment he woke up. Thus, his rush to the sketchbook in the early hours of the morning.
Tony woke up sometime later in the dead of night with a start. He picked his head off of the table slowly, not wanting to strain his neck the process. He was dismayed to find a small screwdriver stuck to his face. He idly wondered what woke him so suddenly.
The scream of ecstasy that tore from the Captain's throat emboldened Tony to move faster, rubbing their hardening members together sensually. Now thoroughly aroused, Steve gripped Tony's hair firmly and tugged his head back, unlatching him from his neck, then resumed their heated kiss, plundering Tony's mouth for all he was worth. The desperate moan of pleasure he elicited from Tony was a dangerous fuel to their lustful fire.
“Thank you. It’s true I don’t want to talk about it but I have to. I need to.” Steve replied not breaking eye contact.
Steve does not envy Thor’s position in the slightest. Everybody Steve loves is native to the planet, there is something of a morbid relief in that. Steve sighed to himself. He thought if the situation were reversed he probably would do anything for Tony. Hell, he would have probably done anything for Bucky and the rest of his team. Then and now. He looked into Thor’s expect face.
He looked down dismally at the deconstructed mess that was once his newest Iron Man suit. He knew the risks when he had made the decision to use his armor to re-create the distorter. However, he had wholly underestimated how utterly vulnerable he felt as he sat there wearing a nearly half dead suit and completely disconnected from Jarvis and his team.
He has apologies to make and a code to break. He needs to right some wrongs at least the best he could and prepare his team for the next threat.
The moment Calamity’s lips came in contact with his own the entire world shifted. He felt Iron Man’s cold armor wrap around him before an impression similar to traveling through the Bifrost overcame him. This time, however, it was not painless. He could vaguely hear Tony’s voice. Steve could not understand what was said, he only recognized the sound.
He looked down at his hand that she was holding. His wrist was glowing an iridescent black. The same black that radiated from the cracks in his vision, the same black that keeps trying to fog his mind…
Every single fucking wretched thought and torturous emotion hit him like an atom bomb. He backed up until he hit the wall of the infirmary and slid down until his ass collided painfully with the hard, cold tile floor. He pulled his knees to his face and completely and utterly broke down. The one thought that kept whirling around in his mind like a destructive hurricane over and over was that Steve, the one person Tony loved most in the entire universe, wished he didn't exist.
He walked into her room and was saddened when she stopped singing the moment she realized his presence. His sadness was short-lived, however, when her expression beamed and she squealed in delight as she launched herself at him.
“She kissed you and said…” He exhaled and inhaled rapidly, “She said she has something special in store for you.” He gulped trying to regain control.
“Well, it seems that we are all here.”  Fury stated as he looked upon the worry worn and very jaded members of the superhero team before him.
She sighed heavily, "I may be a Celestial God but even my abilities are vastly limited. If I interfere now there could be untold cataclysmic repercussions."
At last the texts were in their possession. And so it was Captain America and Thor were on their way back to Earth.
“If Tony hadn’t found you when he did… Not to mention your gut wound wasn’t as bad as it could have been. Talk about a near evisceration.”
Despite all of the devastatingly horrible things that has happened that day, somehow seeing Natasha in that state was the most frightening of all.  He slowly brought his hand up to run through her soft crimson hair.  That action only served to make her cry harder.
‘Oh yes! I get to deal with this Tony again.’ He thought sarcastically. Here’s to hoping he doesn’t get handsy.
Crazy guy squealed like a stuck pig anyway.  Apparently, Tankar was hired by a man simply known as Harker.  Harker was working on something big, so he had hired Tankar to be a significant distraction.  Something to keep the Avengers and the world busy as he executed his plans.
“Oh? Am I?” Tony questioned as he sat next to Steve on the bed grabbing at the gown to look over his torso.
He hadn’t seen Tony much the last few days. The genius was working on a whole shit ton of things at once. He was still deciphering the code among other things. Tony did manage to find time for Pepper, however, when she came to visit. One of the hardest things he has ever done was to plaster a kind smile to his face and accept her well wishes.
"No!" Tony shouted, angered at her superior attitude. "No, it's not over yet! Take me instead! Please, this world needs him more than me. Please let me take his place!" Tony bargained.
A few hours ago Tony thought his life could not get any worse. The universe once again failed to disappoint and could not help but prove him wrong. The Winter Soldier, Barnes, Steve’s best friend, killed his parents.
Somewhere in the back of his mind he registered that more fighting had seemed to close in around him. No doubt the Rhododendron was probably sending the nearest fake doom bots and fuzz buzz to his location to stop his progress. He could feel the static electricity pulse every time one of those electric fuzz balls of death had been disabled. He could hear the grating sound of metal tearing each time one of the bots was destroyed. Still he continued on, fixated on soldering piece after piece together.
“I’ve been keeping tabs on you for weeks now, Tony. I know there’s something up with you and it doesn’t have to all do with this case.”
He looked about the room hoping everyone got the double meaning from that. Seeing that everyone had knowing faces on he continued.
He put the teakettle on the stove to bring to a boil. Little did they know he had slipped in a few sleeping capsules into the water. They were rather tasteless, they tricked Tony enough when he had to drugged him, so he wasn’t too worried. He prepared the tea pods while the water boiled. He participated in idle chitchat with them while he prepared the tea.
"Source?" Tony scanned the area searching for the Rhododendron or anyone else trying to destabilize the portal.
“Mr. Stark and Captain Rogers come to my quarters now, it is urgent.”  The audio feed cut off suddenly.
Please leave me a review and let me know what you think. All comments, questions, and theories are welcome.
There were pressure sensors in the fingertips of his armor. When pressed in the proper sequence, it activated self-destruct. It was a long and complicated code as it would be bad if the code was accidentally pressed during battle but Tony was incredibly swift at typing. He’d have it blown up before Rhododendron figured out how homing worked. The pressure buttons where completely manual, like turning a key or shifting a mechanism into gear. To put it simply it was a part of the core mechanisms of the suit. Each correct variable in the sequence was like a lock sliding into place. It was something the Rhododendron absolutely could not stop.
At this point over 70 people up and down the east coast have fallen into a coma with the exact same strange symptoms. However, there is no visible pattern. One person would drop in Main and then the next would be in Georgia then Florida and Virginia. Different locations hundreds of miles away.
Steve spent the next few hours thinking about the whole horrible thing until he drove himself into a righteous anger. He stomped back into the compound intending on giving Tony a real solid piece of his mind. He was going over all the delightfully evil ways he could wake the bastard only to find the genius already awake waiting for him. Steve deflated instantly at the look of pure misery on Tony’s face. He was certain the look on his own face, however, was still thunderous.
Tony sighed heavily and rolled his eyes, "It may have been pointed out to me by people that don't know how to keep their nose out of other people's business that I have a once in a lifetime opportunity to at the very least apologize for…things. So, here I am." He said with annoyance.
“Steve, darling, I believe you outdid yourself this morning.” Peggy said as she handed Steve her plate as he began to clean the table.
Steve grinned at her term of endearment for him and Ellie. "I promise we will behave." He reassured.
“Here in writing,” gesturing to indiscernible runes. “It is loosely translated by our scholars to say ‘It Shall End in Calamity.’ With it weathered documentation of the last of this people.
"When you said 'Yes' of course. The moment you agreed to accept my gift was the moment I had complete and unadulterated access to all the souls on your Midgardian Earth."
“I may or may not have chased a slippery nipple with a Jaeger bomb. Then subsequently had taken six shots of whatever was handed to me at this raging hot party and never mind, asshole, laugh it up!” Tony almost squealed indignantly.
A/N: Am I a terrible person?  Who knows…  All I do know is that Calamity is very right.  It will get much worse from here on out.  I’m sorry Steve, I’m so sorry.
Steve was staring out the window still when Tony came up behind him and placed his hand gently on the Captains shoulder.
He watched disheartened as she approached him sullenly. Her eyes were red and her cheeks were still wet. She looked all sorts of wrong. She was supposed to be the epitope of strength and a master of her emotions. To see everything written clearly upon her face was nearly unbelievable and just as unbearable. He regarded her for a moment letting her have the chance to speak first. She took a deep breath and wiped her face on a dark sleeve.
Breakfast had been relatively uneventful.  He had a couple of pieces of fruit and a glass of orange juice.
He began to reach for Tony hoping for some sort of respite from the torrent of emotions whirling inside of him. He had never been so afraid. Something very bad was going to come to pass. Before he could even reach Tony it began.
She passed by the room holding the asset. She glanced at his prone form briefly before moving on. She cringed thinking about the first time she laid eyes on the fat man’s deadliest weapon. She had never felt more fear then when she stepped into the presence of that thing strapped to that contraption. The fat man said it was to keep it under control. She felt sick. The kind of monster it must be to go through such lengths to keep it “controlled.”
Steve watched with bated breath as Hank finished up that conversation on the phone.  He felt absolutely wretched.  That school was full of kids, children for god’s sake.  How many were taken down?  He didn’t know.
Even though the subsequent scream was entirely expected, it still turned Tony’s stomach in ways he did not know it could turn. It was wretchedly awful. Natasha seemed to not be doing much better. Just as quickly as it had started, it had stopped. Like Tony said, the pain would occur instantaneously, but not remain.
Xavier is constantly reading everyone’s minds. He knows that Tony's lashing out was not caused by the professors information but by Fury reprimanding Steve for asking fair questions. It was his right to ask them.
As Steve followed Tony deeper into his lab he had to remind himself over and over again in his head that Tony was just that way.  That he is a kind, wonderful and caring person under all that attitude.  And that Steve loves him no matter what.
Now he’s here in this time facing things he thought could only exist in science fiction.  Now there is this alien running around attacking people putting them in comas for a reason nobody yet knows.  This thing is choosing people with horrific tragic backgrounds.  The victims have already gone to hell and back and now they have to go through this.  Then to add to the misery Thor said that there is likely no cure.  Then to top it all off the alien had attacked kids.  This is nothing but a hellish nightmare.  The good Captain desperately wished he could be more useful in this situation.
“Not if I’m going to replace your arm, you’re not!” He huffed. Bucky’s eyes widened. “I had consulted with the leading most neuro-surgeon in the world. He told me a procedure like that would be excruciating, torture even, without some sort of analgesic to alleviate the pain of rebinding your nerves to the cybernetics. But wait, oh yeah, you can’t have painkillers because of your metabolism. Ergo this doohickey here.” Tony rebuttaled.
With the addition to the insurgence of allies, Steve single-handedly managed to rally the remaining members of the Avengers on the battlefield still able to fight.
“It’s fine Bucky. You did not by any means come out of that unscathed either.” He said lightly tracing the faint bruising still visible on his friends face. It did not go unnoticed to Steve how Bucky also babied his right arm. He did recall with a wince breaking it.
Steve took a deep breath and centered himself. He took another look around the room this time focusing on each individual. Then he spotted what appeared to be a male and female duo in the middle left pews. His heart shook and shuddered the longer he stared at the male figure.
“My dear Steven, ‘tis true that I needed you to experience more pain but you must have realized by now,” She looked down sideways at him with a smirk. “Not all pain is that the physical kind.”
He watched absently as Dr. Doom turned on her instantly and attacked her with one of his most destructive abilities at his disposal. Calamity only laughed. Steve could feel himself start to shake. Victor was about to gear up and attacked her with everything he had before he altogether stopped and fell to the streets beneath him. He landed with a sickening thud. And with that he moved no more. The doom bots still remaining soon followed their master and shutdown operation.
“Oh god what now!?”  Tony groaned.  He looked over at Steve.  “Promise me whatever this new thing is you won’t get involved.”
“She didn’t say, but I’m assuming it’s because the code is so fucking massive and we don’t have the right key to read it.” Tony explained with disdain. “Jarvis, pause music.” He commanded suddenly, stopping in the middle of ‘Come Out and Play’ by the Offspring.
Tony watched his activity warily, hoping he didn’t decide to buy obscene things online with an audience present. The genius nearly died in horror a few days ago when Clint walked in while Barnes was in the middle of buying a hot pink leash and collar. It was not for dogs.
Then again they probably would have found a way to track him using it. He was probably better off, but now he had no idea how he was supposed to find Bucky or keep track of how close the others were to. Whatever, he had to keep moving.
Tony glanced over and saw that indeed Barnes was referring to Calamity’s dense data load. Tony emitted a long-suffering groan and muttered an affirmation.
“As tempting as that would be, Stark, why would I give up the best prize yet? You under my complete control for a bit of cash. Hmm?” He licked his greasy lips. “Oh, how I wish Captain America were here to be a part of my glorious victory. It would be absolutely perfect to have you kill him.”
When she was out of sight and all Steve saw was the tile floor and all he heard were heart monitors, he got a gravely sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He knew without a shadow of a doubt that he loved Peggy and his family but there was a strange sick nagging feeling that what he felt for her paled in comparison to… Something else.
When he woke he noted how the air was crisp and fresh and smelt of the sea. He yawned deeply and began to stretch only to regret it instantly. He felt many of his stitches tugging agonizingly in protest. He felt his already tender flesh tear open again where he popped the stitches yesterday after his impact with the pavement after his great escape.
There was no way he could stop analyzing the drive and at the same time he could not just leave his team high and dry. They were all just spread too thin.
“I mean we’re only just a few miles off of the coast of Virginia all high in the sky.  I’m sure I could book us a restaurant, what are you in the mood for?”  Tony pulled out his phone looking for restaurants.
He quickly disconnected the suit from his arc reactor, alleviating the pressure and began to breathe heavily which only served to start a coughing fit.
“Oh look, here’s your father now.” Peggy looked up at him. “Tell Eleanor she needs to go take a nap.”
“Indeed Sir, however you had commanded not to bother you in the event that you and Captain Rogers were-“
"Fucking asshole." The genius muttered. "The plan is to see if any of these have an intact OS. I might be able to figure out a way to take control of the fake ones and reprogram them to view me as their master." He explained as he began to take the nearest one apart.
They watched in solemn silence as the X-jet flew swiftly beyond the shipping bay doors and out of sight.
“Oh my god!”  Natasha cried as she darted out of the room, Clint hot on her heels his face twisted in agony.
What if there was some sort of time paradox happening? Tony could not exist in this universe due to Howard's accident. What if the powers that be were trying to erase his existence entirely?
One may be wondering as to why Tony Stark was involving himself so immensely in this endeavor. Such concerns were expressed numerous times by varying members of his fragmented team. Why not just let Davidson and Cho do it alone? They are not imbeciles after all. Much to the contrary. They could feasibly handle the operation alone with the notes and Jarvis to aid them. Why does Tony need to be present at all? He could be working on the code in the meantime… Blah blah blah…
“I know, I know.”  He could only imagine how Steve must feel about being stuck in such a state forever.  He was almost stuck in the ice forever…
“Be that as it may, I believe we would have noticed something, a shift or a wave of energy similar to how she takes minds individually.” Tony shot back getting that snide tone in his voice again.
"Well, the literal translation is 'that girl with the hair that looks like the black sap from the Lanr tree.'" She replied with a chuckle.
Tony sensed something off with Steve but he did not wish to aggravate the poor Captain anymore than he had to.  He could tell looking between the Professor and the man out of time that Xavier was helping Steve through whatever it was that was going on in his head.
“What do you want Tony?”  He asked setting his palette aside and dropping the brush into the water jar.
“I still should have went back and searched for your body, tried harder to bring you home.” He whispered.
Before Steve could respond with his misgivings; a doctor quickly bounded into the room with a chart of different medical stats in hand. She nodded at Thor and smiled at Steve glad to see that he was awake then turned to Tony. She gave him a hard and reproachful look before delivering on to him her onslaught.
The man was strikingly handsome, his large dark eyes full of profound intelligence and a hint of arrogance but also bearing something deeper. His straight round nose balanced well with his high cheekbones. That odd stylized beard framed his smiling lips in such a way that it complemented his face shape well.
"That's right." She said with a grunt as she struggled out of bed. "They wouldn't get anywhere without me." She muttered as she smoothed her nightgown down.
Tony stared up into Steve's warm stormy grey eyes, his smirk returning rapidly. "Oh? Why is that, Captain?"
“Looks like I am not the only one who tends to ignore his own health needs.” Tony said nodding to the crutch.
“It’s so wonderful to meet you Sarah, anybody that can make Howard think seriously about settling down is a hero in my book.” Peggy said to Sarah Maria.
“Duck!” He shouted and flung his shield in such a way that he took out most of the closest ones. But they were still gaining.
Everyone had reconvened in the super duper meeting room after Jarvis’s alert.  It was only 6:30am at that point and still several hours before the next meeting was supposed to start.  Many had yet to even sleep a wink.  This was going to be one stressful day.
He slowly tidied up his studio before retiring to his room.  His dismal thoughts weaved around the ‘what ifs’ and ‘what could have beens’ before falling into a mercifully dreamless sleep.
His face, arm and wrist continued to throb in pain. No matter what position he found himself in, it did not alleviate any of it. Even more irritating, he thought, was how he kept feeling strange pulsations in the middle of his forehead.
“Okay.” He swallowed thickly. “Remember this is very important.” He looked at them, “Do exactly what I tell you to do. Do not question me, got that?”
A hopeful flame was lit anew. He had to figure this out. He reread the letter with renewed vigor in hopes of finding out what happened. He scoffed at Steve’s hopeful encouraging words at the end. He filed those away for later, instead focus on the fact that he desperately needed answers. He began pacing maniacally trying to find a solution.
Surely the most foolish move they could make at that very moment would be to strike. Steve approached Calamity carefully and faced her.
It was an utter nightmare. Nightmares at all hours of the day, it seems. Life was just fantastic wasn’t it?
He did not really know why he was still here humoring this guy and showing him something deeply personal no less. He got what he came for… Yet… In the end, Steve risked everything for this man. He matters.
“Don’t fret Director, Mr. Stark here is holding nothing back in light of the fact that he knows he can hide nothing from my gifts.” Xavier assured gently.
Then he felt a world of shock and confusion when he realized her menstrations were actually healing him. Trust and believe he was vastly more vexed than Clint was at the moment. He just had to keep himself in check for the sake of his team. He would stay the cool and collected rock so that his team doesn’t have to.
Steve cupped Tony's face, stroking his beard lovingly and stared deep into his chocolate eyes. He leaned down and licks Tony's lips, initiating another mind-blowing kiss. While the Captain was distracted, Tony ran his hands back over Steve's thighs then dipped between his legs and gently palmed his hardened member though his jeans. The Captain broke their kiss then tossed his head back and groaned lewdly making Tony shiver.
How were they so god damned happy living in such a tiny house?  They didn’t even really have toys or bikes and their parents didn’t even have a car.  Didn’t make sense to me at the time.
"No! It cannot end here! I have to do something! I refuse to sit back and watch!" He roared as his fingers dug painfully into the dirt.
Bruce weaved through the machines and found Steve and Tony at the main work station that appeared to be in a poor state of disarray.
Captain America tried other avenues of combatting this robot that Tony taught him but it appears that Victor Von Doom was a couple steps the head of the technologically ignorant Captain. He figured that his best chance now was to lure it out and fight out in the open with Black Widow and Hawk Eye as back up. They have weapons that could put a dent in this thing in ways he could not. The Captain pulled out a flash bomb, he needed the bot to keep its focus on himself rather than going back to finish its mission. He threw it, lighting the room up with sheer radiance.
The three old friends began reminiscing about a few of their more hairy missions, weaving intricate details of action, mystery and mayhem. Both Ellie and Maria were hooked.
Then, when Tony grabbed the shield and threw it back at the other Captain America, it dawned on Steve who it was. He moved in ways Steve would, in a million years, never forget.
All of the heroes stood on shaky legs. Many were battle weary and severely wounded but regardless each and every one of them stood and declared their will to fight for their Captain's soul. Tony could not have been more proud of his team, his family. He watched as Steve looked at each one of them in turn and did a poor job holding back his emotions.
“From what Scott told me witnesses stated seeing a raven haired woman walk the halls of the school.  After talking to two of the students they had collapsed almost a minute later.  Logan had witnessed the second child collapse and had rushed in to attack the intruder recklessly.”  Hank stopped for a moment visibly aged by the predicament.
So how do you like it? I'd love to hear theories about what you think may happen. Please feel free to leave a comment.
“All right, let’s gather as much information as we can about this thing.” Steve smiled mournfully to himself.
Tony pried the plastic casing of the thumb drive a part to reveal a black iridescent crystal, crudely wired to a USB port.
“I can take you back to a time that was once lost to you. Or I can simply put you to sleep as I did the others. The decision is yours.”
He sighed then sipped at his coffee some more. It was nearly at the perfect temperature where he could take solid drinks without burning the fuck out of himself. He almost envied the way the soldier was able to drink his coffee right after pouring it from the pot, without flinching, then going back for more. At least he was civilized about it. He’d seen Clint on numerous occasions take the entire pot and drink from the spout, the animal. He groaned internally.
“Well if we do keep them alive in the comas, at least they’d remain very happy about it.”  Though spoken two help lighten the mood, it only served to put a look of uttered dismay on the Captain’s face.
“You know, Steve told me I was the most surprising and unpredictable person he knew.” Tony replied. “I’m not about to prove him wrong.”
The Avengers are now officially on the case. They pooled their information and resources. SHIELD had only a little bit more information than Tony.  The genius acquired most of his information by hacking into shields mainframe anyway.
Tony had just returned from having to deal with a bunch of bureaucratic nonsense. Though they managed to snuff out the chaos in San Jose with minimal casualties (Seriously Pep, nobody died. Yay us!) The media was still on the frenzy. The PR fire was a nightmare. Von Doom was in the freaky coma and the villain Harker ended up dead, (Okay he ended up dead but he was the bad guy.) And his underling disappeared without a trace. Not good.
Lastly, the third reason was born out of obligation and lack for a better word, irony. As it would happen, Barnes refused to go along with the procedure if Tony was not present. Through their banter of constant, unyielding bickering and throwing around salty barbed insults like rotten eggs, they had somehow created something of a dysfunctional camaraderie that no one but Wanda and the Professor seem to understand. It was utterly unnerving to most members of the team yet they had all somehow accepted it with a sigh and shake of the head.
This was his last resort he built into the suit just in case all else failed, assuming he’d be alive to use it.
“Here, it’s not the coffee from “Perky” (the semi sentient coffee maker in the common room of the tower) but it’ll do the job.”  He handed one to Steve who nodded in thanks then proceeded to take a test sip.
Despite himself Tony glanced over his shoulder to see if he could spot Thor for himself. From what Tony could tell he was hovering several hundred feet above the pseudo-void. His red cape thrashed violently against the tempest winds as he unleashed a devastating attack. The resulting sound of thunder shook the genius to his core.
Only when there was nothing left to take, did I stop and think about what I had done and to fully understand the chaos and ruin and had wrought. I had realized that my own actions were no better than those who had committed the first murder.
But now the element of surprise was gone and the Rhododendron was lined up to retaliate. Tony knew this because now his weapons were aimed at Clint.
When he stepped out into the bright sunlight he took a deep breath to gather his bearings. He stared up at the blue sky wishing he remembered the people of this town, especially when they clearly knew him.
But before he could truly breathe a sigh of relief, the worst happened. As if in slow motion Tony watched as Steve stood quickly, and looked up to Iron Man's incoming position in the sky and stared at Tony with such horror the genius knew he'd never forget it.
Tony quickly ran numerous calculations over in his head considering time, resources and environment. He finally looked up at Barnes.
“Oh my,” she said breathlessly as she pulled away. “I guess I don’t need to ask if you missed me.” She grinned.
“What the fuck is a prickly pear lemonade and why are you ordering it?”  Tony questioned the look on his face becoming more intense.
Steve knows that it’s only an expression but for some reason Tony’s words somehow made his heart start to race.  He quickly squashed down the fleeting thought that somehow deep down he may have actually wanted this to be a real date.  The soldier certainly did not want to think too deeply about the thoughts he was so desperately trying to squish.  This is in no way at all, nowhere near to being an actual date.  This is merely an outing between friends, that’s it.  That is all he wants it to be.
“Now you want to know what the keystone is? As the names suggest it is a very special significant piece to this the vast and complex puzzle."
“Do not sustain eye contact with the Rögvava, Man of Iron. She will suck all your life essence out!” Thor warned over the com line.
A lot had changed over time. It must have been well over 20 years since he was last here. Things do tend to change in that kind of time. There were new buildings here and there and even some missing, he noted. The same can also be said for varying businesses. As much as things had changed there were just as many things still the same. The ice cream shop was one of them.
“One last thing, whoever kills the most fuzzy things wins and gets to be named the undisputed master assassin of the Furry Zap Balls.” Steve announced with a grin peeking everyone’s interests considerably.
“Yeah?  Bet you look terrible in them.”  Tony ribbed.  Steve looked sideways at Tony thinking the same exact thing.
He continued to punch them out once they got too close to their little group. Steve began to wonder why he felt the pain every time, why his hands weren’t going numb. He scoffed as the answer came to him.
“As far as they know they succeeded.  Soon you will be receiving reports that I’m dead.  I expect you at my funeral.”
The car ride back home was quiet but comfortable. Ellie was busy counting the trees as they drove by them and Steve took that time to reflect on the last couple days. Even more so on the events of that day in particular. It was, to be Frank, a lot of information to absorb. He could not even begin to understand his outburst from earlier in regards to the unfortunate condition his friend was in.
Just as they were about to brainstorm a solution JARVIS chimed in with a phone call they were all anticipating and dreading since the beginning.
He laid back dramatically over his little makeshift nest and look at the moon in the sky through a broken window. He wished he had someone else with him so he wouldn’t have to do all this alone. His stupid masochistic mind thought that Tony would be the perfect partner in his asinine self-appointed mission. But no, he had to be against him in this.
The Professor and Fury were the first to enter the room. They were quietly discussing key points they hoped to cover in the meeting and in Fury’s case giving Xavier a bit of a warning about some of the members of the Avengers (*cough* Tony Stark *cough*).
“No! That wasn’t…” He paused. He quickly took out his phone. “Jarvis! Did Steve leave the infirmary on the fifth?”
Steve just sat and watched as the varying Avengers just went back and forth with the same arguments. He doesn’t even have the energy to participate. Steve actually was the one to initially find the keystone passage after hours upon hours more in front of the screen.
“Okay, for the record Steve, you are incapable of making a rational decision on a normal day, let alone after the crazy shit that happened in San Jose.” Bucky drawled.
He groaned as he gently unwrapped himself from Bucky to inspect the damage. He found as he sat up that Wanda was already awake. He supposed she was on second watch seeing as her brother was passed out next to her. He nodded and whispered “good morning.” She smiled shyly and replied in kind.
Bucky was with the siblings. If they were no longer under anybody’s command he was sure they would not let Bucky assassinate anyone. Those kids weren’t wicked inherently, just misguided. Especially if he was with that mind reader. She had the power to stop him.
Johnny held up a shaking hand and snapped his fingers a couple of times. There was only one little spark but nothing else.
“I didn’t either. But from what I could tell the Doom bot was adaptive. The more we attacked it the more stronger and quicker it became. Obviously it didn’t have time to adapt to your overwhelming power according to Clint.” The Captain gave Thor a sideways smirk.
Tony shook himself out of his thoughts as yet another negative reading flashed across his screen. He gave a long-suffering sigh and peeled himself out of his chair. He went to go replenishes his cup of coffee and perhaps choke down an apple or something.
Suddenly, he sensed her breathing pick up speed and her grip on his arm became painful. Then she emitted a bloodcurdling scream that turned his own blood to ice. Then he saw her large belly convulse, almost violently.
His statement also had an underlining tone to it.  Tony has heard it before and understands it as being ‘if you don’t do what I say I will drug you and make you go to sleep.’  There may have been a timer two in which this has actually occurred.
Her words pierced through Steve like a bullet. He hated everything about this situation. How was he meant to choose? Of course he’d choose to go back but it feels like an awful trick somehow. His mind and heart were in shambles. He could not think straight. It was hard enough to even remotely function through the excruciating pain that was his very existence.
Steve had decidedly thought it to be a good idea to make twenty seven pies.  Good thing too, once the scent of apple pies baking wafted around the compound, many people emerged from their niches and followed the smell.  One by one people had wandered into the kitchen to figure out the source of that divined smell.
This is probably going to be the distraction he was looking for.  He hates that it unfortunately comes about by something wrong that he has to take care of.
The only things Steve could really gather was that if the man really existed somewhere and had to do with a mission that may or may not be ongoing, then Steve's state of amnesia may be putting the man in jeopardy. He hoped not. But he figured that if that was indeed the case, someone, somewhere would contact him and ask him what the issue was.
"Ellie." He sighed exasperated. "Babydoll, you know you can't. You'll just have to wait for the baby to come to see her." He said soothingly while rubbing her back as her little body shook as she continued to cry.
Thor looked torn but did as he was commanded. Tony continued to protest angrily but Steve could no longer hear him after Thor jumped into the sky. He landed swiftly a few blocks away and grabbed Antman and Johnny before hastily flying out of sight toward the evac zone. The Captain wasn’t too worried about Ben, he was rather bulletproof, he’d survive.
“My dear Steven.” She approached him steadily and Tony’s grip on his hand tightened with no sign of relenting, his fingers digging in.
Steve was happy that the department store in which they needed to pick up the package was mercifully only a block away from the bus stop.
"Unfortunately for you, this Calamity does not meet the laws of that task. Regardless a planet wide evacuation would not help you in the least.”
That is not saying much. Both of you are incredibly hardheaded and unyielding. I thought it would be nearly impossible."
The others were still bound and he was pretty sure he would not be able to free them.  The troops were coming and if crazy guy was to be believed any involvement from them would lead to disaster.  Help was still a long ways away.  It’s the best idea he’s got.
He so does not got this! What the fuck was he thinking!? Yeah of those freaky little creatures were easy to destroy but damn, Clint was not joking, those little bastards packed quite a punch. The first one that zapped him nearly knocked him on his ass. They were vastly superior to Natasha’s electrifying talents. He shivered thinking about it.
Tony backed out of the way as Scott and Sam made their way to Barnes to patch him a tad better than a T-shirt and duck tape.
The Avengers immediately went to a retelling of the insane predicament that they had found themselves in.  Ending with the conclusion that the assailant must be alien in origin.
“Like I said, you will read this book to me and tell me what I need to know.  Or I will blow your disgusting brains out you ungrateful twit!”  He bellowed spitting and foaming at the mouth.
Steve realized instantly that this was not a scene from Earth. The colors all around him were so much more vibrant and numerous. The grass beneath his feet seemed to irradiate hues on the green and blue spectrum he didn't even know existed. He then looked up to the sky and what he saw took his breath away. It was a brilliant starry night sky that had an array of stunning colors such as blues and purples and pinks washed over the inky blackness that was littered with gorgeous diamonds. The three moons shone brilliantly, each emitting their own unique color.
“Shit!” God this was the stupidest idea ever, a prison break from one of the most secure prisons in the world. Real smart!
“We are going to look at that program before we turn in.” Stated Natasha, pulling Clint along to go to their favorite work station.  Everyone left the room leaving just Steve and Tony by themselves.
Anük continued, "If you may recall this was all a test. As I said before if I wanted you out of the way, you would be dead. If I wanted you to utterly fail, I would not have shown myself to you nor would I have left such blatant clues behind."
The Captain took in his surroundings.  He found that he was in an infirmary room in the compound.  He looked at the monitor that had held his attention since his awakening.
As with most adversaries the Avengers had fought in the past, Calamity had made the grievous error of underestimating Tony Stark. When she made the ill-fated decision to give her code to Tony, she had inadvertently handed him the tool of her demise.
A destroyed doom bot landed heavily next to him courtesy of Barnes-Captain America. It scraped across his leg loudly as it gouged a dent into the remaining armor on his thigh. He gave it a small fleeting glance as he plucked a tiny part off of its robotic corpse without missing a beat. He vaguely registered Barnes apologizing, he ignored him, favoring the task of assembling the new spatial distorter.
Tony bolted to his primary computer, took the code Barnes supplied and quickly gave it a few tweaks based on his own research over the last few months before plugging it into his command port for Jarvis to use.
All of this was a thousand times nicer than anything he had in his entire life. He smiled to himself. He was immensely happy that his wife and children did not need to struggle the way he did all of his life. He undressed slowly as he watched his reflection in the mirror. He really took the time to look over himself. Mirrors were something of a luxury in the Army. Even the fractured, corroded piece he left behind in Brooklyn was more than he ever really saw overseas. They had small hand mirrors, sure, but not something he could use to examine himself so thoroughly. If they were ever staying in a place that may have had one he never did have the time to use it anyway. For whatever he needed he had always trusted Bucky to look him over and deem him healthy and or presentable. He took the time to look now however.
“You need to trust us Steve. We’re out there looking for him. We will bring him in.” Tony managed to sound reassuring.
“Well if we’re going to make any sense of this at all then we gotta start somewhere.” Steve said clapping his hands together partly to gain everyone’s attention and partly to keep his mind focused.
Iron Man slowly got up to his feet and face the Captain. Steve felt Bucky come up behind him and at a quick glance saw that he was in possession of his shield.
“Captain fucking America would also cringe at your fucking language.” Bucky smirked painfully through his tears, then grimaced.
“I get the feeling one way or another it’ll happen.” He said distantly staring out the window watching the sky wake up with spectacular hues of vibrant gold, iridescent reds and oranges. Dawn was Steve’s most absolute favorite time of the day.
But Bucky Barnes had apparently returned from the dead and that’s all Steve could think about. After being the center of attention for so long it’s hard to swallow being placed on the back burner. He deserves it, he supposed.
He has so many questions but does not know where to start. He does not want to bug Peggy with a multitude of questioning when perhaps in just a few days he would remember everything he needed to remember. Like the doctors said he just needed patients.
"No, I mean, Howard can't have children." Steve replied thinking about the disheartening information he had learned recently.
“I can’t save the world by myself. With Steve gone I can’t lead the team, fight the bad guys, and find a way to stop Calamity.” He admitted. “I know I-I talk big and I am generally full of myself, I know this but I just can’t you know?” He confided, Bucky stood stock still a Stoic mask in place, letting Tony vent. He gave the barest nod indicating he was listening and should continue.
Her face fell even more, tears streamed down her face unyieldingly, her bottom lip quivered in despair.
He tried to laugh it off, "I'm sorry, Babydoll, I didn't mean to scare you. I'm just very worried about your mom and the baby." He tried to be reassuring.
Witnessing Captain America with such a raunchy attitude was wildly unsettling. The genius shuddered violently causing Barnes's scowl to deepen.
Tony snapped, “Stop FUCKING with me Barnes and answer my question! What is this!?” He demanded with a bellow, his entire heart was on the line.
It didn’t help that when Steve asked Fury and Natasha about the pinched looks on their faces they said it was nothing.
“Yes unfortunately.” Captain America had to figure out how to get them to safety. More puff balls were heading that way according to Clint.
“And if we work together we can help you with that. The girl, Wanda, was able to help you before, right? Come on, I’m desperate here, I seriously don’t want the world to end. I need all the help I can get. Please, I need your skills, I need you to fight the fight in Steve’s place, you’re the only person in the world with that capacity.” Tony pleaded, very much out of character.
They both began laughing and giggling together. At that moment, the waitress brought them their sundae.
The more they moved the more his muscles tensed. He could feel goosebumps emerge as he began to break out in a cold sweat. Bucky looked at him concerned. All Steve could do was give him a look that he hoped convey that he was fine but stay alert. He could not trust his voice; he was sure if he dared to utter a single word it would have come out as a panicked squeak.
The inventor found during the time they spent together that Steve is in every sense a ‘Good Man’. Through the tragic events and unbelievable experiences that led Captain America to this time, Tony was lucky enough to find the ‘man’ underneath the legend. He discovered that despite being born in 1918 and being the most mature and responsible of all of them Steve was by far the youngest, technically he was only 30. To carry so much on his shoulders at such a young age is such a profound burden. At times it is hard for the genius to even fathom the horrors Steve must face daily. Thus his constant awful wit towards the Good Captain.
Nearly a full day had passed and Tony had been locked in his workshop the entire time, mostly manufacturing the devices that would neutralize the hold Calamity has over the people.
The sound of breaking glass shifted to the harrowing sound of cracking ice. Then he felt something shift. The sensation was oddly nauseating like one second he was moving forward at a fast pace than all at once he was moving backwards without slowing or stopping.
“What was it?” The annoying genius drawled out mockingly. “Oh yeah aggressive_cocks.com.” He finished with a triumphant smirk.
“Admittedly my first world that I took was for something as petty as fury, but I discovered so much about myself, so much about my gifts given to me by our great mother and my true purpose. I regret handling the first so brutally but alas it is what it is… The way it should be.” She admitted with a far off look.
“Uh huh, well if you do your job right I should be able to hold in ordinary spatula… With my hand. I won’t need whatever that is.” He said pointedly, gesturing to the screen.
“Better than you’d expect. I think I’m more upset over being kept in the dark than actually be the keystone.” He replied with a bitter twinge.
“Well… Wasn’t that just a lovely cup of sunshine?… The kind of fucked up shit that happens out there.” Being the kind of agents he and Natasha are would make them, on occasion, stumble upon and even experience such predicaments of the like, that would definitely make one question humanity.
That was always one of the things that fascinated him most about Tony Stark, he never knew what was going on in his head. Just when Steve thought he had him figured out Tony, without fail, would pull a 180 on him and he’d have to start all over again. Sometimes he didn’t mind. He loved how Tony was a complicated puzzle like that.
That little utterance of an age old nickname from childhood threw Steve into an all new hurricane of loathsome despairing all-consuming horror. He was about to lose his brother all over again.
“You are lucky he’s awake or I would have you forcibly removed again.” She stated with no room for argument.
“Okay now,” He began. He set the midnight blue down and grabbed the white and a pale rose pink. “I imagine Rocky is definitely the kind of pony who always keeps his golden feathers polished and shiny. So, let’s give him some highlights on his feathers here…” He said as he started to create white lines to bring out the shine of the gold. “… And here.”
It’s blurry and obscured but it appears to be a dark figure holding a rifle of some sort.  He also appeared to have a metal arm.  Whether it’s armor or prostatic was indiscernible.
Peggy laughed. “Yeah, I’m still having trouble believing it and I’ve known about the engagement for a few months now.”
As he gazed at the lone figure in the cell he felt a chill run down his spine. They were bound to a gurney in the middle of the cell not unlike Steve was… Copious amounts of medical equipment weaved around the prisoners many restraints. Tony took and the various medical stats the machines displayed. Tony realized with a start that the prisoner was conscious and staring at the ceiling. The only indication the prisoner made that Tony’s presence was acknowledged was a swiftly deepening frown.
Johnny stiffened beside him and uttered “Sue” under his breath.  His sister must be there.  Steve squeezed his eyes shut.  He swallowed thickly.
Steve had enough. He pushed off the wall with an incredible force that left dents on the surface. He made his way to the middle of the room with absolute abandon and authority. He took one last look around the room full of chaos before,
Hundreds of doom bots were plaguing them. Not just here but all over the world. There were fuzz buzz still littered about and now that Thor was here, they were swarming in, feeding off of his energy. Hell bird eggs were hatching, and the mother was clawing her way out slowly but surely.
Tony took out his phone and looked at it, then groaned as if his very life force was draining away. Everyone still coherent stared at Tony expectantly.
“They all had incredibly tragic pasts.”  Before the various members of his team could indeed start with the carnage, Tony went on to elaborate.
Steve melted in utter relief when he spotted Bucky bound up to them. They were waiting up for him in a random park away from prying eyes near a duck pond. The Captain nearly launched himself off of the bench to greet his friends eager to reassure himself that he had returned to him safely. He stayed put however to ensure that he did not attract any unnecessary attention with rapid movement.
Just as he landed on the street something or someone punched him in the gut, hard. He hit the ground with a roll. He could not see anybody. Suddenly he heard another shot ring out. The pavement next to his face exploded with dust and asphalt particles.
"I just can't accept that! You sound just like every other villain I've ever encountered with a twisted ideal they wanted to force upon the world."
Eventually, however, the nurse led him away back to the waiting room, both to Peggy and Steve's dismay. As much as he wanted to argue with the doctor and figure out a way to stay, even going as far as to plant himself next to Peggy side, (he'd really like to see somebody try to move him) he was acutely aware that causing any amount of problems for the doctors would inadvertently cause problems for Peggy and the baby. If the doctors and nurses were distracted from doing their duty as healthcare physicians then the only thing he would accomplish was risking Peggy and the baby's lives. That was something he most certainly was not going to do, so with a heavy heart he had followed the nurse out. As he was leaving he kept telling her how much he loved her.
“My dear, dear Steven. Look at what they have done to you.” Calamity’s soft voice flitted across his consciousness like a soothing balm.
Tony rolled his eyes internally, ‘Of course Nat can get through to him.’ He thought almost bitterly.
Tony was about to retort when he felt the intense stare of three and a half sets of eyes. He turned to see his team staring at him slack-jawed.
“With your, uh, ‘devise’ did you sense what was happening, did you see who or what did do it?” Steve asked excitedly filled with hope. Could there troubles be over? But before Xavier could answer Fury butted in.
As much as it relieved him to see her well, it also alarmed him to see so much medical equipment attached to her. He was sure he had less during the serum infusion procedure.
He looked up suddenly and realized that it was now day. How long had he been deep in thought for? Why was he so deep in thought? He shook himself, that wasn't important.
Barnes was breathing hard and seemed to be in a daze. He blinked slowly up at Natasha who was holding him up by the shoulders.
Speaking of, Calamity has now claimed 894 people.  The media was going nuts.  The CDC just keeps shaking their heads.  Steve just sighed.  It’s not a disease people.  It’s something far worse.
He did know. Watching Bucky die right before his eyes and not being able to do a damn thing to stop it was by far the worst experience of his life.
The genius then looked up at Calamity and stared deep into her silver eyes that seemed to illuminate like starlight.
make you wish another wayward missile hit you in the nuts again.’ Tony felt that it would be the absolute best opportunity to go see how Bruce and Hank were faring.  So he backed away slowly and b-lined toward the doctors. When he arrived Bruce couldn’t help but to ask…
He put everything he had into reaching for his brother. He watched in desperation as he started moving further and further away as Tony lifted off into the air. He saw a silvery flash as Quicksilver suddenly appeared over Bucky’s prone body briefly before they both disappeared.
The moment Jarvis alerted him of Steve’s escape he thought he could literally feel his heartbreak. He had just gotten done convincing Rhodey to ignore the executive kill order when the alert came through. He was so devastated and angry. He tried hard to keep it together. That was until he had returned to the tower only to find his team in such a sad state of affairs. He buckled down immediately searching every avenue he could to find Steve. To find him so he could shove his fist into his face and demand why.
In a blink of an eye she was nose to nose with him. He felt the heavy, intense force of her presence instantaneously. He swallowed thickly, every fiber of his being was screaming at him to run away, fast and far, far away from this dangerous creature before him. He stood his ground however, somehow.
Steve, on his mindless journey to find solace, happened upon yet another familiar face. Natasha, ever observant as she is, knew what Steve’s intent was and gave him a glare that could make any man’s balls twist away in fear and agony at just a glance. Luckily, Captain America wasn’t any man. The glare did have an effect mind you but not to the horrifying neutering extent. Message read loud and clear, Steve b-lined down a different corridor in hopes of at least seeking out Clint only to discover that the crazy bird was nowhere to be found.
They had seconds at the most because he was coming in fast and hot. The Captain turned swiftly to the twins.
Barnes nodded solemnly. He clenched and unclenched his fist in order to stay calm. He knew Tony was up to something.
Coulson was about to explode from awe and giddiness.   There was nothing like watching his all-time hero step up and take control. If Steve commanded him to jump off the helicarrier sans parachute he would without a second thought because most assuredly The Captain would turn around and save him.
Steve smiled. "Yeah, don't you worry. I can handle it. Plus, it's Friday, the best day of the week."
"You wanna fucking know how it fucking went? Fine!" In another spectacular display of word vomit, Tony quickly got Barnes up to speed on exactly what had transpired in Steve's dreamscape mind reality.
After them the Fantastic 4 lost half of their group, Sue and Reed fell leaving Ben and Johnny utterly devastated.  Johnny had isolated himself to the window, staring outside completely unconcerned for anything else.  Steve wished desperately that he could join him, to check out and watch idly as the clouds rolled by.
She sighed, "Because, we are all connected through Yggdrasil yet at the same time completely disconnected. These past eons as the universe expands, we have all been slowly pulling apart. I want to reconnect us.
“Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, so you’re saying anyone of us could be next?”  Clint inquired trying to subdue his own panic.
The only warning he got that all hell was breaking loose was the sound of his shield hitting the rough asphalt. He turned around immediately at the sound of ringing vibranium only to have the sight that greeted him make his heart drop. Bucky was staring shocked at the many tranquilizer darts sticking out of his right arm and shoulder. Several Shield agents were closing in from designated locations. Before he could address the new threat he instantly found himself reacquainted with the pavement yet again. Tony plowed him into the road. He looked up in time to see War Machine land not a few yards away, weapons ready.
It was the hardest thing I ever had to do, No, scratch that, I think this is the hardest thing I'll ever have to do…"
“I don’t know what you think was going on but that man loved you! He was hurting!” She shouted harshly as fresh tears fell from her face. “I know this whole thing is messy and you’re hurt and angry right now, but you need to pull your head out of your ass for one God damn second and figure this out!”
Tony looked around the battlefield trying to find the source. He honestly did not know what to think when he spotted the psychotic bunny trying to square up to Steve about 500 meters left of the rift.
Tony shifted Steve in his arms so that he was carrying him bridal style. The Captain groaned painfully at the movement.
He saw that he was starting to create a scene, nurses were coming to see what the commotion was, but he didn't care. Something unnatural was happening and he needed to figure it out.
Johnny could barely watch the scene before him. Hot prickly tears started to flow down his face also.
Steve removed his hands from the dough and wiped them on his apron.  He grabbed Johnny shoulder and looked him in the eye.
There was something familiar about the woman that Steve couldn’t quite put his finger on. But she seemed kind and humble. Suddenly she stopped playing and looked over to her right.
Tony was so absorbed in shock and horror that he didn’t notice the flash, thus he couldn’t pinpoint the exact moment Captain America’s shield whipped past him and pierced the mother’s forehead. The screams of agony from that foul creature were deafening. Tony whipped around at the source of the throw only to see Steve whirl around and hurl a dead doom bot straight at the mother. The robot hit her square in the middle of the forehead forcing the shield in further and thoroughly embedding it deep within her skull.
She giggled. Ellie snuggled into his arms more as he gently sat down not wanting to hurt her or spill the coffee.
Tony’s blood ran cold when he recalled the numerous times he had nearly killed the soldier. The genius had loathed, detested and hated him, wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. Would have been utterly glad to be the one to dispose of Hydra’s lapdog. What were the odds that after everything, every single fucking thing, that he would befriend the soldier and earn his trust enough for Barnes to pass on information he thought had become completely irrelevant. Apparently, 0.5%.
In that moment Tony fully realized just how true that was. It had dawned on him the full extent of Calamity’s planning. The hexilien algorithm was so top secret and secure that it was likely never written down and those who knew it have long since perished. The algorithm thus became lost to the throes of time. It was entirely possible that Barnes was the only person in the entire world who knew it. And Calamity planned it that way.
"Somebody's got it take that fucker out." Tony groaned intending to get back to the code. If he could only take control of the army of doom bots, maybe they could win this.
“We heard you had gotten hurt badly that day, we wanted to see you in the hospital but no one was allowed in.”  Maggie’s father said sadly.
Bucky Barnes slowly turned his head best he could despite the restraints and injuries. His expression was dark and serious.
“Tell Director Fury that Hank and I must make haste back to New York,” he paused for a moment nearly unable to get the last of his sentence out.
Bucky new that was utter horseshit but nodded anyway. He knew there was no arguing with him. However, he was most certainly not getting on that jet no matter what that punk says. He knows his place is right next to Steve. Wanda gave him a knowing look; she knew what he was planning.
Okay, Barnes was not cooperating just like he thought. He’d feel like the scum of the earth, even more so than he does now, but he could threaten him with the journal. It could also backfire spectacularly. He could also try and figure out how to use the journal, however, he was sure Steve would never forgive him for that. No matter where he was.
"No, this is merely the remanence of the world I created." She said. "All you see now is the influence of my power, nothing more."
“An uncivilized one!” Tony retorted with benign venom. Bucky watched him queerly. “Never mind. Just hang tight while I try another variation and set up some programs. You’re welcome to as much coffee as you want, just don’t drink straight from the pot.” Tony warned almost wild eyed.
He backed up against the far wall of the roof.  He breathed deeply and set his sights on the seventh story window and broke into a sprint.  He pushed his sore aching body passed its limits. He put every last bit of energy into his legs willing them to move faster and faster until he made it to the end.  He sprang off of the ledge with a force that was excruciating.  He felt his legs burn miserably as his muscles tore and tendons popped.
Peggy fought the urge to roll her eyes and instead smiled affectionately. “Don’t worry, I’ll write it down for you.” She said as she began to make her way downstairs.
He looked at the open window and gauged the distance.  The more he stared the blurrier it got.  He felt woozy and lightheaded.  He shook his head and took a deep breath.  There was a chill in the air now and the slight breeze tickled the hairs on his body that were standing on end from the electrical charge.  Night was falling.
It felt the same way the first time he saw her cry. It was almost enough to sway him. But he thought back to why he was doing this. He shook his head.
Both slept completely through the night and most of the morning for once. Their slumber may not have been entirely restful, considering, but sleep they did.
Tony blanched and felt all of the hope and positivity that was generated from finally solving the code completely disintegrate into putrid ash. His hands clenched into fists over his knees and hot treacherous tears sprang to his eyes. The floodgates to his dark emotions sprang open wide.
Steve sighed to himself.  Tony was going to strip him of all access after this.  Oh well.  Well not ‘oh well’ it was gonna suck.  They would probably chain him to the walls after this.  But he is not gonna sit back when there might be something he could do to help.
The tree was large and he noted a rope swing with a rough plank of wood swaying gently with the wind on the other side. Upon the next breath he took he detected the sweet scent of roses. There must be a blush nearby.
Just over the Rhododendron's left shoulder he could see Captain America's shield come in at an alarming speed. Barnes must have thrown it with his left arm. At the rate it was going it would lop the bunny's head clean off and continue on for miles more. And because of Tony's close proximity to the bunny he was able to see the exact moment when the Rhododendron's hidden force field suit activated, making the shield bounce off him harmlessly and sail over a few blocks, several thousand meters away.
“Come on where is it?”  Steve was looking around at all of Tony’s hidden compartments.  He had spent enough time in his lab to know how the genius operates.
"I'm sorry for asking but what is that? It's been bugging me for a while now." He said pointing to the device over his heart.
After that Tony decided that it was time for a well-deserved break. He said that it was still a major drawback because of the electromagnetic headache the device caused. He was definitely going to look into that a bit more later.
“Tell me!” Tony demanded again, waving the wand over a sensitive spot by his shoulder blade, forcing the soldier to bark out a laugh as he lunged for the wand again.
This is where Natasha found him sometime later with his head on his desk groaning aloud, almost whimpering.
The soldier was examining the arm, moving it this way and that, testing his mobility and dexterity before the genius spoke up.
Brock turned to Bucky, livid. Bucky knew it was a bad idea to fuck with the guy. He could feel that he was a talented fighter but he also knew the guy was a hothead with an ego. If Bucky can keep him riled up then it would give Stark time to get them out of there.
It took months of epic shouting matches, intense stand offs, inappropriate pranks and in Tony’s case a well deserved punch in the face for Steve to realize that the crazy genius just functions that way. Thinking back on Tony’s swollen purple face after that particular punch made the Captain calm down immensely and go back into leader mode.
“I don’t know, if it earns me more points, I think I can dig some more up.” He said tapping the side of his head.
Steve’s mind froze solid at the genius’s unexpected suggestion then shot out a thousand different ways at once.
“I do.” Barnes replied. “I paid attention when they experimented on me. In the beginning, I had hoped to learn everything I could, then escape and bring back the information to our allies. I never did get the escape part of the plan right.” He joked humorlessly.
Steve resisted the urge to roll his eyes. He had to play nice. He had to make sure none of them caught onto his plans.
The others nodded and Bruce groaned resting his head in his hands. Natasha patted him on the back reassuringly.
He tried to think of anything that he said that could be misinterpreted. He was on his best behavior, however, and again if he said anything stupid Steve would have called him out on it. He eventually came to the conclusion that Calamity must have interfered somehow. For the life of him Tony could not figure out when the shift happens. There was a moment when the team was gearing up that Steve sat quietly by himself in his room but he seemed to do that often.
“Ok well, our victims here Gloria Smith number 74 and Jimmy Smith number 75 grew up in Shore Springs Alabama were they spent most of their child hood until their mother Bethany Rose Smith drowned in the bath tub. She left behind her husband George Smith and two kids a thirteen-year-old Gloria and an eight-year-old Jimmy.
"I'm so sorry about everything. I know you hate me and this doesn't even come close to making up for what I did to you but I promise not to give up. I promise I'll find a way to keep it together and to keep going and do absolutely everything in my power to keep the world safe, okay?... I-I have to go now, there's some bad guys doing bad things and I got a go stop them. The… The thing is, you won't be here when I get back. So, this… this is… Goodbye…"
“True.” Barnes agreed. The soldier methodically rubbed each temple again before running his hand through his hair. He let out a shuddering breath before continuing. “Did you try the hexilien format algorithm?” He inquired, gesturing to the code.
They sat in fragile silence for a bit, staring at the sky. The stars shining like precious diamonds.
Please leave me a review and let me know what you think! All questions, comments, and theories welcome!
Peggy stretched her back out, making her belly protrude out far and Steve nearly gushed at the sight.
“I am not your pet, I am not a toy to be manipulated! I will not spend the rest of my life getting my heart ripped out over and over again. This is my life! My choice, and I choose to save my brother!” He shouted at her as he yanked a concealed device out of his pocket and pressed the button.
He also showed her all of the wonderful things too. He showed her life with his new family, the Avengers. He showed her all of his teams oddities and eccentricities and he also showed her Tony, the real Tony. He showed the beautiful man he found beneath the money, fame and bad attitude. He showed her the man he fell in love with, the profound and compassionate and generous person hid away from everyone.
“What do you m-mean?” He whispered harshly. His first thought was that she was going to turn back time. But that wasn’t possible, was it?
At that time, I pulled away from the other sentient beings and pursued the answers to my deepest questions. Eventually that led me to the deepest depths of the universe itself and I found that Yggdrasil was the answer to everything…
“’My, your mind is like an open book. The very aura of your mind…truly outstanding. It is hard to find a man with such a humble nature and pure intent in these current times.’” Xavier spoke to Steve within his mind.
There was a chill in the air Steve noted as he made his way out the door for his morning run.  He was the first one awake that morning as far as he could tell.  He was thankful, he did not have the nerve to face anybody right now.
He needed to get back up the stairs for a moment to hear what was happening. When he reached the top of the steps his blood turned cold. He could see out the window that there were thousands of the zappers roaming outside. There were a few floating around inside the house. Steve watched as a couple managed to squeeze through the little nook and crannies along the doors and windows and pop up the other side.
Steve brought his other arm up to wrap around Tony.  He was desperately holding on.  He held them both as tightly as he could, very much well aware of the reality that he could lose them any time now, any moment could be their last.  That hurt in ways he cannot even describe.
Sam had joined Rhodey just beyond the containment field. He, Rhodey and Clint could do nothing but watch on in horror.
She appraised them exasperatedly, then sighed. She walked to the table and grabbed the scanner then pointed it to Tony.
A/N: Yay! And so another one has come and gone. This was something of a filler but no less important. We’ve got some nice action coming up next chapter and eventually the dreaded confrontation of Tony and Bucky. We’re also going to find out exactly what happened to the twins. So please, stay tuned for the next chapter.
Tony breathed a mental sigh of relief when just as Barnes’s grip slipped off of the cable, Steve grabbed his metal wrist. Both were being sucked into the pseudo-void now.
Steve sighed as he took his seat again. Ellie climbed onto his lap and buried her face in his chest. He took a deep breath to calm his nerves and began to rub her back soothingly. That strange hazy feeling wouldn't go away and he could feel something gnawing at him. Some long hidden buried thought trying to claw its way to the forefront of his mind.
He sighed then continued his explanation. “But last night was different, after you left Natalia came to me. She had made some equally good points and somehow I fell asleep.” He thought hard for a moment “actually, she may have knocked me out, but somehow the result was… cathartic.” He mused. “When I woke up I- I felt… better. Things just seemed clearer somehow.” He tried to convey with a painful smile.
The drawing depicted a sunny day illuminating an old country house with a large oak tree that had an old fashioned rope swing with a plank of wood as its seat.  It had a large yard, large enough for children and pets to play freely.  The land was bordered with a white picket fence that had various rosebushes lining its path.  It was a picture of the age old vision of the American dream, truly picturesque.
Tony bent to pick it up. It was another handwritten note. Not Steve’s handwriting, however. Tony looked up, suddenly realizing it was from the man in the cell before him. The genius read it over, his eyes widening at its contents.
The translator nodded desperately and began to glance through the book.  If it were even possible he became even more terrified.
Charles and Hank looked at the ‘Out of Time’ young man in awe. The Dr. could definitely see why this man was the leader, the Captain of their group.
"Daddy, look!" She shouted pointing at a toy store window. "It's Princess Avalon of the Mystic Realm!" She cried excitedly, pointing at a beautiful fantasy-esque doll with gold hair wearing an armor/Princess-dress hybrid type thing. Steve noted that she came with a shield and sword.
“No No No! None of that!! We just nearly kissed!” Steve quickly put his hands to his lips shocked that actually telling her.
The next two days were an all new level of emotionally fractured chaos.  Steve had to sit through hours of Tony and the rest of his team reprimanding him for getting involved.
Her heavenly expression morphed into a glare at Steve’s sudden outburst. He held his hands up placatingly in surrender, still unable to suppress his snickers.
He was this close to stabbing and going ape shit on everybody. Oh was he ever going to give that stupid stupid suicidal idiot a piece of his mind. He was so mad right now. At every one!
Calamity took a deep breath and seemed to be containing her emotions, then spoke. "In that case, I will offer you this one last bargain." She suggested almost slyly. "If you offer to me your soul right now, I give you my word that I will reunite you two after the harvest. The two of you together for all eternity? Deal?"
“Hey, look at me.” Tony said as he gently grabbed Steve’s face. “You can trust me.” He said softly caressing his face. “I will find him, I promise.”
"Sure, you keep thinking that." Tony grunted as they slowly made their way to the pile of robot corpses.
"Pag ra arta launer a nuke" Steve tried to repeat but failed miserably. He felt quite sheepish and contrite.
“Yeah, you used to spend mighty long hours in there. Not so much anymore though.” She stated simply.
Steve smiled and nodded. Captain America and the Thing shared similar sentiments about one Johnny Storm.
Steve could vaguely hear Natasha and Clint shout for him, they sounded so far away. He couldn’t clearly see his foe any longer, his vision becoming dark. Darker and darker. He thought he might lose consciousness or worse any moment.
Steve felt lighter. Just a few laughs is just what he needed to alleviate the stress. Despite being a super soldier, stressing out over the past week still took its toll. He was willing to bet the Professor knew what he was going through, he could read his mind after all, he also knew just what he needed. Steve was willing to bet Tony did too.
The hole was so strong now that it was sucking in whole cars, larger debris and doom bots and zappers at an alarming velocity.
Steve’s first instinct was to give him a scathing reply. However, he refrained. He had to start playing this real delicately now. He could not let anyone know what he was planning, especially Tony. So he merely shrugged in response. He did not miss the fact that Tony was no longer wearing his fancy suit.
Tony elects to help Barnes. That is until he discovers a dark secret about the Soldier that could threaten his very existence.
Tony shook his head, desperately trying to cling on to the denial. Trying to reject the reality of responsibility.
“Car accident.  I think I look pretty damn good considering.  I asked you five here specifically because I need people who I can trust.”
Steve was not gonna lie.  It hurt, it hurt like hell.  And that’s saying a lot considering everything he’s been through the last couple weeks.  As the others conversed amiably together, Steve silently and stealthily left to go back to his studio.
A/N: Hey guys, sorry for the long wait. I wanted to get this out before Infinity War premiered but important things just kept popping up that took my attention away from this. But here it is now!
Tony frowned when he realized that the mother kept shoving eggs through the hole even when part of herself was wedged in the opening. He did not know if her presence would hinder the holes closure. This sort of thing was all new to him. In theory, because the hole wasn't technically physical like, for example, an ordinary doorway, the portal, being spatial and dimensional, could simply close around her or even through her. Unfortunately, Tony did not know either way. Again, all new experience.
“Essentially. Ironically, I had developed the technology to do it months ago before any of this even began. Bi-Neuraly Augmented Retro-Framing.” Tony answered tiredly.
He had gathered a few paint bottles and a water bucket and set them on the window seal of his chosen room. He set up his easel and a blank canvas. He quickly painted a rough blue background. Jane and Darcy had always been fascinated and drawn to this painting. This time was no different. They slowly approached him to see what he was working on. He smiled gently at them.
“Man, what is going on?  It looks like you’ve seen a ghost.”  Clint asked getting even more worried.
Lunch was a hit. The conversation flowed easily between them all and even Ellie was a large participant. Howard was sorry to hear that Steve was in the middle of another episode but assured him that it will pass.
The genius raged internally. It was instances like this where Steve was invaluable. As a master of strategy and combat he could figure out how to stop these guys easily. Yet another reason on top of so many as to why he desperately missed the man he loved and wished for nothing more than to have him by his side. No one could lead this team the way Captain America could. Iron Man could sometimes in a pinch, but in a situation like this? It was painfully obvious that Tony could not possibly measure up. His mind, and as incredible and possibly unequaled as it is, was not built for this. As he had stated on numerous occasions, he was not soldier.
And so it was that humans, mutants and aliens alike for the first time stood together under one incredible banner, Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers.
"Indeed. And that's far from the end of it. Even then you still wholly resisted my pull. Your mind and resolved were as strong and indestructible as your vibranium shield. Your body, so enhanced, kept your mind stable. So, when the opportunity arose, I took away your ability to heal. I then put a wall in your mind so no other could interfere."
“I agree.” Said Natasha. “I got the impression that she pretty much has the capacity to do nearly anything. If she wanted to destroy any information we already have, all she would have to do a snap her fingers.”
“We can’t think of her as a normal villain. Hell she isn’t a villain at all but something else entirely.” Clint wanted to protest the Steve continued.
“Unfortunately, I must also apologize for the second reason I am here today.”  She conveyed at last, backing away solemnly.  “I’m afraid I have been distracting you.  It was an impressive and valiant idea to bring in your Allies and rally against me.  It was certainly the best course of action to take, considering.”
Bucky cleaned the wounds the best he could with the little supplies they had but it was good enough. Steve watched him entranced. He gaped at his brother’s concentrated process. He had allowed himself to fall into a strange world of nostalgia. Bucky took care of him just like this most of his life. He always had that air of reverence, care and conviction. Steve marveled at how his eyes were just the same as they always had been, filled with tenderness and determination. To have come full circle and end up back in this position with his brother caring for his broken body was truly a bittersweet miracle.
Unlike Hank, Tony’s departure was noticed.  Steve felt every single step he walked away.  His heart shuddered in agony the moment Tony was no longer in the room.  Natasha and Clint were successful in recapturing his attention as they began to tell him in excruciating detail everything that happened that day.
Morning came sooner than what Steve was ready for. To think he spent the night thinking of Bucky when hundreds of people were now in an incurable coma that the ancient alien Calamity had put on them. Calamity was planning on taking every soul, not just Earth, but from the entire universe. Great, now he hates himself just a little bit more today.
The pressure was off his neck but metal hands now grabbed his broken torso he almost thought the bot was going in to finish the job. He struggled as he moaned miserably before he heard a familiar voice that made him calm instantly and smiled broadly despite himself.
Even if it was just for a moment, he needed to settle things with Tony, he absolutely could not leave things as they were.
Although, at first he was morbidly satisfied to hear that he was not the only one to get zapped by these things. He hated to think that way but after a few more zaps he found it harder to care. That was until the electromagnetic fields created by these critters interfered too much with the main com line. Steve found that he could only communicate directly to one team member at a time after that.
Steve woke with a start. He been having the same dream over and over for the past week. At least he thought he did. Every time he tried to think about it, the dream faded away and he could no longer recall any details. There was one thing he did know for sure, however, the dreams always consisted of the same mysterious man. In his dreams, this mysterious man was actually the person wearing the strange futuristic suit of armor. Unfortunately, Steve could never remember what he looked like. He kept a sketchbook on the bedside table hoping that he could quickly sketch out his features before they faded away with the last lingering vestiges of slumber.
Steve sighed heavily as he slowly moved the Coney Island portrait off of the easel.  He allowed himself a moment to get lost in his emotions, his sorrow before carefully setting the painting aside.  He placed the blank canvas he just made on the easel and proceeded to stare at it.  He was like that for nearly half an hour before Jarvis brought him out of his thoughts by alerting him of a visitor.
Those were merely simulations however, now they are on an actual mission. Let’s keep our fingers crossed.
Tony continued watching as Steve hobbled back to his medical room. Tony showed up sometime later a tad disheveled himself now sporting casual wear.
In the past, it was damn near impossible to analyze the doom bot code because Von Doom had some impressive safeguards on his bots. It was impossible to salvage any data from real doom bots. The OS would self-destruct when the bot was disabled or defeated. If Tony managed to stop the code from self-destructing, he would then encounter an encryption that was oh so deliciously complicated.
“But, in doing so you created a grand beacon for me to follow and I can ignore it no longer.”  Her brow furrowed in dismay and her entire tone expressed ominous regret.
Hawkeye was nearly out of arrows. Peter remained absolutely resolute in protecting the containment field. As far as he could tell, from the last transmissions he had gotten from the coms, the rest of his team were dismally scattered. Widow was still handling the evac and Rhodey had finally removed the dead suit. He and Sam were trying to aid the first responders in recovering the dead and wounded, pulling them off the streets and hopefully out of harm’s way.
“You have a hearing aid?” Clint asked incredulously. Clearly miffed at not knowing such an important piece of information about a supposed friend.
He nodded to Wanda to indicate that she should be on alert from here on in. It did not escape Tony’s notice how the soldier stiffened seemingly to physically brace himself. The moment Tony did turn the device on, however, Bucky went ramrod straight. After a moment, he relaxed and began to fiddle with the screen again.
Of course Tony knew. Reading and understanding the things in that journal is what made him want to aid the bastard in the first place. Hydra went through such extents to control him because if Barnes really had the choice he would either kill the whole lot of them or himself over being ordered to kill an innocent person. Deep down Tony knew this. Barnes was absolutely loyal to someone like Captain America after all. Hydra knew they could not compete with that.
Meanwhile, on the Quin jet Natasha and Clint were receiving some very interesting information from Fury regarding their strange alien case.  They looked at each other and smiled at the information it was certainly good news.  Now all they had to do is wait for Steve to secure the facility.
“Really? You’re going to call language on me right now?” Bucky replied incredulously. “Well how about fuck you! Fuck, fuck fuckitie fuck you fucking punk!” He cursed, challenging Steve. His cocky smirk widened significantly.
Entertaining was one way to describe the chaos that descended upon the Raft when Tony Stark decided that it would be a good idea to break James Buchanan Barnes, prisoner 86, out of prison.
Tony rolled his eyes. He had already considered this. The thing that blows their theory out of the water, however, was the fact that she created little niches of heaven for all her victims. He had looked into the minds of many of them and each one had their own little perfect world best suited each person perfectly. And in Steve's perfect world, Tony didn't exist. Plain and simple.
“This thing that we now presume to be an alien, a creature that out of anything and everything in this entire world, we know the least about. An Alien that, of course, we know nothing about could very well be completely impervious to anything and everything we dish out to it. It is undetected by our best technology. How would we fight it?” The Captain paused for a moment to allow the weight of his words to pierce through everybody’s minds.
“A memory. That was one of my favorite memories of my mother, Sarah Maria Stark.” Tony replied quietly.
He still couldn’t understand why people just didn’t take his word for it, that he still had to explain the process of how he got there.  Why couldn’t people just take his word for it and move on?
The blanket was turned to ash instantaneously and Iron Man was closing in on him rapidly. Steve lunged to the left and targeted a flight stabilizer on the armors right dorsal area. He’d have to slow Tony down piece by piece if he had to. Unfortunately, Tony was expecting it or Jarvis saw through his movements. Iron Man grabbed his shield and yanked it away tossing it aside.
Steve recoiled as the soldier punched him in the gut with his left arm.  He hadn’t felt that awful sensation in years. It was infinitely more harsh than the what the doom bot had unleashed upon him.  The soldier took the opportunity to kick the Captain in the face sending him flying back.  The soldier was on him pummeling his face in before he could recover.  Steve managed to throw him and reversed their positions using his shield to beat at his face.  The impact fractured the lens of the mask.
Steve took a sharp intake of air as his chest tightened. He was going to die soon. There really was nothing he could do… However…
What did it have to do with destroying the core? The core of a devise that could cause so much pain…
How in fucking hell did the Rhododendron know all about this dimensional creature? How did he even get his hands on the technology needed to open a portal to the exact place he wanted?
The genius has had many nightmares revolving around his loss of control over his own technology. He can’t predict and guard against everything, but he was damn well going to try.
Though he meant 'us' as in all of humanity, the whispered emphasis he put into that single word spoke volumes more of what he really felt deep in his heart.
He knew the Captain was trying to lighten the mood with a joke, but it was downright horrible.  So he then proceeded to tell him so.
He sighed. Between Ellie and Peggy there was no way to win. He could feel his own pout coming on. Peggy only laughed.
“Spiderman is down. He’s with Natasha on the outskirts. I talked to Tony, a second team is heading our way!”
After two cups of coffee and three more failed algorithms, Tony sat back and sighed and proceeded to turn to goo in his chair. Barnes had been watching him entirely fascinated. He was completely mesmerized and awed by Tony’s capacity to code so rapidly.
Without any warning he grabbed Natasha and threw her against the wall opposite of the window. He pinned her with his shield.
“Okay, I can destroy them but it’s going to hurt and it’s going to be scary. Okay? There are others on the way that are going to help us but we need to get out of the city.”
“I didn’t know you bastards were that ruthless, sons of bitches!” He shouted at them before looking back down at Victor. He began to kick the doctors body around and then spat on him.
He tore open the bin and began to pull out clothes. When he hit the bottom he cheered. There they were, rubber rain coats.
“You always forget things when you get sick. Mama said you were getting better and that you haven’t been sick for a while. I… I was hoping you were really better.” She said sadly.
After everything that has happened he needs Steve to understand that Tony is on his side. And maybe Pepper is a little right, maybe. He really would like to throw caution into the wind and just give in to his most deepest and most sacred desires. His desire to love and be loved in return. He was so exhausted from hiding away all the time. And Pepper was definitely right about one thing. There wasn’t much time left and at the very least Steve deserved to know that he was loved. Even if, in the end, Tony would end up… well... broken and alone.
Steve laughed, “Of course I'll show you. Mind you it’s not much yet.” Steve said standing from his seat.
Then he turned to Steve and eyed him warily knowing that the next few hours for that man are going to be hell.
Tony sighed then proceeded to bang his head on the table dramatically. He turned his head to the side and stared at the crystal. There were petabytes of information on that thing. The way to create a program, a device to undo her work, to save everyone, is on it. If only he could read it.
Johnny let out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding. That caught the kids’ attention and they gasped in realization that this strange new man had a striking resemblance to Captain America. Before they could respond Steve interjected.
Tony quickly took out his phone.  “I…  I have no connection.”  He uttered in desperation.  “Jarvis?!”  He shouted desperately.
For the next hour Steve mentally prepared himself for what he had to do. Most of his team left on the mission to capture the Winter Soldier.
“I know right?  It looks almost familiar somehow, can’t quite put my finger on it.”  Steve said as he also viewed his glass in wonder.
Right now they are all on the helicarrier coming up with viable plans to better handle the situation.
It was about an hour ago that he had connected the odd feeling he had gotten earlier while staring at the moon to the feeling he had gotten listening to that particular heart monitor. There was something all too familiar about this situation that it was completely unnerving.
His trek into town wasn't as bad as he thought it was going to be. Hell, he had marched all over Europe during the war. Nothing could stop him. A scenic walk into town was nothing. When he did it as a child while he stayed with his grandmother it usually left him horribly winded, the walk triggering his asthma. He guessed there was a significant amount of sense memory that triggered old fears before the serum.
Steve stood back a ways.  Johnny was trying desperately to calm her.  Then the worst happened.  Just as she was about to go into another fit of hysterics she stopped suddenly and collapsed over Reed’s body.
She laughed, “You keeping that child occupied while I prepared dinner is help enough. Now go on, go spend time with her.”
The sound of the gun impacted his broken body like a shock wave. He glanced as much as his fading body could muster to see the fat man fall to his knees slowly. The look of utter shock was still written on his dead face and the bullet hole between his eyes gushed blood before he face planted into the pavement with a sickening gurgle.
He had also used the opportunity a computer yielded to reconnect with Jarvis. The connection was tenuous as it predicated on weak and insubstantial Wi-Fi signals. There wasn't much he could have Jarvis do from here, however, he could find out about the new suit that was supposed to be coming his way.
The bus ride into town was uneventful and Ellie mostly had eyes for her new doll. Steve may had been a tad jealous. They had grabbed a quick ice cream cone this time because Steve wanted to finish all their errands before it got dark. Ellie didn't mind at all.
"Mr. Stark!" SpiderMan landed next to them suddenly. "Wand- I mean Scarlet Witch said you might need this." He said handing Tony a laptop.
It would still suck in anything that got too close; however, it was not strong enough to suck them all in.
“Now let’s continue, come on people we are here for a reason. From what we have gathered what are the possible causes? Professor Xavier, what is your opinion?” The Director asked Charles, his unspoken question if a mutant is behind this crazy chaos lingered in the air unsaid.
Only Captain America and Iron Man remained on their feet. Steve realized with a start that this was the first time encountering Calamity face-to-face for most of his team.
When Jarvis confirmed the identity of their masked assailant as the long-lost James Buchanan Barnes, he knew Steve likely would stop at nothing to find him. Broken body and all. So, Tony has Jarvis keeping a lookout for him.
“The key is to wake everyone up simultaneously. After I gauge what’s going on in their minds, I’ll sync everybody together on a timer and release them all at once. And before you ask what would happen if she stops me or retaliates, the answer is: it doesn’t fucking matter because we were all fucked from the start trying to fight against an alien that is basically a celestial God.” The genius replied snappily.
Steve admonished himself or not thinking of that. Ellie must've dropped Princess Avalon in her sleep, she did not have her with her when he scooped her up. He thought of her shoes but not if she had her doll.
Her brother nodded in agreement. Bucky almost made to decline Steve’s offer before the Captain shot him a look that screamed, ‘If you do not eat now I will personally shove it down your throat.’
They all knew, each and every one of them, that coming out of this current plight unscathed was surely impossible. However they then and there swore to each other that they were all in it together, to the end.
He threw his arms around Steve to steady his fall. Tony held the Captain's limp form tightly against his armor.
Probably, the thing about this that is the most frightening is the fact that this is not looking like usual bad guy behavior. Where is the demand? Where’s the order for the obscene amount of money, or control over the world? This soon to be mission is already a headache underway. Tony, with his head ever so slightly still inflated quickly added the part about his ‘space phone’.
“Look at you, Tony Stark, completely at my mercy.” Rhododendron said as he began moving the suit around. In minutes he had figured out how to operate the flight stabilizers. He began flying Iron Man around the area like a toy.
Their attempt at a relocation merely found them on the nearest couch not thirty feet from the balcony. Steve sat down and pulled Tony onto his lap, making him straddle his thighs. The genius began rocking, creating delicious friction that made them both moan wantonly.
He nodded. This whole time he assumed that she intended to tear his body apart. They all kind of assumed that. He and his team had been so frayed and on edge that they hadn’t considered the alternative. And because of that they had all played into her hand beautifully. He had a feeling that Bucky knew exactly what she really meant, however. He tried to warn Steve but our dear Captain wouldn’t listen.
Finally, in the far right back corner of the barn where once a stable resided, was his makeshift studio. He b-lined for it, taking in a woodworking station just off to the side. It was likely where he created the canvases. He walked into the area and observed several canvases covered in cloth. There were maybe ten or twelve of them. He gently uncovered the work he created with great care and took in their visage with a critical eye.
“Yeah, don’t leave the part meant for them behind. Not like they’re as lost and confused as you were.” Barnes muttered sarcastically.
Tony flirts with him but he’s been known to flirt with a lot of people.  He knows that the genius cares about him, enough to put him through this mess of a house arrest and keeping him in the dark.  God he is so lost and confused.
“And you think he wouldn’t have stopped it if he could? Tony, you chose to stop. You had a choice, the whole time. You could have stopped manufacturing any time but you didn’t. You could have figured it out sooner but you didn’t. You chose to ignore the signs. That’s the difference between you and him. You always had the choice, he didn’t. He never had the choice.” Her words cut deep as her voice cracked.
It's eyes, however, Tony decided, were the most horrific of all. He could just barely see them within what at first appeared to be wide empty sockets. They were opaque white, seemingly un-seeing and yet all seeing at the same time. Its appearance paired with its looming odor, like rotting corpses, made this creature the personification of death.
The waitress had bright red hair pinned up in thick pin curls, even redder lips, and was wearing a black polkadot dress with an apron. Her name tag read Beth.
“You should have just let me handle it from the start.” Tony replied coldly, the robotic overlay on his voice from the suit making him sound all the more icy.
He made his way to the indicated portal and let himself in. As he entered the pressurized equalization chamber he removed the suit according to procedures and in minutes was met with a couple of officials.
“I don’t know! If I did maybe I wouldn’t be in this mess.” Steve was exasperated. He really didn’t know. “It just happened. I didn’t even see it coming. The realization just hit me several weeks ago.”
He shook his head in an attempt to alleviate the strange hazy feeling that was wrapped around his mind. He knew without a shadow of a doubt he had forgotten something important again.
“The most complex coding on earth right now is Jarvis. That is Jarvis.” He pointed to the display. “He is currently just over 100 TB and growing.” He began to adjust the display. “This?” He holds up the thumb drive Calamity gave him. “Is this.”
“Come on, let’s get this kitchen cleaned up. And since you love doing the dishes so much, I’ll let you do them.” She smirked.
“Yeah, okay that’s all bad except, oh yeah, the world ending. Did you forget?” Tony replied helping Bucky out of the rest of the suit.
That bastard rabbit could do it with his suit and all the things the suit had access to. The look of fear on his friends faces, as the suit closed in on them, further cemented his decision. There was no other option. He had created safeguards, firewalls and protocols alike to ensure this could not happen. Yet, they all failed like a horrible nightmare come true. All because of that ridiculous radar gun on steroids.
“As I said before there is no time to explain everything but I will tell you this; I want access to all the souls, every single one in the entire universe.” Everyone stiffened at her admission.
Natasha maneuvered the jet over the bots that were throwing various vehicles around.  She opened the bay doors and Steve jumped out.
“I’m sorry, but you’re making it sound like we don’t risk our lives for living.  It’s not like you’re a super secret special agent or nothing, Huh bird boy?”  Tony came in with his brand of snark.
Tony watched him sadly. The kicker was he knew exactly how the man felt. He couldn’t help but wonder what Steve would say to him. Steve could probably figure out just the right thing to say that would break through to Barnes and somehow make him really understand his true value. He sighed heavily. And there he goes, wishing Steve were there again. When did he become so God damned dependent on him?
The Soldier was now even more worried considering Tony had not acknowledged his joke with a quip of his own. Then again, this situation could hardly be any more strained.
This situation was all too familiar. Didn’t she deck him not a week or so ago her being an insensitive jerk?
Just as he was soldering a wire in place on what would be the 1257th device he felt a presence and a shadow loom over him. He looked up to find Barnes looking down at him pensively.
Something broke in his mind as tears began to spill. He began his onslaught again and again screaming brokenly, “You’re! My! Mission!” His metal hand making contact on each word for emphasis.
In a highly secure underground compound deep in the heart of a restless city a slender figure flitted through the halls urgently.
“Come on then.”  Tony sighed as he gestured for Steve to follow him back into the lab.  His snarky brand of attitude was ever present.
Tony only looked at him sadly and shook his head.  Now that he was finally face to face with Tony since he woke up in recovery, he could see now how haggard the genius was.  He looked like he has lost a few pounds and had even fewer nights of sleep.  Whatever was happening was bad.
“Oh no you don’t!” Countered Natasha as she clamped her fingers onto Steve’s left ear pulling him all the way in.
He slowly opened it, dreading what may lie upon those pages. He swallowed thickly and removed the letter. He immediately recognized Steve’s handwriting. He skimmed over the first page realizing with guilt that they were sincere apologies to the team, specifically those he hurt directly in his escape.
His thoughts trailed back to his team, to Tony. He did not want to fail here. Then his mind flashed to Bucky for a moment. He was back on the train and his brother had slipped through his fingers again. His final scream echoing in his mind. The screaming kept going longer and longer than it ever had before. He paused, that was not a man’s scream.
Where before its spatial manifestation was about fifty meters in diameter, it was now a good eighty. Using his scanner, Iron Man located all five of the focal spatial disorders.
Tony sighed. He knew this would be a longshot, but damn. He is definitely sorely missing the presence of his team right now. He really wished he had the foresight to think these things through.
She nuzzled his neck pleasantly and began to hum a lullaby. Steve chuckled at her. He ran his hand through her hair and gently massaged her scalp. Steve's smile widened when she went totally limp against him.
Just as he said that Dumm-E rolled by with the fire extinguisher and made sure to thoroughly douse Tony with flame retardant before moving on. Tony emitted a long-suffering sigh and Pepper laughed despite herself.
“I don’t understand.  We have been searching for this woman this entire time how is it you are able to find her where we couldn’t.”  She questioned with a hiss in her voice.  Before Tony could respond Steve stepped up to defend the genius and help alleviate the tension.
“Be strong Steve. Don’t fall for it.” He heard Peggy say beside him. She might as well have been 2000 light years away.
Before Tony could go back into hysterics Steve enveloped Tony close to his body. He could feel Tony relax immediately.
Steve turned back to the stove and turned the burners off. He plated up the last of the pancakes and headed to the table. Peggy already had Ellie setting out the plates. After setting the pancakes down Steve pulled Peggy into a hug then pulled out her chair for her. He kissed her temple as she sat down. As they began eating their breakfast Ellie began a retelling of her grand adventure with Rocky, her flying pony, to her mother. Steve smiled wistfully as he realized she repeated the story almost verbatim.
“Oh come on Cap, you are going to go to Asgard. That’s kind of nuts and awesome you know. I just wanted to see how you are doing.” Tony replied excitedly.
“Anyway, when I mount the arm it will click into place but won’t be connected. I’ll let you get used to its weight before moving on to step two. You ready?”
Though it was greatly muffled and distorted from the mask, it still sent the most wretched shivers down the Captain’s spine.
“And Tony, bring that drive with you. We are going to decide together what to do with it.” Tony only nodded, not even putting up a fight.
He couldn’t help to wonder how he ended up in this absurd situation. How every seemingly un-noteworthy decision he made lead him to this point. The closer they got to the old industrial district the more Steve could feel fate closing in. It was both euphoric and at the same time hauntingly terrifying.
He made out windows on the seventh floor of the factory that remained open.  That was probably his best shot at getting in.  It looks like all the fire escapes had been blasted off.
Steve started to give Tony ‘the look’ again. The billionaire with every intention of getting under the Soldiers skin started to obnoxiously full on laugh out loud.
He could not stop thinking about the soldier for the life of him. If Calamity was going to claim him soon he at least wanted this mystery solved. There was something utterly devastating about him. The way he moved, his very presence is familiar somehow.
“Very good Babydoll. It is. And also because of this shape here.” he explained pointing to another element on the page.
Time seemed to stop as he snapped his attention to the source. There he was, a golden Adonis standing on the precipice of a collapsed building with his shield in hand.
Still the Professor remained calm, all the while searching Steve’s features as if trying…  As if trying to figure out what his thoughts were…
Ellie followed close behind him. As Steve made his way through town he was very much aware of the fact that people stopped to stare at him in awe. He tried not to get too upset and overwhelmed about it. Before the serum, if he had seen a man walk by displaying such strength, he'd likely stare the hardest.
“Look, you’ve got to trust me here okay?”  Tony made eye contact with Steve.  “I really am trying to help.”
Steve’s way ended up discharging the excessive power in a shockwave.  Though quite powerful and damaging with the capacity of knocking all of the Avengers through a loop, it was nowhere near the annihilating force it was meant to be.  Despite the absolute terror of the entire circumstances the only reported fatalities were mostly birds.  All in all not bad.
After washing the dishes and cleaning the rest of the kitchen and dining area for good measure, Steve headed upstairs to check on Ellie. Peggy had already left an hour ago to run errands which consisted of groceries and a brunch/tea with Angie.
A/N: Yes! I'm Back binging with me another chapter! Woot! Things are getting intense now, will they overcome?
‘Way to be a weirdo, Rogers.’ He chided himself. “I, uh, just had a feeling.” Not a lie. “Must have been the calluses on your hands, my mother had them also.” Also not a lie, perfect save. He congratulated himself.
Barnes nodded. “It’s funny how close Hydra was to being right regarding everything they dug up about the Nordic lore.” He mused. “Personally, I always thought they were all bat crap crazy, at least when I was free to think so for myself.”
Bruce entered the room and watched as Xavier left. He nodded to the others to continue as he made his way to stand next to The Captain.
He told Barnes to come to him after their deployment orders. Half of their team had already left by now. He sighed heavily not quite sure how he felt about what he was going to have to do now.
The Rhododendron and his goons laughed cruelly as they began making Tony do tricks in the sky, even going as far to take turns maneuvering him about. In the sky Tony had gotten a whole new level perspective. He felt utterly violated in ways he knew he could never be able to express.
For a fraction of a moment the image of a half painted portrait of Coney Island came to him. It left as quickly as it came but he was sure he had seen his own hands work the paint. He shook his head. He could have very well have painted something like that recently and just not remember it.
The Captain nodded slowly, absorbing the Professors words.  Steve spent days upon days yearning for answers, he was most certainly not going to interrupt.
Xavier smiled. The others stared at Tony appallingly. They assumed that Tony's attitude was directed at the Professor.
“Once every one arrives we should be getting started.” Bruce concluded as looked about the room once more.
“Bucky, if I can get you and them out of here safely then that’s what I’m going to do. Please, let me have this. This is what I want. Go with them.”
“Good.”  Tony’s suited body began to approach him from behind.  Sensing a shift in the air Steve felt something was off.
Suddenly Tony landed in front of him, blocking Steve from Calamity. He knew it was futile but tried anyway.
“You were so concerned and you went through so much trouble to keep me from over exerting myself.” He said gesturing to the restraints. “I’d hate for you to fail your mission now.” Steve forced the smirk.
None were happy.  Clint, still with a bandaged head, and Natasha were sitting next to each other. They appeared to be absorbing the comfort of being so near one another.
The projectile came from another creature from a different tribe. I can understand if it was done because they needed her flesh for sustenance, needed her furs for warmth, or her tools for work. I could understand because such unfortunate happenstances occurred in nature.
Soon enough, though, he had found himself in the room that overlooked the sky.  The one he and Tony had fallen asleep in not so long ago.  He stared up that the sky and simply marveled at how it was turning brilliant hues of orange and yellows and that the more the sun began to set more purple was becoming visible.  He began to think deeply about everything.  He thought of how he ended up to this point.  He thought of his childhood and everything that led him to the army.  He thought of Dr. Erskine and how he chose Steve for the experiment.  He thought of his time in the army making movies.  He thought of Peggy. He thought of his team the Howling Commandos and of Bucky.  He thought of the Red Skull and the Tesseract and how he ended up in the ice.  He thought of waking up in a time that was worlds apart from the one that he left behind.
“Now we need to contact Thor. How long will it be before your ‘space phone’ is up and running?” Tony perked at the mention of his ‘space phone’. He’s overly proud and exceedingly fond of that particular invention.
“Thank you so much!”  Maggie and Eli’s mother said to him with watery eyes.  She was holding Eli close to her desperately.
He did not know. All he did know was that he was going to spend the last of it with his brother because he knew it was the end of the line and there was no place on heaven, hell and earth he’d rather be.
During their trek to the factory Steve learned that the siblings were actually twins. Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. They were Hydra experiments like Bucky. In any case their abilities were incredibly useful and made it easier to elude detection. So for now, he was glad they were there.
"No wonder why I couldn't figure out where I was. It's not so much where but when." He said touching the device.
“Perhaps it is so… there may have been records of destruction before the Calamity. But I still wouldn’t know, there is true evil in the universe that would have been a better target should that be the case but perhaps it is still worth really looking in to.”
After an embarrassing disaster of changing into bedclothes and a few awkward attempts at position changes, Steve and Peggy were finally settled down peacefully. He could sense her fall asleep quickly but for Steve sleep would not come. There was just way too much to absorb. His wildest dreams had become a reality.
"When I first arrived here on Earth and began searching for my Keystone I was delighted to find that Earth had a few sets of representative champions already. One in particular hailed under the banner of Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Of those individuals two had souls that shone the brightest and had the qualities I often sought-after."
Steve ran his hands down Tony's sculpted back and planted them on his firm ass pulling him closer, intensifying their pleasure. Tony cried out in bliss then leaned in and claimed Steve's lips again, greedily drawing out every moan and sigh he could before breaking away and began kissing up Steve's strong jaw before latching onto the sensitive flesh just below his left ear.
She sneered. "I will gladly return him if you give me permission to take every last soul on this planet, excluding yours and his, right here, right now. Not you nor anyone else is permitted to do a single thing to stop me. Deal?"
Tony knew he wouldn’t be able to hold on for long, however. The genius saw that he was the closest to him, maybe if he got his boot jets working, he could swoop in and collect him before the soldier was sucked into the hole completely. Before Tony could even think about the repercussions, he began to hook up the rest of his armor to his own arc reactor.
Tony bristled. “Way to be efficient, you mean. I’ll have you know I’m also working on how to save us all from Calamity or did you forget our imminent doom?”
“Tony? What did you say to him?” he inquired with a bemused manner. Tony’s face was contorted somewhere between horror and amusement.
In a half an hour later Steve, with his shield strapped to his back, found himself standing by the bay doors next to Ironman.  Tony did a little jig as they waited for the bay doors to open.  Steve looked at him, shaking his head. He had no idea how the genius still had so much energy after such a full day of excitement.
Of course his friends would want to spend time with him before Calamity claimed him. He would love to spend time with them, especially Tony. But how could he knowing Bucky was out there somewhere with no telling the kind of hell that’s happening in his head? How could he justify happily spending time with his friends when it’s his fault his brother was out there somewhere falling apart?
He ended up in a brutal hand to hand combat with the deadly assassin.  The dark figure was a super soldier just like him.  The Captain did not know how but he could sense it.
After the San Jose fiasco where some jackass had the audacity to challenge him over the rights of an electrical repair kit (Fucker), Tony had installed a precision soldering function to each of his new suits in the event that he needed to fix himself in a pinch. He was now eternally grateful for his own foresight. Though it's not quite being used for its intended purpose, its current value was immeasurable.
“Listen,” Tony said rubbing his throat. “The doors lag. I couldn’t have them corner us like Rumlow did.” He explained. Bucky glared. “Look, I knew you’d make it! Okay? I timed it perfectly.”
“Yeah? This coming from the guy who was Hydra’s brainwashed murder slave for seventy odd years? Who got free only to be framed for the greatest American massacre of the century and subsequently get shot by a crazy guy in a pink bunny suit? Then only to end up in this floating ocean pokey strapped to a gurney? How’s that shit luck!?” Tony retorted.
“And that point of view is spectacular. I could not help myself but I started painting that scene right before this whole mess started.” He said bashful.
“Mr. Stark has disabled your override code over the house arrest.  It is invalid.  Do you wish to override lock down protocol?”
Johnny saw them and quickly made to cover them in their escape. Steve didn’t stop running until he was sure they were a good distance away. When he stopped his heart leapt for joy as he looked at the sky. His back up team was just arriving, IronMan and War Machine were up in the air taking over for Johnny. The X-jet flew over head with reinforcements heading to the factory.
“Tell me, if you had just been accused of a heinous crime and the entire world is looking for you, what would you do? Where would you go? You have two mutant kids with you, who cannot control their abilities properly. What then? Where do you go? The kids are foreign, they know nothing of these lands. Where do you hide?” She asked, re-creating the scenario. “You’re scared, you have no idea who to trust… Think my love, put yourself in his shoes.”
"The fucking rabbit destroyed one of the spatial distortion units!" Barnes replied over the coms as he ran up to Tony.
"Steven, my love, this is a real fine family you have here, you know that do you not?" She admitted with reverence.
She stood there in her little Mary Janes and a long baby blue nightgown with lace at the cuffs and hem. Her arms were outstretched to reach for him but too afraid to touch him. He was about to reach for her then he heard a voice, a whisper.
That heart again… Pain suddenly seared through his body starting at his wrist and ending in the middle of his forehead. He heard and felt something crack again. The sound was sickening like precious glass breaking.
He ran his hands over his arms and chest, thoroughly mapping out his muscles. His face was definitely his own but his body was almost foreign to him despite the fact he could definitely feel the difference. There was so little downtime overseas and during the tour to really have the time inspect himself so intimately. In the beginning, to be honest, he was kind of afraid to. He began to run his hands over his arms and chest again.
Tony leaned in again and pressed a firmer more tender kiss to his lips. Steve was in perfect anguish. How long had he wanted this? To have a tender moment alone with Tony without any interruptions? To finally kiss him freely? Here he was finally in this moment and it was despairingly tainted. He could not help himself though, he knew he would desperately regret it later but he began to kiss Tony back anyway. He still loved him regardless of every stupid thing that has happened so far. How can something hurt so much yet alternately feel so damn good at the same time?
"Yes, quite the individual." She drawled. "You on the other hand, there was still the possibility I could sway you. You have no idea how much work I had to do to get you to say yes. The lengths I had to go to break you."
“I only hid my visage from your world at first to create a proper foothold before risking detection. After you made the connection to my chosen ones there was no sense in hiding any longer. But I couldn’t make it too easy on you either.” She winked.
“That was my thought; I mean getting out of the helicarrier for a few hours will probably do is some good.”
After director fury was up to speed and was listening earnestly Hank continued, “He managed to claw her straight through her abdomen.  Unfortunately she apparently remained unaffected by it.  Soon after that Logan fell as well.  As soon as the hit the floor this strange woman had already disappeared.”  Hank finished solemnly.
Tony paused and genuinely mulled over her deal. He hated the price she asked and that she had the audacity to ask it all. It was too much, he hated himself even more for even taking a moment to consider it. He looked down on Steve's broken body and is much as he would like to think that he would have truly given anything to save the Captain, Calamity asked for the one thing he absolutely could not give, his humanity, his soul. Sure, he would have physically handed it to her as if it were a tangible thing as this bizarre conversation suggests. In fact, he had just offered, however, part of her bargain states that he and Steve would be hands-off, yet that is exactly what the twisted catch is. In this warped scenario, she would not stake claim on his soul but how much of his human soul would even still exist if he traded the rest of humanity for it?
“If things go south, which I’m not going to lie is an extreme possibility, you take her and run.” Steve implored to Pietro. “Don’t look back, just run.”
If Tony had his way he’d either have him dead or locked away. He had half a mind to send him right back to the Raft.
His progress was slow going.  He stumbled and tripped many times before he had to rest against a wall.  He could still feel the rough texture of the brick wall beneath his hands despite the buzzing feeling zinging through his fingertips.
“The “search” for my keystone?  That’s funny.”  She mused.  “Oh love, I have already found my keystone.  It’s…  How do I put this…  Not ready to use.”  She confessed with a sly smirk.
A/N: Sorry this took so long to get to you. I wanted to get this out before Endgame premiered but my work schedule got really janky there for a while. Then I was a little destroyed after Endgame. Only a few more chapters left. Leave me a review and let me know what you think. Also, I was considering a sequel and or a series of sequels to this story. You'll know more what I aim to do after this story is concluded. I will ask then if you want me to continue on for a sequel or if you just want me to put this story in the coffin and leave it be.
He has days, weeks at the most before his life, his soul was no longer his own. And there was absolutely nothing he could do about it.
Tony looked up at him. "Well, to give you some context, you said it had been ten hours since you last saw me?" Steve nodded. "It had been almost two days for me. According to my math every twenty-four hours for you is about 113.4 hours for me which is about 4.96 days." Tony stated matter of factly.
Not over yet? Tony wanted to argue; the situation felt pretty desperate. However, the look on Steve’s face gave him pause and should he dare think, reason to hope?
He was after all the one who noticed the woman’s face in the reflection. This is a huge breakthrough.
“Okay maybe not that last suggestion but it wouldn’t be all that hard to carry you.  Come on I know you’re hungry and I know you wouldn’t mind getting out for a little while.  What are you in the mood for?  French? Italian? Polish?”  Tony asked 100% serious.
He glanced around the room searching for a way out. Instead he found an answer as he spotted Thor in the corner of the room giving Jane a kiss on her cheek. In the end all it was is to kiss Tony or fork over fifty bucks. Duh.
“I need the keystone to complete the circle, or perhaps more accurate, the cherry on top so to speak.” She said as she tapped their very top of Fury’s head gently.
They were seated in a lounging area in Tony’s workshop equipped with various refreshments upon Clint’s request.
"No! I mean it shouldn't have been possible to touch me. It defies the laws of-" Then he paused and squeezed his eyes shut in realization. "That fucking witch!" He exclaimed. "She is behind this!"
Before the knowledge of his newfound isolation and proximity to the mother could consume him, he felt a presence side up to him.
How!? In this desperate situation? The next look that flashed in his eyes was one of acceptance and Steve knew then that Bucky intended to die.
That light feeling faded however after snuggling into his bed to sleep. After showing Peter his painting in talking to Tony it’s like the floodgates opened, like picking a scab off a healing wound.
Tony threw his arm over his shoulder and heaved him to his feet. Bucky gritted his teeth trying to hold in his scream in agony. Tony watched the muscles in his jaw strain. His pain was excruciating. He had to make this quick.
They were right in presuming why Fury was calling. It was definitely about the crazy coma cases. People were starting to get scared; they were saying ‘An epidemic is spreading!’
He felt the impact resonate throughout his entire body, but was happy to be successful in knocking the bot away from Natasha. Steve hit the ground with a deplorable thud causing him to go into a coughing fit laced with blood.
“Fuck! Okay, we will have to do this the old-fashioned way.” Tony growled as he began to take careful aim at the villainous group.
He dreamed of that hellish day in the dead of winter back in 1945. He dreamed of Bucky falling over and over again. And never did he once reach him in time.
“Nothing here on Earth, I assure you.”  She smirked.  “I will tell you there are ways.  I’m not impervious to the laws of the universe our great Mother had created, I can die.  But the ways are vastly beyond your reach.”  She stated matter of factly.
Natasha brought in Agent 13, Sharon Carter. Steve was shocked to learn that his old next door neighbor was not only an agent but Peggy’s great niece. His mind was certainly blown. No one blamed him for shooting daggers at Fury all through that day.
“Listen, I just want to know if he really meant what he said in the letter. And if he did, then why did he go through such lengths to leave?” Tony asked trying to keep his features schooled. That was the million-dollar question, right? How did it all come to this?
“Whoa, hold on there bird brain, that is a bit overkill don’t you think?” Tony questioned snidely looking at Clint almost bewildered.
A/N: Oh boy! Now we have a little bit of insight on Tony and we have a bit of adorable domestic fluff. Don’t forget Tony still needs to receive a certain letter. So stay tuned for the next installment and I’ll see you guys then.
“No!  You shouldn’t see him yet.  He’s conscious but unresponsive.  We fear any over stimulus could make his condition worse.”
He stood up and began to pace around the crates trying to build up the nerve to execute his utterly idiotic plan. Finally, he took a deep breath and thought, ‘Here goes nothing.’
She definitely hit the nail on the head with that one. Sometimes he really hated how well she could read him.
“We are to speak with Fury immediately.”  Steve was almost thankful for whatever it is that’s likely happening.
Steve’s mind came to a grinding halt before slowly starting back up. Tony was here to take him back.
Loki was an incredible opponent and a very skillful magician. The things that he was capable of on a normal day were frightening enough but with the added power of his freaky deaky staff, the tesseract and a Chitori army, he was nearly unstoppable. Now they were going to deal with yet another alien foe? Oh, how fun. Well at least they still have the Hulk, yep that’ll work.
A/N: Have no fear this is definitely going to be Steve/Tony! I’m shamelessly using Bucky to put Steve through a bit more torment before his run in with the 1950s.
“However, Sir, At this point in time I am sure Director Fury would readily disagree with you.” Jarvis stated flatly, Confirming Thor’s question.
"It's okay, Babydoll. Mommy is having the baby." He said as calmly as he possibly could even though all he wanted to do was scream. He did not know how it was possible to feel so scared and excited and anxious all at once.
“Yeah, I am assuming you are talking about the exponential increase of unexplained coma cases?” Tony confirmed recalling the upsetting news that had in fact caught his attention.
“But what about the keystone thing?  What if we stopped her from using it?”  Darcy asked.  Many visibly flinched at her question.  “I mean, if we could figure out what or where it is…”  She added.
After that the others were of his current team. He had one of Natasha laughing at a pouty Clint during a movie night and one of Bruce sipping his morning tea while reading a newspaper. He smiled brokenly at these long forgotten domestic scenes. He turned the page again to find Thor amid epic gesture as he told of grand tales from his world. Next was a comic of Fury pointing directly at the viewer stating “I’ve got my eye on you.” With Maria and Colson in the background making silly faces behind his back. Steve stared bemused at that one for a moment recalling the hectic day that had inspired that drawing.
Not gonna lie, it was a little hard to continue knowing the canon had contradicted me yet again. One of the main lessons to take away from my story was that you can’t turn back time, you can only move forward and make the best of what you have now. But noooooooooooooooooooo *Spoiler Alert* Endgame just had to be all cool and complicated and introduce time travel. I get why they had to do it, they had to create the multi-verse somehow. But Stiiiiillll.
“Ah, you’re quite right my friend.” He grinned back. “But it still does not stop my imagination from seeking such solace. Ah…” Thor replied with a faraway look.
"Oh? Is that what you call ripping yourself out of the world I created for you and shattering it to pieces. I will have you know it was not easy to make and it is now completely obliterated."
It sounded like someone speaking to him from very far away. But he listened intently to the all too familiar voice. Time seemed to stop and his wrist hurt like nothing before.
“Everything meaning arms and legs too.” He added as he stood and stretched his muscles and popped his joints. “Not a lick of pain.”
"I'm setting this for fifteen minutes. That's about how long it's going to take for all 2020 devices to sync up and initiate the program, then Bam! Everybody should be free from her."
Before he even knew it, Rockaway Beach manifested into view. The sandy shore was illuminated by the somber light of the moon.
Barnes stood back laughing. He gestured out twenty-three with his hand as he tried and failed to contain his chuckles.
Because of Tony’s new design to the bone anchoring mechanism it would be relatively easy to remove and replace any arm they came up with. He could have a whole set of different arms specifically geared to certain types of missions or for whatever he wanted or needed. That feature also worked very well for removing damaged arms and replacing them with ease. At the time, Barnes had gawked at Tony after hearing his suggestion. Hydra’s arm wasn’t very removable. The soldier had a whole team of engineers and scientists to do maintenance and repair to the arm after each mission. Those times were awful. Tony’s design made life so much easier.
