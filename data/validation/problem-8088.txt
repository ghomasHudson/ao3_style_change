Yeah.
He sighed, snapping back to attention when the kid spilled his glass over.
Tony leaned back, falling silent.
could do that, so what in God’s name was his damn problem. He survived
Tony wouldn’t answer him honestly anyway.
“Yeah.”
Steve’s whole expression shifted so fast, Tony thought he’d get whiplash. He went from looking concerned and worried, to smiling softly with the happiness back around the edges.
Hey!!
”You know, it is okay to let yourself be vulnerable. You lost years of your life and the new you doesn’t quite fit in and it’s okay to be upset, Tony. It’s okay to not be fine right now. But I want you to know that I see the effort you make.”
It wasn’t like it was just a hint of anger. It was just anger. Pure.
He woke up and was certain he just blacked out due to alcohol and was woken up by something a few hours later. His head was spinning and was all but roaring. He lay on a bed but it was definitely not his, it was way too small and uncomfortable.
Jesus, it hasn’t even been that long since he had gotten released from the hospital, and yet he had changed already.
Bucky gave him one last pat on the shoulder, ”Not for that.”
Tony decided to take it as further proof that he had chosen the right approach. Be an asshole, show everybody that it would
“Not you hurt them. It did. We knew something was up with you but not even Jarvis could find out what it was and it was a mess, Tony. But you’re back and that’s all that matters.”
He might have forgotten about it and his family all together but it was what had come back before he even got his first memory back.
He breathed in again and again, while holding heavy eye contact with Tony, who just raised an eyebrow at him. What was this guy’s deal?
Natasha just stared at him in a way that could peel paint from the walls, before she raised an eyebrow at him and shook her head softly.
”Yes!” The kid still giggled and then began to swing his legs to be held more comfortably.
”Tony, why do you have to be this stubborn and — ,” Steve threw his hands up and sighed exhausted, as if he was truly tired of Tony not forgiving him for nearly
”This one,” he said, not pouting anymore, snuggling a bit closer to Tony.
He hadn’t meant to fuck it all up. But of course he did. He was so good at that, it might as well be his best skill.
”Daddy!” He exclaimed, pulling Tony’s sleeve. ”Come on!”
He turned around to look at Rhodey, machine still on his head, looking utterly smug.
I don’t belong here. I am
His first instinct was to run to Steve and tell him about it, but then he thought the better of it and went to Rhodey instead.
“I’m literally living with a billionaire why should I buy my own coffee?” Clint made a grabby hand motion to the coffee pot and sighed in relief when he had it back in his possession.
Bucky nodded, smiling again while getting up. ”What did you remember? The dirty stuff?” He said lightly, while putting his glass into the dishwasher.
It took him way too long to get what happened, all he knew was that he as shaking again, in his throat a silent scream  he couldn’t let out while he stood in the middle of his workshop like he was paralyzed. His breath quickened, his lungs ache and his heart beat so fast, he didn’t know how to deal with it.
Tony was strangely aware that there were lines people shouldn’t cross. He didn’t know why he had the low feeling as if this sentence might have been something that did overstep.
He got up unsteadily and found his way upstairs to go grab a shower. On the sofa in the common area sat Steve with a little notebook on his lap. He looked at Tony just like Tony thought he would.
”Our Child.
Yeah it had been weeks since he’s been released from the hospital and all his action was limited to his own hands, but still, he hadn’t even thought about going out to get laid.
“You are safe. You are you. We are in the kitchen, can you smell that?”
of weight?”
“You ever thought how weird reactions to emotions are?” Tony asked to get the thought out of his head. Rhodey yawned and turned to face him. “Huh?”
just like in the old times.
Tony pulled the corners of his mouth up, mimicking how Rhodey looked when he didn’t burn their dinner that one time.
Tony swore he could feel his eyes pop out of his head. Then though he just settled for another heavy sigh as answer. "Of course I did. Kid, husband, white picket fence, no drinking. Is there anything fun I didn’t give up?”
Tony was not proud to admit that he bailed the next second. He turned around without saying anything, all but running to his room.
because he was. He didn’t know what was happening to him right now but he knew that. He knew that he had never felt more guilty in his life.
As if this blonde guy had just walked into his life and made Tony,
When he came down to his workshop, he threw the vegetable soup Bruce made him away. He’d promised his friend that he’d try and eat it, that he’d give his best to do better, because he hated that he'd worried him so badly, but there was no way he could eat that now.
Steve interrupted himself and scratched the back of his head, leaving Tony to choose his own ending for that statement.
“I thought he would kill me,” Tony cleaned his hands on an old shirt and stared right into her eyes, “I saw his face, the face I used to wake up to for nearly 3 years and I thought he would
But also fact was, he was just delaying the conversation. Steve would say all this sooner or later and right now Tony did everything so that this later would become never and they both just forgot about it altogether.
under his breath and Tony couldn’t help but nodding helplessly.
Things like Steve looking more sad than Tony could ever recall, seeming so small, as if his body was just way too big for him right now.
His expression flickered into something hopeful, but it was gone as fast as it had appeared. As if he was actively keeping himself from getting his hopes up, already used to being disappointed.
”I just wanted to talk,” he shrugged, leaning awkwardly against Tony’s closet with one shoulder. The movement seemed so mechanic and uncoordinated, as if Rogers had forgotten for a second what to do and how to behave with his body. As if it was suddenly too big to fit him. Tony only raised an eyebrow, prompting him to start talking.
“I deserve it,” Tony answered without missing a beat.
“I am —” Rhodey took a deep breath and seemed to collect himself, determined expression on his face, as if he was trying his hardest to answer as honest as possible. Tony appreciated it, people lied so often. To not hurt others feelings or something, not that he’d understand. Rhodey was trying to treat him like an equal, even though he couldn’t hurt Tony’s feelings even if he tried. In the end you definitely miss 100% of all shots you take if there’s no target.
Tony absolutely did
Rogers shook his head slightly when Tony opened his mouth to say something and looked down at the kid. Tony rolled his eyes and sunk back on the couch, giving Rogers the time to bring the child to bed.
But how could he? Now that he knew what all those people felt, how could he turn it off? It wasn’t as if he took all their emotions away, just a little bit of the one they didn’t want to have anymore.
Tony scoffed and then raised one eyebrow. "Yeah? My father could tell you a few things about that.”
They couldn’t know. Hell knows what they’d do. All of them already thought of him as weak and dramatic, what would they think if he told them he had an eating disorder. They probably say that he just wanted pity. Wanted attention.
Steve nodded, the tiniest of smiles playing around his lips. ”Good.”
”Aha”, Tony answered unimpressed, looking directly into Sam’s eyes, challenging him a little, ”Worse than you, or about the same?”
”I know.”
Tony didn’t run to Steve’s room, it was just very,
Has been even since he was six and heard his mother cry daily, because
”Tony —,” her voice broke before she could finish whatever she intended to say. She settled to just look at him with her normal schooled expression, though it seemed kind of off, as if she was trying really hard to not yell at him in panic - Jesus, he could sing a duet with her on that note - before she caught herself again and carried on with her 'not — taking — any — shits — not — now — not — ever' expression.
And maybe he had been wrong, because that was a big reaction. He couldn’t really do anything with it, but yeah it was.
also stayed out of Steve’s way to avoid doing exactly that.
Building he could do. Inventing things, make machinery work, that was something he was good at.
”I should send my husband a getting laid text?” Tony asked incredulous, ignoring that he could also just tell Steve that he hadn’t planned on hooking up with anyone anyway. If Steve wanted to think of him as some kind of cheating asshole, yeah okay. People had assumed worse things about him over the years.
But it was okay. When he ignored the first few awkward weeks in which they just kind of co - existed and Tony put all his energy into avoiding them all like the plague. Eventually, the tension slowly slipped away and they came back to a rhythm.
too close to home, making him feel numb.
Sam Reagen? Simon Ringer?
He came back to think it all over again, when he took a real look, not just a tiny glance, at his blue finger nails for the first time and actually thought about wearing nail polish to hide it from the others. That was the exact moment when he realized that he was well aware that something was wrong with him, but not even one step into fixing the problem. He was in full denial and well wasn’t that just the story of his life.
Rhodey turned around to him and looked at him in challenge. He had always hated when Tony talked about himself like he was a robot, like he was broken. But seriously, what about Tony wasn’t shattered into pieces at this point?
Tony settled for just leaning down a little, fighting the urge to ruffle the boy’s hair and instead just looked at him, with what he hoped would be an open expression. He had often seen Bucky wear his easy smile when talking to Peter and it always seemed to work.
”Your son.” Tall Blonde’s voice was hard like stone and Tony had no doubt that he had learned that in the military. He didn’t even need to ask to know that this man had served.
Tony turned his gaze away from the wall behind her, still seeing the traces of the yellow in his vision.
”I just miss them. I miss it.”
”What was that?” SR asked, looking
Tony counted it as a little victory for now. It wasn’t quite angry but not his forced calmness either.
Maybe just to show him.
”Meh,” Tony answered, ready to get him to be angry. He didn’t really know why this was so important to him anymore but he felt like a prisoner in here. The walls were closing in and anywhere he tried to run were reminders that he had grown up. He was a different person now and he had to be that person again, from a second to the next. He couldn’t be. He was failing and it was about time that he wasn’t the only one who saw it. Or made it clear that they saw it. He was fucking it all up and was so sick of being the only person who’d admit it.
Steve’s gaze was enough to silence his friend who grumbled and sat down next to Tony, looking at him from the side.
“Mhm.” He only shrugged and sank a bit farther in the couch. He wanted to do something instead of sitting here, but his parents said they’d be back when the clock showed 2:00 and it only said 1:05.
”We?” Tony asked, sucking greedy on his chip. ”I have taught this boy literally nothing, handsome.”
How could you let this happen, how could you —”
And he hadn’t cared, so help him, he had shrugged it off.
Steve laid his head on the backrest and closed his eyes. Tony watched him for a bit, rolling all the questions he had around in his mouth, not really knowing what to say and how.In the end he settled for a simple. ”Steve, can we talk?” To which Steve ripped his eyes open instantly and turned to him, looking concerned.
After swallowing several chips of ice he felt marginally better, so he turned his attention back to Jarvis.
Rhodey jumped off his chair, rushed to Tony and pulled him in a tight hug, lifting him off his feet.
Tony tried to decide whether or not he was too tired to bring up the whole love thing again. Then he immediately shook his head. This too needed to be out in the open.
bad that was happening.
“No, you don’t. You feel happy and think it’s everything.” He didn’t sound accusing, just maybe a hint of bitter. His body language reminded him of his mother. Always loyal, always strong, always breaking.
Steve sat at the kitchen counter, drawing pad in front of him. On the couch in front of the open kitchen played the kid with toy cars on the white carpet, always in his father’s range of vision, even if he didn’t seem to be paying too much attention. Just enough that if an emergency occurred, he could be there for the kid within a second.
Stupid.
Tony huffed frustrated, then, not getting the attention he hoped he’d get. He leaned a bit closer to Rogers, getting his smug grin back on his face. He’d get the sadness off of the man’s face and if it took everything he got.
He was still drunk when he got on the plane.
”Where was I?” Steve asked after a long minute in which they just stared at each other. Tony wondered again what Steve saw when looking at him. His husband, probably. But also the person who really wasn’t his husband at all. ”Yeah, so I brought you flowers to make up for what I did. I came home early to give them to you, I didn’t want to sit at work wondering if you were still mad at me for a second longer.”
can’t you just stop with all this act and
you can heat up later.”
Tony frowned and looked at the last fact on the page he had written.
me. And I know he thought so, too.”
He took the wedding band off the chain and tucked the dog tags back, not wanting to confront himself with too much at once. He’d come back to take a closer look at them, later.
flooding his chest.
It was midnight , when he passed out in the middle of his thoughts, out of pure exhaustion. The last thing on his mind was the realization that he had stopped calling Steve  'Rogers', in his head at least, and he couldn’t even say why. It felt oddly intimate. It also felt oddly right, but he didn’t want to overthink that.
”And he will feel better soon?” He asked, sounding so naive that Tony felt bad for a second, wanting to chime in and hug the child, telling him that he was sorry for being an asshole, but he was confused and hurt and he didn’t know who he was. Who he was supposed to be.
he was always cold and shivering, hell, he wouldn’t even know an answer for that.
When Steve looked up and saw that Tony apparently
- Your Nick 🥰
”No hard feelings. Bucky’s awesome, I get it. Let’s call it a truce here, okay?”
”I don’t know if he will, Pete,” Rogers answered honestly, his sadness on his face like a forever lasting shadow. ”But for now all we can do to help is give him space, is that okay?”
Set a problem in front of Tony and he’ll move the earth to find an invention to fix it. But there was no machinery that could fix that. How the hell was he supposed to find out whether or not Steve loved him for — him? Not for who he was, for who he should be by now?
He saw Peter, but a lot smaller than he was right now. He was wearing a little blue onesie, clenching a red blanket with spiders printed on it in his little fists, sleeping in Steve’s arms who looked down to his maybe 6 months old son like he was the axis his earth spun around.
There was an arch in his chest that felt a lot like loss. He didn’t even know if this situation was unfixable because it felt like it.
That didn’t keep him from shouting ”Prude” after Rogers.
His thoughts were running miles per minute, he lost them a while ago, just heard bits and pieces now and then, not liking one single thing about it.
of your concern.”
Tony closed his eyes tightly. Hell, he was an Asshole. With a capital A. Because he hadn’t been the only one suffering from this but he sure was the only one making it harder for others because this is who he was. His best defense was to attack and he lashed out.
Flashback or still there? Tony blinked his eyes open and looked around him, seeing nothing but blurry forms. His next breath got stuck in his throat, leaving him coughing and sinking onto the floor, hand over his arc reactor.
He hadn’t.
“There is nobody, okay?” Steve breathed hardly, stepping closer to Tony, towering him by a couple of inches. Tony did not flinch back, he knew Steve wouldn’t hurt him. Physically, that is.
Jesus did Tony hope he wouldn’t. Tears really weren’t something he could deal with right now.
He hadn’t thought this through, all he knew was that he needed somebody to be straight with him. The rest just ignored what had happened but he was losing his grip on reality. He needed somebody to be honest, to tell him who he hurt, maybe not physically but emotionally.
Tony stumbled into his room, breathing hard, trying to keep his balance. He didn’t know anything about kids. Nothing. He didn’t know how to talk with them, how to take care of them, how to play with them. He didn’t know what he was supposed to do.
As if he knew exactly that Tony only drank and slept around because he wanted to feel
chance.
Steve had looked so happy when he had finally spent time with Peter, but how couldn’t he see? How could he be so blind, that he’d be happy to see Tony talking to his son?
And frankly, he was still somewhat afraid of what she might do to him. She was an assassin after all and he felt weaker than ever.
He practically had to pull Clint, who still looked something in between pissed and devastated, out of the room.
to think about it. And then he cuts out dairy, without really realizing it either. He was empty inside and nothing quite
Steve didn’t even have to say it out loud, Tony had gotten the end. He was getting dumped. There was no 'It’s me not you' because of it’s him. It’s always him. There was nothing wrong with Steve, he had been nothing but the perfect boyfriend Tony had never thought he’d have, who would blame him for leaving? He was right, he deserved to be loved back. By heart. And Tony was certain that he did, but not enough. How could it be.
“What?” Tony would deny that it came out more like a shriek than anything else to his dying day,
He told Rogers exactly that when he came to find him, anger still missing from his face. He just looked disappointed but not surprised at all. Tony shouldn’t be as bothered by it as he was. Who gave a damn that he had disappointed a stranger? He shouldn’t. He still did, though, just a little.
“Dear, I don’t love anything.”
”Yeah?” Peter asked, impatiently, looking at Tony with big, curious eyes.
“You don’t have those seeds. You have everything in your brain that would be needed, like the apple. But it still has no seeds.”
“Not in those sweats you’re not.”

he was on the inside.
She looked at him quite unimpressed, turned on the heels and left in fast but quiet steps.
Well, duh.
him. He never went as far as saying it out loud, because those words always seem to ruin everything. And yet, here he was anyway.
Steve looked horrified. He swallowed thickly and evidently thought about walking closer to Tony but didn’t. He just shook his head and his eyes looked as if they were crying out like a dying star.
”The spider won’t walk away from us, Pete. It literally can’t. There’s no rush.”
Tony knew that he wasn’t innocent. He was certain he wouldn’t have
By the morning he was certain that his new plan was a bad idea, maybe his worst idea yet, but hell, if it kept Steve off his back, then okay.
”But —”, the kid cut himself off and then leaned back against his father, looking annoyed but not ready to start an argument. Tony was glad about that. He really didn’t need to see a Father — Son argument right now.
“It was a good run, I beat Sam again.” Steve sounded more proud than he should be considering the fact that he low key cheated in running. Like, it wasn’t his fault that he was a super solider but still. “I saw there were lights on in the workshop when I left. Didn’t you sleep, Tony?”
”Buck, listen, I know that my son has big puppy eyes,” Steve said then, sounding a bit less tired than he had before. ”I know. But have you seen me buy him a dog? Exactly.”
Tony laid back down, sighing, tuning Peter’s pouting voice out, who was obviously not excited about leaving his Daddy after he had blacked out at the breakfast table. Tony only opened his eyes again, when he heard the door shut after them. Just in time to see Steve’s alarmed expression and then watch him run to his phone.
As in: Also his son.
“You ask the questions, Jeez.”
Tony stayed frozen in the hallway for a second before walking over into the kitchen.
It was Bucky who opened the door for him. He didn’t smile this time but he didn’t look any with Tony either, he just looked tired too.
needed to know that. Especially not the people sitting at the table opposite him.
Steve laughed in a sad manner and shook his head, he seemed to be so tired of fighting a war with himself.
It was an expensive car, so that’s a plus. But it was just boring silver and it had a child safety seat in the back. Tony was about ready to let himself be driven over. There just was no way that his life was like that now.
“Yeah sure, no problem, T. But I tell you if it’s about the coffee, I am not the only one drinking it, okay? I don’t have a coffee problem, not a serious one anyway.”
His kid.
, would people only donate things like that, who could blame them.
They sat in silence while Steve cooked, Tony helping Peter out whenever he didn’t look.
Sam clicked his tongue and then had the decency to wink at him, making a thrusting motion with a way too loud and teasing groan.
Peter nodded and ran out of the room again, his boots squealing on the wooden floor.
Because he did already know what it meant. But that really wasn’t the problem either.
Steve leaned against the worktable opposite to Tony and crossed his arms.
”Tony, I —,” Steve paused, obviously having no idea what he could answer to that and Tony understood that. He didn’t expect an answer to begin with, he just needed to get that out there.
They sat like this without moving for quite some time, Tony secretly just waiting to freak out and run again.
with fixing this.
”Buy my son a dog and see what happens,” Steve deadpanned, leaning against the kitchen counter. He shot Tony a smile for no reason, that made Tony feel way warmer than it had any right to.
”Yes!” Peter all but shrieked, jumping from his chair to climb onto Tony’s lap and hug him.
Steve’s smile just brightened, giving Tony the feeling of warmth again, that he had tried to ignore for the past few weeks.
It actually started so harmless. He didn’t really give it much thought before. Of course was he aware that this illness didn’t just come over somebody, like a storm or wild fire. Everything needed to progress, but he never ever thought that it would begin and grow so slow and harmless that he wouldn’t even realized how deep he’s in until he was already on the bottom of a pit and still falling. It really

”Our — ?” He asked, about ready to end this conversation and send this guy together with the child on their merry way home.
“It’s more than that.” Tony
Rhodey huffed now, too, looking at Tony with something between frustration and pity. “Do you really think you’re the only person who has ever loved someone? Of course you feel like a completely different person, idiot, love strips you raw.”
killed his parents, but this anger was long gone. Key words: Empty inside.
Spotted
“I’m okay,” he replies eventually and even to his own ears it sounded like a lie. He used to be a good liar, where was this talent the one time he really needed it.
“No, seriously. How do you know?” Tony raised one eyebrow, knowing it would annoy Steve. He had called it Tony’s
All he had felt had hurt but now? Now every pain seemed numb because he was just so glad that he woke up this morning even though he had hoped he wouldn’t, deep inside of him.
of all people. “We are all concerned and want you to be healthy. And to achieve that you
Tony let out another shuttering breath and took the stairs. He needed the extra time to practice his grin on the way up. It had been a month. It seemed as if he was the only person who still felt uneasy around the others. Possession had been new for them; mind control yeah, but actual possession? No, that hadn’t happen to them before. Still, the rest of the team did come to terms with it rather quickly. The first few days when he was back were rough on all of them, nobody had really known how to act around Tony, what to say or do, but they had gotten over it.
”Yes,” he drew the syllable out, as if he actually wanted to keep it to himself. Tony wasn’t the least surprised that Steve didn’t just lie about it, like everyone else would have. ”But you are right, Tony. You aren’t a prisoner. And I am sorry if I ever made you feel as if you were.”
His coffee didn’t taste sweet at all. Tony liked it. No need to hide the truth behind sugar, his life was bitter.
Bucky looked really sad for a second, losing the easy expression he had worn just a minute ago. Tony couldn’t help but think that it might just have been an act for the kid. To leave him in ignorance for just another few hours, before dropping the truth bomb on him.
Every single one knew their piece to the answer and he couldn’t stop it. All he could do was stand there and
Rogers didn’t even need to finish the sentence for Tony to get it.
He just wasn’t the man who had laid on the couch with Steve, going over cake toppers. He wasn’t. But he didn’t know what he was either.
Tony took a deep breath, resting his chin on Peter’s head, before speaking up, breaking his safety blanket that the silence had built.
After dialling, Tony heard Bucky’s voice chuckling on the other end.
Tony snorted again and then blinked a few times to get his body to wake up some more.
“We were
Tony flinched so hard, he felt it with every bone in his body. He plastered his press—grin over his face and nodded at Bruce thoughtfully.
how he was doing. So Steve didn’t kill him, congrats, nice job, but

Rogers nodded, though, obviously understanding his son without further questions. He turned around and got fruit loops from the kitchen shelf, filling some in Peter’s bowl.
lovers.
Peter didn’t look happy with the answer. He seemed confused, as if he couldn’t understand why Tony would leave the table like that, when he had apparently always sat there till his
Those question didn’t leave him till the evening, but he never got his answers.
”Peter,” Steve said, but then only shrugging in the man’s direction helplessly, not knowing what to tell the kid. Well, Tony couldn’t help there either but he knew that he didn’t want to hug a child,
. They were everywhere, in his workshop, his living room; this whole tower was filled with people who knew exactly where to hit him, who knew his weakest spot.
Tony looked down to his shoes, not knowing what to say. He hadn’t done it for Steve. Or maybe he had. He really couldn’t tell anymore.
Tony only nodded shortly, he was no step further.
Before he had only heard that he’d need to wait till he was older. But it didn’t help. He had grown older, but the excuse was always the same.
Rogers didn’t tease back, he just pulled his eyebrows together, as if Tony had lost his mind. Tony could barely stop himself from rolling his eyes. ”I would never.”
kill you.”
“I haven’t been avoiding you. I’m so good at that, you wouldn’t even have noticed.”
. And I lost that, Rhodey, I lost the only real thing about me.”
Bucky looked at him like he was already planning how to get away with murder.
“I feel pain just fine, I don’t feel emotions.”
“No?” He tried and then looked at her face again to see if he hit the mark. Upon seeing the same patient expression, “Yes?” He ventured.
He held the plate as if it was something important and Tony didn’t get it. Might never get it. For him this plate was just one of the many reminders that he had lost something that he would have considered
Tony thought he might be, too. But he couldn’t say for sure
“I lie a lot, Steve. You know that. But I have never been more honest than I am right now,” Tony chuckled quietly and brushed Steve’s hair back from his forehead, “I’m beginning to think the 8th cup of coffee was a bad idea, look how cheesy I’ve gotten.”
this.
He blinked twice before answering Tony slowly. A nervous tick if he had ever seen one. ”I just want to know that you’re okay. You might not care but I worry when you don’t come home.”
He could swear, though, that he was tasting a lie on the back of his tongue as he nodded.
His words weren’t more than a broken whisper, never had the emptiness inside him hurt as bad as it did in this very moment. He was so tired of thinking of all the ways he wasn’t enough. Done with
If Tony’s little smile that played around his lips might be a bit watery, well, nobody had to know.
generous,
Rhodey leaned back and studied the ceiling, obviously trying to figure out what Tony meant with apple seeds, before dismissing it. His glass laid empty next to him.
She wanted him to be happy, but he didn’t know what that meant. She cried often those days but he couldn’t find what she expected from him, so he just always stared, thinking that she looked oddly old, when she wrinkled her nose like that.
It was as if he could now feel
It stayed like that for months, really. He and the team had breakfast together from time to time, even though Tony just drank his coffee and ate scrambled eggs without bacon.
Tony didn’t know why either, but he let Steve in, in a moment of nostalgia maybe, hoping a bit that Steve could save him, before he banned that thought out of his head. He looked at Steve as blank as he could.
He hated how Steve looked at him as if he was like the moon pulling the tides. As if something here too would be broken if he didn’t accept the offered help.
”What is it?” Tony asked straight out, because hell, he was so sick of this heavy silence with someone he should be closest to. ”What makes you so special?”
“You’re making your mother really sad, son, don’t you care about that?”
”So I am your . . . Dad?”
“Yeah, what a shame, c’mon show me those pearly whites.”
”Daddy ’s talking funny.” He heard the kid giggle from the doorway and spun around to face the little boy.
Steve nodded once more, looking uncertain for a second before locking eyes with Tony once more, as if he was about to say something important, but then aborting last second. Tony wondered if that had been the first time that he had backed out of something. ”Good night, Tony.”
Steve laughed and then looked at him with a raised eyebrow. ”You’ll buy it even though you just don’t hate it and not love it?”
Steve narrowed his eyes in Tony’s direction, daring him to finish the sentence. Tony snapped his mouth shut and just stared at Peter wide-eyed.
Tony nodded, walking past Rogers to the door, thinking of taking his bag himself, but then deciding against it. It would be ridiculous, he could barely move in a straight line much less carry a heavy bag. So he just walked in front of Rogers, always faster, not to walk by his side. He didn’t have a reason as to why it felt like the right thing to do, to not walk by his side. Maybe because it was so perfectly metaphorical. He wasn’t by Rogers’s side anymore, he didn’t want to be.
”Well,” Tony said slowly, watching Rogers even closer. How could this man be so good at showing no emotions but one? It frustrated Tony; he had always appreciated people who could just be straight forward. He knew that Rogers had more in him than just a sad pout. ”I see why I’d fuck you, totally. But 8 years? Marriage? Kid? Let me see!”
”How could you let this happen to you? This can
It wasn’t him, not by mind anyway, but it really could’ve been. He squinted his eyes and let it all play all over again, needing to find the one mistake the creature made when trying to act like him. But he came up empty. If he hadn’t given up drinking, he’d be convinced that it was him but he was just too hungover to remember it.
Steve’s smile fell off his face, adding tension to the room from a second to the next. “You are suffering, aren’t you?”
Steve took a deep breath, eyes shining blue and honest. ”Please don’t bring someone here and make me see my husband with someone else, please. Don’t make our son see it.”
if we’re being honest. But Sam didn’t need to know that. In fact,
Before he could spiral some more, he jumped off of his bed, grabbing his jacket and rushed to the elevator.
There were only two things he knew for sure right now.
When he fell asleep, his dream skipped past him like he was looking through a photo album.
“You’re smiling,” he started when he sat down in front of the kitchen counter, looking Tony up and down and then looking at the inside of his arms, as if he was searching for traces of drug use.
He leaned against the mirror inside the elevator, trying to get his breathing under control, but he couldn’t. There wasn’t enough air in this tiny space and his heart was beating so loud, he had the urge to press his hands to his ears. There were little black dots dancing around the edges of his vision. Clenching his eyes closed caused him to become even more dizzy. His blood sounded so
Tony debated for a second if he should just drop a frying pan or something, but then he shook his head about himself.
Tony hated that for a second his brain jumped to what the final straw would be to make Rogers more miserable than he has ever been before. If it would take the
At first Tony didn’t even know what the hell that was. What he was supposed to do with that.
Tony suppressed the urge to scream out loud right in her face and went for an easy smile instead.
Tony put his head in his hands, looking at Steve for a second. ”Really?”
”Yes.” Peter’s eyes sparkled in a bright brown with excitement. He looked so much like himand Steve, Tony didn’t know how many times he had to realize that till it stopped shocking him.
”You can’t honestly believe that this is true, I wouldn’t — I
”Yes,” he answered then finally, locking his eyes with Tony. ”We argued a long time about it. But you were right, Peter is smart and you’d rather drink boiling oil than let anything happen to Pete. You took every safety caution there was, so —”
But then he blacked out. He had blacked out all the time, since he didn’t lie down to sleep anymore, but this was different. He felt his whole body shutting down, felt his urge to
Tony flinched at those words to which Steve immediately shook his head.
at me like that, Jesus Christ, guys.” He couldn’t stand it.
He just felt tired today. Nothing in his life had ever worked out that bad but well before. Steve however seemed fully awake and enthusiastic, nodding to Pepper and then came right Tony’s way. Tony tried to not sigh in annoyance, it wasn’t this guy’s fault, that he obviously felt so light that he could just smilie brightly like that while Tony felt heavy ever since he got this sadness transmitted right into his brain 4 months ago.
“Yeah,” he answered lamely, tired of playing the same game over and over and not winning. There was no winning in there for him and he was old enough to accept that fact. Sometimes things just don’t have happy ends and he was one of those. He didn’t deserve one.
because somewhere on his long journey to get to this screwed up point, he’s built an aversion for food, and now he couldn’t even think of it without gagging. He wanted to change
So he just went to being what he knew he could be best. An asshole. Before he went insane.
He got ripped out of his thought from a tall, dark haired guy, who opened the door.
Before Tony could bite something back, though, he stopped himself and pulled his eyebrows together.
Rogers huffed a little laugh, not more than a slight nose exhale as if Tony had just remind him of something that had been really funny a long time ago. ”Stark Tower. Believe me, I was against that name, too. But you insisted. Even put the name on the outside, bold and glowing blue.”
“I’d never.”
being tortured in a cage and flying into a wormhole and then falling back to earth caused a hell of a lot nightmares but they all faded away after what had happened, “I can feel it. Every time I close my eyes I can feel the shield,
He needed to be careful. Natasha was the only person who hadn’t brought his weight up — except Steve and Bucky — and he needed to keep it that way. But he was already knee deep in a panic attack, couldn’t even make himself come up with an excuse. Natasha might be the only one who yet had to address this whole thing, but she was also the only person who had been eying him suspiciously for months now.
Steve nodded as if he understood the little sentence as what it was anyways. Tony didn’t know why it made him feel uneasy and simultaneously relaxed.
He felt new tears growing in his eyes, which he tried to suppress but failed miserably.
Tony.”
Peter grumbled and kept searching, loosing Tony’s attention.
Steve was the first one to notice him, immediately his eyes lit up and he made a bit of space next to him on the couch. “Hey, nice of you to join us.”
“Yeah, with great teeth too, but I don’t show them around weirdly as if every passing stranger is my dentist. And by the way, my father called me
This couldn’t be it. It can’t be. He shook his head violently and looked at Rhodey again with blurry vision.
“What does it feel like to love someone?” He needed to know. He was sure he felt it. Or at least a bit of it. Like he was really certain, he knew nobody would believe him, but he was. He just wanted to make sure that he didn’t mix things up here. He didn’t want to make Steve hope, just to disappoint him again.
He raised his head from Peter’s and looked at him instead.
“You may laugh now that I am more vulnerable okay but you also cannot love pancakes so who’s truly the loser.”
Tony was about to answer something equally sarcastic, when a shot of pain ran through his head.
“Tony? Tony. I gonna need you to breath for me, okay?”
”Yes, just little things here and there,” Tony said, keeping his voice low, to not catch Peter’s attention too much. ”Really, nothing big yet. Just Peter as a baby in your arms and a little bit of our wedding. By the way, really? White roses?”
Tony settled down on the couch, in which Rogers was sitting, folding laundry.
He spent the next three days in his bed in the medical wing in the Avenger’s HQ, bored out of his mind. Clint didn’t visit him anymore, neither did any of the others. Only Bruce checked in from time to time, always looking at him with his professional doctor face, which made Tony think that Bruce might have prohibited the others from visiting him. Or they really,
”He is one of our closest friends, you will see him around more often. I just thought you should at least know who he is.”
Steve nodded at the lack of answer, looking over to the big windows, just keeping his eyes on the glow of the city for a second before he turned back to Tony. ”I bet you have a lot of questions.”
“Yeah, yeah. You are the smartest.”
He didn’t succeed with that either.
”I don’t need them,” Tony stated confused and then regretted his words when Roger’s other corner of his mouth joined to one that was already pulled down. He looked older now. As if he had just lost a battle and didn’t know what to do with himself now. Well, neither did Tony. As far as Tony was concerned
And even if I am not,
“Sounds like love.”
”Yeah but
Also something really sad.
At least a bit.
He began to fidget with his feet before locking his eyes with Rogers, who just still looked sad. Hell, did Tony wish he’d finally see something else on this man’s face. Just about anything else.  A smile. Or even just anger.
”I remembered how we first met,” Tony said slowly, trying to look away from Steve but failing.
”8 years with one person? Jesus, you must be having mad skills in bed. Multiple orgasms and all.” Tony let his gaze wander on Rogers, crocking his head slightly. Rogers to his credit didn’t back down, he just stood as straight as always, while Tony was all but undressing him with his eyes.
Tony really had wanted to try, he had even gotten his hopes up that he might actually succeed. Working in the lab had been awesome. They had
Yeah, no.
Peter didn’t answer, just grasping the shirt of his father, keeping it in his fists, crying in his shoulder.
Why did everyone think that this child needed him around, all he did was break everything he touched.
Bucky nodded again, before taking his hand off Steve’s shoulder to pick up Peter’s little backpack from the floor. ”You keep an eye on him and I’ll take Peter, okay? Call if something changes!”
Tony tried to get up, but his head ached so badly he groaned quietly and laid back down.
He looked completely terrified, horrified to the core and Tony really didn’t know what caused that. What ever Rogers was thinking about just now must scare him deeply.
Steve looked happier than Peter for a second.
Memory or made up?
He swallowed dryly for what felt like an eternity, until he did what he could do best: making people believe what they wanted to believe. He lied for his whole life long, he could talk his sweet way out of this, he just needed to take a deep breath.
Rhodey clenched his right eye slightly. A little motion, nearly untraceable, but Tony fell silent instantly. This look on Rhodey couldn’t mean anything good. He was way too military to fidget or flinch but this little clench of his eye meant that something devastating was happening and Tony didn’t know what it was and how to react to it.
“It’s just —” Steve took a deep breath, his features still looked strong, his warrior expression always in place, “You mean the world to me, Tony. And I try to understand and I— I love to spend time with you and what we have is wonderful. It really is. But it’s — it’s hard to love somebody and never be loved back. And I tried to look past that because you seemed happy with us too, but it’s just not there, is it?”
you know
Rogers didn’t change the way he looked at Tony, just raising his eyebrows, as if Tony didn’t get something really easy. Tony hated that expression. He wasn’t stupid, that was like the only thing he was certain about right now and who the hell was Rogers to look at him like he was.
“Look at you, talking about spoiled, sitting in a kitchen in which you let others cook for you, in a tower you don’t pay rent for, drinking coffee that’s not yours,” Tony shot back and then turned back to Steve with a satisfied grin when all that Clint answered was a motion of him zipping his lips.
He could do it.
of you business, period. You copy that?”
“Yes,” Tony nearly
Tony didn’t have the energy to tell him that he wasn’t okay at all and he couldn’t think of the time when he last was. He just nodded, not wanting to lie.
Tony snorted again, not backing off. “That’s what you think, but I
“Wow, sounds like it extremely sucks.”
“I am certain, since I am willing to pay a shitload of money for your art.”
First of all, thank you for all your comments and kudos ! I've really enjoyed reading them (even though I don't really know how to answer, so I just - didn't) I'd love to read some more, though, don't be shy!  Just please make sure to actually comment on my writing etc. too; I know Steve looks bad in this chapter but I have a lot planned out and — I would just appreciate to read a bit more about my actual work - ♥️
Jesus, he’s met this guy twice and now he was jealous of his previous lovers?
A family in which Tony obviously didn’t fit in anymore.
Tony felt like he was really growing,
Tony exclaimed, only hearing distinctly how his heart monitor shot up a beat and the doctor taking a note, before walking closer to him, talking in a soft voice. ”There is a ring. Rhodes!”
”Your Daddy is still a little sick, Petey Pie,” Rogers chimed back in then, shooting Tony a look. ”He has to sleep a lot now, but he’ll join us together soon again.”
But than he threw the thought away faster than it came to him; he was Tony Stark. He was many things but not
How am I supposed to —” Clint turned his gaze to the floor, swallowed, his breath trembling, there was no fire behind his words anymore, he just looked tired. ”You could have died, Tony.”
“What do you feel right now?” Tony asked fast, catching himself and trying to change the topic back to the point.
Secondly, he knew that he shouldn’t be around kids. He’d fuck them up. He wasn’t good influence, he didn’t know how to be a father. He couldn’t let himself be close to this child. He didn’t know how anybody even ever decided that he’d be fitting as a father and gave him a child, be he knew they were wrong.
So of course he did what he did best and avoided it. He locked himself into the workshop and the only thing he succeeded at in the next few days was to not fall face first into a glass of scotch.
Steve stopped cutting for a second, shooting him a little smile. ”Yes, I did. You said it made my eyes pop.”
He tried to whisper it to himself but couldn’t bring himself to form those words, they felt weirdly heavy and
Yeah, if people could stop calling him that it’d be great. It still gave him a mini heart attack every time. That and the taste of
His mother cried a lot, but after she caught herself she tried her best, she hugged him tight and said that they’ll deal with it. She looked like she really believed that, determined to treat him like he was her everything. He was 17 when his parents died. He did not cry on the funeral. In fact, he stood there and wondered how much longer he’d have to wear the itching suit. He didn’t know it then, but he’ll regret the lack of sadness for his mother’s death for the rest of his life.
He really didn’t get it, though.
don’t care
on his tablet and began to read trough different notes of different inventions, all sounding more or less interesting.
”We’re married, it’s not inappropriate. I bet I had this dick in my mouth more often than either of us could count,” Tony stated bluntly, breaking the heavy eye contact just in favor to look if Rogers was blushing.
Tony could swear his world stopped spinning for a second.
“Of course it worked, what is it with you and hating on my machinery, seriously. See your roomie’s arm? All me. I know what I do, Rogers.”
“Weirdo.”
and I don’t understand a thing. I didn’t belong back there either, okay, but — you have

armor.
Tony just nodded while being deep in thought. He did feel warm and fuzzy, but it could not be. Like the doctor had told him, he was an apple with everything there to have seeds, but without them. He can’t just grow them, right? This was not possible, you cannot just find what you never lost. But there was something. He didn’t want to call it love, but he could think that it very well could be. Like in another world, another time, that would have been something real. So no, he didn’t want to call it love, but maybe. He just wanted to call it his
Tony didn’t know where this was coming from, but he just needed to get this out there. It felt like they were here to confess everything. As if they were in a little bubble right now, where they could talk openly about everything and Tony just
Tony raised his eyebrows and just starred.
”I wanted to talk to you.”
Tony wasn’t interested in that. He really didn’t care. He didn’t know why Rogers told him all that, since he hadn’t asked. But then something caught his interest against his intentions. ”Who did we fuck to get a child looking like
The man —
They asked him,
He focused back on the plans for Natasha’s new uniform, forgetting completely that Bruce was also in his lab, looking at different metals, trying to figure out how to make them as strong as Vibranium, until said man spoke up.
Rogers shot him a disapproving glare again and Tony really had to say that he was getting used to get that look shot his way.
He felt hopelessness spreading through his body.
”Where do you know me from?” Tony asked suspiciously, looking around the room for a panic button, finding one on his right side, out of reach.
Tony took the spoon in his hand and looked at the Mac’n’Cheese on it. Stared at it really, as if it just threatened to unplug Jarvis forever. He moved the spoon closer to his mouth, one inch at a time, he tried not think about what the ingredients were even though they seemed to be the only thing he could think of, glowing bright in his head - shining like a damn cheese star of Bethlehem.
Tony sighed and went to grab his tablet. For a second his hand hovered over the safari icon again, thinking about just googling himself and learn about everything he had been missing. Then he went and opened notes instead.
He could hear them scream every time he blinked. Tony didn’t know if it was a flashback or just something this creature had planted into his head, but he could feel it.
“You don’t have to say that.” Steve let his head hang low, obviously trying to not show that he was hurting.
his chest underneath, leaving him as an empty shell.
He got up from his seat in the workshop and looked around. Everything seemed normal. DUM—E was rolling around in the corner chasing who knows what and the constant little humming sound was still there too.
The following weeks went back to being uneasy with Natasha, but he got it. He could handle himself, avoiding people was his new best talent, and it wasn’t as if Natasha desperately wanted to talk again. They just ignored each other, until Black Widow saved him in a mission by shooting a guy sneaking up on Tony, who was in the middle of putting his suit on. They both shared a tiny smile and nod and that was pretty much the end of it. They still weren’t best friends, hell, they
Tony blinked and tried to not freak out until he was in the relative privacy of the elevator. They knew. They
Steve sniffed slightly. Tony noted with shock that his bright blue eyes had teared
“Why so sure? I never showed you my teeth because I got a good grade, now did I?”
. Yeah? Who am I really, huh?”
”Did you wear a blue tux to our wedding?” Tony asked casually at the breakfast table, watching Steve cutting the crust off Peter’s PB&J.
“You don’t get to tell me what to do, Rogers. This is
“Startling is a response from your body to an unexpected loud noise or sudden movement. It’s basically like a reflex.”
He could’ve just died and would’ve been
“Legolas? Could I speak to you for a second?” His voice sounded strained, he barely recognized it himself. Unfortunately wasn’t he the only one who realized how off he sounded, Steve immediately turned around and raised an eyebrow.
”Excuse me?” Rogers took a deep breath, his hands loosen around the fabric, any hint of the beginning of frustration or shock was just pushed away as if it had never been there to begin with.
They sat in silence for a few seconds before Tony rubbed his head in thought. ”Steve, what was that phone call about?”
“This is a hard one. Many people say it’s one of the worst emotions ever. It’s just when you feel no hope in anything, like at all. When you just want to give up, because nothing seems to work, I guess. When you just fail so many times at something that you begin to fail to see the point behind it.”
Steve didn’t change his hopeless expression, but nodded slightly at Tony, as if he too just wanted to get everything to how it was before but couldn’t.
Tony nodded seriously, like he was considering the kid's words and then stood up so slowly that he could swear Peter was about to burst from his impatience.
He was tempted to do so, for a second. Just to remind Rogers one more time that he wasn’t whoever he was when he had married him. To show him that they didn’t share a
“But I do.”
Made him look young and playful. As if he had never experienced pain or hurt. As if he was just deeply happy.
“You are happy, this is—” He cut himself off in laughter and looked down to Tony who smiled. He actually
It made him feel warm and fuzzy and home as if it was the only thing he knew for certain right now.
Call it karma, or fate but he needed more, he needed to know. He just had to know what else was out there in the world.
”Yeah, I get it. Also, don’t bother apologizing,” Tony was so sick of empty excuses,
Steve looked at him like there was nothing on earth he wanted less than getting laid texts from his husband. But at the same time as if he really did want one.
He also never had the chance to be the son his father wanted. His father was disappointed in him
Peter felt like the centre of his universe and he couldn’t even really remember him.
He’d be the first one to admit that he was an asshole. Yeah, his first step had been to be downright rude to everybody, but Jesus.
“So then why did you do it? Why not keep all that warm and fuzziness to yourself?” Tony was honestly confused. Everybody else kept it for themselves at least. Well, okay, admittedly, who in their right mind would donate a bit of something positive? It was human nature to hold on to what makes life worth living.
”You know what,” Tony continued, suddenly doubting that this had been a good idea. Steve obviously needed a break, he was all but raising their son alone right now. ”Maybe this was a bad idea. You can go freshen up, don’t worry about it.”
time caught up to him again. What was he doing?
”Really awesome.”
“I can and I do,” Tony began to ramble, looking Steve up and down, he had
“You are human. The mistakes you made while not feeling anything do not change that. That you weren’t able to feel does not change that either. You are worth so much more than you know. You live your life in anger and hate and sadness, I can see it all over your face, but you deserve so much more. You deserve to be happy, too. You deserve to love something and not just
”You ruined my surprise proposal?” Tony teased. Steve looked back up at him, the happy edge still in place, making him look younger.
and even his name deserved all the love there was. Tony felt like he’d scream because of the pain that spread through his whole body. Resigned, he clench his eyes. This is what he’s become. He just waited for Steve to say his name and then scream in agony. He swallowed dryly over 10 times, until he could focus again.
Or maybe it was.
there was a time when Tony had fit in there but now all he could do was enlighten fires that Rogers had to take care of later then.
feel love and not just joy?” His voice tripped in the obvious attack and arrogance and he did not hate it. He felt
Tony sighed, locked the tablet and all but threw it onto his nightstand. Well, that all hadn’t worked out.
Hey :-)
“I love you, Tony, but it hurts.” He had this look on his face, the same resigned expression Tony’s mother sometimes had. Tony thought back to the day he buried her, being bored by it all. She died thinking probably this exact thing. Tony suppressed something that would have definitely sounded like a whimper.
Rogers turned around and put the plate in one drawer before turning back, making his way to his son’s bedroom door. Before he could reach it, though, and check on the kid he turned around again, looking at Tony remorseful again, but in a more pitying way.
Not that Tony didn’t understand that train of thought, but Jesus.
He didn’t look back when he left the room in a hurry, not wanting to see the disappointment on the kid’s face. Seriously, how did they ever make the mistake of giving him a child, all he ever did was fuck it up.
Tony opened the door slowly and closed it behind him.
Rhodes jumped a bit, obviously a bit too deep in self congratulating thoughts and looked down at him again, his mouth in a frown.
”Well, before you give me any details I don’t want to know,” Bucky answered, also watching Steve’s blush amused, ”I’ll head home. Peter is pretty exhausted but he didn’t eat dinner yet. I brought little dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets for him, that
Tony laughed, liking how it felt to finally do that again. He didn’t remember the last time he had felt this light. Maybe it was just an adrenal high, but he was actually feeling really okay right now. As if he could beat anything that came his way, step by step.
Tony didn’t know why the image of the sad man didn’t want to leave his head for hours. It was weirdly attached to every thought he had. As if his body was telling him that sad Rogers was a bad thing as if he had the energy to give a fuck.
The child shook his head and put the strand behind his ear and then yawned wide mouthed.
he wakes up, everything would be different. For a second he wished he wouldn’t, because he really couldn’t tell if he’d be strong enough to deal with all of that.
Obviously, the playboy piece didn’t fit.
, but he didn’t want to hear the answer really. He couldn’t stand to listen to Jarvis telling him just how much all the recent events affected him and how
“Exactly.” Tony was just really confused if he was being honest. The fast change of Steve’s posture making his head spin.
As if he had held the hope that Tony might just disagree and they’d find a solution till now.
Tony looked at him for a short moment in the same way he looks at a problem with his tech that he tries to figure out, as his sluggish mind processed the words thrown at him. Eventually he just shook his head and gestured to himself.
it, right? Is it more of a reflex?”
Steve’s expression shifted to painfully sympathetic in the blink an eye, mouthing Oh, Tony like a silent prayer.
He found the answer to Steve’s misery on his fifth glass of water. Because apparently his future self was clean of drinking and he didn’t know why, but it felt wrong to drink then, now.
was something so complicated that Tony needed it visualized.
Tony screwed up his nose, not knowing where to begin. Then he closed his eyes, took a deep breath and began to type.
Tony took a deep breath, shaking his head as if he could make his words go away.
Rogers just looked resigned as if he already knew that Tony would answer that. Tony felt like the man gave him the urge to roll his eyes more often than any other human being.
Tony had heard when Steve had left at 5 in the morning like some sort of maniac. Then again the fact that Tony himself had been awake stopped him from saying anything about it.
He screwed up so badly that everybody saw it, and there was no way to hide his weakness away anymore.
Tony was really glad that he had sworn off the habit to blush. He had cried when he found out that he’d get a child? Yeah, no, thanks.
”You remembered?” Steve said, his eyes looking a bit more glassy than they did mere seconds ago.
”Yes!” Peter exclaimed, jumping up and down, obviously not catching up that his Daddy had no idea how that was exciting.
”We both know you’d never hurt me, though,” Bucky sassed, batting his eyelashes at Steve.
But that right there was the bigger problem.
“So what’s your deal, man?”
“Depends on how afraid you are, I guess. Sometimes it just — hits you cold and leaves you shivering for the rest of the day. It can be so bone deep that it paralyzes you, feeling like a hand around your heart. But it can also be small, like just — You can get startled, right?”
The problem was that it was not a good thing.
enough to believe any words that come out of his mouth ever again.
“I gave you a bit of determination, courage, and self-confidence. And now stop moping and go get your
Tony gasped suddenly, ripping his eyes from SR and then turned to look back to Rhodey who only nodded slightly at him, answering a question he had already forgotten, because his mind just yelled
breakable thing any further.
He stepped closer to Sam, keeping a respectful distance but still threateningly close.
problem, it was certainly a mistake. A big one, too. Because no matter what, in the end Tony would be miserable.
Steve nodded again, smiling his weird private smile again. The little curl around his lips that looked like nothing but obviously meant everything. He looked so happy for a second that Tony was completely taken aback. Steve always looked so sad, this little happy edge around his eyes gave his face something unfamiliar, something really strange.
I hope you have a great day!! (It had like 37 degrees in Germany a few days ago and I have no recovered from it, so I hope you had better summer experiences than me, dying in the sun)
He knew better than that.
She sounded as neutral as always, eyeing him suspiciously, while he clenched his hands so tight that his fingernails dug their way into his palm. He tried to look her into the eyes, an easy lie on his lips but he
The night before they sent him to the first of many therapists, his dad came into his room. He looked down at him, shaking his head over and over, before kneeling down in front of Tony’s bed and looked right into his eyes, as if there were all the answers they apparently all searched for.
And he was ready to tell Steve just that. That he was certain that what he felt for him was the only real thing he ever had in his life. He wanted to burst it out, whenever he saw Steve drawing or making coffee for Tony, because he had the energy to run 5 miles at 4 am but Tony could barely hold up a cup that early. And every time Steve laughed and looked at him, like he felt it too, Tony wanted to tell him.
”You do have great thighs, man”, Clint nodded at Sam in agreement, who turned his head back to Tony, grinning downright dirty.
Tony got the message that Rogers was trying to get across. Or maybe he wasn’t and he just assumed that people always had a subtext and hidden meaning to anything, because he had always had to deal with two faced people.
because he didn't
. He didn’t really give a damn. He didn’t know this Rogers guy, he had woken up with no hope to change the end his life was leading to. He didn’t need a husband and kid to have a good life, either. He never needed anybody. He had never intended to drag others in the mess he called his life and it wouldn’t change now either. Even though in the past he had seemed to have changed.
As if he knew that saying any of this out loud would spook Tony.
For the next second, though, Steve looked even sadder than he felt. He doesn’t want that.
Yet, there was something like an I Dare You in his expression. As if he had nothing left to lose and no problem showing that to Tony. Showing him that he hadn’t stopped fighting even though he had lost.
Tony tried to turn his head slightly, worsening the ache in it and then tried to take a sharp breath, but his chest felt heavy, as if there was a weight on him that he couldn’t shake.
Tony shook his head and stared at fact #5 as if it had personally attacked him.
And how painfully aware of it Tony was that it was true.
“How are you, Tony?” He asked though. His tone was not in accusing, but rather actually interested.
Tony swallowed heavily and then went back to put his not — caring mask on. Two faced people only had a chance of hurting him, when he let them come too close.
both of us?” He asked roughly, not caring about his language.
Tony drank a sip of his coffee and closed his eyes in temporary content; he really needed that.
him as if he weren’t the person that ruined Tony for anybody or anything else really.
Life went on for three and a half days, in which Tony desperately tried to act like he always had. This was much harder then he thought it would be. He lived with two
“You’re not here to get my arm, right?” The man prompted and looked down on Tony like he was the biggest idiot he has ever seen, but still nice and warm. How ever that was possible was a big question mark to Tony. Then again, he just lost his shit about being happy, so there’s that.
to which Tony only nodded slightly, not knowing what exactly she meant by that, but thinking that the car had looked pretty in the store and as if it will fit perfectly into his collection.
”Yeah, everything comes flying right into your hands, eh?"
He had fucked up.
It was a boy. Maybe 4 or 5, Tony honestly couldn’t tell. He had curly brown hair and brown eyes and was grinning down at Tony excitedly, little white teeth slightly crooked and having something that looked like a piece of a chocolate muffin stuck between them.
”Jesus Tony, look at you, walking around, casually putting the

Tony stood in the shower, feeling worse than ever before, while Steve -of all people-

to help him. It certainly didn’t anymore, did it ?
He began rambling excuses and explanations and Tony had no other choice but to swallow them like disgusting pills, without really paying attention to what he even spewed out.
Tony just stared down at him in wonder. Staring some more. Blinking.
Tony blinked and then ran after him.
“You have a beautiful office, Mr. Stark.” He opened his note book and then laid it in front of Tony, who looked down on a drawn picture of his tower and the city around it. It must’ve been late evening when Steve had drawn it, Tony noted. The shadows of the city played on the walls of the building, making it look like it’s exactly on the thin line between drawing and photograph.
Tony only nodded.
The kid who had called him
Sam and Clint barked out a laugh and even Bucky made a huffing sound. Tony found himself able to take a real breath for the first time since the elevator doors opened and the other half of the team walked in.
child has 4029 uncles.”
He didn’t think he ever felt like his heart literally ripped in two, but looking at Peter crying like this? Yes. That’s what it felt like.
The first thing he saw was —
“Stark?”
Clint handed him the coffee pot, before Tony could even do as much as open his mouth, which caused him to nearly propose to the archer on the spot.
“Jesus, everybody knows gentlemen don’t ask questions about weight.” Tony grinned jokingly at him, hoping that the other man couldn’t hear his heart beating way too fast and frantic in his chest as his panic grew.
Steve looked down to the floor for a second, taking a deep breath, before chuckling in a downright heart breaking way. So hopeless that Tony would swear he felt it too. When Steve looked back up, though, he just looked serious and sad, as always.
”Buck,” Steve said seriously, ”I swear to god, if you buy Pete a dog, I’ll take you down.”
”Hey! How are you? You really scared us at breakfast,” Steve said, his voice quiet. He sat down next to Tony’s legs, but not touching him.
He didn’t even have an excuse. He had fucked it up and there were no words to say to make it better.
”Yeah,” he answered simply, as a matter of fact. Might as well.
His Daddy had no idea who he was and was less than not even a bit enthusiastic to find it out.
, did everyone of his new —
“Stop it, Barton.” Bruce laid one hand on the archer’s shoulder, but he shrugged it off.
”I am,” he noted that he sounded way more certain than he was. Also pissed off, keeping the mask on that he didn’t care even though he had the weird feeling that Steve wasn’t fooled by it anymore, or maybe never has been to begin with.
Perfect.
Rogers blinked. ”My dick.”
”No, I wanna hug Daddy!” The kid whined and Tony was about to try to suffocate himself with a pillow. He couldn’t stand this whining. It caused him a headache he really didn’t need right now.
Rationally, he knew that. Theoretically too.
“I am serious. I love you. But I am also having a really hard time telling what is real and what isn’t right now. And I’ve got like a shit ton of nightmares trapped behind my eyelids.”
”Who? What?”
Tony flinched at how defeated he sounded.
”Yes.”
He was doing okay and then he woke up with black coffee and the ability to count his bones.
slightly opened mouth. Visibly connecting the dots in his head, taking Tony’s seemingly random rambling as what it was.
out there in the world, but it’s different with you,”
Bruce spoke up again, not looking green but certainly on his way to get there.
here, you could’ve talked to
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve kneeled down in front of his son, zipping his rain coat all the way up and then ruffled his hair. ”I’ll be with you in a sec, Pete. Want to wait by the door?”
Steve breathed in deeply, not losing his posture. Tony kind of wished he did, just to know where they stood. But Steve stayed contained, nodding shortly.
”No, nothing happened,” Tony reassured and then turned to look at Steve, with what he hoped was an honest expression. ”I just wanted to finally use the rain check for asking you a few questions.”
Till then, Trying had to be enough.
Tall Blonde crossed the room in four heavy steps and then lifted the child —
He didn’t know if he could stand the sheer weight of it.
His eyes snapped back to his hand that was still awkwardly hovering over Steve’s shoulders till Tony felt downright ridiculous.
“Why did you do it?” Tony burst out. He immediately tried to finally get a hold of that grip he’d wanted to get when he saw Bucky in the door frame.
The aching pain that was muted throughout the whole day came back, so sudden and with such force that Tony couldn’t even believe that others go through that when they are just teenagers. Seriously, how do they survive that.
But he couldn’t. Not when he didn’t have any scientific explanation for it. He needed strong facts to prove himself. Not even for Steve per se, more for himself. He needed to know that he didn’t go crazy. The strong feeling of doubt pumping through his veins, special thanks to whoever had donated this one.
“Yeah, yeah. I just need to talk to Barton for a moment.”
A reminder? A warning?
“No, you don’t,” Steve shot back equally as fast.
”I’ll make dinner,” Steve all but whispered and walked to the open kitchen.
Rhodey coughed and began to laugh in honesty. “Shit, okay, stop, stop. You look like you want to eat me alive.”
Rogers, though, looked like he believed they had. Like they were important and needed to be said.
”Not even I am that much of a dick,” Tony bit out, seeing Steve flinching around his face, as if he had actually a much poorer reaction to Tony’s answer and tried to contain it.
But what he knew for certain, at least in retrospect, was that it was that pride that made him look at Peter and say his next words. The quiet before the storm.
in the back of his mouth.
Tony’s heart did absolute not break some more when Steve said
This was doomed to fail, because of course it was.
that was.
that was something that he wouldn’t be able to shake off, ever.
and they weren’t close friends, hell, they  were barely more than room mates.
”I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you.”
Steve threw him the most unbelieving gaze that had ever been thrown his way and answered nothing. He just kept looking like he tried to figure Tony out like a puzzle, till he seemed to have found his answer, his expression shift to something determined, and began to stand up.
And maybe, yeah, it was Tony’s turn to finally be brave too.
Tony couldn’t help but thinking that he might just be past his saving point. Maybe there just were some people who didn’t deserve any more chances. So the universe just watched him trying hopelessly to fix himself but failing, until he gave up and just did what Banner told him, feeling less and less like a person and more and more like a robot. So maybe these things people said about him, that he was just a machine, didn’t care for anything, yeah maybe those things were true after all. He was the walking image of a train wreck, ghosting around, keeping his mouth shut, overworked and restless, more watching himself fade away than anything else.
Another laugh and then hushed voices on the other line, Tony sat up, hoping to hear more, but in vain.
Tony huffed dismissively, not even considering to put sugar or milk into his coffee.
”Cap,” Tony held onto his cup of coffee like it was his life line, “What are you doing here?”
and focused back on the plans for Bucky’s new arm. He had been working on it since he returned to his lab.
Rogers nodded slightly. ”Basically.”
"I wasn’t planning to,” Steve murmured and rolled on to his back, looking and the ceiling with a little smile on his lips,"There is no need to fix something that isn’t broken, Tony.”
was this dude?
”Yeah, Cap, I’ve got lots of work to do. Actually, if you could send Bucky down here, I’ve got a new mechanism for his arm, that should allow him to —”
“Well, there hadn’t been anything we couldn’t beat together yet.”
When it hit him, though, he all but fell back into his chair, ripping his eyes wide open. “What the —“
He huffed. Why would he care? They weren’t even his. They belonged to a stranger. A stranger whose ring he had on his finger.
It had felt like memory coming back to him and it was awful. It hurt. Tony sat up and stretched his head, how could Natasha even still look at him? It was he who has told her that, who asked her about the one thing that he
Looking at Steve for the first time after he had nearly killed Tony might have been the hardest thing Tony has ever had to go through. He went through abuse and torture, he’d been put under water for so long that he forgot what air in his lungs felt like, he watched the people he trusted betray him, without the ability to even do as much as
All that mattered was Tall Blonde who rubbed his left hand and Tony didn’t even need to look to be sure that he was playing with a wedding ring, that would be the twin to the one on his own hand.
It was true. And he needed to know that Steve knew that. It was too easy to begin to hope now, he had been there. The thought
Tony never ate an apple again.
He didn’t know what Steve wanted from him, but he sounded so hurt, so serious that Tony was about to agree just to make Steve stop looking as defeated as he did.
“Well, you obviously ain’t able to do that now, are you?” Sam looked at him with narrowed eyes. “This is
Tony watched as a long string of cheese fell from the spoon down onto the table, and without thinking for another second he let go of the whole spoon and listened to it fall on the floor
Firstly, his past — future self had left incredible footsteps, expectations in others, that Tony could never
Tony found his way into the kitchen after staring at blue holograms for the better part of the week, not really paying any attention to anything, which caused him to totally
Steve would apologize, say that he didn’t mean to hurt Tony, but Bucky was just more important, always had been, and Tony didn’t need to hear that. He had been through many bad things in his life, too many to even count, but Steve saying that he wasn’t good enough -even though he tried his best for Steve for
“Fuck you, Steve. I don’t need your pity, I don’t need you supervising me; I am
The man in front of him laughed and just nodded, still looking like he thought that Tony went crazy.
Hi hello! I hope you liked this chapter, if so - let me know. Comments always make me really happy :-)
Still, the ongoing chatter sounded like mockery to him. Everything he heard in a loop in his head was Natasha telling him over and over again to not be an asshole,
that he hadn’t done enough to show Steve that he meant it. The list went on and he felt weaker with every second. He had never in is life felt this much pain before.

just for once.
He ended up under the head piece of the machine not even 15 minutes after that, just pressing okay on the next request, not looking into it. He needed something to distract him from the ever present thought of his mother. It didn’t seem to leave him. He needed something else to focus on than sadness.
“Didn’t? Well, good, that would be outlandish and fantastic. I’m just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistake that I’ve made, largely public —”
Tony thought back when he first felt hate. He had figured it would be directed towards his father. Who’d known that he’d feel hate for the first time for nobody but himself? He shook his head and gave Steve a crooked grin, accepting the challenge.
He totally lost sight, really. When did this whole thing even
He ignored the voice in his head that told him that if he really was doing all right, he wouldn’t treat a little kid who couldn’t grasp the situation right now, as if he was being unreasonable.
Still, he had fucked up. He had made the kid sad and well, if there was somebody who literally had no fault at all about all of this, it was him.
. If that didn’t work out? Well, nobody had to know but him.
And Tony faded a bit more, every time he blinked.
“That’s okay. I just want to know why so many people make movies about it. Write songs. Why can mothers lift cars when their
to eat, don’t you see that?”
He didn’t know why he deserved to feel bad when thinking about that. He wondered if he could just ask Rogers that.
“Oh, I’d never doubt you, great Mr. Stark, who just paid for one of my drawings with what will be my next 6 months rents and I hope will do that again.” Steve attempted a little bow, which caused Tony to laugh again and shake his head.
He had nothing to prove, they wouldn’t believe him anyway. For them he was just the son of a brilliant man, who made him a billionaire, and who happened to be a genius. Pure luck.
“You need to get your ass up and out there. This is not healthy, this is not
“I can handle myself,” Tony deadpanned in the similar tone other people say: 'I only got 6 months to live.' And who knows, as far as he’s concerned, this was a possibility and depressingly likely.
The only one catching one had been Clint and he didn’t even know what he caught on. Tony would be okay, he could fix that; he was good at fixing things.
And it shouldn’t be as terrifying as it was, but hell if Tony had ever felt smaller in his life.
He had Sam’s new wings finished before the first evening and updated those within the next 5 hours a total of 7 times.
Nothing really changed for him. When he loses a bit of his hair then so be it, he’s 47, it had to happen eventually. His cheeks sunk a little? So what. He had amazing cheek bones, no need to worry to much. The only thing was that he caught every virus out there. It seemed like he could’t stop coughing, but no reason to worry there.
He through a wink at Wilson and placed his now empty mug in the sink behind him, before he walked, still quietly snickering, past them all in the direction of his workshop. He totally did not blush when he got a little glance of Steve’s reddened neck and ears, clearly thinking about the fact that Tony loved to beg for more while getting fucked by him.
Nailing it. Just a bit more vague next time please.
He was about to book tickets planning to fly about anywhere, when he sat back against the headboard heavily.
”Tony, what do you mean?” He asked, voice slow and calculated as if he was trying to keep himself from reacting poorly. The kid seemed to get this too, because he just stared questionably at his father now, little pout on his face.
Tony kind of hated that it became something he enjoyed to do. Asking Rogers inappropriate things, lashing out, be disrespectful and watch him squirm. Rogers struck him as someone who didn’t back down from a fight when he got the slightest feeling of injustice but he didn’t fight Tony. He held back.
”Dude,” Tony opened one eye to look at Sam, who returned his gaze rather baffled, in a not quite horrified but disconcerted manner, “Did you lose weight? Like
knew she was never loved.
”I am glad, Tony. I knew we could fix this, together.”
The breakfast after that was so loaded with heavy silence that Tony was sure it’d suffocate him. He knew that he had kind of lost his right to actually fit into this family and frankly, yeah, he had done his best to not ever fit in again, but damn.
the room behind his closed eyes got darker and Tony dared to attempt another try in opening his eyes and looking at his surroundings, ”
He didn’t.
. He got up and scratched his head, did something even happen? Did the machine break already? He felt the normal sadness creep into him again, right when a drop of water from one of the pipes above his head, fell down onto his forehead.
Tony counted it as the biggest win he had ever scored.
There was an obvious challenge to his words, he dared him to treat him like this
Drunken him, nonetheless.
Because it’s
”What?” Tony asked, his voice weirdly quiet, as if his vocal cords have just agreed that this whole conversation was something so secretive that it needed to be kept quiet and close.
But it felt like he was making a mistake.
. He was forced to make speeches in front of thousand of people by the age of 9. He had been interviewed long before that. And
— even thinking this word together with Steve’s name made him want to curl up and never face daylight again — with Steve was so icy. He just couldn’t bring himself to look into those blue eyes for longer than a few painful seconds and being in a room with him made Tony feel as if his toe nails curled up.

All he saw before he closed his eyes again, though, was a yellowed celling and the figure of a

he was feeling nervous. Tony send a quick curse to whoever had transmitted that emotion, before he looked back into his full body mirror and looked himself up and down.
”It’s really good to be back.”
He flinched away and then held his hand closer to his face.
Just like he didn’t keep all of that emotion. They all faded, but left traces. And also, once you felt it, how could you forget. Once the brain learns how interpret those signals, it does not forget. Just like you won’t forget how yellow the sun is just because you lost sight of it.
Tony tried to open his eyes and immediately gave up, finding them sticking together and not a drop of strength in him to fight it.
Weirdo.
He actually needed Jarvis to tell him over and over again. Every little information was so important, every little fact had to be memorized but still there seemed to be no way for Tony to grasp all the info. It just seemed to be the first thing Tony couldn’t get into his head no matter how hard he tried.
“You are
Rogers hands gripped tighter around the dinosaur shirt and honestly, nobody should be allowed to look this finished with their lives while holding a neon blue kid’s shirt with tiny green dinosaurs on it in their hands.
“It’s not nothing, Tony. I know that look. Something is bothering you, and you can talk to the others just fine so it had to be me.”
”Well, I certainly know that this hurt.” He sounded a little like a pouting child and he knew that, but he also knew that it felt like all the negative, faded emotions came back at once. He feared to lose Steve so badly, it nearly brought him to his knees. And he was sad, so
Weirdly specific, J, didn’t I tell you that watching people in their sleep is creepy. I really should —,” Tony couldn’t help but cough, doubling over and then falling back in pain, which shot up his back and his rip cage all the same.

she truly hated about herself right to her face.
He got along quite well with Clint, their constant teasing just never wore off and it was nearly as if their ‘war' had never happened. Their jokes came easy and naturally. Tony grew more and more confident and less threatened around him.
Peter’s bottom lip began to wobble and his eyes began to shine glassy in the light of the workshop.
“Okay, Tony,

he had drunken a whole glass of water and eaten a half of an apple and a piece of bread. He felt oddly full and empty all at once.
Living with the team was easy — or at least easier than he expected. He got along well with them once they got over the first few awkward conversations and guilt-fueled, half-hearted apologies, that rung in Tony’s head over and over again. He was so done with lies and he could just see that those apologies were everything but 100% from the heart.
But he was determined to try.
What was the protocol now? What should he do? He can’t just leave Steve sitting here, his back will kill him tomorrow and he always seemed to be carrying the damn child, too, so he might die of it.
“Yeah, kinda.”
Definitely dropping a lot of balls.
“No, no you don’t know,” Tony closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the back of the couch, “Don’t feel bad about it though, I don’t know myself either. Because the funny thing is,” he sounded much more sober now, for some reason he couldn’t pinpoint. It was as if him being resigned just took everything out of his system, “What makes you the man you are, huh?”
And he suffered through realizing this. A new wave of
Tony’s eyes wandered to his left hand, inspecting the ring before pulling it off, feeling as if it would burn his skin if he left it on one second longer. He shouldn’t be wearing it. He didn’t want to. He didn’t belong to anyone, he wasn’t married. His mind-set wasn’t, anyway.
Not the kid.
“Just make sure to get a bit of sleep after breakfast, you look like a ghost.”
Now he wasn’t so sure what it had been.
“Okay,” he says, “you wanna try that again?"
Peter nodded seriously, picking the blue car up too, holding it next to the red one. ”Yes! He says that it’s more practi — practical.”
“I think we all have had our fair share of life changing events.” Steve looked really tired for a second before he seemed to snap out of it.

Tony waited for Steve to continue, but he just rubbed the back of his head and looked at Tony with his blue eyes, silently begging Tony to just

Tony nodded, not adding that he felt like one, too.
Tony scoffed, too, nodding in a way that might seem careless but might have been something much deeper than that.
“Nah, you know what, J? I’ll go there personally. Gimme his contact info, why don’t you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He didn’t. He felt as if Rogers couldn’t answer this question right now anyway.
He didn’t want to think about it too much.
And maybe this was the way his life told him that his plan of dying alone while partying was back on the top of the list, because he had had his chance. And he had acted wrong.
, right now. He just wanted to fall back asleep and wake up being 27 years old again. ”Daddy is hurt, you could overwhelm him.”
He didn’t know to feel about it, didn’t know if he was allowed to feel as proud as he did.
Steve continued, though, without letting Tony answer. ”So I can’t keep you from leaving. But please remember that this is your home. You worked hard for this. Don’t do that to Peter.”
”He does feel better, he is not hurt as badly anymore,” Rogers fell silent for a bit, waiting for Peter to nod, as he caught up with what his father told him. ”But his head is still not fully recovered yet. Daddy needs many breaks and can’t take care of you as much right now, he needs silence to get better, you understand that, right?”
Tony nodded at him and then went straight to the coffee machine, watching Sam out of the corner of his eye.
Steve looked unbelievably tired, and hell, Tony did feel this sort of tiredness too, deep inside his bones. He felt like he was losing a war here too, and wasn’t that just his whole life in a nutshell.
Tony snapped his fingers and opened his eyes. “Your experiences paired with
Tony couldn’t hep but laugh again a little, despite himself.He then pulled his eyebrows together, while drinking the rest of his coffee and then took his cup to the sink. ”Isn’t that like dangerous for such a little child?” He asked, looking over his shoulder at
He was pretty sure he already did, but he couldn’t tell. Right now it was more of strong sense of ‘He does not deserve to be breathing in the same oxygen as regular people'. He wanted to be able to
Their.
But before he walked through the door, he turned back halfway, shooting Tony the most hopeless but determined look that has ever been shot his way.
Then he just made an uncaring hand motion, not trusting his voice to not break just yet.
Steve nodded, “Fair enough, Tony.”
“Go easy, Clint,” Bruce said warningly, while stepping into the room and closing the door behind him.
Peter.
Right now, he didn’t want to be his old self, but he didn’t know how to be his new self, either. His Dad used to tell him that Stark men were made of iron, but now he felt like many different things stitched together.
Tony would be the last person to admit that he had to blink tears away before answering. ”I’ve never seen it here. But I remembered it.”
be going out on a limb here and just tell you that I know that you know.”
. He just kind of appeared from one moment to the next. Tony only knew that Steve met him while running and
Well, forgetting his whole family was a sign that he didn’t deserve that, if he’d ever seen one. It was better to let that all go now, he obviously wasn’t destined to be happy and he has had all his life to accept that.
“Finish that sentence, Steve, I dare you.”
Damn right,
This might have been the first moment in months in which Tony felt a bit lighter again, even though it ended pretty quickly after Bucky brought up Steve and —
Really, Steve might’ve been the person he finally thought of as worth of his trust but he knew better now. Tony knew exactly how things like that ended.
reigned over him, so strong that it brought him to his knees. Then he saw it clearly. He needed Steve. He wanted him by his side forever. He wanted to wake up to his blue eyes and then walk around in his shirt that was too wide for him and then laugh with him about stupid things all days long.
Tony felt his whole body relax when he saw his best friend standing there. ”Thank
The first one to notice Tony though was Lucky, who jumped back to stand on all four of his paws and walk excitedly in his direction. Tony just petted one time over his golden ears and then went to Clint to take the coffee pot out of his hands.
When he sat down under the transmitter that evening he felt like breaking down, waiting for the next storm to hit him. He had played this game for months now, he was just so sick of losing. But he needed to — he needed to
Practically, though, did the world look a great deal different.
Before either of them could say anything, though, Peter came running from his room, jumping on Tony’s lap.
Tony took a deep breath and than looked right into Natasha’s eyes. He was about to lay all his cards on the table, because he knew what everyone thought of him, but he will not stand here and listen to someone accusing him of being stubborn, as if all this had anything to do with that.
”Yeah, we might get a dog, depending on whether or not Peter sheds a few tears at the shelter,” Steve sighed resigned, looking like he was already trying different scenarios as to how to break it to Peter that they couldn’t keep a dog here in his head.
“Anytime, I mean it.”
But that moment in the kitchen at 3 am in the morning, when Bucky poured coffee into a cup for himself and then totally understandingly filled one for Tony too, with two sugars and three spoonfuls of milk. Bucky then sat down on the sofa beside him, looking at him thoughtfully before spilling that he was sorry - the first apology which didn’t sound like a lie, unlike all the others Tony had to hear from the rest of the team. Tony could still see it in front of him, how honest Bucky looked at him, told him that he was really sorry for everything.
“What?” Steve looked bewildered but still extremely tired.
He didn’t answer, just watched how the silence stretched through the room more and more, till Rogers’ straight posture sunk as his shoulders dropped.
Steve chuckled lowly, reaching for his glass of orange juice. ”Worth a shot. So I like white roses, sue me.”
Tony grabbed the chain and pulled the tags over his head, they felt weirdly heavy, as if they were pressing down on his chest with the weight of all the things he had forgotten. ”Here,” he said to Rogers, who looked back down to the tags and then startled back up at Tony. Weird, the terror on his face looked so out of place, since all he’s seen on it till now had been sadness and confusion.
He couldn’t be in his own nightmare when he was awake too, he just couldn’t.
Tony was about 110% done with Rogers’s lost puppy look, so he sighed and spun around to face him. ”What?”
. Blue, with a tiny bit of green. Yeah, Tony needed to be more careful, because once you stared into those eyes for too long, they began to feel a lot like
“Like pain? Can I hit you and you won’t feel it?” Rhodey made the attempt to punch Tony’s leg, that was stretched out next to him, but missed by a couple of inches, so he barely scratched the denim of his washed out blue jeans.
His words are still strong, even as his face fell a little with every syllable. Steve just nodded, tiny smile on his lips, obviously not really believing anything that Tony just said, but too exhausted to discuss it further.
He just needed to convince himself some more that he actually really didn’t want to talk to Steve about it, because right now everything in him yelled to just go and talk, but he couldn’t.
He then left the room after making sure that Tony was alright, and Rhodey went with him, much to Tony’s misery.
“Sure, I love you, brother. When you could just shut up some more —”
“It’s Tony for you, Steve, Mr. Stark makes me sound way older than I am.”
It had all started with him showing Peter the last dot on his drawing and then watching him being excited of the picture of a giraffe it now showed.
about it. He was 47, not an insecure teenager who wants to fulfill the world’s ridiculous body expectations. He was 47 years old, billionaire, superhero, and a genius.
He couldn’t
”Peter and I,” Tony clarified, looking towards the way Peter had disappeared to, a few minutes ago.
He smiled one last time at her face, in which no emotion was showing but a clear
Bucky let out a deep breath, not even looking at the plate but right into Tony’s eyes. He was definitely sending a warning his way and Tony got it. Hell, the last thing he wanted was to hurt Steve.
”Listen, Pete,” the man hushed, to which
Not seriously thought about it anyways.
He did not care.
And yeah, maybe it had. Because it was so painfully honest, it came from a place so deeply buried inside of him that he couldn’t believe he had actually written it.
This has been like 90% of all I have had pre - written, I only have like half of chapter 7, so it might take another hot second till the next update comes, but stick with me, I'll finish this.
“Cheers to that,” Rhodey mockingly raised his hand as if he was doing a toast with a glass, before he settled it back in Tony’s shin, “But it’s also great, mostly. Like when you can spend time with that person you feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside and — I don’t even know, man, it’s weird.”
. Not when he still had so much happiness left that it shone over all the other dark emotions inside of him. It would be a part of this big emotional ball inside his brain soon enough, only coming out when he was happy, but right now he had his time to feel light. Better not to overthink it.
Tony swore he could still hear the ringing of that ‘I Do’ in his head, giving him more comfort than it had any right to.
”I don’t know. I don’t know how to be your Dad.”
Tony wanted to shake his head just to piss Rogers off. See if he could get any other expression out of the man except for
“Why do you want to know all of the sudden?”
”Mirror above the bed, huh, kinky Tony. You like watching yourself lying on your back, getting fucked good and hard, begging for more ?”
”I’ll just assume you came here to discuss something more important than my room temperature?”
“Thank you for explaining it to me.”
y house, this is
after that, just that it didn’t get any better
The four years old scrunched up his nose and laid one finger on his temples, as if he was thinking hard before nodding seriously. ”Yes, you were.” Tony could feel something so heavy drop from his heart that he wondered if he had ever felt more relieved about anything in his life. ”But then you went away and Papa was really sad and then you were really mean and Papa said that this is not you talking, that you don’t mean it but he looks just even more sad when he says that.”
For the first time in forever, Tony didn’t know what to say. Because yeah, that was the truth. He himself was surprised that he was still alive, to be honest. But he didn't think that Clint cared so much, it’s
and Tony won’t ever have the chance to make him proud of him,
Tony didn’t answer him. If Steve wanted to live in denial then so be it, but Tony would never make the same mistake twice and believe what Steve was saying. So he just looked at him, trying to seem strong. As if he wasn’t a bit
”Yes!” The kid exclaimed, before pushing himself up to sit next to Tony on the couch, rolling his red car around on it, seemingly elsewhere with his head, making soft car sounds.
But last night he had seen her. He had seen Natasha and had heard what
Sam looked at him more honest than he’s ever been before he picked up his bag from the floor and walked together with Clint - who gave Tony another nod and pat on the back - and Barnes to their rooms.
Later when they lay together in bed, though, Steve looked thoughtful at Tony. Like he had something going through his head from which he knew it was wrong to think about and that is when it hit Tony, too.
as if he couldn’t hear her. But he didn’t know what she meant by that anyway.
It was just like a flash, really. It was gone as fast as it came to him, but it was connected to so many emotions that he could barely make them all out. He was so overwhelmed that he dropped his fork, causing Steve to raise his head questionably at him.
”It’s been 2 weeks and you still haven’t really asked me anything about our lives, or marriage, or our child. I just — I think it would help you to know things about us?”
. His hands lying in his own lap. Frown right in place; as was his sadness shadow. Tony thought about if this sadness was his fault or if Rogers was just one of those people who have already seen too much on this earth as to ever lose this sadness again. If it had always followed him around like a nasty rain cloud.
”Yeah, just like a bracelet can, congrats Agent, I’ll put it on your resumé.”
He had actual hope that he could be all right again, that they could recover from this for the first time since he had woken up in the hospital.
”You did, actually. You were the one who asked me to marry you.”
I hope you also liked this chapter - I tried to make it less angsty but instead Dad!Tony fluff - I hope you enjoyed it
Tony smiled involuntary, not knowing how to justify that and didn’t know if he needed to either.
I would love to read your comments. :-)'
He was convinced that he did just have a one night stand gone rough till like 10 minutes ago and now Rhodey was here and looked devastated but not as much as the blonde stranger, who was actively trying to get his breathing under control, while his eyes did this weird shiny thing, as if he was about to cry.
His last sentence came in a broken whisper over his lips, knowing that Steve’s answer to it could very well break the last piece of him that hadn’t been broken already, “What does this sound like to you?”
”You talked a lot about how bad a father your father was. Never around, always letting you down. You never wanted to be like him. I know you still don’t want that even though you can’t remember being a father yourself. Well, this is your chance of showing that you’re better than him.”
Yeah, he knew the drill. People just didn’t trust him. Not without or with emotions, he just
wrecked
”That’s great!” Steve exclaimed, nodding. ”It was a bit of a train-wreck of a first meeting, but I’m glad about it every day.”
Tony had aimed for a mockingly annoyed tone but he ended up sounding way more content and fond. Hell, this happiness thing really got to him.
He looked back on his way out of the living room, taking the sight of a broken man with him.
He stopped eating meat, he couldn’t recall when. First it was completely unconscious till he thought for reasons why, he didn’t want to explain it to himself with '
He couldn’t even remember anything really. A second he was in the battlefield, taking out an army of robots and in the next he was in the medical wing of the tower, two weeks later with a big blank spot in his memories.
So he stayed exactly where he was, tightening his arms around the kid, who cuddled back against him, while reading together with Steve.
sadness or resignation.
Tony didn’t know how he even got this thought, but his next notion might be his worst one yet. Still, though, he didn’t have a better idea either. He needed to live here and to make that possible he needed Rogers to stop being miserable around him and start to show other emotions. Do
this Rogers character could
Then he stopped for a second, though.
It felt like it already did, though.
Tony didn’t even bother to turn around, he just wanted to be left alone, but if Rhodes needed to trash a few things, then by all means.
”Please don’t make me see it,” he said, his voice weirdly thin, so much so that Tony doubted the words even belonged to Steve. He normally said everything so powerful, so determined that this whole sentence seemed like it hadn’t been said by him.
Yeah, this really shouldn’t make him feel warm, it was a dick move.
Of course it was what Steve thought. It was what everybody thought. He hadn’t gotten his Playboy title from nowhere. And yet, here he was, insulted by somebody assuming that he’d go out and have sex.
Steve had the audacity to
”No, no, it’s a great idea, Tony,” Steve said, eyes bright blue and shining with so much honesty that Tony felt like it’d burn him alive.
He was so not okay, but Bruce didn’t need to know that.
Tony cocked his head and looked at Steve, who had lost his nostalgia and looked somewhat playful.
They sat in comfortable silence for a bit longer, till Steve’s expression turned serious again. ”So, you can remember more?”
nodded seriously and then pulled on the man’s arm to get closer to Tony. His
They felt bad about what happened, or they just felt bad for him, he didn’t know, he didn’t
Hey !! Remember me?
“Could you?” Steve asked, looking not worried about being tactless or offending Tony. He seemed generally interested with a hint of challenge.
For the whole week that followed he had no flashbacks or memory pieces coming to his mind. It was frustrating.
It’d been 10 days, 6 apples, 2 fruit bars and one piece of bread -which took him what felt like hours to eat- since he talked to Sam, who seemed to have forgotten that he ever realized something was up, and never brought it up again. Tony let himself relax again, it was fine, nobody knew anything.
Steve looked Tony up and down, obviously not believing him one bit and considering whether or not to let it go. For a second he looked as if he would say something but then he settled for his disappointed/worried look and turned back to put the eggs on five plates.
. As if he just did something amazing and deserved pride for it.
38. He was 38 years old now.
”Liar,” Bucky mumbled before settling the boy on his hip and then turning back to Rogers. ”He needs to go home and sleep, Stevie, it’s been an exciting day for him, he needs a break.”
”You could’ve thought that we had taught him enough times to not climb on things, especially furniture and people,” the guy laughed deeply and then just stared at Tony as if he was something
His father had told him that more times than he cared to count, but right now he felt like he could downright laugh at that. Seems like Steve believed that, too. Tony used to think so. More in a not caring - okay whatever way, but those words had been burned inside his head from day one, as if it was the only thing that was certain in this universe.
The last part of his statement was nothing more than a whisper when his voice finally gave up and left him just staring at Steve. Waiting for him to explain something that could very well break Tony.
wasn’t Tony just sick of people trying to defend Steve; not one of them even
When they got to his office he sat down in his chair by the desk, while Steve looked around wide eyed for second, before he seemed to remember where he was and began to scratch the back of his head.
Rogers ruffled the boys hair, who looked rather upset. ”It’s alright, Petey.”
He didn’t want to talk to Steve about this — or anything really. How could Steve even stand there and act as if Tony owed him an answer. Tony could be completely fine or on the edge of crying and neither would be Steve’s problem. He didn’t care how Tony felt back then, so why now? Now that Bucky was safe, Tony’s feelings were worth worrying over again?
Steve raised his head again meeting his eyes.
had been this defenseless in his life. And they
Steve nodded, getting what he meant. Hopefully.
He knocked two times, till he heard a, “This better be important, jerk.” Which he took as a 'welcome in'.

Peter to put his Pj’s on later
”When I walked trough the door, you were in the kitchen in an actual apron. You looked so startled and you were asking what I was doing at home so early, sounding so spooked. I swear, for a second I wondered if you were hiding a lover somewhere because you looked so startled in the direction of the coffee table, as if you were hiding somebody underneath.”
Don’t get him wrong, he knew how dangerous this addiction could be, so he never got completely wasted like in the old times. Just a drink here and there to forget that he, yet again, had trusted a person who just betrayed him in the end, no big deal. Okay, he got wasted
He sat at his desk for another two hours after Steve had left, overthinking their conversation, trying to find his mistake. He didn’t.
It was as if this was the first time he ever even saw the kid right.
He just couldn’t prove it. But Steve had believed him all this time, couldn’t he have trust in Tony one more time? Just this once Tony wished that he had been faster to find proof that the world had declared as
Tony felt his own mouth pulling into a little smile, just from seeing that happy kid.
Steve sounded genuinely honest but he also told Tony that he’d never leave him with the same kind of honesty, so he couldn’t really tell if this was a lie or not. Then again he didn’t really give a damn about it either; everything around him was kind of numb now anyway and there was this constant heavy feeling on his tongue as if he could painfully feel every thought he never dared to utter out loud.
He knew the rules here. Whatever somebody did while not being in control of him or herself was not his or her fault. This had sounded really reasonable to him, but now it didn’t. Not really anyway.
”I have no idea what you are talking about. Like I said, I am busy.”
He spend hours working, putting sugar in his coffee was long forgotten and he didn’t even bother checking the fridge for something to eat. First off, he wasn’t really hungry anyway. This whole thinking about Steve and their conversation and the teasing from Sam that had hit just a
”I’m sorry,” he said again.
“I don’t know. Anything, really. What do emotions feel like?”
left the house even once since he had been
He had something to prove.
The word felt only heavy on his tongue, as if it didn’t belong there. But maybe it did. Maybe he’d have a chance to do right, just now.
Tony huffed and turned to face Rogers fully. ”I fucked your sister?”
”I didn’t ask for a husband or son either, but here we are,” Tony said smugly, looking closely to see if something in Rogers sad expression slipped. He stayed flawlessly, not even flinching around the eyes or anything. Tony blew out some air.
Rogers closed his eyes shortly, obviously keeping himself from reacting to this whole thing in a poor manner. Tony nearly cursed, why was this man so good at controlling himself? He had struck Tony as someone who rather acted than watched. Somebody who was ready to fight, for whatever reason. But here he was, raising one eyebrow at Tony as if he had just proposed the most ridiculous thing. And frankly, yeah, he might have.
”Oh, you have humor now,” Tony deadpanned as an answer and then threw a grin his way to show him that he was kidding. He was still surprised, though.
He didn’t know if he liked that it wasn’t a lie.
“Yeah, you’re a genius. Noted.” He just nodded and went back to looking at Tony with one raised eyebrow.
Rogers turned his chair slightly, leaning closer to his son, searching
He saw 7 more therapists in total, till the last one told them, that they should go see a doctor or a priest with him, because he has never seen a kid never reacting. Not to pictures of baby kittens and dragons. He wasn’t disgusted by broccoli, even though he didn’t like the taste of it and apparently was it not normal to simply shrug to every mention of his parents being upset.
