without wings and a stream of... exhaust?  That seemed like the word, though Steve couldn't be sure with the metal around Tony.  The exhaust followed him like a grey puff from the ground.  "So you

heads.  He'd been standing on one of them when he landed, which was why the ground was moving.  In the crystal's light, he could see that the one he'd been standing on was chewing on a form that had blue wings and a tail that was hanging out of its mouth.
"But the fact that I like
He picked up the tray and placed a hand on Tony's shoulder, squeezing it gently.
There was something in Tony's expression that caught Steve off guard, a desolate set to Tony's shoulders that made Steve remember he knew how to cut pretty deeply as well.  It was enough to break through his own fury.  "Damn it, Shellhead, that's not-"
They were the new Avengers, after all.  Home had never been so welcoming.
"Not me-me," Steve clarified. "It was Captain America everyone thought of from the propaganda."
Taken aback, Steve's eyes widened.  Then anger took over.  "He doesn't make weapons anymore," he said.  Tony had a panic attack over the robots having some of his circuitry.  He'd been genuinely upset people were getting hurt because of that, not just Rhodes.
"Let me at least set the bone," Tony said, calculating how long it would take for Steve's healing factor to kick in.  He didn't know how long he'd been out, but the last thing they needed was for the bone to heal wrong.
Tony was far from passive in the kiss, however, even if Steve enforced the pace, and Steve soon found himself stifling a moan because wow, he didn't know a kiss could feel this good.  Tony's
"Oh," Steve said, a little startled.  "Could you at least tell me about the metal in your chest?  Does it hurt?"
Steve briefly wondered how this had become his life.  Seeing Tony hesitantly return Natasha's smile was worth it though.  Except then she grabbed Tony's wrist and tugged hard until Tony practically tumbled on top of her.  Steve immediately stepped forward to make sure Natasha didn't hurt her leg further, but he should have known she'd take that into account.
"I've only remembered I was a dragon for a week.  You're the one without the memories.  The magic made me a human a lot longer than one week, Tony.  And I've been attracted to you since before that, even if you don't remember our first meeting in this world."
"You are better company than you give yourself credit for," Thor said, ruffling Steve's hair.  Then he sobered.  "I do not wish to see you hurt again, however."
"You needed to know if there was anything time-sensitive," Tony said, dismissing the apology as he went back to the game.  His movements were too stiff to be casual no matter how hard he tried.
"Tony..."
"I'm tired as well," Steve said, and if he wasn't going to call Tony on his bluff, then Tony wasn't going to say a word either.  Steve stretched, then walked over to the dais, wing up in an open invitation.
He took several breaths, his eyes adjusting to the light.  Because while it was dark, there were also faint lights and flickering machines that chased away the deep darkness of earlier.  There was a new kind of pain that crept up on him, one that was worse than his throat, left leg, the throbbing of his head, or the sharp sting any time he tried to take a deep breath.
"Tony..."
Thor had nothing but sympathy in his eyes when he spoke.  "My friend, we've all seen how you look after our Iron shieldbrother.  It doesn't take a spy to see that you have been troubled as of late."
Best not to think about Tony, especially not when he'd definitely back Rhodey on anything.
Tony was right.  People listened to fear.  Leon still wasn't sure what to think of these AI versions of their ancestors, but Susan trusted them.  Even Kes trusted them as she would JARVIS or FRIDAY, but they unnerved Leon more than he wanted to admit.
"No," Steve said, though he wasn't sure how to explain to Iron Man that it really was about his boss.  "I..."
"I will contact Darcy Lewis.  She may know where Jane is," Thor replied.
convenience, he supposed.  Tony snorted, then climbed over Steve's neck and settled between the spikes, because the need was getting rather pressing.
Steve came over, but Tony flinched away from him.  "Tony-"
darkness, plus a lot of pain and a dash of nausea on the side.  He twisted, trying to break free from whatever was holding him as his panic started to consume him.
Tony winced.  "You weren't supposed to see that."
A dragon crystal was near by.  It was glowing faintly, but no where near the bright glow that meant it was fully charged.  The skull marched him right up to it.
Steve watched the airmen going through their exercises in the gym, wishing he had better news.  "His injuries are healing," Steve said.  "But he still hasn't woken up yet.  The doctor is hopeful though."
"Tell me, Captain.  Any of those bullies you so famously fought all across Brooklyn," Stark said, leaning forward with sharp eyes that seemed like they wanted to cut through Steve with their bitter, jagged edges.  "Did any of them stop being bullies?  Or did they move on to easier pickings?"
"That's great, Tony," he said when he was sure his voice was free of longing.  "I'm glad."
No, he wasn't.  But when he didn't have someone in his head looking through his thoughts, he didn't have to admit it.  "What do you want?" he asked curtly, eyes scanning over the document.
Steve let the anger go.  It wouldn't do either of them any good right now.  He nodded to Tony, then stood.
Phones in this century were sure swell, being able to do all that within a minute.  Unfortunately, under a minute meant he still had more time to wait.
Steve glared as he drew in another breath.  "I-I'm not -  I am not in love with Tony.  What made you think that?"
"I don't know if I have an answer for you," Iron Man admitted.  "I... I'll be here if you need me, but Mr. Stark needs me too.  He..."  Iron Man looked down, the ground apparently worth analyzing.
Steve sat up, breathing heavily as he clutched at the sheets.  He swallowed down bile.  Out of all his nightmares, he hated that one the most.  Dreams of the ice left him trembling.  Dreams of Bucky's fall had him waking up in tears.  But this dream left him with nausea and sickness that had him leaving a trash can by his bed just in case he couldn't hold it down.  He swallowed again, closing his watering eyes.
"Come on," Peggy said, landing next to them.  "We don't have time for dilly-dallying."
"It's hard to think of living anyway else," Steve replied, a claw running through Tony's hair.  It felt nicer than Tony would have thought and Steve was very careful of his claws.  "Is this how humans hurt each other so much, like in your memories of the War?"
Then Tony was left alone with Steve, and the awkward factor increased by at least 300%.  That was actually low-balling it.  But at least this time he had a tablet to focus on, something to do with his hands.
"I required knowledge of the Avengers abilities before attacking directly," the man said, confirming Steve's suspicion that they were being drawn out for a reason before.  "Then I learned how to drive all of you apart."
"Does everyone know about that?" Steve asked, a blush working its way down to his neck. He'd thought the internet was more anonymous.
But the small, traitorous voice in his mind said that Steve used to be able to stand in the same room as him without
Tony was surprised to wake up.  He was even more surprised to be warm. Sadly, there was no third surprise about being pain-free.  What he wouldn't give for some aspirin.  His arm and leg hurt like the dickens, though he did feel a little less bruised.
"Then don't," Steve said, making up his mind.  "If you fail, I'll go through."
He tried not to fidget in his comfortable chair as he glanced down at his watch.  He was early, but he didn't know when to expect Stark.  Natasha told him he could reliably get to important meetings on time if someone was reminding him, but he might not be as keen to meet with Steve.
"And I really do have a meeting with Monica," Tony amended with a sigh.
"Didn't mean it was a hardship to think about
?" Rhodey asked angrily.
"I can do normal cuddles," Steve said, already going through a couple of poses mentally.
"Thanks," Steve replied, pushing aside the embarrassment and feeling of weakness that came from any time Steve sought out Iron Man's comfort.  It still raised his hackles sometimes, but Iron Man...
"Hey!" Tony said, grabbing Steve's biceps in a slight panic.  "Put me down!  This isn't - that's not dignified.  Cool the dance moves, Patrick Swayze.  Damn it, Rogers, put me down!"
"You didn't have to agree with me," Steve replied, but there was no accusation in his tone.  It was broken and small, and it made Tony ache to pull Steve against him and hold him close until Steve sounded happy again.  He didn't though; he stared at his empty hands instead. Had Steve needed a reason to stay?  Tony had probably jumped to conclusions if Steve had been asking.  He had been pretty angry at the time.
"Found you by the tracker Thor's carrying.  JARVIS is okay.  He fought off the Hydra attack then called me.  Romanov, Barton, and I will take care of it.  The pilots from your flight are safe.  They made it to a small cabin and shacked up there.  Pepper and Happy are safe, just worried sick about you, and Cap here will be fine with a bit of rest.  Now we're going to get you and Cap out of here, okay?"
"Can't help the metal," Tony said.  "It's supposed to protect me.  Remember the gun that I shot Steve with?  The armor stops those."
Natasha just hummed a soft agreement.  Steve felt like he was intruding on a private moment, but he couldn't bring himself to leave either.
"This is where the mural rests," Wanda said.  She walked ahead of him, her tail swishing behind her.
"It didn't seem that out of the ordinary to me, other than the fact they couldn't find out who Iron Man was," Steve said.
"It's your voice," Steve said, knowing it wouldn't
Tony felt a painful gasp work its way through his lungs and he closed his eyes, trying to hide what little he could by burying his face against Steve's neck.  "But you..." Tony said, his voice muffled enough to hide how broken he felt.  "You never wanted me.  You never..."
," she replied.
"Sure thing," Tony promised, stumbling over the words.  "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing after all.  Or so I'm reliably told."
"Of course!  Then I will take you for
At first, nothing happened.  It was just a picture of the wall as it had been, unmoving and uninteresting.  But a few seconds later, Doctor Doom blew a hole through the wall, his jet packs powering off as he stepped through it and walked down the hall, cape flowing dramatically behind him.
"They're beautiful," Tony insisted.  "Do you sell those?"
"Leave it, Rhodey.  It's fine."  Stark's voice sounded tired and defeated, like the only option was to accept the judgement that had already been passed.
"Is there a problem with Stark?" Steve asked, settling into his normal chair.  It was strange, not having the others around him.  Iron Man's seat to his left felt particularly empty.  He still had to apologize for how he'd acted...
"Happiness is a butterfly, which when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
Closing his eyes, Steve let out a breath as he tried to calm his beating heart.  He pushed his palm into his eye, then laughed as he rubbed.  "Hell of a way to wake up," Steve said, slumping onto a stool.
"I regret to inform you, sir, that the Damocles weapons and on board systems are directly under my control," JARVIS said through a speaker on the chair.
"Thanks, Thor," Steve said as he handed over the drawing.  "Keep it away from any cameras."
"Sometimes," Tony said.  He thought about the airship and the few times where Jarvis had opened up a good scotch to celebrate.  Of Pepper and Rhodey and the warmth of their smiles.  "But not with everyone.  Somethings are just for certain people."
"What if I can't do that anymore?" Leon asked, his voice breaking.
Steve looked around for some sort of peace offering - Tony tended to be mollified by food, which was why Steve chose a restaurant for the meeting, and Steve was willing to spare a few of his fries as an olive branch - but saw something better.
"Cap-"
"I survive," Viper said, a hint of steel in her voice that Tony hadn't heard before.  "It is what I'm good at."
Susan looked down.  She'd asked for Tony to find anything he could on Kor'la'vin.  Still nothing probably meant...
"Not sleepin' tonight," Steve said, mentally planning ways to increase alcohol tolerance before he ever went near Tony's stash again.  And without getting
Steve listened to the chatter as he stole a piece of cheese to nibble on while working.  He had a half-baked plan forming, and he set aside a portion of the sandwiches from the rest.  When the others were preparing to eat, he put that portion on a tray with some juice and a couple of apples.  "I'll take this down to Mr. Stark," he said, earning him a few raised eyebrows.
"On it," Natasha said, her voice clear and distinct in his ear piece.  Steve loved technology.  "Okay, I've cleared out some of your way to the western wall with a computer blip.  Not big enough to have extra security, but enough to get rid of some of your-"
Steve pressed his hand over his face in what Clint always called a 'facepalm' as Carol stole the drawing from him.  "This looks amazing, Jan," she said.  "I want one too!"
He was so caught up in preparing for what to say that he almost missed Tony's small "Okay."
Steve wanted to say yes.  That of course they would have.  But if Steve hadn't overheard Rhodey and Tony talking and been determined to stick with Tony because of that, would they have really?  Or would Tony just have been the odd, insensitive and slightly reprehensible man who gave money and equipment to the Avengers?  Steve definitely would have preferred having Iron Man around than being polite to the rich son of a dead friend.  It had been his own feelings that morning that had driven Steve's promise, thinking of how Iron Man always listened but never defended the man who made the suit.  The one who'd been in it all along. Steve swallowed, his stomach clenching into knots. This whole situation was a mess.
"What are you doing?" Viper asked.
"The robots we fought this morning were the same ones that attacked him," Steve said, fully grasping why Tony had worked himself up this much.
Tony hadn't been good enough.  The suit hadn't been good enough.  He balled his fists and stood there as the helmet judged him, then he took the helmet off the rig.  He turned it in his hands, the blank eyes not giving him any relief.
Then again, Tony had never been too fond of sleeping on the ground.  "Actually," he said with a faux yawn.  "I'm feeling a bit more tired than I thought.  Now that you're here, we could... though I don't want to keep you, going to bed early if you've already got plans."
Kes was avoiding her.  Susan wasn't sure why, but she was.  Tony said to give her some time, but...
"First, Howard Stark is a sore topic.  Do not bring him up unless Tony does first, and then steer the conversation away as fast as you can because that's probably Tony spoiling for a fight."
"About a hundred in this clan.  I originally came from a much larger clan of three hundred," Peggy replied, bowing down so that Tony could dismount.  "You are curious."
Steve had been standing guard non-stop for the past few days.  There had been only once Tony looked out and didn't see the familiar blue bulk, but Peggy had been there, looking bemused as she shrugged off Steve's paranoia.
"You have," Pepper said with a frown.  "That's the folder you made to keep tabs on him while we were fighting different battles.  Rhodey and Jarvis didn't want to give it to you, but I thought... I hope it helps you get things straight."
"Focus on the heads.  Don't let it grow more!"
Tony flinched as if Steve's words had been a physical blow.  When he opened his eyes this time, they were dry.  They were also dull and lifeless in a way that sent chills down Steve's spine.  Tony had closed himself off in more ways than one.  "You should go help Thor," he said, making to stand.
"You can put me down now," Viper said.  "You should return soon if you wish to get back before dark."
There was a chaste kiss to Tony's lips before Steve leaned back and looked up at him with serious eyes.  "You don't have to tell me.  But you anchored me while we were in the cold, Tony.  If you hadn't been there, I'm not sure I'd have had the presence of mind to keep going like I did.  Thank you for that."
Tony looked up, curious.  "What?  Come on, spill it."
Tony ran a hand through his hair, then pulled off a piece of the muffin.  "I like working on cars," he replied finally.  "It's not complicated and it keeps my hands busy."
"Cobra," she said.  "Do you have the dragon captured?"
"I'd rather stay here," Steve said, tail keeping Tony in place.
"Come on, princess.  Girl talk.  I'll even let you paint my nails while we chat."
Dragons, Tony realized with a start, rarely dealt with open wounds for an extended period of time.  The leaf bandages might be more for pain relief than stemming the blood flow.  "If I don't, you'll bleed out.  Those leaves you guys use as bandages, do you see any near by?"
"Let me show you," she said.  The dragon bent down and touched a portion of the wall along the edge that was near the bottom.
"I'm fine, Susan.  Tony will like this better."
"That was why what?" Tony asked.
Steve thought back to his dreams of bullying Iron Man earlier that week.  Was what they'd been doing really any better, even if they weren't aware of it?  Especially considering the man was their host...
.  "Okay, maybe not fine-fine, but I've had worse.  I can fly, ya know."
"How did-"
"But don't get up to greet me," Tony said, fully coming into the room as he poked at his own wound.  "With your broken leg and all.  You could always get a peg leg.  Or is that against your ninja code?"
"It's about as good as it can be," he replied, feeling more open and vulnerable with his shirt open than he had when his mental walls were down.  "They didn't mess with it, at least.  Let's just get the gauntlet off me."
"Impossible," Kang said, struggling to stand with the electrical currents.  "You went to Afghanistan.   There's no way a relic like that armor could get into my technology!"
"Human names?" the dragon - Wanda - said, proving she was definitely female.  "How quaint."
"I'm fine."
"Not a-" Tony said, his hands balling into fists.  "You changed your
"So you what - take the emotional super-serum and quit?" Tony asked.  "That's not what I wanted, Steve."
And seeing her put herself back together allowed him to do the same.  "I think there's a saying about kettles, Ms. Potts," he said weakly, gesturing to the armor she hadn't gotten out of yet.
"She's here," Tony reminded her.
"One True Pairing," Steve said, a little smug now that he was more up to date than Sam. Never mind that he had just looked it up himself. Come to think of it though, he'd seen it before on some of his pictures of Wanda and Vision, and the one of Rhodey and Sam, so at least it wasn't just him and Tony.
"After the War ends," Tony said, interlocking their fingers.  "We can go out to the country and look at the stars properly.  I've got a few houses upstate.  No people to bother us or smog.  We can just... watch the stars."
Steve sighed.  "It wasn't a good time when you... brought it up last time."
"Be safe," Steve said, giving Sam a sloppy salute as he walked out.
Tony looked down at his hands then closed his eyes.  Steve was torn between anger at Tony's secrets and wanting to comfort him.  He focused on his hand, because that was at least a neutral thing to do.
"You don't have a suit," Leon told her, taking her hand.  He still seemed wary of Tony, but the gun was on the table.  Neither of the twins were close enough to his crystal to make a difference, so he called the suit to come.
He doubted sleep would help.  But as he settled back down, she took his hand and held it tight.  He wasn't alone, even if it felt like it.  "Was there... Did I have a crystal with me?" he asked.
Steve - bless him - actually ran to the control room as Tony activated the hideout's defenses, Leon close behind him despite how that had to hurt his leg.  Tony threw the camera window at them rather than explaining, helping Susan along with the armor as his fingers flew along the base's defense systems.
"I'm sorry," Steve said, thankfully before Tony managed to work himself up.
"Did he tell you that?"  Steve felt inexplicably hurt by the fact Tony would rather not see him, even after all of that.
"Tony, you-"
"And that staff was controlling everyone.  I just lucked out, cause I'm pretty sure Mr. Stark wasn't thinking about its resistance to alien technology when he built the suit," Iron Man said.  "It wasn't you, Steve.  It wasn't even that bad.  Don't beat yourself up over it."
"Don't... Don't, Steve," Iron Man said.
"He's okay.  So is Iron Man," Steve said.  "No one's hurt now."
"You okay, Cap?"  Tony asked.
"I thought Cap would be good for you," Rhodey said.
"I just... ah," Bruce faltered, losing his earlier confidence.
"You certainly challenge yourself, my friend," Thor said wryly.
?  No need to throw all the tea bags in the harbor.  Trust me, Fury can't shoot me out of the sky.  He can try, but he wouldn't succeed.  I can get us wherever we need to go."
"Yup," Iron Man replied.  "You can look now."
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said, attempting to hide a blush behind the coffee.  Susan watched as he started to pull away, a cross look flickering across his features when Cap held on.
"You've had to have noticed by now if you've been talking to him as much as Pepper says you have.  Tony might be a mess, but Iron Man isn't," Rhodey said.  "Iron Man is someone who doesn't have Tony's trust issues.  Someone who can be open and friendly.  Someone he can pretend to be.  And maybe that's really Tony underneath everything, but it's not how he can act the way he is now.  It's going to be a long time before he can act like that normally.  And what if you guys didn't stick with him that long?"
"More or less the same thing," Natasha replied.  "Seriously, Steve.  You're just going to meet Tony Stark.  Why are you so nervous?"
"Do you need the metal off to heal the arm?" Peggy asked Sam.
"I want..." Steve started, then took a deep breath.  "I'd like you to listen to what I have to say.  You don't have to.  You're within your right not to.  But... please.  Just listen?"
Steve was privately glad, if only because Iron Man deserved his privacy.  So did Tony Stark, he reminded himself.  He was a private American citizen.
"Should I follow him?" Steve asked, his brain finally finding words.
"You were hurt?" Tony asked, looking up at Steve sharply.  Or he tried to, but the motion made his head swim.
"A friend."
But Steve was planning something.  Tony didn't dare take his eyes off Viper to glance his way, but he was under the impression that Steve was just biding his time.  Now, of course, was apparently Steve's time to try to hide things from Tony, which lead Tony to believe that he probably wouldn't like whatever the plan was.  Sadly, Tony must be a good teacher, because it was working.  He couldn't tell what it was, and he couldn't afford to give Steve away.  He did press a little harder on the wound in warning, but Steve ignored him.
of those.  The lucky girl won't even know what hit her.  You don't have to get second hand tips from Natasha, buddy.  Seriously, it's all in the tongue."
"I have to see-" 'Iron Man' started to say.
He started to reach for the catches when Peggy caught his hand between her claws.  "Show me how.  I'll be careful."
"If you need to change to the Hulk to protect them, we'll be here as quickly as possible," Steve assured him.
"You can't hurt your own mama, can you?" Mama -
"Fine," Steve said, standing up and clipping the shield to his back.  Normally it was a graceful movement that was practically instinctive by this point, but now it felt jerky and ungainly.  His leg throbbed as he put weight on it, but he ignored that.  "Sorry.  Got lost in thought.  Where do they want us to start on clean-up?"
Tony refocused the camera to show an older woman with a headscarf dressed in black.  She was flanked by a dark-skinned man in his mid-twenties and a girl closer to the kid's ages with dark curly hair and glowing eyes.  The resistance.
"Oh," Tony said, emotion choking his voice.  "Steve when I...  I can't stay here forever.  You know that."
Steve returned the salute and smiled, wondering if his smile looked as fake as Tony's did.  "How is the Colonel doing?"
Honestly, he was the worst candidate to accompany a temperamental team mate, especially since the last time he tried give comfort to Steve it had failed spectacularly.  Thinking about that night would only get him in trouble though, so Tony pushed it aside.  Not knowing anything he could say that wouldn't make the situation worse, he re-focused on his own tablet and tried to ignore Steve.
* * *
Tony stared at Steve's hand around his wrist, but didn't pull away.  It was funny how Steve assumed Tony was the one always lashing out, but Tony hadn't said anything this time.  Steve was just as bad, spoiling for a fight the way he had been.  His face grew hot with shame.  "Why is it so important that you not fail?" Steve asked, trying a different angle.
"Anything for a lady," he replied, ducking around a low hanging branch and making sure his foot didn't catch on the raised root in front of him.
," Tony muttered, nipping lightly at Steve's collar in retaliation.
Steve's relief hit him like one of his cars hitting a brick wall at the highest speed.  Not one, but two tails wrapped around him to pull him out.  "I can walk," Tony said, but he allowed the dragons to fuss over him.  He could feel Sharon, but it was distant.  Steve, on the other hand, took no time to wrap himself around Tony mentally and physically.
"See? Humans aren't that different to heal," Sharon said.
The other Avengers had been very welcoming of Tony, even better than Steve had hoped.  But that didn't mean Tony was necessarily ready for this, and he could see how scared Tony was even though he tried to hide it.  "If you're not ready..."
"You would try," Wanda said, looking at him now.  "But it would not save us.  You are needed by your people.  You can still do good there."
He didn't post the picture. It felt too personal.
"She's got a head for math," the woman said fondly, her accent noticeable but not thick.  "You were right, Mr. Stark.  She got the best grade on her test in the whole class."
Three curious dragons were waiting when he finally made it to the gate.  Steve, of course, had seen it before.  Sam had too, but not seen how it could fly.  The curiosity ended up being so strong that it was an almost palatable taste in his mouth.
"Think of male names," Peggy said, her voice in his mind.  It was easy to hear over the wind, if he was really hearing at all.
Steve didn't look happy, but he let go of Tony's wrist.  Tony stood and moved off of Steve, regretting it immediately.  Steve had been warmer than the cold air.  He called the armor, but after a minute of waiting and still no response, he quickly got back under the parachute.
"Drink this," Rhodey said, holding a cup to Tony's lips but waiting on his agreement.  "It'll help you sleep."
"You're a sap," Tony said, but Steve definitely wasn't imagining the blush this time.  "Alright.  You'll get your date."
"So you're sulking in Stark's workshop
"I have a suspicion based on a lot of circumstantial evidence, some of which the public is not privy to," Fury said.  "It's an educated guess at best, if one I'm banking a lot on.  But Iron Man or Tony Stark knowing that I know?  The trouble that would cause isn't worth the certainty.  And they would find out.  Stark's case has already been too mishandled for more mistakes."
" Steve said, his normal cheekiness showing through his worry.
Steve was caught mid-swallow, and he ended up choking on the omelette.  As he coughed and sputtered, Rhodey pat his back.  "Yeah, that always works on Tony too," he said smugly, letting Steve know he'd been had.
"I went to him," Steve said, seeing Rhodey's point.  "He deserved better than we were treating him, even if he hasn't been easy to deal with.  It wasn't like he didn't overhear us discussing the gossip rags often enough and we never showed him we were worth taking the chance on."
But he wasn't alone.  He had Tony and the others, and as long as they were happy, Steve himself had a home.  That was enough to fill up the chasm even if Tony didn't love him back in the same way.  He still loved Steve as a friend.
"You've found Kes and Leo?" Susan asked, her eyes going wide.  "Where are they?"
Of course, Steve realized belatedly, there were those 'open relationships' he read about; but for some reason he couldn't quite name, he didn't see that for Stark.
That was
"He bonded with you," Sam said, tail curling around Tony's feet.  "Which means you're also something special.  We look after each other here, and that means you now, too."
The look of betrayal in Leon's eyes cut him, but that Tony was used to.  "Sorry, kiddo.  But the memory banks here are so
.  If I wanted something a step above edible in college, I had to make it to the kitchen before Tony," Rhodey said with a grin as Steve started to eat in earnest.  Putting his own plate down as he sat next to Steve, Rhodey started to pour a surprising amount of syrup on his waffles.  "Speaking of Tony..."
"You can," Steve said, though his voice broke on the words.  He wasn't entirely sure it was the truth, but he needed some sort of grounding.
"Don't worry," Peggy said.  "It's far enough behind your walls I only noticed it because I'm close. I can't sense the feeling itself, just the fact you are ashamed of it.  What is it?"
It really wasn't.  But that was neither here nor there.  "Come on," Steve said, pulling away enough to steer them towards the couch.  Sometime soon, Steve realized, they were going to have to have a conversation about boundaries, and that one was going to be hard for him since it wasn't in his nature to back down when a friend was hurting.  It was a hard pill to swallow, especially when it came to Tony.  They both could have avoided this if Steve had just let Tony work through this for a few hours, and then maybe put his foot down if Tony wouldn't let him back in.
Now wasn't the time to think about crashing and ice, however.  He had a robot invasion to stop and he had to do it without the rest of the Avengers for back up since Iron Man was AWOL.
"Captain Rogers," Stark said finally, his eyes narrowing as he turned back to Ms. Potts.  "Pep-"
The woman ran a hand through her short hair.  "He saved my brother," she said.  "And you guys save the world and the city enough times.  It's the least I could do."
Steve glanced back at the others.  Jan had been a little down recently, even though she tried to put on a cheerful act.  As long as Tony was just
"That's not true," Steve said.  "It's not necessary to isolate yourself just for that."
The door slid open and he took that for a 'permission granted.'  Steve entered.  It hadn't changed at all since the last time he'd been here.  Even the first aid kit was still left out, since Tony had probably rushed out after Steve in the Iron Man suit.  The two metal claws were off to the side, and they moved briefly before returning to their previous positions, like Steve wasn't worth getting up over.  The machine was over in the corner, and Steve's hand tightened around the sketchbook, but he didn't go near it and risk temptation.  Instead he looked for a place to sit.  There were a few rolly chairs at the desk, but Steve didn't move towards them or the small couch.
"Because you didn't act like it," Steve snapped.  "And neither did she."
"But you kept it."
Tony opened his mouth to ask, but Steve plowed on.  "She's British, you know?  Peggy's an agent with the SSR and I think she's got Fury scared of her."
"You're just saying that because dragons don't like metal," Tony said.  He had his helmet strapped to his waist, and he took it in his hands.  "I'm going to have to put this on, you know."
," he stressed, and Steve tightened the arm around his waist.  "You know the past couple of leads haven't panned out.  The Skrulls are laying a lot of traps for us.  This might be another one."
"Steve!" Tony called out, unable to move or help with his heart stuck in his throat.  He focused on Steve's name-feeling as much as he could, but it kept slipping through his mind.  "Steve!"
"You're welcome, I guess."
Steve stared after her, pulling Tony against him again as the man started to follow her.  "She needs warmer clothes," he said.  "Winter's going to start soon and it hits pretty hard here."
"Don't leave," Steve said, distressed.
He looked up at Tony's bitter laugh, only to see Tony had gone back to the machine.  "Tony?"
Well, he'd do something about it and soon.  Maybe tonight, if he could catch Tony before dinner.
She angled the phone to show a snoring Clint on what looked like a bunch of hay.  A farm of some sort?  Clint looked surprisingly at home on it.
"The sounds you make don't translate, though they are interesting to listen to.  We hear what you say from your mind," Steve explained.
"Kes?" Rhodey asked, hopeful.
Tony considered ways to create that effect.  Maybe a suit like his own?  But surely the dragons would have known if it was a suit.  Something small, perhaps?  A mask could do it, but it'd have to be an extraordinarily well constructed mask.  Or perhaps not, given how often humans ended up down here.
Mem: I'm not sorry.
He couldn't afford to lose more time.
"Hold on tight and try not to impale yourself," Peggy said.
Natasha and Clint left for Latveria three days before Tony came back.  Steve sparred with Thor and played chess with Bruce to pass time, looking over the endless streams of data about Tachyon particles in between.  He wasn't an expert on them yet, but he could give the average SHIELD agent a run for their money on making sense of the data, and Bruce explained a few of the more incomprehensible theories.
"I give," Sam said, and Steve rolled off him.  "Damn, I thought you were gonna let me win that one."
Susan's fingers tightened around her throat as the repulsor in her free hand powered up.  It only made Kor'la'vin laugh breathlessly.  "And what would Captain America think of you killing?  Heroes don't kill," Kor'la'vin continued.
Iron Man was kneeling beside him.  Steve realized the other gauntlet was under his knees, like Iron Man had been about to pick him up into a bridal carry.  The thought set his stomach fluttering.
Steve shrugged, still holding out his arm.  "It'd last a week before we were found out anyway.  I don't care what they say, Tony.  I want you, not them."
"A year ago," Tony replied.  "They forced it to heal wrong.  We don't have the facilities to fix it here, either."
.  Something was wrong.  Why couldn't he...
Tony groaned.  "Only if you stop with the baseball innuendos."
* * *
Instead, Susan slipped out of bed.  Tony or Cap were usually around the moment one of them woke up, and she wasn't surprised to see Tony in the kitchen, warming some milk for her.  She took a seat at the counter, swinging her feet as she took him in.  Tony was a little taller than her, but still shorter than Kes and Leo.  He was dressed casually in a t-shirt from a band she'd never heard of and blue jeans.  He didn't have shoes or socks on, which Susan would have thought would be freezing for anyone else, but how much computer programs felt that sort of thing was a debate for Kes, not for her.
"I'm not a dragon
Steve sighed, glad for Thor's friendly arm around him.  "Not like I chose it," he replied.
Tony placed his hands on Steve's cheeks, feeling a small thrill as Steve leaned into the warmth.  He kissed Steve's forehead.  "You're warm now.  No more planes for a while, huh, Winghead?"
Steve debated pushing it, but then let it slide.  It really didn't feel like jealousy.  He considered it as he put his notebook away and followed Iron Man back to his room, only half listening to the list of modifications and upgrades Iron Man was talking about.
Tony felt the fight drain out of him in the face of Steve's love, but the guilt remained.  Steve's arms tightened around him as Tony shook his head.  "I can't...  Steve, you're emotionally compromised right now.  You've only been human for a week."
It was over far too quickly though, Steve's expression closing off only seconds later.  Tony hadn't known about how Steve and Sharon had just called it quits, or about Steve dating Sharon at all.  He had known about the Winter Soldier baggage, but he'd been impatient.  He'd rushed in like always and ruined things once again.
"Iron Man?" Steve asked, his voice confused.  "Whatever he's telling you it's not true.  Just let him go and we'll deal with him."
Tony still hadn't pulled away, so Steve kept up his half-hearted dancing.  He rubbed Tony's back, relishing in the warmth of Tony's body against his.  Cold didn't physically bother him that much after the serum, but seventy years in ice made him think he was still cold a lot of the time.  It was nice, being this close to someone again.  It was a kind of warmth that Steve had been missing, and it amazed him that Tony was willing to give him this, even if only as a friend.
Steve raised his hand to Tony's face, ignoring the sick feeling he got when Tony flinched away and closed his eyes, preparing for a blow.  Steve didn't hit him.  He would never.  He cupped Tony's face in his hand, using his thumb to brush the water away as he took in the dark bags under Tony's eyes.  The weight of all of this was close to destroying him.
thrilled at this command, but he stayed put as he grumbled to Sam.  "Go.  Keep me updated."
Steve wasn't in his own bed.  He stilled completely upon realizing that, then relaxed as memories of last night filtered in.  Then he groaned, because even the serum didn't stop his neck from pinching after a night of sleeping on the couch.  It was still dark out, and Steve was debating finding a proper bed or just continuing to sleep when he realized he had a heavy weight on top of him.
"I'm sure you'll manage something with that genius brain of yours," Steve said, drawing a particularly low moan out of Tony.
They stayed like that long enough for Steve to lose track of time and for Tony to stop trembling.  It was nice in ways Steve was going to have to think about later, because he never asked for his love life to be made into such a mess when he was perfectly fine waiting.  But that could wait for another time.
"Sorry, kiddo.  You've just got an old hologram for backup," Tony said, cutting down a large group with his laser.
"You too?"
"The war in which you destroy the world," Kang said, turning to Iron Man.  "You have access to my ship's systems.  You will have the blood of the world on your hands!"
"You're the strategic genius.  You can make it work," Tony muttered, not caring how much space there was so long as Steve got there quickly.
"Dragons aren't much for privacy, are they?" Tony asked when he was finished.
"Iron Man is yours."
...and there was that too.  Tony
Tony cursed again, trying to maneuver into a place where he could find that plane he lost.  He found another one, if not the same, and he flew into its blind spot.  It was a terrific amount of G's to get there, but Tony resisted blacking out from the blood rushing to his head.  He shot out the engine of the plane and tried to focus back on the conversation without sounding breathless.  "Four.  And the underdog will triumph with a flash-bang ending."
things exactly, and it would embarrass the hell out of him, but it was better than nothing.
"Sue, he's
Steve growled, balling his hands into fists.  He needed to keep his temper, damn it.  "After all of this, that's all I am to you?"
"It wasn't that kind of clingy, Tony," Steve said, because Tony's insecurities popped up at the oddest times, and Tony didn't need to be retrospectively jealous.  He took Tony's face in his hands, kissing his forehead.  "It really wasn't.  But I... that was the second time I lost time, sweetheart.  I can't do that again."
"Shh, baby.  I've got you."
"Then turn your back," Tony said.  "You could still hear me get away.  You could probably hear me thinking about it if I tried."
"What was that about?" Steve asked, chuckling softly.
Abruptly, she turned to Peggy and Tony couldn't help but feel relieved.  There was something unnerving about Wanda, and the way she looked at him made his skin itch.  She had a presence about her that Tony could only describe as raw power.  She seemed kind though, even if a little nutty.
"Funny thing, future technology," Iron Man said.  "It's all based on technology from the past.  Your robots were based on both Stark and Doom tech and between the two of them, it offered me a way in.  Doom has been remarkably helpful considering he doesn't want you taking over either."
"Because that worked the last five times you tried it," Kestrel snapped.  "You're Skrulls, all of you.  Really, really weird ones, but still Skrulls."
At first, Steve didn't think he would.  Then he visibly braced himself and looked up at Steve.
Ms. Potts was silent on the other end of the line, and he didn't interrupt as she processed that.  When she spoke, there was a barely noticeable wobble to her voice.  "Thank you for the update, Captain.  Tony is usually good at charging his phone but... please let Tony know."
Iron Man had turned him down.  Would Tony really be that much different?
"I don't want it," Tony said, trying to tear Steve's claw away.  "Steve, don't!  I'd rather you stay longer."
"Steve, what are you-"
Tony immediately stripped the repulsor from his palm, hissing in pain as the disk started to melt.
"Thanks, guys," Steve said, looking down with a small, half-smile pushing at his lips.  "But I really don't need-"
The moss lamp reflected off the metal as he descended, and Tony noticed there was no rust down here.  He touched the side of the wall as he went down, wishing he could actually feel the metal to guess at its properties.  He kept a careful watch on the steps.  Be it booby traps or simply poor upkeep, Tony had learned the hard way that ancient stairs were not to be trusted.
They both started, looking up to see Rhodey with a tray and three cups of coffee.  Steve blushed, though if it was from shame at potentially over stressing a recovering Tony or embarrassment from being caught, Tony couldn't say.  He was looking forward to studying the difference in the future.
Suddenly he had an armful of Natasha, who was hugging him tightly.  "Would you dream this?" she asked, her breath soft against his ear as the illusion gave a half-hearted protest.
have a stabilizer to anchor him in time, so everything he's done in the past will still happen.  But the Tachyon particles would age him in a matter of seconds when he does tries to get whatever it is out, and I can't even begin to guess how to make a stabilizer for that.  That could take years."
"Good girl," Tony said.  The words would have made her bristle, but the pride in Tony's voice stopped her short.  She didn't deserve it, not after...
Shame replaced the disappointment.  "Tony," he said, the name sounding full and rounded.  It took Tony a moment to realize Steve had used both his given name and the dragon name-feeling at the same time.  "I'm sorry."
"What war?" Steve asked.
Tony snorted, but didn't come back with a clever retort.  Steve was grateful, because he wasn't sure if he could handle Tony telling him to back off right now.
, though Steve knew how dangerous that line of thought could be.  Right now he felt like a lost soul in a black-hearted town, and having someone just as broken beside him was a comfort he wouldn't forsake.
"You've worked with Stark before though, right?" Clint asked, closing his eyes as Bruce absently massaged his calves.  They were all pretty exhausted.
"No.  Then you couldn't read it for the hundredth time," Rhodey replied.
It was only a minute or so after the video ended before Tony jerked away, standing through sheer force of will and anger despite the fact Steve could see his legs shaking.  Steve scrambled to follow him, half afraid Tony was going to topple over.  Surprisingly enough,
"Best friends," Kes said, her voice stronger and she was smiling despite the tears.
* * *
Tony leaned into Steve for a moment, taking what little comfort he allowed himself.  "
Steve laughed.  Even as a computer-generated body, his husband was insatiable sometimes.  Sex was... interesting as an AI.  It wasn't an imperative like it had been when he'd had a real body, but it was still fun.  "Then I have a request," Steve said as Tony straddled him.
"This time I don't mind," Steve said, pulling Tony to his feet.  "Let's take the night off, you and me."
Rhodey totally would do both if it meant saving him, but Tony didn't call the bluff.  "Where's Pep?"
"Their choice," Steve said again, even though it stung.  "They knew going in what it'd be like."
Steve gave one more glance at the Colonel and a quick prayer before following after Tony.  There wasn't much more he could add.
He wasn't just asking about the current fight.  The question nearly broke Steve's heart.  "Because I wanted to know what I did, and I didn't know if you'd let me back in later if I left now," Steve said to buy himself more time to grapple with the other question.  "I guess I have a few issues with trust, too.  And you...  You're not the only one getting benefits out of this."
"Just remember, if she wants that scholarship, I want a minimum three year contract with SI.  I'm not letting that little monster go to one of my competitors."
"You say that like you thought I wouldn't take your memories of saying that regardless," Tony said.
Tony awkwardly brought his hands up, rubbing Steve's back.  This...  It wasn't what he wanted, not really.  But it was nice.  Steve still wanted to be  his friend.  One of his best friends if what Steve said was true, which was a fact that slightly shocked Tony.  Steve had never let Tony do anything for him, so Tony couldn't see how that ranked as best friend material, but he'd take it.
"You always complain when I'm 'sulking'.  Now you don't have to worry about that anymore.  The world never needed a moping Captain America."
Tony took a deep breath, listening to the sounds around him.  They were at the Tower, so it should be pretty quiet.  But there was a light tapping sound he couldn't account for, along with a keyboard clacking, now that he was listening for it.
"Yeah, I'm hurt.  But I'm safe now.  And if you let me go, I can get better."
"So you're the crazy kids who took out the Skrull army."
"He's not," Natasha replied.
joining them."
shared a bed with anyone in a long, long time; Tony was attracted to her and he hadn't even seen her yet.  Not that Tony wasn't attracted to most skirts (and a few trousers when it came down to it) with a healthy appreciation of all kinds of looks, but voices weren't generally a thing that did it for him.
It sucked, as Tony liked to say.  But if he was asking Tony to try and change to over-come his issues, then Steve had to learn to do the same and give Tony the space he needed to do that.  Because they were both making a mess of things now.
* * *
A cup of water was pushed into his hands and Steve spat out his first mouthful into the sink.  Then he gulped down the water carefully, finding himself a little grateful for Stark's hovering.  It was fair turnabout, he supposed, given how often he'd done the same for Stark.
"Then what do you want?"
"That's your folder on Steve," Pepper said.
"Okay," Tony said, pushing away from the table with a small smile on his face.
Steve's mouth opened, but he couldn't say anything.  There was too much in the way.  Anger, joy, relief, grief, and sorrow all battled to have the first word, but nerves kept him silent.
"Why?" Steve asked, a little baffled. His art had never really been that good. He'd never done a gallery, and most of the time the drawings were just a way to keep his hands busy or work through his emotions. He rarely ever showed them to his friends.
* * *
Bucky...  Not relevant at the moment.  Tony's words had rubbed salt into that wound, but he could dwell on that later.  "But
Four hours and Tony passed out, from weakness or exhaustion, it didn't matter.  He was beyond that, and it was a relief to go.
"Hurry up or I might decide you're too heavy half-way there."
how she said that, but he got the picture.  "I won't touch it," he promised duly.  "I just... want to sit for a little bit and think."
Steve swallowed.  The machine had looked nearly finished.  "You said it was a portal."
Sparring sounded amazing, actually.  "Yeah, let's." She finished her milk and hopped off the stool to put on the armor but froze when she saw who was in the doorway.  "Leo?"
The next day after his run, Steve grabbed the paper.  He only had to glance at the first headline before he was up and yelling, "JAN!"
"The damn bastard had us so worried that he better not die now or I will chase his sorry ass down to hell just to give him a piece of my mind!"
.  I need a bigger computer to play in."
Tony laughed, a bitter and broken sound.  "It doesn't matter what I make," he said, shuddering against Steve.  "Even if I'm not making weapons anymore, it still doesn't fucking
"The Red Skull's notes were very clear on how the dragons reacted to metal," Viper said.  "If you don't charge it, we will tear your dragon apart piece by piece until he dies, and you will follow soon after.  I can bring back the suit, even if you prove too unreasonable."
"That's what we could tell from the bits of the message we decoded before it was blocked," Jane replied.  "Tony said no one else was going to die because of him and after the message was recorded he was going in."
It was shorter than he remembered, but at least the suit didn't look any worse for wear.  Getting it on again was a pain in the ass, but doable.  He missed Jarvis lecturing him or Rhodey briefing him as it went on.  The new suit was lighter and smaller, much more advanced after he got the orichalcum, and looking up at the fallen rocks, Tony couldn't tell if that was a curse or a blessing in his plans to escape this place.  Making sure the orichalcum was secure, Tony set about creating a path.
"I don't want other girls, I want..." Kes said, breaking off.
"Tony knew it was coming," Steve said.  "He decoded a message from the future with the help from Doom that-"
"Or that I value privacy," Tony said, but he was honestly a little relieved.  At least they couldn't comb through his life.
"  It felt strange and took more concentration than Tony would have guessed.
"But...  I killed Kor'la'vin," Susan said, the empty ache coming back.  "Heroes aren't supposed to..."
Steve struggled to stand, bleeding onto the cold ground.  The dragon name-feeling - Silver, red, and black.  Radiating warmth like the pits of lava in the middle of the dragon house, comfort and protection of the forest.  The darkness of a crystal-less night, dancing, and salty wit.  It resonated in the cavern like a scream.
"But an easy love would suit you ill," Thor said, and Steve wondered if that weren't half his problem.  Even with Peggy there had been so many things that got in the way.  "Let us see if there is any way to keep your companion's attention, as I do not think Bruce will mind."
.  Definitely a misstep.  And Peggy laughed at him when he said he had two left feet.
it a secret admirer?  Are they sexting you?" Tony asked, brightening up considerably.
Steve's eyes widened as he saw Tony in the middle of the hanger, staring at what looked like the remains of the Iron Man armor.  His heart jumped to his throat.
"Cap nap's over, Winghead," the voice said, but now it was different.  A warm gauntlet slid behind his back.
"You will try," Wanda said.  There was a warmth in her voice that should have incensed Tony.  Instead it soothed him, and his fists unclenched.  "It's not your fault, regardless of if you can fix it, Tony Stark.  This is inevitable."
," Steve said.  "
"He should start to come around soon," Tony said, but his voice was tight and tense in a way Steve knew meant he was upset.  His hands tightened around the medkit reflexively.
"All hope is not lost," Wanda said.  "What seems like an end can be another beginning.  A sacrifice could change things for the better."
"It's different like this," Tony said, opening his eyes to get a better look. In a plane or in the suit, Tony was only exceeded by Rhodey as a pilot, but this was a level of its own.  He could feel the wind running past him and if there had been clouds, he'd have been able to touch them.  It was freeing in a way he hadn't felt since before the War.
He just hoped it wouldn't be a seventy year wait.
It just brought up a lot of bad memories, Tony surmised.  "You should get warm," he insisted.
"Will do," Steve said as he raced down to the garage to get his motorcycle.  He may have screwed the meeting up, but he wasn't going to let Stark be in danger while Iron Man was out for the count.
A date with Steve Rogers was more important.
"I assume you've realized Tony has trust issues," Rhodey said dryly.
Okay, maybe he hadn't been humming as tunelessly as he thought.  He hadn't even really connected the song to the melody in his head, since he'd slowed it down.  "Thor suggested it," Steve said, flustered but glad to hear Tony laugh in a way that wasn't laced with bitterness or anger.  "When Iron Man... when
"We're not leaving you!" Kes said, looking to Tony for assurance.
he lied," Fury replied.  "Phil was one of the best agents I've known, but he can't keep secrets from me.  I trusted his judgement, because Phil actually believed in protecting people.  And that was when Phil started to do his damnest to keep Tony Stark as far from SHIELD as he could."
in front of the Iron Man armor for no reason?"
"Then if what he's saying is true, I'll have to stand down," Steve said, even when every inch of him was screaming against it.  What would Steve Rogers be without the fight?  He didn't know.  He should have gone down with the last Great War, because this century had no place for him, not if he was going to destroy it.
Kes let out a sob, but then went still.  Susan rubbed her back, wondering what was wrong.  "Kes?"
"How do you do this?" Tony asked, shaking his head.  "Live your life knowing when you've hurt someone and feeling that?"
"And you can find your way back in that much snow?" Steve growled.
"My job is to protect the city," Steve said.  "Right now, you're part of that city.  I... don't know if I trust you just yet, but you don't feel like a bad human."
Tony stilled.  He was still dreaming.  He had to be.  Steve Rogers was dead.
"Intervention," Rhodey said more grimly, setting a plate of waffles in front of Steve.  The omelette was still hot too.  When Rhodey didn't say anything more, Steve figured he was waiting for him to try the food.
The armor wasn't up to his father's standards either.  Hydra had torn his armor apart at Castle Donar.  He'd been using the designs his father had made, but his additions never seemed like enough.  Tony had always been in his father's shadow.  Nothing he made ever did as well as the designs of his father's, and his father never let him forget that either.  Sometimes Tony wondered if that was the reason he chased after ancient artifacts, so as to be good at something his father never done.  It felt more like running away.
"Excuse you, it's worked so far.  Are you implying it doesn't?" Tony said, mock-offended.
"Would it be a bad thing for the others to know?" Steve asked.
"Alright," Sam said, startling Tony as he came closer.  "How's the human supposed to fly?"
"Oh, it's...  it's under the table," Steve said, bending down to pick it up.  He pulled it out, the one little stick still moving in its stubborn insistence, but obviously broken.
This time there was no hesitation.  The wall started to move, uncovering a row of Iron Man armors behind glass displays. Steve recognized a few of them, including the one he had fought along side of for the Battle of New York.  It had been restored to a better condition, no longer banged up and dented and now with a full paint job.  He walked over to it, fingers tracing along the words Mark VIII.
The ground shook again just as the last head was severed by Peggy.  "What's going on?" Tony asked, looking to Wanda for answers.
"They won't be hurt," Iron Man said.  "They shouldn't have been there in the first place.  Fury's right about international incidents.  Besides, Doom isn't the problem!"
"Shouldn't I wear a suit?" Steve asked, eying himself in the mirror as a very uncomfortable-looking Steve Rogers stared back.
Tony raised the wall again, hiding behind the mental construct and feeling too exposed.  He wasn't a nostalgic soldier.  There was no one waiting for him back home, and he had a heart full of problems to deal with if he managed to survive.
"Plausible deniability.  Said he caught a bug and was too sick for the night of that op, and that was the report given to him," Fury said.
acting as a voice of reason.  That made Steve feel a little better.  "This is all just to cheer Jan up?" he asked.
"Peggy?"
"Yeah," Iron Man said, staring at the wall.  The face plate always had a certain blankness to it, but something told Steve Iron Man wasn't really seeing anything at the moment.  This time Steve bumped their shoulders together, even though the odds were that Iron Man wouldn't feel it as he did.
The armor clanked loudly as she ran over to the bench he was chained to.  He didn't look up as she stood in front of him, taking in the sight of his black eye and split lip that stood out among the other bruises on his face.  She carefully ran a hand through his hair, biting her lip as Tony started to put up the results of the scans as they came in.  "Leo...  But where's Kes?"
Rhodey leaned back, shaking his head.  "Seriously, Cap?  You sulk for two weeks every time Tony has a business trip and misses your lunches together.  Not to mention your drawings you post."
Still he was very glad when Tony took his hand as they went to the small kitchen.
"No worries, Cap," Tony said, wishing he could see better, to see Steve's face one last time.  "You'll be found easy.  It doesn't stay cold here."
A lot of people liked the animal Avengers, and they requested the others a lot too. Steve had a lot of fun with some of the puns, and one or two odd pairings that he suspected came from Natasha, but could never prove due to them being anon messages. The more explicit she asked for, the tamer Steve twisted the prompt, which was fun in its own way, and a few of the others started sending him things with the intention of twisting them too. Still, he'd have preferred not to have ever known about the 'alpha/omega' trope. Thankfully, Steve had been catching up on sci-fi and other genres, so that was easy enough to get around.
"I never said that," Steve said in exasperation.  "Jane decoded a partial message and called me to say the portal would kill you.  And you knew that."
She was glad Kes was sleeping peacefully for once.  It was probably the first time since Kes had moved into her room that the other girl hadn't woken up screaming.  Kes was thinner than Susan remembered, and more battered, but still just as beautiful in a way Susan could never hope to compare to.  It was hard not to reach out and touch her friend, to reassure herself it wasn't just a dream, but Susan didn't want to risk waking her.
"Sir, Captain Rogers is requesting permission to enter the workshop."
Tony looked up.  He doubted that killed it and he didn't want to still be down here when it returned from licking its wounds.  He spotted the opening of the stairs and made for it, recognizing the brightly glowing dragon crystal where he'd had his showdown with Viper.
"Worse than you," Pepper replied.  "Wicked sense of humor too, but only if you paid attention.  For a man with looks like that, he certainly liked to be a wallflower.  Grumpiest man I've ever met in the morning though.  You liked to tease him about that, him being in the army and all."
"Steve?" Wanda asked.
It wasn't fair.  Steve blinked back a strange pin-needle feeling in his eyes.  It wasn't Tony's fault.  From the sound of it, Steve himself had probably done something reckless once he found out, if the only times that Steve ended up dead were the ones where he'd been told.  But Tony was blaming himself, not Steve.  Tony was dying because Steve hadn't fought well enough, because the serum hadn't been enough.  It was no different from Bucky, and the familiar feeling of helplessness welled up as he watched this future version of Tony Stark step up where Steve had failed.
?  It's cold."
Steve stared at Iron Man in shock, fury building up.  "You knew all along?  And you were willing to chance someone's
Tony wouldn't look, not at this.  Already he had gone too far, playing back every small touch and kiss.  "This isn't real.  You never loved me."
Chess, Steve found out, was a fantastic way to keep Tony's attention.  Especially with Thor making more sober suggestions to Tony and Bruce sometimes drunkenly moving Steve's piece for him.  He wasn't quite sure who won either of the two games they played, but he didn't think it mattered.
"And we can ask Mr. Parker if he could get some better pictures for news articles.  He seemed like a good kid who might want to help out," Steve continued.  "We can get people started talking.  Maybe it's too late for this movie, but if enough people speak out about it, then we can start a change.  It's a long road, but we won't give up on it."
The next quake was bigger than the others.  Tony stumbled back and Viper wiggled out of his grasp as rocks started to fall.  "Kill the beast!" she yelled into the HT.  "Hail Hy-"
In the next few days Steve saw very little of Tony and none of Iron Man.  The latter was disappointing but understandable, given the flurry of activity between the scientists of the group.  Turned out that Doom did want in, but only so far.  Steve wasn't surprised to find that Victor von Doom preferred to let them do the dirty work while he stayed out of it beyond lending some technical expertise.  He didn't like needing Doom, but from what Bruce had said, he'd been very helpful so far.
Steve helped him refuel the armor jets with something that wasn't petroleum.  Though it still smelled like petrol, the substance was greener; however, the dragons had done nothing to refine the substance, and it shouldn't work for the armor's jets.  Tony was extremely skeptical, but he humored Steve who was insisting it would work after the dragon did some sort of energy transference to it and what was left of the normal fuel, surprisingly enough the rockets ran like a charm.  Tony refused to ask, because the last thing he needed to think about was that his suit was running on
Natasha hummed.  "That's part of the reason I called.  We're going off the radar for a bit.  We're both tired from our escape attempts and there's somewhere Clint wants to go so we can both relax without worrying about who's watching us."
"I'll have someone posted to take you back to the city," Steve said, though Tony was under the impression Steve would be doing most of the watching himself.
The woman blushed, standing back.  "Just looking out for him.  Ya know, since his boss is so crappy."
"You are most definitely my little princess," Tony said with a ridiculous smirk.  "Little Bear had to go through at least five different castles to find you."
"If that's what you think, then we're done here, Cap."
"You're too late, Stark.  You can't save them," Viper said.
There was a line.  It was a line that made him ill to think about crossing, but... damn it, he hated this.  Iron Man had already betrayed them, but that still wasn't a good enough reason to commit what could be corporate espionage.  That didn't give him the right to betray
"I hate it when that happens," Tony said, frowning a moment.  His eyes went blank before a virtual cup of coffee appeared in front of him.
, he remembered, thinking back to one of the USO girls who had wanted to be as elegant as the French dancers.
"Well, look who's finally agreed to grace us with his presence," Jarvis said, though there was more worry than bite to his words.  "Can't you walk?"
"It's not," Iron Man said miserably.  But his arms tightened around Steve's back.  This close, Steve felt a pang of what he could have had.
* * *
"You gonna let go of my hand, Jack?" Tony groused, something in the name telling Steve it was a reference.
There was a heavy weight on his chest that would normally terrify him.  He hated any weight on the heart pump, but he felt safe right now despite it.  Protected.  It was a curious feeling, and if Tony was going to be painfully honest, curiosity was usually his undoing.
The library wasn't empty.  Iron Man was facing the wall, staring at a portrait of Howard.  At least, Steve thought he was staring at the picture.  It was hard to tell with the expressionless face plate hiding his eyes.  Steve didn't even know what color they were.
"We can't lose," Steve said stubbornly, though his tail trembled.  "We have to hold the line and we will.  You won't change my mind, Wanda."
"He'll get better," Cap said.  "He's got you and Kestrel to help him."
"You are very guarded for a human," the red dragon said.  "I can only read your surface thoughts, but nothing below them. One would think you're hiding something."
Steve considered the question. He mostly posted little doodles of the other Avengers or ordinary objects or scenery. He still preferred drawing by hand, but the tablet was very convenient so he found himself on it frequently. So time-wise, it wouldn't be too much of an issue. A request though... he'd seen some of the other artists do them, or they took commissions. As long as there weren't a lot of them, it shouldn't be too bad, right?
Steve frowned, putting his phone down.  "You've got some of your older suits, right?  You shouldn't-"
"You heard the woman, J," Tony said, squeezing Steve's hand.  "Pizza and a movie.  You know what to order."
"Never said I wanted easy," Steve replied.
He glanced up to see Steve's eyes closed as the other man took a deep breath to calm, whether to calm his anger or to fortify himself for what he was about to say, Tony couldn't tell.
"After my family died, I was so angry," Wanda said.  "And I did terrible things because of it.  And after Pietro..."
Tony yanked at the tentacle fruitlessly, fury overtaking him.  "Let him go!"
"Then what was the point of this?  Why come out here?" Steve demanded, lowering his voice at Fury's hushing motion.  "Sir," he added as a softer, but still angry, afterthought.
It had none of the bright paint and colors that the dragon buildings did, or even the colors and patterns Tony had come to expect from this side of the world.  It was all the same dark, strange metal, with a rust the color of dried blood that creeped up the walls.  "Pleasant place," Tony muttered, feeling Steve's unease as well as his own.
"Yess, Madame Hydra," came the reply.
She nodded and she stepped closer, noting that the eye he could see was, indeed, green.  A stunningly lovely shade like pure jade if Tony were to wax poetic, and attraction was one thing that Tony never felt the need to have denial for.  But there was a time and place, and the poor girl was scared and trapped with a strange man.  "Take the lantern and hold on tight, okay?" he said, scooping her up into his arms with relative ease.
, Steve.  That's not cool."
"You got it boss," he heard a man say, one that Steve was pretty sure he didn't know.  He rounded the corner to the Avengers common room to see Iron Man talking to a stocky blond man in a suit.  "I'll make sure nothing happens to him."
Viper looked at him, disdain in her eyes.  "You should be more worried about yourself.  You do not have what it takes to survive, Mr. Stark.  He's not worth the bullet," she said, turning to the naga for the last statement.  "Throw him in one of the pits.  The cold will do our job for us soon enough."
Finally, Tony felt arms wrap around his middle.  He was too tired to pull away, instead closing his eyes.  His breath hitched as he felt a tear roll down his cheek.  Fuck, he couldn't...
"Tony?" Steve asked.
"Tell him to be careful, but good.  We'll be here if he needs backup."  Steve passed another sandwich down to him and smiled reassuringly.  It made him happier than he wanted to think about that Tony accepted the suggestion, even if the thought of Iron Man doing it alone bothered him.  Still, going in with all the Avengers wouldn't look good in terms of making an alliance, and Tony and Iron Man were the best equipped to handle the science side of things.  "We'll figure it out, Tony.  I promise."
"And now I'll be able to call you," Steve said, his voice fond.  "No matter where you are up there, I can tell you how to find us again."
Steve nodded, wings relaxing.  "Are you going down to build a shelter now?" he asked.
"We won't," Steve repeated, and Tony felt himself relax without quite meaning to.  "Besides, kids are pretty tough.  We've already seen how resourceful Susan and Kestrel are, and I doubt Leon's far behind them.  And we'll be here if they need us."
"I'm saying you don't need to fight, if you need time," Cap said, returning to the seat next to him.  "Or if you want to put down the shield forever.  You can just be Leon, and you'd still have a place here."
Steve's shoulders slumped.  This was far more exhausting than it should be.  He hadn't even been to the gym yet today, and he felt like he hadn't slept in years.  They had to find a way to stop this cycle they got into before one of them snapped and this became something they both regretted.  Running this through his head so much would only run him to the ground.
Tony didn't know what was going on or why Steve had a sudden change of heart, but Steve never let Tony be extravagant for his sake.  He never let Tony spend any money on him, outside of the team.  Steve would accept gifts from everyone else, but from Tony it felt like he was always holding back a wince.
Steve looked at them both curiously.  "What are you doing?"
"You shouldn't want this," Tony said after a while.  "You deserve better than everything I've said to you."
"We're not nearly dying anymore," Steve said.
"Yeah," Steve said, giving Tony a small, lopsided grin before ducking his head.  "Ya gotta problem with that?"
Steve waited for the sounds of the elevator closing behind them before he sat up.  He chewed on the end of the eraser as he mulled over the words.  He needed to put a stop to Clint's prodding, that was for certain.  Maybe talk to Iron Man about telling them when they were crossing the line.
"You-"
"I'm making my super-villainess outfit for when I turn to crime!" Jan said cheerfully.  "Tony's helping."
He lay on his bed, breathing heavily as he tried not to think about how he was going to have to get up and change his sheets.  He was no stranger to that particular kind of dream, but this one had been more intense than usual.
about his attraction to Peggy, so it wasn't like this sort of thing usually snuck up on him.
Steve nodded, leaning a little closer so that their shoulders brushed, but Tony didn't even blink.  It worried him.  "How is he?"
going to come watch me make a fool of myself?" Tony asked, regretting turning Steve down that first time.  At least then it would have been private.
, but I wasn't.  I came home with black eyes and got another for it because I wasn't some steroid-buffed idiot."
"We got most of the civilians out.  There were a few left that insisted on going back for... meaningless things, but we couldn't move fast enough to stop them."  Steve's hand briefly tightened around Tony's.  Loss of life never sat well on Steve's shoulders, especially not when it was over something easily prevented.  Tony floundered, wanting to comfort Steve and not knowing how any more.
drunk.
"No problem. Don't let the team fall apart while I'm gone. I've grown attached to the crazy," Sam said.
kinds of circumstances."
"I take that back," Iron Man said, and Steve could hear anger and panic in the synthesized voice.  "It is Doom circuitry, according to Mr. Stark.  It's also
Tony watched Kestrel and Susan through the monitors as they worked, glad the two girls were talking again.  He had kept watch in case he needed to intervene with a quick excuse, but little Rhodey patched things up far better than anyone with 'Stark' in their name ever could.  He smiled as Kes teased his Little Bear about Leon.
Tony pressed into his arm and hissed in a breath, because this wouldn't work if he passed out before he finished.  Then he concentrated on his mental walls and started breaking them down.  He flung shame and guilt at them, because he had caused this.  He always caused problems by either thinking of his heart instead of other people or acting too recklessly.  This was worse than when he'd put Pepper in danger.  All of the dragons...
"The frequency to find Steve in the time vortex is through his shield," Tony continued.  "I've attached that and as much information on Kang as we could find.  The video of my fight and transcripts of the other fights are all there too, so have fun analyzing how we all screw up.  Mostly, this is all just to save time if you fail.  Give us less time to make things worse, like we always do.  I wish there was more advice I could give you, but every time line has been so different that it's hard to tell where-"
Steve grunted, staring at the bare kitchen.  Stark didn't put on a light, but even in the darkness it looked clean enough.  It usually always was, and Steve was continuously surprised by that no matter how many times he saw it.
"The last thing we need is to split up," Steve said, but even he could see it was a useless protest.  "Those robots are drawing us out.  It's a distraction."
"I hear you guys could use a hand," another very familiar mechanized voice said.
Probably a good thing though, Steve admitted quietly to himself.  The face Thor made before the god could hide his reaction suggested that Steve needed a bit more practice at cooking lasagna.
The free fall was everything Steve loved in life.  The adrenaline, the air rushing around him, and the open sky made Steve regret needing the chute, but there was no water down there and even
"No!" Steve said, uncurling from around Tony.  "I have to-"
Leon limped over to Kestrel, hugging her tightly as she dropped the gun.  Tony scanned the body for other traps but found nothing but a teleporter on her.  She was definitely dead this time, and after all she'd done to Steve and his ducklings, Tony was fiercely glad.
Steve looked down, taking his own advice and breathing.  "He wasn't breathing.  His arc reactor... the light was the same as the portal that opened, pitch black.  But they haven't told me anything since we got here."
"That's not cryptic at all," Tony grumbled.  He needed to think, to find ways to change what he saw.  The crystal was a lost cause and probably useless, despite the fact he was saddened for losing it, but if he could recognize the small dragon he could...
"Got it in one, Capsicle.  Now go back to the ice where they found you," Tony said, reaching up to flick away a hologram.  "No one needs a relic who only messes up the time line further."
Steve's tail uncurled and he turned around then, letting Tony do his business and wash up in a small stream nearby.  Tony could sense a bit of disappointment, especially since Peggy and Sharon had apparently been quite free with details of  his heart pump, but he ignored it.
"Yup," Susan said awkwardly, because Cap could easily check the camera logs to see.  He didn't though, making him one of the world's strangest computer programs.
Something must have shown on his face.  Steve didn't like to think about what, considering that Tony wheeled around 180 degrees.  "Or you could stay and, I dunno.  Cut the chicken?  They should be three to five centimeters.  If I see any that are two or six centimeters, you're fired.  But you can stay."
When Sharon finished looking him over, Tony carefully did a spin, using the walking stick to take the weight off his bad leg.  "Would you like to see the rest of me?" he said, waggling his eyebrows over his shoulder at her.
The alarm on his phone blared.  Steve jumped to his feet, his hands itching for the shield that was too many floors below him.
"Over here, Winghead."
He was definitely going to have to grill Peggy about their first meeting.  This was information that was obviously important for Tony to know.  "That doesn't mean you're not more impressionable right now," Tony said.  "Would you keep going if it were me?"
"You miss it?"
Allowing himself a moment of satisfaction at Kang's grunt of pain, Steve prepared for the next attack.  It was very short-lived, unfortunately.  No sooner had he regained his balance, Steve found himself caught in a green bubble.  He pounded at it with his shield, realizing he was now hovering in mid-air.  The bubble stayed strong, refusing to break or yield.
Steve pulled back, realizing he was crowding him.  He smiled at Tony's wide-eyed, flushed appearance.  He leaned back in to kiss Tony's nose when he couldn't help himself.  "There you are, Shellhead," Steve said softly, rubbing Tony's cheek.
"Steve," Tony replied.  "You can't go in there with me and you know it.  The metal wouldn't be good for you even if you could fit in the doors, and someone has to go in there or your home will be destroyed.  I've done this before.  I'll be fine."
"Do a lot of people want certain celebrities to get together?" Steve asked, feeling foolish. The USO girls had talked about the Hollywood rags, of course, and come to think of it, a few of them probably had the same level of devotion towards certain couples, but Steve honestly felt a little out of his depth on this one.
"Not an answer," Stark said.  "Where is it?"
But not clear enough to recognize they had reached Tony's bedroom and that Tony was pulling off his boots.  He lost a few moments and was surprised to find himself sitting on the bed.  He tried to help, but Tony just batted his hands away and Steve didn't want to chance fumbling more.  Tony didn't bother with the rest of Steve's clothes as he pushed Steve gently down onto his bed.  Steve couldn't help but feel disappointed.
"I respect your choice, Shellhead.  Doesn't mean it's not hard sometimes, but that's not your fault," Steve said, both to reassure Iron Man and remind himself.  "I did want to talk to you about the other day."
.  I haven't made weapons in over a year.  I practically privatized world peace.  I make efficient, renewable green energy at half the cost of fossil fuels.  And they still call me the Merchant of Death in the papers.  You think telling everyone would change that?  They already know enough.  They just don't care."
He heard a sigh, then felt Tony's hand on his cheek.  "I know, honey, but you've got to give me some space here.  Were you this clingy with Bucky when he came back?"
.  "The crystal was too damaged in the explosion."
Steve had his face in his hands, but not before Tony saw a hint of fond exasperation about his lips.  "You're impossible."
"Do humans not share emotions?" Steve asked.
"The nagas cannot take me to the surface.  But you can," Viper said, her voice calm and controlled despite her looks.
"How'd that work, by the way?  I thought no one could resist your interrogations," Steve said.
"Not much you can do when working on bad information," Steve said.
Tony laughed.  It was a small, hysterical little thing that sounded a bit too much like a sob, but it was genuine.  The sheer amount of stubborn rolling off Steve brooked no arguments, and Tony was too tired to even try.
The Red Skull.  Of course.  The devil-man in Steve's dream!  He had been one of the German leaders in the first Great War, though no one knew what had happened to him in the end.  How had he not seen that before?
Tony blinked.  "Sorry," he said again.  He hated apologies.  It wasn't that he was too prideful to make them, but he could never face what came after.  He was actually a little relieved that there had been no forgiveness.  He wasn't sure he could handle it.  "I think... it's time for me to sleep."
"Yes, sir."
The first tab was his Clint tag on Tumblr, followed by Natasha's and Thor's.  He had one for each of the Avengers set up, with Tony's in the far corner at the end.  He looked at Rhodey to see what he was supposed to make of this.
"Natasha, something's wrong," Bruce growled.  "The doctor needs-"
"I thought the measure of your dates was how badly you struck out," Natasha replied with a sweet smile.  "And you're gonna today."
Steve wisely said nothing when Tony stopped telling him all the reasons it wasn't possible.  It could all wait until after the War.  Then he could think about all the different kinds of energy.
"I..." Susan said, looking back at the door to the kitchen.
"Bucky?" Steve said once the words caught up to his ears. He looked around, but didn't see anyone with a metal arm, pink or otherwise.
"Mr. Stark is currently down in the workshop," JARVIS said, sounding both apprehensive and relieved.
He kissed the back of Tony's hand before he could second-guess his actions.  He closed his eyes as he did, not sure if he wanted to see Tony's reaction or not.
"That's all, Captain," Fury said as Steve started to leave.  "And good luck.  With Stark, you'll need it."
"Man, you don't know the half of it," Rhodey said.  "Thing is, he gets proven right more often than not and is significantly more prone to meeting and trusting the wrong people than anyone I've ever met.  It's caused him to come off as arrogant and self-assured just to protect himself."
"How did this...
Tony closed his eyes, picking through the possibilities.  They had already crashed and burned once.  The probability of it happening again was high.  It wasn't that they didn't get along, because they did fantastically.  Waking up in Steve's bed and being able to run his scarred fingers through those golden strands was the happiest Tony had been since the last time he was allowed to kiss his way down Pepper's neck.  He could have that again, even if just for a little while.  Did he want it?
"No," Iron Man said.  "He's not the easiest guy to get along with though.  You don't have to deal with him because of misplaced guilt or gratitude."
He watched the foliage carefully for any rustling.  Unfortunately, the strike came without warning from the water.  Viper screamed as Tony shot, the gun being knocked from his hand by a half-snake, half-man.  He was pushed to the ground, hands wrapped around his neck.
"No," Tony said, finding strength in the anger that coursed through his veins.  "No.  Wanda said there was still hope.  That means... I don't know.  I'm still doing something wrong, but I'll fix it.  I'm not letting that mural tell me my destiny!"
Landing was the worst part, but he didn't have to go through it today.  Once he was over the SHIELD warehouse in Maine where the robots were fighting, Steve grabbed a parachute.  "JARVIS, take over for me and take the jet back to the barn.  I'll catch a ride back later."
"Not the time to be getting fresh, Stark," Steve said, though he wasn't disapproving like Tony expected him to be.
"He still has no idea who you are," Kang said.
He fired again, but the shot went wide and the nearest tree was too far off for any proper cover.  The dragon was blocking the tree he'd gotten his walking stick from.  Clever bastard.  He only just managed to duck behind a rock as fire spewed from the dragon's mouth.
"Thank you," Steve replied, absently sorting through his schedule to see when he'd be free to visit the Tower.
"You're saying I need to flex muscles I never use?" Tony said with a pained chuckle.  "It's... Wait.  That's not even your fault, Steve!  Great, now he's sulking again."
"He woke up," Tony said, his voice wet as he laughed.
"Yes, but I'm officially allowed to be here," Pepper said, and he thought he could hear a smile in her voice.  "And I have his company to run and can't stay forever, but I can stay until you get back."
"Yeah, sorry.  I think the fact they discuss the gossip columns over breakfast and come to the conclusion it had to be true says otherwise," Stark shot back.
"He'll be okay," Pepper said before she left.  "He has to be."
"Yeah," Tony said, seeing only a long road in front of them.  He'd fought with the Japanese before.  Even if they won the war in Europe, the Pacific theater would be a hard won battle, if it could be won at all.
Tony's shoulders hunched over for a brief second, before he forcibly straightened them.  "I need to call Jeanette to-"  He looked down at his phone, remembering belatedly it needed power.
One of the caterers got in his way, however.  She was a small woman, but she had her hands on her hips and glared up at him in a way that was more than a little intimidating.  "Ma'am?"
.  There was nothing about Steve's face to give him away, but the hand furthest from Kor'la'vin was tapping.  It was a matter of microseconds to translate the Morse code.  S-T-A-L-L.
Steve felt self-conscious despite his words, because he really wasn't strapped for cash and most of his drawings were just to give his hands something to do.  But he'd seen enough posts about artists having to charge too low for prices, and he did want to drive that point home.  He accepted the fifty.  "I guess I can give a former superior officer a discount."
"I'm not sure," Tony said.  He took a step forward, then stumbled as the ground shook.  "Seems like the hydra is even grumpier than you when it wakes up."
"Most people make chicken soup when people are sick.  She's not sick," Steve said, though not unkindly.
"You're supposed to be War Machine, not some handicap," a very familiar voice said where Kor'la'vin was supposed to appear next.  The disappointment was exactly how Susan remembered it.  She'd heard it for so many years...
Which meant that Iron Man probably didn't have blue eyes.  Steve filed that away under the mental file he had on his best friend.  The personal details were extremely sparse, and he hoarded what little he could glean.
"The secret was important to him," she replied.
Finally, Fury handed him five dollars.  Steve tilted his head in question.  "For a commission," Fury explained.
," Steve said.  "You need to stay awake.  Please."
"Tony-"
He debated getting out of the suit to find Steve again, but it was more effort than he wanted to get out and in by himself, so he figured he'd wait until he was done for the day.  The helmet was easy enough to take off for eating.  He didn't waste the fuel in the jet packs to get out, opting instead to walk it.  At least this time Steve would hear him coming.
"Mr. Stark?  I was just cleaning up in the other room.  You texted?"
"Besides," Jan said as Tony sucked on his finger, "If they won't make a female superhero movie, I might as well just turn to crime.  I can steal from the Hollywood execs even!"
"Shh," Steve said again between kisses.  His voice broke as he spoke.  "I'm sorry too.  God,
to use it!" Tony snapped.  Steve could see fear behind the anger in Tony's eyes, though he didn't know if the fear was of dying or of failing.  Maybe both.
," Sam and Wanda said at the same time as Tony pulled him back down stubbornly.
"Ever try a tablet for drawing?" Tony asked.
He wanted to stay.
She eyed him critically then nodded.  "Go get 'em, tiger."
"I should have fought it harder," Steve said stubbornly.
"Go 'way."
He should have known that a fella like Iron Man would be out of his league.  Steve didn't even belong in this century, after all, and Iron Man was a man of the future.  It wasn't easy, like it'd been falling in love with Peggy.
Sometimes he hated the fact that Vision had instant access to all of the safety monitors in the gym and probably a few of his own.
though?" Rhodey asked.
"No, I mean about not raising the alarm.  Is Tony in danger?" He was honestly a little charmed by how protective Happy had been of Iron Man.  He was glad the man was Iron Man's friend.  The implications of what they'd been talking about before were a little worrying though.
Tony gave them both a hesitant smile that grew as Jane hugged him.  Clint passed Natasha a five dollar bill, and Thor pulled Tony and Jane into a big bear hug that was going in Steve's sketchbook as Tony's smile became blinding.
Steve was avenged.  Now he could return to the dream world and never come back.
"Sam?" he asked.
"His codes still work," Tony muttered as he wiped his hands on a dirty rag, looking over the engine he'd been working on.
"Am not," Tony said, looking down at his watch.  6:10, which was... maybe it was late?  He was also wearing dress slacks and a nice shirt, so he must have gotten ready before he got lost in the armor.
"That was the other day," Tony said, pulling back from Wanda.  "You bastard, you really
Steve felt out of his element.  The familiar way they spoke to each other didn't suggest lovers, but good friends.  But why would Stark deliberately let him assume that after he realized what Steve was thinking?  Why not just come out and correct him?  Steve felt guilty for assuming, but Stark had encouraged the response.
Steve immediately missed her presence, because the tension from earlier came back so quickly it was like it had never left.
"Is that all
"Thor will be with you after he's taken out the robots that just appeared," Jane said, her voice tight.
"  Steve's voice was dull and empty as he said it, none of the self-righteous anger from earlier present.  "
"Not really."  Tony was never the sort of person who could fall quickly in and out of love.  He was still half in love with Pepper, and he doubted that would ever change.
Panic coursed through Steve, and he grit his teeth.  Tony was a computer program.  He could reappear in other places faster, but damn it, Steve really hated it when he did that - even if a ping told him Tony was just in their supply closet.
Tony raised an eyebrow.  "Really?  After that you're just gonna play twenty questions?"
," Tony said as she slowly straightened back up, taking a moment to just breathe as the shock of hitting the wall faded.  "You have no injuries beyond some pretty spectacular bruises," Tony continued, his voice like a balm as she scanned for any more threats.  "And a very long lecture from Captain America about clever plans not including running into walls and scaring him half to a second death, but he's proud of you too.  That was definitely a plan worthy of the red and gold."
"Now, see, to tell you that, I'd have to start some of my processes up again," Tony said as Steve moved to his side.
"  Tony clung to the words, only half-believed.  He wasn't...
Natasha snorted, eating her soup and some how managing to let her disdain for Steve show while doing it.  Steve resolutely did not pout.
"You're coming down from an emotional high.  It gets easier," Steve offered.
"  That time had probably been before when he could have told Steve about Viper.
"No," Steve said, a little worried where this line of questioning was going.  "He and Iron Man are up in the penthouse."
"She's part of the cleaning staff," Tony replied.  "Don't worry.  Her job won't be in jeopardy.  I'll even put in a small bonus for her.  Wouldn't be the first time."
"I'll take the quinjet out and meet-"
"Yeah," Steve said as he breathed out.  There was a weapon pressed right next to his cheek, but he knew Iron Man wouldn't hurt him.  He relaxed, opening his eyes to see iron Man kneeling in front of him.  He must be out of it not to have heard him move.
Doom drew back enough to fiddle with the controls on his wrists and the device on the reactor grew small legs, clamping down on Tony's chest.  The device let out a white glow, humming softly as it worked.  It's light's color faded to grey, then darkened with every passing moment.  Soon it almost had the same dark glow of the portal and Steve shivered in the memory of it.
.  He struck below the belt and struck hard, and Steve almost believed the sentiment on bad days.  The serum should have been able to save Bucky, but he'd failed and...
all of those things," he said helplessly.
"Tony?"
He just needed a body, right?  A hologram one.  He saw the snag in the code that kept him from manifesting and righted it before Kestrel could see it.
The blue dragon looked about to argue, but was quelled by a strong sense of disapproval from the red one.  His head hung low, and Tony was reminded of a kicked puppy.  Despite the fact that the dragon had attacked him, Tony felt a bit of sympathy for being on the wrong end of that stare.
"Hey, Tony," he said casually, taking in all that he could just from looking at Tony's back as he moved closer.  There was a tension in Tony's shoulders and a jerkiness to the chopping noises that made Steve worry.
"Shh," Kestrel said, hugging Susan back and crying freely.  "You found us.  You did it."
be better.  I...  I need..."
He did pass out when the golden light started and the pain became too much for him to take.  '
Stark shook it mournfully.  "How do you like that, drinking a man's whiskey without saving the parched man a drop."
She leaned against him, absently toying with different shades of pink.  "I missed Susan," she said finally, her breath hitching.  "I... I really just wanted to see her again.  Thinking of her was the reason I could deal with everything.  And now..."
"You don't like any of this."  Tony picked up the lantern and gave the room one last look around.  There was really no choice but to go down.
He flushed in shame admitting that.  He'd been trying so hard to keep going.  But it just wasn't enough on his own.  He met Iron Man in the library a lot of nights, and the nightmare Tony had stumbled upon was far from the first or the last.  Dealing with Tony, it'd given him something to do that wasn't just pretending to the others that he was alright.  It had certainly helped him get over his heartbreak, though admittedly that was more complicated than he'd originally realized.
"He's awake," Rhodey said, smothering a yawn of his own.
"Let it go!" Viper cried, anguish in her voice.
For a long while Tony didn't move.  Steve expected some kind of joke to laugh it off, probably an innuendo of some sort, but nothing was forth coming.  Then he slowly reached for the helmet, an unseen release clicking as he lifted it up.
"He is dying.  He would not survive on the surface anyway.  If the cold and metal didn't kill him, humans would.  You would do well to put your pet down," Viper said conversationally.
They also brought ice chips and water, and those were awesome.  The cool water felt like bliss running down his ragged throat, and he would have made himself sick had the nurse not stopped him with a frown and gentle admonishments.
"You wanted to change what you saw.  We just changed part of it, so you
try waking up and lacking a tail," Steve grumbled.  "Dragon dancing was so much easier.  I think if I try to follow, I'll trip up even worse.  I haven't had a lot of practice with human dancing."
The train ground against the metal of her suit.  Tony chimed in her ear about the suit's integrity still holding.  Soon she had to slowly cut the power on the repulsors so that she wasn't pushing the train too far.  Finally, she let go completely, letting the train slow to a halt on its own.  She flew off a little ways, watching it come to a complete stop with some trepidation.
Tony laughed.  "Alright, 'Captain America.'  Lead the way," Tony said, humming a Cole Porter tune under his breath.
attractive like this."
would think of that. He was pretty sure asking would just get him an unimpressed look on both accounts.
"You are, Smithsonian," Stark said, knocking Steve's hand away.  His brown eyes were hard and angry.  "Because I was supposed to be
"How did you deal with it?" she asked.  She wanted it to be better
The airman smiled.  "Of course, sir.  I'll radio you an escort."
"I know what you saw," Tony said, cutting him off.  He wasn't sure he could handle Steve saying it.  "Don't worry about it.  It's not your problem."
"Of course," Steve reassured her, knowing all too well how that felt.
He looked down at the wires that had been torn out of the heart pump, thankfully none of them ruined too far beyond repair.  The heart itself still worked, the orichalcum still lodged in as a battery source.  Whether she was cruelly letting him die of something other than his bum heart or she actually meant that moment of understanding, he didn't know.  He shivered at the thought of her fingers on his chest, however, and he had to force down the nausea that thought brought up.
"Ms. Castillo was crying in one of the meeting rooms she was supposed to be cleaning two or three years ago," Stark said, looking away.  "I was avoiding Ob- I was avoiding Stane when I found her.   Apparently her ex-boyfriend was an abusive asshole who was threatening to kidnap their daughter and kill anyone in the way, including the other kids at the SI-run daycare.  So I offered to let Gabriella stay in the office with me for the week it took for the police to find him, since it's pretty hard to get through the security to make it up here.  She was five, I think?  She helped me with the paperwork.  I may have also hired the best prosecuting lawyers I could find in the case against him."
"You always know exactly the right thing to say," Steve said.  Usually the only one who could get Steve out of his shell was Bucky, and with Bucky gone...  but Iron Man had been slowly filling that ache, constantly surprising Steve and making him just a little bit guilty.  He didn't want to replace Bucky.  He also didn't want to give up Iron Man.
She crouched down low to the ground, fanning her wings out.  "Come on, up you get."
"Sorry," Kes said, not meeting Susan's eyes. "I was...  I'll leave you alone here.  It's-"
.  He doesn't have my issues.  He can be friendly, he can crack corny jokes, and he can be on a team.  He can save the world and be a good guy.  I don't know if you've noticed, but none of those describe me."
Steve pulled off his undershirt as he reached his door, grabbing the uniform and slipping it on.  "Have everyone get out there stat.  I'll join them in the quinjet in five."
Now he was going to have to try it again, if Tony was spending all that money on him. He'd learned the hard way early on just to accept Tony's gifts as long as they weren't too extravagant, so he forced a smile. "Thanks."
He pushed those thoughts away, but he had the feeling his walls still weren't up to snuff, not when Peggy's tail was tightening comfortingly around him.  He could still feel Steve in the back of his mind, but when he looked up, the blue dragon was no where to be found.  That surprisingly hurt in a way that felt not unlike betrayal, though he couldn't have said why exactly.  Tony sternly reminded himself that the others had good reason to be angry with him.  After what he'd done...
"Wow, that's depressing."
"But I..."
Steve pushed himself up to see a portal of some sort.  It was black and fluctuating, and Steve immediately felt nauseous.  He stepped back, the sick feeling fading as he moved further away.  He was grateful for that, at least.  Whatever that glowing circle as, it wasn't good.
"Where is the other twin?" Kor'la'vin asked, her knife pricking at Leon's neck.
"Fine," Steve said, only a little petulant as the emotions let up.  "Come on.  Let's..."
"We're going to New York," Pepper said cheerfully, reaching over her papers to pick up a tray.  She then thrust it on Tony, preempting his attempt to get up.  He looked down at the tray, taking stock of the juice and sandwiches.  There was even some fresh fruit on there, which was how he knew they were spoiling him because they thought he was sick.  There was a folder off to the side of the food, which caught his curiosity.
"You okay, Steve?" Iron Man asked, coming around the desk to put a hand on Steve's shoulder.  It was comforting, but Steve didn't know if he deserved it.
Stark had his chin up defiantly, like he expected Steve to yell at him too.  Steve was honestly a bit too blown away by Stark's bravery and kindness to yell, however.  "You could have been hurt."
"No."  Petulance didn't really begin to cover Steve's half-asleep tone.  His tail was wrapped firmly around Tony's waist and his wing came up to hide Tony entirely from view.
Thankfully the dream hadn't gone on as long as it had in the past.  He'd woken up before the worst of it happened, and he shuddered.  Something outside must have woken him, and he was grateful.
A strange name, but he was used to strange names in his business.  The snake motif made a lot more sense, at least.  He looked at the trees and then back to the suit.  It wouldn't do any better in those trees than dragons would, and going by air would offer too little cover if Steve or one of the other dragons came back.  It was still early in the morning, though, so he could probably make it back in time by dinner if he walked it.  "Well then, Miss Viper, if you'd like to climb up on my back, we can get started."
"Well, this time will be different," Steve said, pulling Tony up off the living room couch and setting aside his tablet.  "Come to dinner with me."
though."
"Sharon has just been made part of the-" Another dragon name-feeling, but this time it was an aerial image of the city and a sense of
Rubbing his forehead, Steve huffed out a soft laugh.  When had either Tony Stark or Iron Man ever made things easy on him?
since he'd been trapped, not hours.  "That's impossible.  I was - Never mind.  The dragons are-"
Tony paused in eating the underworld equivalent of a mango.  "You haven't actually...?"
"Shh," Steve said, pulling Tony into a tight embrace.  "I've got you.  I'll catch you."
"A message?" Steve looked over at Iron Man, who was shifting on the couch.
"What's in the folder?" he asked as he picked up a sandwich.  He should be starving, especially after going so long without normal human meals, but he didn't really taste the food he forced himself to eat.
"You make me feel warmer than the lava baths."
"You had to jinx it," she muttered darkly, cutting the shield and diving towards the gun controls.  She put up the shields again, ignoring Tony calling out 75%.  She held, the suit locating the angle of her attacker as she waited for the next blast.  When she heard the gun recharge, she counted to three and dropped the shields.  Her boots burst to life, throwing her into the nearby wall.  It hurt like a bitch, but she twisted to shoot her attacker as the blast took out the controls of the heavy artillery that had been behind her.
Kes nodded, wiping away her tears.  "The best," she agreed, bowing her head slightly and not meeting Susan's eyes.  "So you tell me if Leo ever hurts you, because I'll fry him with War Machine's repulsors if he ever does."
Steve eyes widened.  "Shell... Tony, you
Steve pushed down his disappointment.  Except he hadn't hidden it very well, because Iron Man was babbling on.  "You're already protecting them as an Avenger, Steve.  I knew Happy before all of this, so he already knows who I am, or I'd be asking the Avengers for help.  Just with Rhodey specifically targeted, Mr. Stark thought it might be a good precaution."
"Do you have a minute?"
He just couldn't stop wishing they were more.
After that, Tony felt like he was reading a Jules Verne novel.  If that was a cave, then the next mural showed a paradise under the earth, lush and green.  Tony snorted at the thought.  He didn't know what was under the earth, but he was pretty darn sure it wasn't utopia.  He'd gotten his hopes up at the first two pictures, but now he knew it was just a farce.  Whatever Hydra thought was down here, it had to be a dead end.
"How can you..." Tony started to ask, then stopped himself.  Steve had gotten the crystal to make Tony feel more at ease and still wanted to stay out here with him instead of going in where it was warmer.  But Tony could still feel the tightly coiled anger.  "You're still angry."
"A warrior's exploits in the bedroom make for a grand epic in the songs of Asgard," Thor added over the com.  "It goes well with aged mead."
Just for that comment, Steve made the meatballs extra big.  Natasha was not amused.
That was probably truer than he cared to let on.  He did miss New York, but not as much as he missed the people.
"But?" Steve prompted, because the last few times Tony had never even hinted he might have found them.
"And what is Natasha saying that put the red in red, white, and blue?" Tony asked.
Tony could see his tail trembling and pain in the line of his wings.  He tried to stand and Tony put his gun away to rest a hand on Steve's shoulder.  "Shh...  Steve, stay down.  You're okay."
He was pulled into the long hall as Tony desperately worked out angles and how the hell tentacles were stronger than the armor.  That was a completely unacceptable design flaw that he was going to remedy in the next upgrade.  He shivered.
"The metal doesn't harm you," Steve said.  "It might not block it completely for you."
Traveling back down the wall of murals was less interesting the second time around, even though he had a better light source than his flashlight with a moss lamp he had rigged up with Sharon.  He ignored most of the murals, knowing that they would be better explained by the dragons themselves.  The thought of that niggled at him, but it was quickly pushed away as he reveled in being by himself.  It was also a much more pleasant journey without having to worry about his ankle or his ribs.
"No lifts," Tony said reproachfully, though his lips were pressed together in a way that reminded Steve of Rhodey's impassiveness at Tony's antics.  Except Tony was nowhere as proficient at pretending he wasn't amused, as Steve could see the slight twitch of a smile.
"You're
But then Steve's hands were gone.  Tony did not let out a whimper at the loss, he really didn't.  He would deny that until his dying day.  He jumped as he felt Steve against his back, his chin resting on Tony's shoulder.  "Steve?" he asked uncertainly.
"He... That's really not why I'm asking about Mr. Stark," Steve said with a sigh.  "Shellhead made his choice and I respect that.  Or I try to, most of the time."
"What's wrong?" Steve asked, reaching out and kneading Tony's shoulders to help him relax.
"You're a failure, Tony."
Natasha shrugged.  "Could have been worse," she said, and yeah, it really could have been.  "He's not the most attentive when it comes to cooking, especially when he's distracted.  The chicken's too chunky though, that's unusual for him."
Feeling a little ridiculous, Tony closed his eyes and... well, he didn't know how to
"You miss home," Wanda said.
" Steve growled, because no way in hell was he letting a fake Iron Man see Tony when he was hurt.
Tony flinched this time as Steve moved closer, but as much as Steve longed to hug Tony, he didn't quite trust himself not to also shake him.  "We've never really talked about this, I guess," Steve said, rubbing at his forehead, just above his eye.  It was easier not to talk about it.  Neither of them really
"It's nothing against you personally," Ms. Potts said.  "But we've seen him hurt too many times, even by people like you who actually want to try."
Tony hesitated, then lowered the mental wall he constructed, just a little.  He didn't know if Steve was listening, but he pictured the stars as well as he could.  The North Star, ursa minor, Orion, Andromeda, and Draco, just for kicks.  He pictured them on a clear night in Lucerne from before the War.  Rhodey and Virgil fixing a meal while Giulietta curled against his side on the terrace as he told her about the constellations.  He should take Pepper there when the War ended.  She wouldn't be impressed, but she deserved to be pampered a little after all the grief he'd put her through.  When the War ended...
There was something soft and inviting brushing across his lips.
She tensed.  She'd hoped he would let it go.
Steve winced.  That was the exact opposite of the reason he and the other Avengers were here tonight, and now people were staring.  Still, at least it was him and not Natasha attracting the creepers tonight.  Natasha took entirely too much pleasure in leading creepy men off and doing things that made Steve shudder to think of, and Tony had asked them all to play nicely tonight.
"Yeah," Tony said, gripping the crystal tightly.  After all the disbelief, it had been real.  "It was."
"Hey, no, come back," Tony said.  "Scale wings are cool, and you've got interesting aerodynamics!"
"Agent Coulson was the one who ran that op," Fury said.
"Why would he do that?" Steve asked, baffled.  Unless SHIELD was really
Wanda leaned down, closing her eyes as she rubbed her cheek against his.  Tony was shocked to stillness.  The other dragons used their claws still; it was only Steve who ever rubbed their cheeks together, and Tony had gotten the impression only those that were really close did it.
Leo was.  Usually he teased her more.
"We'll
"You okay?"  There were two hands on his shoulders.  Tony looked up into cobalt eyes that were warm and open.  Steve moved one hand to Tony's forehead, humming softly.
"I nearly lost you," Steve said finally, his voice a soft whisper in the quiet of the room.  "Except I had already done that.  I'd lost you because I was being stubborn about the wrong things."
Tony, who was the king of non sequiturs, didn't even bat an eye.  "Vodka?"
The next day Steve posted a reply. '
"You can't save everyone sometimes," Steve said.  "No one can."
"Hello?" he called out.  He made sure the boulders he'd been working on were stable before clunking back towards the gate.  He saw no one on the way, and it had definitely come from inside the gate, not out of it.  He went past the gate to the other side, where he'd discovered a pit about eleven feet deep that Tony had classified as a dead end his first day of working.  "Anyone here?" he asked as he neared the pit.
"Gossip rag?" Clint asked, plucking the phone out of Steve's fingers.  "Oh, blind items.  I know someone who loves these."
of classified information.
"You shouldn't bully people into answering," he said with faint disapproval.  Though he should answer her before she put her threat to use and potentially hurt herself further.  "About a month," he said finally, feeling the blush creep up his neck.  Natasha had, admittedly, been out most of that month, but he could see her reclassifying every encounter with him since.
Steve's face lit up in a smile Tony had seen once before in the old news reels, but never in this time.  It looked right out of that old video they played in the museums, but
"What?" Tony said, now trying to bat off the red material he was being wrapped in.  It took longer than it should have to realize he could see now.  Had Thor brought a light?  Didn't matter though.  There was something else important.  Something...  Steve!  "We can't leave.  No, put me down!"
"That could be arranged," Kor'la'vin said, though she looked suspicious.  "I wasn't aware a hero would change sides so quickly."
"You'll see soon enough," Viper said.  She walked over to the wall and stood in the same place as the hidden buttons in the metal room.  Instead of the altar clicking and becoming movable,the wall parted, showing a wide hall way.  She beckoned, and Tony felt the skull beginning to move, walking with the tentacles that weren't holding him down.  It also tightened around his gauntlet so he couldn't twist it.
Tony stiffened, because of course that's how Hydra was getting the information they needed.  Which meant Steve-
"And War Machine and Iron Man, they're always best friends.  That's what you told me," Susan continued.  "So you have to be - Kes?"
"You..." She listed forward, and Susan caught her this time.  Steve stepped back, giving the girls some space.
"It wasn't your fault, JARVIS," Steve said, looking once again at the door and biting his lip.  "Is it alright for me to go in?"
"Something wrong, Captain?" Vision asked. "FRIDAY informed me that you were going through punching bags at an accelerated rate. I thought I should inquire if you needed assistance."
Tony couldn't help it.  He looked up in surprise, catching Steve's eyes.  They were trained on him with a stubborn set of Steve's chin.  "Why?" Tony asked, his voice dull and blank.
Tony looked down.  He didn't deserve their friendship.  "Just eat," Sam said, rubbing Tony's cheek with his claw as he sent along feelings of genuine affection that shocked Tony down to his core.  He knew Steve was fond of him, but the others...
A small shriek sent him barreling towards the living room of the penthouse, alarmed to feel
Steve stayed behind him until he calmed down more, then called for a nurse.  The lights hurt his eyes for longer than he should have thought possible, but Tony was glad for them and the flurry of activity the nurses brought with them.  It was easy to remember he wasn't alone with them there.  Easier to forget the fact that Steve hadn't left.
"We're both fine," Natasha said.  "Being cooped up that long wasn't a picnic for either of us, but Doom explained some of what was going on when he let us go."
Kestrel looked guilty, which wasn't a good sign, but she nodded.  Rhodey gave him one more hug, then followed Leon out of the room.
Kang's hand was moving towards his belt and he hit a button on it, dispelling the current.
"Not saying you can't," Steve said, forcing his own temper down as he closed the distance between them again.  He took one of Tony's hands and massaged the tension out of it.  "I know you can.  I just want to make sure you're comfortable."
to him," Natasha's voice came from the other side of the wall, slowly coming closer.  Tony was relieved that the shared look of worry was at least not about him this time.  "You saw the video!  Even if you don't feel the same, you need to-"
Rhodey didn't mention how his voice cracked.  "You miss him."
That explained a few things.  Tony made a mental note to always take his helmet off if he ever did bring the suit back out.  "It was a little muffled, but I could hear you yelling while I had the suit on.  I could still hear you, and some of your feelings."
It took all of Steve's willpower not to punch the door and dent it.  He breathed in through his nose, then let it out slowly.  He was practically shaking with rage, but he needed a clear head.  What was it Ms. Potts said?  Swallowing his pride.  Tony had done that on purpose, damn him.  A large part of him resented Stark for that, especially since the issue was forced.  Something was obviously wrong.  As much as Steve wanted to, he couldn't just let that go.
Making sure that Tony was staying put, he grabbed the eggs off the burner and checked to see if they were salvageable.  They weren't, and Steve felt a moment's pang for the waste.  Then Tony started laughing, and Steve felt his own smile start to hurt with how wide it was as he turned off the stove.
"Do you need back up?"
"Please, Tony.  Let us help," Steve pleaded.
Tony pulled off one of the gauntlets, then laid a careful hand on Steve's shoulder joint.  "How 'bout now?"
An hour after it was posted, Wanda came in to sit with him, curled up in a chair with a book Rhodey had bought her.  It was enough.
"Not for the claustrophobic," Tony said.  He pat Steve's flank once more before giving him a sloppy salute and walking towards the door.
warned him off.  He probably should have tried again later, or at least waited until Tony was comfortable talking.  He sighed, figuring Tony's apologies would probably work so long as Steve himself owed them.  Considering his own human nature, that might be unlikely.  "Sorry," he said contritely, hugging Tony a little tighter.  Neither of them were very good at this, it seemed.
She blinked, fighting back tears.  She couldn't cry now, not with Kes and Leo here.  She would just have to give the armor to Kes and find her old suit.  They could probably find the parts somewhere, and Kes could finally join her brother in the fight.  That was
.  When Steve had been happy back then, it was still missing the spark it had now.
"To bring you cookies?" Steve said, not sure where this cold welcome was coming from.
"Let it not be said Gloom can't make an entrance.  He's gone though, so you guys can stand down or whatever," Tony said.  Steve looked over to see both him and Rhodey entering the room.  Tony looked almost as if nothing had even happened.  He was bruised and had a few scars from the battle with Kang that hadn't healed, but it was like the past four days hadn't happened.  They
Peggy touched his cheek once and he allowed himself to lean into it briefly before bracing himself for the pain.  Peggy had steady and gentle claws, but there was no helping some of the pain. Thankfully with Tony's guidance, it was a quick job.
It didn't help that she was looking at him like he was a particular breed of adorable puppy who had the flu.  "I understand you're looking for a meeting with Mr. Stark," she said, finally taking pity on him.
Tony shot at the hydra's neck as he flew by with a rapid line of bullets, aiming the flame thrower at the neck that was now only barely clinging to the base by bits of skin.  One of the other heads knocked into him and threw his aim off.  He spun out of control, dropping about fifty feet before he righted himself, stomach flopping as he swallowed back his breakfast.
"Hi," Steve said, his wings folded tightly against his body.
Setting the tray on the table, he looked around.  "Tony?" he called out when there was still no answer.
Damn.  He had to tangle with a true believer, didn't he?  Whatever happened to the innocent priestesses who just took care of their temples?  "Steve-"
"That so?" Fury said, pulling Steve out of his thoughts.
Tony tightened his own mental walls, but Steve didn't appear to notice.  "It's no fairy tale," Tony said, leaning against the rail of the balcony and trying not to shiver.  What had felt nice when he came out was quickly becoming just the wrong side of cold.
But the blast didn't shatter the crystal, or even reflect off.  The crystal absorbed the repulsor blast, glowing faintly.
"Relax, Cap.  We're almost home," Tony said, glancing up from his tablet to see Steve sigh and sit down.
Wanda was regarding him with curiosity.  "Your culture has strange notions of what should and should not be shared," she said, though there was no judgement in her tone.  "Do you not share your happiness?"
"Huh," Tony said, pushing over a cup of coffee that had probably been his.  Steve didn't care, clutching at it possessively despite the fact caffeine did nothing for him.  "I wasn't expecting that."
"Come on, Cap," Tony said, a gleeful look in his eyes.  "Let's go scandalize the presses."
"It's not my fault you can't appreciate the finer applications of licking and-"
not the one with the army up there," Tony said defensively.
Pain, sharp and vicious, arched up his back.  He could hear Steve's roar through the HT and had to bite back his own scream.
"It's late.  The moss light is fading.  The crystal Viper stole won't be fully charged yet," she said.
"No, but you wanted it to be," Jarvis said, rubbing his temples.  "Look, Tony, your father would never have approved of-"
He made it to the bathroom before he threw up.
Hospitals were terrible places.  The inoffensively painted walls and the pastel green of the chair made for a terrible work environment.  Add to the fact that nurses, doctors, and patients alike had a tendency to stop and stare at celebrities who randomly sat outside a hospital room, it was amazing Tony could concentrate at all.  But he plugged in his earphones and blocked out anything but Steve's monitors with hard rock as he meticulously went line by line through JARVIS's code.
"That ship sailed, Tony," Steve said, finally looking away and allowing Tony some relief.  "She's moved on.  And to tell the truth, so have I."
, and Steve related to that far more than he really wanted to admit.  The serum had been his way of changing how people viewed him too.  "So he became Iron Man," he said.
Steve went over to Tony, feeling like he was intruding on their reunion.  Still, it was hard to tear his eyes away from the girls, especially when they had worked so hard for this moment.  "How is he?" he asked Tony quietly.
"Excuse me?" Steve had
"I can?"
"Shh..."  Steve's breath hitched and Tony's arms tightened around him.  He buried his face in Tony's neck, feeling awful.  He shouldn't be making Tony uncomfortable like this.
He glanced up to see Steve collecting himself and setting his shoulders back.  Steve moved closer, stealing Rhodey's chair.
"How did you-"
"Bruce said there was some variable introduced to keep you from realizing something was wrong," Clint said.
* * *
smirk crossed her mother’s face, and Susan shot at her.
Mem: Because when could I say no to dancing?  XD
"No, you're not," Tony said, because Steve was two feet away and not holding him.  He swallowed back bile, then pulled the ring off his finger.
Steve matched the expression, keeping his face very serious even as he fought off a smile.  "Trying to start again on the right foot.  Ya gotta better way to get to know a new friend?"
That must have been the mistake Fury wanted him to correct, Steve realized.  The one Phil regretted.  "I don't understand.  Why did that turn out to be such a bad thing?"
"Didn't mean to interrupt," Leo said quietly, trying not to hobble as he came in.
"How well can you maneuver?" Steve asked, a thoughtful expression in his eyes as he watched their joined hands.
The man was more amused than he was letting on, so Steve leaned back on the park bench he'd been sitting on.  "You know that would only spark more interest."
Steve started to follow after him, but Natasha's soft "Wait" stopped him.  He looked back to see her blowing on a spoonful of the soup.  "The vegetables got a little burnt," Steve said.
"Don't you
Before Peggy's exasperation could get the better of her and start them bickering, Tony tried to wrestle control of the conversation back.  "Usually once one of you is far enough away, I can't feel you any more.  How come I can still feel Steve?"
"Okay, kiddo.  Fixing things is what I'm good at," Tony said, finally looking over at Steve.  His husband, who stayed a good distance away despite the fact that Tony had been gone for... five months?  Wow.  That was a while.  Tony felt a pang of betrayal, and he scanned Steve for Skrull DNA, but came up with nothing but a hologram.  Was he still that angry?
Steve raised an eyebrow, not believing it in the slightest.
He had barely been flying for a couple of minutes when he was slammed into the wall, evil-looking stairs catching his fall.
"I just don't understand why a person would do that," Steve said, sitting down on the bench as he grabbed a water bottle and held the cold water against his forehead.  His stomach twisted into knots thinking about it, and even if he wasn't paid for his art, it still felt like someone was stealing a bit of his soul.  He was angry and hurt and with the internet being what it was, he had no face to blame or recompense to find.  It just... hurt.
Steve watched the cameras, Tony curled up against his side.  They were both alert and looking for danger, but Tony preferred to pretend he was also glancing through news reports.  His left hand was tapping intently against Steve's thigh, however, so he knew his husband was still tense.
"We're entering the city, if you'd like to look.  We're landing soon," Peggy said, and he grabbed hold of her spike.  As much as he didn't want the flight to end, the city was fascinating.  Dragons flew across the city sky, darting between buildings or flying lazily in circles.  There were rounded towers that held stones aloft at their peaks that made Tony burn with curiosity.  He wanted dearly to study the gravitational device used.  There were other buildings too, with long chimneys and wide balconies, decorated with myriads of colors and ornamental patterns that reminded Tony of the east.  Did dragons use similar ways to make pigments or did they have other ways to make the vivid colors?  They had to, for them to still be so bold when he wasn't given the impression that they were newly painted.  Or maybe it was the fact it was underground, lacking in the elements that darken and erode human colors.
" Steve said, his voice distant and angry.  "
At least Bruce had a handle on it.  And if it made him happy, Steve supposed he couldn't protest.  He did trust both Bruce and the Hulk, but he was also worrying in a way that Steve was not going to think about while carrying a torch for someone else.
"You're underground, human," the brown dragon said, amusement once again lacing his voice.  "The stones and moss light our sky, and magic darkens it."
"Tony, please."  It was his name. It wasn't just the spoken sounds, but his dragon name underneath, calling to every part of the soul that Tony didn't believe in.  He was fixed in place as Steve weakly leaned up so that his cheek rested against Tony's as if it were too much to move more than that.  Tony's hands automatically came up to support Steve's head, and he felt Steve sigh and relax.  Steve's mind brushed against his, open love and affection.  Absolution that Tony didn't deserve.
Steve immediately put the tablet down. "You found him?"
He shot replusor blasts at the ceiling then banked hard to the left at the very last second, turning again to go back down before he hit the other wall.  The turn nearly caused him to black out, but he scrambled to remain conscious as he avoided the tangle of jaws that tried to snap at him.
"She's back at the murals," Sam replied.  "Said there was something she wanted to try."
"JARVIS was interrupted," Steve said, bringing up Tony's hands to rub them between his own.
"I should call Darcy again as well," Thor said thoughtfully.  He was smiling absently, with a glow in his eyes he only ever got when talking about Jane.  "Jane's enthusiasm also makes her forget the needs of her body."
, because someone will steal it and hurt people.  It's all going to be used to kill people and it's my own goddamn fault for-"
The temple was easy enough to find and much faster to get to than when Tony was going by foot.  He landed with a clunk in the empty courtyard where he'd dropped Viper off.  Steve had a lot more trouble with the trees as he tried to drop down, and Tony could feel his frustration as yet another branch scratched him.
"He turned me down," Steve said.  And it still hurt.  He doubted he could ever really stop loving Iron Man, any more than he could stop loving Peggy.  But Iron Man had turned him down, even if those feelings had been reciprocated to some degree.  "I can't say I'm not still in love with him, but I'm not gonna waste the chance to have something good between us because he said no.  It's time I moved on."
To avoid getting an elbow to the gut when Steve inevitably tried again, Tony reached up.  Steve went completely still as Tony touched his cheek.  He rubbed it gently, the motion far more intimate than it ever had been with the dragons.
."  Steve
"I started when I heard you guys coming in!"
Steve did.  It was one of Clint's kids.
"It's for more than just Avengers art. It's a way to connect with other people, and a lot of fans post on both Tumblr and a DeviantArt."
Sighing, Steve kept a tight hold on his fury as he counted in his head.  His hand tightened around Tony's wrists, tight enough to bruise before he realized and automatically loosened his grip.  The shame at that more than anything calmed him down.  Tony didn't even wince at what no doubt had to be painful.  "Tony," Steve said, his voice more raw than he liked, but he pushed on anyway.  "What's going on? Is it Doom?"
"No, thank you, Ma'am," he said politely.  "I believe your husband might be looking for you."
"Serum," Steve interrupted.
"And I know you've already figured all of that out," Natasha said with a sigh.  "So I don't know why you're asking me."
"The Avengers, huh?" the man said, speaking for the first time.  "Those are pretty tall boots to fill."
...straight into a concerned Captain America.  "Susan says you've been awfully quiet," he said, thankfully not bringing up Leon's stomach.
"Haha," Tony said, crossing his arms.  "You should take this show on the road.  You'd make hundreds as a comedian."
"Could go either way.  I'm up for a wager if you are," Clint replied.
This was getting out of hand.  "Jan-"
"Fine," Tony said, wiping up the last of the sauce with a kind of steamed bread that the dragons liked to eat for desert.  One thing he'd say about dragon cuisine was that they did have some amazing sauces.  "Something up?"
"I'm not-" Steve started to say, except he really sort of was.  "It's complicated.  Is Clint okay?"
Tony looked up at him in surprise. "You usually take to new technology pretty quickly. What happened with the tablet?"
"Food won't solve everything," Steve said, his voice quiet and full of empathy.
He jumped when arms snuck around him, the bond growing stronger with the contact.  Steve was pouring emotion through the link - love and affection that made Tony both shaken and angry.  "Don't-"
Steve laughed, a low chuckle that made Tony's heart pump work over time.  "You could say that," he said, shaking his head.  "I've never... I must have seen them a thousand times, but never like this."
"We can't leave him here!" Tony said, twisting around so he could see, but Rhodey held him fast.
When it was done, he spit out the belt and gasped for breath, trying not to jostle his arm too much and add to it.  There was a tail wrapped comfortingly around his waist that helped support him, but when he opened his eyes, it wasn't blue.  Peggy was bracing him, lightly rubbing his back.
"Tony?"
Sighing, Steve leaned over his knees and put his face in his hands.  "Then why do I feel like the bad guy here?" he asked the empty room.
"Oh?" Tony said.  He reached out for the bowl.  "I guess the ice cream isn't needed then if-"
Tony breathed out, closing his eyes against the relief that washed through him.  The dragons were real.  Completely impossible, but Rhodey believed him.
"You can't sleep or get tired," Susan said.
"Steve," Tony said, quickly losing patience.  "Do you know him or not?  He is..." Tony stopped, then forced the words out around the lump in his throat.  "He was a dragon.  I was down there with him for weeks and he'd never been to the upper world.  He had a terrible poker face, so I'd know if...  Why are you staring at me like that?  Do I have something on my face?"
Steve turned to see Iron Man waving from a few secluded bushes.  He had half a hot dog in his hand.  "Is everything alright?"
"Because I don't trust the majority of humans any more than you do," Tony said shrewdly.  "Besides, are you just going to keep me a prisoner here for the rest of my life?"
Steve got off him, but cautiously, like he still wasn't convinced that Tony was telling the truth.  "I couldn't sense you in there," Steve said.
It was a simple mission.  According to Tony's reconnaissance, the Skrulls were trying to keep the transfer under-wraps so there were only a handful of soldiers assigned to the train.  There were two big artillery guns that Susan could take out with a well-placed missile if she could get close enough, and one she had to take out manually since it was too close to the prisoners.  With those out of the way, she could get the prisoners with the special harness she and Tony had rigged up that could accommodate two potentially injured twins (God, please no).  Then she could get out and fly at a safe speed for her passengers while Tony and Cap ran interference on the computer end of things.
Steve didn't dare contradict her by mentioning that she'd just been complaining about it.  First battles were a lot to take in.  "Are you hurt?" he asked, not sure how else to react in this situation.  Pepper was the one who always seemed put-together.
He realized his mistake the moment he walked out and heard a loud roar.  He didn't even have a chance to fire this time, finding himself being pinned to the ground with a giant claw being pressed against the thin metal next to his throat.  "Where is Tony Stark?" Steve demanded, his voice sounding farther away than he was.  Tony was surprised to hear more worry than suspicion in Steve's mental voice.
"That's for sure," Clint agreed.
"We'll find another way.  You can't use that spell," Steve said.
Tony screamed again as the naga dragged him up by his bad arm.  He tried to kick and throw the naga off, but the pain was too overwhelming and he was easily over-powered.  Fire engulfed his arm despite the cold, and he could do nothing against it.
Steve elected to ignore him.  "It's about Mr. Stark."
"I don't know," Steve said, hands tracing Tony's back soothingly.  "Herrera and Johnson survived well enough.  More than well enough, from what I heard."
They were hard for Tony to get down, but not bad enough that he had to actually climb them and the walking stick helped.  "Do all dragon buildings have stairs?" he asked, wondering why dragons might need them at all.
"Natasha-"
, only two years older than Susan.  They were children and he could see the signs of abuse and torture in the countless bruises, the way the clothes practically fell off of them, Leon's mangled leg, and the marks on Kestrel's throat and back.  He was half tempted to pull up a punching bag and start systematically taking it apart.  He didn't have the pent-up energy in his body anymore, but he did have a very strong urge to punch something.
"Right," Susan said, biting her lip.
"Anyone ever mention how bull-headed you are?" Rhodey said with a sigh.  "Notice anything about the quantities, Cap?"
"One of the dragons," Tony said.  "The big blue one that-"
"Steve!" he said, poking the dragon's cheek and swallowing around the giant block in his throat.  "Steve, sweetheart, I need you to wake up.  I need you to open those baby blues for me.  Steve, please!"
"I decided to wake up first today," Steve said, his usual grumpiness gone.  Tony wondered if Peggy had brought him a snack, because usually only hunger was enough to rouse Steve from his dreams.  "Couldn't leave you by yourself."
That was probably well deserved, but Tony glared anyway.  The little 'punk' (as Steve liked to put it) didn't have to rub it in.
"Sorry, princess, but this suit's purely automated.  No room for a human in the casing.  Didn't have time to fix one up for you."  It was a shock hearing his voice in the suit after so long, but some part of him felt
She looked alright, no visible bruises or cuts.  Just tired and rumpled, which was probably how they all felt right now.  "I'm actually upgraded to the museum of science and technology," Steve replied, turning the phone to show her the Mark VIII.
Correction: Tony was
"You're worse than Rhodey," Tony muttered.  "Natasha would have me made by the end of the week."
Tony nodded numbly, forgetting to breathe for a moment when Steve smiled at him.  He was off kilter, but he didn't mind the new direction.
The exploits of 'Captain America' looked to be almost as popular as his time in Marvels.  The newspapers ate him up, proclaimed him to be the all American hero that the war effort needed, which offended Tony slightly because the newspapers never fawned as much over him.
Tony yelped as Peggy's long tail thwapped the ground next to him, sharp spikes on the end gleaming in the light.  "Too crude?" he asked once he found his dignity again.
, his mind supplied.  Steve was kissing him under the stars with his hands framing Tony's face.  Steve was kissing him slowly and sweetly, like the rest of the world and the War didn't exist.
Steve swallowed.  Stark, on the other hand, looked positively gleeful.  "You do that.  If that will be all, Ms. Potts?  I'm sure Captain Rogers would like to get on with our meeting."
and he was living the high life.  Pepper, Rhodey, and Jarvis were still fighting without him, possibly dead already.  He was failing them.  Just like he failed at everything.  He couldn't-
"Doom needs something I can do," Iron Man said.  "I figured Fury would send someone, so we made a deal.  His end of it is to not hurt them and return whoever it was when it was over."
Oh, yeah.  Staying with Steve for as long as possible.  "Still here," he said, though he thought he sounded far away.  A fire would be nice.  He couldn't quite muster up the will to go get firewood though, but Steve would take care of it.
"Told you, kiddo, you want morality, you're talking to the wrong guy."
Tony would have actually paid to see that.  Then again, he wasn't entirely sure he could handle that much bad ass sexy in one place.  He wasn't twenty anymore and Rhodey was entirely too straight for those fantasies.  The thought of it was really doing things for his competency kink though.
"They'll be okay," Tony murmured to himself.
He stood there breathing in and out as he couldn't help thinking about how much had
was something Steve realized he was interested in seeing.
"Can I take a selfie with you?  Monica will be so jealous," she said.
"Okay, that one's on me, I'll admit," Tony said, stepping forward and putting a hand on Steve's back to lead him in.  The point of contact grounded Steve in the present, and Tony rubbed gently between his shoulder blades to loosen the tension he could no doubt feel.  It was the same thing Iron Man did when he caught Steve at a bad moment, but it felt surprisingly better with a human hand.  "Come on in and sit down.  What can I do for you, Steve?"
"  Steve repeated.
"No, I... I can work on it now," Tony said, practically falling over himself to get his hands on the uniform.  Steve was asking him for something, something Tony could actually do.  Something that would keep Steve
Tony glanced at the schematics.  He needed to try...
"That's not the point.  I usually wasn't fighting for me," Steve replied shortly.
"He, uh, wasn't taking no for an answer," Clint said, looking mildly embarrassed from the doorway.  The door itself was hanging on its hinges.
"What can I do to help you, Captain?" JARVIS asked.
"She would have found the crystal regardless.  The only difference is it happened faster and now we have a warning that we would not have had if you had not been there," Wanda said.
Tony took a shallow breath, forcing himself to remain still.  He was not going to panic.  Just because there was no power, didn't mean the others wouldn't find him.  There were trackers that didn't rely on external power sources, and after Afghanistan he kept a few on him at all times.  Of course, that assumed that those power sources hadn't been taken off line by the same EMP that took him out, but people were looking for him.  They had to be.
"I must be terrible," she said quietly.  "I should just want them to be happy, but I'm jealous of my own brother.  They hurt him more, so I shouldn't want..."
"What's wrong?" Viper asked.
Mem: I just really felt the need for some BAMF Sam pulling ridiculously dangerous last second saves and generally being awesome.  And tentacles, because in what universe has Tony not run into tentacles?  None, that's what universe.  It's a universal constant, even for non-powered universes.  XD  Plus, an added bonus of Steve falling out of trees.  I had fun with this part, what can I say.  I really couldn't resist adding in a small reference to AoU when I got back from watching it though.  It was like... the scene of him opening the secret passage was already in the fic.  How could I resist?  XD
By the end of the week, Steve never left the Avengers headquarters without it unless he was rushing to a mission. He made a mental note to thank Tony the next time he was in the city, because it was much better than a napkin. Maybe not something he'd use all the time, but it was certainly convenient.
The image flickered out of existence and Steve stared at where it had been, feeling numb to the world.  He didn't cry. He felt like he should, but he packed it away, pushing down his grief because he couldn't handle it.
"Someone's been here," Tony said, looking at the floor.  It was swept clean, and Tony had some suspicions as to why.
where he could send the results to Stark and let him do the science work.  The fight had taken place on a highway, and there was still clean up to do.
No plan ever survived meeting the enemy, as Cap liked to say.  It wouldn't be that simple.
," Steve repeated.  "Just shut up for a minute."
" Steve said.
He started to sweat as the air heated, but he held steady.  All he had to do was wait for the dragon to take a breath, then he could-
"You're a sap," Tony said, fidgeting.
"You, on the other hand," Tony interrupted.  "Everything special about you came out of a bottle.  You-"
"If you had come to me at the start and told me this, I could have known to trust you," Steve said.
"Okay, you got me curious now," Iron Man said, his voice a little apprehensive.  "Tell me there's songs of-"
"This time will be different," Leon told her.  He was wearing the braces that Tony and Susan had made for him, and he held the energy shield the two of them and Kestrel collaborated on.
Tony Stark could hardly be called shy, but coward wasn't too far off the mark at times.  Option two it was, then.
"He does," Kes said, smiling again.  She looked softer in the garage's harsh lights, her smile gaining a gentle melancholy Susan sometimes saw, but never understood.  "But even if he's my brother, no one gets to hurt you and get away with it, understand?"
"Was specifically aimed to hurt me in every way you've learned since we met to get me to do what you asked me politely to do at the start of this," Steve said, despite how much that stung to admit.  Even when Tony wasn't hurling insults, he was still one of the most infuriating men Steve had ever met.  Bucky would have said they were meant for each other.
"As I said, it is not necessary that you do," Wanda replied.  There was a general air of mystery around her that unnerved Tony just a little.  "Your future is shrouded in calamity, Tony Stark."
"Hey there, Cap.  Hanging out with the rest of the museum's fossils?"
He disappeared then, but his code was still up for her to play with.  She hugged her pillow tighter, then set about coding purple stripes onto his fingers.
Iron Man stopped fighting, the silence deafening.  Steve looked at the chair that was now being ignored by both of them.  He'd never be able to get it to work like Iron Man could, but he had to try.  The thought of what Kang was threatening made his stomach turn.  Not like this.
Two hours and Tony's whole body practically vibrated with the tension of holding still.  "Still no reactor," he croaked, his voice broken and rough.  Too much dust or too much talking.  "Please, JARVIS.  I need...  wake up.  Cap!  Someone...  I don't want to... please."  Tony was begging.  He didn't care who heard him, as long as he wasn't alone.  He didn't want to be alone.
Tony caught it, rolling over just in time to block the axe with the shield.  He brought up his other hand which Steve realized had a small repulsor attached to his palm.  It shot Kang point blank, hitting Kang's belt and setting it off sparking and spreading over the rest of his suit in a small burst.  Kang screamed and fell back on the ground, his body twitching.
There was a strange stillness to the armor.  Iron Man was rarely ever still, and it was something Steve had come to associate with things that upset his friend.  "Not personally," Iron Man said, the mechanized voice without any of the usual inflection.  "He was...  He and Mr. Stark didn't get along.  He wasn't- Never mind.  Going to the gym this late at night?"
"It should be easy to send her a picture," Thor said with a smile.  "Are you in need of her number?"
he'd ended up in this position, or when his hands had gone from boxing Steve in to clutching at his shirt, but he definitely did not mind.  In fact, it was really, really good, especially with Steve's tongue in his mouth.  Tony let out a small whine as he pulled Steve closer.  He could get used to this.  In fact, he could-
"I'm not angry," Steve said, and there was nothing in his body language to contradict his statement.  Which just left Tony even more in the dark.
"Looks like there's some kind of sedative in both of them, and they're not Skrulls according to these readings," Tony said, his voice urgent in her ear.  "This is what we put together the harness for.  We made it just in case something like this happened, remember?"
"They're both fine," Peggy said.
"You were supposed to come in for debrief," Nick Fury said, and Steve did not jump at the sound of his voice.  Really.
Leon shook Tony's hand off, struggling to find some leverage.  "Not human," he muttered.
Which is why he didn't notice Natasha until she sat down next to him, despite the fact he was getting better at sensing her presence. He really was.  No, that wasn't just an excuse.  Damn it.
Tony swallowed.  "It wasn't your fault," he replied, fidgeting against the pillows at his back.  Break-ups took two people, after all, and Tony had done more than his fair share in their fight.
Thor nodded, a gleam in his eyes that set Steve on edge.  "That is indeed a wise choice of action."
"After the War ends," Tony said, for the first time in a long time really considering it.
"How do you spell that first one?" Steve asked. He wasn't surprised to see it already in his URL bar when he got there, however. "Thanks."
Once he could see, the problem was clear.  If he had the breath he had just wasted on being dramatic, Tony would have cursed.  He grabbed a few more tools now that he could see them and carefully reconnected the orichalcum with shaking hands.  Then he grabbed the extra flashlight battery, shucking the casing as quickly as he could.  He closed his eyes and didn't bother to attempt a deep breath, connecting the charge.
"You should go help Thor," Tony said.
"No one here," he said, walking forward.  As he moved closer, the moss lantern's light filled the room.  The red object turned out to be a skull of some kind.
"I'm here because of a fantastically bad idea on Rhodey's part.  You should be proud of her," Tony said, humming at the readings on a device.  He set down the kit and picked out a second device that Steve didn't recognize, but a quick access to the server told him was the modern equivalent of a needle.  "You've got Captain America behind you.  You should remember his program.  Say hi, Cap."
"Bringing you coffee counts as taking care of you.  Should I just take these back then?" Rhodey asked.
"Steve?" Tony said, though he didn't move away.  His eyes were wide in surprise, and Steve thought that he heard Tony's breath hitch.
He was going to die, and quickly.  The thought terrified him.  After all this time, it wasn't his heart that would kill him.  Just the cold and the dark that was creeping back as the small crystal lost its light.
him.  Especially not while Steve was-
"Why are you apologizing to
Steve was going to look into sulking less obviously.  "Respectfully, sir, that's none of your business."
"Sounds like Stark knew you were there the whole time," Natasha said, her voice amused.
"You'll come up?" Steve asked, a smile spreading on his face.
"Not your fault," Iron Man said again, his mechanical voice soft and reassuring.
"I will," Thor promised.  "We can only hope our armored friend will forgive us our sins against him."
"You are a hero among your people,"she continued, pausing in front of a dark ledge that she was eye-level with.  She stood up on her hind legs and pulled out a moss lantern, drawing a circle over her arm.  It reminded Tony of how people genuflect in church.
a chance?' hung in the air.  Steve really couldn't speak for the others, but he had a feeling they'd be willing to give Tony a shot.  It was too much of an empty promise though if he was wrong.
Natasha raised an eyebrow.  "I'm not going to like what you've got planned, am I?" she said, though she detailed a few general contingencies for him.
Tony raised an eyebrow but let it slide, humming softly as he pulled out his phone. Steve flushed when he realized Tony was snapping a picture of the drawing.
to fight to be useful and important.  You can do things in other ways that
"He will always be there," Wanda said, merriment in her eyes as her nostrils flared.  "But not always paying attention.  I suspect he is now because it is rare for anyone other than me to be allowed in this cavern.  If you concentrate, you can see what he is doing as well."
"You take orders from me too," Steve said, his voice soft and low.  The wind almost whisked it away, but Tony's breath caught as he heard it.
Tony felt his eyes widen.  He frowned, searching his memories.  Of course he wouldn't lose interest.  He had to pay attention to details like that, because often in temples they held warnings for traps or clues to the artifact he was after.  And the dragon history had been fascinating.  He'd pushed it off the first time as fantasy, but he'd walked along the murals many times since and hadn't given them another thought.  That was...  That was really-
"It hurt you."
"I'll keep that in mind," Tony said, this time standing up slower and with some assistance from Sharon.  It passed quickly enough, and Tony suspected a bit of food would set him to right.
, it'd be Tony, not me.  Failing doesn't make you less Captain America.  That's never been what the uniform was about."
This time, Leon couldn't help flinching.
Tony was surprised to hear Steve say that.  Wouldn't Steve prefer to work with one of the other dragons?  The ground shook violently before he had the chance to ask, however.  He flew into the air as the ground started to crumble and a massive twelve-headed creature came up from the ground.
"I'm not heartbroken," Kes said.
"Please," Steve begged.  "Let me give this to you.  The upper world needs you."
He was
"I'm sure his girlfriend appreciated it," Fury said, and it earned him a glare from Steve. "He'd have trusted you even less, Cap.  And would you have bothered to get to know
"You're not my mother!" Susan yelled, grabbing for Kor'la'vin.  To her great surprise, Kor'la'vin was there, and somehow the fingers of the armor were around her throat.  Susan must have moved, but now all she could feel was the throat she could crush so easily.
"Depends on how it's done," Tony said, though the tension in his shoulders eased at the lack of condemnation.  Very few people knew about his dalliances with men.  It wasn't respectable for an adventurer, though given his money and position in society, it was tolerated.   That didn't mean it was easy.
," Tony replied, calculating the rounds he had left verses the number of heads and knowing he didn't have enough.
"You never really said," Steve replied, wondering if he should back off.  Just because Tony didn't tell him to stop didn't mean that it wasn't pressuring him, though Tony promised to be clear if Steve did something that was too much for him.  "You don't need to.  It's fine even if you don't-"
At least with robots, as long as the civilians were kept away, no one was actually getting hurt.  It was harmless this time, far enough outside the city that even the property damage was minimal, and he focused on that instead of the way the robots fell back.
"I think it's pretty terrific," Steve said, earning him a place as Tony's favorite.  "It lets humans fly."
that feeling.  He hated it all the more for the fact it was Steve making him feel that way.  "Then get to the point," he snapped, regretting the shortness of his tone immediately, but unable to take it back.
"Be careful," Rhodey said, but did as he'd asked.
He watched as the armor enveloped Tony, and Steve reminded himself a second time.  He grabbed the tray, offering his arm to Tony once the armor was finished.  "Ready?"
"Because Iron Man isn't around and you made the very wise choice of not trusting Clint to put you in a monkey suit," Natasha said, taking his chin gently and turning his face with a soft hum.  "Clint cleans up well enough, but clothes are a means to an end for him.  You actually want to look good, date or no."
into the portal, didn't you?  He had to have some sort of tech to keep him still in the time line, but that doesn't mean it still won't get messy without him."
"So here is your warning, me Number Nine," Tony said.  "Who knows what will happen if Steve lives.  I've never been around to figure that out.  But now that we know it's coming, we can prepare for the Skrulls and the Kree.  It won't happen like Kang says.  But we...  Fuck, we've failed so many times.   I don't know if we can change it.  But you can at least bring him back into the time stream alive if you do it right.  I..."
"You're not even real," she said, trying to wipe away the tears.  "And you're not supposed to..."
Most of the page was shaded black, only enough white to see the lines of a small kitten abandoned in a box.  A tuxedo, curled in the bottom with its ears flattened, but no anger.  There was a vague hand off to the side that Steve had been tracing, but he didn't think the hand was going to help the kitten.  Now that he looked at it, the kitten's eyes reminded him a lot of Tony's.  "Just have a lot on my mind, I guess."
"The other... Oh.  About that.  Sorry.  I know I shouldn't just take off like that.  It was-"
matter, sometimes more than fighting itself."
"Lotta people think that, Cap," Clint said with a shrug.  He looked a little rough around the edges from when he'd been thrown into a rose bush, but his arms had been patched up.  "He doesn't help himself very much.  But as much as we would all agree with you, the last thing we need is a row with the catering staff."
It was nice to be home.
There was a loud roar of pain, and Tony saw...
Steve turned away from Tony and walked up to the wall, putting his fist through it.  Pain erupted in his knuckles and Tony flinched at the sound.  Ignoring the pain and Tony, Steve looked at the hole he just created.  "Clint and Natasha-"
He looked down, using the moss lamp to throw some light into the darkness.  He saw a body that most definitely matched the voice sitting in the pit, one foot stretched out in front of her.  She wore a long, dark green dress without sleeves, cinched in the middle with a black belt.  Around her neck and arms were stone snakes that Tony would take a gander and say were jade.  Her thick black hair was long and covered by a green veil.  It was too dark to see the color of her eyes, even without one of them being obscured by her hair.  "Are you alright, Miss?" he asked.
"Less chatter, more finding out what the damned Krauts want.  Keep an eye out for this 'Madame Hydra' we keep hearing about," Fury growled over the comms.
"Might have something to help with that," Tony said, thinking back to one of the early versions of the armors where he'd tried actual wings.  It ended up not being good for a frontal assault, but for someone with skills like those that Sam was bound to have, it would be both deadly and a life saver.  He could trust Sam to use them properly too.
The world was spinning when he got hit in the back, the energy of it sending him flying into the warehouse wall.  Steve groaned, but thankfully his equilibrium was returning and he brought up the shield in time to block the next attack.  It was strong, and Steve grunted as he was pushed back against the wall again.
"I know," Steve said, sending Tony the affection he craved.  It was growing weaker, but still there.
"I'll see you in two weeks then," Fury said with a nod, glancing over Steve's shoulder at what he'd been working on.  "Stark?  Really?"
"Stark is a man of contradictions," Natasha said, shaking her head.  "The drinking and the partying plus the allegations about his double dealings and Stane's death, but also housing us, upgrading our equipment for free and how he pushes the charity that pays for the damage we cause in fights.  Then there's the Iron Man suit.  What do you think, Bruce?  You've had about as much contact with him as me."
But what had...  Unless Tony liked being near the Avengers?  The thought was both cute and sobering, considering how much the Avengers took for granted when it came to Tony Stark.  Steve resolved to see this through again.  Getting through to Tony might be hard, but it was working, and Steve found that he wanted it a lot more now that he'd started to get to know him.
For a moment, Steve wasn't sure if Tony would try to pull away.  Tony seemed geared for a fight, but Steve could hold his own.  Probably.  Damn, he should have known better than to accept that drink.
Contrary to popular belief and her original purpose of spying on him, Natasha really was his favorite.
"Now who's being crude?"  Though he figured he deserved that one.  He hid the thoughts of his innuendos as quickly as he could, because with the telepathic link he wasn't sure how much got through.  His other affairs were...
"Not now, Cap," he said, diving through the Skrulls with a speed no human pilot could have survived.
Thankfully, he didn't mention it.  "JARVIS, why didn't you warn me we had a guest?"
"Tony?" Steve called out, his mental voice feeling far away.  "You coming out any time soon?"
"Tony, it's okay.  Come on, Tony.  Come out of it for me."
"When I was younger, I thought the only way to be useful was to be strong," Cap said, startling Leon out of his thoughts.  "You were right.  I became a super soldier because I needed to fight.  But I...  After James was born, I realized something.  You don't
It was a little awkward, but he found a position half-sitting and leaning against the dragon.  Steve's scales were soft and the muscle under them was hard, but not the worst sort of bed Tony had ever slept on.  And when he leaned back, he could see the cavern's ceiling high above them.  The crystal growths that hung from it reflected the soft white of the now dimmed moss.  Not quite a full moon level of light, but enough to semi-see if the building's lights were turned off.
"You complement each other."
But Cap didn't stop his movements.  Leon expected more of a reaction, and he couldn't help the words that tumbled out after that.  "I know that makes... I'm sorry, sir.  I shouldn't have -"
"Yeah," Susan said, torn between keeping hold of Kes and getting the harness ready.
Tony still didn't know where that left them.
Tony winced.  At least Steve was on the right track.  "Who says?" Tony asked, a slightly petulant tone in his voice.
Forcing his heart out of his throat, Tony leaned back against the desk.  "Come on, darling.  You know I work for the highest bidder.  I want my autonomy and access to my own suit."
But she missed any of what he tried to tell her as she flew forward, screaming.  "Don't you dare-"
Tony's body ached, but it seemed like the worst of the withdrawal symptoms were gone.  He shuddered, glad there were no cravings for more of whatever they'd had him hooked up to.  His free hand still shook a little, but he assumed the rest of the pain was just from the electric shock therapy Hydra had been giving him.  They'd probably let him out of the hospital soon, which would be great.  The sooner the fussing stopped, the better.  Then he could go down in his workshop and forget about the embarrassing way he'd reacted when he thought Steve was dead.
Tony swallowed, looking away from the camera and no doubt thinking of the previous version of him who hadn't been able to save Steve.  "Really, just don't tell him.  Or anyone else.  If this goes right, Doom is there when you hear the message, but no one else can know.  There's too many variables otherwise.  This is what
Steve pulled him back into the hug.  "You saved my life and millions of others," Steve said, closing his eyes.  "And you're trying to work out your problems.  What's not to be proud of?"
Now warm and surprisingly comfortable, Tony did so easily.
"It's an old dream," Steve said, dodging the question.
"No," Tony said, struggling to get out of Steve's grip.  This was wrong.  Steve didn't love him, he was sure of that.  He wouldn't be holding Tony down either.
And that was a mistake too, he realized.  The disapproval had just the slightest undercurrent of fondness to it.  He should have been sharper, so Tony wouldn't have taken that as a cue to continue the teasing.
"Oh, yeah?" Tony said as if considering.  "What would be in it for me?"
to do those things, when they'd been arguing.  He had wanted to take the armor off and lay into the man underneath.  And he would have if...
"Ask him to reconsider," Steve replied, more to give himself extra time as his hands moved through the familiar motions.  "I'd hate to have to replace the glass."
Steve winced, then crossed his arms over his chest.  "Those aren't the only two things I think about."
"If..." Tony started hesitantly.  "If there's anything I can do to stop it or help..."
"And the magic of this place will make sure of it," Viper said, a smile in her voice if not her face.  "It has decided you are important, and if I am near you, I can catch the same sort of ride you did when Cobra saved me from falling."
"That sounds good," Steve said, squeezing his hand.  "You can give me another dance.  I'll practice for the next time so I won't step on your feet."
"Relax, Papa Cap.  I've already got that covered."
Steve hugged him tighter, smiling broadly.  "Go on.  Get the suit and we'll surprise everyone," he said, pulling away and taking out his phone to tell Natasha to make sure everyone was there so Tony only had to do this once. Even if Tony changed his mind, it'd be nice to see the whole team.
"There is.  The magic will not show itself to you yet, however."
"Can't sleep?"
Steve sighed, resting his head on the punching bag. "It's fine. I'm pretty sure anyone else would have called me on that too," Steve said. Vision was still learning how to deal with humans, and it wasn't his fault Steve was grouchy.
It was a tight fit, but Tony managed without having to put her down.  The first inner courtyard was green and overgrown, despite the metal, and Tony spared a moment to wonder if all human buildings would end up like this one day.  All the modern marvels of the Empire State Building lost to ever merciless nature.  Maybe that was what gave him the chills.
Fear went through him as he tugged at the tentacles.  They only pulled his arms tighter.  "Steve, you've got to-"
"Well, you were
Sam laughed, the bastard. "That's a thing people have always done. Don't play that innocent kid from the 40s, Cap. It ain't gonna work on me anymore."
"Excuse you.  I'm not a bit funny.  I'm hysterical," Iron Man said, and Steve felt some of the tension dissipate.  "Now let's go.  That new uniform won't try on itself and Mr. Stark wanted to know how it moves."
," Steve promised.  "
"You're acting like this is a date," Natasha teased, reaching up to straighten his hair.
"You're awfully possessive of another man's fiancée, Dr. Banner, but I'll tell Mr. Stark she's off limits," Iron Man replied, obvious pouting in his synthesized voice.  On any other day that could have made Steve smile.  Now it just made him want to hunch over his shield more because Iron Man didn't even sound upset over their fight.  It was like he'd put it from his mind entirely.
Tony rubbed his forehead.  "I... it's alright.  I shouldn't have snapped.  I really don't mind, as long as I can see you coming."  He could brace the walls if he had warning, and that was about as good as he was getting as long as he stayed with telepathic dragons.
"It was personal," Iron Man said darkly.
It was a few days before Steve really had enough time to play around with the new device. FRIDAY directed him to a new tablet that was apparently designed specifically for drawing, unlike his normal tablet. After watching a few of the tutorials, he was starting to see why that made a difference. It was enough for him to overcome his misgivings to give it a test run.

"Only if you call me Pepper," she replied with a grin.
"It's still insane," Tony said, shaking his head.  Steve looked down, the rejection stinging.  Then Tony continued, "But it could work.  I think Iron Man can come up with a few ways to get his attention and force contact."
The red dragon turned to glare at him, sharp brown eyes holding a surprising amount of fire as she looked him straight in the eye.  "Oh, for pity's sake.
Steve Rogers was dead.
of those things that were down here.
And then Tony understood.  Steve was curious about... human things.  Tony fought down a blush, because he really had no shame when it came to sex, but going to the bathroom was different.  "It's, ah, not polite in many human societies to look," Tony said, reminding himself that this was like any of the new cultures he had visited in his travels, and even some of those had different meanings of the word 'privacy'.
Tony looked down at the cake for a long moment, then the face plate shot up, but he ate the cake rather than look up at everyone's surprised reactions.
"If I promise to come back in ten minutes, will you stop following me?" Tony asked conversationally.  He could understand paranoia, but this was a bit ridiculous.
He heard Rhodey's sigh despite the wind.  He stood next to Tony on the rail, looking out at the ocean below as they bumped shoulders.  Tony could lose himself while he tried to figure out why the color bothered him. He wished Rhodey would just leave him alone.  "There's plenty to say.  You just won't say it.  We're worried about you."
.  Too many people knowing and too many variables always cause us to fail, but him knowing..."  Tony chuckled darkly.  "A few of the other mes managed to keep Steve alive when he was pushed through the portal.  They didn't tell him anything, though they told other people.  Their Steve is still alive.  Mine isn't."
When Thor put it that way, the dancing did seem more interesting.  His eyes followed the line of the woman's arms and Steve had to admit the aesthetic was good.  Dancers did make for good models.  "Actually, I could use some advice," Steve said as he watched the woman turn gracefully on her toes.
She cried onto his shoulder, not caring if he was an AI or her however-many-great-grand-father in the flesh.  It was her code, but she had never imaged how
Christ, and Steve had still managed to drag both of them to a cave?  There were times Steve was practically inhuman when it came to his endurance.  But not inhuman enough to start a fire, at least.  That Tony could do.  "I'll get some wood to start-"
