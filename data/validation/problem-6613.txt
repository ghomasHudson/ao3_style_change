He knows his father never meant for his formula to fall into HYDRA's hands. And hell, his father had gotten into bed with Nazi scientists before that, working on the bomb, he'd probably thought it was the same thing with Zola. The ends always justified the means to Howard, Tony remembers that best of all things about his father. It didn't matter what he wrecked along the way. But to know Howard might have had a finger on the trigger the whole time, it helps, in a way. It's Machiavellian, if true, cold and calculating. It's his father, down to the inability to realize he could just let go instead of gripping tighter. It's Tony, too.
Wanda's eyes spark red and the air around them seems to tremble. "I helped make a monster of the one who made a monster out of me. He made one of his own and his creation killed my brother. I don't know what could have prevented it but I...I think about it all the time."
"Siberia," Tony grits out. "In the report. It's a pretty dull story, too. Tell us yours instead. Something about terrigen bombs." That perks everyone but Clint right the fuck up, since the Avengers as a whole are really, really on board with murdering the hell out of the people who killed dozens and mutilated Kamala.
"All my remaining limbs are intact," Bucky says, and it's so dry, so Bucky. The corner of Steve's eyes sting. "I'm fine, punk. We
He can do nothing but look at his feet and keep breathing. "Who was your favorite, kid?" he asks quietly. The Captain, he supposes, or maybe Wanda.
Jessica Jones laughs in his face as they exchange a bottle of whiskey. "I'm not a crime fighter, man. I just - I'm a private investigator. I can't -" She looks down into her glass. "I can't do that again."
"You made all this?" Kamala says instead of answering. Dummy comes barreling around a workbench and she very nearly squeals. "How many of these do you have?"
She didn’t say it out loud; she never did. At first it was out of hope that things would change, but more everyday it was out of fear. Joseph was not the same man she married. That man would have listened to her, but he died in the trench and sent back this monster wearing his face and another woman's name.
But the news doesn't get better. The terrigen gas is fatal in large quantities and those in the epicenter of the blast most likely died before inhaling a second breath. Vision only grows more despondent the further he goes but nobody is going to call it. Nobody wants to. There are hundreds in there and the Avengers can't do a thing.
"I used to watch them, always from a distance," he says as they sit at a cafe watching the sun sink. "My father took me out with him but things were not always...safe back then."
"Donnie," Tony says, wondering if everyone else can hear the thread of desperation in his voice. "I just want you to be safe."
I will not be an object of fear again, Clint." Clint's eyes snap up to stare at her in shock and she smiles grimly. "I won't let it happen to me. I won't."
Steve doesn't know how to handle that at all. Sometimes imagining Tony's forgiveness - imagining his own forgiveness to Tony - hurts too much. Steve will never back down from a fight, but that doesn't mean the scars never ache in the aftermath. And Steve is still healing from the war.
"Hey." He lays a hand on Peter's shoulder when the kid walks him to the door. "Come by the compound. Get some training in. I know the Avengers aren't your style yet, but it can't hurt."
"Did you?" Bruce snarls. "Because I don't think you did, Tony. I think you saw your chance to put things right, to redeem yourself, and you steamrolled over anyone who got in your way. I think Ross offered you a way out and you took it. The things people like you have done to people like me-"
He runs the risk of serious frostbite, but he wants to get everything back on track. So he knocks on Donnie's door, his bedroom next to the lab, and holds up the BARF regulator silently when the younger man answers.
He reaches his hands out and places his fingers on the cold stone, tapping out something that only marginally resembles
"But - you're more confident," Bucky continues. "You're better in your body. Not like you're borrowing it, like you used to act sometimes, but more like...you've always been that way. The outsides finally match what's in there, huh, Cap?"
"Right," Steve says, more thankful than he can possibly say for Sam's presence. "Stark and the rest of the Avengers are limited in what they can do. And if Fury is telling the truth, HYDRA is working overtime. We can't just sit back and let that happen. You saw what happened in Chad, Wanda. The Avengers got tangled up in the Accords and people died. If we have the ability to help, what right do we have to let our fear control us and keep our heads down while other people - people who can't do what you can - suffer? Maybe the Accords could work if we were talking about just Crossbones and Strucker, but there's more out there. Gods and monsters that can't be defeated by a set of guidelines."
"You'll be the liaison to the council. Confer with them on missions, tell them where we're most needed and where we shouldn't interfere," Tony explains again calmly.
“Tony,” I say firmly. I wait until he looks at me. “You were just a kid. You didn’t know any better.”
The two separate phones weigh on Steve like stones. He hasn't told the others about Fury's mission, about possibly leaving the country and going back to their jobs but he's sure they would jump at the chance. His line to Tony has also remained worryingly quiet, even though they saw on the news where the Avengers helped the Canadian military take down some terrorist group in northern Manitoba. He feels twenty-five again, watching Bucky get ready to ship off to war while he stayed behind, useless and weak. He hates this feeling more violently that he has ever hated anything in his life.
And further still, the defining moment of his short life: when he was six years old, he tried to hug his mother, and she dropped a tea cup to the ground. She had stepped on one of the pieces of glass before Jarvis could get to her, and her blood had smeared across the ground. Tony remembered that, bright red against white tile, the way he hurt his mother by merely existing.
"Nobody lets J Jonah Jameson do anything," Peter grumbles, but he smiles gratefully at Tony. He's a extraordinary kid, Parker, genuinely good and brave. A hero, through and through. Tony feels lucky to have met him.
"Captain Rogers," Fury says, looking him up and down before eyeballing the crowd. "And assorted company. Your Highnesses."
Thinks of his father, then, the way he'd cuff him across the ear if he heard Tony's thoughts now. Howard would say that it wasn't luck at all, that is was just how Steve was. "The best man I ever knew. Even before the serum, Steve Rogers was as good as they come." He can smell the alcohol on his father's breath across thirty years. Scotch. Stark men love their Scotch.
"Vision is on the council right now," Wanda says softly, holding her hand out to look at Hope van Dyne's Accords. "That's one of the rules, yes? One of the Avengers must always be on the council.
Tony highly doubts that. Everett Ross through a huge fit when he figured out what his favorite agent had pulled, no way the man didn't put a fatwa on her for every other agency out there. "FRIDAY, run a search on our illustrious Ms. Carter. Everyone else, poker faces at the ready."
For several seconds, Steve got to experience the unique sight of a speechless Tony Stark as the teen opened and closed his mouth and then very carefully laid down his stylus. "What?"
"What you're talking about is pure conjecture," Rhodey tells him softly, sadly. "Tones, listen to me, I know that this looks bad, but you're half out of your head right now. You just need some sleep, okay, and we can talk about this more in the morning." Tony's head is still shaking and Rhodey's voice gets firmer, slips into that dangerous territory it did when he took Tony's suit. "Say you are right, Tones, what is this gonna change? What is this gonna help except your guilty conscience?"
Bruce works on alternate ways to help Donnie, surrounding himself with dozens of brain scans while he conferences with Vision about what to do. Tony suspects he's close to a breakthrough, from the way he grows more and more nervous every time Donnie goes in, but it might not be something any of them like.
"For you, Panther King? I've got ages," Tony says flippantly, wishes desperately there was something he could prop himself up against. It's easier to fake being relaxed that way. "Hit me."
"Of course!" Peter stalks forward to catch at Tony's suit jacket, smiling cautiously as he plucks him along down the slope. "I've already told them all about you so you're gonna have to come up with something pretty crazy to impress them."
"Wimp," he accuses. Natasha shrugs. "They're going to be part of the team someday, Natasha. All I've ever known is you guys. I'm not sure I'll know what to do with new blood when the time comes."
Steve is quiet for a long moment. “You’re probably right. I just - remember things a lot differently. Sometimes I have to remind myself that it isn’t…like that anymore.”
“Oh!” Anthony exclaimed when a cask was brought in for them on orders from the king himself. “A toast!”
They move as one. They work as one. Tony has missed this more than he can say and he finds himself thinking that at least when Cap comes back Tony will give him a team to be proud of.
Tony sighs and lets himself smile. "If it doesn't, well. It'll be one of the better lies we've ever told ourselves, Fry."
Come to think of it, he might actually enjoy it, having the Avengers in his mansion, wiping away all the shit that happened there. If it didn't manage to fill like a giant violation of his parents' memory, and that - that was a big if, knowing himself like he rarely did.
"I've really outdone myself this time!" Tony declared, smiling with no small amount of smugness. A cough came from beside him, and the smile went a little sheepish. "Oh, and RocketandQuillhelpedtoo."
And there, the newest entry, waiting for all to see. Tony had seen it yesterday, and it had stopped him in his tracks. 'WE'RE WITH YOU./AVENGERS ASSEMBLE.'
Bucky was looking at him a bit strangely. "Well, it was for the good of their people, weren't it? He didn't let love get in the way of what was right. They had principles and they stuck to 'em. I like that. 'D like to think we wouldn't murder each other, though. Maybe just have a nice long sit-down about it."
Tony, still not looking, stabbed at his digital display angrily. "Can we skip this part? Okay? I know I messed up. I know I'm pushing you. I know you don't like it and you want me to stop. I - I get it. I mean, the movie nights, I'm not stopping that. People like them. But I'll leave you alone. I'll," he inhaled deeply, like he was steadying himself. "I'll be patient."
, I’ve determined the exact moment intervention is necessary.” She preened when Natasha lifted one impressed eyebrow, even if it wasn’t enough to draw her away from her sandwich. “Too early and Tony gets defensive. The fight will escalate.”
Both Cloak and Dagger have been Inhumans from a relatively young age, and Diamondback was enhanced in some way, probably similar to Natasha's extra-ordinary skills. Dagger is no walk in the park to get through, having spent three years blind after an injury acquired in a SHIELD operation. There are notes from that time period advising her handler to 'take her out' as she was a liability but the handler apparently refused; not for Dagger's sake, but for the influence she had over Cloak. The whole thing makes Steve want to hurl, so he drinks instead.
"You know I do," T'Challa says. Tony reaches out blindly, fingers tapping a beat on T'Challa's knee. It might be Debussy again, he's not sure.
"And you're on my team," Tony stresses. "I'm going to worry about you. I'm gonna want to take the blame. And I'm not entirely sure how to stop."
Sam snorts a laugh at that. “And of course you choose to take this time in the middle of an alien invasion.”
"No, thank you," Tony responds automatically. Donald's entire face crumples for a second before growing red, but Coulson steps between them before the situation can escalate.
"No," T'Challa answers, pausing on his path to the door out to the hall where he was presumably headed for some privacy. "Since we have woken him he has remained outside and aware. But he must be closely monitored at all times until the programming is removed from his mind; there are many around him I trust to do so. I rely on their judgment now." With that, he exits the room, leaving Tony alone with his thoughts.
Tony slowly nodded, but from the furrow appearing on his brow Steve could tell he didn't quite get it.
He’d thought those night had gotten better in the last few weeks. He’d thought he could maybe carve out a place here. And if he was to be honest, which he always tried to be, he knew a good portion of that was down to Tony Stark helping him find his feet. After that huge blowup over the Legion, Stark had tried, in his own backwards way, to be more understanding.
Taking a chance, he opens up the secure, Stark-approved direct messenger app that all the Avengers have on their phone.
"Not a single part of that was a request. Move it or lose it, Rogers." She flicks her hand and a shuriken is there in her palm. Steve sighs and surrenders to his fate.
For the first time, something that wasn't drenched in abject misery flashed across Stark's face. "Hey, that's got a bit of a dance to it, don't it?" His eyes, the same ones Steve saw everyday in a different face, held Steve for one last moment before Tony Stark stepped backwards into the Fog, swallowed up in an instant, a smile beginning to stretch across his face.
Big Steve shrugged. “Iron Man is part of my team. I trust him like I trust the others. And I trust him with my life.”
And they're off, barrel-rolling and hair-pinning their turns, competing for G-forces, racing around the compound and playing tag. War Machine wasn't exactly fast before but while Rhodey has better control of his legs in the suit than out of it he's much less graceful than before. Luckily for him, Tony's damn Vibranium chestplate isn't exactly built for speed either so the Machine isn't too badly outpaced.
"That is exactly the point," the king says. "If this is your father's work, fixing it will not solve the problem, Tony. You will not be able to take back the lives that have been lost. You will only be creating a more perfect version of something that should have never existed."
When was the last time he had looked back at her, the one person his eyes should always be fixed upon? Not since the War, not since
Daredevil and Peter both want masks, Luke Cage wants to be kept out of the Avengers but have mostly free reign over his neighborhood, Daredevil wants guaranteed help against the mob invading Hell's Kitchen, Peter's crossed out a request he made for financial assistance and Jessica Jones-
Not so long ago, Donnie did need Tony to do this. He couldn't be left alone in his memories or he'd just trigger himself over and over again. Tony had to go into there with him, talking him out of what he was seeing, alter the memory just enough so that Donnie's brain would reject it and therefore reject the trigger words. It didn't always work; Donnie still got switched over to Blizzard a quarter of the time, sometimes without even the entire sequence, sometimes just because of some particularly horrific memory that had nothing to do with his words at all, sometimes (the worst times) because Tony's brain would hijack the program and send them into space or into sand.
Tony watches her, that smile and the calm determination hidden in the corner of it, and knows that despite herself, nobody does 'better' better than Natasha.
Even after that, for years, Maria had been a saint, waiting and wishing and praying for things to change, but by Tony's fifth birthday, they all knew the truth. No name was coming. No name was responding. Because there was nothing in Tony to echo, nothing to finish, nothing to love.
"He saved your life," Aamir tells her sternly. Bruce is watching Tony with barely concealed pity from his place by the monitors.
“Do you remember that massive explosion that took out their entire left flank around two hours ago?”
He used to be so scared of loving Tony, because loving meant leaving. It had always felt a little like a poison, slowly eating away at him. He’s still scared; he wakes up some days and can’t get out of bed for hours at just the idea that Tony won’t smile at him if they see each other at breakfast, just like there are times when Tony won’t see him because that day he’s angry all over again at Steve and he doesn’t want it spilling out, doesn’t think it’s fair when he’s given Steve his forgiveness.
Tony exclaimed over the line, and every one listening perked up. Getting to see new StarkTech was almost worth having to sit through Tony bragging about it.
"There's my report, sir," he shoots at Fury. "You can add it to Romanov's and Barton's. Terrigen mists. Tell us so we can start negotiating with the council."
"I'm gonna sit this one out," Spider-Man garbles as he comes to an unsteady landing beside the unconcious man. There is a patch of red at his shoulder darker than he suit, bleeding through the blue. "Watch this guy for a bit, if that's okay."
"Yeah!  Uh, what did you need me for again?" Pepper tried to avert the conversation from them once again, and the brunette blinked, before nodding.
The rest of the day went on like this. Clint told him that he had to visit some friends when Tony asked to spar with him, and Rhodey excused himself saying he was getting some extra training in when Tony asked if he wanted to hang out. Even Bucky bailed on him, muttering something about being busy today. Tony was extremely confused. It almost seemed like they were avoiding him. He messed around in the lab a bit more, before the sound of footsteps made him raise his head, blinking.
"Yes, I'm back, Tony. God, I'm back, I love you." Tony could barely comprehend the cheers and clapping in the background as he watched Steve with shining eyes, beaming through his tears, and Steve couldn't help but think how beautiful he looked like this. He leaned down, kissing away Tony's tears, and it was only a moment later when Tony pawed through his pocket, fumbling for a moment before he pulled out a little black velvet box, pulling away and dropping to one knee right then and there, opening it and holding it out to Steve. Steve could hardly breathe, and everything seemed to be going in slow motion and spinning dizzyingly.
"Pepper, really, what's up with yo--" His words cut off as he looked up toward the direction where Pepper was staring at, and froze, his mouth gaping open, mouthing words soundlessly. "Oh my god." He finally spoke up, his voice a hoarse whisper, his phone dropping onto the floor with a clatter.
thinking about that—and Steve chuckles, teasingly flirting back. Still, Tony knows. It's just banter. Tony flirts with all his friends and Steve's just humoring him.
Steve took another moment or two before he groaned, realizing he was absolutely late to debriefing. He also knew that Tony had completely derailed his train of thought and that there was no way he was going to be able to focus on debriefing or his mission reports with the prospect of what Tony would do after they returned home.
Tony watches as the man subjected to his gaze remains oblivious to it, solid thumps resounding each time his taped hands make contact with the bag. He watches as Steve ducks his head low, azure eyes focused intently on one thing and one thing only, intense, unrelenting, and rapid. Steve’s hair gleams in the light, like spun gold, and Tony wonders quietly if it’s really fair for someone to be so… Perfect.
Tony could see the precise moment that Steve spotted him standing at a distance. The blond man’s eyes lit up, a wide smile appearing on his lips as it broke the neutral expression that Steve often saved for strictly professional settings. The instant Steve stepped off the quinjet and in Tony’s direction, it was like the spell that had been cast on Tony before snapped like a rubber band stretched too thin.
“I love you,” Tony murmurs softly, and Steve’s pulse drums out a reply against his mouth as he speaks into his skin.
Those three words drove fear into Tony's heart as he looked up from his project on the table to a serious Steve who had his arms crossed over his chest. Those words never brought good news. "Yeah? What is it?" Tony finally managed to spit out, and the blonde hesitated, before looking away.
“It’s- It’s not like that,” he mumbles, and Natasha’s gaze softens. He can feel the prickling lessening, that’s the only way that he knows that it  has. He takes a deep breath and looks up again, meeting her eyes. A silent conversation ensues.
Yes, if there’s anything that Tony is, it’s destructive. He’s let himself fall in love with Apollo, and now, here they were.
Tony loved the feeling of Steve’s cock in his mouth. He loved the way he could make Steve react, drinking in every moan, gasp, and shudder that the blond gave him, loved swallowing him whole and seeing Steve look down at him in awe. He loved how his husband tasted, somehow bitter and sweet at the same time, loved just how full his throat felt when he managed to suppress his gag reflex and sucked him down. A filthy, wet sound escaped as Tony pulled back and pushed on again, moaning along the way to send vibrations along Steve’s length until his breathing was cut off by the blond’s cock again.
"Oh, of course! That's fine, I just... Yeah." He murmured, giving Bruce a smile, and as he turned and left, he thought he saw a flash of ginger hair in the corner of his eyes.
He remembers when they had fought together in the Battle of New York and every other battle that they’d faced, fighting against challenge after challenge, and Steve? Steve had moved with a grace and ferocity that Tony had never seen before, sweeping through enemies without pause, his shield creating magnificent arcs that felled their opponent left and right, always returning. He fought seamlessly and without rest.
Tony made it to SHIELD, stepping into the bustling place as he strode past the busy agents that rushed here and there. All were busy and intent on completing their task, so Tony was spared from unwanted attention. The brunet knew enough about the facility to be able to make his way around without a guide. Admittedly, the reason why he’d been summoned to SHIELD was just about the furthest thing from Tony’s mind as he continued to mull over the absence of Steve, and eventually, when the genius looked up, he found that he’d made a few wrong turns and ended up unwittingly at the hangar.
“Wha- Tony, what are you- I told you, I still have work-” Surprised, Steve was only able to stumble after Tony as he protested, only to watch as the brunet found a convenient supply closet—really, it was uncanny how easily Tony could find secluded spots—and let himself be pushed into it, door clicking shut behind them.
He can feel Tony say it when he smiles and says “My Captain,” or when he playfully calls him by his name. He can feel Tony say it when he banters back and forth with Steve, pretending offense when Steve snarks him back, and he feels him say it when he snorts and rants to Steve about his day or his stupid meetings and how his board members are idiots, and he tells Steve because damn it, he needs Steve to see this from his perspective, provide input, and tell him he’s not overreacting, and though he doesn’t say it, he cares about Steve’s opinion.
Steve smiled. "You didn't ask. But raising money for veterans? Can't think of a better function for Captain America to attend. By the way, I saw your name on the banners. Thank you for doing this."
Steve decided he was going to work out as best he could in his living room. He needed, wanted to clear his head.
It took him three minutes to realize he wasn't alone. Another three minutes to get the courage to look over and see who it was. And less than sixty seconds to find himself covered in a cold sweat.
"Steve. I know this is something you, the team, should know, but he didn't want anyone to worry. He didn't want to be off the team."
"Son of a bitch," he swore under his breath at Steve's retreating back, angry with Sharon for taking Steve, angry with Steve for leaving, and most of all, angry with himself for loving a man could never love him back. Steve Rogers was an All-American national hero, he had to be 100% straight.
Tony woke up with a pounding headache and painfully dry throat. You'd think with waking up with hangovers since he was about fourteen he'd be used to it by now. Or he'd just simply learn how to keep from getting them. Old habits die hard.
Pepper Potts didn't take no for an answer. She was deathly charming when she needed to be. Tony had rubbed off on her, it would seem. The phone called ended.
"It's okay, Tony. I know. But this is really important, you know? Especially for you," She was right, of course she was right. She always was. He knew he needed to pull his head out of his ass and start paying attention. He held out his arm to Pepper and she linked her arm through his. This was his way of showing that he intended to behave. This gala was for war veterans with PTSD. He could suck it up for one night. He led Pepper to the bar and ordered himself a scotch on the rocks and a vodka martini for Pepper. After placing the order, he turned so that his back was leaned against the bar and surveyed the gala. He wasn't sure who put this on, but they did a hell of a job. He grabbed one of the programs off the bar and saw that this was a Stark Industries event. He slapped the program back down onto the bar, mentally kicking himself. Of course it was a Stark Industries sponsored event. He should have known, but what with saving the world and all that, it must have slipped his mind. He made a mental note to pay closer attention when his name was attached to something important.
"Pepper, does Tony have PTSD?" He didn't hear her footsteps anymore. Her breathing hitched. He had his answer.
"Iron Man at your service." He slid away from the cool porcelain and found some relief against the wall. He attempted to give his captain a salute. It failed miserably. "Welcome to my glamorous life, Cap." His eyes closed as his head leaned back slowly.
Tony froze, his grip on his glass dangerously tight and close to shattering the glass. Of all the people at all the galas in the world, it would have to be him to show up to this one. He, the one Tony threw everything with Pep away for. He, the one that had no fucking clue how Tony felt because there was no way in hell Tony would ever let that secret out...because if he didn't feel--
He slightly zoned out when Pepper had changed the subject, she mentioned that she was going to send Happy over to his apartment within the next few hours to drop off spare clothes for Tony and food for them both. Steve, being the whole embodiment of Captain America, turned down the food. That he was plenty stocked and could make some sort of meal for himself and Tony too if he could manage to eat.
Tony landed hard on his shoulder. The shock of pain that flew thru him did weird wonders for his hangover. Then again, pain always sobered one up pretty damn fast. He heard Steve say his name again. It's all he ever wanted. He could've burst into tears. But laughter came first.
"I'm going to mingle. You should come with me," she held out her hand for him to take, but he shook his head and took another sip of his drink.
Giving up everything for a love that may not be returned may sound stupid, but then again, Tony Stark is only a genius when it comes to book smarts.
"ANTHONY STARK, are you even listening to me? I swear, you're like a child," Pepper's angry voice cut through Tony's thoughts and broke him out of his reverie. Tony knew that tone of voice and he knew better than to crack a joke, so he put on a contrite look on his face and held up his hands in defeat.
Tony thought his insides were going to literally melt at the sight of Steve's smile. At the way the corners of his eyes crinkled when he did smile, at the way a few stray strands of blonde hair fell out of place and into his blue eyes...the eyes that Tony would give every last dollar in his fucking bank account to see him as something other than a pain in the ass...
"You go. You're much better at this than I am. I'll be fine. Go make me look good," she rolled her eyes, and he could tell she was upset with him for not making a bigger effort, but thankfully, she didn't tear him a new asshole this time. She knew he had his limits, and he was fast approaching his. He stayed at the bar for another minute or so before he saw Justin Hammer, from Hammer Industries, making his way over. Tony's lips curled in disgust and he did everything he could to keep from wretching all over the bar. The guy was like a cockroach; you couldn't kill him, he couldn't take a hint, and he kept showing up wherever he wasn't wanted. Tony could almost hear his voice and so, Tony looked for the quickest escape route. Everywhere he looked, there seemed to be something blocking his path; ex employees who wanted to prove that he didn't know what he was talking about when he let them go, old flings who just wouldn't take a goddamn hint when he didn't answer their calls the next day, and people who wanted him for one thing or another but didn't give one flying fuck about him as a person...they just wanted his name.
"Please, call me Steve. We're all friends here." At least he considered them friends. They've known each other for a good five years at this point. His heart ached for her when Tony ended their engagement. She was honestly the best thing to ever happen to Tony. They always seemed to even each other out. Peaceful. Happy.
Tony raised his glass in a silent toast to her and then took a drink. Truth be told, she deserved all the happiness in the world, and if some mystery person was giving it to her, then she could keep them hidden as long as she wanted. "Cheers, Potts."
Tony sighed as he looked out across the venue's courtyard just below the balcony. It was a warm night for Upstate New York, and it almost felt oppressive...or was that the feeling of loneliness? Honestly, he was more jealous than annoyed with Barton and Romanov. Even if they had been together for years, it was like they were still in their honeymoon phase, where they couldn't keep their hands off each other. In the year since Tony broke his engagement to Pepper, there had been more than a few flings...just warm skin and soft moans and not having to be fucking alone for the night. But nothing more than that one night. Because he still held out for the one thing, the one
The drinks were slid across the bar to him and he made sure to leave a hefty tip before handing Pepper's martini to her. He lifted his glass to her in a half-hearted toast and she clinked her glass with his. He took a swig of his scotch, appreciating the smooth burn as it made its way to his stomach. He was going to put the glass down and make small talk, but the glass stayed in his hand and he took swallow after swallow until it was gone. He signaled to the bartender for a refill, which was drained before the bartender could walk away, and made sure his glass was refilled again. Beside him, Pepper cleared her throat uncomfortably. She brought her martini to her lips before taking a dainty sip and pushing away from the bar.
, he couldn't have. He threw away everything he had with Pepper for someone that could never love him, had probably never even thought about him that way, but he couldn't stand to only give Pepper a part of his heart, not when it wasnt all of it, or hell, even the biggest part of it. That wasn't fair to her. To her credit, she had taken it well. Not that any woman wants to hear her man is in love with someone else, but she had moved on with her life, and had someone new that she seemed to be keeping in the shadows.
power couple of the technology world. Him and her, against the world, creating new technology and new weapons to assist the United States in their quest for world peace or world domination, depending on how you looked at it...but it was never meant to last, at least not Tony and Pepper. Stark Industries would always be their priority and nothing would ever change that, but their relationship took a fatal blow when Tony realized that maybe Pepper wasn't the one for him. When he realized there was someone else occupying his thoughts, when he realized he was staring a little too long at and filling his mind of fantasies of...
He took the glass. Slow sips, careful not to shock his stomach into backflips. A few minutes passed that felt like an eternity. He silently handed the glass back to Steve who, on cue, refilled it like an old pro. He handed the glass back and sat next to Tony. The urge to puke had come back, but he was determined to fight it. Purely out of whatever shattered pride he had left.
"Jesus, Pep, anyone ever tell you that your elbows are weapons of mass destruction? That fuckin' hurt," Pepper Potts rolled her eyes as she kept a brilliant, beautiful smile on her face as she waved at someone she knew. As soon she saw her acquaintance turn away, she spun around to face Tony and she launched into a lecture. For not the first time in his life, and he was sure it wouldn't be the last time, he was struck at just how beautiful she was, especially when she was in her zone as Chief Operating Officer of Stark Industries. It wasn't hard to see that she was good at her job, probably better than Tony. She took over the day to day operations once Tony revealed himself to the world as Iron Man and joined Nick Fury in his super secret boy band, The Avengers.
"I'm sorry, Steve. I shouldn't be telling you any of this, if he wants you to know anything more, he's going to have to tell you." Steve knew when he was facing a losing battle.
Steve put him back to bed. He asked Tony to rest. Tony wanted to protest, but kind eyes won out. He felt himself drifting off to much needed, even if it was unwanted, deep sleep. The last hazy thought that crossed Tony's mind was one of pure terror.
"Since he was 17?" He couldn't wrap his head around it. He could understand if Pepper had told him twenty-one, that's when Howard and Maria had died, but seventeen? "Why?"
C'mon, Cap! Crack a joke! It's fine! I'm fine." Steve's eyebrows furrowed. He couldn't stare back at those concerned eyes. The room started to spin. He needed to get out of there. In the mad dash to stand up and run out of the room Tony's equilibrium failed him and the rest of his body followed suit.
"Hey." There was a soft nudge of an elbow. "Drink this." Tony felt himself closing his eyes even tighter. He was willing, no begging, his mind just to fall asleep again. "Tony, please."
"Sorry you drew the short straw, Cap." Tony honestly didn't feel like talking but the silence was gross torture at this point. "I'm sure babysitting a grown ass man was not on your to-do list last night." He could think of one thing that probably was on that list he thought bitterly. Tony Stark never wore jealously well.
"Since Afghanistan." Steve had read that file more times than he could count. When they first met they couldn't have clashed any harder he wanted to know what made Tony Stark such an insufferable....
"I'm sorry, I should have been listening. You know how much I hate these things. I can think of so many other things I could be doing right now," Unconsciously, he pulled at his shirt collar and tie, and his fingers played at the edge of the arc reactor glowing beneath his dress shirt. Pepper saw what he did and her face softened. She reached out and put her hand on Tony's arm, squeezing it gently. She was one of the only ones that knew how bad his anxiety and PTSD was after almost dying multiple times, even without mentioning a chest full of shrapnel and a head full of bad memories that began all of this.
“Steve Rogers, I love you. I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?”
No other words had stolen his breath away from Tony more effectively than the four words Steve uttered now. The army... No. It was even more dangerous nowadays, and joining now had a good chance of death. Steve. Dead. Tony cringed away from the possibility. No. That was unacceptable.
His waist is a lot more trim than people think. For a brief moment, Tony wonders if his fingertips will almost reach if he wraps his hands around that waist. He banishes the thought before it affects him more than he’ll ever be willing to admit. Steve is a coiled spring, full of smooth power and sinuous grace. His hips are wider than one would suspect, and pardon Tony’s crass observance, but someone could bounce quarters off Steve’s ass. Tony isn’t sure he’s seen anyone with an ass as glorious as Steve’s, and he wonders again if it’s legal to be so perfect.
It doesn’t mean anything like that when Tony’s heart seems to be pounding even faster than before when they’d been giving it their all to dethrone each other.
"No, it's okay, I got it!" Pepper answered with a laugh, and the brunette nodded after a moment of hesitation and a bit of suspicion.
Tony’s tongue made flash appearances as he alternated between sucking and swirling it around the head of Steve’s length, swiping over the slit to lap after the taste of precum infiltrating his mouth, tracing teasingly over the ridges of the hard flesh. Tony didn’t look away from Steve’s flushed face once the entire time, watching as Steve panted and shuddered in his grip.
He drags in a ragged breath. A sob twists out of his throat. He should’ve been there. Steve hadn’t made it out of that mission.
The brunet swiftly turned and headed out of his lab, JARVIS shutting off the lights and locking the door behind him as Tony swept out. He intended on taking a shower and cleaning up before he went out.
Tony is leaning back on him with his tablet on his lap, back against Steve’s side, and Steve has his arm resting on Tony’s, a book in the other. He turns his head, but Tony’s completely absorbed into his work, scrolling through the tablet, and Steve just watches, his face soft and lips curled into a slight smile. He leans in, pressing his lips to a patch of skin behind Tony’s ear, and the reaction he gets is entirely unexpected but welcome.
That being said, Tony was about as equally stubborn as Steve was, and he had absolutely no intention of letting this slide. For a moment, he let his husband break his grip as if he was going to let him walk away; the brunet let another wicked smirk color his lips before he snagged Steve’s elbow in his grip, whirling him around and pulling the man straight out of the hangar and into SHIELD.
Tony finds Steve on the couch, alone, a bottle of alcohol in his hands. To say he’s surprised is an understatement, and Tony raises a brow at Steve who looks up when he hears someone coming in, giving Tony a smile and a tilt of the bottle in greeting, and the telltale pink flush on his cheeks tells Tony all that he needs to know.
Tony and Steve are touchy. There’s simply no two ways about it. They’re physically affectionate and open about it, gentle and adoring. It’s a habit, and they have no plans to stop doing it now. They kiss wherever they can reach, the cheek, the nose, the chin, the jaw, the forehead, the eyelid, the shoulder. Steve’s favorite place to kiss is just behind Tony’s ear he discovers, one lazy afternoon.
She fixes him with her pointed gaze once more, but this time, Tony doesn’t back down, meeting her eyes defiantly. She seems to cut through his feint in less than a second, speaking slowly.
“Damn SHIELD, too old for this,” Tony groused out finally, drawing himself up to full height as he turned, waving a hand. “Tell them I’ll be there in about an hour, J,” he added, pressing his lips into a thin line.
Steve has long legs. The first time Tony noticed was when he watched Steve outrun Sam and Rhodey one day, laughter bright in his eyes and lips. His thighs are filled out, and it’s no wonder that every bit of his body is hard and muscled. The peak of human perfection, like Aphrodite herself has blessed him. There’s no other way to put it. He’s like… He’s like Apollo. Tony starts for a moment at his own mind but then smiles ruefully at how true that is.
“God, Tony-” He murmured out in a low voice, sounding already wrecked as another moan jerked from his lips, feeling something slick and hot lap over the column of his throat. The slightest scrape of teeth grazing his pulse point caused Steve’s eyes to flutter shut as his hips jerked up into Tony’s hands, the other's callused thumbs rubbing circles over the bare skin of Steve’s hip bones.
Things fall apart around him. In a moment or two, everything just collapses. He falls through the ice. He is pushed off the cliff. He knows exactly what she’s talking about. Who is he kidding? Everything just… Slides into place. Tony is centered. He knows, he knows, and he’s always known. Natasha knows exactly when everything clicks, a small smile appearing on her lips.
He doesn’t remember closing his eyes. He painstakingly wrenches them open, and it’s like there’s glass behind his eyelids. Everything is blurry. He can’t stop shaking. He thinks for a brief moment, maybe this is hell. Something hot slides down his cheeks and suddenly, his vision comes into focus.
Within moments, Tony’s assumption was proved correct as a quinjet came rolling into the hangar. The brunet watched with mild interest as the aircraft came to a smooth stop, orders being shouted left and right as all systems came to a stop. He continued to keep his gaze fixated on the quinjet for a moment or two before he began to turn away, about to maneuver his way to Fury’s office when something he glimpsed in the corner of his eye caused him to freeze; Tony whirled around, his brown eyes wide as his heart lurched in his chest and nearly jumped to his throat.
It’s moments like these that Tony is in awe. Steve Rogers is a force to be reckoned with, unstoppable and unending. He is, simply put, a force of nature.
After he’d left, a mere ten minutes later, Tony had suddenly felt a wave of exhaustion unlike any other that he’d felt, and so, he’d slept, sprawled over the couch, though the last flitting thoughts in his mind had been of how close Steve had been and how warm and electrifying his touch had been. He’d awoken to his headache gone, reinvigorated and more inspired than he had been in a while.
"Trust me, Tony, you won't regret it." She merely grinned at him, and it made him narrow her eyes. What was going on? He huffed, and ran his fingers through his hair.
“Good. Because I did too,” Tony murmurs, reaching over to fit his fingers against the nape of Steve’s neck, tugging him back, and Steve comes willingly with another small noise, and they’re kissing again.
Steve’s rational side was quickly being stripped from him as he began to have trouble even reminding himself to breathe around the toe-curling kiss, suddenly hyper-aware of the places where their bodies intersected, Tony’s body pressed against Steve’s in one, hot line. Steve’s hands instinctively flew up onto the other man’s shoulders, gripping tightly in an effort to anchor himself, failing miserably in the end. Eventually, the blond gave up entirely on thinking about anything at all, allowing himself to be swept up in the throes of lust that broke over his head, a burning fire scorching just under his skin.
"Just... Just promise you'll be careful?" The brunette whispered, and Steve nodded, pulling back, kissing Tony lightly.
Of course, later, he finds out, he is not Icarus who plummets to earth with the words "just once" on his lips. Later, he finds out that they can craft their own take of Apollo and Icarus when Steve asks him to go for dinner and kisses him sweetly. Tony realizes that he can keep him.
"Hey, I need to get the lube." Steve whined softly before he let him go, and Tony quickly pulled open the dresser drawer, scooping out the lube and popping off the cap with a soft
Tony found the sight extremely edible, humming as he ducked closer once again, feeling Steve’s beard scrape over his lips as he followed the line of the blond’s jaw to the spot of skin just under Steve’s ear, letting his hot breath filter over the skin there. The genius heard the slightest hitch of his husband’s breath, followed by a gasp of air and a moan the instant Tony’s lips and teeth closed around the line of Steve’s neck.
"Pepper was just asking me to teach her some self-defense." Nat answered smoothly, but Pepper nodded too vigorously for it not to be a lie, and sounded too relieved and eager.
Yes, he thinks, his gaze trained on the backside of a certain blond man punching away at a reinforced sandbag. When it comes to self-destructive tendencies, he is absolutely the number one man to go to.
Through the opened doors of the jet, a familiar silhouette appeared. Tony focused on that silhouette, not even realizing that he was holding his breath, all his senses narrowing on that one individual. When the man finally turned in Tony’s direction, the brunet couldn’t help the delighted laugh that left his lips, a strong wave of elation surging through him.
His name sounds delicate on her tongue, suddenly. It feels as if he is on a very, very thin sheet of ice, already cracking and breaking, and the weight of his name is only causing it to break faster and faster. His fingers tighten, curling into his pants, holding his breath. He only has a moment to think helplessly that there is no going back from this before Natasha nudges him.
"Tony, look up." She muttered quietly, and with a sigh, the brunette reluctantly tugged his gaze from his phone, dragging his eyes to Pepper's face.
The blond had the gall to laugh at Tony’s disgruntled expression, shaking his head. “Tony, not now. I still have debrief and mission reports to type up. I’m still on duty, you know that as well as I do. I’ll see you at home,” Steve answered, reaching up to gently tug free from the brunet’s grip on him.
It doesn’t mean anything like that when Tony comes down to the gym with Steve when he looks more worn down than usual and ends up going a couple of rounds with him, which usually ends with him flat on his back, slick with sweat, and panting while Steve has forgotten all about what was bugging him, grinning as he pins him down.
Tony gave an indignant sound as he was pried loose from his husband, eyes narrowed in what was almost a glare. Of course, it wasn’t as if Tony had expected any different; Steve was nothing if not devoted to his work and stubborn to boot, it was one of the many qualities he and Steve shared and something that he admired to an extent.
Tony pulled back to place a sloppy wet kiss on the head of Steve’s cock, thick lashes framing his smoldering dark eyes full of hunger as he blinked slowly, letting them brush over the tops of his cheeks as he watched the blond; it was in that moment Steve broke.
Tony purposefully searches out things that he thinks will make Steve laugh or smile, finding Steve little snippets of the past after hearing him murmur a soft complaint that he wishes he had an older radio. Tony finds an old radio and repurposes it to function as it would have back in the old days but much better, and it finds its way quietly settled next to the bedside table of Steve’s room. It doesn’t mean anything romantically, they’re friends and it’s only natural that Tony wants Steve happy. Steve deserves it more than anyone, and he always looks best when he's smiling. It makes Tony feel accomplished every time he sees the man laugh, and it's especially worth it when Steve thanks him later, practically beaming with joy and radiating contentment.
He cares for Steve. They’re close, Steve is important to him and just because Tony feels his heart cave in on itself every time Steve looks up with his glassy blue eyes, that doesn’t mean that Tony has emotions he’s not facing because he doesn’t know how Steve will react. Still, Tony stays, sitting next to him without a word. Sometimes, they talk. They talk about anything and everything. Sometimes, Steve tells him what’s bothering him, other times, he doesn’t. Tony doesn’t push, but he nudges and coaxes when he feels he needs to. After a while, Steve leans in to brush their shoulders together, and when he cracks a feeble joke about how this has become a usual occurrence, Tony knows that he’s going to be okay. Other times, Tony leaves the plate of food and water and leaves him be because Steve doesn’t look up when he comes in, and that means he just needs some peace before he bounces back.
“Is it about Steve?” The brunet blurted out, and the unsteady lurch of his heart in that moment made him feel as if he’d be sick.
. It can't last for long; it never did before. Those two can't bear to be wrong. They'll find something else to fight about and their sidekicks will pick sides and everything will be wonderful again."
"No one's asking you to be me, I'm just asking for you to not let your colossal ego get yourself or somebody else killed because you decided you'd rather play around with experimental tech. You were talking about
as her only child shivered and shook through his illnesses. She held him through every one. She had sat at the side of dozens of deathbeds in that little room, only to wake and start anew. And she’d happily do it again, a thousand times more. Steve was her son.
"I'm fine," he says firmly, finalizing his purchase on his tablet. Sixteen tickets to Phantom of the Opera, spread out from front row seats for the Khans to private boxes for Vision and Bruce. And the last two, he sends to an email address that he's been avoiding for almost a month now.
T'Challa's too busy to lend a hand, so all four of them pack into a quinjet and head overseas. Natasha debriefs them once again and then as one they turn to Tony. "What?" he asks, and Vision inclines his head with an unspoken question.
I don't normally ask this, but please be kind in the comments this go round. It's been a long time since I've written this, and that's on me, but I kinda had a rough time getting back into it. Criticism is welcome, just be gentle with my poor soul.
Peter always thinks he can do better. He's, maybe, a bit too much like Tony for that to always be a good thing, but he's himself most of all, and that will see him through.
Natasha smiles like her face doesn't remember how to and Tony, just a little bit, lets go. Lets it settle. He doesn't trust her. He doesn't even think Natasha trusts herself, and that's why he votes yes on her reinstatement as well.
"Who are you when you're not weighed down by the guilt, the anger?" He can hear his father but he can't see him, can't turn away from the delicate working happening underneath his hands. "Where will you go without it to keep you on the ground?"
have done better as team leader...but he could have, too. He'd had a responsibility, and he failed utterly. Tony learns from his mistakes.
His wife didn't know about his present. Nobody did. Reaching inside his breast pocket, he pulled out the pamphlet and handed it over to Obie, who just barely glanced at it before doing a double-take.
Steve’s life wouldn’t take the path hers had, she would make sure of it. She smiled at him. “Yours, and no other’s, my love. God has already determined that you’re meant for him. Most soulmates have to wait years more, but not you two. You’re special, Steve. Didn’t I always tell you so?”
The sun sunk below the edge of the Time Fog, cloaking the grey-purple mist in darkness and warping the whirls and eddies into indistinct shapes. Tony reached out, running his fingers through it, feeling the familiar electric tingle of pure – and unknown – energy.
They grin at each other and it's the first time Sharon's face actually seems to match her emotions. Tony feels his own smile drop. "What's Lukin about, Sharon? Tell me the truth."
He watches his dad die all over again before Natasha can tell FRIDAY to shut it down. There is not a sound to be heard in the room. Clint is covering his children's eyes and his face is unreadable in the darkness while his wife stares at the dead screen in horror. Vision is quiet at Tony's shoulder and there is a hand on Tony, solid, realer than anything else so Rhodey is there too.
He looks up, encounters the curious glint in Barnes' eye, and slides his gaze to the side. "Well, I figure, hey, I can't nearly kill a man in a misguided attempt at justice and then not bring the same effort when it comes to the real bad guys. That's just lazy." He aims a half-hearted smile at Barnes that is met with nothing but silence and stoicism. A cold sort of patience that runs straight up his spine and sets his nerves tingling. Tony changes tact. "The truth is that we need you."
"They're good, Tony," the kid answers, eyes on the tablet. Vision could do this job just as easily but Tony hates the idea of a mind like Donnie's going to waste. Plus, he's the only other engineer in the building, at least for something actually relevant,
Tony thinks of Steve's drawing, burning a hole in his pocket, the Avengers' circling the earth. Steve had seen it. Of course he did. Kamala and Peter are each a thousand times worth more than Tony, but they are still accidental heroes, like himself, giving of themselves because circumstances made it so they could. But there are people out there just like that scrappy little slip from Brooklyn, who just wanted to stop bullies. No one, not even Steve's own body, could stop that kid, and Tony doesn't imagine the world could do any better against his twenty-first century equivalents.
"It was just me and her, Tony. She was concerned." He felt Steve watching him. It's all he ever wanted but not like this.
Tony had been out for nearly two hours since the bathroom incident. Steve wondered if Tony even realized how early it had been. Did he even realize that he wasn't at his own house? Pepper stirred him out of his thoughts.
"And he's had an appointment every other month since he was 17." Her words hit him like a sack of bricks.
"Captain Rogers!" Steve could tell she was trying to sound as awake as she could, but the gentle yawn she let out gave her away. Did he hear rustling in the background?
"Steve, he's gone to a therapist when it's humanly possible every two weeks for the last six years...."
Tony never really thought of himself as a lucky man. He let out a sigh as another ass kisser from the Department of Defense walked away, confident that the DoD would own his soul for the rest of eternity, which earned him a sharp elbow to his ribs. Coughing and rubbing his side, he turned to glare at the owner of elbow.
Steve came quietly to his side, giving him a careful once over. Soldier's fingers nimbly checking off all possible places of injury, carefully rolling him onto his back. Steve asked him to sit up. He managed well enough. Captain America helped him to his feet. He swore he didn't try to fight it. Tony found himself burying his face into Steve's neck. It's all he ever wanted.
The living room was calm and still, the sun slowly starting to filter through the windows. Steve Rogers could usually count on peaceful mornings.
"Ah, it's a good cause. I'm happy to do it. Besides, I'm pretty sure it was Pepper's idea. She's the one that makes us look good," Steve laughed and then clapped his hand on Tony's shoulder in a friendly manner that made Tony very hyper aware of the close proximity of Steve's body, and suddenly, that feeling of not being able to breathe was back. This time, though, the feeling was almost welcomed. Steve opened his mouth to say something but was interrupted when Sharon Carter slipped her hand in his free hand and tugged him towards the main ballroom. He just grinned at Tony and just shrugged, letting himself be led away, leaving Tony alone with his thoughts again.
Tony Stark wasn't a stranger to this game, especially when it came to charity galas. Decades of ass kissing and having his ass kissed in return made it damn easy to play his role without thinking. Shake a few hands, kiss a few cheeks, a couple of "you're looking well, call me, we'll do lunch," and he'd have his freedom for the rest of the night. Maybe. If he was lucky.
He could see Hammer getting closer and the room definitely felt like it was getting smaller. The tightness in his chest and the sweat forming on the back of his neck let him know that the panic attack was inbound, and he better get out of there if he wanted to head it off. God, if only he had the Iron Man suit. This would be so much easier, but Pepper had a rule about not bringing it to galas. Said it wasn't the right place for it. His eyes scanned the room as it got harder to breathe and he finally found his escape. One of the stairways leading to the balcony was clear, so with his drink in hand, he made his break for it. Walking as fast as humanly possible and dodging people like they were his captors in Afghanistan, he somehow made it to the stairs and up to the balcony without being trapped by anyone and his drink intact. He walked over to the railing of the balcony, paying no attention to the other attendees there with him, although he was pretty sure he just passed Clint Barton and Natasha Romanov, Hawkeye and Black Widow respectively, in an assassin makeout in a darkened corner. If they were trying to hide it, they were doing a shitty job of it, just like the did every night in the compound, when one would sneak into the other's room and nobody in a 50 foot radius would get any sleep until they both burned off whatever horny energy they had for each other. Tony made a note to have JARVIS sound an intruder alarm the next time he saw Barton going to Romanov's room, just to see their faces when they realized that it would be a false alarm. But at least seeing them in the corner successfully distracted him from the panic attack, so that was something.
"That, I am afraid I cannot do," he says instead, sending the memo off to Human Resources. "I need you, Jenny Wan Kenobi. You're my - I mean, you're not my only hope, but damn, lady, you are pretty damn close."
“And it’ll be mine?” Steve looked to her for reassurance, and she thought of all the fights he had gotten in at school when someone dared remark on the name on his father’s other wrist.
Tony watches the TV switch to talking heads, 'NO SAY NO STAKES SAYS STARK' writ bold near the bottom, just like he predicted. "Truth?" Hopes makes a gesture as if that should be obvious. "Forever. We're making headway with the Accords now, but when the next disaster happens, and it will happen, the Council and the public will panic; either because we take too long to respond or because they feel our presence made a bad situation worse. We go back to the drawing board, we do it all over again. It never gets solved, not really."
"You tried so hard to save him, Tony, but I wouldn't feel too bad that you failed. Rhodey's used to you disappointing him."
Tony rubs at his chest and the bridge of his nose simultaneously, nodding. He does. He'd put his life in Nat's hands any day, and he'd place his soul in Rhodey's without hesitation. But there are parts of him that he has to keep safe, parts where he can't let anyone reach anymore. He let Steve in there, and he didn't even realize it. Followed the man proudly on the field, admired the hell out of him off of it. There was nothing Rogers could do that would convince Tony to leave his side. Until there was.
"No," Steve said, swinging his shield off his back. "Right now I could really do with a good fight." With that he stomped off in the opposite direction from where Tony had flown. The girls watched him walk away silently.
“…I am,” Steve admitted, and Tony looked up in shock. “My Tony and I have clashed more than once, believe me. Stubborn is a quality we both share.” Steve gave him a meaningful look there and Tony found himself flushing a bit. “But when I first came out of the ice, he was the one who helped me find my feet. I can’t tell you how lost I was before that. How lost your Steve probably feels. Be patient with him, Tony. He’s clinging to his old life, his old ways, and that will serve him well in some areas, but in others – well, I can tell you that I’m still learning myself.”
“I don’t know if I can-” Tony cuts himself off, and Steve’s arms move until big hands are cupping, wrapping around his own.
"Thinking about it," Rhodey answers. He is currently pouring over the codes for the new AI Tony has built for War Machine. He mutters out of the side of his mouth, "We are not naming her JOCASTA."
Tony dreams that night of burning pianos and Bucky Barnes' hand on his neck, his team behind glass he can't break, Steve and the shield and he dies and he dies and he dies.
"I'm going to go down to my lab," Tony announces hoarsely, grabbing up the phone. "I'm going to smash this with a hammer."
"But I can also see why they're a good idea. The Avengers were all over the place and the one time we got any official word from them was Agent Romanov telling Congress to fuck off after she and Captain America dropped three flying aircraft carriers into the Potomac. That...wasn't very reassuring. If I'm going to do this, I have to do this right. I don't want people to be afraid of me or the suit my mother wore."
I steer Tony away from bars and he steers me away from the cliff I’ve been threatening to jump off of for almost ten years. We hang on to each other instead.
I have been informed many times. I know it to be true. The fact that even one person survived the initial attack was a miracle.
me." He fires, sending the green man careening backwards. War Machine knocks him even further away on his fly-by, coming to hover a few inches above the ground and holding out his arm as his faceplate snaps up.
"Better years?" Wanda guesses, scoffing half-heartedly. They're both too tired for the roles they need to play right now. Or maybe they no longer know their lines.
“Oh ye of incredibly biased faith,” Natasha muttered, but it was lost to the sound of Steve’s yell cutting loud and clear through the air.
"As I was saying, Mr. Stark, Colonel Rhodes has been on leave but he's more than welcome to come take his place with the Air Force once again. War Machine is capable of taking on missions an ordinary pilot cannot. His presence has been missed."
"And what about you, Your Pantherosity? Can't be easy, running a country while you Avenge and harbor fugitives on the side." There is a pointed silence in the hall and Tony looks up at T'Challa's impassive face. "Oh, sorry, are we still supposed to be pretending Cap and Company aren't kipping out under the Wakandan stars, buddy? My bad."
There's an innuendo in there. There's always an innuendo in there with her. "Diamond," he grits out, pushing past her. Inside the vault is the computer banks Fury was hoping they'd find when they sent them out on this mission, but no sign of the way Madama Hydra has escaped. "My experience with HYDRA-"
He dreams that night, of the bunker in Siberia. Bucky Barnes is missing an arm and Steve is above him, shield in both hands.
Jan stood up, ready to head Tony and any of his tears off, but she paused, looking down at the table. “You had all better show up for that movie tonight!” She hissed, and then flitted across the quad to where Tony stood, staring down at his hand.
"You said I'm pretty," Tony pointed out, half-cocky, half-terrified. Gamora, far too used to Starlord to ever be thrown off guard by Tony Stark, merely rolled her eyes.
he didn’t ask at the hospital, because he already knew the answer. Same reason he gave his address to a terrorist, probably, or the reason why he sometimes sees himself steering towards the ground when he’s flying the suit. You
Steve slides the phone off of T'Challa's copy of the Accords and tugs them closer to him. There are three logos on the first page: the giant 'SA' on top, the UN's globe to the left, and the arrow-A of the Avengers to the right. "But who decides if the action was unconscionable and/or reckless? The council. And who's to stop their egos and agendas from finding us guilty?"
“I built the Legion to help us. We can’t be everywhere. I mean, not all of us are one-man armies like some people.”
Steve nods. "We were honored to have you, Ant Man." He rises and offers a hand that Scott takes with a shaky smile and a weak grip. He exchanges a one armed hug with Sam and turns towards Wanda.
No, it doesn’t make his heart ache with an indecipherable emotion when one day Tony meanders into the kitchen with no purpose after starting awake for the third time that night and pacing for quite a bit. He finds Steve already there with a cup of chamomile tea and honey, another cup of black tea with a splash of milk and three cubes of sugar waiting for Tony across from him.
He’d been in denial long enough. He’d hoped to remain in that state, but damn. Natasha never let things go his way.
Tony felt Steve coming down his throat, waited patiently for a moment or two until his lungs began to burn, carefully pulling his fingers out of Steve as he inched back, sucking gently to clean off the softening cock. Giving the head one last lick, Tony pulled off of Steve completely, the bitter taste of his husband’s cum lingering. He looked up to meet Steve’s hazy blue eyes as he leaned back on his heels, lifting a hand to wipe the dribbles of cum he hadn’t managed to swallow off with his thumb. He smirked, tongue flickering out to lick the remains.
It doesn’t mean anything like that when Steve comes down to the lab with a sketchbook in hand, and for some reason, joins Tony and sits on the couch sketching and drawing whatever comes to his mind. It’s a comfortable silence and Tony often just falls into the mechanics of whatever he’s working on, and sometimes, he switches playlists to songs that he knows that Steve enjoys.
He leans in close and tells Tony to concede, and Tony only gasps out a no before going completely limp and causing Steve some alarm, his guard down and grip loosening—and then Tony strikes. He suddenly throws his weight upwards and derails Steve, and even though he ends up getting pinned again, he holds his own wrestling and grappling for purchase with Steve for around two minutes and he’s damn proud of it. He tells him as much and Steve laughs as Tony sighs and concedes Steve's victory.
“There’s no mention of Captain Rogers, sir,” his AI’s voice spoke once again, causing Tony to give a sigh as his shoulders slumped, the wave of both disappointment and relief causing quite the contrast in his emotions.
The sensation of Tony’s mouth on Steve was enough to drive the blond half out of his mind, though what happened next made what was left of his higher brain functions completely shut down. The first brush of slick fingers teasing at Steve’s rim elicited a startled high-pitched whine from him as he jerked away only to be eased back into place by Tony’s hand curled around his hip. Steve watched with wide eyes, pupils blown with desire and jaw slack, lips parted into a small ‘o’.
The god of prophecy had told him that he’d fall in love since the moment that he’d seen Steve smile. The god of truth tells him now that he is in love every time his heart dances when he even sees a glimpse of him.
"Alright, Pep." He answered with a nod, and left, going down to the lab for a while. He was tinkering with a project on the table, looking through blueprints, before he looked up, heading back up to look for Bruce, and he finally found him in the kitchen. "Hey, Bruce! You busy? I found this really--"
Tony’s favorite place to kiss Steve is his wrist. He soon discovers this when Steve reaches up to curl a hand around his cheek one early morning in bed as a greeting, thumb brushing over Tony’s cheek, and he’s sighing, leaning into the hand, eyes closing, and then... He feels a shudder. His eyes open and he looks at Steve, who’s a bit flushed, and Tony blinks. He exhales softly again, and there’s the tremble again. He soon realizes what the cause is.
"O-Oh my g-god, Steve." He managed to stammer out, pulling away, a hysterical laugh bubbling up before Steve smiled again, his own eyes filling with tears, and Tony pressed in, pulling him down into a harsh kiss, refusing to let go, almost like he was fusing their bodies together, and Steve returned the kiss, a wave of emotion rising from the pit of his stomach, and it felt like it was going to break him open, to little bits. Tony never wanted to pull away, but he did, pressing their foreheads together, breathing hard, a hand sliding up to press into Steve's cheek, his thumb stroking over his cheekbone. "Y-You're here... O-Oh my god, y-you're back..." He sobbed again, and the blonde nodded, leaning down to press another soft kiss into his mouth, swallowing Tony's I-love-you's and I-missed-you's, sliding a hand over Tony's on his cheek, steadying the trembling.
