Loki began to suspect that he no longer cared about Bucky's darkness either because, for the role they had in each other's lives, it was better if neither of them knew the details.
"I'm not talking about Nat," Barnes, however, only snorted. "But rather, someone whom you haven't considered before because you're homophobic-"
"Humans call them doctors, and I'm one."
"You aren't. I'm neither."
"Yes," Quill said, if not for his sake, then trying to get Rocket to wise up and go away before anyone noticed.
In other words: it could not be simulated. Therefore, it was a worthy enough challenge to keep his mind on when he didn't want to think about what he lost.
"I'm sorry, it's just... you called me Steve."
"Which means our best chance is to try play by her rules, get out, and only try to kill each other after she had this protocol deactivated," Bucky tried to point out.
But that effort paled in comparison to what Tony had been doing. SI was one of the major coordinating forces when all the world could have just collapsed into complete disorder.
"Let me try see if I remember yours."
Steve liked the older Stark originally, working with him, but he also knew the scientist started drinking more and more as he aged, and after the story, he was almost glad Howard was gone.
"Come in," Loki put down his book and stood to greet yet another villager, except it wasn't.
“No, of course not, I just-“
"Oh?"
"Why don't you bring him back for dinner first, and let me talk to him before I never see you two again?"
"But I do!" Bruce told him with some force. "I don't want to lose another teammate now, but especially not after Nat..."
"I've told you to keep the fucking phone! Maybe Ronan is right, and you deserve what's coming to you if you can't even accept it when people are trying to do something for you!"
, but correct me if I'm wrong," Tony looked at him pointedly, as if angry.
"Don't you dare to touch my daughter." He didn't mean to supply the last part of information out loud, but it was too late.
"I'm not feeling well, and I've heard I can get some help here."
It was a nice surprise when the door accepted Steve's code to Tony's workshop, letting him in, but then again, Tony was good at pretending. Exactly as if nothing happened.
"Not sure if I'm helping him by keeping him so close," Steve had a specific reason why he was telling Tony that, but only as he said it did he realize it was also more true than he first thought.
"Even under normal circumstances, there's no way to predict how a non-mutant human would react to a transfusion from you, Steve. It's possible it would only harm him. Not to mention, you're in no shape to give blood to anybody, I think you're bleeding internally..."
Why ruin everything with complications, right?
"Leave? I wanna murder you nine ways before Sunday, but I'm not gonna let you fucking leave," Tony told him. "If what the Doc said was true, I'm the only thing that's keeping you alive now."
"That was only payback. If you want more, you'd have to come to us and use words."
"Don't push your luck," Loki was also smiling. "And besides, wherever would we meet?"
"Wait," Bruce stopped him when Loki told the Avengers everything they needed to hear, and everyone scattered with no time to waste, understanding the seriousness of the situation perfectly well without Loki going into further details. "You remember that you asked me what would I do if I knew the world was ending in a day, and I didn't have much time?"
Ronan in this fic is a bully not holding back, so please be warned.
"Like with a joke, maybe there's only a connection you see," Vision agreed. "But if it wasn't me, someone else would have to die. If not for the feelings I felt for Wanda first, I'd probably just a machine, not a worthy exchange for a Stone. And if not for losing the Mind Stone, I wouldn't know how much of a gift it was that I could still save billions of people by doing this. For me, it all adds up."
"Okay."
because that wasn't how things were any longer.
On another day, in different circumstances, Tony Stark would have been all over that comment like a bad case of crotch crickets. But this was now, and this was Steve, and Tony's heart was breaking.
"Yeah?"
Steve's eyes were suddenly unbelievably bright. "Great." He leaned down and lifted the shield. "Soon."
"Let me handle it." The words were out of Tony's mouth before he knew what he was saying. As Dr Archbold's perfect eyebrow neared her hairline, he held up his hands. "Not
Tony twisted a little in the driver's seat, releasing himself from the safety belt. Steve's eyes remained locked forward.
With another smile, he was gone. Steve moved his hands from his lap to crush into the edge of the mattress. It gave way like putty under his fingers. Tony was so good and kind and understanding. Guilt at all the judgement Steve had thrown his way washed over him in waves. It was never that Steve had actually looked down on him. It was because he thought so much of him.
Within 48 hours, S.H.I.E.L.D medical was happy to release Steve into the care of his next of kin.
," even though he didn't mean it anymore. Steve wasn't as asshole. He was hurting.
? But Tony was striding to the door. "I'll have some of your stuff brought up. That okay?"
Emboldened by strength or sleep-deprivation, either could have been the case, Tony twined his fingers in Steve's and worked them loose. His nail beds shone pale in the dim light.
Maybe it
"Thank you for telling me."
"You okay, Steve?"
When he slipped inside and shut the door, he leaned against its smooth surface.
The words could have been harsh, but Tony kept his tone deliberately gentle. When Steve made no move to get out of the car, Tony circled around to open the door for him. When Steve accepted the hand he offered, Tony noted it was trembling.
Steve managed to look up. "What do people, y'know, call it? Any terms I know were pejorative and awful to hear even seventy years ago. I hope there are better words now."
Tony didn't want the information. The hamster didn't want the information. Yet there it was, and that asshole Steve had made him his next of kin, meaning this was now, in part, Tony's problem.
"Pfft," Tony said, waving the compliment off. He stepped in behind Steve and crossed to the windows. "I'm doing basically nothing. Jarvis? Increase window tint by, oh, forty percent."
Steve's fingers twitched at the thought of a blade, and his legs trembled under the weight of the day.
Except the shield, of course, but that was a given.
!" crashed through Tony's memory, he was doubly glad for his current sobriety. Maybe it was fate that he was clear-headed enough to help when Steve needed it. Or maybe it was just fate. Whatever the reason, it was serendipity.
off into a new dimension.
After Tony dropped into one of the seats across from her desk, there was a long moment. A
Tony nearly blurted the question out loud, but there was no point. How could the good doctor know, considering before this incident she'd never even met Steve?
As they spoke, Steve's fingers pressed harder into his sweats until Tony swore he saw the fabric fraying. He reached out to lay his hands on Steve's.
He wasn't sure whether Tony's response was real or not. But in his head or out loud, it was beautiful.
Steve's monosyllabic reply was a simple, "Sure," and that was it.
young. He might have been born in 1918, but the ice had hit the pause button on his life and Tony suddenly felt very old and very responsible.
Clobbered: to have a crush on.
Steve's well enough to leave. Tony wishes he wasn't going.
"Hey, it's okay. Can you hear me, buddy?"
The scene was so heartbreaking all Tony could do was blurt out, "Your carriage awaits."
All Tony could think about was reaching out taking Steve's face in his hands, and planting the softest kiss in the history of kisses on his lips.
Something strange happened the moment he crossed the threshold. Vulnerable Steve stayed behind and Captain America walked through the door. He thanked the medical staff and shared his easy smile. His chin stayed high, his back remained straight, and it was as if nothing had happened and there were no perfectly straight lines cut into the inside of his thigh.
He guided Steve's head back into a more comfortable position and resumed his electric tingling touches.
Suddenly Steve lost control of his mouth again.
Tony cocked his head and glanced down, his face set with a wry smile. "Thanks. Some days I believe that and some days I don't."
His voice was obnoxiously loud even to his own ears. When Steve jumped right to his feet, eyes saucer-round with fright, Tony's stomach clenched more. Idiot. Some
"Italian?" Steve manages around another mouthful.
But no. He was just being an Able Grable, getting all hot under the collar for the first guy to show him any kindness. It wasn't fair to expect that of Tony. It wasn't respectful.
Something twigged inside him at that revelation. A lot of things were in the past, and the only one who was dragging them into the present was Steve himself.
"No, no," Tony said, keeping the words light, "you should totally stay. It'll be nice to have a guest actually use the guest room."
Captain America would ever harm himself. Did not compute. Nope. Couldn't be true.
"I don't think either of us are regular 21st Century fellas," he said. "Is it making you feel better?"
It all started with a falling building and a name on a form, but it had become a comfort and something beyond the legal definition of next of kin. Steve had become a welcome presence in his home, a friend in the spare bedroom, his head a reassuring weight on Tony's lap in the night. Sure, Tony had been more than happy to help Steve through his troubles, but there was more to it. As with everything he did, Tony knew there was an element of self-interest there too.
Now it was Tony who turned to examine the windshield. There were a few light convex lines left from the wiper blades wearing out. He'd need to get those changed.
Tony's hands stilled on his head. "How do you feel about that?"
Standing, Tony slipped his hands into his pockets and smiled that easy smile again.
Tony pushed himself upright again and tapped the frame with his knuckles. "You like Italian food?"
Dr Archbold pursed her lips and nodded. "It's true. I wasn't sure if you were aware or not."
"You're okay, Steve," Tony went on. "You're in S.H.I.E.L.D medical. In the battle of Midtown Building Versus Captain America, you won."
So when Tony found himself inside the threshold of his penthouse with Steve now standing on the outside, a backpack of meagre possessions slung on his back and the shield leaning against the door jamb, the grief was palpable.
"Absolutely."
he? If Steve was willing to put him down as next of kin, why wasn't he willing to let Tony
words thing. What he could do, however, was rustle up some comfort food, and rustle up he did.
Steve looked up with those liquid ocean eyes and damn but they were amazing. What was more beautiful was the fact the tsunami edge of Steve's disdain was absent from his gaze. Instead there was pliant gentleness.
Tony's kindness knew no bounds. Steve followed him into the penthouse, trying not to feel like a complete and utter burden.
"I like this too. I really do."
But he was committed and the words couldn't be unsaid, and his hands were on top of Steve's, and Steve turned then, staring at Tony with those oceans of eyes.
The hamster in Tony's brain went into hyperdrive at that. There was no possible outcome where this conversation would be a good thing. Doctors didn't feel duty-bound to pass on information such as, 'Your next of kin has a beautiful face,' or, 'Your next of kin has an amazing, peachy ass.' Both of these statements were entirely true of Steve, and both were a million miles away from the actual words that came out of Dr Archbold's mouth.
Steve looked impossibly small. His shoulders were hunched and rolled in so far, it took six inches from their impressive width. His head was bowed, a few locks of soft blond hair falling across his eyes, and he was staring at his hands. They were clenched so hard, the skin was translucent over his sharp bones.
Since Steve had moved in, Tony had been doing...
The speed at which Steve obeyed would have been embarrassing if Tony had understood why. Thankfully the mythology that had been build around Captain America made it look like he was just a good soldier following orders. Steve perched on the edge of the bed and folded his hands in his lap, waiting.
be an asshole, and maybe he's accidently pulling a Tony and shoving people away to protect himself.'
Steve does what he's told. And Tony can cook.
"What can I do to help you, Steve? Apart from organising all the stuff S.H.I.E.L.D want me to. What practical thing can I do?"
"Gonna need an answer here, sport."
There was no doubt about it. He was absolutely clobbered for Tony.
"What?" he asked.
They walked a little way into the penthouse, around a corner and down a small flight of glass stairs.
The last words came out in a rush, and his face burned again. All Steve could do was look at his hands.
Partner. Buddy. Sport. Any and all of those was better than
"Tony, if I'm going to stay here, you deserve to know. I..."
As he pulled off his clothes and hung his still-crisp jacket in the closet, Tony shook his head. When Steve had woken, the feral terror in his eyes had unlocked some deep-seated protective instinct. As soon as Tony had clamped his hands on those glorious, trembling biceps, he'd wanted to take all Steve's pain away.
"Do you ever..." Steve started, but wasn't sure how to continue.
"I do, it's just..." Steve automatically corrected him, before realizing that in itself, that was also an admission, not just the comforting he meant it as.
"I'm usually trying to be nice, you know."
"You're cursed. With the smart people's curse."
"How does she know when she is supposed to let you out usually?" Loki just asked.
"Don't do that," Tony frowned. "Don't patronize me by telling me I did everything right when you're upset. It's worse than if you told me the fucking truth."
"I still won't kill you," Rocket was adamant.
“There’s Peter, Harley, Grant…”
It wasn't enough to kill Loki right away, but as he collapsed to the bed where Barnes was faking sleep just seconds ago, he realized Bucky could use this window to hurt him badly then.
Finally, it was Tony who had to type in:
"We've just spent 3 days doing just that. And we need to get the cube and the particles before they move them. They already know we were there looking for something..."
But after Tony showed some talent in the area, he started selling the boy’s inventions on the market, and after that took off, he even had an arrangement to do the same still after Tony was Obadiah’s property, making both Howard and Obi filthy rich.
Once Bucky was back to himself enough, he had the power to shove Loki away, now strong enough to jump on his feet, and escape the stunned Avengers. While Loki not only couldn't gather himself from the ground, he also fainted and woke... in Asgard.
He visits Fury and apologizes, and once Fury just laughs saying he's forgiven, and he shouldn't print the bit about the aliens, because then they'd also know what Fury's planning, it's easy for Coulson to ask if his offer still stands, and Fury just tells him.
"It depends. With a large enough amount of both data and time, she can be smarter than me in any field that's not as complex as finding the meaning of all the universe," Tony admitted, and he should have caught the fault in his logic right there and then.
Only Bucky could call the great Captain America "Stevie" without any malicious intent, and Tony rather returned to his work than to comment on that.
need Bucky, I can tell you that without running any calculations."
"I wasn't kidding," Tony's face fell sensing Steve's distress. "I wanted you since I came back from Titan, Steve, or maybe even before. And if you don't want it the other way around then I'll just have to be with you in a way I can."
Didn’t dare to think it would last, but then 3 years later when Scott showed up out of the blue, they still were going strong. And now that Tony solved the little time-travel hiccup Bruce previously had, it must have brought back memories too, because Tony was unusually quiet, but then when they were about to sleep, he asked.
"Tony, what's going on?" Steve tried to ask, and only got an irritated rebuke.
"You're just so... irritating, do you know that?" Bruce raised his voice now. "Fine! I'll just spell it out for you: I don't want you to die, because I care about you! After all the things we've been through together, how hard is it for you to understand?"
"You can't be saying we should have an open relationship, that'd never work. Just look where our first disagreement got us..."
“Are you feeling better?”
"Good, I had to make sure," Loki told him after he saw the sheer disbelief on the Captain's face, turning into a "kitten".
"Maybe that too. But certainly when he said that we were different."
"It's for you."
Looking for Steve's best friend, who was taken prisoner, mind-washed, and experimented upon, they managed to get close many times. And the more Loki saw of this Barnes, the more he found him a wonder.
"This isn't a trick!" Loki was in disbelief. "The spell can only be undone if we manage to get to some kind of understanding, and while I have my doubts that we'll ever manage to do that, it's immaterial, as long as we're behind bars. Even if by some miracle, I would be able to reverse the spell, you'd be still a prisoner of the Grandmaster, don't you get it? Not to mention..."
"Friday," Steve supplied before Tony's imagination would run wild.
"Nicely done," apart from breaking a child's heart, Strange did well on getting them out of the vision, so Loki guessed that was it.
"Exactly. I start to like the people of this planet more and more."
"Finally Steve, you're back. So where are we going? I've been thinking, if we take a Quinjet, we could go anywhere in the world, just think about it."
"I didn't teach you to talk back to me, boy!" Odin was furious, but probably just because Loki's words were closer to the truth than they'd ever been.
“Let’s rent a room in the closest motel,” Tony suggested. “We spend the night there, our meds will wear off, and we go in that stinky base as if nothing happened, take what we need, and go back.”
“But if you don’t-“
"I'm fine. But if you don't want me then never mind," Loki was mildly irritated.
"We're both too self-centered for that to work?" Stephen chuckled but was mildly surprised by the answer.
Loki still wasn't above stabbing Thor for that suggestion, but then, he took off on a Chitauri ship and got lost in the crowd on the ground. Secretly switching sides, and working on eliminating any Chitauri ship and crew who got far away enough from the main battle.
"Then don't," Loki said in quite a hurry.
despite how he never expressed any interest in any sort of movie night, even commenting on some of the film, Steve knew he had to tread very carefully. But for the sake of his best friend and his own sanity, he had to do something.
"Give it a week. It'll pass," Strange assured him, but they also arrived at their destination, and the food was much better than on Asgard, so Loki didn't get his point just yet.
"Ahh, he must have sensed your discomfort, Captain. Normally, Loki is like a monk. I don't think he'd ever kissed a girl, really, much less do more, so whatever the comment entailed, he must have been just all talk."
(See the end of the chapter for
Then, a covert SHIELD mission popped up, taking Steve off the grid for 10 days, and when he got back, Bucky looked tired. Resigned. Distant.
A bit sluggish in the daylight, but having better night-vision than Loki himself. Or the fact that Barnes had some kind of magic lingering in him, even if sometimes more, sometimes less. Sometimes being almost cold to the touch, sometimes warm, and all the more passionate.
"What are you testing for?"
"Or paying attention," Bruce added. "And you did your best with the hand you've been dealt, but sometimes you can't help but wonder what if you were given the same chance as Thor. Where you could be now if it weren't for-"
Steve had never considered crossing that line with Thor before. He must have gone real red too, because Rocket, who was doing maintenance on the ship and were just passing them, commented on it too.
"You must love the suit only too much if you say that," Tony tried to lighten the mood a little, but also switch topics because Rhodey was staring at him again, and the last time he looked at Tony like this, they were kissing, then quickly and amicably agreeing that it should never happen again, but if it was to, Tony wasn't sure he could just let it go as easily as the last time.
"That's not it. It's not you. You were great, and did everything you c-"
Then, his focus shifted.
"Then be my friend again, and it'll be just a favor."
“You want me to thank you or something?”
"Tiny hungry? Tiny cute," Hulk laughed, and then put him back on the makeshift bed he created for Thor with the blankets. "Now Tiny sleep. Get better."
Not that she laughed, or seemed impressed, but Vision was fully okay with that.
"I've bought a car," Tony kissed him when they were finished, and Steve told him he never wanted sex in any other way, making Tony laugh with a borderline smug expression. "An old model. It needs a
Not something Steve could claim of any of the people he knew now, and it shouldn't have mattered, of course, but it did. Losing to Thanos with all his power, speed and strength felt as if Steve lost because he forgot how it felt when he had none of that.
Steve looked puzzled, but his body relaxed beneath Tony's. "Sorry," he said.
Tony pulled himself together. No time to feel sorry for himself. "O-kay," he drawled. "You know my methods, Jarvis. Find out if the White House or Justice is stupid enough to keep information we can use on their computer systems."
"Hi, Bruce, how's it going?" he asked, when his friend's image appeared. "Pleased with your presents?"
"No. Also, I did not lie to Fury. I was just a bit... selective with the truth."
Sif gave him a very strange look.
"I'm aware you are, Tony. So how come the genius billionaire superhero just has a couple of robots and an AI butler in his workshop?"
Steve raced towards her, yelling, "Go!"
Tony groaned. He must have fallen asleep in the lab again. He forced his eyes open to see a sleep-fuzzed face, topped by blond hair, looming over him.
"Watching the idiot box again, Rogers?" Tony retorted, feeling immeasurably cheered to know his partner was keeping watch, even from the other side of the continent.
He'd seen the Captain only once since, after they'd actually unfrozen him. He'd been comatose even then, floating in a life support tank. Fury hadn't suggested Tony help to wake him that time.
"You've shaved," he said, stupidly.
"I've no idea what day it is, but it looks like coming up to sunset. Right. Give me that gun and let's do this."
"What about Dad's lab?" Tony asked.
"And there isn't anything deader. Except that line of enquiry."
"Sir," Jarvis's voice said, as Steve chased the last piece of bacon around his plate. "Ann-Marie has just delivered your packages."
He was tumbling through the air, the taste of bile in his mouth and his senses dazed by dizziness and fading pain. Somehow, he stretched out his arms and attempted to activate the repulsors, but they didn't answer, were still powering up...
"Systems he should not have been on in the first place. You've no legal claim on him, Fury."
"Yes. Which is why I've spent today making sure they won't be able to identify you even if they find you. And why Pepper has no idea you exist."
"Nope. Storm managed to text his CO from McConnell. That's in Kansas," Danvers added helpfully.
The alternative was even more unbelievable.
"They were there because I was," Steve protested.
The road now began to descend, and Tony was plainly watching for a turning.
Tony snorted, punched Bruce on the shoulder rather too hard for it to be totally friendly, and hurried out. He might just have time for a shower as well as a change of clothes.
Pepper gave a very unladylike snort. "Tony relied on me to do the things he doesn't consider important, and he never considered what I thought about them. He doesn't
There was a holster on the belt containing a pistol of a type he had never seen before, but there was nothing that suggested it would be any different in use from those he had...
"What's goin' on?" That was one of the soldiers, who was following, though he was having to jog to keep up. Tony noted that his (unfamiliar) gun was in his hand. "Hey, big bad Wolf, that Stark you got there? Why's he still alive?"
Damn. He'd warned Natasha and Clint that Pepper would be in the building, but hadn't thought to say anything to Jan. The tension between the two women was already crackling in the air. He hurried to try to defuse it. "Pepper, Jan's borrowing one of the suites—"
"Sir?"
"She didn't sound very happy... about that," said Bruce.
"The Man of Iron gave you into my hands or you would, indeed, have died. Heimdall is keeping watch and tells me he is safe in his homeland, though he is always on the move."
White light flared, accompanied by an ear-shattering crash and crackle, an artillery barrage in a thunderstorm.
"No objection," Steve whispered. "None at all – but you might be disappointed. I'm not ... experienced. I've never even kissed another man."
"Where is it?" the Doombot demanded again.
And, Tony was sure, equally dangerous.
"Oh, come on, you need someone with a strong bio background right now. And Hank Pym—"
Steve was beginning to worry about the way Tony was circling the elephant in the room – and sometimes he did feel elephantine around his mercurial partner. Now he moved behind him and placed a hand on his back, just above his waist, reminding him that he was here, and alive – and hoping to stem the ridiculous flow of words.
"So Jan tells me. She also says I have to report this to you, though neither of us knows what it signifies."
"Not a chance, honey. Not a chance. It's... you're so beautiful, babe. So damn wonderful. And hot. God, I want you so much. I thought I'd already proved that, but if you wanna make it a challenge I'm gonna fuck you so hard you won't be able to think, let alone doubt me."
"We have an Asgardian emergency. Stick on our tail."
"Yes, sir. He is with Dr Foster in New Mexico."
There were bright lights flashing through the fog above him. Steve lifted himself out of the stream on his elbows, ready to fight if this turned out to be the enemy, whoever the enemy might be.
"Waiting for them in the Penthouse."
Tony chuckled. "Jarvis, make a note: Steve enjoys rough sex but feels guilty afterwards. So, remind me to go no further than role play scenarios, with maybe just a little light bondage."
Steve smiled. "There are places he doesn't follow either of us."
"You're certainly his." There was an odd note in Howard's voice, and Steve did not dare comment. After a while, though, Howard said, "If you need a safe place to think things through I can provide one, though since yesterday Tony owns the one I'd prefer. He'll insist on going with you— no, Steve." He held up a hand. "Believe me, if I try to stop him he won't rest until he finds you. And I want him to rest too. I think you both need to get out of New York. Right now. Vanish. Let Roberta and myself handle Fury. So go pack. You'll find you have rather more possessions now than you did yesterday, so you may have to unwrap them first."
Steve opened his mouth to explain, but before he had uttered a single word, Iron Man crashed into the room.
It irritated Steve, though he could not have said why. He was tight with tension, wanting to hit something or, at least, work out for hours. The hotel possessed a fully equipped gym and, count them, three pools, but all were now closed for the night. No doubt Tony could have them opened for him, but he had no intention of letting him trouble the hotel staff.
He'd had his own problems at the time and his solution to them was probably the reason Fury had never followed up on his suggestion that Tony help them unfreeze him. Fury didn't appreciate being outsmarted by a cocky seventeen-year old smartass.
Or because he hadn't offered to upgrade the War Machine? Rhodey must have seen the level of weaponry that had taken down more than one of the huge alien machines that he couldn't even move...
Pepper made a noise that was half disapproving, half amusement. "I need one, Tony. You'd better be telling me the truth. See you soon."
The sky was a roiling circle of black cloud shot through with lightning and rainbows and, in that intermittent light, he could see a whirlpool of white capped waves.
There was laughter in his ear.
Hurriedly, he pulled his T-shirt over his head, and sat down to let his eyes adjust to the blue-white light of the revealed ARC reactor.
"Sir, it is pleasant to hear your voice."
It's Iron Man and Captain America to the rescue... but shocks and a different kind of danger for Tony and Steve.
Even though Thor had not physically been there, without his voice the room seemed empty. Tony was still working on the StarkPad, brows drawn together in concentration, and Steve wasn't sure whether he was doing something important or simply avoiding a confrontation. He hoped it was the latter, because he could not let this rest. "So, Asgardian witch," he said. "Who does not know that you 'still live'."
It was Natasha who interrupted it. "Wasn't – what's his name? Lin? – supposed to be updating us on Steve's condition?"
Captain? Wait, wait, that had been Captain America's voice?
He contemplated the still, glimmering water of the swimming pool, striving for control of his breathing.
"I think we're safe enough. I've exchanged pleasantries over the internet with these Wakandans, and I don't think I've done anything to offend them. They're also a source of naturally occurring vibranium. Which they supplied to my Dad. I think they're on the side of the angels. Meanwhile, I'm gonna get some sleep. I suggest you do the same. Tomorrow is going to be interesting."
"How... did... you... get... here?" The leader had taken hold of Okoye's shoulders and was shaking her as she cowered away
Tony, dressed in unrelieved black, was standing waiting for them, his usually mobile face impassive. Perhaps it was the sombre clothing or that Steve had not seen him for some days, but he looked unusually tired and pale.
Except he had no right to be angry. Steve had acted to save lives – his, Pepper's, Happy's and Hill's – before putting his own at incredible risk. Tony hadn't been able to decide, when he landed on that hangar roof, whether he wanted to hug Steve or hit him, then shake him until his teeth rattled.
"Did what Dr Erskine told him," Tony said firmly. "Besides, you can own the serum, but not the men it might create. But the serum wasn't patented and if it had been the patent would have run out. And you couldn't claim a man recruited over seventy years ago was still in the army, though the Pentagon is trying. Which is hilarious because they don't even know if he's the same man, or, if he isn't, if the same serum was used on him."
He'd never believed that home was people, until now.
He had no doubt that Shuri would use her weapon if necessary: Peggy had always been more ruthless than he was. And Natasha. Not to mention Hill...
Behind them, Jean offered her raised hand for a high five. Gene promptly complied, while Clea looked puzzled for a moment, then joined in.
"I'm a reporter from the
Leaving it to Clea to finish up, Tony glanced at Jean to make sure she was all right – judging by the way she was frowning at a tear in her costume, he didn’t think she was in any distress. When the tear miraculously mended itself, he was certain of it.
Steve covered the distance to the spa in three swift strides, reached down into the water, grabbed Tony's shoulders and hauled him out over the edge.
"Who built it?"
"We need to get down there," Steve replied.
"I'm trying to protect you! I told you I won't put your career, or Pepper's, in jeopardy."
Hennis's gun was now pointing directly at Tony's groin. "I'm tired of this," he said. "Give us Rogers or, even if you survive the blood loss, your playboy lifestyle is over."
Though none of the perfectly rational objections to getting into a relatio– fucking Steve had miraculously vanished.
Searching his memory, he could recall nothing before he had broken free of his bonds on the ridiculous flying... ship? Aircraft carrier? Why would you need aircraft if you had a flying battleship anyway?
Steve's coffee exited through his nose as he choked on that sentence. "
Steve and Storm were stowing the prisoner in the rear of the Gulfstream with Betty tut-tuting over his condition, when Jan arrived from the cockpit. "We've just heard from the base commander," she said to Storm. "Apparently the plane you were supposed to transfer to has just taken off without clearance. It's heading out over the Pacific. MacTavish has called in a squadron of fighters to pursue it. The one you arrived in is still there, but the crew has vanished. Want to bet they weren't on the other plane?"
There was no flash, no impact of a lightning strike, but in that instant, the readings on the HUD and Tony's view of the world blinked out.
Sitting down seemed to be committing himself to staying here in Tony's suite – and he didn't even dare look at the bedroom door, or at Tony, though he was uncannily aware of the other man's exact position.
"I'm not kind," Tony sounded offended.
Pepper ignored that in favour of turning a gimlet stare on the Gulfstream's pilot, who had approached quickly on sighting Pepper.  His response was to pause a good ten feet away, looking as if another step would take him into quicksand.
Steve stood balanced on a mansard roof overlooking a narrow city street, gleaming wet under the yellow lights, though rain was no longer falling. There were skyscrapers on the horizon, brightly lit against a cloudy night sky, vaguely familiar, but not those of any American city he knew. And certainly not New York. He turned, and saw a floodlit grey dome that had once been a symbol of hope amid fire and chaos, now rising amid clusters of what were plainly office buildings, with a few spires, also lit from below, standing above a maze of streets that looked nothing like the familiar grid of New York. Beyond it, he knew, was a grey-brown river, bridges crossing it every quarter mile or so. He had last been here to bury the woman he had loved, the one he had hoped to meet again in the past.
And it occurred to him the place was far too quiet. He hadn't asked for music, Pepper was presumably in Washington and, anyway, he had removed her entry privileges. Steve...was gone.
"As obviously you have," Jan added.
"Round the back of the house there's a walled yard," he said. "Don't try the doors – there may be someone watching. Find the areas that can't be seen from the anywhere but the house and go over the wall. Dad will meet you."
The explosion put all the previous firecrackers to shame.
"I thought that was what SHIELD was doing before you extracted him from its grasp."
"I like your voice," Tony mumbled, squirming until he was comfortable.
Still, their passports and bags were given cursory examination, and then everyone climbed, with some relief, into the air-conditioned comfort of the SUV.
"I have not spoken to anyone who saw them arrive but they are garaged at the university, in the research centre, though some have now moved to the sacred mountain," she replied.
dead! Whose brains did it eat to become a fucking zombie? It had ceased to be! Expired and gone to meet its maker! A stiff! Bereft of life. Its metabolic processes ought to be history...!"
"It is not a dead parrot, sir," said Jarvis, injecting just the right note of surrealism as Tony circled the zombie bear-dog, just out of its reach, distracting it as the reporters and camera-people fled for their lives
He had no doubt she meant it, would have fought the Chitauri with anything she could have laid hands on. Like Peggy.
"Partly. It was a bit unfortunate that my hack set off the alarms and I had to fly out of the window carrying a Stark Industries minidrive. I thought for a while I was going to have to shout for help from Avengers' tower to rescue Betty – but she was talking with her father when the hack took place, so finally they let her go."
Whoever had spoken of the silence of the deep had never been there, Tony decided. Though he was plainly too deep for daylight – and unless the HUD clock had gone haywire as well it was full daylight above – the darkness was full of noises, louder than the pounding of blood in his ears, the wheezing of oxygen-low air into his lungs.
Sickened, he turned away.
But Steve's brain had clicked into gear. "No. Just wait a minute." There was one possible option. "Did Tony give Thor a dedicated cell phone or an Avenger's communicator?"
His wrist was bare.
"I don't need to any more. I'm in control. What do you want me to do? Have them spell out 'No Kill I' on the floor?"
"I don't know," Tony said. "Was there anything special about Susan Storm?"
As if by magic, a hand appeared from behind his right shoulder, offering a small cup full of liquid that gleamed amber and teased at Tony's nostrils. He took it without a word noting, as he did so, that, though the hand was gnarled with arthritis and covered in brown age spots, it was as steady as a rock. He was not surprised when, on turning, he found himself looking into a weather-battered and heavily lined face with clear gray eyes under an Army hat. The out of date dress uniform was now a little too large, but it bore a first sergeant's chevrons and an impressive array of ribbons.
"Jan!" Betty reproved her, but her eyes were narrowed as she stared at Steve.
"Hush." Steve reached out and rested the back of his hand against Tony's forehead. He fully expected the other man to shove him away, but, unexpectedly, Tony leaned into the touch.
It was followed by a shout of surprise over the comms, loud enough to be echoed from the cavernous depths of the hangar.
Tony took great delight in flinging it around the curves of his own palm-fringed drive, though once out on the public highway he reduced the speed a little, and the Ferrari growled in protest at being restrained to only about thirty miles an hour over the speed limit.
Overhead, black wings flapped in the air; a harsh bird call seemed, almost, to have laughter in it.
"Thor says that magic is simply science we don't understand yet," Tony said from the door. "And I will drink to that." He made for the cooler, Betty following at his heels.
Iron Man landed a few feet in front of him, causing panic among the SHIELD agents, with much levelling of pistols and rifles.
Tony guessed his was much the same. "Hi, Pepper."
"Well, you know Pep," Tony responded absently, watching the scientist removing two frosted vials from the flask, and placing – replacing – them in labelled slots in the cold store. "Rhodey, call me back later, okay? Computer, radio silence."
Oh, god, what a mess.
"I didn't, until you just confirmed it. But we'd discussed the possibility. We just didn't want to believe they'd risk Steve's life with that gas—"
Well, now.
Even as the thought crossed his mind he saw the heavy gold collar around Clea's neck unclasp and descend slowly and silently to the floor.
"Even if that were the case, Steve, and everything says it isn't, then it's not you – it's something that's been done to you. You're innocent."
"Unless Storm and the lady are agents of the mercenary group we fought in Wakanda," Steve pointed out. "Be careful, Wasp.”
"You can thank your boss for my losing this one," Steve shot back.
"I do not have the answer to that question, sir, but all the electricity in this part of the city is being channelled there."
Not that those meant anything. Like the painkillers and first aid box and the cotton buds and the safety razors, they were just things that Tony (or whoever he had gotten to equip the bathrooms) figured might be needed.
"No and no. You really think I'm gonna pass this to the Feds or SHIELD any time soon? Uhuh. The secret of this dies with me an' Jarvis. Okay, buddy, hijack that cell and prepare to call the number Captain Rogers gave you. Steve, not a word. You'll get your chance if Margaret Carter really is on the end of this."
"Timing's interesting. She left him no opportunity to accept or reject her resignation," Steve commented.
Unlike Steve, Tony was still breathless and shaking. "Attack could have been aimed at you," he said.
"Miss Potts..."
So, ignoring him, Natasha had given her life for the Soul Stone, for Clint and the Dusted and who was to say she was wrong.
"The new king was a young man who had spent much time abroad and he hesitated, at first, to change T'Chaka's policies. He set the Hatut Zeraze to find out how Klaw had entered Wakanda and who had sent him. In this task they failed, but reported that a very secret international agency had tried to cross our borders at the time T'Chaka was killed."
"I doubt it," Steve said. "Seems to me that the boy you describe would be more at home with adults – and highly intelligent adults at that – than with your average kid in high school."
"Just evening the odds. Between SHIELD's briefing pack, your attitude and Loki's staff, I didn't feel much like making a pass at you."
The Natasha from his time had gone straight to Vormir with Clint, and only he, Tony, Scott and Bruce had been here in New York.
"Oh, get out of here, Stark. I've got a lot of work to do."
What's more, while Steve was still staring at this apparition Tony had retrieved the bottle with what sounded like muttered thanks – and had he called that thing 'Dummy'? – and was concentrating on filling his glass, the neck of the bottle jittering on the edge of the glass as his hands shook.
Though Steve claimed not to remember those dreams, they were obviously distressing. Not that Tony's own sleep was untroubled.
"Hold it right there!"
So was Steve.
Because the fog was desperately disorientating. For all he knew, he was swimming in a circle.
"Better than army rations or the SHIELD canteen."
Jan had kicked him under the table. "I think it has something to do with his dead wife."
So did Tony. "Okay, okay," he said, unable to keep defeat out of his voice. "I can't stop you leaving, but at least wait until you're stronger, and give me time to set up a trail of accounts that you can access but can't be traced back to me, so you'll have money for clothes and food and transport at least."
The Panther grimaced. "Once it was the king's bodyguard, then its members were appointed guardians of Wakanda and now... I think the best term for them would be 'secret police.' Our very own Gestapo," he added with a quick, speculative glance at Steve, "though formed with the best of intentions."
N'kendi bowed low and spoke quickly in that language that was becoming familiar if not any more understandable.
"Privatising interstellar peace now, Tony?" Bruce asked.
When reality slowly re-emerged, Tony found he was lying on his front, with his wrists bound behind him. He could see very little, though there were several pairs of booted feet, but he could hear T'Challa talking swiftly and volubly in Wakandan.
Tony shrugged. "I don't think it's relevant. We all stand on the shoulders of giants, and Richards would have been a giant in theoretical physics, had he lived."
Steve held his gaze steady on Tony's face. "I don't need you to be either," he said. "Not with me."
"Oh, c'mon Pep. We can—"
It was a relief to take the wheel of the SUV and carry Bruce and Steve off to Steve's apartment to collect those few possessions – apart from the shield and the bike, which were already at the Tower – that he was allowing himself to call his own.
"Well, then, here goes nothing...
Natasha looked hard at both the Doctor and Lin. "Call us if he shows any signs of waking up."
"I'm banking on it," Tony said. "Because I put a helluva lot more trust in your morality than in Fury's – or mine for that matter."
"Are you hurt?" Tony demanded, overriding Widow and Hawkeye's acknowledgements.
The hangar.
"He helped me cope," Steve said. "I've never been a solo act, Pepper. I like looking after people and Tony is... interesting."
Bruce ignored the babble. "The ants pointed Hank in the direction of that big outcrop near the valley head. Steve climbed up and found that one of the trees clinging to the cracks was actually metal. There was rotted coaxial running down a deep – and probably artificial – crack in the rock into the valley. From there on it was easy."
Tony settled himself against Steve's shoulder. "Thass com'rtable," he said, suddenly sounding far less sober. "Dad ... was ... right 'bout you. Really."
"Naturally," Iron Man replied. "In ten years there'll be nothing else on the road." The cars' passenger doors slid open. "The accommodation isn't up to that in the Tower," he went on as Steve and Clint slung the hand baggage into the back of the first SUV and Danvers, Storm, and Natasha climbed inside, "but there are beds, food and lots of hot water. It was an on-site hotel back in Dad's time, but we revamped it into apartments for visiting consultants, air force personnel and politicians. Stark Energy leases it from SI, but they currently don't need it. So... eat, sleep and we'll work out our next move when we're all refreshed."
"I'm not," Tony snapped.
"Hank, I'll need you there. Danvers, I take it you're in?"
"You really think Hawkeye and the Widow needed my help to go off grid?" Tony shook his head slowly, exaggerating the movement. The glowing eyeslits of the helmet would make the gesture obvious. "Boy, if I ever get to tell Widow that she is so going to tear your head from your shoulders..."
And the knowledge that Tony worried about him warmed him far more than it should...
"Jarvis, what—?"
"Ease up there, Cap. It's all right now."
Even more ominously, the police hadn't called for witness statements. Cap's motorbike was almost certainly present at the scene, yet there was nothing in any of the reports to suggest it had been found. Tony still had the Harley WLA that Howard Stark had modified and SHIELD had bugged in the Tower garage, but he had sent Happy Hogan, who had purchased the Triumph Tiger Explorer as its replacement using the new identity Tony had forged for Steve Rogers, and had checked him out on it before he took to the road. Happy didn't find it, but reported a jumpy police presence.
"Your cloaking device," Tony's voice observed, his voice somewhat muffled by Steve's not inconsiderable weight.
Behind them walked half a dozen soldiers wearing the same battledress as those they had disposed of back at the research centre.
Steve watched the scratched and flickering footage with an expression of disbelief. "Okay," he said. "I admit that guy looks a bit like me, but what he's doing with that... that discus—"
"What's gotten into Pepper?" Tony asked plaintively, as the traffic stopped for no obviously apparently reason and the limo, perforce, stopped with it. "I mean, she's mad at me, an' that's, you know, kinda expected, but you were just sitting there being decorative, which you're good at, by the way, and she
As the helicopter moved in for a closer view, the sound of its engine faltered. It swayed dramatically from side to side, losing height all the time. The blades of the rotor were suddenly visible as the machine began to spin around the rotor mast.
Beyond the bedroom was a long hall, panelled in wood and lit by pools of soft light from table lamps but also containing deep shadows. The effect was almost gothic, as if it had been there for many years.
"I don't suppose that even one second – correct that, one nano-second – of your time is ever wasted Nat, even if you're only keeping Barton in line."
"Yes," Tony said.
The falling sun laid a path of dazzling light across the lake, throwing the mountain peaks into black silhouettes and swathing the forest covered hills in shadow, hiding all traces of man's presence even from Steve's serum-enhanced vision; the extensive villas, the boathouses, the marina, the expensive retirement homes and the discreetly luxurious hotels were all invisible, isolating him on the deserted terrace.
"Not for me." And Steve hated it when Tony used drink to hide behind. He looked around seeking inspiration for a neutral topic. The grand piano provided it. "Do you play?" he asked, nodding at it.
Steve watched his expression, suspecting Tony was waiting for condemnation. "I guess you had a good reason."
"You bug everyone. What are you, then, a busy bee?"
"You're entitled to one strike."
Tony paused, but did not dare turn or speak. His heart was pounding.
"I'm fine. We need to get out there. There are still tornados running wild..."
There was no sign of the portal; gritting his teeth, Tony blasted away several feet of rock and found nothing.
"They were military," Steve contributed.
"Why do you think we're meeting like this?"
But the Avengers were better than SHIELD, weren't they? Thor had offered Loki a chance to surrender. More than one chance. And they hadn't killed Loki, when he had accepted his defeat.
A volley of arrows came out of the dark, probably from the compound walls, which Tony couldn't see in the gathering dark. The arrows fell short of the fighting, but sent up clouds of dust and dirt as they exploded on impact.
"More likely left-over Hydra tech," Steve answered. He hoped.
It was even more manic than Tony's usual monologues, and in the glimpses Steve had had of his eyes behind the sunglasses they had seemed overly wide, bright and dark ringed.
"But you can find it?"
Tony realised.
He was drifting through that state where his dreaming intersected with the real world, aware that he was dreaming, but also aware that he could choose to dream on or to wake up, when Tony's voice drew him out into wakefulness.
"Because you're still mad at me?"
legitimate source. Not 'a' source. This guy thinks he has a monopoly. It'll be one in the eye for him if I can persuade the patent office to let me claim it and not just the process.
Had Peggy died on a night like this, in too-familiar weather, darkness and silence?
"Okay, Thor," he said, "lay it on me, buddy."
Tony overrode Steve. "I'm fine, I'm fine. The flash temporarily blinded me –" He hoped to God it was temporary "–but Jarvis can direct me out of here."
"She's taking a chance," Steve answered, "but the odds are good, even if they decide to take her up on it. Unless the Lieutenant and the girl are bad guys."
It seemed increasingly likely that Tony was mad at him for some reason, though Steve had been sure that he had gotten over his annoyance at being sedated and put to bed back in Oklahoma.
"Easy, Stark. You're safe now."
"Damned if I know," Clint responded.
Tony smiled back. "Of course I am."
"Where is Cap?" Clint asked suddenly.
"Do you have Dr Jane Foster's number then? Or Erik Selvig's?"
"The fire teams are withdrawing," Steve said. "There's heavy rain forecast and the fires can be left to burn themselves out."
"We had. I didn't break it, but Hunter here needed you as bait."
Tony wondered. He took a deep breath and let his mouth run. "I speak nothing but truth to beauty, Dr Ross," he said, affecting a bow, which wasn't easy because the armour wasn't designed to bend like that. "Ask anyone. No, on second thoughts, don't. Just trust in me." He rolled his eyes.
"Doctor Jane Foster," Steve said, remembering a conversation he had had with Tony. "She's one of the most brilliant astrophysicists on Earth – Midgard."
Steve grabbed the pilot by the collar and hauled him through the tangle of wood and canvas and various substances he didn't recognise, though Tony would know—
"That's reasonable," Howard said. "Tony'll show you how to use the computer databases, and he'll also hack anything from the Pentagon that isn't in the public domain. Do be careful though, Tony. I can't fit prison visits into my schedule. I'll brief you about SHIELD myself, Steve. I have an unfortunately close connection with it that I expect I'm going to regret even more than I do now."
"Good, but if White Wolf found he could not use it, he might well have destroyed it."
There was another squeal from behind Thor and rapid female voices talking in near whispers. "A good amount," Thor said. "I can call up a wind or create one."
And (Ooh God, Pepper, I love you) Pepper had, without being asked, anticipated him and intercepted Fury.
"Then let's go." He hoped they could get this over with as quickly as possible because though he trusted his Dad, he didn't want to leave Steve in anyone else's hands.
"So," said Tony, "did I. We were both wrong."
"You can bring me a Martini," Tony told him, snatching up his robe, surreptitiously pocketing his cell phone and exiting the room before Steve carried out his threat.
"Oh, I cared," Tony said. "I still care, despite it all." He petted Steve's hair for a while, gathering his courage. "What did the Witch show you, Steve?" he asked at last. Then, when the other man remained silent. "She showed me all of you, dead and defeated – and your dying words were blaming me for not doing enough to save you, to save the world. I think that's why I seized the opportunity, that night at Barton's farm – because I might never have another chance at getting close to you. Natasha still won't tell me what Wanda showed her, though she might tell you or Bruce... Bruce. We know what happened when she got to Bruce. And Thor, that something was wrong in Asgard. And as we haven't seen him since he went back, I guess that's was true. So, Steve..."
On the CCTV, the scientist pressed her eye up to the sensor, and typed a series of numbers into the keypad. The door opened, and she stepped inside.
"Well, I was only seven, man, and so were you. Made more of an impression on me. So once I'd figured it out I flew here as War Machine. I couldn't spot you from the air, so I left the armour in the woods and headed for the farm. But I, well..."
He's Pepper's, Steve reminded himself. And there's no hint, not even in the tabloids, to suggest he's interested in men, no touch of that kind of scandal. And I guess the gutter press will have looked hard for it over the years. So, he is trying to embarrass me. Well, two could play that game.
"It's Shuri."
"I know he is."
"Oh, and just what is his first name?"
"Really?" Tony was intent, astonishingly interested in his views; Howard  never had been.
Steve turned and ran for the door, knowing that Iron Man would be right behind him, even if he hadn't heard the hiss of the servos and the metallic thudding of the boots on the rubber flooring.
"I'll drink to that idea," Clint responded. "But Stark, whether or not this guy is related to Coulson – and I think he may be – he's definitely fishing, whether it's for the government, SHIELD, Homeland Security or the Veterans' Association."
Tony didn't dare look at Hank.
"Rogers. I'm glad to see that you're in one piece." That was Nick Fury's voice, and Tony braked to a halt, putting his weight on his heels so that Bruce had to stop too, and reaching up to take off his sunglasses. Bruce slapped his hand down and they had a small, undignified struggle which Tony won.
"It looks... extraordinary."
"Like Steve?" Damn it, had someone actually duplicated the serum? If they had samples of Steve's blood...
Tony was following in Steve's tracks as they explored the woods on the other side of the valley from the Devil's Ironing Board, for once happy that the other man couldn't watch him closely. Even better, that conversation was practically impossible.
Once he had made a perfunctory round of introductions, Tony rounded on Steve. "Computer," he snapped. "Scan Steve again, at once."
It wasn't difficult to find the case: it was lying on the floor, shredded. It was only as he bent over it that he realised was that it was made of vibranium steel.
Steve grasped Tony's arm and moved towards the strange vehicle, the black-clad man beside them and their escort a few steps to the rear.
The cell where Tony and Steve had been held turned out merely to be the most palatial of many. Below the main building was what could only be described as a high tech dungeon, packed to overflowing with those loyal to T'Challa.
The sphere from the ornithopter now sat in a transparent isolation tank, its surface covered with various sensors, so it looked like nothing so much, Tony considered, as one of those ridiculous pieces of modern art of which Pepper was so fond.
"Ms Romanoff has called you twice. And Ms Potts three times."
"Why not?"
"That should punish him thoroughly, sir."
"Not only that," Danvers said, "but I know for a fact that less than a year ago that was the case. There's been scuttlebutt about this new spacecraft, but I thought it was a load of bullshit. Until last night."
"And that's not right, either. Two people can't – shouldn't – fall this deeply in love without knowing each other. But you're everything to me, and I can't, I shouldn't..." Even as he spoke, Steve remembered his promise to Howard, to put Tony's welfare first, whatever happened.
"Then who is he?" Fury snarled.
That hurt. "Not sure about Dad," Tony said lightly. "He was sorta obsessed with you. An' he married very late. Looking for an heir, same as he expected from me."
And it all came back, not so much in a flood as in waves battering through the lingering alcoholic haze.
"You're shivering and you're soaking wet," Stark pointed out. "If we go up to the house, you can shower and I'll find you some clothes and food. Do you think you can make it if I help you?"
"They're gone," Jarvis said, "but they left a message for you."
"—swer me! Steve!" Tony's voice was suddenly back over the comm-link.
And it shattered the remains of Tony's resistance. "No! That's... that's ridiculous. You know something? I'm sick of being sensible." Tony held out a hand. "Just remember that if I do anything that hurts you or that you don't enjoy, you tell me then and there."
"He doesn't flirt with me," Steve protested.
"Of course." Tony signalled for T'Challa to follow him, and the two of them hurried into a corner of the parking lot.
What was even more worrying was that nothing reached the press about Captain America, despite the fact that the police were well aware of the identity of the shield-wielding civilian who had restricted the casualties to single figures, and must have seen Iron Man fly off with him in the direction of Stark Tower.
Another African-American, this time a man wearing one of those dislikeable SHIELD uniforms, was pacing the office, glaring at Howard every time he turned. This was, presumably, Fury.
Well, anything?
"Ye canna change the laws of physics, Captain."
"Well?" Bruce asked.
Which strategy worked well enough smashing through the door and walking out onto the landing, but came to grief on the fire escape stairs... where he slid on his back down the final flight, and crashed feet first through the fire doors at the bottom.
was what Tony wanted, to fight him, to keep him at arm's length...
Then Thor's deep voice said, "Steven. Are you well?"
Steve shook his head. "The first thing I remember is a mock up of a '40s room – but they got the detail wrong. The radio commentary was of a baseball game I'd actually attended." He paused, frowning. "I was too concerned with that, and my memories of the Red Skull, to take much notice, but I think the inside of my right arm was a little sore." He looked at each of them in turn and added, candidly, "I heal fast, since the serum."
"No, Captain."
"So this seduction is a spur of the moment thing," Steve said, wondering if, in that case, he should, indeed, back out.
Only when he did that, when he dropped his guard, the faces from his dreams, his nightmares, came dancing across his vision: ghostly, old, bloody, white-eyed, accusing...
"Yes, sir. Or I can locate you a house nearer Seattle."
"There's no such thing as a 'soul'," Tony protested.
"Yeah. As if I wasn't unsuitable already. Then there was Peggy." Steve's voice had softened, become slower and reflective.
"I know that, sir," Jarvis said snappily, "but the fact remains that that is what is happening."
Tony, however, only stayed long enough to refuel, answering questions in monosyllables and refusing the beer everyone else was drinking.
Even though he had been expecting to see him, Tony had to steady himself against the workbench.
This morning he had watched with an uneasy feeling in his stomach as Tony and Bruce dismantled the Vita-ray machine, then with disbelief as Hank and Jan
Then the memories flooded back. He was in the Malibu house – Tony's house – Tony...
Tony swallowed bile as the vehicle powered onwards, unable to see anything, until, bursting out of the red cloud, he found himself almost on top of the main building.
"I've seen him fight," Howard said. "That was evidence enough."
"Shhh. I want you to hold me, Tony. This is nothing. It might seem bad to you but I spent two decades in chronic pain. And I'm pretty much healed from today's – yesterday's – injuries. So, please." Then, as Tony's arms went round his neck, "We'll find him," Steve promised. "You and me, we can do anything." He waited until Tony's breathing had steadied a little, and then asked, in a normal voice, "Do you know whose DNA it was?"
"You vouching for Stark, Rogers?" Fury asked.
"You could try, buddy," Hawkeye said tightly.
"Well, the name wasn't in SHIELD's briefing pack."
He never used to be afraid. Well, not as Iron Man. But the implications of what had happened today were not something that Iron Man could deal with – that would be all down to Tony Stark.
The other buildings stood in a sea of vegetation, without even a beaten track to mark their doors. Tony stared at the creek, eyes narrowed. Downstream of the buildings at what should have been the narrow mouth of the valley, it widened into a pool deep enough to swim in, and which was probably home to quite a few large fish. The remains of the rock fall that created the pool and blocked access to the valley was too convenient to be natural and Tony had little doubt that the water exited the pool through a tunnel – or possibly a series of tunnels far too small to be entered by an adult human – cut into the rock. Upstream the valley was even narrower, the creek running between sheer walls and the dark pines clinging to them.
The repulsors were on full power as Iron Man made his way closer to Thor; so were the loudspeakers.
"Jan can start," Steve said. "I'll get the coffee. We're all going to need it."
It would have to be enough.
The assumption had been quite wrong.
"And how did Howard know I 'assaulted' – murdered – anyone on the helicarrier?"
Everything else seemed insignificant.
Tonight, though, only his Dad would be there. Which was a relief because his friends would have been as bored as he was going to be.
The emotional rush that gave Tony made him want to dance on the spot, punching the air and yelling, "Yes!" What he actually did was smile at Steve and challenge him to, "Say that again when I've been tinkering for seventy-two hours straight in the workshop trying to meet a deadline."
The man threw in his hand and rose. His eyes met Tony's and it was either Clint Barton or his double. He inclined his head in a "follow me" gesture, and Tony trailed casually after him, through the emergency exit, up the fire escape and onto the roof.
Tony took a long swig of beer, uncomfortably aware of Thor's keen gaze.
"Thank you, Sir." JARVIS's voice was as serious as Tony had ever heard it.
"Meanwhile, how are you feeling? Not that I'm not in awe of the effects of Erskine's serum, but should you be out of bed?"
"I'll try to begin at the beginning," Betty said. "You remember, Tony, that I promised you I'd try to locate my father, and sound out whether his research team was still in existence. I had to be at a conference in Washington so it wasn't too difficult to find out where Dad was living."
Crouching beside Steve, Tony held his breath as the hollow sound of boots on wood moved overhead, then away from them towards their recent prison. Then Steve was moving, out into the light and vaulting up onto the walkway.
"Open it."
"They feed us little pieces of technology, in return for our silence and our assistance in dealing with the rest of the world," Chayo said. "The reason our governments have refused to negotiate with your representatives to bring us your new technologies is because they have been forbidden to do so by Wakanda.
"Do it all the same. You know where the guest rooms are. You and Betty can clean up there. I couldn't find any trace of your luggage – if you had any – but the rooms come equipped with nightwear and all the toiletries you might want. Also, Pepper left some clothes here. They'll be about right for Betty, though they'll swamp Jan. So—"
The sergeant tossed the rest of the liquor down his throat. "There's somethin' been buggin' me," he said, in an entirely different tone. "Phil, now, he grew up on stories of Captain America, most of which he got from me."
"There's just one thing," Jan went on, apparently oblivious, though her voice was horribly strained and getting louder and louder as she spoke. "I... I can't hear anything."
Storm actually took a step backwards. His expression suggested he thought Tony was unhinged.
"Then we'll unofficially kidnap him," Steve said. "What Colonel MacTavish doesn't know won't hurt him. Let's get him onto the plane."
Steve shoved the pilot at him, and Iron Man hooked a gauntlet through his collar, before holding out his other hand. Steve tried to wave him off, but Iron Man was having none of it. His hand closed around Steve's arm, then the repulsors on the boots flared and he was towing both men out of the wreckage and towards the flickering light of the surface.
He couldn't let that happen. They needed protection, or something, anything that could be used as a weapon against the armour.
"Hot wire it," Jan said.
Tony turned to face him, unable to keep the grin from his face. "Oh, yeah, where were we?"
"So, why this sudden urge to come down here?" he asked. "I'm not taking a run, Steve. Because, really, you know me better than that."
"Little busy right now, Rhodey," Tony replied as he checked the stealth function was active, then descended from the tree.
Steve gave in and let himself laugh. He stretched and said, "Didn't want to interrupt."
Steve couldn't imagine why he'd tried to avoid this. He slid his hands down the curves of Tony's back, found his ass, and lifted him a little, fitting their groins together, letting his arousal speak for him. And, oh, God, Tony was just as hard, just as aroused.
The Iron Man armour wrapped itself around Tony like a benediction.
"You were saying?" T'Challa commented, withdrawing his head from the access panel. "Technological barriers confirmed down, Stark."
"I think it's already locked and barred."
Jean made a gagging sound and turned away.
"Okay. I'm calling the armour now. Keep in touch and activate your tracker, Cap."
"Good morning, Jarvis. Is Tony still asleep?" Steve asked.
He blinked up into Tony's sunglass-shadowed eyes.
"Yeah. Sorry about that. Sorry about everything, really."
Pepper's returned smile was thin. "I don't think Natasha enjoys taking unnecessary risks, the way Tony does."
"Shit!" Tony grabbed the nearest tool – a wrench – and flung it away. It hit the forge and bounced, narrowly missing DUM-E. The bots scuttled for cover as, in an effort to stop himself creating more damage, Tony swept the remaining tools from the workbench in a clatter of metal. "Damn it,
Tony's only failure seemed to be with Wakanda, which remained as much a mystery as ever. Indeed, it caused him, in a fit of pique, to remark that, "Obviously the first rule of Wakanda is that you do not talk about Wakanda." This in turn led to Steve spending an uncomfortable two hours watching a movie that, for all its undoubted brilliance, left him shaking his head over a morality that seemed not to have improved since Prohibition.
you, Jarvis," Tony said sarcastically.
Fandral chuckled. "He says nothing. Which is why Frigga is charged by Odin to question him at regular intervals. A wise move. I think Loki still cares for her. Of course, her own heart is so great she still loves him as she ever did." He sighed.
"It's just relief," Jean said. "Believe me, I'm on a team of testosterone filled teens, and I know."
"And that would make him useful to other interests," Steve said. "We know that certain elements in the Pentagon, Congress and the White House are working against us."
Steve grinned to himself, and hurled the stone, not at the group of men surrounding Okoye, but at the one who was still watching the tunnel. Even before it struck home, he was leaping from the top of the shipping container to land right in the centre of the group of mercenaries.
"Your survival pleases me greatly. The fair Natasha and the Hawk-eyed one?"
It felt strangely intimate, just the two of them, sitting with only the table corner between them; strange because he, like all the other residents of the Towe, occasionally took food down to eat with Tony, or Bruce, before Betty had joined him.  Perhaps it was because there was no voice of Jarvis to make a third in the conversation.
"Nah, you just decided to let me face Pepper alone because you're scared of her."
"Roger that."
"Name given by said scumbag, whether he was CIA or military or Al Qaeda was Cornelius E. Moorcock. The account on which he drew his cheques has been cleared out, but he was representing a holding company based in Singapore. Which I'm not going to identify for you, just in case it's legit."
However, instead, it was Clint's face that appeared on the big screen. "Hello, Tony," he said. "Thanks for the assist, pal. This is in part repayment and part self-preservation. Jarvis should have all the details for you in the compressed files but, to summarise: both you and Cap are under attack from our own government.
"It is good beer," Thor said. "Drink."
The flattened notes of an unknown (to Steve) melody from a cell phone promptly broke the mood, whatever the mood had been.
"What?" Tony had hoped that Steve might have been in contact, had expected Jarvis to put him in touch or at least give him news. This abrupt announcement was a warning of sorts – Jarvis wasn't saying who it was for a reason.
Though Tony flew as high as he dared and poured on the power, the trip to the East Coast took more time than he probably had to spare. At least he was moving faster than the hurricane. This suit was three times as fast as the Mark III, in which he had confounded the Air Force on his way back from Afghanistan where he had exacted a most satisfying revenge on the Ten Rings.
Laurel took Tony's hand and shook it firmly. "
"Scrapings from a Chitauri gun we'd pulled apart."
... but both voices were masculine, and Pepper...
Tony had to take several deep breaths before he could control his voice enough to answer. "So did I," he said. "But I guess we both learned better."
"Thank you, Jarvis. Is this Tony's house at Malibu?"
"Both, thank you."
"Tony then, or his armours," Steve said quietly.
When the aircraft touched down, Iron Man didn't. Instead, he continued to fly on above the taxiway, eventually leading them through the doors of a huge hangar standing wide and welcoming, light spilling out on the concrete.
"You mean where Jarvis couldn't spy on me," Steve interrupted ruthlessly.
"If he does, there may be something worse waiting for us." Tony pulled to a halt at a red light. "Bruce, take the wheel. We may need Iron Man."
"You think I won't give it back?" Though he was considering the idea right now. "I'm hurt by your lack of trust. Not that you're encouraging me to trust you—"
"Clint and I will make some calls," Natasha said. "Though if we are going to intimidate anyone we may have to head for Washington."
"So did I. Until I found she was working for Fury."
"If you mean have the ladies you brought home last night become bored and left then, no, sir. They are still in the penthouse. Captain Rogers has made them breakfast and—"
"Of course I mean someone other than me," Tony said, with dignity. "What's more, unlike me, they didn't do it the first night when SHIELD had so much on its plate. They did it when the whole area was under close guard."
"Thanks, Jay."
"Tony needs to be careful..." Bruce's voice said in his ear.
Painted on its nose was an A overlapping a circle, its crossbar terminating in an arrowhead. The font was that of the A that had been left on Stark Tower at the end of the battle for Manhattan, that was still there as a symbol of the building's new purpose, a statement of intent.
Tony straightened. "You got something?"
"If that's the new version of my will I've just e-mailed her some amendments. I can't see her today, anyway. We're landing at Vicstar field. No one will expect us there, but it's an easy flight to McGuire Field in the Iron Man armour. I want to talk to Colonel Velasco, if he's still alive. And to offer our help if it's needed."
"I expect that. Also, I'm moving back to the West Coast as soon as I can arrange it."
"Yeah. Fury's all over the crime scene but we're out of there. What about your target. Did you lose them?"
"Let us hope you are right."
He didn't have an answer.
"I'm not concussed, just pissed that I missed the chance of getting out of here," Tony retorted. "Well, at least now both of us are missing someone will eventually look for us."
It was a rather important question.
"I could tell you that, sir," Jarvis said, "but it would not be true."
"Yeah, yeah. We just need to find the bad guys."
He'd never stayed anywhere so expensive before, though he'd visited Howard's suite in Claridges (and perhaps Stark Industries still kept that, though God only knew how much it cost nowadays) and had become used to the luxury of Stark (or the Avengers) Tower.
Tony said nothing.
The 'cabin' was actually a substantial house, roofed in shingles of local timber that would hide most of it from the air. A long transparent deck on granite stilts strode out into the calm waters of the lake, tempting Steve to just sit at its end with water and trees surrounding him.
The repulsors glowed brighter. Slowly, the giant alien structure lifted up from the pavement. It was uncomfortably reminiscent of its original descent from the Tesseract-created portal.
Once erect on her Jimmy Choos, she eyed him eyed him coolly, and greeted him with an even cooler, "Mr Stark."
It didn't seem to have worked.
"You have been asleep for eleven hours and six minutes, sir," a female voice said from the air.
"We should have done this some time ago."
Scrubbing at his face, with his hands, Tony said, "O-kay, Jarvis, get Marilyn for me, send a message to Ms Potts that we're fine, and then I'll need to talk to the PR department. Special Projects in Seattle. And the wire services."
"It would certainly confuse them," Tony agreed. "Everyone knows Steve Rogers was Captain America, and if you use 'Captain Rogers' most people will assume you're thumbing your nose at the government. Even if they believe it's your real name, they'll probably think you're your own grandson..."
The disappointment was so overwhelming that Steve opened his mouth to curse at Jarvis, but Tony beat him to it. "Fuck it, Jay, I told you I didn't want to speak to anyone. If it's that urgent you can take a messa—"
"Yet you've just friendzoned me. There's someone else, isn't there?"
They hadn't gotten anything from the CSIs.
Steve scrambled upstream, fighting his way through the overhanging branches, until he was in water just a few inches deep. Only then did he let himself fall forward, then rolled onto his back. The relief brought by the cold water almost turned him dizzy.
"Convenient."
the original Captain America," and was overjoyed – and envious – when he discovered that Steve had been instructed by Major Sykes himself.
Tony wandered over to the bar and poured himself a cognac. "This is becoming intriguing."
Tony could feel panic rising. "Damn it, Steve, what did she say?"
"Then let's get on with this." He spoke to the Hatut Zeraze in Wakandan, and Tony found himself hustled outside into the frame of the stone panther's fangs, where Hunter, in the White Wolf suit but with the cowl pushed back, stepped forwards and spoke to the crowd.
"Tony," Steve said, in gentle rebuke. "I'm sorry, Agent Carter, but, as you can see, I didn't need your help. That's been clear for a while. So what was I supposed to do? Fall for you because you look exactly like Peggy?"
Suddenly able to move, Steve flung himself across the room and snatched at the Doombot's remaining hand, holding it still, his muscles straining against an enhanced strength that might exceed his own.
"He can," Steve said.
From there, he could see Steve and their unexpected ally, white and black clad, fighting back to back in a deadly dance that was awe-inspiring.
Tony shrugged, which was quite a feat in the armour. He was rather proud of the articulation. "I did okay. Call it a trial run."
The spectral funnel built again. Then, in an explosion of rainbow light, it vanished, Thor – and Steve – along with it. The rain, though, was still falling, bouncing from the Iron Man armour, erasing the strange sigil in its flood, and washing the tears from Tony's cheeks.
Darkness.
But even as he had been making the decision that college could wait until he and Stark Solutions had helped his Dad lick Stark International back into some sort of shape after the mess Stane and Hammer had made of it – and reclaiming it had been difficult enough, though it had left him even greater respect for Roberta Rhodes' ability as a corporate lawyer – he had had that talk with Pep's father.
"Bruce also said to watch out, because you were a flatterer, except when your emotions were really engaged."
"I hope so," Tony said.
"Score one to you, Stark." The voice was light and amused. Then the pilot took off her flying helmet, revealing a second helmet of bright blonde hair. Now she was standing close to Tony, her blue eyes met his on a level. She said, "I want to talk to you about James Rhodes."
"Plenty of time." Tony was far more interested in the artefact than what was only nominally his nineteenth birthday party. Tonight was about business; contacts and networking and encouraging clients and rivals to get inadvisably drunk.
Tony shrugged. He didn't understand that himself or why he was bristling at his father's challenges. Howard always challenged him: it was one of the reasons Tony adored him.
Steve could imagine the lightning blasting, the hammer flying through the air so fast it was a blur, all Thor's terrible strength and power unleashed against those who threatened his lover, his friends, and was glad he had not been there. He might have felt compelled – to try – to stop Thor, even though he knew that, in the same circumstances, he would have had no compunctions about killing.
"Brunch then?" Steve asked. "There's a lot we can throw together, and we have plenty of eggs."
To Fury – to everyone at SHIELD, except possibly Phil Coulson – he had been a tool to be used. Now that tool appeared to have been discarded, which was both a relief and, if he was honest, a blow to his self-esteem. Apparently Captain America didn't matter to SHIELD. He wondered if Natasha and Clint were also being ignored, and if they felt the same... disappointment. Bruce, on the other hand, was probably grateful.
Tony felt Steve's arm slide round his shoulders, strong and warm and comforting. "But the most likely one is still that it wasn't him."
"Steve, what was it you said about Pepper?"
When it came to getting along with other people, Steve needed no instruction from him. Somehow, before Tony quite understood how it was happening, Steve, with the assistance of Bambi Arbogast, had become his emissary in negotiations with Pepper. Between them, these unlikely allies persuaded her to stay with the job of CEO, though she drove a hard bargain which included the proviso that Tony keep his distance and that her name would, indeed, be on the lease of the next ARC powered office building.
Tony took a breath to argue, then let it out slowly. Maybe Steve was right and he was going to need time to draw conclusions from this mass – mess – of data.
"I'd love to, but we aren't really here."
With a sigh he rose to his feet and made his way back towards the entrance to the penthouse, fighting the high wind with little effort. It was then that he became aware of raised voices inside the building.
"I don't know," Storm said. "I guess not. But you were asking about Sue, and she gave me those books. Ben – Major Ben Grimm – introduced her to them. Reed didn't think much of them, though."
"What d'you suppose is waiting for us down there?" Steve asked wryly.
It echoed what Natasha had said in the helicopter, that they weren't in touch with Steve right at that moment; cold fear silenced Tony for two, three, four breaths. He had only just regained control of his vocal cords when Pepper's voice, familiar with its fear masked in anger, exploded in his ear. "Tony, what the devil's going on?"
Tony was none too sure how Pepper had gotten herself invited to the post-funeral SHIELD wake – well, not a proper wake, of course, given the absence of Coulson's body, but it served the same purpose. For that matter he wasn't sure how he had come to be invited himself, but he rarely turned down free booze and certainly not booze that Fury was going to have to finagle out of SHIELD's budget.
"Oh, your romance is a well known story. Carter hated the exploitation."
They ushered him through a door, and then retreated.
, Pepper."
So that meant, "Follow me."
The question sobered him. "Only if you force me to," he said gently. "Making you CEO of SI was a good decision. I stand by it. But I'm buying out your voting shares in StarkEnergy."
"We destroyed it," Steve said. "Or rather, Howard did. That gun is some weapon."
As he was speaking, the Ancient One shook back her sleeves and, palm outward, struck with the speed of a striking cobra at Tony's chest.
His disappointment at his continuing lack of memory was shocking. Had he somehow expected to recover memory while he slept? If so, it hadn't happened, though every moment since he had woken in restraints was pin sharp.
"Hi. I didn't think we could break the speed limit in these conditions."
"I suspect she is too busy trying to retrieve the Norn Stone," Thor said. "She almost certainly believes you dead, and therefore that the secret of her presence on Midgard is safe."
"But can we trust any of them?" Tony shot back. "We certainly can't trust anyone allied with SHIELD."
North was unperturbed. "Why should you care?"
Steve thought about the vulnerable skyscrapers, the subway system and the low-lying islands with growing alarm. "Have you told Tony?" he asked, hoping that his partner would have some ideas.
How had his mind come to be imposed on this body – and, more importantly, how could that imposition be reversed? If he knew what had triggered it he might be able to take the first step to correcting it.
"Why would she think that?"
"A woman?"
"What agency?" Betty asked.
"I thought that was to make sure you succeeded where they failed," Tony said.
"No," Thor said. "But I may be able to turn it aside. Why was I not informed that this was happening?" he added sharply.
"Careful," Tony warned him. "Let me go first. That seems—"
He took half a dozen deep breaths before closing his eyes, bending forwards and sliding down beneath the water surface.
Steve hadn't known what to expect, but it certainly wasn't the huge mansion behind its high walls and wrought-iron gates. Tony drove the ordinary-looking but, he had been told, supercharged, convertible through those gates and along the sweeping drive between the manicured trees and lawns. He parked in front of the house, where a number of teenagers were sitting or standing casually on the front steps, plainly interested and trying not to show it.
Tony avoided the low, heavily padded ottomans and sat at a recognisable desk with a sloping, softly lit surface that was probably something high tech.
Steve told himself, even as he fought to hold off his own tears and buried his face in Tony's hair. But he knew it wasn't true. That Tony had left his childhood behind when he'd lost his father and his world at sixteen. Steve himself was younger, nineteen years younger.
He shuddered.
As he swooped lower, he saw the bodies in the water, making his path clear. Scan for body heat. Pick up anyone who showed signs of life and transport them to shore and the waiting ambulances.
"Tony, be careful up there!" Steve called urgently.
Tony was unshaken: he had known all along that the Attorney General had to be involved in the legal actions against him, though it did explain his lack of significant progress with the movers and shakers in the White House, which he had put down to the impending elections. "Guess I'll have to up the political slush fund."
Pepper said something very unladylike, but all Tony felt was relief.
The clicks and moans were vaguely unsettling, as was the faint, rhythmic groaning.
"Jan!"
"Most emphatically not."
He was just in time, because the trucks were braking, spinning sideways to block the road in front of the SUV.
"Well, surely Dr Banner—"
He shivered in the cold wind
"They were brought here on false pretences, in my name. Effectively," he added, as Tony started to protest. "They have already provided much needed information about how our enemies reached Wakanda."
He was answered with a wry smile and a headshake. "No. No, it wasn't just that. Pep could give
"And obsessed," Betty agreed. "One thing about Dad is he never gives up; in fact, being defeated just makes him more determined."
It hit exactly where he had aimed, exploding at the base of a massive tree. The flash and bang was followed immediately by both the screeches of fleeing monkeys and the creak of straining wood, then the thunderous crash of the tree falling. Before the first shock waves hit their vehicle, Steve had thrown three more arrows.
"I am happy," he protested. "I have Steve back. I also have you back. I just... lost my cool. There are too many reasons... I will not have him die again for me. And I'm lousy at relationships, Thor. I fall for the wrong people or I lose them, and it's always my fault. I can't do that to Steve."
"If so, it is probably more your field than mine."
Tony started. "Jarvis," he said, letting go of Steve with his left hand and reaching into an inside pocket. "Everyone else is going to voicemail." His fingers flew over the screen without a glance at the icons, then he laid the cell on the table and said, "Yes, Jarvis? You got something for us?"
"You both will regret it. For however long you live; one day or a thousand years. I know you are a man to take risks but this is not one. From what I have seen, Steven is as committed to you as I am to Jane."
He had missed the part of the conversation with the cops, but it was plainly not a confrontation. One of the patrolmen was apologising for stopping them. "Guess the curfew doesn't apply to you, Mr Stark."
"What about the king?" That was Steve again, asking the pertinent question.
"Jarvis called—"
Gene's notes said that the artefact was completely inert, though warm to the touch. Tony had no intention of personally verifying that but the armoury's sensors reported that it remained at room temperature. There was something about it that frightened him; perhaps the markings on its surface that resembled no recorded human script but which he was sure had meaning. There was a bright scratch on one side, where, apparently, Gene had scraped off the metal sample he had sent to Tony in a not-exactly-a-test-tube. Gene hadn't been able to identify it and neither had Tony but it wasn't vibranium or that equally strange metal, adamantium.
Tony shrugged. "The building's still here. Even the Hulk does less damage than the Chitauri."
Tony lifted the faceplate. "I was sure he was," he told her.
"Shit," Tony said, even as Steve dropped his hand and started running towards the explosion. "Someone's taken over my gig." He sounded as if he was right on Steve's tail, but there was no time to check, because the door was a stride away.
"Is it safe to go back upstairs, yet?"
All the same, try as he might, Steve couldn't let it rest.
Though aware he was being distracted, Tony couldn't refrain from lecturing. "Bruce explained it to me. Hulk is different, more rational, when Bruce deliberately triggers the change. This time he didn't. How's Hank?"
"Yes. Scared of you and Steve. Something to do with that hunk of metal." She waved a dismissive hand towards the artefact.
They had not gone more than fifty yards when the noise of hoofbeats behind them sent Hogun spinning, mace in hand, while Volstagg whirled with astonishing speed for a man of his bulk. Somehow, his axe was raised before he had completed the turn.
"What's odd?
"Sort of. You gonna hop aboard?"
"May I observe?" T'Challa asked.
Bruce looked startled, and shot an uneasy glance at Steve, only to see the grin widen, then disappear as Steve made a zipping motion over his lips with one hand.
"Aliens will be back. If not the Chitauri, then others. Earth needs to be ready to battle them, if and when the time comes. Wakanda... could help."
Tony felt a surge of rage at the defiling of that perfect body. "What the hell happened to you?" he snarled.
"But the Vita-rays are a whole new area of study," Hank protested. "You can't destroy scientific discoveries—"
And the noise of overstressed engines was louder than the sirens, louder than the screams—
Necessarily, he shoved all of it aside.
"Guess you reported on me too."
Tony rolled his eyes. "Oh, great."
He fired the repulsor blasts directly at her hands. The egg-shaped object flew high into the air where it hovered as the woman took a step, but only a single step, backwards.
T'Challa looked at his brother with contempt. "Envoys who were not even Wakandans. You involved countries that already fear us when we need them to be allies."
The Iron Man armour was travelling high above the plane carrying the Avengers to Seattle, its sensors continually scanning for a threat. Only Tony, though, knew the suit was empty, save for its own Jarvis download. He himself was in the upgraded stealth armour, heading not for Seattle but for DC. Both armours were a lot faster than any jet currently in the skies, commercial, private or military so Tony knew he could catch up with the plane carrying the Avengers and hangers-on and even swap armours before they reached their destination.
It looked as if the rock had slipped down along a vertical fault, dislodging a couple of trees which were now clinging desperately to footholds just above the waterline.
"You can't do that," Pepper protested.
The clearing was silent, save for the clatter of rain on stone and the plosh of feet splashing through mud as the stragglers from the crowd fled.
Jarvis, who oversaw the security here as at the Tower, made sure there was no impediment to his path back into the grounds. He was walking up to the door when the AI's voice spoke into the earbud communicator that Tony had insisted he wear every time he went beyond the house.
"That thing is still under examination. We don't know who made it or what it does," Tony snapped, though even as he spoke he was wondering why it had had no effect on Pepper.
The SUVs slowed as they approached and came to a halt an arm's length away. The side door of the leading car slid open, and a very tall – even taller than Steve – African man dressed in black, white and amber striped robes stepped out. He bowed slightly, then offered his hand to Tony. "Welcome to Wakanda, Mr Stark." His grip was firm. "I am Trade Minister N'kendi."
"Coulson arranged that," Natasha said.
Tony was right at his heels.
"A shower? You certainly do." Tony turned towards his computer array. "And I have work to do here. We'll talk when you're ready to see sense."
"Now that last, I believe," Steve said. "You wouldn't have tried that line if she'd been alive to allow you and Fury to check your facts."
