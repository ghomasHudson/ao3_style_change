Bucky had turned south and had just stopped at a light when suddenly he saw him.
"Trickshot wanted to look for his brother, maybe it was something about that? Some of the omegas think their Alpha might have actually killed him, but you know, I thought that was maybe just kids being hysterical? You'd think that if he had killed him he would have kept a lot more quiet and no one would've heard about him waving a gun around all over the place." Steve sighed. "This is all so messy...all these Alphas just switching up their omegas when they get bored or they're too 'badly behaved.''" Steve tried for a smile and tried to joke. "You would have definitely gotten a better behaved omega than me at this point if you'd be arranged."
Enjoy the Part 4 kick-off with a double chapter update!
Tony glanced back toward the pool, at the blonde hovering under the sparkling blue surface of the water.
Tony felt his body relax, his tension melt away, as Steve began talking again.  His chest swelled with an emotion he couldn't name.  It wasn't the words, but the tone.  Steve's voice was like a magical spell that made him feel... something.
we can go home." He caught Steve's hand on his chest and guided it down, gently, between his legs, letting Steve feel his stiff cock through the fabric of his clothes.  He leaned forward to nip playfully at Steve.
it?"  Steve took another turn and Tony groaned.
Of course these people would be eyeballing necks, seeing who was bonded and whose hackles were the biggest.  And Tony had drawn attention to it, by wearing the collar. Goddamn, how many of them had noticed, and how many people had they talk to about it?  Was everyone going to think he was a homo like Sam Wilson? Worse, a homo who liked taking the omega role? Would people think that was why Steve was so uppity, why Tony had ended up, against all expectations, with a huge, manly man with sideburns and muscles and a strong jaw, an omega who might just be able to pass as an Alpha... and had, for years, because if you weren't there to smell him, you'd never guess, even with the blond hair.
He collapsed into bed about twenty minutes later, pressing a kiss to a half-awake Tony's shoulder. He curled into his side, head tucked against his shoulder as he eyes slipped shut. Steve felt right here. Felt like he belonged here. The distant darkness of being left alone in Tony's subconscious was alien to him now.  It felt like a life time ago.
"Okay. Great. I think we're sorted then?"
"You got anymore in the house we should know about?"
of it was unclear.  He was on a winding road with two narrow lanes and not much traffic, and he stood off to the side, staring, shivering, convinced he was here for a reason, but unable to discern what that reason was.  It felt important, certainly, life-changing, even. But it was like a wisp of smoke; he couldn't possibly hope to grab it. He watched a car go past, and felt a small pang of some ancient memory, but it disappeared when the car rounded the bend in the road and disappeared.
"...okay," said Tony softly.  "Leave it to me, then. I'll go with something nice.  I promise." He reached over to brush his fingertips over Steve's cheek.
"Right, but at home, I mean, I have great defenses, and the suits, and Steve has his shield... we're okay in the house, right?"
..." he gasped as he twitched on top of the blond.  He had the presence of mind to reach down to fondle Steve's balls, stroke his length; Tony had always been a selfish lover but things with Steve felt different.  What they were doing felt... intimate.
"On it."
Pepper was waiting for them inside, a cup of coffee nursed and half empty before her. She glanced up and her eyes widened at the sight of them, mostly at Tony looking terrible and Steve looking suspiciously okay. Although his neck was mottled purple. She stood, rushing over to them and taking Tony by the shoulders where he stood. She glanced him up and down and knew what had happened, her lips set in a thin line.

He extended his arms out, in a
"He'll choose me," said Tony, hopefully.
Tony's hackles rose automatically.  "Oh." He abandoned the orange juice and threw back the bottle of vodka.
When Tony wiped away his tears Steve's heart ached in his chest.
and it kind of made Steve want to kneel at his feet all over again. But he wouldn't. Tony needed to
Seven looked at Steve pleadingly.  "I don't want to be here," he whispered, softly.
He met her eyes and reached over to squeeze her hands briefly. "It's good to be back," Steve hummed. They headed back downstairs.
"We're still working through the blood samples. But to know if we can get results from might take months, or years.  We've been working with the serum samples from the eighties without any success."
Steve had not really expected to spend his anniversary on the phone with his boss, but since he was a soldier, he wasn't surprised, either.  He twisted the new band on his left hand; the metal was cold in the chilly London air.
"What are you talking about?"
like this. Look, you're scent mates, neither of you signed up for anything.  But
"He's turning own omegas against us!"
...she didn't know.
"Hey there," he breathed, laughing gently when Tony cracked open an eye to glare at him. Steve leaned down to kiss him and then nudged their noses together gently. It was so easy being domestic like this, being happy...it was easy to forget about HYDRA and Bucky and everything they'd done and wanted to do. It was easy to forget about SHIELD. This was just
Steve stared straight into his dead, dark eyes, wishing he could just reached up and rip off his mask. "опусти меня," he said, words clear and slow like a command. He didn't fight, but he held his ground, not letting the soldier push him back down.
Tony looked sharply at Steve to see how he felt about this.  He had always taken it for granted that neither her nor Steve had any real family.  Now there was a cousin in the mix.
!  No shirtsleeves!  Make him put on a jacket!"
He didn't mention the one, large mar on his perfect record.  Finding out Stane had been selling weapons under the table for years and laundering the money to artificially inflate profits had been like waking up to a nightmare. Stane was one of the only people Tony actually trusted; he'd never hacked into his business partner's files, because why would he?  He also hadn't snooped around in Pepper's phone or computer for over five years.  Tony had limits.
"What about when he's sleeping?" asked Aria.
"...what'd you want?" asked Tony sourly.  He was sitting cross-legged on the couch in his boxers, playing Grand Theft Auto on the Playstation.  Rhodey watched the car onscreen tearing around. Tony had let his facial hair go and he was wearing glasses instead of contacts.
"Well, I could never have afforded one. For me, back then, they more represented luxury than anything else. And you know, I grew up in the Depression." Steve snorted. "Didn't have much. I think...people should always wear what they wanna wear. I personally don't get why you'd wanna wear a collar on a street. In the bedroom it makes sense but going to get your groceries, bit much,
Steve looked emotional, and for once, not in a bad way. He looked overwhelmed. And he was, with a strange sense of happiness, perhaps even gratitude. He studied Tony's face intently and then kissed him again and the kiss was filthy and rough and a little awkward, lips parting and tongues nudging together, teeth clicking. Steve trembled against him. When they finally parted for air his cheeks were pink and eyes a touch darker.
? he wondered, watching in horror as Steve slammed into someone, twisting his ankle, and then tried to leap between another pair of roofs.  It was unclear who the person he'd hit was or even where he had come from; the tape might have glitched because he seemed to appear out of nowhere.
We don't have to do this.  We can just walk away. He can't make us... we don't owe him anything..."
"She means bond," explained Laura to Steve.  "That's what she calls bonding marks.”
Tony felt a lump in his throat.  "But I had a vasectomy."
Tony's skin crawled.  Sometimes, he felt like JARVIS was getting just a little bit too damn smart for his own good.
pretty, look at her widdle
Here's your long-awaited smut.  Warning, explicit content, et cetera.  And trust me, there's more where that came from.  Wink.
She, Clint, and Tony exited the observation room and walked into the interrogation room.  It wasn't an especially warm place; there was a table, two chairs, and absolutely zero decoration, unless you counted the mirror on one wall that had the observation room on the other side.
"--a dream," he said.
"No."
put yourself there. Not some Alpha who's lonely and horny with a lot of cash to spend. And I know you're afraid of being alone, but right now you're
"...Stark, Anthony, and Rogers, Steven," said Tony, after mentally saying "Simon and Garfunkel," and "Hall and Oates."  He could tell she wasn't happy to see them and he decided to bite back any sarcasm until they had at least gotten into the damned function.
Louis laughed warmly. "And do you enjoy your heats?"
"In what?" asked Steve.
In the omega pen, everyone looked over at Steve with some interest.  Just as the Alphas had warmed to Tony during the previous night, many of the omegas seemed less wary of Steve today.  DeSoto, of course, immediately broke away from him to speak to someone else. There were still plenty of people here who thought he was a dangerous radical and turned away from him quickly, as if his radical ideas about being equal to his Alpha were embarrassing or contagious.
Steve felt a cold shudder run down his spine. He swallowed.
"Bed?" echoed Steve, sounding lost.
He didn't know what to say to make it better. It also didn't help that Steve was slipping past tipsy and into something else.
"I was drawing," he murmured. "Inspiration struck me, I guess. And I suppose I wanted to make a point."
do undermines my standing and... in case you haven't noticed, I don't exactly need help, I'm not really all that dominant to begin with."  Tony sighed, still softly stroking Steve's hair.
Tony, on the other hand, was just getting started.  He loped down to the shop, punching in the code to the door, and waltzed in with a sense of peace settling over him.
"That's the Stark promise, baby.  Go hard or go home," sneered Tony.  "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going home.  Oh, and in case it wasn't already clear, you're fired, Rogers."  He turned to leave.  There was a sharp, fiery pang in his chest and he reached up to grab the arc reactor.  He needed to swap out the core again; Fury was right about one thing.  Wearing the suit all night had probably cashed out the palladium core, and he was sure the thing was sizzling inside of him, dripping toxic discharge into his chest cavity with alarming speed.  He wondered if he ought to risk flying back or if he should just hail a cab.  Decisions, decisions…
Steve nudged his nose against Tony's in an almost cute gesture. "There's...a small chance I damaged your bath tub, just a little bit."
? Tony had wanted to scream.
"Thanks," said Tony with relief.  He polished off the glass, took the bottle of wine, and let Sean lead him to the door.
!"  Tony was definitely in shock but he wouldn't have cared if he was missing limbs.  He wanted,
Tony wanted to say
In the meantime, he and Steve were relaxing, melting together in the bath.  Tony wanted to sleep, wanted to sleep for a million years with his omega in his arms like this; he was crashing hard from his climax and the warm water combined with Steve's smell was so relaxing.
Being an Alpha, Natasha could smell him; he didn't smell like sex.  But he and Bucky had been together the better part of the day. Who knows what they'd gotten up to?  Their bond was stronger. That much was obvious.
Well that certainly didn't help with his pink cheek predicament. Steve's throat went a little dry.
?" she pressed.
"...you know, I don't really like it when things happen before noon.  Why does he always have to do crap like this before noon?" muttered Tony, clicking the video and wandering toward the kitchen as the baby he considered defective stopped flailing and began crying.
Steve drew orchids lazily on the couch for a few hours before he finally bothered to get dressed. Then he figured he should probably cook them... something? There was very little in the fridge that Steve recognized, but he found frozen chicken in the freezer, and a jar of curry sauce in the back of cupboard that was
He lit a cigarette with shaking hands.
Eric ignored Steve, so Tony asked the question again.  "How do the discipline an omega? Whack them on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper?"
If you loved, liked, or at least put up with us for this long, you might as well check out Part 2:
It shuddered at the thought.  (It was not supposed to have thoughts.)
"-and Steve should absolutely be here. He's my mate, anything between me involves him, too."
"Have you found your bond affecting all aspects of your life, or has it been mostly personal?" asked Boswell.  "We haven't seen much of Iron Man lately."
One of them rolled down the window.  Beth was glaring at him. "Where the hell do you two think you're going?"
Tony set his down gently.  Everyone leaned in to stare.
a kilo of fibroin.  (Fortunately, he could.)
"They did?" Steve said, not quite believing it. "Really?"
But whatever it was, he wouldn't let it get to him. And unless a threat reappeared they was no need to trouble anyone with it, especially Fury.
"Oh, yes, yes it does," agreed Richard pleasantly.  "But we're in the home stretch! You can swear if you like--"
"I think I kind of got frustrated with you because I liked you. I wasn't used to liking people. Especially people who I disagreed with."
"I can think of a few times I've been this happy in the morning," replied Tony glibly, stealing another kiss from Steve.  "...you're not just going to leave me like this, are you?" He wiggled temptingly against Steve.
Richard chuckled appreciatively.  "Go ahead, let it out--"
He did not know how he'd gotten here, what had happened, whether he'd just had a dream or some sort of strange flashback or what, but he was shaken and paranoid.
"Maybe you shouldn't do cocaine if you know that you're prone to anxiety attacks, huh?"
The drive was a little tense, though at some point Steve's hands did relax back down by his sides. When they neared the place he subconsciously reached for Tony's hand beside him, curling a few of their fingers together. He didn't like being nervous, but he was. He knew when they'd turned onto the right street because he could see the crowd gathered around the establishment and signs waving in the air. Steve  narrowed his eyes, spotting a few signs in the distance:
"We should get going," DeSoto piped up, apparently excited.
Was this about Christmas?
Tony looked down.  "...I meant to do that," he said.
"Damn it, Stark, he was going to kill himself anyway," snapped Natasha impatiently, eyes darting between Tony and the computer screen in front of her.
Tony flipped his head back again with a groan.  Steve sank down and Tony shuddered with delight as the omega sucked him off, slow and sweet, his tongue tracing familiar skin, never giving Tony too much.
He had thought that the omega couldn't possibly hurt him and yet he was definitely hurt, internally.  Revealing that mark had done something terrible to him. He was injured, somehow.
"We're supposed to keep a watch on them," protested Sitwell.
If the others hadn't been there, Tony might have swallowed his pride and let Steve do it.  It felt wonderful to be close to him, to inhale his intoxicating scent and to feel the warmth his body radiated. But Tony didn't want to look weak in front of the others.  And he didn't want Steve to know he still wanted him, against all logic, against his own best interests.  When Steve's hand had brushed his arm in the arm, Tony had broken out in goosebumps.
. If I was an
For some reason, Tony contemplated, pornos never showed moments like this.
He looked up finally and did what he did best: made a joke.  "...I guess ignorant, arrogant dicks are your type, huh?" he said, often Steve a weak smile.  As usual, the crow's feet around his eyes appeared, and combined with the beard and glasses, the age gap between him and Steve was exceedingly obvious.
"You go explore," Steve told his mate, and squeezed his hand, kissing his cheek for good measure. "I'll go see if there's any omegas worth talking to in here. And if you find out where they're keeping them for the auction, let me know."
"No-- I mean, yes!  The garage, Tony's shop, it's-- it's the safest place in the house," said Pepper, wringing her hands.
"It's going to be okay.  I'll keep you from him. You're mine.  You're safe with me," said Tony, resuming his strokes.  He gave the sleeve of Steve's shirt another tug with his other hand.
The room was quiet.
Behind him, Sam shifted uncomfortably.  Having two omegas in heat in the same room was making him salivate and he felt a little gross watching Phil compulsively shred things and move them around.
out of control.  It creates a paradox, see?  I'll say, 'Steve would like to speak to you,' and they'll be like, shit, I don't want to talk to an omega but I can't tell Steve not to since his mate's ordering him to... their heads will totally explode.  It'll be amazing."
"Would you like to know what happened to the
"...the kids hear fine," said Clint after a moment.  Of all the questions Steve had, for some reason, Clint chose to answer that one.  "I wasn't born deaf. My dad drank, and... I'm an omega." He bounced Lila on his lap playfully and offered a small, almost apologetic smile.
want a baby Natasha."
"Proper moves," repeated Tony, lips quirking up in a smile.  "...maybe you can teach me some moves, Rogers. I'll dance with you.  I should warn you, I am naturally talented in that particular department."  (If Howard was any indication, Tony was probably not lying. Howard had grabbed Steve for a dance more than once and he was quite good, though not as good as he obviously thought he was.)
Natasha let out an awkward laugh. "Yeah, on a normal day. But not in your honeymoon period."
He put a knee on either side of Steve's thigh and pushed his shirt up, leaning down to kiss his abs.  Steve's skin was taut over the muscles and it twitched in response to the brush of Tony's lips. He sat back up and reached down to unzip Steve's pants, his hands reaching in to pull out Steve's length.  For a moment he stroked Steve idly, looking down at him while Steve smiled lazily up at him, his member slowly going stiff in Tony's hand.
"Come on, Tony.  You and him are connected.  Search for him."
"Okay.  So we have one lead.  Here's the others," said Natasha.  She held up a couple of flash drives.  "I pulled a list of all currently known HYDRA bases.  Steve could be at any of them."
Tony was lying across Steve, both of them were covered in syrup, and Tony was humping Steve idly.
"...okay.  But before I give it to you, I want you to know that... that if you don't like it, that's totally okay.  We don't have to go to the conference. If you want, we can just show up and let them refuse us entry, and we'll still make a point, and you don't have to wear it at all," said Tony.  Even though his voice was calm, there was clear anxiety in his eyes. As much as he liked the
Steve waved him off.  "When I did go out it never ended well." It either ended up with Steve getting into a fight with some Alpha that Bucky had to pull him out of, or Bucky shacking up with some girl. Sometimes the girl would even know about Steve, that he was Bucky's mate. He remembered they used to coo over him.
was that, Coulson? Why did you--" shouted Tony, wringing out his clothes, furious.  He looked up at the three faces peering down at him.  Natasha had a small little mysterious smile on her face, and Tony didn't like it at all.  "Okay!  That's it!  Show's over!  I did it, I synthesized a new element, now get out!  All of you!  I told you, I don't wanna be an Avenger, it's stupid, Iron Man is a solo act and always will be!  Scram!"
Tony had to give credit where credit was due.  SHIELD had hit all of his major fears.  Fear of leaving people to die: check.  Fear of losing Steve: check.  Fear of failure, humiliation, abandonment, not being good enough... check, check, and check.  He thought the death scene was weird, though.  He knew Steve's old mate, Barnes, had fallen to his death and figured it was a glitch in the system.  Tony was taking Steve's lead and not mentioning it.
want a commitment because we bonded?!  I didn't sign up for that, Steve, and just because you're the new face of omega rights don't mean that you get to say what nine out of ten omegas want. I mean, there's a ton of very happy omegas out there who don't
"Do you want coff-- oh my gosh." Steve blinked. "Are you
"I got thrown against a wall. Nearly knocked me out," Steve said quietly. He could still remember the feeling of cold fingers closing around his neck and
Both of them understood that, bond or no bond, Avenging would always come first.  Perhaps it was this understanding, more than anything, that solidified their bond.
His eyes were watering. He felt like he might cry, or maybe be sick. Steve could still feel his heat. But he could also feel the chair, the heavy weight of that plate pressing down on his forehead...his gaze became unfocused.
, maybe.
His fingers came into focus before his eyes and if Bucky was saying anything else he was becoming increasingly unaware of it. He watched the way his fingers moved against the wood in fascination. His skin looked so pale under the dim light in the room, the source of it being the window in the door through which the corridor lights bled through. Steve frowned. When had his hands gotten so big?
"As you know, we've been conducting a search through Europe for Barnes.  So far, we've turned up empty.  But since we know, through you, that he's alive, we'd like to recruit you to help us find him.  Alexander Pierce, who's a member of the World Security Council, asked for you specifically.  I have it on good authority that you're getting antsy and I don't blame you.  I'm guessing doing daytime talk shows isn't as fun and being in the field, is it?"  He paced through Steve's old kitchenette, trailing his hands over the counter.  "I'm asking you like this, in private, because contrary to popular belief, I don't have it out for you and Agent Stark.  Every day that goes by without knowing where Barnes is, that's one more day we're at a disadvantage.  We're running out of ideas.  You're the only connection we have to him... other than the Winter Soldier."  Steve must have looked surprised, because Fury nodded.  "That's right.  We know there's a connection.  What that connection is, though... that's something we'd be better off knowing.  So, it's up to you, Captain.  If you want to be put on this assignment, we're happy to have you.  But I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess you still haven't told your Alpha yet, have you?  If there's one thing we got out of his psych evaluation, it's that he's a man who's crippled by a fear of not being good enough.  And if there's one thing we got out of yours, it's that you got a hero complex and you'd rather handle things yourself than risk hurting a third party."
Steve was grinning from ear to ear. "I think that sounds
"Hours?" repeated Steve groggily.  His had lasted less than that.  Steve had a feeling that's what must have happened when they did it to Clint (if anyone ever had. They probably had.) He imagined it wasn't fun. The heat the inducer created was a painful one, not the sweet and tender kind.
"I'm not with HYDRA, if that's what you're asking."
Steve accepted the sandwich when it was offered and chewed at it slowly. It was weird not having an appetite; Steve was usually always hungry. The pickle was sweet yet sharp, like the kind his mother used to make. He liked it.
"Tony.  Slow down.  Talk to me," said Pepper with her usual forced calm.
Steve sighed.  "JARVIS, can you just read the conclusion, please?"
Tony. There is
"A hundred percent," said Fury.  "...even if he's just a consultant.  He's a powerful ally.  He's already hacked SHIELD twice.  That's one of the most brilliant minds in the world."
"I thought Sir would be interested to know that Taylor Swift just tweeted at you asking when she can borrow 'your boi' for the weekend as she has a world opinion to change overnight."
?" he asked in exasperation.  "You're gonna kill me... this is it?"  Steve turned onto Olive Street. "...is
Tony set it aside and picked up a notebook to begin reading it.  He was certain he'd seen at least one reference to the tesseract, but the photo had gotten him distracted, and the half-finished gauntlet lying on the desk, its wires trailing over the side like they were some sort of weird steampunk jungle vines, was calling his name.
And then there was Tony.
In the background, Steve heard Clint holler at someone to cover him and that he was taking a break.
. It had been over seventy years since he'd been a real fight, after all. It would take Steve a while to get used to it, he supposed, especially after the squishy gig as Tony's PA and then as his mate. He groaned as Tony nudged him, burying his face into the pillow.  He stilled when Tony mentioned that there was blood.
Tony was so lost in thought, his mind taking him back to dark places and shadowy caves, that he almost missed Steve's words.
"No.  It wasn't PTSD, if that's what you're asking. I don't know what it was.  ...I'm not even sure it was mine." Steve murmured shook his head.
He placed a hand over hers. The skin was impossibly soft and loose.  "Of course."
"No.  No, never, I would never let him--" snarled Tony.  His hackles were still spiked and now, with his mate distressed and in preheat, Tony was a bundle of anxiety and paranoia.  "Never," said Tony firmly. "Never, no... you're okay... shh... omega... shh... my mate... you're with me now... I'll never let anyone touch you, I swear..."
A strange memory returned to him all of a sudden. The president, years and years ago, laughing with a cigarette in his mouth as he shook Steve's hand.
"That guy's like a bad penny," said Sam, crossing his arms.
Having someone else with two fingers up his ass was about the weirdest thing Steve had experienced since the novelty of being frozen alive. He tensed up almost immediately and Gleason had to keep reminding him to breathe. If Steve tensed up too much it would just hurt him further. He felt... tender down there, but not directly hurting.  The previous day, he's kept having what felt like muscle spasms of cramps.  Today it was just an ache.  The violation didn't hurt but Steve sure as hell didn't like it, either.  Steve didn't usually go up there other than for sexual reasons; have two fingers inside of him like this, in a clinical setting, was always going to be horribly uncomfortable.
Stevie's part," said Tony, still edging through the crowd toward Pepper.  “You’re McCarthy until you prove you can actually do Stevie’s part.”
Tony looked back down at Steve; they locked eyes.  Tony smiled at him. "I fuckin' love you, Steve, you all-American, star-spangled army puke, you," said Tony, cupping Steve's cheek in his hand.  He stoked the skin with his thumb, feeling a strange sense of tenderness. Tony was rarely one for gooey moments but this moment was definitionally already pretty gooey.
"Okay.  Okay, a bath, then breakfast.  But at noon, please, Steve... please.  Just a couple of drinks, okay?" said Tony, trying not to let too much desperation crawl into his voice.
. Steve would never want to be anywhere else. He woke to-
Steve was still giving him that serious, concerned, "I'm the Captain" look.  Tony heaved a miserable sigh and snapped his fingers at the waiter.
been shot.  Seems to me like it's better to be bonded and safe..."  He picked up a glass of rum and settled down onto the end of one of the sofas.
Donner seemed a lot more interested now.  "...Banksy is a good omega."
"Tony.  Focus," said Pepper, who was used to Tony's odd over-focusing and distractability as a defense mechanism.  "Did you say Steve was re-bonded?"
He peeled off his shirt, covered as it was in sweat and grease, and then kicked off his shoes and socks before shucking off his jeans.  In his boxer-briefs, he walked over and set on the end of the bed.
Steve couldn't feel anything himself.  Considering the recent weird feeling in the pool, he was suddenly worried that this was some sort of bond exploitation.  Was this HYDRA?  He couldn't rule out Bucky, could he?  Could an Alpha feel an Alpha
"...what?" asked Tony.
"Tony, everything is fi-" began Pepper.
Tony shrugged again and went to pour himself a drink.
"He loves you."
Steve swam over to Tony, to mouth at his neck and smile against the skin there. "Not your servant," he murmured into his ear, tone teasing and seductive but also making a point before Steve sank back into the water. The music was pleasant but the feeling of being underwater was better. Steve honestly found twenty first century music very confusing. Everyone had a different idea about what a 'classic' was. Back in Steve's day it had been
No response.
"...being silently supportive and not stealing the spotlight or saying anything and letting Steve do his thing," amended Tony.
"Well, I would say that sending you undercover to an old friend's son's business was asking for you to have a breakdown or some kind of... misstep. Dying isn't good for your mental health, not just your physical. While yes, you are responsible for your actions...so are SHIELD.  Your first placement was ill-advised."
Tony put a foot on the nearest car and kicked it away, then reached out, scruffed Steve by the back of his shirt, and flung him away.  He hoped he hadn't been too rough but he didn't want Steve here.  Didn't want him to get hurt.  He hoped Steve had the sense to get up from where ever he had landed and get the hell away.
"C'mon.  Maybe I'll feel better if I read some fanmail.  Have my ego stroked a little."  Tony cleared his throat loudly.  "Ego," he repeated, looking pointedly at Steve.
like giving speeches."
He set the heavy box on top of his lab desk and flipped off the lid, digging in deep.  He fingers brushed glass. He pulled out a dusty, framed photograph. His heart sank. The photograph showed three men-- no, two men, one boy.  Tony Stark was in the center of the photo in black robes, looking unusually bashful, eyes down, grinning. One hand was holding the corner of a diploma.  To his left, Obadiah Stane stood. He had a wide smile; his eyes were closed, forever frozen in a half-blink. He was holding the other corner of Tony’s diploma, pulling it up, showing it off.  Perhaps this is why he was laughing, and why Tony was looking shy. Tony had no memory of the photo being taken. To his right in the picture, his father, Howard Stark, stood by. Unlike Obadiah or Tony, he was looking straight at the camera and wasn’t blurred by motion.  He wasn’t smiling; he had a look like this was expected. That his teenage son getting a high school degree, and acceptance to MIT at the age of 15, was normal.
Steve was already storming into the hallway, chucking his shield like some sort of oversized novelty frisbee.  Sam was shooting.  Guards were shooting.  And Tony was raising the heels of his hands and shooting, too, shooting people he didn't know, killing them personally.  Which, in a way, was better than the alternative, which was designing weapons to send to kill people
Tony growled at her.
Steve had only been at the conference for a day and already he felt like he was going crazy.
Vanko reached up and grabbed May's hair, yanking her free from him, throwing her to the ground.  She'd barely even hit the stage floor before she was drawing a pair of pistols and aiming for Vanko, but the bullets bounced off the core of his armor like pellets.
He forced himself to go meet Cece at the coffee shop so they could talk about Steve, even though he was shaking and cold and itchy.  He wanted to find Karpov and get some medicine. That mission had moved up on the list. However, with Cece so close, it would be foolish not to consult her.
Steve let out a long breath and pressed dial.
"I felt bad about the distance as soon as you did it," Steve murmured. "But I was angry and stressed and then...then I had to focus on doing the right thing. I hope I did it in the end."
Seeing him smile made everything worth it and a strange sort of weight lifted off Steve's chest. He accepted the file off the nurse. "We'll arrange the best care for him, I assure you," Steve promised. The nurse still didn't look convinced. Although she did keep staring at his arms. This was why Steve didn't walk around in vests more often. Tony still had his jacket over his shoulders, despite being warm.
It was all wrong.  Terribly wrong.  Her skin was like ash in his mouth and he spat it out instantly, automatically.  His body rejected it even before his brain could.  This was not his omega.
"Steve?" Louis tried to meet his gaze. "Are you okay to carry on?"
"He's my favorite," Cooped grinned.
"...Virginia.  I'm serious."
Steve managed to look down and just met his gaze. Nothing could have been hotter to him in that moment. "T-Tony. Ah. Fuck." It took every ounce of willpower he had not to rock forward into the tempting wet heat of Tony's mouth. "I'm not gonna last long like this," he warned him, breathless and pink cheeked.
There was a pregnant pause.
It turned out, not around her Alpha, Piper spoke plenty. Or maybe she just felt comfortable enough to around Tony and Steve.
Steve sighed and frowned a little at Tony's admission, not knowing what he could say to make it better. "Okay," Steve murmured and squeezed his hand. "But can you not do the neck thing straight away? Don't get me wrong, it feels great... but I kind of lose all coherent thought. I want to be
Steve didn't last long. One final grind against Tony's fingers and he came with a shudder into the other's mouth.
He didn't really sound very sorry, Steve thought.
"We're going the legal route."
"No," said Eric.  "Stephanie Li won the auction but I guess she took him out, decided he wasn't her type, and that was that.  Then two months later, Chris bonded him. I think that omega was already friends with Chris's omega, Sunshine, so it worked out nicely."
The elevator pinged and they shuffled out into the hall.  The hall was long, narrow, and tall, with high-set windows and a tile floor.  It was reminiscent of an older school. There were a few people in suits milling outside of a heavy wooden door; they looked up when Steve, Tony, and Sharon approached.
"Am I a good person?"
"Sure, he's a regular customer.  He works with omegas and buys a lot of cheap temporary collars.  Nice fellow."
Steve had just spoken a bunch of words but they were nonsensical, frankly.
Tony. I want to make them pay."
"She said that she sent you to kill Stark."
Sure enough, once he was in calling distance, several of them raised their hands and called, "Captain America!"
"I don't know if I should tell you this. I don't want to open old wounds, Clint; it could be nothing..." Steve knew Phil said not to mention it. But Clint deserved an explanation, and in his position Steve thought he would want to know.
"Yeah, it's super messed up," he agreed cheerfully.  "Looks like you just have an explosive orgasm or something."  Steve's face went red all over again.
Steve felt a tremble down his spine.
Guess who's showing up next chapter?
"...uh, your
"He's with the doctors right now," she murmured, clutching her coffee tightly. "They've not given away much."
"...Giddy's car is outside, in the parking garage downstairs," said Donner helpfully from within the pen, on the other side of the rope.  "You could let him outside until Mr. Stark escorts him back in."
"They do it in the kitchen anyway," Pepper grumbled fondly into her newly acquired cup of tea.
They'd patched up Steve's hand, removed the glass and wrapped bandages around it. Steve was all cleaned up and then moved into an MRI and then an X-ray. If Doctor McCloud noticed the extra scar tissue on his neck she didn't mention it. They'd given him new hospital clothes. They were white and awkward-fitting but it was better than nothing.
Was that why it hurt so much when Tony called him
He didn't want to think about it.
"Are you scared of needles?" asked Natasha bluntly.
"Maybe one day when it's sunny," Steve murmured, curling an arm around Tony's shoulder as he leaned into him. He sighed softly, his gaze drifting over the horizon and up into the wispy clouds above. It was still mostly a clear sky and it was gorgeous. The light pollution made it hard to see many stars but Steve could still count quite a few.  ...or maybe those were just airplanes. There were always airplanes in the sky in this century.
"I don't want to talk about it," said Tiberius sharply.  They dropped it. Pepper, at least, couldn't smell him, didn't know what the big deal was.  But Pietro's reaction to him had been an unpleasant reminder of just how unsettling his biology was to the statused.
It took Steve a moment. He froze as his brain caught up with his body and rocked back onto his heels, his hands falling back into his lap as he retreated from Tony's crotch. His own wetness between his thighs almost surprised him. Steve blinked again.
Tony froze.  There had been a photo.  A man leaning out of a window, smoking and lost in thought, dog tags dangling.  Bucky, who Steve had described as "an old friend." What had ever happened to that photo?
"Colonel Rhodes suggested a night out.  He seems concerned."
"...we're all thinking it.  He's completely full of himself.  Steve knows," Natasha reassured him.  "Once you get to know him, though..."
"Fucking
"Of course, Steve.  First of all, I get to see you in a collar.  Second of all, free drinks. Third, I hate Malick as much as you do; the guy's an asshole.  And most importantly... I really wanna support your omega rights thing. And this is something that I can do, as an Alpha.  And ever since I got to know you, y'know... things have changed for me."
He was glad Steve was feeling fulfilled, but he thought about the mission with dread.  He wasn't a soldier. Wasn't an assassin or spy or... whatever the fuck Fury was. Tony was a businessman who'd taken to wearing a suit of armor for fun.  And it was great fun, because he was invincible in it, and because he didn't care about his own well-being very much. But having someone he cared about, someone made of very mortal flesh instead of a gold-titanium-samarium alloy... that was different.  He didn't want people shooting at Steve and he didn't like how eager Steve seemed to be to be shot at.
"My life was
But Pierce didn't seem like he was lying.  "Yes, quite sure. I can put you in contact with Agent Rumlow directly if you'd like.  At this time there are no active missions in that region."
taxes pay for--" began a man, but he was cut off by the same woman.
"No," said Wanda and Pietro together.
"He collared you!"
"Don't you think it's a little hypocritical?" the reporter pressed. "Captain America, kneeling?"
"I need to get out of here," Steve said quietly, looking up into Bucky's eyes.  Fierce, fiery blue met glassy, muted grey.  "And then, I want to save you."
Lila's whole face broke into a huge grin and she laughed around the dinosaur in her mouth.
After a moment, someone in the front raised their hand.  "...how early can you breed an omega?"
Not a friendly smell.
" exploded Tony the second they were in the car.  The last time Steve had heard Tony use that sort of tone, it was it exclaim that someone didn't like cheesecake.  Tony clearly thought the king was insane for not wanting Iron Man. "It's
"I love it," Kitty smiling politely beside him, her eyes glinting.
"Hello?"
It was only in the last twenty years or so that bonding had begun to have legal repercussions.  It was such an inherent part of the social dynamic that legislating it had been nearly impossible.  Even though omegas and Alphas could legally break a bond, doing so physically was, as far as Tony was aware, impossible for omegas.  Alphas were the only ones who could sever it, and even then, it was known to be a difficult thing.  A divorce did not mean the bond, and the ability to feel each other, went away.
Tony edged away, as if pregnancy might be contagious.  "...gross."
"Hey!" he barked.
Donner let out a pain sounded, clutching at his stomach. "Ah! Ah, it hurts." Pepper gripped his hand tight.
"I love subpoenas," said Tony distractedly, hands roaming over Steve.
"Get out of here," he said quietly.  "Go kneel for someone else.  There's another Alpha upstairs.  Why stop at two when you could have three?  Hell, might as well treat us like Pokémon - try to catch us all."
fault, I spent all weekend doing my damnedest to piss off Malick."
"I'm fine. Considering you don't even work for SHIELD anymore, you take up far too much of my time, Captain."  His voice was curt, the trace of a smile gone.  Nick Fury had never been one to talk much about his own feelings.
"I don't like being handed things," he said after a moment.
He blushed a little when the shirtless picture was held up. "They wanted to do it," he shrugged in a weak defence with a small smile on his lips. Steve had to admit... he looked alright.  Well, it had been better than when he'd toured with the USO.  They'd had him in shorts and boots and he'd never been more embarrassed in his life.
"You're gonna ace it!  Break a leg!" Taylor told him, hands up in the air.
"Hey Steve! How was your night with DeSoto?" Hal grabbed his arm, pulling him over. Donner looked uncomfortable. Hal's eyes were glinting. "You get him all independent and thinking on his own? Will his Alpha be horrified?" Hal's collar was white and thin today, barely even visible. Steve was sure he wouldn't be able to get away with something like that; they wanted it to be clear on Captain America.
Steve braced a hand on the doorway before he made himself reach for the door. Was that Tony's voice? His heart leapt in his chest. He managed to get his fingers around the door handle and push it open.
His omega scampered to his side and held up a poster.
Steve sighed in frustration and ducked his head down. "So what do I do? I can't do nothing."
"Mine's a StarkTech IV.  We're probably gonna roll them out sometime next year."
In downtown Los Angeles, Bonaventure is a real place and on the 34th floor there really is a revolving restaurant, called the Bona Vista lounge.  I'm happy to report it's not "Alphas only" and is actually quite welcoming, so if you're ever in town, check it out.  And the crème brûlée there really is incredible.  I highly recommend it.  Also in this chapter, Bethany Cabe, ladies and gentlemen... plus an Iron Man 1 Easter Egg.  - T
"I said I'm sorry.  I'm sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't know." Tony walked over and slipped an arm around Steve, the liquor making him a lot more emotional than he'd normally be.  "I didn't know any of this. I'm an Alpha, I've always been around Alphas, it's only 'cause of Steve I know anything. But now I want to help fix things for you guys.  It's not fair, how omegas are treated. I wanna help."
Eventually, he let go of Tony. His fingers trailed over the inside of the other's wrist before he pulled away entirely. Steve smirked subtly and went to go fill the kettle up to boil. "Grab us both a mug, will you? Cupboard to your right."
"A host of things, sir, depending on the color.  Enduring love, elegance, refinement, regality, abundance--"
"But you'd like it?" Steve pushed as he pressed his thumb against the tree, a wedge of bark digging into his skin. "Wouldn't you?  Would it be enough for you to leave him alone?"
He was in a chair.
Steve set the boxes down, carefully lifting the model off the top and setting it down on a clear table space. With curiosity, seeing as he had the opportunity, he reached into the box to pull out the shield prototype. Steve immediately pulled a face as he held it in his hands. It felt all wrong. "This isn't anything like my shield," he said and set it back down.
"...I didn't say anything about her being a girl."
"...I don't think that's what she meant," replied Sam, watching her race off.
"Every hour. No baby. Got it!" Steve repeated, his eyes glassy. He didn't feel sad, all of a sudden; he just felt shy. He felt like curling on himself in the corner of the room and hiding his head in his arms.  "Tony," Steve whined. "I don't like it in here.  Can we go to the lodge now?  I want ice.  Please.  I'm too hot.  I want ice.
He sipped his coffee, sprinkling his breakfast onto the ground, watching the birds peck at it, lounging casually inside the donut.  The curve was comfortable enough that he could probably sleep up here.  It was a more appealing idea than going home to his ruined house, where Steve was probably spitting mad at him.  Tony's stomach flipped over and Tony pretended it was because of the hangover and not because of Steve.  Steve wasn't even in heat anymore, and Tony still felt an insane urge to impress and protect him.
, Colonel.  It's to save him," begged Steve.
Can you forward all of my fan mail and stuff?  Oh!  And call Rolling Stone. I'll let them interview us- they've always been good to me.  We're also willing to do Larry King, The Late Show, and Ellen."
After he'd finished, he lay there, snuggled up in a pile of Steve's sheets, contemplating his own curiosity.  The only person who had ever captured his interest like this was Pepper.  He didn't know what it was about Steve.  He was attractive, yes, and Tony was sucker for blonds, but there were lots of beautiful blonds lining up to sleep with him.  Steve was an omega, sure, but there were other omegas in the world.  Steve was built like a Chip n' Dale's dancer, but it wasn't like there weren't other equally athletic men in the world, with chiseled torsos and perfectly proportioned abs.  So why Steve?  Tony had no idea.  Maybe it was all those things combined.  Maybe some other unmeasurable, unobservable force.  Some deep, deep part of Tony was attracted to Steve in an intense and unshakeable way.  He knew he wanted Steve in the same way he could sense when Pepper was disappointed or when someone was standing right behind him or when he met two Alphas and could immediately identity which was more dominant.  He just
He brought one big plate in for both of them and smiled at Tony's dozy expression as he saw Steve in just his underwear with a mountain of pancakes in hand and two forks. "Hey," he murmured and moved to sit on the edge of the bed.
"How bad is it?  Give it to me straight," said Tony, concentrating on helping Steve out of his uniform.
No, of course he hadn't.  Steve should have known better.  Bucky would never hurt him.
"Ladies first," said Tony, gesturing.
Tony sulked.  "Why would they chip it?  Who's trying to spy on us?  I mean, we're honeymooning, it's not like we're going to be talking about top-secret SHIELD plans.  We're just going to be screwing like weasels."
?"  Tony threw a wrench across the room.  It hit one of his cars, but he didn't care.
Tony face was still buried in one hand in embarrassment, his other clutching his scotch.
"You asshole, you grew down!"
Steve's face was stony. "I'm not sure there's even somewhere there to get back to."
The soldier felt terribly confused.  Relief flooded him when he heard the sound of footsteps in snow approaching.  His body was going stiff with the cold, and so was the omega's beneath him. Luckily his left arm didn't have that problem; his grip remained firm.
," read Tony.  "Aw, they think I'm a beloved hero!"
Tony stared at him in shock, and then drew himself up.  His expression resolved into one of smug yet polite agreement.  "Fine. I'm a man of integrity and you did win me, fair and square.  Which car?"
Steve smiled down at the screen.
In the hospitality suite, every omega had reacted to Steve leaving like he'd just dropped his pants in front of everyone, with a mixture of horror and fascination.  The Alphas looked over, equally horrified at this breach of protocol. No one quite seemed to know how to react. Call security? Security was no match for Captain America.
, Mr. Stark, that I
He plucked a drink from someone's hand and downed it, wading through the crowd toward Pepper.  She'd keep him in line. Holy fuck, he didn't need this sort of temptation. If he didn't know better he would swear Steve was messing with him, but that wasn't Steve's style, he knew.
the crazy one," said DeSoto.  "I'm his second omega... I don't wanna end up like Trickshot.  No way I'm going out. Mr. Stark won me, fair and square, so I'm staying right here.  And-- and if you wanna beat me up you'll just have to do it here.
Steve was on a stage in front of a room of people, mostly reporters, but he couldn't see them well because the stagelights were blinding.  Tony was two paces behind him, standing there with his hands clasped in front of him, looking a bit like a Secret Service agent in his sunglasses.
Sam and Natasha grabbed him at the same time; Tony's eyes were wide and glassy.
than to listen to Steve talk about his experience waking up.  Imagining the shock as he met Agent Coulson and Agent Barton, two omegas whose status hadn't put a dent into their professional careers; imagining Steve's face when he saw the old newspaper pictures of the first omega to attend college, the first omega vice president (they still hadn't had an omega president yet), the first omega astronaut.  Watching newsreels of omegas voting, mixing into society like they'd always been a part of it.  Having the right to choose not to have children, getting suppressants and going off into the workforce instead.
"You were a good person to wake up to," he whispered. "You were so good Phil. So patient and I never thanked you for that...I just resented all of you for keeping me in quarantine. Though of course I know why you did it. It's why I accepted this mission in the first place; I was so goddamn desperate to get out..."
"C'mon, Steve, you can't let this ruin your day.  Let's grab a shower and then go downstairs to have breakfast with everyone... Donner needs your influence.  He needs to see omegas like you and Banksy and George being people instead of slaves."
Tony leaned in a little to press his lips against the corner of Steve's mouth.
. There was no SHIELD here. No Winter soldier. Just him and Tony.
"You have nothing to be embarrassed about Steve," Phil assured him. Donner wailed in the background. "Will he be okay?"
"No.  Absolutely not," said Tony immediately, before anyone else could speak.
"He's in the gym?  Before noon?  What is he, crazy?" asked Tony, rising dizzily, kicking away the sheets.
"It's like you're high." Aria peered at him, checking his eyes, just to be sure, before she got out by her apartment.
"Sure," Steve breathed and leaned down to kiss Tony's cheek with a smile still on his face. "And the reason there's no coffee is because you stopped paying me," he pointed out in a whisper against Tony's cheek before he pulled away.
Finally, gently, Tony reached around to take Steve's jaw and tilt his head up.
Despite the injection, Donner was still a groaning, whimpering mess.  It was three in the morning and Donner was sweating, pale, and looked frankly deathly ill.
) understand the reason why Tony was always drinking.
-- would embarrass him in front of Steve.
He and Karpov were having one of their rare heart-to-hearts.
"It was easy," said Tony, standing over his desk, scrolling through the intercom transcripts.  "What's THOR?"
"Did you sleep with him?"
"Stark."
Tony whined in protest.  He'd been looking forward to fucking Steve on the ride over.
Yes.  Stan was his PA.  Good old Stan Rogers of Queens, New York, who had a BA in business administration and had been personally recommended to him by a couple of his pals at the Department of Defense.
The women on the television were still talking but Tony couldn't hear their words.  Anger was coursing through his veins, white-hot, anger and something else; how dare anyone touch his omega; how dare anyone try to hurt him?  It wasn't just a sense of protectiveness.  No.  It was a memory, a memory of two years ago, Afghanistan.  At the end, it wasn't about escape.  It as about cold, raw vengeance.  Tony had had every intention of going out in a blaze of glory if necessary, laying waste to his captors, as if, once he killed them, he could regain what they had taken.
"Soldier! Watch out!"
Steve leaned forward; the omegas looked fascinated.  He had their attention.  "Well..." he began.
got a scar on my neck."  It was the first time Tony had ever acknowledged it in a casual way.
She lobbed the face plate at him.  He managed to catch it without dropping Steve.  Stupid move on her part. Now he could dispose of her and take Steve all for himself!
He realized in an instant the mistake he'd made.  The air was sweet and musky and it made his whole body go simultaneously weak and rigid.  His arms broke out in goosebumps and the hair on the back of his neck spiked.
"Let's make a deal, Captain.  I have some friends who are waiting for Donner to return home to pick him up.  When he comes home, they will take him. And if you would like him back, you may come and earn him.  You understand that I hardly believe you're going to follow through with this... which is why I am taking my Donnie as collateral.  It's up to you if you want me to return him." Gideon's voice softened a little more. "I have to say, I'm extremely intrigued by your offer.  You always struck me as too proud. But perhaps I was wrong about you. ...well, I have to go speak with my lawyer, as, you can imagine, I am currently hemorrhaging money thanks to you.  But perhaps you might like to discuss Donner's safe return over drinks when you get back. ...have you ever been to the Providence hotel? ...I'm sure I could make time for you." Gideon's voice dropped just a little more.  "You do understand that this is not a game, Captain. There is no clever little trick you can play on me. I'm taking Donner and if you try to do anything for me, other than kneel, I will make sure he pays dearly for it. So please, if you don't plan on being a good little spade for me, then don't waste my time."
Fury knew for certain there were two people he could trust: Maria Hill and Phil Coulson.  He and Maria had been partners for ages, and Phil might as well have been bonded to his job.
"Not your fault, Steve," Tony murmured, stroking the mating mark on the back of Steve's neck.  It was still healing.  "You can't save everyone. You tried..."
But that wasn't what Tony was saying. He was saying Steve was...he shivered when his Alpha ran a foot up his leg, blue eyes darkening a fraction.
Steve and
When Steve woke up he felt
Pepper was dialing Dr. Gleason and muttering curses under her breath, most of them directed at Tony.
He texted Natasha:
Oh, God.
Pepper's jaw dropped.  She stared at Tony incredulously.  It wasn't uncommon that Alphas would attack omegas, take advantage of them, and then later, when charges were pressed, claim they couldn't help it, that they were feral, out of their minds, and that the omegas had been at fault in the first place.  It was 2010 but omegas were often still treated with contempt.  Pepper had always thought of herself and Tony as above that, assumed the "I lost control" argument was one of weak, impulsive Alphas who just wanted to have a good time.  But there was no doubt in her mind that if she and Happy hadn't been there, Tony would have taken Steve without a moment's hesitation.
to be a secret meeting," Steve murmured. "I thought it would be our chance to...work stuff out, you know? For the sake of SHIELD we need to get on better, me and Nick, and I thought this was just a casual meeting.  Well... if anything good came out of it, maybe now we finally will... we both saved each other's asses. Maybe that counts for something. I don't know.  And why wouldn't HYDRA want me?" Steve sighed. "They want the serum, remember?"
"...forming a non-profit takes, like, a while," said Tony, trying to remember.  "I think it's a one or two month
Steve distantly wondered if he should drink at all. Him getting drunk didn't go too well last time.  And Aria had warned him about how famous people always tried to outdo each other.
What Natasha had said about cheating the test rang true with him and he'd decided to dedicate himself fully to passing the psych eval.  He had already begun using JARVIS to study compounds to counteract the drugs, to compile lists of breathing exercises, to find ways to manage anxiety and dream lucidly and resist hypnosis.  Tony felt that if anyone had the mental fortitude to completely and totally nail the psych evaluation, it was him.
puke on you, you freak out!"
Steve dressed plainly in black dress pants and a crisp white shirt, not wanting to look too formal in a party atmosphere. He knew Tony was already drinking too much but was also mostly powerless to stop him. It was the guy’s birthday, after all.
"Dani, another double," he demanded, sticking out the empty martini glass, sucking on one of the olives.  "Extra dirty."
"Who, the guy on the train?" asked Tony, perched on the end of the couch.  Natasha had led them to a nice room, cozy, quaint... Tony made a mental note that he should treat her
"Impossible.  They're simply hiding."
"Thank you very much... uhh... I wanna say... Samantha?" he guessed.
"I feel like I could sleep forever," he murmured and wiggled against Tony lazily in a playful manner. Steve knew he would drift off if they stayed like this. But they did also have several hours until the auction. He also couldn't stop smiling.
Happy began to slow down as they neared a church and graveyard. He graveyard looked huge, a lot of the memorials elaborate and fancy in form. There was countless statues of men and angels and there was no grave without a headstone. Pepper sat up in her seat and Happy wordlessly moved to turn the radio off. There were a few minutes of silence.
"We need to find the hospital wing," Steve whispered to Tony. "They could be doing operations right now! We need to stop them before the fuck up anyone else."
Steve," she said, sounding impatient. They played this game a lot. Steve moved to sit on a couch with a sigh. He hated talking about himself like this, especially with a stranger. How on earth did people find this
Pair bond jobs being threatened he could deal with. But Yemen was bigger than him. And if anyone tried to execute any of his friends, especially Natasha, he would happily go rogue to save her. The mental institute thing though... Steve couldn't exactly argue with that. Oh, his ma would kill him if she could see him now.
"They are, Captain Rogers."
"Yeah... yeah, I think I won... I'll finish him off in a sec... I need a drink..."
...Taylor Swift.  Right. The omega pop girl who had “tweeted” at Steve.  So that was Aria’s big surprise.
He was still hiding it from Pepper.  She was not thrilled with his appearance in the office but Tony had to work on the RT node; besides, he pointed out to her several times, no one on conference calls could see what he was wearing.
"I was thinking maybe you could go back to the Times for your next one. They wrote the first article I sent over in the list. And then move onto tv stuff, maybe with Ellen. Oh, and I'm guessing you haven't heard? About the badges?"
Tony took a few steps to close the gap between him and Steve.  He looked up at the blond and nuzzled his jaw. "Don't ever stop being a stubborn, uppity omega who doesn't know his place," he said quietly, smiling.  He ran a hand down Steve's side, waited until his expression had softened a little, then blurted out, "I didn't pick out anything to wear even though I said I did last week."  He offered Steve one of his helpless grins.
"I'm great.  I've got a new ticker, and I'm bonded, and Hammer's been arrested; everything's great.  It's like Christmas.  Say hi to my mate, Pepper."
"That's the million-dollar question, isn't it?"
Aria saw Tony looking a little lost with the baby and took pity on him. She walked over with her tablet and thrust it at him. "Here. Swap," she said. She took the baby with well-practiced ease. "I'm an auntie to twins," she explained simply and then nodded at the tablet. "Watch it. Then you might get what's going on here."
"Pepper, turn around so Steve can get dressed," he demanded.
Tony rubbed his eyes, pushing his glasses up momentarily, then blinked, stifling a yawn.  His brow furrowed. "Are you... are you in heat?"
Natasha's eyes narrowed.  "No," she said flatly.
He was clawing at the surface of consciousness, trying to surface; he couldn't breathe; he needed that fucking arc reactor.
“Oh, thank God, Rhodey!  You have to protect me from temptation.  All these hot girls are trying to take a ride on the Tone Bone and I promised Steve I’d be monogamous like, literally five minutes ago.”
Slowly, cautiously, a hand snuck out and stole the plate. There was a moment of hesitation before a "thanks" was mumbled.
They all piled into the two cars they had waiting for them. Aria handed Steve a tablet in his free hand. "The billboards are almost ready to go up," she told him excitedly. "The photoshoot has had great ratings. They're releasing the new range next month officially and you're its main face. They're paying you a lot. I'll direct it all to the 84 fund."
"Y'know, the clanger!  The part inside the bell!  I bought the clanger!" said Tony with a pleased grin.  "...that's what it's called, right? The clanger?"
"...Pepper, pour booze into my face until I pass out," demanded Tony.  "I can't deal with this.  I can't.  You don't know what it's like.  I can..."  God, this was embarrassing.  She had no idea.  "...I can smell him.  I'm losing it.  Liquor me up, will you?  I can't be conscious around him, he smells..."  He smelled like everything good in the world.  He smelled like sunshine pouring through the window on a late, lazy morning, one where he and Steve would lie tangled and sweaty and spent on the bed together, fingers laced together, smiling silently at each other, finally satisfied.  The smell was a promise.  A promise of utter, complete pleasure and comfort and fulfillment.  That scent was mouth-wateringly alluring and Tony ached for it.  He wanted to taste Steve.
"Why not?" echoed the girl behind him, stepping forward.  The snow made soft squeak-crunches beneath her boots. She pulled her hands out of her pockets and wriggled her fingers, like she was trying to warm them up.  And suddenly Steve was struck with a sense of... yes, that was exactly the word for it, warmth. It wasn't a comfortable warmth, but the kind of sharp warmth that preceded a heat or a battle.  It made him feel jittery, and a little sick, and slightly disoriented.
"Oh, God, no.  No, no, no," said Tony, shaking his head with an awkward laugh.  "No, I've been meaning to talk to my doctor about a vasectomy, actually.  I got one when I was nineteen in Tijuana but I guess it didn't take... kind of creepy, actually.  I've had seventeen paternity suits so far but none were mine yet. Knock on wood."
Ian snorted loudly.  "Is that what they called it?  A
Steve's words went in one ear and out the other.  Tony got another drink while Steve was accosted by Brent Walker, Jeffrey Walker's mate.  Tony had expected a bit more venom between Brent, an Alpha, and Banksy and Tiberius, but Brent almost immediately won everyone over by whipping out dozens of baby pictures and going on and on his twin girls.  (How much could you say about newborns, anyway? They couldn't even talk, thought Tony with annoyance.)
He played with Steve's zipper temptingly, and found himself thinking, inexplicably, about how much better their second heat would be, now that they actually knew what the fuck they were doing.  Sort of. He wondered if he could get Steve to wear the collar. Definitely, if he asked Steve in heat. But he should probably ask beforehand. Steve couldn't be expected to say anything meaningful in heat, any more than he could when Tony pressed his scent glands.
"You're being sued.  A bunch.  How's your heart?" she asked, nodding to the arc reactor.
"I need to go test out the Mark VI."
Steve scurried down the stairs into the shop, but paused when he came to the landing, keeping his gaze on the floor out of respect. He could feel how much Tony was hurting- he didn't need to see it, too. He walked over silently, almost shaky with nerves in front of his Alpha. Because Tony was
"Erm." Steve had been to a few pubs when he'd been here before (but none had been as nice as this). "A pint of Guinness, please."
"Well, it's up to Steve. Not SHIELD, so..." Aria shrugged, beginning to get annoyed with him.
And he never had. From day one, Gideon had bought Donner because he
Steve looked up, fingers steepled under his chin. "These people are
Boswell was already removing it.  "I'm not wearing this."
" shrieked Justin again.  He actually stamped his foot in anger.  Tony had Jack in a chokehold and had no intention of letting him go because it was the only insurance he had, currently.  The man's fingers were prying weakly, desperately, against the unyielding metal arm wrapped around him.
He hopped into the Aston (who the fuck cared if he left Morgan alone in his house?), drove back to Westwood (who the fuck cared if he got another DUI?), parked illegally (who the fuck cared if he got towed?), and went up to Steve's apartment to demand forgiveness.
He hadn't felt this raw, this woken, for a long, long time.  Longer than he could possibly remember. He felt like he was just waking from a terrible dream and everything was shockingly clear, so much clearer than the uncanny fuzziness of the dream.
"I didn't arm them," he rolled his eyes a little. "But I did tell them they should walk out."
fucking Expo, isn't it?  My name's all over it.  Pep says it's one giant ego trip.  Like that's a bad thing."  He sighed, still rubbing his cheek on Steve's neck, not really thinking.  It was automatic.  He wanted his omega to smell like him.
Tony swore mentally at himself for the slip.  "...I only heard a little bit when I first tuned in," he lied.  "Hey, speaking of eavesdropping, guess who got ahold of SHIELD's intercom records?  Wanna see what Clint is up to in New Mexico?"  He gave Steve another tug.  "Or we can go have a celebratory fuck in the pool."  He turned around and wrapped his arms around Steve's waist, resting his head on Steve's chest to listen to his heartbeat.
thrilled with that one... oh!  And everyone applaud Rex, thanks for holding up all those sexy diagrams for me, Rex..."
Tony leaned in to catch Steve's lips in an affectionate nip, sucking briefly before letting him go.
got you the cake," interjected Aria.  "It was Tony's idea to put ninety-three candles on it, which Pepper and I vetoed because we didn't think burning down the house would make a very good birthday."
Despite all of Steve's complaints Tony had heard-- that Bucky hadn't respected him, hadn't loved him, had refused to mate him-- they had still been bonded.  Or still were.  Whatever.  Tony would prefer if Barnes were dead, but talking about it wasn't doing Steve any favors.
If Steve had read up on these things, or if Tony had, they'd both know it was normal for a omega to feel a lull after the high of a heat. And maybe Steve had felt it too, when Tony was outside with Pepper... a tiny flutter of that feeling had triggered a strange and repetitive memory. He and Bucky had had that argument so many times.
"So what did you mean, earlier, you're not into twenty-first omega rights?" asked Trey, leaning onto the counter curiously.  "You're
"Steve, come on!"
"Steve, come on-" Natasha was tugging the scientist back towards the stairs. "We gotta go."
"Well, they didn't have that procedure in his day," said Pepper patiently.  "Steve is fine, Tony, and so is Tiberius. He's a very big name in omega rights now, which you'd know if you ever bothered to read anything other than stocks and tech news.  What's done is done, okay? We don't cry over spilled milk in this house. Now pull yourself together and go take a nap. I'm going to need your signature on about half of these forms."  She gestured to the stack of papers before them.
"If you ever
"If you're not careful you're going to lose him," Phil said to Fury, voice still gentle like it had been with Steve and then he moved to grab a glass of water off the tray outside. Then he moved to pour it over Tony's head, snapping him out of his daze.
.  It feels like... not good. He must be watching
Steve went downstairs to cook up some dinner to find there was almost no food in the house.  He pulled out of his phone and ordered them two pizzas; he was feeling too lazy to cook. It took less than half an hour to arrive. The first pizza didn't last very long; he ate it in under ten minutes, working out in his head how long Tony had been in the lab.  All day, it seemed.  At least six hours.
Tony winced.  He'd told Steve earlier he wasn't squeamish but he was now rethinking that statement.
He pressed a kiss to Tony's shoulder, the nearest available spot. Steve could feel a slight twinge between his thighs but the ache would be gone by dinner time at the latest. And it would be fine if all they were doing today was paying Churchill and this Wisdom guy a visit.
Tony grabbed Steve's arm.  Steve's comment, about him being a "shitty Alpha, " cut deep.  But when Steve turned to look at him, Tony couldn't bring himself to admit that.
decision?"  He chuckled again.
The performance was quite something, and Steve was impressed even though he had admittedly witnessed similar calls before. George was terribly good at conducting his voice to just the right pitch. Angela, a small blonde beta, had tried a few phone calls herself, but usually just ended up swearing at them.
Tony wished, briefly, someone would give Steve something to guard so he'd feel useful without being in danger.
Tony frowned.  Maybe he'd just call the number on the pamphlet and ask a few questions without attending.  That couldn't hurt. Besides, he had all day Saturday, since Steve was going to be hanging out with Clint, doing whatever omegas did together.
look great?" he asked with a coyness he hadn't known he was capable of.  He was still buzzing off of his run and Tony was naked in front of him. He was only human. Or, only super human. Whatever. He was almost stood between Tony's legs now, his Alpha taller than him like this. If Steve tilted his head up just right he'd feel Tony's breath on his cheek. "Because that's not very nice, if you are..."
Tony put his hand over Steve's on the lever.  "You could drink straight ethanol," he said.  His tone was serious.
Alpha, and now he was behaving.
The other omega was grinning ear-to-ear; she caught Pietro's eye and gave him a cocky little salute.
"Pietro and Wanda came," Steve whispered. "They wanted revenge still. It seems they ignored my advice. SHIELD have taken them in now." He sighed and the noise was half a whine.
"It's amazing you're learning all this Tony. We're going to need every detail before we can attack them, and I want to be ready for my birthday." Maybe it was strange, but Steve liked the idea of doing it on his birthday. He would get a lot of media attention around his birthday anyway, he might as well make the most of it. He pressed a quick kiss to the other's shoulder before they stepped back out into the crowds.
So first he would get high again, and manic. And then he would get horny. Wonderful.
Tony stuffed his hands into his pockets, not wanting to hold Steve's. Not because he didn't want to, but because he didn't want Steve to think he was scared or needed the comfort.  Hell, he'd nearly
"He hasn't slept in days. You won't wake him. He's best left to it. He'll be knocked out for a while," Steve assured her, and the doctor finally tore her gaze away from his mate.
Deep down,
America.  You showed them that already.  You and me, and SHIELD... we're all gonna kick some ass, okay?  They surprised you once but that's not going to happen again."
"...mind you, I like the idea.  There are a lot of omega runaways, too."
"...Still have what?  ...What are you guys talking about?" asked Tony, looking back and forth between them.  The way Natasha and Steve were talking, like there was some secret code, things they didn't want Tony to know... it was bothering him.  A lot.  " ...Steve? ...Steve?"
!" said Fury, rolling Bucky's limp body off of him.  He rose, dusting off his leather jacket. "I thought you said he was in his right mind, Rogers!"
He could still remember killing Schmidt. Steve could still remember the sound his shield made as it sliced through and snapped his spine in two. He could still hear the sickening wet snap that had followed and how it good it felt to have the Alpha shuddering as he died beneath him. Steve has probably enjoyed it more than he should have but the forced heat had left him aroused and confused and too hot all over.
They ended up in the cafeteria on base. The food was okay, and dirt cheap. And they always had a good muffin selection (Steve's favourite was banoffee, it was to die for). Natasha and Sam got pre-made, pre-wrapped sandwiches. Steve followed suit and got a BLT, fully intending to demolish a muffin too before he left and hoping that they'd give Tony a break for lunch, too.
"That's the last of it," Gleason said softly, after the fifth time. "Well done Steve."
Malick's smile vanished.  "...getting right to business I see.  I admire that. So, Captain. I'm sure you're aware of the reason for this meeting.  SHIELD is, of course, well aware by now of the identity of the Winter Soldier, and of your unique history with him."  He paused. "...not that it's really
Tony looked over at Steve uncertainly, torn between desperately wanting to air out his neck and not wanting to give Maggie Frond any satisfaction.  He was starting to wonder whether they really wanted to sit in on this workshop or not. Maggie Frond looked like she wanted to make an example of Steve.  But Tony didn't want to walk away, like a coward. And also, he was genuinely worried about Donner and Piper. Piper was just a kid. And Donner... poor Donner seemed so cowed, yet Maggie and Gideon both spoke like Donner had once actually been a real person with an actual personality.
With horror, Tony realized what this must seem like from DeSoto's fucked up point of view.  Tony had been acting more and more Alphaish, hanging out with other Alphas, and Steve was clearly mis-behaved...
"Until they find a solution that isn't cryo sleep, yes, probably."
She was clearly stressed about this, had clearly thought about it a lot... Aria was almost shaking. She brought her cigarette to her lips and took another drag. "Tony's under a lot of pressure right now. A lot of mates don't like it when their O might be stealing the spotlight. They won't
"And Steve is still a soldier," Aria pointed out. Sitwell hummed noncommittally in agreement. "I'm sorry...who are you?" She asked, narrowing her eyes at Sitwell of a sudden. She was in a blue leather jacket today with a high collar that made her look rather menacing as she stared him down.
Tony stared at him, not able to formulate words yet.  His overwhelming emotion was still one of rage.  But there was embarrassment, too.  He hadn't needed an omega's help.  He was confident he could have settled the fight himself.
She made Phil a hot chocolate and left it just outside the den for him. It felt wrong to step inside it. It was
going to fight.
.  And the Winter Soldier program... well.  Someone has to say it. Might as well be me.  I think he's too close to this."
He didn't actually have a plan for what he would do when Steve came, whether he'd spit it out or swallow it.  He hadn't thought that far ahead. Although now would probably be a good time to consider it, since Steve was swelling in his mouth and twitching and spasming under him and he was tasting Steve's fluids.  Steve consistently swallowed but, again, Steve was a rather more considerate lover than Tony.
"Thanks," Steve laughed. "Think I'm gonna need it." Then he hung up, pushing his phone into his pocket before he moved to grab his collar. He was putting it on when DeSoto spoke up.
She pulled the photograph and the dogtags out of her pocket and offered them to Steve.
meant.
"So, Trickshot, huh!" said Tony with delight.
he trembled. Steve nuzzled against the side of his neck, panting against the skin there, his teeth grazing skin softly. He wanted to be good for him, good for his Alpha. Steve rocked his hips down, inviting him in, his thighs quivering a little at the intrusion. "Bucky," he choked out, voice broken. "Please."
Steve stood without a wobble, taking Tony's hand but not putting too much  weight on it. "The kids? They're good..." Steve said, struggling to switch back to what they were talking about before. "Well," Steve glanced back at the kids. He waved. They all waved back. Then he turned to Tony. "I'm going to save all of them--" He raised a hand before Tony could protest. Steve smiled. "But that doesn't require buying a single one of them."
Tony reached out wearily and dragged a blanket over them.  "Send him up," he said. Tony, unlike Steve, was used to having lucid conversations while balls-deep in another person.  He looked down, saw Steve's expression, and rolled his eyes. "Fine... hold on..."
Having set politics aside, the rest of the lunch was a polite affair, with Tony and T'Chaka and Steve making idle chit-chat.
"It's okay, Steve, we're going to fix this," said Pepper soothingly, still stroking him.  "JARVIS, can I get an administrative override?"
"I thought it was very brave of you to tell everyone," Steve murmured, staring down at the red liquid in the bottom of the Doctor Who mug he'd been given.
"No promises," said Steve.
To Pepper's credit, she didn't react.  "Well, regardless of who it was,
Steve wrapped an arm Tony's shoulders and squeezed lightly.
Steve thought about the articles and his heart swelled in his chest. He hoped Tony would proud of it too. "There's more stuff out in the news. Also an omega hate crime I should probably comment on, but that can wait for the morning."
Tony had already noted where the kitchen was.  Actually he was interested in raiding the fridge.  But he didn't want to seem like he wasn't taking this seriously.
Steve let out a sigh of relief as he moved to sit on the hospital bed. "Tony needs looking at too," he protested and winced as the doctor poked at his shoulder which was bruising beautifully underneath his shirt. "I dislocated it against the wall," he told told her, "but then I clicked it back."
The brief image of Johann Schmidt being beheaded flashed behind his eyes. It must have felt cold, Steve realized numbly, just before his shield cut through flesh.
Donner shook his head, staring down at the bottle in his hands. "They're very angry at him," he whispered. "He doesn't understand how it works.  but it's not his fault."
Pepper had easily done this several dozen times.  Most of those times had occurred in the nineties.  Tony's early thirties had been a roller-coaster ride.
Status Alliance was certainly more Steve's style than the Horseshoe Society, but he didn't want to alienate any potential allies by picking a side. He sighed quietly and ran a hand over his face.
and you'd better
He stalked back toward the quiet backstage area, still pressing the cloth over his split lip, furious with Steve for breaking up the fight and furious with himself for not doing more damage when he had the chance.
Tony stood up on his toes and bent Steve's head down to began carefully playing with it, adding gel and moving bits around with his fingers.  He grabbed some hairspray and then stood back to examine his work. "...that's about as good as it's gonna get, Stevie," said Tony, reaching out and giving his cheek a few gentle pats.  "Honestly, though, you're always a nine out of ten even on your worst days. Don't worry about it."
He was taken back by the question and honestly quite confused by it. Steve knew that Banksy had had an arranged bonding when he was young and he imagined that it couldn't have been fun. Honestly, when he read about it it had made his stomach turn. But Steve's relationship wasn't like that...was it? Sure, they had a shaky start but they were both shaky people. Considering all their baggage Steve felt like they'd done alright. Did other people not think they'd done alright?
Tony eased back a little, taking a moment just to admire Steve, his forearms and head down, his body smooth and well-proportioned.  Unimaginably fit and also unmistakably omega. Or maybe that was just Tony smelling him. Pheromones had a pretty extreme effect on a person's perception, if they were statused, anyway.  A beta probably wouldn't have been able to tell, would have assumed that those muscles meant Steve was a dominant Alpha, even though there was no real correlation between dominance and physical appearance.
"Agreed," said Tony immediately.
"No," he laughed gently as he stood and walked back over to the suitcase, bending down to search through it with a shit-eating grin on his face, ears red with embarrassment. "He gave it to me before I even met you. Said he felt weird having my clothes, because when I was dead they were collectibles or whatever... but once I was alive they were rightfully mine.  I think he thinks they're hanging up in the closet.  Pretty sure if he saw this he would bury us both alive."
"Whenever you're ready." David nodded and Steve swallowed. The stark red blood against pale sheets was hardly inviting. A little woodenly, he moved to lie down, legs bent. Awkwardly, he pulled off his pants (bloody too, like the sheets) and dropped them on the floor, his robe at least offering him some decency.
"I'm fine," said Tony.  He glanced at Steve.  "I'm... I'm at a friend's.  Oh.  And I made a new element.  Look, it's a long story, and I was about to take a nap.  Let's do brunch tomorrow.  I'll tell you all about it."
"They might have been able to work out that it was Steve's heat," Dr. Brazinski said. "His mind would be more pliable, more vulnerable, because of it. Just because they've done it tonight doesn't mean they could just do it in a week's time. They've been tactical about this."
"...он приходит?" asked Bucky hopefully.
Steve hated feeling so powerless. It wasn't that he would ever manipulate Tony, but he usually had quite a good sway over his emotions. Steve could usually make him feel better when he was down but he wasn't sure he could do anything this time. The whole drive back had been painful. He'd wanted to take Tony's hand but both of them remained firmly shoved into his pockets.
Pepper opened her mouth and said something but the words were swallowed by the noise from the crowd.  Steve knew some of her songs.
"Right; absolutely," Steve breathed.
Steve swallowed. "I'm not here to hurt you. I promise. We're here to help." He hesitated. "I know your brother."
"You've made your views on this very clear, Gideon," said Hawley brusquely.  "The Soldier is in custody and his location unknown to the captain, besides which he has the supervision of his other mate.  So at this time, it is not a concern. With regards to your movements-- we are not reinstating your passports."
DeSoto, sensing the tension, was still pawing at Tony's leg, his natural omega urge to nurture an Alpha, to make Tony feel better, as clear as the look of concern written on his face.  Tony was absently patting him, trying to impart some calm; he felt nothing but pity for DeSoto.
?!" he called, trying to keep the tremor out of his voice.
"Right," Steve said, eyes on the director. His expression was blank and impassive, impossible to read. He looked over the scientists carefully. No more syringes, thank God.
in a way Bucky had never been, at least in a bonding sense. Bucky felt worlds away from Tony in every aspect; it almost seemed wrong to compare them.
at him…
"Steve?" Louis waved a hand in front of his face, his voice gentle. "Are you... with us?"
Then he turned and left with a slam of the door.
"They're mostly in the south now," Phil explained to him, unperturbed by Tony and Ty's mini-fight. "The south are always playing catch up, I’ve found. I've never been in one myself. It’s generally outside of SHIELD’s jurisdiction.  I don't really know what they do to someone in there; they’re fairly hush-hush about their methods. They were a lot more medieval back in the eighties and nineties. I assume they no longer resort to surgical intervention, but again, I don’t really know what they do."
"Well, I'm not."
"...did you guys ever... do anything?"
Steve didn't really know why but he
"And you're supposed to be guarding the cube.  We had another team on cryo."
"I'm a good shot."
"'Course I'll be there," said Tony gruffly.  "It's
... but yes, Steve could sing. Not well, but not terribly, either. And everyone in the room was drunk so what the hell did it matter anyway?
"Is Steve gonna be okay?" demanded Tony, tugging the decanter out of her hand.  She let him have it.
"Look," said Tony suddenly.
He reached out to finger the mark.  It was red, still healing, but it
The soldier finished his task and let go of Steve, dropping him to the floor to pass the samples through the door; the scientist took them gratefully, along with the remains of the syringes Steve had smashed.  The Bucky from before had vanished again, replaced by the soldier.
"Good boy... good boy, take it... here it is...
been there seventy years ago, and even if he could have, he wouldn't have added much to Steve's defense; Steve was more than capable.
Steve's head was bowed, so Tony couldn't see his face, but he had an idea Steve's expression was one of ecstasy.  Certainly, that was how Tony felt.  It was so strange to him.  They hadn't touched, hadn't kissed; this was as thrilling as anything he'd ever experienced and yet it was not sexual, at least not conventionally; admittedly, Tony was rock-hard; he could smell Steve's lust; but neither of them were rushing, there was a right way to do this, one that Tony knew somehow, had always known.
Tony was clearly in a much better mood.  His parents' anniversary was over and it would be a whole year before he had to go stand there at their graves again.  And today, he would get to see Steve Rogers in a collar, the idea of which was so scintillating that it was largely overshadowing other thoughts.
"George?" DeSoto half guessed. "It begins with a 'G'."
"Of course." Steve kissed Tony's cheek and then pulled away to rummage through the bathroom cabinet. He found some non-scented lotion and went back to kneel by the bed. He gently rubbed it into heated skin, hoping it would ease some of the irritation. Steve didn't know why he felt so bad for it-- it wasn't like he'd made the omegas wear collars in the first place-- but still...
.  It had been a surprisingly violent series that centered on Captain America taking out various baddies, mostly the Soviets.
"He's down.  For now."
The man swung but hit nothing but air; Pietro had already moved.  He swung a second time; Pietro had already moved again. He caught the man's ankle with his foot and dropped him, then, lightning-fast, got in three sharp jabs on his face.
"I don't
"Of course. Mum's the word though," Joey held a finger to his lips and winked. "You need any help over here, anything we can do... you  just let us know."
He brought Steve's hand up and kissed the back of it, softly.  "I'm not going anywhere, omega," he said quietly, reassuring. And he meant it.
A couple of dolphins jumped out of the water at him, but he outstripped them almost immediately.
"It's a very good picture. Good likeness," Phil added, his voice a little more high pitched than usual. "Steve? Have you broken your hand? Looks painful."
"Steve," he whispered hoarsely.  "...omega..."  He reached for Steve's neck, to check if his mark was still there.  Of course it was.  Tony felt the slightest, slightest bit better.  Bonds didn't break.  He and Steve were still in this together.  At least they had that.  At least they had each other.
time around? That was the problem with Steve, wasn't it? He was the kind of omega every one admired...but no Alpha wanted.
"...it doesn't sound to me like there's anything to work out," said Tony after a moment.  "Look, Steve's not related to anyone with a metal arm, and he's bonded to
"Didn't know I wasn't allowed not to," retorted Clint.
you, Tony," Steve said, sounding amused. "When you're in heat, you feel... frustrated. It's like a junkie not getting their fix; it drives you crazy. So I've tore up a door, or two. But with you around I shouldn't feel the need to do that, you know?" he tried to assure him. The last thing Steve ever wanted to do was hurt Tony. The thought was abhorrent. But sometimes he simply didn't know his own strength, especially not in a heat. "Like I said, we'll figure it out together when it comes to it."
Aria cleared her throat. "You guys have been offered an interview. A joint one. Banksy has also offered and we know he's on our side, what with his involvement in Status Alliance. But I didn't know if you wanted to.  You guys need space; I'm not going to shove you out there if you're not ready. I've literally only come around to run a few things by you and then I'll be out of your hair."
A shiver ran up his spine.
Steve looked up at Waffles. "Trickshot was very brave. And he deserved better. And if he had known how his Alpha was going to treat him before hand, I'll bet you he wouldn't have mated him."
Steve's phone had gone off as they were stumbling through the lounge; Tony grabbed it and the pills, shoving a blue one into Steve's hand, before staggering into the master bedroom and collapsing into bed.
"...whenever you're ready, Captain," said Phil gently.
"It's about eight-thirty.  There's probably been a ton of people all over the place, Steve.  Gardeners, delivery drivers, laundry, mail... but no one that's not supposed to be here.  ...no Axis powers," he joked lightly, reaching up to card his fingers through Steve's hair.  "Don't worry... this place has state-of-the-art security measures in place.  No one gets through those gates who isn't supposed to."
"This is a Wakandan variety you will not find anywhere else," said T'Chaka.  "We call it Panther's Eye. You see, the petals are black, but each have two yellow spots, here... like a panther's."
He took a while getting settled in. Steve had a long shower and dressed in a fresh set of clothes. Dark jeans and a navy sweatshirt. Then he unpacked the necessities. Toothbrush, computer and knife (courtesy of Natasha) which he left on the bedside. Getting it through airport security had been laughably easy.  Someone, thought Steve idly, oughta do something about that.
"No.  I want--"  Tony stopped mid-sentence and rose, head up.  Like a wolf that had just caught the scent of a particularly juicy deer.
He smiled and closed his eyes for a moment, enjoying the sensations, before he moved to curl his legs around Tony. "Come on, then. Come on," Steve said, sounding a little breathless. "Show me what I've been missing, Alpha. Fuck me."
"...fuck... I liked when you told me to shut up," said Tony, slightly dazed.
"Oh, I'll come with you, I need a drink too," said Tectonic
"I have an interview tomorrow morning, with the
"Happy, are you... are you taking Pepper home?" asked Tony with alarm.
Steve blinked in surprise and looked up at the question, genuinely considering the answer. But he didn't get up onto his knees. He realised, belatedly, that no one had ever asked him that before. "It never occurred to me that I had a choice," he said simply.  "It- it was 1935."
"Steve, you answered your own question.  You can't save someone who doesn't want it.  You can only give them a chance. And you don't always save everyone.  You're not a comic book superhero, Steve... sometimes, people get left behind," said Tony quietly.  "But the point is to get through to as many of them as you can. And the ones who need it most are gonna be the hardest.  Guys like George? They didn't really need you, Steve. George left Luke when he had a chance and he did it by himself. It's the ones like Donner who actually need your help."  He rubbed Steve's back against the cool Pacific wind. Steve was shuddering a little, perhaps crying silently. Tony didn't ask; he just held him and left him work on getting ahold of himself.  They had time to spare, after all. It would be several hours before they knew what Donner was going to do.
"Tony, give me the phone."  Steve was up on his feet and looking calmer than he had in hours. "Tony. Tony give me the phone." But the Alpha wasn't even listening to him. He was just growling. Jesus. They were fucking idiots.
Steve briefly glanced down at the tablet.
"I can go anywhere I want," replied the omega.  "Can you?"
!  I think I can get two and, y'know, I'm sort of the only one even
All of Hal's friends were young like her. The oldest looked to be twenty-five (sort of Steve's age). There was a dark haired guy with a weirdly neat mustache called Fred. A brunette women named Abigail, or 'Abby,' and a blonde women called Lola. All the names sounded fairly real. But it didn't surprise Steve that Hal had a more down to earth group of friends who had less insanely controlling Alphas. He noticed none of them wore especially elaborate collars, and that Hal's and Abby's were just made out of leather despite having locks on the back. They looked light and unimposing. These were the kind of omegas Steve could talk to, but not the ones who really needed his help.
Steve's hands clenched and unclenched by his sides.
"--guarding the tesseract, I know, I know.  But this is more important.  He's turning 93."
Tony knew pair-bonds went through a "honeymoon" phase when they were almost inseparable (and unbearable to nearly everyone else).  This must be what that felt like.  Just looking at Steve flooded Tony with affection.
She hovered by Tiberius before she left. "You've got a good right hook," Maria told him and then she pulled away, hands behind her back as she followed Fury out of the house.
, Aria, don't touch him, he's mine."
Donner because he looked like
"Unhand me," demanded Malick.  The sergeant holding him obeyed; Malick brushed his suit off, then looked over at Donner, accessing him.  Donner was enormous. Malick stared. "Donnie? ...when...?"
"Not sure I should be downstairs when Gideon gets here," Steve admitted. "There's a legitimate chance I might try and kill him. Or break his jaw."
The world paused for a moment as dust filled the room.  The party's guests all stood stock-still, some covered in dust, looking like statues except for their wide, white eyes.
Because he wasn't an especially dominant Alpha?  He couldn't help it; his mother was a beta, it was his nature, he couldn't change how he'd been born.  Or was it something else?  His constant trouble-making?  His imperfect tennis backhand?  Tony had spent probably over a thousand hours in tennis lessons at the club, and the only thing he had learned was that he loathed tennis.  He had even looked up the inventor of tennis in the hopes that the bastard had died young and of tragic, painful causes.  Unfortunately, he learned that Walter Wingfield had passed peacefully of natural causes at the age of 79.
Steve found two bugs. One in his living room and one in his bedroom. He smashed them under his feet. Before he knew what he was doing he was calling Pepper Potts.
!  You lost my mate!  Call the World Security Council!  Call the STRIKE team! Call... call the National Guard!  Call
them?  I beg your pardon?" demanded Pepper.
Last time Tony had done this Steve had practically cried because it had been too much. He had a funny feeling that round two wouldn't be all that different. He hissed softly, feeling himself getting wet from more than just Tony's tongue, his body responding eagerly.
"That was part of what I wanted to talk to you about.  Clint and Phil just went in to heat," said Natasha. "Steve, you have to be careful, it's really easy to-- give me a
Tiberius nodded, examining the bottles.
Steve twisted around just in time to kick the Winter Soldier's hand away, rolling across the snow and out of his grasp before he made to jump onto the next roof. But his ankle gave way as he jumped--
Was she threatening him?
"...your impromptu apology, while certainly... sincere... has the public believing that you have three Alphas," said Malick.  "As a matter of security, we do not think it would be wise to disclose the identity of the Winter Soldier."
"You're not Dr. McCane," said Tony immediately.  He'd come to like the aggressive omega quite a lot during the night.  The new doctor was an Alpha.  Tony's arm tightened a little around Steve.
"If you want an safe space for omegas, I can negotiate that. But you can't go into this with a biased against them. Deciding to stay at home is a fine choice for anyone to make so long as it's just that, a
"Tony?"
Steve searched around for his phone. His agent had sent him a link to another article. He opened it.
"Now what?" asked the omega.
"Pietro!" shrieked Wanda, scrambling across the floor towards her unconscious brother.  "Pietro!"
how attractive you are, every Alpha in there's probably got a thing for you... hell, even I had a poster of you in my room growing up... you gotta calm down, man."
Tony wiggled a little, enjoying the feeling of being stuck inside Steve, knowing Steve was filled up him.  He turned his head to try to spit out some of the bitter flavor from Steve's neck, to no avail.
He hung up before she could reply.
"I doubt they use omegas as guards," pointed out Sam.  "Could've been a janitor or something. Not a threat."
Tony relaxed once Aria took the baby; he wiped the drool off of himself with a look of disgust.
Oh Shit. Tony was right. He stared down at himself, as if he required some sort of physical proof and the strange hot sensation in his gut wasn't enough. But then, Steve was still getting used to heats, proper ones. He'd only had a handful of them.
"I get it," said Tony.  "You're omegas, you want kids..."  Clint tried to speak, but Tony cut him off.  "It's different for us, Clint. You and Natasha can't get pregnant.  Me and Steve... we already had a near miss."
"Don't you remember? You wouldn't touch me because you were afraid of hurting me. You wouldn't even stick your tongue in my mouth. And now you've hurt me bad enough that I lost a-- a-- and
"He didn't fuck you," protested Tony suddenly, head snapping up, hackles rising.
"I think he might have just actually lost it. Dying makes people go crazy, right?" Clint said, watching Tony flit about through the hole in the floor with a strange expression on his face.
He got goosebumps and chased the thought away.  He was better than that.  Like Steve said, fuck biology.
"Swollen," reported Dr. Martin, scribbling away in Tony's chart.  "But that's expected.  You're on track; it'll make a full recovery as long as you take it easy for the next week or two.  Hold still, we need to take your blood pressure."  One of the residents took his arm; he paused as he slid on the cuff.  "What are these?" he asked, touching a couple of small, circular scars on Tony's collarbone.
"Yeah, well, I like how you don't get emojis or Garfield or James Bond.  And I like how you've got a little ring of gold and green around your pupils.  I like when you get excited and start
Steve didn't know what to do. The ringing of his phone startled him back into reality. Steve frowned and answered it.  "General Fury, now really isn't a good time..."
"Any time," agreed Banksy, nodding, giving Steve's knee a squeeze.
There it was, the double mark.  Better, at least, than a single mark that wasn't Tony's.
SHIELD is compromised... Sitwell got off; we can't trust any of them..." said Natasha.
Sam smiled back.  "Did
"I mean--"
Steve went to grab a towel from the bathroom, dousing it in cold water before he brought it back to press against the nape of Tony's neck gently, cooling the heated skin. "We'll be separated for the whole evening anyway. There's no point you wearing it, not if it will hurt you. And if you're hanging around Frond more it's bound to get your hackles up." Steve's voice was laced with concern, his other hand gently brushing against Tony's cheek. He tried for a smile. "Kinda sorry I won't be there to see you beat all their asses."
And Tony couldn't help but resent the idea that the Howard he'd known, the stern drinker and steely-eyed businessman, had a rich inner life and complex past that Tony had never been privy to.  Howard had been known, in Steve's time, as a charming heart-breaker with a sharp sense of humor and an unpredictable flair for the dramatic. To Tony, the Howard Steve had known was the real Howard, and his father was a shadow of that, a man who withheld affection and approval and spent a lot of time brooding in his office.
"What are you going to do with all of them? Have an elaborate game of hide and seek?" she asked.
"...JARVIS?  What do tulips mean?" he asked after a moment.
If Tony had had the ability to feel anything aside from lust, he would have been panicking.  They were not doing a fantastic job of keeping up with the pill regimen yet. They were ten minutes behind this time.  Would ten minutes matter? Should Steve take two to be sure? Could they hire a beta or something to just... stand by and cram pills into Steve while they were fucking?
"He saved my life," she answered coolly.
Steve straightened up, holding Bucky's gaze.  So it was finally time for him to meet his captors...
Pepper looked up.  There was no way Tony was going to handle this well.  Not if he felt that his mate-status was threatened.
"Absolutely not."
"Sure I want to stir things up. But I don't want to make things harder for people out there. There's backlash from this against me, sure. I don't care. But what about other omegas? I couldn't bare that- I want to make things better for people, not worse."
"I wish you wouldn't do that to your shoulder."
T'Challa finally spoke, the first time he had the entire lunch.  "We would consider it a grievous insult to have our borders invaded," he said, and T'Chaka sat beside him, hands folded, and didn't contradict him.
They stood there in the bathroom for several long, long minutes.
like this, not in ten years.  Pepper was at a loss as to what to do..  She'd seen him drunk, high, hallucinating, feverish, in the midst of a panic attack... but through all of it, Tony had never actually cried.  In one decade, she'd seen him cry only once, three months after his return from Afghanistan.  It was unnerving, to say the least.  She tried to talk to him, to find out what the hell was going on; their last phone call had been baffling, with Tony saying he had a new arc reactor and was pair-bonded to Steve, but no matter what questions she asked, Tony just sobbed his eyes out like the world was ending.
for. In a bad way it felt good to finally be back at it.
His heart fluttered excitedly in his chest.
Sam laughed.  "You want Mexican food after that?  Seriously?"
Well, each to their own.
"They don't hurt them," DeSoto said, voice small. "They just teach them how to be good for their omegas. How to treat them right."
"...Stevie," he said.
"I want one," Steve affirmed. "Nothing before this weekend, but yeah."
"What did you do?" Steve asked and stood, walking over to check Tony's eyes. He looked suitably less out of it than before, at least. Steve sighed fondly and turned back to Aria. She'd already put out her cigarette.
The man only looked more confused.  "It's-- it's my real name?"
He changed the subject to Banksy's birthday.  Banksy was forty-seven and had a party planned that evening.  "Oh course, you're all totally invited," he added.
"I'm not going to tell anyone anything about the forced bond, you don't have to worry about that. I just wanted to get it out there before some tabloid picking up on it. I couldn't hide my neck forever," Steve said, getting more serious as his fingers twined with Tony's under the table. His brow was drawing together in a slight frown. But then he smelt pizza and Steve instantly perked up.
Steve pressed dial.
He couldn't bear the thought of there not being, of them haunting him to his graze...Steve wouldn't have it. He always liked the idea of a family; it was appealing, but his idea of happiness had never depended on it. Security and just a
"They can write us up when we get back from Yemen," said Clint.  "Nat, take that thing off of him and let's get to the jet."
Peggy, who looked awfully proud of herself, pushing Tony's up towards him. "Come on dear. Drink up."
"Right.  The 'gas leak,'" said Tony.  "Aside from the Hammer program to reverse-engineer the suit, is there any other agency that's working anything?"
"We're going to do so much more to that couch than just get it sticky," said Tony, grinning, then paused.  "Actually, no, we're basically just going to get it sticky."
Steve schooled his features to prevent him frowning. Pepper sounded strange and it made him feel unsettled. "You know are relationship isn't your  job, right?  That's not for you to worry about. You have so much on your plate already Pepper.  Seriously."
"So they sell themselves," Steve said, horrified. "How... how many do it?"
"So now they've just ruined every chance they had at a normal life too."
"Also we'll need a duplicate of whatever we buy."
"Hey, Sheriff--" Lawrence turned around. "--there's a doctor downstairs. She's the one's whose been... doing this to the kids.  Aiding, abetting.  She knows what they-- well, she needs to speak to the medical staff so they know how to proceed."
"But... but we can all do Christmas?"
and you're wasting your time on him? You want an Alpha and stability? You can have those things without having a guy who doesn't value you for how awesome you are."
and he felt a bit uncomfortable about that.  He didn't want to throw a big party with a bunch of people much younger than him.  He'd already gotten that from Banksy's party. Besides, Tony liked to flirt when he was drunk, and he always had a few old flings show up, and he knew Steve got jealous.
Tony was rambling; he abandoned his search for the mythical razor and walked out to find his clothes.  The Mark V was standing blank and dull in Steve's room, looking thoroughly out of place.  A perfect metaphor, really, for Tony.  He was out of place in Steve's life, too.  He wasn't a person who especially liked structure or discipline, and he'd never be able to work with the Avengers- he was pretty sure- and Steve obviously had a commitment to them, plus the whole omega rights platform... Steve's life was filled to the brim and Tony felt like he'd overstayed his welcome.  Of course Steve wouldn't want to admit to Natasha or any of his friends that Tony had stayed the night; Tony was Steve's antithesis; he was selfish and rude and brash and there was no place for him in Steve's admirable life.  Plus, Natasha was an insanely dominant Alpha... maybe now that Steve knew how great sex was, he was going to try to jump ship, shack up with someone more powerful... Tony would happily fight anyone who tried to take Steve from him, but if Steve wanted to leave, he couldn't really prevent him.  But she had Clint.  Tony felt confused.  Steve probably didn't want to hook up with her, he just... didn't want Tony.
"About DeSoto?"
say that..."
Then there was a screech and the comms turned on, a voice filtering through; it was the director's. Steve recognised the words and moved to cover Bucky's ears but it was too late.
It was a nonsense word but it hit him.  Hard.  Harder than anything that anyone had done to him all day.  He could deal with being kicked in the balls and having a knife plunged into his hip.  All of that was child's play.
. Steve knew he was really no better and the last thing he ever wanted to be was a hypocrite. He was quiet for a moment as Tony talked and Natasha said something about leaving now. His hands twitched in his lap. Steve's left arm felt uncomfortable but his right was the one bandaged up. Maybe he'd hit it with his encounter with the wall or something.
"...rabbit?" repeated Tony.
"Impressive moves, Barton."
Tony tried to sip the coffee.  There was no alcohol in it.  Tony felt a stab of annoyance at Steve.  He held out the coffee.  "I don't want this," he snapped.  He flopped down onto the pillows.  "...I'm sorry, Steve.  I'm not mad at you.  I'm mad at... myself, I guess. I dunno."  Tony reached out for Steve's hand, finding it, lacing their fingers together.  He gave Steve's hand a squeeze, feeling even more guilty for snapping at his omega.
"Oh.  Charles.  Charles Bernard Barton."
then you really are as stupid as you look," he breathed.
Tony swept the towel around his body.  Steve had noticed Tony had a habit of wrapping the towel under his arms instead of at his waist; the towels were thick enough to cover the arc reactor.  Despite Steve having told Tony a million times he wasn't bothered either by the device or the scars around it, old habits died hard; unlike the proud, shirtless teenager in the simulation, Tony often covered up.  He was, Steve had discovered, more likely to wear a shirt than pants; at least twice, Steve had caught him in the shop working in boxer-briefs, and once, he'd been wearing swim trunks.  ("You've never been surfing?  Really?" said Tony, who seemed genuinely surprised that Steve, a poor kid from Brooklyn during the Great Depression, had never surfed.)
"You know...I don't think I've ever seen you dance," Steve said and suddenly he was curious. But then the moment was broken by the omega woman asking for his autograph.
Not content with letting Steve live a quiet life, Aria insisted he follow through on his various public appearances, including a photo shoot for an omega clothing line, an ad council promotion for milk, and a photo op with some Boy Scouts at a local library
Steve didn't know who Kate or Carter or Thirteen or whatever her name was, but one thing was clear.  She wasn't a nurse.  She had spent her time at the hospital commanding the staff with a shocking amount of authority, and by the time men in sunglasses and earpieces and barely concealed weapons began to cluster around Steve's and Fury's rooms, Steve had figured out she was a higher-up in one of those agencies that Tony called "alphabet soup:" FBI, CIA, DOD, NSA, or SHIELD.
He waited until they were done thanking him and had left before turning to Steve.  "...I can tell it's bothering you," he said. "...let's go back to the hotel, okay?  It's loud here and I don't want to get any more drunk, I've got a good buzz going."
what the hell he's doing right now?"
She hesitated, then complied.  There was a pop and she shrieked a little.
, Captain.  Can I get you something to eat?  You look famished. Here, have some prawns."  He offered Steve a plate of shrimp.
Tony checked it.  Restricted.
was it? Interesting.
"...being bonded is terrifying, Steve. Being
Steve ran his fingers along the grooves of an exposed bicep, half aware of Tony's sweatpants before shrugged off...somewhere. He curled his legs around Tony's waist as his mate moved closer, basking and purring in content at the other's warmth. Steve nuzzled against his jaw.
"...he left," he said, unnecessarily.
"No, honey, but I can get you some if you want," yelled Banksy back.
Get your ass downstairs this instant and don't come up until you've sorted things out with your Alpha.
So why was the Winter Soldier in it? Why did he know Steve's name?  Steve swallowed and bunched his legs up, leaning his forehead on his knees in an almost fetal position.  His nausea had gotten worse.
In the end, he just grabbed one at random to take back upstairs.  He wasn't sure what he was looking for, precisely. He was still pretty tipsy.  Perhaps some indication that Jarvis hadn't been one of the oppressed omegas of Steve's world, that he and his father had a good bond, that Jarvis was happy.  For some reason that was very important to Tony.
"Can it, Jarv!" barked Tony.  "Tell her I'm busy corrupting Steve!"
Tony flipped out his phone and pulled up Tetris again.  The truth was, Tony had nothing against omegas, as a group.  Nothing at all.  In a way, he respected them.  But people assumed he was a bleeding heart because of his father.  Howard had been fairly progressive for his time, at least with regards to omega rights, and Tony loathed being compared to the man in any way.  Howard had been a real Alpha’s Alpha, and as far as Tony could tell, the only reason he knew omegas existed or cared for them at all was because of Jarvis, his butler, who was long dead and completely irreplaceable.  Tony hated the politics of Alpha-omega relationships as much as he hated being reminded of his childhood and his father, and ever since his and Steve’s debate the previous night, Tony had been on edge and seeking to cause some trouble.  Maybe it was immature, but he didn’t care.  He was Tony Stark.  He could be as immature as he wanted.  Who was going to stop him?
, went unsaid. It felt pretty great. He kind of hoped Ty left soon so he could do something about it.
"You're not just sayin' that?' asked Steve.
JARVIS followed the coordinates to the letter, but it was still unclear if this was the correct location.  Steve landed in the middle of a field dusted with a light frost. If this was a safehouse, it was unlike any safehouse Steve had ever seen.  There was a large, white farmhouse with hunter-green shutters and a wide front porch, and a weathered barn behind it. It sat on several acres of field, and beyond it, there was nothing but trees and mountains.  There was a small pond, frozen over; the road leading up to it was simply packed dirt. An American flag was fluttering near the door. There was a tire swing on a large tree behind it. The whole place screamed "average."
"...I'll work on an alibi.  SHIELD can't know about Bucky," said Natasha firmly.  "We can say Steve had a meltdown, went on the lam, he's sorry, it won't happen again... they'll give him another tracker and that'll be that."
," replied Pepper with equal exasperation, reaching over to straighten his tie.  "Never mind, we can fix whatever it is after the interview, you've got about eight or nine million viewers so you two go out there and say some sound bites."
"Not on the arc reactor, sorry," said Tony, not sounding very sorry.  "It's fine, c'mon." He clanked across the roof toward a ventilation shaft.  Sam winced, following him.
Steve was not happy when she mentioned Bucky. Also, Frond got it wrong. Bucky didn't withhold all affection, just sex! He still cuddled Steve, still slept next to him, kissed him if he was lucky... well, when he behaved himself.
The silence that followed was profound.  Everyone gaped at him.
?" he challenged, putting a hand on his hip.
"How the hell didn't we--"
After the bath they dried off and dressed. After some quick consultation with Tony, Steve dressed in black pants and a white shirt with his casual navy jacket on top so he didn't look like he was making too much of an effort.
"When hell freezes over, Tony.  You're not getting the suit back.  Look, you have, like, what, five or six suits of your own.  Let us keep this one as a show of good faith.  The government is seriously not happy with you.  The Senate wants you locked up in Seagate, you know."
"Why not? I would have killed to go to college at your age," Steve said and he really would have done. If all these kids came from affluent families like Hal said then they could certainly afford it. He tried to get interviews at art schools, but every time he turned up and they smelt his status on him he was turned away. After the last one he'd broken down into a pool of frustrated tears and Bucky had rocked him on the couch until he'd fallen asleep.
"I have to out again soon," Steve said. "Will you be okay here, by yourself?" He asked tentatively as they got out of the car. It would be a busy week. He had two appointments tomorrow. And then a day after there was a photo shoot with Vogue or whoever the hell the designer was. And then it was the world security council the day after that.
He let Tony drag him into the spa, which Tony booked in its entirety so that they could have some privacy.  "Privacy" was subjective; the staff was still there, watching them, ever-attentive.  Steve looked around self-consciously, unsure of how he felt about getting undressed in front of strangers.  It took some elbowing from Tony for Steve to pull off his clothes and climb onto a massage table.
"For the record," he added, looking over at one of his gantries, at his desk, anywhere but Steve, "I feel like lately I've been
He lunged.  But not at Hammer.
Embarrassed, Pepper looked over toward Phil's elaborate nest.  His face was poking out the entrance and he was watching Tony with undisguised interest and hunger.
"Do you think he was trying to blackmail you into sex?"
Well, this wasn't going anywhere.
He looked out the window, thinking. A week ago had been Monaco.  Was Steve telling him that he'd been around Natasha for months without cycling but had gone into heat for Tony?  Maybe he was lying again.  Then again, you couldn't fake a heat.  Tony remembered the desperate noises of want that Steve had made.  Steve may have lied about who he was and why he was there, but there was no denying that that had been real.  Even if Steve didn't like Tony on a personal level, his body clearly wanted him.
didn't happen."
Fury glared at Tony, clearly assuming Tony had taken the bed for himself, then looked up at Steve, ignoring Brennan entirely.  "Glad to see you're looking better, Cap. I have something for you. A friendship bracelet." He held up a small black box on a thick leather and metal strap.
Natasha's grip remained on his wrist, but Steve made no motion to pull away; he really didn't have anything left to give.
"Come on, let's go!" he barked, grabbed Steve's arm and yanking.  "It's you they want, Rogers, hurry, let's move..."
anything. Everything I do with you is because I want to. The stuff we do in private, that's our business, not anyone else's.  ...I'm not sure I could ever deal with wearing a collar... I mean back in the forties I never did, couldn't afford one. Guess I lucked out there," Steve tried to joke but frowned briefly before looking back up. "But I don't want you to feel like you can't ask for things from me. You shouldn't be scared to, just like I'm not scared of saying no either."
"Hey, so I guess Tony Stark's pretty good at pool, right? Like...it's all just maths when you get down to it." Callum wore thick rimmed glasses and was studying something to do with physics and math for his PHD (the title of which had admittedly gone straight over Steve's head.) Callum was grinning, too. All of them were clearly very excited.
"What's it like being with Tony Stark? He good in bed?" Joan asked bluntly, her voice still awfully sweet. Steve gently moved their hands away.
Tony trailed after Steve, still oblivious to the water he was dripping everywhere.  He watched the way Steve moved easily. Tony's bedroom was becoming "their" bedroom again; Steve didn't hesitate this time to begin toweling himself off.  Tony sat on the edge of the bed, still in wet boxers, watching him fondly.
Tony barely managed to straddle Steve's chest before cumming all over his face.
"I'm sorry," said Tony suddenly.  "I'm sorry the forties sucked.  I'm trying, Steve. I'm trying to be a good Alpha for you.  And to be... open-minded and progressive and everything.  But I also... I don't want to be weak.  You know, my dad--"
"I need my omega," said Tony suddenly.
They lapsed into silence.  Tony didn't want to be anywhere near her, but he didn't want to move or go inside, either.
The line went quiet for several long seconds.
Pepper gave him a sympathetic sort of look that made him feel like an idiot. Steve really should have known. But he didn't rummage in Tony's workshop, just like he didn't look through Steve's sketchbook.  He was tempted to go down there and try and find the damned stuff but he knew Tony could acquire more very easily if he wanted to.
"Ah-ah-ah," said Gleason gently; a moment later he was jabbing Steve with another syringe.
welcomed. How could Steve not like it when his alpha admired him? It was instinct.
Sitwell moved to get out gauze tape and bandages, which he wrapped around after sealing the wound with a decent-sized plaster. The bandages were wrapped around his neck and felt like some kind of quasi-collar. Steve didn't like it. He wanted to tug at them but Sitwell's serious expression stopped him from doing so. The man's fingers were red with his blood.
Steve took the phone she offered and scrolled through the tweets, eyes widening. It was still scary to him how quickly news could be born in the 21st century. It happened two minutes ago and now thousands of people were seeing it. He knew what Tony had said was not
!  Tony was so used to relying on technology that he'd completely forgotten he could do that.
Steve and Tony entered the second lobby of the hotel, looking around curiously, Tony still in his suit and Steve only in a waistcoat.  The room was teeming with Alphas, a splattering of omegas amongst them. Most of the Alphas were male and Steve didn't think there was even one Alpha younger than thirty-five. It was clearly a very specific crowd.
"Oh, great!  Just great!  So I'm supposed to
Tony blinked with exhaustion and grabbed Steve's hands, pulling them onto his arc reactor.  "Steve. Feel the heat. You're not cold, you're feverish. You don't have frostbite, I promise.  You're warm. Put your hands on my heart if you want them to be warm," he said. His voice sounded exhausted, even to him.  "I'll get you a bath, okay? You're doing great. We're both doing great."
He squinted against the sun; Yemen was a desert and it resembled Kunar far, far too closely for his taste.
"...Rhodey," said Tony suddenly.  "Rhodey's not bonded. We could do him, maybe?"
He glanced out the window.  It was dark out.  Right.  Time zone change.  They'd only been in the air for three, four hours tops, but they had moved forward three hours in time.  Tony looked down to reset his watch.  He was wearing an analog Jaeger, which, though impractical, looked damned good.
She waved a hand dismissively.  "Oh, no problem.  Cheating is an honored SHIELD tradition.  Nearly everyone tries out one of these subconscious simulations before the psyche test, just so that they know what to expect.  You might be the only one trustworthy enough to have gone in blind."
His mate had turned on him.  There were two possibilities.  Either Steve had gone crazy and wasn't to blame... or he'd turned on Tony, just like Obie had, and could no longer be trusted.  Tony wasn't taking chances.
Brent offered a grin.
. Feels good-- feels like--" Steve cut himself off with his own gasp, a quiet whine following. "I'm gonna--"
"Well, then, he's right.  There's an obvious conflict of interest.  Let's call Pierce and ask if we can let them go home," said the colonel.  He pointed to one of the sergeants. "Simmons, go call Pierce and Fury. Gentlemen, this should only take a few minutes."
Steve backed away until he was plastered against the wall, eyes red with the threat of tears. Phil told him it was good to cry...Steve didn't know if that counted in front of his Alpha. He sucked in a shaky breath as the command washed over him and he obeyed on instinct. It was like breathing. He dropped down to his knees with all the grace that a soldier should, his head bowed low and his shoulders still shaking a little.
"....sir?"  he repeated, confused.  He knew those words... how did he know those words...?
"I'm heading to the medical ward," Steve told Tony, brushing his fingers against the other's. "Are you gonna look for Trickshot? Keep me updated."
Funnily, for Steve, it was the opposite.  Steve, who was a big man inside and out, who was assertive and strong and courageous, turned into putty in the bedroom, was happy to give up power and be protected and coddled and ordered around.  Steve had told Tony more than once that he missed being smaller, and in the bedroom, he was able to regain at least some of that feeling. His actual size didn't matter; when Tony pinned him down and bit his neck, they were both probably away that Steve was mentally incapable of shrugging Tony off.
“Where’s Tony?”
"Very nice, Tony," said Tiberius with a roll of his eyes.  "Hi, Steve." He kept a respectful distance. "Hello, David."
"...I want you to put it in your mouth," groaned Tony, fingers flexing at his sides, quivering with anticipation.  "Please, Steve, oh, please..."  He arched again, seeking relief.  It wasn't just the memory of Steve's velvety tongue on his skin; it was the smell of him.  Steve was enjoying himself and it made Tony melt to know his omega was aroused by him.
"If the device is complete, then why are you stalling?  Are you afraid it won't work?  Turn it on, Mr. Stark."
His own fucking missile had done this to him.
"Hey!"
Tony shrugged helplessly; he had no clue where Clint had been born or even what his middle name was (thought he hoped it was Francis so he could make fun of him later).
The windows were tinted and, feeling secure that no one was watching them except for Happy, Tony pulled Steve down onto the back seat and draped himself over him.  The feeling of Steve's body under him, warm and breathing steadily, his chest moving up and down, was comforting.  This was all Tony had really wanted, all night, was to cover his mate.  Happy, driving, was discreet; he kept his eyes on the road.  Tony had done a lot worse in the back seats of cars before.
"Thanks Rhodey," Steve was smiling properly now. "I better go get some pants on Tony though, or at least an apron...just to be safe." He winced a little and Rhodey chuckled quietly. "And really, you don't owe me one. After Yemen, I owe you. And I'd be lying if I said I probably won't enjoy it at least a little... I
With a small thrill he realized he and Steve would be alone for the first time since Steve had revealed his identity.  But he quickly suppressed his excitement.  Steve was on a job and didn't want him, and besides, there was nothing sexy about the idea of looking through his father's old notebooks and newsreels.  Tony punched the code into the shop and held open the thick, bulletproof glass door open for Steve, who was carrying the boxes, his muscles bulging attractively as he lifted the heavy materials.  Tony eyed them when Steve wasn't looking.  Just because Steve had betrayed him didn't mean he couldn't still at least check him out once in awhile.
He almost asked Steve to swear he'd never tell a soul, then realized Steve wouldn't, not in a million years.  The only thing more embarrassing than Tony being turned on by this was probably anyone knowing that Steve had willingly put on the uniform for him.
"Poor thing," Steve murmured. He would have been like Tricky if he was 'bought'. He would have fought and scrapped every day, he would have tried to escape every chance he got. He sat down a little heavily, slightly horrified that DeSoto wanted to be 'good' for a man  who'd essentially bought a boy, held him captive and then got mad when he didn't
Tony was ignoring them, nuzzling Steve's shoulder, caressing his arms.  Steve felt so hot, so luscious. Yet sad, too. Tragically sad. Tony didn't know why but he wanted to comfort him, wanting to fold him up and hold him and make him feel better.  He'd already decided the best place to do that was in the lounge on the second floor. It was smaller than the bedroom, small and comfortable.
Damn it.  Tony had expected Alphas.  Or at least betas jacked up on a ton of hormones.  But if they were both omegas, then they couldn't be the Winter Soldier.  You couldn't mistake an omega for an Alpha.  It was an unfortunate reality that a lot of omegas would take dangerous amounts of suppressants, trying to pass as betas (it was rumored that this was what had killed Janis Joplin), but no amount of hormonal supplementation could turn an omega Alpha, or vice versa.  Tony thought back to his childhood friend, Ty, and a shudder passed through him.
Agent Carter lifted a pair of wire cutters with a grin and Hawley sighed. "I already said those weren't necessary."
of sanity."
Gideon was already getting into his car.
He had a vague memory of Captain Rogers and Howard Stark but Howard Stark was dead, wasn't he?  How could this omega be carrying Howard's child if Howard was dead?  Except that he'd never mentioned Howard at all, just some guy named Tony, and though the soldier was straining, he was having difficulty remembering who that was.
He leaned his head on his hands, fingers threaded together, and tried to school his face into something unreadable. But Tony could feel his emotions.  It was pointless. Steve sighed. Sometimes he had this strange fantasy where they had a kid and Tony would suddenly stop drinking because he didn't want to be drunk around the baby and...
"...Brent Walker is a
"I dunno," Happy said. "But being late certainly won't help you. Come on, let's go."
"Tony?"
"The conference thing was
"You can come if you want to," Steve said. "But you'll probably just get bugged by all the people who work there. Last time I went everyone was staring. It was sort of intimidating." It then occurred to Steve that Tony didn't find that kind of thing intimidating at all. Whilst Steve had been his PA, Tony had been in the spotlight every time he'd walked out the doors. And he seemed to handle it well. Tony being at his interview could equally be supportive, or distracting. "Why don't you pick me up
"I will not walk into HYDRA's arms..." Steve said, shaking his head. He was physically trembling and Pietro had a knife and fuck his head hurt. He couldn't see straight. He stumbled. "What...what are you doing..."
"I'm sorry," Steve gasped out and then drove a knife through Pietro's hand and into the roof.
"...he can sing, I'll give him that," said the man beside Bucky cautiously, as a peace offering.
But then... that name.  That name held meaning! It had sprung to his brain suddenly, without any warning, but the moment he thought it, he held onto it, turning it over and over.
Steve remembered the day like yesterday. Bucky brought them home and Steve was delighted. He drew them all day and all night. And then Bucky brought home a girl and Steve sat out on the fire escape in the muggy summer air to avoid listening to them. He'd accidentally fallen asleep and when the sun went down he'd started to shiver. Bucky had been furious when he'd found him and dragged him inside.... Steve had had a cold for weeks after that.
"Yeah.  Guess so," said Tony.
"Natasha is coming to pick you up in the morning in a jet. We'll be leaving now. There's food in the fridge and a bed and bathroom through there," Nick said, finally speaking up again. "Get some sleep Captain."
"Tony!  Tony, stop!  Stop!" shrieked Sam, trying to get away.  He managed to kick Tony off him and back into a corner of the room, hands up, shoulders hunched, eyes down.
She pointed firmly at Tony, knowing he wasn't going to be happy about the nurse helping Steve get his pants off. There was two thin pink marks on either leg, his left ankle and right thigh. They didn't look as bad as they should have, really; the denim had absorbed a lot of the heat. But they still weren't great.
Steve was shaking. Maybe in fear or awe. He wasn't sure. Slowly, the soldier raised his human hand and pressed it against Steve's on the other side of the glass.
Steve's heart ached in his chest.
"After saying he wouldn't fight us," she grumbled bitterly.
Something hit Steve. It was when the guy handed him his phone and didn't look at his face. The newspapers all made it sound like he'd been received by everyone- not necessarily received
Beth pulled open Steve's door and caught him from falling out.
"You guys better not get me involved, I have great aim, y'know..."
He rolled his hips up and then his lips parted as he felt the drag of Tony inside of him. It was perfect.
He walked over to Steve and ruffled his hair.
"I don't wanna miss the birth," Steve sighed.
Bruises were blooming everywhere.
"Have you ever considered..." Natasha cut in smoothly, voice terribly soft. "That it
And then Steve leaned forward, and he kissed him.
"--oh, really, Level Seven clearance?  And what good does that do you if you're losing track of the captain every other day, huh, Jasper?"  He slammed the phone down. "Incompetent idiots," he muttered darkly.
"Ugh.  And Tony's an Alpha and he's going to see them and he's going to end up on one of his little self-pity binges," grumbled Pepper.
Steve laughed softly.  "No promises, Mr. President."
"...shit... shit, shit, shit..." hissed Pepper, frantically scanning the article.  "...
"Omegas are my specialty.  That doesn't mean I can't treat an Alpha," said Gleason.
Steve was grinning from ear to ear. Oh if this was true it was brilliant. "Happy is one of the nicest people I've ever met. I don't see how he's a six, Tony," he said. "I think anyone would be lucky to have him."
"Hm?  Wha’?" mumbled Tony, cracking open an eye.
"Well... I was gonna take Malick's shirts to the dry cleaner's and then go upstairs and nap," said Tony.  "But if you want to face the crowd, we can do that. They, uh, might not be happy to see us. I mean, you're in a collar and I'm dressed like a squirrel and we're at an Alpha conference.  But whatever you want, man. ...the press will want statements."
Happy turned in to the McDonald's drivethrough without blinking. This was a common occurrence, then.
He realized his simulation had tried to tell him. When he'd woken up in the HYDRA facility...something had felt strange in his stomach. His body had been trying to tell him he was pregnant even when he didn't even know it then. If only he'd realized sooner, maybe he would have been more careful, maybe he would have had the choice...
If Tony's actions could be called anything, it would be "waiting."  But what he was waiting for was unclear, even to him. His parents weren't coming back and there would be no closure.
DeSoto's soulful brown eyes drifted from Tony, to Steve, back to Tony.
Pepper was Tony's best friend.  She was drop-dead gorgeous and wickedly smart.  She was composed and business-savvy and knew exactly what to say and do all the time.  Tony loved her, yes. He probably always would.
" said Natasha.
The adrenaline helped Steve on his feet, helped him run. He heard gunshots. There was chaos around him, the smell of smoke and engine gas pungent in the air. It was toxic. His right thigh burned with the pain of running but he pushed on until he saw it, just out of the corner of his eye- Fury was shot. He was down. And there was the soldier.
Okay.  Okay.  This wasn't a big deal.  He'd change the core when he got home.  He was going to be fine.
Okay, so he was being approached by someone, or something, and its arms were impossibly long, but not wings.  Jumper cables?  One of them snaked outward, flickering a jagged bolt of lightning from it, and Tony considered the possibility that he was hallucinating.  He definitely might have a concussion.  Seemed likely, really.  The man in front of him had a large, glowing circle in his chest, an arc reactor just like Tony's, and both his arms were coursing with jags of lightning.  Tony was almost positive he was experiencing some sort of weird head trauma.
Tony spared a glance at Steve, whose head was down, like a child being scolded.  But his attention was drawn back to Phil, who had begun shredding up a stack of
than before. Steve smelt right now. His neck looked right. Bucky was in cryo...and they'd suitably screwed up the Alpha conference. They'd done good, for other people and themselves.  The things in life that had been nagging at them were getting resolved, slowly by surely.
"Hello, Gideon," said Tony pleasantly.  "...oh,
are sorry, right?" Phil prompted.
But then Steve was up on stage and Taylor was throwing her arms around him and squealing. "Oh my God! I'm so excited to meet you!"
Steve smiled against him when Tony finally said please. He hummed in approval. "That's more like it," he murmured and then he moved to take Tony into his mouth. He sucked around the head, swirling with his tongue before he ducked down lower till the head nudged the back of his mouth. He watched Tony's reaction intently, taking in his every shudder and sound, before he moved to bob his head.
"Is he shivering?" Aria asked abruptly. "Tony feel his forehead, is Steve cold?"
"I wouldn't say it's the
"Are you sure?  Is the AV equipment definitely online?"
"We should get you some clothes that actually fit," said Tony quietly.  "If you
Steve couldn't really argue with that. If Tony wanted to buy his birthday treat through blow jobs then Steve certainly
He distantly remembered their first 'date', where Steve walked out on Tony for assuming they'd be in a trio. He was totally different now.
"About Trickshot."
Donner stretched weakly toward the baby.  "--my baby...?"
"He's hopeless.  Let's rough up Sitwell again," said Clint.
"It's nonferrous!  ...I think!  It's actually a new element I just made up like a week ago.  Steve...!"
After Steve had hung up, one of the police officers snagged him.  They were still sweeping the school with the thoroughness of a much larger agency, even though they were mostly made up of volunteers; however, the process didn't simply involve getting the kids shepherded out, but of taking photographs and locating records and putting things into neatly-labeled evidence bags.
He could not even say how long he'd been here.  No food, only a little water, virtually no sleep.  He could have already been here for days, for all he knew.  He was shaky from hunger and his ankle was not doing any better.  Trying to push Bucky away was proving difficult even for him.
"I'm opening the door in five..." Maria stepped towards it.
Steve felt like he was being shot at with a gun across a workshop, a bullet pinging across the vibranium shield he held in his tiny hands, Howard's laughter echoing in his ears. Because he felt small right now and, Jesus-- when he moved to stand he wobbled for a second and realized he was tipsy. Or maybe even drunk. How much alcohol had that guy given him? They definitely hadn't spiked him, right? Because Steve really
Steve's breath hitched as Tony paced around him. He felt another shiver run down his spine as Tony encircled his omega. His back was soldier-straight, as always and when Tony called him perfect he felt a little colour rise to his cheeks. He shouldn't have crushed the chip, he screwed up but like this...he was perfect.
"You feeling okay?" Steve asked tentatively.
"Night Tony. I love you too."
He pulled it open.
Steve let out a quiet sound as Tony stroked at him and teased at his entrance. He squirmed again, wishing Tony would just
"Steve. Wait-" Natasha put a hand on his arm and stopped him. "Are you..."
Which meant he had to get that self-assembling armor put together as soon as possible.  Unless he wanted to haul around the Mark IV constantly, he would need the Mark VII battle-capable, ready to summon it whenever Bucky reared his head again.
He also didn't want to feed Tony's alcoholic habit. Whenever he saw him drank something sank in Steve's chest and whenever he asked for it he felt conflicted. Tony was his own person who could make his own decisions but Steve was also his mate and was supposed to care for him, where was the line crossed when Steve would be protecting Tony from himself? Couldn't his alpha feel Steve's conflict whenever he asked? Didn't he know how hard it was for him to watch? Steve mentally sighed as he clocked off the minute mark underwater, his lungs protesting a little, but he still had a while.
"They thought we were just friends," insisted Steve. "After all, he never showed any physical affection towards me that a friend wouldn't show and before Cap I was nobody. They would never have seen pictures of me with the bite mark."
"Have you two just been mating continuously for the last twelve hours?  Jesus, that's not how you're supposed to do it..." muttered Sam, shaking his head.
Phil looked over at Steve with a sad look.  "I'll need photos of your neck, Captain. I'm sorry.  ...does... do you consent to having your mate sedated?  He seems..." Phil didn't say feral, God bless him. "...a little worked up."
"I don't understand how you can be so smart and still--" fussed Pepper, getting up to grab a dishrag.  "Go.  Just go, I'll clean it up, go."
"The bottom of the totem pole, that's actually the best place on the pole," repeated Laura, much louder, signing.
"Thanks, Jarv, but you're not human.  You're just a program.  A damned good one, but still... not really a connoisseur of human emotion.  Math isn't great at predicting people's motivations."  He took a swig from the bottle.  "Maybe I oughta call Pepper."
Tony felt relief flood through him.  They had been promised a non-hostile crowd and although the reporters certainly didn't seem hostile, per se, they were pretty unabashedly prying.  Of course, considering Tony and Steve were public figures, he shouldn't have been surprised.
"A nap sounds tempting," Steve hummed, thinking it would be nice to have some peace and quiet for a bit. "I wouldn't go and face them in a collar. I think they'd go a little mental-- but if I'm outside of the conference I figure I technically don't have to wear it. I suppose we can face the crowd later, maybe. We don't have to do it now."
He turned back to Steve, rubbing his back.  Steve was tense under his touch, shaking. "...Steve, fuck.  You're having a panic attack over this. We can just cancel, okay?  It won't disappoint anyone, I promise. This isn't healthy to force yourself to do this just to prove a point.  Just breathe, Steve. We're not putting anything around your neck if you don't want it."
Then there was his sister, her eyes blazing red, and her mouth was moving too, her words coming out as spiky black liquid metal, sinking to the ground and splashing into nothingness.
"I love you," he whispered, so softly that it was doubtful Tony could hear it over the scream of the crowd before them, his fingertips brushing the edges of the arc reactor underneath his t-shirt. Steve's eyes dropped down for a moment and then back up to Tony's face.
"Oh, sure, you know, just a little side project to keep me busy," he said, flashing a smile at everyone.
Pepper pinched the bridge of her nose.  "Arvicolinectomy. They cut out the arvicolina."
Steve knelt down so the beta woman who was walking over marched over couldn't hear him.
"Let's just cuddle in bed and order some room service," he said, holding Steve's hand as they wandered sleepily into the lobby together. The time zone change and overly-long nap on the plane had muddled up Tony's internal clock.
Steve didn't usually strike people as especially violent. But the war had burned violent reactions into his blood. It was in Steve's instinct to hit and punch things he didn't like, things that opposed him. And Malick pushed a lot of buttons.
Tony ignored her.
"Me?" said Tiberius, and laughed.  "No. Not especially. I like Alphas.  Well... being an omega myself, you know.  I always imagined myself with a male Alpha, a big strong one.  They... ah, they tried to fix that in the camp." He looked down a little, then up.  "Didn't work. Well. That's what toys are for, right?" He forced a smile that didn't quite meet his eyes, then added, "I know what you're wondering.  Why I don't just get with someone who's non-statused. But it's not the same. Male betas don't have knots, and female betas just... don't satisfy me. I want someone to fill me up.  You know the feeling. But of course I'm..." He opened his arms in a helpless gesture, then reached over to pour Steve another glass of water. Steve was dutifully trying to choke down pill after pill.
And Tony, who had spent the first several decades of his life struggling to get the approval of Alphas more powerful than him-- first his father, then Stane-- soaked up the positive attention like a sponge.  Being Iron Man was worth dying for because people finally loved him, approved of him.  It filled a hole in his heart.  Tony found himself laughing at the irony.  Now he had an
Pepper wanted to be annoyed but couldn't find it in herself. They looked more like a couple, more
Everything Steve had said was impossible.  First of all, Bucky couldn't be alive and unaged.  That was
"Lemme see the badge.  I like the badge."
Something fluttered in Steve's chest when Tony used the word
"...uh..."  That name wasn't familiar to him.  Maybe it had been mentioned but he couldn't remember.  He didn't want to do anything small or local, though.  "No," he decided.
He had to admit... he liked Joan.  She was pretty. A bit old, but very, very pretty.
Or what?
"You sound like you're a good soul DeSoto," Steve breathed. "It sounds like you deserve an Alpha who doesn't shoot you by accident. No man ever turns a gun on someone he cares about." He briefly thought of Peggy firing a gun at the shield, before the serum, and had to bite back a smile. She always was an exception. A terrific, fantastic exception.
Normally he would never trust these people... but fortune favored the bold and he had nothing to lose, so he walked into the diner, making sure to give her a small knock with his shoulder.  He was more upset by Steve knowing her than her being here.  Tony didn't mind hanging around more powerful Alphas, but he hated watching her and Steve smiling conspiratorially at each other.
"Yeah, yeah.  Me and Sam are gonna go cut a wire or something and then rendezvous on the roof, and on Cap's signal, we go in.  Right?" He eyed Sam. Sam was wearing normal-looking military-issued combat clothes. He had a backpack, though that was clearly a piece of classified tech.  Tony studied it, curious how it worked, what powered it. What the hell was it, anyway? A jetpack or something? The flight googles on Sam's head indicated that, however it operated, it went fast.
Pepper smiled without meaning to; Tony had spent the last few weeks being reckless and brooding and unusually withdrawn, his actions oscillating between uncontrollable bursts of energy and moody sulky.  Now, he'd stabilized.  At least, as much as someone like Tony ever really did.
Peggy nodded, staring at the floor for a moment before she looked straight up in Tony's eyes. There was something hard in  her expression.
Steve woke up the next morning after sleeping through most of the day, his sleep cycle ruined by the sedatives and the night awake in the hospital.  The first thing he did was down a load of contraceptives before he woke Tony with a lazy sort of blowjob. They only had sex four times that day (a record low for when Steve was in heat). But it was like Richard had said: the heat was a mild one. It was almost nice, actually. They could appreciate the neediness of it, the rush, but there was no exhaustion, no awkward chaffing and no ruined sofas. Steve still wanted it to be over with quick though. He just wanted to hang out with Donner and Granite already.
Phil snorted.  "Oh,
"We want a non-partisan, non-status press release.  I thought we were very clear about that during our meeting?" said Malick.
"We just stopped by to check in... it seems we both thought this would be a good time," said Dr. Brennan with a smile.
"For the millionth time, stop apologizing, it's not your fault and I'm not mad at you!  I'm mad at the whole fucking situation," said Tony. Donner's stutter was back. "I'm mad because they just won't leave Steve alone.  Well, specifically Malick--"
In the front of the plane, Tony was watching Pepper with a steely-eyed expression.  There would be no hiding the absence of his new PA from him, clearly.  He was already aware something was up.  As Pepper pressed the martini glass into Tony's hand she gave him a serious look. "Tony.  Stan is out of action for a little bit. You won't get to see him for a few days."
DeSoto watched, wide-eyed, as Steve went to go tuck Tony back in.  He leaned over a tiny bit to peek in; Tony was making grabby hands at Steve, touching his neck, and Steve was shushing him and adjusting his pillows for him.
Steve exhaled. "If you really don't want kids Tony, it's what you should do."
"No program is perfect," he repeated back to Karpov.  Karpov laughed and withdrew his hand. The soldier closed his eyes, thinking.  Remembering. "I didn't always do right by him, either. I tried. I made mistakes.  We were too poor for an orchid, so I got him tulips instead. The dame I asked, she said tulips were for forgiveness, and that's what I wanted.  Because I hurt him. Every day I hurt him. That's why he didn't come for me."
"...maybe it'll feel better tomorrow morning," suggested Tony.  "We'll all have breakfast and once it's daylight maybe Donner'll come to his senses.  ...come on, Steve." There was a small hint of rejection in his stomach that wasn't his.  "Steve, you sleep with me, in the master bedroom," said Tony quietly. "I need you," he added, because he got the sense that Steve was genuinely injured at not being included in Banksy's and George's little group.  It wasn't anyone's fault; Donner was simply too nervous to be around Steve.
"Rogers," whispered Bucky insistently.
In a way, Tony felt that the mark on Steve's neck was a punishment to him for being such a shit Alpha.  And he was willing to accept that and move on. He kept reminding himself that Steve was alive and they were talking again and that was all that mattered.
"How come there's a flashlight in your chest?"
"I better go," Steve said. "I don't want to be late. Seriously, help yourself to whatever. SHIELD certainly did," he muttered and stood, tucking his phone back away into his jacket pocket. "I'll be about three hours, give or take. If anyone from SHIELD calls around, don't let them in."
Tony dropped the water (spraying a bunch of it on Bethany, who squawked in alarm and surprise) and hurried over.
On stage, Steve was reconsidering the decision to fight Vanko.  Maybe Steve should have listened to Tony when he told him all of his suits would be stronger than him; one punch from its metal arm sent Steve flying.
There was Steve, leaning against a wall shirtless, an American flag splashed across his six-pack.
"Me neither," said Tony softly, hoarsely.  Remembering how he'd had to be physically restrained was embarrassing, to say the least.  If Happy and Pepper weren't there, he would have spent the whole flight trying to tear down the door to get to Steve.  He'd never lost his cool like that, especially not while sober.  "...but, like, us being scent-mates, that doesn't mean we
He was reminded again that Tony didn't know about Clint's family. He (probably selfishly) wished he could tell Tony. There was a point of no return, Steve had warned Clint. If he left it too late Tony really would be hurt. He'd try and pretend he wasn't, but he would be. And Steve hated keeping big secrets from his mate.
"Drink." Aria practically shoved the glass to his mouth and made him finish it. It turned out drunk Steve was a lot more angry and a lot more insecure - like most drunks, actually. Steve didn't look happy. He looked agitated, twitchy. He didn't feel sober anymore but his vision had stopped getting blurry around the edges, at least.
"You gonna drink anything or just sit there eating the peanuts?" asked the bartender as Bucky stared up at the television, idly munching from a bowl of nuts on the bar.
"You don't get it," he muttered darkly.  "You don't know what it's like to be a weak Alpha.  You don't know how it feels to-"  He stopped suddenly, realizing he was talking to someone who grew up in the twenties and thirties as an omega.  In America, in the those times, omegas couldn't attend college or join the army or vote.  Omegas were expected to be seen, not heard.  Omegas were expected to settle down with an Alpha who protected them and could mate them and sire children, and frankly, what the omega wanted wasn't really a factor.
Clint was on a lunch break and was currently consuming an entire pack of rainbow chocolate chip cookies for lunch. He was leaning against a balcony rail outside and then he felt his phone buzz in his pocket.
Natasha hinted to it a few times, but they didn't talk about their past much and neither of them pried much either. They were people of the present (or Steve, at least, tried to be). Nat didn't ask about the forties, Steve didn't ask about the KGB.
"But it's not against the rules, is it? Tony wearing one too?"
Tony wasn't sure, actually.  The boy smelled like an Alpha but his dominance was an utter mystery.  Trying to figure it out was baffling. It was like seeing 1 + 1 = 4 written on a blackboard and trying to figure out how such a conclusion had been reached.
But Steve couldn't remember. He
They were a boy and a girl, both somewhere between sixteen and eighteen.  The boy had dark skin and the moment Steve nearly stepped on him he snarled; the girl behind him was small, pale, light-boned, with blonde hair in a pixie cut.  An omega. And the boy--

"I fucking
Tony seemed a little...unhinged but he had just nearly died. Steve gently lead him to sit back down on the couch before he moved to go get his laptop from his bedroom. He almost rolled his eyes. "I have my own Wifi, Tony, I'm not
saying.  Same year," said Lola.
"I'll text Happy; we'll go by the ER on the way back, get you sorted out."
. He already has a dumb name; it's not even a nice dog-- anyway. The point is, don't go make your nose even worse."
Natasha looked between Tony and Steve with an amused glint in her eyes. She sauntered forward, hands on her hips, ever bit the confident Alpha and nothing less. She turned to Steve. "Симпатичный жакет."
"I...I keep telling you! He asked for HYDRA. He didn't ask for SHIELD.  But he didn't tell me anything, I swear.  Just that he wanted revenge!"
"I'm not looking for him because I want him Tony. I'm looking for him because I have to.
"You're going to be brilliant. There's a sketch where you're president and another one where you're a soccer coach!" Banksy said, squeezing Steve's shoulders. "I checked over all of them myself. There's just the right balance of funny and politics. I promise."
Tony eyeballed Annette thoughtfully.  "Yeah... yeah, just for a sec. 'Scuse me Reed, Steve..."  He rose, smoothing down his suit, following Annette toward the bar.  Tony often got claustrophobic at black-tie affairs and he wasn't really kidding about needing a drink.
bonded.  To
"What?" asked Steve.
"The very same."
"He wanted Pepper anyway, Nat, this is ticket out. Let him have it." Steve's voice was flat. He was retracting into himself, becoming a hardened soldier instead, because it was easier to deal like this. It was easier to be Captain America than Steve Rogers.
"I analyze all data available to me.  Your average love-making session is twenty-three minutes long.  Your average mating time is four minutes."
Steve turned away from them, pressing his forehead against the cool stone wall and dropping his goggles onto the floor. Fuck. He should have anticipated this, he should have known they'd use this against him.  Sure, they could induce heats in the forties, but with something as simple as a dart. It was a complicated process couples would go through when they wanted to time conception well to have a summer baby, or whatever. They used to put people in steam rooms and pump pheromones into the air for hours. In Steve's time, inducing a heat was difficult and expensive and time-consuming.  This had taken seconds.
With the towel hung low around his hips Steve searched through his new clothes, which had mysteriously found their way into a wardrobe.  Seriously, were the maids invisible or something?
"And we really do need to take your statement Cap," Mac added from the side. "They er, have G--
Steve had never known he was capable of moving so confidently. Sure, he was good in a fight but sexually he'd had about zero experience before Tony. Maybe it just the honeymoon. But the self-consciousness was fading and in its place was something new. Steve was being more himself, not holding back. He kinda liked it.
Tony's shoulders sagged.  He'd been so certain... he smushed a piece of potato under his toe miserably.  The other girl, presumably Banjo, rushed over silently with a dustpan to sweep away the mess immediately.
"What'd you want?" asked Tony suspiciously, taking the phone.
"Hi, Captain Rogers," she said, extending a hand to Steve.  She shut the door to her office and gestured for Steve to have a seat.  They had spoken before, part of routine evaluations, but nothing quite this personal.  As far as Steve's omega status and his relationship with Bucky, their previous conversation on the topic had taken mere seconds; she'd given her condolences regarding Bucky's death and moved on.
"...I don't know, I'll just... I'll take a bunch of suppressants or something..."
"I can't
It felt good when Tony had sucked at his neck and re-established his claim there and Steve's body had responded in turn, shivering in delight. But that was enough for Steve right. Baby steps.
"Miss Potts.  Colonel Rhodes is here," reported JARVIS.
this?"
Another benefit to their rigorous daily mating was that Tony's drinking ebbed.  It didn't stop, but at least now it could be measured in glasses as opposed to bottles.
Tony dropped his head on top of Steve's and sighed, relaxing.  The next week would be busy, but that was fine.  Tony liked being busy.  He had one week to train himself to be unflappable.  He knew what to expect from SHIELD now, at least.
"So you're just going to persuade a world class and criminally insane assassin to betray everything he's ever known?" Natasha asked. "That simple, huh?"
There was a mirror on the wall, and the other man was cinching up a tie, his back to Steve.  He was wearing a mauve shirt and a grey pinstripe waistcoat; his shoes were shined to a sharp black gleam.
"Oh my gosh," said the bartender.  "I-- I-- wow! What are you doing in England?"  She seemed to have forgotten she was supposed to be serving them.
Pepper exchanged a look with Aria, but obediently gathered up her tablet, put it in her purse, and slung the strap over her shoulder.  "Okay..."
it's hard, because you're an Alpha-"
Steve leaned forward, head in his hands and elbows on his knees. He'd stopped listening to their conversation; he honestly didn't care.
"Hey Steve.  Wow, something smells great.  Other than you, I mean.  Is that my robe?  I got an e-mail from the folks at SNL and they want you on the third.  Great, right?"  Tony pulled away from the machinery in front of him and pulling a hand covered in oil through his hair.  His face was smudged with grease and there was a noticeable tear in his shirt.  Steve had seen him like him a lot as a PA; Tony might have worn $15,000 watches and silk ties in public, but in his shop, he was content to lose himself in his work.  On more than one occasion, Steve had watched Pepper shriek and barely save one of the main floor's immaculate white pieces of furniture.  It was a testament to her involvement in Tony's life that none of the rest of the house had any oil stains anywhere; left to his own devices, Tony probably would have ended up accidentally ruining the carefully manicured living room upstairs.
...which was watching Tony play Tetris and miss a board meeting.
"...this healed good," he said with a tone of forced casualness, then added, "If you can stand sleeping with a guy who had a flashlight in his chest then I'm pretty sure I can get over one little scar."  He paused, then added glibly, "
"Steve," he said throatily.
Steve's heart was hammering.  They were lucky the ball had not hit anyone, because the force of it would have been enough to cause serious harm if it had.
"Steve!  Wow, you did so great up there, my heart was in my throat the whole time but you handled it like such a pro!" Taylor giggled.
"That's wonderful." Brennan smiled. "Do you know who it's with?"
Finally, he managed to tear his eyes away from Tony long enough to finish typing in the film name. When it popped up he clicked it and then dropped the remote before settling back against the sofa comfortably with Tony in his lap. This felt good, comfortable,
He was finding it too difficult to concentrate, however, on that particular mystery.  His thoughts were being crowded out by other things. Had Steve said DeSoto had been
"Yay, Steve," said Tony blearily, breaking out of his song to raise his glass.  Pepper snatched it out of his hand.
"...the fob unlocks it remotely.  It's, uh, it's push to start, there's just a button inside.  There's a chip in the fob," explained Tony, showing him which button to press.  The car chirped and lit up as he unlocked it.  "Trust me, it's fun, this thing is a
He tried to think of a good cause.
, this is
Steve thought he might be sick. "Right," he said, and pulled away. He got out his phone to text Tony quickly.
Tony stared out the window, watching the dark, crowded stone buildings pass them by.  How long, he wondered, before anyone found all those men? Or would one of them wake up first?  How many were dead? Was the guy with the missing hand going to die, too? Would that perhaps be better?
He sighed raggedly and held up the phone again as it began to ring. The number was still withheld.
Gideon sounded like he was smiling on the other line.  "So. When Donner comes home, my men will pick him up. Because nothing would make my day like seeing Captain America kneel for me, especially after what an awful day I've had with all of these... unfortunate accusations against the schools I had invested in.  I'm sure you understand the kind of wonderful stress relief Donner can provide. He's a sensitive soul and he loves better than being a good omega. Something
He gently moved to get off of Steve.  So Steve sounded like he might, possibly, want kids.
"I think we need to pay Jasper a visit," said Phil wearily.  "Either he's hiding something or he and Steve are a lot closer than we realized."
, if anything's offered to him, you take it, he doesn't like being handed things, page eight is a summary of--"
But Dr. Gleason had said he'd have a solution before Christmas.  That was promising. And it wasn't like Tony couldn't just get himself snipped again.
If JARVIS had any preferences, they often aligned with Tony's.  Thus, JARVIS picked up sarcasm and avoidance regularly. Tony tweaked his code to keep JARVIS from getting too unbearable.  If given enough time, Tony suspected JARVIS would eventually pick up his own personality, and the world had enough Tony in it, in Tony's opinion.
"What's two hundred and eighty-seven divided by thirty-six point eight?" they would yell.
"What's wrong with him?" asked Tony in alarm.
oh, boy... yep, I got a weird one, too... this guy's capitalization is all over the place..."  Tony tossed the letter aside.  "...don't worry, people send all sorts of shit... I mean I have literally been sent actual shit before... put the hair in the 'crazy weirdo' pile..."
"Can I hold your hand?" asked Bucky.  He was crying, though his expression was hard and neutral.  Steve got the impression he no longer made facial expressions very often.
His gaze flitted over Tony, slowly taking him in. "I don't like the beard," he said quietly but there no real bite to his words.
"You... you should get the phone!" he panted.  He was sweating, literally sweating.  The room reeked like pheromones, the same subtle, musky flavor he'd tasted in Monaco, right before Steve went into heat.
Jesus, Sarah Rogers would
Tony nodded back.  Okay.  That didn't seem so bad.  And besides, Tony should be familiarizing himself with the simulation, what to expect for his own evaluation next week.
He crawled into bed with Steve and settled back against the pillows, sinking into the bed with a sigh of satisfaction.  "So.  Which are we doing first...  blowjob or
He returned to a very drunk Tony sprawled out in bed. After setting the glass down he moved to sit Tony up in bed, a pillow cushioning his back and then Steve pressed the glass back into his hand. "Drink."
"Eric's a guy I met at the conference.  He's bonded to a girl named Piper. And I'll bet anything he purchased her... she's like seventeen and it sounds like she was sixteen when they bonded."
Him. Tony Stark.  Even worse, he was too aroused to care.
"Well I mention it 'cause I didn't even finish high school until last year," snapped George, a bit defensively.  He turned to Tony. "My Alpha got involved in an embezzlement scandal and was sent to some white-collar, resort-style prison.  Leaving
"I don't want HYDRA to find me, so I guess no....in that case I don't want him to find me," Steve said quietly. He saw no point in lying or trying to lie. "But if he wasn't with HYDRA I don't know how I'd feel," he admitted. If he wasn't safe for active duty then he didn't want to be put on it. Steve didn't have a right to put anymore lives at risk. What if one of the team had gotten badly hurt in his rescue mission? How would he feel then?
Steve barely contained a laugh. "Right. Sure."
He tried to distract himself by staring at the other guests, tracking their minute movements.  Pierce didn't come in until the main course was being served.  He didn't look happy; the hair on the back of his neck kept rising and he kept reaching up with irritation to flatten it.
The woman shuffled awkwardly, looking torn.
"No way," said Tony, bouncing on the balls of his feet.  "We've got places to do and people to be.  Time waits for no man.  It's Christmas; we got sledding to do!"
...must be the new reactor.
Sam smiled wryly. "That's why you told me to bring night vision goggles, huh?"
Karpov pulled open the book, cursing Dr. Ludheim softly under his breath.  "Желание. Ржавый. Семнадцать. Рассвет. Печь. Девять. Добросердечный. Возвращение на Родину. Один. Товарный вагон."
He aimed a fist at the wall, punched it, and then he leaned his head down, threading his fingers into his hair tightly. His shoulders shook.
Hal blinked. "Wow. I thought
"Yes, Director Fury.  That's what he's experiencing.  I can't wave a magic wand and make this any more interesting for you.  A person's subconscious sometimes goes strange places."
"We asked him!  We asked him if he was bonded and he said no!  None of the reports from the forties mentioned it.  They would have mentioned it, wouldn't they have?  Wouldn't Lukin had mentioned it?"
"Director Fury would like to meet with you this morning, Captain."
Eric looked over.  "Oh, yeah, the hospitality suite's always the place to be.  That's where they hold the charity auction, too. Plus there's a little corner for omegas, you know, for them to socialize.  Sometimes I drop Piper off for the day so she can hang out with her little friends, she loves it. Don't you, Pip?"
"I mean...what do we do when a heat comes around? Ideally I don't want to be pregnant any time soon. But they told me medication won't work. My body burns through it too fast... hell, when I was going to have a heat, they used emergency suppressants on me. My body burned through them in less than a minute."
Steve dropped like an invisible hand had pushed him down and in a second he was on his knees, head lowered respectfully, hands clasped behind his back.
"Why do you think that is, Captain?" asked Fury, tossing Steve's file onto a low table in front of them and fixing Steve with a stern, one-eyed glare.  Tony clung to Steve, not especially caring if anyone saw and judged them.  He had expected his feelings toward Steve to stabilize, but instead, they were stronger than ever.  The honeymoon period, Tony was discovering, wasn't about emotions going away.  No, it was just about learning to handle them.  Since mating properly, Tony's body, mind, and soul had begun fine-tuning themselves to Steve.  Tony felt like he could practically read the other's mind.  It was thrilling and terrifying how close Tony felt to him, and how close Steve probably felt to him.  Tony tried to console himself by thinking of Steve as an organic JARVIS.  It wasn't weird that JARVIS knew every little thought and attitude and emotion, so why should he care if Steve did?  Perhaps because Tony had never cared about anyone like this, except, perhaps, Pepper.  But Pepper was a beta and no matter how much Tony liked her (and he liked her a hell of a lot), they couldn't even physically achieve this kind of bond.  The sensitivity to Steve's emotions, his smells, his body language... this was deeply rooted in instinct, evolution, hundreds of thousands of years of Alphas and omegas adapting to each other.
"Are you serious?  No music! ...can you turn down the brightness on that thing?"  The arc reactor alone was practically a flashlight, but the eyes and the RT nodes in the palms weren't exactly subtle, either.
"But Stark isn't, is he? The age difference is quite significant, isn't it," Pierce commented harmlessly. "Whichever way you go."
?"  Tony raised an eyebrow.
The reporter looked delighted; she was filming the fight with relish.  Two billionaires going feral and trying to tear each other's throats out was excellent reporting; she was pretty sure she was going to get a raise after this.
Suddenly Maggie Frond appeared.  "You just love breaking rules, don't you?"
"да, сэр."
"Please," Steve hummed with a nod and a winning smile.
"Escorted at all times? What about when you need the toilet?" Steve asked, looking alarmed. He was going to break so many of those rules just by existing. He didn't behave 'appropriately' for an omega at all. Even if they kicked him out, though he guessed it would be funny, and make a point...
He squeezed Steve's hands, running his thumb comforting over the back of the other's hands.
"Salvinorin?" pressed Tony.
"F-for choosing Insight's targets."
"Perfect," echoed Tony, nuzzling Steve, rolling his head with the motion of Steve's pets.
Steve's gaze dragged between DeSoto and his Apha. Then back to the omega. He looked desperately like he wanted to say something but didn't. Steve moved to go with Tony and it was like the whole room relaxed again, the tension ebbing away as the situation broke down.
"How many are there?" asked Tony.
Bucky snapped to immediate attention.
Pepper's eyes widened when she saw him. Gleason looked significantly calmer, having already had the low down from Natasha. "Who on earth happened to you?" Pepper demanded, eyes wide. Gleason was already standing up, accessing Steve quickly.
Tony slung an arm around Steve's shoulders.  It was the first time they'd touched since Monaco; Tony was tipsy and when he was buzzed, he always got a little more touchy-feely.
Steve clung to Tony right back. He understood that the group could be intense.  That, and he could feel Tony's own discomfort. These people were so used to the horrors of the camps; it was hardly surprising that they were slowly becoming numb to it.
"Four just peeled off.  They're heading back to the Expo," reported Rhodey.  "They're trying to lure you back.  Don't take the bait."
Banksy stepped forward to rescue the situation, having already been informed that Donner was a fan. "Doctor Gleason is the best, I assure you. He's very clever, knows exactly what he's doing." Steve realised that Banksy was good at this. He was perhaps used to talking to brainwashed omegas who struggled with their own autonomy. But he was also talking to Donner like he was a child, certainly not a fully grown man. And that made Steve sad, somehow.
And then Steve sprinted and jumped, just landing on the rooftop next to their building before running on to the next. The snow was making the landing and take off harder than he'd anticipated.
Tony felt warm pressed up against his side.
"I did not," said Laura.
"Tony's on his way home," Aria announced, and Steve sat up quickly from his spot on the sofa. They'd had what Aria called a 'chill' day, eating Chinese takeaway (the hotel staff had looked horrified when they'd had to bring it upstairs).   Aria had made him binge watch a lot
