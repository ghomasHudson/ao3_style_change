The sun was well past its zenith when Ana found them outside silently feeding crumbs of bread to the chickens that clucked and scratched at the ground near their feet.
“Dammit, Tony. Is everything a joke to you?” Steve started to shout and remembered where he was, so he lowered his voice to an angry snarl. “Some people take their vows of celibacy seriously.” Suddenly he couldn’t bear to be in the room anymore, so he muttered, “I will sleep in the stable,” and barely refrained from slamming the door behind himself as he left.
made the tips of Steve’s ears go pink, even though he’d asked the same question almost every time they had the privacy for it. Steve seemed intent on making up for lost time by trying out every time of kiss he could think of, from chivalrous pecks on the cheek to deep, thorough kisses that left them both breathless. “Yes,” Tony said. He was trying to be strong, but he was too weak to deny himself this; not now, when he might not…Tony shook his head to dispel the thought before it could spoil the moment, because Steve was coming around the desk and Tony’s heart was already starting to race in anticipation.
“No one believes the confessions,” he said, taking a sip of wine.  “Not when they are made from inside an Iron Maiden. But they are making it difficult to defend the Templars, at least publically.”
Bucky grimaced. “Terrible. Where are we?”
Stark raised an eyebrow. “First, for the love of God please stop calling me Stark.  If nothing else, call me Tony, though you should get in the habit of referring to me as Brother Eduard so long as we are on this ill-considered mission. Second, virtuousness isn’t measured by misery, Rodgers. God doesn’t care if you sleep in comfort.”
were looting,” Steve said with a frown.
“His Excellency has many urgent matters to deal with right now.” Steve could see the alarm in the man’s eyes, but he was otherwise unmoved. Steve would commend him for his bravery when he ever got to speak to Tony; it wasn’t many that would stay fast in front of Steve in a rage. He was strongly tempted to move the man and find Tony himself, but knew that was probably the last thing Tony would want. If he hadn’t come to check on Bucky, it was because something important was keeping him.
“Looks like I’m going to meet your Cardinal Stark,” Bucky said a few days later after matins. He held up a cream-colored piece of paper and Steve recognized the neat, sloping handwriting on it. “He’s holding a dinner and the Grand Master has charged me to go in his place as his trusted advisor.”
Steve inhaled sharply. “I-I can’t-”
Sam looked at him approvingly. “An infidel that knows the wisdom of al-Kindi,” he said. “Will wonders never cease. Yes, I did use al-Kindi’s methods. My family moved from Baghdad to al-Andalus, and we brought his knowledge with us.” He patted the barrels fondly. “We have started a distillery in Al-Barracin and I had the idea to start selling our goods to the rich infidels to the north.”
“He’s certainly a Templar,” Sister Natasha said, “but he is sticking to his story with an admirable tenacity. Too much so, if you ask me, like he’d been prepared for questioning.”
“Poison,” he said. “Stane has poisoned him, and there’s no antidote. I need the grail, and I pray that it works as Bucky says it does.”
was the real sin, not...not what I was feeling.”
at me while I’m on my deathbed.”
to and confess when you make mistakes.”
“If you won’t let me see him, at least give him a message,” Steve insisted for the fourth time.
Smiling gently, Steve pulled Tony’s chair away from the desk so he could lean over him and press a soft kiss to the corner of Tony’s eye, light as a butterfly. Tony let out a shuddering breath and his eyes fluttered closed at the contact as he did the same to the other. The brush of Steve’s lips moved to Tony’s temple, then down to the corner of his mouth. Tony turned his head to chase his mouth but Steve pulled away. He cupped Tony’s face and ran a thumb over his bottom lip. Tony licked his lips and felt a curl of heat at the noise Steve made deep in his chest. His hands tightened on the arms of his chair again, this time with the desire to curl his hands in Steve’s hair, to pull him down and draw more sounds from him. But once he started, he didn’t know if he would be able stop. Like a drowning man yearning for land, Tony ached for Steve, but he couldn’t reach for what he wanted. Not so long as his life belonged to Stane.
“Suit yourself.”
They’re two drinks in before their dinner arrives, and Tony’s eyes are half-lidded with the beginnings of intoxication. Steve is along the same route.
So, scene seven: standing on Steve’s balcony, standing closer than we need to, like always. After our debrief Steve had seen me slumped over my desk, exhausted, aching for a drink. He touched the back of my wrist.
Natasha rubs Steve’s back and it does begin to soothe him, but he’s loathe to admit it.
“Okay,” Steve says, putting his bag down. He hears Tony sit down on the bed.
Tony laughs. “Knew you wouldn’t be easy.”
and there is no need to attempt—he feels like something has shifted between them, and he doesn’t know how to fix it.
Stark tilts his head and assesses Steve. “Of all the goons Obidiah’s sent after me, you’re certainly the stupidest.”
Steve snorts. “Sounds about right.”
“Well, the team’ll have to see it anyway,” Tony says, smile morphing into a smirk.
Steve wants so hard to believe him it hurts.
Beneath it, though, is a grain of doubt: Why? Why did he keep it hidden? Especially now—after all the truth came spilling out of them, crystallizing into something Tony held dear. And after all Steve had said, about keeping secrets, about
“You’re fine
“He tried to kill you!” Tony slams his hands against the workbench, sending a loud, resounding clang around the room. “You almost died,” he says, and he’s standing now, breathing hard, almost chest to chest against Steve.
Tony’s enthusiasm was strong enough that Steve didn’t have the energy to argue with him, especially since he didn’t have a good reason to protest. Tony went inside to negotiate for a place to sleep while Steve took care of the horse and wagon.
“Very well.” With an internal sigh, Steve sat down across from Stark, sitting so stiffly his spine didn’t even touch the back of the chair.  He took the paper Stark handed him and started skimming the financial calculations written out in a cramped but elegant hand.
Tony held his hands up and retreated in the face of Natasha’s righteous fury. “If I had said anything, you both would have rushed down here,” he protested. “And that would have put you in Stane’s path. I wasn’t going to risk you.”
“My immortal soul appreciates all your hard work,” Tony said dryly.  When the space was clean, he gestured for her to sit in the chair across from his desk.
“Continue,” Stark said as the stringing stripe on Steve’s back ebbed.
“Come in.” He sat up straight and tried to look alert as Steve came in, carrying a tray of food. Though the smell of the food made him nauseous, under Steve’s concerned eyes he forced himself to reach for the bread and tear off a bite. Steve sat and looked at the piles of paper on Tony’s desk with sympathy.
“Oh?” Tony said, darkly amused. “My father would have disagreed with you.” He pushed himself up from his chair and crossed the room to a table on the far side. There was a tray there, with an untouched plate of food on it, but it had a bottle of wine on it as well and that's what Tony reached for.
Steve felt the knot in his chest start to ease at the prospect of having a place to start looking, and he rolled his neck and shoulders, which had gone tight with his sudden anger. He had to sit on his hands to keep from tearing the reins from Tony’s hands to urge the horse to move faster than the slow walk they were traveling at now. “Speaking of blacksmithing,” he said after a while, “Why are you called the Iron Cardinal?” He'd been wondering that ever since Stark's letter had gotten him entrance into the monastery, all smiles with no questions asked, not even who Steve was or where he came from. The lack of an immediate response made him look over, and to his surprise, he saw that Stark’s cheeks were ruddy.
“The power of life or death,” Bucky said, and if Bucky hadn’t sounded so afraid Steve would have thought Bucky was trying to pull one over on him. “One is a cup that gives life, another is a spearhead that takes it away. One relic, Jesus’s knife from the Last Supper, creates many things from one and another, the sudarium, gives a weak and weary man the vigor of a stallion. There is also a crown of thorns that makes the wearer unable to tell a lie.”
“You’re right,” Steve said finally. “But I don’t like it. You need to take better care of yourself.”
“Brother Steve, Brother Eduard, please, stay a moment. I have something I must ask you.” Sam tucked his hands into the wide sleeves of his burnoose. “I apologize if I am presuming on our short acquaintance, but I cannot help but feel that you had more than a passing interest in Hydra. If you are planning to investigate the presence of the Hydra in these lands, I would like to join you. I have always been ashamed that my family ran instead of confronting them and I do not want to miss my chance again.”
Steve’s thoughts shattered as the finger withdrew and then two were sliding in with the same gentle but inexorable pressure as the first had, the renewed stretch taking Steve’s breath away. The fingers pulled out and slid in again, and Steve buried his face in the pillow, stifling his moan. There was another sharp smack on his ass where the pain of the first slap had faded to a dull heat, making Steve’s cock throb. “Don’t deny your God the sounds of your fervor,” Stark said sternly. “Praise to the heavenly father should always be on your lips.”
“Are you sure? We still have plenty of daylight left.” Plenty was probably overstating it, but Steve was strangely reluctant to be around other people right now. Tony was already smiling and greeting the locals, and it made Steve even more reluctant to stop.
Steve’s heart was pounding in sickening thuds in his chest as he raised his hand to knock, fear and excitement warring in his chest. It was always thus when he came to Stark’s door, ever since the first time, but tonight it was worse. Worse because he hoped that tonight a line would be crossed, a line that Steve dreaded to approach even as he longed to fling himself across it.
“Open,” Stark murmured, putting pressure on Steve’s lower lip, and Steve opened his mouth eagerly, eyes sliding closed as Stark’s cock becomes a hot pressure on his tongue, soft skin around hard flesh. He closed his lips around Stark’s cock as it slid deeper until it was almost in his throat, and he swallowed reflexively around it and was rewarded with a sharp exhale and Stark’s hand cupping his jaw.
"Sister Natasha?" Tony said with surprise. After checking to make sure no one was lingering near his room, Tony leaned out the window and said, “You can come up now.” He stepped back and then offered her a hand as she climbed over the sill, straightening her wimple and shaking the dirt from her robes. “I'm surprised to see that you came yourself, I know you hate leaving Paris,” he said. "Anything wrong?"
“Impossible,” Steve protested, and Stark made a gesture for him to settle down so he swallowed down his angry words.
“And just how do you propose to do that?”
Steve’s hands tightened on the grail. “You will have to take this from me by force, and then bind me tightly to something sturdy to keep me from taking this to Tony
“Just a group of like-minded individuals,” Stane said dismissively. He got up for the decanter of wine, refilling his own glass and topping up Tony’s.
rut against Steve until completion.
, in a way that he hasn’t been in a long time—even in encounters that aren’t filmed. Steve keeps looking up at him, checking to see if he’s enjoying, and he’s unbearably gorgeous, and god, Tony could write sonnets about his mouth, his tongue, his eyes, the way his breath felt hot against Tony’s skin.
“What’s that?” Tony asks, gesturing to Steve’s sketchbook.
He bristles at the pregnant silence, understands it for what it is: Tony expecting an apology, too. Steve takes a sip of coffee, stalling. He didn’t do anything wrong, he rationalizes. He didn’t hurt anyone, he just got drunk and took a nap. And what has Tony done, anyway? They’re nowhere close to finding Bucky, and if Steve is being honest, finding Bucky would fix everything—Steve’s thoughts stop when Tony shifts and the cold air seeps into the space between them. Steve sighs.
Steve cracks open another egg, and casts a glance to the kitchen door, checking to see if there’s anyone in the living room outside. He takes a breath to steady himself. Tony is standing beside him again, watching Steve cook with some interest. Everything about this is familiar; he’s cooked for Tony before. But this feels different, like they’re teetering on the edge of something new.
“JARVIS, could you let me know when people are…” Steve pauses. “Close to my general person?”
“There were literally hundreds, maybe thousands of HYDRA agents, we don’t know it was him!”

permission, to look for him?”
“I do,” Steve says, returning to resting his face against Tony’s chest.
Tony laughs. “Yeah, because you’re cute.”
“Put me in for 50, but Steve.”
“What,” Steve says, and his voice is rough from sleep. He pushes himself up a little. “Is that cake?”
, Steve thinks.
“Nothing much to talk about,” Steve lies. He doesn’t know where to begin, so it’s easier not to.
After a few listens to the playlist, Steve decides he likes 70s music. Steve closes his eyes and listens to Simon & Garfukel, knowing full well that if anyone from the team walked in on him right now, they’d say he was the perfect caricature of an old man.
“Go on, sit beside him.”
“Tony,” Steve whispers, tilts Tony’s head up, forcing Tony to meet his eyes. “I want you. Just you.”
, Steve thinks, but it’s a pyrrhic victory at best.
“And we don’t know it wasn’t! The only reason you’re not even considering the possibility is—”
Steve wakes up and keeps his eyes closed as he takes in his surroundings. It’s a habit formed from the war, and Steve relaxes as he concludes that he’s in a hospital or something similar. Steve opens his eyes to confirm, and they land immediately upon a familiar shock of dark hair by his bedside.
Steve is wrapping up his story, and Tony, who had removed his jacket sometime earlier, now loosens his tie, and begins to roll up his sleeves. Steve’s eyes track the movement of Tony’s hands, and Steve only realizes he's stopped talking when Tony looks up at Steve from under his lashes, hand still on a partially rolled sleeve. “And then?” he prompts. Steve starts, then looks away, clearing his throat.
Steve shakes his head. “Sure I haven’t,” he says, still a bit stung.
He’s lulled to sleep by the sound of Tony’s even breaths.
“I didn’t vomit on your shoes,” Steve tries for indignance, but it comes out weak, watery.
“Tony,” Steve starts, and Tony lifts his eyes up so they meet Steve’s. “I want you to know that for the longest time, I thought that finding Bucky would fix everything—myself included.” Steve pauses, and Tony nods at him, chewing his lip.
Cold. Wet. Steve opens his eyes long enough for his vision to clear and in front of him: Tony, holding an empty glass.
“What is it?” Bruce asks, wringing his hands as JARVIS scans the package before they open it.
“This—no,” Steve says again, turning it over in his hands.
Tony settles his hands on Steve’s hips, then hooks his foot around Steve’s pushing it forward. “Okay, so you kinda just—” Tony pushes against Steve’s left hip, and pulls at the right. Steve follows the pressure, and feels a bit hot around his collar, his body alight with the casual intimacy.
“You making lunch for two?”
This snaps Steve out of his thoughts. “Why?”
“To look so good,” Tony murmurs.
There are some days when Steve remembers Punta Fuego. He imagines lying down on a beach towel, half-asleep as the waves lap against the sand. The afternoon sun is warm against his skin, and his fingers are still sticky from when he’d unpeeled a mango and eaten it with his hands. Tony had laughed, reached over and wiped the juice off his chin. The palm leaves sway and shift with the wind.
Steve smiles up at him. “Yeah. That was nice.” Tony grins and presses a quick kiss on Steve’s nose. They’re quiet for a moment, content to breathe the same air.
“Sounds like it worked.”
Steve has assembled ingredients for spaghetti on the kitchen counter, which Tony notices.
Well. That was a new thought.
So, it just means, well. It means it’s fine.
“Well, it is mine,” Steve says, frowning.
They’re quiet, for a moment. Ella Fitzgerald is singing softly over the speakers:
His head still feels fuzzy, and he drags himself back to bed, then asks JARVIS if Tony’s up. He knows it’s a futile effort at this time of day, but asks anyway, just in case.
“To what?” Thor asks, still laughing, but getting up anyway. Tony seems to have noticed this movement, and is now suddenly standing right beside Steve.
Thankfully, Tony does. It feels strange, to be in this space again, to have this kind of conversation with Tony where they’re talking
Natasha takes it from him.
Pepper sets her cup aside and wedges herself beside Tony. “I’m sorry,” she says, hugging Tony and kissing his cheek. “I was just curious.”
“Took you long enough.”
“Oh, Cap, no. We can get take out. Where did you even find these—” he holds up a mushroom and looks at it dubiously.
Tony nods gravely. “That’s a fuck ton to process, Cap,” he says. “So, I guess you want my help finding Barnes?”
“Is that a yes?” Steve asks, using his body to keep Tony pinned down on the couch.
Steve pads out of his bedroom and stops when he sees Tony in the kitchen, leaning against the counter as he types on his phone. The kettle is beginning to sing, and Tony huffs and drops his phone before turning off the flame.
Tony beams. “Well, I’m free now, wanna start practicing?”
“But I don’t think it would be good for us to, you know.” Tony makes a movement with his hands, as if not knowing what words to use. “Not like this.”
“Where’d you come from?” Steve asks after having a drink. All other questions are moot, at this point; it’s Tony. Steve thinks that Tony probably has JARVIS monitor the team, alert him on big enough crises. He’s probably here because he saw the helicarriers explode, and came to check on Natasha, then dropped by to check in on Steve, since he was already in the area. It’s probably just a coincidence he was here when Steve woke up.
“We can always—no, look, we do as much as we can as best as we can and sometimes that’s it. There’s never going to be enough.” Tony lets out a huff of breath. “And now you have to believe me, because it’s
Steve wants to have fun; he’s just never really been good at it.
“New York,” Tony says, tilting his head a little as he regards Steve. “How’d you get out of the water?”
“What if they did make a serum, what if my dad succeeded?”
Steve wanders around the city a bit more, following crowds until he ends back at the Plaza Mayor. The Old City looks beautiful, lit up by bright lights strategically placed to highlight building facades, the crowds bustling with university students and tourists.
“Better for me to choke you with, for making me worry like that,” Steve says darkly as he continues to grope around the cavity in Tony’s chest. He tries not to dwell on that too much.
“Maybe we’ll see each other again,” Tony says. He snakes his hand under Steve’s chin and tilts his face up. “RIght?”
“Getting ordered about in my own home!” Tony says mock-indignantly as he snatches the bowl from the table and strides toward the kitchen.
, has ever been low-risk.
Tony sighs, sets his tablet aside, and takes off his glasses. “Well, come in.”
“That wasn’t the suit?”
“A couples retreat,” Tony mutters to himself, standing by the elevators and waiting.
“What?”
Tony frowns. “Are you asking because you don’t know, or because you want to psychoanalyze me?”
Two days later, Tony settles on having to review related literature. In this case, this means sitting alone in the workshop as he relives every moment when Steve was distracted. Was that a sign? In a brief moment of clarity, Tony asks: “Fri, am I crazy?”
Tony huffs. “Yeah.”
“Anyway,” Steve says again. “I just wanted to check up on, on…” Steve falters, realizes how strange it will sound if he says “you,” so instead, he opts to say: “Us.”
, Steve thinks. There’s a part of him that just wants to hear the words from Tony’s mouth. After all this time, he’s never said no, never said he
Tony shrugs, as if regretting bringing this all up in the first place. “Being real, I don’t know why I’m bringing it up now. There are too many things we still don’t know. I didn’t want to say anything preemptively.”
—let them think otherwise.
“Tower first,” Tony croaks out, when they finally get into the quinjet. “Reactor,” he explains, before passing out.
“Kiss me?” Tony asks sweetly, his eyes fluttering up from Steve’s lips to meet his yes. Steve feels a flush rise to his cheeks, and raises his hand to cradle the base of Tony’s skull. Steve takes a moment to look at Tony, to really, really look at him, before leaning in to press their lips together.
Steve stands and moves to a central panel in the quinjet. He pulls up a schematic of the base and says, “Okay. Here’s the plan.”
“I feel like we should have a stake in this pool,” Tony says, then turns to Steve. “What do you think?”
"I can feel you staring," Tony says accusingly, but it's undercut by the smile on his lips.
She looks at him, unimpressed. Steve opens his mouth to say more, but she shoos him away from her. He finally gives in to himself and rests his hand on top of Tony’s. He wants to do a proper pat down, see if anything’s broken or sprained, but it seems a bit too much to do while Tony’s asleep. For now, Steve finds some comfort in Tony’s pulse, beating slow under his palm.
,” Tony says.
“It’s okay,” Steve whispers, even if it’s not, not really, not yet at least, it’s just—“It’s okay.”
“Maybe you’d like to take some time off so you can read.” he gestures to the book in Tony’s hand, only to notice Tony's white-knuckled tony’s grip on it.
Steve smiles into the kiss—he can’t help it.
He thinks back to the last time he’d taken a walk around town, how he’d seen a first edition of
What did that mean?
“You have me,” Tony gives Steve’s hand a quick squeeze, aiming for reassuring. “You have me, and Natasha, and Bruce, and yeah, I guess Thor and Clint if you’re so inclined,” Tony tries for a laugh, but fails miserably. “You have us,” Tony finishes, and looks at Steve again.
Steve wakes up with a jolt. He sits up slowly, listening for what could’ve woken him up, but he already has a feeling—someone’s in his apartment. He’s immediately alert and sets aside the irritation of being woken up from a pleasant dream. He’s been having more of those, recently, and while they were mostly pleasurable, Steve still felt a little confused by the dreams--and the man who featured most prominently in them.
Tony remembers lying down and staring up at the trees, blinking as the sun peeked through the leaves.
Steve takes out a book from his bag, tries and fails to focus on it as the man comes back to check on him periodically. Steve feels a little hysterical, doesn’t want to think it means anything, maybe they’re just trained to provide great service.
They call me a genius.
“JARVIS, time?”
“Just.” Tony sighs again, long and deep. “Who gave him the right, you know?”
“Good morning,” he says, barely hiding the laugh from his tone.
Tony nods, still looking a bit put out.
So just like that, they’re kissing. It’s a very stiff kiss, not that Steve has much experience to go by, but they’re holding themselves away from each other and their lips are just pressed together, unmoving.
“I was trying to remember what I’d said for you to respond that way!” Tony says indignantly.
Steve pushes himself up so Tony’s seated on his lap, their faces only a few inches away from each other. Steve worries at his lip. “Tony, what do
They only have three months to get their cover established, so they go on dates almost weekly. On their second date—a leisurely stroll in Central Park, Tony had leaned over and wiped some ice cream off Steve’s chin.
“Yes, Natasha made me watch it.”
Steve takes a steadying breath. “Okay,” he says, more to himself than to Tony.
Steve reaches out to still the movement. “You,” he says.
“Am I wrong to have hoped that we’d just wake up and act as if everything was resolved already?” Tony grumbles.
Tony has given him so much. It’s not like Steve owes him this, the trust—Tony would hate that sentiment. But this moment, the quiet, it’s an avenue Steve had traversed years ago, with Bucky. To let someone see him,
“No you’re not,” Steve says, rubbing up and down his arms. “Tony. Look at me.”
“Which part of it?” Tony groans, dumping his bags on the floor then falling, face-first, onto the couch.
Clint snorts in response, used to the melodrama of Morning Tony.
Steve shakes his head in response. “No you don’t,” he says, a teasing grin still on his face.
“I didn’t ask you—” Steve starts.
“Well, anything, really,” Tony says, and for the first time, he looks a little confused. It’s a new look, and Steve’s oddly charmed by it. “It’s not like we’re being recorded or anything.”
So the team comes together, more and more, and eventually, it’s not just Tony and Steve in the tower. Steve spars with Natasha, learns to play videogames with Clint, finally figures out what Pilates is with Bruce, and then, one fateful night, drinks with Thor. It’s one of the few times Steve sleeps straight through until morning.
He knows that standing outside on the balcony, even if at this point the team left him alone when he was out here, meant the possibility of seeing Tony, of having Tony come up to him, of having Tony start the conversation.
“Hey,” Tony says, crouching down beside Steve and resting his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “You all right?”
Lying on those white sheets, the smell of antiseptic making Steve feel dizzy, he knows, deep in his bones, that he’d be dead before he ever stopped looking for his best friend.
Rhodey tips his head back and stares at the ceiling, and he’s about to fall asleep when he hears Tony whisper, “I don’t trust myself around him.”
Chapter four:
“I—” He’s wanted this for so long, but he’s never learned the words for desire. “I’m afraid I’ll say something wrong,” Steve whispers.
Of course, it makes sense; what else was all the foreplay for if not for them to finally feel comfortable touching each other like this? Really, they’re selling it so well that during one movie night, two months in, Clint looks annoyed when Steve drapes his arm over Tony’s shoulders.
“Are they really so strict about it?” Steve asks.
The nice thing—the
They’d met at a charity auction by chance, Tony had won the bid on Steve’s art.
Tony’s in the make-up chair, being fussed over by Jan, when Steve arrives. Tony doesn’t bother hiding how he stares at Steve, who is beautiful and somehow, still looking a bit shy.
Thor is sure that both he and Steve notice that Tony stands a little straighter, despite his sputtering.
Tony is sitting across Steve, pointedly avoiding eye contact. There’s a tight set to his jaw, and Steve briefly considers saying something if only to ease that look off Tony’s face. He decides against it, because he’s the reason for the look in the first place.
“UGH,” Clint says again, then throws a pillow at them. “You’re going to bleed me dry with shit like that.”
They walk back to Steve’s apartment quietly, and Tony frowns at the glass Steve hands him.
Tony holds his shirt closed, looking wide-eyed.
“Yeah, what a coincidence,” Steve says, even if it isn't. They all rotate on sets in the large warehouse, schedules crammed tight as shoots go on almost ‘round the clock. It’s cheaper that way, and it’s not like their audience keeps track or comments on it.
Try as Tony might—and he’s
at Steve, but Jan tugs on his hair and makes him straighten back up. “Good. Excited about today,” he says, knowing he sounds nonchalant in spite of how he feels.
“I bring gifts!” Thor announces brightly. They all pick up a flask, examining them closely. “The finest Asgardian mead, for Earth’s mightiest warriors.”
This is a familiar scene, now, Steve thinks, as he stands on the balcony with a cup of sweet coffee, surveying the city.
“We’ll do it together, Tony. If you’ll let us.”
They greet each other with an embrace, and it’s so ingrained in Steve to kiss people on the cheek in greeting that he only realizes he’s done it when Tony raises his eyebrows at Steve, surprised.
That night seemed like it’d be another image added to the montage.
“Steven Grant Rogers. Are you
Beside him, Tony shifts, trying to get comfortable as they lie down on the large lounge chair on the deck. It’s quiet, save for the sound of the surf and the occasional chirp of a cricket.
“The first one that actually caught my eye,” Tony said.
They’re piled together in front of Tony’s massive television and watching
Tony’s covering his mouth, but Steve can see how the skin around Tony’s eyes are crinkling up; he’s smiling. Steve feels inexplicably flooded with relief, and smiles as well.
Steve feels the heat of Tony’s body against his, and Tony shifts, and
“Tony?” Bruce’s voice is rough. He sounds annoyed.
It’s discomfiting, to be looking at Tony like this. Mostly because at this point it’s harder to pretend that he isn’t in love.
“Did we?” Tony asks, peering at Steve.
Steve swears again, flexing his hand before typing a response.
each other for a while, then. Happy?”
Steve falls into the strange focus afforded by creativity, so he doesn’t register JARVIS’ low cough. Instead, Steve’s hand stills over the page when he hears the doorknob turn, the door open.
I nodded. “Me too.”
Of course, it isn’t that fair a match. Still, Tony gives as hard as Steve, and he manages to flip Steve onto his back twice. Steve feels like a coiled wire, reminds himself to pull his punches, and then Tony maneuvers Steve onto his back. It’s a jiu-jitsu move that he remembers Natasha teaching them, and all the air in Steve’s lungs come out in one big
Clint is dozing against one of the walls of the quinjet when they arrive. Natasha and Tony soon follow, and make their way wordlessly towards the cockpit, Tony maneuvering around equipment while drinking from a metal tumbler.
“Mind me,” Tony mewls, his breath hot against Steve’s side. “I’m
He smiles to himself when he sees, in his periphery, Steve duck his head and blush.
Steve decides not to respond--he doesn’t want Stark to think he can just banter with him. After all, Steve still has to fulfill the contract.
They don’t talk anymore about Steve after that, instead recount the shenanigans they’d gotten into the night before. Rhodey leaves after helping clean after lunch, and before Tony realizes it, he’s alone again.
“Ugh.”
“Shut
Tony blinks his eyes open. "Never."
Except, he’s the opposite of that. He opens his mouth readily when Tony kisses him, knows how to move his body, and seems to share Tony’s preternatural awareness of the camera. They move in sync, shifting their bodies to best show the camera their actions.
each other, rather than
“Stay for a while?”
And Steve, ever the considerate, kind, loving man that he was, never asked.
“I meant,” Steve says quickly, all his words bumping into each other in the air. “We’re okay, right?” Steve asks, then adds: “I mean, I shouldn’t have, you know. That. But I also just want us to be okay.”
Tony flicks the roach into the air, watching as it floats down into the empty alley in the back of Steve’s building.
Bruce furrows his brow. “You seemed to know how to deal with it,” he presses.
I breathed in through my nose, my own eyes shut against Steve’s chest. We’re so close that I can feel the heat of his breath against the collar of my shirt.
We didn’t say anything, once we were lying down. First both facing up, then he touched my arm and I curled against him because I know that’s what he wanted. He slid his arm under my neck, closed his eyes and wrapped his other arm around my waist and pulled me closer.
“We shouldn’t have let it go that far.”
“I guess Nat told you,” Tony says.
“Really good, right?” Tony turns to Steve and grins. Steve nods, still reeling with how well done the movie was. “You know, that was Howard’s favorite,” Tony says.
“No!” Steve says, whipping his head up to stare accusingly at the ceiling. (he stopped feeling silly about talking to the walls a long time ago). “Just be, you know. Casual about it.”
Looking back at it now, I was a fool to consider Steve’s apartment a haven. But it was learned behavior, pavlovian—every time I’d go there, he would touch me, and I would touch him, simple and chaste, except in the four corners of that space I didn’t have to think of what it would look like to anyone else.
“Yeah,” Tony murmurs, still turned away from Steve.
They’re quiet for a moment, then Tony says, “You’ve been avoiding me.”
He’s never been this close to Tony, close enough to see how close his shave is, to feel the faint ghost of Tony’s breath on his chin. Steve blinks, slow, languorous, before moving closer.
Steve distinctly hates this feeling. The need to remember, pick up the small fragments of lucidity from the night before. He was drinking alone in his apartment, and he remembers stumbling into the elevator, laughing at the absurdity that he was talking to a robot in the ceiling, and that robot was going to bring him down to Tony.
Tony sighs. “That woman.”
Steve’s about to pack up, make a dash down the building to catch Stark before he makes his exit, but Stark’s gaze locks on his. He smirks at Steve, then winks.
A box is left at the entrance of the tower, unmarked. The man who left it had covered enough of his face to make JARVIS have to work at finding him.
I didn’t want to break first, but how could I not?
Tony looks up with a start. “You know what he did?”
Steve reaches up and tucks Tony’s hair behind his ear. “You, hopefully.”
“Hey, seven PhDs, how do I form a proper hypothesis?”
Instead, Tony says: “Yeah, kinda.”
Natasha sips her drink and pops another olive into her mouth. Yes, she was curious, but she knew better than to push; Tony was more hyper-verbal than usual tonight, and she always liked being people’s sounding board.
Strangely, it has the opposite effect. Somehow, Steve feels like a dancing monkey again.
Steve slips his gun out from his bedside table, throws open his curtains to give him more light. He can hear the light steps of whoever has broken in, and he’s pretty sure this is his moment of reckoning—a former mark’s family member, someone from Stane’s gang finally tired of waiting and tying up a loose end, hell, it could be Tony Stark himself except Steve’s pretty sure he couldn’t be stealthy if his life depended on it. If it were Stark, he’d probably have just hacked into Steve’s microwave and made it explode.
“Steve,” Tony has let go of his wrist and stands to rest his hand on Steve’s shoulder. Steve feels his breath getting shorter and shorter.
Steve begins walking back to his own car, stopping only when his phone beeps.
“Why does it matter?” Tony asks, deflating all of the sudden and sinking down to sit beside Rhodey. “Why can’t you just believe me?”
Steve wakes up from his dream with a jolt: His chest arching off the bed, hands gripping the sheets. He feels hot all over, his body reacting to his dream: trapped in ice, but awake, watching the world go by, stuck.
Steve buries his face in Tony’s chest again as he feels a blush rise to his cheeks. “So you did see my sketches,” he says.
Steve stands up from his chair, leans over, and pulls Tony close. Through the haze of it all—the swirling effects of liquor and drugs, the surprise, still, of Tony’s confessions—the real revelation comes in the way Tony’s lips feel against his, quiet as a promise.
Tony lets out a small huff of laughter. “Oh, you know. Got tired of it.”
“Well,” Tony smirks. “I’ve always loved a nice ass.” He laughs, it’s an affected thing.
“What about you?”
“I didn’t want to worry you,” Steve says very quietly.
He curses again as he flips his laptop open. His desktop is a mess, flooded with icons and random files, but he knows what he’s looking for.
“You don’t know what you’re saying.”
Steve sighs and rubs his eyes.
“This was really a thing?” Steve says, eyebrows knit as he tries to do the dance properly.
JARVIS answer is undercut by Thor waltzing into the kitchen, Natasha in tow. Natasha’s gaze immediately zeroes in on Tony’s hand on Steve’s wrist, and Steve pulls away, as if electrocuted.
Steve smiles, eyes still on his tablet, as he pats Tony’s thigh, trying to appease him.
Tony frowns. “You sure?”
Rhodey holds his hands up—a practiced gesture, as he’s used to these outbursts from either of them.
“I’ll believe it when I see it.”
“I don’t know,” he whispered, leaning over me and adding more pressure against my wrists.
Tony shuts his eyes and counts backward from five. “Why didn’t you just tell me?”
Chapter one:
. This is not how his vacation was supposed to start.
Tony’s manager waved them off early, and Steve left a generous tip while Tony was putting on his jacket.
Tony bites down on his lip, which feels dangerously close to wobbling. “Rhodey, you are honestly my favorite person in the whole world.”
The air felt thick. I didn’t move, and Steve didn’t either. For a few moments, all we did was breathe, knowing full well how close we were, close enough for one of us to finally make a move.
Steve perks up immediately and heads towards the door.
Steve stares at him, shocked. “What, because of Bucky?”
Later that night, fully recovered and back in bed, Steve realizes two things. First, that he’d referred to the tower as
Peter laughs, a small, nervous thing. “All the more to be grateful to you both, then,” he says. “Mind if I start recording?”
you,” Steve says, hugging Tony closer to him. He looks up at Tony, resting his chin right on Tony’s sternum. “Was that our first fight?”
Steve wakes up and immediately, with no preamble or forethought, wishes he didn’t. His breath comes out in short bursts as images from his dream surface and fade just as quickly: snow, a train, a hand in his, a scream.
Under the carrying tray of the coffee Rhodey had bought is a slip of paper, and Tony picks it up. It’s Steve’s card.
“Hi,” Tony answers slowly, chucking the towel he was using into a bin and making his way over to Steve. “What’s happening?”
Tony pulls away and blinks at Steve. “You do?”
Steve smiles up at Tony. “Me too.”
“Okay,” Sam says, leaning against the kitchen counter and scrolling through his phone. Steve frowns, noting Sam’s feigned indifference.
“Bad ones, all of them,” Tony says, and Steve knows it’s true. He’s about to say,
, and Steve has to agree, huffing out a small laugh.
The counselor, Janet, discusses the importance of establishing clear lines of communication, of fostering a relationship that is open to discussions and disagreements. Tony bumps his shoulder against Steve’s, as if to say,
Tony’s blush deepens, and Thor laughs.
“But that’s all it was,” Tony says, and Steve notices the edge to Tony’s voice. “It was an accident. Besides, I’m pretty sure Howard would have more notes about it if he succeeded. He’d be too proud not to have that plastered everywhere.”
Truth be told, I didn’t know why I held back, either; it’s not as if Steve hasn’t already telegraphed his desire. But there was never anything overt, just the lingering look Steve would give me when our eyes met across a table, across a battlefield, across worlds, coupled with everything else.
So, Sam can always tell, and this is probably why he ambushes Steve after dinner. Steve is in the kitchen boiling a pot of tea for the rest of the team as they settle in to watch a movie.
“One hundred percent,” Tony says, settling back into the chair and sighing, cheeks pink with a pleasant buzz.
Tony snorts and pulls away. “I didn’t hear any complaints!”
“Thanks for cooking.”
“I can’t help fix you, Steve,” Tony says, and looks away again, moving his jaw away from Steve’s palm. “I can barely fix
“No she didn’t,” Tony mumbles. “I mean, I don’t know, she has his card or whatever, but it’s the
Rhodey freezes, the dinner plate in his hand hovering just above the table.
“Steve,” Tony says, sounding out of breath. “Sorry. I just—I have to go.”
Behind him, Tony lets out a startled laugh: “Was that a—”
Steve’s pretty sure this says something about him, about how he idealizes things, wants control over the story. He doesn’t dwell on these dreams enough to parse them. If nothing else, Steve wants the dreams to bolster his confidence in finally talking to Tony about what had happened between them almost a month ago, to see if there was still a chance, maybe.
“You okay?”
Tony winks at Natasha and she leans down to plant a kiss on Tony’s hair, and leaves.
“That’s what they called Barnes,” Bruce supplies. Everyone knows this already, but he seems to say it more to himself.
As the quinjet exits, Steve turns back to the plans on the table in front of them. As he does, his eyes meet Tony’s, and Tony looks away quickly. Steve bites his lip, files the moment away for scrutiny after the mission.
“I guess you’d know what that’s like, too. Anyway, all these people, everyone, they always say things, and they say it so often it’s hard not to believe them, to take on the burden of existence and to internalize the hope you’ve given them and then hold yourself to it.” Steve doesn’t look at Tony as he talks, can’t bear to.
“Oh? Too good for that?” Tony says sharply. “Too good to lie or be a fuck up like the rest of us mere mortals?”
,” he whines.
Tony wrenches his hand out from under Steve’s as he gestures wildly. “I’m not Bucky!” He says, as if exasperated by the very idea of having to spell things out. “I can’t just be your comfort person while you’re looking for the real thing. I—I don’t know everything about you, about your asthma or your temper, about when to fight and when not to, I can’t just be a comfort when you need me, I can’t—”
I leaned forward just as Steve pulled away, then he pressed a quick kiss on my forehead.
—it was more up Bucky’s alley. It really wouldn’t be believable for Steve to suddenly up and walk around with Tony, who
“Come on, Steve,” Tony says, curling his fingers towards his palm, inviting. “Since when have I taken no for an answer?”
But I didn’t do that; I never could. It would bring our faces too close, and I didn’t trust myself with that proximity.
Tony rolls his eyes in agreement at the memory of his father.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers, breath hot against Steve’s mouth. “It’s my fault that you’re feeling this way.”
Every night he dreams of that afternoon. Looking in Tony’s eyes, the crooked smile on his lips.
“Kissing,” Steve says, putting down the paper and looking up at Tony.
“You’re going through something right now. Something really difficult. I know that, and I’m here for you, okay?” Tony looks back at Steve, waiting for an acknowledgement. Steve swallows, and nods.
Steve thinks of Tony’s presence, of all the times he’d pushed Tony away, of all the times Tony had found him. It dawns on him, all at once: “I didn’t mean to keep running away.”
,” Tony whines, half-heartedly trying to get out of her grip. After a short tussle, Tony rights himself up and scoots closer to Rhodey. She looks close to pulling him back into a hug, but her phone beeps.
The moment of epiphany is often described as transcendental.
Chapter ten:
“Give it time,” she says.
“If it’s in my closet then it’s mine,” Tony sniffs, pulling down on the sleeves to hide his hands as he wraps his arms around himself. Steve chuckles softly, shakes his head. Tony sidles up to him, and they stand beside each other, arms barely touching.
“Are you for real?” Tony asks, sounding surprised.
Tony looks down at his coffee, trying and failing to hide his smile.
Steve starts to laugh, because Tony is an idiot, and he’s an idiot, and they were probably drawn together by the universe due to their shared idiocy. He tells Tony this.
“I love you,” Steve says, pressing kisses up Tony’s shoulder, then along his jaw. “Happy anniversary,” he adds, and when he sees Tony’s eyes flutter shut, he reaches up, grabs a fistful of cake, and mashes it against Tony’s face.
“I—what?” Steve says, shaking away Tony’s hand and fighting down a blush. This is stupid. He should talk to Fury.
“How was your flight?”
“HYDRA would have a lot more to gain by keeping Howard alive for him to make more of it though, right?”
“I want you to know,” Steve says, pulling away just enough to get the words out. “That I mean it when I say I love you.”
“I never want to lose you,” Steve admits, finally. He takes another steadying breath, then cups Tony’s jaw with his other hand.
Frustration explodes inside Steve, and all at once he’s so mad at himself for being so awful with words. He wants to backtrack to how they were right before this happened. He’s so focused on thinking of how to fix this that he isn’t really thinking when he pulls Tony close, wanting nothing more than to take that look off Tony’s face.
Steve paces around his room, hands on his hips. He can’t think straight, can’t think at all, really, his internal monologue sounding a lot like when he’d turned the knob on the radio too quickly and the words and the static all blurred together.
Nick rolls his eyes. “Yeah, only been in one or two before this,” he admits. “But he’s good.”
“What if HYDRA killed my parents?” Tony asks, and he’s looking at Steve, but not really.
Steve feels his body tense up: his mouth opens and shuts on its own accord, his brain trying and failing to come up with something to say.
Somewhere within the workshop something whizzes. Steve helps Tony lie down on the couch, and then Dum-E rolls over and beeps.
“Hi.”
, Steve tells himself. Steve bared his soul to Tony and Tony hadn’t run away at that, so there is still some form of their friendship that Steve could return to.
Tony laughs, full and vibrant. “Well, fuck you too!” he says, shaking his head as he climbs onto a treadmill.
Steve’s eyes remain trained on the floorboards, dark brown with swirls of black grain. Tony touches Steve’s wrist. Steve keeps his eyes fixed on the floor, trying to measure his breathing.
“And that’s supposed to make it okay?”
“Okay, fine. At least let me help—” Steve swats away Tony’s hand.
The man snorts softly and nods at Steve, considering him for a moment.
, as if it should be common knowledge by now. Steve lets out a shaky breath.
JARVIS, meanwhile, remains silent.
“Well, here’s my card. Just let me know when and I’ll be there.”
Tony’s face falls. “I’m. I don’t have to answer that.”
“I have a bunch of places there anyway, so you can stay wherever you want, JARVIS can set you up,” Tony says in a rush.
Tony sighs, loud and dramatic, like it pains him to have to talk about this, as if it’s so
, is holding his hand. He wants more, but doesn’t know where to begin.
The movie ends, and Steve lets out a long breath. “Wow, Tony,” he says.
“Oh,” Tony says. He blushes a little, and Clint briefly considers stabbing himself with his spoon. “Thanks.”
“Why do you always do that?”
"Want me to stop?"
“Probably!”
“Have it,” Steve says, standing up quickly and wincing at the sound of the chair scraping across the wood. He feels Tony’s eyes on him as he leaves the kitchen, but doesn’t turn to check.
“No I—I was just saying,” Tony sputters, following Steve into the kitchen.
“Did she really?” Natasha asks, leaning over the table. “Where are you going?”
As soon as they’re out the door, Tony reaches over and twines their fingers together. It should be absurd, the simple gesture sends a bolt of electricity up Steve’s spine, except he’s been thinking of what it would feel like to touch Tony, and now he is.
Behind him, Tony makes an annoyed sound. “What, did you draw our names out of a hat?” he asks.
The memory leaves a sour taste in Tony’s mouth. Even now, after all these years, he can’t fathom why he reacted the way he did. They’d talked about the future often enough, daydreamed about living together, about moving back to New York and starting a life.
“I’m sorry—”
Around them, the air is filled with a jangly guitar riff. Clint immediately begins singing, and Steve looks up when he hears Tony begin to hum along. Steve and Thor share confused looks as Bruce and Natasha join in, singing what Steve assumes to be the chorus.
“Hey—!!”
“We’re going to find him,” she says fiercely, grabbing Steve’s chin and forcing him to look at her. “Okay Steve?”
Well. If there’s one thing he’s grateful for, it’s that Tony didn’t mention the drawings: Tony’s hands, Tony’s mouth, Tony’s back.
Instead, Steve looks down, picks imaginary lint off his blanket, and shuts his eyes when Tony sighs loudly and leaves.
, but he’s better now, more mature. Or so he likes to tell himself.
The next shot has Steve lying on the bed, only wearing his briefs. He rolls onto his stomach and looks at the camera from under his lashes. “I’m really excited to work with him again, I’ve always found his style really… sexy.”
Tony smiles, scoots closer. “Impossibly,” he whispers, just as he rests his hand on Steve’s jaw and pulls him in for another kiss.
Steve winces as he peels the wraps off his bloody knuckles. He only notices someone else is in the room when he hears a low whistle.
“Steve?”
“I’m,” Tony says, his own fingers flexing around the coffee mug.
Steve was just happy to spend time with Tony, really.
Like a flash of lightning, his gaze locks on the man’s. He looks just as gorgeous as Steve remembers (and he has been remembering a
“I did too!” Steve exclaims, because the additional confirmation of their mutual attraction is a welcome relief.
Steve’s hand is on his lower back, steering him inside a restaurant. He thinks only of what Steve said, all those weeks ago:
Steve blinks and feels like he’s been caught.
Steve wants to punch something. Himself, mostly, just to have some semblance of control over his pain. His heart is rattling around his ribcage and so Steve decides that maybe today is the day he finally takes Sam’s advice; Today, he’s going to write about his feelings.
” Tony moans, holding a hand to his chest. “This is. This is, this is,” he says, eyes closed in pleasure. “This is
“They lay there for a few seconds, in the dark, in the future, listening to the fabulous clockwork of their hearts and lungs, and loving each other.”
“No.”
“Well we certainly didn’t
“You dip kissed me,” Tony whispers to him, sounding awed.
We were so close, and then Steve was walking back inside.
“How may I help, Captain Rogers?”
Of course, this Steve guy had to go and be great at this, which is both charming and annoying in equal measure. Tony isn’t ashamed to admit that he’d expected Steve to be a ball of nerves, expected him to fumble around, maybe elbow Tony’s solar plexus by accident, or something.
They're silent until Janet rings the bell, Steve is barely able to pay attention as the session moves on. He’s overwhelmed by how surreal this all is. He’s considering what would happen if he’d told Tony that it wasn't an act, that he meant it. The pain in his chest is heavy, but it gives him something to focus on, something that isn't Tony, leaning back on his chair and doing a great impression of someone interested in what Janet is sayng.
Tony pulls Steve close, parts his lips open, and Steve loses himself in the warmth of it, the surprising intimacy of a mouth against his; he breathes in as Tony breathes out, moving his lips, sliding his tongue along Tony’s, it’s electric, it drives Steve wild.
“Want to find something to eat?” Tony asks, and Steve hears him walking towards the door.
Under the table, Stark’s knee rests against his.
“Sorry,” Steve says, and leans down to lick the coconut milk off Tony’s shoulder.
“I love this part,” Natasha says, as the juror onscreen finishes his tirade and all the other men turn away from him.
Tony furrows his brows at Steve. “Thankfully we’ve been given half an hour just to do that,” he says, a crooked smile on his lips.
“I was thinking about how, after everything, it was worth it. I knew I had to do it. And I’d do it again.”
They sink into a comfortable silence, waiting for the doctor to arrive. Steve’s itching to go, though—to tell Tony about Bucky, because if anyone would be able to help him, Tony seems like the best option.
Then he asked me if I wanted to move to the bed, and of course I said yes. After all, I’m only human aren’t I?
Just across the street, he sees a vague outline of a man holding up a rifle. With his free hand, he waves and throws up a peace sign.
like that. I also want this,” he said, running thumb over Tony’s brow. “And this,” he added, pressing his palm to Tony’s sternum.
“Good. You have about a week before you start to feel the effects. Find me the relics or Sir Rogers before then and you can have the antidote.” He stood and clapped Tony on the shoulder. “I recommend quick work and a faster horse. When you are done, you can find me at my estate.”
Steve pressed an ear to the door but couldn’t hear any voices on the other side. He knocked lightly and heard muttered “what?” in response. Warily, Steve opened the door quietly and was relieved to find that Tony was inside, and he was alone. “Tony?”
Behind them, the stranger shoved his own captive towards the rest and said, with clear but accented French, “Sit, you thieving dog, before I have your hands.” He brandished his curved sword with a scowl and the bandit sat, crossing his arms over his chest and tucking his hands into his armpits protectively.
Tony opened his mouth a couple of times, then finally sighed. “Well, it’s not like I can argue with results,” he said finally. “But I want to see this grail for myself.”
It must not have been a very good smile, though, because Steve still looked concerned. “What’s wrong?”
Tony’s pulse spiked with a sudden rage and his hand tightened on the stem of his glass. “So that’s what really happened,” he said acidly, sitting up straighter. “Howard said no, did he? So you took him out to the woods and broke his neck?”
“We're doing fine,” Tony said absently, tapping a sheet of paper against his lips as he thought. “So it seems like Steve might be right about Barnes going to Chatellerault, then, if he was seen passing through Tours?”
“The charges of heresy that your friend mentioned are patently ridiculous.  I’ve never met a more uptight band of Christian men in my entire life; I think the vast majority of you might faint dead away if confronted with a true heresy.” Steve frowned at that but was unsure what to protest. “No, what this is likely about the millions of francs that the King owes the Templars that he doesn’t want to repay.  The King might think he’s above the law, but he should never get pretensions that he is above his debts or, for that matter, above the Church.”  Stark shuffled some of his papers together and stood, which made Steve realized that in the distance bells were starting to ring for matins.  “I have business to attend to, but when Brother Peter returns tell him that you are to be given a room until this business is straightened out.”
Steve nodded without looking up from his food, trying not to think about what Tony meant by ‘prepare.’ Bucky had often teased him for how little time he spent with women, particularly women of easy or negotiable virtue, but he’d seen them in the market and lounging in doors with their kohled eyes and rouged lips. His traitorous thoughts flashed an image of Tony looking up at someone through darkened lashes and kohl-rimmed eyes and he realized his hands were shaking. “I’m finished,” he said, pushing his trencher away. He thought about returning to their room to gather his sketchbook and pencils, but realized he was in no state to sit still and concentrate. Instead he cleaned off his knife and fork and tucked them into his belt. "I'll go...walk, I guess."
Tony started to speak and hesitated. “The people there will be loyal to the Duke of Anjou,” he said after a moment. “We will be able to find help there, and perhaps a wagon for us to transport him to my manor.” Steve thought with regret of the wagon that they’d left in Chatellerault, along with all of the belongings that they couldn’t carry with them. Their belongings were left in the care of the anonymous farmer who had let them use his farm and the wagon left as payment.
Thomas fished a folded piece of paper out of a pocket and passed it down to Steve.  Steve turned it over in his hands, recognizing Stark’s seal in the embossed wax holding the paper closed.  “The Iron Cardinal wants you to give that to the Abbot,” Thomas explained, snapping the reins and clucking to his horse.
“I hardly think he’d invite the liaison to the Grand Master if he’d invited the Grand Master himself,” Steve pointed out.
“Good work, Tony. You really came through.” He nudged Steve with his boot, grimacing with distaste. “I’ll let you dispose of this one, shall I?”
Tony took the candle while Steve knelt next to the man, shaking him gently to wake him up. The man’s head lolled, and Tony sucked in a breath at the purple bruises and dried blood there. Tony thought he’d been wearing dark rags, but as he moved closer he realized that Barnes' clothes were dark with blood and dirt, not dye, and his gaze traveled down to see that the man’s feet were dark and misshapen, clearly broken. There was no way Barnes was getting out of here under his own power.
“Oh, that wasn’t a
“Do you feel absolved?” Stark asked when Steve was dressed again. His dressing gown was wrapped around him once more, tidy and straight as if nothing had happened, while Steve felt like he’d been taken apart and put back together again as someone completely different. “Did you find the relief you were looking for?”
“Absolutely fantastic,” Tony said. “I haven’t felt this good since I was a much younger man. What did you do?”
As distractions went, bringing up the relics was always successful. “Have you heard anything?”
The strange feeling lingered well into the next day, making Steve feel more pensive than usual. Tony, if he noticed, didn’t seem to mind; he happily chatted about whatever came to mind given the landscape they were passing. Fields of grapes remind him of a new invention called a wine press that was going to revolutionize wine making; he was apparently helping vineyards invest in the machine for a portion of their future profits. When they stopped to feed and water the horse, he described a new type of well developed in Artois that would bring water up from the ground without pumping, and as they stopped by a monastery to sell them a cask of mead, he explained how an abbey on the Isle of Reichenau had built a way of heating that worked from under the floor.
“I’d like to hear it from you, if you don’t mind,” Tony said diplomatically, not missing a beat. He pulled out a sheet of paper from under the breakfast plate and handed it to Bucky. “Are these the relics you mean?”
“It’s been a trying time for you,” Stark said with a short nod, but despite Steve’s apology his originally welcoming mood had clearly cooled.  When he started to serve himself Steve hesitated and followed suit, finding an appetite for the first time in days as the tantalizing smells of wine-braised chicken and fresh bread reached his nose.  They ate in silence for a few minutes, then Stark took a sip of wine and cleared his throat.  “I believe these are yours,” Stark said, using his foot to nudge a box tucked under the table closer to Steve. Glancing down, Steve recognized the belongings that he’d been forced to leave behind as he fled the Templar keep.
, after all.”
“Need to get this out of me,” Tony grumbles, punching in his code.
Steve nods at everyone. “See you at the hangar in 10 minutes,” he says before leaving to get dressed.
“Shut up,” Steve says, equal parts angry and relieved. He tucks his arm under Tony’s shoulder and lifts him up.
Steve feels confident, brave, like nothing could go wrong tonight, and winks in response.
“What—”
“How are you doing?”
“Tony,” Steve says, and tries (and fails) to keep the need from straining his voice.
,” Steve says, crossing his arms over his chest. He can’t pinpoint why he feels so touchy about this, hates himself for not being able to meet Tony’s gaze, hates himself for wanting to, for being just a little bit curious. Steve stills, then comes back to himself.
“That’s not the point!” He pushes Steve’s hand off him and stands. “Why would you keep that a secret?”
It’s been two weeks and Steve has barely slept, kept a silent vigil with JARVIS, driven half-insane with worry.
“So, is that enough?” Tony teases. “Have I earned the right to at least see you shirtless?”
Tony snorts. “While it’s an honor that you think I can get her to do anything, we both know that woman literally has otherworldly senses,” he says. He walks into the library and takes a seat on the couch beside Steve. “Did you talk to her?”
Steve stares back, taking every available second to drink in the sight of him. His shirt fits just right, enough to highlight the muscles of his tan arms, and Steve could look at him forever.
Tony looks up at Steve. He hadn’t even realized he’d looked away. Steve takes a deep breath, closes the space between them, and takes Tony’s hands in his.
Steve is drying his hair when Tony comes back with two cups of coffee. He murmurs his thanks before taking a sip, and Tony sits down on the bed, watching Steve.
He asks JARVIS to check if anyone is already in areas Steve plans on going. Exercise, cooking, he can deal with. Other people, not so much.
“Hi,” Steve says, and wonders faintly if he’s trembling. He feels like he’s trembling.
“Well what about
“Bed,” Tony’s lips brush against his as he speaks, and it keeps sending sparks straight down to Steve’s belly.
Steve lets out a small noise of assent, his brain still catching up, how could it not stutter like that, after that sinuous movement?
Steve considers this. “But. Remember what I told you? When Natasha and I were in that bunker. Zola was saying that accidents happened. ‘When history didn’t cooperate, history was changed.’ Then he showed us newsreels of the car crash—”
Tony turns to look at the door, surprised by the sound. “Hey Cap. What do you need?” Tony’s voice is light, but his stance is tense. Clearly he hasn’t gotten over their conversation. Behind him, machines continue to assemble and construct.
Steve hides a smile by taking a sip of his coffee, but presses his leg against Tony’s, enjoying the warmth. Their fight earlier seems far away, now, and Steve doesn’t want to bring it up, content to just let those words stay in the workshop, where they can get sorted and filed away, like all other data down there.
“Yes,” Tony says, slowly. “Just give me a second.”
“Of course,” he says, and he’s surprised by how sure his tone is.
“I know,” Tony says, and this is him lying through his teeth, and this is what he’s good at, and maybe this is why he’ll never know how relationships are. It’s a trust issue, probably. He doesn’t know if the issue is with Steve, or with himself. “Don’t worry about it.”
“You—I. What? How? When? What is that?” The questions tumble out of him and Steve has to consciously loosen his grip on the table.
Natasha notices it first over dinner. Tony touches Steve almost incessantly, first to get his attention to pass the salt, then a pat on the back to say
“No that’s—I just mean—”
“Hello,” he says, smiling at them. Bruce nods in response, then goes back to reading.
“Gracias.” They smile at each other for a bit more, until the door of the man’s apartment beeps.
They stare at each other for a moment. Then Tony laughs, and Steve laughs, a mix of confusion and hysteria. Tony leans forward and buries his face against Steve’s chest, and they’re both shaking with it, Steve laughing because Tony is.
Tony presses his forehead against Steve’s. “Fuck,” he says. “I’m sorry,” he whispers, and Steve shuts his eyes. He hasn’t felt this way in a while, floaty and away from himself, but that’s how he feels just as tears begin to slide down his cheeks.
They pull away and the look Tony gives him is a mix of crazed and overwhelmed, and Tony breathes out, “Holy fuck.” Then, resting his hands on Steve’s shoulders, adds: “Who the fuck taught you how to do
When they’re done, they step outside of the bar and Tony lights a cigarette. “Where to next?” He asks.
Tony has colored considerably, and looks a little disgruntled. Pepper tries to be as subtle as possible when she elbows him, waiting for an introduction.
“Why?” Rhodey sits up and looks down at Tony. “What do you mean?”
“Me neither,” Steve says. Tony’s lips quirk up into a small smile.
A beat passed, then Steve pulled me into a full hug, fast enough to make me gasp. We were silent, and Steve pressed his face on the crook of my shoulder, so close that I could feel Steve’s eyelashes against my neck.
“Good.” He moved back on top of me, pinning me down with his hips and letting my wrists go.
“Hey,” Tony says, and Steve notices that his voice is sleep-strained and rough.
Tony’s looking away, staring outside the window, and Steve reaches out and touches his knee, trying to ground him, to bring him back. Tony turns to face Steve, exhaustion plain on his face.
“When you’re not Iron Man,” Steve finishes for him. He feels unpleasantly lightheaded. “All this time?”
“He has literally kept himself in the shadows for decades, man,” Sam says, from the kitchen. “If It were easy then I don’t think he’d be such a good assassin, you know?”
Steve stands up, shakes broken glass off his clothes, and gets to cleaning up.
“Quality assurance. Or assessment? Both.”
“I need to lie down,” Tony says, walking back inside Steve’s apartment. He was very good at acting like he owned any place he stepped into.
“Of course!” Tony chirps. “We can’t just be holding hands. This is
“I’ll pass,” Bruce says, waving his book at them. “Enjoy the pie.”
“You’re welcome.” Tony turns away to look for something on the workbench. So, it’s not just Steve buying time.
Tony reaches over to a small desk to hand Steve a glass of water.
Steve pushes a laugh out of his chest, trying to play it off, to take Tony’s out. It sounds fake, even to his own ears. He turns away from Tony, lies flat on the bed, and tries to quiet his thoughts so he can fall asleep.
Steve breathes.
Steve looks at him, then massages his temples. “I’m not going to let you leave in your socks. Come on. Have some water.”
“I hate not being able to do anything,” Steve says, simply.
“We’ll find him, ma’am,” Steve said to her, sounding a lot more confident than he felt.
“Oh, Steve.” Tony sounds tired, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I—do you remember what you told me before, about Zola and the car accident?” Tony lifts himself to sit on the workbench, kicking his feet against the metal.
“I got you coffee,” Steve says gently. He places it on the counter in front of Tony, and from where he’s seated, Clint can see that his smile has faltered, a little.
Bruce, Natasha, and Tony are speaking in hushed tones as Steve checks his gear one more time. Thor arrives last, adjusting his chestplate with one hand and yawning as he sets his hammer down on the floor.
“Well,” Tony says, noncommittal. “You know.”
Somewhere near him, Tony was reading a book and smoking. He could smell the cigarette smoke, mixed with the salt in the air.
“Hey, wait,” Tony says, jogging a little to catch up to him. He stands in front of the elevator, blocking Steve’s path. “Look. We’ll go slow, okay?”
Steve snorts. “Okay. Make another bowl of popcorn, then.”
Chapter five:
The phone pings again, this time with a link to a playlist Sam has thrown together. It starts with “Trouble Man,” and Steve smiles to himself, remembering the first time they’d met. He places his phone on the desk, and plays the rest of the music.
It takes Steve a moment to reorient himself, realize what Tony means by that. Steve bites his lip, but doesn’t say that he’s never wanted to rely on anyone, that he can get by on his own. Even that truth, however glaring it seems to Tony, is something Steve isn’t ready to say out loud.
He tilts Tony’s head up, wanting to see Tony’s face, scrunched up with sheer delight. Tony follows the movement, then he leans forward and kisses Steve again, and this—this is much better.
Inside, surrounded by foam peanuts, is the reactor. Cracked down the middle.
“I’d rather not hear what the general public thinks, thanks,” Tony says, sighing. He rests his face in his hands. It’s not like he meant to think of this—what is wrong with his brain, that the intrusive thoughts come in the form of the few moments he’d asked Steve what was on his mind, only to be brushed off?
“What in the hell—“
“Steve,” I whispered, struggling slightly against his hold. I wanted to touch him the way he was touching me.
“Well,” Tony says, stepping inside the room. “I’m choosing this side.”
begins. Tony leaves for a moment to get the pizza, and settles own on the floor in front of Steve, leaning against Steve’s shins. Natasha takes a slice and snuggles closer to Steve, sandwiched between him and Bruce.
Steve closes his eyes and hums along as he takes another swig from the flask. “Never had the time to catch it when it was on Broadway,” he says, smiling.
“Then I’m glad I found you,” he says.
“Okay,” Bruce says, and relief floods through Steve’s body. Steve lets out a huff of breath and stands to leave, a small part of him horrified that Bruce has seen him this way.
They don’t talk about work, about the little amount of sleep they’d had over the past few days, about how much they both just needed to take a breather, even if only a few hours.
Tony looks up from his phone.
“Steve!” Sam calls, voice echoing from across the warehouse.
Tony nods.
“Hi boys,” Natasha drawls, completely nonchalant as she lifts herself up to sit on the table beside Steve. Thor, meanwhile, disregards them as he digs through a cupboards, looking for food.
“QA?”
Steve opens his mouth to retort, but he feels a pain in his leg, small enough to feel like a dart, and the world goes black.
“That really happened,” Tony says before turning his head away to yawn.
They look at each other and Steve huffs out a laugh.
The president’s wife was found a few miles away. Through her tears she told him that they’d taken Iron Man—the confession like a bomb dropping into his lap, and then he was on the ground with her.
Steve pulls away, shocked by himself, and a little embarrassed.
“Yeah I just.” Tony waves his hand around, not finishing the rest of his sentence. “I think I need a coffee, or fifty.”
“Anyway—it was nice, seeing you opening up to everyone, settling in. I felt, well—I feel like I deserve some credit in that,” Tony says, raising a hand to card through Steve’s hair.
Steve looks out the window as the quinjet exits from the launch bay. Even after all this time, Steve still finds himself staring as the quinjet’s wings unfold, marvelling at Tony’s design.
“My apartment,” Tony says, lips still brushing against Steve’s as he speaks.
Steve doesn’t budge. Instead, he reaches up and holds Tony’s hand in place.
Tony slides into the booth with their drinks and says, “Please do not ask me about what happened with Pepper yesterday.”
Clint looks, then snorts. “Maybe we should put up posters.”
“In Salamanca?”
Under his hands, Steve is pliant, his eyes shine with desire when he looks up at Tony and it makes Tony feel a little wild, makes him grab onto Steve’s hips harder, makes him
Once Jan is done with him, Steve takes off his own robe. He folds it up, hangs it over his chair, and moves to stand beside Tony.
“Spar with me. No one else is home, I asked JARVIS,” Steve says, his fingers flexing on the metal of the door.
Tony turns a little, wanting to really
Rhodey slings an arm over Tony’s shoulders. “It’s not that, and you know it,” he says. “We’ve always got your back.”
Tony perks up at this. “Yeah, how
. He briefly considers asking FRIDAY to print it all out, just so he can throw the sheaf of paper in front of Steve and demand:
“There aren’t any,” he laughs a little, as he pulls Tony close.
“No, it’s fine, I really need to finish this thing,” Tony says, waving his hand around and gesturing vaguely to his laptop.
Steve cuts Tony off. “No.”
I didn’t have to think hard of where to go; there were only so many places in the mansion that afforded privacy.
Stark looks down at it, his own smirk softening before he lays his hand on top of Steve’s.
I remember thinking, we can’t be friends after this. He must have been thinking the same, because he looked at me,
“You bought a Monet,” Steve responded, unimpressed by the come-on.
Steve clenches his jaw. Tony’s right. It’s annoying when Tony’s right.
At one point their kisses get heated enough that Steve acts on what he’d dreamt up, pushes Tony against a wall and slides his hands under Tony’s shirt, making Tony gasp.
Tony huffs as he plonks down beside him. “You’re no fun.”
He’s planned this vacation for more than half a year, and he relishes the feeling of getting lost somewhere. Not that he’s ever really lost, but there’s some relief, not knowing. He buys a few postcards and stamps, and after a full afternoon of sightseeing, he sighs with contentment as he takes a seat in one of the bars that dot the interior of the plaza. A waiter comes to take his order—Steve picks out three
. Somehow he knew and that was unbearable. “Then why
As more people arrived, he did his best to maintain polite conversation, but he knew that if he hadn’t been there with Bucky he would have made his excuses a long time ago.  At least when dinner was served Steve finally had something to do that would give him a good excuse to avoid conversation. At the head of the table, Stark was talking animatedly about something, hands gesturing expressively as he explained something to his neighbor, a Marquis who had trapped Steve into a conversation about hunting dogs that had lasted an interminable fifteen minutes before Steve had been able to escape.
“Look, Steve knows about the – well, you know, but it’s…complicated.”
Steve was still steaming an hour later, cutting into his food so furiously he threatened to hit the scarred wooden table under his trencher. “I don’t know why you let Stark get on your nerves so much,” Bucky said as they ate, crammed shoulder to hip with scores of laborers on their lunch break.  “He’s hardly the only impious priest in Paris.”
Tony fled back into the inn and returned after a few minutes with eggs, toast, and a few rashers of bacon. He loaded their chest into the wagon as Steve ate, the silence between them painfully awkward. “I’ll drive,” he muttered when they were ready to go. If he didn’t have something to do with his hands right now he’d go mad. Thankfully Steve just nodded and climbed into the side seat. Unlike the previous two days, the silence between them today was agonizing; Steve was sitting next to him, stiff-backed and staring straight ahead, while Tony hunched defensively over the reins. Tony must have thought of and discarded dozens of potential conversational topics, things he wouldn’t have hesitated to bring up yesterday, but every time he saw Steve out of the corner of his eye he ended up deciding that discretion was the better form of valor.
Stane shook his head sadly, unmoved by Tony's fury. “Howard’s death was sudden and tragic. Given your history and…proclivities, I don’t think anyone would be surprised if you drank yourself to an early death.”
“Y-yes,” Steve gasped.
Stane’s smile sent a chill up Tony's spine, cutting through his anger. “Maybe.” He leaned forward and tapped his wineglass against Tony’s. "Or maybe not."
“Yes, thank God,” Tony said with a deep breath and long exhale, trying to get his heart to stop racing because it was only making his headache worse.
“Have you had any word? Of what happened to the knights that were arrested?”
Tony sighed and shook out his hand, stretching his cramping fingers from where they’d been curled around a quill for too long. His back was hurting too, from leaning over the desk, and his head ached from staring at letters and figures for days on end. But none of that was new; sometimes he wondered that he could stand up straight at all, for all the hours he spent bent over his work. The worrying part was the creeping numbness in his fingers, the way his stomach cramped and turn at the mere thought of eating, and dizziness that struck increasingly often. One of those struck him now, and he sat back in his chair and rubbed his eyes with a sigh as he waited for it to pass.
There was a breathless moment while Stark studied him, gaze dark and puzzled, and then he opened the door and stepped back to let Steve inside.  “Come in,” he said, and Steve let out a long exhale in relief.  “Tell me everything.”
Steve kept going until he was in his braes, torso bared in the slight chill of Tony’s chambers. Tony’s hands tightened on the arm of his chair against the need to touch the miles of warm skin and muscle.
Steve nodded. “Just got in, and Peter handed me this,” Steve said, returning Tony’s smile. “You got a message from your network.” Steve held up the piece of paper. “Apparently the Vicomte de Chatellerault is dead.”
He dropped the message on the desk and wished he felt happier about this; mostly he just wondered if he was going to live long enough to see Stane pay for his crimes. With a sigh he wrote a message for Stane then reached for the bell and rang for a servant. He gave the footman instructions to have the message sent immediately to the Vicomte then asked the servant to send Steve up to his study. While he waited, he levered himself to his feet and shuffled over to the mirror, grimacing at how gaunt he looked. Grateful it was night, Tony poked the fire to make the flames die down and blew out some candles so Steve wouldn’t fuss at his appearance. He got himself settled comfortably in his chair, pillows at his back, and called for Steve to come in when he knocked.
” Steve snapped, then stopped himself when he saw Bucky smothering a grin. “Funny,” he grunted, taking a sip of his wine as his eyes were drawn to Stark before he forced them away again. “So what exactly did the Grandmaster want you to accomplish at this soiree?”
“I’m sure you know what impact these relics could have on the balance of power in Europe,” Stane said, and Tony waved his hand in impatient acknowledgement. “My compatriots and I only want to keep them safe to preserve the peace.”
The man hesitated for a moment, clearly weighing the risks, before he scooted closer to be heard over the crowd. “It’s not much. A week ago I was called up to the castle to do some work, but they wouldn’t say what it was until I got there. They had emptied out one of the cellars and wanted me to put in a pair of bolts and rings in the wall, then reinforce the door with better hinges and a stronger latch.”
“You are doing very well,” he murmured, and Steve glowed under the approval, tilting his face into the touch. They stood there for a moment until Steve felt more under control, although the fabric of his smallclothes was embarrassingly wet at the tip of his cock. “But these sins are not, I think, the ones that weigh upon your thoughts.”
“Don’t get all worked up about it,” Stark said, waving a hand dismissively. “I was just wondering.” Steve gratefully fell silent, trying to smother the guilty memories of dreams he’d had about Bucky when he was younger. “And it’s not a game,” Stark added. “Or rather, it
But Bucky was already shaking his head as he pulled away. “We will attract more attention together. I’ll find you,” he said again, setting his foot into the stirrup and climbing into the saddle. “Until then, watch your back.”
“From your lips to God’s ears,” Stark said teasingly, brown eyes twinkling with such good humor that Steve huffed out a laugh as well.
“You could be my guest.” When Steve looked reluctant, Bucky took his elbow and pulled him to the side.  “In all seriousness, I would like you there. You’ve been traveling in these circles more than I, and I’ll need someone to watch my back.”
Stane blinked, clearly surprised by the question. “He didn’t say why he wanted to come here,” he said after a moment. “But when I found out he was in residence, I decided to come visit.”
“I was going to be an artist,” Steve confessed. “I was training with a monk to be an illuminator, but then…” He gestured vaguely at his body. “Over the space of a year, I went from a weedy runt to being stronger than the blacksmith.”
They watched until Hassam and his wagon were out of sight before they climbed into their own and headed towards Chatellerault. The first part of the day was spent in silence, broken only by the jangling of the horse’s harness and the clop of its hooves. Tony kept his eyes on the road the entire time, jaw set with a thin line between his brows.
“You can,” Stark said soothingly, the words were a caress against Steve’s neck. “I’ll help you. Did you touch yourself when you were having these thoughts?”
"That's just it, though. The Stark family is rich as Croesus. And unless Stark is disowned or walks away from his position, all of that money is going to the Church when his father dies."  Steve frowned, and Bucky noticed the expression as they crossed a patch of bright moonlight. "Odd, right? If he's not in the Church because of a religious calling, which from your experience he definitely isn't, then what does the Church give him that being a spoiled son of a rich nobleman does not?"
After Rodgers had went back to his room, face drawn and pale, Tony went in search of Sister Natasha, eventually finding her in a corner of the nave conspiring with Sister Virginia, their heads bent together as they whispered.
“Yes,” Steve said, and it was two lashes this time, delicious flares of sensation. He panted and shuddered on Stark’s floor, heart racing as his body seemed overwhelmed by sensation. Stark noticed and came closer, running his free hand through Steve’s hair and cupping his cheek.
Tony suppressed a sigh at his thoughts and rolled his neck on his shoulders, trying to ease the tension there. Edwin's horse shook its head with irritation, and Tony realized he'd been tightening up on the reins without noticing.
And I’m tired of being the target of your self-hatred.”
“You still carry yourself like a knight, Rodgers,” Stark said, voice gentling.  “You are known to the people of this church, to this neighborhood.  Their loyalty to me has been keeping you safe.”
“Sometimes, Rodgers, you must accept your helplessness against the cold hand of fate,” Stark said, voice short.  “Good does not always, or even often, win.”
“I just gave Stane a taste of his own medicine, so to speak,” Tony said with a shrug. “I figured if Hassam was right and Hydra was after the relics for their powers, the first thing they would want to do would be to drink from the Holy Grail. So I poisoned it.” At Steve’s look of disbelief, Tony added defensively, “If they had just stored it somewhere and not tried to use it, they’d be fine. It’s on them, really. I just gave them the rope and let them hang themselves.”
"I always thought that men measure themselves, for better or worse, against their fathers," Steve said thoughtfully. Tony risked a glance over his shoulder and saw that Steve was scratching his jaw, staring at the road behind them. "I can't help but think that my father dying in a Crusade is why I agreed to become a knight."
"I wonder what Stark's story is," Bucky mused as they made their way home from the Cardinal's dinner party, winding through the dark and quiet streets of Paris.
“Oh,” Steve said when he realized what Tony was trying to say. Suddenly the exchange of money made sense; he must have been negotiating for... He put his fork and knife down, appetite gone. “Ok, that’s fine, I’ll just…I can bunk down in the stable –"
“It’s just a lot to deal with right now,” Tony gestured at the papers on his desk. “Once I’m done, I’ll be able to sleep for a week and I’ll be back to my old self.”
a game, but with consequences far more dire than you know.”
Stane pulled a folded piece of paper out of an interior pocket of his coat and handed it over. Tony’s blood ran cold when he flipped it over and saw the seal, the wax red as blood stamped with a many-headed serpent.
“Can I help you with anything?” He asked, carefully tidying a stack of papers. “You know, I still have a good hand with the pen from when I was training to be an illuminator."
This is a mantra he’s learned to chant to himself when the bile begins to rise up his throat, when he thinks of what Bucky would have done for him, has done for him. When he thinks of how he still hasn’t found him.
Steve wakes up and keeps his eyes closed as he takes in his surroundings. Steve’s used to hospital rooms and clinics at this point, and can tell from the way the air conditioning hum is low, the beeps from the monitoring machines a different pitch (because Tony insists on tinkering with everything) that he’s most likely in the clinic in the tower.
Steve looks away from the sky and down at Tony. “How you asked me to be your boyfriend?”
. But there were times, too, when it felt too blatant that it
Tony’s mouth parts in surprise from the contact, and Steve tilts his head for better access, their lips slotting back together. Steve feels hot, his pulse jittery and zinging around his body.
“Whose side are you on, anyway!” Tony whirls around and points at Pepper as he speaks. “And you!” He turns to look at Rhodey.
Steve is jolted out of his thoughts and types in his code. “I feel the need to warn you that Sir has not slept in 36 hours,” JARVIS says, right before Steve pushes the door open.
Tony kisses him again, their bare chests touching, and pushes Steve gently back down onto the bed.
“That would’ve worked three years ago!” Tony shouts from the kitchen, the air filled with the sound of corn popping.
“Oh, why? Something urgent?”
“I love you too,” Steve whispers, his heart breaking as he says it. It shouldn’t hurt. It shouldn’t.
“Flip the question around.”
“I’m never just me. I’m never just Steve Rogers anymore. It’s always Captain America: Steve Rogers, or just Captain America. It gets—” Steve grapples with the admission, then says, “It gets tiring.”
“Well, we did it,” Tony says, laughing a little.
“You’re the one who wanted to take a nap midway.” Steve shrugs.
Steve’s happy for the relative darkness and the distance between them; that way, Stark doesn’t get to see the blush on his cheeks at the use of the pet name.
Tony frowns some more, then takes a deep breath. “I know this is going to sound crazy. But bear with me.”
Tony makes a soft, choked sound. “Huh?” Then he holds up his hand. “Wait. Really?”
“Well. I’m here, if you want to,” Tony’s scrunches up his face. “I don’t know, talk about whatever.”
“No,” he says, quietly. Natasha stands to his side, and Steve can tell she wants to examine it for herself, too.
“Don’t,” he says, threatening. He pushes the knife closer, just hard enough that Steve feels the first pinprick of pain.
Tony nods, touches a finger to Steve’s jaw, and leans up to press a kiss to his lips. Steve startles, but doesn’t move away.
“See you around, darling.”
Rhodey shifts and moves Tony to sit up so he can look at him properly. “You know, even back then he never seemed like a bad guy,” he says, trying to catch Tony’s gaze. He tilts Tony’s chin up and looks at him sternly. “But I swear to god if he hurt you—”
Steve takes a step back, and Stark sinks back on the floor, catching his breath.
“No. Don’t lie,” Tony says, and the implication, while totally true in this moment, causes rage bubble up from Steve’s stomach and turns into acid.
“Come on, wake up,” he says, running a hand through Tony’s hair just for the sheer pleasure of doing it.
Steve stops pacing to look at Tony. “What?”
(That night, lying alone in bed, thinking about Bucky and where on earth he could be, Steve realizes, it might not be. Maybe.)
Tony isn’t home when Steve arrives, so Steve feels free to gape at how the space has changed from the last time he was there. Gone is the dark wood, now replaced by steel and glass. It’s like nothing happened. That’s the nature of the world nowadays, Steve has noticed.
He thinks that maybe he’s finally ready to try (even if it’s not going anywhere, but Steve doesn’t want to dwell on that, not yet, at least).
Pepper composes herself and shakes Steve’s hand.
He thought that he’d reigned it in, that the attraction to Steve was a passing fancy in something new, as it almost always inevitably was. But a week ago, Steve had shouted his name across the soundstage and kissed his cheek and Tony felt weak—still feels weak as he remembers it, the soft press of lips against his skin and he wants nothing more than to trawl through the company directory and find Steve’s phone number, call him up, make Steve blush again.
Steve ruffles Tony’s hair, and Tony digs his face into Steve’s shoulder, giggling a little, still.
,” Tony insists, but he tucks his head closer against Steve’s shoulder.
Tony hums in response, turning his head this way and that as he surveys the room.
“Do you realize that you’ve never apologized?” Tony asks, hands fully wrapped around Steve’s mug, unashamed at the theft.
“Would you like me to clear my throat?” JARVIS sounded so damn
I wasn’t trying to be dramatic, but looking at it now it certainly sounded that way. “You,” I said, breathless and half-crazed with desire. “You.”
“I feel a little crazy,” Tony says, finding it in himself to smile up at Steve.
, for fuck’s sake.”
“Do you want to give it a shot?” Steve asks, barely able to believe that he’s said those words out loud by the time they’re out of his mouth.
“Tony, that’s, that’s terrible.” Steve can’t even begin to wrap his head around how Tony feels, what Tony’s thinking. Shame burns hot in his body; he didn’t even realize that Tony was grappling with these thoughts, and he hadn’t told Steve—“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”
“Are you okay?” It’s a stupid question. They both know this. Steve remains silent, continuing to stare at his hands. Earlier they were pink from how hard Steve had scrubbed, to get all of the blood off. Now they’re just that: his hands.
“What the hell?” he says, again, uselessly, but mostly just to have something to say out loud. Inside, fear roils in his belly: Not again, not again,
“What is it?” he asks.
The line shouldn’t affect Tony the way it does; he’s seen the script, he knows exactly what to expect. Still, as if on cue, Tony flushes.
Steve is smoking a cigarette on the balcony when the flights flicker out. He watches it happen across the block, all the lights dotting the buildings within sight going out at once. Around him, he can hear the other tenants groan in response; it’s a balmy summer night, and Steve figures he wasn’t alone in looking forward to sleeping with the AC on.
“You know my order?”
“The new suit you made,” Steve says, patting his side as if to make his point, “it fits like a glove. I have a much better range of motion.”
It’s annoying when Tony’s right.
“Thanks for dropping off my stuff, yesterday,” Steve says, and he’s buying time, he knows.
“I think you’re right,” Steve murmurs, smiling a little. He can tell everyone’s watching, so he leans close and presses a quick kiss to Tony’s lips.
“I know you haven’t slept,” Natasha says, and Steve looks up from his tablet to observe how Natasha will force Tony to get some sleep this time.
Tony curses. He’s been chasing sleep for almost an hour, now, but can’t seem to settle. He’s
Steve pauses again, notices his hands are shaking. “But I wish I didn’t have to find out after all these years that it wasn’t worth anything, after all. The wars never stopped, HYDRA never stopped, and what nearly broke me turns out to have been a farce.” Steve sighs, rubs the back of his neck. “He’s alive, somewhere, without me. He didn’t even remember me. And I can’t even find him to help him.”
And it’s not like—it’s not like anything could happen, Steve reasons. He still can’t say he’s really figured Tony out. It’s worrisome to consider what could happen if he’s found out, because against all odds, he and Tony do get along. He doesn’t want to go back to the time when they were just a step above strangers.
Tony sighs.
Steve shakes his head softly, and pulls Tony back, worried that at any moment Tony would scamper away and take his laptop with him. “You need to say no to people, Tony.”
Tony lets out a disapproving huff of breath.
Steve sits on one of the benches and reads through JARVIS’ more detailed report on his tablet.
“Tony,” he said, calling my attention as if it was on anything other than him.
Steve sighs. By all accounts, this isn’t the worst thing he’s had to do for an op. Pretending to be in a relationship isn’t exactly rocket science, but the idea of having to pretend with
Steve nods and exhales shakily.
The line goes dead, and Steve slumps against the wall, the adrenaline seeping out of him. He sighs and types out a message.
also, here are the credits for the chapter titles!
“What is happening?” Thor asks, laughing now as well.
Tony, meanwhile, snakes a hand around Steve’s waist, warm against his lower back. His hand, still on Steve’s jaw, tilts Steve’s head to part his mouth open.
Steve lies on his bed and stares at the ceiling, barely blinking as the shadows shift to light.
Steve huffs out a laugh, tips them over until they’re lying down, and makes it up to him.
There’s a knock at his door. “Steve? It’s me.”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “I can’t recall,” he says, pausing for dramatic effect. “Was that before or after your sensual sunscreen application?”
“What are we supposed to talk about?” Steve asks, smoothing down the napkin over his lap, feeling a little out of sorts.
“Was an alert sent out that I wasn’t aware of?” Steve’s voice is sharp with sarcasm, but he didn’t mean it; again, he feels far away from himself. All he can see are his hands.
Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist once more. “You’re here. I’m here. I love you.” He leans up, brushes their lips together. “Is that enough?”
“Couldn’t help it.”
Fury raises an eyebrow and stares Tony down. “I don’t recall having to explain things to you, Stark,” he says.
“Captain Rogers?” JARVIS prompts gently.
“Okay,” Steve says. “I got you,” he adds, practically carrying Tony towards the door.
Tony grunts and pushes Steve off him, muttering to himself in Spanish and half-dragging Steve the rest of the way.
“Yeah,” Steve says, coloring slightly. Clint only notices because he’s watching them closely. “I remembered you had a big meeting today and figured you’d need a pick me up.”
The bar had filled up and cleared out, but Steve and Tony had still managed to have bursts of conversation especially since Tony was bartending that night. Some customers had given them knowing looks, one regular even went on to jeer at Tony in spanish and wink at him, making Tony laugh and Steve flush all the way down his neck. He may not have known the words but the intent was clear.
Steve’s holding the tablet with both hands now, fully alert. “We’ve found Strucker.”
“What the fuck,” Steve manages. He feels half-sober, now, painfully so. It’s like he’s drunk and hungover at once, and rejected on top of everything.
“Hold this for me.”
Steve remembers his apartment, that brick he’d hide his spare key under, the way Bucky knew everything, absolutely everything. When Steve finds him, he thinks, it will play out like that: lifting a brick, finding a hidden key, unlocking everything. Bucky will have a whole life to sift through, behind those doors they’d hidden in him, and Steve will be there for all of it. They’ll start with all the files Natasha had leaked, and it’ll work out, eventually—it always did, as long as it was the two of them.
“What do you call this, then?” Steve snorts, gesturing at their plates, their half eaten breakfast.
“Steve,” Tony sounds so pained, and Steve opens his eyes to check.
“I can’t do that.”
Steve feels the inexplicable need to cry, shame and desire and sadness mixing up inside him. He looks away.
“How are you?”
“Least I could do if I almost gave him a heart attack,” and the admission spills so easily out of his mouth that they stand in stunned silence for a moment.
Sure, they’d all been working together and living together, but there was only so much anyone could do to address all the trust issues that had calcified through the years. At least, that’s what Sam had observed and told Steve; Steve was inclined to agree, but wouldn’t ever say it out loud.
“No, no, no, you do
“Tell me,” Steve says. “Please?”
Steve feels Tony’s hands on his wrists, gently pulling his hands away from his face. “Hi,” Tony says, softly. Tony’s kneeling in front of Steve, his body taking the space between Steve’s legs. It’s an intimate position, Steve notes, as he looks at Tony, his damp hair, the sharp angles of his beard. Steve looks away, ashamed by his want.
Steve takes a step back, Tony’s words landing hard like a slap to the face. “It’s not like flicking a switch,” he says, trying his best to be level-headed, afraid of what he might say if he isn’t.
They arrive in the Tower soon enough, and it’s still early in the day that Tony can still make it to meetings. Steve and Thor are eating their second breakfast in front of the TV when Tony steps out of the elevator, looking immaculate despite the frown on his face.
“Well,” he said.
“I haven’t danced since prom,” Bruce says, his smile wide and relaxed. “That was really fun.”
“Fine,” Steve says, shrugging off Tony’s hand and standing up. “I’m fine. Just a bit winded,” he adds. “Anyway. I think I’m done for the day.” He keeps his face away from Tony’s line of sight, and takes big strides towards the door.
“Coffee,” Tony mumbles, and yawns again.
. Why is everything so bright. Blurry was easy.
Tony’s unpacking the take out in the kitchen when Steve gets there. Steve wordlessly joins him, removing covers off the tupperwares full of dim sum and setting them down on the counter.
“I never planned any of those things,” Tony admits. “But dancing to The Beatles...That was one of my genius moments, I think.”
Tony reaches up, rests his hand on the base of Steve’s skull, and pulls him into a kiss.
In front of them, the new movie begins: black and white and serious.
So Steve was surprised to find that for their next date, Tony had bought tickets to a concert. Ella Fitzgerald Appreciation Night. Steve wore a suit, held Tony’s hand throughout the two hours they sat beside each other, and on the steps of the concert hall, murmured, “thanks, Tony,” and kissed him on the cheek. It was worth it just to learn how pink Tony‘s cheeks could get.
Did it matter?
Bruce nudges Clint awake as JARVIS begins updating the team with the information on a new HYDRA cell; this one is tucked deep in Spain, somewhere called Salamanca.
Steve disregards Tony’s offered hand and sits up on his own. He digs the heels of his palms into his eyes in an attempt to stymy the tears. “That was a good one, Tony,” he says, and he’s proud of himself because his voice doesn’t crack.
It doesn’t have to
“What?”
“You shouldn’t beat yourself up like this,” Steve says, after a while.
Tony looks back at Steve, frowning.
Tony rests his head in his hands and sighs.
“And then what? You haul me off to Stane?” Stark barks out a laugh. “It’d be a pity, but I’d kill you first.”
Tony shifts so he’s fully facing Steve, then puckers his lips. “Kissing time,” he says again, like that explains everything.
, he could have fucked me raw and I wouldn’t have said a word about it, but this—who had taught Steve Rogers about these signs of affection? It made my heart ache.
“What?”
Steve nods, a big enough movement that he knows registers in Tony’s periphery. Tony is quiet.
“It’s fine, though. I’m fine,” Steve says, wrapping his hand around Tony’s finger and lifting it off his chest. “I’m fine.”
“Yeah, it’s—it’s whatever.” Tony turns away.
I remember breathing out very slowly, shifting my hips to get a bit more comfortable.
“I’m glad to have you back, sir,” JARVIS says, tone something close to relief.
The part only to suck in a few breaths before diving back in, and Steve isn’t thinking of anything other than the desperate, primal need for closeness; he rests his hands on Tony’s hips then slides them down to his ass, then to just behind his thighs, lifting him up to sit on his lap and Tony makes a broken sound at being lifted, but Steve swallows it down, and this, this,
Steve laughs with him, the bundle of nerves in his gut relaxing at the knowledge that he isn’t alone in his awkwardness.
” Steve says.
Steve wakes up with a jolt, surprised at himself for having fallen asleep. The last thing he remembers is staring at his ceiling, mulling over Tony’s letter. Was it all a dream? The library, the panic attack, the knock on his door. He finds his sketchbook on the bed beside him and flips it open, carding through the pages, wincing as he catches glances of his rough sketches of Tony, until he finds Tony’s letter.
“Doing anything, after this?” Tony whispers.
“Okay,” Steve says, because sometimes the path to control means that of least resistance.
Tony thumbs a tear away, then places a kiss on its path. “Sorry,” he mumbles again, and does the same for the other cheek.
“We just don’t understand,” Rhodey says, fiddling with one of the buttons on the couch. “But you don’t need to explain if you don’t want to.”
“Okay,” Steve says. His brain has woken up fully from his stupor, but he doesn’t know what else to say. Only now does he realize he’d been following after Tony, and he notices how close they are. Tony’s eyes are red-rimmed from a lack of sleep, his hair a bit flatter on the side he’d been on, leaning against Steve’s shoulder.
Steve begins to read Tony’s letter, surprised at the neat, squared penmanship.
“Are you going to miss me?” Tony teases.
Clint, who hadn’t moved at all from where he was napping, simply settles back in, fluffs up a jacket he was using as a pillow, and drops off.
!” Tony continues, snatching his hand away from Steve’s and throwing his hands in the air. “Jesus Christ, Steve. They were just HYDRA agents.”
Tony swats Rhodey on the back of the head. “You’re welcome for lunch, asshole.”
Steve marvels for a bit more at all the technology around him, then remembers why he came. “About last night,” he starts, and Tony holds up a hand.
“No, you don’t,” Steve says, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist. “C’mere.” He leads them to the couch and sits Tony back down. He doesn’t need to say anything—Tony immediately buries his face in Steve’s shoulder and lets out another soft whimper, like he’s holding it back.
Tony looks at Steve, then looks away, then looks back at Steve.
But Steve isn’t fooled—there’s a slight pinkness to Tony’s cheeks that wasn’t there before.
“She would.”
“No,” Steve says, and he’s shocked by how immediate his response is. “No we can’t,” he amends, because they really can’t—they have about a month and a half left. It’d be suspicious if they weren’t kissing in public.
Steve laughs, and looks a bit grateful for Clint’s interference. “I got the team donuts.”
neither of them wanting to let up.
Tony has his back to Steve, the soldering iron buzzing in his hand. “Huh?” Tony asks, and turns off the tool.
