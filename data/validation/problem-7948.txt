Then they were called in more (which meant they complained more about Nick’s complete disregard for their rest). They began to bond more (by order of their Captain) and the team seemed to click. That’s when movie and game nights started. They started to lean on each other more. For a group of people with ingrained trust issues, they forgot about that really quickly. It turned out being with people who shared similar life experiences really did solidify relationships. In fact, it made them into some sort of family.
“You were never my second choice,” Steve says firmly, “it was never like that. I protected him to protect myself. I didn’t want to lose you and I never considered the fact that you would help me or that telling you the truth meant more than what I said. I never wanted to betray you like that. I left because I was repulsed by myself and my actions towards you. It didn’t mean I loved you any less.”
Tony wanted to love him. Hell, he probably already does. But the hard part was handing over his heart to Steve. His battered and bruised heart was quite literally protected by armour.
“Tony, you came.” There was something hopeful, light in his voice that made Tony’s heart flutter. It was for him. He had chosen the very place they had met and significant dates for him. He always had been sappy in that way.
He reminded himself of that as he dug through his drawers in the lab, looking for his hidden stash of alcohol that had gone untouched for years. He hadn’t needed it then.
No matter what happened next, he hoped he wouldn’t forget that. He would rather wallow in his loneliness forever, feeling only his aching pain than knowing that he caused this upon another.
His fingers finally brushed against something cold. He pulls it out and almost salivates at the sight of it. It wasn’t the taste that made him go back. It was the feeling.
Steve could have never wanted to see him like that either. Tears stained his cheeks, but they couldn’t hide the pain inflicted on him there. His lips were cut and coated with blood. His nose looked broken. His eyes bore similar red marks, which would soon become black eyes. His cheeks were clearly battered. Steve wasn’t sure where the blood ended and Tony started.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve broke apart first and Tony may or may not have whined. Steve didn’t move far, their noses were still brushing and their breaths were mingling in the air between them as they panted. Steve stroked Tony’s face with feather-light touches and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.
lyrics: the entire song really. listen. it is heartbreaking.
“Don’t get caught up on all the hate. They’ll always hate us. You just need to learn to live despite it. You just gotta learn to shake it off.”
steve as he leaves tony in siberia
Steve slowly took Tony’s hands into his and brought them to his chapped lips. A wave of electricity sparked between them. They could feel the pieces of their lives slotting back into place. The hole in their worlds was being filled again. Despite everything, it was clear that they would always be pulled together again.
(steve's clinging to the past -- bucky)
“I started to wish you took me with you, once I got over the fact that you had chosen Barnes over me. I was okay with being the second choice and sharing you as long as I got to be with you,” Tony continues. He already started so why stop now?
It was the façade that made it so difficult for Steve to get a read on Tony. It seemed no matter how much he thought he knew about Tony, there was also something new to learn. He did love that about him (and he would be lying if he said he was not willing to spend the rest of his life unlocking parts of him) but it also made it impossible for Steve to make the right move. If he came on too strong, then Tony would surely be scared away. If he didn’t come on strongly enough, then his advances would fly right over Tony’s head.
As much as he wanted Steve, and boy did he want him, Tony pushed all of that away. He rushed past Steve and only managed to squeak a
he does not actually commit suicide (in my mind), but it is pretty ambiguous so just be aware!

It was a promise on its own, slightly shielded by humour but Steve understood it.
natasha romanoff centric
Steve was one of the smartest people Tony had ever met, and he didn’t say that lightly. He was seventy years behind but was committed to learning as much as he could. Tony had spotted Steve staying up late, his head hung over a book, his eyes getting heavier. Steve was also caring. He was shredded, but he had a soft, deep heart that he seemed to wear on his sleeve when it came to the team. He forced them to bond and to go on retreats together which they inevitably enjoyed. He kept them healthy physically and mentally and pushed them to their limits, but was the first person to call it quits when he could see that their struggle was becoming too much to bear.
so it goes... by taylor swift
Yes, Tony was falling down a rabbit hole. It did not help that he had not slept in thirty-two hours.
“Leave, now.” Steve flinched when Howard’s calloused hands wrapped themselves around his wrist in a bone-crushing grip. Steve looked down, only for a second, at his hands but he saw it.
Put him in the same tower as Tony Stark and he becomes a fumbling, bumbling mess. He didn’t what it was about Tony, but he seemed to bring out the best and worst in him and it was fascinating, thrilling even. Tony was an enigma but Steve was willing to spend the rest of his life trying to figure him out.
(also this is my first long one...excited. of course i had to make it super sad and depressing. i think that's my style tbh)
Steve gently takes the mug from Tony’s hands and takes a long sip. He stares right into Tony’s eyes as he sinfully licks his lips. His smirk is barely concealed as he returns the mug and tilts his head slightly.
“It was all a plan?” Tony shouts incredulously, the pieces finally fitting into place. Steve blushed, but nodded.
sweet by pyscho by ava max
He really hadn’t drank in a while. He never usually felt this lightheaded. He never usually lost feeling in his fingers this quickly. Perhaps it was the added loss of blood (the glass had cut his legs and stomach, he just hadn’t noticed). He tries to stand up to walk over to the couch.
He looked so free. His hips were swaying in time with the music with a rhythm that Tony never believed he could have.
“How?” Tony asks.
Tony was caught completely off guard during their next encounter. Steve and Tony were supposed to go and see
“He’s still there.”
The worst part was that Tony knew he could never have him. Steve was too good for him. He wanted to maintain a friendship. So if that meant letting his crush use his mug once, so be it.
He blinked back tears and trudged out of there.
The frightening part was that he had the power to end Tony’s life and so did Tony. The shared look tells them that neither has somebody to bring them back to reality. They’ve often wondered if their reality of being separated and lost is even better than the dreams.
He was rummaging through his drawer for a pen and paper when he hears some metal creaking and then dropping. He is about to call JARVIS when he sees the source of the noise.
That is, until he went and fucked everything up.
this doesn't geographically make sense, but anyway. also no hate to manhattan and stuff, even though everybody knows that the world is a pretty materialistic and greedy place. so yes, this is a critique on materialism from your very own captain america.
“Mr Stark, sir. I apologize for showing up unannounced. Can I see Tony?”  Steve pretended not to notice the way Howard guarded the entrance. He wasn’t the largest man, but his presence was always imposing.
Tony tipped back a glass of water when he noticed Steve strolling into the kitchen, rubbing his eyes with a soft yawn. Tony blanched and his mouth instantly when dry. Standing before him was a man who looked like he had been carved out of marble. Tony could see almost every inch of his tantalising body. The little that was covered was done so in a pair of
just so you know what i had in mine
“Nat helped. I was at a loss. I just really really wanted you. All of you, by the way. I know you think you’re going to mess this up or something, but you won’t. I won’t let you. I just want you.” Steve’s voice was soft but full of promise. Honestly, now that Tony had finally gotten to taste him, he didn’t think he physically capable of stopping. He wanted to taste, feel and have everything. Steve was utterly irresistible and addictive (which was so unfair to Tony. He didn’t stand a chance!).
the moment i knew by taylor swift
They sang for him and he cut his cake. He wished for Tony to be there. It was stupid and childish. Natasha planted a big kiss on his cheek and whispered that she was sorry. She pulled away with a smile and squeezed his shoulder.
Pepper was the person who gave him the “I Am Iron Man”. It was custom made and appeared on his workstation the day after the press conference.
She swayed her hips as she strode toward him. The reaction was unsurprising. His jaw fell to the floor before his lips formed a smirk. His hands reached out to grasp her waist.
“I can still cut those aids off,” Tony says and he leaves the room quickly before Clint can see the blush on his face.
“All those years of abuse, of pain, of sitting on the cold bathroom floor in the middle of the night with a knife pressed against my wrist. All those years of your constant berating and reminders that I was not good enough and that I actually deserved what you gave me every night. And well, I believed you. I stopped hating Mom for continuing to be a bystander and even began to believe that I should appreciate the lessons you were teaching me. That’s done now. I’m done. The part of my life that you hated the most saved me and now I can eradicate you from my life. You can’t hurt me anymore. You’ve always told me I was weak and you kept trying to instill that in me, to instill your convictions. But you made me stronger. I’m stronger because of you. I’m stronger because of Steve. I’m stronger.”
Steve held Tony’s face in his hands. His fingers ghosted over his cheeks. He slowly leaned towards him, giving Tony a chance to back away. He didn’t.

mentions of sex, but i don't write it
And it took her mere seconds to kill him, she enjoyed every single moment of it. In the end, she examines her masterpiece and smiles.
“It’s okay.”
Steve got to his feet and suddenly Howard didn’t seem so tall. Steve tried to ensure that his fear didn’t emanate from him the same way Howard’s arrogance did. He motioned for Tony to move further behind him.
warning: cheating, in case that's not your thing :)
“Steve.” It felt odd to say the name Tony had avoided for two years.
Sometimes Tony even mixed up the reasons why he hated him so much.
That didn’t mean he was ready. Tony thought about him sitting there waiting patiently for him to suddenly appear. He had chosen a sentimental place and appeared dedicated. Tony almost always flies there. One time he arrived in Stuttgart but turned back at the last second when he was suddenly reminded of the feeling of the heavy, targeted shield penetrating his armour and reaching for his heart.
A gift was waiting in his room. He didn’t open it. He threw it across the room and tore the letter to pieces.
The bottle is empty. He doesn’t think as he smashes it into the metal table. He barely registers the pain as the glass cuts into his palms. His arm was still healing. His chest still hurt. His legs could barely carry his weight. A little bit of blood on his hands was nothing (especially considering how stained they were already).
Maybe that’s what possessed him to go to Steve’s floor. To interrupt his probably important drawing.
. Natasha took pictures of him (more when he blushed), so her plan better work or else the eternal humiliation and blackmail would be for nothing.
“Steve.”
The elevator finally dinged and Steve pressed further into the corner. Tony slowly made his way to the kitchen, his exhaustion evident in the slow drag of his steps. Steve took a deep breath and mussed up his hair a bit. He prayed this would work.
(See the end of the chapter for
But he kept returning.
feel like prisoners.
He slammed the mug on the table (which spilt coffee all over that DUM-E would inevitably have to clean) and grabbed at Steve. He latched onto Steve’s sweaty shirt and placed a hot, searing kiss on Steve’s lips. Steve groaned and settled his hands on Tony’s hips gently but firmly. The kiss was passionate, hot and heavy. A culmination of all the pent-up tension which had been bubbling for months. Tony could barely contain his moans as Steve licked into his mouth. His hands were travelling everywhere, he wanted to burn the outline of every inch of his body in his mind.
It was all his fault.
Howard’s footsteps were impossible to ignore. Steve’s breath lodged in his throat in trepidation and Tony’s grip tightened. Howard didn’t bother knocking. As soon as he entered, his presence seemed to fill every inch of the room. He was imposing. It was suffocating. Tony’s room was large but it was impossible to see or feel anything other than pure Howard (narcissism, cruelty, and manipulation which all seemed to be emitted from his cologne, perhaps it was natural). Steve wondered if his presence had always been this intrusive or whether the malicious glint in his eyes was the reason. Any other day Steve would be riddled with fear, but he still had Tony’s bloody hand in his.
He really didn’t mean to show up unannounced. But earlier a gallery owner had approached him about one of the paintings, thanks fo his dedicated lecturer, and Steve could barely stop himself from doing cartwheels all the way to Tony’s house. He was beyond elated. All he wanted was to share the moment with Tony.
“You’re all mine now."
Now they were all gone.
“Hey Tony,” Steve says with a soft, dazed smile. He reached up (showing off his arms which looked fantastic obviously) and grabbed the mug. The Iron Man mug.
Tony thinks as he sobs on the bedroom floor or the bathroom floor clutching a ring of metal in his trembling hands.
Before Steve could reply, Tony grabbed him by the waist (and tried to ignore the feeling of Steve’s body against his, which was still as firm and sturdy as it always had been which definitely did not remind of nights with his body flushed against Steve’s) and landed on the roof of the building. He dropped Steve quickly, suddenly feeling as though he was burning through the armour. Steve stumbled but quickly recomposed himself.

Their sleepovers made Tony realise how much he missed his best friend and how much he missed having somebody like that to talk to. There was something about the way that Rhodey just
It was three weeks after the anniversary of their violent breakup. And he was still there. Tony had seen him on the news that morning. He wouldn’t speak to any of the reporters who interrogated him about who he was and what he was doing there if he supposedly was not homeless. Apparently the one time he spoke to a police officer, he told them that he was waiting for someone, someone he lost and just really wanted back. Nobody seemed to be able to recognise the soldier behind the rugged disguise, but Tony could recognise those eyes anywhere. They were the very eyes that haunted his nights.
steve centric, but implied stevetony
It quickly became his special mug and he treasured it. Even DUM-E knew that that was the mug to bring to him whenever he wanted coffee. Rhodey and Pepper said that they regretted ever giving it to him since it stroked his ego even more and it was only a matter of time before his head no longer fit in his helmet.
“No.”
Not even Tony could deny that he was definitely sending a message.
She slammed it on the table which woke Tony up. She smirked at him before leaving. The tapping of her heels helped wake him up. He grinned as he saw it.
He burst into the room and his eyes immediately found Tony. A wave of pain washed over him as he took in the shaking ball he curled himself into in a corner of the room. His whimpers were barely audible but rang loudly in Steve’s ears—a sound he knew would haunt him for years to come. Steve spotted a few bruises on the back of his arms and saw the slight red that dotted and trailed down his face.
It was all he needed to reclaim Tony’s lips and drink in the wonderful sound that he made. It was easily his new favourite sound, and he was determined to hear it the whole night. Maybe even the rest of his life.
“God Tony, I just really fucking miss you,” Steve says and his voice breaks at the end.
Put him in a fight and he would become the embodiment of courage and confidence. He could assign duties in a battle with ease even with his constant self-doubt. It was exhausting to lead a team because he was endlessly worrying about them and making the wrong decisions which could end up with them being hurt in the end. But at the same time, he still gave his orders with conviction. It was a skill that seemed to only benefit him in the field.
When Steve stood next to him, he felt alive. He didn’t even have to touch him for the heat to spread throughout his entire body. Steve burned a fire within him that he thought had been permanently put out.
“He only just started. He’ll be mad that you interrupted him.” Tony’s voice was small with fear but hopeless. He was warning Steve to leave but had resigned himself to the fact that his suffering would only continue.
Tony was pacing. His entire body seemed to be buzzing with nervous, agitated energy. He couldn’t sit still. His hands even shook as he tried to modify his gauntlets. He was sweating and it wasn’t hot. He was losing his mind.
Yes, Tony’s armoured face was on Steve Roger’s ass…and dick.
Tony was nothing more than an armour and a wallet. He couldn’t make decisions. He couldn’t decide what was best for the team. All he did was make the people whom he cared for
After the Pepper break-up, he seemed to retreat into his shell once more. He hid in his workshop all day to try and distract himself from the pain. The team thought they would be doing him a favour by getting rid of the mug, but his explosive reaction induced a sliver of fear in them that they had never felt before.
I did a number on you
. Then the date he abandoned him in Siberia.
On top of all of that, he especially looked after Tony. Maybe it was to make up for their fight on the helicarrier, maybe he truly pitied Tony or maybe (and Tony always hated to go here, it was dangerous) he genuinely liked and cared for him. It scared the hell out of Tony. Steve would come down and regularly bring him meals and
on his way.
Tony tasted freedom, something completely foreign to him. The shackles that he had worn ever since he could remember were finally gone. He wondered what it would feel like to never feel that aching pain in his body again. What it would feel like to fall asleep and wake up in peace and security, feeling loved. A future he had forbidden himself from wanting was finally within his reach. He felt as though he was walking on air. Or perhaps walking into the sunset with his knight in shining armor?
“Come home. I promise to be better. I promise to help. I promise to never make you leave me again. Just please, please come home.” Scalding hot tears were streaming down Tony’s face now. There was a list of issues Tony planned to fix that he had created over the last two years. He wanted to show Steve that was he was worthy.
“I don’t really care Rhodey.”
Of course, there was also the whole figuring out if Tony even liked him back thing. But he tried not to think about that too much.
he thinks as he tips back another glass and drowns himself on his sorrows until his vision is hazy and he can no longer feel his limbs (or his heart, especially that).
“Steve.”
They told each other that they loved each other a month in. It was premature and Steve was astounded when Tony returned it. He never thought he could be this lucky. They were in college and all their friends told them they were too young to know the love of their lives. But they couldn’t feel his rapid heartbeats, the way his stomach did somersaults or the way his mind always seemed to be consumed by Tony. That was why he had to come to Tony immediately.
.” Tony clutched Steve’s face in his hands, forcing him to look into his deep, brown eyes.
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
“I understand why you didn’t sign. I just needed you to be safe for my own peace of mind. And then I lost you and suddenly none of that meant anything anymore” Tony says, remembering how bleak the compound had become without Steve’s radiant smile.
“Rogers.” He always spoke so sternly. A permanent frown etched onto his face. His gaze narrowed disapprovingly at Steve’s appearance—paint-stained shorts, a tattered shirt and sweat glistening on his forehead.
He knew better than to allow Steve to kiss him in that slow, soft way that he always fell for. He should not have allowed Steve to lead him to his own bedroom. But Steve was so gorgeous. He was so different when he wanted something. Tony almost believed it would be different. It wasn’t.
He had owned that mug for years (it was beginning to fade, but he would just have JARVIS mend it) and nobody else had used it (except for Clint, but that was a mistake he would never make again. Note: do not play pranks on Mr. Tony Stark involving that mug).
cause i don't want to stay in the dark
This Avengers compound was all he wanted. All he ever wanted was a family to love and accept him for all his faults. And for some time it seemed like Steve and the Avengers could provide that.
Steve couldn’t help the fantasies he had had about the night creep back into his mind. He would have been ecstatic the entire night. He would have been glued to Tony, but Tony wouldn’t have minded. They would kiss at the end of the night when Steve finally had the courage.
Rhodey was not that kind. He was an inquisitive little shit, always had been. As soon as he arrived he noticed Steve drinking from the infamous mug on the couch next to Tony. They were a friendly distance apart, but Rhodey knew his best friend well enough to notice the slight shuffling of his feet and furtive glances to the other man. Rhodey could barely contain his laughter. It was like seeing him as a giddy teenager all over again.
, Tony thinks as he pulls on one of his shirts, whose smell is starting to fade but it hurts Tony too much to even think about that, and huddles closer to the pillow as though he still had somebody beside him.
Tony’s mug.
post ca:cw steve and tony have a friends (frenemies??) with benefits relationship
Steve would leave in his rumpled clothes in the early hours of the morning. He would flinch as he put on his shirt, knowing that the scratches would leave a mark.
Steve dropped to his knees and Tony turned his face away in shame. Steve gently, hesitantly took Tony’s hands in his. He half expected Tony to pull his hands away, but he squeezed Steve’s hands. It was almost as though he was making sure that Steve really was there. The defensive wounds on his arms were clear and Steve gritted his teeth.
Steve’s eyes made a promise to Tony that he vowed to never break for as long as Tony would have him: to never hurt him or let anybody else do so. Somehow even after everything Tony had been through, he believed Steve. He wholeheartedly believed him. Believed in him. Steve pressed his forehead against Tony’s and they became the only people in the world. They were both in a position neither even wanted to see each other in but still found that comfort in each other.
tony does not feel good enough for steve, so he does not show up to the party.
He stands up and grins at Tony innocently. He is a white tank top, but he may as well be shirtless with the sweat on his shirt and glistening on his arms which only made the shirt appear tighter which Tony didn’t think he was possible. He wiped his slightly grimy face with a cloth and tucked it into his back pocket. There was still grease on his hands and arms, but he didn’t seem to care. Tony couldn’t stop caring. Seeing Steve like this was a completely new territory that he didn’t think he could handle. Steve may be the hottest mechanic he has ever seen. Tony just wanted to feel him. He wanted to know how it felt to have that hard body pressed tightly against his, taking complete control.
Although, Steve supposes she came to him. Apparently she was considering gouging her eyes out because seeing him so hopelessly pining physically tortured her. But Natasha’s plan took him out of his comfort zone, but she insisted that it would entice him (more than entice him if he was lucky).
Hiya!
But then Steve would look at him with that intense gaze of his. Then he would grin from ear to ear. It would be so easy to trust him.
Then one day he and Clint were playing Mario Kart in the living room. Tony was decimating Clint, but it was no surprise. During a break, Tony went to have a glass of water (it shocked Steve, but yes Tony actually drink normal, still water) when Steve walked in. He and Natasha had just gotten back from a mission and his exhaustion was evident in his features. He rubbed his eyes and murmured morning pleasantries and grabbed a mug from the cupboard.
(she kills someone)
He was here now.
Most often, though Tony loathed to admit it, Tony hated him because he was left behind. Didn’t he know that Steve would have followed him to the ends of the earth?
stevetony but steve centric
Howard swung again, seething with rage. He missed. Steve felt as though he lost control of his own body. An out-of-body experience. He was not even sure if he could have stopped himself if he wanted to at that moment. He was merely an observer of his own body as he struck Howard down with a strength he never knew he possessed. Howard landed on the ground with a thud, clearly shocked by Steve acting out on his threats and it not being a bluff. Steve instantly got on top of Howard, trapping him underneath him. Completely at his mercy.
He wanted to tear himself apart into small enough pieces that he could never be put together again. Was there even anything to break anymore? He wanted to burn his tongue until he couldn’t speak another word. He always messed things up that way. He spoke without thinking. His mouth would try and catch up with his brain, unintentionally moving too fast for him to consider the consequences.
It took five minutes to get him to take her to his bedroom. Less than a minute for him to strip off his clothes as per her instruction.
He got through another hour. He played beer pong (Clint won) and even danced a bit with Natasha. But eventually the aching his heart reached his head and he had to excuse himself.
“Rogers, this is family business. Leave.” Howard clenched his fists, but Steve only planted his feet firmer. Tony was his family, just as much as his mother and Bucky were. Steve would put his life on the line for his family, that would never change no matter how frightening Howard appeared.
“Delicious.”
Steve impulsively asked him out on a date after watching him gulp down three cups of coffee in as many minutes and shove a doughnut in his mouth leaving his face an icing-covered mess. It was adorable and Steve instantly wanted to know everything about him. Tony was hyper and he was rambling on about a project he was working on and Steve just asked him. Tony grinned and said yes, he was very quick to say it and it made Steve’s heart skip a few beats.
Much love and enjoy!
He wished they would all just understand. He didn’t mean to cause a fight. He didn’t mean to try and kill Bucky (okay, maybe he did in the moment, but hey! He killed his parents. Brutally. It was an honest reaction). He didn’t mean to make Steve leave the shield. He didn’t mean to tear the Avengers apart. Why wouldn’t they just see that everything he ever did was in the team’s best interest? Why couldn’t they understand that this was the way he had always been? The only way he knew how to show how much he cared was by screwing up.
Hell, he made it through his messy breakup with Pepper because of the team. They were a dysfunctional group, each with their own demons but they somehow managed to be the brightest light in his life.
Tony knew better than to answer that damned phone call. Steve was lonely. Not drunk. It just happened to be one of those days that Sharon was out of town and Steve needed entertaining.
Tony spent his entire life trying to prove that nothing could hurt him, but that left him vulnerable. It was a crack in his armour that he had persistently tried to glue back together. Steve hated that side of him (okay, hate is a strong word that he would never associate with Tony, but he’s trying to make a point). It was all false bravado and smiles. It always scared Steve how well he played that act.
“The nightmares are back. I never seem to make it out of the bunker. It gets worse because sometimes neither of us gets out and that always hurts more,” Tony says and he deliberately avoids Steve’s gaze.
unhappy/ambiguous ending (in the bad way)
how to react to everything that made Tony so comfortable around him. Rhodey never stopped laughing as he recounted the early-morning-kitchen fiasco, but Tony couldn’t sense any judgement. If there was anything, it was pure joy. Rhodey left too soon for Tony’s liking, but not without an affectionate kiss on the cheek and a not so discrete inappropriate whisper to
organs by monsters and men
When the Avengers moved into the tower, Tony made it clear that his mug was off-limits. It was respected at first since they were tentative around each other. The team was new and had won one major battle after splits within the team. They respected each other’s boundaries and it was peaceful, albeit dull and safe.
“Tony,” said a voice that was not Bucky or Sam. He heard something being set against the bench. Tony looked up and saw Steve standing by the bench, still in his white quantum time travel suit.
“Tony?” Steve sat up and the pressure on his hand left. He thought maybe Tony had woken up and squeezed his hand. However, according to the monitors Tony was still out, and it didn’t look like he had moved at all. Steve brought his hand up and flexed his fingers. Something didn’t feel normal about this, though he couldn’t figure out why. He was sure
“Five minutes. You can time me.” Tony gave a nod in response. Steve took care of his business as quickly as he could and made a detour to their bedroom. He grabbed a throw quilt from the bed and went back to the common area. When he came back Tony looked slightly more alert, absentmindedly paging through Steve’s book.
Tony puffed up with pride and said “I figured it out. Time travel.”
“Rough day?” Steve asked.
Despite their situation, Steve felt comforted by that response. Any lingering doubts Steve might have had that it was truly Tony fully dissipated at that. “Whatever you say, Tony,” he replied with a laugh. He felt something lightly hit his upper arm. Tony must have playfully smacked it. Then the tapping on his shoulder came back.
Steve huffed out a laugh, “I know, and I’m sorry. I had to make an extra stop.” Steve drew back and reached one arm to the side of the bench, bringing over something in a circular cover. Steve unzipped it partially to show Tony his shield inside. “I’m giving it to Sam.”
?” Clint whispered, “
“Ready, Cap?” Bruce called to him after Steve situated himself on the platform. Steve nodded as the helmet formed around his head. “Going quantum in 3…2...1"
This time no tapping followed. Had he made Tony upset somehow? After a minute or so of silence, the tapping came back.
. That was amazing even for him. “I thought you said that it was too dangerous, that there were too many variables.”
Steve Rogers was sitting in the middle of a couch in the common area of Avengers Tower, reading a book Sam had loaned him. An actual paperback book! While Steve did have e-books stored on his StarkPad, he always liked reading actual books. It grounded him in a way, reminding him that some things from his past were still around. It was quiet that day. Surprisingly, no one else seemed to be around, the other Avengers all seemingly scattered to parts of the Tower unknown. Until out of the corner of his eye Steve saw Tony Stark come in and make his way over to him. Tony was dressed as if he had just come from his workshop, in a black T-shirt and jeans. Tony had a tired expression on his face and just looked spent. Without saying a word, Tony grabbed the book out of Steve’s hands.
His heart speeds up, and he's not sure if it's from adrenaline or if he's still recovering from that mindblowing orgasm or something
It seemed like after their impromptu lunch, the flood gates opened. Slowly, but surely, Tony began to seek Steve out. Sometimes, Steve would enter his floor to see Tony lounging on his sofa wrapped up in his ever present Iron Man themed blanket and light up house shoes as if he lived there himself. One time, Steve had caught him trying (keyword:
After a few seconds, Steve felt a pressure on the hand that wasn’t holding Tony’s. The pressure briefly tightened as if his hand was being squeezed.
Steve raised an eyebrow. “Are we going to have to bring back the swear jar?”
“What’s that for?” Tony asked.
“I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did.” Scott was saying, as if Tony hadn’t been painfully aware of that for the past five years.
As soon as Clint left, Steve heard a voice.
“Of course,” Steve replied as Tony put his head back down. His concerns were temporarily satisfied. They were both trying to work on having more open communication, so for now, Steve decided to trust that Tony wasn’t hiding or downplaying anything.
“Well, what?” Steve replied.
“Come back to me.”
“I currently detect two life signs in this room,” the AI replied.
“You’re late,” Tony said without looking up.
Not needing to be asked twice, Tony dropped the book on the couch and sat back on Steve’s lap, resuming the same position he had before. “You’re like a heated pillow. A firm heated pillow,” he said as his hands again grabbed onto Steve’s shoulders.
Tony had to smile at that. Of course Steve wouldn’t do that to them, to him. “So then, what did happen? You freaked us all out, you know,” he said with a smirk.
He cringed. So much for his attempts to make sure Tony stayed asleep. “Sorry,” Steve said as Tony lifted his head only to stare at him with an eyebrow raised. “I was trying not to wake you up.”
“Not in the slightest,” Steve replied, “but I think it’s time we let new heroes lead for a while.”
Tony gave a small smile in gratitude and then turned his attention to the pizza, opening all the boxes. “Let’s see what you got here, I just remembered I haven’t eaten anything today.”
“You’ll find out,” Steve replied as he sat back down in the same spot. He unfolded the quilt and opened his arms. “Are we doing this?”
They sat that way together on the couch, Steve continuing to read his book one-handed while holding onto Tony with the other. Meanwhile Tony remained uncharacteristically quiet, still using his ‘koala-hold’ on Steve. It was peaceful until Steve realized something. He needed to get up, and soon. Having not spoken for some time, Steve hoped Tony hadn’t fallen asleep. Tony had since turned his head so his face was no longer implanted in Steve’s chest, but Steve couldn’t fully see Tony’s face from this angle. He cleared his throat.
“I, uh, need to use the restroom.”
"How do you mean?" Steve asked, a little confused.
Tony had been with Steve long enough to know he was in earnest. If Steve said the subject could be dropped, then it would be dropped, without resentment. He felt his love for Steve grow even more in that moment, he was so grateful for that support.
“FRIDAY, where’s Tony?”
“STEVE IT'S ME.”
“That’s right, Scott.” Tony interrupted. “I won’t even. There’s just too many variables.” Tony didn’t look at Steve, who still surprisingly hadn’t said anything. He didn’t want to risk seeing the dashed hope or disappointment in Steve’s eyes. He sighed. “Look, Steve and I were just about to have lunch. You’re welcome to stay and join us as long as you don’t talk shop.”
Still holding onto Tony, Steve had them both sit down on the bench. “You really think I would up and leave without a word to you, or anyone else?”
“CAN’T BE IRON MAN RIGHT NOW.”
“DON’T KNOW. GOT HIT. BLACKED OUT. WOKE UP SEPARATED.”
,” Steve smirked. “
After a beat, the weight at his back and the pressure around his stomach left. Steve had a moment of internal panic. Had Tony been spirited away? Was he now unable to communicate with him at all? He looked back at Tony’s body for any signs that maybe he shifted back, but everything appeared to be the same. Then he felt something, felt
“Tony?”
“Actually, you didn’t, I just guessed that you did. You did agree to tell me what was bothering you though.”
“I just need to make a portable device that we’d be able to use to safely navigate that quantum tunnel.” Tony continued as Steve kept holding him, “A sort of time travel GPS, if you will. Well, maybe.”
“NO. I MEAN, YES, IT’S WEIRD. I MEAN DR. STRANGE.”
“LAUGHING. THAT WAS THE WEIRDEST FEELING. LET’S DO IT AGAIN.”
Well. Okay. This was new, though not unpleasant. Steve brought his left arm around Tony, his right hand still holding the book.
To his credit, Clint tried to be as quiet as he could while rummaging around the kitchen for paper plates. He returned and set a small stack of plates next to the pizza boxes. “
Steve chuckled and draped the quilt around Tony before wrapping his left arm back around him. His right hand tried to find the page in the book where he left off before picking it back up. They were content for a time until once again Steve’s body decided to rebel against the situation. Steve’s stomach let out a growl and he realized he hadn’t had any dinner yet. He threw his head back against the couch in exasperation.
Any other day she may have stopped and picked up somebody. Everybody looked absolutely tantalising in their finest, but she had a mission.
Steve was asking for it. He was bloody asking for it. That’s what Tony decided anyway.
He knew better than to let him into his house. When he asked, Tony should have said no. Should have told him that Sharon deserved better.
Tony’s heart was thumping so loud that he could hardly hear the music he blasted in his helmet. He was torn between apprehension and eager anticipation. What if it wasn’t for him after all? Maybe Tony had become so self-obsessed in his grief that he imagined the entire ordeal. But what if he wanted Tony back? Tony was ashamed to admit he would succumb to his desires in seconds.
“Bobby Gallagher was stationed there,” Bucky said quietly in shock as he wiped at his eyes. “I knew him. He was always a decent guy. I knew him, and he’s probably dead, killed in a sneak attack.”
And Tony watched as Bucky stepped and counted, demonstrating the basic steps. He did it a few times before stepping back in front of Tony and saying, “Ok, hands back up the way I showed you.”
Tony moved to spread his body out over them, supporting himself on his hands and resting both of his thighs between their open legs. He could feel their bodies reacting beneath him, growing hotter and firmer. He swiveled his hips, causing his muscled upper legs to brush along their groins. Both of their breathing became faster at the teasing contact. He wouldn’t tease them for long though, they’d waited for his attention long enough.
“WHAT?!” Bucky shrieked. “You little asshole!” Steve burst into laughter until Bucky threw a couch pillow at his head. “You just wait, Rogers. I’ve got all the time in the world to plan my revenge.”
“Could we…” Bucky continued softly, “could you hold me again? Like you did earlier on the couch?”
Bucky’s head was thrown back against the pillow, eyes squeezed shut from the dual forms of stimulation that came from fucking Steve and being fucked by Tony. With every thrust he made the sexiest little sounds in his throat.
Howard had gotten up from the workbench. “What are you doing here?” He’d repeated. “I heard you were nearly killed after being hit by a truck. Then I heard you were at home recovering.”
“I think I prefer the word triad, too.” Steve said next to him. “Throuple sounds kinda odd.” And Bucky agreed with Steve on that.
The second finger pushed inside him at that request, and Steve hissed around the stretch that was almost too much and too soon while still not being enough.
Bucky hadn’t gotten that far in his new memories so that must have been the original timeline. He didn’t really care at the moment because he was in heaven. The bacon on the waffle wasn’t good. It was amazing. It was salty and sweet and soft and crunchy all at the same time. He was so happy he’d asked for this.
of Steve. The blonde pushed his hips forward again, not stopping until Bucky’s nose was pressed against him, and stayed there. Tony started to lightly grind himself against the mattress as he watched Bucky work his throat, swallowing around the head of Steve’s cock, until Steve pulled back and let him breathe.
Also, it was brought to my attention that the term '"check" or "checker" was not fully explained. Simply put, it means a dollar. I firmly believe that Steve should only use the word buck when he is talking to his gorgeous roommate. He believes that too, at least he does in my head.
That little piece of gossip had swept through the neighborhood many months ago. Tony Stark, Brooklyn’s best repairman, was courting his neighbor Ruth Byrne. She was still technically married! The scandal didn’t last long when it was observed that they always kept a respectable distance from each other in public and stayed living separately.
He watched as Byrne finished and set the pencil down on the table.
“Where are we going?” Bucky asked, probably realizing that this was going to happen no matter what was said. Or he liked the idea of Tony taking them out. Either was fine with Tony.
He looked back to Bucky, “When I heard you, it sounded like Steve was pretty dominant towards the end. Is that what you mean by not in control?”
“He’s right,” Tony added. “You are really good, and you’re lucky to do something you love. It may not be convenient right now, but it seems to work. And don’t sweat it, I’m gonna pitch in and help out while I’m here.”
When he got out of the shower, he realized that he’d forgotten to bring his clothes into the bathroom with him. Great, despite Tony’s work on the heating, the thin walls and windows still kept the apartment chilly in the winter. The walk to the bedroom was going to be fun. He wrapped his towel around his waist before leaving the warm, humid air the shower had created.
Tony knew the thing was probably old, not that he could really judge because everything around him looked old. He decided he was just going to turn it off when he had an idea. Looking through the drawers in the kitchen, he found a basic tool kit. Tony smiled as he held the screwdriver in his hand. Finally, something that felt familiar.
Bucky shook his head. “It feels like I should. I remember in London that Tony picked out the hat, and I remember picking that jacket as part of my uniform. The style was the same as Tony’s, and the blue matched the color of yours, but I don’t remember this day.”
“Hey, old man!”
“How ‘bout I drag you in this alley and end yours.”
Then there were long periods when coherent thought wasn’t possible at all. The world around him was too loud and too bright, and in a fever, he would just drift into the space between nothing and awareness.
**Steve’s POV**
The Captain, Designation: Steve, Previous Target Status: Elimination--failed objective, Authority Level: friend?, had brought him here.
Steve really didn’t look like he could handle hearing any more at the moment as looked back toward the man.
He had barely turned his head to find the source of the noise when he realized what was happening, and everything slowed down in a rush of adrenaline. A huge delivery truck had overcorrected when it swerved to miss an oncoming cab and was about to hit them. He lunged forward to push Joe to the side and out of danger when he felt the multi-ton vehicle collide with his body in a flash of pain. Everything went black after that.
It didn’t know what they wanted, and failure to respond earned punishment, but it didn’t know how. It didn’t know how to respond, and its breathing was becoming too fast. Erratic behavior meant recalibration. It had just wanted quiet, and now it would be punished. It didn’t want to be punished. It was trying so hard…
“Ha-Ha.” Tony answered drolly before he threw back the last of his alcohol, and Bucky watched his throat swallow the burning liquid down. “I have to say that uniform works for you,” Tony said as he rose from the stool and approached Bucky. Once he got close, his voice lowered as he added, “The color almost turns those stormy eyes a sea-green, especially with that hat.”
He released his hold and allowed Joe to suck in a ragged breath before he drew his hand back for a punch that broke his nose. He repeated it to the side temple and knocked the jerkoff out.
“Seriously though, Tony,” Bucky said to get the conversation back on track. “You look great, and if Louise wants to go dancing with you, I don’t see nothin’ wrong with it. Just one thing, though.”
It was so strange to suddenly remember someone you love, someone who had made you so happy, but Bucky had gone through that for two people today. At least Steve was here to help him through it, but the comfort somehow didn’t feel complete without Tony. Until this curse had given him these memories, Bucky wouldn’t have believed it possible for Tony to be so caring and supportive, but he had been.
The feel of the warm liquid against his skin was heavenly as he sank down and leaned against the blonde. Steve’s skin was smooth against his, and his strong shoulder was perfect for Bucky to rest his head against.
Tony started slow, watching Bucky move forward with each thrust to take more of Steve. The tight stretch around him felt incredible, and he soon found himself building a faster rhythm. Tony looked down to see himself disappear into Bucky before sliding out again, his hole stretched around the cock moving inside him. He tilted his hips to find the right angle and knew when he found his mark.
He’d been up all night working on a new feature for the armor when Jarvis reminded him of his meeting with Strange.
“It’s really not a problem,” Tony told him honestly as they both stood to their feet. “Hell, it may have been my fault. I was lost in my own head, too. Plus, I’m not really from around here.”
Sounding frustrated from his other side, Tony quickly said, “I love you both, and I know you’re confused and hurting right now, Sweetheart, but we need to get the hell out of here! Now!”
Bruce answered. “Steve and James are living through these memories and are directly affected by them. They were actually there. There is a lot more for them to remember than a name and a few historical dates like the rest of us.
watch the way Steve’s running shorts hung low on his hips. The material clinging to that sculpted ass, the fabric a deep contrast to the brilliant white of that tiny fucking shirt…
Steve hardly left him any time to adjust before he started a rhythm with his fingers in Tony. Occasionally scissoring them to open him even more, he was merciless as he seemingly avoided the area where Tony’s prostate was.
“The one and only,” Tony told her with his most charming smile. “Don’t tell me you’ve heard of me.”
Bucky’s eyebrows flew up.
They would talk with him, asking questions about his favorite things. Steve had asked about his favorite memories growing up and what his favorite foods had been. Bucky had asked more diverse questions. Ranging from: Had he ever flown in a plane? To: Had he ever been in love? That last question had made Tony want to smother himself with his pillow.
“You are staying in bed, Tony.” Steve argued. “Bucky is fixing you a sandwich, and you will stay here and eat it.” This had to be payback for all the times Steve had been difficult while sick and on bedrest. His ma must have been laughing at him from heaven.
“It was that bad.” Steve corrected. “He called me an old man, said I wore a spangly outfit and wasn’t of use.”
Tony squeezed his hand briefly. “Old habits I guess. It might take me some time to break them.”
Tony nodded and blew out a stream of breath slowly, trying to relax at the impending “consultation”. He saw it more as a mind fuck.
“I thought,” Tony struggled to voice the thoughts that had been in the back of his head for over two months. “I thought you didn’t let me pay rent because you didn’t want me to have a claim here. I’m a guest. This is your home.”
Steve continued. “JARVIS, when did this footage first appear?”
Steve came hard at the feeling of Tony’s teeth sinking into him. He felt himself clench around Tony’s fingers as his dick spurted onto his stomach and Tony’s other hand. He could hear his blood rushing in his ears and feel his heart hammering against his chest as his body was flooded with pleasure. Distantly, his mind reminded him that this was just the beginning.
“I want this, Tony,” he said then gasped as Tony slipped his fingers down to tease beneath the waistband of his boxers; only stopping when he felt the beginning of hair. Steve continued, “However you want me, I trust you.”
Steve nodded quickly, his breath coming out heavy.
It was a thing with Tony that he seemed to be so hard on himself when he cared about something. The smartest man Bucky had ever known was constantly second guessing himself and finding flaws that usually didn’t exist. Bucky wondered how many people were to blame for it.
Bucky sniffed. “You’re stubborn as a mule with a savior complex.”
“I cannot say for certain.” He slowly began. “If my mother were still alive, I would go and seek her counsel for she was very wise in these matters. Even Loki, despite his faults, knew the lore of ancient magics far better than I ever learned. I do, however, remember some of her lessons.”
“We don’t know that.” Steve said with a straight face. “I’m delicate.”
Bucky fully appreciated that fact because the memory of being between Steve and Tony, having them both inside him was…fucking amazing. He’d never been so overwhelmed, and he already craved to feel that again. Tony had taken such good care of him and given him exactly what he wanted, needed. Even if he’d always kinda hated that part of himself. Not the part that loved Steve, he could never hate being with Steve. Steve was his everything for most of his life.
“I’m so sorry,” he croaked around his heaving breaths. “I’m so sorry, Steve. I forgot you. How could I forget you? I
Bucky hummed. “Til the end of the line, Steve.”
He watched as Tony exhaled a smooth stream of smoke from between his lips as he brought his glass up to take another sip of what Bucky guessed was scotch. Tony liked scotch, good scotch. He didn’t drink that often, but when he did, he wanted the good stuff. The smoking was an even rarer vice that Tony had, and he never did it around Steve because of his asthma. Tony smoked when he was deeply troubled, and Bucky wanted to ask him what was wrong, but he wouldn’t. He figured that he already knew the answer anyway.
“So Sarge,” the man named Dugan said from beside Bucky, “how do you know the Captain and his…sidekick? Considering they were lookin’ for you when they freed us, I’m guessing there’s a story?”
Bucky nodded seriously. “First we gotta make sure that Stark’s not dead.”
God, Tony loved him. Pie or no pie.
Tony wanted to kiss him, but he didn’t know if Steve would be Ok with that considering where Tony’s mouth had just been. Instead, he gently ran the hand not holding his cock down Bucky’s spine and settled it on his hip. He softly said, “Breathe, sweetheart,” before he pushed past the muscled ring and was finally inside him.
Tony, seeming happier after Bucky’s kiss, turned to look at Steve. “Anything else, baby boy?”
Steve reluctantly slid off his lap and stood beside him as he rose from his seat. “What do you have planned today?’ He asked quietly, obviously not happy with the thought of Tony leaving for work. “Will it keep you out late?”
He thought back to Tony with Bucky. He’d been so loving with him, getting Bucky to talk a little about what he liked and then giving Bucky just what he needed. Steve remembered Tony prepping him and what he’d done with his tongue. That had been a surprise, both the act itself and how erotic Steve had found it.
Gabe, who was sitting beside Bucky, said, “Let me guess. You were the bearded lady?”
Then, they got off the boat, and Steve had discovered rather quickly what all that optimism had gotten him. Nothing. The soldiers that had been sent to escort them on their tour had been either indifferent or derisive to Steve when he’d tried to talk to them. He’d just wanted to thank them for guarding their group and asked if he could help in some way. They’d scoffed and told him if he really wanted to help, then he’d be wearing a
“You really gonna do this again?” Bucky asked, upset but resigned.
Tony looked at Bucky uncertainly. Bucky wondered what could make him so nervous all of a sudden. “I understand if you’d only want Steve for that part, or for him to be in charge of your care afterwards. You’ve known him longest, and as we discussed earlier, I’m not always the most gentle person. I understand if you want Steve to be in charge during or after a scene. I would be there to help him, but he would have the control.”
Feeling slightly silly at the overly formal nature of this, Steve put his right hand in Thor’s slightly larger one.
Bucky shifted uncomfortably, looking at Tony out the side of his eye. “It’s not what you think,” he finally told them. “The bloody bruises you saw…it wasn’t torture like that. They were experimenting, ya know? Injectin’ me with stuff. I don’t know what it was, but it was like acid in my veins. Kinda hard not to scream even though I tried.”
Soon they were back to playing after Bucky had refilled their glasses and Tony reshuffled and dealt the cards. Fool him once, shame on you. Never again, Barnes.
” the man cuttingly.
Each time Steve thought of it, he felt like dying. He had seen a video from one of the Hydra files they’d uncovered in S.H.I.E.L.D.’s data drop. Bucky had looked so lost, so numb until those clamps had held his arms down. His breathing had quickened into what could easily be read as fear, even when he’d obediently opened his mouth for the bite guard and rested his head back for that fucking headpiece to close around his face.
“If that’s what it takes, then get it done.” The colonel barked at Howard. “I won’t accept failure on this because someone dropped the ball by not putting in the work. You wanted this job, Stark. Don’t make me regret giving it to you.”
“Yes,” he groaned, “It’s so good. He’s doing so fucking good. So good, my sweet boy. AAhh…” he cried out as Bucky firmly began to stroke the stretch of skin beneath his balls with a finger, his mouth never stopping.
“He said he was sorry.” Their jaws dropped. “Or that he was a sorry sack of shit. One of those.”
Eyes still locked with the man below him, Tony added, “Remember this the next time you want to feel powerful at someone else’s expense. Remember that I will know and come find you. Remember that I keep my promises because next time, I will pick up right where we left off and finish this.”
Not that he’d noticed at the time because damn, he was too busy enjoying the ride. Endorphins were fun like that.
Tony could use those things himself right now. His hands left Steve’s ass as he grabbed the back of Steve’s head and pulled him in for a rough kiss. Their mouths came together harshly as he bit at Steve’s lip before pushing his tongue into the smaller man’s mouth, claiming him. Steve smelled like soap, and he tasted like the strawberry candy Tony had bought him to cheer him up. So sweet, so good.
The owner of the building Anthony Stark, Codename: Ironman, Previous Target Status: under surveillance, Hazard Level: High--avoid contact and detection, was not a quiet presence.
for over two months now in combat techniques that were not taught in basic training. He’d told Steve it would be good for his body to have scheduled exercise, and he had been right. Steve had loved the training exercises.
Ever since the serum had cleared up his asthma, Tony didn’t feel compelled to smoke away from Steve. Which was a good thing because that meant Steve actually got to see him. Tony was smoking now more than ever. He’d spent a small fortune on them before packing for this trip, and his supply seemed never ending.
If Tony hadn’t come into their lives to show Steve and Bucky what they could really have while playing their roles and keeping suspicions down, Steve might have felt the need to try and win her affections, but he couldn’t feel that now. He didn’t need a cover for the war, and it had been a long time since he’d thought about any of them having to eventually get married so they could fit into society.
“Are you crazy, Tony?” Bucky asked as he forced himself to stand unsupported. “It’s too far.”
Bucky answered this time. “You start by lettin’ us help you. Because we want to. And trust us to stay and take care of you.”
“Let’s go,” Tony said as they ran for the stairs that would take them to the ground floor of the factory.
she did like you, she may already be in some kind of relationship.”
Natasha looked at Bucky. “You’re right. It’s less sharp than the van dyke, more mysterious. With the setting and the black and white format, he looks like an old-fashioned screen actor. The men were more rugged back then. He’s dressed like you, Bucky, but his jacket looks darker, probably black instead of navy. The brim knit-cap is a good addition to hide his features, and I’m guessing those are his Starkglasses.”
At first, he’d been the one to take Steve. It had seemed to make the most sense to both of them. It had taken a while before Bucky got up the courage to ask Steve to fuck him. Steve, of course, didn’t judge him. Why would he? It’s not like Bucky judged Steve for getting fucked, but for some reason it was hard for him to ask for it.
“Come on my dick, Tony.” Steve said as his hips began to lose their rhythm, “Come on, love you so much. Let go for me,” and he wrapped a hand around Tony’s cock and…
News came in steadily from around the globe. The destruction of Europe and the threat of the Germans and Italians rang out more often. News of Japan and Washington’s growing tensions put Tony further on edge. Japan was invading China, and the U.S. retaliated against the atrocities being committed by battering them with a list of economic sanctions and trade embargoes.
“I’m so glad you’re home, Tony.” Steve told him quietly. “I don’t know what we would have done if we’d lost you.”
Tony shrugged. “I enjoy penetration. It feels fantastic if the top knows what they’re doing. Submission, on the other hand, is different. Trust is a big part of it, and I have rarely fully trusted someone, even my partners to that degree. I have submitted to a point, but it’s really that my top would need to
“I have been waiting for so long for this,” He whispers.
“If you want me so much, then what the hell are you waiting for?”
He especially knew better than to be surprised when he woke up alone. There wasn’t a note. There never was.
“We should leave,” Steve said with a newfound urgency. Tony grabbed his phone and wallet and slung an arm around Steve’s shoulders, allowing Steve to carry his weight. Every movement stung with Howard having attacked every part of him.
Tony promised.
Tony was so unsure of himself in the moment that he didn’t know what was rational and what wasn’t, which is why he quickly found himself suiting up and leaving the compound before Rhodey could say anything (knowing that Rhodey would definitely kill him when he came back).
It wouldn’t even take long for him to fly to Germany. Maybe Rhodey was right? What harm could this do that hadn’t already been done? There weren’t big enough pieces of his heart left for him to break.
Tony couldn’t help but be entranced by the way Steve moved without a care in the world. He still felt guilty for Steve, yet here Steve was. He began moving towards him and Steve grinned when he saw him.
“I couldn’t breathe anymore. I was lonely and empty. It was like everything in my life lost its colour and meaning. I somehow led myself here and it was like a breath of fresh air, albeit with some glass shards which tore at my heart as I realised I was alone here. It reminded me of you. It was where we first met and it drew me here. I just kept coming back. I thought that if you ever started to yearn for me the way I did you, you would wander here. And I would be right here waiting for you. Sorrowful, regretful and
Steve stood with Bucky’s arm around him. Tony was on the floor, his breathing still heavy and his face bloodier than Steve liked to see. It hurt more knowing that he did it.
Their lips met slowly but passionately. Yearning, loss, and regret poured into the kiss. It was everything they had missed and desired and more. Steve nipped at Tony’s bottom lip and Tony immediately gave in. Steve licked into Tony’s mouth and the world fell apart, leaving only their earth-shattering kiss.
“Sweetheart you are perfect. There is absolutely nothing for you to change. We both made mistakes and we will work on them
very very angsty tony
“Why did you do all of this?” Tony tentatively asks.
The fear that he saw in those beautiful eyes would haunt him until he died. He wanted Tony to trust him, and now he had lost everything.
A week passed and nothing happened. Steve kept using the mug and there was the occasional ogling of a shirtless chest, but Tony had managed to keep his reactions in check. Other than Clint, nobody mentioned it. Natasha would raise her eyebrows in a way that told you that she knew exactly what was going on and she was just waiting for you to tell her..
Steve had no idea what he was doing.
He had a cold shower in his future. Multiple cold showers.
That did not change how territorial Tony was with his mug.
Tony whispered a cold goodbye, void of any remorse. He joined Steve by the staircase and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek.
steve rogers centric
“Tony…” He starts, unsure of how to continue.
He tips the bottle back again, savouring the feeling as it burns his throat.
Tony walked through the empty Avengers compound, which was still unsettlingly silent with the absence of Steve and his team.
He hated himself. He had promised Tony to always be there. To love him forever. But Steve had gotten ahead of himself. He was stuck in the past. He was still holding on and that had cost him the best thing in his life.
Fuck.
post ca:cw
It was a big party. Everybody was there, except for one notable person. If it wasn’t him, Steve may not have minded as much. But Tony had promised. He had said that he wouldn’t miss Steve’s birthday for anything.
Which is why Steve had been hiding for the last two hours in only a pair of briefs.
tw: mentions of murder
“Mine too. They’re worse than ever. Sometimes…sometimes I don’t stop the shield. I just continue hitting and hitting and I become a monster. Other times, I’m the one lying on the floor, bloodied and broken. You have a malicious glint in your eye as you end my life.” Steve replies.
He punched. He punched. He punched. He began to lose count as he lost the sense of what he was doing. All he could see was red. His own hands. Howard’s face. The rage. All sounds became a faint buzzing around him as continued his merciless beating.
Tony stood there frozen in his spot as Steve poured the already brewed coffee into the mug and walked away, his loud yawn echoing in the hallway.
Everywhere he went there was crime. There was somebody to save. There was somebody he couldn’t save.
Steve only wished Tony trusted him enough to tell him the truth. Steve would have protected him. The last thing he would feel was disgust or disappointment.
“He’s busy. Another time.” His curt reply was quickly followed by an attempt to close the door. Steve stuck his hand out and pushed half of his body between the door and the frame.
Iron Man briefs.
“I’m so sorry. I should have been there. I should have asked more questions. I was so afraid of pushing too hard that I didn’t even press at all and allowed this to continue. You never deserved this. You deserved love that I should have shown you in better ways. And I am so sorry that you’ve had to see me this way. You probably think that I am a monster. I understand if you don’t trust me anymore. Just please know that I love you.” Tony was the one in pain, but Steve was the one who could feel the burn of tears.
He stood up and quickly made his way to the couple. Tony gently but firmly placed his hands on the back of the man. He could feel the sweat soaking through the plain white shirt.
He stopped above Howard. Tony never thought he would ever see his father in such a vulnerable position. He had been completely knocked off the high horse he was always perched upon. And it felt good. He lost a fight. He could only manage to keep one eye open and the rest of his body was still lying in an uncomfortable position. He spat out blood and winced afterward clutching his ribs. He still managed to sneer at Tony in an attempt to intimidate him. Steve left them alone and Tony began laughing. A full guffaw.
Steve looked gorgeous, disheveled but gorgeous. He had an unkempt beard and his hair had grown out, looking silky in the moonlight. His eyes were tired and weighed heavily on his face. There was a hint of melancholy in them, something Tony didn’t want to ponder.  His mouth was set in a thin, firm line. It was uncharacteristic of Steve to wear such a loose-fitting shirt, but it still seemed to highlight the sinewy body hidden underneath it.
It was even more surprising since they had just come from a press conference after their recent explosive battle (many buildings were demolished) against one of Loki’s many minions. Steve had been attacked the most, as the leader of the Avengers.
Steve was just a boy from Brooklyn at heart. He loved Brooklyn, but he couldn’t help but dream of the bigger city. The bustling cars and bright lights. It was where dreams were made.
. Fighting you tore me apart and it was the hardest thing I had ever done. Nothing can tear me away from you ever again. I hated every second of it. It wasn’t worth it.”
a little insecure tony, but it all works out in the end. basically tony loving steve but being damaged.
His legs really were weak. He swayed and he tried to grasp onto the table but his fingers were numb. Why were they so numb? Why was his world tailoring?
Tony was pretty sure that Steve heard, if the pink tinting his cheeks and neck were anything to go by. Tony wondered how far down that blush traveled, but he really didn’t want to dwell on that thought.
“Now, run!” Was all Tony said as he and Steve each wrapped an arm around Bucky’s middle to help him along their way. The walls were shaking, and behind them the ceiling was crashing down. The concrete below their feet and to their sides was cracking, but they never slowed. Finally, he could see a door hanging open up ahead, and Steve could see outside just beyond it. They were so close. Steve and Tony put on a burst of speed and practically dragged Bucky with them the rest of the way until cool air hit their faces. Just as they’d reached freedom, the walls of the factory behind them began to crumble.
Steve had finally confessed to everything that had been said on the helicarrier. He’d said he was so ashamed that once he’d compared Tony to Bucky. That he’d told the man he wouldn’t lay down on the wire or make the sacrifice play. That he’d known men with nothing of Tony’s that were worth ten of the man, and he’d been thinking of Bucky when he’d said it.
Bucky’s breathy laugh was half nerves, half relief. “God, Tony, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him calm down that quickly.” Rubbing his face he continued, “I never knew to do any of those things.” He pulled back a little from Steve. “You alright, punk? You scared the shit outta me.”
Steve thought of his own mom. He knew she had loved him, but the rest of the world went out of its way to show that they did not feel the same for Steve. Maybe he should see if he liked being taken care of too. Someday. Maybe.
Feeling satisfied that they were ready and knowing he was beyond the point of endurance to get his dick into someone, Tony removed his fingers from Steve. The younger man groaned at the loss as Tony watched his empty hole clench.
“Well, they need to have their eyes checked,” Tony chuckled, slightly giddy from hearing Steve curse so casually. Steve looked him, seeming grateful at the compliment, the confidence that he could take care of himself.
“I can’t listen to this anymore.” Jacobson sighed. “We’ll just tape the script to your shield after the prop designer finishes it. You can read, can’t you?”
“You can yell at me, Buck.” Steve said as he hugged Bucky against him once more. It meant a lot that Bucky cared enough to raise his voice and confront Steve. “If you’re talking sense into me, you have to yell. I’ve been told that I’m pretty thick headed.”
Bucky was still moaning into his arms from Steve’s actions prepping him. “Please, please, I’m ready. Please,” he begged as Tony watched Steve’s arm move as it opened him.
There was a knock on his hotel room door, and since Steve was the only one who would visit him, Tony just called out, “Come in!”
Steve huffed. “Plus a few more probably.”
Pepper had once told him that he also craved approval or whatever, but he tried not to look at that too closely. It wasn’t healthy for someone like him to want that from others.
Bucky shifted on his feet. “Tony, how long have you up? This must have taken hours.” Steve’s wide eyes were scanning over everything as he silently agreed with him.
After he a few panting breaths, Steve slowly managed to prop himself up on his elbows and knees, ready to keep up with whatever Tony did next.
Natasha’s reaction had been the least noticeable as her brow furrowed in what looked like deep concentration. Bruce’s eyes and skin had actually flashed green, but thankfully for all of them, he’d quickly regained control as his breathing slowed.
“No,” the voice sounded cautious, “it’s Bucky.”
Tony’s eyes were filled with understanding. “It still doesn’t mean you can’t like or want other things too, or that liking penetration makes you a submissive. People like what they like.”
Tony nodded. “That's the one. He came and found me yesterday, told me he was having problems and wanted to know if I could fix it.” He shrugged. “I love a challenge.”
Steve’s eyes softened as he looked at him. “We are enjoying ourselves, Tony.”
Tony had heard this speech before when he’d studied history. It was cleverly written to appeal not to the idealism of building a better world through war, which had been heavily opposed by most Americans throughout the 1930s who simply wanted to stay out of foreign affairs, but to appeal to the patriotism of the people. It was
Steve jolted in surprise before his brain caught up to what was happening. He made a sound in the back of his throat then wrapped his arms around Tony’s shoulders and pulled him closer, returning the kiss. Tony gently pressed kisses along his lips, giving tiny licks until he coaxed Steve to open his mouth and slid his tongue in.
Steve opened his mouth, but James cut him off. “I know it’s not the art you want to be doin’, but this is the market they have right now. You know I’ve never minded comin’ up with the rest for rent.”
He should appreciate what he had. Two friends, who were as kind and loyal as they were, was more than he deserved. The happiness he felt around them was something he should never take for granted. This was what he kept reminding himself as he finally drifted to sleep.
Bucky looked like he wanted to scream, but Steve continued. “I understand if you don’t wanna stay here anymore. You’re doin’ pretty well for yourself. You don’t need this kind of attention. If Joe’s spouting that off to me, he’s probably saying similar stuff around the neighborhood.”
“Do you know what they want us for? I mean the candidates.” He thought he was just being given the chance to be a soldier. Tony made it sound like so much more. “You said he was selective.”
He didn’t want to blame Tony, not really. Steve knew it wasn’t his fault, and after what Thor had told them, he was really worried for his friend. Well, after this last hour’s-worth of memories, he supposed Tony was more than just his friend. Hadn’t that been something else when he remembered Tony pulling him into a kiss before taking Bucky and him to their bedroom.
Steve looked out the window and whistled, “That’s a long way down.” When he saw Bucky grip his belt tighter, Steve winced and said, “Sorry, Buck.”
Tony kept his mouth closed tight as he carefully thought over his answer. This was important, and he couldn’t afford to say something stupid like “Who do you want me to be?” He thought about what he really wanted to get from this and what the best answer was for him to get it. Decision finally made, he spoke, “You know who I am. I’m intelligent and a hard worker who’s good at building things and likes to invent in my spare time. You know I hate this war, and I want to help.”
. When I felt too dumb for school, he’d help. He never judged me, and he always found a way to explain it so I would understand. When I felt powerless because of the shit at home, he’d always make me feel strong, like I could do anything. When my old man would tell me I was worthless so many times I’d believe him, Stevie just…He’d act like I was the greatest person in the world. He’d look up to me. The best guy I knew looked up to
. They were going to Europe. He thought of Bucky. They hadn’t received more than two letters since he’d been gone, and they had no way of knowing if Bucky was receiving the letters they’d written him. It was unsettling. Was Bucky alright? Was he still free and fighting, or now that the time was so near, had he been captured already?
“We’ve got you, love.” The blonde panted as he looked into his eyes. “We’ve got you.”
“I can’t say that you’re broken, Tony,” he murmured, “but if I’ve learned anything from you, it’s that there is nothing broken that can’t be fixed.”
Not that they had spent much time speaking to each other since then. Tony wasn’t hurtful about it, but he really didn’t have it in him to keep up the pretense while he was trying to get his head back on straight. He’d never spent so much time pretending to sleep in his life. It hurt to be around them, and at the same time he was so desperate for them that he couldn’t turn them away when they caught him awake.
He began to move forward, but stopped when he realized they were now looking at his chest. His healing cut wasn’t bothering him so he didn’t think it had started to bleed again. It felt fine. He looked down to his shirt. Nope.
They shared one of those looks of theirs, a silent conversation happening in a matter of moments, before turning to the presents under the tree. Tony tried to act calm when he was really nervous and uncomfortable on the inside. He hoped this was OK. He’d been prone to overdoing things in the past. (re. ridiculously huge stuffed rabbit, sorry Pepper) In the end his fears proved unnecessary.
Bucky and Dugan just nodded. Bucky felt years older than when they’d arrived here, but that was to be expected. The days were tedious, filled with back breaking labor that left them all too tired to stand when they returned to their cells. They were fed a bowl of some kind of slop in the morning, then again during the day. The nights were just filled with hunger and exhaustion.
“Thanks, JARVIS,” Bucky said with a small smile, looking touched at the A.I.’s words. “You’re the best.”
He pulled back to look in Bucky’s artic eyes. They were both breathing a little heavily now. He curled his fingers into the waist of Bucky’s boxers and pulled them down as he sank to his knees, prompting Bucky to step out of them and his pants.
Bucky stood there trembling and tear stained, and Steve didn’t know what to do. Should he try to touch him, hold him? Bucky didn’t like that, not normally, but nothing about this was normal, and he just wanted to comfort his friend.
“Something like that.” He sighed, finally lowering his hands to look at them again.  “I can’t believe I did that. I thought I had it under control.”
“If you knew that my information was fraudulent, then why did you accept me in the project?” Tony had to ask.
“What did he say?” Steve asked like he didn’t want to hear it.
Bucky nodded and closed his eyes. “Those scars, Jesus, he said there was scars, but I didn’t imagine it was that bad. How did he survive that?”
“Are you serious?” Steve seemed upset. “We’re not gonna let you go to one of those places!” He looked at James who nodded once. “You’re welcome to stay with us. If you don’t mind the couch, that is.”
Once their glasses were full, they raised them in a toast. “To my loves, I promise to do anything to keep you and to keep deserving you,” Tony said in what had become his traditional toast. The two boys repeated the sentiment.
, “ was all he could answer because it was the truth.
Steve nodded. Tony had done so much for them, and last night he could have died because he’d wanted to make Steve’s life a little easier. Because Tony knew he could fight four men and win. Steve would fight for Tony, even if it was only to fight his own feelings.
Bucky’s breathing was getting heavier, finally breaking into a gasp when Tony bit down on the fleshly lobe and gently tugged. He then started unbuttoning the pants, moving his mouth down to Bucky’s neck as his hands began to push the trousers from his hips to his thighs.
Tony laughed, not knowing how to handle the slight awe in Steve’s voice. “Oh, there’s plenty I can’t do. Like stay quiet for any period of time or find healthy coping mechanisms or remember birthdays. I can’t cook worth a damn. Seriously, it once took me two hours to make an omelet. And what you do? The sketching and art stuff? I’d never be half that good even after years of study.”
“It’s not quite ready, but if you boys want to set the table in the meantime while I finish.” He called out.
“My mother’s parents were Italian. She spoke the language and wanted her son to as well.” He shrugged. “I enjoy speaking it around the neighborhood when I can.”
“I still wish I could of gotten you something.” Steve said, guiltily.
Tony shrugged. “I’ll just end the war.” He had privatized world peace once already, he could do it again if Steve wanted. History be damned. “If it gets me more time with you, I’ll start on it in the morning.”
He knew now that he could never let himself love or care for anybody ever again. He should never put anybody through the pain of loving him. Nobody could handle it. It wasn’t there fault. Tony Stark was unloveable. High mantainence.
All reason vanished. Steve used his superior weight and pushed past Howard. He couldn’t even stop to enjoy the older man’s stumble and landing with a loud thud. He could barely manage a coherent thought. Tony’s room was a place he could never forget, even though this place was a labyrinth.
awake my soul by mumford and sons
Steve tried his best not shudder. As scared as he was (he had zero fighting experience. Could he even throw a punch?), his rage was stronger. Knowing what Howard had done to Tony filled him with a burning hatred.
They were closer now. The last time they were this close, they were clawing at each other. Each word they said bridged the gap between them. Communication had never been their strength, but it was clearly becoming their saving grace. Tony disengaged the armour and stepped out of it. He played with his fingers and dug at his nails, a clear sign of nervousness. Steve understood the vulnerability of it. He was essentially defenseless and he was putting his life in Steve’s hands again. It was an olive branch if there ever was one.
He never stayed longer than a few days. Tony imagined his rogue duties pulled him back. (Or perhaps he missed Barnes?) Every time it happened, Tony convinced himself it was the last time. He would not return. He would grow tired of it; tired of him. He would realise that Tony was a lost cause and that he made the right decision when he left. Tony was too much to handle and it was simply not worth all of the effort. Why would he give up so much for damaged goods?
Tony did care. He cared far too much and that was the crux of the problem. Steve had abandoned him two years ago taking Tony’s broken and battered heart, leaving Tony cold and empty to die in his scratched and scattered armour. It was not his fault. He had the right to hate him, and he truly did.
Steve plastered a smile on his face and forced himself to enjoy it. His friends were there. They were showering him with hugs and love that he was grateful for.
Tony couldn’t resist. He saw Steve and was reminded of every other time they had been in either of their beds, tangled up and sweaty. Steve hurt him. But Tony let him run his hands all over his body and he reveled in the burn he felt.
“It’s been three weeks. It’s even longer than usual, Tones.”
Everything became dark. His eyes started to flutter closed and there was only one, single light source that he registered before he let everything take over.

He missed their lively personalities. He missed the family.
together and Tony wanted to see if he would be willing to grab lunch before, but Natasha said that Steve had gone out. Tony decided to go down to the workshop and work on the new suit he was working on for Steve (the one he had now really was an atrocity. Somebody with his body needed something worthy of it). He made himself a cup of coffee in the mug he hardly ever got to use these days and started thinking of safety features for the suit.
But Manhattan was nothing like he imagined. It was worse. The people were evil. He went into a war to save society, but they had somehow managed to ruin themselves while he was in the ice.
The eyes that seemed to go from besotted to condescending in seconds that Tony was sure he would have missed it if he blinked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hearing Tony plead and degrade himself like that broke Steve’s heart. He pressed another kiss to the calloused hands he still held and stared straight at Tony.
This was the third time Steve had broken into the compound undetected since the Avengers’ fallout. This was the third time he headed straight for Tony’s room. This was the third time Tony let him in without question and allowed Steve to press him against the wall and take him right there.
“Shut up Barton.” Tony grunted, finally snapping out of his trance.
Sometimes Tony hated him because he chose Bucky. Tony always feared Bucky, even before they knew that he was back. Tony knew how special their relationship was and Tony hated him for allowing Tony to fall in love in such a manner he knew he would reciprocate. Tony knew he was the second choice, and he was horrified that it was now a proven fact.
warning: cheating (steve cheats on somebody with tony)
He hit the floor with a loud thud. Nobody was there to hear it. He scratched his face as pushed his hair out of his face. His tongue was motionless, he couldn’t cry out for him.
.” Steve sounded so sincere that Tony was glad he had the armour to support the weight of his body.
“He will never touch you again,” Steve promised firmly with such conviction in his voice that Tony’s eyes found his for a mere second before he averted his gaze back to the floor.
“I know he’s here.” It wasn’t supposed to be intimidating. Steve wasn’t intimidating. He was muscular and tall, but Tony always went on about what a softie he was. Howard’s glare somehow managed to intensify but Steve’s grip on the door only strengthened, despite the chills running down his spine.
“Holy shit! You let him use your mug!” Clint exclaimed, jumping off from the floor. IN a quick movement he was perched on the counter staring gleefully at Tony.
“Shut up? You blocked the WIFI on everything that I owned for a week. I couldn’t even use the internet on the TV. The only thing I had were my aids, but cutting those off would be fucking criminal. Now, you let Steve use it without even a warning. Oh, honey, you are soft for him!” Clint spun around on the counter (knocking a few fruits, the bastard).
Steve fucking Rogers.
Howard chuckled, hollow and cruel before he swung. Steve was thrown off by the chuckle and Howard’s fist landed hard against his cheek. Steve stumbled backward, groaning as he felt the throbbing pain in his face. Tony cried out in protest and began to struggle and pull himself up to his feet. Steve placed a hand on the wall to regain his balance and saw Tony clutching his stomach in pain as he tried to stand up. The tug at his heart that he felt reminding him of why he was doing this.
“Certainly.”
Steve felt a warmth come to his cheeks and knew he was blushing. He hadn't actually meant for Tony to hear any of that. “I can’t help it, it’s still how I feel.”
“Tony, what is it? What’s wrong?” Steve asked after a minute, as he pulled back slightly to look at Tony and his tear-streaked face.
“Um, Tony?”
“STRANGE.”
Steve Rogers sat in a chair in Tony Stark’s lab, while the billionaire lay unconscious on the table. Wires ran from Tony’s arc reactor and were hooked up to various machines. Tony had taken a hard hit during their last battle and had gotten knocked out. The last time this happened, getting Tony hooked up essentially shocked him back to consciousness, but that wasn’t the case this time.
Tony sat down and looked over the water and felt the tears starting to flow. He wasn’t mad. He couldn’t blame Steve for wanting to go back home. At least, Tony assumed that was what Steve did, as he couldn’t bring himself to even consider the other possibilities. Images of seeing a space on the platform where Natasha had stood haunted his mind. Steve had once told him that he felt at home in this time, but that was when being able to go back to his past was nothing more than a hypothetical situation. Much as he might want to, Tony couldn’t be angry at Steve. If Steve was happier there, then Tony would try to be happy for him, eventually. He wished Steve had at least mentioned this possibility to him before he left, though.
Tony knew Steve couldn’t promise that, but he needed to hear the reassurance, just the same. He wished he could go with Steve to help him return the stones. There were several reasons why that prospect had been shot down, not the least of which was that Tony was still recovering from having used the stones himself. He had his new metal arm, dubbed by Peter as his ‘Iron Arm’, but was still working out the kinks with it. Not to mention, he was also feeling lingering effects from the power he’d wielded. So instead, he was with Bruce behind the console.
“Talk to me. Are you laughing or crying?” More tapping came, this time on the back of his neck.
, grab his upper arms and squeeze. Then he felt a tapping on his shoulder. It was quicker than before, as if in excitement.
Tony gave a deep sigh. “You have no idea how comfortable I am right now.”
Steve’s mind reeled with possibilities. A rough day for Tony could mean any number of things. A frustrating day at the office, tech upgrades not working, or someone from the government or SHIELD breathing down his neck. Or it could just be Tony being dramatic.
Clint shook himself out of his stunned position and set the pizza boxes down on the coffee table in front of Steve.
Tony looked to see if Steve appeared disappointed in Tony, but if he was, he was hiding it well. “I was expecting more of an argument here.”
,” Clint said, continuing the low volume discussion, “
With that, Steve withdrew his hand and stood up in surprise, taking a few steps back from the table. “JARVIS, scan for life signs.”
Steve drew Tony onto his lap. “I think we’ve both earned ourselves a little rest, don’t you think?”
Ok, so now what? He had a few options, all of which had the potential to wake Tony up. Seeing as how the man rarely got enough sleep as it was, Steve wanted to avoid that. He could suck it up and continue exactly as they were, risking having Tony wake up due to his increasingly growling stomach. He knew he could easily carry Tony to the communal kitchen, but the movement could wake him, plus it would be hard trying to get food with Tony in his arms. He could try to gently coax Tony off his lap and onto the couch, but that didn’t seem feasible either. The path of least resistance seemed to be to get JARVIS to get someone to bring food to him.
had squeezed his hand. He brought it back down and the pressure returned, followed by a tapping on the back of his hand. Steve fought the instinct to draw his hand back. After about a minute, he noticed there was a pattern to it, almost like- Morse code! Something was trying to communicate with him. He concentrated on the pattern.
“Of course!” Steve grinned, looking at where he hoped Tony's face was. “If anyone knows a way out of this, it would be him. And may I say, that’s awfully big of you turning to the local wizard for help.”
“Mr. Barton does not appear to be occupied,” the AI replied.
Steve was at a loss for words. “Tony, I- this is incredible!” He drew Tony in for a hug and kissed him. “I’m so proud of you.”
Tony rolled his eyes at him. “You want to see what I’ve been working on or not?”
“Relax, I’ll give it back in a second.” With that, Tony sat down on Steve’s lap, facing him, with his legs straddling Steve’s hips. True to his word, Tony put the book back in Steve’s right hand, still open at the page Steve was reading. Usually a position like this meant Tony was looking to start a make-out session, maybe more, but this time he buried his face in Steve’s chest. It was not quite a conventional hug, as his hands were latched onto Steve’s shoulders like a koala.
“Tony,” Steve said uncertainly. His face was still worried. “I don’t know about this. You were really injured, and they helped you. It’s too soon for everything to come off.”
But as Bucky thought of Tony, other more hidden desires threatened to surface. When he thought of how protective Tony was or how he took care of them. How he could be so commanding at times. When he called them boys…
Steve’s face closed up. “I don’t really have many, and the one’s I get are friends of the gals Bucky’s going with. They usually don’t end the evening with me.”
“Who’s just Tony?”  Tony asked as he walked up to them.
“You insist on buying most of the food,” Bucky continued. “You say it’s only fair because you don’t cook, but that’s not true anymore. You help Steve cook almost every night and then help with the cleanup. It’s why we won’t take your money for the rent. You do enough.”
“Thank you,” he said gratefully as Tony handed him the small stack of papers. “I apologize for not paying better attention. I was simply lost in thought as I added a note to…Well, one of these papers, here.”
Bucky moaned as he felt the hand around him squeeze tighter, and his eyes rolled back as he choked. “Ah, yes!”
Steve looked back at the much happier soldiers and was filled with pride for his partner. Even when Tony was struggling with his own worries, he still managed to remember the people around him.
Steve smiled, love shining in his eyes. “I think I’ll just take one for now. You have responsibilities, and there’s a war going on.”
The Brit just raised his eyebrow at the nickname but made no comment.
That’s where Bucky’s confidence in Tony’s ability to watch over Steve wavered. Tony didn’t seem as concerned with Steve trying to enlist as Bucky felt he should be. Maybe he just didn’t realize that Steve truly wouldn’t give up until he got what he wanted, a chance to do what he viewed as fair and right. Steve saw it as his duty to serve, so he was going to serve, end of story. Someday, Steve would find someone willing to look the other way, and he’d be one step closer to being a soldier.
“Are you kidding?” Tony asked. “I have to give you something? Being in my presence isn’t enough? This is extortion Steve, and I’m both very impressed and disappointed that you’re capable of that.”
“Oh, he did. He called me a lab experiment and said everything special about me came from a bottle.” Steve sighed. “If the helicarrier hadn’t started exploding, I’m pretty sure we would’ve started fighting in the next few moments. It took me a long time to get past those words. It didn’t really happen until I took the blame for what I’d said to him, too. We were both wrong and were both hurt because of it.”
And how the man could go from choking Bucky with his dick while talking dirty to this shy, sweet boy was just one of Steve’s charms. Tony smiled and kissed his cheek again then turned to Bucky, who’s breathing had settled and had turned over to his side to look at them.
