He’s damaged, the second voice keeps telling him, softly softly. Tony you know that, you know he’s always been so lost. You always protected him. Look how young he is, Tony, he was so scared, and he got Bucky back, the one thing he wanted more in the whole world. You could have supported him, you could have just supported him through that, Tony, compromise could come later. You were supposed to be strong for him, you were always supposed to be strong for –
Thunder. Lightning. The congregation gasps, and the acrid smell of ozone fills the air. Thor is walking down the aisle between the chairs, he’s wearing a dark suit, his hair is tied back on his head in a bun. Steve wants to laugh, almost hysterically, because it’s so inappropriate that he looks like an Armani model, and Ross’s eyes are bulging from his head like he wants to swing around and get Thor to sign the Accords right there and then.
Tony waves his hand. Let’s it drop, limp, against his knee. “I could have done better,” he admits. Steve shakes his head. He couldn’t have done better. There was nothing he could have done. And even here, about to die, he thought –
“I’m interested,” Steve says, shuffling closer. “You know everything from my history. I feel like – I know so much of yours, on paper, but I don’t understand it. Not really.”
(It makes Steve’s heart clench. He remembers other sheets, softer sheets, and a king sized bed, and Tony’s sardonic smile, the smell of smoke and whiskey and Tony talking in that low way he has, resting on his side while the sunlight pushed it’s way over his healthy, strong form -- )
He breathes in, deeply. His mouth is covered. He inhales. It smells like lipstick, and vanilla perfume. Sweat and aftershave. He breathes, and breathes, and giggles. They take their hand away from his mouth, then.
He gathers up the come and saliva, draws a figure of eight on Tony’s throat. “You’re going to stink of me,” he says, sounding far too pleased. “They’re all going to know. Let them, next time. Let them try talk about one of my own.”
Tony nods. “I can’t – ask Steve,” he says awkwardly. “It’s a long story, but – I can’t do that to him, after everything he’s done for me. It’s bad enough in there without – I don’t want to make it a big deal, understand? But I would really – I would feel shit if I missed it. I can’t miss it. I don’t know if – you’re working, if you are I understand and I’ll figure something out, it only has to be for ten minutes or so. I mean I know the drive is long but – you know what forget it, it’s fine. I can go a whole year without visiting, what makes this day so special, I’ll go another – “
He claps his hands over his head. “I ruined it,” he says, “I’ve ruined everything. Myself, and you, and Christmas, and – and – “
Tony’s eyes drift upwards. Pierce looks at him, expectantly. “I’m – I’m fine,” he says, carefully, and then Pierce is pulling back his head, hand in his hair. “I’m with Pierce,” he says.
He’s reaching forward. He pulls Tony against him, slowly, buries his nose in his throat. Cheap axe, and sweat. Tony after-battle. “Uh,” he says, letting Steve curl his arms around his back. “Alright there, Rogers. It’s – alright. We won, huh?”
“Maybe she’s really just that kind,” Steve says, grudgingly. “Maybe — some people are, Tony. Does it surprise you that there’s still goodness in the world?”
Tony lifts his chin, bares the line of his neck. “Okay,” he says, moving his lips as little as possible, “look at me, Steve. I’m so open for you.” He grips his wrist, makes him stroke down his throat. “I’ll do anything you want if you touch me there, you know I will.”
“Hah. Yeah. He’s — make sure they’re feeding him. Don’t tell the guards, they might — “ Tony lowers his voice. “People take things that matter, right? I don’t want to lose him too. HYDRA will do anything.”
“Right,” Tony breathes. “Sure. You mean it, though?” He asks, following Steve as he walks through the rubble. “You mean that. You’re not gonna – this is a real conversation, right? I’m holding you to it. I know I’m a fun guy, but I’m being 100% serious here, buddy. We need a team.”
“Sure I do. I used to have kale smoothies all the time when I was rich and had people make them for me.”
Steve holds the phone to his ear for a long time. He doesn’t know why he’s — what is this, jealousy? Tony is allowed friends, he’s allowed friends outside of this corrupt, hyper-dependant team. It’s good, it’s healthy, and Sarah is a lovely girl.
They’d shared a bed last night, him and Pierce. Tony can’t remember. He knows he probably came onto him – stupid, pathetic, drunk and frightened, it’s the exact kind of insane response he has in those situations. He thinks they didn’t fuck; Tony woke up dry, sheets clean. But his throat is bruised, and bitten, his lips swollen. He pulls the collar of his coat tighter around his throat. He hates himself. He hates himself so, fucking much.
Tony doesn’t like DC. Times like this, he misses Malibu, his wide open home, his quiet street, the private stretch of beach. His fortress, overlooking the ocean. New York, he can manage – he grew up there. But here, the alphas in suits and dark glasses, the betas with brand new cellphones and heel clicking on concrete – he doesn’t like it. It’s politics, he decides. It’s the politics he hates.
“Flying, if I’m honest. It felt like I was flying, one last time.” He turns, as if speaking to someone Steve can’t see. “Not much longer.”
He’s not a sadist. What was he supposed to think, after he left? No reason, no acknowledgement of – anything. He’d shook his hand. He’d
“Well, you keep doing that, Tony. After your gala, with Pierce. Don’t stay at the hotel. Come home, see me.”
The difference, however, is that your father loves you. And so do I. But what I feel... it is not the love a mother should feel for her child, certainly. When I say I am sorry, I say it almost from an objective viewpoint. Any outsider would weep if they saw what we did to you. How we send away the only man that ever cared for you in this house, the only person that ever injected interest into your life, and didn’t tell you where he went.
“Tell Lana,” Gus sighs “tell her I’m sorry. Tell I her I love her. I know it won’t matter much, but — ”
Had them burnt. But then, Tony had said a lot of things, emaciated and sick, exhausted from travel, still wounded from battle.
“That’s hurtful, Tony. That’s really hurtful, when I gave up time to care for you. And I don’t regret it, I don’t begrudge it, but — please. Don’t undermine what I did.”
“Nothing.” Clint says quickly. “It’s – yeah. Wow.” He takes a flat spoon and carves out a piece of, what looks like, some kind of meat pie. It’s grey and brown inside. What might be mashed potato on top. “Look delicious.” He says dully.
He’s not surprised when Steve turns up, bag on his shoulder, clearly planning on getting the next chopper out. “You shouldn’t be in here,” Steve tells him, without much bite. He starts packing his clothes, rolling them tight, pushing them to the bottom of his bag. The military method.
Pierce is quiet. He unzips the pack, rifles around for material. “Well,” he seems to say is carefully, like he’s thinking about his answer, “we’ll try to find their families, friends. They’re all very… I think Hill mentioned, they’re obviously all quite scarred.”
“We were always taught it was cavemen,” Steve says, frowning. “Like, the alpha would take the beta men to hunt, and the beta women would be left with the omega.”
Sick enough that he throws up down his blue blue gown. His nose wrinkles. He tries to wipe at his mouth, but he tugs the place where the IV is stuck in his arm. "I was sick." He says, to no one. The nurse is gone.
him to sell? What do you think I was, some kind of wunderkind? Shut up, I know I was, I mean – as if he would listen to a kid omega, barely heating, with what to do with his own damn stock.”
But God, does that ache. He wants it, too. He thinks about a kid from his belly, who looks like Steve, and when he thinks about all those years stretching out in front of him it doesn’t scare him. If anything, it fills him with
“I know I haven’t been great,” Gus says, mouth slack, breathing laboured “but, but if I die c’n I ask you a favour?”
They take his arm, gently fold it out, swab the skin with cotton. Tony is in so much pain. They prick him, tape it all up. He starts to slip away. He hears sirens. He hears blood in his ears. Paramedics speaking a language he doesn’t understand. And then Steve, who kisses his palm before he goes so far under he can’t tell sound and taste and sight apart from anything at all. The pain follows him. Eventually, blissfully, he blacks out.
“We know, Captain, shh,” she says again “you just close your eyes. Sleep, and when you wake up we’ll be somewhere safe. Then we’ll put together a plan, okay? And we’ll get Tony back, simple, don’t you worry.”
“He must. He looks built for it,” and she absent-mindedly strokes the top of Mosely’s head until he curls at their feet. “Anyway,” she says “back to work.”
They want Steve to work through his rut, the natural way. The most efficient way. And they know Tony’s the only omega that perfect mix of slutty, dumb, and bold to actually do it.
Steve frowns. He’s slowly stroking Tony’s leg under the blanket. “Sure, Tony. Of course I do, how could I not?”
“Thousands. Millions. Civilisations have been and gone in the time long before earth existed. Don’t strain yourself, now, I wouldn’t want to give you a headache.”
Tony frowns, tendrils of sleep fading from his mind. He lost his maker, Gus, Gus died at the border. And his imprint, his imprint is Steve, so why—
Pierce smiles again. It doesn’t reach his eyes. “C’mon,” he says instead of answering, “I have a gift for you.”
“He isn’t our friend, Steve. And he’s going to try to trick you. It’s what he does, he’s a liar, Steve, and he wants you dead, he hates you more than anything. No matter what he tells you, don’t listen, he won’t kill me – “
“I am Aesir. You are human. What we call magic, you call science. Loki, for all his talents, is nothing more than a particularly adept physicist. Or was it chemist? Where’s Tony when you need him, hmm?”
Pierce stubs out a cigarette in an ash-try. “It won’t be hard,” he’s saying. “I know you don’t believe me, but there are studies that prove it. They’ve repressed them, of course,” he tells Tony earnestly, “they repress anything that goes again the current
“I suppose,” Nick says, after a time of playing with the cards, “that I was thinking about how all this played out.”
“No,” Tony snap, swerving to avoid his grasp, reaching for the bottle. “It’s not yours, you can’t even get drunk.”
"Right. Basically, yeah. It was like stress relief, almost. I mean, it was never sexual. And I think -- I think it could be beneficial to both of us."
“He’s right,” Pierce observes, lighting up. “Nasty habit, From Stark, and the world could do with having you with us as long as we can.”
And stroke his hair back from his head. Tony’s vision is still so blurry. He tries to blink to clear it; doesn’t work. Someone is stroking his hair, though, like it’s supposed to be calming. Tony won’t stop crying though. It’s not working. He still hurts so bad, he’s still so – he doesn’t know.
Tony laughs. “You’re asking me to rent myself out and take a lot, at significant personal expense. You’re going to have to give me something in return.”
“This is how you thank people,” Pierce tells him. “You let people use your body. It’s what you were bred for. You were bred to belong to other people, weren’t you? You know this.”
The soldier in the doorway. Tony sees him, in his peripherals; he tries not flinch. The soldier says, he’s here. Pierce leans back, heavily. Sighs, and brushes down his pants.
Pierce shakes him, impatient. “I never left, last night. Pierce isn’t – he isn’t – he isn’t our friend – “
“Initializing,” the helmet says, startling him. “Voice input identified: Captain Rogers. Relaying message.”
Steve grunts. Tony groans, head lolling forward. “I don’t,” he mumbles, “I don’t want to go to the party.”
Tony shuts his eyes, hands grasping to fist his hot, swollen prick, to finger his sloppy pussy. “No,” Steve orders shortly, kicking his hands away. The sole of his boot rubs once, hard, against Tony’s cock; his eyes water, his prick jerks.
Which might be true. But if Steve wanted a relaxed conversation, he would have chosen the lounge, not a conference room eighty floors high bracketed by glass on all sides where anyone can see.
Lana will miss him. Lana will be… inconsolable. But Lana will age. She will grow. One day, she may take another lover. Or she may end up like Diana. Dead inside, vicious. Killing for killings sake.
“You’re right,” Tony tries, frantically, “it’s not safe, it’s not. I was a stupid, silly bitch for thinking I could – please, Steve. Please, calm down.”
Tony wants to nod. He can’t. Instead, he swallows around Steve’s cock and is rewarded with a shiver of gratification. Steve pushes his boot between Tony’s legs; the leather, the laces, scratching against his hole. And then the mortification is so fucking heated, burning, that Tony feels his entire body flush, can only shut his eyes against it. Steve is tsk-ing. “Look at that,” he murmurs, “you’re dripping all over my new boot.”
“Good.” He’s sitting there, looking up at him, frowning slightly. He reaches up a hand and – tucks some errant strands of hair beneath the strap of the gag. He nails scratch at Tony’s scalp. It’s nice.
Tony made it. He’d had it, before – Before. He’d kept it under his bed. Steve had found it, one night.
“You know how I know you’re clever? The other bitches we tested on could barely string a sentence together by now. Which is strange, because you really are
Steve doesn't tell Tony this, but there is a method to these scenes. Subs are more receptive to ideas when they're in the space. At some point -- or many, over the years -- Tony has been told things while under that have lead to negative impressions of himself. You're stupid, you're worthless. Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy. Steve didn't notice, when they first met, because it's difficult to tell. But once he started taking Tony down himself, it became clear. The crying, the difficulty to drop. The fear of it. His revulsion towards contracts. None of it natural, but also not unexpected.
Tony feels a familiar ache, like a longing, or being hollowed out. “No,” he says, “not now. Maybe later.”
Sarah bites her lip. “Canada,” she says. “I’m moving to Canada. I want to get this photography business off the ground, and my brother says he’s willing to lend me some cash.”
“You’ve… you’ve drugged me,” Tony slurs, half-indignant, half-terrified, or at least he would be, if his body let him work up the panic. “You bastard, you – “
“It’s alright, now,” Steve says like he’s soothing a nervy horse. He strokes one hand against the side of Tony’s neck, right down to his shoulder. “We should be allowed to talk about this, right? It’s not like it’s a secret. And you’re very important, Tony. Absolutely vital.”
Sarah is silent for a moment. “I’ll take care of him, Mr Rogers,” she says very softly. “You can be sure about that.”
He keeps petting him, all the way home. By the end, Tony feels like he’s been melted in acid and doped with opiates for the pain. Like he’s sagging, sloughing away. “I’m sorry,” he says to the driver, when Steve urges him out of the cab. “I’m sorry I shouted at you, you didn’t deserve it.”
“And you, him,” Fury notes. “Alpha like that – I suppose to him it’s only natural that you two would…”
Steve teases his hands through hair, damp with sweat. He smoothes his thumb over Tony's cheek, distorted by the gag that spreads his lips. "You look like a piece," he says "you know that? Like a perfect little sub. Bred for pleasure."
He lets him grip him gently by the back of the neck, guide him to the elevator. “Thank you, Rumlow,” he hears Pierce murmur, “I can take it from here. Just make sure the men know I have Stark, safe and sound.”
The date draws him up short. How did he miss this? Was he just not – thinking? Well, yes, clearly. But the 18th, that’s only a day before –
like fifty year of hard-won omega liberation is nothing but a trick, an allowance, or maybe some kind of elite scheme to stop the breeding of healthy children.
“Pierce is here already?” Steve asks distractedly, searching the crowd. “I’ll go find out what our fearless leader needs. Tony, I’ll – meet you there,” he says, absently patting his arm.
“You’ve clearly already had these thoughts,” Fury shrugs, “you’re half-way there. You’ve almost made him yours. Now, put that influence to good use. It’s all I’m asking.”
But Tony smiles. “I made a mess,” he says. “I thought maybe I could clear up before you got in, but — surprise.”
He can’t breathe. He makes himself as small as he can, no one will find him, he will snap and bite his teeth at them. He had done this, he remembers now, crawled away during the worst of it and tried to make himself small, to plead, but they had taken his ankles and dragged him across the floor, and it had burned his chest as he clawed at carpet, and after he’d found microfibres under his nails –
And Tony would wail, pitch himself in Steve’s shoulder, and on those nights Steve was happy to hold him, to sit with him, to wait until he quietened and then surreptitiously replace his drink with tea.
The alpha is resting his chin on Tony’s shoulder, kissing a line up his neck. Tony bats him away. “Mechanical?” He prompts.
The doctor's fingers probe his head. It hurts. Tony moans softly and tries to push him away. Next thing he knows, there's a stretcher. Things get blurry. He's sitting on a bed.
Tony sits next to him feeling strangely heavy. He's tired now. He wants this to be over. The drop is settling in fast, and he just wants to curl in bed on Steve's chest, let him play with his hair. "Listen to me," Steve says "Tony. I... I know I was an ass, just then. I know that. And you're right. There's this part of me that doesn't want to admit I'm weak, doesn't want to accept help from a sub. It's not your fault. It's not that I don't trust you. It's my own issue and... I'm working on it."
Mosely is allowed to sit on the couch. The sun is streaming through the windows. Tony falls asleep there.
“You loved it, really,” Ty says, leaning closer, breath hot and smelling – minty. He chews fucking spearmint gum, still? After all this time? Tony puts his hands between their chests, pushes him back a little. “You always liked to be treated badly.”
“None of us need to fear each other,” she spits. “Wanda, you need to look Tony in the eye. Tony, I’m sorry, but you need to realise we will not hurt you, not now, not ever.” Not ever again, his mind fills in.
Tony roars with pain, lurches forward; Pierce pushes against him, thighs on Tony’s thighs, hands on Tony’s arms, pressing until his wrist ‘pops’ in its socket. Tony slams his head against Pierce’s once, and twice, dazes him enough to snap his shitty, broken wrist back out of his grip, drop the knife, snatch at it with his good hand –
Steve’s eyes flick up. “You all are,” he says. “I know things are different now. I’m not stupid. But I am your alpha, whether you like or not.”
The dog’s colouring is dark, almost black with brown patches for eyebrows and a white crest on it’s chest. It’s big, probably up to Tony’s mid thigh. And it’s sleeping, stretched out on a bed, chest rising and falling slowly.
At the end of the hour, when Sarah is ready to leave, she asks if Mosely likes to play fetch. Tony admits he doesn’t know, because he doesn’t like anyone else walking him, and he can’t really throw and catch a ball with his hands the way they are.
The pheromones Steve’s pouring out make him more receptive, give rise to the opposite scents and hormones inside Tony’s body. When he comes, it’s brief, and smooth, almost superficial, like he’s in heat. “Thanks,” he hears himself sighing, leaning forward, grinding himself against Steve’s face through the aftershocks.
There’s a picture there, of Tony towards the end. His face is more lined, and he’s smiling, strained, like someone has told him to pose for the camera. One hand is tucked in his hair, the other holding a pen while he pours over papers. Steve recognises the shirt: this was probably the last photo that was taken before —
That doesn’t mean anything. Tony has a lot of expensive perfume. “Well, I appreciate the thought,” he smiles, letting Pierce spritz it on his wrist.
He’s maybe – drunk too much, he doesn’t know. The bar is starting to spin. His aim is getting sloppy.
Steve is very – calm, would be the word Tony’s looking for. His face gives way nothing. “I was under the impression you wouldn’t make it,” he says, voice cool.
Tony drops the glass on the floor. It lands with a soft ‘thunk’ on the carpet, the last dregs of water staining it dark beige. “Well,” he says, “I’ll try not to get hurt on your account then, huh?”
Of course, that didn’t happen. And now Steve sleeps in their bed, and Tony rests six feet under, packaged and stuffed and stitched up for propriety’s sake.
Tony’s hand shoots out, grabs Steve’s sweater and curls there. “Do I have to see them?” He breathes, not looking up. “Do I have to – I don’t want to have to see them. I don’t want them to see me. I don’t want to, I can’t, I don’t want to.”
He pulls him. Drags him close, almost chest to chest, holding his wrist above his head. “Tell me to stop,” he says, reasonably.
He cheeks don’t even flush when he says: “Because I’ve looked them up. I was trying to think, what could be
Tony laughs, but the truth is, he doesn’t find it funny. “I never took you for a chauvinist, Rogers. Old-fashioned, pompous, a little too righteous, sure. But never a flat out bigot.”
“Where are your friends, Tony?” Ty mocks him. “The Captain loves you so much he went off and left you with another alpha, an ex no less.”
“You’re going to talk to him,” Pierce explains. “You can be honest. Just say, I’m with Secretary Pierce. I paid for your intransigence last night. If you don’t meet him this evening, here, no weapons, no friends, I’m going to pay again.”
Tony’s smile is kind, his eyes crinkling. His hands are ghosting Steve’s shoulders, as if pulling him into an embrace. He seems to be imploring him, somehow, and so Steve nods. “Death is nothing,” he says.
He slips his arm beneath himself, starts to push up – Steve knocks him back down. “Stay,” he orders shortly, pacing to the observation window. He cracks his fist against it once, twice. Slams his body against the wall.
Psychology, Pierce says again. His figure doubles, triples in Tony’s view. He blinks, frowns drowsily.
“You know, of course, the things that were put inside him, how hard, etcetera. Your son,” Steve muses, “God, just nineteen, huh? His whole future ahead of him.”
"You're doing this on purpose," Steve says "I didn't mean what I said, it came out wrong, but if you leave just to spite me -- "
“Tony I — “ Rhodey reaches forward, grabs his hand with sudden strength. “Man, I don’t know what to say. If I could — if I could have stopped, what you went through, or taken your burden for even a day — “
Natasha nods. “I’m sorry,” she says. “Do you think — you’ll ever do it again? Be Iron Man? Save the world?”
It's around this point I fell in love with another man. Now I know that sounds awful. You're young, so I can't expect you to understand. Your father and I did not have a working relationship. And he was old. After your birth, after my illness, after his drinking, relations worsened. I ended up falling in love with one of his best friends.
Steve flinches slightly at the slide of Tony’s palm against his cheek, but he doesn’t recoil completely. He certainly doesn’t assault him again. In this position, he’s able to smell the sweat on Tony’s wrist – probably scared, probably familiar, and undeniably omega. Which means, no threat.
That hurts, more than Steve cares to admit. “But he always liked you,” he pushes. “More than any of us, he liked you best.”
They’re sitting at the table in the kitchen. Sarah is scrolling through the tablet Tony bought her — it’s not that money was tight for them before, exactly, but there was an appreciation that they couldn’t spend on frivolous luxuries. Now that Tony has more money than he knows what to do with, he’s happy to give something back.
She brings them over, smiles, sits herself next to him and presses close. She smooths the paper across their laps. It’s a diagram, a male torso and the rough sketches for her design. It loops, right up over his chest, up the left side of his neck, and finishes on his cheek, cradles his eye. From there, over one shoulder and then all over his back, down, down, over his ass, then his thighs. It goes round his right leg, and then back up, finishes on his belly, his navel, and Tony knows she’ll save that for last because that’s where he’ll finally break.
“So, the perfect time for you to tell me your deepest, darkest fantasy,” Tony teases, tipping back his head so Steve can see him run his tongue along his bottom lip. “Go on, Rogers. What is it? You want me – in a little maid’s outfit? You want me to be a pack bitch? What about… lingerie. Sex toys? Captain, oh my Captain, what do you wank about on those long, lonely nights when I’m not – “
“I think, I must really rattle you, Tony,” Steve tells him gently. His hand slides down from Tony’s neck, but he doesn’t make an attempt to sit up. Instead, he lets him settle his palm between his wings. “Me, being here. Taking what you thought was yours.”
“I ought to knot you right here, have you crawl back naked, and let you offer Fury your reparations on your hands and knees,” Steve tells him, coldly. “I’ve told you once, I’ve told you twice, your
“Tony please,” Steve says, and his voice is a tremble; Tony didn’t realise, but Steve is crying. “Please, Tony, you’re scaring me. You’re scaring me now, come on. Let’s go home, you need to get warm.”
And now Steve smells upset, maybe a little conflicted. “I don’t want you getting yourself into trouble on my account. Sleeping with people who don’t treat you right.”
Steve frowns at him, punch-drunk on whatever the fuck he’s been drugged with. “Silly boy,” he says fondly, letting his head fall back, gripping Tony’s waist. “C’mere,” he slurs, pulling him down his body, trailing slick along his chest. Tony’s exhilarates; he fucking loves to be manhandled, moved around like he weighs nothing. He giggles.
“Well,” Tony starts, squinting, trying think of the best way to put it delicately. “Obviously… the omega gene tends to concentrate in old lines, right? Because it runs through the carrier. And it was always a status symbol to have us, not to mention the, uh, the benefits, genetically, of spritely baby-machines who can tend the nest
He nods, once, tight, furtive. Steve doesn’t really wait – he just slides two fingers in, Tony’s already wet and dripping. He hears himself make a small noise, like a whimper, and Steve covers his mouth with his free hand, pinning him against the wall. Brusquely, brisk about it, he just slams his fingers in and out, occasionally crooking them against his sweet-spot.
The cloth is laid to rest over his brow. Tony feels a trickle of water tickle his temple as it rolls, staining the pillow below.
Tonight, Tony decides it will be different. After they’ve finished, and Tony is lying naked under the sheets, he curls himself against Steve’s chest, purposefully. It’s cold. Steve holds him – he seems to think that Tony likes the touch, maybe. It always feels like he’s humouring him.
Natasha’s right. She’s right. Steve inhales, coughs, his hair plastered to his sweaty forehead, cheeks flushed. He closes his eyes to the feel of Natasha’s hand rubbing soothing circles on his knee.
The people who do not get seats: camera crews, lots of them. Reporters. The thousands who have turned out on the streets, holding flowers in red and yellow, the children in their Iron Man costumes. Then, the millions who are watching this in Britain, in France, India, China, Australia, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, the list goes on.
"All I said was that I'm looking into help, me, on my own. It wasn't an excuse for you to jump on in, Tony, I don't need your help. Just because, just because you're damaged doesn't mean I have to be, understand? I don't know if it's some kind of, I don't know, knee-jerk reaction or -- "
Steve politely doesn’t say anything, just continues steeping the tea. It’s green. And he respects Natasha’s opinion, but he doesn’t agree, and so when she sighs, gently squeezing the tight muscle that runs from shoulder to throat, he only hums.
Instead: he waves a hand. “It’s fine,” he says, “it got away from me. I’ll remember it, though. We have time.”
He drags in again, and this time the smoke doesn’t feel liberating; the nicotine feels like the tar it is, clogging his lungs, and the stink in his nose reminds him of ash in his hair and burns on his thighs. He stubs it out on the balcony rail then flicks it off into the sky, watches it tumble, disappear into the clouds and cars way below.
The next time, Tony has moved back to New York. It’s been seven months since their one night stand, and Steve hasn’t thought much of it since. In that time, Tony has taken on a terrorist group and won by the skin of his teeth. He says he doesn’t want to be iron man anymore, that he’s going to stay in New York while he recovers.
It isn’t fair, or right, of Tony to string him along like this. To tease him with something – a monogamy he might not ever be able to really offer. “It’s not you,” he tells him, helplessly. “I’m not – I’m not made to belong to one person. I’m not bred that way.”
He pulls his hand out of his panties, swipes them on the duvet. Curls on his side and goes back to stroking his neck, listening to Steve’s soft groans. He wishes he could be there. He wishes he was there to make those noises come out of Steve’s mouth. “I love it when
Oh. Someone is singing. Tony is very, very tired. He's had a bad day. And now, someone is drawing their fingers through his hair. Their nails scrape gently over his scalp. It eases the nausea, and the pain. He starts to float.
Nebula grunts. “Remember their names,” she says. “The next time you want to lie down and waste away on a rock, remember their names.”
“Don’t touch me, don’t – “ Tony slaps at the man’s hands, in his space; the picture goes fluttering to the ground, the pen rolls off. The sound of it is magnified. Everything is very loud, and very quiet. His pulse is thudding in his temples. It’s blurry for him, now, everything is; sweat or disassociation, palms sweating, skin pricking, panic cascading across his head. He hasn’t been like this, not this bad, not in decades. He’s been touched and assaulted and tortured in all the years since and nothing, not the wormhole, not Killian, has made him this bad.
“We thought you might like to see Rhodey,” Sam says, measured. He won’t meet Tony’s eyes in the rearview mirror.
But then Tony puts down his chopstick and folds his hands against the tabletop. “I have something I need to tell you,” he says, and he doesn’t meet Steve’s eye. “I was at — I had a meeting with my doctor.”
Peter is sobbing again, but this time it’s angry, unrestrained. He’s trying to tug free, even as Steve steers him away from the crowd. “Calm,” Steve says, not a balm, a command; the kid doesn’t want kind words, Steve knows. He wants order. Steve has been here before.
“I know exactly what kind of relationship you have. Or had, at least,” Ross says, snidely. “You’ve had worse, Stark. We know you have experience.”
Tony presses. “He arranged it, I had to pay – pay reparation,” and he feels his gorge rising, covers his mouth with his hand. His head spins, his stomach revolts, and –
Fury smirks. “You always were an ambitious little bitch,” he says, with a trace of admiration. “Let me tell you what I see – I’ve looked over your records, Stark, intimately. I know you’ve had six contracts over your life, the first when you were just fifteen. Can you even remember the person you were then? Little innocent Stark, all wide eyes, long-limbs, like a baby doe?”
“Sorry, I – “ Tony’s head is full of buzzing, his hands shaking, jittery, as he pours through his wallet and pulls out cash, “I need – wrong place, I’ve got to go somewhere first. Here,” he says, throwing it at the driver, unclipping his seatbelt, “sorry. Sorry, for – sorry.”
The tag on his neck jingles. Pierce smirks; Tony tracks him with his good eye, chest still heaving. He picks at the tag. “Do you know what this says, Captain?”
Sometimes he’d test the fear. He’d work himself up to, poke his head out, open his eyes and – and the room was always empty. There never were any monsters. Now, when he cracks open his eyes, Peter’s eye loom close in his vision; on his hands and knees, pressing his head to Tony’s as if to examine his face. He recoils, jerks, sits up and wraps his arms around his head.
Steve leans forward, presses a small kiss to his cheekbone. “Do you ever think, maybe, you’ll not need to do that anymore?”
“I don’t know if Steve could pull this off on his own,” Rhodey says incredulously. “Jesus fucking Christ, they’re not just
Tony feels stiff. No, not like that, just – tired. His back aches. Staying in the same position for too long is fucking deadly for a man of his age. Christ. A man of his age. When did he get old enough to say that?
In the end, it takes both himself and Natasha to peel Tony out of bed. They sit him in the bath and clean him as best they can, and – and Tony doesn’t respond at all, doesn’t say anything, just lolls in their hands, unable or unwilling to hold himself up at all. They cut his nails and hair, dress him in fresh clothes, sit him at the table and force him to eat oatmeal; Steve holds open his jaw, Natasha spoons it in, and they don’t stop until he’s eaten the whole bowl, three times a day.
“We lost everyone,” Natasha is saying, and she’s talking to Tony, Steve thinks. “They’re all gone. Bucky, Sam, Wanda. Vision is dead.
“Come here,” Steve sighs. He pulls Tony forward, and Tony goes willingly, rests his brow in the crook of Steve’s neck. “You’re alright, Tony.”
“I did. Sometimes, the way I acted, and the things I said… you take too much, Tony. I don’t know why. I could be mean.”
“Maybe one day,” he says quietly, shifting so his leg is wrapped around Tony’s, water lapping gently at their chests.
Steve looks up at him. His eyes are soft like this, unguarded. He cocks his head to the side, not submissive, but – relaxed. Inquisitive. “Tony?”
So the other alpha breaks first. “I’m sorry,” he says, bluntly. “It was a joke. It won’t happen again, okay?”
Tony doesn’t respond right away. Steve makes him stretch out his arm, brackets him completely, nowhere to go. “I said,” he repeats, calmly, “do you understand?”
Your father was is a very kind man. Which you don’t see. Which you will probably never see. He built weapons because he thought, at his very core, that he would be helping people. At the time, Tony, that was what life taught him. Maybe life will teach you something different. Your father saw war, and he acted accordingly. You fight a war with soldiers and those soldiers need weapons.
“Yeah, and what kind of life is that? If you’re going to just lock him up you might as well let him end it.”
“What?” Tony says, frowning. “Oh God, was it that obvious? Fuck, I’m sorry, I – didn’t mean to, to make a scene. You should go.”
It shouldn’t matter. He and Tony are done. Even if Tony felt the same way as him, it would… be wrong. To initiate that, with a man who so clearly doesn’t know what he wants, who would do anything, unpredictable.
Tony smooths his fingers over the bites backs on his neck and shoulder, pinches and twists the skin. The pain feels good, grounding. He lurches off from the wall, pushes Steve back, back, back into one of the armchair. He knocks over the vase on the table, but whoops, he’ll make sure to leave a big tip on his bill.
Pierce laughs. “No. I… I’m immensely grateful to the Captain,” he says, honestly. “I suppose – I would be lying, if I said I didn’t worry. About him, about his mental…”
Tony has to physically force himself to shovel food into his mouth. It tastes of nothing, lies heavy in his stomach, thick on his tongue. Sarah is just watching him. Each time he stops, or tries to push the plate away, she reminds him he can’t leave until he’s finished.
“People know I’m a slut,” Tony tells him. “It’s not a surprise. Uh,” he doesn’t really know how to explain. “The video Ty had – the pictures, too. They were
“It wasn’t intentional.” Gus hisses. “Don’t you understand? Have you never — I thought he was safe. I thought, you, maybe would die, but you are an acceptable loss. He never was.”
“From Stark?” Pierce interrupts, quietly. He hasn’t moved, as if he’s afraid to. Tony opens his eyes, slowly, exhausted. And then realises what he’s doing.
“No. You know that’s not what I mean, Stark. I think you use your body to get what you want, and that’s fine, and I don’t care, but sometimes I think – you delude yourself,” he says, shortly.
but the words don’t connect in his head, and all that comes out is a mumble, a murmur. The person tsks.
He listens to Ty talk, explaining financial projections and software compatibility and stuff that, in general, Tony already either knows or doesn’t matter, answering Fury’s questions. It’s hard to focus, he won’t deny. He thinks Steve’s eyes might be on him, but he ignores them. He’s not in the mood, and they haven’t even fucked since he accidentally punched him in bed, the bruise hastily concealed for this meeting.
He’s so still. He doesn’t turn. The doctor says that Tony isn’t talkative, opens his mouth and blabbers like Tony isn’t there at all. “Leave us alone,” Steve says shortly.
It appears from nowhere, this moment of passion. They have been leading to this for a long, long time, and yet it took the catalyst of Tony's torture to finally convince Steve to act. This, this moment, is the culmination on their bond, their imprint. Steve wants to remember every minute.
“You’re going to need to talk to your bankers. Get your advisor — what was his name? You know, the one with the red hair — “
Now, Mosely rests his chin on Tony’s chest while he absent-mindedly scratches behind his ears. Despite not having to be up by half nine, he doesn’t think he’ll be able to get back to sleep. He rolls and checks the alarm; 06:12, 18th of December.
“You’ve made a mess in your panties,” Pierce tells him, roughly. “I need to take them off. You’re not going to create a fuss.”
Tony sighs. He gathers some ashes in his hand and lets them drop off the cliff and down below. A few swirl away into the late night breeze.
“If you die tonight, you join me here. And you’ll be happy, I don’t doubt it. But what about everyone else, Steve? What about Barnes? What about the world? Don’t you think they need you? Don’t you think they care?”
“Oh, I don’t know, Steve. How about I cook you some ham, and potatoes, and gravy, and I pull on some stockings and you light the fire and we play happy families. Would that be nice?”
His arms slam into the wall, fast, fencing him in. “If you hadn’t turned me down,” he simpers. “Just think of the beautiful babies. Think of the
A nurse tells him he has a guest. This surprises him; he hasn’t been allowed any for awhile, on account of his violent tendencies. The nurse tells him he should bathe, and she’ll send someone to shave his face. Tony lets them.
Tony strains up to press a kiss to Steve’s chin. That earns him a snort, and a heavy, soft hand on the back of his neck. “Mmm,” he sighs, sleepily. “I should get hurt more often, huh? If it means… you being nice to me…”
Peter grins. “Yeah, well. Like I said, she’s very grateful. Incredibly grateful, actually, she wants to thank you in person, but — “
Tony’s vision is prickled with black dots. His head is spinning. He feels his eyes rolling back into his head.
He thinks, they’re probably watching this behind the screen and laughing. They’ve probably all placed their bets. “Bad?” He asks, quietly.
They eat in silence. Tony can’t speak, and Nick doesn’t push it. He keeps the radio playing: it tells Tony what he needs to know. It talks about Steve, and the Potomac, and the helicarriers. Tony stirs his spoon limply around his bowl. He doesn’t have much of an appetite; even if he did, Nick’s stew tastes like ballsack.
Tony fishes out his phone and proudly flicks through some photos. A little girl sitting on his shoulders in a yellow sundress, and a younger boy with paint smeared on his hands, gleefully holding them up for the camera.
“No!” Steve blusters “No, no, I — I want you to go. I mean, I want you to do what you want. Yeah, of course you can. It’s not like — I’m your keeper, or whatever, I can’t actually tell you what to do.”
"About how different you are." Steve says simply "When you're under. You're just -- " Steve sighs "I don't know. It's weird, how it works."
“Back at HQ, I have — I have a dog. His name is Mosely. Could you go by and just see how he’s doing?”
“Like fuck. No tuxedo – you weren’t invited, were you? You’re here to help, like a fucking guard-dog.”
It pains Steve to think that that year and a half is the best year of his life ever lived. How they were all so full of hope. Steve, so close to finding Bucky, with a family, and friends. Tony, believing in the change he was enacting, free of the reactor in his chest. Tony smiled often back then. He stopped drinking so much.
“No,” Steve says carefully. Sarah is going to be gone indefinitely, perhaps forever. Tony — Tony does not look ready to hear this. “No. Said she’s going on holiday, but that she would be back soon.”
“He doesn’t trust me,” Fury says bluntly, “not after the weapons, or New York. And he mistrusts SHIELD to a fault.”
Tony manages to draw a square. It’s probably the closest he’s come to drawing a line without wiggles. Once, Tony was known for his steady hands. He could draw schematics without rule, dead straight, even while roaring drunk (because it came in handy more than once.) Now he struggles to write his name. It’s not a bad thing, necessarily; it’s not like Tony will ever need to sign anything important ever again.
“I’m told you and Pierce go miles back,” Rumlow says, feeding his arm through Tony’s. He tolerates it if only for the sake of appearances; Rumlow’s grip feels insidious.
I failed you, yes. There are other things, as well. You are a lot like your father, Tony. I don’t know yet if you will turn out to be like him, in the end. I don’t think your father ever foresaw turning into what he ended up. Your father was a good man, Tony. I mean it. I would not have married a cruel man.
“He must have felt good about himself, hmm? Sending you to college. He probably felt like he could pat himself on the back, consider his part well-done.”
“Stark – it was a joke,” the man explains away. “We meant nothing by it, it’s just something we heard – “
Regardless, three seconds later he’s dead, so are six other bystanders including the idiot driver who lit the fuse. Steve spends four hours scampering around the road trying to stick Tony’s body parts back together, and the next day they’re still trying to scrape bits of him off the sidewalk.
"I'll talk to him," he hears Rhodey saying. He listens to his footsteps, coming up the stairs. The knock on the closet door.
“So – “ Tony heaves, sitting himself up, “it looks like I might die. Don’t count your chickens just yet. Although… obviously, I’m not sure if you’re alive. God,” he mutters, “that would be a bummer. Not because – not because I
The girl who shows them around is young, chirpy. Tony seems to disappear into his hoodie, hands buried in the pocket and large, swarthy grey material swamping him. She shows them puppies, and Steve asks Tony which one he likes. He suggests one, and then another, and Tony just shrugs, kicks his feet against the dusty concrete ground.
“He loved you, though,” Steve tells her, earnestly. “Everything, the life you built, the life he wanted to give you.”
“I hope you’re not investing,” Gus coughs, suddenly, and blood flies from his lips. “I hope,” he starts again, voice weary “that you’re not investing too much in your team, Captain.”
The radio in the kitchen has been turned higher, as if to wake him from slumber. The caster is saying –
Instead of returning to their cabin they stay out that night, on the lake. Tony and Steve, side by side, staring up at the stars.
No, another part of him will says no, Steve was always good to us. He was always kind. He’s worried about us. He loves you, he wants to help you.
What alerts him, strangely enough, is the smell. Earth, old. Mouldy, even. Like the wet soil you get in the fall, when the leaves have crushed into the earth.
Pierce moves off, carefully lowers him down. He picks up his legs and arranges them on the couch. There’s a cushion beneath his head; it scents like Pierce, but sharper. Colours bloom behind his eyes, he’s dizzy with exhaustion. He’s draped in Pierce’s coat. It smells like aftershave. His dreams are strange.
He can hear shouting outside the makeshift tend they’ve erected. He frowns, pinches the IV in his arm, pulls it free. “You shouldn’t,” the nurse warns, but it lacks conviction, like she knows she can’t stop him, and IV doesn’t matter anyway.
They’re HYDRA. The doctors. He knows it. He tried to put together a suit made of bed sheets, but they thought it was a noose and took it away. He knows all the doctors are evil, HYDRA, he knows what they did to Bucky Barnes they’ll do it to him too if he’s not careful. He has to be on his guard. The doctor who asks him in the morning ‘how are you today?’ is probably the new Red Skull. His smile is too wide, his glasses fake, fake glasses with lasers imbedded, or a whole new system for analysing. Who knows what the earpiece is for, maybe it’s an AI, maybe it’s so he can give out commands. Tony tells him he’ll never break, he’ll never give away his secrets.
“No,” Steve says weakly “you can’t, we can’t leave him, just,” he struggles to stand, he’s so weak, he feels so tired “if you don’t feed him he won’t be strong enough, just, you must have brought blood?”
He looks up, meets Tony’s eyes. “Oh, no,” he says, putting down the salve, “oh no, Tony, no, don’t cry. Hey, it’s alright – does it hurt? I’m sorry, it’ll be over soon, please don’t cry.” He buffs Tony’s eyes with his sleeve. The truth is, the worst of it doesn’t hurt – the nerves are dead, anyway. The fringes can get pretty bad, irritated and raw, but it’s not the pain.
*warnings: both Tony and Steve are drugged at separate times in this chapter, and both have coerced/dubiously consensual sex*
Tony is chewing his thumb so hard he can taste blood. This is a hospital. This is a hospital? He’s insane, isn’t he? He has to be. The doctor keeps talking, kind and soft and it makes Tony want to scream. He digs his teeth in harder, feels the burst of pain, and then the doctor is trying to pull his hand away from his mouth.
He keeps his wrist there, urges Tony to scent, gently. He feels himself calming, miraculous, the scent of a non-toxic alpha, someone he knows is safe, someone he knows has power, someone he knows can stop them all from doing things to him.
That you are. That you... are. That you are. Are you that? The words don't make sense. That. You. Are. Is he what? He doesn't even feel himself listing to the side until he hears Natasha curse.
The human looks like he’s sucking a rock. “Fine,” he says, “good point. But if I’m crucial, then it’s up to me what happens next. Strange thinks I’m important. It should be my word – “
Of course, where Steve comes from, raping kids is considered bad form. In fact, where Steve’s from, they’d call
– he’s been whipped and beaten and choked. The pain gone, on that surface level; they must have given him good drugs. But inside, somewhere all calcified and rocked over…
Tony blinks. The doctor's face is twisting in and out of his vision, black spots crumbling across his eyes. The man doubles, triples, quadruples, each copy blurring and merging into one. Tony raises his hand, tries to wipe away the spots. He groans.
“On the mission, Hill said – they were testing that drug on them, right? After the fight, what happened to them?”
No, the second voice says, Steve got rid of your things because it hurt too much, Tony. Ask him. He’ll tell you, he got rid of your things because he loved you and because it hurt for him to keep them, especially after you never returned his calls. Tony you can’t let us –
Steve’s hand grasps at his cheeks, pinches them together, tugs his head forward viciously. “Always have an answer, huh?”
“You do like it,” he murmurs, “I know you do. I’d put you in panties, Tony. Pretty, tiny, lace things. I like blue, do you like blue?”
He exhales in Tony’s face. He feels himself flinch; the tag on the collar jingles, prettily. He doesn’t know what it says. Someone might have told him, but he can’t remember now. The smoke stings his eyes – well, eye. The one that can open, at least. And the quick, sharp movement sends pain cascading down his ribs, lungs constricting.
The guests who get seats: Potts and Rhodes. Tony’s big friend, the boxer, whose name Steve can’t remember. Natasha, Vision, Helen Cho. Clint has come, and is sitting silently with his wife, his children, who are crying even though they never knew Tony, not really. Sam is there, stoic, head down, hands folded in his lap. Vision looks out of place in a suit, yet listens the most intently out of all of them as a religious man — what kind of religion, what denomination? Why is there someone like this at Tony Stark’s funeral at all? — talks about ashes to ashes, heroism, sacrifice. Steve keeps thinking about how heavy the coffin had felt, and how awful it was Rhodey didn’t get to be a pallbearer, and how in another world it could have been different, and Tony could be carrying Steve.
“We don’t.” Tony downs his glass, pours some more. “But you’re usually so – punctual. Keep to your schedule, like a good little boy.”
It’s dark, it’s late. This is probably an exercise in futility. It’s nice to see that people still leave flowers, cards, memorials. That Tony is not yet entirely forgotten.
He’s still whistling when he strides onto the open floor. “Oh my God,” Steve says, dryly “you’re alive.”
“Nothing at all,” Fury says, and he sounds – angry, for some reason. “I did the exact same thing you did, but got nothing.”
“On your knees, Mister. We’re not savages here. Do it the way I know they taught you at whatever fancy school you went to.”
Steve doesn’t turn to look. His breath fogs in the air. Tony joins him, there, and they both stand, looking out over the Niagara river.
Tony is asleep. He must be asleep, now, because there’s not a single part of him that’s thinking of anything at all, except for the touch and the words, which must be obeyed.
“You, though. You were beautiful that night,” Pierce says, hushed. He strokes his knuckles across Tony’s cheek, ignores his flinch. “All long limbs and – those pretty eyes, huh? You cried, then.” Pierce’s fingers reach around his throat. “Could you cry for me now, Tony? I would like you to cry. All this time, you haven’t, not really. What is it? Am I not strong enough?”
“Oh, they’ll get an impression alright,” Steve tells him, brusquely kicking apart his legs. “If I were you, I’d keep my voice low. You don’t want to attract attention.”
Steve nods. The others are coming, now. Sam has landed, Wanda drifted down to earth. Quill and his team, T’Challa and his sister, all of them. “Oh, no,” he hears someone murmur, so softly.
Steve doesn’t respond directly. He walks back to where Tony is swaying on his feet, picks up his wrist, forces him to hold the glass. Tony feels – something, run down his spine. He likes to be manhandled. “His people called today. They’re going to stop obstructing our access to the Foreman accounts.”
Steve is gentle, more gentle than he’s ever seen him. He carefully picks at the tape and peels back the thick wad that covers the worst portion, where Killian’s palm had pressed against the front of his throat. The fingers don’t get bandaged anymore – all they need is cream. But here, in the worst part, skin was melted, deadened. Any more, and it would have burnt his throat out of him.
Steve stops, lets the sponge float in the water. He tips up Tony chin, gently, two fingers: “You back with me?” He asks, softly.
He flinches. “Pierce is going to help me make it go away,” he says, eyes tightly shut. “Please. I know what people will think. Please don’t think that. It was a mistake. I made a mistake, it was a mistake. I didn’t want it, but it was too late, and…”
He huffs. Shakes his head with disbelief. “Wow,” he says. “Okay. Because – if you’re on my side, Rogers – that’s a boon, you know? That’s a big deal.”
“Trust me,” Tony asks. He’s looking at him, now. He means it. “Because – what’s happened, I don’t think – if you had told me ten years ago – “
He hears Diana cluck her tongue, hears the drag of metal on metal as she prepares her knives. He thinks about all those evil things out there in the dark. He thinks of Thanos, he imagines Diana coming up against him, and he smiles to himself. She is pathetic.
Steve grunts. “Better,” he says, brusquely. He doesn’t linger over Tony’s prone form; he’s standing, quickly, tucking himself away, leaving Tony on the floor.
“Come in,” the person behind the door calls out. “From Stark,” Alexander Pierce is saying, taking his hand to kiss his knuckles. “My God. Haven’t you just grown?”
“Great.” Tony says, lacklustre. What does she want him to do, jump for joy? The woman has screws loose in her head, Tony can practically hear them rattling about.
Tony stares at him. “I – it’s a real relief to hear you say that, Steve,” he tells him, honest, no jokes. “I think I might sleep a lot easier tonight.”
“Oh please, you’re desperate for it,” Tony scoffs, “I can smell it off you. Who was the last person you fucked? Probably dead in the ground by now.”
He’s put on weight, though, according to the scales. And every fluctuation is carefully noted down so Steve can report it to the doctors, and every pound he gains he’s a step closer to freedom. It’s been a week; maybe, maybe if he’s lucky, he might be out of here by Christmas.
He doesn’t let go of his arm. “Steve,” Tony tries, smiling, soothing, scratching his fingers against his grip, “I’m – I’m here for you, I’m – “
Steve takes Tony’s arms and crosses them on his belly, holds him there, supportive. Warm, and secure. “Shh,” he soothes, and Tony… does. He hears himself stop. Quiet.
me, on a – personal vacation, to share your bed. I think --  “ and Steve chokes, swallows. “I think,” he says again, voice still hard, but more level, “I can expect some commitment, for four days, four days
“Then blue it is. You’d like wearin’ them for me,” he tells him, voice rough. “You’ll like the how they feel, after your ass is all red and hot, and they’re so smooth and silky.”
“Come to bed,” Steve says, warm against his back. His mouth is close to Tony’s ear. He doesn’t even flinch.
Tony nods. The Captain, has done what? What has Steve done? Where was he, again? “Is he okay?” He slurs. “Is Steve okay?”
“You don’t sound good,” Tony says, letting concern flood his voice. “Are you okay? What did the doctors say?”
“Steve told me you were here,” she says quietly. “I went down because you wouldn’t return my calls. He said – that you had a trip up. That the doctors won’t let him visit.”
“I think we should,” Steve says, and his mouth is dry. “Do something personal. Something — with us. All of us.”
“I want him on SHIELD payroll. He’ll be given top clearance, he won’t even need to attend basic. He’ll be running an elite team, working regular, keeping busy, helping people. It’s what he needs. It’s what we need.”
“When you, uh,” Steve sniffs, scratches his eyebrow with his thumb. “Whipped his feet. Did you think that it might have gone too far, then?”
“It’s urgent,” Steve agrees. “Earth’s defence is our top-priority. If we start today – the more time we have, I reckon. Suit of armor around the world.”
Rumlow works his jaw. He’s big – bigger than Steve, in a way, even though Steve would be stronger. “You sure are a little bitch, huh?”
“My dad’s gone,” she says, very gently. “He was old, and it was peaceful. Tony, do you know how long you’ve been here?”
With what? Tony can’t even remember. His head is so heavy. “Yes,” he says, so Pierce will say the words again, so Tony will feel that flush of heady praise.
Tony sits up, the water swishing around him. "Hey, no." He says "That's, it's fine. It's good, I mean, is there anything I can do to help? I have some contacts if that's what you need."
“Then they wouldn’t be you,” Steve says warmly. “Enough about it, okay? I want to hear about you. Talk to me.”
she spits, “to get any sense out of him. I had to fly the ship back myself, he’s worse than useless. The wizard traded an
“… bad day.” He catches, two words drifting up the stairs. “Wouldn’t leave bed. I know, I forget. It happens sometimes, but — but when I tried to get him to take Mosely out he threw the glass at the wall.”
It’s strange, lying in. Because usually he would be out of bed by now, but… but this doesn’t feel like depression. It doesn’t feel like he’s lying in because he can’t bear the thought of living for nothing. It’s the same kind of lie in he would have on Sunday mornings with Steve, way back when, when they were –
“Okay,” Pierce says, leaning back, “I hear you. I’ll take you at your word, From Stark. But keep it in mind. I’d like to see an omega in the senate by the end of my life.”
“Steve,” Pepper presses. “Please. Stay for dinner. Here,” she says, turning, “open that door for me, would you? Morgan? honey,” she calls, “we have a guest! Come say hello, sweetie.”
Steve's hand rests on his leg. He knows this because... because it's a fact. His eyes slide open; the world is blurry. Not worryingly so, just fuzzy around the edges. It's soothing.
It barely lasts 10 minutes, all things told. When Steve finishes, he finishes with style, a heavy grunt, one final thrust. Tony is bizarrely tempted to tell him to keep it in, let him knot – but the realities of being tied root and stem when some poor cleaning-person comes wandering through isn’t a great one.
“Isn’t that getting a bit old?” Tony pauses, rests his hands on the rail. “How is everyone? Back there.”
“Sometimes, it has to hurt. We have to hurt, to be better. You might have to hurt soon, Tony, but it’ll be worth it in the long run. The pain will be good. Order, Tony. Order through pain.”
There are clothes stacked on the bedside table. Another subtle hint. Tony accepts this with just a sigh, stripping off the filthy white shirt that was once Steve’s and now resembles a bloody, grey rag.
Other times are spent in blind panic. What is he doing here, why is he here? The Chitauri could be coming any moment, marching down streets, opening wormholes in the sky. He can’t build a suit out of the books they give him. The window in his room is too wide, it shows too much, he wants it to be closed, and he wants to be safe. What’s the most defensible corner of a square? He picks one on the wall with the door so no one can see him when they enter, so he can at least have the element of surprise. HYDRA can try and take his secrets but he can always have the jump on them, at least.
They stand in silence for a little while longer, until a dusting of snow has coated itself over their coats. “How’s Sarah?” Steve asks eventually. “How are the kids?”
“You’re surprisingly lucid,” Pierce notes, taking out a cigarette, lighting up. “Sit down, if you have to. I’ve heard it can be pleasant. Oh, sure – try to call the suit,” he laughs. “That won’t work here.”
Tony swallows what’s left in his mouth, draws his hand over his chin. “One of your own, huh?” He croaks.
But it’s not the first time Tony’s screwed up a good thing. Putnam, Teddy Putnam – the boy with the red hair and mild acne, a shy alpha who they were going to contract him to long-term, until he went and got – until he ruined it, with the Bad Contract, and all the rumors that went along with it. No one wanted him after that. Tony bets, he would have been happy with Teddy. He used to make him laugh.
"Shh," Steve says "shh. It's okay. I didn't mean for it to come out that way, and I didn't mean it as a, a bad thing."
He trails off. “It will be good for her,” he says, nodding, “because, there are lots of photos of her dad as a kid in here. You’ll want to have them.”
“Cap,” Tony says again, leaning close, squinting at him, “you look like you’ve seen a ghost. Need some rest?”
The soldier, pressed up against his back. He feels something, carefully slotted between the gap in the backrest and seat of the chair; hard, metal. Tony feels a tug of adrenalin – the
