In the tank, over his shoulder, the little diver pumped air, and the fish avoided it, and the water ran, swishing and burbling and
“You, testing cures and elixirs out on yourself?  Is that not the origin of all of this? Not that I’m complaining, as the whole quagmire got you out of the middle of nowhere and back to the capital where you belong,” Tony added with a shrug.  He pulled a handful of leaves off a nearby bush and held them out to Bruce, who shook his head.
“Eat,” the King said, pointing at the tray.  “Go on.”  Steve reached out and took a piece of bread and brought it to his mouth, chewing a bite carefully.  It was heaven.  Warm and floury, and so good, he thought he must have never had anything better.  He looked over at the King and swallowed.
Crossing the room, he heaved the door open. He didn’t know who was the more startled, himself or the guards standing outside.  It isn’t real.  It isn’t safe. It’s a prison, he thought with a desperation that buzzed under his skin, seeming to animate his whole body with a thrumming energy. They were not the usual guards, and both stared at him blankly for a moment.  Steve drew himself up, nodded once to them, and swept past them with the arrogant confidence that usually only Cam could muster.
The door lock finally caught, and Steve nudged the door open with his shoulder where it looked like it didn’t quite fit the frame correctly, which seemed to be a familiar enough routine that Steve didn’t even make a face at it.
The radio had the singular quality of being something Howard prized that Tony now possessed, and there was some bitter satisfaction in that, but it had been Cap’s, too, and, he was too old to care about that, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to actually do any of the things he thought about.
There is a path through the mountains, he thought to himself, and put the necklace on.
And Bucky had smiled, wide and devil-may-care and a little sad, maybe, and tipped his cap a little as they strolled to a group of older women with their hair in kerchiefs and their baskets of rations tucked under their arms, setting them to twittering like schoolgirls, the way Bucky could, so effortlessly.  Steve remembered loving him so much in that moment, so deeply, all pure and certain and fueled by a lifetime of huddling by the big wireless in Bucky’s parents’ living room listening to Empire Builder, playing pirates down at Baisley pond, shared strips of candy buttons, a pile of sofa cushions that became a fort to stave off the Indian attack, too many bloody knuckles and busted lips to count, the last gasp of childhood clinging to the them that night before they both went off and became men too soon.
“There you are. I was looking for you,” Brock said as Steve sidled up next to him.
“Oh,” Tony replied, dropping his gaze to pick at a loose thread on the quilt.  That would have been nice, Tony thought to himself, imagining strolling the grounds of his parents’ home with Steve while Jarvis looked on.  “That sounds nice.”
“Go on. Go impress me,” Steve said, tossing his head towards the Jerak’ho.
“Can I?” Steve asked.
The garage was much the same as Tony remembered it, though the workstation had been upgraded several times in the past decade, tools replaced, and a new fabrication console added.   There were other changes, of course, accumulated over the decade.  Two bikes hung from a rack on the wall, mementos from their brief foray into mountain biking that ended when a tree nearly got the best of Tony.  On the other hand, they did get a good three year’s worth of firewood out of that thing by the time Steve was done, so there was that.  A nearly pristine set of golf clubs sat in a black bag in one corner.  Golf had seemed like a good enough idea, until Steve shot an eighteen on his first round while Tony dripped sweat in the California sun.  Stacked bags of shelled nuts lined the far wall.  Storing up for winter, Tony thought with a small smile. A dull silver ladder stood behind the bags, partially obscuring a framed Back to the Future poster.  A dry erase board hung on the wall by his workstation with a reminder to call Agent Paz accompanied by a doodle of Tony asleep in his chair with big Z’s floating above him.  He was pretty sure that message was at least two years old.
“I’m not sure I follow,” Steve replied, giving Tony a pointed look.
“I—sure?” Tony said, taken a bit aback.  He looked at Steve, almost to verify he’d heard correctly, then walked over and bent down to pick up the shield.  The Shield.  A jittery stroke of excitement shot through him.  This was all so surreal.  His Alpha was Captain America.  He was handing Captain America his shield.  Captain America was probably going to bend him over some nice, hard surface at some point.
“You already ordered?” Steve asked, brows pulling together as he glanced down at the menu for no reason other than to give himself something to do that wasn’t look between Stark and his cadre dancing attendance.
It took another week to finish the painting properly, but he did manage to pull a B for the semester.  His professor loved the piece, even asked Steve to put it in one of the student exhibitions, but he couldn’t do it for reasons he wasn’t even sure he could explain to himself.  He brought it home and leaned it against the wall with the others, though he would find his eyes drawn to it during the day, even though it was just the back of the frame.  He knew which one it was.
It wasn’t long before Steve’s eyes drifted closed.  His tiny body went soft with sleep almost in an instant.  One minute a squirming mass of tiny human, and off to dreamland the next.  How long had it been since Steve—since any of them—could find sleep that easily, Tony wondered.
“My heir will rule one day. All of these lands, these people, they will be in his or her hands,” Tony continued, his eyes on Steve, a thread of something almost urgent setting a slight tremor in his voice.  “What manner of leader do you imagine they could become, raised from childhood to understand such a responsibility? With love, guidance, an education, an...appreciation for all peoples they one day rule.”
Someone brought him dinner on a silver tray with the different options separated by raised lines.  He ate because his body needed it. The quiet had a different quality when you were eating alone than when you were just alone, Steve thought to himself as he chewed. The television was on, though muted, and a scrolling bar of news ran along the bottom telling him about gas attacks, a celebrity divorce, a shooting, and a big bank being fined for something Steve didn’t understand, though he remembered his mom asking for a loan one time while he sat stiffly in the chair beside her in a too-big suit jacket and shoes stuffed with newspapers, trying desperately not to start coughing.  He’d pinched his cheeks before they went in to get rid of the pallor, but by the look the bank officer gave him, it didn’t exactly give him the bloom of health. He couldn’t remember what the man looked like. It was odd, those old memories that were hazy and flawed, but easier to look at sometimes, softer and muted as they were.
“Ah, no,” Coulson said, shaking his head quickly.  “Just to be safe.”  White Coat One drew his hand back like he’d stuck it in a flame, which would have been comical except for the rather terrifying realization that literally no one was going to risk crossing his new Alpha, so he should probably not require any actual physical assistance while he was here.  On the other hand, he’d probably kick ass at hand-to-hand combat at the moment.   “Tony, Dr. Reese is going to go over some things with you,” Coulson said, indicating a door just over White Coat One’s shoulder.  “I’ll wait right out here until you’re done.”
Tony was as good as his word, Steve had to admit.  In the privacy of their chambers, he listened to Steve, more than Steve had ever dared to hope.  Treated him as an equal.  Tony was almost zealous in his interest in improving the lot of the Realm’s slaves, making Steve wonder if each new proclamation or charitable gesture was meant as an appeasement as much for Steve as for anyone else wearing a collar, as if Tony sought to use good deeds to grind down his conscious like a millstone.  He will change, Steve told himself.  Already, Tony was different, after all. Even Rhodes said as much.   In time, Steve told himself.  In time, Tony would be able to see.
“Bit like old times, to be honest, getting into a fight in an alley with a bunch of bullies,” Steve shrugged, seemingly totally unimpressed by the professionally trained mercenaries who had just tried to kill him.  Either that was stupidly hot or just stupid, Tony wasn’t sure, but he’d take it. Tony’s gaze scanned up and down Steve’s body, looking for injuries. Steve chuckled lowly, knelt down in front of Tony, between him and Obie Tony noticed, and gave Tony a slightly affronted look.  He looked back up at Tony with raised eyebrows.
The idea that Steve wouldn’t be mad hadn’t occurred to him.  Well, not mad at Tony, anyway.  Stone…well.  Hard to muster any real sympathy there.  Custom-made Douglas fir wood paneling, Tony thought with a low snicker.  Just trying to catch some air and look at the stars, groping not required.  That’s what you get for ruining my night, buddy, Tony said to himself.
“I do not worry, Tony.  Not since the very beginning,” Steve said, his voice soft.  He knew that this plagued Tony, perhaps more than it bothered him.  He wasn’t sure if that was the way it should be, but it was the way it was.  Steve reached out and grabbed Tony’s hand, interlacing their fingers and squeezing.  “Hey,” he said, drawing Tony’s gaze back to him. He rolled over and sat up, scooting down the bed until he was nearly face to face with Tony.  “I don’t worry. That has nothing to do with—with any of this. With us. Not now.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, rubbing the back of his hand lightly across his cheek where it puffed up, “I was heading back here, and who I assume was this Batroc guy and a few of his friends jumped me in an alley not too far from here,” Steve told him.  “Speaking of, JARVIS, can you let the police know there are some men in the alley behind the NoMad they need to pick up?”
“Ah, hey, Pep, how’s it going?  Listen, how quickly can we buy a building?” Tony asked, watching Steve’s head jerk back and his whole body stiffen in surprise.  “Yeah, the owner here is really unreasonable with their leasing provisions, and Steve’s a stickler for that sort of thing.”
It was harder from this angle to take Tony in, but he knew his body was made to do this, so he swallowed around Tony’s cock, wetting his suddenly dry throat, then bobbed his head up and down a few times. The saliva was pooling in his mouth, and he was getting a better feel for the motion and sensation of his airway being cut off. He tried to blank out all else, letting his brain and body catch up to each other and get past the instinctual resistance.
“Well, that’s certainly quite the gesture,” Jarvis remarked.  “It’s quite a bit nicer than your father’s coupe.”
“You turned it into strip-Risk, and I surrendered,” Steve recalled, biting at his lip to keep from smiling.
“Everything about you does it for me,” Steve replied, then dipped his head and bit his lip, looking at Tony with a bit of an embarrassed flush made worse by the warm water that pinkened his skin.  “I do like your hair, though. It’s all…swoopy,” he added, swirling his hand around under the spray a bit.
“I really do.  You really love me, too, huh?” Steve replied, cocking his head to one side as he tried to angle his body so he could look up at Tony.  He squinted a bit, smile going wobbly and a bit giddy, then grinned, full and happy, up at Tony.  Like a switch being flicked, Tony thought to himself.  Except, I can flip it the other way.  Sometimes.  Maybe not all the time, but sometimes.  Who knew?  Maybe that’s what love is, when you got down to it.  Not that thing that fixes you.  Not the thing that changes the whole world.  But, that little push that switches you to happiness.  That one thing that tips the scales. Tony blinked, throat suddenly tight, and swallowed around the lump that had floated up from his chest.
Or, maybe Howard was just being a dick.  Hard to say, Tony admitted darkly, shooting a glare at where his father hid behind the business section of the Wall Street Journal, which literally no one believed he was actually reading.
That was the problem, Steve could admit. He didn’t know much of anything about Tony or what this really was to Tony, though, at the moment, it seemed a lot less of a problem than it had when he’d watched Tony head out of the penthouse earlier.  Steve knew he had feelings for his fake husband, feelings which were apparently written clearly enough on his face for Bucky to harangue him into manning up.  But, Tony—well.  Tony
“Hugely convenient, I love not having to explain myself.  How much longer ‘til that trick doesn’t work?” Tony asked.
“Surely you jest?” Tony asked, face pulling back into surprise. “You? Frail?”
Despite the late morning, they managed to leave Firstpost without too much delay.  A crowd gathered to see them off, and watch Tony thank the innkeeper with what Ms. Potts had told him was tradition.  Three gold coins, which Tony dropped one by one into the man’s hand while the crowd roared their approval. Tony gave them a jaunty wave and a practiced smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes, but they loved him all the same. A part of Steve wanted to shout that they barely knew him, that all the carefully cultivated stories, even Steve’s own appearance in them, wasn’t really who Tony was, but he knew the value of a myth.  Probably more than most, he understood the protection it gave to power.
“Steve,” Tony started, as gently as he could, because he was an utter asshole who hadn’t even thought, hadn’t even considered this, but he wasn’t quite that big of an asshole.  He should have thought of this, he knew.  Of course, he should have.  For Steve, the Forties were, what, a month ago?
“Lemonade’s fine,” Tony replied, while Steve nodded and pulled two glasses from the shelf.  “Have what you want, though.”
“I will pull this car over, so help me,” Pepper warned.
Yes, Tony thought, I need you to tell me what I was right about, and why you have a circuit I made ten years ago that doesn't even work. “I wanted to talk to you,” Tony tried instead.
“I read your books.  You have terrible taste, by the way.  Da Vinci Code? Really? Give me your phone,” Tony said, holding out his hand and making a gimme-gesture.
“Already did.  Wasn’t actually going to have coffee,” Tony said, somewhat chagrined.  “Don’t know why I…”
Steve closed his eyes. Maybe he liked cars.  Tony should get him a red one.  “Do you have a car here?” Steve clarified.
“M’kay,” Steve hummed.  Tony worked his finger in and out in a slow, long slide. Steve shifted his hips up a bit.  He drew his knees up to his sides, offering. Yes.  Yes, that would be nice.
Tony knew what every lurch of the carriage was doing to Steve.   He knew that each bump or divot in the road sent sparks of bright, stinging fire through Steve’s ass, where the marks of the strap had left long, red stripes that were fading to purplish bruises. He knew that Steve needed to touch himself with a desperation that was slowly veering towards madness.  He knew that the constant sway of the carriage afforded Steve little in the way of relief.  He was up there, with Rhodes and the rest of them, thinking about Steve, and
, he told himself, and it meant a chance to spend more time with Tony that wasn’t staring at a television screen and while Tony pretended to be engrossed.
“Howard, could we maybe talk about something—” Maria tried, brushing a hand through Tony’s hair where he stood by her side.
Just tell me.  Just tell me, Steve, and I’ll find you! You can’t ask me to leave you like—like that.
This time, Cam took to the camel—who he decreed was to be called Articus after the long-dead philosopher who wrote so many of the treatises Tony insisted Cam read—with far more aplomb. He kept up his usual stream of conversation while ‘Arty’, as their camel quickly became known, dutifully followed the backside of the camel in front of him. Somewhere far ahead, Steve could just make out the striped awning under which Tony sat near the front of the long line of riders.
“Okay…well, I’m just going to go now,” Steve said, suddenly unsure as he started to edge toward the door, but then Tony was up, wrapping his arms around him and bringing his mouth down for a long kiss.
.  I am his, and he is mine.  Bound in blood and night.  This night.
“This is not going away any time soon, is it?” Tony asked with a grin.
Behind him, the glass doors slid open, and Steve walked in.  Tony’s hand stilled where it held the rangefinder, and he gave Steve what he hoped was an appropriately apologetic, downcast look, only to be rewarded by a pleased grin spreading over Steve’s face.
“I have wanted to do that all day,” Tony whispered on a sigh.  “You were so beautiful.  I could hardly keep my eyes off you.  I could almost see your mind turning the whole time,” he grinned.  “You will have much to say, I’m sure.  I must admit, I am rather eager to hear your thoughts.  Strucker is capable, but a relic, and his engineers do little that hasn’t already been done enough times to be taught at university.  He lacks…imagination.  Something I think you have in abundance, God help me,” he finished with a quirk of his head and easy smile.
“Hello?” Steve said as he picked up.
Finally, he made himself get up and get out of his shoes and suit.  JARVIS checked his emails and voicemails while he brushed his teeth, deleting most of them, except a couple from Pepper.  He stopped on the way to bed and picked up the piece of paper with the doodle of flowers on it from the dresser, staring at it for a long moment before carefully putting it back into place.
HOLYFUCKINGSHITOHMYGODWHATTHEFUCKINGHELL??!!??!!
Tony.  It had sounded odd.  The name.  Small.  Too small for someone like the King, who seemed far more suited to a moniker than a name, let alone a fairly common one that could be carried by any number of men.  There was nothing common about the King, that much was certain, Steve thought as his mind swirled around images and caught on beats of time, the way a hook might catch on the long reeds that dotted the shoreline of the small river that cut through the town where he was born.
“I should probably check in with Bucky and Sam, too.  Let them know what happened, if that’s what the plan is,” Steve said.
“Is it not fantastic?” Cam asked, clearly elated.  “They say the first Raj’Inama was carried about on a litter by six men and if they allowed the Raj’Inama’s feet to ever touch the sand, they would be bound naked on stakes in the desert with their eyelids cut off,” Cam added happily, grinning at the gruesome tale.  “Do not look like that.  They do not do that anymore, if they ever truly did.  We are civilized now.” Steve huffed, mouth twisting into the mimicry of a smile as Cam bounced up and down on the soft seat.  He motioned to where a corked bottle and covered basket were fitted into slots built into the interior of the carriage.  “There is food and drink and look,” Cam said, reaching for a silk pouch to the side of Steve’s hand and hefting it, making its contents clink together.  “For the crowd.”
“Touch me,” Steve said.  “Please, Tony.”
“It’s okay, Tony.  I get it.  You think you’re ‘uncool,’ you should’ve seen me discovering the wall that gives you money,” Steve declared.
Tony tugged at the ribbon carefully, then harder when it wouldn’t cooperate, pulling it over one end and tearing at the paper.  A cardboard tube was inside, with plastic caps on each end.  He popped one off and tipped the tube upside down, letting the roll of crisp, creamy paper fall into his hands.  He unspooled it carefully, holding it by the edges, until the picture formed.
“Please, Tony,” Steve repeated.
“My best soldiers, Your Highness,” Rhodes said, bowing.  The soldiers went to one knee and bowed their heads, waiting.  “Expert with sword, spear, pike, axe, and hand combat.”
“They ask you any questions or just get right to the fun stuff?” Tony called out, trying to force his voice to a normal octave. He carefully scooted himself along the floor, feeling his way as he went until he bumped into the rough fabric of Steve’s uniform, finding it kind of bunched easily into his hand, as if there was more of it than there should be, which was just…odd.
Steve wrapped one arm around Tony’s neck and thrust his hips once more, pressing down and rocking against Tony’s hard cock where it tented his trousers, riding the friction and feeling while Tony groaned and grunted under him, seemingly at a loss for words.  He drew back, sitting up on his knees enough to allow Tony to find some semblance of coherence, then cupped Tony’s face in his hands.
Steve wondered why he ever even bothered.
Tony sighed and checked his phone again.  Wow.  His waxing poetic had taken all of a whopping three minutes off the clock.  Steve’s cock deserved more than three minutes, Tony thought with a snort of laughter.
“You will,” Steve replied, sure of that if little else.
“What, hmmm? What do you want? Tell me what you want, baby, I got you,” Tony urged, his voice husky and raw.  Baby, Steve’s mind hummed with pleasure. Steve could hear the desire there, in Tony’s voice, and just the knowledge that Tony wanted him so much that Steve could
At some point between Steve getting his hands on Tony’s nipples and his cock, Tony had sped up the thrusts of his fingers, spreading them apart and stretching Steve’s hole.  It burned with a pleasant ache, but it wasn’t painful at all, and there was a steady build of pressure deep inside him, behind his cock, beating in time with the pulse of Tony’s fingers. He felt loose and open, more open than he had ever been, and he wanted to be filled. Needed it.
At this point, he probably knew about as much as they did, though Bruce had stopped responding to what he’d started calling, ‘Tony’s Helpful Medical Hints Volume 3,’ somewhere around the memo on proper airway elevation.  At least Steve was breathing on his own now, which was something.  Not much, since breathing was automatic, but it was something.  His organs were healing.  He was getting better.  Improving. Improvement was important.  That’s what all the doctors kept saying.  These were good signs.
Tony followed Steve down the stairs and out the door to the street. It was that almost-night time when the streetlights were just flickering on, neon signs burning in shop windows, and everything seemed a bit too impatient for the day to end. He hunched his coat around his shoulders, and kept his head down to watch for the inevitable deeper-than-it-looks puddle that mocked the city's futile attempts at drainage.
“Tony?” Steve said with a frown.  “You sure you’re okay with this? We can go home and try this another day, if you want.   I shouldn’t have sprung it on you.  I wasn’t sure if we’d have enough time with the shopping, and I thought…well, I thought you’d be excited.  Like with the birthday thing.  That you’d like it.”
, Steve thought, suddenly exaltant. Yes, Tony. Just for you. He couldn’t say that, of course, not with the gag in his mouth, so, slowly, deliberately, he turned his head ever so slightly. He could just see the dark shape of Tony’s head out of the corner of his eye, and the resultant strain on his nipple sent a stabbing pain through his gut and down his cock, but it was worth it. He felt Tony look up at him. Felt the warm pleasure there. The burst of pride. Felt it like sinking into a warm bath, in the prickling of his skin, the loosening of his limbs, the way his mind gave way to some primordial sense of safety.
They rode the rest of the way in relative silence, though Happy occasionally punctuated it with comments about the other drivers, the interminable road construction and how Google maps once tried to kill him by giving him a route through Buchanan Street down in San Diego, which involved the rather dubious prospect of driving across a gaping chasm of death.  ‘
“About your sin-fueled epiphany?  ‘Course not. Though, I’m going to randomly laugh about it, and she’s going to think I’ve lost my mind.  Worth it, though,” Bucky said, walking over to the elevator and pushing the button.
“Thaaaaaaat is…definitely true,” Tony acknowledged carefully.  “But, to be fair, the same could be said of a lot of seemingly harmless tech.  Trust me.  Give me a screwdriver and some duct tape, and I could weaponize that iPad into something far more sinister than a glorified storage-eating kid-occupier,” Tony argued.  “Hard to stop that kind of thing.”
Tony’s tongue darted out and traced the seam of Steve’s mouth, then delved inside, flicking and curling against Steve’s own, sliding along the edge of Steve’s tongue, in and out, then swirling around and around, and drawing Steve into his own mouth with a soft groan.  The hand in Steve’s hair rubbed encouragingly as Tony’s mouth angled against Steve’s.  Steve may not have done this before, but Tony obviously had.  He was all skill and heat and soft movements that sent shivers wracking through Steve, centering on the tip of his cock.  The kiss shifted, deepened.  Steve ground his hips against Tony’s and felt the answering thrust of Tony’s cock sliding next to his own between them.  Steve moaned into Tony’s mouth, a wet, breathy sound, and Tony nipped his bottom lip, then sucked at it, before licking his tongue across the mark.
“Where did you get that?” Steve asked, frowning.  “I thought…”
“I missed a lot,” Steve replied flatly.  He looked down at where his hands were fisted on his thighs.  I missed a lot.  That was how Tony said things that were true and not the truth, he thought, a frown stretching over his face.
“There are no more Alien movies,” Tony said dully.  The place where Steve’s thumb touched was throbbing and warm, like a brand.  He wanted to touch it, but forced himself to keep his arms at his side.
“Take 18,” Steve said, nodding at the green highway signs.  “There are some nice views.  You’ll like it.”
“No, I mean it.  Really, it does.  Well,” Steve amended almost apologetically.  “Okay, your clean energy project—I read in the paper you were here looking at property out in the desert for it--the kind of power you’re talking about generating…you have to know that most of that can be weaponized, even if it isn’t by you,” Steve pointed out.
“Sitting around, and waiting to pleasure your King?” Tony finished for him.  “Yes,” Tony said, drawing out the word.  “Such a difficult life.   Untold luxuries and amusements at your fingertips.  How terrible for you.  I see that now,” he teased, eyes bright and dancing with the firelight.  “I shall see that you have all the thankless tasks that you desire, then.  Old ledgers to read.  Stacks of them!  How is your penmanship?  You can transcribe the treatises the moths seem to like best.  I’ll ask Pepper if she has some silver that needs polishing.  How are your, er…polishing skills?  Do you know how to rub just so?  Very delicate business, that.  Wouldn’t want to do it too hard.  Or too softly.  Takes a fine hand to…get that just right.  Perhaps, when you’ve had a bit more practice…work your way up, so to speak.”
, what it did was, it kind of made me see some things that I hadn’t seen before, I guess,” Steve continued, ignoring Bucky’s jibe.  “And maybe get a better idea of what I wanted.  Basically,” he sucked in a breath, “I think my boyfriend might be a dick,” he finished, drawing a shaky breath.  “Wow, that’s.  That’s the first time I’ve said it out loud.”
“I know. I know, you said that. So. So, no worries, right?” Tony replied, blinking into the fluorescent halo of light around Steve.  “I’m just—I’m being—It’s stupid, alright?  Forget it, okay? Forget it.”
“That—no,” Tony choked out, jerking back and dropping his hands from Steve.  “You are mistaken.”
“I completely understand,” Steve replied without dropping his gaze from where it was locked on Howard, who had to top off his drink to give himself an excuse to lower his eyes.  There as a sharp edge to his voice.  A warning, Tony thought.  He knew about those warnings, too. This one wasn’t directed at him, but he could still hear it.
“Fuck, fuck, Steve, don’t…let me get you…” Tony ground out, working his fingers harder now.
“Happy, please make sure you accelerate to exactly 88 miles per hour at the precise moment the lightning strikes the tower,” Tony muttered half under his breath.
“I take it you haven't seen this before?” Mitch asked.
“Okay,” Steve replied in a dull, flat tone.
“Not that I don’t appreciate the whole shovel talk thing you have going, but I swear, the last thing I ever want to do is hurt him,” Tony told him, voice laced with a vehemence he hadn’t really intended, but couldn’t quite manage to keep out.
“Huh.  That does seem to be a bit of a pickle, doesn’t it?” Steve asked, then broke into a wide grin.
The alien stroked his hand through Tony’s hair again, then traced a finger down Tony’s forehead, over his nose and mouth, through the bristles of his goatee, all the way down the column of his throat and chest to the reactor, then back up the same path.  The cylinder around his cock pulled and stroked again, making Tony’s insides light up. Need swelled within him, hot and pulsing. He could feel his balls draw up, tight and straining with fullness. The alien watched him intently, his blue gaze falling heavily on Tony, sending warmth flickering across his skin that had nothing to do with the bubbalicious blanket this time.
Sometime during those years, the mountain fell dark and silent, though Steve would find himself gazing up at it during the night sometimes, and sometimes, before he drifted off to sleep, a strange image would fill his head. Drops of bright red against the snow, a nighthawk crying in the distance, and a dazzling blue light that filled his mind and pushed everything else away.
“I hate to interrupt. Well, actually, I don’t—“ Goon Number One tried.
“From Fury. Though you know who Fury was hearing it from, so,” Bucky replied with a shrug. He picked up the water bag and took a long drink, then held it over his head and let some of the liquid slosh over his head, running a hand over his face and through his hair to wipe away the cool water. “Gods, I hate it here. It’s too fucking hot to think,” Bucky continued, casting a reproachful grimace at Steve, as if the heat itself was Steve’s doing. “Steve, mission’s over. The Ten Rings are all but wiped out. Their leaders are dead and the rest of the little bastards are either dead or trying to find their way out the other side of this hellhole and wishing they were. But, we’re still here, chasing ghosts and blowing up more rocks. Now, I like blowing up rocks, don’t get me wrong. Not as much as your betrothed does, but I like it. But, we’re not accomplishing much other than making smaller rocks.”
As much as he enjoyed kissing, the best part was knowing that his partner was enjoying what they were doing, too, and Tony seemed to pretty much enjoy everything.  Steve could almost feel anxiety slowly dripping off of him at Tony’s enthusiastic response, and he relaxed into it, letting himself relish the moment for once without worrying that he was going to do something wrong in the next instant.
for once in his life. Of course he hadn’t done that. When did he ever? That wasn’t fair, he knew that, but God-dammit, he wasn’t in the mood for fair. He wanted to shake him. To shake someone. But he couldn’t, because they were celebrating. They’d
Tony looked again at the closed door, the color coded letters on the wall next it a rainbow equivalent of ‘we don’t know what the fuck we’re dealing with.’  None of that explained why his first reaction to hearing Steve had lost his memories was so damn selfish.  Why did he care if Cap remembered their little trysts?   They hadn’t meant anything.  That much was clear enough, even for someone as emotionally blind as Tony to see.  Hell, they barely even liked each other most of the time, always waiting for something to set one or the other off, and usually managing to find it.  That wasn’t entirely fair, he knew, but it felt like something that should be true, too familiar and expected to simply let go of just because…just because sometimes Steve made him laugh out loud until he lost his breath and sometimes he looked at a problem in a way Tony hadn’t considered, not that he would admit that, but still.  He rubbed metal fingers lightly over his scalp, massaging absently at his temples.  It didn’t matter, anyway. They were done.  Now, more so than ever, he supposed.  The least he could do was help Steve deal with this crap as best he could.  He owed him that much.
“All done,” Tony said, setting his phone down on the dining table. “Sorry about that. I had a thought while we were flying back that I wanted to get down.”
It wasn’t as if a week was even that long of a time.  Not really.  Steve had been gone for longer stretches.  Except...except they’d kissed now, Tony thought, absently stroking his fingers over the back of his neck, and…and.  And what?  Steve should just…tell the bad guys that, Tony thought with a self-deprecating huff.  Surrender evildoers, my Omega is horny!  Yeah, so, probably not going to be Steve’s go-to strategy.
“Steve-Steve-Steve,” Tony was chanting and Steve felt a more insistent tugging at his hair, so he pulled back enough to mouth the head and suckle, lightly at first, then hollowing his cheeks to apply a harder suction, earning a shout from Tony, before swallowing the length down again and releasing his grip on Tony’s hips as the other man lost control enough to thrust in hard, rapid strokes against the back of his throat.  Steve felt the warm, salty rush spill down the back of his throat as Tony came, hips jerking a couple final times as Steve pulled off enough to swallow around Tony’s shaft before finally releasing it as it went slack.  He couldn’t help running his cheek along the side again, placing a light kiss as he went.  He felt Tony go boneless and slump over, head resting on Steve’s shoulder.
“I think I look forward to it,” Tony said with a grin.
“Hmmm…” Steve said laughing a bit as he stood, Tony sort of flopping loosely against his chest, holding onto his arms and burying his face against Steve’s neck.  Tony hung there for a moment before moving his hands to lift Steve’s shirt off as Steve raised his arms to help.  Tony was nudging him back to the bed, hands skittering across Steve’s chest, rough thumbs lightly grazing across Steve’s nipples, making them pebble into hard nubs.  Tony’s mouth worked its way down to the hollow of Steve’s throat, then light kisses were pressed against his chest before Tony pressed his lips against Steve’s nipple, not taking in his mouth just yet, just working it with his lips, running them back and forth across it, teasing, causing Steve to suck in a sharp breath as he lay back on the bed, Tony following him down.
“Always a White Knight, then, huh?” Tony prodded, eyeing Steve thoughtfully.
“Welcome,” the man greeted him as Steve approached. He seemed a bit more chipper than his predecessor, though Steve thought it best not to mention that. “Room Six, I presume?” Steve nodded. “Tap here to authorize the transaction.”
“You have hands, you know.  Technically, I think that’s cheating,” Steve grinned.  It snorted at him, then disappeared under the water for a moment, before its eyes resurfaced, bobbing the waves just out of arm’s reach.
“You don’t have to do this, you know,” Steve said, barely audible over the wind and constant traffic noise.  “You can do so much. Anything you put your mind to.  You should be…” he stopped, the words catching in his throat.
“Eiffel Tower.  Remember, lots of, you know, with the…marriage thing…and you have the—the liking thing, happening, so that’s…” Ms. Potts said, bouncing her head back and forth with a vaguely uncomfortable look.  “Okay, so, that’s good. You two are good.  I’ll just—you know, I’m going to go.  James, I’ll ride down with you.”
“No,” Tony replied, then grimaced at Steve’s pointed look. “No, okay?  It’s nothing. Seriously. Nothing. Just lawyer stuff. They’ll sort it out.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll bet. I”ll be nice, okay?”  Brock waved him off with a slight laugh, but seemed to give in the point, if somewhat begrudgingly.  “Speaking of plans and all… how long do you reckon it’ll take for the bank to clear the check?” Brock asked.
. Behind those walls Tony put around him like armor.  He wanted to tear them down and see what was there.
“Compared to this, yeah.  But, it’s nice.  I like it.  Homey, I guess.  I have my garage.  For my projects.  Ah, robots, mostly.  Some, I mean.  Other stuff, too, but…robots,” Tony said, making it almost a question.  His face squished up in annoyance with himself.  He didn’t mean to do that.  It was still hard, though, especially with his mom.  The fun just wasn’t in shocking and disappointing her the way it was in undermining everything Howard hoped would happen to him.   “The stuff with Professor Thorne at Caltech.  That’s mostly just looking over the data from…from a telescope, ah, thing.”
great deal richer than those you’re trying to rule rather than just a great deal richer. Gives them delusions of grandeur, if you’re not. They start believing they should have more of a say than they do, and Rand does like to use his sway with the banking guild to try to twist my arm from time to time.  Taxes and being landlocked. That’s what keeps him in line. Taxes are what he spent half the visit bending my ear about. You’d think he was nearly bankrupt, not sitting on a literal goldmine he won’t tap because it would drive the prices down,” Tony sighed.
“I know you would.  Then, you shall have them,” Tony promised, taking Steve’s cock firmly in his hand.  His mouth found Steve’s again, nudging Steve’s lips apart so his tongue could slip inside. Tony’s tongue, soft and wet, heating his mouth, his hand holding Steve’s cock, it was all Steve could think about, and then, without warning, Steve felt the rough glide of the sponge across his cock where Tony held it beneath the water.  A groan fell from Steve’s lips, caught by Tony’s mouth as it slanted over his.  Another stroke of the sponge, harder this time, up and down the sensitive skin of Steve’s shaft, around the head, and again, along the underside where his cock strained and bulged.
Tony stopped the motion before the—what was it this time?  Wrench, he noticed, looking down at his hand.  Before the wrench hit the edge of the workstation again, where it was clanging out a sharp, staccatoed echo in the garage.
“Please,” Steve gasped.
“Mom’s Cabinet of Curiosities.  All her Capidomonte she orders from TV, awards the ladies who lunch give each other, that kind of crap,” Tony told him listlessly.  He should go to his room.  He wanted to go to his room.  Or his garage.  Or anywhere that wasn’t right here, listening to this.
He was proud that he managed to get anything out, though his voice was shaking.  Anger, righteous and hot, coursed through him. Regret soured in his stomach like curdled milk.  Distantly, like something remembered from a dream, Steve could almost feel his cheek scraping against brick, blood rushing down his throat, someone shouting fairy at him so loudly into his ear that it seemed to ring like a bell in his head, the man’s breath hot and heavy and stinking of drink.  Bucky had knocked the guy on his ass, gotten Steve patched up back at his place so Steve’s Ma wouldn’t see the worst of it, all the while just keeping a grim silence between them that they never broke, not once, even years later.
“Yes,” Steve replied, because it was true.
“You’re really doing this,” Steve said with a slight shake of his head.  He gave Tony a quick, studied look, then dropped his gaze and stuck the key into the doorknob, this time without a problem, Tony noticed.
“See?” Ty said, raising his head up to the other two men.
“How am I? I’m not great, Tony.  Not great at all.  What in the world is going on?” Pepper asked, her voice calming slightly now that Tony had finally managed a reply, nonsensical as it was.  “Why is Fury freaking out?  What is this about some Captain?”
Steve was fairly sure ‘excellent choice’ was a euphemism for ‘really, really expensive,’ but he didn’t ask.  He probably wouldn’t be able to drink it if he knew the cost.  Looking across the table at Tony, he balanced his arms on the table and leaned back against the purple couch, studying the man for a moment.
“It wasn’t your fault, either, Tony,” Steve said quietly, doing that Vulcan mind-meld thing Steve sometimes did with him.  “You make weapons, which help keep our soldiers safe.  You don’t make decisions about whether to fight or who to fight.  You’re not responsible for every terrorist who ever went shopping on the black market.”
The cabin was silent, though Tony’s bedroom door was closed.  Steve figured he must be in his garage.  He gathered up one of the styrofoam boxes from the deli and put Tony’s socks (not the space socks, those he tucked in his drawer next to the partially finished drawing), detergent, and soaps in a brown paper bag, then headed across the small front yard towards the garage.
“How did you see my record?” Steve demanded, pushing himself up on his elbows.
“Did you manage to catch any this time?” Steve asked with forced joviality.
“That sounds delightful,” Tony said mildly, watching Steve as he approached with a spark of amusement in his eye.  “There is nothing I love more than watching my soldiers fight for my entertainment. In fact, I will provide a special reward for the champion, how about?   What say you? Should the finest soldier earn a boon for his performance?” Tony asked. “The Raj’Inama agrees with me,” Tony announced. “You’ve no idea what a rarity that is, so let us accept it and call the matter settled,” Tony said, earning a slightly confused look from Lord Rand, which he quickly hid behind an agreeable smile.
Tony looked at the card.  Blinked, then grinned.
“I think I’d like your friends,” Murdock said, sounding oddly gleeful about the whole prospect.
“Yeah, well, I’m not so happy about dying, either, big guy,” Tony said.  “Want to let me up from here and let me spend my final days taking your ship apart?  God, I’d love to get my hands on--oh, okay, we’re doing the touching thing again, well, that’s--kind of wish you would just let me--nnnggghhhh,” Tony husked out as his eyes fluttered shut when the alien grasped the sides of his face again and those smooth, long fingers pressed into his skin.
“Okay?” Tony repeated.  Rogers pushed the chair back and stood up, pulling at the bottom of his dress uniform jacket, which made the medals shake across his chest.  “So, that’s it.  Just like that.  We’re…you’re…and I’m…”
He had to go back, of course.  He was healer, and the man was still in his care.  Besides, no one else was allowed near him, so it fell to Anto.  That was Tyber’s rule, probably something he imagined as a punishment, which Anto had actually relished, at least until now.  He had liked having the man to himself. He hadn’t realized quite how much until the prospect of the man leaving coupled with the knowledge that the man was so disgusted by him that he wouldn’t even use him when he had such a great need left Anto feeling like he could barely move, his limbs were so heavy, as he slowly walked back towards his once-secret cave the next morning.
It was pointed, snappish and bristling with righteous anger, sending Tony mentally reeling from the force of it.   He knew Steve hadn’t meant it that way, but Tony caught himself tapping at the reactor in his chest anyway, like some kind of Freudian compulsion, and had to force his hand to his side.
“Forget you--what is wrong with you? Who just says that?
“Why is her picture a thing of salt?” Steve asked with a confused frown.
“Here, you got the tassel on wrong,” Rhodey said with a sigh, reaching around to move the tassel hang on the right side.
“Of course, Your Highness, I completely understand your eagerness,” Zola replied with an oily, sycophantic smoothness.
“College classes?” Steve asked.
The crowd finally thinned as their party approached the city wall, a tall, twisting structure of thick limestone blocks that circled the city.  Steeply angled to prevent siege towers from directly abutting it, the wall was wide enough for four horses to pull carts abreast and easily as high as six men.  Curved towers, harder to climb or lay siege engines against, crowned it at various points, with battlemented terraces on their tops.
“That’s true.  Implying to Steve that he probably couldn’t handle this given his delicate condition was definitely the way to get him not to do it,” Natasha observed evenly.  “Shocking that your strategy didn’t work.”
“Yeah?” Tony husked out. “Yeah, me too.”
Steve frowned, but reached over and pulled the tube of lube out of the bedside drawer.  “Do you want to, or should I…”
“Howard,” Maria said, but Steve could hear the rote tone in her voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Imploded might not technically be correct, Tony had time to think somewhat blearily, but it seemed to fit pretty well. The door slammed open and rebounded off the wall behind it, sending the dartboard careening to the ground and leaving it hanging limply by one hinge at the top.  The whole room seemed to jump at the same time.  Dan plastered himself against the wall, arms flailing, nearly knocking over the lamp.  Preston jerked away and grabbed at the buckle of his pants with a bitten-off curse.  Ty’s whole body startled, one knee knocking into the side of Tony’s head.  Tony reached up to rub at his temple and shot Ty what he hoped was an annoyed look.
“He had a degree in Engineering, you know?” Steve told him.  “Actually worked for the Water & Sewers Department out in California for a bit.”
“God, I think you might be more fucked up than I am. Which, believe me, would be an accomplishment,” Tony muttered.  “Okay, I’ll bite.  Why is getting your ass kicked your favorite memory?”
We’ll see, Tony thought.  He sank down to one knee and pressed his thumb to the fingerprint pad on the lock.  A moment later, the case’s locks clicked open, and he pushed open the small case that held the helmet.  Unseeing eyes stared up at him, framed by red and gold.  He picked it up and held it for a moment, wondering what Steve would think.  Would he find it as beautiful as Tony did?  Would he see echo of the robot he had once drawn for Tony in it?  He draws the things he loves, Tony reminded himself again, setting the helmet down in the padded case.
“Wait, stop,” Tony ordered, sitting up abruptly.  “Go back.”  He stared up at the screen, where someone had captured a picture of Iron Man clutching a screaming, red-faced, brassed-off baby in one hand, holding the shield over him with the other while part of a building disintegrated around them courtesy of whatever power it was Loki conjured to get back to Asgard.
Putting aside Obie’s connections to a terrorist organization and attempts to have Tony assassinated, the man wasn’t wrong about the difficulties transitioning the company.  It was going to be painful, though Tony knew it would ultimately be worth it.  To do something that actually made the world better, safer in ways that actually solved the problems that laid the foundations for war and strife and brought people like Steve home before he had to learn how to count by sevens.
“So, fun, then?  Everyone made you feel welcome?” Steve continued. Steve glanced at him with a question in his gaze, then looked over at the Agents and nodded, which sent them into deep fits of concentration over whatever it was on their tablets
“I think so.  Don’t tell Tony,” Steve mumbled, his eyes drifting closed.  “He saved us.”
“It does seem that way,” Steve agreed, glancing over his shoulder again at the boy.
, Steve thought viciously, hating himself, hating Tony, hating all of this. He watched Tony, waiting. Had it only been moments ago that everything seemed right? He could feel his throat tighten with an invisible noose, his eyes stinging, because this was it, wasn’t it? This was it. It could not hold, this thing between them.
“I want to go,” Steve said, drawing Tony’s gaze to his.  He could see Tony visibly relax, face going soft, nodding and tapping at the table, the way he did when he didn’t want to speak whatever was in his head, but couldn’t quite contain the—the
Something special for tonight, Steve thought again, then sighed and smiled lightly at Cam.
The world went hazy and soft at the edges. He could still hear noises in the room.  The steady beeping of the machines.  Friday’s mechanical voice. Bruce’s deeper tone.  But, they were distant, muted, as if he was on the bottom of a pool looking up.  Steve blinked once, slowly, then everything went dark.
Bruce sighed.  “I know. I wish I could be more help, you know I know.  Steve--I really do,” he added, glancing back at Steve.
“Yes?” Steve asked.
“Thank you,” Steve said.  Eram nodded politely and left, leaving Cam and Steve alone.
“It’s a shame you haven’t given this much thought,” Steve observed mildly.  Tony opened his mouth to say something, snapped it shut, and then caught the teasing gleam in Steve’s eye.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony said flatly, stopping just shy of the door. “Like I said, I’m good. Just need to get to this SI thing.”
concussed, so cut me some slack.  But, yeah.  You and me.  We could do this. And, if you haven’t noticed, you’re kind of my everything, too.  If this is something you feel you have to do, I want to be a part of it. Whatever that means.”
Someone had crossed out part of the emergency exit sign so that it helpfully instructed passengers to ‘Lift to open. Push out bottom.  Do not block. Alarm will sound.’   Tony nudged Steve’s shoulder and nodded his head at it with a smirk.
“Then what is this?” Steve demanded, probably reasonably, but the vaguely accusatory tone sent pinpricks down Tony's spine. Tony rubbed a hand over his temples and let his eyes fall shut for a moment, trying to clear his head, but all he saw were words that made no sense, just a discordant mess of letters and photos and whys that probably had an answer, just not the one he wanted.
“That is a pile of sand,” Tony observed.  “You have made a sand mound.  That is not even remotely anything like a castle or any other type of ‘fortification.’”
“All except Thor, Sir, who has not returned from Asgard as yet,” JARVIS informed him.  “Ms. Romanov said to tell you that Ms. Potts will be dropping by tomorrow afternoon and wishes to speak with you.”
It’s fine.
“He’s Tony Stark, so, you know, you’d
“You would not allow it? For any of them?” Steve asked, frowning as he recalled the words of the other concubines in the baths that day.  His voice sounded tired.  Weary.  But, his cheek was warm in Tony’s hand.  One of Tony’s fingers was stroking along Steve’s jaw, almost absently. He leaned in a bit to the pressure, the solidity of it, letting it ground him like an anchor dragging along the ocean floor, keeping him from drifting. A surge of heat pooled just below his stomach.  How had he gone so long without this feeling?  He had no idea.  But, he was here now, and Tony was listening, really, truly listening, though Steve supposed this was the first time Steve had really and truly spoken.
He stared, stunned, mouth agape, at the scene in front of his eyes. It was difficult to comprehend so much strangeness at once.  Being here instead of in his bed.  This place, in the maw of the mountain where it seemed impossible that it should be. That
“The doctors cleared me for duty right before Tony’s—uh—misunderstanding,” Steve replied, climbing back on the bed to sit next to Tony.
“I didn’t exactly ask you to visit,” Tony pointed out, pulling out one of the kitchen chairs and sitting down to watch Jarvis putter around the kitchen.
“Good,” Tony nodded.  “Then, it is settled.”  Steve glanced away, a cold weight falling into the pit of his stomach.
.  As in, the absence of nothing, which--which he would take. Maybe he shouldn’t, but he couldn’t seem to help himself from clinging to the whole idea of it.  Of it being something. Meaning something.
“The turtle’s face.  Just say it,” Kirk said with a beleaguered sigh, though he gamely sat down. “My life is weird. Sorry Raphael.   You were always my favorite.  Guess this was inevitable.  Okay.  What now?”
“This? Fucking hell. This is what I was right about?” Tony shouted, eyeing the ceiling, looking for commiseration or dispensation, he wasn't sure which, while Steve gave him a confused, slightly concerned look. “Steve. I do not need time to think about this. I need you to...to...”
Tony’s heart was pounding out a staccato beat in his chest, and he could feel his muscles go loose and quavering, no matter how much he told himself to calm down, nothing was happening, quit being like this.  It wasn’t rational, and he hated that, the idea that fear could so quickly overrule higher brain function, but here he was, shifting to flight mode like he was a Wright brother.
But Stane wasn’t finished, not by a longshot.  “How do you suppose it would go over with the Board to find out that Tony’s paying a certain high-priced agency for the pleasure of your company every night, Steve?  Not that I blame him, mind you.  Hard for investors to trust someone who pays for it with billions of dollars, you know.  And what would the Board think if they knew that Tony’s latest little obsession was on the advice of his hooker?”  Stane asked, seemingly idly wondering, as if the concern had just occurred to him.  “After Afghanistan…well, you can imagine how that would look.  Concern has already been raised about his mental condition…totally understandable after what happened, of course…but this?  Well, this doesn’t look good, Steve.  Surely you can see that?  It would be a shame if the Board felt it necessary to remove him, after all he has accomplished.  At least, until recently.”
“You love an idea.  But, ideas do not fill your belly, Raj’Inama,” Cam protested.  “So, I could be free to be hungry anywhere in the world that I wished?  I could be free to huddle in some dirt hut out on the steppes burning donkey dung because I have no wood?  Free to scrape together what coin I can come by, working all day for the kind of merchant who cannot afford slaves?  Why would I want this
.  There was Steve.  Just his name reverberated with a cascade of possibilities that Tony didn’t quite want to name, but sprang to his mind anyway.  Love, happiness, a future,
“I enjoyed it, too,” Tony said, his voice low and husky, like he was sharing a secret. Steve felt the words in a rush of liquid heat deep inside him, his limbs going loose and boneless. Tony cleared his throat, and Steve’s mind seemed to clear at the sound, too. “And today, the ride was not too difficult? I thought of having you and Cam wait back with Matt, but… I admit, I wanted your company.”
“Let me make some coffee.  There’s still dessert to finish.  Bring your stuff over here.  I don’t know how much help I’ll be, but I can listen,” Steve suggested.
“You didn’t leave,” Tony said.
“Yeah, I kinda got that first part.   Tony Stark, huh?  Wow.  Hey, nice to meet you both,” Wilson said, extending a hand to shake first Tony’s, then Rhodey’s.  “You, ah, you know Steve from the Army?”
“And so, then, I said, ‘Do you not think I know what the Raj’Inama needs? The King
“Well, then.  Guess you’d better be here in the morning,” Barnes replied evenly, giving Tony a long, vaguely threatening look.
“That one is going in the retailers’ promotional packet,” she laughed.  “You can’t buy this kind of publicity.”
Tony held the shield up and looked at his reflection again for a long moment.  He glanced down at the ring of silvery-grey metal around the fourth finger of his left hand where it was splayed against the back of the shield.  The heartline. Vena Amoris. That’s why the Bonding ring goes there. It was one of those things, like the rib story, that wasn’t literally true, but felt true.
,” Anthony replied.
“Fifty bucks says it’s paints,” Barnes smirked up at Tony from his place on the sofa, eating Tony’s food and drinking Tony’s beer and being obnoxiously observant.
“No idea what you mean,” Tony replied through clenched teeth, a flash of annoyance sparking through him.  He honestly just…wanted this to not get screwed up, just this one thing.  Cap would come in, freshly showered from his run, and Tony would have coffee ready and maybe he could whip up an omelet or, you know, grab Steve and take him someplace where Tony could pay someone to make an omelet that was actually edible, whatever.
No—that. That wasn’t what he’d meant to think.  Which, okay, that didn’t make any sense, either.  Crap.  Stop it, brain.  Eat your eggs.
Tony turned and looked behind him, then nodded at his guards.  The door to Steve’s carriage swung open, and Cam hopped out. Steve followed.  He walked slowly over to where Tony waited, keenly aware of the stares, as much as people tried to avert their gazes.  Tony’s eyes were on him, though, and that steadied him as much as anything.
“I’m freaking out on the inside.  Believe me. But, when Steve shows up, if I’m upset, then…I think bad stuff will happen. Worse stuff.  Look, Steve and Coulson will fix this, it’ll be fine, I swear,” Tony promised.
What did that even mean?  What was so loud in Steve’s head that he needed this to find quiet in taking care of Tony?  The car, dishsoap, his garage, a visit from his butler.  Tony supposed that was all somehow wrapped up together in Steve’s mind, filed under Taking Care of Tony, Vol. 1.
“Hey.  You’re doing that on purpose.  That Omega mind trick thing.  Don’t think I don’t know what you’re up to, trying to manipulate me like that.  It’s totally unfair, by the way,” Tony accused.
“He’s going to stop and pick up lunch on his way back from SHIELD,” Tony told Jarvis with more confidence than he felt.  “I’m…glad you came, Jarvis.  I know I’ve been terrible at keeping in touch.   Mom’s on my case about visiting, but…I just…haven’t.  Sorry.  I’m an asshole.”
Reboot, he thought. Start in safe mode.
“This,” Tony said, tracing his thumb through the fringe of gold that covered Steve’s face.  “This is meant to amuse me, yes?” Tony asked, eyes dancing with delight.  Steve felt his face warm, but couldn’t help the answering smile that formed under the veil and lit his own eyes, making Tony grin in return.
“There are many other ways to form alliances,” Tony shrugged. He’s thought about this, Steve realized with a surprised start that stabbed through his chest until it hurt. He’s thought about this a lot.
“Terrible. Awful.  Grossly irresponsible of me to have missed, take your pick,” Tony acknowledged with a flat grimace.
“Truth is…truth is, I have been wanting to get this big, gorgeous cock of yours in me since I saw you up on stage,” Tony replied.
“Like I said, it was just a couple of sentences. Not much to go on, I know,” Bruce replied with a slight shrug of his shoulders. “Tony,” he began, then shut his mouth and wiped a hand over the grimace that was forming. “What’s this about? Really? Is something up with Steve?”
“Got some rest,” Steve told him. “Hey, ah. Thanks for… what you said. About… the, ah, the place. I know you arranged the credits and all. You didn’t need to do that.”
“Despite what you may have heard, I’m not asking just to hear myself talk,” Stark said.
He knew he should be dealing with this better.  He’d seen it before, after all.  Of course, that had led to a murder-bot with a God complex.  How that vision had ever frightened him seemed impossible to understand now, faced with the in living color version.  This was a thousand times worse.  That had been the end of the world, but this was the world falling apart, tearing at the seams, piece by piece.  That had been a fight.  This…this was a prayer, a plea coursing through his veins, asking something he didn’t believe in to intercede when he had nothing of any value to offer in trade.  It was the powerlessness of it, he realized, the utter helplessness, that left him reeling.  He held the only things he could offer that might help in his hands, the basest part of himself that had no business standing between Steve and death.
“I’m sorry. I don’t...I don’t seem to remember it,” Steve admitted.
This prompt was for Tony being surprised that Steve would want to bottom.  Enjoy your smut.
“Apparently, he is a friend to the young Lord Rand, who was unaware of…the circumstances of our acquaintance, let us say,” Tony replied, a bite to each of the words.  “Ty applied for the tourney, and he knew no reason to disallow it. He is, after all, a knight and a noble,” Tony huffed out a bitter laugh. “Lord Rand offered to withdraw the invitation, of course, but if I agreed to that, then it would obviously be because his presence bothers me, and I refuse to give Ty that satisfaction.”
of things, Tony thought dreamily as he stared at the back of the bedroom door where someone had hung a dart board and one of those inspirational posters where the eagle told you how to be a good person.
He climbed onto one of the tables and lay down on his back, letting Cam rub the scraper over his skin, then wipe him down, while other attendants took special care of his hands and feet, cleaning under the nail beds and shaping them, scrubbing and buffing until they shone.  A cloth was placed over his eyes, and water poured through his hair into the catch basin on the floor, then strong fingers massaged shampoo into his scalp, followed by more warm water to rinse.  Shaving was next, though he waved the attendants off when they made to lay the blade on his groin.  Tony did not mind that, he thought, remembering the way the King seemed to like to trail his hand down the line of hair beneath Steve’s stomach and rake his nails through the coarser hair that framed his cock.  He flipped over onto his stomach and let Cam repeat the process on his back, until he was clean and largely denuded, skin slick and gleaming with scented oils.
Steve laughed and stood up, walking over to where Tony sat at his workstation.  He always loved to watch Tony work.  It was art, in its own way, and extraordinary, no matter what you called it.  Just like Tony.
Steve stood, though his feet were leaden, and walked towards the waiting bed.  He sat down on the edge and swallowed, tasting bile as he felt the collar bob against his throat.  He had to know.  He had to know how Tony saw him.  A person or a slave.  Steve Rogers, Captain in the Army of the Unified Free States, or this creature who was here to pleasure a king.  Steve’s hand shot out and wrapped around Tony’s as he reached for the knot of the belt at Steve’s waist.
“Thanks for using the small words,” Steve replied with a half-smile tugging at his mouth.
“No!” Steve burst out, slamming a fist onto the table hard enough to send the silverware clattering against the plates.  “You can’t…you can’t know that,” Steve said harshly, his breaths coming in pants.  “Don’t say that.  Don’t count on that.  Don’t tell yourself that. If that’s what you think, that it’ll just go away, and I’ll be…I’ll be okay again, then don’t.  Because that isn’t how this works. Three months ago, a car backfired, and I dropped to the ground.  Fourth of July, I spent with headphones that Sam gave me listening to Marvin Gaye on repeat.  This may not ever change, Tony. Ever. This may be as good as I get.”
“Okay, then. If you really think this is what’s best,” Brock replied with a sigh.  “Shit,” he added, reaching for his coffee and taking a big gulp.  “Gonna need something stronger than this.”  He waved to the waitress and ordered a bourbon.  It was nine in the morning, but this was Vegas, so she didn’t even blink.
“And you, Captain,” Charles responded with a slight smile.  He had a slight British accent, the kind that has been in America long enough to be almost a memory.
“I was still and patient as you said,” Cam replied, shaking his head, “but, they are too quick.”
He could feel Steve's gaze on him, heavy and watchful, making his eyes sting at the corners, and sending a tugging, pulling sensation through his stomach that was familiar in its blinding unpleasantness. He'd been here before, the standing and waiting point, and it was always the worst part of it, that moment when anything could happen, when he didn't know quite what to expect and there was nothing for him to control, not his reactions, what he said, what he let slip out or didn't show, what gave up and what he kept to himself. It was just the freefall of waiting, searching for the bottom, because there was always a bottom, some place lower than where you thought you were, that place past the fear where there wasn't anything left but a pit of humiliation to wallow in.
“First of all, we’re not telling anyone this, ever. Except for Bucky, because I called him while you were in the bathroom and yelled what will probably be a very confusing message into his voicemail,” Steve said with a firm nod.
Tony’s voice was fierce, sharp, heating Steve’s skin like he might open his eyes to find the words branded there.  The power of being able to give Tony something like that, of having that much influence over his thoughts, of being that precious to him, it was a heady, intoxicating thing that filled Steve’s mind and made his chest expand near to bursting, or so it felt.  No one else could do this.  No one else could give Tony this. It felt exhilarating. Blood pounded through his body, his heart thumped wildly in time. He felt invincible, indomitable, like he was coming out of battle, victorious and battle-scarred, with his shield in one hand and his sword in the other.  It didn’t make sense. He was kneeling in front of a foreign king with a slave’s collar around his throat, yet he couldn’t deny the feeling.
In his pocket, Tony felt his phone buzz, alerting him to yet another text from Pepper for him to ignore.  It wasn’t that he didn’t understand her undoubtedly perfectly reasonable points about the benefits of a prepared statement and controlling the press, but he was honestly still too…too something…at Steve turning the tables on those asshats in the lobby to worry about media strategy at the moment.  He was…confused.  Perplexed.  Surprised, definitely surprised.
“Dude, you know it’s true,” Rhodey said bluntly with a raised eyebrow.
“You pictured me?  Tell me more about that,” Tony said with a teasing grin, though, and he decided to blame the champagne for it, the thought of Steve thinking about him, maybe some kind of celebrity crush or something, sent a spike of something warm low through his belly.
It took five days for the doctors to be satisfied that Steve had recovered, even though by the third day, the gash in the middle of his chest had healed to a long, thin scar, just slightly pink at the edges. The staples coming out weren’t nearly as bad as going in, but Tony held Steve’s hand, wincing as each was pulled from the skin, and this time, the doctor actually spent some time explaining to Tony what to expect.   Tony suspected he had missed a stern talking to about bedside manner, but the explanation did help calm his nerves.
“Coulson said you were having fun,” Steve chuckled, mouth tugging up at the corners.  A warm burst of pleasure bloomed in Tony’s chest at the sight.  It wasn’t relief, or at least, not entirely relief.  He hadn’t screwed up.  He hadn’t embarrassed Steve, who, come to think of it, was beaming a knowing smile at Tony.  So, relief, yeah, okay, a little, but floating above that, for the first time in God only knew when, there was pride, undiminished by fear or self-loathing, and it was such a heady rush of emotion that for a second, his vision swam and the room seemed to slant before righting itself again.  He sucked in a shaky breath and pointed at the, well, pieces of the drone.
“Hey, now, come on.  I know this isn’t exactly what we had in mind coming out here, but this is an amazing opportunity, and you’re giving it to us,” Brock told him, his voice going slightly gravelly.  “It’s gonna be
“We're going to class. Honestly, Steve, if you are having memory issues, we should really get those checked out,” Tony replied evenly. “Don't worry, you probably just hit your head falling out of the Stubborn-Ass Idiot Tree.”
“Coulson was going to text you, but didn’t want to bother you,” she said instead.
meant it to hurt, to mock, to put Steve in his place.  He had.  He wasn’t proud of it, but it was hard to lie to himself now, here, in the dark, after watching the guy have a near panic attack because he remembered what it smelled like when you burned people to ash.  Because Tony had meant it, right up until the moment it had actually accomplished its goal, and then he would have given anything in the world to take it back, to undo what he’d done, and wasn’t that just the story of his life with Steve writ large?  Fuck it up, and then try to fix it and make it worse.
“Just the B crew was left by the time we got to the camp where they were holding you.  Most everyone high-tailed it out of there as soon as you escaped and holed up in a place called Gulmira.  Using your weapons, I might add,” Rhodey informed him with an annoyed twist of his mouth.
“He’s right,” Conference Room Steve said.  “Here, you want to make him feel good, don’t you?” he asked, reaching out to guide one of Steve’s hands to Tony’s knee where it jutted out at an angle.
“Yeah, yeah, really, I’m telling you.  Like when I see something I want, I just go for it, you know?  Don’t hesitate, I say.  You want it, you make it happen, right?  Speaking of…how about we just step right in here,” he finished, pushing open the glass door to a conference room where a large, rectangular table sat with a flatscreen on the wall above with a small mini bar towards the back of the room.  “Can I, uh, get you all anything?  We’ve got, let’s see, soft drinks, water…some coffee…” Estes offered with a slight frown.
Steve watched his strange reflection being manipulated like a doll on a string in the glass, mesmerized as his limbs moved seemingly of their own accord, even as he felt Tony’s hands roaming over him.  Finally, he tore his eyes away from the strange, slow dance in the mirror and found Tony’s eyes again, twin points of light, blue now.  Were they always blue?  Steve blinked, and Tony’s eyes were dark again, his lips red against his pale skin.
Last night, Steve hadn’t been able to get the image of a frustrated robot trying desperately to clean Tony’s room out of his head. It was stupid, of course.  Even Tony’s robots probably didn’t do that, as amazing as they sounded.  The thought made him smile, though.
Tony crawled out of the car and squinted his eyes into the waning afternoon sun where it bounced off the building’s windows.  The last time he’d been here, he had been terrified.  Even the memory of it was enough to make his gut clench.
They were quiet for a moment, taking time to look him over in obvious surprise and curiosity.
Steve looked at him for a long moment. So long, Tony thought he wasn’t going to get an answer, which was maybe answer enough.
“I didn’t ask,” Tony replied, drawing out the first word.  “If I had, it would have been done in very clever, stealthy sort of way, that definitely didn’t tip you off to my incredible insecurity, which, speaking of, I should really probably sit you down when you have time that doesn’t involve preparing for an arraignment and tell you about freshman year.  Anyway—”
The final box was on the bottom shelf, pushed back against the wall, and Tony had to get down on the floor to reach it, which took this to a whole new level, he knew, because there was looking and then there was just flat-out invading someone's privacy. The box was Schrodinger's cat, both alive and dead, until he opened it, and now was the time to leave kitty the fuck alone, but curiosity and cats and all that. He curled his legs under him and pulled it out from the shelf onto the floor. Unlike the other boxes, this one had the feeling of not being regularly updated or rifled through. Storage, Tony thought, lifting the lid off, and half expecting a puff of dust in the face for his efforts.
“Well…not going to lie, it wasn’t the best few days of my life, but, you know,” Tony shrugged.  “Not deadly or anything, last I checked.”
“I feel like they’re watching us. Tom and Jerry, I mean,” Tony said, jerking his head to the right, where the two forever suspended sharks seemed to glide through infinite blue, dark eyes fixed on Steve and Tony. “It’s kind of a turn on, not going to lie.”
Really, since when did Darkwing Duck even hang out here? Tony wondered.
, Tony’s mind screamed.  Please, God, no. Not this.  Not this. Anything but this. He couldn’t handle Steve’s blood on his hands, too.  It was too much. It was all too much. Steve, Steve, God,
“Look at me,” Tony’s voice commanded loudly into his ear, and Steve’s eyes snapped open finding Tony’s steady gaze like a beacon. “This is me, making you feel this way. Me, Steve. Who loves you more than anything. I’ve got you. Give this to me, Steve. Let me, please. Please, let me.”
“I have never seen a real tourney before,” Cam announced.  “What events will they have? What will you award the winner?  Do you think someone will die?”
“There you are,” Steve said.  “Thought you’d gotten lost.” Steve still worried, sometimes, Tony knew, and he had to admit, it was a little endearing.
,” Steve thought.
“I don’t know, man, based on what I saw on Twitter this morning, that might help,” Rhodey argued. “Where is your other hand even at in this one?”
Tony lifted his eyes to Steve’s, feeling them burn. To bright, he thought.  The sun.  It’s too bright.  It wasn’t, he knew, but it felt that way.  Everything that wasn’t dark felt too bright.
“Ah—I—“ Tony stuttered.  “Let me just—I need to get my phone and—and the speaker.  Hang on.  I’ll just--”   he jerked his head towards the garage, and Steve nodded, letting go of Tony’s hand.  Tony gave Steve a hesitant look, then turned and stumbled off to the garage, trying to force himself to walk at a semi-normal pace.  He punched his code into the door and pushed it open.  He grabbed his phone and the speaker and cord off his workstation desk, checking the power supply long enough to be sure it was fully charged, then hurried back to the door.  Standing in the threshold, he could see Steve illuminated by the bulb that glowed above the front door and the partial moon that shone above.
Fumbling, fingers suddenly feeling huge and clumsy, Steve reached for his belt and made quick work of his fly, shoving his pants down to his knees and letting his cock spring free. He braced one forearm against the wall and stroked his cock a few times, slicking it up until it glistened. Pre-cum leaked onto his hand, and he spread that around, too. In front of him, the hole waited, open and ready and his to use.
“I—I don’t know what…I’d—I’d never let you…I’d always make the best decision I could for you,” Steve objected before Tony had even finished speaking.  “Of course, I would. I’d never---I would want what’s best for you, but sometimes, you might not understand or might be too close to the situation.  Maybe that’s what this woman, maybe she thought she was a burden or--or…but, you wouldn’t be, you…I would take care of you.  That’s what…” Steve rushed out, words nearly hopping over each other in their hurry to be said.
He’d only taken it when the pain got so bad he was unable to sleep, when he couldn’t close his mind to it and the other thoughts that followed on its heels, and no one, save perhaps Bucky, who knew too much anyway, would know how much he sometimes needed the dark quiet that emptied his mind when he took it. For reasons he couldn’t quite explain, he did not want word of his…discomfort…to reach Tony, as word of anything to do with him seemed to manage to do, if Tony’s letters were any indication. Hell, he’d barely had the wound from Raza’s blade bandaged before Redwing was pecking at his hand with Tony’s letter demanding to know what was going on and how Steve fared.
“I—I don’t want to
“Are you coming back to the Tower?” she asked.
Well.  Maybe Tony had.  Or would have. Maybe.  If things had been different.
“Birds,” Cam repeated and gave a shudder.  “On your head.”
“Romotive Group.   He fired that Estes guy,” Steve said.
“The Mr. Softee shirt was not because of your love of ice cream,” Steve reminded him, earning a slight shake of Tony’s head in return.  “What’s for dinner?”
Steve had stopped at the landing on the bottom of the steps, mouth agape as he stared at the coin Rhodes was holding.  On the other side, opposite the ancient sigil, was a star.  A star that had streaked across the night sky after the near-destruction of Tony’s people all those generations ago, and one they had followed, until it led them here.  It seemed impossible, and yet, he knew in his bones that it was the star that had brought the metal that made his shield. The star shield.  Another tremor ran through him, this time, colder and more pronounced.  For a moment, he could almost see something, some truth, as if out of the corner of his eye, though he was sure if he looked, it would terrify him.  He looked up at Rhodes instead, though said nothing.  What could he say?
“You have got to be kidding me,” Pepper intoned in frustration.
“I can’t just—just quit my job and…and do what?” Steve asked.  “Do nothing.  I can’t—what’s am I supposed to do?”
“In the past five minutes, you went from horny to a plan,” Rhodey observed.
Tony pulled his finger out and reached over to dip his hand in the warm oil again.  This time, he looked up at Steve and kept his eyes locked there while he slowly pushed two fingers in.  It was still a tight fit. It had been so long, Steve thought, with a bright burst of need.  Tony’s fingers worked him, stretching and tugging at his rim, pushing deep inside him so they brushed lightly against that place that sent sparks of aching want to the tip of his cock, a burning sort of pleasure-pain that overrode everything else for those seconds.  Steve couldn’t help but let his hips try to rise to meet Tony’s fingers, though the chains kept him from doing much.  Tony smiled at his efforts though, and patted his knee.
Well, maybe not by heart.
He got on the comm instead, and radioed ahead to make arrangements with Dr. Cho and to have their on-call medical team meet them.  It took awhile, with Natasha relaying vital signs and other information so the teams could have something to go on.  Cho was inconveniently located in Seoul, and even on one of Tony’s jets, it would be too many hours before she could arrive with the new prototype cradle, though she promised to leave immediately.  SHIELD had once had protocols for this, for a—he mentally stumbled.  For a downed Avenger.  Damn.
Away.
“Not doing anything,” Tony objected, clicking out of the internet screen.
“You really don’t roll up the toothpaste tube?” Steve asked, giving Tony what could only be described as a sulking look.
Granted, Tony was paraphrasing just a tad there.
“The Hundred and Seventh,” JARVIS clarified.  “Stationed in Afghanistan, for the most part, according to the service records I was able to access.”
, was at least a familiar frustration when it came to her, he thought with a grimace.
“Good,” she said as they stopped in front of the open elevator. “No phone or other electronic device on you?”
The artwork on the walls was not the typical mass produced kind, either, Steve noticed.  Something probably commissioned to go with the room, beautiful and neutral and nothing like what art should be.  Probably no one was going to object, though, which he supposed was the point.  No one objecting.  Or, no one who mattered objecting.  Amounted to the same thing, in the end.  If he’d learned anything out here, it was that, he thought, a dull, familiar sort of ache spreading out from the center of his chest.
There’s a path through the mountain, Steve thought, eyes dropping to the table as his hands balled into fists in his lap.
“Not coming back?” Steve frowned.  “I needed to think. I told you that,” Steve reminded him.
They stayed that way for some time. Steve thought Tony dozed.  His own nerves thrummed with too much newfound energy to allow him to rest, but it was pleasant, having Tony in his arms like this, finally, after all this time.
“It’s working!” Steve called over his shoulder.  A tentacle thumped at the side of the boat, probably Shellhead’s way of saying, ‘Of course it’s working, dummy, I designed it.’  Steve smiled.
