Tony had had a sinking feeling Pierce had figured it out a while ago. After all, he knew Tony just about as well as everyone else. Unfortunately, better than some others too. He choked as Crossbones gripped his throat with his other hand, but out of the corner of his eye, he could see a sheath strapped to Crossbones’ thigh. If he could just get his weight to balance properly, he could get a hand up to grab the blade.
Coming up on his knee must have been all Iron Man had strength to do, because he didn’t move anymore the closer the Captain got to him. That was fine by Steve. He planted a hand right against the faceplate and slammed Iron Man’s head back into the wall. More of the cement cracked and crumbled to the sidewalk, and Iron Man bent backward as the hydraulics in his suit whined their displeasure.
“Thank you,” Tony said, lifting his head to show his sincerity. “This...this has been the best date I’ve had.”
drooling. “I’m sorry. I don’t normally do, um, blind dates. It’s not really a thing for-”
Tony snorts. “He won’t even know. I’m not going for a wardrobe, Pep. I’m just going to get a... What do you call it?”
“Okay, great. I’ll go put these in and when I come back, I’ll grab your orders.”
Steve drops his forehead to Tony's, eyes squeezing shut as he seemingly focuses on the push and pull of the toy. "So did you," he counters.
It was about then that Tony realized his feet were planted flat on the table, legs spread to hook around metal bars attached to the corners, and with it, he was unable to find the leverage to rock back against Steve. He strained against the bars, knees pressing tightly to the metal. Steve, in turn, pressed their foreheads together and turned his face to look at one of Tony’s knees.
Tony took in the sight of it, confirming to himself what he’d guessed this was supposed to have been: a date. Then, he pushed his goggles into his hair and put his tools in the crate beside his low stool.
“Relax, the suit’s empty.”
“Get them out of my sight."
Tony watches for a moment and hears “Let me borrow your pen, Sam.”
Tony made no move to stop him, but twisted just a little to take Victor’s glass from the bartop. He saluted Victor with it and purred, “Down the hatch, Victor,” smirking as the other man went to his knees.
“When you’re finished there, your first gift is in the other room,” Tony says, and the way he says
“Don't think so, Cap. Haven't fixed the suit from your manhandling yet, so you'll have to go without me. Don't worry, though, you can always hump my leg later if you're a good boy.”
“Tony?” a tentative, soft call of his name that has Tony banging his head on the cabinet in his haste to get back on his feet.
Sam just shot him an annoyed look and signalled for another round.
“Oh, you’re Italian?” he responds in kind and the man eyes him while using the dirty hem of his sleeve to dab at his temple. Steve has always loved languages and he took right to them as he was learned.
“What if he feels something’s off?” Sam wondered after a moment while Steve contemplated his empty glass. He felt Sam glance his way.
It turned out that Pierce was quiet for almost three weeks. All of Iron Man’s contacts hadn’t heard from the Hydra leader or any of his associates. So, Tony spent some of that time actually visiting Pepper to check in on his Malibu operations. The California sun had done wonders for her disposition, or maybe it had just been having a break from his constant avoidance of executive duties before making her C.E.O. Perhaps, it was even the shining diamond on her left ring finger that bore the inscription ‘With every breath, I will love you’ in a line of beautiful curls.
“There’s no reason why you should allow them to hurt you. You came to my aid without question and yet…” Natasha trailed off and shrugged. She turned to keep walking, lifting her hands to the bulk of her curls. Dark fingers slid through the dark hair to pin it all up at the crown of her head.
Steve reaches behind himself and takes hold of Tony's cock. He strokes Tony once, twice, more as he gathers the flow of precum before rolling a condom down over him. He spreads the fluid along Tony’s head and shaft then, letting Tony's hips roll into the motion.
He thought he already climaxed once, humiliated by the thought of how easy he’d made it for Tony. Overwhelmed and blindsided, it felt like he'd exploded around the sounding rod within the first few minutes of stimulation without even realizing it. He could imagine the evidence, almost see his cum well up and spill out around the sleek rod as his cock twitched even further at the thought.
Rescue straightens, her head coming up, determined, to face Tony. “You don’t want to do this.”
“Coming to see if you might be hungry,” Rogers finished in a rush, blushing too noticeably to ignore this time.
“It’s fine. I mean, I admit that I was expecting something more like a sandwich shop, but…” He craned his head to the side to peer at the bag hanging from the crook of Steve’s arm, “
"Promise?" And holy fuck, the man's voice is enough to send more fluid welling up to drip down over the man's fingers. "I've got all night, if you've got the room."
“Damn,” Tony muttered, and then, “I hate flying to Latveria. He’s so…” He snapped his fingers, trying to choose a specific word.
, and she caught him as he dropped, hauling him up and tossing him to the side in the dirt. “Stay down!”
Steve surged up Tony’s body to kiss the words away from him. He cupped Tony’s jaw, thumb digging into the bolt of it to keep his mouth open wider. It was messy, but Tony didn’t care, chasing Steve’s tongue with his own on a desperate moan.
He’d have to keep
“Naturally, but files indicate that Captain Rogers requested the re-enlistment. Notations suggest that SHIELD psychiatrists believe that he thinks being out in the field will help him adjust more quickly. One note reads: ‘Captain Rogers dislikes being idle. It leaves him too much time to think and focus on his loss. It’s possible that Captain Rogers could be a liability. Against Director Fury’s recommendation, Captain Rogers is being approved for active duty, per Councilman Pierce’s direct approval. Director Fury concedes as long as Captain Rogers reports for his weekly therapy, he will remain on active duty. He will be monitored closely.’”
“He clearly meant me!” came over the line with a thick accent.
“Whoa, wait, run that back. Two reports.”
He wouldn’t escape, not without gathering what he could. He started forward towards the door where the men were still speaking, but there was a force in the air behind him, a slight whirl of the atmosphere.
“And yet, here you are, Captain.” Tony tossed his pliers onto the table top as he interrupted Steve, and then he snatched at the coffee so Steve couldn’t change his mind. He clutched it close to his chest and made a show of stepping towards the other table, the other robot. “If he cared so much, he wouldn’t have sent you. Aren’t you just one straw piece away from kicking my ass? I don’t have my suit on, should be pretty easy for you, a slow old man like me.”
“I want you to know, though, that I never broke. When you brought me in, and you strapped me to a bed in that room, and you battered at my programming, hammering it with the people that loved me. The hell you put them through so that you could assuage your guilt, it never broke me. I gave you what you wanted. I let you see when you were blinded to anything else. I was going to take Barnes and leave you all behind. That was all I needed, because I didn’t want to hurt you, Steve. I didn’t want you to get in the way. You were my friend, and I loved you. But you, you broke that. You broke it so completely, because you let him… You
Tony rolled his eyes behind his faceplate, but opened the door and flew off into the night and the wintry mix. He didn’t have too far to fly in it, having parked his car in the next town over. By the time he came in for a quiet landing, his armor was coated in a thin sheet of sleet that was attempting to ice over. But Jarvis retracted the suit quickly enough into its travel-size case and Tony tossed it into the passenger seat.
It was a familiar path through the low-lit tables, and several of the guests glanced after them out of curiosity. Tony paid them no attention. They turned a corner, and the maitre d’ stepped to the side to allow Tony to pass.
Tony doesn’t answer at first. He’s mesmerized by Steve’s reaction. His skin is ruddy, the flush sweeping fully down Steve’s chest, disappearing around his navel only to reappear surrounding his cock. The head of his cock is already shiny with precome.
“Were you there?” Tony wondered, leaning on an elbow as he turned in his seat. He casually crossed his legs and thought about how Steve was standing there almost at attention with only one shoe on. He smiled. “I honestly hadn’t noticed.”
“I warned you, Stark, that we’d be done with you soon enough. You didn’t think I was lying, did you?” Crossbones dug his heel into the back of Tony’s knee then knelt down with his own knee pressed into Tony’s back. His gloved fingers slipped through Tony’s hair; the strands felt slick against his head and he guessed he had a head wound to top it all off.
Pepper is still not amused.
“Your temporary insurance policy,” he answered after a moment, and Steve’s expression went softer still. He relaxed against the pillows, taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly.
Iron Man was silent, armor still as he looked at them.
“It wasn’t that short, Tony,” Pepper admonishes, but there’s warmth in her tone and Tony knows he’s pleased her by remembering.
“Just stop. It’s not all your fault. It’s theirs too, but after Tammy, I thought we had an agreement,” Pepper retorts, pacing angrily. Tony can’t see her, but he can hear the click of her stilettos.
It didn’t always. So she sharpened her sword herself and kept her shield as polished as she could. She didn’t need to draw anymore attention to herself by going into the armory. It made sense in her head.
Steve with his perfectly pressed suit and combed hair and gentleman’s respect. Steve was fresh air compared to Ty’s toxic presence.
“What are you apologizing for?” Steve asks and presses his hand soothingly to the back of Tony’s neck. His thumb sweeps up along the tendon in Tony’s neck and, the next thing Tony knows, he’s burrowed against Steve’s chest and his tears are soaking Steve’s shirt.
“I haven’t look at them yet,” Tony admitted, walking stiffly over to the closest part of the wet bar. He reached over the countertop to grab a larger tumbler then kept walking to move around to where Victor had left a bottle of Glennfiddich. He felt Victor turn to watch him.
Steve blinks slowly and uses the tip of his tongue to wet his bottom lip. “I did,” he assures Tony. “I might...have used more of that soap than was really needed, but better safe than sorry, right?”
Regardless, Tony didn't sleep with the enemy. Or blondes, for that matter. Perhaps, he should make a note to start with the blondes on his omittance list. If the Captain had been brunette, for instance…
(amazing cheerleader and beta)
“Don’t worry about Pierce. I’ve got my eye on him.”
Lunchtime.
“You don’t know as much as you think,” Tony said after a moment.
Landscapes.
“Jay, blow this up, focus on the left gauntlet.” Tony climbed out of his seat to get closer to the screen where the proposed Iron Man was poised mid-flight.
“Wanda goes now,” Pietro said, “You come here, or you want me t-”
“What can I get for you, guys?” she asked, pen poised to paper.
Steve’s hand is warm on his calf and he’s looking up at Tony through his lashes. His mouth is curved in amusement and Tony flushes.
Tony’s laugh was only a little hysterical, but maybe that was just to his own ears.
He couldn’t even muster the energy to pull up his data files to input all of the specifics of the incident. He’d have to rewatch the footage later when he wasn’t dying. He coughed weakly and scrambled up for the trashcan.
“Banging on it wouldn’t cause as much as an issue, Stark,” Bucky drawled and Tony blinked before he flushed and smiled.  Steve nearly choked on his beer as Natasha threw her head back and laughed.
“No. There’s nothing left to say,” Tony said after a moment. He grabbed a sweatshirt and his cane, leaving the room. He planned to hide in the lab for as long as he could, definitely not thinking about how Steve felt stretched around his dick. It would be a long day indeed.
Buck flushes and tries not to grimace as Tony forgets his manners and practically feels up the prosthetic.
“Yes, ma’am.” Steve almost snaps a salute. Tony can see the urge tremble along his arm.
Tony looked to the panel in question and the super soldier, side-size dent in the freshly soldered panel. He sighed and took the goggles off to let them fall to the floor.
They stared at one another for a long, tense moment, and then Victor huffed, the sound of his surrender. He dragged his fingers down from Tony’s shirt, smearing blood down further as it came to the fastenings of Tony’s pants.
“Sir?” he hears his valet question, but Steve is already striding forward. There’s a sheen of red on the man’s temple that has slid into the man’s unkempt hair.Or from it, Steve thinks with a frown of distaste.
“You’re right,” Tony says, but both gauntlets are up and firing. Rhodey catches Pepper’s hand, and Steve knocks two agents away from him. He twists and throws the shield as hard as he can. It slams into Tony’s arms, knocking off his trajectory. The beams go wide as Tony staggers. The shield continues on, jackknifing from the impact.
“What happened? Why-” He cut himself off and shook his head a little, trying to recall just what the hell had occurred. “Where are we?”
Stephanie searched Natasha’s face and wet her lips nervously before forcing the words out. “You...You’re very beautiful too.”
“Tony, what did you do?” He asked slowly, carefully flexing his hands atop the hospital covers. He wanted to shake the answer out of him, get it faster, know it already. He’d never lost time like that with the doctors before. It was… He was feeling a little claustrophobic at the thought.
The gurney beneath him clacked over a doorway, and the bright light of the operating room was blurry, but his vision soon dimmed as they pumped enhanced anesthetics into his system. All the drugs did was make him feel heavy and queasy. He’d told the SHIELD doctors that time and again, but they never seemed to listen. He saw the small SHIELD insignia on the sleeve of the closest coat and let his eyes close.
that with the strands of genetic coding our mystery person is leaving around and the fact that they got a working Iron Man suit without it actually working properly due to the whole ‘no power system’ thing-” there, Tony thumped his chest, suppressed his automatic wince, and carried on, “-that we are definitely dealing with a person of magic!”
The next day in class, one of Steve’s students had a question.
“You...to want...me?” Tony guessed. He coughed, the words hoarse and scratching his sore throat.
tools, so you got that part right.”
“Yeah, that was some dress,” Tony murmurs then shakes himself out of the memory. “Oh, yeah. I’m definitely going. You and Rhodey have gone. It’s about time I meet who’s been putting his hands all over my friends.”
“You, Tony Stark, really aren’t that good of a liar,” he pointed out, unable to help the fondness coloring his tone.
Steve woke up slowly, a low hum coming from his phone on the nightstand. He flopped a hand around to grab it and pressed the message open.
“But that’s what happens when someone doesn’t have the support they need,” Fury finished for him, “and that’s where we come in. I hope. I want you to work with us, Tony. And yes, that means Captain America too.”
/, and he nearly cries, feels the sobs shaking loose in his shoulders and is forced to curl in on himself.
“Are you?” Frank asked, “Because from where I see it, you’ve just been growing softer. I don’t think you got what it takes to take on Hydra anymore, and fucking forget Alexander Pierce. He’s not going down without taking the fucking East Coast with him, and I ain’t about to risk that because you got a hate boner for the guy.”
“Boss ain’t gonna be happy about him bein’ here.”
“Don’t call me that,
Tony groaned and tried to work his tongue around the ribbon, around Steve’s fingertips. Steve hooked his fingers down against Tony’s teeth, twisting a little to watch his cock pump in and out. He braced his other hand on the brick wall by Tony’s head and leaned in to kiss at Tony’s mouth, at the damp and swollen lips, his own fingers as they pulled Tony against the harness.
“Not full pieces like Steve does, I don’t have the patience. I’m mostly here for the alterations and finishing touches.” Sam stops at a counter that’s midway back in the shop. It has an updated P.O.S. system from Stark Industries and Tony smiles a little when he sees it.
rose-on-the-mountain said: “tony WHY.” “its a garage sale, you’re SUPOSED to buy strangely compelling useless crap
Steve's cock was leaving damp spots of precum against the hospital sheets, already soaked from Tony's spit leaving him a dripping mess. It became trapped between Steve and Tony's tailored suit, and he rocked up into Tony with abandon, chasing the pleasure and friction.
He shifts on the bed so he can kneel slightly over Steve and takes his cock in hand again. Holding it steady, he teases the slightly curved, smooth end of the rod against Steve’s tip. Steve’s body is locked down tight. Tony can feel the tenseness radiating from Steve’s thighs.
"C'mon, J," Tony groans, calloused hands cradling Pepper's thighs around his waist. "Move those hands of yours. She likes it."
Pepper smiled. “Sure, or something like it.”
“They said to breathe out, relax,” Tony reminds him gently. “And stop me immediately.”
“Yours?” Tony asks and Steve makes an agreeable sound.
He is crying.
“It’s your own fault, Stark,” he muttered, though he could only hear the hum of his voice with how loud the music was. He continued to berate himself as he went back to work, “You were dumb enough to go and fall in love after all this time. What the fuck did you expect? A white knight? Hell, you learned early on you couldn’t trust anyone. Isn’t that why you built yourself the shining armor?”
Steve only waved over his shoulder and then was gone. Tony stuck his tongue out at the spot he had been then slid into his driver seat. He stared at the steering wheel for a long time before pressing the start button.
Tony felt the scream tear up his throat before it was echoing around him in the returned darkness. He lashed out, swinging and shooting wildly, trying anything to free himself. The screaming was hoarse and he was wrecking his voice, but he couldn’t stop. He couldn’t understand what the point was. Why? Why?
toxic. And I’m not going to run away. Not from this, not from you. Ever, Tony. Especially when you’re feeling like this. I want you to feel like I’m your safe zone, okay? No matter what, no matter who, is bothering you or how you’re feeling, I want you to know that I’ll be here. I’ll always listen. Or I’ll just sit with you quietly if you don’t want to talk. Any one of us would do this for you. Tony, we love you.”
"That's enough!" Fury said, raising his voice. "Stark, you shut the fuck up. Captain, you go cool your head!"
He steps up behind her, and she remains still. Her gaze doesn't stray from the wall in front of her.
“I know it’s really out there,” Steve starts to babble. “Just by the, um, general responses I got back from searching more about it. If it’s too much, I-we can try something else. I just,” he sighs. “I just thought I’d show you.”
“About that food? Do you at least have cookies?” Bob asked.
“That’s not possible,” Tony said staunchly, one hand smacking Fury’s desk, “Doombots aren’t in production anymore. I know this.” He’d been there, watched Victor shut the lab down himself.
There was sullen, snarling silence as Tony glared murder right back at Steve. Fury made a sound of frustrated disgust.
“I’ve never done this before,” Tony says, flicking through the information. He feels suddenly like he’s in overdrive. “Do… Do you want to do it to me?”
"You're so beautiful," the man says at Tony's ear, catching one of Tony's wrists in a light grip to hold it further up the wall.
“I’m not trying to butter you up or whatever crazy idea just went through your head, so just cool your jets,” Fury smirked, “I just don’t like Taco Tuesday.”
“Leave him alone,” and yeah, Tony knew that voice, struggling further when Crossbones grabbed his other leg as he kicked. Ronin appeared again, astride Crossbones back. The black and yellow mask hid his identity well, but Tony knew that recurve bow like the back of his hand. Seeing it in action was satisfying in a visceral way.
Tony didn’t respond, only really catching about every third word or so. He tried to get up again, but Crossbones’ heavy boot came down on his leg and left him gasping in blinding pain.
Of course, one warning snap later, and the pulley system began to collapse. Tony had less than a moment’s brief existence to think of his suit before he was bracketed by two very strong arms raised above his head and a very solid, hot -damn, his body temperature was ridiculously high- body shoving his own out of the way. He stumbled out from under everything, wincing as he took in the sight of the metal panel folding under the weight of the pulley.
He wants to cry.
“No,” and that’s the first steady, adamant response Steve’s given and Tony’s flushed all over. He needs to get out of his clothes, take a cold shower. “I want you to do it to
“I don’t have one,” is the response and the two start a little glaring-scuffle that has the other man clearing his throat beside Tony. Tony shakes himself and turns his attention to the other man.
Tony laughed; he couldn’t help it, and it rankled him a little, but he didn’t let that emotion through. “Catholic boy, huh? I should’ve known. You’ve got a bit of that caged wildness about you.”
“The same genetic coding?” Tony spit out, throwing a heavy, sixty-inch pipe wrench across the center of the turbine. It clattered almost maliciously between the slats all the way to the concrete floor, causing such a ruckus that even Jarvis paused.
That time, Steve was expecting Tony’s retaliation and curled down over him just as he lost focus.
“That explains it.” Tony dropped his hat and glasses under the table by his foot and futzed with his napkin in turn. “I’m sure she told you she’s my godmother. She won’t be satisfied until I’m happily settled down.”
“Stop. Am I blushing?” Tony deadpanned. “Honestly, how you play those games is beyond me. You were in a war, wasn’t that enough?”
“You still...love me.” Tony sniffled.
“The DNA sequence we picked up at the airport matches the DNA sequence I’ve just scanned from the internal dampeners on the turbine. Casting a wider net within the hangar alone, the sequence occurs again exactly three times. I project that the affected equipment will malfunction within the next three hours, in two days, and in one week. If not attended to, of course.
Send them back. Send them back and he knows that Steve will stop.
Tony grunted through the strain, knowing that his actions were in vain when Jarvis began to tick down the final seconds. As one, he and the projectiles turned, and he slammed his palms together. The suit clanked loudly.
Neither of them said anything for a few moments as Steve’s heart monitor slowed back to its normal pace, and he hummed quietly.
Tony has been so blind, so stupid, allowing himself to believe they could be something when Steve had never intended that. Every word and action perfectly acted to draw Tony in and keep him there, aided by Tony's fear of loss and other neuroses.
Jarvis holds her through the first one, then the ones that follow as Tony moves inside her, finding a counterbalance against the steadfastness of Jarvis' solid stance. Pepper's arm is curled around Jarvis' neck, finding purchase against the back of the helmet even with her grip shaky and slick.
“Yes, I have. Cafeteria’s got tacos today,” Jerry said unhelpfully as he towed a crate of scrap from another project and passed where they stood inside the turbine.
Seven months later, Steve receives a package via T'Challa. T'Challa looks grim and possibly a little sympathetic.
Tony feels like a monster, like a toxic sludge that’s sucking Steve down and he wants to tell Steve to run, to save himself.
And he learns how to die.
“The…” Steve gestured, clearly embarrassed if not a little frustrated. “Happy ending. He’s… I thought he would’ve tried to sleep with me by now, bu-”
“J, we have to get this place evacuated faster!” Tony wasted no time in finding the door. He burst through the siding, hitting the concrete floor of the warehouse at a run as the innocuous gray shipping crates came into view, sitting exactly as protocol dictated.
He feels fear.
The realization threatened to drown him, made his spine chill, but the clicking and hissing of Tony’s armor chased it all away, left him tense and quivering in position. He didn’t want to be blindfolded anymore. He wanted to be able to look up, to watch Tony step out of the black armor, watch the red and gold panels gleam and contract beneath the bright laboratory lights.
“Once upon a time, you didn’t care who you hurt along the way to your brand of justice,” Victor said, his words damning even as he spoke civilly, calmly. Tony’s lip curled again, hating the tone, as if Victor were talking about the goddamn weather of all things. His fingers twitched around the curve of the countertop behind him.
“Oh,” Tony blinked, “I could eat. Actually, I probably should.” He waited a moment to see if his stomach would have comedic timing, and when it didn’t, he went back to ruminating on the almost-kiss. If that’s what it had been. It was entirely possible that all of it was in his head, but he didn’t own multiple doctorates to be
There was no response, so Tony twisted to see if he could get out on the passenger side. He reached for the passenger seat to pull himself across the car. There was too much pain to focus on what might have been broken, but when he coughed again, the back of his hand was covered in red. He grimaced, forcing back another cough and clawed his way out of his trashed car.
The vibrations continued for only a minute or two, just long enough for Tony to shift a couple times, and then they were gone. He had breathed out, and gone on with his morning.
Across the field, a flash of dark skin -so rare among the Nords- caught Stephanie’s gaze, drawing it in until she met eyes that were as red as flame even from a distance.
“Mr. Stark?” Steve queried, and Tony tucked his things under his arm to return the handshake.
“I really want to invite you home,” Tony said, startling them both. “And I’m sure anything people read about me would expect just that, but I’m not going to. I want to, but I think…”
“He’s a teacher,” Tony stated flatly, placing a pick between his teeth as he leaned forward to scribble some notes along the margin of his music sheet.
After a moment, he ventured; “So, boyfriend, huh?”
When he wakes next, he’s no longer hanging from the shackles. He’s strapped to a table inside a tube, and Tony is watching him again. Beyond Tony, Bucky is slumped on the floor, breath fogging along the cold concrete. Steve can barely think through the fog of drugs in his system.
Steve isn’t the only perceptive one on the team.
Tony forced his shoulders to relax, and he turned in the tight space Steve had left him to face him. He looked up at Steve, saw Steve see the bruising from his hit the day before, saw the wince, and smiled sadly in satisfaction.
This world is…
It turned out, almost three hours later, that Captain Rogers was far more intelligent than anyone had been letting on. It was a gratifying discovery when Rogers asked all the right questions, never once falling behind or getting lost in Tony’s answers. He was truly interested in everything Tony was teaching him. It was refreshing, illuminating.
The night was almost too silent once Ronin was gone, hauling Crossbones’ body along with him and leaving Tony bleeding and pretty broken on the road. Such was their lives. He’d done far more than Tony would have ever expected, and it was a painful, bittersweet realization that there was another person out there that he might be able to trust.
General Carter leaned back in her seat. “Insightful. Alright, fine. I won’t tolerate fighting in my camp, Titanborn. Find a way to deal with it, or I will. And I promise, it will not be pretty. Dismissed.”
“Sam is just fine, but fair’s fair, so you’re Tony while you’re in here,” Sam says then crooks a finger. “I’ll show you back this way. Steve’s the head honcho. He owns the shop and he’ll be taking care of you today.”
- metal made Tony freeze. His eyes widened, pupils dilating until there was barely any brown left.
It was all carefully piled onto one large tray held in Rogers’ steady hands. He looked sheepish, but determined, as he stepped into the ring of the turbine and cleared his throat to get Tony’s attention.
Steve looked up through his lashes and bobbed his head down, swallowing around the full length of Tony’s cock until Tony’s thighs were tense and trembling. He dragged his hand up Tony’s thigh, pushed it out, and swept his fingers inward. He traced the tight skin of Tony’s balls, rubbed a thumb over and back and teased it further until he was pressing warm and teasing at Tony’s hole.
“Probably,” agreed Fury blandly, “but it’s the only option you’ve got left. You say you can’t be in a cell or Pierce --the East Coast Director, mind you-- will have you killed because you know the ‘truth’. Oh, and he apparently killed your parents.”
Tony felt the flare of heat that could be fanned to something more, and the question was mirrored - he was sure - in Steve’s gaze as they pulled apart. For some reason, though, he knew that he wasn’t going to let it go further.
“It’s fine. Put the gun down before I report you to the Captain!” Then, she turned and adjusted a valve on one of the IV bags hanging beside his bed. He wanted to yell, to object. He couldn’t handle drugs and absolutely loathed not having control of his mind, but he couldn’t do anything as they swept him into unconsciousness again to the too-fast beeping of the tachycardia monitor.
Because he realizes he's talking lowly to himself when he sketches. And he sketches a lot.
“Under no circumstances are you to get anything with the word ‘fried’ in the name,” Tony said, affecting a snobbish air. He even lifted his nose. Rogers’ smile went a little less ‘real’, and Tony breathed a sigh of relief, then mentally smacked himself upside the head for the whole stupid situation. “Unless it comes with the word oreo.”
“You’re letting your feelings blind you to the situation. He wasn’t the only one at the accident, and we both know it wasn’t a hit-and-run, so where’s the other person? A body? Anything!”
Never trust anyone, even those with a soft smile and kind, blue eyes.
“Net,” Tony says, and Pepper twists around, shooting up to her feet to face Tony.
This morning, the asset knows that this is the beginning of the end. He can taste it in the air, see it in the slump of Tony’s shoulders before Tony realizes and tries to hide it. They’re both aware of the one they brought in last night. He hands the asset a set of instructions.
“It’s quite a good imitation, I must say,” supplied Victor. He set the remote on his desk behind his hip where he leaned against rich wood. Tony would never say it to Victor’s face -okay, he totally would, just not right now when he needed his help-, but Victor looked exhausted, strained. Tony briefly considered asking him about why that may be, but then… didn’t.
-, he’d wake up already screaming into his pillow. It muffled the noise and provided a good enough place to wipe his tears.
He drinks it all in, eidetic memory committed to every details despite inebriation, and he gets the feeling that Steve is doing the same. He slides his hand down Steve's chest, palms his stomach before hooking three fingers into Steve's waistband and leading him from the suite's foyer into the large bedroom.
“Be thankful I didn’t take your hand, Tony. Now, stay here and think about what you’ve done.” He placed the bottle on the table across from the machine and swaggered out.
“Sure,” Rogers replied, smiling the same sort of smile Tony gave the reporters who asked him his opinion on Iron Man. It was ‘real’, accepting without showing its disappointment. “Anything off the menu?”
“Unfortunately, I think I’ve lost my bag now, so my business here is done.”
“Aye, General,” Stephanie replied, pushing to her feet. The feeling of it being unfair never crossed her mind. It was her fault, she knew, for being different.
“Boys will be boys, right?” And that was Obie, and it was Tony’s worst nightmare, “He can’t help it that all the young girls want to get to know him. Look at that face! Even Stone wouldn’t resist that innocent face.”
“I see he put up a fight,” Tony comments, crouching down to turn Steve’s face one way, then the other. His nose is busted, his left eye swollen shut.
get onto all fours for the plug. “Go ahead. Let’s see if you’re on game better than girlfriend number three.”
Crossbones’ head exploded just as Ronin vaulted backwards to avoid the splatter. The recoil from the shotgun had the butt of it slamming into Tony’s shoulder, but he honestly couldn’t have cared any less. As Crossbones’ body crumpled, so did Tony. He collapsed against the ground, the gun rolling away from his hand.
Steve rubbed a thumb over Tony’s skin. “I can’t take off for your whole tour. I can’t just leave my job like that.”
“I should get going…” Tony trailed off as they spoke at the same time. For a moment, something passed over Steve’s expression that Tony couldn’t quite decipher because it was quickly overtaken by a cautious determination. Tony had to cut it off before Steve learned how easy it would be to convince him. “I don’t care how much you think you’re healing. I’m not going to risk exacerbating the problem. I’ll come by tomorrow with a new phone for you, and we’ll see how you’re feeling then.”
“Sputtering how?” he wondered, arching a brow in Rogers’ direction.
Tony's eyes cross with how tight Steve's body clenches down on his cock like he's trying to force Tony's orgasm along with him. It doesn't last, though. Steve pulls off before his dick is even done spilling, and he's pulling Tony up, up and up until Tony's kneeling and Steve is carefully, but impatiently pulling off the condom. Tony is already stroking himself quickly, teeth bared in tension as each upstroke shoves his cock against Steve's chin, his bottom lip.
It has all been in vain. One by one, he has watched his teammates, his friends, die under Bucky's hands. No, not really Bucky. Steve struggles to remember that. He stares as Natasha is carried out of the room, out of sight. He manages to catch sight of Bucky one last time, and the blank expression shakes Steve further to his core, as it always does.
“Stop!” Steve growled, his gaze fierce behind the cowl. He was straddling Iron Man now, gloved fingers bending in between the shoulder panels to start prying them apart. The left shoulder plate went first, and Steve threw it behind him. The clatter of it along the pavement went pretty much unnoticed as, with the first opening, he found it much easier to get the rest of the armor off. He stayed below Iron Man’s head, peeling the suit open from the shoulders down, piece by piece as he revealed Tony’s body underneath.
“I don’t want to be their hero or their… whatever they’re painting Iron Man to be. I’ve done shitty things, Nick, in the name of getting to Pierce. This has been a long time building. I wasn’t… Pierce is my endgame. That’s all there is to it.”
Steve starts slowly. It's just a random doodle, nothing he's paying too much attention.
Behind him, the fight continued, the dull thud of fists and grunts echoing around them. He didn’t dare lose focus to look over his shoulder to check, but he was pretty sure his savior had the upper hand, and he was pretty sure he recognized the yellow-trimmed costume. The arrows definitely helped.
"Yeah,
“Exactly!” Tony decreed, clapping Victor on the shoulder hard enough to sway the other man forward a bit. “You know what this means, right?”
Tony had fallen in love with him. The words he hadn’t been meant to hear, a private moment just another item on the list he’d stolen from Tony. How would he ever prove that he’d never meant it to get this far if he couldn’t stop taking and taking?
“The last sequence has one minute and thirty seconds,” Jarvis answered, “May I suggest engaging Crossbones before he reaches the square?”
Rogers. Steve. Love. Guilt. Heavy, obliterating guilt.
He’d told Tony months ago, brushed off his suspicions, that he didn’t think Pierce was as bad as Tony thought. The truth was, though, that Steve hadn’t been able to accept it. Accepting it had meant accepting that he’d died for nothing. He’d failed when he’d sacrificed himself to stop Hydra, and now…
“Really. I have a very important dinner date on Friday and I need a suit that will drive my date wild,” Tony states, settling his hands on his hips.
“Not dating, my ass. It’s like you’re already married.”
A warm weight was against his side and his fingers absently played with the ring on Tony’s left hand where it was tucked in the crook of his elbow. He smiled at the hint of amusement in his tone. He didn’t have to open his eyes to know Tony’s right hand was busy with his phone.
The false Iron Man, Steve could say with a bitter certainty, had blindsided him, dodged the ricochet of his shield, and thrown Steve through not one, but two buildings. When the second foundation had settled around him, his world had gone dark.
“You can change before you perform,” Pepper said after a moment.
“Mr. Hogan has been cleared on all levels, sir,” Jarvis responded, and if Tony wasn’t mistaken, he sounded a little uptight as if Tony had insulted his AI by even questioning.
Over the next few weeks, Tony cleans up, sells the penthouse and enjoys Steve's sporadic-to-steady company. He tells Steve about Rumiko and the mugging that took her life when Tony wasn't strong enough to stop it.
“J-Jarvis?”
He watched his own face in the dream, slack for all of Ty’s manhandling. He watched as his other self never even registered the door opening, Pepper’s shouting, and Ty’s rough movements as he dragged Tony off the bed with him.
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Tony cut in dismissively, though his ears burned at the insinuation. Once upon a time…
“Both,” he answered.
He tries to stop, tries to bite back the words, abhorred by the very insecurities that led him to this point. But Steve is patient, big hands rubbing methodically up and down his back. One hand leaves briefly and Tony barely catches the sight of Natasha as Steve waves her silently out.
They both have sweat slick along their skin. It’s starting to soak their shirts, and Tony enjoys looking at them occasionally. Their bare thighs are tensed, trembling against their seats. Their briefs leave nothing to the imagination with how hard their cocks are straining. Tony knows how close his lovers are to being tipped over the edge. But the cock rings he’d clicked into place on them keeps them from spilling without added stimulation.
“Do you know what they do to thieves some countries, boy?!” Howard snarled. Never let it be said that, even raging drunk, Howard didn’t take care of his kid. He dragged Tony, wide-eyed and too scared to protest, down to his lab. The other hand kept turning the pill bottle round and round. His stride was strong, commanding, as unyielding as his grip around Tony’s wrist.
Tony drops his forehead to the wall, letting the fire chase the alcohol poisoning in his veins, and gets his eyes focused enough to watch the man work his hand into Tony's pants.
“Missy!” He called again, stumbling out of his chair and towards the counter. His throat burned. “Mis-” He doubled over and vomited. His stomach was screaming, throat on fire, body shaking. Why wasn't Melissa coming to help? He slumped to the floor, vomiting again, the murky colors of his cereal mixing with the bright red of his blood. His vision blurred, the image of his fingers slipping in the mess seared into his brain.
“I’m flattered you finally nicknamed my dick, but I think we need more firepower,” Pietro quipped.
Tony’s legs had given out, and he watched with a weird double-vision as the floor swam before his eyes. He’d braced himself, tried to push up, but had been left blinking at Ty’s shoe. The black, pristine loafer had come down on the back of Tony’s hand, dug into the bone with a breaking forcefulness.
“And what about Pierce?” Tony asked, sliding his soda across the table then back again in a set curving path. “I’m telling you right now that’s-”
Steve carefully cupped Tony’s chin up to brush a chaste kiss, and his laugh was warm against Tony’s mouth as they met.
“Steve, please,” Rogers said, the second time he’d requested it, but he couldn’t know that Tony didn’t want to give in, didn’t want to give it to him on his terms. He didn’t give Tony the chance to agree or disagree, though, stepping out of the elevator to lead Tony to the large turbine that took up more than a good chunk of the working bay.
“One moment!” comes as an abrupt shout from the back and Tony’s not impressed yet, but at least he can admit the shop is clean and orderly. The samples of clothes and examples of suit pieces are all displayed wonderfully on the left side of the store. On the right, all the rich fabrics and different dress styles make Tony want to reach out and rub the materials.
“Oh, um…” Stephanie felt herself blush, and Natasha smirked, dark mouth pulling up sharply. “Thank...you?”
Tony stumbles and braces a hand against the bar midway up the glass panels. The door chimes and begins to slide shut. Pepper is very warm and Tony realizes he’s practically trapped her against the bar.
Tony put his hands in his lap, kept his fingers loose and relaxed as he answered, “Not.”
“A woman born of giants and you think you’re not worthy to be met?” Natasha laughed, the husky whorl of it warming Stephanie’s gut.
“Give me Pierce and we have a deal,” Tony said.
Stephanie was not the only woman in the camp. It just so happened that she was the only woman, only
Steve watched their bodies slide down and blinked. He shook his head again and looked to group by the portal.
“Tony, if that was true, then I need you to open this.”
“Have you need of a doctor?” Steve tries again and the man groans and brazenly uses Steve’s shoulder as a bracing post to get to his feet. Steve rises with him, gaze resigned about his need to make sure the stranger is okay, but weary with the prospect of having to deal with him. It has been a long day for him, after all.
Tony peers at Steve. “Yes,” he answers simply, then drops Steve’s chin and powers down the room. He leaves Steve hanging there, the silence deafening in his departure.
“I don’t know; I think engineer-chic is in style these days,” Rogers replied, “but if you’re sure.”
“-innocent as I seem, Mr. Stark, and please, call me Steve. We'll be working closely together from what I hear.”
He stops his gingerly pace and half-turns back to her. She’s full-on glaring at him, hands on her hips and Tony’s reminded of a woman’s fury and proverbs. He’s a little scared.
“You don’t think I’ve thought of that, Captain? You’ve seen it now, though, that suit, that tech, and what it can do. You’ve watched the footage, analyzed the data. We could use him!”
It was also flooded with a thousand different middles to songs he’d instantly want to sing under a window like a lovesick moron.
"Tony," his name comes out with a sigh, resigned and final, and Tony stiffens. "Step away from the window. Go back to sleep."
“This is the worst act of Good Cop and Bad Cop I’ve ever seen,” Tony said once she’d gone. He looked over Fury’s head to one of the rows of televisions. Only a few here and there were turned already, all on various channels, but the few closest to them were playing the news. One, in particular, was replaying the battle of the Port. Tony looked back to Fury.
“Yeah?” Tony asked, setting his chair down and slowly rising to come around the desk. Ty obediently pushed away from his desk so Tony could slide into his lap. He cupped Tony’s hips, fingers gripping securely. “Then I think a little pre-celebration is in order, don’t you?”
“It’s fine, Titanborn,” Stark said. “You are not the first.”
…/empty/. Empty in the hollow, echoing kind of way. He feels the word like a loose screw rattling around his brain. Breathes in the frigid air around the loss of…
“What did you just say?” Steve asked, his tone guarded like Tony had called out a secret.
Melissa smiled, a small and fond expression she always reserved specifically for Tony and settled him at the breakfast table by the windowed end of the kitchen. The sun gleamed young and bright across the polished oak, skipping over the glassware and casting Tony's fingers in rainbowed light. He wiggled his fingers to spill the light onto Melissa's pristine apron.
And Steve understands. As would the rest of their team. Everyone has moments like these where they just need to be alone, need to express themselves in some way that can bleed out their anxiety, their worry, their demons. Tony, sometimes most of all. Oh, how Steve understands.
thing, Rogers withdrew with a sheepish smile.
“You mean maternity leave?” Steve asked dryly. “It’s not the same thing, Tony.”
Loki rolled his eyes and snapped his fingers. The cuffs dropped to the floor behind Steve with the loud sound of metal on concrete. That was what finally brought the henchmen running into the room.
“Wow,” Tony breathed, slumping a little back in his seat.
“Do you need help?” he asked, but Rogers shook his head.
“Lock the suit up, Mr. Stark,” he murmured, nose brushing along Tony’s hairline, “You’re under house arrest until further notice.”
That’s how they end up here, two hours later.
He hadn’t asked why; it wasn’t his place, but he knows now. That information is fed to the part of him that is still aware that he’s not in control. It threatens to flood him with rage, but nothing comes as he drops the duffel and the body. He watches Steve hit the floor with a blank expression, hears Tony come up to his side.
Fury paused and smirked. He held his hand out towards the door and said, smug and triumphant, “Be my guest. If you can get Captain Rogers to release your suit.”
“What are you- What did you do to Tony?!” Steve growled, shoulders bunching as he pulled at the cuffs on his wrists. “I swear to God, I’ll rip that pretty smile off your face if you- if you-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“For a client. They want the works. It’s a daunting prospect, but I like the challenge.”
"With all due respect, sir,” Steve said in an angry, measured tone, “he's not exactly teamwork material. He's going to get one of us killed, because he doesn't give a damn about the good guys."
“I’m wor-” A hand closed around Iron Man’s ankle, attempting to throw him off course, but Tony cut the power to his thrusters and dropped back to twist and punch the imposter in the center of the faceplate. The hit rang hollow --as Tony expected it would-- and the fake armor fell back, dropping out of its flight and releasing Iron Man as it went.
He calculated how hard he'd have to hit the Captain to maintain permanent damage to the cuspids. It was a pleasant distraction from the warmth in the guy's greeting. He wasn't sure if Captain Rogers was genuinely interested, or if he was naturally charming. He’d bet the latter.
His throat closes up. He bites his tongue. His fingers are curling into his thighs, biting through the ratty denim of his jeans.
…He thinks it is an ‘M’. The thought startles a harsh, frozen laugh from his chest as his brain starts to hum the sound of the letter. What good does an ‘M’ do for him as he hunkers against a rocky outcropping? A battered, green cloak whips against his side, and he’s left wondering where it came from.
Okay, maybe Tony’s a little jealous. But just a little.
Steve’s gaze swept over Tony’s wine-red shirt, the gray suit, the sunglasses. He lingered there, on Tony’s face, and Tony knew he was ticking off the slight lines in Tony’s expression. He smiled easily, teeth on display as he squeezed Steve’s hand.
“What?” Clint glanced up, one hand around Crossbones’ ankle.
Steve ran a hand over the metal frame and hummed, glancing at Tony with a fond expression.
But now, it feels like there is no one left. Steve thinks he prefers it that way.
“He wishes he could throw the real suit,” Tony muttered to the floor, blocking out the scroll of text that counted the number of dead passengers from the cruise line already identified. His head was pounding, begging his body for the sweet relief of oblivion even as he struggled to figure out what the magical copycat was even trying to do. “What the fuck are you after?”
“What’s the word, J?” Tony asked, reaching into the passenger seat to open up the small, Burberry case that held two titanium bracelets. He clipped each one onto his wrists, feeling the connection to his suit thrum into life, and watched data scroll past his eyes.
Steve. Not Captain America or Rogers. Not once had Tony thought of him as anything other than
He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t bre-
'Stop' he whispers frantically as he begins tossing them haphazardly into the box.
For some reason, it's exactly what Tony needs to hear, the perfect words to ease the guilt on his shoulders as Steve's smiles and encouraging presence help to brighten the days again.
Tony breathed out as slowly as possible.
“There isn’t one to hear about! That’s what I’m saying,” Steve said, “I don’t get it. He flirts like air, like it’s just him breathing, but…”
As Tony settled behind the wheel of his Saleen, he traded his current sunglasses for another set. Those were tinted normally, and as he started the car, a blue HUD coalesced in front of his gaze. The car pulled away and left the garage, engine a low-set, promising growl as he peeled out into traffic.
“What?” Steve doesn’t understand. “Did he take T-”
“I mean, yeah, people’ve died, but they die everyday, and you don’t see anyone calling out the so-called heroes when they don’t save everyone. And what about the cops that-” She stopped there and rolled her eyes at herself, “Sorry. It’s just I have to listen to the same news reports over and over, and they can really start to wear a person down with all their negativity.”
There was silence for a moment except for the subtle shift of fabric.
He sets the package down and gets the top opened. He bends one flap back and peers inside. The only thing he pulls out is a small slip of scrap paper. It sits tight in his fist as he sits down and stares listlessly at the package.
“It’s fine. I’m fine,” Steve promised against Tony’s fingers. “I don’t go anymore unless I really have to. This, this isn’t one of those times, but I could use your help bandaging it.”
Tony’s hand was wet from where it shook, the water in the cup spilling over the rim. Neither of them acknowledged it. The words were on the tip of his tongue, but at the same time, they choked him.
“Generally, SHIELD deals with my R&D Department; this was just a courtesy call.” Tony waited a beat for the inevitable protest, but when none actually came, he tipped his head to the side a bit. A lock of his hair fell across his brow. He watched Rogers’ gaze track the movement. “But I'm sure I could make an exception to give you the initial tour of your new inventory, Captain.”
Steve lets out a shuddering moan, sounding punched out from the gut and he’s nearly biting through his lip. “M-Move it,” he orders, words barely audible over his moan.
Tony watched the spray of blood that followed as if it happened in slow motion. “Steve! No!” He rolled towards the end, shoving his hand into the waters.
When she set the heavy, double-headed axe in Stephanie’s hand, they held each other’s gaze for a long moment. If Stephanie believed in such girlish, childhood fantasies, she’d believe that the moon uncovered precisely at the moment to shine down on them with promise.
“Oh,” Pepper says, and Tony watches Bucky’s eyes widen as Steve startles only just a little. “It was quite spectacular
There was a mask over his face when awareness tried to take control again. It pumped fresh oxygen into him, leaving him lightheaded. His vision swam as he turned his head towards the noise beside him. There was a woman there, dark-haired with glasses. She was holding a folder, and when he tried to lift a hand to the mask covering his face, she glanced at him and the rattle of metal connecting his wrist to the bed frame.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve said, crouching before him and lifting his chin up again.
Tony still hates Ty, Steve's radio is at risk, and Tony goes on tour.
“I think your album is going to be great, Tony,” Steve was saying. “It sounds swell. I don’t normally listen to soft rock, but I’m definitely going to put some of your songs into rotation. I’ve need new jogging music.”
“Oh, darling. My good boy,” Tony groans, stroking Steve tighter.  The sound slips in again. “I’m not stopping you.”
“Yet,” Victor said dryly. Neither of them crossed the room to each other, preferring to keep the leather, wingback chairs between them. “I suppose we should discuss the data then.”
Sam looked at Steve, brows raised pointedly. Steve wouldn’t look away from Tony.
His hands press into Tony's ass cheeks, holding him still as Steve bobs his head down, taking Tony to the back of his mouth like he can't get enough. He moans around Tony, the sound rocking down Tony's cock and up his spine, and those hands shift. His fingers spread Tony open, dip between to rub and test and tease at Tony's entrance.
Rogers bit his lip and shrugged a soldier. “Dessert?”
Stephanie paused, turning to look at Natasha. Being an elf, she was on the tall side, a bit taller than that average male Nord, but still shorter than Stephanie herself. She felt the urge to slouch a little, but Natasha raised a brow as soon as Stephanie had started. She straightened back up.
It takes Steve a moment to realize he’s got Tony’s attention, but he blushes faintly and clears his throat. “He-Hey.” And promptly flushes more at the crack in his voice.
“You will, Anthony,” Maria replied, voice heavy with sorrow. Tony doesn’t trust her. When they brought him market prosthetics, he rejected them all. Howard never visited.
Steve’s expression went tight then he sighed.
“Diet Coke okay?”
“So it sounds like a motorcycle instead of running silent like the others,” Tony mused as he walked up to it and then around it to midpoint. He reached a hand out to smooth his fingers over the industrial material. “Hey, baby,” he crooned, “Daddy’s come to fix you.”
“What the fuck was that?” he asked the empty room. Chills chased their way down Tony’s arms, and he swung his legs over the side of the bed. His dick was still twitching in his pants like he’d actually been having fucking mind blowing sex with Steve.
She gave him a thumbs-up and Steve stretched over to put the empty glass on the drink runner. Tony was talking on stage then, his voice clear to the crowds while the reporter softly spoke over him in Russian.
Tony scowled. “I’m sorry, Mother, am I drinking too much of your fancypants liquor?” He took a long swallow of his drink pointedly.
Tony watched a hummingbird flit about the red-colored feeder hanging outside the largest window, digging further into his bowl. He hummed as he chewed, foot swinging gently. Until it began to slow. He looked down at his cereal, the soggy, distorted colors swirling around his milk. His stomach clenched, and he dropped his spoon into the bowl.
“Would you mind terribly,” Steve begins, searching Tony’s face. They’re on level simply from Tony being on the stool. “If I took you to dinner?”
Tony's grateful.
Steve dragged his gaze up to where Tony’s hand was wrapping around his cock. His eyes darkened as Tony’s fingers swirled around the head, teased at his slit, then spread his precome down his shaft to start stroking himself a bit faster than Steve’s hips were moving.
He'd just made the decision to ask Steve this morning, but he sits now on the plush couch in Steve's apartment, feeling a numbness settling into his bones.
Tony waited until Hogan had driven away, then he suited up and took to the sky. “J?”
“Why do you even own a radio?” Tony growled, dropping into the old recliner Steve kept swearing he was going to replace one day. “Who does that these days?”
It hurts, physically, to watch the Captain get ready, Natasha throwing in a helping hand from time to time. The perfect hair. The newer, nicer clothes that fit and defined and beckoned Tony to snap buttons and reveal skin.
“Please, please, please,” Steve’s whimpering, so Tony eases the sound carefully out and back in a fucking pattern. Further down the bed, Steve’s toes curl and he’s bring up the covers with how tightly he’s winding them around his fists, but his pleas are getting louder, throatier. “I can feel it stretching… It’s so… I feel...open…”
It makes Steve's heart thump painfully in his chest.
“Politics never seemed to be in your wheelhouse, Stark, so you can imagine my disbelief in the rumor mill that you’re planning on running?”
He and his new friend Rhodey got a kick out of playing quarters with it. It wasn’t usually much of topic after a while, though. Until one night, two-thirds of the way into a suitcase of beer, Rhodey rolled his head along the side of the bed to look at Tony.
He squeezed his eyes shut, knocked his forehead against the floor once, then again, then steadied himself. Everything hurt, as it was wont to do during the flu, and he didn’t have the energy to get into his bed, let alone push away memories of the past. Not after the effort he’d exerted to get to the trashcan in the first place. He turned his face towards the television on the wall, peering blearily at the images of the oil tanker exploding. The supertanker that had been scrapped in 2010 shouldn’t have even been in any condition to be in the water, let alone explosion-worthy.
Tony flinched as Howard grabbed his chin roughly, forcing him to meet his father’s gaze. He was very aware of the other men sitting by his father’s desk, but he wouldn’t look that way.
“Get my hands!” Tony gasped, craning his neck to try and spy PIerce around Steve. “Where’s my suit?”
“Go home, Bob. Tell Deadpool I’ll be in touch again,” Iron Man said shortly, striding for the door next.
“Heh, that’s what Rhodey said to me back at MIT,” Tony says, deflecting his nervousness with the joke. Steve’s smile curves a bit more and Tony climbs onto the bed. He busies himself with setting the lube down near the pillows and the case by his thigh where he settles in beside Steve’s hip. He’s careful not to touch too many things as he unzips the case.
It was no wonder the men were quick to degrade her, the women quick to treat her so poorly. She was no prize to be won. She was a beast, as they said, to be feared and crushed down.
Steve flushed a little, but at Tony’s insistence, he began to talk about the grades he taught and the points in history he particularly liked. Tony couldn’t help but hang on every word.
There was a dark tone of amusement curling under Victor’s words, and Tony bared his teeth at the man.
He’s distracted, remember?
“Something’s in our heads,” he said, and he watched Tony look up again, brow furrowed, “And you think you know what happened, don’t you?”
“Well, I would, but I’m telling you that it’s not him. Victor wouldn’t be this needlessly cruel. Whoever is running these fake bots is also running the fake Iron Man, and I bet you… I
Tony fidgeted a little, letting his gaze sweep over Steve’s gray suit, the clean and crisp lines of the pressed fabric. “No, it’s not, but we all have to eat. I’m finding it not such a hardship.” The smile this time felt normal, felt genuine.
down,
Tony pressed their foreheads together, eyes squeezing shut. This was all his fault, but he couldn’t apologize for it, couldn’t tell Steve that he hadn’t really meant to hurt him; he’d just been so angry. He startled at the thought, drawing back as he realized he’d heard that excuse a long time ago from a man he’d once trusted.
Tony, despite his obvious reluctance, let Victor take his glass and settled both elbows on the bartop as he regarded the other man. Victor looked back, hands dipping into his pockets, mildly unimpressed with Tony’s behavior.
“It’s the only thing Jarvis won’t let me access,” Steve continued when Tony hesitated. “Of all the files, all the rooms, and your lab… This case is the only thing he refused me.”
“I’m sure there are plenty of jokes I could make right now,” Steve answered, pushing the cowl of his uniform off his hair as he settled on the other side of the table, “but why don’t we just go with what you can tell me about these compared to the others?”
Not for the first time, Tony had to remind himself that, though Victor had stopped his terrorizing ways, his moral compass was still clearly lacking; especially when it didn’t concern his own citizens. It did mean, however, that something political could have happened while Tony was out unsuccessfully stopping the radiation bomb.
He has to protect Steve.
“Is it any wonder I get smashed at the damn memorials? They love me like they love the circus. Something spectacular. A trainwreck. Nascar cras-”
There are three days left, but Steve knows it doesn't matter anymore. He can see the end coming a mile away, and he’s powerless to stop it. After all the deaths he’s borne witness to, he doesn’t want to stop it. He blinks blearily at the floor then closes his eyes. There is no need to, no need to sleep. He has no will to fight, so rest is pointless, but his body decides otherwise and drags him into sleep.
Steve’s hands fisted in the sheets beside Tony’s shoulders, back bowing with his orgasm as he stuttered out a thrust or two more. He slumped into Tony, pressing sweat into sweat, heat and sticky semen spreading between them.
No, not Tony; it was still Iron Man. There was nothing personal in this act. Wasn’t that the problem?
It drives Tony mindless, hips driving his cock deeper, harder as Steve begins to shake and lose his the stability of his pace. He angles body slightly and gives Tony a groan that sounds more growl and gravel than pleasure, and he feels Steve's cock jerk and pulses between them, coating their stomachs in a mix of cum and sweat.
“Fine.” She stood and smoothed her skirt down before stepping back around the table. “I’ll be back tomorrow to help you get ready.”
“Sam,” Steve admonished, crushing the peanut.
Tony flees to the kitchen and he stands there, gripping the edge of the counter.
“Captain Steven Rogers, born 19-”
Tony said with a humorless laugh,
“Um, I was told there’d be food here?”
Jarvis understands that, while its not explicit consent, it is tentative. So he does the very human concept of giving in, and lifts the suit's hand to Pepper's side. His alloy fingers clutch loosely at the expensive fabric of her blouse, and he hears through multiple speakers the shaky sigh she gives to Tony's mouth.
Tony put a finger against Steve’s mouth, stopping him. “Keep that up, and no, I won’t have time for lunch.”
“Peggy?” Tony blinked. “Peggy
Tony shouted, and his dick twitching in vain, shaking just as fiercely as his arms and legs. He wasn’t given his release, though, prevented it by the ribbon tied around him. He sobbed once, a broken realization that no immediate relief was forthcoming. Steve was too engrossed in the tight, damp skin against his tongue to notice right away that his control was stolen once more as he pulled the ribbon free.
“You put me in ropes and chained me to the floor,” Steve said, dangerously low. “You made me beg.”
“I’m wounded.” Tony grins. “I’ll be the perfect client.”
It was the cast that caused his wounded noise, but Steve was swift to carefully cover it with his hand.
Tony's stomach lurches with a ripple of confusion at first, but his brain quickly snaps back onto the same page as Steve pushes his legs together then shifts forward to straddle him instead.
“Good. Guy was a pain in the ass,” Fury said, sitting back. “I think you’re looking at this all wrong, Tony. They’re supporting you overwhelmingly, your voters. The people don’t want Alexander Pierce anymore. They want Tony Stark. They’re holding you up as a pathway to a better system of government.”
“Don’t worry about him,” Victor announced from a few feet away, “I’ll take care of Pierce’s body. You should take your boyfriend to the hospital.”
“Yeah, yeah he is,” Tony agreed, “When the camps come, he’ll say the same thing.”
“Take it slow,” Steve said without turning around, without enough inflection for Tony to get a read on his mood. He could probably guess, though, and it started with a ‘p’. “You’ve been sedated for four days.”
Carter reached up to rub her temple. “Considering you’re the one who alerted the brass, I’m sure you do. She’s going to have to find her spine if she wants to survive here.”
Steve’s world went a little fuzzy, but he didn’t care because he was sliding into Tony and it was hot and tight and he sounded so good. He slid his hands up from Tony’s ass to map his spine, frowning as the skin beneath his palms felt supple, too smooth. The body in his lap, rocking and grinding was too lithe, too lean, and Natasha’s expression was furrowed in concentration. Her mouth parted on a husky sigh, and it startled Steve enough that he woke up in the quiet of his darkened room.
“There’s a fresh suit in your bathroom. Clean up,” she orders. He stands on shaky legs and slides by her like a scolded dog. “Oh, and Tony?”
“I didn’t like the way Pierce ignored you. I guess I was sorta… making a - a statement?”
Steve flushed, heat sweeping up his neck to his cheeks, and he cleared his throat. He didn’t follow that thread, choosing to hit at the core.
“Quite,” Jarvis replied, “It could mean that perhaps Hydra is aware of your dual identity.”
“Come meet me. I’m going to bring in our strongest weapon,” Ronin interrupted, disappearing in the shadows between buildings.
“This is pointless. Look, you keep going in hard, man, he’s going to keep fighting back just as hard. Trust me, I know. And if neither of you give a shit about the people you’re jerking around, then yeah. They’re gonna keep dying. Why don’t you just leave it to the heroes? Ain’t that what Captain America is for? Or is it a bit harder when he’s in the bad guy’s pocket?”
“You know what I’m capable of. If you have suggestions, then I’m all ears.”
“I do, sir,” Jarvis replied.
“This is all… extremely fascinating and nauseating, but we’ll be going. Yes, brother?” Loki asked, examining his nails.
The crowd was going wild again, the Russian reporter speaking quickly as cameras flashed and questions rang out over each other. One in particular caught Tony’s attention when he’d started for the end of the stage.
Even Steve.
“You were going to take my car to your buddy on Tuesday, but how about Wednesday?”
It had thrown him off balance with the abrupt cease of stimulation, long enough that Pepper had knocked on the door to drag him out for his business lunch.
There's a memory just below the surface of the asset’s thoughts. It sits just out of reach as he moves around the kneeling figure to stand behind her. Red is spilling, falling, curtain-like down her back. She clutches a simple arrow necklace in one of her fists, her hands bound behind her.
“You can’t trust anyone, Stark,” a voice whispered, and it was neither Howard nor Steve, but their mystery magic user, “You’re a good man, trying very hard to be strong in this worthless world. They’ll do nothing but ruin you, even the good Captain.”
Tony had had years of practice at hiding the revulsion that oozed down his spine at the sound of that voice, more than enough that when he lifted his gaze to watch Steve rise from his seat, he appeared merely bemused at being interrupted. He pulled his napkin from his lap as Steve reached out to take Alexander Pierce’s hand.
Two days later, he's moved back to New York. Three days after that, his name and face are displayed across every news station in the country and most of the world. The world boils down to two facts: Howard and Maria Stark are found dead in a car crash, and Anthony Stark steps into the lead role of his father's business.
“Freaks should be hidden! Maybe when the General finds out you ain’t got your stuff, you’ll get the lash! If your freak back doesn’t break their whips!” Varo crowed, and the rest of the men laughed.
"Go on, Tony," Steve encouraged roughly, teeth bared at the derailment of his plans, but he rubbed the ribbon around the o-ring before pressing down on Tony’s tongue. "It tastes like you, doesn't it?"
Steve let him pull away from the kiss, but not his hands. His thumbs stroked along Tony’s jawline as he watched his reflection in Tony’s glasses, but Tony knew that this close, Steve could see through the lenses.
“You’re out of your mind,” Tony scoffed. He shifted his weight, leaning more heavily on the cane in his grasp. Dr. Cho’s nanobytes were amazing, but his knee would still take a few more days to return to normal. He made sure to keep the bed between him and Fury, though Fury hadn’t moved from his position by the door since he’d entered, since he’d given Tony his supposed ultimatum.
“You’re still woozy. Go back to sleep,” Tony commented tiredly.
An excerpt from a fic I'll never write... Tony Stark - random au
“Tell… Steve… I won’t… make dinner,” Tony said then laughed, and laughed until he was throwing up again. It didn’t look like Steve would be making dinner either.
He rolled his shoulders, wrists biting into the edges of the cuffs.
Tony scrambles up onto Steve, moving up to straddle his chest. Steve blinks muzzily up at Tony, both large hands coming up behind Tony to steady him. Tony works his boxers down enough to get them under his balls.
“I’m not going to stand here listening to you put the blame on anyone but yourself. You put yourself here. And despite what you might think, we’re not going to let anyone just waltz in and kill you. So just tell me, are you going to cooperate and open the case or not?”
“You got it all wrong, man. I heard he’s just got something that guy wants. No clue what it is, though. A guy like that don’t exactly need money, ya know?”
His shiny loafers came into Tony’s blurry vision and shoved his face up. He grunted around the cloth gag, curling his fingers into fists behind his back. His ribs ached with the struggle he’d put up against Pierce’s men, and his nose burned with the strong scent of the harbor just beyond the pier. He could almost feel the water lapping at his clothes.
From there, it's a blur of stripped clothing and exposed skin. Steve's mouth is greedy; he takes great pleasure in applying it to almost every inch of Tony's body after they finally make it onto the bed. Tony is left twisting and panting as his nipples are teased to almost painful sensitivity, and a hickey is sucked into the edge of his navel. His cock throbs against Steve's bare chest, smearing precum across his hot skin as Tony grinds up for friction.
“Believe me, darling, we both understand you very well,” Fury said with a soft laugh. Tony drew his gaze from the server to the television where he watched himself speak to a crowd that was waving signs of his name and face back at him.
Tony turned his head, let his mouth catch and slide lazily against Steve’s as they both settled to find their breath.
“I got you, baby,” Steve said, hugging Tony to him to break the cuffs around his wrists. “Doom and Thor are bringing it.”
"I would've jerked myself off until the next man walked in," Steve says, daring Tony with his words, but daring him for what, Tony can't figure out, doesn't want to yet.
“I had to pull Tony out of a very, very important meeting because some men I know don’t understand the meaning of appropriateness. Now, this little display kink the two of you have is all well and good, but when it interferes with the way I run this company…” She lets the threat trail off, and Tony’s cackling on the inside as his boys fall into parade rest. They both look guilty.
“You’ve had a bit of a rough go of it, haven’t you? Mother died in childbirth. Father was distant. Is that why you’ve run away to war?”
“Screw you,” Tony spat.
“Thank you,” Stephanie said softly. “I’ll be fine.”
about that?!”
them. Also, he’s not fucking here, so it doesn’t matter what Steve likes.” With that declaration, Tony turned his back and strode across the green room. He dejectedly picked through a few of the weird assortment of items some intern had thrown into the room according to Tony’s rider. Honestly, he didn’t even remember putting half of this shit on there.
Wanted.
Tony's hearing statics-out for a moment, tuning back in for the grunting, moaning breaths trapped between their mouths, the damp, slick slap of skin on skin, the near-silent creak of expensive bedsprings.
“Eugh, Tony,” Pepper says in return, but she’s smiling and Tony kind of wants her to rub her hands together deviously.
“When what?”
He does the only thing he can think of to protect St-...
"If you wanted to date me yourself, Stark," Steve says, angry and blushing at the same time. "then you should have just asked. I could have done this weeks ago!”
But the world faded out before Steve could respond as, down in the detainment center, Tony jerked awake violently. Wide-eyed and heart racing, he ripped the blanket off the bed and stared in horror at the very obvious wet stain spreading across the SHIELD-issued, blue sweatpants.
“Oh god,” Tony’s shaking, saliva pooling, and all he wants is go down on his knees for Steve while Bucky replaces the plug with his dick. “Oh god.” The plug is turning low and high in pulses and he’s barely watching where they’re going as Pepper drags him into the elevator.
Tony snorted.
“One step closer, and this EMP goes right between your eyes,” Clint warns. The warning is useless as Bucky tackles him out of nowhere. The sound Clint’s head makes against the pavement echoes sickeningly. His struggling is weaker for it, and Tony is mostly forgotten as their fight drags them around the street. Steve can’t find Sam.
“Eff!” Tony jerked and shuddered, tongue shoving against the ring as he tried to say Steve’s name, the grunt of it thick and wet.
“Stop
“Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah. Do it.”
All in the space of ten minutes, he's finished. He stands at the mail bin, a wide-mouthed cloth-cart that holds all the mail that hadn't left the Tower yet. His package sits on top of the mound, addressed to Wakanda. To T'Challa. His hand is now empty. His other fist, though, clutches the neck of a bottle of whiskey.
“Look, I ain’t sayin’ yes, but let me mull it over. There’s gotta be an easier way to go about this. I’ll be in touch about it, but you gotta stay away from those shipments of his. You’re only getting more people killed, and I know. You’re all about the ‘needs of the many’ or whatever shit you like to spout, but those people got families that ain’t ever seein’ them anymore, so if we do this, you’re gonna let those shipments go.”
“I’m try-” But the vibrations drop out and return instantly at the height of their power. Tony’s gone. He slumps forward into Pepper to hide it from the others in the car, mindful enough to keep his hips off of her.
Tony stiffened as Steve stalked up behind him.
Steve settles in beside Tony’s other side and he and Natasha keep Tony tight between them as the lights go down and the movie starts.
Tony hesitated then stepped in closer and pressed the button again to say: “It’s me; may I come up?”
“Avengers, power down and detain,” Steve orders through his com. There are varying degrees of responses.
"Steve?" the name comes out shakily, uncertain and thick as he swallows.
Rogers didn’t say anything back at first, but then, he stepped forward again. This time, there was no mistaking the intent, leaving Tony with the decision too soon.
Steve had been unable to block it out, no matter how hard he’d tried to focus on the mission, and perhaps that’s why he was going in and out of consciousness while people talked above him. If he’d been cognizant enough, he might have found it ironic that he was where Tony had been just a month ago. Except Steve had fucked up and let the small band of smugglers surprise him, using ammunitions he hadn’t encountered before. The bullets had slammed into him, felt like they’d exploded, and sent him reeling off the shipping container he’d been fighting on. The last thing he remembered hearing was Natasha shouting and the distant sound of a helicopter.
If Steve didn’t know better, he’d certainly think those words were mocking.
Tony is quiet for a moment, searching his memory. It sparks and he groans appreciatively. “That silky, short silver piece?”
“You take an awful lot of chances for a villain,” Victor remarked, fingers prodding gently at the jagged wound where the debris had punctured the Variant.
Brandnewfashion said: au where steve puts out an ad looking for a new roommate after bucky moves out to live with natasha. who answers the ad? a recently disowned tony, of course! so the next month or so is probably the most frustrating but hilarious time of steve’s life since he has to teach tony how to do simple household chores, how to grocery shop, etc. etc. and soon they just become very codependent but they don’t realize they’re basically married until bucky comes over for dinner one day and points it out
“So does Tuesday work for you?” Tony asked in a daze and Steve squeezed his hand.
Steve couldn’t breathe for a moment, static whiting out his hearing as the e-stim waved through his system. He rocked mindlessly against Tony’s armored leg, finding vain, endless friction against the unyielding panels and fucking himself through the movements with the plug, no doubt smearing copious amounts of his precum against the usually pristine colors of the suit.
Rogers’ expression twitched minutely, mouth kicking up just slightly. “Mr. Stark, it’s been a while. I wasn’t sure I’d get the pleasure of your company again.”
Going directly to the armory was out of the question. Stephanie was lucky enough to have the blade and shield they gave her not go missing permanently from her fellow cadets. She’d learned to keep the items close by in hopes that dissuaded anyone further.
A familiar weight landed at the foot of his bed, and when he looked, the expensive case holding the Iron Man armor stared back at him accusingly. It gave Steve’s accusing stare a run for its money. But beneath the accusation in Steve’s gaze lurked disappointment and the slant of his shoulders spoke volumes to resignation.
A hand was raised and Iron Man uncrossed his arms with a heavy sigh as he asked: “What, Bob?”
Once they were settled back at home, Tony stood his ground, chin lifted. He doesn’t go back to school that year. Or the next. In the span of those two years, Tony thought he might have seen Howard a grand total of less than ten times.
“I, of all people, should know it’s rude,” Stephanie said through gritted teeth, though her gaze kept darting back to Stark.
“Iron Man doesn’t count,” Tony dismissed himself easily, “He’s an anomaly, like you. I meant violent crimes, groups, mafias, etcetera. Reported crimes are at an all-time low, but you know what’s risen in its place?”
Warmth spread through him, washed away the panic, plunged him into silence.
Victor, on the other hand, wasn’t quite as successful in hiding his perturbation at Tony’s manners. “That was quite plebian of you, Anthony, but nothing short of what I’d expect after the… day you’ve had. May we please address the matter of your blood? More specifically, do I need to call for my physician?”
“You beautiful, beautiful man,” Tony whispered, staring at Steve’s dripping wet form where he knelt beside the soldier’s body.
“I’ll walk with you,” Steve said immediately. He almost saluted Pierce then seemed to make the forceful decision not to. He did nod in acknowledgement and said ‘Sir,” before following Tony out of the café.
“Tony,” Steve cut him off again and stepped back to open the door wider. When Tony didn’t move right away, Steve’s expression softened. “If I had my phone, I would’ve called you anyway. Please, come in.”
“Tony!”
Which would mostly likely occur if he couldn’t get the stop bleeding everywhere. If Crossbones didn’t kill him first. He blinked dazedly up at Crossbones, tipping his head back against the car’s fender.
“Darling Pep, if I hadn’t just had an orgasm, I’d be so turned on by you right now.”
“You got me. Gotta go for the heart-punch, but that’s my point. You’re saving lives too, and you can act like a bad guy all you want, but we both know you’re not. Your revenge isn’t all about revenge. You’re trying to save this city at the same time. Just like we are.”
“Steve would like the tie,” Pepper pointed out, one brow lifting to show she wasn’t impressed with Tony’s tantrum.
And he knows for a fact that Pepper is keeping both of their plugs on a low setting. The dials sit right in front of the wine bottle. There’s no relief for either soldier any time soon.
Fury muttered about the disbelief in his life as he turned away to preserve his sanity. “You’ve got two hours, Mr. Stark, and then I’ll have to
"Yeah," Tony hears himself say, and that spectacularly bad idea expands, contracts, and narrows down to the slide of the man's hand along Tony's shaft then away. "Yeah, I do."
The meeting had run on and on, and the vibrations hadn’t stopped. Tony was pretty sure his mask had been almost perfect, because not once did Pepper kick him under the table. Though, he would have welcomed the distraction.
Tony shook his head slowly in bemusement, turning to shuffle towards the window. He’d found himself standing there more and more, in the same spot he’d seen Steve standing in when he’d first woken up. He tried not to think too far into it. He smiled humorlessly at the glass, his reflection barely visible as he focused on the outside view.
“That was quite a fight for something that only lasted a couple minutes,” the General spoke, tone musing for all it’s orderliness. “How is she?”
Steve flinched, and that was something Tony would play over later, puzzled and defeated. He grabbed at the collar of the armor and dragged Tony forward.
“Tony?” Steve asked slowly.
Tony feels his pulse lurch in his chest. He’s missed the moment. His breath feels tight, eyes burning a little as he looks back up to the others and tries, tries
Tony leaned back against the glass of the elevator carriage and looked down over his shoulder as the hangar came into view.
“Yes,” Rogers said easily, “You have to know that.”
But he was wrong, finding release was a privilege, a gift only bestowed by Tony should Steve earn it. Instead, he was driven to the edge over and over, drawn back until he wanted to scream and cry...and beg. So Steve had locked every muscle up to avoid the temptation of it all. He was stronger than that; he could outlast Tony's game.
“Deal,” Tony replied, beaming over his shoulder at her as he immediately loosened the knot.
He does, however, see the good Captain America calmly shatter the sliding glass door to gain entry into the lab and stalk his way over to where Tony’s standing there, mouth gaping.
“You’re amazing, and one stolen song isn’t going to change that,” Steve said sincerely, leaning down to kiss Tony upside down.
“They were torturing you,” Tony answered, a flat tone used as a mask Steve had learned was to cover any emotion that got the better of him, “and I stopped it.”
And wow. How had Tony been able to notice anything else? He blinks up at him and feels his mouth stretch into a mega-watt smile. “Steve, I presume. Head honcho and tailor extraordinaire?”
Steve’s heart thuds once before he’s jolting forward, vaulting over the furniture to scramble his way up and out to the landing site. He makes it out into the snow-filled air just in time to see Tony disappear over the edge. Bucky stands with his hand stretched out from where he’d pushed Tony.
Tony is reeling, so aroused that the drunkenness seems like an afterthought. He turns his wrist to get a better hold and then shakes Steve's hand off to work the plug himself.
Steve didn’t try to pull away, but he left his arms on his thighs, his hands hanging between his knees. His breath was hot on Tony’s stomach through his shirt as he sighed.
“Damn it.” Tony paused, staring at the naked inner workings of one of his babies. A holistic contract on a section of the carrier meant that only Tony was legally allowed to work on the parts therein. Which meant that whomever had access to both the thorium and the carriers was targeting him specifically. He leaned down, muscles shifting as he dragged up a fresh panel by his own makeshift pulley. Once he had it in position, he began soldering it into place.
“Egotistical. Self-centered. Narcissistic. Puffed up.”
Iron Man paced away, suit clanking in its tread. If Tony could, he’d be rubbing his face. Three wasn’t exactly the turnout he’d been expecting. Things were much harder when he didn’t have Victor to extend the invitations. He felt a brief pang at the cooling of their friendship, but turned back around to face the others.
me with the hands that killed my mother. He
He wants to keep them forever. He wants to be a part of them forever and, if he hadn't been an AI, he'd suspect, too, that this is happening quickly.
Deep down, he hopes he doesn’t wake up.
Tony remained silent, and Steve hummed again.
“The same thing you made me think,” Steve interrupted, words clipped and tone short. His hand had made a fist against the case. “Don’t pretend you’re offended when you lied for months to my face.”
“When?” he heard himself ask and Steve blinked, fingers resting on their tips on the case.
Six years later, Tony ended up at the Superhero Academy. He’s pretty sure it was only because he’s rich. Let’s be honest, they all knew he wasn’t a hero.
Someone IS going through his mail. Someone is seeing the post cards and he's not stupid enough to think that they don't also know who's sending them.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Steve said, much more softly then. “It’s okay. The doctor said it’s going to heal without problems. And maybe only minor therapy. You’ll still be able to play.”
“He’s amazing.
The machine was loud when Howard turned the crank. It cogs and wheels creaked and squealed and Tony had cried and fought against Howard’s hand, struggling to get away until the first touch of cold -
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis replied then went silent as they both went to work.
Two men come into the shop from behind a set of curtains off to the side. They’re both tall, strapping guys, but Tony hones in only on one. The guy on the right is wearing a tank top and toweling at his face and neck.
She says nothing as the elevator stops at Tony’s main office. She says nothing as she helps Tony into the office and gets him sitting down in the closest chair. In between the moment and the next, the plug dies down and Tony’s buried his face in his hands, slumping in the chair.
As for Tony, himself, he tried his best to avoid having to turn up to SHIELD for anything. He usually never had an issue with it, but it seemed like equipment after piece of equipment wanted to malfunction lately. Tony only trusted himself enough to fix each one, so his arrival was expected.
my problem,” Tony snarled. “That was two metric tons of thorium, fucking wasted!”
He meets a handful of Steve's friends, but promises to keep mum about the relationship. "I'm sure they know that I'm not straight," Steve says one night, "but I'm not... I'm not ready to confirm it."
Tony jerked against all of his restraints, a harsh retort scuttled in his throat, but Steve only laughed. He leaned back, keeping his hips close so he could continue to tease Tony with the denim of his jean-covered cock. He ran his hands up and down Tony’s spread thighs, a rumble of approval in his chest. He pushed his hands back down to the vee of Tony’s pelvis, framing Tony’s cock between his hands, thumbs pressing in just below Tony’s balls.
The klaxon alarm is loud, ringing out above the music of the Christmas party before the jovial atmosphere disappears almost instantly. Shutters are already falling down over the Tower windows as the Iron Legion appears on the communal floor to begin escorting the civilians to safety.
Steve laps at him, closes his eyes and takes Tony into his mouth to lick him clean, suck him dry.
“Of course, sir. I have drawn up the usual flight plan. There are three routes to be avoided this afternoon, and their detours have now been programmed into the Variant. The package has been cordoned off as per proper protocol and is ready for pickup at Terminal B, Gate 49.”
“Ha, that’s what she said.”
“I’m getting really tired of your interference, Captain,” Alexander snapped, cocking the hammer on his pistol again. Steve levered himself upward and put himself between Tony and Pierce.
"Tony?" Steve questions as the genius realizes he’s gripping the pad fit to snap it in half. "Do you think she’ll like the restaurant?"
Tony cursed him quite emphatically despite the muffling of his words, but Pierce just laughed, dropping his head back to the pier. He stepped back and waved a hand at the soldier behind him.
“Get suited up and meet me on the tarmac,” he said with no room for arguing. Tony did anyway.
“Stop! That’s not- Could you be serious for one minute?” Steve’s face was bright red, but he was clearly composing himself rather quickly with a hand through his hair.
“Aye, you should, but you were not expecting me, I think?” Stark sounded amused. “Come, walk with me away from this...trash.”
What wasn’t expected was who was there to greet him. Tony didn’t stop in his tracks or slow down in surprise, but he did narrow his eyes behind his sunglasses.
“Ah, of course. Stark, you’re even less accessible than our dear Captain,” Pierce said and made no move to shake Tony’s hand. “Why, I haven’t seen you since the Memorial.”
Tony smiles. “Right. Are you sure you don’t want me to pin you down? I can still get the restraints.”
Steve feels his breath catch at the mournful sigh of his name. The sound rattles around punctured lungs.
“I was thinking the same thing about you,” Steve murmured, “Are you okay?”
“I can’t,” Pepper says, despairing and heartbroken, and she begins tugging at War Machine, as if she could gather him into her arms. “I can’t leave him. I can’t leave either of them. Rhodey… Tony would never forgive me for abandoning Rhodey.”
Tony shrugs, but he answers: "You can stay."
"You want me to go or stay," Steve asks, not allowing any of the awkward dance that usually accompanies a bar pickup.
Following Steve’s instructions and being sure to check everything more than once, it took an hour and a half before Tony was satisfied that Steve’s guts were going to stay exactly where they belonged: in his body. He was drying his hands by the sink when Steve’s arms slid around his waist, followed by the gentle press of Steve’s front against his back. His libido was instantly on board for Steve’s warmth, but Tony tamped it down.
“Noted, sir. Will there be anything else?”
He pressed his head back against his seat for a long moment, eyes closed as he tried to find some semblance of calm. After that, he took off his bracelet and dropped them in the cupholder. His phone caught his attention and he swallowed the immediate lump in his throat.
“Make sure you eat it all up, Master Anthony,” Melissa said smartly, straightening his hair from where she'd messed it. “You have a busy day ahead of you.”
Pepper comes.
“Colonel Rhodes, you must get up.” Her voice echoes through all of their comms, whether the wearers are still conscious or not. Rhodey makes it as far as his knees before his strength gives out, and he’s left relying on the suit and his braces to keep his legs locked in place.
“Yeah… That… I don’t get that. Well, I understand it, I guess. He cleaned up the East Coast, set the precedent for the other zones. He united his country.” But even Steve sounded a little skeptical as he recited something he’d most likely read in his ‘modernization’ dump.
“I’d promise, but we know it’s the nature of the job,” Steve murmured and Tony felt his lips slide against his neck. He dropped his head forward and heard Steve hum in approval. He pressed his hands to the counter and prepared to gently extricate himself from Steve’s embrace.
“No, he wasn’t,” Tony replied, tone warning Clint to let it go. He didn’t need reminding as he dropped his hand.
Like a beast summoned at the mere thought, a low buzz heralded a wave of stimulation that sent the muscles in his thighs and stomach jerking. The sensation rippled out to the rest of his limbs, but his restraints kept him locked in place, unable to shake out the jitters. It left him with no way to ease the tension except to give a low, growling whine that stayed trapped behind the gag clenched between his teeth.
“Call your boyfriend to come get you.”
Tony groaned, making a considering noise afterwards. “Anything visibly broken?”
“And he’s a History teacher,” Tony said, finishing Pepper’s sentence with a mock of her voice. “I hate History.”
"Steve," Tony hears, and he glances at the man who seems as relaxed as Tony  the alcohol would make him.
Steve’s gaze darkened and filled with tears, and he tugged his chair close in, so he could stroke a hand through Tony’s hair. “You’re okay. I promise you. We’ll get through this. He can’t hurt you anymore.”
“Steve,” Tony murmurs.
Steve fumed quietly for a moment before letting out a harsh exhale through his nose. He glanced at Thor and Loki and drew himself up to his full height.
To want to keep forever.
Fox News,
“Excellent,” Scarlet Witch answered, buttoning up her coat. She pulled up her hood, fluffing it over her curls. “Goodbye, Iron Man. We will speak soon.”
Again, the gunshot filled Tony’s ears before anything else. This time, though, it was Pierce that jerked with the impact. It was Pierce that fell backwards, bleeding, letting go of the gun as he landed. Blood flowed from the wound in his forehead, and it was Steve Tony saw with the gun when he fell back against the pier.
The breeze tries to take the slip of paper. And Steve lets it. Lets the words 'Return to Sender' go with the first choked-off sob as he buries his face in his hands.
Tony stared at Victor’s back, the tense and tired lines of it, and in another life, he might have stayed, might have reached out and tried to ease whatever burden was on Victor’s shoulders. Instead, he turned on his heel and marched out. With a snap of his fingers and Jarvis’ assistance, the Variant followed.
“Make the time?”
"Get your goddamn heads out of your asses and pay attention to what the fuck I'm saying to you. Like it or not, you two are on the same goddamn team now. You're going to work together and you’re gonna get along because I said so. Do I make myself clear?”
“You’re right. But it’s not the first time I’ve had a client react,” Steve replies easily. Tony peeks from between his fingers as Steve stands to measure his waist.
“That’s my cue, J. Take the car home?” he asked as the car pulled off the next exit. As it rounded the curve, Tony was already armored up and jetting off through the opening roof in the direction of the airport. The car continued on, the roof reclosing, and directing itself towards home.
“You save everyone you can, and yeah, that’s not always everyone, but I’ve seen all your tapes, all the footage. And God, why can’t you see this yourself?! Tony, you care more than most of the agents in this base. If you didn’t- If you didn’t, you wouldn’t have stopped the doctors.”
Rogers shrugged, no blush coming to his face this time. “I never really got the chance; sick too much, you see, but Bucky did. He used to ride around outside my window when I was stuck in bed. Drove me up the damn wall.”
General Carter watched her leave the tent and, not a moment after, a new voice piped up. Low and husky, the words were muttered from the rear of the tent.
Beyond the wall, Steve is screaming, his throat shredded. He makes himself bleed as he struggles, and Tony casts an absent gaze back at him.
He’s an asshole. He’s such an asshole. Only an asshole would want to risk civilian lives and the safety of his friends just to feel needed, useful.
A heavy hand landed between Tony’s shoulders, pressing him down, down into the mattress. Tony’s gaze was swallowed by the thick blankets beneath him, and the last thing he heard as he blacked out was the sound of Ty’s zipper.
Bold black cuffs made from lambskin and lined in faux red and gold chinchilla fur for Tony’s comfort and his ego. It wasn’t as if he could see it, but Steve knew, and that was the important part. He happened to like those colors; he was rather fond of them on Tony. They currently held Tony’s hands up with his arms spread wide. The hooks rattled against their anchors as he scraped his hands against the brick wall.
“I’m so tired of your interruptions, Iron Man, but we’ll be done with you soon enough,” Crossbones taunted, kicking up a slab of concrete to block Iron Man’s beam. He took aim at Iron Man, fired a grenade and turned to run towards the approaching boat that was speeding towards the shore.
Tony drags his eyes away from the prosthetic up to Bucky’s bemused face. “I am so sorry,” he says immediately. “Oh god. That’s... I’ve just not seen one in action yet. How embarrassing, right? Anyway, I’m sorry. Please don’t tell Pepper.”
It's four months after Steve disappeared, after everything went to hell. It's four months after, and Tony starts receiving post cards of all things.
“Of course, Director Fury,” Rogers agreed, “Two hours is more than enough time to get into trouble and get him home in one piece.”
“Now, let me get you into some armor that actually fits you,” Natasha purred, dragging Stephanie inside.
“Yeah, and like a goddamn idiot I waited for proof. Now, countless more are dead and he’s as good as.”
He dragged the closest bot towards him and pried off the jetpack to get to the panel beneath it. He ripped into it and past the wiring, searching for something that would prove it wasn’t really from Victor. He would know. He would.
“Do you have any idea what you’ve done?” Iron Man seethed at the Captain as he strained to get the suit back to its feet. Tony was barely able to rein in his fury.
“It just so happens that I think the current conductor can’t handle the score and has outgrown his position.”
“You are?” Steve cut in, blinking in surprise.
Tony swears under his breath then bites harder at Steve's mouth, and they kiss again, teeth clacking together with the force of it.
“Their noses are touching, it’s cute,” Steve smiled and kissed Tony’s cheek. “Come on. I’ll carry this back to the Tower, then we can talk more about our date.”
“Hey, asshole!” Tony shouted, and was smugly satisfied when it managed to draw even the littlest of Crossbones’ attention, enough that his masked face turned towards Tony. Tony didn’t even waste time on a snappy one-liner, just fired the shotgun at as point-blank range as he could get.
“You’re coming down, right?” Rogers asked, patiently waiting.
Tony’s expression must still have been murderous, because Steve straightened a little more and lifted his hands to draw Tony down into a soft kiss.
“No, your kind just shuns everything and everyone until you’re alone.” Carter turned in her seat to eye Stark.
Steve's hands massage Tony's thighs for a moment before he follows Tony's line of sight. Tony sees him smirk then wrap one of those hands around himself. He strokes his cock for Tony, drawing his hand slowly up from the heavy set of his balls, along the tight stretch of his shaft, to the very red tip of his cock.
Tony couldn’t move, shuddering and stiff as he peered at Steve through the faceplate. He needed to get away, to protect himself, but he could only watch as Steve ripped the mask away and smiled just as gently.
“Get messy, you mean,” Tony replied, stepping out of the ruins of what used to be the southside of a Staples store.
“I don’t think he’d be disappointed in you now, Tony.” Tony felt the fine hairs around his ear tickle softly with Steve’s breath. “I think he’d be amazed at the empire you’ve built from his name. Yeah, I know. Howard was an asshole, but you’re going to carry the Stark name to the stars, Tony, and that’s all Howard could even dream to do.”
Tony’s heart pounded painfully in his chest, beating a sudden lust through his blood.
Tony couldn’t stop arching his back. He kept pushing against Steve’s hand, pushing into Steve’s mouth. The heat of him, the wet stroke of his tongue, the tightness of his throat. It was maddening, driving Tony higher and higher, until he was left with tremors under his skin that radiated out from every point of contact with Steve.
“All under SHIELD-SI holistic contract two,” Jarvis answered.
“Leave ‘im alone if you know what’s good for you!” She growled and swung her fist. It connected against one of the men's head with a solid
“I will,” Tony promised, “Walk me through what you want done.”
Tony blinked and put his hand in the air above them. The thin, metal fingers spread out and wriggled. “Why red?”
“I can’t help you with your sex life either, not where Stark is concerned. He’s older than you, than me. Maybe he needs a little… help to get things going, yeah? Maybe he’s Asexual. I don’t know. Why don’t you just ask? Have
“I am picking up no disturbances in the makeup of these Doombots. For all intents and purposes, they still scan as Doctor Doom himself. Perhaps if you were able to disable their psy-shielding.”
“I’m just,”
For the next few minutes, Steve circles Tony and asks questions about style and tastes, cuts that he likes, cuts that he doesn’t.
Stephanie had always admired the General. The very ideal of the perfect woman. Average Nord height, pale skin, and eyes that promised the feeling of a win in battle. She was in command, imposing without being brutish and ugly. Stephanie was jealous, and attracted, but mostly envious of what she could never be.
“This isn’t exactly what I pictured,” Tony said dryly, shifting on the booth cushion. He’d given it a wary once over before sitting down and sliding over. The bar they were in was clean enough, he supposed, most likely due to the early hour, but there was a staleness to the air that told the story of countless smokey nights filled with beer and food.
“Fuck,
But she couldn’t sleep that night, either, so she rolled off her pallet -set a little away from the rest of cadets- and walked towards the edge of the camp. The moon was barely out, covered by clouds that moved slowly across the sky, but it didn’t hinder her steps in the slightest. It was a path she knew well; she always walked it on her restless nights.
And Tony’s thrown back in time to
Despite his initial lack of domestic skills, Tony was, above all else, a charmer. And after a month and a half of teaching Tony things like shopping and cleaning and, after the horrid shrunken shirt business, laundry, Steve found it was nice to be able to just relax and watch Tony do what Tony was good at. Charming people.
Two days after that lunch, an explosion took out three terminals in the Fort Worth Meacham International Airport. Tony wasn’t even in the country, let alone Texas, but to his furious realization as he watched the news, the world thought Iron Man was. And by all accounts, he was, but it wasn’t him… Victor played the tapes over, reviewing the footage, as Tony combed through the data the investigators had gathered or left behind.
“He went on a date with Death.” Silence followed his words until Frank grunted.
Steve panted heavily as he dragged himself away from the magnet, heart pounding with the exertion. When the straining effort gave way to breaking the pull of the magnet, he wasn’t quick enough to stall his own motion and ended up flat on his back to stare at the ceiling. Sweat dripped into his eye and he squeezed them shut, shaking his head a little.
Tony hefted the radio above his head to throw it at the wall, but a pair of strong hands slid over his shoulders and up to cup his own hands.
, he thought. Will Robinson’s robot was flailing in his mind, using Fury’s voice as he cried havoc and let loose the dogs of war. It left Tony’s thoughts in shambles from the pillaging hordes, and he settled in a cross-legged position across from Rogers on the other side of the tray.
“Sir, all incoming responders have now been notified about the radiation levels. The first responders here now will also be quarantined. Your suit can withstand another ten minutes, approximately. SHIELD incoming.”
There wasn’t anything he could do now, caught motionless by the drugs that burned just a bit too fast to actually render him unconscious. He’d been through this before, so he’d learned long ago how to zone out from the blinding pain of surgery.  As they cut him open around the embedded fragments of the hollow points he’d been shot with, he forcibly shoved his thoughts away from the noise and the paralysis. It left him with thoughts of Tony, but they were jumbled and blurred too. The dream, their argument, the truth… They all swirled together into a boulder that was beginning to press down, weighing heavily on his conscience.
“Lucky us,” Tony hummed.
“Oh, ha ha,” Sam replied. He folded his arms on the bar edge after putting the glass back and looked up to the television. “I can’t believe he’s actually doing it. That crazy son-of-a-bitch is the only one who could, and he’s still probably going to show up a week from now in a body bag.”
“Get out of my head!” He curled in on himself, hands pressed to his ears, and the tears were leaving sticky trails down his cheeks. His breath shuddered hard through his lips and a gentle weight settled next to him on the bed.
Victor gave a humming sigh and turned to the bar. “If you’re going to make an accusation, then please do so now, so that we may get it out of the way.”
“Well, Captain,” Tony prompted, far too amused than he liked to admit, “shall we?”
That question floated through Steve’s mind, coming out of nowhere like he’d been trying to answer it since the start. He jerked, inhaling sharply, as Tony fisted a gauntlet-covered hand into his hair and
Here is it, ChibiSquirt! I'm so sorry it took so long! I want to thank everyone who has been with me to the end of this journey. Thank you to everyone who helped, who cheerleaded, and my amazing artists.
“T-Tony, ah, we should-” Steve groaned thickly, swallowing when Tony swallowed.
Steve doesn’t brush off the reminder. He knows how serious they both are about the safety of it. He nods once, twice and let’s the air he’d been holding out in a soft, long breath.
“Uh yeah? I aced it so I didn’t have to keep doing it.” Tony snorted like it was obvious, and Pepper just rolled her eyes.
“Tony, why?” Steve had to cover his mouth with his hand, hiding the twitching grin as he watched Tony wring his hands absently. His boyfriend looked down, gestured silently then looked hopefully back up to Steve.
The party itself was the same as usual. Par for the course in Tony’s experience. Certainly, there weren’t many differences in the parties his parents had attended while he was growing up. Everyone was just as snotty, just as entitled. Maybe more drugs these days, but nothing Tony couldn’t handle.
“Oo, I like that last one. Let’s use ‘puffed up’ for today.” Tony sighed, and pushed both hands up under his glasses to rub his eyes. “Alright, fine. Let Victor know I’m on my way.”
“I lost my phone,” Steve interrupted, “It’s probably at the bottom of the Atlantic.” He dropped his hand from the edge of the door. It dragged a little along the wood, a small detail Tony couldn’t help but notice. He bit his bottom lip and fiddled with the cuff of his sleeve.
“Aye, because of me. If it wasn’t for me, your father would’ve drowned you the second you were old enough to speak with that smart mouth of yours.”
“Say you’ll love me for the rest of your life,” Steve murmured, nuzzling at Tony’s nose. Tony hummed. “I gotta lot of love and I don’t wanna let go. Will you still love me-”
Another series of alerts pinged around Tony’s HUD as the Captain and the decimated airport disappeared from view. The pings grated on Tony’s nerves until he growled shortly.
“So, is that a no on the cookies?”
Steve stopped, and Tony turned to face him. Steve was watching him with thoughtful expression. “Will there be a second one?” he asked.
“Ms. Potts?” Steve asks, falling back on titles in the face of uncertainty. Pepper marches up to stand by Tony and she’s in scary boardroom mode. Tony shoves his hands in his pockets and rocks on his heels a little. Bucky stands slowly.
“No need to be so formal, just Thor is fine. Come, come. Turn around, Captain.” Thor spun Steve around easily and clucked his tongue at the bindings, “This is definitely Loki’s work. Just hang on a moment.”
Goddamn lunchtime, and Tony is no longer laughing.
Tony slants forward against the headboard, eyes dark and blown as he watches Steve lick the come from his lips and pushes more into his mouth with his fingers, cleaning off his chin and then carefully cleaning off his face on Tony’s boxers.
They're out of order now. The places and people not telling their story the way they had any more.
“I know,” she said softly, stroking her fingers down along the black, curving lines of the music notes tattooed on Tony’s neck. “I know you’re upset, and I just think… I think you should go. He sounds like a really nice guy. The least of it, you get a dinner with someone who might bore you a little bit. It’s Amara’s, if you want, so you know it’ll be a good dinner.”
“You’ve spent fourteen hours working on this turbine, barely pausing long enough to chew your coffee, and I know that it’s far from your longest binge. It probably doesn’t even rate in your top…” He trailed off, a range on the tip of his tongue, but something in Tony’s expression must have changed his choice. “...your top twenty binges.”
“Weren’t you the one who thought keeping him around was a bad idea? I seem to remember you shoving the number of dead civilians in my face.”

It should have been just a quick, simple meal. It should’ve been no big deal, easy to ignore Rogers’ obvious interest. It should’ve been easy for Tony to remember why all of this, why Rogers, was such a bad idea. Instead, Tony was forced to realize that it wasn’t flying too close to the sun that would be his downfall, but a goddamn take-out box containing fried oreos and ice cream.
Tony bends him over the table and takes him apart with his mouth and fingers. Later, over dinner, they sit and they discuss what Steve wants to try until Steve can talk about it without blushing and they both understand the safety and instructions when performing an act like this.
“I’ll be in touch.” Frank gave Iron Man a nod, holding a hand towards the door. “It’s gotten pretty icy out, so I’ll take you to your motel.”
amazing!”
“I’ll be sure to keep that in mind later,” Rogers said, turning to walk beside Tony as they headed into the elevator that would take them to one the repair hangars. His expression was neutral, but Tony caught the almost nonexistent teasing in the tone of his voice.
When movement in the corridor outside of Stark’s room caught his attention, he knew he’d gotten his wish. Poised on the balls of his feet and aided by the point of his bow, his balance was perfect and still. He wanted to lunge forward into the fray, but the distance was too great and their plan required him to start heading into the city. So, he was left to watching Stark wake up swinging, surely alerted by some program of Jarvis’ or his own instincts bringing him out of sleep with a shock of warning.
Instead of being offended or, worse, a stammering mess, Captain Rogers laughed and flashed his teeth, even and white. Perfect. Tony bit the inside of his cheek, the buccal cavity bumpy and warped from decades of him holding back his words.
“That’s funny,” Tony said, twisting to rip out a few wires, “I thought my mother was dead.”
“Has anyone tried to contact me? Castle or Wanda?” Tony hesitated, but then asked, “Victor?”
“Don’t interrupt me. I care about you and the
“You’ll just make fun of it.”
“I’d say lying to you outright is spine enough,” Stark said. “I don’t like this whole ‘overcome the bully’ mentality. That’s not how my people handle these things.”
“No! There’s no- I don’t have magic!” His fingers let go of the cup, letting the last of its contents splash against the floor as it landed with a soft ‘thwip’. “It was just a dream I had. I was just jok-”
He shudders and Steve’s mouth is a sweet pressure against his temple.
Tony strokes himself once more and shudders. Steve grabs Tony by the hips and shoves him downward until they can flop boneless against each other.
"Good," the man replies and takes his hand away.
He looked up at Steve and sighed, shoulders slumping under his black winter coat.
It felt like forever to Tony until the car smashed into the road below, landing on its hood and jarring every part --broken or not-- of his body. By the time it settled into a rocking motion, he’d blacked out.
Tony’s left hand was flat against the strings and pick-guard as he spoke to his audience. His hand was healed, perfect, and glinting with the engagement band Steve had surprised him with ten minutes earlier.
Tony is away from the desk now, sliding a hand along Pepper's jaw and cupping her face as he kisses her. She's pressing back into the suit, and Jarvis imagines the rustle of her attractive suit catching against his seams and angles. The mechanics of one of his hands twitches, and Pepper breaks the kiss to look down at his hand.
“I’m not here to discuss Captain America. He’s interfered enough, and I lost Crossbones because of it. I’m asking for your help. When it’s time to confront Pierce, can I count on your help?”
“I just want them to…” Steve swallowed, Tony thought he looked terrible. Drawn and exhausted. It was cleared he hadn’t shaved in some time, and his clothes were a wrinkled mess. He was staring at his hands, clasped shakily between his knees. “I just want…”
“I asked you that day in the kitchen if you trusted me,” Steve said, “and you said yes.”
“I think it should be red,” he said.
Clint had died before Tony’s laughter. It had taken the asset two days to fully clean the room, and the whole while, Tony had watched the stages of Steve’s grief and anger closely. He traced the tears with his fingers, let Steve break one with his teeth when he didn’t move his hand away quick enough. Steve continued to struggle, tearing in vain at his own body until he was a bloody, exhausted mess, left to heal overnight.
Tony swipes a few fingers through the pool and wraps them around Steve’s cock.
He could feel Steve’s eyes on him, boring into the side of his face as he continued to not look at him. But in that dream, Tony hadn’t been able to tear his gaze away from Steve. He pushed the images away violently and tried to ignore the tempting aroma of coffee.
Needless to say, Steve and Bucky are both surprised when Tony confronts them in their bedroom that evening.
Bucky is on Tony’s right, forced to sit up much straighter in a chair from the dining room set. His control is being tested more, ensuring that he doesn’t snap the fragile wood of the arms under the strain.
“Oh,” Steve’s voice goes faint just with that simple word. Tony looks up to see Steve staring at the stainless steel set of sounding rods. Each one is gleaming under the bedroom lights, each one sterilized to the point of paranoid cleanliness. Tony wants no risks. “Are they… Is that… Which, um… Which one are you going to use first?”
When Captain America came to the Academy, Tony’s heart stopped. Seeing the legend in real life was intimidating and amazing and Tony might have just been a little in love.
He felt more than heard Steve’s forced, calming inhale and exhale and sipped the steaming drink.
The flames engulfing Crossbones’ head brought Iron Man up short. He cut power to his repulsors, dropping to the ground and bringing his hands up to fire just as Crossbones shot a beam from his face.
“I don’t expect it will be either, will it?” Pierce seemed amused. “You’ve just opened Stark International, I’d assumed that would be keeping you rather busy. Especially with the recent requisitions from SHIELD, and all of your… extracurricular activities. Captain Rogers was correct when he said your time was fairly valuable.”
Tony pursed his mouth, looking at the pitiful, connector-set-looking cart.
“No,” the asset corrects flatly, “he didn’t.”
“Deal’s a deal, then,” Tony had murmured, rolling to his feet as Steve moved out of the way.
“You dreamt about me,” Tony mused quietly.
The belt was tight, constricting. If Steve shifted too much, he could feel his muscles tense and tremble against the expensive leather that connected his biceps and stretched across his back. It creaked with each movement, each heave of his chest as he sucked in angry breath after angry breath. The ropes were another distraction altogether. Hooked to the belt wrapped around his throat, the main length of rope dragged at his head, arched his back, and attached him to the cane rod shoved behind his knees.
"So you understand, right?" Steve says, looking pained in a way that Tony can't tell if it's genuine or not. "I can't make her do this alone, Tony. I've always loved her, you see, and now that... Now that she's pregnant... Peggy and I-"
“It would be unwise to draw attention to this discovery, sir,” the AI admonished, and Tony inhaled deeply as he tried to count back from ten to calm down.
“Go ahead and lie back at the pillows,” Tony murmurs against Steve’s mouth, letting his lip catch and drag along Steve’s. “I’m going to get cleaned up and bring everything out, okay?”
Rogers was watching Tony with a softer, half smile. “What an asshole.”
The stage and podium were still empty, but it was easy to see Tony’s influence on the set and display. Simple and tasteful overall, the feeling --while not modest-- was respectful and classy. Steve huffed to the tumbler in front of him, the corner of his mouth ticking up in bemusement, and knocked back the shot of alcohol that threatened to burn out his nose hairs just from the ethanol aroma alone.
It’d only been a month and a half since Tony had answered his ad when Bucky moved out, but apparently that was long enough for Tony to settle in, make a home out of something that had once scared him more than he’d admit.
“I didn’t see you telling that freak no, either.”
“Why don’t we start with who started the fight, cadet?”
- choking him briefly, before he finally, finally, managed to breathe properly. He slumped to the floor, careful not to tip over the trash can as he moved. He pressed his forehead to the hardwood and drew shaky breath after shaky breath, sucking in air greedily while the news feed continued in the background. His sheet slid off the bed, puddling just out of reach.
There’s a new tailor in town and Tony’s heard nothing but good things. Even Rhodey has given the guy his hard-won approval when he comes to the next military fundraiser dressed to the nines in expensive fabric.
Tony’s throat worked, the words piling up behind a sluggish tongue. He’d felt this before, this numb, pervasive lull, like a sweet, cloying web that bound and enticed. He loathed it. He hadn’t even noticed the hint of it in his cider. He should’ve stuck with the champagne.
“We’re supposed to be helping the community,” he replied, going around Tony to crouch down and look.
People.
“Such a-such a pervert,” Tony teased breathlessly, smacking at Steve’s shoulder before dropping his hand to tiptoe his fingers down his own stomach.
“Next time, baby,” Steve promised, the words pushing back hot against his face, “I’m going to fuck your mouth through this o-ring. It’s going to be your lips I’m bruising instead of my thighs on this goddamn table. I know it’s what you want, you want to give in and let me take it. That’s why you can’t keep your fantasies. That’s why you turn them over to me, and we end up right back here.”
Words Tony recognized as his own. Love songs and promises and heated whispers that left bruises and marks in the soft flesh of his soul and left him craving more and more.
Tony’s muscles twitched, his stomach hitching with a caught breath. “Liar. I’ll miss you as soon as the bus doors close.”
“I see you’re in good hands,” Tony remarks, leaning against the counter.
Pierce’s expression went through several twitches before it settled in a pinched, but polite, smile.
“For now, Mr. Rogers. For now.”
“It’s weird,” Steve whines immediately and he tosses his head to the side. His hands clench in the covers. “But good. So good. Tony, touch me, please.”
“If you want to say no, it’s fine. I understand that it’s pr-” Steve stops and his fingers are biting white-knuckled into the table’s edge. “Okay?” he echoes.
“St-” Tony choked as he pulled his hand free and let the friction of Steve’s muscles drag against his cock. He tangled his hand into Steve’s hair and slanted their mouths together. Steve’s pace picked up, almost harsh in the smack of skin on skin. The kiss broke the tender skin of Steve’s lip, but Tony’s tongue was quickly chasing away the pain.
The man's hand is as large and warm as promised, unhesitating as it fists Tony's cock and pumps him to fully hard in a surprisingly short amount of time considering the volume liquor Tony's consumed this evening.
“Hey,” Tony called out muzzily, “can you bake cookies?”
Steve blinked at the portal and silver-masked man standing before it. His expression went hard, gaze narrowed, and he widened his stance.
Steve had no choice but to bury his hands in Tony's hair, to mess it up and finally make Tony less than perfect. He pulled Tony up by his hair to lick and nip at his swollen and damp lips. He worried his teeth at the chapped bow of Tony's lower lip until it split. The result colored their kiss with the sharp tang of blood, and Tony grunted, pressing the heel of his hand against Steve's pelvis. He didn't jerk out of the kiss, spreading the blood along their tongues instead.
“Forgive me, Captain, I’ve forgotten the introductions,” Victor said, lifting a hand in an easy shrug, “This is Thor, son of Odin. He’s come to solve the little problem of Anthony’s copycat.”
Tony’s stomach fluttered.
Tony looked over his shoulder and the unknown agent was walking up the ramp of the jet. He inhaled sharply, determined. All he needed was a head start. He whipped around and went up on his toes to grip Steve's face through the cowl and kiss him with everything he had.
Tony catches the scent of tequila and lime on the breath that fans across his cheeks, and he wants to snort at the man's choice in beverages, because margaritas, really? But he's only groaning again as the man shoves his other arm between Tony and the wall to drag Tony's ass back against that cock.
Emotions.
Tony’s expression twisted, lip curling just a little. Betrayal was poised to be a heavy stone in his gut. “Victor, are you doing this? Are you helping Pierce? Did you tell him who I was?”
Steve’s fingers curl over the datapad for a moment and Tony’s scrounging for what he could’ve left out that would make Steve react this way. When Steve finally moves his hand, Tony wildly expects to see something strangely vanilla like nipple-play or orgasm denial.
Tony’s gaze snapped down to Rogers’ face, heart stuttering for just a moment when he fully registered what had just happened. “I’m… Yeah, I’m fine, Captain,” he replied slowly, even as he hastily clambered up the side of the turbine to get to the top of the crane. Wench intact, he began to draw the pulley back up along the splintered cabling just enough that Rogers could duck out from the panel and help guide the pulley to the ground. The panel was discarded off to the side, warped beyond a simple fix. Tony would have to take a sledgehammer to it later.
“It was discussed,” Tony replied with a nonchalant shrug, “but nothing has been formally declared.”
The screaming then was not Tony, but civilians. Jarvis was in his ear, staticky and broken, worrying after his health and letting him know that SHIELD was on the scene now to maintain and contain. Which was good, because Tony felt like death inside the suit, pale and wet with fear and sweat. Everything hurt, but nothing more than his head. It pounded at the assault he’d been forced through, and it seemed too much an effort to pick himself up.
He tested into MIT when he turned twelve. And by the time the first day of the school year rolled around, he’d made himself his own prosthetic. It was silver and more Terminator than functional, but it was the first project he’d finished on his own that worked flawlessly.
The post cards don't come with any other identifying markings. Just Tony's name and address and, honestly, he's surprised they get to him. He's surprised that anyone going through his mail wouldn't immediately throw them away.
Tony smiled slightly as the memory of that day filled him with warmth. He was distracted by it enough that he didn’t realize the demo had finally finished, and Ty was fixing his seat to fully face Tony again.
Steve’s expression lost all semblance of ‘Steve’, taking on the sterner lines of Captain America.
Nightmares of colors streaking out from his fingertips and changing the world, but it was never for the better.
"It was never about Barnes," Tony continues, and he touches Steve's chin, creates a new path for the blood. It trickles down his wrist. "He'll pay for what he became, just as I will before I'm through. But you, Steve..."
He learned enough over the years that if he played his personality large and loud, no one paid too close attention to the gauntlet that never left his hand. They don’t ask the questions they should, and they never look too closely to the dark circles under Tony’s eyes.
The resulting explosion was massive, the force of it tearing through the few scattered trees. It slammed into them, though Tony could’ve sworn there was a shimmer of green in the push. Steve shoved himself in front of Tony, for the little good it did. The impact was strong enough that they both were thrown backwards. Steve hit a car on the other side of the road while Tony came to a stop a block and a half down.
“I was thinking sushi for dinner.”
“Safety Protocol 44 has been activated,” Friday announces, and Steve is instantly frozen.
Steve didn't think Tony cared; he'd offer to clean it off if he had to, drag his tongue over every filthy inch of the suit until Tony was pleased and let him come. He would eventually have no choice but to beg, finally realizing then that he had no way to tell Tony to stop, that all he could do was break all of the restraints and
He had to stop Ty. Ty had no right to talk about Steve. Ty’s hand slipped over Tony’s hands, fingers tightening. The bones ground together, and Tony’s heart stuttered.
“Oh, well geez,” Rogers laughed softly, reaching back to rub the back of his neck, “I certainly hope I can come up with better questions than that.”
He couldn't miss the flash of surprise, then realization, then resignation. The phantom weight of a ring disappeared from Steve's hand as Tony rubbed his hand along his pants, and how did he even get out of his room?
Tony walks further into the room and shrugs out of his blazer, handing it off to Steve before leaning over a side table to look at some sketches.
“You’ve been so quiet, I almost forgot you were here.”
“No sign of anything other than the requisition pieces for SHIELD, and I had plenty of time to look. He was so fucking out of it. I thought I was going to have to take him to the hospital. I’ve never seen someone hit with the flu like that in this era. Didn’t you guys cure this shit?”
Cap 3 spoilers ahead.
amazing,” Steve said with a shake of his head and went to kiss Tony again.
“No!” He snarled, shaking his palm once to let the EMP drop to the pavement. He stalked forward. “I'm in control now, so stay down where I put you.”
A single sob breaks past the dam of his clenched teeth and he sinks to a crouch in front of the counter. His fingers feel bloodless as they continue to grip the edge, and he shoves his forehead against the cabinet doors.
A moot point, Tony knew, but he tended to focus on those. Another video feed overtook the current news station, and he watched as Captain America caught Iron Man by the ankle and threw him into one of the smoking containers remaining on the
“Gotta make a… trap… a magic trap… A trap for...  for magic... “ Tony’s head disappeared in the trash can again, and he dry-heaved, hands trembling against the hard plastic. “Sensors… deprivation… Dead zone…”
Tony blinks and then his mouth quirks.
Maria cradled him closer, kissing at his forehead and wiping at his cheeks.
“Thanks, J,” Tony ground out, not even paying attention to where the missile exploded behind him. He banked to the left again, leading the fake armor behind him on a merry chase around the water’s edge of The Port Authority, “How much longer until the dead zone is ready?”
“Well, sometimes a man has to make time for the important things,” Steve answered and indicated Tony with an open hand, “I try not to miss a lunch date when my boyfriend’s time is so valuable. I’m sure you know how it is.”
The line went dead, and Tony wanted to hit his head against a wall, but he’d have to remember to do that later.
“I can’t do that, Rogers,” he replied just as calmly. “I open that case and there’s no going back.”
“I don’t want to embarrass them,” she decides and Tony leans back against his desk as he adjusts his tie. “They need to learn restraint.”
“You will always be Titanborn,” Natasha said, cutting her off. She opened a chest near the forge flame and hefted out large weapon.
That brought Tony’s heart back online with a shuddering, angry beat. He bit into his cheek and reminded himself what it would feel like when he put his fist through the man’s poster-like smile.
Steve swallows, parts his lips and wets them once as he meets Tony's gaze. Tony stiffens, hand moving almost in a blur as little "un un"s break through his held breath.
Tony let his press smile slide across his face for all that it hurt him physically. “You should’ve left me on the side of the road, Rogers.”
A smear of red, black, and gold was the first sight to greet him when Steve managed to pry his eyes open. For a moment, he was confused, and when he realized what he was looking at, his heart beat gave him away on the monitor above his head as his sense kicked into alert.
“-nd she refused to do the exam! I had to fail her, and she had the nerve to blame me for it. I tell you, kids these days do not respect teachers. It’s not like I’m getting paid a lot to do this. I genuinely want to help them learn.”
Pepper is also less than amused, cutting Tony glances over and over like she can see into his soul and find out that he was incredibly aroused and quite possibly leaking coveted supersoldier jizz all over his briefs.
“Wait, you wanted to meet me? Why?”
“No dates. No sex. We’re just-”
, because I quite like her.”
“It’s not like that,” Steve said. “We just click.”
“I finally fixed the dryer, by the way,” Tony said at one point out of the blue. “I guess after the third time banging against the washer, the drum finally went out of balance.”
He dropped his gaze to the nameplate on Ty’s desk:
He tried not to think about how open and exposed it all made him, kneeling in the center of Tony’s lab. Though, he wasn’t entirely sure how he’d gotten there so quickly from the Louvre Museum. The rod was thick and long enough to extend out a foot from either side of Steve and was secured to bolts in the floor via another set of ropes. The restraints bit into his skin, abrading but not bruising.
Tony scowled and bit out, “I guess all private conversations weren’t so private either.” That hurt more than it should have, adding another layer of betrayal to the growing stack between him and Steve.
“That’s it, baby,” Tony ground out, smoothing one hand up a tensing thigh. He curled his fingers, letting the nails bite into the muscle in sharp, bright sparks of pleasure. Steve tensed, trembled, and moaned, and kept moaning, unable to stop when Tony finally, finally wrapped his hand around Steve’s cock and stroked him, fast and relentless.
"Difference being, you weren't leaving alone tonight no matter what, were you?" Tony asks, tipping his chin up to bite at Steve's lip. There's a strange curl of possessiveness in Tony's gut. He can't ignore it. "I could have left, come back here and gotten shitty sleep all by myself. That wasn't an option for you, though, was it? I'm surprised you lasted as long as you did."
“Videos are beginning to hit the internet, sir. The Doombots are spreading out between 14th and 11th, and they’ve disabled the I78.”
He blinked, a slow close of his eyes that steadied him with the soft exhale of agitation. Victor was right, not that Tony would ever say those words out loud, but Tony could use a little relaxation. He’d see the data with a clearer head, and then he could get the fuck out of Latveria and maybe actually visit Pepper for once. When he opened them again, he regarded Victor almost boredly. Victor always did have a way with his tongue.
“I’m stopping you,” the Captain ground out and Iron Man threw his head forward into the Captain’s, using a palm against his chest to help shoot the Captain away.
Tony startled as two bots were dropped on the table in front of him, and he blinked at them through the screen of data he’d been viewing. The sounds of the SHIELD employees going about their day drowned out again as the door to his claimed lab finally slid shut again.
“I’m quivering in anticipation,” Tony says absently, mostly true actually. He’s been dying to see this ‘miracle tailor’ in action. “Do you tailor, Sam?”
He follows the almost-haunting melody, a song he isn’t sure he knows, to the far end of the hall and a door that is slightly ajar. He pushes the door open, resting against the jamb, and there. That same glass of liquor, shining crystalline amber atop the piano and shimmering lightly as Tony’s fingers sweeps over the keys.
Ty’s body was concrete on his legs. Tony screamed.
“Just vodka?” Sam eyed Steve, skepticism practically dripping from him.
"But you didn't turn me down," Steve says, smug and confident, as he lowers himself onto Tony. He goes slowly, the fat head of Tony's cock stretching him open on the flare. He pauses as if enjoying the initial burn of it, then Tony is enveloped completely in a roll of Steve's hips.
So he sat for his Academy ID photo, working out the latest kink in the repulsor in his hand.
"You came to the bar to get fucked tonight," Tony says against Steve's mouth. The words could almost be accusing if they hadn't just met, accompanied by the wet sound of the hard plastic stretching Steve open over and over.
flinch, then rallied himself once more.
“You know,” Stephanie said as she let Natasha lead her towards the armory. “My name isn’t actually Titanborn. It’s Ro-”
Steve doesn't seem to mind in the slightest, dragging his tongue down the trail of Tony's hair leading to his groin.
And that certainly gets their attention. They instantly hem and haw, and Pepper merely arches a brow.
Steve kept Tony balanced that way with his arm, thrust back into every twist downward and gripped his flank hard enough to bruise. “You weren’t wrong,” Steve panted, “I do like this color on you too.”
“Calm down, Sam,” Steve laughed, “It’s just vodka.”
“Steve,” Tony said, voice breaking, as he looked back up at him.
If he does, his heart hurts, his emotions leak into the sketches.
“Stark, I’m not sure that’s necessary,” Director Fury butted in, and Tony watched Rogers’ smile flicker.
“Afraid of me dying on Latverian soil, Doom?” Tony smirked, saluting Victor with his drink before taking another healthy -or unhealthy- swallow. “Don’t worry; I’m made of stronger stuff than that. Debris just tore through the webbing. It’s not quite up to snuff yet.”
“The dead zone is now activated. Cordoning both Crossbones and the imposter inside the square will render them inactive.” Jarvis illuminated the square, a mere twenty feet or so away from where Crossbone was pushing himself out of the rubble. The mask he’d been wearing was burnt away, revealing a heavily scarred face with tendrils of smoke wafting up and away into the smoke still in the air.
“I know she wouldn’t.”
Tony hid his smile behind his coffee mug as he lifted it to his mouth. True to Steve’s word, his foot was casually displacing the expensive fabric of Tony’s slacks, rucking up the leg to press against Tony’s calf.
“This isn't real! Wake up,” Tony snapped, “I don't w-”
Tony swore viciously and shot off towards the closest connected plane. Panels all along his suit opened and flared, sending out hundreds of projectiles that expanded and thrummed into life. They slammed along the side of the plane as Tony severed the jet bridge and then, all together, they began to push the plane towards the other.
against his side.
“Are we sure that’s what it is?” Tony asked, throwing strings of information from one screen to the other. All of the entry points were arranging and ordering themselves according to an equation he and Jarvis had put together. “I’m pretty sure that’s our super, and I’m not so sure that they’re copycatting the suit. I think-wait! Pause that!”
“He’s obviously not that big of a problem. After all, I’m still on my way.”
Tony watched him leave and knew he, himself, was neither Atlas nor Zeus. He was only a man, after all; Icarus, who was doomed to fall beneath the exhilaration of his flight and drown in the sea of regret. He turned and began to work on getting the damaged panel back off the turbine, ignoring the phantom sensation of melting wax dripping down his spine.
Tony smirks, and Steve’s letting him go to face Pepper.
Not when Rogers’ blue eyes caused a phantom sensation of fingers in his hair and reminded him of brightly-colored Fruity Pebbles. The strange thing was, just as he went to open his mouth or step back or
“Why do I have to wear the tie?” Tony complained. “I’m one of the guests of honor! I should wear what I want!”
He couldn’t stop Tony’s name spilling from his lips, chapped and red from the gag and Steve’s own teeth, over and over. His name was a plea, a curse, a wish, his touch a benediction. He felt Tony’s body tense beneath him, felt him start to meet each of Steve’s thrusts downward, and felt the first intense throb of Tony’s orgasm against his prostate.
Tony watched Steve’s throat bob, watched his gaze dart from the suit, to Tony’s hands, back up to Tony’s face.
“Stop! I don’t care!” Tony snapped, gaze flashing angrily up to Pepper. “None of it matters, don’t you get it? He broke my goddamn heart, so what?! I’m more fucking pissed that he stole my goddamn song. I don’t give a good fuck about my heart.”
“Don’t think so,” Crossbones cut him off, dragging Tony up by the throat until they were upright and Tony’s feet weren’t touching the ground. All the blood rushed downward to his knee and leg until Tony felt dizzy with agony. Instinctively, he grabbed at Crossbones’ arm, trying to free himself from his grip.
“Yes?”
“Doctor Doom has not received your messages, sir,” Jarvis informed him through the fight, “and Doctor Banner is insisting only that they’re well. It would be interesting to note that Doctor Banner’s location is no longer Latveria.”
Tony gets one hand in Steve's hair and fists the blonde strands until he can tug. He doesn't know if it's gentle or not, but Steve only hums against his pubic bone, so Tony doesn't give a shit.
“Jarvis,” and Tony hated how rough his voice was, how truthful it was in the wake of Steve’s surprise assault. The suit didn’t move for a brief moment, before it disassembled and collected itself inside the case. It shut and locked neatly after itself, waiting for Steve’s possession as he finally moved away from Tony.
There was a soft chuckle and a ruffle of Tony's hair before she sat his food in front of him. Beneath the table, Tony kicked his leg, but only slightly, because he was six in two days, and six-year-olds were meant to be above that sort of childish behavior. But he delighted in the colors of the light matching his Fruity Pebbles, an indulgence his mother let him have.
“The news’ always painting Iron Man like it’s all his fault. Clearly it’s not. It’s obvious he’s trying to stop even worse people, right? I mean, he saved my mom’s life in DC. If it hadn’t been for him, she’d have died at the airport, and everyone on that plane along with her.”
Tony was sure his expression was warily puzzled, but he shifted back to his ass and slid over the edge again.  Instead of having to brace for impact like before, Rogers snagged him almost too easily by the hips to deposit him gently on the floor. His hands lingered, warm and
“Poor bastard,” Tony muttered. Case files spread out across the HUD for Tony to poke through.
He might not have been strong enough not to cry, but he was smart enough to hide it.
“Tony, we have to bring this guy down. Who knows what else he did to us.” Steve rubbed his hands over his face, feeling a weighted frustration bearing down on his shoulders.
Rogers smiled, another small thing. “You’re right about that, too. You should probably get cleaned up. I don’t know many restaurants that’d let you in looking like that.”
The champagne was flowing freely, among other things, and Tony was just about to finish his last glass and find Pepper. He’d sworn that’s where he was going, following the sound of her soft laughter. But suddenly, he was in a completely different room, a warm mouth on his and hands sliding up under his shirt.
“Stop.”
Shock rippled visibly through the crowd, confusion rising in tides and murmurs as Tony looked gravely from the crowd to directly at the camera. For just a moment, Steve felt Tony was looking solely at him. His gaze was dark and solemn, decisive.
“Using SI-funded research materials,” Jarvis continued, “mixtures resembling and/or related to combinations of squid brine and antifreeze solutions were successfully engineered to revive Captain Rogers, effectively ‘defrosting’ him, as the news stations dubbed it.”
“Ten, nine, eight, seven…” Tony starts counting backwards, trying to calm the rising panic in his chest. He would absolutely give anything for an alien to come busting through the windows, Doombots to try and take over the city. He’d give anything to break up the party.
“No, I think I can keep still enough,” Steve promises, golden lashes fluttering. Tony strokes his fingers back through Steve’s damp hair and then down his neck and across his shoulders. Soothing passes that successfully have Steve’s shoulders loosening as he breathes out a much more relaxed breath. “I’m ready. I’ve… It’s been driving me crazy all week. Tony, th-”
“I, um…” Steve pushes off his stool and steps towards the table as Tony sits up with a push of his hands. He watches Steve square his shoulders and purposely set the datapad down in front of Tony. He keeps one large hand covering the screen, though, waiting for Tony to look back up. “I want to discuss our topic from the other night.”
Steve wouldn’t let Tony speed up. He pinned Tony’s hips to the bed and made him take his cock in a steady pace. In and out, he watched himself disappear inside Tony’s body, stretching him open.
Two supersoldiers were definitely sneakier than girlfriend number three. He’d never once seen them. But in the middle of being scolded by Pepper in conference number whatever -who honestly was counting at the point, certainly not Tony- the vibrations had gone from 0 - 60 in between breaths. He’d tensed, the sensation rippling up his spine with the warmth of the sun.
