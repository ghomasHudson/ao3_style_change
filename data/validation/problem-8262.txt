"Some agents also look around, but it is more logical with the weather that the six retreated into the tunnel system. You should have the coordinates now."
Tony looked up and looked at the photo again. He still could not make out a familiar face and became increasingly restless.
"Nothing," Rhodey called frantically. Tony saw his buddy battling with several creatures while bullets flew at him.
"The SHIELD files said that during the time, two hundred and twenty-eight people worked in the department. Two were ill. About half of them were not necessarily concerned with the radar. But none of them has a motive to harm the US. All are married, have children or are at least in a relationship, are successful or have many friends. No one is alone, very few have recently suffered severe mental damage. If something happens, you can’t work there. It's about security."
Loudly the sounds came from the many loudspeakers and let Tony at least briefly forget the whole situation. He pulled over a chair and sat down carefully. Interested, he bent over the creature and looked at it more closely.
"So we go, turn against the only rule we’ve got and help the Cap and Rhodes?" Wanda sounded a little anxious, but not necessarily averse to the thought.
A shadow crept over the beach and Steve looked up. But there was nothing to see except a few clouds. Shaking his head, he let his eyes wander again. Suddenly he stopped. There was a cable! A little further behind was a red piece of sheet metal.
I wish you a wonderful rest of the day!
Would love to read something from you, if you can find the time.
"Already in Sokovia?"
Slowly he got up and started walking. He held his shield over his head as a sunscreen, his eyes fixed on the ground in front of him. He searched for traces of the missing. Steve saw sand. Just sand everywhere. The sunlight made the beach seem even brighter than it was anyway. The Captain squinted his eyes so he wasn’t blinded. Angrily he trudged on. It had to be a hint somewhere! Tony was not stupid, he must have done something to show where he was.
"That limits the search for the culprit, but it doesn’t make it much easier. There’re a lot of bad guys over there."
“The fact that we were able to set up three guards resembles a giftedness of the brain. And he could still accept two more orders. But their urge to survive is high. If I had just given the order to head for Philadelphia, they would have arrived there, too. The
So, I hope what Burkwill did makes sense to you. It does for me, but I hope I could deliver that, too.
"Haven't you just noticed what happens when I am given orders?" Burkwill asked sourly.
"You’ve got something new?"
"I know you're not sleeping, mate," Rhodey went on. Tony was still staring at the wooden wall across from him, but he could hear another person slipping against the hallway on the opposite side of the door. He could not understand what was said, just that someone said something to Steve, and Tony froze. He shook his head but said nothing more.
"Fury has provided a safe shelter just south of Boston for us," said Natasha. "He’s checked Tony's statement, and find it appropriate; several agent teams are following us now. In addition, some aircraft are traveling to other cities, because of the distraction."
And how vulnerable Stark was.
"I would go up to seventh best," Natasha interjected, facing the two men. The living room was flooded with sunlight and Tony even had to squint for a moment to avoid being dazzled. Natasha leaned back in her chair and put her hand on her stomach. "My stomach would say it’s the best thing." Tony chuckled. "I can’t believe you didn't invite us if the food was so fantastic."
This was way shorter than I expected it to be. I'll probably be uploading another chapter this week and then at the weekend again.
His brain played pranks on him. He also heard shouts for him, but that was certainly only in his dream, in which he fell again.
"I know people. I know Stark. He thinks he's always trying to save everyone. He had to fly there, doesn’t matter when. Stark is not stupid. He knew that sooner or later he would be needed again. He had to build a new suit after Siberia. Stronger, better of course. He would have flown there even if he had not finished it yet," he paused for a brief moment and watched the others. "Fortunately, I am in the position to know exactly what is going on in the headquarters. That he would finish that day is simple maths."
A beam from Rhodey's hand and one from Visions head shot quickly at the brain, but when it was hit, it just yelled as if in pain, but didn’t go down.
I posted that story on a german page and finished months ago but kind of missed it to post. And since another story I’m working on isn’t finished yet and I’m scared that Avengers 4 will destroy my will to live, I thought, why not post it now? I also was told to post here, so why not.
Then he turned back and ran into the forest. On the beach he would have seen Tony, he would first search in the forest. Cool air hit him directly, as the shadow fell over him. The previous day's storm was like a distant fairytale story. It was very quiet in the forest.
away from that plane, he had to do it. Even if the
"Then let’s go," Tony mumbled more to himself than to the others.
Bucky was right. "Probably everything we do is recorded now to make it perhaps the next big story."
"The biggest problem we’ve got right now is that we don’t know who or what we are dealing with. The creatures obviously didn’t come from Earth. SHIELD agents are already trying to figure out what kind of aliens they are," he said, almost resignedly just looking at Natasha. "The fact is that it interacted with the mind stone. In recent months, we have been able to locate large amounts of energy all over the world more often, which then disappeared almost immediately. Agent Romanoff has heard of it." He pointed to her and Natasha nodded briefly and then spoke for herself.
Bucky shook his head. "He wanted to but didn’t come this morning. I let him sleep because I thought he might need it."
They had done it, the beings were defeated.
Tony sat down on the side of the bed and saw only black for a moment, then his field of vision cleared and he grabbed Steve's arm. Carefully, he set his feet on the cold floor and slipped into shoes that were positioned there. Groaning, he stiffened and staggered, but Steve held him tightly. Reluctantly, he put an arm around Tony, and he let it happen. He immediately sensed the warmth emanating from the other and the strong grip that kept him from falling over. It was a bit difficult at first, but then Tony got used to his own load again and walking was easier. They walked slowly down the hall and got into the elevator, Tony a little more exhausted than he would like to admit.
"Holy ...", Rhodey muttered. Tony nodded. He did not expect that. Burkwill was a psychopath who had not only predicted his own death, and seemed to be okay with it, but also betrayed his own coworkers because they were not smart enough for him. Because they were too dangerous for him. Again, Tony thought of Bucky and immediately recognized what Burkwill meant. Zemo had been one of his co-workers, and Steve's friend was the first victim in search of revenge from his people. Slowly, he put his hand over his mouth. The room was dead quiet and everyone seemed to be thinking.
Then everything happened at once.
There was an empty chair almost at the end of the table. Only when he had sat down someone else moved.
He closed his eyes.
Tony was about to say no, he did not feel like spending more time with Steve, and the fact that the soldier was in Europe more than seventy years ago would not help him, but Natasha stared warningly at him. She was probably right. Probably Steve and he would have to return to a reasonably professional base, even though it could not be like it used to be. But the others needed them both as the people to hold on. Or at least they needed Steve and then Tony's ideas and resources, and Steve got that faster when he worked with him. And worked well.
"And I've never worn braces," the man said, leaning forward. The last thing Tony and the others could see before the transfer stopped was the face of a man who had lost his whole family.
The suit would have had to protect him better in such an explosion and especially had to absorb the fall differently. If he hadn’t stopped working on it abruptly, this mistake would have been noticed during the night and would be resolved the next day. With his hand pressed to the aching rib, Tony finally proped himself against the clean mirror in the elevator. His hand left a sweat stain as it slipped a little.
"But if that's so," Scott spoke Steve’s idea out loud, "then all we have to do is kill the brain, right?"
"You also check this case?"
Steve shook his head. "Just this," he said, pointing to the plane.
Clint and Natasha stayed with Bucky at the plane while the others swarmed out in groups of two or three to search the area.
He felt the guilt that he had not even heard that twenty-four years ago children had been killed by his grenades. He knew it, that was clear. He knew that innocent children were killed in the war every day. But in the middle of a city? In the middle of a maybe even peaceful city?
He turned to his best friend, who watched down on the street. "Quite something out there, right?"
"I'm sorry," he explained, but Tony interrupted him.
"Friendship? He spent three months in fucking where-ever and suddenly came back and said that everything was alright again. And in tow, he has a- "
By the time he left New York and soon after Toms River was faintly visible, Steve breathed nervously. The small town with the hundred thousand inhabitants shone only slightly in comparison to the metropolis behind him.
"Boston, then," he said without a greeting. "I'm surprised you got it so fast, I have to admit." Tony thought he heard some frustration in the psychopath's voice, but he could not properly classify it. "But now that you’re all here, we can start. It's getting boring very quickly on such an old floor."
Expectantly, James Burkwill investigated the room.
It only took a couple of seconds before the unconscious showed the expected reaction. Although Tony Stark was mentally absent, his body wriggled under the hand of the unannounced visitor. Not much longer than necessary, the person held his hand over his mouth and nose, then took it off again. The damaged body below hissed air, but did not wake. Almost relieved, The Person left out a silent sight.
"You should have done the ‘being-nice’ before, so shut it," Tony pressed back, trying to escape. He could tell by the weight in his shoulder that the severed hand was still inside of him. Suddenly a loud noise came from behind him. He managed to turn his head enough that he could see the two smaller aliens fall over simultaneously. His brain worked. Did they just kill their own brain because it was ... overstrained?
"No," Vision contradicted. "Excuse me, but I do not need a comfortable bed. It is most logical if you occupy all the beds and I stay here in the living room if there are only six correct sleeping places."
Tony saw Natasha and Clint exchange two looks that meant something to them, while he could only nod. Vision was right. Burkwill would get in touch, soon. Fury turned on the screen, probably talking to someone and conferring, before turning back to the camera after almost a minute.
He should not be distracted, because that would mean that he would make mistakes and mistakes could have life-threatening consequences.
That he had kept that secret from him, what Bucky did
But I want to tell you something else, Stark." The voice paused and laughed softly.
"Come on, Grandpa, get up," Tony said to Steve. He nodded to Rhodes, then walked back to the elevator. Natasha and Steve joined in and the soldier pressed the button to start moving.
"I'm sorry, because ... you know. Siberia."
"Has been in the process of finding out what was nearby that clearing since the conversation. Where the things could come from and where they could have gone. Except for Toms River, of course."
James Burkwill got up and used his three fingers to make sure that a large picture was projected into the center of the room.
"I can land now. You go and help. I'll be right with you in a sec."
Some of his mediators nodded in agreement.
That was the first thing he saw.
For some reason, Tony had hoped he would have a moment of peace after Steve had left, even though he'd been surrounded by a depressing silence for so long in recent days. So, it bothered him that almost immediately several doctors and nurses came storming into the room who all demand answers from him and checked the monitors.
"I'm pretty relieved. You don’t know how scared I was about you!"
he asked himself, already answering this question. It's their job.
"Friday?" He asked quietly, though he knew the AI would always be awake. "Is there something new from Tony?"
"You shall bring them here, now!" Burkwill exclaimed in an exaggerated English manner. Still, the monster's paws pressed Tony to his knees, but he braced himself against it. The creature stank of old sweat and Tony could see the mucus flow out of the pores behind the ears. It covered the creature like a second skin and was slowly running down his armor as well, without being washed away by the rain.
Steve and Bucky were sprinting out of the water behind a cover. "There," called the latter. "In the tank."
He felt Steve beside him, who also looked out of the window. The soldier did not seem strained from the few flights of stairs, and that annoyed Tony even more that it made him so tired.
Tony shook his head almost imperceptibly. There was nothing he would rather see than that. He was startled by himself, but the anger kept coming back.
"No," he murmured softly. "No."
"How is Bucky?"
Vision screamed in pain as Burkwill squeezed the knife into his throat. "He endangered everything. He has been protecting you all the time, and, I must admit, even so well that even I have not seen it. Until just now. And he will have to pay for it now. And you will be ashamed all your life that you have let a loyal friend to die."
"How are you? The doctors barely stopped when they informed us about your injuries."
"There," came Rhodey's voice from the coms. "A big thing! It walks out of the ship. That might be the brain!"
"Oh, someone looked up what you've been doing recently," Burkwill said. "Aren't miniature cameras not great? Sorry about the coughing thing, that makes the whole thing a bit uncomfortable."
From his time in college, he knew the Public Garden very well. In the summer he had often written and studied there, sometimes with friends, or those who pretended to be friends.
"The plan makes more sense," he admitted. "You all stay in place; as soon as Burkwill announces something, turn us in and we'll create a plan. Until then, we'll just send our agents through the city, maybe they'll finally find something, but you'll stay calm. Sleep well, until he gives real tips, rest. We need you ready for action."
"I'm sorry," he said. "Take care of the stone."
"We'll fly for another five minutes and then take another few minutes to get in front of the cameras. Nevertheless, you are already straightening your tie. Why would you do that if you are not restless?"
But when the flying ship slowly appeared across the Atlantic, they had to intervene.
His friend had been right next to him during the blast, why was not he here now? The huge force had destroyed the whole tank, including the inside. A shiver ran down Tony's back; he remembered that Rhodey had been a little closer to the vehicle. Frantically, he tore his head to the side as far as his shoulder allowed. His eyes fell on Natasha, who said something he could not hear. She looked tense, but clearly spoke something reassuring. Steve's arm tightened around his chest. The ground was muddy and slippery and Tony almost fell if the two had not grabbed him. He felt more and more blood dribbling from his wound on his shoulder and felt the hand that Steve pressed on it to stop the bleeding. It hurt, but he felt the warmth that emanated from the other as he felt frozen. He felt the strange desire to run alongside Steve like this for a while, feeling his hand on his shoulder.
Instead, she doubtfully raised an eyebrow, let out a powerful breath, and started talking. "If you say so. Perfect. We need you now."
are not aware of the death of the first
Natasha took a breath and did a dramatic pause. "We thank the United Nations and the United States of America for this opportunity. We will use this privilege and save the world from further disaster as best we can."
"Fantastic as always," he replied quickly. He just didn’t want to talk. He was putting the finishing touches on his new suit, and if he got distracted now, he could make big mistakes.
Wanda had sat up with folded arms and looked worried in the room. Sam also tapped his foot uneasily but shook his head. "I think Steve's mind is to occupied with Tony to discuss his problems," he explained. "Why didn’t you even look in his room?" he asked Bucky.
"On time I would say. Then we can start immediately?"
"Damn it," he cursed, looking around. Tony had to be here, he had to find him.
Tony took a deep breath. His heart beat fast. "I ..." he murmured and stopped.
It took Tony more than an hour to finally fall asleep. Only gradually did the drugs start to work. He rarely slept for two hours at a stretch during the night, because pain and exhaustion were so mixed up that he had nightmares and woke up sweat-drenched.
Steve shrugged. "Not that I know. I didn’t ask about the attack, but rather how he was doing. Lieutenant Rhodes talked to him, though. I thought he already told you everything."
"Well, Tony," Pepper started again after she had greeted someone. "Do you know the New World Millennium Hotel?"
"Only if they had the means," Tony said. "They had one injured and were possibly without food in this tunnel system. They were slow. With three days of runtime and a storm" - Friday had reported the weather of recent days near Trondheim - "they will not have come this far. Where exactly did the signal come from?"
"Okay, we're flying a little bit south now. They’ve got to be somewhere."
"Then it’s their fault if that doesn’t work out now," he finally whispered, pulling the soldier down to him.
Tony felt the salty water running down his cheeks. He turned his head to the floor and slid his hands over his face again. "Fuck," he sniffled.
Steve could not move. He thought he heard Rhodey screaming wildly but was not sure. Tony was gone. He was dead. And the last thing he had ever heard of him was the question of whether he minded his death.
Rhodey nodded. "I stay here in the woods," he finally said. "I've been here for a while, I've searched more. So we don’t search twice. Go to the beach. I'll see you tonight."
Steve could not do that to him now. That was exactly what Burkwill wanted to achieve. He could not leave him behind. Not after all this time. Not this way.
Pictures of Tony were shown in the background, then shots of the flying ship. Shots filmed from a helicopter were cut in to reveal the extent of the battle.
Tony nodded, even though the other man could not see him. His heart throbbed with excitement as his thoughts rolled over. One of his comrades, of his
"If I know something more about the photos, I'll tell you. What are you doing now?"
"We can handle that, Tony," he heard Rhodey's voice close to his ear. He had not noticed that his friend had run to him. Rhodey's hand squeezed his shoulder, but he said nothing. He just nodded, trying to regain his composure. It was not the time to sink in self-pity. Not in front of all the people. His gaze shifted to Barnes, who was still standing motionless in the room.
Fury moved his hand frantically, motioning some agents to locate the source of the signal. Tony was still typing on his phone, trying to save what he could save.
On them was a large weight that restricted all movement and only at second glance, he could see that they were spilt by sand and debris.
"I'd like it if it was true," he mumbled barely audible for Tony. He froze.
Hey! I figured I'd be able to post two times a week. I hope it stays this way, but I certainly think so.
you after you've dismissed the first commando you've got? I don't!", he stated and assuring chuttering broke off quietly.
Slowly they moved forward. Little tanks that they had somehow put on the huge plane did destroy the ship pretty well, but only a fraction of all the struck creatures eventually fell dead to the ground.
Tony remembered the moment when he thought that both the Winter Soldier and Steve had heard the sound of his breaking heart. The worst was not the video, his parents were dead anyway. The worst thing was not even that he now knew they could have survived the accident if Barnes had not been there. The worst part was that Steve knew about it, all the time, not even trying to explain himself. The worst part was when he looked Steve in the eye and knew exactly what they were telling him:
From that moment on he knew what the man meant to Steve and how much Steve meant to the man. He knew the two needed each other, and it would cost a horde of
"It wasn’t my idea," Tony tried to play it down.
"But if anyone hears about it, our freedom of action could be limited," contradicted Vision objectively.
, but the claws were too deep in his skin. Tony screamed loudly and the alien did so, too, but it did not let go. Sweat formed on Tony’s forehead as the mechanic kneeled on the bridge.
On James', for his age, well-kept face, a rare smile spread. The ice-blue eyes lit up.
Most of these boring, untalented people had hoped that Stark would be dead. They all had their meager problems with him and nobody wanted him to be alive.
Tony flew back to the bridge and paused. Vision shifted weakly and straightened up on the last remnant of the transition. "Shit," Tony murmured again and looked around. The aliens on this side of the lake were all rushing in on Steve and Bucky, and the humans had long since taken up the fight against the Avengers and agents on the other side of the lake. Tony landed with a crash next to Vision, who looked at him disoriented.
"You can enlighten us about the information you and Mr Rogers have gathered, and what we know about Wilson, Lang, Miller, Smith, Dragenbach and Khatib." Fury had meanwhile returned to his seat and sat down. Tears came to Tony's eyes, but he was glad he could stand now. Once again, he coughed and then cleared his throat. Rhodey pushed a water down to him.
Tony stared at his friend for a few seconds. He did not want to break his promises, but in the end,  he would have to meet him alone, Tony knew that. But at least for searching him, the others would help. He nodded. "I promise," he answered softly.
Tonight, the therapy would start. The broken arm should be cured by a special procedure within several days so that Tony could use it again and at the latest then the suit should be finished again.
into danger, it was just you and the five poor souls in front of you. But even that wouldn't have been necessary if he had listened more to my orders." Burkwill grinned at Tony and Vision.
The next time he woke up, he was back in the hospital bed he had been lying in a few weeks ago. Carefully, he opened his eyes and tried to understand what he saw.
Everything was quiet for a moment. Then the agents responded professionally. Several of them already ran out of the room before Fury could even scream after them.
- to be able to look at his legs.
"We'll discuss that when we have the psychopath. Now we’ve got work to do," the mechanic answered. More restrained, he pushed away from the warm position and turned to his computer. "Friday, do you have something?"
Panicky Steve dug in the sand. The fear grew bigger and bigger as he just found more sand. Sweat gathered again on his forehead. "Please don’t. Don’t fucking do that to me," he murmured, almost looking like a dog searching for a bone. His hands slid through the damp sand, pulling out only this again and again. His breathing was much too fast now, and he felt stabbed in the lungs.
Rhodey leaned back in his chair and ran his tongue over his lips, but said nothing to his friend.
Sighing, Steve threw himself back at the couch. "It's getting more and more twisted. Has anyone declared to be the offender yet?"
The open third-floor apartment door blew artificial light into the corridor and Tony hurried to get past the last steps. His ribs pounded and pulled, and he wished he had a few more pills with him.
"I'll come too," Natasha said and stood up abruptly.
Steve made a frightened sound, but then their lips rested and fireworks seemed to explode in Tony. He paused for a moment, waiting for a reaction from the other. His heart was pounding almost painfully and the blood rushed in his ears with excitement, as he had not known in years. They were only a few inches apart, but Tony could still feel the slight smile of the other.
"Hmm," Tony nodded and really knew it.
As he passed, he grabbed another apple and walked back to the elevator he had come from a few minutes ago. Natasha watched him with raised eyebrows.
"Stark?" asked Fury and all eyes turned to him. Once again, Tony coughed, the cramping feeling barely vanishing from his throat.
"I said guns down," Tony said to an agent who was still on alert.
He could nowhere see Burkwill but saw that both Steve and Bucky swam through the lake and were protected by Rhodey. Maybe they had seen something, Tony mused and flew to meet them. "Where?" He just shouted, assuming that the others understood what he meant.
She looked at the three Avengers alternately.
Plus, the chapters will get longer, it's just that short for the very first chapter.
"We can’t," he said quickly.
"It also states that camera shots showed that the brain had ears, and thus by appearance alone - not just the size - is different from the other beings."
"Stark will be sought and you have to devote to your own tasks."
"Natasha," Clint asked stunned, ignoring the battlefield, only looking at his best friend.
With his pinky finger he covered the nostrils, while the whole hand was pressed to the mouth. With the other he stroked gently back and forth, down the neck and up again.
"I still believe that signing the agreement would be wrong. I was free to decide, and I did," he replied, looking down into Fury's eye.
"We’ll take a car. The woman lives in New York. "
"He's unconscious," came the news of the flying who immediately tried to get the War Machine behind their own lines.
Tony stared at him. "Can I go to her?" He asked, trying to stay calm.
He got up and took his jacket from the holder and reached for his glasses. He stroked his hair again. They would perform as a team today and they would have to be sovereign. His thoughts had not even drifted to Steve at all, but now he felt that throb in his chest again.
"Come on, we're not here for dinner," Bucky urged, who had already run into the hangar. Clint followed, frowning, looking around. "But we will have to take one of the big planes."
Steve's hand slid over his face. "So someone at the executive level was involved?"
I messed it up. I was selfish, I really didn't think and I mean - like I... I almost killed you." His voice broke in the end and Tony just stared at him silently. He didn’t say anything.
His eyes fell on Rhodey and Steve, and after a moment the smaller one turned away, staring at the agent. The agent wiped his hair from his forehead.
Vision flew around looking for the brain and defeating the monsters whenever he could.
"I have to go through the video with Friday."
He froze. "This is…"
Rhodey laughed. "Now go to sleep. You heard about the meeting tomorrow?"
But he would refuse to ask for help after doing so much in the last few weeks without help, and reached with his good hand for the rotten wooden railing and went slowly ahead.
Steve slowly dropped to his knees. He didn’t even hear sounds around him, blinding everything.
He remembered a run-down part of Brooklyn, which he drove through a few weeks ago. They walked silently up a few steps.
"Incredible," he mumbled.
"Some question how you all were able to be there so quickly. They now question the security systems of the US. Others declare you all should be in prison now. Some warn against further attacks, others are revisiting the old conspiracy theories and sending a lot from Area 51. This has become a popular destination in recent days. A few are waiting for the press conference, but they are also talking about it all day long. The
At that moment, the elevator doors opened and together they got out and headed for Steve's room, where they had been sleeping for two weeks now.
Tony didn’t mean to say that, he wanted the soldier to stay and maybe even comfort him, he wanted it to be the way it used to be. But he knew that wouldn’t work. "Give me the time," he said instead.
"Are you releasing the prisoners now?" He finally asked after a pause but did not turn away from Vision.
to make any noise.
"I'm sorry," Steve explained, turning away.
"We do not know anything yet, what should we say?"
But nothing happened. Only when, after more than ten seconds, the black image slowly lightened, Tony exhaled. He did not know he had been holding his breath, but then he stopped again.
"I'm not here to bring you something to eat," Steve walked over to Tony and leaned against a table a few feet from the man. He studied his teammate. "The therapy was painful?"
Carefully and with watery eyes, he tried to turn his head. It worked to the left, but when he turned the right side the stinging pain passed through him again. He put his head back on the sand and rested.
"Their intelligence goes no further than an average of four commands per
Steve nodded and smiled slightly at Rhodey.
The lack of water and the fever made him shiver in pain and wake up sweating.
Steve looked around. Yes, it was true. Each of the creatures raised his left leg slightly longer than the right, which looked like they were limping. Conversely, the right arm moved forward longer than the left. It looked like they were all the same person.
Clint and Vision were placed next to Rhodey, followed by agents. Tony had seen some of them before, but many were new to him. He could call only a few of them by name. He quickly tried to focus on Fury. The man had hitherto given a brief welcome and summed up the reason why they gathered here. Tony tried to concentrate on it. Surprisingly, he felt a bit uncomfortable with so many different people in the room. His eyes fell on Barnes, who was still staring at the projection, then steered it on to Steve. The soldier looked at him as a tightness settled over his chest again. He felt his throat scratching and felt less air reaching his lungs. He coughed and tried to get rid of the feeling. Fury did not stop in his explanation, but Steve's eyes grew more inquiring as Tony once again put his hand over his mouth and coughed.
Rhodey blew air. "We haven’t achieved nothing, he obviously had."
"The face was familiar to me."
"He won’t let go," Clint cried in panic. He slipped on the wet armor of the Iron Man and Tony had to use both hands to hold the archer. Suddenly the alien let go and the two shot up, relieved with exhalation.
The doctor had tied her hair into a strict braid and now looked at Tony.
"Language," he said uncertainly and came one step closer to the smaller one. Briefly, they both faced each other before Tony, as driven by a sudden impulse, bridged the gap and wrapped his arms around Steve. "I'm sorry," he whispered again. "Let us clarify that afterwards."
"Friday," Tony said loudly, "we still need that."
Steve. We act in the goodwill of the government if we go looking for them."
He shrugged his shoulders. "But be quiet when I work. I’ll have to concentrate."
Vision let his eyes glide through the plane. "No, he has not told me anything yet. He looks somewhat dismissive in the last few days."
Jesus, Google Translate improved well. Took way shorter to translate this than expected. So, that’s kind of nice. I wrote this story a long time ago, actually started like two years ago, right after watching Civil War. Then I made a break somewhere in the middle. The story gets way better once we come to that point. If they first couple of chapters are more like semi-nice, keep in mind it really gets better.
She scrolled down and showed Steve a paragraph written next to a picture of the monster from the movie "Alien." Tony had forced Steve to watch what he considered to be the most important movies he had missed, practically as a homework assignment.
He was about to finish his Mark XLVI, the 46th suit. There might be a time he actually had to suit up again, the guessed. He has not used his armour since the fight, but he had to pass the time somehow. At the beginning, there were Rhodey's legs, afterwards he worked on a variety of small technologies and the suits of Natasha and Rhodey and finally on his very own.
Bucky waved. "Then we have to risk that. I know Steve. He'll look for Stark until he's sure he's alive ... or not." He was quiet for a moment. "But he wants answers. The team would break up without Stark
"Where have you been?" he shouted again, hoping Steve would just leave. But the man was right in front of him now.
Vision had recovered and flew up. Steve could see that he was in pain. "A kind of shield. It seems to be a force field, I cannot get any closer. It must be because of the stone."
He glanced around while Nick Fury got up and projected a picture into the center of the room with a remote control. The table was full of agents and the Avengers that were in town. Rhodey was sitting right beside him, and on the narrow side of the table to Tony's right sat Natasha, whose eyes seemed not only to watch the image in the middle of the room but at the same time Tony. Fury's chair was the one in the middle of the narrow side and next to him sat Maria Hill. Opposite Tony sat Steve, who had changed since Tony saw him for the last time. He seemed more professional now. Barnes and Wanda Maximoff were sitting next to him, both looked spellbound at the picture in the middle of the room.
"That's why I cough?" Tony speculated.
He turned back to his tools, hoping that Natasha would leave him alone, having only tried to do some small talk. A stupid idea, she was not like that at all. She would not sneak into his workshop just to ask how he was.
"I'm sorry," he whispered again, then picked up his wrench and put the last few handles on his new suit.
The desperation came up in the captain as he turned a little. No one among them could fly anymore, no one was able to get to the brain anymore. He tried to figure out if he could throw his shield far and fast enough, but even for him it would be impossible to throw so far with enough force.
Tony felt his mouth go dry. His thoughts skipped. He could not trust any of his comrades to do such an act. He felt his pulse rise and the panic grow in him. He had gotten sick and was about to say Friday that she had to inform Steve, but he knew better.
"Teambuilding", countered Sam but and was already going for the door. "That's exactly what Fury wanted. Do something together, strengthen the team. We can’t be three people less."
"What should I do?" He quickly wiped his eyes.
? Are we, Tones ... Tony?" he corrected himself, pausing. Tony shook his head in confusion, it felt like it had been ages since anyone called him Tones. The last person was Steve - more than three months ago.
"’Is the End of the World Building Up Across Toms River?’," he instead quoted the headline of a newspaper report. "'Aliens - Weapon of the Enemy, Myth or Propaganda?’”, he waited. The people listened carefully to his British accent he took on when he was seven years old. “’Is it for the Election? – An Alliance could turn the Numbers’, 'Danger nearby Philadelphia - World Powers Must Gear Up.'"
"Nothing more than previously thought?" Steve asked, making sure he got the most important parts.
In a sad attempt to attract attention, Tony tried to scream, but the cries for help were little more than a painful scab. He closed his eyes as the pain rushed through his whole chest again. He was thirsty, very thirsty. His arm and head began to hurt again; every breath hurt, he wanted to get away from here. He had known what would happen if he flew away with the alien, yes. And he wouldn’t have had a problem if that would have been his end. But now that he was alive, he wanted to continue to be so.
He had talked to him a third time when Tony had fallen asleep during the day, waking up in his workshop, shivering and sweat-drenched. His thoughts were interspersed with people who called him a murderer and dead friends. Cities had blown up in his dream and he knew perfectly well that it had been his fault. The tears had blocked his view and air had barely gotten into his lungs when the panic did not fade even after waking up. Friday had informed Steve and he had come immediately. By chance, he and Bucky had just been in the elevator, which only opened when the level of the workshop was reached. Tony had sat against the table, sitting on the floor, ignoring the injured man's presence, only feeling the big, warm hands brushing his back slowly and regularly. It was less than ten minutes that passed before Tony had calmed down, but his stomach was rebelling and he spitting out everything that had accumulated in the last few days.
Immediately he saw the plane Friday had started. The little light on the floor was enough for his irritable senses to see, and the adrenaline continued to grow with every step he took. The plane was at the farthest end of the hall, and when Steve got there, he realized that the plane Friday had started was one of Tony's favorite ones.
"Oh, Bucky just came in," Clint explained. "What do you have?"
Steve looked around and decided to head south. He had his shield on his back and he watched attentively.
Tony straightened his shoulders and nodded stiffly. He would not show any weakness now. The screen was still black, but Tony knew that Burkwill could see them all.
would not have gotten out. But we all in this room know what happens; how it feels when innocents die."
Through his cover, Tony could see Vision kneeling in front of the British, several weapons pointed at him and the stone in his head while Burkwill held a knife to his neck. "Come on, tell them why you're here," Burkwill told Vision.
Tony's mouth fell open and he knew Steve was the same. This story of the stranger boy touched him.
wants to know more than we do," she explained. "Look."
"Well, that's interesting," admitted Tony. "Why does the brain have ears?"
"We have to kill it!" he called. "I’ve got to get into the ship quickly. We are getting dangerously close to the city!"
"I wanted to ask you what kind of pizza you wanted,” Steve finally said. “Bucky wanted to order some. We just didn’t know what you wanted anymore."
"So, Massachusetts, then," Barnes said quietly, whispering something to Steve. Tony was glad that he had showered in the morning, now that he was so unexpectedly back among with his people. He saw some of them for the first time in days. Wanda looked absent-minded and tired, and even under Barnes' eyes were dark rings. Steve had been with Tony the day before, or at least it could have been the day before. He did not know anymore. His appearance had not improved. He still looked tired when he got up and said in the round that he was going to change now. As a precaution, who knew what could happen.
It used to be Tony who started.
Tony had heard of this organization many times. It became a big thing less than twenty years ago when he regularly received hate news from them on how he could support the war in the middle east. He had not taken the organization seriously. After all, they did exactly the same as he did. One day, he found his whole house sprayed with graffiti when he came home after a party. He clearly attributed this damage to supporters of the organization, and then had a chat with the CEO of SafetyWorld for press purposes. Nothing came out of it. After all, he had supplied the highest bidder in the war and SafetyWorld had a strong rejection against that, which is why the relationship in the following years progressed rather bad than right. Since leaving the arms industry, Tony had seen little of them, almost ousting the company.
Again, after New York, after Sokovia, after all those places, people have died because of him.
I would love to know what you think about this chapter.
"So, we have a lot of information, but no real material to study," Steve explained, barely holding back the disappointment in his voice. "And,
Tony thought of Steve and Bucky Barnes, who were supposed to be his teammates, actually his family. He wondered how his father would think about the fact that the best friend of his hero, the murderer of himself, was working with his useless son in an avenging team. A bitter smile played around Tony's lips, but he wasn’t happy.
He talked to Pepper
Showering turned out to be difficult; he managed to get away with a plastic bag from his closet around his arm and a small chair he took to the shower.
Steve's eyes narrowed in confusion. "Oh?"
"The alien won’t let go," said the younger of the two men.
For a moment Burkwill was quiet again, but this time he did not grin. This time, Tony even thought of seeing something like sadness in his eyes, but that moment was over quickly. "It would be nice to hear the news that you are no longer among the living, but my people are no better than you. Arrest them before they do anything stupid, most of them cannot do anything else."
It took fifteen minutes before Dum-E, with the help of Tony and an outdated prototype of an Iron Man suit, honed the creature to one of the few open spaces in the workshop.
"We have to get inside the ship. Through one of the entrances there", he began, trying to put aside every thought of his friend.
"Still not," Clint said. "But these monsters couldn’t have acted alone. They didn’t seem to be very intelligent. Someone must’ve hired them and gave them orders."
He would be a good mediator in a few years, James knew that. Because of his unwanted stay far away, he had learned to speak many languages and met some races that most simple-minded people could not even dream of.
For every dead monster, two new ones came after. And Steve had no chance to get inside the plane.
"Yes, I do," Tony whispered back. "This is my fight."
Steve raised the shield when a monster came running toward him with a kind of lance in his hand. Again, Steve waited until the creature was close before him, then he jumped to the side and made a deliberate slap on the monster's neck, which immediately dropped to the ground.
“Stop it," Natasha said then. "I know you find it terrible when someone shows something like friendship to you and you're not at least on an equal position, but can you just shut down your ego a bit now, please?"
"You seem a bit restless," Vision spoke to him.
"It's not just about the money for everyone. Maybe she was afraid that friends would think she was crazy, maybe a psychopath."
Tony flew further into the air. "Friday, can you see the brain?", he shouted to the AI. She scanned but could not give him a result. Again, Tony flew down, killing two of the aliens. The pain in his shoulder was completely forgotten as he manoeuvred himself through trees and avoided the aggressive aliens. At the edge of the park, Tony could see flashing lights that came from cameras.
"Then why did you write that damn letter to him," Rhodey answered, his voice breaking in the end. "Do you have any idea how bad he was?"
It was not until they had explained in detail when Tony had to take which pills, and after another blood test was done, that his bed was pushed through the hospital wing to the elevator and his room.
Burkwill was a little smaller than Tony in his suit, but that did not stop him from getting closer and closer. Tony's jaw jumped together. He stared at the man who had stretched out his left arm and now put it on Tony's armor. He kept staring straight ahead. He was looking for Pepper and the others, but they could be any of those shadows. Or none.
"The last time I woke up like this, Steve, I wanted to eat something," he muttered, feeling the blood loss already. The words were not as fluent as usual. Steve pulled him out of the armor that was assembling and looked at him exhausted. "Nothing has changed."
"Can we move our troops to Boston for sure, Stark?" The director chipped after him.
The agent began to speak as the hologram in the center of the room suddenly dissolved.
"Vision’s coming?" he heard Rhodey ask quietly. His voice sounded tired.
It was a mistake to come here, he kept telling himself. In the mirror above the sink, a man looked at him, whom he did not know. His hands clenched on the edge of the sink as he stared down at his sunken cheeks and strong dark circles underneath his eyes. A bad shaved beard and uncombed, in many places already with grey strands intersected hair grew much too long.
"And not only do you have to train," added the agent, whose name Steve still didn’t know, "but also become the team you once were. Differences must be discussed, but under no circumstances may there be new divisions. The world needs the Avengers the most now."
roared behind Tony and the mechanic winced. Burkwill shouted something in the language of the creature, but Vision already answered Tony.
"Friday, tell me if there's something important. I'll take another look at our lovely friend."
"Some agents have gone to where the signal came from. There were no traces of them there. Right now the agents are in the cave. It should be a -"
I hope you all had a nice New Year's Eve?
"It’s not long from now," he whispered to the unconscious. "I'm so sorry, Tony, I'm so sorry. How could that have happened?"
The battlefield looked awful. Everywhere laid dead creatures, and now dead or injured soldiers, too, who had intervened in the fight. Debris from the flying ship laid everywhere.
How could that happen? Was it his fault that the once so joyous, often somewhat arrogant Tony Stark was now talking bad of himself?
"I'm sorry, Tony. Please say something. Please," he finally said, trying to catch a breath in the end. There was a long pause in the room, before Tony moved briefly with a face distorted with pain.
"You came," Scott called unnecessarily through the microphone.
They had to wait for a long time.
"I'm sorry," Tony managed to whisper. He pressed his head tighter against Steve and pressed his hand against the muscular back of the larger.
Thanks again, V_cameos, for your comment. It is so nice to read something from you.
"Rhodes?" He repeated, louder this time so his two assistants responded. With their hands they pointed to the helicopter in front of them and a bunch of people in there. Words that could mean something like "Everything's good" came to Tony's ears, which were now whistling and roaring again.
He stared back. His breathing was faster, for the murderer of his parents, his mother's murderer, was sitting there, a few feet away, as if nothing had happened. Tony noticed that Barnes had knotted his hands together, staring intently at the hologram. His jaw muscles tensed, but then Steve clapped his hands on his lap.
"No, that's not me. You are predictable. You all are. Oh yes. I was even able to foresee Vision's stupid game. I knew that he would finally betray me today. I knew you would want to save him for his heroism."
"So now we have to find out who did it and why. And if they could attack again."
Steve just nodded, because now he had to act. More and more beings poured out of various gaps in the ship. The few government troops who had come behind them were firing at the monsters as best they could, and his team did what was possible.
"Although," Tony finally said. "Can you take off my shoes? I’m too tired."
"No, not spotted yet," said Falcon.
"I'll stay here too," Rhodey said, but Tony looked at him dumbfounded. The man was most likely to need a bed, he was about to say, but his friend interrupted him. "I do not feel the legs down anymore. I don’t need to take a big bed, the sofa is enough for me."
Tony had seen this Air Line a few times but had never flown with it before, but now it drew his attention.
"Agent Harper," he said to a young man, two seats away from Maximoff. "You have more information."
endure more. Do you even understand the danger in which you found yourself?"
Then the sound came back. "- help with these injuries," Wilson finished. The camera wobbled. You could see that there were three other agents in the cave besides Lang, Wilson, and Mrs Anne Miller.  The cave looked much more like a long corridor. Then the light went out and the picture became black again.
"Did you plan to go alone?" Rhodey asked, who had stayed downstairs. The door had fallen into the lock just behind Steve and since Tony had not stared after him, he had not noticed at first that his friend was still in the workshop. He had thought he was alone.
As he flew back, he saw that Wanda was trying to help Steve and Bucky, but was distracted again and again. Dragenbach was standing next to her and several other agents tried to protect her, but the aliens were just too many.
He stopped trying to move his legs and instead tried to focus his eyes on what he could see, but next to the beige sandstone and the blue sky, he only saw yellow and white. Like a desert, these colors stretched across the ground as far as he could see. He thought he heard water rushing, but his brain had to play a joke on him because now everything went black again.
Lang and Dragenbach said nothing, the agent just nodded and Lang watched Tony closely. The mechanic had not forgotten what the younger man had said to him last time in that prison, but that did not interest him. It was important that his colleagues came out of here.
Tony took a breath. "I have to do it alone. It’s too important."
"Why?" He shouted. "You had everything, Vision, everything! Do you even know into what danger you got everybody?"
"An anaesthetic. It will relieve the pain and help the body to regenerate faster."
"I painted this one," she said, handing Natasha the thick paper with the pencil drawing. "And a day later I took these pictures at the point where I saw the thing."
Slowly, Tony turned the photo to the back, hoping to find out who this was, but Steve squeezed his shoulder and picked up the package.
His breathing slowed before he regained control. "We are. Here," he said, showing Steve and Natasha his cell phone. He tried to cover the situation. "I filmed the conversation. Love to the technology of modern times and a good eye for the design!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Gladly," he said anyway. It would do him good to get away from all the drastic changes. Friday sent a message to his screen.
"Yeah. At least it's progressing now."
Tony did not even have to look for the numbers standing in the corner. Sixteenth of December 1991, of course, his friend recognized this date. And Natasha also seemed to understand. Vision told Wanda something and she held her hand over her mouth in alarm. Fury put his hands on the table. Not even Tony had told him about the video. At that moment, the car crashed into the tree and the inventor flinched. Steve's grip tightened slightly, but it did not hurt.
Unless he wanted to play the psychic game. As with Zemo, who had incited the Avengers against each other, or in all the other cases that Tony had already been a part of. He sighed.
Tony frowned. "That's not possible, Friday has everything ...", Tony stopped and looked at Natasha's pleased face. "You’re impossible."
"In addition, it will be checked for all of the Avengers to what extent they had violated their rights to intervene in the fight on the flying object."
"Either you're dead or I am. Or both of us. The hate of your comrades will be too great for them to let me live. They are predictable, you may almost say stupid. I don't know how it will end. If I kill you, it will not safe my children. But I will have done to you and your friends what you did to me. I'll get my revenge and it will be beautiful.
, who were now behind Burkwill, and Burkwill's knife buried itself in Visions neck.
Her eyes fell on all the technical devices behind him. She was right. He could have finished it. But there was an even better way.
English is not my first language, I also often mix up British and American English, so sorry for that. But Google Translate is like a half-god now, so that’s very nice.
Nobody noticed that the aircraft, which flew several miles above them, disappeared as well.
Calmingly, Bucky put a hand on his shoulder. He seemed to know what was going on with him.
Rhodey waited to answer for a moment. "People who want to kidnap Tony. People who want to stop me from looking for Tony. People who got Tony into the situation."
"I have to check something," he muttered, more to himself than anyone, and escaped down the hall to his room. He closed his heart like the door he slammed shut, at least he told himself. Quickly he turned over the old key, then, shaking and staggering, stared at his cell phone and entered the number he never forgot.
While Steve tried to fend off three little monsters at the same time, he could see a bit of how Vision and Rhodey were heading for the brain.
Tony swallowed. He had known the danger, but such a threat was not something you just put away quickly.
"What?", Natasha asked and simultaneously the mechanic turned to Steve. For the first time, he examined him correctly. His blond hair was illuminated by the small display of his cell phone.
The mechanic thought of his boyfriend and the demotivation and disinterest the first days that nearly broke his heart. But he also thought of pride when he knew he was the only one who kept Steve going.
seemed a bit restless. "I remember. We do not have any information yet. Did you talk to Tony?"
Clint cleared his throat. "Barnes was at SHIELD with Wanda earlier and they both asked a bit. The route the ship must have taken would have passed New York City that the States should have had noticed. Now we’ve got to check what went wrong there."
"And almost killed yourself! A few hours longer out there, and you wouldn’t be here! We could’ve -"
At that moment, Rhodey turned and shot the creature, which fell over immediately and lie twenty centimeters in front of Tony. He was torn from his stupor. "Thanks," he said quickly, his voice cracking as he shot down a fighter who was aiming for Vision with a gun. The Android had arrived at the tank and turned around again.
Tony flew toward the creature at high speed and grabbed it with a loud crash. The repulsors ran harder as Tony grabbed the heavy creature and flew it up into the air. It roared loudly, but even louder were the screams of the other creatures and the army commands.
The applause subsided and Fury cleared his throat. "Good evening!" he greeted the audience tight and looked into various cameras. "This press conference aims to remove speculation about Mr Anthony Edward Stark and the future work of the Avengers. Please sit down," the man immediately began, pointing the reporters to their seats. A rustling went through the rows and shortly thereafter it was very quiet.
"And Tony?" He asked anyway. He wanted to hear what had happened. Was Tony ill? Injured? Dead? Because of him?
"I’ll come with you."
"It would be, if we hadn’t searched any further. If the camera does not distort more than a common one, we can make out the approximate height of the plane. The shadows indicate it flies to the southeast, and by then, about eight minutes past five, only New York, Baltimore, and Boston flights are likely to leave."
The journalists stood in front of the building and even under the trees to get a glimpse of the City Hall. One even seemed to be serving a drone, but he couldn’t see it.
he had said.
"What?" he whispered, startled. He thought Steve must hear his heartbeat thumping in his chest.
The flashlights blinded Steve, as he climbed out of the plane but he tried not to show it.
"Right, we were talking about the aliens. Your information about them is really bad. Maybe the six agents from Norway would know more. Too bad that contact with them is no longer intact. I’m actually sure they would know something more."
"Reactions?"
Again, Lady Elise answered. Of all the people in the room, she was probably the second smartest. He liked her very much. Her stern eyes met James'.
That's when Howard died. None of the agents moved.
Stark should get his revenge soon.
"Yes, sir," he said in a loud voice. "The means of transport must have flown from the northeast through the Atlantic. But by national security conditions, it must have been seen from New York City, sir. Camouflage devices were found on the ship, but not strong enough for the radar. So, we're dealing with an enemy in our security agencies. This fits in with the information we have about alien and human collaboration. There must be a group of at least two people behind this attack. Probably more, sir."
Only Howard died before the captain was found and Tony had lost him again.
"Get out of your suit. You cannot talk like that to a woman. So cold and ... metallic." Burkwill gestured and the monster let go of Tony. He stumbled forward a few steps before he could catch himself. He stared at Burkwill but then nodded. Without needing to do anything, his suit fell away and placed itself just a few seconds later as a suitcase next to him. Burkwill clapped and Tony ran to Pepper in his wet clothes.
There was a brief silence in the lab as the two waited for the message to be sent to them. Steve got up and walked over to Tony with his arms crossed, looking at the screen. A video opened on the monitor. Tony sat upright and Steve leaned forward a bit to see more. It was dark, you could hardly see anything on the screen. Some cluttered images shot across the black area, then suddenly the sound switched on. Dull and distorted, one could hear a deep voice saying "test, test".
"I could have let you die, Stark," Burkwill said in the ghostly silence that had spread. Only Vision moved behind Tony as the Englishman spoke on. "This cave was easy to fill up, Rogers would have been an easy opponent, we could have even manipulated the water," he spoke in rage. Natasha looked attentively at her teammates and mouthed something that drew attention to the
Several chairs stood opposite a large wooden table, on which both file folders and a screen were placed. Through one of the windows, some light fell into the room, showing the dust in the air.
Rhodey pretended to think about it as he got up and Tony really smiled again.
Steve nodded beside Tony and kept looking out. The mechanic turned to Natasha but could only see her back. Then he pushed away from the window and went on to the stairs. He could not wait forever. Steve stopped by the window for a moment, then turned to follow Tony. "It looks a bit like Brooklyn back then," he said, to start a conversation.
"Tony, Steve is right, you-"
When his hand touched the sun-heated metal, he winced but did not let go. He looked at the piece with his jaw clenched. With only one arm, he couldn’t build anything properly, no devices to escape or call for help. His brain worked. He stared at the piece of metal in his hand, hoping he'd come up with an idea of how to make something out of it that would get him help. His feverish and painfully slow brain needed several minutes before a solution could be found. Tony was sure the only way to get out of this situation alive was to get help. He swallowed and hoped he would not lose his chances with his idea.
Slowly, Tony felt the painkillers begin to work again. His eyelids grew heavier and it took some effort to keep his face upright.
Tony lowered his eyes. He remembered the attack on New York too well. He knew how scary and terrifying it could be. He could feel the cold in his chest himself, the goose bumps that had spread when he was alone in the vastness of the universe. When a nuclear bomb exploded in front of him, and he was sure that the light would be the last thing he would see in his life.
Tony nodded and looked almost reflexively at Steve. As encouraging as he could, he nodded to him.
Something was missing.
And so it went on.
"Nothing," he answered quickly. "But if you’re already here. How do you know that Stark Industries can still produce weapons? There are no more plans for weapons and normal ones will not help you with your rescue plan."
"Oh, and Steve," Natasha said then. She ran to him and put a paper in his hand. Her hand laid reassuringly on his arm and she smiled encouragingly at him. "You are now officially allowed to travel through the United States as well as all other states of the world."
"And a coffee," he added after the little robot had left. "But only after that. And is there anything new from Lang, Wilson and the four agents?" Tony asked, disturbing the silence of the workshop. Only Dum-E’s humming was heard.
But Tony didn’t die.
"I don’t know, boss. It seems that the suit is magnetically tied to the bridge. I can’t control it."
Again, the mouth took the place of the video.
life - and even he felt the emptiness strongly. Rhodey and Pepper had helped him and Wanda in the beginning, but they had not overcome Burkwill’s game unscathed, so Tony sent them to the East Coast last week to stay in a villa for two weeks together - "to see whether it’s worth buying."
Tony saw that Barnes raised his eyebrows. "Even if we find him then we would be right in front of him. Alone. Should we attack him then or what?"
Steve nodded. "Tony won’t like not to be allowed to attend the conference. He’ll want to talk himself."
"Friday, please show the news. Your creator here gets nothing from the outside world, I'm afraid."
Tony froze. She could not see the screen? The road meanwhile hit quite a few danglers, but still pursued the rough north, should that really be a map. Tony reached for his cell phone to take a picture of the card so that Friday could read it, but it did not work. He could not open the camera and froze. The lunatic could not only avoid Friday, but also influence his cell phone.
She was the only one who knew what had happened in Siberia, what Tony had seen on the video. She was the only one who knew why Tony had been so hurt by being betrayed by
His voice broke in the end as his eyes fell back on the five people kneeling before him. "I'm sorry," he told them softly, but Pepper shook his head.
The nausea came up in Tony, but Vision took a quick look at him. He tried to take a deep breath but almost choked on himself. Injured and disappointed, he stared at Vision.
"And can you tell us where?" one of the agents asked. Agent Riggs, Tony thought. He could remember the scarred face.
Tony had thanked him and then pulled up Steve, who had been muttering softly, but had finally walked with him, still half asleep. That was the first night Tony was awake only because of his own nightmares, not because of his boyfriend's.
"Exactly. So there were two more comments in other languages on the note, but they don’t seem to be very important, otherwise, they would have noted it differently."
"Was she the security leak?" Natasha asked. Her eyes had been wandering attentively all over the faces of everyone in the room.
Abbie Lopez handed Tony a wavy note. The paper was already yellowing, and the writing was blurred by water in some places. Tony frowned.
Steve put himself in an attack position and put his hand over his ear. "Are you still with me?" He asked the others to find out why his earpiece had made such noises.
Barnes and Steve looked at each other for a moment and then ran to find a bed. Tony thought he had seen a slightly disappointed look from Steve but had to be wrong. There should be two rooms, each with one bed, Van Peeters had said, and Wanda and Tony were running toward it. The narrow corridor had five doors, the two larger rooms left and right in front and behind that, the single rooms, before the last door probably led to the small bathroom. Tony scraped into the room next to Steve's and Bucky's and once again tore to open the window. The wooden door creaked as he closed it behind him. A fur lay on the floor of the chamber, where the thin bed and just a small closet could be found.
"Friday, scan this thing please."
"If you can go through the widths of the internet and break through some firewalls, so we can reach them? Or if you can continue to build my suit?"
I wish you a nice weekend!
"Tony!" She exclaimed, relieved and Fury nodded. "Sam and Scott cannot come yet. We will tell them later. How are you? Wanda? Rhodey, Tony? Steve?"
Behind him, he heard Natasha and Steve move and could feel their two glances in his back. There was always a mezzanine floor between the real floors, and when he was at the second of those, he could not help but lean against the window and look out into the yard. There were three more stairs he had to walk, and his ribs were already starting to throb, and his heart started to pace. It was unbelievable how quickly the body was able to reduce muscle and capacity, and Tony needed a break.
Steve shook his head with a bad feeling. He had to think about the fight now. Not about Tony.
. He thought the bald man was a quite interesting person. He was not too dump and he certainly knew how to behave. The blond man annoyed him. He was stupid and evil, did not once thought about his actions. But he helped and keeping him close was doing good on James.
"Found something extraordinary?"
Slowly, Natasha went forward and Tony followed her to the door. Again, the stale smell of the stairwell fell into Tony's nose as the woman opened the door, and while they were putting on their jackets, Lopez held out a blue T-shirt to Steve.
"Your actions have spoken quite differently. A cell phone, Rogers? A cell phone?" he shouted and Steve heard his desperation.
"I'll call the doctors," Steve said softly and walked out of the room.
"Obviously not." Tony looked irritated. "Otherwise the man wouldn’t have gotten through."
"Guns down," Tony heard himself say. "It wasn’t him."
Steve could only guess how the man felt right now when his best friend ignored him and then sacrificed himself. He swallowed and turned his head away, to the ground beneath his feet. He clenched his jaw as hold his hands tight so they were already becoming white.
"You could have tidied up," the mechanic greeted his robot but patted him gently on the head after the little helper had bowed it sadly.
It used to be easier, Tony noted, but finally pulled his hand away from the window just to press it against a small stone. He hardly dared to look down, because the house was quite high. It took him ten minutes before he found his way down safely. With a dull sound, he jumped on the grass. There was still light coming from the room of Steve and Barnes, but it was off in the living room. Quietly, Tony slipped into the pasture behind the house and opened the plane that still stood there with a short command. Without looking around, he jumped in and just wanted to tell Friday that he could put on the suit when a voice stopped him.
This was something Tony had to do alone. He knew Steve would tell Barnes ... he would tell Bucky, probably immediately after he left. Probably the other Avengers would now know that he was gone. But they could not find him. They had to wait until they had more information and they could not track him, Tony had taken care of that.
, he thought bitterly and stiffened briefly as his stomach rebelled and he had to choke, causing a sharp pain to pass through his entire body.
He pushed his way through the small alley, which the security tried to keep in line under great difficulty, right behind Natasha.
Clint answered first. "Yes. What's that?" with his bow he aimed at the fast plane.
So, I wish you all a wonderful weekend!
The so-called 'Civil War' was over, he had even dropped his façade for a moment, a moment just with Steve. As much as he wanted, he could not be mad at Barnes, and Rhodey walked again as if nothing had ever happened to him.
"So you painted this picture?", Natasha asked and showed her the picture on the phone. The woman nodded and waddled to one of the cupboards to fumble with it.
"Or at least her cell phone is there. And the GPS system in her earring. Safely held in the purse of an employee who is now sleeping in her former hotel room."
"That I ... he ... in front of the others. I'm sorry. I didn't want  to put you in any- "
"It’s fine. It's over. I reacted wrong. They are dead."
The danger, the serious danger was clearly visible and everyone in the room knew it. No one moved for several minutes, then suddenly Steve heard someone straighten up. He looked up.
The long island was not wide, but it took several minutes to fight its way out of the dense forest and before he could see the beach. Steve ran a few meters over the fine sand, which looked completely deserted. He could see hundreds of yards to the left and right and saw nothing except the sand and behind him the forest that separated him from the road. The waves beat evenly and almost reassuringly against the beach and for a brief moment Steve just listened.
Again, a pause set in, ghostly calm. Nobody in the room said a word. Pepper clawed her hands into Tony's arm as he tried to calm his breathing.
For a brief moment, the older man pretended not to have heard her but eventually sighed. She would not go away, and her eyes made him restless and unfocused. Sometimes, when two stubborn people met, one had to give in. He looked up in annoyance.
A bush rustled loudly behind him and Steve turned around attentively. Soldiers shouldn’t be here yet and animals barely made those noises. "Rhodes?" He called questioningly and waited.
As he spoke, he paid close attention to the reactions of his listeners. Everyone stared at him spellbound, but he could see many confused eyes. Is was foreseeable. It was annoying.
It was very quiet in the room. Steve seemed to know that Tony wouldn’t forgive him, he noted. Tony saw only understanding, a little disappointment, but no dislike, no incomprehension in the other man’s eyes. It was a strange situation. Each of them knew from the very beginning that Tony wouldn’t forgive Steve directly. But still the soldier was here. And both were disappointed with the solution, but both were understanding. The two knew that it would never be the same between them as it once had been. Too much had happened. They both knew it and yet the two men looked at each other extensively.
Someone else moved in the audience and a female voice asked: "Did he really sacrifice himself?"
"The therapy," he explained curtly.
Horrified, Steve shook his head. No, that wasn’t Tony. He would never lock himself up instead of helping others.
It was his fault. It was all his fault and Tony knew it. He had created Vision, he had created the bombs and shells, and he had controlled too little.
Tony let out a breath. "Childlike imagination. A coincidence, right?"
He was not allowed to show any weakness now, even if he wanted. His hands were shaking.
"That day I drank alcohol for the first time in my life, so it was too much for me after a few beers. When I went home, I wanted to take the fastest route. I just wanted to sleep."
But when it was dark, this reflection did not work. Just a little light came from the one used room of this corridor. The monitors, which displayed all the important data right next to the patient, kept shining in the large room. But for The Person, these monitors would only give the necessary light. They would not show any data that were from interest.
, Tony thought.
"Why?" Tony asked without taking his eyes off the track. "Is the TV broken? Did Vision make the kitchen burn? I'm sorry, I have something crucial to do right now. Can you give me that screw there, please?", he asked, pointing to a small piece of metal that had fallen off his table.
He ran his hand over his face and tried to understand why the newspaper had published this article. He caused nothing but fear, which was perhaps justified, but far from helpful.
"We shouldn’t be looking at all,” he replied, earning dumbfounded glances. He continued to straighten up. "Burkwill has carefully given small hints the whole time. He will not stop, so close to the end. He still wants his revenge," he analysed. "He just wants us to have no plan before. If we split up, we are scattered around the city as the crucial clue falls; we are unprepared and uncoordinated. We just have to wait here and Burkwill will call again."
"Nothing official, sir. I can try to get internal data, but I am sure that you would have been informed if SHIELD had known something more."
Then the two agents also turned around and got into the elevator, which was already up again.
"Because I've been working for you all the time," Vision said loudly, and again Tony became mad. It had become unnaturally quiet, but the mechanic just wanted to jump up and kill the two people on the other side of the bridge. Even though he had to go through a lot of extraterrestrials and a hail of bullets.
I'd really love to read what you all think of that chapter. I enjoyed writing it. And I'd love to just hear something from you. Criticism or just the things you liked. I can't correct grammar mistakes or fix plotholes or whatever if you don't write. And it's also kind of sad to write that much and getting like no response to all of it. So, yeah. I'd love to read something from you.
It was quiet for a moment. Then the AI responded with a "No, as far as I know, they are searching in the vicinity of the fighting area, so further north." Steve nodded and considered briefly.
Tony noticed the goosebumps that spread in his arms the more he looked at the picture.
"You too," answered the well-known voice with the British accent. Tony had stopped moving by now. He felt small, alone on his half of the bridge, while Burkwill stood there with at least fifteen other people.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony squinted. What the person said did not make sense. He stared at the black screen with the red line and swallowed. The path already faded on the screen and neither of the men moved.
Tony sighed theatrically.
The doors closed quietly and the artificial light lit up the small room on its way up.
He heard his friend sniffing in disbelief, then rushed up to him.
"Cap? Stark?" Clint had asked via the intercom.
Steve could see it. The creature stretched several yards high. An armor that seemed to be impenetrable even from a distance, and a particularly large head were the things that stood out first.
The sweat ran down his forehead and the mercilessly strong wind made the other's hair constantly move.
"And Mrs. Potts is currently in China," Burkwill ended Tony's thoughts. "You wanted to say that, didn’t you?"
"Why didn’t you ask about Friday? You could’ve saved time doing whatever you're doing," Tony murmured to himself rather than to Steve, but the soldier understood anyway.
Thank you all for the kudos and comments all of this!
Relieved, Steve breathed. Clint seemed relieved as well, he noticed, and Natasha leaned back a little further. Steve smiled briefly for the good news. "It's good. Do we know anything new about the monsters?"
It felt like an eternity before Steve finally reached the big door to the hall with all the planes. The door had already been pushed open and the soldier remained disturbed. Slowly he went to the door and noticed that a small bag with a note was hanging in front of it.
It had gotten worse. Each breath made him feel that several ribs had been broken or at least bruised, a wound over his eye had become inflamed and throbbed, just like his head, as he could not drink anything.
"Tony," Steve whispered, putting a hand over his mouth. "No."
"Let him in," he told the AI. The door opened and the soldier entered the room.
"Because he did what you've done all these months? Come to my workshop and keep me from working?", he asked, trying to sound angry.
"We'll take the black SUV," she said. "It looks different, but it doesn’t stand out as much as one of your cars, Tony."
Tony looked at him challengingly. "Okay, there's a dead body already”, Rhodey admitted. “But you aren’t going there today. Tomorrow is the earliest date on which I allow you to get out of here. And just if you can move properly."
As the mirrored doors quietly pushed open, he could take a look at the large area. The modern kitchen with the cooking island had been used a lot by Vision in recent months. The new Avenger had cooked frequently and Tony, Rhodes and Natasha had to taste the results. He rolled his eyes. He hobbled to the island as fast as he could to get some food.
"Zemo shot Natasha too, but then he ran. I did have him ... I didn’t mean to harm him that badly, but he was screaming things, Tony." Steve's voice broke and Tony felt more helpless than ever. "He said you would always be a murderer and never really love someone without seeking profit. I could not ... I was so angry. It's not right, Tony, okay? What he said is not true."
"Fuck," he cried.
"They understood," she said at some point after a while.
"The boy isn’t in interest for you. Nothing happened, there were no injured civilians in this attack. What's important is what those aliens were and whether they could come back," the man continued. Tony thought it was scary just to see the man’s mouth.
"Where do I have to go?" he asked weakly and felt the eyes of others on him. Steve stammered a bit, but the noise in Tony's ears was too loud for him to understand. Rhodey's mouth opened in disbelief, but Tony did not care. He did not care if nothing else went according to plan. The psychopath had Pepper, the only person who had been with him throughout the last few months.
"Bad blood value, am I right?" Burkwill asked. "Actually, just since the attack on Tom's River, but still bad. Of course, that does not bother you as long as you can go on working, Stark, but perhaps you should have paid more attention to your own health. Would it not be possible to use state-of-the-art nanotechnology to let small cameras and microphones flow through your veins?"
"That," a female voice told them via intercom, "is the reinforcement."
The mechanic jumped. Natasha stood next to him, arms crossed, looking down at his work.
," Burkwill ordered and turned to Tony. "Did we calm down then?"
Groaning, he tried to sit up and look around, but his body didn’t obey him. He just tasted the blood that flowed slowly from somewhere into his mouth. The metallic taste made him choke.
"Mr Rogers and Mr Rhodes both took high-speed planes," Friday said as Bucky pushed the big door open.
"Can I help you somehow, Tony?" Steve asked. Tony's lips drew up in a tormented laugh and he rolled his eyes.
About twenty feet away from the creature, both made themselves ready to attack again and flew off at the same time.
"Um, huh?" Tony asked very intelligently. His hands moved nervously at the shock of the woman suddenly standing next to him.
. The leaders multiply in large numbers, and if you win one for yourself, the others will, too. As long as the other
Some old, rotten wood divided the wall in the middle and probably once looked good a few decades ago, but now it only showed that the house urgently needed a refurbishment.
Just when Bucky pulled him up by the arm, his senses slowly returned. The noises had stopped. Clint and Natasha hugged each other and looked up at the sky. Vision, Falcon, and Scott stared at the burning point in the air, which continued to spread in all directions and then to Steve.
"If you had been gone a day longer, I would’ve come back to find you myself, Tony," she explained more gently. Tony smiled. It was probably true. And if she had found him, she would have blamed him for dropping out of the meetings.
Steve looked at Vision in disbelief. "We have an important conference right now. Of course I'm a bit nervous," he confessed.
"Would I have to worry about my well-being then?" he asked jokingly.
Steve did not answer but held the mechanic in his arms.
"Work with us, don’t hide, Tony," the bigger one answered softly. His voice broke at the end of the sentence. "We need you and we want to protect you all, we -"
"Come on up," Steve said in greeting. "Most of the others are in the living room." He quickly ran to the mechanic and wanted to pull him up, but Tony got up first.
Rhodey stared at him and said nothing.
Steve sighed. "Then let's hope we can offer them what they want. And then, hopefully, we'll have our rest. Aren’t there any other problems right now?" he voiced his thoughts from the plane.
"I also noticed that you have never seen 'Ghostbusters'. I can’t leave you that way."
Again, it was quiet for a moment. Then Steve spoke up. "Do you know what was in the West?"
When Steve opened his eyes in the middle of the night, he couldn’t remember his dream. Breathing heavily, he sat down on the edge of his bed, in the room that still looked the same as it used to. He ran his hand over his sweaty face, trying to calm himself.
"My wings!" He shouted. "I can’t fly anymore! Crap."
Sorry for not posting at the weekend. I kind of didn't realise it was that short. Two days aren't enough.
With raised eyes, Tony looked at the screen.
The thing with Bucky had happened almost three months ago. Had it hit him that hard? Steve had expected that Tony was not so good at talking to him, but that he was retiring himself?
Bucky had killed his mother, Steve had known and then defended the killer. Natasha, Rhodey and Vision did not know what had happened back then, they just knew
"I am very glad that my birthday is important to you, but -"
He had not drunken anything for more than a day.
clawed at Tony and grabbed him painfully. Tony cried out for a moment, but then the creature pulled him to his feet with a force that almost made him collapse again if the claws would not stick in his shoulder. Mucus dripped onto his head and the creature murmured something over and over again. Tony whined as the thing tightened its grip. It felt like his shoulder was about to be ripped out.
"How long have you been down here?"
The man was at most twenty-four. His brown hair was cropped and testified to military training. The athletic agent stood up.
"I ...," Tony didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t help. He was tired, suffering from severe headaches that had come back and most of all, he didn’t want to face Steve. His stomach tightened, and again he felt like he had to vomit, but he held back any gag reflex.
Now he opened the silent door and looked at the small package on the floor. It was barely bigger than a book and very thin. Tony felt his hand start to sweat with excitement. The last time he got a parcel, he found a letter and a phone in it. Steve squeezed his hand and pulled him two steps into the room. He bent down and looked at the package.
"Stark?" Fury asked. If he was surprised, he did not show it. Rather, he sounded annoyed at the interruption. Tony just shrugged his shoulders in amazement. "Friday?" he asked again, but the AI did not answer.
Tony froze. Steve should not be here. Nobody should be here, the door –
Tony turned away from the others without awaiting an answer. He expected the others to hold him back to find solutions together, but he wanted to avoid that. He quickly ran to the elevator, looking straight ahead. But nobody said anything, the others let him go. Lost in their own thoughts and struggling with their own horror, the Avengers stayed in the room.
have the weapons," the man whispered suddenly. The mouth disappeared and a picture of a clearing appeared. Behind some trees, one could see the ocean faintly. The sun cast some shadows on the ground. Five people sat there. Tony recognized Wilson immediately. He had seen the three agents next to him before, too. The other man had to be the Ant-Man. The five wore only scraps of what once could have been clothes. In the room, some people were moving restlessly. The five of them were kneeling on the muddy ground, looking closely into the camera with their faces drawn in battle.
He pressed his lips together to avoid another sob, staring out of the cave into the sky.
Tony had not gone back to the workshop that evening. The treatment had been more exhausting than he had anticipated, and in the end, he could just drag himself into his own room. His arm burned and the painkillers given to him did not help. Tears of pain ended up in Tony's eyes as he dropped onto his bed. His ribs hurt and felt like they squeezed his organs and jumped out of his ribcage at the same time.
"I have to get inside of that ship, now!", Steve shouted to the others.
"Are all traces removed?" Burkwill asked as Kima and Xi returned. "The bodies are gone, our nice buddy here will not notice," said the younger man, pointing to the
"We're still figuring out who it is. The woman hid her data very well, but we should have information soon. What we do know is that she is or was a big fan of Steve and that she probably lives in the United States. But the picture was painted on a trip to Europe. The woman must be between thirty and forty years old, probably has no children and lives alone. Not more."
," he suddenly said loudly. Tony winced almost imperceptibly. Burkwill added something in a language Tony had never heard before. It reminded him of Jawaese from
His chest was shaking with panic, and again he felt the coughing sensation, but then he could finally regain control of his suit.
Tony almost choked. Burkwill had actually got a tank into the city center. He landed next to the two soldiers. "Are you alright?" Steve asked quickly. Tony nodded under the mask, even though he was still sick and hurt, but this was about something bigger than that. The soldier's blue eyes lay on him for a long moment and seemed to analyze him closely. Worry and fear lay in them. Tony turned to the battlefield.
He could not believe it. His legs were about to give up and his hands were sweating heavily under the suit. His breathing was much too fast, so black spots formed in front of his eyes. The pain and guilt weighed down on his shoulders as he saw his own work standing in front of him.
"Protected," Tony finished the sentence. "Did you hear?" He asked everyone else. Rhodey agreed and Bucky called out of breath "Just be fast!".
The farewell had been difficult, especially after such a short time, but it was the best for them all. Tony had enough to do with Steve, who had barely left the building since it was clear what would happen to Bucky. He had helped and helped him, but a best friend remained a best friend.
"Just take a look," Tony replied. "And turn on music, please!"
Tony pointed to the neck and shoulders, but none of the agents seemed surprised. This information had not left the security wing, but the agents were not stupid. Video footage had shown them where the creatures were vulnerable.
Tony's eyes were on Steve, who was staring at the ground. Bucky leaned back in his chair, eyes darting to Steve, before examining his hands again. Neither said anything. Fury's face had become even harder.
"Instead, we even removed wasp nest from the cave you were in, Stark." Tony clawed his hands into the back of the sofa in front of him.
The younger one looked at him silently. "But you have to trust us more. We could have helped you if you had said what happened back then, we - it doesn’t even matter," he interrupted himself and took a breath. "You have to get more involved with everyone. Steve and you, I rarely saw you say goodbye. You didn’t even look at him. Take care of him, Tony, I know that ... "
Tony exchanged a confused look with his teammate for the sudden change of topic.
Tony turned back to face Steve. He was a bit pale around his nose but still looked determined. The soldier had fought in the war, he saw when someone was lost. The woman would not have made it another three days if she did not get help from somewhere.
He looked at the two with a stunned expression. Steve was a little closer now, his hand still clutching Tony's arm. The other Avengers also came closer, they needed to know what had happened. Tony could practically see the disappointment in Natasha's eyes, that he had never told her this. Rhodey's hand was sweating on Tony's shoulder.
"I thought of you while I was waiting for Burkwill," Tony said quietly. "I thought about what else I should have told you. In the jet. Or in the cave, or in Sokovia. When he was there, I knew it was too late. There were so many." Tony took a breath, trying to dispel the images and the fear from his memory. "Thank you for coming."
There was a ... there stomped a thing out of the trees and grunted so loudly. It was certainly twice as big as me and suddenly stopped in the clearing! It grunted, but it seemed to say something. Some kind of slime or water or ... what do I know, dripping from the monster and I was so scared. See, I'll get goose bumps again! It had a note that the creature must have lost there, I found it the next day."
"I can try to get the information, just give me a few moments."
Annoyed, Tony accepted the opinion of his friend. He thought it was terrible when others made decisions and he couldn’t interfere. And when other people also announced those decisions he liked it even less. He also wanted to show people that he was fine. He wanted to be seen, and not just be the bit of misery that was talked about.
"That's what you say now," Natasha countered and Tony sighed.
Tired, he slumped onto the bed just to the right of the door and closed his eyes, just for a moment. The bed was dusty and uncomfortable, and the pillow barely a hand wide. A cold wind swept through the window, though it was summer. By now it was dark outside and Tony could hear chirping crickets. Of course, he did not carry a suitcase with him, he did not have to unpack anything, but before he went back to the others, he wanted to have a moment for himself.
If he called him, they could track his position, and so close to the end, everything would be gone. He had to know Pepper to be safe, and the others too, only then could he think about possible ways out.
Steve stood with his mouth open. The others had come? A wave of relief flooded him.
The man’s voice grew louder and Tony listened in disbelieve.
The woman nodded hesitantly. Her voice trembled. "The next morning, after I saw what I had painted, I just heard that voice over and over again. This accent that I couldn’t unhear. So, I went back to the clearing, I shot the photos there. It had snowed a lot during the night. It looked very different. Ten inches high was the snow, but not in the clearing. Everything was flattened, as you can see."
"First of all, I have an alien threat to solve."
Tony snorted and Steve changed his position.
He just nodded but did not seem satisfied.
It took several minutes before he was halfway oriented.
It ran clumsily toward him and Steve focused on the spot at the neck, on which the monsters were killed instantly.
Tony's skin felt boiling hot. Somehow, Steve managed to put the mechanic over his shoulders so that as few wounds as possible were worsened. Steve tried to avoid touching the broken arm. Tony would hardly feel the pain during unconsciousness, yet Steve did not want to be rough to him. Like a toddler, Tony lay on Steve's back and did nothing.
"Where do you order from? Freddy?" Steve nodded before Tony told him his strain.
As Tony and Steve ran through the living room to their rooms, the Avengers were gone. Steve turned left, pulling away from Tony, to look for his suit, while Friday sent the now-completed version of the Iron Man Suit into the plane. Tony was a little proud of his armor extension. Friday's control allowed her to help him in critical situations. If he was in the suit but only if his breathing slowed, she would take over control completely. With trembling hands, the inventor run into his room and rummaged for the medication, which he still had to take. His arm had almost healed thanks to medical technology, even though scars were still visible. It still hurt, but he could move it.
A little bit of water on the face to wake up halfway and get the pain away from his head.
Tony breathed in and out again. He remembered the man who had told Steve that there was something green in the blue eyes. Tony remembered the mass grave they had stood in about three months ago. The moment in which he still thought it could all be okay, before Zemo showed the video.
"No, fuck. Fuck."
Tony had grown louder and had raised his hand menacingly. Natasha looked at him with raised eyebrows and folded arms. "Forget it," he finished. "What do you know about the critters?"
Tony cried out loud. Sweat dripped from his forehead and had soaked his sleeping clothes, and his stomach cramped in pain. Breathless, he propped himself up and put his hands on his knees. He choked, but nothing left his mouth. Trembling, he wiped the tears from his eyes, which had crept in there in pain or fear.
"Unfortunately I do not know it. I've lost contact with both," admitted Friday. "Both left at night to find my boss. I have been expressly ordered by Rhodes not to tell you that they went off. And the security settings of my boss mean that I have to follow instructions from him. He didn’t talk about answers," Friday added, sounding almost relieved to finally be able to tell.
. He sighed.
Burkwill's eyes focused on Kima again. "And the
"Tony," Rhodey whispered behind him. "The date."
Smiling, Burkwill had watched the reactions of his peers.
"They’ll find him, he can’t be that far."
He saw pictures popping through his head again. His father came home tired from work, pissed off because there was no news of the whereabouts of Captain America, his great hero. He grumbled at the little boy because his toys were lying on the floor, and besides, he did not practice playing the piano as he had agreed to but read a simple children’s book.
"Do always several people watch one area?" Tony asked, rubbing his eyes. There were too few clues. How could a ship of this size go unnoticed to Toms River? He sighed.
"Well, now I should hopefully have your attention now. Yes, crazy, who is working in your own ranks."
Steve wondered if another attack would involve another victim, and a shiver ran down his spine.
"Friday, how long do we need?", he asked the AI. They were sitting in a new, but nevertheless large plane, it would take a long time and they had practically only this day and Friday, before the deadline would expire on Saturday. And who knew at what time.
"You wanted - what?" Tony ran a hand over his eyes. He worked the whole day off and the others thought about pizza and even took his time.
It took scarcely ten minutes for the Avengers to gather the most necessary things and to go to the garage, as Tony had affectionately called it.
Only Tony was missing.
"Tell me, can you help me to put that thing in here?"
The last lights in the park had gone out and with just the few street noises that now reached the park, it seemed eerie. Tony was torn from his thoughts by a movement across the river; about how Howard would react if he knew that Tony and Steve had more or less made a confession of love.
Fury looked at Wanda. "If you're nervous, it's better to talk a bit too little rather than too much. We can’t afford any more missteps."
"Good point," Rhodey answered. Tony could tell that he'd trusted him to travel the entire US without further information, hoping to find the psychopath.
Natasha looked at the cameras again. She even smiled slightly, but Tony was sure she was hating this inside. After all, it was also about her. She was very fortunate that Ross had not pursued her crime at the German airport, and now she has been noticed again.  Cleverly, she threw her hair from her forehead.
Steve, with whom he had spent so many beautiful moments. Steve, with whom he wanted to spend his life, even though he knew it was never going to be the way he hoped the most. Something ached in his stomach and his shoulders stiffened. He looked around, searching for somebody to spy on him, but there was no one.
that the other one was not like him. For fear he would go away. Or never come back - what had been the reason in recent months. And now, at the most inopportune moment, the other said something that Tony had otherwise only dreamed of. He shook his head in disbelief.
"Do you know these people?" Steve asked, who had meanwhile walked to stand just behind Tony. He shook his head. "Never seen them."
Tony raised his eyebrows due to the tight conversation, but then the buzzing noise sounded and Natasha pushed the door open.
"Not if you shoot the creature in the air."
, was still under water. The smaller aliens even moved back to him, their only job was to protect the brain. But Tony was faster. His repulsor took a moment to recharge, but then the energy beam struck the water and hit something. Several of the aliens on the water surface roared with pain, but then the larger head of the
The others had all followed and were able to provide good support, but exhaustion was noticeable in each of them.
Tears flowed from Pepper's eyes, which were red and swollen. Violet edges framed them, clearly coming from punches. The nose was visibly broken and blood covered the whole face. The lips were cracked and a wound on her forehead festered and bleeded at the same time. She looked like she was about to fall over.
"Friday?" he tried again, but still the AI made no sound.
"I had to persuade the police that an accident happened at the Lieutenant Callahan Tunnel," he replied. Tony closed his eyes. The tunnel was in the north of the city, and if Burkwill had such means, his followers could certainly organize a huge show that would keep the press and police away from them for a long time.
Slowly he opened his eyes and groaned in the direction of the exit of the small cave.
Hell, maybe there was a new attack and Tony was useless and couldn’t help. Then, of course, it would be clear why nobody was looking for him. There was either no time or no reason if he could not even save himself while so many pieces of his suit had lain beside him. He might not even be worth looking for. He had subsided, he was aware of that. Again a tear left his eye and his chest cramped as he sobbed.
Rhodey took a deep breath. "And yet he is here again. He was the first one to go down here, he was the first of all the others to find you when you were gone, he was the first one to - "
Natasha cheered cheerfully and then looked again more closely. "Tony? Is that Tony on his arm?"
Clint showed a statistic showing the man's esteemed fortune throughout his life. Tony was amazed when he saw the exponential growth. Burkwill had a good hand for money, he had to admit.
"Tony, we need you, now. Now you must move out of this workshop and come along. We need you. We need the Iron Man."
"It's not your fault."
None of the aliens around the
It had happened the first night after her kiss. Tony was allowed to sleep in his own room but had not been able to ask Steve if they wanted to share one. He'd woken up in the night sweaty because Burkwill had followed him in his dreams and all his teammates had either turned against him or been killed by his mistakes.
He saw black spots again and coughed another time, but laxer this time. He had to do something, the next time he woke up here was probably more unpleasant, he thought.
Desperately, Steve looked around and paused in shock.
And with that, the man pulled himself on the tank and pulled on the grenade. It was only a matter of seconds before it exploded, and Vision estimated it exactly. He took no chances, but kept the grenade in his hand. More and more of the creatures came and shot at him, Rhodey or Tony, and it was getting harder and harder to stop.
"He's dead," she tried to reassure him. Her voice was higher than usual, but not powerless. "And you were there. Thank you."
Tony's eyebrows rose. So, in New York. He nodded and stood up again. He threw one last look at Barnes, who now stared at Tony. When he saw that his eyes had turned to him again, he turned away.
Her eyes had become glassy at the memory. Tony had straightened up and Steve and Natasha could not take their eyes off the woman anymore.
He didn’t want to wake the others; Natasha often woke up at the slightest sound and she would probably try to bring Tony back to bed again.
Rogers waited for the monster to move toward him again. This time it tried to hit with both claws and already started to, but Steve stood still. It was not until the monster's big hands moved swiftly down that Steve turned away. The creature couldn’t react and only shouted as it touched the grey ground with its hands and leaned forward.
Yeah, of course he did!
For a moment it was quiet again as if Rhodey still hoped that Tony would react, but then he heard the clack of metal on wood and it was quiet around him.
The kiss was hesitant at first, but then it changed. Tony was all the fear he had felt the last few hours and knew Steve understood him. The other's hands were warm and strong on his head and his unharmed shoulder, giving exactly what Tony Stark needed: love and confidence.
“That’s my girl,” Tony said, grinning.
Without being able to influence it, Tony turned around and stared at the empty space on the wardrobe. He sighed.
When he let his eyes slip through the workshop, he tensed completely. He cleared some things from a cupboard yesterday but did not notice what was behind it due to his fatigue. The round shield with the star in the middle almost grinned at Tony.
Steve smiled slightly. That was the team he knew. When someone made the start, a darn situation was relaxed.
He groaned briefly and Tony knew that it must be terrible for him. It had been Tony's fight and Steve did not have to be there, and yet the only person among them who was really in danger was his best friend. Tony felt bad. "I'm sorry," he wanted to whisper, but no words left his mouth.
"Am I disturbing your coffee party?" He asked.
He could not do anything about it but just watched as the alien ran toward him. Vision came closer to the tank with every second. Tony's mouth opened a bit as he tried to stop his former colleague. He knew he had to do something, this was not Visions fight.
But then Bucky moved into his field of vision and put a hand on his shoulder. "Come with me," he demanded, pushing him forward. Steve let himself be carried away. It took barely twenty minutes for all the Avengers to stand on the lawn and get archery explained.
It felt like a second after which he was shaken up again. He sensed he was still in the suit but was completely disoriented. Friday had to have taken control because he just fell from the top down on the park, which was now in many places under fire. He scanned the park with his eyes, looking for the spot where Burkwill might be, or the
. Wasn’t it somehow his fault? It all started with the Sokovia agreement that had to be signed. He acted the way he thought was best, he acted the right way, and the still thought so. But could he have allowed the team to split? He put his head in his hands.
Every form of amusement had slipped from Burkwill's eyes. He shouted something and several of the smaller aliens entered the bridge. Tony swallowed. That was many. Every few yards some aliens stood and stared at the lake. Burkwill had built a living wall within seconds of more than fifteen aliens.
"Stark, is Friday working again?" Fury turned to him. Now he looked angry and obviously tried not to shout completely. Tony was torn from his stupor. Quickly he looked at his cell phone, on which the small symbol in the upper corner shone again. He nodded. "She's back."
Fury nodded in agreement. "So it might have been a long-term planned attack. We have to act like more will follow."
"Rhodey, you got something?" He shouted to his friend. The situation was critical, they could not fight for a long time anymore. Friday had repeatedly warned him that he was still bleeding and it would soon be dangerous. But Tony could not stop.
Natasha waited, then continued talking.
Tony did not sleep much that night. To calm Rhodey, he hobbled into his room right after the press conference ended. Almost two hours later, he awakened from his light sleep and heard how the others had come back. Some of their rooms were on his level, and although they tried to be quiet, they had not been able to hide from Tony's irritable senses.
"We've already figured that out," Clint interjected. "The most likely routes are being checked by agents."
A garbage can was in front of it and almost overflowed and papers and cardboard covered the narrow sidewalk in front of it. Teenagers heard loud music in an alley next to the house, which made Tony just roll his eyes.
He shouted to his people. Slowly, he walked to Tony. "General Astif, water please," he said to the man who had just gotten up from Pepper. Immediately, the man ran to fulfil the task. Almost caring, Burkwill tapped Tony on the back with his remaining fingers. He flinched for a moment as the man struck the spot where he just got kicked, but then he tried to calm down again. If the others were going to turn up, it had to happen now, he knew that, because if those crazy people could really see what he was doing, then they'd certainly watched the drop of the GPS transmitter from earlier. General Astif came running with water that Tony drank thirstily. "Dragenbach and Lang need some, too," Tony squeezed out, drinking about half of the bottle. He desperately tried to win time. It had been a mistake to drop the transmitter, he knew that now. He was too far away from Pepper and the other two to protect her in any way, and at any moment Burkwill would find out what he had done. And then the other three were dead.
"Boss, do you want a coffee?" Friday asked Tony.
Without hesitation, Friday had given them the coordinates of their aircrafts, and just less than an hour later - the plane was nowhere near as fast as the other two's - they landed nearby them.
Steve quickly pulled the shield out of his neck and wiped his forehead. His gaze swept across the battlefield, over to Bucky, who had just dealt a deadly blow to one being, but now headed straight for the next, over to Wanda, who was visibly exhausted trying to keep fighting, and over to Falcon, who was spinning in the air, and again and again flew toward the ground to kill more aliens.
Tony nodded, then turned his attention to the sea of lights below him, which was coloured by the setting sun in a dark purple light.
"Analyse the photos. What did you think?"
The first minutes of the journey were silent until Natasha cleared her throat. "Barnes will stay in the team. You should nourish yourself."
"Can you do that?", he finally asked and pointed to the stairs and with the other hand on Tony's upper body.
Clint was still clinging to Tony's armor. "She's the best," he shouted to the wind and was dropped off on the overturned ice cream truck.
"I'm sorry," she added.
"See, don’t blame me”, Tony said. “But to get to the important topics: What do you know about these Aliens?"
It took more than an hour before his mind calmed down and he fell into a light sleep.
So, now they have to be dealing with finding that guy. Hopefully they are fast enough.
The man paused to let his words take effect.
"Clint, can you support them?" He shouted to the archer. He took a last look at Steve and Bucky, who were now crowding into the thick tree and fighting. Again and again, aliens fell and made getting through harder for the next ones, but not impossible. The shield and arm pierced the unprotected areas and killed the aliens, but by no means enough of them.
Tony's eyes widened, and he saw that the other Avengers and agents who did not know about it yet, sat up. He heard Rhodey mumble something besides him and felt that Steve had sucked in air. Fury enlarged the picture with two fingers.
He would now go to the control room, turn off the ship's functions and hopefully prevent the now-dead brain from rebuilding and calling new ships and then he would be looking for Tony.
She touched her left hip and looked at them. Then she continued softly. "So, I was lying next to the path, but the ground was smooth, and suddenly I heard such a noise. I was afraid. It was the middle of the night, it could have been a boar. It made such a grunt, but a lot louder than I ever thought possible. Then I scratched back. There was a ditch with a river just a few feet behind me. And bushes stood on the bank, so I hid myself."
"Let Pepper go, I'll come wherever I have to go," he added, but the man just laughed. "You’ll get the information soon enough. But for today it is enough. I still have to feed prisoners. Oh yeah, and Stark," he added. "I want you alone."
"Oh no," Burkwill called. "Tell them why you're really here. Make sure Stark suffers - that he's going to suffer terribly when I cut your mendacious neck."
"That's what I'm saying."
"Oh, oh," Burkwill interrupted. "You need to calm down. After all, nobody feels up to an unpleasant visit from the police, right? I think I've found the problem with you, Stark. You have said it again. The dear Vision has by no means put
When they went to the conference room together two hours later, the other Avengers did not look much more awake than they did. Natasha kept talking to Steve about something that neither Tony nor Rhodey could understand. Vision stood alone in front of one of the windows and looked out of it thoughtfully, while Bucky sat at the table and hit with a pen a tune on it that only he knew. Tony wordlessly sat down two seats next to the soldiers. Fury was still missing, and some agents as far as Tony could tell. Besides, Clint was not there yet, and that surprised Tony.
"Friday, do we know anything about the people at the New York air force?" he asked, leaning over a little cable that he needed to connect to another one.
"What did you do to her?" he cried. He did not care that everyone that heard him could tell how desperate he was.
It had to be worse for Sam, who flew constantly in the air and probably the worst for Lang, who was small and repeatedly transported by Sam and thrown off in very specific places to hit the beings in the vulnerable places.
Clint looked at him and his eyes clearly said that he was just getting to that point. "Burkwill is the leader of a company called SafetyWorld, at least he owns that company and founded it. You've probably heard of this organization before. Ironically, they make weapons to send to exactly one party in a war. In Europe they supported Serbia, in the Middle East the rebels in Syria, in Egypt they sent arms to inhabitants of the cities. They are regularly organizers of marches against US interference in wars or support from weapons, also from European countries."
"I know. And that’s why I have to hurry now to get down so I can start the analysis before the therapy starts. And the therapy does not last too long, anyway."
“Between the pub and the hotel was a forest. A path led through it, and at this point, the forest was not so big, so I walked right through it. It was cold, but there was still no snow lying on the ground, it had just started to snow. I was pleased, you know, because of the flakes that were dancing and because my wife was still alive, and the worst was over and so on. Somehow, I slipped. I can still remember the pain. For two weeks, I had a bruise on my thigh."
Natasha was already on the next step when she turned around. "I'll go upstairs, then Mrs Lopez won’t have to wait that long."
"Yes, but I didn’t say at what time. You were here earlier than I expected," Burkwill admitted. "You are my present for midnight. By then, you four will stay with me and then they can all go one by one until I have just you, Stark, and my son has finally been avenged."
Steve shrugged. "The picture looked good, but how does that help us? I don’t know."
So, I hope you enjoyed the chapter. Thanks by the way for the kudos! That's super cool.
"Hmm," Tony muttered and let himself fall onto the chair. He pushed his hand over his face and just waited for a second.
Then Steve turned around. Tony had already seen his blond hair from the elevator. He had his lips pressed together and stared at Tony. It was a mixture of determination, grief, and self-assurance. And something else that Tony could not decipher. His eyes were on Steve a little longer. He studied the soldier. His eyes looked tired, like those of others. But unlike the others, he had no scratches or stains on his face drawing the previous fight.
Before Tony could answer, Friday talked on. "Miss Romanoff wants you to go upstairs, the painter of the picture could be found."
Oh, I will also ignore everything after Civil War, so no Spiderman-action here, nothing with Wakanda and stuff.
Tony felt his mouth open. He knew exactly which friend the man meant. The video showed the street where his parents had died. He felt Steve reach for his arm and hold him gently. He did not resist. Barnes sat petrified in the chair, then slowly turned to Tony. He shook his head. He did not want to watch the video again, and he saw that Barnes thought similarly.
"Are we here to talk about my relationship with Rogers?" Tony snapped back. "We really have better things to do."
"It’s a decision by the government, which probably serves for security. You can be glad you're fucking here, Rogers. The situation was much tenser a few hours ago."
"Then make sure that no information leaves the quarter from her. Turn her off in this room and in the SHIELD department as well. We have a security hole and it needs to be closed."
He saw out of the corner of his eye that Vision was straightening up and Natasha looked at him briefly as she changed places with Clint.
"Great, you did it, Stark. The
, he kept his secret out of fear of Steve's reaction. From the
"Excuse me, Miss?" a voice called from the audience. Natasha searched for the speaker. Barnes fumbled nervously at his shirt. "How can you talk about saving countries from catastrophes when every time you appeared so many people get injured or die?"
Still, Tony had to admit that the monster in the picture looked similar to the creature that lay a few floors below him in his workshop. With ink, the round belly had been painted with a brown colour, but the neck and hands were green and so was the face from which big horns grew. Still, the picture could simply be an unusual representation of the Shrek, a being from a well-known children's film. The outlines had been painted with a thick black brush and a sickle moon shone silver in the righthand corner of the picture. With a spiky handwriting, the boy had written "Malet av Bjarne",
There was a brief silence on the other side of the pipe. Then the road noise suddenly disappeared. "I just want you to know we care about you."
I had no idea how to put “a several hundred meters” into something with feet, so I had to use yards. Even though I think that’s nothing Americans use.
"Let it stop," said Lang suddenly. Tony choked.
Tony raised his eyebrows in surprise. He knew what it was like to grow up as a prodigy, so it surprised him all the more that he had never heard of the man. There should have been a huge craze for the boy in his childhood, especially at that time.
"It's always nice to see me being alive!"
At the same time, several bullets from the War Machine's armor and Tony's energy blasts shot at the tank. A loud explosion was to be heard and Rhodey and Tony were thrown backwards. "Shit", Rhodey shouted and Tony cursed as well.
Yeah, maybe he was not dead yet. The suit hold up a lot, maybe Tony was still alive and waiting like he did back in New York, just waiting for someone to shout loudly beside him.
"That Stark woke up is very good," Fury explained. "I’ll need to hear what you've been talking about, Rhodes. Today we’ll only explain that you all work together again and that Stark’s awake and that he’s doing well. We’ll completely refuse information about the aliens."
Steve moved restlessly beside him but said nothing. Again, they fell into silence, which lasted almost the entire ride, until a small noise broke the silence. Steve moved and looked at something - Tony didn’t even bother to take his eyes off the street.
The woman sat on the couch and read something.
And even if Steve liked him, they would never be friends anymore, because the fight a few months ago had changed everything between them. Tony wanted to sink in the ground. "I ..." he began to explain quietly but stopped when Burkwill went on. He felt Steve's eyes on him.
His thoughts jumped to Vision, who had always cooked and had become really good. His smile died shortly. "Did you invite Wanda? For the next time?"
But still, it was not the time for it. His mouth was furry and his neck hurt so he cleared his throat.
"Too many for us to know anything specific," Fury replied, continuing to speak. "But we were able to exclude the two ports in Florida because of the vegetation. Flights were in every area of the US at the time, but the proximity of the water says the aircraft was probably going down or up in Boston or New York. We also could not rule out Washington, Norfolk, Baltimore, Portland and some smaller airports," he continued.
A short text always ran underneath the woman in the line of the news:
The rough fingers touched the black button beneath the expensive mahogany table.
With little conviction, she shook his hand and gestured for the three to sit down. Tony pushed a chair around and was glad to finally be able to relax his ribs, even though the cold and hard wood was not as comfortable as a bed or upholstered chair.
Vision picked up speed and flew toward the brain. But when he was only five yards away, he bounced off the air. He remained motionless.
Eventually, it stopped abruptly.
He had to live, Steve told himself.
"Well then", Natasha ran off while talking, "then let's find the brain."
"Would I still be here, if not?"
It was quiet for a moment, the whole sound was gone and Steve and Tony exchanged a worried look. Then a jangle sounded again and a loud noise came from the loudspeakers that made the two men wince. "- lost. I repeat, we lost Agent James Corton. We had no chance to save him, but we know the position of his corpse."
"Steve?" He asked feebly. The soldier fended off another bullet and threw himself to Tony on the ground, behind a rock. "Thank goodness," the soldier murmured, pointing to the rock. "Put this on."
"How?" he asked him. "We damn well have a babbler among us who knows a lot. And if that's not the case, then it was Friday's fault that the psychopath knew pretty much
Tony's heart was throbbing too fast and he was sweating heavily, even if he was cold. Burkwill put his head into his hands, just for a moment. Just for a moment, everything was too quiet.
Vision shook his head. He spoke weakly. "Is not it. I wanted to give something back for being picked up. I wanted to bring the others back because you need them. You need the captain. But more important is that everyone else needs you, Tony."
Tony could not back down when he bumped into a work table. The louder he screamed, the more the knot loosened in his chest, which had grown ever larger since the psychopath's appearance.
"Great. Hurry up, Dummy! ", he shouted at the machine, while he already grabbed a wrench.
Tony stared at the bridge, where still several aliens were positioned. Some of the little beasts had broken out and were now running toward the groups of agents and Avengers with a helicopter circling overhead. "Is Fury working on them?" He shouted into the microphone.
In contact via the intercoms in their armour, Steve received the information from Falcon that more aliens were coming from the front. The situation became increasingly hopeless.
Tony stopped and looked around. The stairs landed directly in a living room with three old beige and red sofas arranged around a small wooden table. An empty vase graced him, or at least tried.
As the doors opened softly, his thoughts finally wandered to his experiments down in the workshop. The only pastime that made him forget all of that. Never, when he concentrated, did he think of Steve, Bucky, his mother or his own past. He sank into his work, often ate nothing, drank too little, worked through thirty-six hours at a stretch, sometimes even longer, when no one came down to remind him he needed to sleep.
"What do you want?", Natasha interrupted the unpleasant silence at that moment. Tony remembered that he had to tell Friday to give Natasha some presents for all the help. Steve still did not say anything, just looked at Tony.
Bucky stood in front of it and looked at the crowds in front of the building. On an uncomfortable wooden chair sat Nick Fury, who nodded to the group as they arrived. Wanda got up from her chair and walked to Steve to kiss him and Clint on the cheek three times, as was customary in Sokovia. Just recently she had started greeting them this way.
Guilt sneaked up in him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Stark had to fly. And since the only possibility to get rid of the threat is that he takes the
"Fine. Can I go now?" Tony asked annoyed and tried to move with his good arm in a vertical position, but jerked back immediately. He was glad that his ribs were apparently just bruised. That wouldn’t make the next months to hell but only bother him for a few weeks.
"The cars are ready. But maybe you would want to know something before, James," Peter Krum said more quietly, pointing meaningfully at Tony. The last bit of color disappeared from his face and, appropriately, he heard the thunder of heavy footsteps behind him. He did not have to turn around to realize that another
Slowly he reached one of the big, gray doors and climbed over corpses that covered the floor.
"Rhodeys?" He exclaimed. "What is he doing here?"
He stiffened as he recognized the face. Pepper was also noticeably restless and Burkwills grin did not help to calm the two. Tony grabbed Pepper's arm to give her a little grip and felt Steve's hands on his shoulders.
Vision coughed, and Tony looked around frantically. He did not have time for such a conversation and was not really able to respond. He did not know what he should feel about Vision. "We have to get out of here, right now," he tried to distract, but again the other struggled.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Mr. Krum is already on his way back here. He will arrive at any moment," a woman's voice with a strong Scottish accent answered from the other side of the bridge. Burkwill made words in his mouth that looked like he was saying, "She's smart," or something, but Tony could not tell. He was thinking again. They needed a moment more time.
Steve nodded. He knew he shouldn’t be so distracted by Tony. That wouldn’t do any good, but he still felt that the mechanic's situation was entirely down to his decisions.
Finally, he had found the pills and he quickly reached for the drops he had to take in the evening before he immediately ran out again. As he hurried out of his room, he almost collided with Clint, who was holding his suit over his arm and putting the coms in his ears with the other one. For a brief moment, both of them were in shock, but then Clint nodded to him.
They had been looking for Steve and Rhodey for over two hours now and hadn’t found anything yet. Concern about the three missing men was clearly written in their faces. Bucky tapped his foot restlessly on the floor, while Natasha stood silently at the window and just stared down.
Thanks for the kudos. I wish you all a nice weekend!
"Thank you," Tony bit off the last bit of his apple and threw it in the bin. "Tell Friday, she'll tell me. I have to work now."
"Yes," he replied curtly. He gritted his teeth and Tony could understand his annoyance. He would feel the same way if he was not allowed to operate. But at least that was about him, not Steve. He did not want to allow feelings, but he was glad that the soldier wanted to fight for him.
"We'll be there in a few minutes," the driver said through an intercom.
Together they climbed into the elevator and waited for the doors to open again.
Tony shook his head. "I forgave you long ago. If you came back a week later, it would have been okay." He laughed sarcastically. "There was only my ego that was to big to call you. Still, you could have told me about my parents earlier," Tony tried to joke, but it fell flat. Steve froze, as if afraid.
Tony could see Burkwill pressing his jaw together before turning to his people. "Good," he called. "General Astif!"
"And one more thing," Bucky Barnes said before Tony could hang up. “SHIELD will have a crisis meeting tomorrow with all the present Avengers and agents. Results should be exchanged, and the further acting discussed. Tomorrow, at five, all of us are expected in Stark's meeting room. And Steve,” he added, “you are being asked to stay in the quarters, again."
Carelessly he threw the sand next to him and kept searching. Suddenly he felt something hard. Steve closed his eyes briefly. The panic vanished when he saw the red rails protecting Tony's legs. Relieved, Steve dropped his head. "Thanks," he mumbled. "At least you don’t do that to us."
The doors of the town hall were pushed open when the group arrived and closed again by several security guards. A reporter had tried to run after them, but just before he managed to get in, the door was slammed shut. A man in a suit took over the leadership of the group.
As the monster ran towards him, he quickly turned to avoid the deadly hit of the big claw. With a roar, the creature turned back to Steve when he noticed no resistance on his hand. Angrily, it looked at the captain. At least that's how Steve felt, he was not sure if the creatures had emotions.
With every passing day, Tony became more restless. He stood in his workshop or had the therapy done, working alone or in private company with Rhodey or sometimes Steve on his suit or those of the other Avengers.
He had to see if Steve was okay and had sneaked into his room, just to sit on the bed and then be too tired to get up again. The next morning he was cuddled by the larger one, while the soldier had just smiled at him. The decision to move was then just made.
"What happened to the ‘we-look-each-other-into-the-eye’?"
"Peter!" Burkwill called. "Would you please get the cars ready to start? I think our guests are getting cold."
In his suit, he flew over the sea of lights of the state's capital, as Friday reported him a message. He accepted it, almost curious of what would happen.
Steve had forgotten that he had another job. But he nodded. Slowly, he started toward the door, certain that anyone who stood there was staring at him or at the burning point in the air right now.
The next chapter will be coming Saturday or Sunday.
Tony had forgotten the two things and was now glad that the little robot could do such work. Tony found the slime rather quickly. It seemed to be somewhat dry and was deposited directly over a particularly large pimple. The mechanic made a choking sound as he carefully removed the flaky mass from the monster with the tweezers and put it into the test tube. It looked like jelly, he realized. The mucus was slightly yellow, but you could see it. "Take this over there," Tony told his robot who carefully placed the test tube in a machine so that the artificial intelligence could take a closer look at the substance.
Tony loved that look. For a week now, Steve came to him every day, because for a week he accompanied Bucky at his therapy. Every day, the soldier, who had been denied nearly all chances of a real recovery at the beginning, got a little bit stronger. It was Steve's achievement, Tony knew that.
Tony could barely remember what had happened. He had to have pushed away from Steve and then run to the suit. He still remembered the other's face. He had seen tears in those blue eyes, but he had let him go. Steve had understood him, maybe he had the whole time.
Tony looked at her. "I don’t know. Without authorized access, it's nearly impossible to turn her off, let alone to get that kind of private information."
Tony shivered as he took a step back. Steve looked forced quiet and Tony's heart throbbed faster. He could hardly think right.
Steve's hand tapped nervously on the couch and his leg wobbled. Bucky was sitting next to him, but Steve didn’t really care. He looked at the big screen in front of him, on which a woman said something he barely noticed.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'll go," he decided. It was still his fault, he knew it. He would have to end the fight. "Tony, no!" Shouted at least three people at the same time, but he knew he had to do it.
Too much had happened. The fight in Germany, the prison, the break. The fight against the aliens. Tony.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony felt the smile on Steve's face. For days he has been talking about Tony, who has actually asked to take Bucky with him to eat in the city. The two had not seen each other too often in the last few days, but Steve was eager for the two men to build a good friendship.
Tony rubbed his hand over his forehead. "I let Friday check the environment again. Who saw or heard something? Who knows places where someone could hide? Maybe there is still a weak signal. I'll let her see through everything."
"Jesus," he mumbled. "What happened?"
"That's too many," one of the agents interjected, and Fury stared at him.
"And people say it's a simple life when you're friends with a billionaire," Rhodey muttered just loud enough for Tony to hear.
Rhodey nodded and breathed in loud. His chest went fast and Steve could see that the man was struggling to stay in control. "You could have saved him, but no! Captain America wanted to play hide and seek!" he exclaimed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Exhaling, the mechanic threw his head against the door, causing him a throbbing pain, but he did not care. He had his answer on how Jamie had probably felt. Jamie Handerson, presumably a young man still living his life, was drafted to rescue his family. He could have hidden, could have walked, no one in this place would have come after him. Nevertheless, he had faced his fate and went off to Europe. And maybe he was the one soldier who finally decided the war. Just when Tony wanted to jump up, there was a knock at his door.
and one or two people. But the tank’s ... "
Understanding, Natasha nodded. "Can we get more information?"
"He's a mendacious, filthy, disgusting piece of sh-" Tony shouted, earning amazed looks from his teammates, but Burkwill interrupted him.
"You're damn good, Stark," Natasha grinned.
There was no way I could cut this chapter, so this is nearly 5000 words long. Yey.
stood there, carved into the old wooden floor.
And he could not even remember a mail or a letter, he could not remember anything. It had passed him, as many other deaths probably did. And now he got his revenge. Somehow he could understand it, even if it hurt. Maybe it was the run he had to take, even though everything was levelling out right now.
He had been injured, why wasn’t he allowed to have a time off?
"What now?" Bucky shouted through the com.
Natasha opened her mouth, but Clint was faster. He had a stitched wound on his forehead, as Tony noticed, and leaned over to be closer to the microphone.
"But remnants of his equipment would still have to be found, especially in the puddles," the Winter Soldier retorted, his voice calm. Tony shook his head, though he knew the man was right. "Chemical changes in the water due to reactions in the weapon," the killer probably read out.
"Mr Rogers found Mr Stark nearby Toms River a few days ago. He’s got some injuries but will recover soon."
He was bad, and he had a headache. The doctors had examined him very closely. A wound on his upper body had become infected and one of the nurses had given him an ointment on the open area, which then burned and twitched, but at least not as bad as the arm and the ribs. But his blood levels had not improved and it should be re-examined.
Tony quickly tried to redirect his thoughts and moved his left arm, which worked just fine. Slowly, to avoid unnecessary pain he lifted it. He reached out and tried to grab a small hollow in the sand, where some old parts of his destroyed suit had accumulated.
His brain stopped working, Tony thought. He had closed his eyes and felt only the touch on his lips, until Steve broke away to take a breath. He still felt the other's taste on him.
But not with the man. Lasse Van Peeters had lost his wife while fighting in Vietnam, that’s at least what Natasha had told them on their way there. The only child, by this time with own children, was living in the Netherlands again, as Lasse's parents did, but he visited the father occasionally. Van Peeters had met his second wife in the army, but only five years later she had died in Afghanistan, Natasha explained, and Tony could remember his dismay.
and you were in the same house as we were for months? You are a monster, nothing more and nothing less; a monster!"
The soldier nodded and thought of the conversation. "He's ... well, he’s got his reasons."
"The picture was uploaded just hours after the attack. She could have done it, yes, but it looks too good, too accurate, to paint with the few television images that existed at the time."
Tony couldn’t hear an answer, but then he clearly heard that several chairs were moving and people were slowly leaving the room.
"They are safe with me."
"Some were sent away from the Broadway," Bucky explained. "They were waiting there because there was no room left."
"Why?" asked Tony with a slight annoyance in his voice. “As far as I know he just went out jogging.”
"I can’t," he whispered desperately. He closed his eyes.
"The names of the criminals can be found in the appendix, as well as reasons why they all have to be imprisoned for life. It's dangerous to let them run around. In search of revenge, they would kill innocent people and they would not be better than you. They would be murderers if they are not already. They would be monsters, because they are incapable of being something else. They do not think ahead. Families would be torn apart because they would attack you on the street. Parents would die, children would die."
"Really?"
"With me, I told you," the man replied and smiled. Tony wanted to puke. That perfect smile made him aggressive. "Oh, Stark, it's almost Roger's birthday. I hope you already have a present?"
"How did you get the idea that you should keep this to yourself? For three months have you been living with agents since then, and you didn’t say shit? Almost every week, you fucking saw me. That was not only dangerous but stupid as well. We were unprepared. How do we look to this man now?"
"Tony?" he asked stunned and forgot to fight.
A scream was heard through the coms. Falcon fell down hardly.
"Art?"
He hobbled wordlessly to the door and turned back to Steve. "If you want something – a drink, a snack - then go to the fridge there. I’ll be back soon. Please don’t break anything. Friday, will you please stop him if he does?" he teased, watching Steve's lips twist into a smile.
Tony's eyes wandered to Vision. He did not know what he should do. He had used the situation to help the two agents, but as naive as it sounded, he had assumed Burkwill would release all the prisoners. Burkwill had judged him correctly.
Excitedly, Steve went on. Adrenaline rushed through his body as he found more and more parts of the Iron Man Suit.
Steve was quiet for a moment too long.
"Calm down," he shouted. “Quiet.”
Bucky just didn’t seem to get tired next to him. The corpses of the dead beings were already piled up at his feet, and more and more were coming.
Steve had to use all his strength not to back down. He had never seen Fury so uncontrolled about Tony. He swallowed.
Again they fell into silence, which was almost unpleasant. Earlier, Tony recalled, they had often talked about something. And once they were silent, then it had not been unpleasant.
"Then please show me a place where I can land safely and undetected."
Bucky started up in his seat. "Where are they?" he shouted. "Crap."
He shook the thought of the man aside and climbed into the plane. It took less than five minutes and Steve was in the air and the Avengers' headquarters behind him.
"Agent McKinnes, your department starts searching for the source of the video immediately. Agent Malbour, you make sure none of that information leaves the room, Agent Kinsley, you must-"
Steve shook his head. Obviously he was not the only one Tony was important enough to, to not follow the director's instructions. "Can you contact him?"
"Do you have anything, Rhodes?" he exclaimed while flying, but the other one said no.
It took a minute before Steve nodded enough for Tony to notice. By now he had closed his eyes and listened only to the regular heartbeat of the larger one.
"Fuck the brainwash," Tony murmured under his breath as he pressed the button on the elevator.
"Pepper needs help," he finally said desperately. "You said I'm going to be an exchange for her."
"I know you didn’t want to do that," he rasped quietly, "but you did. And it doesn't matter what you say, you know that. Not, if you act differently." Tony fell silent. He didn’t want to do this, but Steve sat next to him and stared at him as if everything was alright. As if Tony didn’t know what he knew and as if he had never hit him with a shield when he was already down. He swallowed.
Tony had barely touched his pizza when the alarm rang. The pizza was cold by now, but the fat had disturbed his work and, in addition, his hunger had flown away relatively quickly, after Rhodey had given him not only lunch but also a terrible tincture, which he had to eat according to the doctors. It was now close to five, the meeting was scheduled to start in less than ten minutes.
Before he knew it, he had picked up the cell phone and was about to press the contact list when he remembered what he was doing. He sighed and waited for something to happen, he just hold the cold phone in his hands. But nothing happened, everything was as quiet as always, as
His clothes were even more water-filled than he thought was possible, and his shoulder exploded with pain. For a moment, Tony thought he did not have the strength to kick his legs and swim to the surface of the lake, which moved away from him at a great speed. There was a rush in his ears and he suddenly had memories of Afghanistan, so he was panting with panic. He choked and coughed, but at that moment a hand grabbed him and pulled him up with enormous force. When Tony broke through the water, he was in a cave.
"Yes, I saw that."
The next chapter will hopefully be out next weekend. I wish you all a nice week!
Music began to play, which Tony might have expected in a western movie. A guitar jingled while the red line continued to describe its path. Now it had made a strong north-westerly turn, and as the lane began to take a nearly linear course, the sound of a striking bomb blared from the loudspeakers. Tony winced and held his head, feeling immediately reminded of Afghanistan. The noise was about to fade as it repeated, louder this time, but screams were heard in the background. Tony could not hide a small tremor of his hand. At that moment the door opened as Steve entered. Within the last few days, Tony had given him an access key so he would not always have to open the door for the soldier.
