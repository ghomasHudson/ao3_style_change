He kissed Steve on the forehead. Tony went to the bathroom, soaking a hand towel, before going back to the bedroom. Steve smiled softly at him. He rinsed the blood from the omega's skin. Tony bit his lip as a trail of water dripped down the omega's chiseled chest. It shouldn't be turning him on as much as it did. Steve purred, pressing into his touch, enjoying the grooming. He tucked Steve into bed. When he tried leaving Steve’s arm wrapped possessively around his waist. He was given a small taste of Steve’s strength when he attempted to move.
“I don’t know. It didn’t go too good last time,” said Piper. She toyed with a block. “Will it help Papa if I do? Make him less stressed.”
Piper stared at the door, mentally willing Winter to come back inside. She hated being alone with this woman. Lena was
“I’m okay. I'm really sick of that question." Piper noticed the blood dripping down Papa's forehead. She reached out slowly, wiping it from his forehead. "You're not."
Even the most minuscule task that could prove helpful in finding Piper would ease the weight of his guilt. But Steve and Tony were left feeling –being- utterly useless. There was nothing for them to chase.
Steve bit his lip. Could his relationship with Tony be completely influenced by the pheromones he was releasing?
“You’ll be better at than you think. I've seen you do amazing things, you can do this too,” said Steve.
The smell of his distress flooded the room. Edith hit the vent button airing out the room. Thankfully, the walls were scent proof and soundproof.
Steve moved away from the couch, angrily pacing. Edith moved closer to Tony. Far enough for Steve not to think she was after his alpha, but close enough to use as protection.
Steve didn’t want to know what Nat would do to Kate if he told her. He may not be fond of her, but she didn’t deserve Natasha’s vengeance.
Steve tensed. He hadn’t thought about terminating his pregnancy. With his first pregnancy, it was the only desired option, despite the risks. He'd heard the horror stories of what omega and beta women did to eliminate an undesired pregnancy even it meant putting their lives at risk. Then he was willing to take the risk. The idea of doing it now was sickening. He didn't believe he was worthy of having a child yet here he was pregnant. All he could do was try to best follow the example his mother set while raising him.
Helmut turned to the front page frowning when he saw the cute image of Piper Stark. It was unheard of for a missing child to stay on the front page for so long. If her parents were anyone else, people would have moved on by now.
“Sorry.” He was trying to be less dependent on his mate. Steve wanted to be stronger. Tony needed him.
“That goo to know. But we will get to that point naturally. We may not even reach the topic today. But you can’t blame for being fascinated by your project. It's not every day; I see something like this.”
Steve looked in the backpack Natasha gave him. It held U.S passport and Brazilian money. When pulled open the drawer and saw a few days worth of clothes.
Steve moved closer. Tony was having difficulty processing. Years of war taught Steve how to deal with death. How could he help Tony through it?
Steve emerged from his cramped shelter. He got his feet, searching for any danger. Steve clawed angrily at Alpha’s armor. Off, he needed it off! The mask came away. He nuzzled him. Alpha pulled away again. A loud, high-pitched whine left him, begging him to stay.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said. He hadn’t meant to reveal all of that; he had purposely not looked at that memory… but the words slipped out anyway.
They went to the basement. Daddy sat next her in a bean bag chair. He seemed to trust the doctor. She knew her parents wouldn’t let his woman near if she were a true threat. Bloom started with some softball questions. Piper was sure she could handle her without her dad’s support.
He quickly covered it with his hand. Steve covered his head with a pillow, trying to block out the conversation, a blush burning his cheeks.
“Hey.” Tony wasn't sure which of them looked worse. He hadn't gotten a good look at himself for a while. Steve hadn’t shaved, giving him a more rugged look. He'd enjoy it more if it weren't for the circumstances. But it wasn't just a few missed shaves. No, it was a sign of guilt. Stress had earned Steve a few gray hairs of his own.
The rest of the day went by smoothly. Steve went to his room. It didn’t feel cozy. He got his isle ready he would likely use it later tonight. Steve took a book from the shelf in his room. He turned on the TV to fill the silence. The nature channel was on. Steve settled on the couch. At twelve he tried sleeping, only to wake up an hour later, drenched in cold sweat. The room stunk of his distress. He cracked the window, letting in a cool breeze. His fingers twitched ready to paint anything to try and get the images out of his mind. He squeezed the colors onto his pallet. A rough image of birdlike cages came into inside them were living skeletons. The conditions he found soldiers in he was incapable of describing. It was lucky he’d found Bucky and the other so quickly. At least Bucky was strong enough to walk on his own. And the smell was horrible. It was stentch that lingered in his memory. His phone ringing brought him out of his gruesome thoughts.
"I'm not asking you to give up on your friends. Happy is family. But I think he'd agree with me on this," he said. Steve got up, drained both physically and mentally. And he was done. He went to their room, shutting the door behind him.
They parked in a small gravel lot. In front of them was a small rectangular diner with chrome finish. The sign outside read Sam’s Diner. It seemed to be rather oddly placed in the middle of nowhere.
It was a black and white image of Tony and Piper. The infant pup had fallen asleep against his chest. One of her small hands rested against the arc reactor as Tony gently kissed her head. Tony couldn't remember the exact day of the moment. It was something that happened so regularly when she was a baby.
Tony rolled a fresh sheet of paper on the table. Piper preferred working out everything on paper. She'd have to get out of the habit when she was older.
“There won’t be others?” asked Steve, possessively clutching the alpha’s hand to his chest. He wasn't going to share.
A muzzle was locked around his mouth and nose. A sweet-smelling gas filled his senses he couldn't keep his eyes open. Steve fought the losing battle against its effects, with every passing second his eyes grew heavier. He had to protect his pup. Steve gazed up at his attacker whimpering. He hated the noise how pathetic it made him feel, but he was desperate to protect his child. She was more important than his pride.
Piper woke pressed between Theodore’s chest and the glass wall of their cell. Lunch was waiting untouched on the floor. She raised her head.
“What happens when it comes? Will I have to go to a facility? I can’t go back one of those places,” said Steve.
Steve yawned. He huddled close to Tony. Their forms were sticky and sweaty, but he didn’t care. Showering could wait until morning. Tony huddled close to him.
“It was his failure in training, Rune landed me with an alpha pup who was mentally destroyed. It took years for me to reshape Rune’s mind into something that even resembled functionality.”
Nurses came running down the hall, passing in front of the glass window of his encloser. On the first gurney was Rumlow’s boy. The second was Piper.
“In the Shawlands. Hunter Smith was last seen leaving a bar called the Water Trough. His apartment is only five minutes from the bar," said Tony.
Jet lag wouldn’t allow him to sleep. Steve took the knife from his utility belt, cutting open the boxes. They were filled with high-end art supplies. There were watercolors, charcoal, a large assortment of oil paints, canvas, sketchbooks, and stretcher bars. It was a dream art kit. He found a note inside:
“Yes.” Maybe it would be better for him to reach his own definition. “Did you want to get back here, more than you normally do?”
"You set down the foundations for many women and omega rights activists. It would be impossible for you not to. An omega who defied the rules joined the military and became one of Earth's great's heroes."
“He can if you let him; otherwise, it’s a waste. And you won’t be able to scare him away like you did the other.”
Steve's feet tapped nervously. He told Tony he'd be back as soon as he could. And he tried. He did all he could do to get them out of there as fast as possible.
"Tony?" Steve relaxed when Tony entered the room. The alpha got into bed with him, resting his head on Steve's stomach. The alpha purred, causing him to as well. Steve put down the baby book, marking the page. He ran his fingers through Tony's hair.
The confidence in Tony’s voice was such a reassurance, but Steve didn’t accept it. Bucky’s death was on his hands.
Piper collapsed into Tony’s chest, wailing. It was an ungodly sound that made his instincts go rigid. He picked her up, hugging her tightly to him, hushing her the best he could.
The alpha kneeled in front of her. The switch was within arm's reach, but she didn’t try to grab it. One false move and Winter went boom.
He deeply breathed in the scent of the aroused being beneath him. His reaction was swift. Steve’s purring grew louder. The scent of his slick became powerfully alluring. Tony rolled them over, hovering over the beauty. Steve's skin flushed a wonderful shade of pink. Tony threw off his shirt. He caught Steve’s soft pink lips in a kiss. Their tongues danced in a messy kiss only pulling away for only a moment.
“Patch me up,” he said, handing her a suture kit. “I can’t." Showing his broken fingers. "And you need to learn."
“She was one of the most patient women I’ve ever met and was very quiet in her kindness. Never one to make a fuss about all she did,” he said.
Piper clutched her daddy's hand. Why did it have to be a beta? She knew that not all betas were terrible. But, it was harder to trust them.
Tony turned Steve in his seat. The omega rested his head against his chest. He carded his fingers through Steve's hair.
“You couldn’t save the president with the suit. How are we going to save Steve and Pepper with nothing?”
“He’s a Hydra operative. I've encountered him before. Over the decades he's been off and on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar. We only theorized he may be like you. Him going toe to toe with you on an equal level only furthers supports this belief. He may have been the sniper that deactivated your birth control," she said.
There was nothing special about the flash drive itself. It could be bought at any office supply store. This method of infecting a computer system was so primitive. There were easier ways to breach a system without having physical contact with it.
“With this ring I, Anthony Edward Stark, take you, Steven Grant Rogers, for my lawful husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part. I will love and honor you all the days of my life.” He slid the ring on Steve’s hand.
“I’m not sure what to think of you, Piper. With your guard up, I can’t deem whether it’s reasonable or not. I know only the very basics of your situation. But I know you’re in mourning. It seems that you haven’t given yourself time to mourn.”
“I got just the thing.” He went his suit, pressing down on one of the panels. It opened. “This is a pinata for a cricket. I’m kidding it’s a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face and twist the button on top and it discourages bullying. Not lethal just to cover one’s ass. Deal?”
Barbara Stanwyck – born July 16, 1907, in Brooklyn New York. She was an actress, model, and dancer. Barbara was a film and television star known during her sixty-year career as a professional with a realistic screen presence.
Tony was hunched over his lab desk, working on his most recent suit. That's where the alpha found some element of comfort. His mate didn't respond to his presence. He wrapped his arms around Tony's neck, resting his chin on the alpha's shoulder. Tony squeezed his hand, kissing it briefly. Steve breathed in his scent, but it didn't offer him the support he was seeking.
“I hardly ask you to do anything. Some of our more traditionalist clients like the comfort of knowing there’s still an alpha in control of the company."
Piper walked over to him, reaching out her hands toward him. Steve quickly took up the offer holding her close.
"We aren't acting until we know exactly what we're facing. I don't want to wait either. But I will if it means ensuring our daughter's safety," said Steve.
"A week probably more. I had the nurse set the TV to his channel so he could binge watch his favorites show."
The late morning could be blamed on nearly a week without sleep. He craved the closeness of his alpha.
Winter clutched the examination table. It creaked under his strength. She was more than that. His arm went limp, hanging loosely from him. What did the beta woman have planned?
“You and him both have no understanding of the concept of freewill or little chance to experience it without bad consequences.”
“It’s fine, sweetheart. I can get a new tub." Tony nuzzled the bite mark he left. Steve went weak in the knees, bracing himself in the counter.
He nuzzled closely his alpha’s neck. Steve tensed when there was a sharp pain in his jaw. He ran his tongue over his teeth. His canines had sharpened and lengthened. His want to mark the alpha was enough to cause the reaction.
“I’m sorry, Papa.” Piper kissed him on the cheek. "I'll find a way to fix it. I promise. I don’t want you hurting.” She wanted to help him so badly. Papa was good. He didn't deserve to have such a problem. Papa hugged her bringing him close to his chest.
“I was in middle something. What’s so important that the Sectary of World Security calls me in person.”
Tony set breakfast on the bedside table. Steve handed her off. She cooed too young to purr. Tony settled into the nest with him. Piper rested comfortably on the alpha's chest.
“I can’t put someone undeserving through that. Neither of us needs any more guilt on our conscious,” said Steve.
“It only applied to mated pairs. What I have with you is the strongest connection I’ve ever had with another person. Only prove how great a mistake it was for me to push you away. I’ve never had anything like this before." Tony tensed but swiftly relaxed Steve nuzzled against his neck. Steve tenderly licked at his bruises. He shivered at the touch. “I don’t know what I did to earn you in my life, but I’ll try to be deserving of it."
Steve remembered the mess he’d walked into which hadn’t had the chance to fully absorb until now. The penthouse was a mess.
Rune nodded. Nervously looking at the door as if he expected them to burst into the room just by mentioning them.
The smile faded from his expression, but he refused to reveal the full burden of what he was feeling in the presence of a stranger.
“I decapitated a dummy,” said Steve. Laughter came through the line. He didn’t think it was particularly, but Tony seemed to find it hilarious.
Steve jumped to his feet as explosions went off behind him. Chitarui came at him. He disarmed and killed them. After that, the police listened. Steve rejoined his team, taking an enemy troop in the process. Thor landed moments later.
Steve opened his eyes from his most recent blackout he couldn't stay conscious longer than ten minutes. He rested on his side, pressing his fevered skin against the cool cement floor. His heart was beating rapidly. He bit back a whine as Extremis coiled through his aching muscles.
Steve woke up the early next morning to the sound of his phone ringing. He quietly left the bed taking his phone into the bathroom.
"You are thinking too traditionally, Steve. Many people have gone through what you're experiencing. There are entire books about it. I would recommend The Feminine Mystique it tackles that exact subject. It was written by a female omega,"
Piper carefully placed the lego figure in his hand. She'd missed and matched pieces to make a Winter Soldier. The remains of the figures she used to make him were scattered across the table. A pirate was missing its head, a robot without an arm, and a woman missing her hair.
Natasha would do anything to get Clint back to himself and to his family as safely as possible. It was the very least she could do.
Steve nodded. He moved away the alpha could remove his shirt, revealing a beautiful glowing blue circular light.
“I’m sorry miss.” Helmut’s eyes widen slightly at the beautiful omega woman in front of him. She had wavy short brown and green-blue eyes. The dullness of her uniform did little do take away from her beauty. He was a faithful husband and mate but there was no harm in admiring. It was like appreciating a fine piece of artwork.
“You think I’m calm? Shit, I’m barely holding it together. We’re falling apart at the seams.” Tony clenched his left arm, a ghost pain surging awake.
“That is preferable, but other physically loving touches will help prevent such reaction from occurring again."
Art class ended all too soon and Piper was brought to the training room. Winter was there. Her small relief at seeing him was ruined when she realized a bomb vest was strapped to him.
“It was their mother,” said Steve. The scene pried at his heart. These animals hadn’t asked for this; they were somehow tested or infected by whatever caused them to be this size. It was clear the cubs were in physical pain. Whatever gave them their strength and size was also killing them slowly and agonizingly.
Was that really all? Was it so easy to unsettle the child? Did he want to know if more happened? There were no marks or bruising on the pup. But some methods didn't leave behind bruises.
"Captain America can haul 580 time his weight. Theoretically, without the use of Extremis or the activation of the super-soldier dose she received while still in the womb, she could potentially do the same. What happened today was the activation of both the super-soldier serum and Extremis. I believe we’re only scratching the surface of what she’s capable of doing in that state."
Winter washed off the blood the best he could in a public bathroom and changed into his civilian clothes. His hands were shaking. He clutched the counter taking a breath. What were these emotions weighing on his chest? It was heavy, unbearable. Pain, he could adjust to. This was new. He hoped, in time, he’d adjust to this, as well.
Rune's beating seemed so much worse than anything Sir had ever inflicted on her. All she wanted was to take away his pain. She purred. Rune mimicked the sound. The gentle tune of the sound was relaxing. They purred at a frequency linked to reducing stress and encouraging healing. Piper’s eyes started to droop, and she yawned before snuggling closer Rune. He was nice and warm.
She laughed. “You don’t know what happen the last time we did that. Otherwise, you wouldn't have made that suggestion."
The distant shatter of ice as the door to the base opened. Followed by heavy military footsteps. He counted three. They were getting close.
“I fully intend to. I think it will be best to handle this personally. You are too close to this Hill,” said Fury.
Pepper calmed down enough to realize the horrible stench she was standing in. It mixed horribly with Tony’s natural scent. She gagged slightly. The general rule with all omega was they typically smell sweet.
Rhodes got a bagel for going back to the room. Steve stood frozen in front of the window with Piper asleep in his arms. The only time he’d break from stance was to tend to Piper. He wouldn't be able to get through to him, but he could offer the comfort of his presence. Steve kept waiting for his bond to break with Tony, but it remained steady. It was late when Tony was brought into the room. His chest was wrapped in bandages. Steve handed Piper off to Rhodes, rushing to his mate’s side. Dr. Wu stood proudly by Tony’s bedside.
Steve wasn’t sure if he was ready for such a step yet. It was hard enough for him to come here alone.
“I have to go, sweetheart,” he said. Tony risked getting closer. Steve rested his head on his lap. He ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, lulling him back into a near sleeping state. Tony carefully rested Steve’s head on a pillow.
The elevator stopped on a lavish penthouse. It screamed expensive but in a relatively untacky way. The room was an open layout. Multiple rooms were mixed seamlessly into one. The view was incredible. It was as if he were looking out on the entire city. It had grown immensely. It was ever-changing.
“Your scent makes my mouth water, among other things,” said Tony, pressing their hips together, showing Steve exactly what he meant.
He shoved the book to the bottom of the stack. The other books were more reasonable. He started reading. Steve was halfway through one of the books when Tony came up. He marked the page he was on, before closing it.
"Do we really need him? It's been quiet. What is so pressing that you need to use, Captain Rogers?" asked Barny.
Steve shook away the thought. Where was his home? His old apartment building was destroyed and replaced decades ago.
Tony was left in the living room with Edith. The two of them had formed a mutual understanding. They still didn't particularly like each other but were able to keep a professional relationship.
She pulled up Piper's blood results. There were no traces of it in the sample. Hmmm. Yesterday's incident hadn't fully activated Piper's potential. That was only a peek behind the curtain. The Extremis present in Piper’s DNA likely stabilized when it mixed with super serum already present in the child’s make up. Even in if it weren’t it could likely be stabilized by editing the cure Stark developed. Anger wasn’t the right trigger. But she believed she knew what was. She would have to wait a little longer until she could test it. Lena smiled.
The beta stepped forward without fear. She slowly approached, touching her fingers to his neck. His pulse was steady.
Steve’s cries sent the alpha into a full feral mindset. Fear overrode Steve’s common sense, sending him into a feral state. He watched as his alpha fought. Another alpha came close, grasping him by the neck. He yelped. A blue-white light blasted through the rival head. He scrambled under the shelter of a table. The collar constricted painfully around his neck, making it difficult to breathe.
“If I clear the rotors this thing won’t re-engage without a jump. I’m going to have to get in there and push,” said Tony.
"Sorry." He pushed nose to Tony's neck, picking up on the worried tones in the alpha's scent. “Where are we?”
He slowly opened his eyes. A small adorable bundle was curled against Tony's chest. All he could see was tuft thick dark brown hair. He hurriedly sat up to get a better look at her.
The gash on his side had mended. Steve put the belt on loosely. A doctor came in to tend Tony’s injuries. She also brought scrubs for them to change into. The shirt didn't completely cover his stomach.
Steve could tell she didn't fully believe him. He would do anything to make her believe him. She used to trust him fully.
"It's normal considering how recently you were bonded. There's nothing to be ashamed of. We have to take precautions we wouldn't want to risk anyone getting upset," said Bruce.
He carded his fingers through his hair. Eventually, he surrendered and joined his mate. Steve was spread eagle on the bed, taking up all the space. The omega was snoring peacefully in a deep sleep. He couldn't get into bed without waking up his mate. He settled in the nesting couch.
Steve got into the tub. He was tired before and now he was exhausted now. Tony got in behind him. He yawned. Steve was jolted from his drowsy state when Tony’s tongue lapped over the bite mark on his neck. It was healing but at a much slower pace. Tony continued to nuzzle, lick, and nip at him causing him to purr. This behavior was due to where the bite's placement. He’d bitten into his scent gland, which also explained the alpha’s tending behavior. Alphas rarely bit an unclaimed omega in such an area outside of heat. Dry bites only happened with unbounded omega alpha pairs that were close to claiming each other. It was only a heat of the moment thing. He wished it could lead to more. The thought escaped him when Tony started washing his hair, working out the tangles.
He didn’t want to tell Tony of his suspicions. There was nothing to tell yet. He just needed an excuse to get out. Steve heard his phone ringing from the bedroom. He ran to get it.
Steve took the pot from the drawer. He finished his task then went to the sink to help Tony with the remaining potatoes. Tony had barely gotten halfway done. The alpha seemed more focused on the peeler.
Tony quickly changed putting on a cap, scrubs, and mask. He walked into the sterile room. Steve lay on the table an anesthesiologist was closely watching Steve’s vitals. A curtain hid the area incision from Tony’s direct view. From the gallery Fury, Natasha, and Clint were watching. Tony took notice of the restraints binding Steve’s arms and legs.“Take those off."
Winter stared at the boy, waiting to feel something. It was just a person. A stranger that meant nothing to him. Piper had something about her. Something familiar.
Steve set the water to boil. He wrapped his arms around Tony nuzzling against him. Tony reached his hand back to stroking his hair.
In front of him was the machine, the source of his agony. There was nothing else he could do but accept his fate. He gave up, letting his head fall against the floor. A pair of polished dress shoes appeared at the forefront of his vision.
"No, but he was the cause of many of mine," said Bruce. Piper never met his alter ego, something for which he was grateful.
Winter studied the pup sleeping across him. How could she sleep peacefully knowing he was there? He closed his eyes quickly when the pup started waking.
Tony hoped there was strawberry ice cream in the freezer. He didn’t want to deal with reaction if they didn’t.
Tony bent down, taking Steve's nipple into his mouth. At the same time, he twisted his fingers in the motion for his omega to come. Steve wailed softly, convulsing around Tony’s fingers. Slick soaked his hand. Tony's fingers pulled away. The omega moved into his lap. His mind went blank as Steve slid into onto his length.
“Last year Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only we’re not alone, but we are hopelessly hilariously outgunned,” said Fury.
And it's true that the largest donation given to the MoMA was 100 million dollars going to a 400 million expansion.
Steve puttered about the kitchen, not quite knowing what to do now. He busied himself with starting a stew, the large pot simmering on the stovetop. It was a meal reserved for special occasions. There was no point in starting anything else until it was done. He sat in the massive kitchen. Some of the appliances were updated, but Jarvis had changed little else.
“Your mate won’t mind me dancing with you?” asked Thor. Hesitantly putting his hand on Steve's back.
“And you tasted so sweet,” he whispered. Steve turned a deeper shade of red. Tony raised Steve's chin, kissing him. "You still have one more present to open."
"The second part of the Godfather series. I thought that would be that natural choice," said Jarvis.
“Or what?” Steve bit his lip, stopping himself from whining at the feel of the alpha’s warm breath against his skin. Tony laughed. It was bitter, not the sweet warm sound he was used to. It was meant to hurt him and he couldn’t say it didn’t. Before now it always felt they were always laughing together. He was being ridiculed by someone he cared for. It hurt so deeply. He reminded himself Tony was only lashing out because he was hurt.
The metal door creaked open. Piper was weakly holding Lena's hand. The pup stunk of distress and urine. Vomit stained her shirt. Her was skin pale and clammy. A great change had taken place in the pup. That unique spark in her eye had gone out completely.
There was no hesitation. His hands shook with anticipation. Tony slowly slid them down, and Steve kicked them off. The alpha licked his lips. Everything about Steve was perfectly proportional. He slowly kissed up that toned stomach, intentionally avoiding what his omega wanted most. He gently took Steve’s nipple into his mouth, sucking softly. Steve arched and moaned at the sensation.
Tony went to his lab. There was a temptation to look into the Mandarin data, but he couldn't. Not when Steve was so upset. Tony spent the rest of the day working on Mark 42. His attention wasn't all there. He likely wouldn't see his mate for the rest of the day. It was a bitter realization. He wanted comfort that came with being near his husband. Late at night, he heard motion upstairs. He rushed up the stairs. Steve sat at the kitchen island picking apart the cinnamon buns. Steve growled, flashing his teeth when he came near.
Piper went alert when she heard someone coming. She moved closer to the alpha, risking going within arm’s reach. A male beta dressed scrubs and a surgical mask appeared, carrying a tray of food. He wouldn't help her. The beta was part of whatever organization this was. A small slot at the base of the glass wall opened. The man slid the tray inside, then left.
"Stress and worry, compounded by a lack of sleep. Yelling may not be pleasant or healthy, but helps relieve that."
That snapped what little control he had. He shot from the table, pushing his way through the crowd to his suit. It opened to meet him, closing securely around him. He went to his knees.
"No, Steve. This has to be done right. I would love to let you do as you want with them, but that's not an option. You want revenge and rightfully so. Let me get it for you.”
Tony was working on omelets. The last time he cooked for anyone was Pepper. He considered renting out the MoMa but decided against it. It would bring to much press. He wanted to keep Steve hidden for his own reasons. As soon as the news of Captain America being alive, there would be countless suitors pursuing the omega. Steve came in, smiling brightly. Tony almost burnt the omelet. He was so caught in the smile.
"For how long, Steve? Sooner or later, someone will come after you and the kid. This is one of the only ways I can think of protecting you," said Tony.
Lena packed her things. Again the thrill of leaving was bittersweet. A plane was waiting for her on the ice. A very long flight and she’d be home.
"I'm indifferent toward it." Until recently killing was a completely emotionless task for him. Nothing that merited either positive or negative emotion. "This is irrelevant to you learning how to fight."
Tony helped Steve from his lap. Steve yawned nuzzled into his sheets, ready to sleep. He whined when Tony left their bed.
Thor rose from the crater, shaking off the dirt. He stood in a field of yellow flowers. It was unsettling to stand in such beauty after seeing such carnage.  He knew little of Coulson, but his actions revealed so much. The man died a hero’s death. His sacrifice couldn’t be wasted. He would be avenged. Loki would pay for the man’s death along with all the other crimes he committed. Mjolnir stood in the distance. Thor took a breath before taking it up. What was the condition of the others? First, he must find Banner. The man couldn’t have landed too far from here.
Steve scrambles backward momentarily bursting through the fog of lust. He didn't need all this. Only sink back into seconds later as the alpha's tongue continued to work him.
And he did. They went to the training room. A girl was there. She was tiny and fragile looking. He’d seen other gifted people, fought a lot of them even, but never someone so close in age to him. The silver blond guy, who could run super-fast, and the weird red-haired woman were adults. Her blue eyes were distant. Bruises marked her skin, yet her hair was neatly cared for. Someone cared for her and another had hurt her. She smelled sweet, but he couldn't recognize the elements of her scent. But it was different, like everyone else he'd met who was special. It kinda reminded him of that alpha with a metal arm.
Steve laughed. The man flies around in high tech suit of armor. And he was trying to find a way to reinvent a peeler.
"No, Howard shipped me off to boarding school as soon as I was old enough. I was popular but didn't have anyone I could call a friend. I didn't have a real one until I met Rhodes at M.I.T. He was the only one to stand by me even after all the shit I pulled." Tony was shocked at the reveal of information. Steve was easy to talk to. He didn’t have to pay Steve to listen; he listened of his own free will and seemed to care. Steve didn't have alternative motives. Steve pulled his legs to chest, making himself small.
Lena yawned pouring herself another cup of coffee. Winter had blanked out, staring at the wall. Piper was asleep. She had a few hours until they woke up. From her desk, she pulled up the information from Piper's transport. Odd, there was an abnormal flux in her temperature.
“Happy is family.” Steve growled but seemed to be backing down. "What would you do? What if it were your friend in a hospital bed? I know you, Steve. You'd put everything on the line for a friend. How can you expect me to do nothing?"
“I beg to differ especially after all that sugar.” Tony gave Piper her SpongeBob toothbrush, and she dutifully brushed her teeth.
“Vietnam, believe it or not, that handsome young in the photo is me. I was a medic. I served twice many thought I was crazy for going back, but they were in such need of doctors. I had to help. It’s a miracle I came back alive,” said Barny.
Tony couldn’t stop twitching. Things weren’t moving fast enough. He got up and paced the short aisle of the jet. This sense of helplessness was so new to him. Steve needed him and he couldn’t get there fast enough.
Men dressed in black body armor stormed in, weapons drawn. Effortlessly, he tossed them through the flimsy wall. He ran through the new entrance. It was a set.
“Steve, wake up!”  The omega remained trapped in a fearful state. He couldn't reach him. Steve's growing distress agitated his inner alpha, urging it to protect and defeat whatever threatened his omega. It was tearing through every mental wall of restraint he'd built over the years.
"Bucky always wanted me to go. All you needed to get in was a pretty omega. We never tried though," said Steve.
Tony watched the footage. When reached the part discussion on drawers he smirked at the possessiveness Steve displayed. It was perfect. He tensed when he reached the subject brought upon by Natasha of Steve taking him off the market permanently. Was he ready to give up the playboy life? It had lost its thrill. Before Steve, he always thought if he were to settle down it would be with Pepper, but that was before Steve. He'd always had difficulty picturing that life with her. Pepper was getting old for pups and couldn’t produce an heir for him. A terrible shitty thought even by his standards but it was true. Steve, on the other hand, would be forever fertile due to his cellular build. Tony shook his head it far to early for him to be even thinking about pups. Shit, when did he ever think about having pups? He needed an heir. That was half the reason Howard had him. If he turned out omega or female he may have had siblings. Before now a child seemed so vague, but now a deep part of him craved it. It was all hypothetical. He’d hadn’t even said those three words yet. They weren’t easy for him. If Steve said them it would make them easier. He truly did care for the omega more than he could ever admit.
“I want to get to know you, Piper. I don’t have the right to dive into the bad until you feel you can talk to me without worry.”
Men came toward them. They were dressed in black armor. One stopped in front of his perch at the lever, ready with a grenade. He vaulted across space, swatting it away. He disarmed the two, throwing one off the ledge. More were coming. He fired back, protecting his position. The ship started tilting. He clutched the railing. Another engine was down.
Piper's eyes slowly opened. The walls were painted green with white flowers. It smelled like a hospital. Was she somehow home? She turned her head to the side, but it didn't look like any room from the tower.
“I’ll tell you what Edith told me. If we don’t it will affect us negatively mentally. We shouldn’t make it more difficult than it already is. We are barely keeping it together as is.”
On the third try, she accepted the bottle. He went to the couch. Tony chuckled. Fourteen years ago he never imagined he would be doing this and be happy about it. Top Gear played as he fed her. She finished the bottle. He grabbed a clean dishtowel, throwing it over his shoulder, then burped her. He chuckled at his daughter's eyes widen at the vroom of cars on the TV. She yawned. He laid her on the couch and changed her. Piper soon fell asleep in his arms.
Fury walked through the medical wing, letting himself into the doctor's office. Turner frowned at him. The beta was packing up his briefcase.
Bruce sighed. They were facing possible alien invasion and relationship drama seemed to be the only thought on the alpha’s mind.
Those low sports cars were difficult for him to get in and out of. There was also the fact that he couldn’t fit inside one comfortably. They got into their newest car. Steve smiled when he saw the car seat in the back of the car. He smirked. Tony was only going about ten over the speed limit. That was new.
Tony gave him an identical looked that asked, are we really doing this. Steve could let this go. She had to acknowledge what she did wrong, or she’d likely repeat the behavior.
Piper looked around the room. Its uniformity bothered her. The room was so unlike the limited surroundings she’d seen.
She smiled. “That’s one possibility. Don’t hide from it. Enjoy this new opportunity however you wish. Don’t waste it."
“Because there may be things he won’t be willing to tell me, fearing I may reveal it to Piper. This will be a slow process. I don’t want you under any illusions.”
"I was born this way. My parents were both super-powered in their own way. You must have super-powered parent or parents. That’s the easiest method but there aren’t many super people out there. I don’t know how else you’d get those power. Your powers don’t align with gamma radiation.”
“They made us fight.” He turned his head. Rune didn’t think the girl was lying. What had the bad woman done to her memory?
His calculations were never wrong why hadn’t it exploded yet. Two hours later Steve came up the elevator to his lab. He wore a sweater, dark jeans, and winter boats. A black jacket was folded in his arms. His cheeks were pink from the cold.
Piper sighed, she'd made herself sad again. Shaking her head, she grabbed another book. But it was only a temporary pause from what she was feeling. There were only so many pages of distraction. The door opened. Winter instantly went on alert. In one motion fluid motion, he was in front of her bed. Lena came in. Her heels clicked against the tile floor.
were to be obeyed. He flipped the lid off the trunk. Within it was an arsenal. Winter put on the tools of his trade and gave into his programming.
"As attractive as that idea is it would set off an alarm. It will take me a few minutes, but I'll be able to get it open," said Tony.
They finally landed. Tony ran out of the jet and to the medical wing. Clint stood outside Steve's room toying with one of his arrowheads.
As soon as the alpha was gone Steve’s strength left him. His knees shook. He braced against the couch. Why couldn’t he take off the mask? It was such a simple request.
Steve nodded. They started with a simple conversation. It took an hour or so for him to feel comfortable. His guard lowered slightly. Barny’s voice was very soothing.
“Then shame on the both of you,” she said. Her playful expression took away some of the sting. “When will I get to meet the little darling?”
Tony cleaned himself with a wet towel. When he returned to, Steve was asleep. He nestled underneath the blankets with his mate. Steve's back pressed against his chest. Sleep came to him unusually swiftly.
Lena took a chessboard from the desk, setting it on the floor. Taking a seat on one side of it, she set up the pieces.
They pulled into the garage. Steve reached over the center console grabbing his shield from the back. He followed Tony the elevator. Steve turned his shield his hands, trying to ignore how much he wanted to nuzzle the alpha neck and scent him thoroughly make sure there wasn't another omega's scent present. The elevator stopped on the lab. The area was pristine. It was if the attack never happened.
The intimidating sound demanded he back down but he brushed it aside. Steve pinned his husband to the ground, smothering him with his scent until the alpha’s muscles uncoiled. Tony went still underneath him, but his gaze remained feral. Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair.
Bruce left them. Steve cradled Piper in one arm. He touched his forehead to Tony’s, taking the alpha’s hand in his. Slowly Tony unwound.
“I’m not lost!” Piper shook with rage. Her heart was beating uncomfortably fast. She was hurting her family! Tears stung her eyes. She was hurting her parents but there was nothing she could do to change it.
Steve could finally think clearly when he escaped the alpha’s scent. Yet, there was a primitive desire urging him to return. He didn’t understand why this was happening. Steve checked the calendar on his phone. It was early. He hadn't even thought it would be an issue. But his body decided to defy him by making him endure it. He hit Edith's contact. She picked up on the first ring.
He was harder on the pup than usual. She was nearing the point of exhaustion, swaying where she stood, when they finally finished.
Piper woke up with her head feeling stuffy. She yawned. The moment leading up to how she'd gotten to her room was a blank. She fisted the blankets. Her heart rate picked up. What had happened in that time?! Did she hurt anyone?
They made there way back to the house. He stole care battery and hooked it up to the suit. Two girls were playing ping pong in their bikinis.
After spending a few hours with Happy, Tony went down to the lobby. A mass of press was gathered by the entrance. As soon as Tony left the hospital, he was swarmed by reporters.
This time Jarvis paused the film every time the couple got absorbed in each other. They were almost through the movie when Jarvis warned them of Happy's arrival. Tony sighed, pulling away from. The marks he'd left on the omega's neck were already fading.
He sat in the chair for hours, answering every question. Implications of some would rightly anger any doctor, but he took it for what it was a thorough examination.
Tony stood protectively by Steve. He didn’t trust the woman. It didn’t matter what Steve thought about her. A woman of her abilities working for S.H.I.E.L.D. was unsettling.
"People, friends, and family. They help anchor you guide you back. If it weren't for Papa and Pepper, I'd probably be half-mad."
“Every month I have to run maintenance and clean the arc reactor. Normally, I do it myself, but I could use an extra set of hands,” said Tony.
Tony’s eyes shut his mouth opened in silently as he released inside his omega. Steve’s cum marked his chest. The omega went limp, letting his weight fall on him. He managed to move them on their side. Tony ran his fingers through those damp golden locks.
“I wish I could get through to her better. Tony and Piper have their intelligence and engineering. I can’t bond with her like that. She seems to trust him more now that Tony’s opened up to her about his kidnapping,” said Steve.
Another knock at the door and a beta in scrubs entered. “I’m Dr. Arjun Havaldar. I am the doctor assigned to your husband’s case.” He introduced himself.
Piper went to her knees. She was helpless. All she could do was watch as her only friend was beaten to death in front of her.
Steve inhaled, really looking at his mate. Tony was at the same point, he hadn't seen until now, or he hadn't wanted to until now.
Piper didn't follow Rune, staying with Daddy in the kitchen. He'd grown really attached to Pepper and Maria. She wasn't going to mess with that. Rune deserved a family, and she wanted to make sure those connections formed.
He leaned back into the leather seat of the car. Tony sighed deeply. He hadn’t gone to his parents’ funeral; instead, he got blackout drunk.
He brought Piper to his lab. Dum-E and U came rolling over to them. The two bots study her with fascination. She squirmed in his hold trying to reach the mechanical arms.
Their gloved hands entwined. They walked back to the car. The entire drive Tony held his hand. It was a physical connection he needed. It grounded him. As soon as they got home Steve kissed Tony. Tears were still running down his eyes. Tony pulled away when he felt tears against his cheeks.
Tony went to his side. Steve pressed against him, trying to hide. The omega tensed, snarling deeply when Edith and her nurses came into the room. Tony struggled to keep control over his inner alpha.
Steve fell forward onto his elbows when Tony slowly licked his slick from the source. He mewled as Tony’s tongue worked deeper. Steve fisted the blankets, pressing back against the wet appendage, trying to take it deeper. Screaming when Tony pumped him. He fell over the brink of orgasm, coming in Tony's hand.  Steve collapsed into the mattress letting the aftershocks of pleasure wash over him. Tony turned him onto his back. Steve shivered when Tony licked the cum from his hand. The alpha’s mouth was wet with slick. Steve moaned the scent of Tony’s arousal was heavy in the air. Slick continued to leak from him. Their lips met again. Steve spread his legs for him, allowing him to rest between them. They moaned into their kiss as Tony slowly pushed into him. Steve felt every inch of him.
The hours passed into morning. As soon as the other team came Steve was rushed into a medical tent. He pricked, poked, and thoroughly examined. Steve was barely containing his growls. He wanted to go home!
"For you, it will likely result in another heart attack. I don't know the state of your heart, Mr. Stark. I can piece together that there's likely scar tissue. A heart attack is dangerous for most, but for you hold extra risk. For Steve, it holds more of a mental health risk. The two of you need to strengthen that bond. The two of you may not want to but you need to," said Edith.
They plan landed at the nearest S.H.I.E.L.D. agency. Tony picked up his mate. Hill along with a group of agents were waiting for them on the airstrip with a stretcher.
“Would you prefer voluntary seclusion? Is your upcoming heat part of your reasoning for this behavior?” asked Barny.
They tackled each other. Their arms locked. Steve’s was stunned at the man’s strength it. It was equal to his. How long would his strength last? Their closeness allowed him to take in his attacker scent.
Steve took another box from a nearby stack and started looking through. He took off his sweater when straightening his shirt, Tony caught a glimpse of light blue lace.
Steve smiled. Pepper made wedding planning so easy. She turned it into a series of yes and no questions.
George wasn’t sure how long they were in the car. The silence was uncomfortable. He could feel the woman beside him, assessing his threat level. They pulled into a storage facility.
Tony smiled as Steve closed his eyes, enjoying the feel of the sun against his skin. Sunlight picked up on the blond highlights in Steve’s hair.
Piper shook the bars separating them, screaming. The metallic scent of blood hit the air. She heard his bones breaking. His breath came in short gasps.
Steve fell asleep an hour into the drive. Tony changed the music, keeping the volume low. When they were ten minutes away he woke Steve.
"I was an omega with the body of alpha. I was ridiculed by many alphas, made to feel as if I were somehow unnatural, which in truth I was. Science turned me into what I was. But there is still a way to feel human."
“I’m sorry for what happened to that poor girl. But as I’ve said before, I had nothing to do with it,” she said.
“If we find anything at the crime scene, you’ll be the first to know. Our people are processing it now,” said Hill.
Tony followed Fury to a white door. He let himself in. The first thing that hit him was the scent of an omega in preheat. Its purity was ruined by a tint of worry. Then he caught a look at the full image. Tall, blonde hair, and blue eyes.
gave his mate a heart attack. It was all he could think about. There was a knock on the door. He’d hoped it would be the doctor, but it was just Pepper and Happy.
Piper nodded, picking out a green apple flavor. “Thank you.” She got dressed and happily popped the lollipop in her mouth.
Tony woke up to Piper wailing. At some point, while they were sleeping she'd gotten out of his arms and crawled to Steve's side of the bed.
That was simple. Now, what? He took out his sketchbook began drawling. When he finished a little more than an hour past. He showered and went into the closet. Steve pulled open a drawer. He turned red he saw several sets of lingerie tucked in the corner. Tony must have done this when he was sleeping.
“Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours, I’ll know every dirty secret S.H.I.E.L.D. has tried to hide. Blueberry?” said Tony.
Tony's suits irrupted one after the other. Steve knew what this meant. How difficult this was for him to give up. He hugged his mate.
He didn’t know what to do. Steve was whimpering and crying on the floor, clutching his head. He didn’t know what to touch or not touch!
The dance ended. Steve watched the motions of his wedding. It was a calm relaxed atmosphere it was exactly what he wanted. After the high tension and action of the recent months, this was perfect. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. From his seat he watched the guests dance.
Steve nodded breakfast could wait until Tony woke up. He took a glazed donut from the box. Steve took a seat next to Rhodes.
Steve turned red. Tony ordered a sex book. Why wasn't he surprised? But oddly excited. Part of him was curious.
It had been a month since Piper was born, and the couple had fallen into as much of a routine as a person could when dealing with a newborn. Steve yawned, stretching out in bed, smiling when he found Piper cuddled to his chest. Oddly enough, they were sleeping better since she was born. Steve ran his hand down her back. She was perfectly healthy and putting on weight steadily. There was a time when he believed he would never be capable of producing such a healthy beautiful pup. He frequently counted her fingers and toes, reassuring himself she was real. Her intelligence became more apparent. She was already making cute babbling noises. They constantly had to find new toys for her that would challenge her. Once she thoroughly figured out a toy, she lost all interest in it and it would be donated. The only exceptions were the platypus lovey and wheeled giraffe Bruce gave her.
Tony raised his chin, kissing him. Steve melted into it, pulling Tony back when they separated. He needed this, just a slight distraction. Finding peace in the gentle interaction. They continued like that for some time, staying in the same rhythm. Eventually, they pulled away though their foreheads still touched.
“Don’t say stuff like that, Rune. You’re smart too. Especially compared to other five-year-olds I’ve met. Back me up?”
Even within his armor, Tony felt the frigid temperature. He landed in front of the base, undetected by the sensors. He easily cracked the door. Tony expected some response. A few steps in, and he saw the carnage. Bullet holes marked the walls.
“No, sweetheart, many couples met through the omega alpha heat program. S.H.I.E.L.D probably wants us to say that to prevent conspiracy theories,” said Tony.
Steve yawned. He preferred sleeping in the plane at the mission site. It natural to him. He was used to those conditions. A cushy bed was now a discomfort. Before the serum, he wished for a cushy mattress to replace the lumpy metal spring bed he’d slept on for years. How long would it take for him to adjust? He ran his fingers along the cool surface of his necklace.
Piper sighed. Winter made his want for a change of subject very apparent. And he would not be open to the question again any time soon.
“Ow, that hurts. I get it. I get it. I don't know about any Steve or Pepper. But I do know about the plan," he said.
He waited until Tony was done before pulling away. Steve set Tony back in the tub. He tossed his shirt in the corner. The alpha eyes had closed again.
"I can." Despite what he had to offer and what he did for the war effort, some alphas looked for an excuse to knock him down, put him in his place. Chester and Howard could only do so much for him. He had to make his own way.
The kid left. He didn't want to work. Just a moment of rest so he could function. He sat down on the couch with his suit and closed his eyes.
On his last trip to S.H.I.E.L.D., he planted a virus in their system. They'd yet to discover it. He'd planted it in a minor branch of the or so he didn't get anything juicy. Only basic level-six information.
.” Tony paused, waiting for him to say something. "For fuck's sake, I can even estimate with remarkable accuracy what kind of mood you're in by the paintbrush you use."
Steve rolled his eyes. A translucent screen appeared before them. He watched the alpha worked on equations he couldn’t even begin to understand. Steve dozed off.
“Not sure. What does it feel like? I know what it looks like.” He thought he was gaining further understanding of the emotion. Winter only wanted her to confirm it.
How could he explain this to her in a way she'd understand? “The mind isn't something that can be mended. You can't erase the experiences that cause it without erasing part of the mind itself.”
“Mmm, Tony?” His arm stretched out, searching for his alpha, only to find that side of the bed empty.
Steve gazed at the cards before leaving too. He should have tried harder to bring the group together, instead of getting swept up in it all. They had to come together more than ever. He went to the infirmary to check on Clint and Natasha. He went inside. Nat sat loyally by her friend's side.
"He's the son of Poseidon and a human mother. I don't think Thor is Rune's dad, but think they somehow got a hold of his DNA."
Winter shook his head. He needed to keep his mind on the task and escape unnoticed. For him to move freely, he’d have to wait until dark, so he checked into a seedy motel. Winter verified the exits and escape routes. Then he locked his room door and settled in to wait, turning on the old TV to break the silence. It was tuned to some news channel.
“No!” growled Steve. “You will let me take care of you.” It had been so long since he last took care of someone. He needed to be helpful.
“Alpha." He rolled off his alpha, shimming off his underwear. He went to his hands and knees, presenting. Slick leaked down his thighs. He whined. “Alpha."
"Hi, Pepper. You want to speak with Tony, sure." He handed his phone over to Tony. "You don't answer she calls me instead. So answer your phone."
“Tony,” he sighed. He began purring, nuzzling into his pillow. A small smile graced his lips. She would let him enjoy himself. Natasha left for the café.
Steve whined. His relief was all too short. He managed his way up the stairs to the bedroom, going into the bathroom. Jarvis had the shower on for him. The cold water was a wonderful relief against his scorching skin. He turned off the water when he started to prune and toweled tried. Steve scratched at the slight stubbled that grown.
His keen muscle memory of battle activated for the first time months. The activity he craved for months was finally satisfied. It was over to soon. He continued through the maze of tightly knitted maze of tunnels, Natasha watching his back. An explosion went off shaking the ground.
He hoped it would remain in this state of calm. The other guy wasn’t a fan of guns or any kind of weaponized group. It didn't matter the side.
“Mmm, puppy dog eyes from Captain America. As much as I would love to bend you over the couch and make you scream in pleasure, I am a selfish man wouldn’t want to share such a view,” said Tony.
A small hand shot around his fingers, crushing the bones of his fingers. Rune instantly released his grip.
Yutyrannus - meaning "feathered tyrant" is a genus of tyrannosauroid dinosaurs. A species that lived during the early Cretaceous period in what is not northeastern China.
He wanted to tell someone who wasn’t a doctor, a friend. Steve looked around, making sure the range was clear.
Steve's mouth went dry a the unmistakable hardness against his hips. Triggering an empty clutching sensation deep within him.
“It’s fine,” said Steve. He unwrapped his hand to reveal only a few small blotches of blood no injury.
Steve returned to his room, going to the master bathroom. Taking athletic tape from a drawer and wrapping his broken fingers. The little alpha didn’t know his own strength. He would have to be taught how to control. So, would Piper.
“Funny, you actually think it will be a challenge. It’s child’s play. I could do it in my sleep,” said Tony.
Happy looked back to see if his boss was serious. Tony nodded. “Museum of Modern Art here we come,” said Happy.
The emergency exit door was yanked open. A masked figure jumped through. The door slammed shut behind the man. He easily knocked Happy out of the way. Steve snarled, baring his teeth. The two circled each other.
"But we can’t go into this blind we need to know what to expect. We’ll look into only enough to ensure both your and our pup’s health,” said Tony.
He ran out onto the road. Stopping in his tracks when of her friends appeared. The man raised his cup to him, with a glowing orange smile. Tony shot passed his head. He dove for cover behind a car. Tony jumped through the window of a nearby diner, sliding across the floor.
His voice was hazy with sleep. He ran his fingers through Tony’s hair. Tony’s grasp around him tightened. Their legs were tangled together, making it impossible to leave the bed without waking the other. The mix of their pleasure, sex, and scent was oddly comforting. Tony’s expression was serene, unburdened by thought. Not many had seen the inventor like this. Steve fell asleep to the image.
Tony’s eyes widened. He thrust deeply into his omega in a single motion. Steve moaned into their kiss. His hand tangling in Steve's hair, bringing him deeper into their kiss.  He pulled away grazing his sharpened teeth against Steve’s neck. His thrusts were slow.
He smiled when he saw a box of jellybeans. They'd always been his favorite candy. There was another knock on the door.
“Thanks,” said Steve. He tucked the list into his back pocket. Steve walked Natasha to the door hugging her goodbye, before returning to the kitchen.
Tony went tossed off his clothes and changed into something more comfortable. He smiled when he saw his pregnant, six-foot, super soldier husband spread eagle on the bed. It was a beautiful image. He took a seat beside his mate.
“Embarrassed, but otherwise fine,” said Steve. More annoyed than anything. He'd been so close to getting what he wanted.
“No, Piper you can’t yank me like that." Tears welled in her eyes. “No, no don’t cry. Look at the funny face."
The mixed scent of their arousal lay heavy in the air. He rolled his hips to meet the rhythm set by the alpha. Their skin glistened with sweat. Ever so often their lips met. This was his alpha. His legs wrapped around Tony's waist bring him closer. Moaning as Tony pulled his hair, tilting his head back to further deepen their kiss. The pace changed becoming animalistic, their need for each other outweighing everything else.
"Did it hurt? When I was given the serum, it felt like flesh was being ripped from my bones," said Papa.
Steve sighed deeply. Once he’d gotten over the shock of his situation, he’d cried himself to sleep for days. All that he knew was gone. Once he built new connections, it was a little easier, but the pain was still there.
“Sir, I must warn you Pepper is on her way. She’s left several angry voicemails. Do you want me to play them?” asked Jarvis.
Steve groaned slowly, peeling himself from Stark Tower’s gym floor. It has become a habit, him waking up there. Working himself into exhaustion was the only way he could sleep. There was too much going on in Hell’s Kitchen for him to risk a trip to Fogwell’s gym.
Tony took some of the bags from him. When the elevator doors opened, the first thing the older alpha was hit was a sweet chemical scent of an omega close to heat. He fought the urge to gag. Happy managed to place the bags in the kitchen.
“Also means the portal can open as wide and stay open long as Loki wants. Um, raise the screens. That man is playing Galaga thought we wouldn’t notice but we did,” said Tony.
Piper didn’t like life sciences, where anomalies could occur more frequently. Those mechanics didn't follow the same simple mathematical logic she preferred. What she hated most, though, was not being able to understand. Uncle Bruce’s notes did nothing to aid her. It didn’t help that they were in cursive. She huffed, throwing the report across the room, forgetting the sleeping man on the couch behind her.
Tony and Steve sat across from each other in the kitchen. Steve was glaring at the sandwich in front of him. He'd managed a few bites before losing interest. They'd been sitting quietly for an hour, neither one breaking the silence.
Those fierce blue eyes matched perfectly with one he’d come to know so well. The omega was the pup’s bearer. Piper’s parents came for and found her against all odds.
"Yes," said Steve without a moment's hesitation. It was clear Bruce and Tony didn't hold the same level of trust he had in her. "Please, I trust her. Tony, you how difficult it is for me to trust doctors."
"You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favorite of many sayings, the early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese," he said.
Tony entwined their fingers, pulling him away from the others. He wanted his mate to himself. Tony led them back to their temporary room. They settled in the clean bunk. As soon as they were out of the view of the others Tony relaxed confidence faded. He sensed the fear and anxiety building within his mate. The adrenaline of their mating and the battle was gone. Fear was there.
After Pepper had droned on about some required administrative work, which Tony studiously ignored; and reviewed the details for a new SI project about which he was excited, their meeting petered out. The two friends sat comfortably enjoying each other’s company. Tony looked down the hall toward Steve’s studio, concerned that he hadn’t come out yet. The door was shut, a clear sign Steve wanted to be left alone. He knew it was best to let Steve work it out, but Tony had to check.
A simple black car pulled up. This one wasn’t driven by itself. The driver was a broad slight chubby alpha. He came to greet them.
Tony nearly laughed. He couldn't get it up if he wanted to. There was something so disturbing about the idea of such intimacy. It wouldn’t be right. Steve looked like he was about to be sick.
“No, he might do something stupid that could get him killed. I’ll give you my number in case you need me,” said Rhodes. Steve handed him his phone.
Steve relaxed beside his alpha, but he wouldn’t sleep tonight. He smiled when Tony fell asleep on his chest. The alpha was a surprisingly cuddly sleeper. Tony slept like that the entire night.
He nodded. She’d only been scruffed once before, when she accidentally ran into a busy road. Daddy had yanked her back to the sidewalk before anything could happen. He scruffed her then told her never do that again. Daddy did it protect her. He’d looked so scared when that happened. Was that what he looked like now?
He hadn’t slept this well for weeks. It was only due to his heat, but he would enjoy it while he could. Steve went to the large stainless steel fridge. It was filled with fruits, vegetables, meat, and eggs. He didn’t want to cook, but he popped a few blueberries in his mouth. Steve took out an apple. He lingered by the fridge, enjoying the feel of the cool air against his skin.
The agony in Tony’s chest bristled against his ribcage at the sight of the deep hurt he'd caused Steve. He didn't have the strength to explain what he was feeling or even to stand, so he sunk to the floor.
I'm sorry this chapter took so long to post. It's a chaotic time and I wish all of you the best health.
She pressed closer. His back hit a wall. Their faces only inches apart. He needed something to compare.
Steve wasn't sure if he could handle human interaction. He could barely tolerate Tony and the man was his mate.
Arm was toying with it. The robot must have packed it for him. He brought it to his nose. It carried Tony’s scent. Steve purred, rubbing it against his face, pulling away when he realized what he was doing he tossed it away. No, he could not give in to that side himself. Steve stared at the crumpled piece of red fabric on the floor. He picked it up folded, placing it at the foot of the bed.
Rhodes chuckled that one blunder had broken the ice and his shock. The captain was what he expected outside of the suit kind and gentlemanly. It made sense now. God, knows the horrors the man had seen, yet he managed to stay the same. It was surprising he didn't have an episode sooner.
He needed to get his omega out here, get him Avengers Tower where it was safe. Where things were more under his control.
Piper closed her eyes. There was only one thing truly wanted - a best friend. She closed her eyes and blew out the candles.
“I don’t want another pup after going through this.” There was so much trauma that needed to be undone with Piper. And there's always the chance it could happen again if they had another child.
Lena turned the computer monitor toward her. A video appeared on the screen. Piper recognized herself in the still frame. Lena hit play. Piper watched in absolute horror of her own actions. When it ended she realized she’d wet her pants.
Tony watched helplessly as Steve struggled. There was nothing he could do. This was a natural process, which he could only watch. Steve's jaw was so tightly clenched Tony feared the omega's teeth may shatter.
The woman sat her up against the pillows in her crib. Piper bit her lips forcing back a cry at the unwanted motion. The beta pressed a spoon of oatmeal against her lips.
The loneliness settled as the realization his alpha was gone hit him. Steve groaned flopping back into the pillows. He wasn't used to being needy. It was crippling. He was an independent man tried to be even before the serum. His biology was a set limitation he fought successfully as much as possible most of his life, but those years of built-up control faltered in front of his chosen alpha, Tony Stark.
He didn’t look back. His emotional defenses were up. Tony closed off the soft vulnerable side of himself, and it was his fault.
“Steve, you have to stop blaming yourself. No one else does,” said Tony. He couldn’t stay with Steve. His fingers were twitching to work.
Steve's purrs were steady, soothing Tony's, stress-ridden heart. He was never much of a protective alpha type. Tony preferred independent omegas. Steve was fiercely independent. In that moment of need, it felt right to take the role.
"You told us there were no prisoners!" said Steve in a harsh whisper, not wanting to wake the sleeping pups.
“And where have you been? When have you been here for me, through this?” Tony’s voice was angry, yes, but hurt too.
Steve moaned when Tony’s knot tugged at his sensitive rim. He voiced his pleasure, wanting Alpha to know just how good he was feeling. And every omega knew who the alpha belonged to. His vision whited out as Alpha’s knot locked them together. Steve’s limbs lost their strength. He went to the floor. Letting the alpha's comforting weight fall onto him. Tony nuzzled his neck. He shivered when Tony's teeth grazed his skin.
Piper yawned, stretching out. Theodore was silently watching over her. Her stomach growled. Normally, when she woke up breakfast was already there. But soon, a man in came in with their meal. That scent! He was the one who hit her. She went to the slot.
Tony grunt as Steve reset his pinky and wrapped it with a brace. Steve grabbed a box of band-aids from the kit. He managed a small excuse of a smile when he looked down at the alpha's arms. They were now covered in SpongeBob, Minions, and Thomas the Tank engine band-aids. The sight even coerced a small smile from the alpha.
“Neither am I. He’s got the same blood on his as Loki does, but right now we need to put that behind us and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source if we can put together a list-
Tony was pulled away again. Steve didn't mind. He laughed when Natasha dragged Bruce onto the dancefloor. Banner was the only person who was visibly more uncomfortable dancing than he did. Thor took Tony's old seat next to him.
Steve left the bathroom to dress. There was a problem, like everything else the room his clothes stunk of sex. The scent clouded his mind. He put on a pair of gym shorts. Steve went kitchen, taking a deep breath of the clear air. It calmed his nerves. Jarvis already brewed a fresh pot of coffee. Steve poured a mug. He was tempted to cook breakfast, but the tech in Tony’s kitchen was beyond him. Tony came into the kitchen wearing dark red boxer briefs that hugged him perfectly. When he realized he was staring, he turned away.
He'd only fix Mark 5. Shame swept over him for giving into so soon after. He'd given into to urged to create so soon after destroying what proved to be a distraction. This was only for emergencies if he needed to get to Steve quickly. He worked the night away.
Piper and Rune heard them fighting outside. Maria and Pepper were doing the best to distract them. Piper crawled into one of the underground tubes beneath the playground, hoping it would help block them out.
“Phil waste two hours trying to explain a smartphone to me. You think you can do better,” said Steve.
“Rune?” She touched his hand. He twitched as if he expected her to hurt. Piper pulled her hand away.
“Steve, it’s normal for some of your level experience. No need to apologize,” he said. Seeing Steve reach climax more than made up for it.
He shook the feral haze on his mind. The embarrassment of the situation hit him. He was pinned to the kitchen floor knotted to his boyfriend.
Natasha sped to the tower. The alien she was using to stir growled underneath her control. She dodged blast going past her head. Loki.
Clint’s arrows bounced off the harmlessly off the bears’ pelts. Natasha’s electronic blasts only agitated them. Their efforts weren’t useless. The beasts’ movements slowed considerably. The smaller bears cried and ran from Natasha and Clint toward the larger one. They nuzzled against it, whining and crying as if hoping to wake it.
Piper instantly seemed more interested in a nearby toy. Steve smiled. Tony was in China, having gone stir crazy after his surgery. Bedrest was torture for Tony. At times Steve was almost tempted to tie him to the bed. That thought planted far too many blush-inducing ideas in the omega’s head. He touched the second band he wore on his ring finger. Made of the melted down metal pieces removed from Tony's heart, it was one of Steve’s most prized possessions.
"Until then, me, Jarvis, and Papa will keep an eye out for him. Every camera in the world will be looking for him. We only have to be patient and I know that is not easy."
his pup was missing and his omega said it was his fault. So, now wasn’t the time for that submissive side.
He'd have to order a plastic sheet for her bed and pull-ups. Steve was sure that wouldn't go over well with his daughter. As soon as she’d been potty-trained she refused to wear them, saying they were for babies. He quietly opened the door. Her eyes instantly opened. He sat on the side of the bed. She looked so small in the giant cushioned bed.
If he stood any chance of getting close to her, he had to calm her down. He sang to her to her again, and slowly eyes returned to their normal shade of blue. She collapsed, panting.
Steve was at his desk, reading over the mission report. It posed too high a threat level for agents of average ability. Two S.H.I.E.L.D. teams visited abandoned Hydra base in the Carpathian Mountains and hadn’t returned. Fury wanted to know why. This may turn into a rescue mission, but Hydra didn't leave survivors. He put down the folder. Steve grabbed his bag and started unpacking. His fingers landed on a soft piece of unfamiliar fabric. He pulled out a red pillowcase.
“It’s my collection. She doesn’t get an opinion of what I hang in my home. I’ll have Happy put in storage,” said Tony.
“I’ll retrieve her shortly. You’ll be watching the interaction on the monitor until I deem it safe for you to enter the room next door.”
"We might as well take care of it now. By the time local authorities get around to it, they will have likely moved on. And when I get home the last thing I want to deal with is Agent Hill or Director Fury nagging me for leaving an assignment early," he said.
Steve glared at her. He may be in a proper state of mind, but instinct wouldn't allow him to trust her. She moved to the foot of the bed. He backed away.
The alpha wasn't lying. At least he didn't think so. He seemed genuine about wanting to get to know him. There was no reason for Tony to pretend to get to know him. It was inevitable that they would have sex.
"It will speed up when Tony returns. This is your body’s way of protecting her, keeping her in where she’s safe until your mate returns," said Edith.
Tony flinched. The first thing that came to mind was the frog eye headlights. It was never a car he considered adding to his collection. But he had said
“Our weddings last a week on average. A celebration of new bonds, love, family, and drinking. My parents' wedding lasted two the whole kingdom was invited,” said Thor.
Steve calmed himself down as he twisted through the halls of S.H.I.E.L.D. with Edith. Too nervous to make eye contact with passersby, afraid they may somehow discover his secret if they looked him in the eye. Only relaxing when he reached the safety of Edith's office.
Tony froze when he opened a box filled with photo albums. He flipped one open. The photo that caught him was one of him as a toddler, standing on Howard's feet. Howard's obvious pride was cleared. Tony never remembered the man looking at him that way. It must have stopped as soon as he learned how to talk.
“I feel it more deeply than you could imagine. The bond between pup and bearer is unbreakable. A blessing when together, but a curse when forced apart.”
He needed alpha! Desperate whining calls for alpha left his throat. The fear only sent him further into a feral state. Two words left him.
Tony followed him. They stopped at his container. It was undamaged from the attack. Mechanical arms removed the beaten armor from his form. He stepped out. Steve went to wipe the blood from Tony's forehead, but alpha caught his wrist.
"Fury knew and he made you do this!"  He would personally rip the director a new for putting his omega and their unborn pup at risk.
Tony was surprised that Steve hadn’t gotten things ready for the kid yet. He hadn’t prepared at all for the pup.
Tony got up he could still in squeeze a few hours of sleep. He offered Steve his hand. Tony relaxed Steve took his hand, leading him to the bedroom. Only when he was sure Steve was settled in bed did he leave for the bathroom. He needed to shower. His clothes and skin stunk of Steve’s distress. He would never be able to use a bleach cleaner again.
They took a breath collecting themselves. Neither was truly upset with the other. It was anger at the situation. Even now that they had their daughter, it felt as if they were limited in their action.
Steve soaked under the hot water, hoping to wake up. His fingers ran over his stomach. He couldn't keep this a secret any longer. Steve reapplied his scent blockers. Steve went into the bedroom only wearing a towel. Blushing when Tony's gaze slowly ran over him.
“Thought you could use something wear. My mom won’t notice they’re gone. She packed my dad’s clothes years ago,” said Harley.
“Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D. I uh well made a name for myself. I have a very specific skill set. I didn’t care what I used it for or on. I got on S.H.I.E.L.D’s radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me. He made a different call,” she said. Desperation had leached into her steady voice.
"No, he's safe there, and I didn't want him to be lonely." Her voice was shaky, but she managed to recollect. "Have your drones been able to find him yet?"
Natasha sighed, before getting in her car heading to Play Mart as well. She pulled into the back park lot, spotting the employee entrance. Natasha turned the dial on her watch. The signal would loop the footage. She easily picked the locked and snagged a spare uniform. Natasha went into a stall. It was a simple black uniform and an orange vest.
“He thought what we think. The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That’s something the world sorely needs,” Fury explained, seeing Steve shake his head.
Steve took the alpha’s hand. They got into the tub. He relaxed into the alpha’s chest, letting the alpha was him.  Tony got out.
He left a card on the desk before taking his leave. Tony waited till the man was out of his building before reaching for the card.
Piper went back to the car, examining its engine. Barny had done an excellent job maintaining it. Rune hopped onto the fender next to her.
Piper debated the idea a moment before raising her hands to be picked up. Papa quickly lifted her. She wrapped her arms around his neck. His calming scent filled her nose. Her muscles relaxed.
Tony was first to move, flopping lazily onto his back. Steve was still in a state of bliss with cum and slick leaking from him. The erotic scene would forever be scorched in Tony's memory. He slathered a wash clothe in a soap that smelled lightly of lavender. Steve pulled away slightly when he tried washing him.
Winter woke up with his mind clear, feeling like he had just crawled out of a dark and never-ending tunnel.
“Steve." No visible response. He should have known this would happen. Alpha tone may work. Research on PTSD in omegas proved that the alpha tone trusted of a trusted person could help an omega out of such a state.
Steve looked over the alpha. Olive skin, dark brown eyes, and thick dark hair with a few threads of silver. He stood at 5’11. The height difference took nothing away from the man's powerful aura. It was unlike anything he ever felt before. The man was perfectly dressed in a suit that meant to draw attention. Steve looked away, realizing he was staring. His heart was racing.
She tried following his request, but hunger outweighed her patience. Steve sighed accepting it. Maybe transitioning to the bottle wouldn't be a bad idea. When she was done, Steve put her in a yellow dress. The sunflower headband she wore stood out in her dark hair. He set her down on a blanket so she could play. Tony never was a big breakfast person, especially when he was jet-lagged, so Steve just ate two bagels.
Steve grabbed his bag from the locker. He returned to his room. Before he'd left, he cracked the window to dispel the intense smell of the oil paints. It would take several days maybe a week for the paint to dry. He packed the two watercolor canvases into the box and addressed it. Steve put the package in his apartment hall mailbox.
Steve opened one of the boxes. Inside were Hydra weapons. He ran his fingers along the symbol making sure it was real. How could they do this? Why wasn't he surprised?
“Fine." His reassurance did little lessen the concern in her expression. “I’m fine, Nat. The serum makes me immune to every toxin."
Steve left the privacy of guest room. He toyed with the phone. If he wasn't careful he would reveal too much. She was his friend, hopefully, she wouldn’t pry too deeply. Steve took a breath before calling.
She reached toward the studio doors. Ah. That's where she thought he was. Steve would lock himself in his studio for hours when he was having a bad. Tony thought Piper would put that together. He sighed, pushing open the doors to the studio. Piper looked around. The confusion was so clear in her expression. She started whimpering.
"I don't want that." Deep down, Steve was sure whatever Barny was doing was helping somehow. "I enjoy speaking with you."
“It's not just that. I’m worried for her. There’s a high chance of her being an omega. Female omegas are the lowest on the societal food chain. How will the world respond to her having such strength and intelligence? And she has the burden of having me as a father,” said Tony.
Sir waited for dinner to arrive. A tray was pushed through the slot of his door. He opened his sandwich. There hidden under a layer of cheese was a white capsule pill. So it really came to this. Fury’s lie detector was that much of a threat. He took it without hesitation, swallowing it with a gulp of water. Convulsing as it took effect.
Piper searched for any other useful information. Her gaze froze on her name. She was in the paper! She started reading:
Tony hadn’t told Steve the full extent of the damage of to his heart. The alpha never told him anything about his doctor appointments.
He couldn't keep it at bay much longer! The pressure built as his inner alpha fought for dominance. He needed Steve awake. That was the only way he wouldn't lose out to his other side.
Steve timidly opened the door, smiling softly when he saw Piper tucked happily into her Daddy’s side.
“A child, Pepper. I barely managed to catch him after he fell out of the jet,” she said, her voice cracking.
The man's head was bowed. His gaze focused on his pup. There was such confliction to him. Prideful and joyful at the birth of his first child, but worried and fearful of the fate of his mate.
Killian walked past Maya without even a second glance. Tony was left with the dying beta. He thrashed against his restraints. She didn't deserve this. Her skin became a sickly pale as the blood puddle around her grew.
"Seemed fair. You're the first person I've told about Yinsen." It was a fair exchange of personal information. Steve’s secret seemed so much more powerful.
Steve took a seat. On the coffee table were thank you letters from children for saving the world. Tony’s cool metallic hands touched his shoulders.
“I was planning to make you an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D if you choose to accept. And if you pass the necessary psych tests,” said Fury.
“Tony, you’ve paid your dues this isn’t your problem you and Steve have a baby on the way,” said Rhodes.
"His appearance is likely due to the surrogate who incubated him. But, I assure you, he has the desired abilities," said Lena.
“I have ten armored droids. They are twice as valuable and infinitely better at handling the situation.” Tony wasn’t going to waste time waiting to get the S.T.R.I.K.E. force.
Steve led Tony to his apartment. He tensed when realized everything was out. His paintings were on display. Steve quickly fished his keys from his pocket and unlocked the door, hoping Tony hadn’t noticed the hesitation. Tony followed him inside.
Steve kissed her on the forehead, then watched as Piper found a quiet corner and opened a book, completely ignoring the other children. She’d be fine. Piper spotted him staring and waved to him. Steve left for S.H.I.E.L.D. At the elevator, a secret compartment slid open to reveal a retinal scanner. He leaned over.
Natasha pulled into the mansion. As soon as she opened the door, Piper caught her in a hug, knocking her over.
“No, there's nothing that he wouldn't be able to get at the store. I would do it myself if I were allowed, but the director wants me to stay out of the public view as much as possible,” he said.
When his heart rate returned to normal pace he got up. He let a few seconds pass to make sure he was steady. Steve went to the elevator. He leaned against the corner. There was a slight jolt as it lowered. The door slid back, opening up to the alpha's workshop. Tony wore a welding mask and was absorbed in his work.
“At seven weeks, I’ll be able to get fetal DNA from Steve’s blood. I’m sure Banner wants to take a look at it,” said Edith.
Steve was spending the winter holiday with Tony. He enjoyed all the quality time. Their fight was a distant memory. They were currently enjoying a late breakfast.
"Steve has the ability to produce full-fledged super soldiers naturally. Theoretically, the child’s DNA would allow it to adapt and absorb the super-soldier serum to become stronger if reintroduced to it," she said.
Steve turned red as he slicked at the idea. Sex was foreign to him. It was something he never experienced in its pure form. Tony smiled. It was such a playful, clever expression, but it also held a gentle kindness.
He set her down on the pillow. The pup swiftly latched. He purrs grew louder when his alpha nuzzled against his neck.
Three bottles of wine later, they were almost done but managed to pick one. A choice made of obligation more than anything. He wasn't sure what he was meant to be feeling as they looked through the photos. Steve managed to relax on his military stance slightly.
Piper accepted her share of the food, grudgingly eating the meatloaf. When finished, she settled into Winter’s corner, sticking her tongue out at him when he glanced over at her. She hugged her toy closely to her chest, ready for sleep.
His back was pressed against Steve’s chest. The omega nuzzled closely to his neck. Most alphas would hate being trapped in this position, but Tony honestly didn’t mind. He was far from the traditional alpha. His eyes began to close.
Chinstrap penguins - is a species of penguin which inhabits a variety of islands and shores in the Southern Pacific and the Antarctic Ocean. Its name derives from the narrow black band under its head, which makes it appear as if it were wearing a black helmet, making it easy to identify.
"You don't sound good, Steve. When are you coming home?" Tony asked pointedly, worried, but also trying to contain his alpha voice.
“A friend. Nothing to be concerned about." Steve smiled faintly, so fleetingly, before sighing. “I think I might be able to sleep for a bit.”
Rune’s heart dropped. Sir left without a further word. Rune was shaky. He whimpered realizing he was standing in a puddle of his own urine.
“I apologize for growling. That isn’t me, but I prefer you not to judge me by my appearance,” said Steve.
"No, I can't, Piper. I know when you're hurting, so does Papa even if you try to hide it. Hiding what you're feeling will only makes it worse. Me and Papa have a lot of experience with that. Holding it in never works, Piper. You can tell us what's going on in your head. We won't judge."
Rune looked over at Piper's drawing. His eyes widened. The page was covered in tall buildings and lights of every color. At the center of it was a large building with a blue A on it. A red and yellow blur was flying through the sky. But it didn't have the same amount of detail as everything else.
Steve anxiously waited for the news. Had Extremis done any damage to her? Edith turned the monitor toward them. Everything seemed normal to him, but what if he wasn't seeing something?
“I’ll take care of you." Tony didn’t want to know of Steve’s first hellish experience. He wanted nothing more than to pleasure Steve. “If, at any point, you feel uncomfortable, tell me."
“He wasn’t the natural parental type, but he learned. Maria tried making up for it, but a boy needs his father. He tried so hard to get Howard’s attention creating such amazing things when that failed he started acting out, which gained Howard’s attention for a moment. Eventually, he just ignored it,” she said.
All the hostiles were bound. They already searched the caverns for any further threat but found nothing. Steve took his notepad and began doodling. He went to the cave mouth, sick of staying still. A sudden sting shot up his leg. He collapsed.
“Can I join you?” asked Tony, hugging Steve from behind. Loving how his scent clung to Steve. He ran his hands over the omega's stomach. “How you clean every inch of yourself in five minutes?"
They undressed as they moved. Tony's hand wandered Steve’s form. His skin was so perfectly soft to the touch. They pushed through the bedroom door. His grip tightened around his mate's waist, causing a small gasp to leave Steve's lips. All the omega was left in were pair black boxer briefs.
She also did not share the same enthusiasm over the results of Rune and Piper's fight. While fighting, Piper hadn't shown the indifferent nature Lena had wanted. Too much of the girl's personality came through. That would have to be dealt with before it became a larger problem.
“Interesting.” It came as a surprise that Winter remembered such games. Why would something so useless remain in his memory through the frequent wipes? Lena shrugged internally. A memory of such little consequence didn’t matter.
"It isn't only your heat. Though its a fantastic bonus." Tony nuzzled against Steve’s neck. He didn’t know what the hell this was, but he wasn’t going to let it go any time soon, no matter what pain it may cause him in the future.
Never had Steve been happier to hear Phil's voice. He didn’t let his relief seep into his expression, though. Steve wanted Tony to propose, but afterwards. When the time was right. Tony picked up the phone.
"You would have known that if you hadn't allowed your emotions to take over. Someone with your senses should have realized that."
“You have successfully disconnected the transmission line. We’re officially off the grid, sir,” said Jarvis.
“When I was sixteen on Coney Island. Bucky spent all our travel fair trying to win a stuffed animal for a redhead named Deloris. We had to hitch a ride back in a freezer truck,” said Steve.
“Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have arrived and the southern doors are being cleared as we speak,” said Jarvis.
Tony sighed, realizing the issue. He took a bite of everything on the plate. The pups watched him waiting for an ill effect. "It's safe."
“And once you’ve won. Once you’re king of the mountain what happens to his mind?” she asked, striding closer.
“Watson let him be,” she said. The dog yielded and trotted back into the house. “You’re just in time for tea."
Tony put her in his arms. She weighed almost nothing. He unwrapped her from the fabric. Her blue eyes locked on his. She smiled. It was the purest expression he'd ever witnessed. Steve nuzzled her, taking in her scent. She smelled of lavender and honey. He counted ten perfect fingers and toes. A deep incomparable love engulfed him.
Tony took Steve to the guest bedroom, sitting him down at the foot of the bed. Steve's face and chest were spattered with blood. The omega whimpered when he tried leaving.
Piper looked at the small green trees. She'd eat them every day without complaint if it meant she could be back with her parents. Tears started streaming down her face. She tried wiping them away but it only got worse, becoming a full wail.
Tony let the moment wash over him, enjoying the physical contact he'd so missed. Neither of them wished it to end. He ran his fingers through the omega’s hair. The smell of distress faded as Steve’s breathing calmed.
A smile cracked Steve’s tense expression. The stress and anxiety melted away. He offered Steve a box.
The alpha was now sitting up. Steve took a breath and put the arc reactor in its place. It locked in place. He got lost in those warm brown eyes.
“She’s fine, Steve. Crowding her isn’t the way of getting her to trust us like she did before. It will only make her feel constrained,” he countered, shutting the blinds, making the room just dark enough to sleep.
He kept moving, stopping before he reached the courtyard. Two men stood by the fountain. He took the Christmas ornament from his belt and tossed it toward them. It exploded one of the guard's hand, knocking him back. The other came charging in his direction, drawing his gun. Tony took him out with a nail gun. He pushed the man into the fountain, dropping an ornament into the water to finish him off.
He performed the average checkup. Everything was fine. Bruce put Piper back in her clothes, Piper nodding off in his arms. Tony was asleep in the chair.
Love was unknown to him. He assumed it was something close to what he felt when he was with Piper. No grown-up ever protected him like this woman had. Could she be his parent?
He nodded. Steve’s scent revealed how deeply he wanted him. Tony's hands snuck underneath the omega's shirt, pulling it off.
Hours later she woke in a more stable state. The room was no longer spinning. When she tried breaking out of Theodore’s hold he only pulled her closer.
The pups slept the entire drive. Howard’s mansion came into view. It’s not Howard’s anymore, Tony mentally corrected himself. Now, it was their temporary home, until things settled down. The front gates opened to greet them. Tony went to the backdoor, unstrapping Piper from the car seat. He carefully picked her up and she clung to him, cuddling to his chest.
He shook his head. She shouldn’t be calm. But he was sure if he moved her behind him again, she would only move in front of him again. There was a threat in their midst. Piper took his hand. He held it firmly. A wordless compromise. If there was a threat he could easily pull her close again.
There was movement from the other side. The door opened slightly before he was yanked inside. Steve quickly moved to the other side of the room. Tony took in the image before him. Steve was only wearing a pair of boxer-brief. His skin glistened with sweat. The omega breaths came in heavy pants.
