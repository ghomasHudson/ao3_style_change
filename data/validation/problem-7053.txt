“I don't have a favorite, and none of the cows have names because they are animals and not people, and we shouldn't give them human feelings or be sad when they die.” Steve recited automatically, the familiar words drilled into him by his Ma from a young age.
No sooner had Jarvis finished his sentence than the man himself strode out of the elevator, fully armored up, balancing two desks carefully in his arms. Behind him, DUM-E beeped and nudged a chair out to join the others filling the Avenger’s living room. Tony dumped the two desks next the others, and straightened up, casually brushing off his hands.
Steve grabbed some twine and started to rope the bale back together. He tried to act casual. “You would say Tony likes me right? And we did pawn his ring, so he’s pretty invested in our ranch, right?”
Tony kept his head down for the next week, steering clear from the Colosseum where the tributes were and staying inside his apartment. He had plenty to work on anyway, and maybe if he finished the perimeter defense designs then Obie would be less pissed. He’d work on Game Master tasks but Obie still haven't given him any information on how the games functioned from a practical standpoint or what he needed to do.
Closed, opened. He heard two sets of footsteps in the hall, one stomping forward, the other dancing hesitantly. Tony burst into the room with a wave of energy, Jan fluttering anxiously behind him.
He ran to the truck and jumped in with Tony right behind him, still laughing joyfully. He turned the key. The engine rumbled and died. Steve whispered “I knew it. I knew something was going to go wrong.” Tony rolled his eyes and reached across him and turned the key again. The truck rumbled to a start. Steve looked at him sheepishly, and Tony smirked. He put the truck into drive, and they were soon off to town.
“He was like my brother. He went missing days ago, and I knew the odds of his safe recovery were low long before I left. All the same, I could not abandon him. Loki used this against me, and set a trap. Now here I am, and Bucky is no more.”
Oblivious to his thoughts, Tony wiped his hands on a rag. “Um. Am I interrupting something? I heard my name.”
Tony was too vindicated to be mad. “I fucking called it! I knew it! Day one, I said it was going to involve me getting wet. And I was right. I was right!”
I actually came out of Civil War very heavily team Iron Man so it was interesting to try to understand Steve's side.
“Well shit…” was the only thing Tony had time to say before the bird stretched out an enormous wing and knocked him through a wall.
They crawled out of their burrow and Steve consulted the compass and set off, Tony following a step behind, still favoring his ankle slightly.
Clint gave her a boost to get out, and followed behind her with his bow. Bruce fussed over Thor, rubbing more cream where his skin was still red and tender. Steve turned to Tony. “Your ankle doing ok?”
“Right.” Tony said skeptically. “Well, have fun doing….whatever it is you’re doing. I should be done with the heater by dinner, so I’ll see you then. Good luck with whatever this is.”
“He told me he was going to give Britain a lift and be back soon” Steve said through gritted teeth. “We need to hunt down Britain. Either he took Tony, or he’s the last person to have seen him.” He knew that that guy was no good! And now Tony was
“Who needs to be put down. He is the perfect example of why the districts need the control of the Capital, because they are made up of people like this. People so bad, they corrupt any good thing they come into contact with. In this case, our beloved Game Master. Though Tony was wise beyond his years when it came to the construction of machines, he was still naive in the ways of the heart. Rogers seduced him.”
He entered the parking lot and scanned the rows of cars, looking for his. It wasn't there. After he had been entered into the Games they must have towed it. How the hell was he going to get to the Capital building?
Tony nodded. Later wouldn’t matter, since he was leaving as soon as the battle was over. They made their way to the guard tower, and down the stairs inside until they reached the bottom level. Tony lead them around the back of the stables, to where the planes were kept. They walked confidently, like they had every right to be there, and no one questioned them as they entered the large double doors and shut them firmly behind them. Steve stuck a broom handle through the door, so that no one could get curious and wander in on them. Meanwhile Tony was bent over the first plane, tugging at the battery. If he unplugged it completely it would set off an alert for the pilot, who could simply plug it back in. Or if stolen, it could be easily replaced. He needed to make it so that the gauges all read that there was power, but the planes would crash as soon as they made it out of the hanger, exploding straight into Loki’s troops and wall defenses. He finished his work on the first plane, and moved on the second as Steve paced nervously behind him, and Tony could feel his anxiety.
He ended the call and flopped sideways on the sofa. The contestant from 12 had gotten under his skin more than he wanted to admit. He had seemed so sure of himself that he had had Tony questioning everything he had ever learned. This guy was just crazy, that was all there was to it. The games would go on, and Tony would be proud to run them.
“Yes Sir?” the man who must have been the original Jarvis asked. Steve hadn’t realised that he had been a real person, but he shook off his shock and kept focused on his goal and his dwindling time. “Do you know where Tony is?”
“I appreciate all the support. We wouldn’t have survived for as long as we did without the gifts from our sponsors.”
Another week passed, and Steve was outside fixing up the fence, for the ten thousandth time. Dottie stood nearby, watching her escape hatch be blocked up yet again with terrible disappointment. Still, it had to be done. He straightened the fence post and began rewrapping the wire. He heard a rustle behind him and assumed it was Dottie so when Tony tackled him he let out a squawk and fell into the fence post, knocking it back over.
“It’s freezing now and it’s not even winter! We’re never going to have the cash to hire a repairman and you know it. I don’t want to be freezing my ass off in December when we have a solution to the problem
As the week passed Tony got antsy and started venturing out more. A peacekeeper followed him wherever he went, occasionally switching out with another identical guard. They all looked the same with their blank white helmets. It made Tony nervous, even though he had nothing he was hiding. As Tony walked down the street all of the peacekeeper’s heads turned to watch him. It was eerie and even when he was alone in his room Tony found himself looking over his shoulder. For the first time in his life the sight of a peacekeeper stopped making him feel safe. Now that he started noticing them he couldn’t stop, they were everywhere. Had there always been a peacekeeper at the corner of his building? And another at the supermarket? And another at the park? No one else seemed to find it odd.
Tony pulled his arm from Steve's grip irritably. “We gotta wait for everyone else to get back from chasing the birds, and our team is taking their sweet time as usual. I swear, one of these days I'm going to build you all rocket boots and be done with it.”
“Just stay out of my business!” Steve yelled. He grabbed his spool of wire and tromped back to the field to work on the fence. He didn’t know why he bothered, she hadn’t listened the last hundred times. He just didn’t want the two of them to go charging in and mess everything up when he finally had things going right. Was that too much to ask?
“I pulled some parts out. It’s no big deal, I know where they go and I’ll put them back after Tony fixes the heater, and we can bring him home tomorrow, no skin off anybody’s back.”
“He wanted our land. Now that you’ve married Tony, the packs are tied together and if the last of our pack dies the land reverts to Stane. And he’s shown no problem with killing off our pack.” Bucky snarled.
Steve blinked a few times and leaned back in his chair, clearly disappointed. “Yeah. Alright. It’s getting late.”
They all met up for dinner at five, and anticipation hung heavy in the air. Everyone rushed through their food and as a group they exited out through the porch, and walked into the thickening trees behind the house. Since the big hunts a year ago for the rabid wolf pack, they had to be absolutely certain that no one was around before they could even consider shifting. As pack leader, it was Steve’s job to make sure everyone was safe, and if that meant he had to be the annoying adult who sent everyone home early, he was willing to do it, and had done it before, much to Clint and Jan’s complaint.
He carefully pressed his palm to his chest next to where he remembered the cut was, and frowned. The skin was hot, far too hot. Infection was setting in. Tony dampened a cloth and laid it on the Captain’s forehead. He had no medicine to treat him, there was nothing he could do beyond cleaning and wrapping the wound. He would have to hope that the Captain would fight it off on his own, and either recover, or wake up long enough to give them the directions. Tony looked at his pale face and desperately hoped that he lived. The Captain had lived such a heroic life, it felt wrong for him to die of infection in a little mining camp in the middle of nowhere because they didn’t have any medicine and Tony wasn't good enough to save him. He took care of him the best he could, and laid down on his own bed, facing towards the Captain. He shut his eyes and was soon asleep, the day's work exhausting him down to his bones.
He shook his head. “Sorry Sir, a lot of people come through my store in a given day, I can’t remember them all. I don’t keep records, when so many of my customers pay cash. That’s the risk of using a place like this instead of getting a loan.”
Tony buried his face in his pillow. “You’re being disgustingly honest for this early in the morning.”
“Back when I was in the army, I’d watch the guy’s who worked in the mess crack eggs one handed. They’d go through four dozen in less than a minute. I think I could do it.”
Steve winced, mad at himself for forgetting to make up an extra plate. Bucky's return still felt too dream like to factor into everyday decisions like how many plates of eggs to make.
“See, you say that, then when I got back you ran up here. Like actually ran. I don’t understand what’s going on.” He said with frustration.
“I didn’t lie! I told you when I lost the coin flip that I’m bad at math!” Clint whined, his eyes downcast in shame. Steve was unforgiving.
Steve gave him a sad look, not fooled for a minute. He rubbed his hand up and down Tony’s back. Tony stiffened, and for a second Steve worried that he had overstepped his boundaries and that he was going to push him away. They were in public, and when Tony had told him about Yinsen he had turned away from all of Steve's offers of comfort.
Steve looked down at sparrow boned wrists and struggled to breathe in the cold air as his lungs closed up with asthma. He fell to his hands and knees, gasping. The Captain grabbed him by the throat and forced his head up. “The world has no use for Steve Rogers. A threat is coming, and the team needs a captain. It’s time to get to work.”
“Bullshit, you were whining. And I'm telling you you'll never be a Bucky. I'll never be a Bucky either. Whatever he has, he's the only one in this entire godforsaken podunk town that's got it. Give up on being a Bucky, and just….”
The guards cuffed their hands roughly and dragged them into the castle where they were hustled through the hallways until they reached the throne room. The guards marched them inside and forced them to their knees in front of the golden throne, where Loki sat. Upon their entrance, he had risen to his feet with a frown on his face. When he realized who it was in front of him his frown turned into a wicked smile.
He jolted upright in bed, gasping. He stumbled across the room and tripped over something, falling into the wall with a bang. He smacked it until he found the light switch and flipped the lights on. He slid to the floor, still struggling to breathe. There was a red pile on the floor. Tony had forgotten his coat again, and he had tripped on it. He dragged the coat over and buried his face in it.
“And they all gave it five stars, but did they really like the recipe if they felt the need to change so many things?”
“I didn’t even know the last guy retired, he seemed so young.” Tony mused. “I tried to reach out to him to get some tips and I couldn’t find him anywhere.”
He looked at him in awe. “Amazing. I had no clue that any human being could be this dense. You’re wasted on this farm, you should be in a lab so scientists can study you.”
That was unexpected. That sounded too much like a retreat, from the man who always took challenges head on.
Tony found himself liking everyone more and more as they chatted and walked. They didn’t have the unending need to show off like the people of the Capital, and they didn’t make cruel jokes or give backhanded compliments. He started to believe that Steve’s plan of them standing together through the end might have a chance of working after all. Expectations of the games be damned, he couldn’t imagine any of them turning on each other or him.
The door burst open and peacekeepers flooded into the room, half bent over in the tight tunnel. The other door opened and Bruce and Thor were grabbed before they could take a single step. Tony boosted Steve up through the tree, and Steve immediately spun and reached his hand back down to pull Tony up. Before he could, one of the peacekeepers had Tony by the arm and threw him to the ground. Tony scrambled backwards on his hands and knees as they stepped forward from both sides.
“And when I first got over all my anger around this whole arranged marriage thing, my first thought was relief. I said to myself, “Oh thank God, someone contractually obliged to love me!” Because there’s some part of me, a little monster lurking in the back of my mind, saying that no one will ever really love me, that no one will stay unless they have to or they need me, and the second I’m not useful I’ll be tossed to the wind, and at night it comes out and devours my mind until I come running to you in the middle of the night to ask if you like me like a third grader with a crush and it’s so pathetic-“
Also I have no idea how much rings or watches would be worth at a pawnshop. I got the price of the computer right, but when I tried to look up rings, it was all over the place, and watches were just as bad. I tried my best. If I'm off, please assume the guy was either really generous, or swindling them.
In the cockpit, Sam was flipping switches to start the takeoff sequence. They were soon on their way, and back to the compound in less than forty minutes. Tony and Natasha each took an arm and helped inside to the couch in the living room, Steve walking mostly under his own power. He clutched a hand to his chest, the strain of moving pulling at the stitches uncomfortably. Tony fretted.
He meant it to come out aggressively; a challenge. Instead he sounded horribly small, less of a question and more of a plea. Stane let go of his face and leaned against his desk, arms crossed.
“Sure.” Bucky said skeptically. “ Look, I'm back now, and I'll go clean up your mess tomorrow. God, This is just like you, to go barreling head first into trouble without thinking twice about the consequences. There's no way he really likes you, you know that, right? You really think a rich guy from the Stark pack, hell, the Stark heir himself, wants to live on our dumpy ranch and milk cows and make moon eyes at you? Be real here.”
Tony was always challenging him. Challenging him over his attitude, over the way he ran his pack, and now over his way of dealing with the past. Staring at the floor covered in dirty clothes, out the window with the broken latch, to the ranch that was about to go under, Steve realized that that was maybe that was he needed.
Tony was curious to see what skill he would display. He was too small to do any impressive lifting, and he didn’t seem the type to be good with a bow. Steve took a handful of white chalk from the gymnastics bars and one of the water bottles near the front. He approached the glass separator and wet the chalk, using it to draw a sweeping line across the glass. The peacekeeper babysitting him rested a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “It’s time for you to go.”
Tony coughed and pounded his chest a few times. He was alright, he had a pretty high spice tolerance. Steve came back with a cup of milk and Tony took a few swallows. “That was fun! Did you see that they had one with ghost chilies? I want to try that one next. I’ve heard they’re so spicy people have died from eating them.”
Steve and Tony talk things out and somehow manage to miscommunicate more than if they hadn't talked at all.
Tony leaned into him playfully. “Alright Buttercup, you can stay, but Birdbrain over there is gonna have to find a new nest.”
Tony grabbed Steve by the arm and dragged him to the first restaurant of many. Tony got at least one thing to go from each of the restaurants, collecting pancakes and pizza and fried pickles and cookies. He spread out his haul on an empty table and started to dig in, letting out a moan of pure bliss when he bit into the most perfect slices of pizza he had ever tasted. And he had been to Italy!
Steve leaned forward and kissed him, and Tony put everything he had into it, trying to convey the love inside him that was so large and sharp it felt like it was tearing him apart from the inside out.
Tony’s voice grew distant. “I don’t know what’s wrong, I’m flying him to the hospital…..no...I’ll deal with it later...yes...watch out for Peter...yeah…”
Stane reared back in shock, and continued his trajectory until he toppled over backwards, hitting the ground and lying there, still, as a pool of blood started to form around his head.
“Level three? More like level five. I’d have to know a fella’s favorite color, number, animal and season before I’d dare ask about his sports teams.”
Tony nodded and opened his bag he had inherited from Yinsen, and dug around. He pulled out his needle and thread and started on the bottom of the slash, forcing the needle through thick flesh that was hidden under the scales. It wasn’t going to be enough. Under his hands the dragons’ chest ceased to rise and fall. Through the tears in the flesh he saw the heart stop. The heart… if it was the heart, there might be something he could do. He raced over the cart and tore all the wires apart, the lights going out and plunging the woods into darkness. He dug through to the bottom of the cart,  where the battery rested. He pulled it out and rushed back. Steve was slumped over the dragon, their heads resting together. Neither of them were moving. Tony kneeled in front of the dragon and tried to see. It was too dark, the moon barely breaking through the trees and the battery in his hands barely glowing. It was almost dead. Tony pulled his shirt up and held the edge in his teeth, the battery in his chest lighting up the night with strong blue light. He wound and wrapped the thin wire around the heart, just like his. As he had been haunted by weeks of nightmares over watching Yinsen dig around in his chest with no anesthesia, now he was thankful, because what had to happen was forever burned into his mind, the full step by step process to build a battery powered heart. Tony twisted the wires as fast as he could, finally connecting them to the battery that he pushed into the dragon’s chest. Tony felt a jolt of electricity run through him, and his chest burned. He felt every beat of his own heart, like it was fighting an uphill battle, dragging an impossible weight. His heart beat, once, then again. Under his hands the dragon’s heart started to beat in perfect harmony. The dragon drew in a breath and Tony would have swore he felt it in his own chest. He stitched the wound shut, and wound his remaining bandages tight across the dragon’s massive chest. With the immediate problem taken care of, Tony turned to Steve, who was gently stroking his dragon’s head, whispering gentle words of reassurance. He looked up at Tony.
Two days later, Steve was lying in bed, strategizing. Natasha called it moping, but what did she know.
Tony walked away before Liberty could respond, missing any words but clearly catching her annoyance. Steve called out to him, “Tony, do you need-”
“I have no idea, scans of them come back blank or as thick smoke. I hate magic. Have I told you how much I hate magic? Our best bet is to separate the guy from his crystal ball, that's what stopped them last time. But it's magic, so who knows, maybe this time it'll open a portal to the raven dimension and we'll have doomed the Earth,” he said bitterly.
This was all wrong, the peacekeepers were supposed to keep him safe from the dangerous district people, yet it was Steve who was helping to hold the ice gently to his face, and Steve who was rubbing a hand up his back whenever Tony’s breathing started to speed up into a panic.
“That’s nice, Tony. That’s…..nice. Just give me a minute. That’s a big task, and I need to work my way up to it.”
“Please, Buck, you must’ve saved my life a hundred times over, and who knows how many more winter’s I’ll last anyway, especially without your help. Let me do this. I have to do this.”
, where we were joking around, then it didn’t feel like joking? Maybe? And I can’t seem to get it out of my head. Maybe it was just me?”
“I know! But I mean, it’ not like he’s going to leave because of that, right? Like, he likes it here. Probably. Wasn’t just sticking around because he likes fixin' things.”
Jan was laughing too hard to answer. Every time she got a hold of herself, she would pause, then go right back into laughing. Steve thumped his head against the wall. Clint came inside, took off his boots and sat down next to him.
Tony stopped walking and turned to look at him. “But we’re not strangers, are we? I’ve been stuck in this stupid loop for decades, I know you better than I know my own mother. We’ve had thousands of conversations, fought together, died together. We’ve had sex, we’ve killed each other, and we’ve done everything in between. I know you, like no one else has ever known you.”
“Why do you and Natasha keep saying that? It went awful. Every interaction I’ve had with him so far has been ten steps backwards from where I want to go.”
“As far as I’m aware, the majority of the negotiations will be between me and the other relevant governmental bodies-”
Steve nodded and they walked out back and sat on the porch, just like they had every night for the past ten years, barring the last one. This was surreal, Steve thought as Bucky turned to him, hands clasped.
Steve was intimately familiar with how far Tony would go when pushed to the limit, and it had never involved causing him permanent harm. He wished he could say the same for himself in regards for Tony, a vision of Tony lying pale and bleeding on the ground flashing through his mind. He looked across the tables to where he was laughing with Rhodes. He looked ok. His cheeks weren’t hollowed out so clearly someone was making sure he got fed. He was breathing and walking easily and though his left arm seemed to have a tremble, he didn’t seem to be having any problems with its strength or dexterity. He looked....fine. He looked happy. Steve looked down at his own hands, curling them to hide where he had bitten his fingers bloody, remembering how his hands had shook as he had shaved off months of hair that morning. He was happy that Tony was fine without him. It was good. He wanted Tony to be happy. He pushed his chair back from the table.
The peacekeeper threw him into the supply closet where he had been caught with Steve and the door locked shut with a click. Outside he could hear the peacekeeper talking, most likely on the phone with Stane trying to figure out what to do with him. That made Tony wonder...he got on his knees and shifted around the boxes on the floor until his eyes landed on smooth black rectangle. When they had pulled him and Steve out of here, they had stomped on his phone and left it on the ground. In the commotion it had been kicked to the back of the closet, where it had sat collecting dust ever since. Tony hit the power button and the screen lit up. Like they could destroy Tony’s tec by stomping on it. He had designed this thing to withstand the force of a small explosion and gave it enough battery to last a month. He unlocked it and the application he had made to hack into the building’s systems popped back up. This was too easy. He disabled the electronic lock on the closet door and slipped out side white the peacekeeper was arguing with his phone. Tony went to the make up station where he had been earlier and smeared the thick cream over his eye to hide the red deepening into purple.
Tony landed with a clank and walked them in. The staff ushered them in and Tony laid Steve down on a gurney. A nurse approached with a hose and turned on the water, staying down his legs to try to wash away some of the mess. Steve jerked away. PAIN COLD WET he was flying and then he was going dowN DOwn dOWn cold WET-
“No” Steve blushed. “Not like that. Just…” As he tried to finish the thought Tony walked back and laid down on the bed.
“How could you even ask me that? Yes I missed you! I was a mess, you can ask Jan, Clint, anyone. The main reason I’m not still a mess is Tony, so if you don’t mind I’d really like to go see him.”
“You don’t have…? It’s a hundred bucks, max, with the part you got. And that couldn’t have been more than twenty bucks.”
Sam smiled ruefully. “Just this once, Cap. We were betting on how long it'd take Tony to kick Clint out of his seat this morning. I thought he'd be faster to be honest.”
“Should I get the beef stock?” Tony asked mockingly as Steve made his own version of buttermilk. He made it in a new mixing bowl, and Tony tossed him the bottle of lemon juice. He added that too, and picked up one of the eggs from the carton. Steve tossed it up and down a few times, catching it before it hit the counter.
Tony looked away, fiddling with the edge of his shirt. “Yeah, what else would I be thinking? I was more interested in the green guy. I didn’t know the districts were advanced enough to have computers. I thought the Capital had offered and they always turned us down, that’s what I learned in school. Did you make a break through with them? Is that why you’ve been so busy lately? If they’re willing to accept more technology and education I think we could really start improving their quality of life.”
“It was my choice to stay inside and learn the family business when I was young. And it was my choice to spend a few days settling in now.” Tony’s eyes were bright with rage. “Knock it off with this psychoanalysis bullshit, we both know you only passed ‘Intro To Psych’ because you were fucking the TA.”
“The door is jammed, I’ll get back to you,” Steve said. Outside there was muttering, then the man started shouting for the guards. Steve started tossing boxes against the door to barricade it. Tony worked as fast as he could, but there were still 18 more planes to go. He wasn’t going to make it.
He had found in life that there was always a why. The toaster cooked bread because of electricity, the sun rose in the mornings because the earth rotated, and he couldn’t have more snacks because it was going to ruin his appetite for dinner. As he watched child after child die, he couldn’t see it, couldn’t understand it, couldn’t force it into a shape that made sense. And everything usually made sense to Tony, his teacher said he was the smartest in the class.
“And you still came changing into the river after me?” Steve shook his head. “Of course you did. No self preservation at all."
Tony must have been looking for Stane so they could start the ceremony, there was nothing to worry about. Steve went back to chatting with Clint, and now Jan to. In fifteen minutes they made their way to the front of the barn. The organs let out the first crooning note, the door at the end of the hall opened, and Tony stepped out. Stane was walking him down the aisle, one arm looped possessively through his. Tony was stiff as a board, his face blank. His normally fluffy hair was tamed back almost aggressively and he looked pale in his black suit. When he reached the alter Steve took Tony’s hands, and they were trembling.
On the broadcasts they always made it look like a careless tribute had lost control of their campfire, whenever flames started to spread. Little did viewers at home know that military grade weapons had started the blaze. Apparently there was more to being Game Master than making sure no one got out of the arena. Now that Hammer was in charge, he wanted to give the people back home a show to remember, and that meant fire and excitement.
And then everything quieted down, and somehow it was worse. It had only been a few weeks, and everyone just moved on, like we hadn’t just lost everything. And then a few months later, Jan and Clint moved on too. And… sometimes I hate them for that. Sometimes I just want to shake them and scream, 'How can you forget them??? How can you just let them go? Did they mean nothing to you??? They were our family and they loved us and we loved them and now they’re gone and they’re never coming back and they didn’t die in peace they died in writhing agony and I had to see my own mother ripped inside out lying in the entryway and every time I walk in that godforsaken front door that’s all I expect to see!” Steve sobbed. Tony pulled him into a hug and he cried into his shoulder, the words pouring out in an unstoppable wave of grief. “-and we don’t know who did this and even if we did there is nothing we can do but wait from them to come back and finish the job, because this is my home and we have nowhere else to go. And I am burning up with hate, for the people who did this to us, but since they’re not here is just spills out and covers everything near me until everything is red and harsh and rough and I snap and lash out until there’s nothing left to break. When I’m not angry I’m sick to my stomach with jealousy, because I see Jan and Clint smiling and laughing and I can’t, because I’m eating off a plate that my aunt broke and glued back together, resting on a table with Bucky’s name carved into the bottom, thinking that Ma would have loved that joke, and every time I open my mouth to laugh I just drown in the ghosts of the people who should be here laughing with me. I’m stuck here, weighed down by a fucking albatross of a past no one else seems to care about, and I can’t move on, and I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t know if I want to fix it, because fixing it would mean letting go and I just can’t.
“My friend Rhodey is overseas now too. He’ll be back on the 24th, then be gone again by the 3rd. It sucks.”
He liked that version better. He liked the idea of all the doubts he had had over the last few months being drowned out by a loud resounding “I love you”, all his insecurities soothed by a balm of kisses, all the baggage burned away by a fire of passion.
Steve clenched and unclenched his fists. He had been waiting to meet with Stane for over an hour, and his patience was wearing thin. If it had been any other person, and if his pack had been where it had been a year ago, he would have already walked out. Hell, if his pack was how it was for most his life, he wouldn't be here, period. He had never been any good at this kind of stuff, and that was fine, it was a nice joke, Bucky or his ma would laugh at his stumbling efforts at diplomacy, then they’d go sweet talk him out of whatever hole he'd dug himself into. And right now, he was in a hell of a hole. So he sat in an uncomfortable post modernist chair, and stewed in his hatred for the over the top opulence of the waiting room. Peppy elevator music struggled to cover the loud ticks of the artsy clock hanging above his head. He tapped his foot in time with the ticks until the receptionist glared at him. Then he started tapping his fingers too, because fuck her, and this clock, and this stupid room, and his collared shirt that was too tight, and Stane, for making him wait an entire goddam hour in this little room when there was so much work he needed to get done back home….
Tony had always known he was going to die someday, but right now it was staring him in the face. There were so many things he had never gotten to do. Would Rhodey miss him? Would Obie? Or did they both think he was a traitor? How could Obie do this to him? He was supposed to be family.
Clint continued on. “Steve never introduced you to Dottie? He loves Dottie! She's his favorite cow.”
Ok, Steve understood Jan and Clint trying to set him up. The question was, why was Tony playing along? This was just embarrassing, a high class guy like him had to be used to a lot more flash and charm than this. Even if somehow Jan and Clint had been right and he liked him, that sure wasn’t going to last for long with Clint acting as ‘wingman’.
“I sold mine along with everything else of value when I was having my meltdown over Yinsen, and the ones at Stark Industries are owned by the company, I can’t just take one. We need to buy a computer. And not a laptop, I need a full computer with a keyboard, mouse, and halfway decent processing power to run the modeling software.”
“Who told you about this place? I didn’t put it in the book. It’s my favorite spot, and I didn’t want to have to fight a bunch of tourists any time I wanted a good lunch.”
More than he could convey with words. How did he say that without him the world felt like a very cold and very cruel place? How did he say that when Steve died he had taken a piece of Tony with him?
“Do either of you need any help?” he asked. Jan handed him the mayonnaise and the bread so he got out a knife and started spreading it on with even strokes. Tony didn’t bother to look up from his work. “Did you know that just about every appliance you own is broken?”
Today was the day. He was getting married. He was actually getting married. He quickly showered, and pulled out the fancy suit from his closet. Though he would be giving up his claim to the pack by marrying him, Tony was still a Stark and the son of the previous Alpha. Him being married off with anything less than the best would be embarrassing to the pack. So, a new fitted suit for Steve, probably the nicest thing he had ever worn. Tony had been in charge of their suits, dragging all of them down to the city as soon as they finished their chores. Once there, he had shoved Steve into a dressing room with a armful of suits to try on. He spent the rest of the afternoon changing between suits that all looked the same to him, while Tony and Jan fretted over every little detail. Steve had never worn a suit before, and didn’t much like it. Then Tony threatened him with a tux, and he shut up. Eventually they settled on something, and Steve went in the next room to get it fitted while Tony looked for something for himself. Apparently he got a good one, though Steve was working off Jan’s description and at this point she was so thrilled for the wedding even a brown canvas bag would be described as ‘absolutely perfect’. Steve had figured out her over the top excitement for anything wedding related when they found out they’d be drinking from mason jars instead of real cups and she had squealed with joy, gong on about themes and hipsters, but the cool kind of hipsters, you know?
Step one was to shut down all of the cameras, then all the security scanners. Automatic defenses went next, along with all emergency broadcast systems and early warning alarms. Manual fire defenses were last, and he revoked everyone’s authorization for use.
Steve dutifully added a full two lines of exclamation points to his last sentence and scrunched his nose as he tried to remember the next question. “Favorite animal I think it was?”
“Sorry sorry sorry.” mumbled Jan, not sure if she was apologizing to Steve for Tony’s intrusion, or to Tony for her older cousin’s state. Tony plopped down on the edge of the bed, making the old springs creak and bounce. Steve turned over, putting his back to him.
Tony could hear him grabbing his gear and running in the background, the sound of the jet growing louder as he entered the hanger located in the top of Avenger’s tower.
Tony hugged him and Obadiah Stane, President of Pandora, patted him roughly on the back. Tony immediately felt better. Obie was practically his dad, since his parents had died four years ago. And even when they had been alive Obie had been much more of a parent than his actual dad. Obie wouldn’t let anything bad happen to him.
“It was a close call,” Steve said grimly. “We need to try harder not to get separated. We should start looking for a safe place to stay, somewhere we can meet back up if we do end up apart.”
“Could we do this over lunch?” Tony asked. “I’m starved, this streets is a mess, and Brian looks like he’s about ready to fall over.”
Inside Stark Industries, Tony was signing away the company and pack to Pepper. After watching him shift to a wolf, years of conditioning told the pack that Tony was a danger who could not be trusted. He was also close to Stane, and everyone else close to their previous leader was currently in jail. The final straw was that Tony was still firmly anti weapon. The pack did not want him back, even if Tony was willing, which was debatable. Tony had taken to the country life surprisingly well, and didn’t want to leave the ranch. Instead, he convinced others to come join them. After the disastrous wedding, some of the members of the Stark pack began to doubt what Stane had taught them. A quick demonstration of an easy shift and a safe wolf form had them convinced to switch packs, and left Steve airing out rooms in the house that had been empty for years. Rhodey, Thor, Bruce, Natasha, Sam, Pietro, Wanda and Hank moved in and never looked back. Pepper and her husband Happy stayed behind at the Stark pack, to slowly guide them away from weapons without putting the company under and everyone out of work. It was a difficult job, but Tony was sure that if anyone could do it, it would be Pepper.
“Tony,” Loki repeated with a tilt of his head. “A nickname. Is that all? Most people have a full name and a surname at least, sometimes a title.”
“Ready!” Tony answered with a grin. Steve started up the truck and pulled out of the lot and started driving, the freedom of the road stretching wide before them, the sun bright in the cloudless sky.
Though he was now alone with the dragon, Tony didn’t feel threatened. Something about her told him that she was safe.
Tony grinned up at him with bloody teeth. “You can’t kill me, the whole world is watching! They all want to see the winner of the games and there will be questions if they don’t! You want to take my winnings? Go for it! I have more money than I know what to do with! You want to beat me? Good luck doing anything worse than what I’ve already been through.”
Steve dusted his hands off on his pants and shrugged. “Four months, one week, and three days. But who’s counting?”
Clint whistled, long and low. “Oh yeah, that's rough. Last time a person gave me one of those, I was out for a week. Terrible things, just terrible.” Clint looked at him in mock pity. Steve sighed and put his head forward to rest against his knees where they were pulled up to his chest. “Tell me about it.”
What did that have to do with anything? He shrugged. “Millions? I don’t pay that close of attention.” He pulled out his phone and opened his account. “I have 134 million. Decent, eh?”
Tony hit the big green ‘revive’ button and waited with baited breath as the tubes started to drain, the liquid flowing out through tick tubes. The room started to warm, the frost on the glass turning into water droplets and sliding down the sides of the tubes. Tony starled backwards as Natasha slammed her hand into the side of the tube. He looked down the control panel and hit the open button. Natasha stumbled out of her tube first, with the others seconds behind. Steve was the last to step out, unsteady and shivering violently. Tony ran forward and pulled him into a hug, not caring as the slime soaked into his clothes and smeared across his neck and Steve hugged him back.
Steve let Tony go and looked over the mess of flour and bowls scatter across the counter. He had the feeling that he would be the one washing them later.
There was a pause and Steve didn’t dare open his eyes as he heard the footsteps in the hall continue to search, getting closer.
His eyes fell on a little toy robot dog. He had always wanted a dog, but he hadn’t been allowed when he was younger and now he traveled too much to take care of one. What if he built himself a pet?
“I can’t argue with ya there. Come on, if you were brave enough to fight him, you can be brave enough to talk to him. Let's go.”
With a beep Jarvis sounded an alert. “There is a 99% match found for the criminal known as Maxwell, and his partner Kane. They are attempting to break into a house just outside the city limits.”
“Fine, fine. Tony, what is your most favorite season?” he asked, dragging out the ‘o’ in favorite like an over excited grade schooler.
“I know you are. And I’m sorry too, because I didn’t love you like you deserved to be loved either.” Tony closed his eyes and his hand stilled. “I’m going to sleep. Any more talking can happen tomorrow.”
Liberty made a rumbling sound. “Anthony… worthy of praise… it is a fitting name. My name is Liberty.” Except she didn’t say Liberty. She sent the feeling of flying through clear blue skies, of being able to go anywhere, do anything, or to do absolutely nothing, just to exist and be free.
Tony rushed outside and drove to the center of the city. He pulled his car to a stop on the curb outside and scanned his card to get inside. He went up the stairs to Obie’s office where four peacekeepers stepped in his way.
Steve cursed but he followed Tony as he fought his way back, doing his best to stay inside the trail they had already made. Without having to cut a path the travel back was easier, and Tony swore he could feel the snow lightening and the breeze lessening with every step they took back towards the center of the arena. The storm was obviously the work of the Game Master, trying to drive everyone together for a final showdown.
Steve shook his head, and despite their clear confusion Jan and Hank followed him back out of the prison without setting him free.
“I didn’t meet up with Christine last night.” He grabbed Steve’s hand and tugged him closer, looking at him from lowered lashes. “And if you’ll give me a second chance, I’ll take that kiss now.”
Tony nodded, and let himself relax against Liberty’s side, his eyes squinting shut as Steve and Pepper started talking out the logistics.
“Hi guys, look who I found in the hallway. It's Steve, the most handsome and kind man in the whole world.”
If Steve had weighed more than a hundred pounds he would have crushed Tony as he half fell on the bed in his haste to hug him. Tony held him tight while Steve half yelled at him, and half cried in thanks that he was ok.
He shrugged. “Tony wanted to come into town with us, plus I need to finally pay off the bank, so I thought we'd make a whole day of it.”
“Christine. Sure.” Steve took a deep breath. “The bar I wrote about is called Jacks, it's about ten minutes from here. I’ll walk you.”
Tony had missed the first part of the broadcast two days ago, and all of the last broadcast, so he didn’t know how many people were left. It seemed to be too good to be true that none of their allies had fallen in the past two days. And had it really been three days? If someone had asked him last year how long he would survive in the Hunger Games, he would not have said three days. Maybe three minutes.
Steve hauled himself out of bed, and started pulling on his uniform. “Tell everyone to assemble in the hanger.”
“It’s not a joke. You’re a superhero, you fight crime in a flying metal suit, you were attacked by a magic user while fighting downtown. You live in a tower with the rest of our friends. Any of this ringing a bell?”
That was great because he was sorry too, so now they could be happy together again. They should get a puppy.
Though he had tried to explain the dream to Tony using the Matrix, Steve was a little more old fashioned. He made sure he had a firm hold on his friend, and clicked the heels of his red boots together three times. The world spun around them and Steve blacked out.
“You’re preventing me from doing my job. We were separated by glass, there was nothing he could have done.” Tony complained.
“You cancelled it? Why? I mean, the chairs in the living room weren’t great, but we could have lived with it for a few days, you didn’t need to cancel the whole thing.”
He held out his dice and the woman hanging off his arm blew on them. Then Tony held out the dice to Rhodey. “Come on Honey Bear, give me a little good luck.”
He rounded the corner of the castle and froze. The small building that had been his safe refuge for the past ten years was on fire, all of his hard work and his only chance of fighting back were now up in smoke. A group of men circled around the building, fanning out to surround Tony. Tony held up his frying pan, and the man in front laughed. It was Rumlow, one of Thor’s captains. The rot in the government ran deep, much deeper than Tony had ever believed possible. He hadn’t been paying attention, all too happy to stay locked away in his little forge, tinkering away and not worrying who exactly he was building things for. Rumlow stepped forward and knocked the pan out of Tony’s hands with a quick swipe of his sword. He kicked Tony in the stomach, and he fell to the ground with a pained
“The suit is only at 50% of its normal functionality after your last battle with the aforementioned bugs, and repairs will take at least another six hours.” Jarvis warned, his disapproval clear. “Perhaps you should let your team take care of this one until you are restored to full functionality.”
Almost done, I got one chapter left, then some art. I haven't decided if I'm going to post that at the end or as a new chapter yet. Probably a new chapter. I got my wisdom teeth out and it still sort of feels like the time my brother hit me in the face with a snow shovel, so this chapter is more unedited than usual.
Tony waved absentmindedly as he turned back to his work, and Steve quickly walked out of the lab. He went back to his room and sat on his bed, upset. He felt like a real heel. All Tony had wanted was for someone to spend some time with him on his birthday, and Steve had only done it because he felt like he had too, and on the wrong day too. He didn’t when Tony’s actual birthday was, despite having access to his file. He had never bothered to look. Did the other Avengers know? Had they even said happy birthday to the guy who was building their gear and letting them live in his house for free? Probably not.
“You’ve had a rough time lately, I’m trying to help. And I missed you.” Tony let him go with a sigh and a pat to his shoulder. “Follow me. I like to make modifications on the mech suits and it goes faster when you help.”
Sam put a firm hand on his shoulder and forced him into a seat at the table. Natasha sat down on his other side, as moral support. The other groups filed in, and they started the meeting at 9 o’clock on the dot. Carol ran a tight ship. They started the meeting by sharing what information they had, and Steve didn’t have much to contribute. Tony had always been the one looking ahead to nip future problems in the bud. Steve had enough on his plate keeping the day to day operations running smoothly. That was part of why they made such a great team. People yammered on and Steve forced himself to remain focused. What was discussed today would affect all of their plans going forward.
“Well?” Tony asked impatiently, arranging and rearranging the ingredients. He balanced a teaspoon on top of a quarter teaspoon and tried to spin it. It didn’t work, spinning off to hit the floor. Tony left it there.
Howard passed Tony over to her, and left the room. Maria let Tony hide his face against her shoulder, and he tried to ignore the awful sounds coming from the tv, as a tribute beat someone’s head in with a rock, laughing hysterically.
He decided to do the same thing he had been doing whenever he was in a shitty situation since the age of 14 and call Rhodey. He picked up on the first ring.
The next few days passed slowly, Tony avoiding Steve and Liberty as well as he could in the small rebel base as they got everyone settled. Steve would gaze at him longingly from across the hall, and Tony could feel his sadness. Still, Steve left him to his peace until they all gathered as a large group to discuss strategy.
He had approached it from behind a piece of rubble and opened fire, tearing it open in a splatter of blue blood. The alien turned on him and ripped him open with inch long claws, and they had fallen to the ground together, blood mixing to purple and soaking into the dusty street. Steve felt himself growing weak, and closed his eyes for the last time, glad to go out protecting his country.
How could the official channel be lying? All of the contestants wanted to go into the arena, right? Why would they have to fake it?
“Thank you. That's why I'm here, actually. My pack needs assistance.” He clenched and unclenched his fists. In its entire history, the Rogers pack had never asked for help. They had always kept out of the petty dramas of the other packs, preferring to raise cattle in isolation. For almost two centuries they remained healthy and prosperous, the lack of fighting and surplus of food making them the largest pack in the west. Then things started to go down hill. Steve didn't know when or why it had happened, but he had always lived a life of hand me down clothes, and bills paid off with loans, which were in turn paid off with other loans while the bank breathed heavily over their shoulders. The pack dwindled down from over a hundred to ninety, then fifty, then to just twenty people. As of today, they were down to three. There was no one else left, the entire legacy of his pack now relied on him to preserve it. So that's why he was here, begging at the feet of Obadiah Stane, the acting alpha of the Stark pack. The new greatest pack in the west, built on blood money earned from selling advanced weapons to their lucrative military contracts. They forgot all of the old ways, the ways of the wolf. They lived almost entirely in the human world, and didn't function as a pack so much as a corporation, with levels of workers and bosses with Stane at the top. Please check your inner wolf at the door, and do remember to pick it back up again on the way out, he thought to himself mockingly. Steve wouldn't have even been able to guess Stane was a wolf at all, behind the Italian suit and under the layers of expensive cologne and more expensive cigar smoke. It rackled him deeply that this was the leader of what his society now considered the most successful pack. Had Stane ever run wild through the woods, chasing down rabbits with his pack mates? Had he ever climbed a mountain so he could howl a little closer to the moon? Had he ever burrowed deep into the snow, and trusted his thick coat to keep him warm as he waited for an elk to pass by? Looking at his fat manicured fingers covered in rings, Steve doubted it. Every fiber of his being was telling him to just challenge the man, to rip out his throat and take his money and lands for himself. But that wasn't how it worked anymore. The packs had treaties. The packs had rules. (Not that that ever did his pack any good.) He couldn't take on the entire system with two other people, and whether he liked it or not, the old ways were dead. So now he was here, to grovel on his belly like a pup for a treat.
Jan wrung her hands. “Oh no, it’s ok, yesterday was pretty rough, we really should leave him alone Tony, he gets like this sometimes, he’ll be right as rain by tomorrow, right Steve? Right! Now let’s go...” She grabbed Tony’s arm and tried to pull him away. He didn’t budge.
“Just don’t post anything illegal or incriminating. Come on, I have a proposal for a new manufacturing location.” Pepper lead him inside, and the topic was dropped.
“I noticed you liked the pizza last time, so we’re going to get more tonight. This place is called Archie’s, and they have the best deep dish.”
“All of it. No.” Tony insisted and Steve's breath puffed warmly against the back of his neck as he laughed. “You’re so grumpy in the morning.”
“No! It doesn’t have to be this way! You don’t have to pick between me and the fish, because I have a terrible secret I’ve been keeping from you all this time.”
Steve sighed to himself, clearly thinking about the last time they fought these guys, where Tony had charged in head first and almost gotten himself killed trying to take on the birds alone.
a fucking dump! Half of it is boarded up, there’s holes in the roof, your heater doesn’t work, your sinks all leak and it took me six rooms before I found one that wasn’t full of moths! I’m not being a spoiled rich brat when I want to sleep on a sheet with no holes! I had to take apart a doorknob this morning to get out of the room! You can’t live like this!”
“I take it all back,” Tony agreed immediately. “I'd say you're the best except you drank my coffee, so I'm gonna have to put you after Rhodey. I can assure you it's close though, and the top three all get prizes so there's really nothing wrong with runner up.” As Tony was talking, Clint sat up in his chair. “Wait, your favorite mug is the kitten mug? The kitten mug???”
, and Thor kept his mouth shut because his own record with keeping the Tower in one piece was less than stellar. Falcon was boasting that he hadn't destroyed the Tower, not even once, and Natasha brought up how sad that was that they considered that an accomplishment. Clint joked that it was Natasha's turn to ruin it, and she should hurry up because he had some great ideas for his second go around. Tony threatened that if they blew up his beautiful tower one more time he was kicking them out on the streets.
The pain wasn’t alright, but it was more because Tony wasn’t used to it than because it was debilitating, so he shook his head. “I’m fine. I might complain more to piss off Clint.”
He put his phone away and parted ways with Steve to go back to his hotel. On his way back he passed a homegoods store and paused. He should buy Steve a fridge, that way he’d have a spot to put his leftovers. He went inside and picked out the biggest and nicest one they had, and paid to have it sent to Steve’s apartment. A voice inside his head that sounded suspiciously like Pepper said that this was a bad idea. Why was this a bad idea? He thought it through. He went back and cancelled the order.
“I’ll do it,” Steve responded without hesitation. Strange sighed and shook his head, but agreed to perform the spell to send Steve in. Steve laid down on the bench next to the table, Tony already filling that. Strange waved his hands and the faces of Steve’s team mates disappeared in a swirl of orange.
Tony rushed through the halls of the castle, ducking behind a pillar as a troop of guards marched pass. Once they were gone he looked both ways and darted back out, taking cover behind whatever he could as he made his way to the doors. Two men stood in front of the door from the kitchen to the outside, and Tony cursed. He had already checked his other options, and they were blocked off too. Tony had to give it to Loki, his coup against Thor had been incredibly well executed so far. This was the only door with less than ten men watching it... he would have to take his chances. He crept into the kitchen, and hid behind the counter. He reached his hand up and patted around until his hand found cool metal. He pulled it down with a slight ring of the metal dragging on the counter top. It was a frying pan. Tony had been hoping for a knife, but this would have to work. He stood up and the guards immediately pointed their swords at him. Swords he made, those ungrateful bastards.
He spat it to the ground, splattering the floor with blood where it soaked into the dirt. "You should have stayed lost, little lamb."
Steve smiled, and joked back, “It's a date.” Then he turned serious, going into what Tony thought of as Captain mode. “I wasn't kidding Tony, if you fly off alone again I'm going to hurt you worse than the birds!”
“Clint texted and said that they’re back from their mission, and Nat broke her arm. I wanted to make her something nice.”
Thor swung at the birds with his hammer, passing through them as they dissolved into smoke, this time reforming only moments later in their same size and form. “I have had one of your omelettes in the past, friend Stark, and I think I would prefer my eggs unbroken.” He raised his hammer and called down lighting,lighting up the street with a boom of sound and light. It did no more damage to the birds than Tony waving his hands through the air.
“Interesting advice, coming from the man who tried to enlist in the army ten times back when he could have been blown away by a stiff breeze.”
“Are you sure he didn’t come into contact with any other dragons?” Asked a brown haired man, who looked far too timid to have been a knight, yet still wore their colors.
“Please pay attention, the following broadcast is mandatory for all citizens. All drivers please pull over and all manufacturers halt production,” a robotic voice droned. Outside peacekeepers prowled the streets, harassing people who weren’t standing in front of the large public televisions, and using their universal keys to go inside randomly selected houses to make sure the occupants were in front of the tv. Rhodey picked up the phone.
He tapped his head like he was telling Tony a clever little secret. Tony was mostly trying not to throw up or cry.
Steve handed them over then grabbed Tony’s hand as he brought it to his mouth. “We need to make sure your foot is set in the right position first. If the bone is misaligned it’ll heal wrong and you still won’t be able to walk.”
“You know I’m not. We were both supposed to be backstage preparing for the opening ceremonies an hour ago.”
All eyes turned to him. Steve spoke. “That would be useful it if were true. Then the dragons could burn all who stood against us.”
He pulled him into a hug. “It’s ok, we’ll be right back here before you know it, it doesn’t matter. I trust you, Sunshine.”
Though he knew that intellectually, it wasn’t good enough. And for the first time, Tony was close enough that he could go look and make sure. He opened the door and stuck his head out. It was late and the hallway was empty. He walked a few steps then paused. He didn’t know where Tony was. He had to be close. Carol had confirmed during the meeting that they were all staying in the same building for security reasons. Natasha would know, she never slept until she had the whole building scoped out. He knocked on her door and she opened it with a scowl a few seconds later, her hair in total disarray.
Steve put a hand on his shoulder. “Hey, you’re going to do great, and all of us are going to be behind you every step of the way.”
None of the ideas felt right. Why did all his friends have to be so disgustingly practical? They wouldn’t take anything that wouldn’t be useful. He wasn’t in the mood to make anything useful, he had already spent eight hours a day at work doing that.
“Plans, lots and lots of very detailed plans. We could finally be together, after all the Capital has done to keep us apart. If only Thor wasn’t hurt, we could right now. I’d show you a good time, would you like that?”
Everyone shuffled together their things and got up, leaving the room as a tired pack. Most of them headed towards the dining center but the peacekeeper held Tony back.
Steve’s suit was grey, and his jacket was swung over his shoulders revealing dark suspenders. Tony thought his brain was short circuiting, but due to the blush on the blonde’s face, he seemed to be feeling the same way.
They spent about another thirty minutes hanging out before driving over to Thor’s house. They knocked on the door and weren’t surprised when it was opened by a frantic Clint Barton. He was wearing a royal purple suit with a light purple button up and no tie. Tony rolled his eyes.
Bucky pulled Tony in closer. They felt arms around them and laughed when they saw it was Steve practically bawling into their shoulders.
“Tony is going to be a thousand times worse with him here.” Bucky drawled. Bruce nodded in exasperated agreement.
Natasha was dressed in a stunning black dress, and her red hair was pulled up with only a few curls escaping. Tony was pretty sure that her red high heels had knives in them. Even if they didn’t, they were pointy enough to be considered weapons by themselves.
“This is betrayal.” Tony held his hand to his heart and collapsed dramatically. He closed his eyes and laid deadly still. No one could say he wasn’t a drama king. He was surprised when Rhodey scooped him up and fixed him with a serious expression. He hated that expression. The problem wasn’t that Rhodey was disappointed in him because Rhodey was disappointed by approximately seventy five percent of Tony’s decisions, but Rhodey just looked so hurt. This was also the expression that usually preceded a feelings talk. Tony hated those.
“Golly gee you’re going to make a poor housewife blush.” Tony drawled draping his arms around Rhodey’s neck lazily. Rhodey walked over to the couch and dumped Tony on it.
Tony leaned against Bruce and closed his eyes against the brightness of the sun. He fell right in with the group, and it was magical.
“Ok. I’m gonna go.” Tony said. His voice was carefully regulated. He didn’t want to let Rhodey on to how much he was panicking. Unfortunately, it came out sounding emotionless which immediately tipped Rhodey off.
Tony watched Steve skip off to class. He turned back towards Tony and winked. Tony’s face lit up red. Tony loved how blissfully happy Steve looked, but he needed to deal with Rhodey.
“Did you just say country? Clint, you are dead to me.” Tony deadpanned. They argued for a bit longer before the conversation died down.
“That sounds fun” Tony said. He would enjoy seeing Thor’s house. Apparently, his parents were loaded and were frequently out of town. Thor had described his house as super modern which meant it probably wouldn’t even remind Tony of his childhood mansion. All in all, it sounded super fun. Tony had never been to any parties that weren’t based around the desire to consume as much alcohol as possible. College was fun that way. And it was probably good that it wasn’t a big party, despite his hatred of crowds, he’d hated parties for a while. Tiberius had enjoyed them a little too much, and he preferred not to be reminded about his past relationships.
“Yes, Tony, sweetheart, yes.” Tony practically leapt into Steve’s arms, and even though he could hear the others groaning and laughing, he couldn’t seem to care.
“Rhodey’s my brother. Nothing else.” Tony interjected quickly, wondering if that was why Steve looked like someone stole his pencil whenever Rhodey was brought up. He watched as Steve’s face relaxed.
“I’m sorry. I-I’ve never had that happen before.” Tony muttered avoiding eye contact with the other genius.
He and Bruce would work quietly but efficiently during science. Everyone once in a while, Bruce would bump their shoulders together. Tony had never felt more cared for. It was so stupid, but having someone respect his intelligence and silently care for him was making him embarrassingly happy. Bruce would always cover for Tony whenever Tony showed any signs of panicking at seemingly normal things. He never asked any questions, just gave Tony a small smile before making a science joke under his breath that never failed to distract him.
“Tony Scott.” Tony offered up. He couldn’t help but notice the roughness of his own voice and winced inwardly. He was bringing the guy down just by sitting next to him.
“Did I do something?” Steve’s eyes were desperate. His expression was terrible and Tony felt so guilty that he put it there.
“It’s okay. It’s boring. I’m relatively okay. The hallways are loud and crowded. Your fighting services are not needed. I met a weirdly chipper junior. His name’s Agent. Don’t be worried Mom, I’m fine.” Tony answered in monotone.
“It’s okay, kid. It’s HammerTech. Top of the line.” He punctuated the sentence with a smirk, and Tony tried not to vomit. Maybe one day when Tony wasn’t in hiding anymore he could build Bucky an arm that would 1000% be better than any HammerTech one. He knew he couldn’t comment though because it would bring him dangerously close to territory he isn’t supposed to discuss. God, HammerTech. That was so gross.
“Well he does have an actual name I think, but I promptly forgot it. He introduced himself with a James Bond reference. How else was I supposed to react?” Tony complained.
Tony saluted Jarvis, got in the car, and drove off. He drew in a sharp breath when he realized that this might be the last time he saw Jarvis for a long time. Jarvis was too well known as his butler. He couldn’t be seen around Tony Scott: the innocent nerdy senior. Tony fought off his anguish at watching his loving father figure disappear in his rear-view mirror. He wasn’t as upset about not being able to see Howard or Maria. They were never really around anyway; he had been going to college where they never bothered to visit. Jarvis made the drive as much as possible and it always choked Tony up when he thought about the care the old man showed him.
“It’s for good luck! Bucky is even gonna ask Bruce to wear his.” Steve quickly followed up. Well that answered that. If Bucky and Bruce were romantically interested in each other, then Tony would give up tech for good. That was fine. It was probably better that Steve wasn’t interested in him anyway. It wasn’t fair to date somebody who could never know the truth about who he was. That’s super terrible.
“How did no one know about this? No offense, but your time at MIT was highly publicized down to every gross detail.” Clint asked with a sheepish expression.
“Good to see you again man.” Clint said with a shoulder bump. Tony looked at him confused before focusing back on his notebook. He didn’t have time to worry about Clint being weird. He had stuff to invent. Lots of stuff.
The first-time Tony met Rhodey, he was drunk off his ass. He was blasting ACDC, lying on his bed, and probably crying. He had gotten in an argument with Howard that he couldn’t really remember, but it had upset fifteen-year-old him quite a lot. Rhodey walked into the room and promptly walked out. Tony figured he had already fucked up his relationship with his roommate which only made him cry harder because how was he so bad at making friends? Was he really as horrible at socializing as Howard told him? Tony was shocked when Rhodey returned with a large box of tissues and a hangover concoction that the boy next door apparently had down to a pat. Rhodey didn’t turn off his music which was an instant love connection in Tony’s book. He just sat down next to Tony and waited for the boy to calm down. They had a heartfelt conversation which ended with Tony spilling all of his insecurities to a boy he barely knew. When it sunk in, Tony was so horrified that he promptly passed out. He woke up with an Advil and hangover concoction on the table next to him. Taped to his chest was a note that read – ‘You aren’t the dick I thought you were going to be. Let’s hang out when you aren’t super drunk. You seem pretty cool. James Rhodes.’ They had been best friends ever since.
“We can talk tomorrow when we've calmed down. Good night. I'm sure Jan will be happy to find you some clean sheets.”
“Is this the guy you’ve been tagging on Instagram? The whole world is already convinced you’re dating.”
“There you go. So as I was saying, kids these days are too much for me. I feel like you. I can never make fun of your old man ways again.”
“No. He didn’t trust himself with all the brainwashing and code words locked up inside his head. He’s in cryo for now.”
Steve took a breath. Ok, that was terrible insulting, yes, and he wanted to ram his fist into that basterd’s doughly mouth, alright, gotcha, but it wasn't technically a ‘no’. He could work with this. He was going to work with this. Janny would be so proud. Clint would be disappointed he hadn’t already punched him.
“What are you going to say? You need to think about it now so you don’t freeze up when we actually get there.”
“I have seen you tend to both Liberty and I with great care, I have seen you risk your life for hers, I have seen you return for your people, and I have seen you volunteer your life for our cause. There is nothing else I need to know. I was interested in earning your affections even before I knew our souls were so closely tied that we could both speak with Liberty.”
Steve felt his face heat up. Tony leaned closer. “I didn’t think it’d be the kind of thing you would like.”
Steve pushed his hand off and stumbled to his feet, glaring up at his uniformed self. “Why won’t you
Steve whirled on him, pointing at the brown cardbox like it was a dead bird Tony had dragged into the house out of a misplaced need for approval. “Did you do this?”
He ate it methodically as Jan and Clint wandered downstairs. He went outside and the frost from the grass collected on his boots. He opened the doors to the barn and the cows ambled outside as the sun peeked up from behind the mountains. The barn door was warping as the waterproof paint peeled off. He would need to fix this too. He added it to his already overflowing mental checklist, and went back inside. Clint and Jan were more awake now, having a quiet conversation between themselves. Tony was no where to be seen, probably still sleeping. Steve left the kitchen to go wake him up, and realized that he didn't actually know which room he had picked.
That was enough scenarios for one night. There was nothing he could do about it now. Steve closed his eyes and forced himself to sleep.
Clint, Bucky and Jan were going to be standing for him as groomsmen. Tony’s side had a tall red headed woman standing in heels that made her even taller, a stout and pale blonde man with a boxer’s nose, and a frowning African American man who held himself like he was career military. It was a weird reminder that Steve didn’t know much about Tony’s past, or his friends in the Stark pack.
Rude. Tony pulled out his phone and set Jarvis to sniffing out Steve’s address. In less than thirty seconds he was in a lyft and on his way.
“Sure.” Steve agreed amiably. There was no doubt in his mind now that Tony had taken it. Neither of them were any good at lying to each other.
Clint gave him a sloppy salute. “Congratulations, Mr. President. Does this mean I can do crimes and you can pardon me?”
There were three arrows left, and the one with the tip was still there. Natasha had been the ones who sunk them into the ground, so she had to go last because she had a greater chance of knowing which one it was. Tony and Bruce looked at each other, and Bruce held out his arm, offering Tony the next pick. Tony slid down the side of the cornucopia, and shivered as he stepped away from its heated warmth. He carefully considered the three arrows remaining. All their feathers ended at the same height, and none of them showed in cracks in the wood of the shaft that might have indicated that they were broken. There was no way to tell which one was the one. He took a deep breath and pulled one at random, closing his eyes as he pulled. The arrow slipped from the dirt smoothly and he knew the result before he opened his eyes.
Here he was so happy. A happy lie. And for all of Tony’s flaws,he was never afraid to face the truth.
Steve knocked him on the side of the head and Tony felt himself fall to the ground as everything went black.
“Well, we are in love, Darling,” he said flippantly, trying to break the tension that was rising between them.
“Oh. Yeah. That’s good.” Steve said awkwardly. Now that he knew Tony was safe, he should go. He stood and Tony grabbed his wrist.
As he talked he destroyed another bird, and watched it blow away into the wind. Maybe he could get them all before the team got here, and convince them there had never been any birds in the first place. In distance a street sign fell over with a clang. Maybe not.
Tony's eyes went lonely and distant. "I had an coworker, Yinsen. He was a doctor and after a while, my unofficial keeper. I met him when we were collaborating on a biological weapon design. That’s where Stark Industries made their money, in the weapons business, and I was a head of R&D. After we finished our collaborative project, Obie reassigned him under me, and together we created some of the most deadly weapons the world had ever seen. I kept pushing for bigger, faster, more powerful. Yinsen didn’t like it. He was always a pacifist at heart. He threatened to quit, so Obie moved him back to the medical division, put him to work on the wolf suppressants.
Tony tilted his head. “I can hear a bird outside. Jan or Clint walked in the back door downstairs. That’s it.”
A thin woman in a suit stepped into the room, and beckoned him forward. He stood up, straightened his shirt, took a deep breath, and strode into the fancy office with a fake smile plastered on his face. The walls inside were covered in modern art, so basically thousand dollar paint splatters. The man he was here to meet lounged behind a solid mahogany desk, smoke from his expensive cigar gently curling towards the ceiling. Steve could still hear the damn clock, all the way down the hall. He looked around, noting that there were no other chairs. Some sort of intimidation tactic he guessed, as he tried to decide what to do with his arms. They trembled at his sides so he crossed them, then quickly uncrossed them because Jan told him that made him look hostile This morning she had tried to jam in a lifetime's worth of negotiation skills into his head on the half hour ride over, while Clint laughed like a hyena from the truck bed and suggested that they just duke it out like real wolves. She was probably sitting in the pickup right now, plotting with Clint for what they would do once he fucked this up. Maybe if he did better than they’d expected, they'd lie about it. Pretend that they’d thought them up on the fly, that they hadn't all gone into this knowing this would be their last chance, and everything was riding on Steve ‘fight me’ Rogers being diplomatic. They should have just sent Jan, she would have been a hundred times better at this. But she wasn't an elder, and wasn't the alpha wolf of the pack. So here he was, in one of Bucky’s old collared shirts, because he didn't own one of his own, trying to play proud and powerful pack alpha, with a total of two other pack members, a ranch mortgaged to hell and back, and twenty bucks cash between the three of them. He wondered if clenching his fists was considered more or less hostile than crossing his arms. He wondered if it would matter once he opened his fat mouth. He wondered if this meeting was ever going to start, or if he had spent an hour waiting in that stupid room with the stupid clock, just so he could spend another hour having a stare down with Stane. If he won the staring contest, could they skip the talking and he could just leave? Or was he supposed to lose as a sign of respect or something? Jan barely got through the ‘no punching during polite negotiations’ level of rules, he had no clue if there were secret eye contact codes. Blink twice if you're willing to go lower on the price, keep staring until your eyeballs dry out and pop out of your skull if you want more. Fuck this. He looked away and cleared his throat. “Thank you for agreeing to see me today, Sir.”
A week later Tony was standing in front of his mirror freaking out. His hands were shaking really bad, so Natasha did his makeup while Pepper curled his short hair around his face.
Tony mumbled but didn’t contradict what he was saying. He did miss being able to wander around his skirts. Maybe he should tell his team. Natasha was nice about it. He should ask her. Rhodey seemed to be able to read the look in his eyes because he shot him a stern look.
Steve kept their hands intertwined, but used his free one to caress Tony’s cheek. His eyes were so fond. He looked like Tony was a gift for him. He looked like Tony was all he ever wanted. Tony could feel himself getting teary, and they hadn’t kissed yet. Steve searched Tony for sincerity before smiling. With Steve’s fingers just barely touching his jaw, their lips touched for the first time. It wasn’t magical or life changing or all that different from the kisses he’d had before. Steve’s lips were slightly chapped, and the angle was a little weird because of how much taller Steve was, and his glasses were in the way but Tony didn’t care. He didn’t want it to be perfect or otherworldly. It was real. It was Steve’s hand tight around his own, and it was Steve’s fingers winding through his untamable hair, and it was Steve’s lips pressing against his. They broke apart to breathe, and Tony let out a stunned laugh.
“Holy shit.” Bucky whispered. Both boys turned to face him and he was looking right at Tony’s blueprints. “That’s insane. I keep up with all the new science inventions and that is… whoa.”
Bruce didn’t seem to be able to come up with an excuse. He did spend most of his time with Thor. The two of them just got along like a house on fire. His face was pained, and he was looking at Tony apologetically.
“No. Go to class. It’s probably nothing. I’ll come and get all of you guys if it’s something important.” Tony reassured him.
His uncle was still out there. He could have already paid people to finish the job. If the wrong people heard about where he was hiding, then he’d end up with a bullet in his head. He wasn’t stupid. He was supposed to die during his kidnapping. His uncle wanted him to die, but he survived, and he knew that most likely Obadiah there was doing his very best to change that.
Thor sprinted down the stairs with a huge grin on his face. He was wearing a normal black tux, but his tie looked like it was literally made of gold. He ran directly to Bruce and swung to poor genius around.
“I don’t doubt it. You’re really smart, right? You were able to do that math really easily. Oh shoot. I forgot my manners. I’m Steve and this is Bucky.” Steve said with a slight blush.
“No. He’ll probably be here for a while longer until they’re completely sure the threat is neutralized.” Natasha answered.
Tony would have protested, but Natasha’s hands were running through his hair. She was a master at this. Tony muttered a little but settled in. Every time she played with one of his curls he felt his heart squeeze. She knew the truth about him, and she still cared enough to make sure that he was comfortable in this new environment. She hadn’t mentioned his scars even though he knew that she must have wanted to. She was going to keep his secret. She was somebody safe just like Pepper. His whole frame relaxed, and he melted onto the couch.
Dummy was Tony’s kid and it didn’t matter what anyone said to him. He would protect Dummy to the death. One of the main reasons him and Rhodey got along so well was the way that Rhodey treated Dummy. Tony embarrassingly cried out of joy for the second time- the first was when he created Dummy- when he came to his dorm one day and found Rhodey and Dummy together. Rhodey was playing fetch with Dummy, praising him, and treating him like a sentient being. Tony was a goner. He immediately burst into tears and Rhodey and Dummy spent the next half hour working together to fret over Tony until he calmed down.
Natasha informed him that Clint hated football and was only on the team because it was populated with his friends. Clint’s true sports passion was the archery team which amused Tony to no end. Of course, Clint would be an archer. He wondered if Clint could do any tricks or if he could convince him to shoot an apple off Tony’s head. When Tony found out that Clint was the only member of their award-winning archery team, Tony almost died laughing. That was such a Clint thing to do.
“We try to have sleepovers every once in a while as a friend group, and we figured since you joined that we should have one.” Steve continued apparently missing Tony’s bright red face and confused expression. Right well. That made much more sense than Steve asking Tony on a date in front of all their friends.
Steve stared at him in shock, then lunged forward and kissed him again. This time Tony responded eagerly. The door opened behind him then immediately shut. In the hall Steve could hear Natasha telling everyone that they had managed to work it out. She was going to tease him for this later, but right now, with Tony smiling and kissing him, he couldn't bring himself to care.
Above them a fake clapping track played and Tony tried not to wince. The illusion worked on TV, but in person it felt jarring. Were there really no people for this part? Was this new, or has it always been this way and Tony hadn’t paid close enough attention to notice?
“Oh. Um. Yeah. It’s not actually any trouble, and there’s a chance that Clint could’ve grabbed the wrong part, I’m shit at drawing, so I can’t guarantee anything…..”
There was a flash behind them, and the both turned. A girl dressed in an expensive pink blouse and skinny jeans was frowning at her bedazzled phone. “I always forget to turn the flash off,” she said with a pout. Tony put his hands on his hips.
No punishment? Tony felt like he had been put through a meat grinder and he had no idea where the others were.
“He was your companion?” Tony inquired neutrally, feeling a flair of jealousy. It was gone as soon as it appeared. Though the Captain was a handsome man he had not expressed any interest in Tony beyond the conjurings of a fevered mind. Though whose mind was the fevered one was still up to debate.
A skinny blond boy stepped on stage in a blue spandex suit with a white star on the chest and Tony recognized him as the guy who had taken his time in the spotlight to flip everyone off. This was going to be good.
“Sure, why not? I just wanted to celebrate my birthday. Rhodey is on some secret mission overseas. He sent me a nice email, but it’s not the same. A couple years back I forgot Pepper’s birthday, now it’s kind of an inside joke between us to celebrate each other’s birthdays on the wrong day, which is great, it’s fun, but it does mean she doesn’t do anything on my actual birthday. So I sat in my lab alone all day, and at the end I said ‘to Hell with it’, and decided to throw a huge party, because I’m rich and bored and making it through another year of apocalypses and aliens damn well deserves to be celebrated. And we did. Celebrate, that is, yesterday. With burgers. It was great.” Tony looked at him expectantly as Steve stared at him blankly.
Tony held his hands up non threateningly. “No, no, you haven’t done anything wrong. I don’t know much about the district’s computer use and I hoped you could tell me a little?”
There was a scratch at the door. Steve dragged the table away and unlocked it. The door open with a small creak and the wolf walked inside, cautious with ears back and belly low to the ground. The wolf’s scent confirmed what Steve already knew.
“I haven’t seen them, but it’s doubtful. Public computers are usually old and won’t let patrons download their own software, just as a way to avoid viruses. Plus It’s a 45 minute drive out there, gas money would add up fast and you guys need the truck for other things. We need to buy a real computer. Think of it as an investment. 700 bucks now, for 15 grand later.”
“I’m fine. God, I’m an idiot. Sorry, I didn’t realize you would think that something was wrong.” He gripped Rhodey’s shirt to try and reassure him that he was fine.
Bruce could see that Tony was freaking out and quickly intervened, “I don’t think that’s a great idea.”
“You should be careful Tony. You don’t want to get on his bad side. He’s on the football team and he’s wicked popular. Also, his biceps are like the size of your face.” Tony blinked at the other boy but didn’t say anything “Never mind. Let’s just get you to class okay? Oh and by the way a couple of my friends are in this class. Their names are Clint and Natasha. You should say hi to them. I need to leave or I’ll be late. Bye, Tony.”
The two of them end up picking an elegant red dress for Tony to wear along with sparkly gold heels. By the end of it, Tony is thrilled about coming out to his team. His birthday is at the end of the week. He doesn’t have to wait long now.
When the Avengers moved into the tower, it became a lot harder for him to keep his secret. Tony’s heels all became ‘gifts’ for Pepper because he couldn’t exactly tell the team that he liked to wear cute dresses and heels and wear makeup. The amount of ridicule he would get from Barton was deterrent enough. His dresses and makeup had to be placed in a safe controlled by JARVIS just in case someone managed to get into his bedroom. The only times he felt comfortable were when all of the Avengers were out of the tower.
It only got funnier when everyone in the circle, but Tony shouted “Language” back at him. Tony wondered what the story was for that. He tried not to let the inside joke bother him. It was only natural that a friend group like theirs would have jokes from before he came around. He just needed to not get insecure. Sure, he was great at that.
Tony left lunch feeling like he just maybe gained a group of friends. Bucky and Steve walked with him to their math class. They sat on either side of him and Tony felt like he was signing his death warrant. The teacher was explaining something that he had obviously already mastered so he pulled out his notebook and worked more on blueprinting and the logistics of his holographic video chat system. He worked until he felt a tap on his shoulder.
Steve was a whole different story. Tony was besotted. In math when he tried to focus on his inventions, he could always feel Steve’s eyes burning into him. The first-time Steve handed Tony a drawing he’d done of him, Tony thought he was going to die. He knew his face had lit up with a blush just as bright as Steve’s. Steve was just so genuinely sweet. He was earnest with everything he said, and he frequently gave comforting touches without even thinking about it. The part of his personality that really got Tony wasn’t his sweetness though. Steve was a spitfire. Bucky said it was because Steve used to be small and got picked on. As dorky and awkward as Steve was, he was always ready to fight any kind of injustice. Anytime Tony snarked at him, Steve would give a little grin before delivering an equally funny line with a deadpan tone of voice. He just always made Tony laugh. He was totally cool though. Didn’t like Steve at all. He was just a good ol’ friendy friend-o.
“We can’t talk about this here. Tony, can we go to your house? I imagine you’ll be safest there.” Natasha’s voice was barely concealing rage.
“My phone wouldn’t be making sound unless it was an emergency. Rhodey knows not to call during the school day unless something is wrong.” Tony explained. Tony watched as people rushed onto the quad. Shit. Class was over.
“Actually, I don’t know if that’s a great idea. I should probably get a ride from someone with a car. Natasha?” Tony asked desperately. The redhead nodded and climbed over the boys to get out of the booth.
They were finally holding hands! It was so much better than Tony had imagined. Steve’s hands were huge. Tony’s hand fit with his perfectly, and Steve rubbed small circles on his hand with his thumb. It was magical. Tony’s whole body felt warm.
“No. No, Steve. It’s not you.” He really didn’t want Steve to feel bad, but he didn’t know if he had it in him to comfort the other boy right now. Thinking about his scars had also brought up some uncomfortable thoughts of inadequacy. Tony imagined Steve in his swimsuit: golden blonde hair stuck to his face, his abs and perfect skin glistening in the sunlight, his blue eyes scrunched up in one of his fully body laughs. Tony then thought about himself: unruly curly hair sticking out everywhere, scarred chest heaving as he tried to take breaths, his eyes haunted and staring at something that wasn’t there. They didn’t belong together. Steve didn’t deserve to get saddled with someone as fucked up as he was.
His free period ended all too quickly, and Tony made his way to AP Chem. He hoped he had a decent lab partner or better yet no lab partner at all. Tony didn’t really play well with others in a working atmosphere. His hatred of being handed things stemmed from experiences in the lab with his father, and people working with him tended to resent his inability to hold things for them or be genuinely helpful. Tony inwardly groaned when there was only one seat left. He threw himself into his seat with a huff. For his part, his partner seemed to be equally distraught at being forced to work with someone else. The boy was adorable and Tony couldn’t help but stare just a little bit.
Tony adjusted his glasses and frowned at his reflection. He hadn’t liked looking in the mirror since the incident. His hair was too long and it curled around his ears. His face had barely visible scars that weren’t there before. His eyes looked older and it bothered him. Everything about him had been off since the day of his abduction. He didn’t feel like himself anymore. Everything he used to enjoy felt foreign and his fragile social relationships had withered away until he only had two friends left. He buttoned up his shirt and tugged at the collar. He looked worse than he normally did, and he felt like he was looking at a stranger in the mirror. His normal band shirt and ripped jeans were replaced with a button up, glasses, and pressed pants. He looked like an idiot. He couldn’t wear tee shirts in public anymore anyway with the gruesome scars that decorated his tan skin.
“We found out who hired the terrorists. God, Tony, I’m so sorry.” Rhodey sounded like he was close to tears.
Tony froze his eyes widening in horror. Rhodey knew that look. If he didn’t resolve this quickly Tony was going to start crying.
“No. The boys will weep when they see us. Anything less is unacceptable.” Natasha counted with a smirk.
“Yeah man… I mean… shit, I’m already fucking it up. Also I am going to unapologetically hit on you because your ass in that dress is ten out of ten.” Clint said with a smirk and a wink in his direction. Tony threw his head back and laughed. Thor nodded his agreement.
“Yeah… no.” Steve responded before tossing Tony’s things at Bucky. He grabbed Tony by the shoulders and pushing him into a horizontal position with his head in Steve’s lap. He started to protest, but Steve shushed him. “You lost your speaking privileges by being stupid.”
The inside of the apartment was scattered with technological marvels as well as random tools. It didn’t look like a typical teenager’s space. Dummy rushed out from behind the kitchen island to check on Tony. He pressed his claw to Tony’s chest lightly.
“Surely you’re joking?” Thor asked before looking around at the other inhabitants of the room. Tony looked like death, Natasha looked homicidal, and Bruce looked close to vomiting. The rest of the group just looked confused.
Despite Bucky’s ribbing, Tony was ecstatic that he had a group of friends to hang out with. He had at least one of them in almost all of his classes. It was amazing. He felt like they really liked him for him. He certainly had been taken advantage of before, but all of his friends were so genuine. He felt happier than he’d been in a long time.
They looked at each other in awe like neither of them could believe that this was more than a dream.
“Bye, Honey Bear” Tony hit the end call button and tried to stay calm. He was still in public after all. He needed to get somewhere else. He couldn’t afford to lose it on the quad in front of the other students. He was supposed to be in class, but there was no way that was happening now. He tucked his pocket and walked to the bathroom on autopilot. He slammed the stall door closed and lowered himself onto the ground. A couple of tears were slipping out, but mostly, he just felt numb.
The class passed by quickly due to the fact that everything the teacher was saying went in one ear and out the other. Tony was busy developing a new kind of phone that would allow him to project a holographic video chat in real time. It shouldn’t be too hard for him. He could probably finish it that night if he pulled an all-nighter. He wasn’t going to be able to sleep anyway so why not?
Steve however still looked conflicted when he looked at Tony. Tony for his part really liked Steve, but he wasn’t going to initiate anything. He was having a hard time thinking about dating Steve while lying to him. Steve didn’t even know what he looked like without layers and layers of clothes covering him. It wasn’t fair to get his hopes up. Tony was a mess. He was also fully aware that if Steve knew who he was their relationship would end. Tony was related to one of the people Steve hated most in the world. He wouldn’t take advantage of Steve when he didn’t know what he was getting into. He wouldn’t.
“I don’t know… I kind of want to see more of these baby pictures.” Steve responded with a small smirk.
“Um… sure.” Tony responded. He sat his notebook on the table without thinking and started explaining the math problem to Steve in a way that he would understand it.
“I know. It’s just hard, Pep. I don’t mean to be an ass… look I’ll try okay. But I’m not exactly in an outfit conducive to wooing people.” Tony responded sounding a lot more tired than he did a few seconds ago.
“Breathe with me, Tony. In and Out. You’re doing so well.” Tony was snapped out of his daze by the other boy’s smooth voice. He was mortified at the fact that his almost new friend had seen him have a panic attack.
“Why? Did you get too overwhelmed with my ability to insult your best friend? Because if so, then yes.” Tony joked before Steve was giggling and leaning in again.
“S’not a big deal.” Tony mumbled. Rhodey rolled his eyes but didn’t comment. Considering his heart had been near shredded by shrapnel leaving his heart weak, it kind of was a big deal. Tony didn’t care what his brother thought. If his heart gave out than there would be nothing anyone could do for him. The doctor had basically told him as much when he got back from being kidnapped.
“Y-yeah. They figured out who it was. That ordered the hit.” Tony tried to go on but couldn’t. His voice caught in his throat. Natasha grabbed his hand, and Bruce bumped their shoulders together affectionately. Even though Bruce and he had never talked about it, he knew that Bruce knew his identity long before the others. After the water incident, Bruce was bound to be suspicious, and Bruce was a genius. A science genius. Even though normal people weren’t usually able to identify the Stark kid, someone who read scientific journals would. Tony knew from the way that Bruce barely contained laughs when Bucky ranted about his awesome HammerTech arm that Bruce was well aware of who his chemistry lab partner was. It was nice to have a silent partner.
“Steve, this is a very big deal. You just had a fight with Tony. You’re all scratched up, and so is he. We can’t bring him home today, his pack would kill us.”
“The Queen!” Gasped the collector, as he put a hand on his chest. Tony clasped a hand to his shoulder.
“It’s not like that,” he said defensively. “You left it in the conference room, I wasn’t stealing it to spite you or to keep as a stalker memento or something. Here, take it back.”
It was Thursday, which meant movie night at Avengers tower. Things were still tense from the events earlier that day. Normally Sam, Thor, Clint and Natasha shared the couch, while Steve and Tony squished together on the small love seat in the corner. Today as they sat down Tony nabbed Clint’s spot.
In a few weeks after the battle, Bucky had healed enough to get his stitches out, and was back to his human self. During his recovery Tony had worked nonstop to build him a new arm. It didn’t have the full function of his flesh and blood arm, but it was getting closer with every iteration. Tony claimed that one day he’d get it stronger and faster than any old meat arm. In a battle between Mother Nature and Tony, Steve was betting on Tony. Bucky had been out back having a rock skipping contest with Clint when they left to come here.
Tony paused to look at Steve, his eyes so blown he could hardly see a ring of blue, his hair sticking up, and his lips red and wet.
“To get a drink and food. It’s been hours and I’m not digging any more until I get something to eat.”
“Were not at your mansion anymore Stark, no one is going to wait on you hand and foot. Here, You don't work, you don't eat.”
Yinsen was going to be a doctor, he was going to save lives, and instead he died before he even made it out of highschool. And for what? Entertainment? To prove the same point that had been proven over and over for years?
He hadn’t realized how long he had been staring until a stylist offered him a hand to lead him on stage. They were all treating him like a wounded animal, speaking soft and low, every moment telegraphed to avoid startling him.
“Just because you don’t want your boyfriend’s ex hanging around too much doesn’t mean they wouldn’t be a good match.”
Steve started to unlace Tony’s boot, and carefully pulled it off his foot. “That’s normal. A bad sprain can last for a week, even if you ice it and stay off it. I’m sure hiking around the woods all day today didn’t do it any good.”
Over the next week Tony got the computer set up, and started working to develop his designs. He would sit at the table all day, and at nights when it was too dark to work on the ranch anymore, Steve would join him, sketching with his sweet sweet stolen bank pens.
Yinsen took a step back, his eyes wide. Tony held out a hand. “No, wait, I’ll do it. Alright? I’ll do it.”
Two peacekeepers stepped inside the elevator with him. When they arrived at the penthouse, more peacekeepers flanked the office door. It swung open to reveal Obie sitting at his desk like old times, like the last week hadn’t happened and Tony was being called in here for a light scolding because he was late on a design.
Christine laughed nervously and her eyes darted from him to the Peacekeepers standing in their white armor in the back of the room. When had they got here? Were they allowed on the stage?
He wiped away more of the water and felt frantic hope start to build inside his chest as he saw fiery red hair. That wasn’t any person, that was Natasha, he would bet his life on it, and according to the machine that Tony now realized was a heart rate monitor, she was alive. And that meant… Tony looked at the other four tubes. All the Avengers were here.
Steve settled down next to Tony, leaning against the wall. “It’s alright. There are worse fellas it could have been.”
He shoved Tony down into an overstuffed chair and looked him in the eyes. They didn’t have time for beating around the bush.
Clint straightened up from where he had been slumped against the wall. “Holy shit, are you serious? Hell yeah!”
Tony put on the gauntlet he had been working on, and flexed his fingers, the repulsor at the center glowing a familiar blue. “Don't worry about it, I always find a way to make it work.”
Stane leaned forward. “Last words? Feels fitting that I’m the one to hear them, I was there when you spoke your first words, you know. I’ve known you from beginning...”
On the screen Hammer gave them all a wide smile and finger guns. “Hello hello tributes! Congratulations on surviving the first day! I have wonderful news for you all… After the unfortunate loss of our last Game Master, my best friend Tony who will be dearly missed;”
“There’s no way you’re going to be able to walk.” Steve said, rubbing his face. With one of them immobile, it was going to be difficult to get water or travel around to try to find the others. They would also be trapped if they were found by another tribute not on their alliance. Tony was dreading running into Raza again.
“Come on, Jarvis. Cool kids get to school late.” Tony sassed flashing a smile at the stone-faced butler. Tony knew that on the inside Jarvis loved his sense of humor. There would be no reason to put up with him otherwise. No amount of money could convince people to stay with Tony for too long. He learned that lesson twice from the only romantic relationships he had ever been in. The girl was after his company secrets and the boy -who was kept a secret from the media- wanted Tony to finance his every whim. He took advantage of Tony’s giving nature and reaped the benefits for about three months before he couldn’t take hanging around Tony anymore. No one could stand being in a relationship with him. A tentative friendship was extremely rare. A relationship was impossible.
“So, does that mean you’re leaving?” Steve asked looking heartbroken. Tony wanted to reassure him and tell him he’d drawn the wrong conclusion, but he still couldn’t figure out how to move his mouth.
“That’s. Good.” Steve commented awkwardly. “I just. I don’t want to regret anything.” At that declaration, Steve made direct eye contact with Tony. He bumped his hand against Tony’s before intertwining their fingers together.
“Tony, what is going on?” Steve’s voice was soft in between everyone’s screeches. His eyes were huge, and they kept flicking around the apartment like any second he would wake up from this nightmare.
He left his car and walked awkwardly to the senior hall. Bruce wasn’t there, so he wasn’t sure what to do. He pulled out him notebook and started jotting down some thoughts about his new invention. He was startled out of his inventing daze by a cough. In front of him stood a stunning red head and her equally stunning blond companion. He blinked a couple of times to make sure he wasn’t hallucinating.
“Do you want to sit with me and my friends at lunch?” Bruce asked. He was giving Tony a soft sympathetic smile that made Tony feel slightly violated and uncomfortable. He thought about his answer. Bruce’s friends were probably cool, and it would give him the opportunity to make friends which he promised Pepper he would do. He was about to say yes when he was startled out of his thoughts by a laugh.
He watched his friends joking around for a bit before excusing himself to the bathroom. He was getting hot in all his layers, and he was slightly uncomfortable because he didn’t really know what they were referencing. Steve clearly liked it very warm in his house.
“I’ve missed you so much oh my god. You would not believe how lonely it is in the bed without you.” He wasn’t lying either. At MIT, they used to sleep in the same bed to try and keep Tony’s nightmares away. Tony had a lot more nightmare fuel now, and he missed his bed mate very much. It was horrible trying to go to sleep all by himself. Dummy tried to cuddle him as best he could, but there is only so much a robot can do. Tony (as much as he’d never admit it) was a cuddler, and he really needed human contact to be comfortable. He would manage though. He managed for all the years before he’d met Rhodey, and he’ll manage for however long he has to after.
“Come on Buck. We can do it. How hard can it be?” Tony directed his attention towards the second voice. Holy Shit. He changed his mind. Now he was done for. The boy had bright blue eyes and neat blond hair. He was just as ripped as his counterpart and looked like the epitome of an American sweetheart. Tony wanted a piece of that apple pie. Tony made an internal reminder to stab himself with a fork as soon as one became available. There were limits to how stupid Tony allowed his mind to get and that comment just crossed the line.
“Yeah come on Tony! You aren’t gonna pass up a chance to sleep with Steve, are you?” Bucky mocked with a smirk. Yeah, Tony knew that Bucky would catch his misunderstanding. Bucky had been subtly and not so subtly making fun of Tony for his attraction to Steve since their first interaction. Tony’s face flared impossibly redder, and Tony could hear the laughter of his new friends. He pretended like it didn’t grate on his insecurities. It almost worked.
“That math is nothing. Math and science are what I’m good at. Everything else… I don’t know I’ve never paid much attention to anything else.” Tony scratched the back of his neck and coughed. He smiled brighter than he had since the incident. “I can certainly kick Bruce’s butt.”
“Tony, what are you drinking?” He asked cautiously. He really hoped Tony wasn’t drinking alcohol during the school day. That would be a serious backslide.
Steve shifted his whole body, so he was facing Tony directly. He brought their joined hands to his chest, and Tony could feel Steve’s heartbeat racing. Was Steve… going to ask him out? What if he kissed him?
His friends had gotten over his weird behavior in the diner pretty easily. They knew about having bad days, so they didn’t judge Tony for one of his. Bucky didn’t even comment on it which Tony was shocked about. Bucky poked fun at everything, but he should have known that Bucky liked him enough not to push too hard. As much as he was an asshole, he was also sweet.
He had curly chocolate brown hair and big blue eyes. His purple button up hugged his body, and Tony was struck by how good the nerd looked. He was suddenly angry at his own failure to look cute in his nerd get up. He looked like an idiot five-year-old and this kid looked like a genius Adonis. Simply not fair.
Tony gave a mock gasp as he turned back to Jarvis, “You wound me, J. I’m cool in every form.” Jarvis made a noise of disbelief, which Tony ignored in favor of kneeling down to one of his bots. “Dummy loves me, don’t you boy?” Tony coaxed, petting the robot. The robot gave a whirl in agreement and Tony turned back to Jarvis with a smug expression on his face, “See.”
Rhodey woke up to the sound of whispering. The Avengers were standing in front of him with huge eyes. He suddenly realized the position he was in. The blanket except his head, which was pressed into Rhodey’s neck, covered most of Tony’s body and his heels were sitting on the floor.
“Hey, stop that. I came straight here.” Rhodey said with a roll of his eyes. They both knew that Rhodey always went to see Tony as soon as he got done with his missions.
When Natasha stopped talking and went back to screaming at the opposing team, Tony was forced to confront what had been weighing on him since he arrived. Literally. Tony was completed consumed by one of Steve’s jerseys.
“Yeah yeah love you too squirt.” Rhodey replied fondly. Rhodey didn’t know how long he sat there playing with Tony’s hair before he fell asleep himself.
“Yeah well… not everyone is a sugary sweet as you Honey Bear. I need them to respect me. I can’t. I can’t risk it. I need this team.”
Tony bit his lip as he grabbed his bag and climbed out of the car. He had been briefed about what high school was like from Rhodey. Apparently, it sucked. And Rhodey was a jock and popular! He assured Tony that life as a nerd would be much worse. High school was the one aspect of childhood that he wasn’t bitter about missing.
Tony sighed and stood up. He needed to confront his friends soon. Natasha had been telling him from the beginning that Tony should tell them. The addition of an active threat, and the fact that he could be leaving at any time meant that he needed to do it sooner rather than later. It wasn’t fair to lead Steve on without telling him. He needed to do it today, and besides… as much as he hated to admit it, he really needed to be comforted. His uncle tried to murder him. That wasn’t something that he wanted to deal with on his own.
“Nope, Baby girl you are ready for this. You shouldn’t have to hide who you are.” Tony’s face turned as red as it always did whenever anyone referred to him with a feminine nickname, but he made a small contented noise. Rhodey gave Tony a dazzling smile. Tony blushing bright red over being called pretty or baby girl was always so cute to see.
Tony pulled into the parking lot of the school. He hoped the school had a well-stocked science lab or he was going to pitch a fit. It physically pained him to waste so much time going to school when he could be a home inventing and working. Maria was convinced that the only way he would go undetected was to blend in, and a teenage recluse living alone and not going to school didn’t really constitute blending in. Someone would find him that way. They were looking for someone in hiding, not a high school kid.
“This is blasphemy. I thought we had something special. Steve! Rhodey’s being mean to me.” Tony pouted and looked back to his group of friends that were regarding him with amusement.
“What? I’m just worried about you. It was your first time, right?” Bucky’s eyes were opened unnaturally wide, and Tony’s squinted in response.
Steve <3: how was ur call with Rhodey? R u ok? The friend group is out by our tree in case u wanna come see us.
“Yeah. So?” Tony rolled his eyes before pulling a different thermos out of his bag and drinking some more.
“We found a ransom video in his server. It was of you. The terrorists were saying that they were going to keep you to make weapons instead of killing you. I’m so sorry, Tony.” Rhodey’s voice broke while he was talking. Tony felt terrible. Rhodey never got emotional like this.
Bruce laughed before turning and dragging Clint out of the room despite his many vocal protests. Steve looked like he swallowed a lemon and sulked away. Rhodey wondered what that was about, but was distracted when Natasha cleared her throat.
“Tony. Bruce is going to accept you no matter what just like you did with him. Clint might be an asshole, but he really likes you and I’ll smack him if he says something stupid. Thor isn’t around a lot, but I’m pretty sure Asgard doesn’t really do gender the same way we do anyways. Steve is too besotted with you to care about anything. I think if you showed up in a dress, Steve might spontaneously combust. So… what are you going to wear to the big reveal?”
The rest of the table was all watching them now. They seemed to be realizing that Tony wasn’t being normal. Tony crossed his arms. He really wasn’t in the mood to talk about things. He wanted to go home. He turned to follow Natasha out of the restaurant when Steve grabbed his wrist.
Tony grinned and walked into the history classroom. He spent the entire time thinking up more green nicknames to call Bruce when he next sees him. That class went by pretty quickly. Time flies when you are slacking off. That’s the motto Tony lives by, which is ironic because he works more than most people ever have.
He pressed his lips to Steve’s cheek for half a second before pulling away. The blonde’s face was bright red, and Tony smiled brightly.
“Tony. I was wondering if you would wear my jersey for the big game.” Steve’s face was light pink. Tony’s brain flashed with images of Steve kissing him while he was wearing his jersey. This was a romantic gesture, right? This could not be misconstrued.
“Hi! Are you the new kid? I’m Thor! I was new last year!” His voice was extremely loud, and Tony flinched. Nevertheless, he was glad that the new kid was friendly. He nodded with a small smile. He paled when he saw Clint and Natasha sit down right next to Thor. There was only one way this could get worse… and it happened. The two hot boys in math from the other day sat next to him. Thankfully, the blonde one was next to him and the brown haired one was beside the blonde one. Tony squeaked and shot backwards which put him low-key in Bruce’s lap.
Tony could totally see it. A face with an eyepatch. He searched the clouds for another recognizable shape. If Steve wanted to look at clouds then Tony would be the best damn cloud watcher the man had ever seen.
Tony on the other hand felt like his brain was short circuiting. Steve thought he was pretty. No way. He looked over at the boy to see if he could spot any signs of deception. Steve looked like he’d rather be jumping out of an airplane than having this conversation. His face was a bright red the spread to his ears and down his neck. People didn’t get this embarrassed when they were joking. Tony was shocked.
“Of course,” Phil grabbed the paper from his hands and read over his schedule. He took off without a warning directly into the sea of people. Tony closed his eyes and stumbled blindly forward. He tried not to squeak when he came in contact with a hard chest. He felt hands grab his shoulders and shove him to the ground. His glasses fell off and Tony opened his eyes desperately. The boy in front of him was blurry, and Tony was too terrified to move and grab his glasses.
Natasha didn’t try to talk to him on the ride to his apartment. She seemed to understand that he was having a hard time keeping it together. He just tapped his fingers against her dashboard nervously. He didn’t have it in him to try and start any sort of conversation. When he was getting out of her car, she seemed to falter. Her face twisted with an emotion that Tony had no chance trying to identify.
Tony shifted his gaze to the brown haired one who rolled his eyes, “I’m not gonna hurt you, shorty.” Tony scrunched up his nose in response but didn’t say anything. Tony sat there quiet until Bruce addressed him.
His uncle was the one that betrayed him. The man that comforted him after Howard yelled. The man who told Tony that he wasn’t worthless. That was the person responsible for his kidnapping. He tried to imagine it, but he couldn’t. His fear of water, his heart problems, his sleepless nights, his scars, they were all his uncle’s fault.
Steve hands cupped Tony’s face and their lips meet. Tony’s hands came up to clutch at Steve’s broad shoulders. They broke apart to breathe and Tony rested his head on Steve’s shoulder.
“I was trying to tell this idiot that engineering clearly isn’t the best form of science.” Bruce challenged with a smirk.
The next time they hung out outside of school, it was Friday night and for the first time ever Tony found himself at a high school football game. Natasha was sitting to his right waving a sign with Clint’s name on it. If Tony wasn’t staring right at it, he wouldn’t believe it was real. Natasha had one of Clint’s jerseys tied around her head like a bandana, and the sign was covered in sparkles. It even had a big picture of Clint printed out and pasted next to his name. He wondered whether Clint or Natasha made it. He suspected a collaboration.
Their second kiss was just as awesome as the first one. Except this time, they weren’t holding hands, so Tony was free to grip Steve’s shoulders for stability. Steve’s hands had found their way to Tony’s cheeks, and he was cradling his face like he was something precious. Tony couldn’t get over how gently Steve touched him. When they broke apart this time, Tony threw his arms around Steve and hugged him.
He had the painting hung up in his little apartment the minute he found the strength to exit Steve’s arms.
The two boys turned towards him at the same time with identical raised eyebrows. Tony’s eyes widened and then focused on his shoes. Maybe they wouldn’t kill him if he apologized. He risked another glance and saw the two reading over the paper. They both looked at him again. Tony’s mouth fell open when the blond one shot him a mouthwatering grin before looking back at the paper. Tony blinked slowly as his entire face began to heat up with a blush. Shit. He locked eyes with the brown haired one who clearly noticed his embarrassing state. He smirked at Tony before looking back at his desk. Alright, not good. The brown haired one was probably going to kill him. But was it worth it to see that smile directed at him? Probably.
Their shaky friendship was solidified by the maniacal glint in both of their eyes as they stared at the chemicals on their desk. Without speaking they began to work in tandem, both purposefully screwing up the ratio of chemicals in order to get a huge explosion. It was an ‘innocent’ enough mistake, and Tony was positive that Bruce had the innocent act down. All he had to do was look down, polish his glasses, and everyone watching was a goner. Tony would have to get him to teach him that trick sometime. He wasn’t adept enough with his glasses to pull it off. He just looked like a confused asshole.
Tony had only ever told three people about his secret. His aunt Peggy, Rhodey and Pepper were the only ones he trusted enough. They all took it amazingly, and Tony cried without fail each time. Now it was second nature for all of them. Peggy of course was much to old now to hang out and do Tony’s nails, but she would periodically send him cute jewelry and makeup in the mail. Rhodey and Pepper however had a strict strategy for making sure Tony didn’t feel ashamed of himself. They went shopping together all the time; Pepper was in charge of helping Tony pick out clothes, and Rhodey was responsible for telling Tony he looked ridiculously hot and bantering with Tony when he got self conscious.
Their football team had won. Tony wasn’t entirely sure about the rules of football considering he’d never seen the game be played before, but Bruce informed him that Thor, Steve, and Bucky had managed to secure the win for the whole team. Tony was mostly focused on absolutely not watching the way Steve ran around. He was the captain for goodness sake! Tony could not be more cliché. He was literally crushing on the captain of the football team. Rhodey was going to lose it.
Tony made a strangled noise at the thought before using his free hand to run through Steve’s hair. He’d always wanted to touch it but never got the opportunity. It was even softer than he’d thought it’d be. It was thin but soft. Steve grinned at him. It was so boyish and innocent. Tony felt like he’d been punched in the stomach. He gripped the other boy’s neck for support. This was more than he could have ever imagined. Steve pressed their foreheads together.
“It’s okay. I freaked out when I got bullied for the first time. I think I cried for a solid three hours.” Tony stared at the other boy incredulously, but his face seemed sincere. “Classes are starting soon. We should probably get going. Do you want me to walk you to your history class?” Bruce asked.
“I think you should consider telling them at your birthday. It’ll be a party with only them. You can wear one of your elegant dresses with that lipstick I know you love. Natasha is going to be there to support you and so will Pepper and I. I think that’s the best time, and I know you miss casually dressing up at home.” Rhodey prompted softly.
“Not even a little bit.” Tony shot back with a smile. Clint sputtered, and then stuck his tongue out.
“I told you I was a genius.” Tony said with a wink before closing his notebook and continuing to explain the problem to Steve “It probably won’t work outside of theory though. We have a long road before we reach that kind of tech.” he lied. He couldn’t let on to the fact that he only worked in holograms at home and would probably invent a holographic video system in a couple of days. He couldn’t draw any attention to himself beyond ordinary. If he got found out as Tony Stark, he would have to get sent away again.
Tony was ecstatic to find out that he was allowed to have contact with his best and only two friends. No one knew about Rhodey because the media was more interested in his inventions than his personal life during his time at MIT. Pepper as an extension was also excluded from the media’s attention. It helped that almost all encounters with Pepper that the media caught were arguments. The media wrongly assumed that she was a jilted lover and didn’t even bother to run the story. Tony Stark the obnoxious hetero playboy was old news to anyone with a television set. No one considered that he entered MIT as a small innocent fifteen-year-old that had exactly zero people waiting in line to jump him. They assumed that the girls filtering out of Tony’s room (all Rhodey’s fault. He was like the entire campuses therapist. He was nice that way.) in various stages of undress, were Tony’s conquests.
“Welcome to Shield, Nerd.” Tony narrowed his eyes at the boy before realizing when he had in his hand. He had nowhere to run when the cup of water went crashing into his face. It was cold, shit. Shit. He was drowning. He couldn’t breathe, help someone help. He was cold and he couldn’t see anything. All he felt was the hand pressing on his neck keeping his face underwater. Help please. Help. He can’t breathe. Water in his lungs and eyes and nose and mouth. Help.
“P-p-please don’t beat me up. I was just trying to help. I-I I’m sorry.” Tony stuttered trying to get even a little farther away from the blonde boy.
“You have a heart condition!” Steve growled. Tony shrunk into Rhodey’s arms. Steve seemed to soften a little bit at the sight. “Tony what if something happened?”
“I don’t mean seduce them. And what are you wearing? Not like that!” Pepper exclaimed, “Happy just got here. I’ve got a date. Are you going to be okay?”
It all came to a head on a Monday. Tony had a free period and was laying underneath a big tree under the quad. He hummed to himself softly with his eyes closed. It wasn’t often he could turn his brain off like this. He loved it. All he was thinking about was the air brushing against his face, and the grass tickling his legs. He heard someone sit down next to him. He sat up wearily before realizing it was Steve.
“No… no, I-I have something to tell you.” Tony could feel his heart pumping in his chest. His eyes flashed to Steve’s. Steve looked concerned but his eyes kept flicking up and down Tony’s body. He felt his face heat up. “I’m uh gender fluid. Sometimes I like to wear dresses and makeup and I’m uh girl sometimes… I use male pronouns all the time, but um I’m a girl right now. I know it’s weird but I’ve always been this way and…”
“You’re an idiot, Tones. And I missed you too. Not as much as I missed Dummy though.” He returned with a cheeky wink.
Music was playing in the living room as they walked in. Tony was completely hidden by Rhodey’s body. Steve and Thor were drinking wine and laughing in the corner. Bruce and Clint were sitting on the couch looking at the four occupants who had just entered the room.
“You wanna call uncle Rhodey?” Tony asked with a smile. Dummy whirled in excited agreement and rolled forward until his wheels touched Tony’s knees. “Alright kiddo.” He responded with a laugh. He dialed Rhodey’s number.
“Wait I’ve got an even better one” Rhodey exclaimed before pulling another picture out of his wallet. Tony was probably about fourteen in the photo. His hair was sticking up in all directions from grease and the safety goggles that he been pushed onto his forehead. His face was covered in soot, and his expression was a perfect mix of shocked and fear. Tony knew that the fear came from the fact that Dummy was off camera holding a fire extinguisher at him. His baby bot loved that stupid fire extinguisher.
“What if he thinks? I’m a-a-a freak. He’s from the forties. I can’t… I really like him and maybe it’s better if I don’t come out tonight. It’s not that big of a deal. I can just go put a suit on and-” Tony stuttered.
“I’m Bruce Banner.” He said pleasantly. Not fair Tony thought bitterly. His voice was smooth and calm radiated off him. He didn’t stick his hand out to shake, and Tony was irrationally grateful for the small gesture that Bruce probably didn’t even notice. Tony had a strange feeling that the two were going to get along smashingly.
“The army is asking me to go ‘consult’ with one Anthony Stark again, so I am going to get to see you next week.”
The rest of their friends were already situated at a corner booth. They slid in the end, and Tony grabbed a French fry and shoved it in his mouth. He couldn’t say anything embarrassing about how much he wished Steve would go dancing with him if his mouth was full.
“So, we are trying to decide which movie to watch.” Steve said with a grin. Tony smiled for real this time. Debating was something he could definitely do. They ended up watching the new Star Trek movie. During the movie, he felt his phone buzzing and ignored it. It didn’t stop, so he excused himself to take the phone call.
As soon as Bucky pulled away, Steve was hugging him. Steve pressed a kiss to his forehead and promised in whispers that they would figure this out. Steve didn’t care that he was Tony Stark. Steve didn’t care that he was fucked up.
During his free period, he went and sat out by the field again. He pulled out his notebook and sketched blueprints for his project. Before he knew it, the period was over and he was on his way to chemistry. Bruce smiled when he saw him and it made him feel good. They spent the period chatting while they wrote their lab reports. They both finished early, so they ended up talking about which branch of science was the coolest. Tony agreed to come to lunch with Bruce but was incredibly awkward as he walked behind him. He was very grateful that Bruce appeared to be heading to one of the tables outside instead of a table in the crowded cafeteria. Tony sat down next to Bruce who had already grabbed food. Tony insisted that he didn’t need anything. He felt too sick with anxiety to eat anything anyway. Meeting new people made him anxious. What if one of them recognized him?
“Right.” He managed to make himself say before plastering a very fake smile on his face. Natasha was looking at him knowingly. She couldn’t possibly know. Could she? He narrowed his eyes at her but she just looked away.
“What do your parents do?” Steve asked eager to get into the conversation. Tony knew what he was supposed to say. It didn’t even feel like a lie.
“Snot is a perfectly respectable insult thank you very much.” Tony put his nose in the air and made a face.
Steve wasn’t like that. He wasn’t sharp edges or wandering hands. He wasn’t assumptions, and secret nights, and alcohol he never wanted to drink, and getting pushed into hundreds of surfaces that were never beds. Steve was the sun beating down at them. Steve was finding random things in the clouds, and smirking in front of his motorcycle, and laughing at Tony’s dumb jokes. Steve was warm blue eyes, and concerned expressions, and care. Steve was asking Tony if it was okay to do something as simple as kiss him. Steve was ASKING Tony if it was okay to KISS him!
Tony slipped on a pair of sweatpants and a band shirt before setting of to find Natasha. Natasha was lounging in the dining room, when Tony found her. She sent him a smile.
“I’ll buy you that cute crop and those heels you’ve been wanting.” Rhodey ran his hand through Tony’s hair. Tony sighed but closed his eyes obediently.
The rest of the week passed in a blur. He felt elated that he had a group of friends, but every time he hung out with them he felt a pang of longing for Pepper and Rhodey. He hoped they would be able to visit soon. Rhodey was in the military now and Pepper was interning for a big company. Tony was confident she would get a management position within the end of the month. That’s just how Pepper was.
Tony felt like he was flying. Sunset had never asked him if it was okay to kiss him. She’d always smirked and used her long nails position Tony however she wanted him. She’d been sharp edges. She took and took from him. He’d had given her anything she asked for, but she never did. She’d just smiled with too many teeth, held him with one hand, and stolen with the other. Tiberius had never asked him if it was okay to kiss him either. Tiberius had been under the popular impression that Tony was a slut. He’d groped Tony’s pockets for his wallet and never cared whether Tony wanted him to touch. He’d held Tony down and breathed smoke down his throat without a second thought. Tony would have given him anything, and Tiberius loved that. He’d taken Tony’s gifts one second, and torn apart his self-esteem the next.
He woke up with Natasha’s hands in his hair and his feet on Steve’s lap. Tony blinked his eyes open and saw Steve watching him with a fond expression. He felt his face heat up and hid his face in Natasha’s lap. That was so embarrassing. He could not have a crush on the most popular boy in school. Rhodey was going to have a fit.
Howard always laughed at him for treating Dummy like a living creature. He called Tony weak and sentimental. Tony always thought that it was ironic that Howard’s drive for his career and nothing else was what weakened him. Tony was getting closer to true AI every day, and Howard couldn’t even dream about that. So, who was the real winner? Tony that’s who.
Tony flinched a little bit before nodding. He led the group to his living room where everyone sat down.
“That’s so awesome Tony. I’m so happy for you.” Steve said, but it looked a bit like he was sucking on a lemon. Tony tried to figure out the reasoning behind the look, but he couldn’t. He tapped his fingers against his collarbone anxiously.
A couple months later, Tony was buttoning up his shirt in the mirror with a smile. Natasha was attempting to tame Bruce’s curls with a brush and a prayer. Bruce was dressed in a stunning black suit with a dark green button up. He was still slouching a little because Bruce didn’t love attention, but it was clear the formal wear was helping his self-esteem at least a little bit.
“He knows that you aren’t who you say you are. He thinks you’re an abused kid on the run. I just had a feeling that there was something more. Don’t worry Tony. You’re one of us now. We won’t abandon you.” Natasha smiled and Tony tried to make himself believe it. He knew better though. Everyone abandoned him but Rhodey and Pepper. He highly doubted that he’d get to keep an entire group of people.
Because Tony couldn’t resist Steve’s puppy eyes, there he was wearing a jersey about three sizes too big for him. He tugged on it a bit with his fingers. It was kind of comforting even if it slipped off his shoulder every once in a while, and he was wearing Steve’s clothes which was a dream he never thought he’d get to experience. He wondered if anyone thought he and Steve were dating. He blushed but couldn’t banish the small smile that appeared at the thought. It was a pleasant fantasy. If he and Steve were dating, Steve would probably tell him how good he looked in his jersey and then sweep him off his feet. Ugh, he had no chill. Steve just wanted to be friends, and he needed to respect that.
Tony looked at Steve’s eyes which were so much closer then they’d ever been before. God, he was so gorgeous.
Tony was completely relaxed and simultaneously so excited that his stomach was trying to turn inside out. He opened his mouth to say something when his butt started vibrating. That was quickly followed up by Rhodey’s ringtone. Tony and Steve scrambled to their feet, and Tony looked at him apologetically.
Bruce helped his nearly catatonic friend to the nearest bathroom and began to grab paper towels to clean him off. Tony’s face was deathly pale and Bruce was worried about the way Tony was sucking in breaths. He cleaned his face off and then grabbed Tony’s hand and placed it on his chest.
“This is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen.” Clint laughed and smacked Tony in the arm, “you really were a baby genius”
Tony couldn’t believe it. The same Bucky that he’d always been worried about secretly making fun of him had just given him the best speech he’d ever heard. He thought that was Steve’s job. He reached out and clung to Bucky’s worn leather jacket like it was the only thing keeping him from falling apart.
“Sure. I’m related to one of the biggest mass murderers in America. That certainly endears me to a lot of people.” Tony rolled him eyes and pressed his back against the wall. His heart throbbed, and he was once again hit with the desire of wanting to be home. He wanted to go back to MIT so bad. He wanted his brother, and he definitely did not want to be talking about Howard and his weapons business.
“Are you Tony Scott?” The blond boy asked. His arms were crossed and Tony could see his muscles. He really hoped he wasn’t going to get beat up. He nodded and pushed his glasses up on his face. The red head was squinting at him in a way that made him very uncomfortable.
“I’m Clint. This is Natasha. We’re Phil’s friends. He said he told you about us.” Clint’s sentences were clipped, and one of his eyebrows was raised. Tony was very nervous about these two. For some reason, they made his skin crawl. It felt like Natasha was looking right into his soul, and he didn’t like it at all. Clint moved his hand towards him, and Tony flinched. It was minuet but the two caught it easily. Immediately, Tony understood that Clint was just trying to shake his hand. He cursed himself for being so stupid. The two’s demeanor changed as soon as they saw him flinch. Clint’s eyes softened just a little bit, and Natasha offered him a little smile. Maybe they weren’t so bad after all.
“S’no big deal. Dealt with it before and I can deal with it again.” He mumbled. Of course, he hadn’t dealt with his best friend being deployed to the same place he was kidnapped. That was making him a little more stressed out.
Tony resolved to keep his hands to himself during the ride. That worked for the minute they were going slowly, but as soon as they hit the road, Tony’s arms wrapped around Steve’s waist in a death grip. Though Tony couldn’t hear anything over the sound of the wind, he could feel Steve laughing. He just wrapped his arms tighter in retaliation. The first thing Tony registered was that fact that Steve had really nice abs. He could feel them under his thin shirt, and wowie. To be fair, Tony thought every part of Steve was attractive but being this close to him was especially nice.
Steve burst in laughter, “Oh my god, he’s going to be the worst. I wonder if he’ll make more or less innuendos when we’re actually together.”
“Thor and I are going as best friends. Bucky is going with you because he was afraid you’d murder him if you said no. Clint is literally going with that junior named Phil who is meeting us at prom. And, Steve stares at Tony so much that I doubt Tony in any way could surprise him.” Bruce snarked back.
“Yeah, what the hell is Anthony Stark doing in a town like this?” Clint asked. Tony saw the hurt in his eyes. Fuck, his relationships were all going down in flames after this. Maybe Natasha would still talk to him.
Tony nodded slightly. He felt a shiver run down his body. He could feel the phantom rope burns against his wrists and almost let out a chocked sob. He was never going to be free from this. He’d known that his kidnapping was personal from the minute the terrorist leader said his name, but being targeted by the one member of his family that he trusted was… he didn’t know if he could ever come back from that. He couldn’t stop thinking about all the nice things his uncle did for him. He just wanted to be held in Rhodey’s arms, but with the recent developments Rhodey probably wouldn’t be free until well after Tony returned home.
“I, that came out wrong. You’re a really amazing person. I… like you. A lot. I know you have Rhodey, but-”
“Tony? Are you ok?” That was Steve? Oh, they had stopped. That made sense. He wondered how long Steve had been talking to him. He’d gotten a little lost in his own world.
Tony risked a desperate glance at Steve and Bucky. Bucky still looked upset. Steve was staring at Tony unflinchingly. Tony swallowed and then nodded.
Natasha led everyone to her minivan, and they all crammed in. Steve sat next to him, and he was worried that Steve was going to be mad, but he just held his hand. He clearly wanted to say something; he kept worrying at his bottom lip. Tony appreciated the silence.
“Hey, are you new? I’m Coulson, Phil Coulson. I’m a junior.” Tony grinned a little at the James Bond reference. This Phil seemed like a cool enough guy. Maybe he could help him find his way to his first class. Tony despite his genius was not very good about navigating new places.
“Stevie. This doesn’t make any sense. I’m going to flunk this course, I swear.” Tony glanced over. His eyes widened when he saw who was whispering. Holy Crap. He was done for. Death was coming. He was quite possibly one of the most gorgeous people he had ever laid eyes on. He had kind of long brown hair and Tony got a wonderful view of his muscled arm through his tight shirt. Tony ran his hand over his mouth just to make sure he wasn’t drooling unconsciously.
“You’re a puzzle, a contradiction. The first time I met you, you were just another uncaring bastard happy to send me off to my death. I didn’t expect to see you again after the interviews, let alone for you to end up in here with me. Then when we got separated at the cornucopia I thought that that was it again… what chance did a pampered Capital boy have of surviving alone in the woods?”
It was a small couch and Steve was a big guy, there wasn't a lot of extra room and even after Steve folded himself as small as he could onto his side of the cushions, they still would be touching. That wasn't a problem when he shared with Tony, who was more than willing to sit sideways with his legs in Steve's lap or his arm around his shoulders. Even if Clint had wanted to get that close to Steve, he was pretty sure Tony would kill him if he tried. Instead he stole a pillow from behind Thor (who was a huge pillow hog anyway) and sat on the floor. They all settled in to watch the movie. It was quiet for a few minutes, then they started laughing and joking like usual, and the morning was forgotten, except for Steve who sat alone in the love seat and single mindedly continued to eat popcorn by the fistful and ignore everyone else.
Thor leaned forward, earnestly saying, “My shield brothers and I would be honored to join you on your noble quest to save your kingdom.”
Steve laughed again and gave him a peck on the cheek as he went to the pantry himself to get the box. “This is why I love you, so funny.”
“Clint!” Steve yelled scandalized. “It’s not like that, okay? We’re barely not enemies! We’ve known each other for two days, I haven't thought about him that way.”
Tony tossed a piece of popcorn at Steve who grabbed it out of the air. “With reflexes like those? Their loss. And my gain. Where to next, Mr. Tour Guide?”
His friends gave him a concerned look but didn’t stop him as he left the dining hall and went back to his assigned room, his steps just slow enough that no one could accuse him of running. He shut the door and slid down the wall to the floor. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. Tony wasn’t supposed to be fine. Steve had spent so many years taking care of Tony, making sure he went to bed at a reasonable time by physically hauling him upstairs, making sure he ate by bringing food down to the lab, and a million other small things like reminding him to not forget his coat. Steve had always felt that Tony lived life so carelessly, and Steve was doing a great service helping him because otherwise he would fall apart.
“Welcome to the pack.” Steve said quietly. He meant welcome home. He meant, here is my family, here is my house, here is everything I’ve built, and everything I plan on building. I’m offering it all to you, and trusting you not to destroy it. Tony looked deep into his eyes, and seemed to get it. In the darkness of the hallway, everything felt small and quiet, like they were the only two people left in the whole world. Without thinking he put a hand on Tony's cheek, grounding himself, and Tony rested his on Steve’s chest, still wet from the pond.
No, no, no, Steve couldn’t die, not after all they had survived together. None of them should die, and not for something as worthless as Tony’s life and the minuscule chance that he could shut down a tradition that had been running strong for 74 years.
Steve worked the rest of the day with Clint and Jan, trying to finish up even long after the sun went down. When they finally trudged inside, the house was cold and dark. They washed up, and Jan made a simple dinner of canned pasta. As they sat at the table to eat, Tony came into the room. Steve didn't bother to turn around as he shoved food into his mouth. “Too good to help out and make dinner, huh?”
It flared brightly and Liberty jerked upright with a roar as power surgured. She stretched her wings to their full extent, filling the sky and casting Tony in blue as the light shown through them. She flapped, and the force of the wind blew Tony backward, knocking him down to a knee.
“Look, I’m declaring it null and void. Your first kiss is whatever you want it to be, ok?”  Tony insisted. His next thought was to offer to kiss Steve again and make it good enough that he’d want it to count. It felt important that Steve knew Tony could give him a good time, if he asked for it. But there were no cameras down here, so why would Steve want a thing like that?
“Do you wanna walk with us to English?” Natasha asked. Tony nodded and walked with the two. He noticed them having a silent conversation with their eyes. He assumed it was about him, so he turned his attention towards his feet. He missed his life before his kidnapping. He hated being away from his family. He wanted to be back at MIT blowing shit up while Rhodey yells at him, or trying to do weird gymnastic moves while Pepper videotapes. He wanted to be home.
He strolled into the front doors and his eyes widened at the sounds that assaulted him. Everyone was talking, laughs and jeers could be heard from all directions. Tony closed his eyes suddenly overstimulated. His captivity had gotten him so used to the utter lack of noise and visuals that he was still scared by touch and loud sounds when he didn’t know they were coming. After all, it had only really been about two weeks since he was rescued, and most of that time was spent in a hospital bed and (a useless) debriefing with the police. He hadn’t had anytime to try and work on his irrational fear of loud noises, and people touching him, and the sound and feel and sight of water. At least Anthony Stark had none of those fears. It was just another detail that would separate his two identities.
Tony obediently stood in front of the green sheet and repeated the lines from the teleprompter word for word. When he was done Obie sent him home with a slice of cake and a pat on the back.
They brought the milk inside where Jan was trying to casually interrogate Tony. Some people would call it harassment. Jan called it “Getting the deets” and was downright ruthless. Tony didn’t seem phased. Probably was used to worse, with a larger pack back home.
They fell into an awkward silence. Jan gave him a nudge, and he looked at her helplessly. What was he supposed to do? Hop on the table and burst into song? She shook her head at him, and he could tell she was thinking he was hopeless. He had never learned to do much in the way of small talk, since Tony was the first nonpack member to ever stay at their ranch. They had a couple of neighbors that would stop by to talk to his Ma, then they would be gone in an hour or to. He didn’t usually notice, since he was busy with chores or hanging out with Bucky. Bucky was the one who was smooth with girls. He was quick witted and charismatic and handsome. That's what all the old ladies said, ‘What a handsome boy’. Neither of them took any note of it until the girls their age started saying it too, whispering it behind their hands, their cheeks blushing pink. While their Ma would be inside the supermarket selling the milk and eggs, they would stand out front by the soda machine and all the other kids would gather around Bucky. He always had a wild story to wow them with, and when he got older he switched to charming the people at the local bar without a hitch. Steve didn't appreciate going to town the same way. He liked the ranch, he liked his pack. Outside, there were rules about what you could say or do around the normal humans. When he was eight, His Ma had banned him from the supermarket for a month after he got on all fours to sniff a kid. And he always found himself pushed towards the outside of the group. Nobody was ever mean. Bucky wouldn't have stood for that, and everyone wanted to impress Bucky. He just was there, standing in the back, lost in his daydreams while everyone else fought to be the center of attention. His Ma told him he'd grow out of it, and he had never figured out exactly what he was supposed to grow out of. Ten years after their first visit to town, people were still drawn to Bucky's aura of danger and mystery, and Steve was still the kid brother they all tolerated because it made Bucky happy and Steve never caused any trouble anyways.
Tony remembered how much heat Steve was putting off last time he checked his temperature and kept his thoughts about that to himself. Perhaps Steve was being muddled by his fever. He should be in bed under ten blankets, not running around in the woods, but without his help Tony would have have been able to find the dragon, or find the courage to treat it.
He slammed his laptop shut. What did it mean? It was going to bother him until he figured it out. Rhodey wouldn’t know. He couldn’t ask Obie without admitting to hacking the footage. If he wanted to know what it meant, he had to go straight to the source... Steve Rogers.
“You thought I was a bastard, huh? Don’t worry, you aren’t the first, there’s lots of people back home who would agree.”
Tony wiped his hands on a rag and shook his head. “Don’t thank me yet, I have no medicine and either of you could still succumb to infection.”
“Thank you.” Tony whispered, and leaned up. He gently pressed his lips to Steve’s, soft and sweet. As quick as he started he broke off the kiss and brushed past him down the hall. Steve slowly brought a hand to his lips.
In this chapter, they go into town and Tony meets an old friend. Steve goes to the bank to cash his check. Neither of those things go well.
“That is true for many here, and yet we still listen for your command. We all missed the rot festering under our very noses inside the castle. Loki is sly beyond the means of normal men, and it is no sin to assume the best of others.”
Closed, opened. He thought about yesterday. He closed his hand tightly around his bruised knuckles, until they ached hot and tender and all he could think about or feel was that one sharp point of pain. He returned his mind to blankness.
“This is probably why you're the team leader. You do you, but I'm going to start team bonding next birthday.” He got up and wandered out of the room. Steve sat on a desk and starting trying to think of a gift idea.
“I’m not being prissy, I’m just saying that you if you don’t set clear expectations, I don’t know what you want. You’re a closed book, I never have any idea what’s going on with you. One minute you’re sending me to bed without dinner like a misbehaving pup, then the next morning you’re literally cheering my name. Now you’re back to all angry and quiet. It’s a fucking roller coaster and I hate it.”
Steve grabbed his hands. “This has been building for years, Tony. All the districts are ready, we have weapons and plans and we’ve trained for this. Our only obstacle was getting past the perimeter defenses. This is it; the Capital falls today.”
A fake crowd roared and Tony sat up straighter in his chair. Was this it? Was this the actual interviews? Where was the crowd? In past years this event has always been with a live audience. Christine had said it was live, so what was going on?
“And you will make up for it by hurting Steven and locking him out of the bond? You purposefully shield yourself from him, and even now I feel you forcing me out. It does no good to separate the parts of the whole. Let him in, and we may all repair your mistakes together.”
“Well, I’m afraid that you’re still $300 short.” Stern said, leaning forward and looking at Tony with some concern. So when Tony sprung up, he tipped over backwards in his chair with a startled noise. Tony grabbed the check from the table and flipped it over, slamming it back down to reveal that they had more than enough. His voice was loud and obnoxious and arrogant and yet somehow Steve had never found him more charming.
He walked through the halls, checking every room one by one for his wayward fiancé. At the end of the hall he stopped. He hadn't been in any of the bed rooms. The room at the end of the hall had his suitcases, but no Tony. He went back to the kitchen, figuring he had missed him. He wasn't there either. Had he gone into one of the bedrooms in the boarded up section? Why would he do that? He went back through all of the open rooms and checked again, looking in closets and under beds. He wasn't there. He went to the empty side of the house. The boards were untouched. He looked outside, and the truck was still where they parked it last night, so he had to be somewhere in the house. He went back to the kitchen. “I can't find Tony.”
The notary nodded, and handed them both a pen. They signed their names on the marriage certificate, hands steady.
He wanted to know what technology the districts had access to. His first stop had been the public database library, which primly told him that the districts refused to use anything more advanced than a wood burning stove, which clearly wasn’t true. He needed to go directly to the source, and who better than the guy who had opinions on quantum computing?
“What do you need?” Cap asked, remaining unintimidated. As far as villains went, birds really weren't bad.
Did they really think they could stop him from seeing the picture by locking him out of the room? The whole Capital was covered in cameras, nothing went unseen.
“That’s my scent. You’ll be able to use it to track me when we’re running around tonight. Jan smells like honey and Clint smells like wood and flint. Now focus on how it felt to extend your senses, and keep stretching. That’s shifting feels like to me, like a good relaxing stretch.”
