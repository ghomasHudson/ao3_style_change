"Nice, Steve," Clint laughed as he entered the room. Bruce was right behind him, and they were both laden with shopping. "What will it look like when the pride of our nation, the personification of all virtues will be caught fucking hot seventeen?"
That Bruce Banner would spend his free afternoon in the laboratory was certain, as well as the fact that Tony would stay with him until O-fuck-it-is-already-so-late ?! That's why it was completely dark when Happy drove the young genius to his family estate.
"It is important that we have been looking for a suitable base for a long time. Because you will be one of us... your father proposed your mansion. I hope you understand our situation. It was too good an offer to reject."
"Will we get some candy?" asked a tall boy with fair hair and skin smeared with green paint and sequins, which were probably supposed to be lizard scales.
"Why?" he asked, and after a while he added in a more suspicious tone, narrowing his eyes. "Where's the catch?"
Funny, but if he had to do his father's work, he was old enough even when he was eight. Why did he suddenly need a parent now? After all, everything went great and nobody was hurt, right?
"Anthony, would you be so nice and show Clint the content of your suitcase?" Coulson asked before Tony could offend him for instead of saying "good morning".
He very quickly tracked Clint, who, shooting the monster-Banner with a bow, tried to lure him out of school so that Coulson could thoroughly search the laboratory. So they still didn't realize that their opponent and its victim were one and the same person.
Tony managed to avoid another awkward question only because they arrived at the door of Coulson's office (thank God for Coulson, once again). They knocked and went inside.
"Hey," Steve called irritatingly cheerfully when he was close enough not to have to raise his voice. It didn't change the fact that someone like him got the attention of everyone around him. "I am sorry about yesterday. It came out a bit ridiculous."
"Nothing serious," Banner said, and gave Tony a meaningful look. "Tony was just about to call Happy and ask him to take him home. Right, Tony?"
"Under control, director of Fury. Barton and Banner are unconscious and the school needs renovation. Besides that, there are no major losses."
Barely refraining from jumping, he went to the kitchen to celebrate his genius with sweet, crispy toast.
Dummy with his slightly wavering hand first gave a plate with toasts burned into gold to Rogers, and then another one to Tony, thus ending their quasi-conversation. Unfortunately, that was the truth. They had nothing to talk about. Wait, what did Pepper say? Sport, literature, art, Frank Sinatra...?
"Pep, the phrase "scholarship, technical department, military section" seems quite unambiguous" sighed the boy. "It's not like I'm not against it, but it looks like Headmaster Coulson imagined "gadgets" differently than Tony."
"Happy looked after them. They also had popcorn and my collection of Star Trek episodes. See? I'm responsible."
"Maybe Bruce should stay here?" Stark suggested. "You know, it will be easier to react when he starts to turn green again."
Stark didn't expect that thanks to his armor he would be able to pull out the lantern. Fortunately, he was. Banner was surprisingly fast for a huge, heavy monster, but he couldn't match Iron Man. Bending the lantern like it was made of plasticine, Tony wrapped it very strongly around his green friend. He knew that he didn't have much time, because the beast was able to tear much stronger things than the lantern, so as soon as he shouted something that sounded like:
"I still have work to do in the workshop," Tony said and gathered all his strength to give them an apologetic smile and run away.
"Couldn't you ask him to introduce us earlier?" Tony cursed at the thought of how many problems it would have saved them.
"Why do you always twist everything around?" groaned Barton. "You are the first person who just decided to cross him out. Why don't you even want to try to be his friend?"
"My superiors approved the prototypes you left me yesterday," Phil confessed, it was a top-class compliment in his mouth. "One particularly appealed to them," in support of his words, he pulled a stack of documents from the drawer and handed them to Stark. The boy quickly recognized his own notes and corrections made to them. He didn't really like anyone else's notes on his work, but some of them seemed... intriguing.
Stark paid no attention to their quarrels, especially this particular one, which had lasted for almost a year. This is exactly from the day Tony was admitted to a world-class government educational institution, called SHIELD for some reason. Of course, it had to be an acronym, but it was apparently too secretive and confidential to be revealed to the average student, and Tony had not yet managed to figure it out (or, more humiliating, steal from the headmaster's computer).
Rogers slipped cautiously into the laboratory. It was obvious from his behavior that such a workplace was definitely not his fairy tale, and yet he was not overwhelmed by the enormity of test tubes, microscopes, spectrophotometers, and other devices also as friendly to the average person. He smiled at the sight of Tony and opened his mouth to say something when he saw Banner's grim expression.
Her boss didn't know either. It was all about his safe. Shit, a super-secret safe hidden in his private study next to the bedroom. A safe he wasn't afraid to joke about in public because he had programmed its lock himself and secured it with several passwords and a biometric code. Not only that, he changed all passwords every few days, and usually Pepper came up with one of them to absolutely exclude the option that someone would manage to break them. After all, it was not about money and jewelry, but about the unapproved projects of Stark Industries. Â Those that were discontinued when the company switched production from weapons to ecological energy sources. Tony Stark may have behaved imprudently, but he took his safe extremely seriously. There was no chance that anyone...
"Bingo!" Bruce admitted happily. "And it so happens that he will come here soon. You probably already had the opportunity to see him. His name is Steve Rogers, tall, blond, rather handsome... Tony? All right? You are so pale."
"Thanks, Phil! I always knew you were a really nice guy!" Tony shouted and fled the office before Coulson could scream at him.
"What for?" Tony snorted. He had had enough of this. It's not his fault that the relationship between him and Rogers was so awkward. "To even more often admire how incredible is his relationship with my father?
"It all depends on whether you're a villain," Steve replied in a worryingly warm voice. Damn, Tony clearly felt something melting inside him.
"I promised Bruce I would go see him," he lied and walked away quickly enough that they wouldn't follow him, and slow enough that it didn't look like an escape.
"Sorry, Stark," Clint croaked as soon as he caught his breath. "I misjudged you. You are quite neat."
He had to run away from them. From them and their compassion. They were his best friends, the only friends except for Banner and Jarvis, so he had to protect them from his pain. Once again he tried to smile:
Stark eyed the blush that crawled on Rogers' cheeks. He couldn't answer it. "Indeed, it turned out ridiculous. I wanted to sleep with you and you chose my father." Embarrassing. He just nodded his head as a sign of accepting an apology.
"Happy will be here soon," Tony said finally, finishing the call. "He wondered for a moment if he should come by helicopter, but fortunately, he remembered he didn't have a pilot license."
Exactly. Idiocy. He really thought so. But he decided to take a look at the intercom before he sent the brats away with nothing. Very brutally and soullessly. Not that he wanted to appreciate their creativity. No. Well, maybe a little bit. Since he was a kid barely able to tie shoelaces (damn shoelaces, he always preferred Velcro), he was obsessed with guys in skintight costumes. Actually, he still liked them, but fortunately, he wasn't stupid enough to admit his weakness.
The Star Trek marathon, which they agreed to watch earlier, was to be broadcast on television. Suddenly, however, it turned out that Tasha had to take care of shopping, and Bruce and Clint desperately want to help her. The effect was that only Tony and Steve remained at the screening.
"Anthony, a quarter of the school is in ruins. One lantern more or less really doesn't make much difference to me now. Just stop him."
It didn't bother Tony that, with his mouth open, he was devouring someone with his eyes, though that expression certainly was humiliating for someone with his social status. Right now it was enough for him to look. Look at the golden hair in which the rays of the sun play, at the perfectly blue eyes, calm as a cloudless sky, at wide strong shoulders, slender waist, long legs...
Banner at first glance seemed much happier to him than usual, which also made Tony feel better. At least fate was smiling at one of them.
Tony nodded and quickly said goodbye to Pepper and Rhodey. Accordingly to his speculations, Steve and Natalie stood nearby, but they didn't follow them, and they limited themselves to close observation. Seeing that Tony was looking in his direction, the Rogers smiled shyly and waved to him, to which Stark replied with a restrained nod. He was slowly getting used to the idea that his new crush was absolutely beyond his reach and he wasn't going to delude himself that it was not the truth. This was a very good direction for the development of his feelings. And it was seemingly the least painful.
Only after crossing almost the entire length of the corridor did he realize that Barton was running after him. They stopped, looked at each other, then laughed. It took them a good few minutes to recover from it.
He holed up in his workshop, having the unpleasant feeling that those might be his last moments spent in it. Damn! He didn't plan it that way.
This Banner just couldn't stand. He pulled Tony to him and mercilessly began to ruffle his hair. Such a situation would not be anything new for them, but they had no audience ever before. Tony was absolutely certain that Steve was closely following all their words and gestures, he just didn't understand why. Was he going to report it to his father? Stark wondered how long it will take Steve to understand that mentioning Howard's only son was the worst foreplay possible.
"I haven't had the chance yet," Tony admitted truthfully. He nodded at them. He knew they were dangerous, and they knew he knew. For the three of them, such a beginning of acquaintance was quite enough, unfortunately, Steve decided to make a more detailed presentation, at least when it came to the young genius:
"Hey, Stark," Clint called so close that Tony began to wonder how much of their conversation he could have heard (and how much he would be able to repeat to somebody else). "Coulson asked me to bring you to his office. Apparently, you have a package for him."
"Popcorn and Star Trek?" For a moment Tony was afraid that he turned the wrong street. After all, the kids at the time rather didn't like such movies. And even if, the date of production was usually enough to discourage them eventually.
"You can come in, Steve!" Bruce called. He really didn't know what was happening to Stark? And apparently, he also was a genius...
"Could you tell me why you don't like me so much?" Steve asked in his wonderful voice, taking advantage of one of the commercial interludes between the episodes.
"I love Star Trek!" shouted the girl in the sweatshirt strongly inspired by the American flag. "And you, Katy? Do you like it too? You like it, don't you?"
"I'd say it's rather good because I need your help," Bruce laughed. He set aside all notes and calculations, finding some space for their conversation. "I got involved in a project. A real project. Like real. Not some cheap experiments, but a PROJECT. Do you get it?"
It took Tony a while to understand that allusion. His thinking was definitely hampered by the fact that only one Steve's hand was on his hand. The other, however, began to stroke his back along the spine line, from the neck to the sacrum and back, simultaneously pulling him towards Rogers. That's why Tony realized that Steve shamelessly picked him up, only when he sat on Rogers' lap, and his wonderfully soft lips touched his own.
Maybe Bruce could understand it. It would be nice because Tony didn't quite understand all of that. He was never too comfortable in being in love, much less being in a relationship. It didn't mean he wasn't in any of them. On the contrary, he used to be quite often. So what, since every time he heard something like:
He almost shouted, surprised by the unexpected question. He looked at Pepper, who was standing by the marble counter and distrustfully watched the candies scattered around it. Tony frowned and quickly pushed the sweets away. Underneath was a handkerchief folded in four. Tony reached for it, unconsciously holding his breath.
He focused his attention on remembering Rogers's face, his blue eyes and golden hair. Damn, he was so kitschy that it hurt. And to think that Tony got caught up in it. He couldn't let it go, however. He had to get every detail out of the darks of his memory. They had no recordings, so the description was the only...
"Why? Did I say something wrong?" Steve's voice was full of strange sadness as if he was guided by the best intentions and didn't understand what he didn't succeed.
"Yeah. All in all, it was their mistake. They should've not left me a can of Coke, safety pins and a screwdriver. You can't even imagine how many possibilities such a set gives."
The kids didn't have to be told twice. They willingly ran after the round bodyguard and left their guardian at the mercy of the host. Rogers seemed somewhat worried. He frowned and gave Stark an examining glance.
"It's how he talks to you, how you talk to him... and when I saw you together for the first time, you..."
"It's Anthony Stark's new prototype," Coulson answered quickly before Tony could even open his mouth. Unfortunately, he managed to open the mask, so that everyone could admire how, with real terror on his face, he tries to come up with any logical answer.
All in all, he was very curious about Banner's test results, so maybe nothing will happen if he is stuck in his laboratory. It would be the best move. He would disappear from Rhodey's and Pepper's sight and would reduce the possibility that he would accidentally run into...
"Do you want to keep watching or do you prefer to go to my room?" Steve asked, leaning over him so low that they almost touched their noses.
He stopped at the door, took a deep breath, ran fingers through his hair, then took on a nonchalant pose, and opened.
"You just have to promise me one thing," Rogers began very seriously. Tony felt chills of excitement running down his back. He nodded slowly, fearing the answer and at the same time looking forward to it. "You mustn't stain or rip my costume."
"Come in, Anthony," Coulson called. Knowing his obsession with security, he followed Tony's path to his office on all possible cameras deployed throughout the school.
"Argue with me a little more, and myself I will make sure you get to bed." This threat did not have the intended effect, because after a while he added: "I already mentioned that it the same box is me hugging you to sleep and serious conversation with Pepper the next morning?"
The biometric panel was burned out, but skillfully enough that the rest of the lock was intact. Whoever did this, knew his stuff. And he apparently knew all the passwords. Probably, if it hadn't been for the damaged image, neither Pepper nor Tony would have noticed signs of burglary any time soon.
He heard the door open and quiet footsteps. He knew Rogers was behind him, but he didn't turn around. He felt no need. What could they say to each other?
Stark groaned and covered himself tightly with the sheets. He didn't feel like keeping in touch with reality, not at all. In his dreams, he was still with Steve, tangling his fingers in his golden hair, looking for his reflection in Steve's blue eyes. He felt so good, so warm, so sweet. When was the last time he made love with someone so intensely to be sore the day after? He didn't even remember. Oh well, wait, it was probably that one time with the whole team of figure skaters. Although it was only possible that he only dreamed about it. Or completely intoxicated by alcohol, he imagined everything. It was really hard for him now to...
"I just preferred you didn't like me right away than you liked me first and then hated me because of my father."
Barton decided to talk to Banner immediately to save himself from awkward situations. It turned out to be a bull's-eye, and even more. Despite all their differences, they simply discovered soul mates in each other. Although separately they were both quite nice, they changed beyond recognition when they were together, spreading anger, sadness, and sorrow in the unexpected ironic twist.
What kind of project was it? After all, Rhodey was on a military scholarship, and he absolutely didn't resemble any of them. Not to mention Steve, with his...
"Mr. Howard asked that you see him," Happy said happily, opening the door for Tony, first car's, then to the mansion.
The moment his armor identified the source of danger from the arrow, the stun-gun shot straight into Barton's hand and knocked him unconscious.
"Tommy!" the super-soldier groaned in horror and flushed with embarrassment. "Tommy, please, say you are sorry."
"No, no, no! Don't sir me. Tony Stark." Tony reflexively reached out his hand, realizing too late that she was still oiled and smelling of sandalwood. Damn, if that...
What would he say to him? "Gladly, but first you should know I'm only seventeen"? He didn't have any real experience in relationships, he couldn't even talk about such things. That's why he has never...
Tony sat down immediately and looked at his favorite assistant with unconscious eyes. Pepper Potts was a really amazing woman and none of his previous assistants had reached her level of awesomeness. Neither one of them was able to win Tony's friendship, much less permission to enter his house at any time of day or night. Stark knew she wasn't kidding. She was clearly worried, her pupils were dilated, her hands were shaking, her breathing was quick. She clearly had no idea what else she should say.
"Mr. Stark has his own popcorn machine, just like in a cinema. You will be able to make as much as you want."
He tucked the bag over his shoulder, taking comfort from the sheer weight of his genius, and knocked on the door.
"That's more than I have hoped for," whispered Steve. Something in his voice made Tony think, that he was about to cry from relief and joy.
"Steeevee! Can you come to my office?" Howard called at that moment, without even going back into the kitchen.
Anything. Let anything happen that will save him from this nightmare. He won't really be mad. Not at all.
"Of course not, Anthony," Coulson denied in an act of courtesy. "If you want, you can go now. I wish you a nice time working on new projects."
He knew that the relationship with Steve would look completely different. He had no reason for that certainty, and yet he simply knew. It didn't change the fact that Steve was painfully out of reach.
"Tony, start expressing more clearly." Rogers sighed. "I'm trying to understand what you mean, but your answers don't help me at all. What hurts you? That I could be with your father? Why would that hurt you?"
It was then that Coulson saw him and fired a very accurate warning shot just above his right ear, then demanded that Tony went down to the ground and lie face down.
"Director Fury, we have a serious problem," Coulson's voice sounded even more somber than usual. In the background, something could be heard between the wild yelling and screaming, the sounds of shots and demolished buildings. "Some green monster broke into the school grounds and completely destroyed Banner's laboratory. Hawkeye tries to stop him, but no type of arrow can hurt that beast much. On the contrary, he is getting more and more enraged with each passing minute, and we can't find Banner anywhere. We need support."
"What do you mean?" asked the eldest boy in a blue-red suit with a large spider and with glasses a little too big.
And indeed there was a green monster. The worst thing was that, as predicted, Tony identified his friend in the monster.
Happy looked at his boss uncertainly. Anxiety was in his eyes; he probably already guessed what Tony planned and with all his good heart he strongly condemned it, but on the other hand, the prospect of stuffing yourself with popcorn (despite the diet!) together with the disguised kids must have looked extremely tempting.
It's all because of this damn project. Only how did Bruce get irradiated? Was he going to use himself as a lab animal? He had mice and rats at his disposal. Maybe the serum was only compatible with the human body? Perhaps in the case of any other species, it caused such a strong immune response that it ended in the death of the test object?
"How do you do that?" asked Clint. Tony looked at him clueless. "How can you be... You know. Rogers-proof."
Tony pulled away from Rogers so he could look him in the eye. Steve used this to lie back, pulled young Stark back and let him put his head on his shoulder.
Coulson sat on his black armchair behind the mahogany table and gave Tony a polite but patronizing smile. What he will want to force him to do this time?
Steve turned abruptly and looked at Tony in horror. Stark wanted to run away. He didn't even find enough courage to at least look at Rogers. He felt his face begin to burn in shame under the pressure of those wonderful blue eyes.
Stark, not caring for anything, rushed to open. Damn, he didn't remember calling someone for the night. Maybe it was a gift from Pepper? Tony didn't suspect Rhodey of such kindness, though, who knows. Or was it the deity of mechatronics and quantum physics that finally decided to look at Tony with a kinder eye?
Coulson's office, as usual, radiated with stiffness. This time, however, Tony gratefully hid inside. Even if it meant exposing himself to the headmaster's embarrassing questions.
Tony probably would not notice too many of the changes that took place in his life (or rather at his house), if not for the fact that, unfortunately, came the time of Christmas holidays, which meant few weeks off from school. He couldn't even count on the support of Rhodey and Pepper because they both went abroad with their parents. Lucky. He would also like to go as far as possible, but he was afraid to leave his home in the hands of this band of weirdos who proudly called themselves "The Avengers".
That's why the first thing that struck the boy was the light in his father's office. Howard Stark was at home. Or rather: in this "hotel" in which he rarely visited and his son lived in permanently.
The man turned out to be even more appetizing, which was why Tony very reluctantly looked away from him. If there was any deity of mechatronics and quantum physics, it was an extremely freakish deity and it definitely didn't deserve Stark to pray to it. Not that he would pray to anyone or anything, but if he ever felt like it, he would definitely choose a more sympathetic heavenly being.
"Our Banner?" Fury looked doubtfully at the battered, naked Bruce lying in the cocoon of the broken lantern. It was a rhetorical question, however, and Fury shifted his gaze to Tony without waiting for an answer. "What kind of armor is this?"
"Such an attempt on my precious life?" Tony laughed involuntarily, letting everyone in. It did not escape his notice that Rogers took the opportunity to brush Stark's robe with his hand. No, it was no accident. Yes, he had wonderfully broad shoulders, but he could easily pass Tony at a safe distance. He didn't do it though. "And what will happen to me now? Who will stand up for me?"
He sighed in resignation and sat up. He was about to tell his friends that he was prepared for Coulson's anger and that he had already prepared several prototypes to tame his superiors. That's when his eyes fell on him.
They couldn't become friends. At that moment Tony already knew he loved him too much to be just his friend.
Tony had no idea if he wanted to scream at Happy for interrupting the conversation at the most emotional moment or kiss him for coming to the rescue. Nothing prevented him from passing responsibility on his bodyguard, ask him to look after children so that Tony could do something much more pleasant.
Tony could feel the heat pulsing perfectly through the thin material, so he didn't have to ask what Steve meant. He didn't answer him; instead, he began to rub against him. Steve immediately understood his intention and began to help him. Their bodies began to tremble slightly and vibrate, and then pressed on in a rush of pleasure.
Tony smiled broadly. He knew he was handsome. He knew that many men wanted him, regardless of their sexual orientation. And yet he felt extremely insecure with the sweet soldier. It was as if Steve undressed him with his eyes only, carefully analyzed his sex appeal, contemplated the complexes hidden under his skin. Stark swallowed nervously. The silence lengthened so much that he began to expect a refusal.
"Jarvis, does Coulson carry a walkie-talkie or anything?" Tony asked, avoiding bricks flying towards him at terrifying speed. "Can you catch its frequency?"
Tony knew he had hurt him. He saw it on Steve's wonderfully honest face. It was better that way. Stark preferred to hurt him now and draw a clear boundary between them than to give him the false conviction that they could become friends.
The office, which always overwhelmed him, because it resembled his father's office so much. Sorely classical, old-fashioned, dark, full of wooden decorative furniture, royal red, and gold of all kinds of decorations and awards.
The bathroom, like most things in his home, was large. Marbles, top-class wood, Chinese silks, gold, and mother-of-pearl decorations surrounded him from all sides. And above all space. His father once told him that it was crucial to leave enough space for his thoughts. Howard Stark understood this very literally and kept not only other people at bay but also the whole reality, constantly chasing the future. Tony didn't like that order. It's terrible to feel like a stranger in your own home. If only he could move permanently to Rhodey!
"Sure, boss," he finally agreed, but his face was sour. "Come on, little ones. You will see the largest salon in the city in a moment."
"I brought you a full tank of fuel, so I'm afraid it's rather the first one," Stark replied, handing him coffee. "Is there something wrong with it?"
"Shit," Tony moaned. He buried his face in his hands and wiped away the last seeds of sleep. "I let in trick-or-treaters yesterday."
As if that wasn't enough, Steve up close (and half-naked) was even more radiant. It was as if he was created to worship and admire. And actually, that would be enough for Tony. Absolutely pure platonic love, nothing more. There was no chance for it now. How could he watch Steve's happiness from the shadow, knowing that his own father was the one who made him happy?
The sexy soldier didn't come alone. A flock of kids armed with candy bags crowded around his legs. Tony mentally prepared himself to beg for a trick, and now he couldn't say a word.
He must have been honest right now of all moments. He saw hope die in children's bright eyes and heard their disappointed sighs. Unfortunately, that was the truth. He didn't have a single candy at home. Even the sugar cubes were banned, he left only a stevia sweetener, but he couldn't suggest it to the kids. All because of Happy's diet. Tony decided that he would be a good friend and give up all sweets not to provoke his bodyguard. And now they both tricked themselves. Of course, Tony felt it much more, because the subtle pulsing in his crotch began to die painfully, when the wonderful soldier smiled apologetically and withdrew a few small steps, dragging sad children behind him.
Tony returned home and went to bed immediately. Both Happy and Jarvis were deeply concerned about his behavior, and especially about how stubbornly he tried to put up a brave face. He hated to hurt his loved ones, but he couldn't help it. He suffered too much, and his suffering spilled out of him like... like foam from a jacuzzi tub, into which someone had poured too much water and bath bubbles.
Stark was speechless. Well... it did explain a lot. Certainly most of what happened. Why didn't he come up with it himself? Why did he immediately suspect the worst? It was his father's fault. If it wasn't for his promiscuous social life, Tony would never have thought of that.
"Do you realize how long I can't stop thinking about you?" Steve gasped, stroking Tony's cheek with his thumb.
The man in the uniform converted into a superhero suit shook Tony's hand without hesitation. Although his answer seemed only a polite response, a wide smile suggested something completely different. As if in some magical way Stark managed to break the ice. He stood astonished for a moment, his hand drowning in the man's strong fingers, not knowing exactly what to do next. He has never managed to win anyone so easily (unless he has paid ahead).
Wonderful, simply wonderful. The sweet soldier didn't even know how much he just made police work easier.
Tony frowned, not quite understanding what his friend meant. It took him a moment to realize that this young god was not alone. He was followed by the most unpleasant duo that Stark ever saw. It was not that they were ugly; on the contrary, they were quite attractive. There was just something murderous about them, both in the girl with fiery hair and in the boy with the eyes of the bird of prey.
Bruce pulled away quickly from Tony and looked at him with barely repressed concern. Why did all his friends care so much about this kidnapping? It was as if they were assuming that it was the source of some trauma or something... Ok, maybe they were right a little bit. Since that day Tony was constantly improving his armor, but it's probably nothing strange, after all, he was a genius!
âJARVIS,â Tony prompted, and the flatscreen flickered to life, revealing footage of a smoldering office building in what looked like Washington D.C. Most of the action seemed to be over, but the lights of ambulances flahsed through the plaza. Tony scanned the foreground of the shot, and sure enough â
âThanks. Take care, Melinda,â Clint said. He walked toward Steve while May headed off after Fitz and Rumlow.
The adrenaline of the mission seemed to have loosened the communication between them, and Steve was trying not to feel too guilty about soaking in the sound of Tonyâs color commentary. It had only been when Tony had stopped speaking to him that Steve had realized how much he'd grown accustomed to the flow of Tonyâs talk. One night at the compound, when Steve had finally given up on sleep and decided to make himself some eggs in the kitchen, Tonyâs voice had come over the television. CNN was playing footage from a press conference in Zurich; and as Tony described a new self-sustaining generator, Steve had felt his jaw unclench, as if the sound of Tonyâs voice could send some signal to Steveâs body that his mind couldnât accept.
âThereâs no need,â Steve responded to cover his reaction, flexing the hand that had brushed Tonyâs as he let it fall back to his side. âWeâve got the schedule covered for now. I was actually hoping I could talk you into a snack break.â
Steve blinked against the edges starting to crowd his vision. Snapping the shield onto his back, he started swimming in the direction that Tony and Natasha had taken. The rig still seemed to be listing to one side, and Steve had to keep adjusting his stroke as he made his way down the corridor, around a corner, and then toward the stairs that Steve hoped still led to the landing pad.
He had just ducked under the water to retrieve his shield when he felt a second explosion rock through the walls, this time from above. Suddenly the orientation of the corridor was shifting, as if the whole rig had started to tilt to one side, and Steve felt his heart seize in panic.
Hypothetically, of course. Steve might have used words like those, but Tony wouldnât know; because only someone with a serious fixation issue would have
He turned away from the wood-burning stove to quirk an eyebrow at Steve, who was still burrowed under the blankets theyâd found in the closet.
âThe Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away,â Steve agreed, an almost imperceptible quirk appearing at the side of his mouth.
âDamage was contained to this floor, and the rest of the building is being evacuated,â JARVIS responded. âI have alerted Agent Barton, who was already on his way back to the Tower after receiving the code from SHIELD. Dr. Banner and Thor are en route from the lab. I believe that Dr. Banner is ââ
wasnât âconcernâ - which is what he was explaining patiently to Bruce while they mingled over cheap wine and cheaper crackers during the reception.
âIt was so obvious he wanted to say something, but he was holding himself back. Why?â Tony demanded, helping himself to one of the riper-looking melon chunks from Bruceâs plate. âThe guyâs probably got âMore of a Comment than a Questionâ tattooed on his ridiculously oversized biceps, but he just sits there in silence? Maybe
âWell youâll always have a room here,â Tony said. âThe whole team will. Thorâs off planet for the moment, obviously, taking care of whatever
âRhodey, I am offended. Are you implying that I am developing a crush on Captain America as a coping mechanism?â
âI was following up on a tip you gave me, actually,â Tony replied. âLast night? Before you got your mysterious phone call and climbed into a shady van with a bunch of Men-in-Black cosplayers? You asked me if I had come across any references to a shield.â
âYou were shivering on the last mission,â he said, and Steveâs fingers froze in place, still nestled in Tonyâs hair. âWhen we had to take out that HYDRA bunker outside of Mogilev, I noticed you couldnât stop shaking â even once we got back on the jet, you kept chafing your arms under the blanket. I know the cold probably reminds you of the wholeâ¦Capsicle thing, so I just thought if you had something in your uniform that you knew you could turn on. It couldnât get that hot without a risk of overheating you, but maybe just a sense of controlâ¦â
In the initial moments of disorientation, his body gave him few clues as to how long it had been since heâd arrived at the meeting place Hill arranged with HYDRA. Agent Sitwell had been the one sent to meet him, and he hadnât been happy that Steve had come without Fury. For a moment, Steve had thought the whole arrangement was going to fall apart right there, and he had started calculating how valuable Sitwell might be to HYDRA if he had to try to negotiate a new one.
âListen to me, Tony. I donât know how you heard that name, but you have to drop that thread immediately. Do you understand?â
âWell, see, letâs return to that,â Tony agreed, tracing the outline of Steveâs cheekbones with his thumbs. âThat information is very relevant to my interests. But I am going to have to insist on a medical exam first, Steve. Iâm not a young man, and if I have to watch you collapse for a third time today, someoneâs probably going to have to restart
âWith my phone charger and a butter knife,â Tony confirmed. âHad to get everyone else out of the hotel. But I didnât have time to get to the stairs before I got cornered. I had to climb out the bathroom window, and it seemed easier to go one story up than four stories down.â
"Alright. If you're sure." He turned back to his French press and started counting out scoops of delicious smelling coffee grounds. "So what brings you in on a snow day?"
So that was why, after two years of throwing wrenches in the Avengersâ Thanksgiving plans, Steve was determined to make sure that year three went off without a hitch. Heâd drawn up an elaborate plan for maximizing the utility of the Tower kitchenâs two ovens and seven burners and for optimizing the teamâs various culinary skills. The operatives had been briefed the night before, and by 10:30 AM on Thursday, Steve was fluting a pie crust, Bruce was stripping fresh thyme leaves into an herb blend, Clint was whipping up a roux for the mushroom gravy, Thor was mashing potatoes and parsnips in an industrial-strength metal vat, and Natasha was dicing carrots and celery with a speed and precision that felt vaguely unsettling.
âMaybe I could have used some of that advice, you know, on occasion,â Grant offered. âI think the Assistant Dean may have me on some kind of list.â
âMay.â Clintâs voice registered a momentary shock, and then Tony watched his face go eerily blank, like someone had shut a door behind his eyes. Tony glanced sideways at Steve, who seemed just as confused as he was by Clintâs reaction. But Natasha must have anticipated it, because she moved smoothly in front of him, trailing one hand lightly down Clintâs arm as she shifted positions. She returned Mayâs nod, which Tony could only imagine was some spy version of game recognizing game.
Tony must have misinterpreted the source of Steveâs furrowed brow, because as he plunged on, his voice sounded just a bit more strained.
âSee now that was two jokes in a row. Thatâs got to be some kind of personal record, right? You didnât even have to pause to regroup with a stern one-liner. I think thatâs a sign that Iâm having a good influence on you.â
âTony,â he called out as he walked through the front door. It was an unnecessary greeting: Tony was examining the portraits on the wall not ten feet away and had clearly seen Steve approaching. But Steve found himself wanting to confirm their proximity out loud.
Steve drew his gun and stepped softly toward the cracked door. As he crossed into the room, he found himself on a walkway overlooking a library. The room showed some of the signs of the houseâs disuse. Sheets had been thrown over the smaller tables and chairs, and cobwebs clung to the candelabras on the fireplace mantle. But dozens of lamps set in double sconces were fully illuminated, throwing a soft light onto the mahogany bookshelves that lined the walls. Each shelf held rows of books, bound in matching sets with gold-embossed titles. A ladder connected the walkway to the floor below, which was partially covered by a network of overlapping Persian carpets.
Steveâs expression was still mortified, but there was something else creeping in as well â a set to his shoulders and jaw that Tony associated with phrases like âthere are still civilians in that buildingâ and âI want you to launch me through that third-floor window.â
âSorry to ruin the daring rescue, Cap.â Steve wrenched his head up to see that Rumlowâs grin had turned feral. âDid you forget about our little insurance policy?â
But something had changed in their fourth month working together, after theyâd gotten trapped in an Arctic research station with nothing but a possibly alien parasite, the team of scientists it was slowly driving mad, and their shared determination not to let anyone lock Steve in the freezer. Since then, Tony had shown Steve the files he was keeping on his fatherâs most classified work, âProject Rebirth.â And Steve had told Tony something heâd only admitted to one other living soul: that he, like the nameless subjects in Howard Starkâs notes, was missing time. Seventy-two hours sat like a blank in his memory, a yawning chasm between the day when he was hospitalized for severe pneumonia at nineteen and the day he emerged with an immune system that seemed coated in Teflon.
out?! Get yourself out, you bastard ââ Tony tried to interject, but Steve kept talking over him determinedly.
âHow did it even happen?â Tony asked. Irritation had leaked into his voice, but Natasha knew him well enough to know where it was really directed.
âYou wanted to be there,â Tony repeated, a note of skepticism turning the statement into a question.
âTony,â he said, âThatâs not what I mean. I mean Iâm sorry I didnât know sooner. Iâm sorry you suffered for it. Iâm sorry we wasted so much time.â
âThey didnât make any demands, Cap,â Tony replied, something pulling taut around the edges of his voice. âThey were just trying to wound us. Trying to get the Avengers to do something stupid.â
âI donât know. Maybe you grabbed them by mistake. Maybe you're psychologically incapable of not making everything into a massive ââ
âThereâs something I havenât tried,â Tony explained, âin terms of theâ¦life dreams thing. I didnât know it was on the table, but if it is, Iâd like to ââ
âItâs going to be okay, Tony,â Steve promised. âIâm going to tell them.â Tony shook his head violently, trying to shout something behind the tape that sounded suspiciously like, âshut up, you idiot,â but Steve pressed on. âI know where Fury is, and I can take you to him. But youâve got to let Tony go first. Let him go, and Iâll take you right to the Director. You have my word.â
âWe promised never to talk about that again,â Steve groaned, but Tony could see the corner of his lips tugging upward.
âWhat the fuck?â Tony muttered for the second time, and suddenly Grantâs cancelled classes seemed like they might actually be a big deal after all - just not for the reason Tony had imagined.
âDonât say I never did anything nice for you, Tony,â Natasha called after him as he scurried out of the room.
âI woke up in a hospital three days later and found out I was getting a medal,â Steve finished, looking down at the notepad in his hand and making a conscious effort to release his grip on the edges of the page.
He pulled back so he could look into Tonyâs eyes and watch the rapid play of emotion across his face â always too fast to track.
? Tony had lost every bet heâd made with her since the days when Natalie Rushman was clearing his schedule for lunch at Carbone, and she had just abandoned her second-largest item of clothing to a pocket-nines bluff from Thor, God of Incurable Credulity? Not fucking likely.
"Ohh, thank you Dr. Stark!" Peter rummaged in his bag and came up with a folded wad of papers. He unfolded them and scribbled
âWell how do you explain this then?â Steve asked. âBecause when we were in the car, the house was completely dark.â
âJesus, Tony, you think thatâs how I feel? No one could have gotten there faster. I should have ââ Steve broke off and gripped the table again. Tony wasnât sure he even knew he was leaving dents in the metal. âI saw Harrisonâs nose was bleeding and I didnât think to check for an injection. Then he tried to tell me something in the warehouse â asked me to turn my comms off â and now I keep wondering: if I had heard what he was going to say, could I have saved him?â
âWe need to hit both facilities simultaneously so the terrorists donât have time to go to ground,â Fury explained. âSo the plan is to split into two teams. Captain Rogers, youâll take Iron Man, along with Agents May, Barton, and Rumlow, and execute a tactical strike in Jersey. Agent Romanov, youâll take Thor and Dr. Banner, along with Agent Ward, and infiltrate the office in Toronto. That location seems to be more heavily guarded, so Romanov and Ward will go in under cover, with the big guns standing in reserve.â
Heâd known he was in trouble for a while, of course. If it hadnât been clear the first time Tony raised the faceplate of his armor to reveal the kind of deep, expressive brown eyes that had always made Steve go weak at the knees, it was painfully apparent by the time those same eyes looked up at him from a rubble-strewn street in New York. But Steve had told himself he was going to tackle the situation head-on: ask Tony out on a date; use full sentences and appropriate eye contact; and do it while Tony was awake this time.
âAs soon as the movie is over, you pack your bags,â Tony agreed. âNow whereâs my ride to the couch?â
âThe two attacks must have been almost simultaneous,â she said grimly. âBut no word from Hill, or from anyone at H.Q., for over an hour. Whoever ordered the hits is doing something to slow down our response.â
getting roped into more service right now. This year Iâm saying ânoâ to everything that doesnât help get this book written, and Iâve got a hot date with manuscript A188.3 at 5:00 to prove it.â
âI know we said we werenât going to get each other anything for Christmas,â Tony said eventually, clearing his throat to dispel some of the tightness in his chest, âbut I do have this little thing.â He turned to the entryway table and pulled a raucously colored gift bag out of a lower cabinet.
Tony stared at the man, who was still just standing there, but apparently he had nothing else to say. He huffed out a frustrated little noise and turned and walked away.
âIâm afraid this one is going to leave a mark, Captain,â one of the HYDRA guards had leered at him on their last visit to his cell.
âWith so many material forces to choose from, why start with biography?â Tony continued. âWhy look at people? After all, the great-man theory of history is dead. Few mourn it, and those few I would not want to emulate. And yet here I am, writing a book organized around individuals. So what gives? One explanation is that I found my way into the subject of tonightâs talk by following a great woman: Peggy Carter, one of the highest-level agents at the SSR and an absolutely crack shot, by the way.â
âYouâve been shot,â he announced. âDo you think you could go one goddamn mission without getting shot?â
âThereâs nothing nice about what happened to you, Steve,â Tony said quickly, his face twisting. âPeople should be held accountable for that â not given a fucking pat on the back for saying sorry.â
âToo much?â Steve asked, wincing slightly. He started to pull his hand away from Tonyâs, but Tony grasped it tighter, pulling it toward his chest.
hear my father mentioned without threatening to beat a decorated war hero. And you must miss him sometimes. Tell you what. Because youâve had a rough day, Iâll give you a freebie: tell me something you preferred about him. Iâve heard them all before.â
âHey, you brought up Daddy â not me,â Clint smirked. âBut before you go â or try to, anyway â can I give you some advice?â
A small smile flickered at the corner of Dr. Grant's lips, and Tony wondered how many co-eds he'd gone through in grad school. The legs were still presenting a serious problem.
He broke off, and no painkiller in the world could touch what it felt like to see Steveâs last effort to hold himself together crumple.
The air around him was a haze of smoke and dust, and his eyes burned as he tried to clear his vision. He needed to get up, to try moving again, because someone had been calling his name.
Something flashed across Wardâs face for the slightest of seconds as he saw Natasha pocket the disk, and then it was gone.
âThose tubers had truly been abandoned by the gods,â Thor agreed solemnly. âBut I maintain that the Big Band Banana Pie was actually quite delicious.â
âSam asked me about retiring once,â Steve said slowly. âI couldnât picture it at all â didnât even know where to start. That bothered me for a while because I thought maybe I had lost myself in the fight. But now I think itâs because I found myself there. I couldnât build a home in D.C. or Brooklyn because I already had one. I had it the moment we stood together against the Chitauri in New York. Just took me a while to realize it.â
The object in question was a small heating coil, which had somehow wound its way into the soft curls around Tonyâs temple and â if the faint odor of sulfur was anything to go by â produced a nest of charred hair in the process. Tony hadnât even seemed to notice his new accessory when he wandered into the kitchen, eyes gazing vacantly into the middle distance. He had opened one of the kitchen cabinets and then slumped against the side of the refrigerator, where he had remained, as if in a fugue state, until Steve took him by the shoulders and gently steered him toward a seat at the dining room table.
âItâs going to be okay, Tony,â he promised, trying to will some calm into his voice as Tony heaved air back into his lungs. âIâm going to tell them.â Tony shook his head violently, trying to shout something behind the tape that sounded suspiciously like, âshut up, you idiot,â but Steve pressed on. He looked back and forth between Rumlow and Ward, trying to hold their gaze. âI know where Fury is, and I can take you to him. But youâve got to let Tony go first. Let him go, and Iâll take you right to the Director. You have my word.â
Tony narrowed his eyes as he watched her twirl the discarded sweater in a few graceful circles with her wrist. Noticing his glare, she gave him the tiniest of smirks, her head inclining across the table. Tony followed its direction and saw that Bruce was staring openly, mouth hanging slightly ajar, cards lying untouched on the table.
âLet go,â Tony said, trying to twist his arm out of Tyâs grip and finding it surprisingly, almost tear-inducingly hard to move Tyâs fist.
âHey,â Tony said, poking at Steveâs shoulder as Steve tried to concentrate on the movie the team had chosen, âyouâre really strong, right? But also, like, precise. I bet if you hit me on the head with this remote in just the right wayâ¦â
Steve grimaced. He should have suspected this was about Malibu. It had been hard enough convincing Tony to let the SHIELD contingent of the Avengers accompany him to California after the incident with Happy and the threats from the Mandarin. Tony had tried to downplay the danger, but after Thor had let slip that heâd used the hammer to restart Tonyâs heart, Steve had been feeling particularly stubborn about the issue. And when Tonyâs house had indeed been attacked, Steve had felt so relieved that Tony hadnât been alone to fend off the assault that he must have missed the signs that Tony was blaming himself for the leg injury Clint had sustained in the fight.
âYou lured me out of bed under false pretenses,â Tony said accusingly as Steve hit the button for the common room floor. âWhen you texted about âgetting a workout in,â I assumed any bruising or pinning would be of a more amorous variety.â
âThatâs âNot Safe for Work,â if you havenât had any advisees who are Extremely Online,â Tony continued. âAnyway, just thought Iâd offer a small word to the wise: itâs best not to get Sitwell hot and bothered with points of order â at least not in public. What he really needs is a consenting adult with a matching procedural kink so he can role-play
Steve had drifted in and out of consciousness for a while after that, finally waking up long enough to eat a holiday dinner of contraband take-out, which Natasha had smuggled into the hospital using only Thorâs tendency to knock over delicate instruments and Bruceâs oversized jacket.
With that, he hoisted the strap to his bag over one shoulder and strode out of the lecture hall, leaving Tony staring after him in annoyance. How had Dr. Nothing Tastes as Good as Self-Righteousness Feels managed to steal his cue for a dramatic exit
âOh, you know me,â Steve said. But as Tony slipped out of the elevator and into his penthouse, Steve couldnât quite pretend those words were true.
Bruceâs voice was slightly distorted by the walls of his blanket fort, which Steve had suggested building as an anti-Hulking measure when the first wave of ornaments flew off their branches and into attack formation. So far the strategy had proved successful, with only one close call after Thor almost collided with the fort during an enthusiastic mid-air tackle.
Jeffrey Maceâs voice echoed down the hallway, reminding Tony that he had lingered in the lecture hall for a dangerously long period of time. Taking a long drag from his now-cold coffee cup to fortify himself, he made a bee-line for the exit and headed for the faculty parking lot before he could be forced to come up with another polite version of, âThank you for thinking of me, but Iâd rather be slowly pressed to death with the weight of my own lecture notes.â
âBite me,â Clint grinned, clapping a hand on Tonyâs shoulder. âAnd nice hairdo, by the way. It really screams âI blacked out in my workshop again and slept in a puddle of motor oil.ââ Steveâs face pinched tight as he scanned Tonyâs face, but Natasha just rolled her eyes.
âIâll get to know the people you trust, Mr. Stark,â Steve said once they were alone, âBut for as long as this threat is active, theyâll have to get to know me too. Iâm here to put your safety first, and the people who can be trusted with it shouldnât have a problem accepting a few limits to their access.â
âYou canât stand Hammer,â Bruce pointed out. âLast year at a faculty meeting, you told him he wouldnât recognize chiaroscuro if someone taped a strobe light to his head.â
âThatâs our cue,â Steve said, fastening the handle over the line and reaching out to Harrison. âReady? Hold on tight.â
âSteve?â he called tentatively. Steve looked up at him, and he must have noticed Tonyâs confusion because he took a quick step toward him before freezing and crossing his arms gingerly over his chest.
He paused, chewing at his lower lip. Come on, Rogers, he thought firmly. It's too late to pull the chute now.
âIâll trust him a little more or less after I go through this disk myself,â Natasha replied. âBut I donât like this set up. Why would May send her specialist to deliver this information? Why not turn it over to Fury and let him handle the briefing? Why not send Skye to explain what she found herself?â
âSomehow I find that criticism loses its sting coming from you,â Steve replied. He hesitated briefly and then cautiously wrapped Tonyâs hand in his. âI didnât say anything because Iâve never had any expectations. Youâre the king and Iâm â well, I know who I am. But if you would let me, I swear: I would be whatever you need.â
âPepper, you have to get somewhere safe,â Steve found himself saying. He could feel the ice floes now, and he allowed himself one deep breath as the cold inside him rose to cover the howling agony. âFind Happy or Rhodey and go somewhere that no one would associate with you. Do not trust anyone from SHIELD until you hear from me again. Do you understand?â
âYeah, and howâd you get him to come into the house with you?â Clint asked knowingly. âYou steal his keys?â
Or maybe, Steve thought, as he looked up and met Tonyâs eyes again, Tony had guessed more than he was saying about why Steve was leaving. Maybe he was trying to throw Steve a line he could follow to find his way back.
doing that right now. Do you hear me? I do not grant you absolution, so you better stick around and fight for it, you stubborn bastard.â
âProbably the right choice, Banner,â Clint nodded sagely, now back from the kitchen and tossing barbecue chips to himself in the air.
âOh, please,â Tony grinned. âBefore I was king, maybe â when we would sneak out of the castle and play at knights and dragons with Rogers and the other stable boys â then you were willing to put me through my paces. But both of you suddenly developed a strange compunction about throwing me on my back after I took the throne. So if I looked rusty out there on the field of battle, perhaps you should examine your own consciences.â
Theyâd needed the full stack of blankets when they first arrived at the hunting cabin. Both of them had been bruised, a little battered, and near-hypothermic after a freak blizzard had forced a change in the extraction plan for their last mission: a particularly painful downgrade from âfeet warmers and hot coffee on the quinjetâ to âfour-hour search through the woods for any signs of human habitation.â But Steve, who had never quite succeeded in hiding how tense cold-weather ops made him, had needed the signs of warmth even more than Tony. If the shivers rattling his teeth as he searched the yard for fallen branches hadnât been proof enough, the fact that heâd let Tony volunteer to start the fire would have clinched it.
Steve met Natashaâs gaze and knew from the small pinch around her eyes that she was coming to the same conclusion.
âThen fight it, you asshole!â Tony exploded. âYou donât get to make this call. Not after everything â you donât get to ask me to watch you die, Steve. I canât do it.â
Tony yelped. He turned for the stairs again, torn between wanting to help James and knowing that six weeks of Groupon-inspired kickboxing classes weren't enough to be any kind of help at all.
The detritus was years thick: Howard had never been able to let go of a single coffee tin or sheet of paper that bore any connection to his time working with the military. And until the day his father wrapped his car around a utility pole, it had remained unclear to Tony whether the fixation was in spite of the warâs negligible effect on his future prospects or because of it. Whatever the reason, Howard had continued to stockpile collections of junk in old office buildings or the garages of distant relatives: any place he thought might save them from his wifeâs efforts to maintain household order. If he and Tony had had a better relationship - or any relationship, really - perhaps Tony might have someday learned why a box full of failed blueprints had mattered more to Howard Stark than his only child.
âSo if you are a ghost,â Tony asked conversationally, âwhy are you sitting me down for a fireside chat? Does the haunting business have a new P.R. rep? Trying out a gentler approach to scaring the shit out of people?â
Tony took a deep breath before cracking the cover, sending up a prayer to the patron saint of archival miracles.
, and then hit send before the existential panic could seep in. The sheets of paper littered across his floor were starting to vibrate slightly as Tony tried to keep them in focus, and he needed to grab some sleep before he face-planted into a pool of rainbow-colored "chocolate" crumbs.
âDonât you dare come out of there, Odinson. This is finally happening. And if they get spooked and go back to making puppy eyes at each other, I will personally disembowel whoever is responsible.â
âSomething Stern said at the hearing today has been bothering me,â Tony explained. âHe mentioned Gulmira twice. It was almost like he wanted it on the record, which is weird, because hardly of the details of that operation are public knowledge. In fact, I only told three people that I had found your report: you, Pepper, and Obie. And I couldnât think of any reason why bringing up that battle would
âFirst words in a week, and thatâs what you want to talk about?â Tony demanded, his eyes darting fiercely back and forth across Steveâs face before his gaze turned abruptly flat. âFine, business as usual. Iâll have my nuclear physicist call your ex-assassin, and weâll draw up a game plan.â He paused, his jaw working as if he were chewing on something hard. âFor the
âItâs going to be okay,â Steve told him, and Tony couldnât tell whether his voice was shaking or Tonyâs hearing was getting fuzzy. âI wonât let anything happen to you.â
They were only a few meters away â close enough to see Tony depositing Clint near the front strut and Rumlow examining the stolen case â when Harrison suddenly shouted and dropped to his knees.
There might have been a moment when Steveâs brain formed a conscious intention to move, but if there was, he missed it. By the time his mind caught up with his body, he was already pressed up against Tony, kissing him hungrily as he crowded him back against the wall of the elevator. Tony made an eager noise of want in response, grabbing the ends of the towel around Steveâs neck and using it to pull him downward. A second later, his grip tightened as Steve grasped the backs of Tonyâs thighs and hoisted him onto the railing. Tony retaliated by wrapping his legs around Steveâs waist, rolling his hips in a way that made the air catch in Steveâs throat.
âTony?â Clint came flying into the room, his eyes widening as he took in the sight of Steveâs body â
of the army. Youâre not trained for combat â you didnât even have the proper equipment. What were you thinking?â
âYou canât use your newfangled acronyms to confuse me,â Steve protested, gripping one of Tonyâs shoulders carefully while jumping back to put his feet out of range of the shorter manâs legs. âThatâs cheating.â
And as Steve felt Tonyâs hands cupping the sides of his face, he realized he must be imagining again. His mind was always trying to find another way to fix things, and so he must have dreamed about the death threats that had led him to this cell. Getting news of the plot against Stark Tower from Natashaâs sources, deciding to track down the lead himself, the unknown days of torture after it had turned out to be a trap: all of it must have all been in his head, because the versions of Tony who forgave him â the ones who said Steveâs name and caressed his cheek, as this Tony was doing â never turned out to be real. When Steve opened his eyes, heâd be curled up on the couch of a safe house in Kiev or folded into a bus seat on the way to Jodhpur, waking up to another day in exile.
"Well, for one, the entire library is packed with people. It's like a Rolling Stones concert out there."
âThatâs what Iâm worried about,â Steve replied finally, so softly that Tony wasnât sure whether the words were meant for him or not.
âFine. Iâll tell my therapist to set aside some time to unpack my memorabilia fetish, Sugar Bear,â Tony promised with faux seriousness, âbut honestly itâs probably going to be some time before we get to it, what with all the genocidal aliens and nuclear warheads floating around in there. Not to mention a whole lot of other sexually confusing experiences I had in the dorm room in question ââ
His chest constricted horribly, and he could hear the heart monitors next to him start to wail in alarm. Steve had locked himself in with exactly the death he must have feared the most, and Tony had led him right to it, and â fuck. He couldnât breathe.
Tony turned away to grab a couple beers from the fridge and â when he thought he saw Steveâs face fall slightly â switched out his own beer for a bottle of seltzer. He held out the beer to Steve before boosting himself up on the counter, settling into a spot where he would be less tempted to try to soften Steveâs frown in a distinctly un-friend-like manner.
âI donât know,â Steve responded, shaking his head against the itching sensation on the back of his neck â like seeing a face that should be familiar but being unable to remember the name.
âNow I will have to move on to plan B,â Zemo had continued. âI hope you will still find it up to your standards.â
For a long moment, Ty didnât move an inch, and Tony pulled Pepperâs arm against his side in case he needed to step between them. But then Ty smiled even more broadly, pushing himself away from the bookcase with a flourish.
âWardâs here â the specialist from Mayâs team,â Natasha said. âThey have some new intel they want us to look at.â
He realized heâd been gazing into Steveâs eyes, and he gave himself a mental shake. Right, Tony: you offered to listen, not to swoon over how soft his eyelashes look up close.
âI invented a new game!â Clint elaborated, patting amiably at Thorâs hand on his shoulder. âItâs called Human Flippy Cup, and thereâs â wait...where did I put the karaoke machine?â He twisted around, wobbled, and then started rifling through the fronds of a potted plant, presumably in search of a karaoke machine. âThereâs a song-and-dance component.â
âQuit your carping,â Tony muttered. He must have decided his path of retreat had been effectively cut off because he switched gears and stepped back into the elevator with elaborate casualness. âYouâve already got enough sugar in those sticky little fingers to put a horse into hyperglycemic shock.â
Harrison seemed unable to answer, his hands clutched to the side of his head as he doubled over in pain.
She left to go rally the rest of their caravan (how sheâd managed to coax Bruce Banner away from his textbooks and houseplants every Friday that fall Tony didnât know and didnât care to learn), and Tony heard Steve take a deep breath, as if he were readying himself for battle.
A moment later, the walls shuddered around them as the elevator suddenly resumed its upward motion. The intercom crackled to life, and a round of tinny, modulated cheering rang through the cabin.
Tony had made it to the office door - his first time being back since the coffee date - and was just reaching up to knock when it swung open to reveal a scowling James. "Oh," he said. "Tony."
âBuckyâs not my ââ Steve clenched his jaw, and Tony could practically hear his teeth grinding. âWhat happened to Bucky is my problem.â
âHey, Iâll be happy to pass my trump card whenever one of you wants to fly an armed nuclear weapon through a magical portal into space.â
âAm I okay?â he repeated, pulling back so he could take in Steveâs face. Steveâs eyes were filled with concern, and Tonyâs chest tightened, knowing he was never going to forget what those eyes had looked like with nothing behind them. âNo I am not okay, Steve. I just electrocuted you. First you told me you loved me, and then I stopped your goddamn heart.â
"Oh yeah, for sure. It was a very low-speed spin-out, and the snow was still soft. Not even an elbow bump." Tony wobbled his elbow to show how fine it was, and James laughed.
James softened, his brow twisting from frustration to concern. "Okay, okay. Sit down. What's wrong? Are you in trouble?"
He winced, rubbing his leg under the table where Natasha seemed to have found a pressure point. But he did take three long gulps of water from the glass, and Natasha shifted to patting his knee in approval.
Rhodey watched him steadily for a while and then nodded. He opened his mouth to say more, but he was cut off by the sound of Tonyâs phone ringing. Tony looked down at it, and he could feel himself smiling again (goofilyâ¦okay, it was a goofy smile), because a photo of Steve grinning in front of the Worldâs Biggest Ball of Yarn had just appeared on his screen. Rhodeyâs forehead creased slightly as he took in Tonyâs reaction, but he pulled Tony into a hug as he got up.
Tony huffed. He was grumpy and hungry, sore from too many hours in the car, and a new headache was blooming behind his eyes. "It's - you know what fuck it. Maybe if we continue on this way you'll take my grading too. Lord knows I'd need it." He made a vague gesture and stomped off through the icy air.
âI was wrong about the wire,â Steve insisted. Then, after a momentâs hesitation, he added, âbut Iâll concede that youâre still a bit of an asshole if that helps maintain the image.â
Steve had replayed the sound of that voice so many times in the months since Siberia â pressing it to surface of his memory like a needle until it traced a groove deep into his mind. It was probably inevitable that when he finally heard it again, he would do whatever it asked; so he did his best to breathe through each new slash of sensation as Tony held his weight and someone else â Colonel Rhodes, he thought â cut through the manacles around his wrists.
âItâs everything we have on Project TAHITI, including the formula for GH 325, a regenerative drug made from Kree blood. I supervised the project in its trial stages, though that was one of the memories SHIELD deleted after I died. Fury wanted TAHITI as a way to revive a fallen Avenger; but in the end he had to settle for resurrecting some sap who took a magic scepter to the heart.â
âYep, you got it, gum drop,â Tony replied absently, already picking up speed on his way over to the Fine Arts building. âNothing stupid. Definitely dropping it.â
Steve went momentarily still with surprise, and then he was kissing back greedily, one arm wrapping around Tonyâs waist and sliding up the small of his back as he pulled Tony in tighter. Tony brought his hands up to the sides of Steveâs face, clinging onto the heat returning to his cheeks. He tilted Steveâs chin so that he could part his lips, and Steve rushed upward to meet him, his fingers weaving through the still-damp waves of Tonyâs hair.
âWhen you sign up to be an Avenger, no one warns you about doing overtime as a falafel mule,â Bruce had mused, leaning back to let Natasha steal a fry off his plate.
âNope. Nuh huh. No way, Brucie. This was not an âoops I just sent everyone on the admissions committee a photo of my dog.â He CC:ed the alumni list-serve to suggest that the lack of therapists in student services was willful negligence. I could hear the President screaming about âsole fiduciary responsibilityâ from my office.â
Of course, even with (or perhaps because) of their shared predilection for insubordination, the partnership hadnât always been a smooth fit. Tonyâs attention to detail ran hot and cold with an unpredictability that had driven Steve to try everything from herbal teas to his neighbor Sharonâs yoga class: better to hunch his way through sleeping pigeon than to keep grinding his teeth every time he walked into their office and saw a paper-clip replica of the Washington Monument where Tonyâs latest case report was supposed to be. And Tony had had to develop a whole new set of distinct eye rolls â ranging in significance from âI knew youâd say that, you corny bastardâ to âstop being such a goddamn martyrâ â to circumvent Steveâs tendency to dig in deeper the more resistance he faced.
âYouâre going to tell us where to find Fury,â Ward commanded, cocking his gun and keeping it trained on Tony. âYouâve got until the count of five, and then I start shooting appendages.â
âWell, unfortunately for you, I happen to have a lot of experience in that area,â he replied finally, a new, sour note creeping into his voice. âAnd youâre right: the benefits package never quite covers the costs.â
âExcuse me? My what?â Tony replied. âI do not have a historical crush on Steve Rogers. I have a rigorous, methodologically innovative, and soon-to-be discipline-redefining
Steve broke off suddenly and turned back toward the espresso machine, squeezing the shelf below it with his left fist.
âThat was different, Tony,â Steve shook his head. âYou werenât responsible for Killian. But Bucky â I left him. I got him into a fight, and I didnât get him out of it. I canât do that again.â
On the one hand, it was an incredible windfall: more facts to go on than Tony would have dared to hope for when he was staring at walls of redacted text at the Houghton. On the other hand, it still told him frustratingly little about the human elements of the story. Why had Steve Rogers volunteered for multiple (apparently quite risky) weapons initiatives, and why had such an illness-prone private soldier been chosen for operations so sensitive? What was it about Rogers that had moved Carter enough to hold onto his personal effects - or to prompt the footnote about Rebirth having an incalculable effect on her life?
âWhatâs wrong?â Tony asked quickly, and in an instant he had one hand pressed against Steveâs forehead and another clasping his wrist. âDo you need the doctor?â
âFine!â Steve snapped, making a show of sagging in the chair. âPlease. Iâll tell you. Ward, Iâll tell you, because the message comes from Coulson.â He held his breath and watched the aim of Wardâs gun shift ever so slightly.
âMay worked ops with Coulson for years when she was in the field,â he explained. âThey were very close. I havenât seen her since ââ His voice tightened and he glanced up at the ceiling. âI didnât expect to see her.â
âIâm in my workshop, where I work, Captain Melodrama. If youâre all going to call in the crisis negotiators every time I have a casual Tuesday nightââ
faculty-welcoming committee,â Bruce pointed out, but Tony was already giving him a jaunty wave as he sauntered down the steps toward the front row of the lecture hall.
The result was that Steve had been finding it increasingly hard to say ânoâ to Tonyâs pitches about the paranormal, even when they involved ex-soldiers who appeared to be spontaneously exploding in public places or a creature called the Fiji Mermaid. Steve found it especially hard to say ânoâ at close range. There was something about the way the corner of Tonyâs mouth tugged upward when he came across a case that he knew Steve would find particularly irritating. Or perhaps it was the way that, even in the gloom of a starless night, Tonyâs eyes always seemed to reflect some extra source of light Steve couldnât otherwise detect.
âI have never once commanded you to do anything against your will, Steve,â Tony said, keeping his voice even through extraordinary effort, âand I donât want to now. But I need to see where youâre hurt.â
âIs that supposed to make me feel better?â Tony snapped. âHappy, call Dr. Cho and tell her weâre sending a helicopter to pick her up.â
They made their way up to the common room, where Thor, Bruce, and Clint had already gathered around the couch with a clean-cut, dark-haired man who Steve assumed must be Agent Ward. Ward and Clint had been chatting affably, but Wardâs posture straightened as the rest of the team approached.
Steve didnât look at him immediately, turning to grip the railing next to the reservoir and dropping his chin forward toward his chest. His face looked empty in a way that Tony hadnât seen since their first meeting in Stuttgart: not sad, exactly, but blank, like someone had cut the tendons that held him together. And, just as he had then, Tony felt an overwhelming urge to poke and needle until some other expression â any other expression â took the place of the desolation behind that seventy-year stare.
He was just pulling himself to his feet when the door that he and Tony had originally walked through (or one of its copies â Steve honestly couldnât be sure) cracked open, and Steve had his gun in his hand almost before he formed the conscious intention to draw it.
It was an effort for Tony to look at his face. He was so afraid of finding pity â or a knowing glance that said, âwell, of courseâ¦who didnât see that coming?â But Steveâs expression wasnât what he expected. There was sympathy there, yes, but also something else Tony couldnât quite read. Guilt, maybe?
âYouâve been doing a lot of sleeping, there, Cap? It doesnât look like you were nestled in your bed dreaming of sugarplums when Bruce found you.â
One hand later, Tony was slipping the waist of his pants slowly over his hips. Two hands later, Steve was using more muscles to remove a pair of socks than Tony had known the human body to contain. When Tony retaliated by rolling up his sleeves before peeling off his own socks, Steve ripped his belt off with a speed that made Tony feel like the armor had taken a blow to the head. By the time Tony shimmied his way out of his dress shirt, Bruce had to pretend to bump into the table before Tony remembered there were other people in the room.
They passed seventeen floors in determined silence before it happened. First the lights flickered, then the cabin walls shuddered, and then the whole elevator hitched to a stop, the cables emitting a faint squeal of protest.
âAgent Harrison,â Steve said, laying one hand gently on the manâs shoulder. âMy name is Steve Rogers, and Iâm here to get you home. Do you think you can walk?â
ââ anyway, it didnât take, and then that first night after the gym...what you were offering me was so much more than I ever thought Iâd have in this century, and I was soâ¦God, I was so fucking lonely. So I just grabbed it.â
There, on the screen, helicopters were firing on Tonyâs house. Bullets shattered the windows, missiles hewed giant chunks off the cliff foundations, and then the whole house was plummeting into the ocean.
âIâm where I want to be,â Steve replied firmly, and when he turned to look at Tony there was a determination in his eyes that almost made Tonyâs knees buckle on the spot.
Steve shook his head to clear the memory, giving himself a mental kick when he saw how intently Natasha was watching him.
âStay down until we get the clear,â Steve insisted, holding his position as Tony pushed at his shoulders.
Bruce had been nodding along slowly as Tony spoke, and now he leaned forward to rest his forearms on the table between them.
âItâs my deal,â Steve said finally, and Tony snapped out of his reverie in time to notice that Thor had won the last hand, and Clint was now heading to the pantry to grab potato chips wearing nothing but a pair of purple boxer-briefs.
Something about the way Tony had said the word âtrappedâ set off an alarm at the back of Steveâs mind, and he frowned as he reconsidered the frantic beat of Tonyâs fingers against the metal rail.
He illustrated his point with a jaunty five lines about his âplansâ to model the production process for Project Rebirth with his summer research students, tied off the application with a nod to
Dr. Grant frowned. "I've been all over," he said, suddenly sounding like a perfectly bland, midwestern news anchor.
âWhat if this obscure footnote has remained an obscure footnote because thereâs actually no there there?â Tony jumped in. âWhat if I blow my chances of getting this book under contract before I go up for full professor by obsessing about a tiny detail that may turn out to be nothing more than a heavily redacted military boondoggle? What if this time next year, Hayward is climbing over my prone body on the way to his new office as Associate Dean, and I have only these loose pages of inconclusive notes and a middle-aged hamster with obsessive-compulsive tendencies to comfort me as I slide slowly into ever-increasing professional obscurity?â
âI thought it was Furyâs intel they were after,â Steve said. âWhy wouldnât they send the videos to him? Or to Nat?â
And that was probably more of a revelation than a race to lose at strip poker merited, but Tony couldnât regret it, because a totally new expression had bloomed over Steveâs face. As Steve leaned down and pressed their foreheads together, one finger tracing the line of Tonyâs jaw, Tony tried to memorize it. Tell: the smile that meant Steve Rogers was happy.
âNonsense,â Tony said evenly, pitching his reply to both Steve and Rhodes. âThere was no question of staying behind and letting my marshal have all the glory again. Besides, I have it on good authority that seeing me ride out in my armor fills my subjects with very fine feelings.â
âThey had a live feed of everyoneâs location â the whole team,â Steve explained. âThey said they had snipers in position. I couldnât take the chance that they were telling the truth.â
It had been the big rivalry game against Liberty University, of course, and Tony had been in the stands the whole time. But he was glad he didnât voice
âLook, Steve,â Natasha said, âTony bought this hospital in under an hour and flew in a hand-picked staff so that you could get the best medical care completely off the grid. Iâm going to go out on a limb here and say that he might not be disappointed to get a text.â
He was rolling already by the time he hit the glass. He landed in a crouch, grabbed the shield from his back and held it in front of him as he quickly scanned the room. A young man Steve assumed was Harrison was lying in a medical chair near the center, and three guards with assault rifles and masks had been scattered around the room. One of the three had managed to get his gun pointed in Steveâs direction, so Steve aimed the shield in his direction first. As soon as it was in the air, he charged the man closest to him. He collided in time to rip the assault rifle upward, then spun the guardâs body to put it between him and the final assailant. He twisted the rifle out of guard number twoâs hand and shot guard number three, just as a bullet from guard number three hit guard number two in the chest.
Natasha, meanwhile, was taking much longer than seemed strictly necessary to relieve herself of a pullover sweater, and Tony suddenly froze in the act of picking up his cards: because how had
Tony sighed and let himself be pulled back against Steveâs chest, feeling the electric current humming through his limbs lessen slightly as Steve scraped gentle circles across his scalp. Tony pulled Steveâs free hand across his body and tucked it under his own arm, listening as Natasha and Clint went back to workshopping plans to beat Oceanâs team to the FabergÃ© egg and Rhodey resumed explaining why Basher was clearly the real brains of the operation.
âI donât owe you mission reports, remember?â he continued, and he had the satisfaction of watching a twist of annoyance at the corner of Steveâs mouth.
But when he turned the sheet over to follow the trail onto the next paragraph, all he found was wall-to-wall black boxes. Hardly a word had been left unredacted, leaving an inscrutable arrangement of articles, pronouns, and repeated surnames: âPhillipsâ and âHodge,â followed by a blank; but âI,â followed by another blank; and then âRogers,â followed by the longest blank yet.
âMy whole life before I came here, I was surrounded by people who always knew what they would look like on camera at any moment. Hardly any of them would have risked losing status to help me out of a tight spot â and that includes my parents. But then I met you: this guy who always looks alarmingly, disgustingly ready to pose for a center spread in
âI have a naturally retentive mind,â Tony replied archly. âI acquire knowledge almost involuntarily â itâs a curse I have to bear.â
Steve cleared his throat just loudly enough for the sound to reach Tonyâs ears, and Tony rolled his eyes, knowing Steve would somehow catch the gesture even though he couldnât see Tonyâs face. It was hardly the first time Steve had registered displeasure at the kingâs decision to join the battle against Pierceâs rebel army. Not that he had voiced his opinion as openly as Rhodes had: ever since Steve had accepted the change of position from King Howardâs groom to King Anthonyâs valet de chambres, he had refused to let a word of direct challenge pass his lips in Tonyâs presence. But in the hours leading up to Tonyâs departure for the field, Steve had used every nonverbal tactic at his disposal, from sighing significantly and deliberately catching his feet against the edges of the furniture to staring Tony directly in the eyes, his gaze so fierce with emotion that Tony felt his spine shiver like a struck lance.
The reactions were subtle, and Tony might have missed them if he hadnât been looking. Skyeâs eyes flickered to the image of redacted files Tonyâs phone was displaying, and she skimmed nervously over the visible words before returning her gaze to Fury. May barely moved a muscle, but the corners of her mouth tightened ever so slightly, from cool to grim. Fury turned to face Tony, one hand slipping just slightly toward the holster on his hip. Steve must have seen that last movement too, because he shifted the angle of his chair, putting himself more firmly between Fury and Tony.
Tony flailed for a moment then grabbed a handful of the back of James' shirt. He seemed to know what he was doing, so Tony's best option seemed to be to obey.
But finally, after extended phone arguments with someone Steve assumed must be John Garrett, Sitwell had taken the TAHITI files and told Steve to get into the back of the town car. Once inside, Steve had been instructed to handcuff himself and drink the vial of liquid attached to the side door. Steve had counted on being knocked out one way or the other before the journey to HYDRA headquarters, and he had drained the glass tube without hesitating.
âEverybody down!â he yelled, grabbing Tonyâs shoulder with one hand and pulling him backward and toward the ground. With the same momentum, he lunged forward, twisting to put the bulk of his body between Tony and the man in the jacket. As Steve dropped to cover Tonyâs position on the floor, two shots rang through the room, and something hot and sharp snicked across his side like a bee sting. Steve wrapped his arms around Tonyâs head, hunching his shoulders to be sure he had shielded his torso completely, but he couldnât hear any additional shots over the screams of the guests.
Steve let Tony continue his monologue while he conducted a sweep of the room. He knew his habit of checking the undersides of tables and couches was probably drawing eye rolls from the direction of the kitchen, but Steve had his own strategies for unwinding the tension that bunched up like barbed wire at the back of his neck. This time, however, he barely made it to the coffee table in the common area before his nerves started firing in alarm. Something was wrong â something
He pulled the pocket square from his tux and pressed it firmly against Steveâs side, wrapping his other hand around Steveâs back to get better leverage.
They turned back toward the ladder they had climbed down, but the spot where it had stood was now empty, leaving no clear route to the walkway above. After exchanging a brief look - the meaning of which might have translated, on both sides, to something like âI told you soâ - they strode toward a door on the opposite side of the room instead, throwing it open and stepping intoâ¦
âAh that gives me an idea!â Thor exclaimed. He popped his head up from behind the kitchen counter, where he had apparently been braiding one of the garlands into his hair. âThe tiny Iron Soldiers seem determined to guard the spirit of the holidays. Perhaps we can use that to our advantage.â
âMost of them are the firmâs,â Steve clarified. âThose are in the paperwork Ms. Potts showed you. One of them is mine: that if under any circumstances I say ârun,â you run.â
âI am not ââ Tony gritted his teeth briefly, as Sam and Natasha traded looks and Wanda smirked. âIâm here on business.â
âI was going to say that I donât negotiate with banana pushers,â Tony said, âbut now that I know it will annoy Barton, Iâm in. JARVIS, order us the finest fruit baskets in the land and cue up
He buried his face in his hands, gripping at the curls around his temples to fight back the tears burning in the corners of his eyes.
That wasnât quite true, but it was closer to true than Tony cared to admit. He had been sleeping horribly since his brief trip to space (when he slept at all), and heâd been finding excuses to keep Pepper out of the Tower so she wouldnât find out how bad the caffeine shakes had gotten. It was a stalling tactic, he knew â a game he was trying to prolong without any sense of how to win it. But then again, Tony had produced a lot of his best work in states of total desperation.
The last chapter of the collection is here! Thank you to everyone who has read these short stories here and on Tumblr. I am wishing us all more justice and more peace in the new year to come.
âTony,â Steve smiled, putting a new note into the syllables that Tony didnât think heâd heard before. âI got you something too.â He reached into the inner pocket of his coat and took out a small wrapped package.
âOkay, Captain Sass,â he grinned. âKeep your secrets. But just â you can talk about that stuff if you want to, okay? With Nat â or Bruce is pretty good listener when heâs not the size of a tractor-trailer. But it could be me too. I mean, I spilled my guts to you a few weeks back, so you owe me at least one mortifying confession anyway.â
It was Steveâs first contribution to the discussion since heâd introduced himself, and Tony glanced up from his phone long enough to give him another once over, his gaze lingering on the places where Steveâs shirt pulled tight against his chest. Steveâs eyes barely flickered in response. He was used to attracting that kind of attention by now. Physical build was part of what the firm considered when assigning an agent to a new client, and Furyâs instinct that obvious brawn would be more helpful in Starkâs case than stealth or discretion was part of why Steve was taking this meeting instead of Natasha or Sharon.
âPlease,â Tony replied, so quickly that he winced internally. He stepped back to let Steve through the door. âIs everything all right? Youâre not hurt?â
âSo was that a first, Cap?â Tony asked as the last sliver of the landing pad disappeared behind the elevator doors. âNo judgment here â probably werenât a lot of opportunities for airplane sex for a guy who could have theoretically shaken hands with one out of two Wright brothers â Iâd just be crossing a big-ticket item off my bucket list if I got to be the one to welcome Captain America to the mile-high club.â
âYou â what? What the fuck, Steve!â he exploded. âYou canât say shit like that when Iâm about to kill you! You love me? I am going to bring you back and murder you five more times, you absolute
âI love you too, you big sap,â Tony replied, and as the team whooped and set off a round of Christmas crackers, he pulled Steve back down by the front of his Iron Man sweater.
âAll right, focus up, champ,â Tony told himself bracingly. âSnowmagedonâs coming: no time to get maudlin.â
âBig man, Rumlow,â Steve spat out, âI always knew you were sloppy in the field, but Iâm glad to see youâre a coward too.â
âSon of a bitch,â he swore, sinking to his knees. His mind buzzed emptily, like a television that had lost its signal and could broadcast nothing but static. Steve advanced a step toward him, and Tony felt himself collapse onto the floor.
âYouâre a real clever guy,â Clint allowed. âBut Iâd hate to be there when no oneâs around to catch the jokes â am I right? Anyway, good luck with the walls!â And with a jovial wave, he turned and sauntered out the opposite end of the library.
Tony collapsed forward in relief, his forehead falling to Steveâs shoulder, and his hands gripping Steveâs upper arms.
It was just this sort of behavior that had landed Tony in trouble with the FBI in the first place. Initially, Assistant Director Fury had been thrilled when MIT-prodigy Tony Stark abandoned his third graduate degree to join the Bureau at age twenty-five. Howard Stark, Tonyâs father and the longtime head of the Science and Technology branch, had just been found dead in his locked bedroom with a bullet in his skull, and Fury hoped that the younger Stark might be interested in picking up where his father left off. Four case reports, six angry phone calls, and one out-of-court settlement later, Fury had learned the hard way that Tony was not interested in
Tony and Clint got the message from Natasha at noon, were suited up by 12:15, and arrived at the overpass at 12:40: just in time to see Steve take a hit from a rocket launcher and get thrown fifty yards through the air and into a bus. Tony was already swearing viciously, fighting to keep his gauntlet loose where it was clasped around Clintâs waist. But then a man with a metal arm â the Winter Soldier, Natasha had called him â jumped down from the highway and started strafing the bus with gunfire, and Tony saw red.
Tonyâs smile widened cautiously, and Steve would have felt like someone had knifed him, except that he knew he was the one holding the blade.
Initially, when Natasha â one of Tony and Steve's few mutual friends at the beginning of the year â had suggested the two of them could help each other out, Tony had reminded her that Steve would never go for it, because Steve Rogers thought Tony Stark was an irresponsible, conceited, grade-A floozy. Tony knew this, because the first time heâd run into Steve his freshman year, Tony had been at a house party letting some truly terrible people do body shots off his stomach, and Steve had been frowning at him with a look that seemed to say, âyouâre making more bad decisions in this single minute than I will make in my entire life.â
âYou donât fucking say!â Tony replied. âBy the wayâ¦did you seriously shout âover here, assholesâ when you came out of the stairs? Is that the kind of advanced tactics they teach you in basic training these days?â
âCaptain Rogers, please respond,â the smooth voice was saying. âDo you and Agent Romanov require medical assistance?â
âItâs an interactive strategy campaign,â Koenig corrected him, leaning slightly further into Grantâs space as if sensing weakness. âWe meet every Sunday in my basement to engage in battles of wit and skill. Students have to intern for a semester before they can participate, but Iâve been willing to waive that requirement, on a case-by-case basis, for those faculty who demonstrate an aptitude for the intellectual virtues.â
Steve winced, and his hand dropped from Tonyâs neck, hovering over the place on his chest where Tony had shocked him.
âLong time no shush,â Tony said by way of greeting. âI see you have more than a touristâs interest in library etiquette, so welcome. And donât mind our resident parliamentarian by the way. Sitwell derives a degree of satisfaction from administrative objections that is frankly NSFW.â
Steve let out a slow breath as the sound of his partnerâs voice settled around him, his feet feeling steadier as he turned them toward Tony. After all, what other choice did Steve have but to see this through? Either he was letting his nerves get the better of him â in which case there was no harm in staying until Tony had satisfied his curiosity â or there really was something else going on here (maybe some local kids playing a prank) â in which case he had to stay to ensure that Tony had backup.
