Steve is slow sometimes, but he learns.
It was a clear day in April. There was no snow and the lake remained unfrozen, rocking and rocking along the docks in a tease. The sun shone high and bright, a perfect companion to Tony’s request for making the memorial service as a celebration.
“Sap.” Then softly, he added, “Me too. I wish I could, baby.”
“Ugh, you’re too soft when it comes to my head. Scrub harder.” Tony grabbed the towel from Steve and scrubbed in quick, rough motions. “I’m fine, Steve. It’s scarred over. You being rough with my cranium is not gonna give me cancer again.”
She avoids Tony’s grasp and lies flat on the sofa, taking a huge bite of her bean and cheese burrito. She always prefers having her own space to stretch out, and while Tony pouts and pretends to be upset, Steve has no qualms about personal space anymore.
“Tony. You’re not invincible.” Steve measured out.
Steve doesn’t say anything, doesn’t say
When Steve didn’t think of Tony, he wondered if he was alright, if he was at peace. He might never be whole again.
Steve bites back the words, resisting the temptation to pretend that he doesn’t have to walk away after coming, doesn’t have to return to an empty bed, alone with the smell of Tony, the taste of Tony on his lips.
His friends ambushed him while the kids were off at school.
When he comes, it feels like he’s betrayed everyone in the universe.
He was afraid that Steve had left and that last night was simply wishful thinking.
“Can’t help it.” Tony shrugs, apathetic to the sensation of dread brewing in the pits of his stomach. “He makes me bitter.”
Tony took a breath, for once, unsure of the future. They were at crossroads here. A decision had to be made.
“Okay,” Steve starts. He drops his gaze to his watch. It’s past one, but the party's still going hard. There’s a group of people milling around the streets, smoking and stomping on their cigarette butts. “Do you have a ride home?”
Instead, he drops by the stool and observes the unfinished painting lying on the canvas.
“Sir, Ms. Potts has left several messages. Each voice memo has gotten increasingly threatening. I was not able to inform you due to privacy protocols in the shower,” JARVIS announced.
“I just wanted to check,” Steve whispered, letting his index finger run over the five inch scar tissue starting from the middle of Tony’s head. It’s been a couple years since Tony’s emergency surgery and follow-up radiation treatment. But Steve’s always wondering
Right outside the glass panel is Bucky with a shit-eating grin. “Stevie, Stevie, Stevie. God, you put all of us to shame with your antiquated sensibilities. It’s like all the talk about men in the bathhouse is true.”
They exchanged lazy, morning kisses, rocking their bodies together until Tony grinned at him and dropped to his knees and opened his mouth.
Tony teased his hole with the head of his cock before slapping Steve’s ass down. Tony kneaded his cheeks to assuage the sting, then he pried Steve’s ass open.
Tony quirks his lips, the smile fleeting. He knows this man, and can tell you about the two small moles right above his belly button and how Steve smiles when Tony licks at the marks. Trails wet kisses until Tony eventually chokes himself on Steve’s cock. The way Steve likes to fuck his face and call Tony pretty and the power it feels to come on Tony’s face.
It’s abominable irony that every glimmer of hope he’s ever had in his entire adult life has had one thing constant.
They’d stood on the balcony overlooking the street walkers. All of New York, full of life—and then, there was Steve Rogers, Captain America, dying inside by the second as Tony had confessed, “She said she was hopelessly in love with me. I never knew it could be like this, Steve.”
“I don’t kid around about being fucked, Barnes,” Tony yells then laughs before flicking them off. “Now fuck off.”
There's no one else I miss but you. I've told you, Steve. You're an inspiration. To all of us. To me. I'm trying. I strive for the best with SHIELD. With SHRA. With the Avengers. I do. It's not enough. I wish it was.
I loved you. I did.
He was selected for Project Rebirth on a Tuesday.
“I’m allowed to change my mind, you know,” Tony follows up when Steve can’t think of a reply. Tony clocks the layout of the room, probably making note of the exits.
It's still Tony's favorite, and it's nights like this, when Steve is quiet, when he's pleading, that Tony could retreat deeper and deeper inside of himself and pretend this is alright. That this is the Steve he's always known.
Bucky appeared beside her and gave her a kiss, then patted Steve good-naturedly with his metal arm.
“Oh. Fuck.”
It’s alright, he told himself.
Steve dropped his ring beside Tony’s in the cabinet. There’s a soft click, then he swung the little door shut. He observed himself in the mirror once more and forced himself to smile. Steve took two fingers and pulled at his cheeks. He looked awful with pasty red cheeks and his face felt tight. But he maneuvered his fingers to make himself smile. He could do this. It’s a close mimicry for now.
Steve wasn’t gonna fall for it. This was another intervention.
“You don’t know what to do with yourself, huh?” Tony trailed his tongue on Steve’s jaw.
“Nothing wrong with that.”
Here’s the start of their little family.
Steve plucked the flower, sat on the wicker chair, and dropped the carnation on the space beside him.
Steve was silent, but his body shook. Tony stopped breathing. “You hate me. You do. You —”
“Too fucking true.” Tony’s eyes light up with the joke, and Steve’s happy that for once, it landed.
“Why?” There’s many reasons. Tony barks out a short laugh. “I haven’t seen you in years. You get that right?”
Tony's breath hitched and Steve doubled his efforts, ramming his dick inside Tony and jerking him off. His eyes stayed fixed on the column of Tony's throat and the deep purple spots blooming where he sucked.
“A change is gonna come,” Tony sing songs at the exact time. “And it did,” he adds as the song finishes.
Because what else is there other than the present and the future, where there is only death.
He licks Tony’s lips. Doesn’t nibble on it until it’s bleeding and battered. He kisses it soft. Same goes for Tony’s sternum, the space beside his ear.
,” Tony gasps as he rocks forward, fucking his hard, leaking cock on the sheets. The blue cock ring makes the shape of his heavy balls more pronounced. “Ru, come on, please.”
“Is it the war? You… do you get flashbacks?” Tony chews on his lower lip, wetting it. Steve wants to trace the curves of his smile with his tongue.
He opened the medicine cabinet and removed his wedding band with one, quick pull.
But fuck.
“Yeah, us.” Steve squeezed Tony’s hand, then stepped back as Romanoff flipped forward. She smirked at Bucky, and god, what a thought. “Together.”
Steve swallows down the fight inside him. Instead, he takes a deep breath and grasps Tony’s hand. He brings the prosthetic arm up so they could both look at it against the ceiling. The red and gold is darker in this lighting, and their hands make random shapes on the walls.
Tony’s clammy hands shake as he packs the pipe with tobacco, humming a song he doesn’t like to sing anymore. Each verse tastes sour in his mouth, like the tang of alcohol on his tongue. He lights the pipe and observes the upgrades to the armor.
“It’s just a bagel,” Tony says, shrugging.
Harley laughed, ducked Peter’s light punches, then sat beside Steve. He wiggled his fingers eagerly, then stopped once he read the tag on the upper left side of the box.
The sun will set soon, and eventually, Tony will roll over from his workshop across the lake and demand dinner. The charming sod. Good thing Steve is in love with him. He laughs out loud, knowing he can say those words out loud now.
“Lies and slander. You don’t have to kiss my ass you know, you just fucked it.”
They were both a crying mess.
Tony shakes his head and releases his grip on the handle. “It’s fine. I like driving fast too. You’ve seen my sports cars.”
Steve from before who used to fuck him rough. Slap his face until his lips were cracked with blood.
He comes, splattering Tony’s mouth with his come. He tastes almost sweet, salty, unlike the bitterness of what they’ve become. Tony swallows around Steve’s dick, keeping his eyes on him the entire time. Steve watches back, removes his cock, and Tony knows that’s next, too. Steve cups his jaw, inspects that Tony’s swallowed all of him down. He smiles, tiny, wistful, and makes an approving sound.
Tony wasn’t going to cry, that would be reserved for later when he pounded the door of the suite across the hall and demanded they give him the contents of their wet-bar.
Tony’s head is clouding, and he shouts when Steve begins pressing hard on his abdomen, timing it with his thrusts.
Surely, he must.
He offers it to Natasha. She smirks, drinks, and passes it back.
And yet, here they are. Sharing stale air in a room that used to be theirs, bed sheets made together in the morning, pillows kicked at night. The window curtains are parted because Steve likes the night light from the busy, New York city. It’s an artifact he holds onto from his days growing up in the belly of the city. Tony prefers sleeping pitch black, but lets the light pass because Steve likes it. And he loves Steve.
Steve is all over the papers. They all laud him for doing excellent work to protect the nation. They write articles about how Commander Rogers is dealing with the fallout of the Skrull Invasion. They proclaim that he’s rebuilding the world, and it’s so much better this way because when Tony Stark was running the show, he fucked up.
“Yeah, but if you can see
I lied to you. Well. Sort of.
These are all things Steve’s always done, too.
“What are you two up to? And where are we going?” Steve is trapped in the middle seat as Sam and Bucky sandwich him and start the engine.
Tony closes his heavy eyes, praying for sleep to consume him.
“It’s alright.”
For the first time in years, Steve stares into Tony’s eyes. It’s just the two of them. No more pretense of civility for the sake of what’s left of their friends.
Maybe the number of people surrounding him didn’t matter if the one that
“What lie do you want this time?” He sighed, annoyed. He wanted her out and gone so he could go back to the scene.
The medical bay doctors, Chang, Lee, and Ramirez had said something much more medically accurate, but Steve couldn’t hear it over the ringing in his ears. His face felt flush and there were spots of black and white dancing across his eyes for a brief moment, until he saw Tony’s frown in his line of vision.
Steve wishes they were face to face.
I’ve been happy with you and the life we’ve built together. It’s been everything to me. So this ending is happy, too.”
“Well, baby. You did all the heavy lifting, all that was left for me to do was stand there, look good, and watch your ass and biceps flex as you carry the boxes in.” Tony pulled hard on Steve’s hair, shoving him further down to his belly.
Tony accepted his fate in the way Steve could never understand. He sighed, feeling lost and hopeless.
He swallows, wiping at his eyes. It’s just sweat. He’s overwhelmed; it’s a natural reaction. Eyes closed, Steve trails a kiss from Tony’s mouth to his sternum, licking where the RT used to be.
“Just this once.”
“You stink.” Tony wrinkles his nose but makes no move to depart from Steve’s vicinity.
With two years on the run, there wasn’t much time to groom it. When he returned to the Compound after Wakanda, he took the kit from his old room and shaved hairs off in slow, careful strokes. He’ll never admit that he paused too long on the curve of his neck, blade sharp on his jugular.
“Yeah, talk about ex’s.”
Steve shook his head, knowing that the AI is watching and analyzing his posture. Tony created him with so much heart. “No need, JARVIS. It’s alright.”
Steve kisses his eyelids, his lips are soft, tongue languid. No bite to Tony’s lower lip.
His hot, wet cheeks pressed against the armor’s golden chest. The arc reactor shone bright, twinkling.
Steve’s pressing at his prostate, and it’s too much pressure. Tony’s biting his lips from moaning, from crying out, and suddenly, he becomes aware of the pain in his under his belly, too.
They have Morgan until the following day, then, she’d be with Pepper for New Year’s. They’ve decided that they’ll alternate every year.
The jukebox from the corner is quintessential. It’s the allure of a vintage Western Steve’s never known. It plays a beat, and he recognizes the voice from earlier.
“Well, any time you bring up dad, you’re bound to win an argument.” Peter set the messenger bag to the empty seat—Tony’s seat—and grabbed a sliced apple.
There’s howling.
“I said,” Tony heaved a sigh, wide-eyed but calculating. He twisted his body and leaned closer to Steve. “Feel free to say no and tell me I’ve misread this. Everything will be fine. We’ll still be friends, teammates, lead Avengers together—”
He released Steve and removed his blazer and vest. Loosened his tie.
He’s moaning, but all he can think of is that Steve said,
“Peter.” He scrubbed his eyes, got up, and sat beside Peter. Steve pulled his son for a side hug and dropped a kiss to his head.
His grip on the steering wheel slips, but he catches it quickly. With no PO BOX or permanent address for the last half decade, he didn’t receive an invitation. But Natasha, as always, kept him informed on the ins and outs of the Compound. It’s like short weekly reports. She’d send him a two line message about the Avengers and what the rest of them were up to. Just enough detail to put things together when he saw the news in corner restaurants, local bars, on the third page of a French newspaper.
Tony sets the mug down, and a quick peak reveals that it’s empty now. “Yeah, I know you, Rogers.”
He was remembering, as if his subconscious was excavating memories buried in wreckage. But mostly, his thoughts returned to Steve.
“Anything. Everything. I’ll give you whatever you want. You can have it all. I’ll give everything you want.”
“Ok, goodnight then.” Tony half turns towards him, as if waiting for Steve to say more.
Steve thrust deep, saying that he wants to hear Tony moan for him.
I’m reading again.
Hours later, he learned that the train tracks were cleared and the subway resumed it's schedule. The body, what was left of it, was taken piece by piece and placed in a bag, carted away, and life resumed. The subway station announced the arrival of a new car, like nothing happened.
“Well, if we bring kids in the picture, I’m not sure how long we can keep at this superhero gig.”
Steve
Carol and I found a bakery on 54th Street. It didn’t taste the same though. Maybe that’s the thing, Steve. Things can be replaced. Hell, I’ll even go as far to say
His children tried to offer him comfort and do him justice in this embrace. But it wasn’t Tony— the suits were just an estimate of the real man.
There’s a certain tenderness to him that’s openly exposed, as if mentorship and the loss of life encouraged him to pull the plates of armor and reveal the man underneath. For a man who insists on bordering the world with a suit of armor and building one for himself, it’s Steve who’s entrapped under layers and layers of walls.
Steve reached for his son’s wrist, wishing he was still small enough to accept being coddled and rocked on his father’s arms. But lately, Harley’s been rejecting his touches and moving away from him.
Tony grabbed a coat, and as he stepped out of the hotel room, Steve appeared with a sheepish smile, a hand still raised as if to knock on the door.
But the device allowed him to watch the scenes of their lives unfold. It was better than turning over memories in his head—he recalled them perfectly—but BARF allowed him to hear Tony’s voice. The way it would fall flat at a groan. How a sarcastic remark would slide off his tongue.
“He had some ideas about what you all might like.” Steve didn’t want to open up the sheet and stare at Tony’s scrawl. No, he’d do that later. “He helped—he did—he helped pick out—”
“I don’t have to leave your life up to chance, Tony.”
The bed didn’t weigh anything to Steve, but his heart felt heavy carrying it out of the room. He set it in the hallway, careful to not disrupt the hanging photographs of their family.
That’s Steve Rogers. He’s willing to take crumbs because he knows what it’s like to have nothing else. Only, now, it seems like taking scraps is a punishment all on its own.
“You outta know. I bet you’re the type of man who doesn’t wanna say jackshit.” Samuel grins widely, flashing a set of gummy teeth. The incisor is plated in silver.
“My kids—” Steve tried, leaning forward.
now, Mr. Stark.”
“We just miss him.” Peter leaned over from the sofa and squeezed Steve’s shoulder.
“No —“
Sheriff Red Wolf turns toward the Richards' Farm that’s been sitting empty for the last year, only recently occupied with the return of Richards clan.
“I don’t want to.”
I —” he trailed off, remembering how Steve saved him from the lizards but refused to acknowledge his presence after.
There’s surprise painted on Tony’s face; it turns into a slow smile. “Thank you very kindly. Please pass on our appreciate to them.”
He knows when Tony doesn’t want to talk anymore. And after their conversation at the car, it seems to easy to fall into those patterns of debates, stilted beats, waiting for the other to respond.
“And yet.” Tony raises a calloused finger and pulls the sunglasses over his face, ending their conversation with a tone of finality.
It’s likely that Steve already left, there’s no reason to stay. Tony rises from bed, finds his clothes from last night, and drops them back on the sofa. He grabs the comforter, wrapping it around his body. Barefoot, he pads out to the hallway and into the second floor. There’s the distinct smell of bacon and pasta water. Moving slow, he walks to the kitchen to find a figure with broad shoulders, trim waist, and a straight back. It’s not, Ty.
Be happy, he told himself. Smile more.
Steve would kiss Tony’s belly button, put his hands all around him, kiss his face, neck, thankful and endlessly happy that they had something beautiful in a world filled with destruction and decay.
He twisted his hand on the head, squeezing slightly to draw out a moan from Tony. For all the times they’ve fucked, Steve will never get tired of hearing him beg. Steve scooted down and pulled the trousers to Tony’s knees. He kissed them both, trailed kisses up his thighs, then swallowed Tony’s dick. He flattened his tongue and sucked, eyes on Tony the entire time.
By the evening, rain drizzles out of nowhere, followed by the crack of thunder.
“I know, baby. I submitted the schematics to Pep, so everything should be fine now.” He smiled and climbed onto Steve’s lap, ignoring the kissy and mocking faces their kids made. “You won’t miss me tonight.” Tony winked.
“I’m an open book.” Tony shrugged, toying with a couple of buttons on the panel. “Ask me anything and I’ll tell you the truth.” He pointed at Bucky, who seemed relaxed in the facility now. There were no more HYDRA agents on site. He was alone, but still on the chair. “He’s doing better. It’ll be good for him to see his therapist after this though. J, can you schedule it?”
“Tony!” Steve groans and drops his head between Tony’s legs. The answering reply is a quiet one. Tony runs a hand through his scalp again, but this time, it’s softer, massaging.
They reached the lake, it was clear, an almost perfect reflection of the sky. But it has a tinge of green as the waters rock and rock, catching the color of tree planting beside it.
“We’ll never be normal.” Peter shrugged, took another apple slice, and headed down stairs. “Come on, we’ll be late.”
He’s just here to make sure Tony’s alright. Then, maybe he’ll introduce himself. Stone and the woman lean against Tony, light up a cigarette, and laugh. It’s vapid. This isn’t Tony Stark’s scene. No, the Tony Stark that Steve read about is a genius with a heart of gold. A genuinely good man. That’s hard to find these days. While Steve understands his grief, he disagrees with how long Tony’s partying life has been going. He’s afraid that Tony might spiral into full blown substance abuse.
That’s what losing Tony felt like: perpetual suspension and dizziness. He wasn’t even crying anymore. Steve was tired of crying.
“Well, I’ve had a long life,” Samuel says.
Steve pushes him down onto the mattress and pulls the covers over him, like a demented version of domesticity Tony once fantasied. He sits on the side of the bed, pushes Tony’s hair back, a look of satisfaction on his face. “Be good while I’m away.”
“I’ve seen this look.” Samuel takes another drag and tilts his head, studying him. “Running away or running home?”
It’s two syllables that make Steve’s tongue hit his two front teeth every time he says the name out loud. His lips had the tendency to curve into a smile whenever he uttered the name. Tony. Yet these days, Steve often finds the word difficult to say.
“You sure about,” the salesman starts to ask with a grimace, subtly directing Steve to newer models further down the lot, “an ’87 Land Cruiser? It’s a bit outdated, don’t you think?”
Natasha looks at him too closely, suspicious even. “You mean to say you have trouble sleeping every night then, given that you can’t stay in one place. Traveling the world after a big event. That’s what you did after Chitauri.”
Above the mantel hung an idyllic painting of the countryside. Flowers in bloom. Children running around with their plaid skirts. If only life could be like that.
“That’s true,” Steve said, solemn. He picked up Morgan from the counter and deposited her to the chair. They eat breakfast with Peter mumbling about school and programs. Harley teased Peter about a girl named MJ and Morgan complained about the lackluster breakfast selection, asking for a cheeseburger for dinner.
“I wish.” He rubbed a hand over his forehead. “I wish that the serum could have helped him. Hell, something. I don’t know. I would have begged Odin, made a deal with Loki. Whatever it takes, I’d have done it.”
Steve wonders if it’s purposeful, though, that they’re never alone. If they all anticipated Steve to stumble over his words and say the wrong thing and eventually get into a shouting match with Tony, throwing out half-based reasons and long-winded justifications for leaving, for not staying, for running. For being them.
“So, call it midnight breakfast and be done with it. They have that at MIT, you know, the dining commons were open 24 hours so we could feed our brains while we study during finals week.”
But that’s Steve Rogers for you. Too damn good to a fault.
“Is this the video you’re talking about?” He pointed on the screen. There it was, the sepia tone he’s become familiar with these last 16 hours.
It’s the first time Tony’s said his name all day, and he suppresses the pressure on his chest and the need to sigh out.
, Steve hadn’t said. Instead, he’d listened, cataloguing Tony’s eyes, soft and thrilled, to the wide smile on his face. Steve had known then that Tony had fallen in love again.
Tony snorts. “Better.”
Bruce is perched on an armchair, a set of papers balancing on his lap and a holo-screen to the side.
Steve is all about making bad decisions lately.
Tony appeased Steve’s worries with the schematics of the new arc reactor that was removable using nanotech. Instead of a perfect circle, it was now a semi-triangle that stood proudly on his sternum. The suit would envelope his body when Tony tapped it twice. It was striking, like seeing the sky for the first time. It would glow blue, then the suit would form over his body. There was only one word for it: ingenious.
On the north side of the office hangs the first painting that Steve completed since waking up from ice. It’s Stark Tower against the rest of New York. Tony had insisted that Steve bring it to the Compound. He had elbowed Steve on the side and joked, “Bring it with you, let them see you can make something pretty and that you’re not just good at throwing your shield, Cap.”
“Could you and I do more? Should I put on the suit and tell Carol I want in on the roster?”
“Tommy, this isn’t a joke.” Natasha frowns.
Most times, he walks deep into the night, patrolling — there’s no other word for it. He walks city perimeters, checks roads without street lamps. Stops bar fights, ensuring that a group of rowdy teenagers make it home safe, prevents looting of corner shops. Just small things, no more superhero-level missions.
It’s too hot. Summer in the west means everyone will be in the saloon, drinking cold beer.
By tomorrow night, Steve would already be packing his meager duffle bag and heading out.
One of Steve's favorite things about the future was Tony Stark.
“You know, we could hire a cleaner. They’d come everyday. You wouldn’t have to bend over the tub to get the soap scum off.” Tony hummed, rubbing Steve’s chest. “Wait, nevermind, I like you bending over.”
“That’s not the only way to fight climate change you know,” he deadpans. He claps his hands and disappears from the room. “Shower and dinner. Easy, easy.”
The colors of the sky turn into a hazy, pale pink hue. A patch of thick clouds interrupts the picturesque imagery, and slowly, the blue descends until the sky is black and grey, a curtain lit only by the distant stars.
That night, Tony engulfs him in a deep, tight embrace. He slots himself behind Steve and snakes his arm around Steve’s belly and whispers how it’s alright, he understands why Steve cried, he doesn’t have to explain, and when Steve cries furthermore, Tony hushes him with a kiss on the nape of his neck.
Tony dreams of the rats in the Mansion and the burns on the ruined sofa. The wreckage.
Tony pats Steve’s chest, cradles his face, trying to stop his tears from falling. “I liked it. You’d know that.” It was too good to be true, Tony understands this. “You’d know, if you were him.”
He really wished that he was still drunk because if he had to look at Steve, he might take the nail gun again and staple his eyes shut.
Steve’s head is tilted, expression changing inch by inch, thawing into something warm, something recognizable. Almost like they’re remembering they’re in love and that they love each other.
They're sitting in the destruction of what used to be home and Steve still smells the same way he always has: sweaty, masculine, and if hope had  a scent, it would be this.
Around and around it goes, a sequence of cells working in tandem to tell him he’s a dying soul.
“It’s the principle of the thing, Tony.”
His time will come, too. But hopefully not for a long, long while.
“Oh, shut up.” Tony opened his mouth as Morgan fed him blueberries. He chewed slowly. “You wanted to punch me in the face. You said, ‘big man in an iron suit, take it off and what are you?’ Now that I think about it, I think you just wanted my clothes off.”
He set one mug on the side table for Steve. He took a sip of coffee. It had a splash of milk, just the way he liked it. The fact that Tony knew the way he liked his coffee made him feel warm, despite the severity of the situation. Tony couldn’t have known, but he did. Maybe he learned it during their mission debriefs. Still, the face that someone who didn’t have to keep track of such a trite, ordinary, fact, warmed him. It was like they were friends. Maybe they could be.
He pried the remaining nail from his forearm. Dried blood flaked on the sink as he dropped it on the counter. He stared at his reflection and saw everything he hated in this world.
“Simple and easy, baby.” Tony kisses his cheek and Morgan soon follows suit. They spend too much time coddling and cuddling Steve because this is what he needs when he’s overwhelmed with happiness.
Now, it’s a blessing to share the same space. Them, in this car with only the console between them, less than a foot away from each other. He’s just a touch away. Steve could reach over, but Tony’s already turning his gaze back to the road and buckling his seat belt.
“Yeah?”
“You know America is gonna be pissed you didn’t say goodbye,” Riri says, and it’s only when she’s putting her hands on her hips does Steve realize the statement is directed to him.
Steve didn’t try to correct him.
He and Tony had such funny kids. Morgan loved doing cartwheels and fancied herself as a gymnast one day, then she’d spend afternoons turning the pages to classic texts and called herself a poet. Harley and Peter were cut from the same thread, finishing each other’s sentences that Tony wondered if they shared a brain.
In one reality, I didn't survive the initial Extremis injection. It might have been for the best. I don't know what being human is anymore, Steve. Men make monsters in the image of their adversaries. Humans tell stories about God. I look at the mirror and all I see is me. More wrinkles in the corners of my eyes. Fuck up, fuck up again. Maybe I'm the only one that notices it. No, that’s not true. The whole world knows. Are people always so critical of their reflection? When you brushed your teeth in the mornings and stared at yourself in the dirty mirror of your shitty apartment, did you ever resent the world for demanding too much out of you?
Steve boxed Tony’s face with his arms and stared at him. He’s so in love it hurts.
This is easy. Ask about the weather in the winter and if it’s still unbearable for Tony who’s spent years in California. Ask about new schematics for the suit. Ask about everyone else. Ask and listen before Tony asks, so Steve never has to give him answers he doesn’t have.
A finger breaches him, soaked with spit. Steve presses in and out, scissoring him open. He adds another, there’s a fumble behind him, and cold, lubed fingers pressing back in.
Tony’s belly heats up in anger, fucking Victor tried to make a move on him. Fuck, he could have been date raped or tortured or ended up in a ditch somewhere. He doubted Doom had the balls to do anything so asinine, he would have probably just made Tony talk about Stark Tech.
Steve slouches against the barstool and feels decidedly useless.
And yet, he sits in this cafe, unaccompanied, with only a duffle bag of dirty clothes, a loaded gun he’s never used, and a backpack that contains the remains of his old uniform.
“Steve, baby, more.”
“Always.” Tony made himself comfortable on Steve’s lap and sipped his coffee, sighing with every sip. Once he was done with his cup, Steve diligently reached for the French Press and refilled it to the brim. “Love you, Steve.”
“Morning, Red Wolf.” Tony rolls the pipe between his fingers, observing the way Tommy Shepard’s ragtag group of friends mess with the horses at a distance. “You alright?”
There's only the stick-shift between them and Steve wants nothing more than to reach over, grab Tony's hand, ask him to say something, anything to fill the silence.
“Oh, I, no. I’m sorry.”
Sam and Bucky stand beside him. Iz, Augusto, and Angel sit on the front row, all waving and giving him a thumbs up. Steve laughs, and it’s just then, he realizes he’s crying. It’s true, he’s a cry baby, but he’s smiling as he turns to face Tony.
Steve stood awkwardly on the sidewalk, hands in his pocket, then, they were sitting by the shoreline, side by side. Steve looked anxious and confessed some blurry things about the war. Tony doesn’t know, he thought Steve was nice and helpful. A goddamn Captain.
Steve kisses his shoulder and falls asleep.
That’s the ocean and that’s life. Steve’s understood that long ago. He couldn’t stop nature but he sure as hell tried.
Tony likes Steve messy with the taste of him, evidence of debauching perfect, pristine Captain America, making Steve suck his cock. Tony moans with the thought, doubles his effort in trying to peel off Steve's shirt. He doesn’t succeed because their angles are all wrong but they’re desperate to feel each other. No matter. Their lips lock again and Tony cedes control to Steve.
Tony used to trim his goatee every morning, making precise cuts before tousling his hair with a touch of product. Sometimes, he caught Steve admiring him from the mirror and winked. Steve looked at the mirror, but he was alone. No Tony. Just Steve.
“You’re wrong, you know.” Steve shoves a hand into his pocket, shoves one of the xanax pills into his mouth and swallows. His nerves are all on fire and despite the coolness of the ocean, he’s hot all over. “You know someone when you’re hopeless about them.”
While he’s out there, being an unoriginal vagabond, here’s Tony Stark rebuilding his home, planting roots, a little too raw, if Steve’s guess is correct.
“I can belong anywhere as long as it's beside you.” Tony straddled Steve’s thighs. He kissed Steve’s cheek with a loud smack. “I love you, Steve.”
“There was work to be done.”
Steve shook his head. “No, but I had a guess.”
“I don’t think it matters, pops. As long as you start somewhere.”
He was rescued him nearly a decade ago, and yet he sits here, smoking a mix of tobacco and hash like he’s still suspended in ice.
“Why not?” Morgan and Harley asked at the same time.
But no, he remembers now.
There’s tiny scars on the back of his hand. A burn on his index finger. On his left wrist is a crescent moon shaped scar. Then, on his chest, a scar like the sun bursting to life. Steve tried to destroy that once. He didn’t mean to, but it happened all the same.
“They wouldn’t stop pestering us. Though, I do appreciate their dedication to the cause. That’s enlightening to see. Makes their defeat much more satisfying.”
He’s heard this one before. In another country, another cafe, another bar keeper with knowing eyes.
“J, baby, can you wake the kids and tell them to meet us in the bedroom? And if Harley makes a fuss, tell him his papa bear made bacon with maple-syrup.” Tony grabbed Steve’s arm and led them to the bedroom. It was a slow walk for Tony. He was always exhausted these days. He leaned against Steve and started humming their favorite song.
“Honey, did you forget to tell me that we were having friends over?”
Natasha looks pleased to see him.
“I know you are. I know.” She gives him a sad smile. “So, on a lighter note.” She snaps her fingers twice and a holo-screen appears. “There’s been sightings of Clint out there in the West.”
“You just gamble your heart away when you hope.” Tony looks away and pushes his plate away. He stands without a second glance, and Steve wants nothing more than to make him stay put, so he says, “does that still stop you?”
No, he didn’t want to upset Tony. Steve shook his head, tried to focus. For fucks, sake. Tony was the one with—
Along with the smell of the freshwater, there’s the sound of nature: the birds chitter with his family’s laughter.
He doesn’t say, instead, Steve swallows, looks at the ocean adrift. “I want to be desperately needed. In the Army, I had that. There was the routine of ensuring everyone was alive, cared for. Now, I’m here. I need something else.” Steve sighs, he’s said too much. In the sand, Tony finds his hand and squeezes it. “You’re too trusting.”
—will be forever seared into Steve’s head.
“Heal yourself,” Steve commanded. “You can still do that, can’t you?”
“I’ll be here just until the day after,” Steve says in a rush. He doesn’t want to overstay his welcome.
There's no doubt who that table belongs to.
Steve should have said no.
“Nat.”
“Er, just,” he struggles for words and gestures with his spoon. “Tony saying that.”
And yet.
But that’s if Steve needed help. He was fine. He was here grudgingly at Pepper and Bucky’s insistence.
But like everyday for the last forty-one months, Steve woke up alone in a house they built together. And things would never be alright.
She snorts. “It’s a simple yes or no.”
“Nah, he was a crazy son of a bitch.” Tony pockets the pipe and glances back at the Sheriff’s Station, missing how Rogers used to stand out in the patio with both hands on his belt like a goddamn sovereign subject.
“I thought you said I’m a good man.”
“Shut up.” Tony jogs down the sidewalk and into the intersection to beat the flashing light.
“Thank you. For this life. For this chance. For everything we have here.”
Except, ever the futurist, his vision proved false because Steve is dead. Feasted on by a hoard of wild pigs.
“They were your friends,” Tony gasps the words out, and it hurts to talk when his voice has been unused for days. When his mouth is nothing but a hole to fuck. He refuses to look at Steve, stops himself from looking away. “How could you? They were your friends! They were your team! Family, how could —“
The stairs of the entrances always led him down that awful night with him, barely a man, still growing taller and taller, shoulders broadening, being led by a petite police officer to the corner of the station.
The pain under his eyes is manageable. It grows steady as the hours pass. He is used to hunger now. But it's been over a week since he last had a meal.
“Steve,” he calls out sometime later. Because he’s foolish and he wants to see Steve one more time, tomorrow, the next day. He hopes he’ll wake up still in Steve’s arms, wishing that he’ll turn around tomorrow morning and see those blue eyes and remember them without anger. “What was it—what couldn’t you say earlier?”
He’s crying again. His fingers are numb as they hang limply and he can’t even stand anymore.
“God, they never told me babies poop so much.” Tony snorted, holding up two diapers and waving it around the room. “And, you could barely tell. Babies are just this pudgy mess of limbs and poop.”
“Thinking too much fucks you up.”
“Are you not happy alone?”
He stops when he catches Tony’s duffel bag. It’s still there, right where he left it. It’s zippers wide open to reveal neatly folded clothes and several pairs of rolled up socks.
“Hey, Manchurian Candidate, have you ever had Mexican food?” Tony grunted, face twisting in pain. “I’m starved. I’ll have to call in advance to make sure they’ve got enough food for two super-soldiers though.”
Harley eyed them cautiously, then pulled Morgan’s feet up before sliding it under him. He faced Steve with searching eyes, then dropped his head on Steve’s chest.
If you were here… I could almost hear your voice, telling me,
It was Christmas again. How many Christmases did he spend without Tony, when they were both out of touch with each other, living their own lives apart across many states? When Steve was under ice? How long did they spend apart when Steve was in DC and Tony was flying back and forth between Malibu and Manhattan?
“I’m happy for you, Tony. That you have people.”
“Sometimes I’m scared too,” he admits because losing this quiet life they’ve built is always a possibility. “You deserve so much more than me.”
It isn’t until they’re moving him to another room, “clean sheets,” Steve had promised the night before when Tony finally orgasmed, that he sees the photographs lining the hallway.
He tunes out the sounds of Tony's slurping and groaning as he eats out Rumiko’s cunt. Steve focuses on the swell of Tony's ass, stroking the back of his thighs, running his free hand up to Tony's shoulder blades. When Steve gets to Tony's nape, he scratches at the place behind his ear and tells himself that the responsive moan is for him. Steve twists the hand fucking Tony, thrusting in deeper. He loses himself in the sensation, dipping down to lick at Tony’s crack. He bites the inside of his mouth, holding back a groan. Steve wishes he could be loud, say all the things that Rumiko is telling Tony. But he can’t. He can’t.
they have both lost is a dull ache.
My reflection is this dead man’s bloody face and one blue eye.
Half the universe is gone and the world keeps turning. In the beginning, he suspected that they’d never recover, but slowly, the world stitches itself together, and while the heaviness of loss is present in each street he’s ever walked, Tangiers reminds him that there’s still a life to live.
The come on his thighs are flaky and he doesn’t mind it anymore.
“No, no, not without you.” Steve’s used to crying in front of his friends now, so he didn’t try to stifle the sobs erupting from his chest. He kissed Tony. Both their faces were wet with tears. “There’s no life without you.”
You can't keep chasing after ideals, Steve. If we live in ideals, we'll never get anything done. Never satisfied. There's no moral high ground when we've all got blood on our hands. That's the price, Steve. The currency is sacrifice. It's your ideal that I hold onto now. I can't meet that expectation of heroism or make things right. But I will try.
“Alright, fine. But when Pops acts like this.” Harley waved the box. “I just—I don’t—I don’t understand. He didn’t even pick this out. He wasn’t even here to choose this for me.” He shoved the box back, hitting Steve’s knee.
“I can almost feel your loving arms again.” Steve finished the song and dropped a kiss to Tony’s cheek. He caressed Tony’s jaw, then leaned down to nip at it. “Why’d you get up? You could have waited in the bedroom. I was almost done.”
Steve shakes his head. “I didn’t think —“
“What can I say? Deflection and distraction works wonders.” Tony punched him lightly, pouting. He was damn handsome with a suit, but Steve preferred this: Tony Stark in sweats with mused hair, goatee needing trimming to keep the lines precise. “I’m a bad man, Steve, you should know that by now. Merchant of Death, they called me.”
"Steve, fuck," Tony choked out. It was always a beautiful scene to see him fall apart. Tony groaned, rocking up and down furiously, driving Steve crazy. He spilled between them and the water washed away the spunk. He wished he could lick it off before it reached the drainage.
Eventually, Steve follows an unpaved path two blocks from the residential area and stumbles upon a creek after circling the vicinity for miles and miles. He’s finally sweating now. His hair, too long and damp, a drop of sweat making a home in his thick beard.
Steve,
Steve smiles, trails open mouthed kisses down Tony’s neck. “Tony, you’re so perfect. Like a dream. A goddamn dream.”
Settle down, Clint had told him, get a life.
“Steve.” Tony sighed and slowed his thrusts. He dropped Steve’s leg from his shoulder and leaned forward. Fucking in slow and deep. “No.  I’m alive, baby. We have the rest of our lives.”
He parks the car, and has the half-thought to run over and open Tony’s door. But he doesn’t. Instead, he walks into the hotel entrance with Tony a step behind him.
God, what Steve would do to hold Tony in his arms again.
It’s always empty now.
meaning all the grieving books and articles he’s consulted.
Carol loomed over him and refused to look away. She balled her fists and he really wished she'd stop staring at him in pity. Was this how she’d felt when Tony had showed up at her house, pulled the faceplate up and begged her to get help? Possibly, he thought, he must have been full of shit.
“Well, that must mean people will listen because it’s on the paper,” Tony deadpans, wishing like hell that Rogers was still around to get on his high horse to pacify the rumblings of the townsfolk.
Steve laughed with glee. Tony was so cute when he blushed.
Then, once Steve ran out of tasks, he opened the medicine cabinet.
“Eh,” Peter reached for another piece of bacon with a shrug.
Tony pulled the ends of Steve’s hair, an intimate act, they’ve done over so many years. He wished they had this in their future too. “Yes, we have the rest of our lives, Steve. Let’s just go through this. It’s just another mission. Something we gotta do, then we’ll debrief, and be back home in no time.”
There’s no other explanation to it, and Tony cannot bear to think that this is a dream.
Tony is shaking. The arches of his feet ache from standing for the last few days. When sleep comes, it’s short and restless. The muscles under his armpits are pulled tighter and tighter the longer he stays suspended.
“What? Overbearing?” That’s what Harley’s taken to calling him. Peter would twist his lips into a frown and scratch his head. At least Morgan just took it in stride when Steve double checked that she had her phone, that her temperature was normal, that they were healthy. “Be an asshole to my friends who are just trying to help? I know, I see it all. Sorry. I just don’t know… how to…It’s hard to do this. It’s difficult to live, Nat. It really is.”
“He’s always wandering.” The man reaches for something on the porch. It’s a blunt; he blows the smoke to the side, and looks up at Steve, measuring. “You a cop?”
“I was traveling too. Doing what I can to make up for all the things I've done. All the damage I caused. Repenting." Bruce stops and plucks a handful of rosemary. He turns them over for Steve to smell. "But for what," he continues, a crease on his face. "For being alive? I can't help what I am, but I can do something in the world, right?
Tony rocked forward, and licked Steve’s mouth open.
It’s where it belonged.
“Does it matter?” Steve twists his hand.
It’s a few minutes past midnight when Steve makes it down to the workshop.
steve, steve, steve, steve, steve, steve,
His kidneys will cease function. There will be chemical changes to his body. The pain will transform into a dull ache, and perhaps, the next time he sees Steve, it will be by living with the memory of them on the 890th.
When Steve turns back to Tony, there’s a deprecating smile on his face. It’s wrong. Steve is a man who should always wear a genuine smile. Tony used to think there wasn’t a single bad atom in Steve’s body. Maybe he’s wrong about that too.
Is he supposed to crack his ribs open now, hasn’t Tony know it’s already fractured? That Steve himself is just a fragment of who he was, the man they think he is, the man he’s supposed to be?
Shellhead
There is so much—there
someone more than you needed to live? To love someone with your bones and your flesh and all of what makes you who you are and how much of a goddamn happy thing it is when they love you the same way? You can’t get that again, even if you try.”
It’s been forty-one months without Tony and he’s alright. Steve was going to make it. He’ll wake up tomorrow and continue to live another forty-one months. Then, another three decades after that. Time would stretch on, but he knew one thing is certain: everytime he closes his eyes, he’ll see Tony’s smirk, his wide-eyes, surprised, happy.
They didn’t know if he made it.
He lies on the floor, waiting to be used.
I could be bleeding from every hole. My mouth. My ass. My nose.
He’s in Venice again, this time in jeans and a button-down shirt. He tried wearing sandals and shorts, the uniform of the common Los Angeles man, but it isn’t him. He’s resigned to sticking out. All his life, he wanted to be someone — not known by the world, not like Tony Stark. But he’s wanted to be someone who mattered.
“Excellent idea.”
“For you.” Steve dropped the crown on Tony’s head. “You look like you belong here. Pretty, naked, mine.”
They were happy, or so Tony thinks.
Then, Steve cried. Tears streamed from his face. He could only tell the difference between the shower’s water and his tears because of the taste of salt.
Steve fucks him into the night, opening him up with careful fingers, like it’s the first time all over again. He takes his time scissoring Tony open, licking when his fingers aren’t enough.
“Yes it is.”
“That’s right.”
"My brain is overriding the back-up. It knows what happened. It’s been trying to supply me the information. Sometimes all I see are pictures, scenes without no words. Sometimes all I hear are conversations on a loop.”
“Bullshit.”
“I’m good.”
He’s lived a full life, and there’s more to look forward to.
The track is vast, just like the rest of the Compound. It’s filled with bedrooms and labs and conference rooms and an indoor gym and, and, and…the list goes on. It’s got everything one of their line of work would request to live comfortably.
He's always understood death. Cessation of life. Putting the muzzle on his forehead, no safety needed.
It was as if they both already knew they’d fill up the rooms.
Husband. With that word, Steve’s knees always go weak and his heart stutters in his chest. Tony gets whatever he wants whenever he uses that word to refer to Steve, so instead of blushing embarrassment, he simply bends down, grabs Tony by the arm and leg lifts him up in a fireman’s carry.
“I don’t know what that means,” Tony says and it’s the truth. What he knows is that he’s woken up in the morning to look at Steve’s bright yellow toothbrush beside his blue one. It’s dry and unused for weeks.
love you. I don’t think I’ll ever stop.”
“I hope so,” she replied. “Do you want back up?”
He doesn’t miss Steve Rogers.
“Really, Victor?” Tony deadpans, spins to face the man and proceeds to kick him on the shin. “I don’t want to fucking see your face, take a message. It’s never gonna happen.”
He’s wanted this for ages, an entire decade. There’s no doubt that Steve will want this for the rest of his life, too, but that’s all it will be: a craving forever unsatisfied.
Steve pops in, greets the lone barkeeper who appears to double as the waiter. He waves a hand and signals for Steve to pick a seat.
“Yeah, pops, but we have now. We have today, tomorrow. We’re still here. Morgan, Harley, me. Uncle Rhodey, Bucky, Sam. Aunt Carol, Nat, and Pepper. We’ll be here the next day, the day after,” Peter mumbled on Steve’s shirt. “You have us.”
“They were your friends!” Tony screams. “Your team, your people. They looked up to you.”
Tony pats his back pocket, likely looking for cash, and Steve’s just about to tell him that it’s rather insulting, Victoria waves him off with a raised eyebrow. “You worked on the car, this is them paying you back. I’m no delivery service.”
He gritted his teeth and put his head between his knees. His entire body felt like it was on fire.
Steve laughs, both hands gripping his belt buckle. “You like saying my name.”
It's alright, Tony will lie to himself and pretend the world has been overtaken by Skrulls instead. He's still in the helicarrier now. Still Director, and Maria Hill will come any minute now, rip his ass for doing another wrong thing.
He will never tire of those pale blue eyes. Back in the day, Tony couldn't stand Steve's gaze, especially not when he had stood over Tony's sluggish body, twisting his lips in a grimace when Tony couldn't respond due to his drunk-addled brain.
It was alright, they’d believe it. His brain had holes and kept feeding him his mistakes in a loop.
When I inevitably fall asleep tonight, I hope I dream of you.
He can’t help but feel grateful that she has let him go, allowing him to live a life of his own choosing without making him question his choices. They’ve always had mutual respect for each other, and it’s only now that he’s face with her sharp, knowing eyes and quick wit does he realize he won’t leave the Compound unscathed.
“Papa,” Morgan climbed on his lap. He didn’t even notice that most of the table had cleared, save for Bucky and Rhodes glancing at him in concern.
“Just relax, I have you, I’ll take care of you, sweetheart.” Steve says, pushing Tony's chest back to the floor. He scratches at Tony's pubes, enjoying the feeling of it against his chest. Soon, Tony’s attempts to call out Steve’s name stops, but he’s still writhing, fingers flexing on the sand.
“It has to be,” Steve argued, sporting a tired smile. “We’ll go from here.”
“I’m fine.” Tony glares, uncertain of how to respond. His fingers itch for his breast pocket, only to find his usual flask absent. He drops his head on the wooden beam, wishing he would be brave enough to bash it in. He’s damned tired of the waves of nausea that never seems to end. “Who said anything about love?”
Chop chop chop, then Tony’s turning and he’s got a Spider-Man apron on and his quips with Riri and Kate are lightning quick.
“Steve.”
There was once a time, kissing Steve might have soothed the thunder erupting in his belly, the worry rooted in his chest.
They question him about his travels, and when Steve’s lost for words to describe what he’s done, they wait. He stumbles upon descriptions of suburbs, unincorporated towns, and villages across the world, offering what little has to give. He doesn’t say much.
“Are you done?” Tony asks, and he’s not crying anymore but his face feels tight and his eyes still sting. Steve isn’t any better. He’s seen this man cry over the years, but now, Steve won’t even give him an inch.
It's a surprise he can still cry. But here he is, staring back at Steve, willing reason to dawn on him.
“Admit it. I am. I know it. I’m not denying it,” she says.
He didn’t want to tell her about heaven. Tony Stark was a scientist and so were their children. They believed in what was observable, replicable, what could be proven and debunked. Despite the fact that they met aliens, gods, and superhumans, the notion of heaven seemed too much like faith, something too philosophical. Steve didn’t even believe in heaven anymore.
It’s selfish. He shouldn’t be selfish. He has his children. But it’s the truth.
“Like what?” Steve had asked.
He bursted through the door, pushing it hard enough to pop a screw out and pull the taped Christmas tinsel from the door. “Why do you have to do that, Tony? You could have gotten seriously hurt!”
He was informed that a parade was scheduled that day since the memorial service wasn’t open to the public. New York did its thing—it marched and mourned the death of their resident superhero.
provided advice, words of comfort.
Sure, he has declared himself as a genius, billionaire, philanthropist in their first meeting years ago. And sure, Steve’s taken offense at the blasé statement, but he’s learned soon after that it was what it was, just a factual statement. Not meant for offense.
Tony entertained the thought that maybe he could be like Maya Hansen and slit his wrist, watch the waters turn pink with his blood. Except, he wouldn’t be like Maya where it’s all pretend, a photograph doctored to trick him.
“Oh,” he said, not really concerned about Bucky or Natasha.
“I hope so,” Tony laughed. “God, I’m a little fucked in the head because I’m expecting something bad to happen. Things can’t always be perfect, can they?”
“Thanks, Mr. Stark,” the kid says, standing up and offering Tony a hand.
Steve tried to hold back the tears, but he has never been strong. He ignored the burn in his lungs and took a deep breath. “The first time?” He turned to Peter and Harley.
Yeah. Tony will be alright.
“Give it a try, it might do you some good.”
Tony slurs, drained, ignoring Steve’s semen mixing with the piss on the floor.
“New Asgard,” Bruce replies.
He’d treat Tony better. Steve won’t be like Stone, Stane, and all those vultures who wanted to take away the fire in Tony’s eyes. Tony deserved the world and Steve would make sure he got it.
“Nat,” he says, clenching his jaw. He feels tension on his back. Natasha drops her facade and raises an eyebrow. “I’m still learning.”
“Why wouldn’t it be?” Tony grabs a paperboy from the side table and waves it at Steve. “This should hold you over for now.” Tony throws him the bagel, underhanded.
Steve’s smiling, and it isn’t Steve, not the Steve he knows. All of Tony’s thoughts circle around those five letters. The single syllable he doesn’t allow himself to utter anymore.
“Did Carol send you?”
“I’m going to Tony Stark’s.” He paused by the door and straightened. “I’m going to tell him what we found. He could help us.”
Steve has heard the gossip and awe over the ring, the envy over what a handsome couple they make, the adoration of the heir and the heiress redefining Stark-Fujikawa as something beyond a mere business partnership.
It wasn’t. It isn’t. It’s the same now.
But the curtain has risen and the beasts have been unveiled.
“Promise you’ll try, then.”
“We still could, Tony, please listen, you have to know that—”
Now, years after that very moment in the bright lights of the Compound’s bathroom, he’s only trimmed it because it serves as an easy disguise. No one looks at Steve a beat too long, and if they do, it has nothing to do with his past as Captain America.
Morgan makes a face and hastily deposits the paper bag filled with soap, then gets the other bag and grabs her child sized burrito, courtesy of Iz. “Yours is in the bag, dad.”
“Please, Ru, I need more. More.”
Now, Steve thinks about how stupid it was to smash it into pieces and leave it in rain-soaked park bench.
“Still.” He can’t help but feel like he should have put in an effort. Hell, he should have planned this, he could have.
He pulled Tony’s ass-fitting trousers down, a little tempted to just rip his pants off.
“You’re so weird. Jesus, whoever said you were charming obviously didn’t see you like this.” Tony pointed at Steve before making a sharp left to the entrance of Central Park.
“And then?”
“Tony?”
They were stuck in the glass, laying in their own funeral beds without Tony inside them.
“As it should be,” Carol says. Rhodes pinches her and she swats him in retaliation.
Steve wraps his arms over his chest, wondering what he’ll do if he’s not on the road, if there’s any job in town for him. “I’m in no rush to be anywhere else.”
In the end, they nod and let him trail off.
Steve kissed his collarbone, blissed out from coming. But one thought rang loud and clear: he wants to be the perfect husband, too.
Tony is doing better, his sleep is still disturbed, so he spends nights pacing the workshop, pretending that Steve isn't just across the way.
“Next thing I know, my husband is gonna take up beekeeping too.”
Steve didn’t let it heal. He picked at it in the evenings in bed, turning over memories that refused to fade away. That’s one thing he was grateful for—eidetic memory. Tony may be memorialized in books, essays, and street art, but there were memories that belonged just to Steve. Like the way Tony woke up in the morning and how he turned his wedding band when he was thinking.
Tony paws at his chest, he pushes a little bit, so Steve leans back to catch his wrists. “You want this right?”
At one time, Steve had thought that the unabashed quality of his opinions were brusque, but Steve has learned since then. Sometimes, Tony allows himself to shed the layers of persona he's had to wear as another version of armor, and when the mask is pulled away, the sight of truth is lovely.
“No, you’re —“ Steve pinches the bridge of his nose, then walks to the table with caution. Tony pulls out a chair, sits, and opens the containers. He rummages the paper bag for the plate and utensils. “We can’t keep dancing around this, you know. You have things to say, I know you do.”
Tony’s laughing again. Steve will never get tired of the sound.
Everyday, Steve wakes up with the chance of dying. But this is what it must be like to kill yourself little by little. Inch by bloody inch. It’s like standing on a cliff, knowing you’ll jump because at the bottom of the precipice might be some form of peace.
Why does it have to be like this, he doesn’t ask.
This, along with the following chapters, took me longer than expected to edit. Sorry about the wait! I know this fic. I can smell this fic. I can taste this fic. This fic means a lot to me. I promise it will be finished. My friends know the long rants I go on about this fic. Please be patient with me. Thanks very much for reading. As always, comments and kudos make my heart sing. I'd like to know what you think about stevetony!
He’s done what’s right, and he’s all alone.
They get married in the fall, just as Tony suggested months ago. Surprisingly, no one tries to stop them. He half expected someone to pull Tony aside and call him crazy for remarrying, and at that, a man who’s betrayed him, hurt him, and loved him all the same. But no one did. Instead, all their friends smiled, muttered under their breathes,
“Sure, that’s what we wanna hear,” Kate muses. “Approval from Cap.”
Tony blanches, shakes his head wildly, then grips Steve’s hand towards him. “Steve, no. Of course, not. I’m happy you’re here, I am truly.”
The nooses are already tied, hanging loosely on Its neck.
Steve’s chest twisted. He wasn’t part of inside jokes, but that’s alright, he was content on being on the sidelines. He and Tony had their own park bench, their own shared histories, and plans for the future. Everything was fine, and for once, Steve wasn’t scared of the unknowable future.
Tony eyed him with something Steve couldn’t define. Hope, maybe.
The ghosts kept laughing, haunting him, and Carol’s presence made it all worse.
It’s just a green body, spoiling under the sun.
Coke gives him clarity and it's pretty fucking amazing in the first half-hour, but then, as the night wears on, he's snorting another on someone's stomach or fingernail, and it's a harder chase. He wakes up on the floor to a random house or by the beach. Sometimes, he'll be home with Ty snoring beside him. He doesn't fucking know what he's doing, but sometimes, the buzz slows him down, just like smoking gives him something to do with his hands. Otherwise, he'd be twisting them. Maybe, there should be a healthier way to deal with life. Shit, the pressure of being Stark Industries new face, serving as CEO, and trying to do right by the world. Fuck. Tony puts the end of his palms and presses his eyes.
Steve lets the sound of children bickering by the alcove and the hodgepodge of languages distract him for a brief moment. Elementary children run up and down the narrow stairs. One child skips to the balcony and beckons the others. Mothers scold them with tea in one hand before turning to resume a conversation with their companion. There are men beside him smoking cigars.
He ran up the attic, took a couple empty boxes, and returned to his bedroom closet.
“Fuck my mouth.” Tony kneeled down and guided Steve’s cock past his lips. He began sucking and swirling his tongue over the head.
Sometimes, he thinks he’d rather drown. Should have drowned back with Valkyrie.
There are other phrases for it now, nearly three years later: the Snap. Journalistic accounts call it The Decimation. Others refer to it as the Blip.
“Where to, Cap?”
Tony had kept his faceplate down so Steve couldn’t see him cry.
He cannot help it, he has to ask, “Are you —“ Tony can’t call him Steve. “Is he —“
Tony dropped to the floor and eyed the puddle of vomit with barely a hint of disdain. He rolled over and found a bottle of rum. It was nearly empty, nothing left but a sip.
Steve offers him a hand, palms outstretched. The moment before Goliath’s death flashes, bright and vivid. Steve offers a hand, there’s that damned EMP. In the Mansion, Steve offers a hand.
Steve’s hands are much larger than Rumiko’s—and yet, here Tony is, taking more, more, and more.
Well. There wasn’t a body, but she was mourned by the world. Superhero, another one. A founding Avenger. Gone.
“Okay,” Tony says, nodding off, drifting back to sleep, the last thing he hears is
They have a newborn baby and two other children waiting for them at home. Fuck, what was Steve going to tell them? Peter’s six and brilliant. Steve couldn’t explain what cancer was. They’d probably ask him about cell division and the human body as an attempt to comprehend the state of their father’s—Tony’s—life.
The day passes, the sun sets.
It took all morning to get his fingers to let go of Tony’s suits. He’s surrounded by hangers and Tony’s collection of loafers. His silk ties. His yellow ACDC shirt, stained with holes. No, Steve couldn’t let go of everything. Not all at once.
Yet here he was, so close to having another breakdown during Christmas dinner.
He hasn’t said a single word to Tony all day. They’ve been in the company of others. Riri and Kate orbit around Tony. It’s warming to see them look at him with stars in their eyes, as if they’re starstruck and humbled by the man who makes this world something to fight for.
“You mean it?” He squats down and faces Morgan. He reaches for her, running a hand through her thick hair.
“Alert the press!” Tony forces out a laugh. It didn’t sound so jagged when he was drunk out of his mind.
“Where’d you go?” Samuel coughs and raises an eyebrow.
Stripped out of the cowl and stripes, just a simple man. A nobody.
But hell was a living creature and he’s woken up in the pits of its belly since Tuesday. Maybe even before. Maybe when the doctors showed him charts and told them about cancer.
He was in remission, then. Happy, healthy. Alive.
The mindset is different in New York and Los Angeles. But even then, Koreatown and Venice residents move to different spheres. When he heard of Los Angeles, he thought of Hollywood and all the glimmer and glitter of actors. Koreatown is a working class neighborhood that reminds him of Red Hook. Venice is something else.
He was exhausted. He wanted to drink himself to sleep and numb the roaring in his chest everytime the memories pressed at the base of his skull. “Carol, just go.”
Steve.
Steve almost laughs. “No. I’ve seen the world and it keeps turning and turning. The force of loss and grief isn’t enough to keep us still.”
One, two, three.
“I’m going to be like what,” Tony demands, seething.
“Can you call the kids?” Tony reached for him, putting their foreheads together. “I love you. I love you everyday.”
Crying made him feel worse. It took ages to settle his heart rate once the tears started. Rage soon followed. It was a never ending cycle of drowning in guilt and wrath.
“It’s been a beautiful fight.” She quirked her lips for a fleeting moment then walked them forward. “Still is. That’s Bukowski for you.”
This is unacceptable. Steve’s researched the man—Tiberus Stone—in these past few weeks. He’s the son of a wealthy businessman and runs in the same circles as Tony Stark. He was in the sex tape with Tony.
Tony was the one dying, yet here he was, asking Rhodes and Pepper to take care of Steve. Steve didn’t bother wiping his face, it’s been streaked endlessly the last few months, even more so these last 24 hours, where they all seemed to just hold their breaths, wondering when Tony would close his eyes for the final time.
Tony’s eyes are watering, but he soldiers on, determined. Steve wants to hold him, kiss him badly, tell him that he did the best and they’re all alive and well because of him, but he doesn’t.
Ordered some fried dumplings and ate standing on the corner of Worth Street. Funny, I stand in that through that intersection and that's the only time my life has some worth. Come on, old pal, let a man like me make jokes. I can picture your disgruntled expression now. An eyebrow slightly tilted up, that line under your left eye. I should stop talking to my old ghosts. You still appear, Steve, a shadow that follows. Extremis tells me that there’s nothing there. It’s just my brain sublimating, conflating my pathways, thoughts, and grief all culminating into this madness of seeing you. What the hell, Steve. I can’t tell you to go. You can’t stay. I’m stuck in this intersection, eating fried potstickers that I used to share with you.
Steve pressed their foreheads together and his breath ghosted over Tony’s face. He was shaking, pulling Tony into his arms, a half-embrace that didn't work because Tony’s limbs were heavy and fucked and he couldn’t raise his arms anymore, because the pain was suddenly too much.
He tears his eyes from the white plaster of the ceiling, glances at Steve. That ocean of blue. His ocean of blue. An ocean of trouble. He’s repeated this phase to Steve so many times before.  A quiet good morning, a murmured goodnight,
Steve spends sometime just watching the flow of the flowers against the wind. The creek is a murky green-brown color with the sun revealing the patches of algae and rocks in the swallow waters. For once, he itches to sketch out the scene. There's just shades of green. Steve wonders if it could be as easy as this: staying still against the wind with just colors and shapes surrounding him.
Waits.
Steve just shrugs, tries to smile. “New life. Someone told me that: New life.”
“Ah, I see. Couple’s trip across the country. How quaint. Romantic,” the man says with no sarcasm, just an observation. There’s a mischievous air to him now. He winks at Steve. “Valentine’s weekend already passed, you know.”
Tony isn’t used to this undivided attention. It’s as if Steve’s seeing too much of Tony, finding all the pockets of hope and despair that live inside him.
He sets the towel by the bed and quickly pulls the shorts up. The waistband snaps in place, and then Steve’s hanging up the towel and pulling at his own sheets. He turns off the lamp.
He should be asleep, but there was pain right above his eyebrows and under his eyelids and he wanted nothing more than to crawl out of bed and reach for another bottle. The balcony doors were shut, but the curtains were drawn, revealing the view of New York.
He’s painfully aware now: home isn’t a place; and it’s trite and rather boring, people have repeated the sentiment a million times.
Steve freezes on the spot.
“I’m fine.” Tony waves him away but makes no move to leave.
“And you were willing to enslave us for it.”
I insist on making this better. I’m not backing down. So, I’m here to tell you that even though I’m livid and disappointed, and sometimes I don’t want to see you, I still care. I’m not giving up on you. I know you’ve been here the last week. I was the one that sent Carol.”
“Why not?” Tony smiles, wide with teeth. They’re bright under the moonlight. “Do you really have no vices?” He narrows his eyes on Steve, still somewhat playful. “I don't trust a guy without a dark side.”
He woke up sweating with snot dripping from his nose. He was still on the floor. The room smelled so foul that he scrunched his nose and nearly gagged. It wasn't until he was in the bathroom looking at his reflection that he realized that the putrid smell was coming from him.
No, that’s wrong. Steve will soften the punches. If they ever come to killing each other at the end of this, he hopes it’ll be in Steve’s arms. What a way to die.
“This is the hardest thing I’ve ever done.” He swallowed, holding up the flowers and the arc reactor. Steve thought of Tony’s own words to him. “Letting him go is the hardest thing I’ll ever do.”
“Careful, partner. You might get Peacher Castle to travel all the way to this old town to ward off the devils.”
I deliver them: “Steve, Steve, please. Oh, oh.”
He gets the directions to Malibu from someone in the parking lot and takes the freeway until he exits to a long-winding street. From the distance, there’s the Stark Mansion, he’s read about in several spreads. Home. Maybe.
“I don’t have a reason to lie.” Steve tilted Tony’s chin and kissed both his eyes. Tony’s eyelashes fluttered under Steve’s own lips. “Plus, I can’t take the thought of you coming home late. I miss you all day.”
“Yeah, yeah.” He mumbled, sitting hiding his face on Morgan’s check. “Everything is fine.”
Waiting for his kids to stop crying for their father. Steve's also just waiting to die now.
Steve is almost jealous, almost, but he knows that Tony hides his feelings under an untouchable mask.
Steve doesn’t have any photographs and his sketchbook has been barely used these last couple of years. There are moments when he finds refuge in letting his fingers quickly sketch cityscapes, country roads, but those are far and between. He thinks if he starts, he might spill everything he’s carefully crafted and stored away.
“Because my father is dead.” He spat out, pushing away from Steve. “So why is this from
There’s three knocks on the door. Steve Rogers appears through the window, holding up a small cauldron.
“Oh.” The words echo in the quiet of the room.
“But,” he says, knowing that Tony will be up shortly and whining for his cup of coffee. Now, he’s gotta make breakfast for their entire lot.
“You have no idea what you’re talking about.” His voice is hard.
“No, no.” Steve’s eyes widen when I change back and wear Tony Stark’s face. I scramble on the tiles and press the blade on my face. I follow the slant on these cheekbones and this stupid jaw. I reach the other eye. “Not him. Don’t.”
Tony clicked play before Steve could respond. Steve forced himself to watch, alternating between the screen and Tony’s face.
Steve nodded, pushing his arms as leverage to shift so Tony could hit the right spot. “Yes, anything. You always do. I love—”
Victoria calls him as he climbs down the rickety stairs. She tries to pull him into a conversation about a program at the park tomorrow, but Steve just waves quickly, signals to his shoes, then breaks out into a run from the stairs.
Bit by bit, stitching themselves with trembling fingers. Steve thinks the needle and thread are too sharp these days.
“Well, Peter and his new beau Johnny Storm may be of age, but they’re still kids.”
“I want dad. Dad. Dad. He’s—he’s gone?” Her eyes were shut tightly and she shook with the force of her pain.
It feels like there’s lead pooling inside his belly. A cold, frightened emotion that has him pressing Steve back, fucking in deeper. He ignores it, focuses on the citrus smell of Steve, the tang of tobacco on his tongue, and reaches for his cock and chases his orgasm.
“No, that’s what we did five years ago. This is different.”
His foot is still on the break. It’s rather easy for him to turn reverse, the wheel left, and go west, away from the shining building, and back into the highway. He breathes out, stares at the distance.
It probably isn’t, but Tony doesn’t say that. He nods, turns his head and kisses Steve’s wrist, feels the beat of his heart. Tony wants to say yes, of course, it’s fine. He belongs to Steve, will probably always will. Instead, he smiles because sex is familiar. Even with the heaviness of the moment, Steve’s still hard. Still wants him, even after everything.
Tony twists, sitting up fully to watch Steve. He looks alive—he
He wants to demand answers because responsibilities isn’t good enough. They’ll always have responsibilities, it follows them from all corners, no matter how far they travel. It’s always there. But Steve swallows down the retorts, the pointed questions. He has no right to ask.
In the end, his dark curls faded into something lighter over the years.
Thank you so much for reading. I hope you enjoyed this chapter. Kudos and comments = love :)
Bruce gives him a sad smile. It irritates Steve. "How was it like to sleep in ice?"
Steve doesn’t reply, but he meets Tony’s eyes and it’s another storm raging. Tony almost thinks Steve will hit him. He has.
“Hmm.”
“I’m sorry, I—wish I could wake up next to you tomorrow.”
“But you disagree,” Tony breathes out, tearing his eyes away from the counter to look at Steve.
With Ru beside him, Tony had felt a little braver. But he was never at ease because if you let your walls down, you allow people to crawl inside your body and sometimes all they want to do is live in your bones, until you don’t realize they’re there at all. And once they become part of you, it’s hard to ask them to leave.
The Ricards’ were in and out of town, but Reed promised to run a test on all returnees after he finished work with Banner and Dr. Strange at the Savage Mountains.
There are no clocks. There’s a bed he hasn’t been allowed to use since Steve chained him.
“It’s too presumptions of me to ask you to, yeah.” Tony eyes the strands of hair curling against Steve’s ears. That usually happens after he stripped the cowl back. Even now, Tony wants to run his fingers through it.
It’s alright. Steve tells himself to get a fucking grip and do some actual fucking. He came here for a goddamn reason and he’s not leaving until he gets it done.
“My apologies, dear friend!” Thor yells out.
He’s not even sure if the man owns the house, much less lives there. But Steve takes it as permission to go inside anyway. He enters the foyer. The stereos blast some Santana song. He knows this one because a Private used to blast the CDs. He nods his head at the right beats, passing a group of dancing women. He sees it before he feels it—someone claps his shoulders. Their breath smells of cigars. They pass him a beer bottle.
The seat in front of him is pulled up, then, there’s a heavy sigh that echoes his own.
working his body, Steve learning what degree his back arches, Steve learning at what pressure he starts to curl his toes.
He doesn’t know how long they stay there, but their breaths settle. Steve presses his ears on Tony’s chest and listens to Tony’s heartbeat. “Thank you,” he says, grabbing Tony’s wrist and kissing it. When Steve finally raises his head, Tony is asleep and his eyes are wet, possibly from the force of his orgasm.
Steve turns him and hooks a finger under his jaw. He wipes Tony’s tears away. “Don’t you want me like this? He always noticed, you know, the way you looked at him, how your heart accelerated when he got near. The crinkle of your eyes, he catalogued it, stored it in his head, turned it over and over in a loop when sleep wouldn’t come. He loved you. And I? I get to enjoy you.”
“Did we—? Nevermind, actually don’t answer that.” Tony shakes his head and plasters a smile on his face. It wouldn’t do well to ask this man if they fucked last night. No, he couldn’t remember much last night, but he can vividly recall his judgement on Steve.
“Alright, Peter. I’ll try.”
Maybe he could convince Morgan and Pepper to take him to Saks Fifth someday. He’ll fill out all of the empty spaces in the closet with things that belonged to him.
It’s Tuesday again.
He couldn’t do this anymore. He couldn’t, he’d already fallen apart. There was nothing left to give.
“Thanks,” Tony spins on the chair to fully face Steve. He puts a hand on his leg, then chin to hand. “You don’t seem like the type to be here.”
Steve tells him he is catatonic, nearly unmanageable in his mania. How he tried to rip his shackles with useless fingers that wouldn’t stop shaking. How he spat on the officers, cursed the scum they are, and broke his nose trying to push off another guard. How Tony dropped to his knees and sobs, slobber and snot falling off his mouth and nose.
“You’re going to eat the paste or I’ll hold you down and have medical put a feeding tube in you."
“I won’t stop you from leaving,” she says, tone pointed, eyes flashing in anger. Natasha picks at her bitten nails. He’s always seen them pristine, cut short and precise unless she needed them painted and long for a mission.
“Still mean it.”
“Steve,” Pepper measured out, her cheeks were a blotchy red and her hands were shaking as if she’s barely restraining herself from slapping him.
Steve’s eyes stung with pride, affection, and the pang of loss he feels every time he looks at Peter. He’s grown these last two, three years. Taller, but not by much. He might take after Tony’s stature. There’s more definition in his shoulders and his chins getting prickly with soft hairs. “Sometimes it’s hard to look at you, kid. I see him, and the knife twists. Sorry, Pete, it’s unfair to say that.”
Tony cannot be sure, but it
“And brainwashed him and made him their murder doll,” Tony finished, pulling away from Steve to read the rest of the files. “The script’s already written, and it’s a shitty-ass one at that. God. Fucking hell. How trite. They take Captain America’s bestfriend and turn him into a world-known assassin. What a plot.”
“You can’t be waiting for your turn, Steve. Your kids need you,” Bucky said. “You can’t live like this.”
His mind returns to the photographs in the hall, looping back to Tigra kissing Jarvis and saying goodbye, to her dismembered body, hanging like a mantle.
Tony kicked at Steve’s back and began fucking himself on Steve’s cock. Determined, Tony sunk on Steve’s cock, using the wall and Steve’s own body to piston himself up and down.
He sighed, letting the cool drink calm him. Carol was a friend. She didn’t mean any harm. She was checking on Steve, making sure he’s still sane and about to—
Tony bites the inside of his cheeks. His arms erupt in goosebumps, and he scratches at them with trembling fingers.
He wanted her out of the workshop and out of the brownstone. Didn’t his friends see that Steve wanted  to deal with this shit on his own?
Steve tried to listen. He can’t see anything but Tony in the hospital gown, face exhausted from the battle, body battered from the fall.
One hundred and seventy-seven countries versus Steve Rogers. Governments rose and fell, administrations came and went, but the ideals of the people, what values make his country, was immovable.
He’s not prodded to order food.
Steve raises a hand, slow, like he’s afraid Tony thinks he’ll punch him and duck out. Tony stands his ground. He knows how Steve looks when he’s about to lean in for a kiss. Smiling, always, like kissing is the best thing, and because he has said over and over, between their lips meeting again and again,
“No, I want to see your face.” Steve nudges Tony’s hips up, settling a pillow on his lower back. “Let me, please.”
Steve pulls off only to straddle Tony’s face. Tony’s looking up at him with wide eyes, bright under the night light. There’s a moment he’s shocked, and then tilts back, head going side to side, slurring again. Steve presses the head of his cock on Tony’s lips, then shifts back down to splay between Tony’s legs. He doesn’t want to choke Tony, not tonight, when their movements are heavy, bodies filled with drugs. Steve brings their cocks together once more and jerks them off until they both come.
“Yeah,” Steve says, the statement is partially a question.
This is likely what Tony meant, Steve thinks fondly.
“Our kid,” Tony corrects with a slight pinch. “Does Pops work? Sounds so old school. We thought you’d like it.”
There’s a mix of maps, framed news articles, wedding photos, and art pieces hanging on the hallway’s walls. Tony’s presence was everywhere in the house. He examined Tony’s schematics of one of the suits and smiled.
“Hm?”
“I love you.”
I close my eyes and pretend the sound of stereo from the apartment across the street is the humming of an engine.
“Should have thought of that.”
Tony finally turns, raises his eyebrows, as if astonished with Steve’s easy acquiesce.
It was like being caught doing something he wasn’t supposed too. All the happiness he felt in that moment was washed away with guilt.
The structure of the outdoor shower is spartan but the materials they used are indulgent. Tony Stark is still Tony Stark, and he’s used to the best things in life. Steve wants nothing more than to give him that. He built a small little bridge by the entrance, which lies open to reveal the deep ivory sink. He has a variety of scrubs placed on the counter to brush off the dirt from his finger nails.
They settled on the long table: Scott, Hope, and Cassie on one end with Sam, Bucky, and Natasha near Steve. Carol and Rhodey sat in the middle. Across from them were the Bartons. Their kids sat in the empty seats. Steve tried not to choke when Peter took the seat on the other end of the table. Tony’s seat.
Steve chokes down a sob. A plea. He doesn't know. He longs for a different time. Maybe if he had had more courage, he might have said something to Tony years ago, rather than forcing himself to be satisfied with specks and remnants of what could have been.
Tony stays in his chair. He doesn’t even spin or lean over. His arms are crossed all too casually, and Steve knows this. Some days, on his better days, he can read this man. Before, he had the privilege to see his armor peeled back. Today, it’s just Tony Stark, looking at him detached and unaffected.
Steve was unharmed from the battle, but he ached all over.
“I’ll think about it.”
“Does it work?”
Shortly after, Carol lands by the veranda and Rhodes steps out of the War Machine suit.
“That kid is too overprotective, I swear.” Tony smiled, bumped their foreheads. “He gets that from you.”
“Don’t worry, I won’t alert the press.”
Tony pecked them every time they had the chance. Then, in the mornings, Steve traced the lines on Tony’s sternum under the daylight filtering through the windows.
“I’m coming,” Steve warns, and Tony’s waiting for the clench of his shoulders, the twist of his lips. The snarl that comes out of his mouth as he comes. Instead, Steve’s eyes remain open, and he mutters a barely there
“You got too good at being alone,” Carol said, and her voice sounded very far away. “Sometimes I wonder how you could love him when you hate yourself so much.”
Waiting for Tony to return from picking up the kids. Waiting hours for Tony to decide what he wanted for dinner then changing his mind at the last second.
“As we said, Captain Rogers. It’s operable, but we need to do it right now. Dr. Lee and I will perform the surgery. There’s already an operation room booked.”
Rhodes and Pepper were visiting them. They offered Tony a box of Randy’s donuts, flown into New York from Los Angeles. Steve broke off a small piece of the blueberry glaze and offered it to Tony.
“You’re laughing at me?” Tony pouts. “And here I thought I’d get you cleaned up.” He tuts, spreading his legs wider apart to reveal his filling cock. He raises a hand, urging Steve forward.  “Come on, I designed this for my husband.”
Now, I know better, because he looks at me the way people look at ghosts they learn to live with. He's resigned; there's no end to the haunting. Ok, alright, I tell myself every night like clockwork, when he cups my face and brings our mouths together for a kiss.
“I did say that I’d be convinced for a fall wedding by the lake.” Tony rewards him with a winning smile. His dress shirt is open at the collar, revealing a love bite from last night.
Tony made a face and looked around the park. “Wasn’t it on this very bench?”
Steve used to tidy up, complaining about Tony’s disordered mess. Tony used to laugh, sing for Steve, and kiss him until he forgot all about the chaos Tony created with the oil lamp.
he wanted to say.
The workshop is different now. It’s more lively than it had been when Steve last stood there.
“Ok. Well.”
You would have hated it. This. Me. Extremis. Who I am now. I’ve always wanted to stand next to you and be invincible. I’m human, Steve, you can’t fault me for chasing after dreams. Not when I believed it to be the best.
Steve isn’t going to cry. He isn’t.
He’s fine.
It’s a nice day. The sun rises steadily from the shorelines. It’s still winter, but it’s warm enough to be out. The soil beneath their feet is slightly damp from last night’s drizzle. The trees lining the property are a mix of bright yellows and dull oranges.
“Then, how could you do this to us?” Steve’s harsh pants are the only thing he can hear.
Tony takes another puff from his pipe, getting up to brew himself a cup of coffee. He imagines what Steve may reply. Steve would likely get on his knees, put a hand on the kid’s shoulder, and listen to the information intently, promising to check the dams again.
“Do you think that’s possible for people like us?” Steve asks, needing to know the answer.
It’s too big for just five people, and Steve wonders if Natasha and Tony ever feel nostalgic for the time when they were all bunking on top of each other. But even then, they were already fracturing, lines drawn even if Steve refused to acknowledge the cracks.
“Alright, alright,” Steve nodded, catching his reflection. His eyes were bloodshot, but that’s normal for him these days. Maybe he’d never stop crying. Maybe he’d never stop mourning.
“Riri,” Tony calls out, warning in his eyes.
Imogen twisted her legs, trying to get into a comfortable position. It was useless. Group was uncomfortable. They had to dig for their bullet wounds. It’s supposed to be cathartic, but he felt exhausted after every session.
Now, Steve understood.
When he was drinking himself stupid, his memory was fuzzy, a nebulous montage of images. But one thing has always been as clear as Attilan-by-the-Sea, Steven Rogers is a good man, and Anthony Stark is fond of him.
Steve notes the position of other constellations and I imagine I’m seeing Andromeda.
I see the spiral galaxy.
Steve is fine. He’ll tough it out even if it’s uncomfortable.
“Goodnight, Victoria,” Tony calls out, climbing the steps two at a time.
And yet, here’s Tony Stark walking beside Steve Rogers around the city. Their shoulders brushed as the crowd pushed them closer. Steve wanted to lace their fingers.
Tony grabs the pistol. “Go. It’s no good for you to stay here. Go back to your planet, or further West, or —”
This is it. There’s no returning from here. Steve’s going to give all he can and he’ll walk out of the Tower unable to feel guilt or regret.
He turns to Natasha. “I’m going to see Steve. Barnes. We need to —”
We’re executing the sequence today. No time, Steve, we’ve never had enough time. You wouldn’t stand for this. Maybe it’s a good thing you’re gone. You’d say,
“If this is about moving on and healing again, please, pops, save it,” Harley interrupted. “I miss him. I like talking to the suits. It helps me work, alright? We toss ideas and it’s like dad is here. Even though, yeah, I know he’s not. But it helps...It helps.”
People in this hemisphere of the world simply denote it as the Disappeared.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose then stared him down. “You don’t get to die. You’re going to stop drinking,” he said, each word rang like a threat.
I caught you, Steve. Tied you up, too. Do you remember your safe word? Come on, let me joke, Steve. You're dead and you'll never leave this. Let the joke land, alright?  But it doesn't last long. Goddamnit, Steve, is every version of you such a straight shooter?
Steve watches Riri, Kate, and Tony work around each other in the kitchen. Bacon is taken from the fridge, along with fresh brown eggs. Sliced bread is shoved into the toaster.
Steve has spit dripping down his jaw, but he doesn’t care. He relaxes his throat, taking Tony in, letting Tony fuck his face. Use him like he deserves. If Steve can’t be anything else other than a cock to fill Tony or a warm hole for his cock, a faceless stranger to fuck, then that’s fine. It’s alright, he repeats, ignoring the sting in his eyes. It’s just because Tony’s pulling his hair and he can feel Tony take root inside him, growing, festering, blooming, until there’s nothing left but Tony.
Tony’s nodding,
“Watch it, man,” someone laughs beside him. Steve doesn’t care. He pushes off, parting the dancing bodies, interrupting groups of people. He has tunnel vision. Some man is trying to roofie Tony. Steve needs to keep him safe.
“Me too.” He shut his eyes and pictured Tony kissing his tears away.
“You’re good with kids,” Steve says, remembering Tony teasing Riri and Kate in the kitchen.
Until. Well.
and Iron Man. But for Steve, he’ll always be
Not Tony. God, not Tony.
He won’t.
But he had a soft spot for their brownstone’s bathroom. It was lavish, almost as big as the kitchen from Steve's childhood home in Brooklyn. There were four showerheads; it was like taking a shower under the rain. There were large windows overlooking New York, satisfying Tony's exhibitionist streak. It was a one way glass. Steve could fuck Tony over the shower's sitting area and look at the New York skyline.
“Don’t do that.”
I gave you my answer when it was too late.
He’ll pick more fresh eggs and some flowers from the garden to give to Tony. And by the time he returns back to the house, Tony will have shredded the cheese and have toasted the bread for their omelettes. They’ll have breakfast. Together.
He keeps at it, surprised when the glass is empty.
“With flowers.” Miss Barnes smiles, but there’s a far away look on her face.
. But instead, he breaks the kiss.
Her hair’s still thick, but there were more grays peppered in her red locks, especially on her temple. He wondered in the past year how much of Tony’s hair would have turned gray.
“Looks good.” He ruffled her hair and traced the lines on Tony’s goatee in the drawing. “You drew me and your dad, too.”
“No, it’s —“
He grabbed a beer from the ice chest and flicked it open with his thumb. Steve took a swing before replying to Carol. He needed to gather his practiced response. Steve was sure Carol and Rhodes would suggest another session with the on-call Avengers therapist.
It hasn’t changed.
He takes Steve’s face into both of his hands—this, he thinks, this is the way he holds onto the world when all of its infrastructures are about to collapse, when the wild life has run dry, when the candle stops burning.
She grabs his wrist and pulls him until he’s standing. “I’m disgusting.”
“I’m still furious, but I can’t let you do this. I can’t let you drink your life away. You
provided an overview of Tony’s life as a child prodigy, his ‘tumultuous’ teenage years in MIT, his bachelorhood, the time in Afghanistan, and until finally, Iron Man was born.
“I’m fine here, Mr. Stark.” Steve sits on the French settee, bare feet cross on the cream-colored ottoman. If it's anyone else, Tony would have booted them out of his home, but this is Steve, and he looks like he belongs here, amongst all of Tony's wild metals, his hodgepodge of books, and imported candleholders.
“Oh come on, nothing to heavy over dinner, Cap — Steve.” Tony braces his shoulders down and waves his fork at Steve. “Comer. Bon appetit. Kumain ka na. Eat, eat! How many more languages shall I say it?”
They have his file. They have everything on him. Medical records will show his history. Chronic medical conditions. Heart issues. Health evaluations that note mental disorders. Impairments in decision making abilities. Experimentations to his body.
“No, all the best parts of them are from you, sweetheart.”
Steve listens to Tony’s breath even out after awhile. It’s followed by a snore in the darkness. The light from outside filters against the open parting of the curtains. Shadows dance against the ceiling.
Imagination means entertaining desires and dangerous ambitions.
Tony choked, overwhelmed by the influx of memories filling his brain. It had been slow waking days before, feeding him short scenes, incomplete conversations, but now, he remembered. It was if a rubber band was snapping back into place.
Steve’s body is pliant, and he can’t hear the ocean or the sound of the guitarist further into the boardwalk. Tony is pawing his hair now, tugging it, so Steve drops down, kisses his chest, and unbutton’s Tony’s jeans. He unfasts his own, not even bothering to put his pants down his thighs. He lets his cock and balls hang against his boxers, then works Tony’s zipper down.
Steve bites his cheek, imagining Riri and all the other youth who found themselves without family having to fend for themselves. “She was alone?”
I didn’t.
Steve’s a hoarder. He couldn’t let go of Tony’s suits. His workshop remained pristine with minor changes as the kids used it as their own lab now. The bots maintain the area, cleaning the suits so they don't get dusty.
“No. I’m tired.” He shook his head, looking away from Natasha and to his children by the docks. “I’m tired of fighting. I hate that everyday is a battle to live. That’s what it was like for Tony in the end. I just… I’m tired, Nat.”
I didn’t realize it then. I thought you hated me. Terrified of what I’d become with Extremis. I really thought it was the right move. I still stand by that. But I’ve fucked up, I’m fucking up now. The last thing I’ll do is this. Keep all the files from Osborn. Delete, delete, delete. Files deleted.
Natasha sighs. “Let’s go. It’s about to start.”
“Honey, you’re not getting enough sleep in between our newborn and all the time you spend in the workshop,” Steve tried to reason. He had the serum, he didn’t need that much sleep.
It’s a fact of life, and staring at another man with a scar running from the corner of his temple and down his cheekbone is a reminder of that: no lives spared by grief.
“Him, probably,” I say.
But Steve wants nothing more than to fucking
It’s eerie, the way Steve tracks each of his movements, nods in satisfaction as Tony swallows each bite. Steve barely spared a glance at him in public unless it was during an arrest, and in the privacy of their homes, Steve had always poured over reports, files, and incessant paperwork. He’d read out legal documents from the capital and go over legislative proposals from the townsfolk. Brainstormed possible ways to improve the community.
“Where are the kids?” Steve looked up at the ceiling. He has gotten used to pulling them from their projects because they kept passing on messages via JARVIS that they’d just be ‘five more minutes.’
“Let me start, Steve. I’ve got my goddaughter all excited during dinner and she’ll probably burst if I don’t give her my present now.” Carol grinned at Morgan, offering her a slim box.
Time to die
“Because the rest of the adults in the Compound can’t be left on their own,” Riri nods, sagely, eyes dancing. She breaks out into a grin that matches Tony’s own.
“So you’re back from the Army. Why LA? It doesn’t seem like the place you’d go to settle down.”
Sex makes them soft, pacifying the arguments at the tip of their tongue.
Tony snored, moving around in his sleep. Steve’s always been a selfish man. Captain America would sacrifice his life for what was right, but Steve Rogers would risk losing a limb to hold Tony in his arms. He shifted forward gingerly, putting an arm around Tony’s shoulder and pressing in closer to the bed.
There was no time like the present. He got his ass up and walked to the table. He clicked the manual release from the helmet and entered his access code.
“Fuck.”
Steve,
Bucky stayed perched on the other sofa, one foot on his other knee. He nursed the empty glass, turning it in his hand. “The kids are really worried. I know Harley’s been a little shit. It might help to show them you’re moving on, Stevie.”
Steve,
Waiting.
"I survived because of it— him, the Hulk. Let me get used to my own skin. I finally understand why I deny things.”
Steve couldn’t comprehend how he’d never hold onto Tony's waist again or trace the scars from the arc reactor. He couldn’t bear making lunch when Tony wasn't sitting on his chair, a tablet in hand, Morgan on his lap. Peter and Harley trading barbed quips with him.
—I’m coming, yes—I’m coming.” Tony pulls hard, like they’re in battle and he wants to throw Steve across the room. His cock twitches and he’s hard again, and he wants to fuck Tony again and again, fill him up with his come, but there’s Rumiko’s voice echoing in his head:
One could describe the science of the body and its demise in detached terms, but when death happened, loss and grieving was nothing but emotional.
Steve had a choice. He’s tried not to leave his life up to chance. Asthma, heart problems, high blood pressure? Possibility of contracting diabetes? He couldn’t live with the chance of death following him like a shadow. Sure, he took a chance with Dr. Erskine but it was his choice. He stopped thinking about the what
The holo-screen’s digital clock clicks.
“Dad would stay up for 24 hours, so I can do that too.” Harley twisted his lips, tinkering with a potato gun.
He sighed, knowing he couldn’t stop them. Steve did the same—stayed up at night, eyes tracking the patterns in the darkness. Hands crawling to the left side of the bed.
There, he thinks, that’s where it belongs.
“Well, you look like a good man,” Tony smiles at him, and this time, it looks real, unlike all those staged photographs for the magazine, or the way he grinned for the camera while Stone spanked his ass and pulled on his hair. Tony is a dream and he deserves to be treated well.
Rumiko catches his eyes for a moment and then glances at his dick with a smile that’s all teeth and gums.
It’s true. Grief came in waves.
Tony would wink at him.
Maybe, there was a metaphor about the human body recycling its parts for the rest of the world to use. Tony told him that humans are made of stardust and genetic code that evolved then made them what they are—human. They were breakable and filled with tragic hope. Steve may have serum cycling through his veins, but he's always been just a man with a dream. For a long time, that dream came true — he lived so many lives since 1918. But one thing was certain: Steve was a husband to the best man he knew.
As I roll my neck, his face disappears. The bluest eyes that Steve Rogers loves so much are gone and replaced by deep brown ones, inherited from ancestors billions years old. Tony's hair recedes until my head is green and my ears poke out.
Tony waved back, chuckling. “Hi, Winghead.”
The brownstone was located in the upper east side, near the Guggenheim. It was a renovated building from the 19th century, with a terrace on the ground floor, a spacious cellar, and four bedrooms on the top two floors. The rooftop was dreamy, but the best part of the entire house was the open space kitchen. He could picture them having the Avengers over for dinner. Tony will play mother hen and set the table while Steve popped open the wine. It’s too much space for just the two of them, but they didn’t say anything once Pepper handed them the paperwork.
“The people we saved are important, too. I had to try.”
His heart felt heavy, maybe reconciliation was too good to be true.
Steve glanced at him. There was a question he didn’t utter, like he already knew the answer. He removed Tony’s pants and boxers in one swift movement, then patted his thighs, urging Tony to stepped out of them. Then, he was kneeling on the floor and pulling Tony’s socks off.
I’m not doing enough, Steve. I wish I was.
Steve comes on my face then kisses me. It’s sloppy, but I’ve swallowed so much of his come that I don’t grimace at the taste. He towers over me and licks me open.
The damage to his body is no match for his heartache.
This isn’t something he had done then, Before.
“Anything you want, sweetheart.” Steve ushered Tony to the bed, took their towels, hung them in the bathroom, and got dressed.
Steve shakes the cauldron. “Brought you some porridge from Wong’s.”
He inhaled deeply, wiping a hand over his nose. He felt dizzy with wrath and the itch to yell at the world.
There were so many other things he could have told her. How Yinsen fed him and held him up as he took a piss because he couldn’t accomplish the most elementary things while his heart was giving out. Maybe he should have realized what a feat survival would be.
Steve works Tony’s nipples between his teeth, licking and biting until they’re hard and swollen. He files away every moan, the way Tony arches his chest, silently asking for more. He'll turn this over later, pull it out of a metaphorical folder, flip through the pages, analyzing each inhale, every kiss, every whimper.
Tony looked down to see the gum beside his shoe. The tracks were littered with garbage and fallen Metrocards. But no dead bodies, and everyone in the station appeared satisfied enough to simply wait for the train to arrive.
Steve watched that stupid imported VHS every evening, rubbing himself raw. It was the one thing that let him live through the violence in the desert. It made him want to come back to base at night. There was a time when he got sloppy at work, where he questioned what the hell they were doing in another country, fighting a war for men who yell too much about democracy but don’t do anything about inequality on their own soil. Then, Tony Stark comes into his life, giving him this sense of salvation.
that I was angry enough to get to that state of mind. That I
He looks like everything Steve’s ever dreamed of and wanted to avoid. The revelation shocks him to a beat of silence.
It was the coordinates of their park bench where they had their first kiss. The park bench where Steve bent down, pretended to tie his shoelace and presented Tony with a ring.
“I know,” Steve says. It hurts, but it’s true. He’s happy they all have each other. “Believe me, I know.”
“Oh, oh, yes, god, yes. Please, harder, harder,” Tony cries between every other thrust, panting and twisting his body, meeting Steve’s pace, and a growl—a sound he’s never heard outside of battle—comes out of him. With his free hand, Steve lifts Tony’s waist, plunging deeper. “God—fuck—
Steve hummed, dropping his chin on Tony’s shoulder. He kissed Tony’s jaw. “It’s true, darling, I’ve got a mug to prove it.” He grabbed the chipped white mug. In bold curly letters it said:
“What,” Tony said, because all other words were inadequate.
With a careful finger, Steve traced the lines on Tony’s face and his long eyelashes.
But it wasn’t.
He tugs at Tony’s balls until he’s let off. Tony gives him an amused smile. “No one can keep me from having your mouth, Rogers.”
Timely moves on. It’s like he’s the only one who remembers that a man died in the middle of town.
Steve wants to laughs. “That’s probably true.”
Steve pulled off each weeks ago.
“Yes.”
“No, you’re not. You pretend you are—you give information but only so people stop bothering you. But you’re here, doing this for Bucky, even when you have all the reason not to. You're a good man, Tony Stark.” Steve shook his head, fond. “Look at you. You’re taking care of us. You do that, you know. For all the times you say I’m a mother hen, it’s actually you.”
His mouth opens and Steve shoves two thick fingers inside.
Finally, after a lecture about country music, she points at the double doors and forces him to grapple with his own thoughts.
Maybe life could be simple. Easy. Easier. But that isn’t us, is it?
He would never bring Tony coffee in that mug again. But Steve still had use for it. He leaned on the counter, picked up the mug, and traced the lining of the words in bold curly lines:
Tony stares at him for a moment, then laughs. “Shit. Did someone send you to look after me? Because I swear, I won’t drive drunk, I’ll find a place to crash or get a cab to drop me off to Malibu. My place isn’t too far.” He says the last line with a suggestive quality, but maybe Steve is just reading into things.
“Then —“ Steve breaks off, deflating. “It seems like —“
Steve parroted the words again. It echoed in the room. There’s no reply.
“No, no, baby.” She chuckles, leaning forward and wrapping her arms around Tony’s torso. She plants kisses all over his back, then adjusts the blindfold on Tony’s face. “No, no, Tony. Remember, you and I don’t get to decide when you come tonight.”
”Morgan, Peter, Harley, it’s been an adventure being your dad. I wish I was there to protect you from darkness and whatever else this universe brings. I wish, damn. I wish so much, baby. To be there for you. See you everyday. But you’ll grow up in this reality. Without me. God, I told myself I wasn’t going to cry. Kids, I hope like hell you’ll do good.
“He asked where he could find you,” she adds, pointing to Tony who refuses to look at them.
“I know.”
“No, Tony. It’s not that. It’s something else.”
You signed your letter as
Mockingbird and Hawkeye’s bodies hang slack on the ropes.
Steve and Natasha end up sitting on a bench watching the trio run another few laps. Tony strips off his track jacket when they start mobility drills and they keep at it for another hour. The sun rises higher and higher. He itches for a cup of coffee. He’d go make them all breakfast if he didn’t think he’d be over stepping.
Tony moans, burying the feeling of grief deep, deep inside him. To a place Steve should never find.
It was Tuesday again.
Tony sat back and mustered the courage to look at Steve. Beautiful and larger than life itself. Tony was willing to tear them apart if it meant keeping Steve alive. He’d failed that too, apparently.
“All better,” Tony announces and places a War Machine sticker on the kid’s t-shirt.
Tony devoured the news reports documenting the war, trying to piece together how they fell apart. It was his fault.
You’re right, Steve. Sometimes people in power find it hard to listen, even if they’re presented evidence on what is
“It’s Friday,” Harley mumbled behind Steve’s back. “It’s today.”
Natasha tilts her head.
“Yes, you feel amazing, Tony.” Steve whispers, sucking on the space under his ear. He brings a hand up and spits, twice, then wraps a hand around both of their dicks. Steve fists them both. There’s not enough spit, but it’s alright. He leans back, catching Tony’s face. He’s breathing heavily. He must be enjoying himself. Yes, good, Steve wants Tony to have a good time.
The serum saved him.
Tony fiddles with the door. Inside, he drops the key on the vanity and toes off his shoes before dropping to the bed. He stretches his hands over his head and yawns.
In this case, nothing could be improved because there were no new memories to be made.
“Steve, ugh, fuck me harder.”
“Yes, finally, fuck me, split me open. I want to go to my meeting with the feeling of your dick still inside me.” Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s wet hair then slid a hand to knead Steve’s back. He pressed the head in slowly, taking care to watch Tony’s impatient expression. Tony tugged at his hair. “Now, fuck me, Steve. Now would be good.”
im holding off on getting to you
When he woke up from ice, there was always the call for a fight.
Steve settled on the floor and kissed Tony awake. He tipped Tony’s chin and licked his lips open.
Steve tied the double knot on the robe. “I would be worse if you weren’t around.”
They’re safe. They’re hiding.
“Oh my god, Steve. They’ve been fucking for months now.” Tony barked a laugh, eyes dancing. Steve was glad he wasn’t wearing his sunglasses. Tony looked immaculate in those Tom Fords. But Steve loved seeing the brown of his eyes, the speck of green in his irises. They were wide and expressive.
“Do you want to talk now?”
“Carol, now you’re the one being an asshole.” Natasha cleared her throat, then straightened, her face was the portrait of concern. Her voice was soft. Gentle, like talking to a skirmish animal. “How are you, Steve?”
“It’s Walter Lawson, sir,” Tommy says, voice grave. “He’s green.”
There’s only the hum of the engine and the low music from the stereo.
“No problem.”
“Yes, you do.” Steve kissed her forehead, hoping to communicate how much he appreciated her.
“Carol, I got him killed.”
It doesn’t mean shit when he walked around, unaligned, like he’d been shot in the ribs and missing a limb. Waiting.
I used to think Steve’s attention was akin to love.
Pale flesh fades, turning to green. Long faces and large, sharp ears are revealed.
Tony blinks out the tears, his heart hurting more than that time in the cave. He hitches a breath, and sees Steve smile.
Tony finally understood that it wasn’t drinking that was a slow death. It was love, and its failures to mend things, because love wasn’t enough. Tony thought of the most banal sentiment when it came to Steve.
“Grief and death is something we’ll all go through. We’ve been through.”
In the middle of the circle is another It.
“You like this,” Steve says, thrusting deeper and skating a hand over my body. My ribs. My cock. “Tell me, can you tell me how much you like this?”
I was scared, Steve. I knew what was going to happen. Us, at war. Chaos. I was preparing myself for it. Face it head on, like the great Baldwin said. I knew I’d lose you. Your friendship. But not like this. I didn’t foresee you dead.
