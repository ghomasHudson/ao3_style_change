“Having fun?” He gunned it down the interstate. It was about 80 miles from the Avengers HQ base to Manhattan, but when one drove as fast as Tony…80 miles seemed more like 30.
This was so simple, but a lot of things weren’t. He still couldn’t believe he was getting emails from some intergalactic starguy and his angry blue robot lady, but that’s just how it was these days. He couldn’t believe a lot of things.
Nat stuffed the last remnants of a sandwich in her mouth. She had her two-toned hair pulled up into a messy bun. Bucky loved it when she wore it like that.
“But then I realized we hadn’t seen each other in over two years. That’s too long, Tony. I miss you. I really do. If something had happened to you, I wouldn’ta been the first one to know it and that just feels wrong.” He’d vaguely thought about what he’d wanted to say on the drive down…even if he hadn’t expected to spill it in the middle of a living room. “I wish I could say sorry for the whole Accords incident, but I can’t. I stand by the decisions I made then, but I am sorry for what it’s done to us and Rhodey. I don’t regret a lot of things, but one thing I do regret was not doing this earlier.” Cap’s expression was earnest and his fists were clenched.
When his eyes had adjusted and he really looked around, he noticed Steve wasn’t in here. That was weird.
Cap cursed under his breath at seeing Tony just waiting for him like that, so he grabbed the bottle of lube and immediately squirted some on his fingers. He walked up behind Tony, using a slick index to rub and tease with the rim of his ass.
“Just world-changing tech, robots, super-computers. Satellites. Augmented reality. Nothing special. What about you? What do you do for a living?”
Tony hugged him, kissing his head and clapping him on the back. Peter was grinning ear-to-ear. Steve even grabbed Peter, hugging him and ruffling his hair. He got hugs from every Avenger, who all congratulated him. Tony watched from afar as that dough ball Peter Quill ran through the parking lot and grabbing Parker from behind, giving him a massive bearhug, shouting, “Yeah, man!” Peter was laughing, even as Thor nearly slapped the air out of him, giving him a congratulatory pat on the back.
He shouted, activating the thrusters on his suit after wrapping an arm around Happy’s big waist, flying straight toward the front half of the plane. Happy held onto him tighter as he yelled at Karen to increase power, flying hard and fast toward the cabin. With the special vision tech through his mask, he could see the captain was alive, strapped to his chair, the sudden force had probably knocked him out.
Maybe…maybe he was feeling just a little gay right now. Like, just a tiny bit gay for Thor, but a lot of guys were gay for Thor. He’s heard even genderless asexual aliens were kinda gay for Thor. He was feeling a lot of things.
The wind rushed by so hard and fast he couldn’t hear anything except Happy shouting. He looked down and saw part of the cabin twirling slowly, spewing debris, liquid and smoke. Peter couldn’t see anyone falling, and knew in the pit of his stomach that their stewardess who was in the back half of the plane was gone. Karen confirmed no life was left in the back.
“Nat, I’m in the East door. Any movement?” Bucky whispered into his earpiece, squatting in a dark hallway behind a shelf. This place was a fucking mess. They were currently in what was supposed to be in an abandoned building in central Africa investigating a claim of alien tech distributors. Ever since the Chitauri invasion and the Battle of Wakanda, there were all kinds of dangerous alien weapons floating on the black market. Half of the time, the people that had them had them en masse and knew how to use them. They had a few agents working for the Avengers that could handle these sorts of missions, but Bucky had convinced Nat she needed to get out of HQ a little bit. She hadn’t left the compound in over six months, and he thought it was about time his girl got some action. Was it a mistake to go on a mission together? Probably, but he liked watching her work. It turned him on.
Stark grabbed Steve’s face and brought his head up so he could kiss him open mouthed groaning, “Ohhh, shit, I’m not in the mood for foreplay babe.”
“I am too. I always am,” Steve took a heavy, comforting drink of his coffee. After putting the cup on a nearby table, he leaned a forearm on the glass, looking down at his feet. He shut his eyes. Ever since Tony sent Peter away to university, everyone had been telling him Tony was getting more neurotic and withdrawn. Steve hoped to God he wasn’t drinking. Every time Steve came around Tony pushed him away. Tony was still sore over the Battle in Berlin and every other wrong thing that had happened between them. Would going to check on him make it worse? Would he even answer the door when Friday told him who was there?
The moment he was gone both Nat and Bucky turned to look at Cap in a way that was so comical it actually made Steve laugh, “Guys?”
Steve looked up and him while chewing and shook his head, the pink of his tongue coming out to clean his lips. “No, never. I’ve gone out with Bucky a few times when we were younger with some girls, but it wasn’t like what you said. It was more like a double date with a gal who Bucky set me up with. Poor thing escaped the first chance she got. Almost took a girl out for coffee before she turned out to be a secret agent, you remember Sharon. She was nice. I really liked her.”
“Morning Steve, smells good,” Tony plopped down and stole a few blueberries from the batter bowl. “Bad news Cap. Park date’s canceled.”
Cap came over and sighed, shaking his head looking irritated and worried for the safety of every last person in this city—of course—as if Stark wasn’t capable of saving everyone on his own. “Tony…”
“I like to draw. I’ve gotten into painting now, too. I actually painted a huge one for a friend recently. I didn’t realize my hands were still so steady.”
“So this will be the last shipment?” Nebula said, taking tentative drinks of the lemonade Tony had given her.
Nebula nodded, dangerously rasping, “Not at all.” There was something very murdery about her eyes that made Tony desperately wish he could have seen it all.
“That’s valid,” Quill said, scratching his own hair and leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. “I know, listen, I gonna tell you eventually. You’re my little bro!”
“Not for me,” Tony grabbed Steve’s face and made him look at him again. The other man’s eyes were full of want, but the knit of his eyebrows betrayed him—it almost gave Cap a look of desperation or hesitance, Tony wasn’t sure. “Unless it is for you?”
Thankfully they were able to mostly move past it, and the fact that they’d shared something so naughty, so forbidden, really made them even closer. Bucky was Steve’s one and only confidant after that, and vice versa. He had had secrets to burden Steve with too of course, and right up until he’d fallen to what should have been his death, they’d been closer than ever.
“Mmm…that’s right…” Stark hummed, reaching a hand down to lightly grasp and play with his own member. “Did that fight turn you on? Or do you just get all hot when I carry you?” He could feel Steve had already worked in a second finger, and thank god, because he didn’t want to wait. One of Steve’s hands was occupied with stretching his ass while the other was squeezing and kneading Tony’s plush ass cheeks. He moaned at the sensation, breath coming heavier because he knew what was coming.
Tony squeezed Steve’s leg, then stood up and dinged on a glass, “Hey! Shut up!” he called. Everyone did settle down, except the Peters who had a case of the giggles.
“Yeah,” Quill said, head following Thor when he strode away to the wall the music-player was plugged into. “Also it’s not about Bohemians man.”
“Hi, stranger,” she said, coming over and hugging him. He was a little surprised by the hug but he’d missed her so he’d allow it. What Tony didn’t see was the sudden look Bucky gave Cap.
Plus, it was hard to be sad when there were tests and studying to be done all the time, it really kept his mind off of things. Well, it kind of did…It helped. What really helped was Mr. Stark. Ever since everyone in Peter’s life had been dusted, every single person he knew, Tony had taken it upon himself to take him in. So many children were parentless when the Snap happened that the process for people to become legal guardians was legally laxed, especially if the children were actually teenagers capable of making educated decisions. Stark had sat him down and adopted him not long after he’d called Happy, completely inconsolable about a month after they’d gotten back to Earth. Since Nebula, Quill, and Tony kept giving their rations to the kid, he was in much better shape than they were when they were stuck in space. All four of them were in a sorry state by the time Captain Marvel showed up. Thank God Quill had a huge stock pile of space candy. They’d all formed a pretty spectacular bond by the end of the whole ordeal, especially since he’d found ways to make Nebula make this noise that sounded kind of a like a laugh.
“Yeah, and you deserve one too. The ship’s already sunk, Captain, the only thing dragging you down is yourself.”
Steve did that thing where he turned but when he looked up to meet Bucky’s eyes his eyebrows went up too. “Yeah, Buck?”
Tony refused to let Peter go back to school after that for at least a week, something Peter didn’t fight against. Tony paid for the stewardess’s whole funeral and gave her family an absurd amount of money after telling them the truth, but for the most part kept the whole ordeal under wraps. Tony was livid, beyond livid. His blood boiled at the very thought of his son almost dying in one of his own planes, because of negligence somewhere down the line. His blood boiled than an innocent lady died because somewhere, some fucking thing fell through the cracks. The world didn’t know Peter Parker was Spider-Man yet, but the world did know that Peter Parker was Stark’s son. Tony wished beyond all-reason that that didn’t put a target on Peter’s back.
“I thought this was someone else’s, oh my god!” Peter hopped on it and squeaked whenever Steve threw him the keys. “Thank you!”
The thought brought back a swell of emotions the man desperately tried to ignore. Bucky felt horrible that he didn’t love Steve the way the other man so desperately wanted him to. They didn’t talk about it. They had kissed once long ago when Steve was still cute and small, and it was nice. But for Bucky, it wasn’t what he wanted for them—it was too weird. He still thought of Steve like a brother. It was magic for Steve who was so broken when Bucky eventually admitted he didn’t feel the same, that it had made the other man wish beyond all reason that he really was gay, just for Stevie. But he couldn’t. He just didn’t feel the same and couldn’t force it. And Steve being Steve, well, he didn’t let it ruin them. They were stronger than that.
With a sigh, he posted some tweets to his Spider-Man™ twitter account, ate some more food, bothered Happy (who was doing much better but had trouble sleeping too), watched some TV…he looked at the clock—only thirty minutes had passed. He groaned, running his hands down his face.
When the pair got in the hallway together the air was heavy and completely tense. Tony held up his hands, “My bad. Cock blocked you Cap, whoopsie. I guess it’s payback,” Iron Man said easily, even though he wanted to ask a million questions.
It was a moment of silence before his ears caught up to the massive roar of applause directed at him. He grinned and smiled, opening his arms and waving to everyone. “Thank you!” The microphone on his lapel recorded his words, but the crowd was so loud he was sure no one heard it. He waved, took questions for about an hour, and then he was walking back to his plane. Well, his dad’s plane.
On the eve of their second date, Tony had stayed the night at the Avengers Facility. Cap was off on a mission and was going to get back while he was still sleeping. Anticipation rose in Tony’s chest when he’d arrived. He hadn’t spoken to the man since their first date…and last kiss. The only bad part was, he woke up to a snowstorm. It was only supposed to flurry. Guess it was mother nature telling him an indoor date was how it just had to be. There were worse things.
“What? Sleep? Happy, don’t be crazy,” Peter chuckled, rolling up his sleeves and then sighing. He sipped a carbonated orange juice—his move favorite drink in the world at the moment—and scratched the stubble coming in on his chin. “I hate shaving…”
“Hmm, maybe don’t get the bourguignon then. Red wine goes better with beef, usually. Okay! Second lesson don’t talk about exes, breakups or religion. No politics either. So, how was your day Steve?” Tony leaned back, already comfortable in one of his favorite places. He already knew what food he wanted. Steve was staring at the menu like it was a book to study. The menu had no prices on it.
“I swear to god if you give me the whole, ‘Back in my day we walked through eight feet of snow,’ speech…”
He turned to Steve who was watching them with the biggest genuine smile he’d seen on the man in a long time. Steve wasn’t exactly a “smiley” guy, especially these days, but he didn’t seem so miserable anymore. In fact, Steve was becoming pretty sweet again. He himself was becoming pretty sweet again. He and Steve together? He never could have dreamed they’d work so well as a couple. Steve wasn’t his boyfriend, he didn’t like that word, it didn’t suit Rogers at all. No, Steve was…his man. It felt right after all this time, like they should have been this way from the beginning.
“What are you waiting for? Get your star-spangled ass in, you’re coming to dinner if you want to spend time with me so bad. Nothing is keeping the kid and I from our reservation. Not even this conversation—which, by the way—I really didn’t want to have today.”
Tony blinked really feeling like a piece of shit suddenly for cock-blocking poor Steve and feeling jealous on top of that. Maybe the poor guy really was a 100 year-old virgin, and he didn’t know what it was like to love without a war or he’d never gotten to express his sexuality or something. It was actually really sad.
“A piece of your what?” Steve leaned down and whispered into Stark’s ear, biting it. Stark’s chest fluttered a little and he nearly giggled.
what he’s been missing. He’d make fun of him relentlessly later. He wasn’t in the mood to go all slow and instructive, he wanted it now.
. The friendly, small-town nice guy with an altruistic streak. He liked those, those were fun. Chewing on his lip, he'd completely forgotten and ignored his assistant. "What, what are you saying?"
He suddenly couldn’t breathe and took a big breath through his nose, pulling his head back and looking up at Steve with astonished brown eyes. His breath had now picked up and he was just panting into the space between them, watching Steve watch him. He felt hot all over and everywhere he felt Steve’s fingers, there was a sort of jolt that went straight to his groin.
Something was very wrong, and Peter only had about a full two seconds to react. He clanged his wrists together, then reached out and grabbed Happy by the arm while his Peter-tingle tingled in all the wrong ways. His eyes widened and he grabbed Happy, dragging him toward the front of the plane as the whirring in his ears got louder and louder until the world was suddenly going too fast and large explosion knocked them both backward.
“Hey Tony,” he said, putting a hand on his shoulder and leaning over to kiss his cheek. “You coming to dinner?” Tony’d just woken up a few minutes shy of 6 o’clock. Peter was back in school—with heaps of private security—and he wasn’t liking it all. Steve’s hand did make him feel better though. He was always thankful when Cap was there, and ever since they’d become lovers he’d seen how attentive and sweet Steve was. He was kind of more doting than Pepper.
“Hello Tony,” Nebula greeted, holding two boxes stacked on top of each other. She put them down next to Quill’s. Thor was following her, wearing sunglasses and sandals.
I really hope you like it. These are my favorite characters of all-time right here folks. Don't hesitate to let me know how you feel and if I've done them justice.
“Don’t get too excited, my gift for you is like a million times cooler,” Tony called, watching Peter drive off shouting with verve. He knew he should have never let Peter try out Steve’s bike.
“Well…” he didn’t have much to say, that was the sweetest thing anyone had said to him in almost five years. “I’m not gay, bro…”
“You do?” Cap smirked, holding Tony’s jaw in his hands and just looking up at him. Tony loved it when he got that face, even though he still wasn’t sure what it meant.
“It was incredible. Thank you,” he turned to Tony and grasped his shoulder before sitting down and excitedly staring at the stage like he wanted intermission to end right that second. When the show started up again and then finally ended, Steve’s clap was loud and he whistled. Tony watched him clap and grin, feeling a smile on his own face. He felt happy he could show him something so new and interesting. As the two men walked side by side out of the theatre, they talked about their favorite parts.
Steve smiled at him in that genuine way where he just looked so proud of him it made him feel like he needed to hide. “That’s amazing Tony.” And the bastard was so genuine, he knew he meant it with all of his heart.
They spent many days like this, just the three of them at home in the Avengers compound unless duty called (of course other staff still worked there too, but they were the only resident Avengers left on-call). It was a strange sort of bliss he couldn’t have properly explained to anyone. It was January 2023 and they’d all spent Christmas together like one big happy family. Even Tony had stopped by, somehow able to spend more than ten minutes in Bucky’s presence without making a rude comment. It seemed the Iron Man finally realized that even though his body killed his parents, his mind was just an observer locked in a meaty prison. Or, for the sake of the others, maybe Iron Man had just controlled himself. He still ignored Bucky for the most part, but he wasn’t trying to kill him anymore. No more stank eye for Steve either.
Sam just laughed at him and Cap was smiling. Tony felt sorry for Cap, it sucked not being able to get drunk. Guess he cried like a baby about it, using his huge manly super-serum muscles to wipe away the tears. Asshole. Tony smirked to himself.
“Goodnight, Steve,” Tony said, turning and walking faster than he’d meant too. Once he got into the elevator he pushed the “B” button just about a hundred times.
Steve’s fist gripped his hair and he suddenly released, throwing his head back, body tensing. He made a loud noise, that descended into sort of moan hum as Tony continued to milk him. Steve mumbled, “Sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get it in your mouth,” through his panting.
Tony leaned forward. He’d bought out the whole restaurant, so no one was here to take pictures of them. “Of course, you wouldn’t get it Sam. You’re not an original Avenger. Sorry.”
Tony frowned as he watched the man (Was he even old enough to be called a man?) run along the beach and kick up sand. This dude was one of
Tony was proud of his own six pack. Seven and eight were fighting with all the chocolatey non-protein shakes he kept sneaking on days he didn’t work out.
“So, we’re doing this now--mph—” his words were quickly cut off by lips on his. There was no hesitation, just a warm, strong kiss and Cap’s arms tightening around his waist. The man pulled him closer until they where stomach to stomach, tilting his head and blowing Tony’s mind. How in the fuck was he such a good kisser? Tony kissed back, shock and arousal pounding through his body, “Oh fuck,” he breathed, completely breathless against Caps lips. It was so good, and god how he wanted it to continue. Cap pulled away, a soft wet noise sounding when he brought their mouths apart.
Tony’s heart was slowing a little and he finally felt like he had control of his breathing again. “Don’t be an asshole Rogers,” Stark chuckled, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck and just exhaling all the air he’d been keeping. His body felt heavy and he felt lazy, like a big satisfied cat.
Steve looked up at him, “I know. Thank you,” Steve stood and patted Bucky’s shoulder as he passed, hanging up the garment bag in his closet.
“Told you I was the king of dates,” Tony grinned devilishly, however his body language was showing the opposite. Steve was intimidating in this arousing way that had him feeling embarrassed again.
It wasn’t long before Tony had kissed Steve all the way to the bed. Steve pulled Tony to straddle him as he sat on the side of the bed, hands roaming all over Iron Man’s back. The brunet was nearly dizzy by how hot this all was, smiling as he kissed Rogers deeper. He let himself sink until his knees were caging Steve’s legs and firmly on the bed.
The other man breathed, “What is it, Tony,” between them, fingers lightly squeezing at a low part on Tony’s back. His voice was calm and considerate but filled with something husky.
The two laughed for a second more as Rhodey said, “Hah hah, yeah, whatever, goodbye. Hey, better to be anonymous than a 100-year-old virgin, right?”
“Aw, Rogers, you’re so sweet, I bet you remember everyone’s birthday without Facebook reminders, huh?” Even though Tony joked about it he knew it was true. Cap didn’t even answer, just held onto him and stared down with a mild look of fascination. As much flack as Steve gave him for their impromptu flying escapades, he seemed to enjoy seeing the city from so far up. Finally, Tony approached the landing pad of Avengers Tower. He gently put Steve down as his own feet clanked loudly against the landing platform. The protocol was initiated to begin taking off his suit, and so as he walked beside Rogers, JARVIS took the Iron Man armor off of him piece by piece via mechanisms that came from the platform and rotated around him. As the pieces disappeared and he was his normal—much shorter—self again. He stretched his arms up over his head and then scratched his beard, happy to be out of the suit. It was nice and had air conditioning and all that, but he was still glad to be free of the confines.
Bucky rose an eyebrow, “Let me guess…you made grilled cheeses? Boxed mac ‘n cheese? Something pre-made with cheese?”
Nebula had laid down to rest and recharge a little. It was “late” on the Guardians’ ship. They’d just finished selling every last bit of the cargo Tony had given them. She sat with her back against a bay-bed wall, eyes off. Her cybernetics increased her hearing and eyesight, which honestly was a burden with Quill and Thor around if she didn’t turn them off. They were such gross creatures. She did love them, just from afar. As her mind began to wonder which star system would be more profitable this week, she heard Quill sniffle distantly.
Tony, Steve, Happy, Rhodey, Nat, and Bucky were all standing in the crowd, shouting and clapping for Peter. Today was his graduation day. Peter had graduated, his boy had finally gotten his Master’s degree, and Tony couldn’t have been more proud. He certainly didn’t have tears in his eyes—no way—and he certainly wasn’t squeezing the life out of Cap’s hand through most of the ceremony. After the rest of the names, the speech, and the cheering, the Avengers, who were already in the back of the crowd in the stadium, made their escape quickly. Once the ceremony was over and Peter had gotten done talking to what very few friends he’d made, he found them all waiting for him in the parking lot.
“Oh yeah. Hugely inconvenient,” Tony said exasperatedly, making a flippant hand gesture. “You ready to go or what?”
“I’ll be right back,” he said, kissing her once more and then jogging to the stairs. He didn’t really like elevators, and he always had a lot of energy to burn. His mind vaguely wondered if Steve always had this much energy as he tried to get the thoughts of Natasha’s gaze out of his brain before he showed up downstairs with an embarrassing accessory.
“They started shooting at us first,” Thor said, pointing to Nebula with his axe. Nebula wondered if the only reason Thor even came along was to make sure Quill didn’t die, seeing as how he almost always did if there were more than five guys shooting at them. “They got greedy! It wasn’t our fault this time!”
“I hope you have a good time, pal. No matter what Tony’s branding it as. Don’t have to love him to date him. Even if it’s make-believe.”
He saw Steve from the side, pinning another man against a door and kissing him deeply. The pair were as quiet as they could be, bodies pressed close and mouths open and hot for each other. The guy had his hands in Steve’s hair and on his ass, and Steve had his arms wrapped around the bigger guy’s waist. They were kissing so passionately and wetly, the very sight shot straight to Tony’s groin before he could do anything about it. His heart slammed itself against his ribcage and he stopped breathing for a good few seconds.
What the actual fuck. Oh god. He was dating Steve Rogers. He’d kissed him. Jesus, the world really had ended, the 100 year-old virgin made the first move. They’d practically made out there for a second, he didn’t know how to handle this like an adult.
Bucky held up his hands, “Sorry. I’m just saying, you’ll never know until you try. For Christ’s sake, I’ve got a life now. What kind of sick irony is that?”
The doors dinged and it made him jump. Shit, he needed to escape. How in the hell would he ever sleep with the feeling of Cap’s strong hands on his waist? The feeling of his hot, perfect lips against his, and Jesus fuck the smell and feel of him. He had been exhausted when he got into the building and now he felt like he needed to run four miles. Maybe he would…He stepped back into the elevator and went to go work off the sudden adrenaline rush, hoping he could work through all these feelings.
Peter made a helpless noise and hid his face behind his drawing. It didn’t matter if he was almost 18 years old, he felt like a 13 year-old again getting caught typing "boobies" into Google.
Steve held Tony close, their kissing sounding loud in the large, quiet room. Tony parted their lips to kiss Steve’s jaw, and then his neck, wanting to put his nose right where the man’s smell would be strongest. Steve let him, giving him access to his neck and then letting his hands slip down to cup Stark’s bottom.
“Thank you,” he said, smirking at the surprised puppy look Cap got at being man-handled all of a sudden. He wouldn’t mind spending a few more minutes in bed if it meant he got draw more of those addictive noises from Cap’s body.
Cap watched him with an expression he didn’t care to decipher. “Yeah, guess I will.” Steve watched him go, came over to him and clapped him on the shoulder. “It was good seeing you.”
Bucky smirked, he honestly didn’t bare any ill-will against Iron Man. That whole situation in the past was bad and they’d all made bad choices. After they’d lost against Thanos, he’d explained himself to the other man via a voice message (which he was pretty sure the other man had watched since they were on somewhat okay terms) because they were all that were left and he wanted to make an effort to try and be a normal person, for Steve and everyone. He wanted a taste of a normal life, and he started by apologizing in a rational way to a man he’d hurt in a way no other human should hurt another. He wanted to make it clear that he wasn’t the Winter Soldier. He was James Barnes, friend of Steve Roger and Howard Stark. Now that so much had happened, he actually found himself liking Tony. He was a strong willed, stubborn and petty man that reminded him so much of Howard, he was hard to really hate. He sincerely hoped Steve and Tony had a good time, however brief or casual.
“Nope, no, it really isn’t. You wanna do this thing or what? When the snow stops shitting on us, we can drive to the airport.”
“Yeah, I’ll take some. Let me get it.” Steve stood and began to divvy their portions, looking up when he turned to grab something and seeing a picture of Howard Stark on a shelf near the sink. Tony caught him looking at it and crossed his arms.
To him, even when Steve became Captain America, he still saw his Stevie, the tiny little 95 pound spitfire. The body he was in was just his personality personified, and Bucky had always thought the tiny scrapper was larger than life. He had deserved so much better than being a slave for the government, but it was what he’d wanted. Bucky was happy his tiny blond kickass from Brooklyn had realized his full potential and was stopping the kind of bullies no one else could.
“You know, it’s okay to like people. He’s an asshole, but he’s good for you,” Bucky said, a sly smirk forming on his lips. He had his arms crossed, the one from Wakanda still shining proudly against his body.
“Guys?!” he shouted in a cute high-pitched tone. Gross! It was like watching his two older brothers make-out. This was a huge surprise and honestly, he would never have guessed Quill was even a little gay with how much he talked about girls. Unless he was bi? He was happy for them and all but what was it with people not telling him things?! First Dad…now Quill…with
“Nothing. Just glad to be here. It didn’t stop snowing the whole drive down. You should see how high the snow is outside, it’s more snow than I’ve seen in ages. Thought I might have to stay in a hotel, pushed on anyway. What’s up with you? This looks interesting.”
“It’s my pleasure. I’ve got a thousand more lessons I could teach you, but you know, you’re a natural Cap.” Tony looked up at him and brought his hands back to himself. “The teacher has become the taught,” Tony laughed breathlessly, stepping away and anxiously going to retrieve his jacket.
Tony looked at him took a deep sigh and then nodded, rubbing his face. “Yeah, I can think of a few things.” He was half-joking.
Steve looked up, no anger in his eyes. “I really appreciate your concern Tony, but I’m alright. What about you?”
Tony could smell Steve when he was this close, even in a room filled with so many other people. He smelled strong, manly, and clean. He was warm. He was everything Tony thought he’d be if he ever got to get this close to him. The slow dancing pace was making him feel shy. He chanced a glance at Cap, only to immediately turn his head upon seeing that Cap had been watching him. He swallowed thickly and abruptly forgot what sort of playboy philanthropist sort of thing he was going to say.
Quill and Nebula couldn’t recall a time when Thor was ever this excited. The moment they landed the ship, he flew out of there, running faster than Quill knew he even could. His massive (sandaled) feet kicked up white clumps of sand. The beach they’d landed on was gorgeous with blue-green waters, and there were some tree-covered mountains in the distance. It was hot, and Peter was already feeling sweaty when he made his way out of the ship.
Steve held onto him looking annoyed and bored, but he still accepted his fate and passively allowed the other man to fly him up to the tower. It was quick and efficient after all, Cap was a huge fan of that. “I was expecting it this time.”
Each noise and movement went straight to Tony’s cock and prostate, and honestly he didn’t care to touch himself right now. This was all he wanted. He clenched his insides in a way he knew Cap would like, and that was a mistake because Cap gasped a high pitched noise that would haunt Tony’s wet dreams for weeks. He grabbed that handsome face and kissed him sloppily, Cap’s pace getting harder and quicker until the sound of their bodies slapping together grew loud and salacious.
The two locked eyes and Tony didn’t think he’d ever seen something so wrong and right in his whole life. Steve Rogers was standing there with wet lips and pink cheeks which were turning redder by the second. His hair was mussed, there was an obvious tent in his jeans, and he looked so panicked and beautiful all at once Tony just wanted to scream at him.
“Of sorts. It’s a multipurpose tool,” Tony put his own bowl of chili on the table and then disappeared, coming back with a little something he’d made for him. Honestly, Tony had meant to give the thing to Steve a while back, but he’d kept improving it. It was a new Captain America shield, it looked just like the one Cap had dropped and abandoned. Tony was an idiot and Cap deserved the shield, that’s just how it was. This one was made out of pure vibranium—with Okoye’s blessing—and some krykor from a far-off region of space. Upon stress tests, he’d found it was an even stronger sonoluminescent material, i.e. it converted extreme vibrations into light. It was more lightweight too, so now maybe it could be thrown even farther. Fuck, he loved himself. “Whaddya think? Thought it was about time you had it.”
“I want this. You’d know if I didn’t,” Tony said, gaze steady. He knew Cap was old-fashioned, but the other man clearly wanted it too, if his grip and not-so-small hard-on were anything to go by.
“It was just a date, Buck. It went really well. We ate dinner, saw a show…danced,” Steve’s eyes took on this almost dopey-cute look at the memory. Oh no. Bucky had seen that before.
Over the harsh rain, the only sound heard was the men groaning, shifting, or cursing at them in what sounded like French. Natasha came over too him panting. Her hat was gone and she was covered in white powder down one side. She was clutching her right arm and smirking at him.
Steve should’ve been surprised or something, but he was really just grateful. He was pretty certain this was going well. Hopping in the car, there was a small silence before he opened his mouth to speak and then double-chinned as his head was forced back into his headrest by Tony gunning it out of the driveway. He’d wished he could say he missed Tony’s driving.
Tony really didn’t want to get up and get a condom. He was so ready to swallow Steve’s beautiful dick he’d nearly forgotten about it entirely. He glanced over to his side table and then back at Steve. “Do you have anything?” He honestly didn’t think the man did.
“He called a fucking board meeting last Sunday for the company, and he gave this hour-long presentation about what he wanted to call Stark Solutions—a whole new branch based on renewable energy, food shortage science, novel engines, waste management ideas—” Tony held his chin, grinning to himself. “He basically managed to convince my most important board members to begin planning out and budgeting for what he called ‘The Imminent Future.’ God, Steve, you should have seen him. In a suit and freaking high tops.” Tony was so proud of him. Though Stark Industries has worked on renewable energy, most of his company was focused on other forms of high technology. There was never an entire branch dedicated specifically to such a large and noble purpose. “He sold it like a real pro, convincing them it’d be ‘marketable’ and it would be great for our image if we announced it live. I mean, I could create whatever branch I wanted when I wanted, but he managed to convince everyone else first. He was fantastic.”
The very image of Steve holding another man to the wall and kissing the crap out of him kept Tony company late at night. Even when they were fighting. He wished he could feel bad about it, but he really didn’t. That night had opened a flood gate of strange sexual tension between them that lasted all the way up until Cap broke his heart figuratively and literally with that damned shield.
“If Stark felt anything toward me he would have told me or shown me by now. If you haven’t noticed, he’s just like his dad…as much as he hates it.”
“Hey, c’mere,” Steve said softly, pulling Tony to him and rubbing the side of his arm. “Think you’d sleep better tonight if I stayed in here with you?”
Steve grinned a dazzling (and shit eating) smile, obviously knowing exactly what he was doing. “Well?” He poured syrup on his own breakfast, still looking sly.
As they all sat there and ate a five-star canned spaghetti sauce dinner, things felt right. He and Steve were alright, even after all that had happened. Somehow, they were still brothers. If someone would have asked him which of them would have figuratively settled down first, Bucky would have definitely not chosen himself. Yet here he was, left knee bumping Natasha’s to a cute secret rhythm, giving her looks whenever she met his eye. She needed Bucky, and he didn’t realize how badly he’d needed her. Her emotions were coiled up tightly within her, especially with all that stuff going on with Clint. Bucky was just thankful she’d found purpose doing the one job that was harder than all of the rest—being the head of the Avengers.
Steve smirked with one side of his mouth. It was a lovely thing, and suddenly Tony felt exceptionally proud of him. “Why don’t you go tell Nat or Sam? It’ll make you feel better, I promise.”
Still gripping Tony’s waist, Steve took a step back and looked down at him. When Tony finally got up the oomph to look Steve in the eyes, he realized it was a big mistake. The other man was watching him so calmly and sweetly, face more handsome and angular in the dim shadows of the jazzy dancefloor. “Tony?”
time. Just as the pair really got jamming, she noticed their message signal was beeping. Quill was off in his own world, mouth full of Gears Shift brand gummy straws, dancing in his socks and undershirt. It was how he dealt with things. He’d even packed on quite a few pounds from sadness-eating. God, he was pathetic but she still managed to like him.
“Hey, man,” Quill said, setting the box down on the porch. It was a bright sunny day at the cabin. Tony sometimes wondered if the spaceman missed Earth, even if the star guy had told him that being on Earth made him uncomfortable. By the slightly-hung over irritated look Quill was giving the sun, he guessed probably not even a little at the moment.
“So! Tony wanted a suit that could handle space. For like, a long time right? And I was like, ‘Why not space stuff?!’ And so he’s making his version, and I’m making mine. You should see what his can do, it’s incredible…but I’m pretty proud of mine so far. Y’know how in submarines the soldiers have soda lime all over the place to absorb carbon dioxide? Well, it can’t convert it to oxygen, but I was thinking—what if there was a space chemical that could do that, and run off of your body heat? Turns out—there’s not! There’s stuff that’s
Meanwhile, he heard Friday reiterate that no one was home to their unwanted guest. Peter heard Captain Rogers calling, “Hello? Is Tony there?”
Stark blinked, heat roiling in his groin, and he quickly stood to join him, the idea sounding suddenly pretty freaking good. Steve took Tony to his own bedroom on the residential floor—of course it was cleaner than a barrack—and the moment they were inside he kissed him, pressing Tony up against the door. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, hungry for him. Steve kissed him wetly, opening his mouth and shoving their bodies together. Tony’s tongue wrapped around Steve’s and he moaned as Steve pulled their bodies close.
“I’ll get it,” she said, already knowing it was going to turn into a game of nose-ghost that ended in shouting.
Aedi was a beautiful planet that looked a lot like Earth. It was home to the Aedians, a cone-headed species of noseless aliens that were all very snooty. They weren’t unkind however, and once warned they were coming in for landing to pick up someone, let the Guardians into their airspace. The Aedians were a protective community, and one of the few species of aliens whose whole planet was at peace. Their planet thrived on an atmosphere similar to Earth’s but with more oxygen.
“Prouder! And Aunt May, she would have loved this. I can’t believe it…I’m actually gonna help so many people…” Peter’s eyes were wide and he just took a deep breath. “When I can’t stand anymore business meetings, I can still be Spider-Man. The world still needs Spider-Man…”
Tony used to get tested all the time, and since Pepper was as clean as a whistle, he knew he was alright. “Same. Can I just go for it? It’s a huge inconvenience for me to get up. I’m good if you are.” Tony’s bed was so big, it would indeed take effort to reach the side table.
“Been putting Peter through school. Making new tech. Constantly being 100% cooler than the other parents. Right, Pete?”
For about three minutes there was a heavy, awkward silence filled only by the sound of Peter’s thumbs tapping on his phone.
They just breathed each other and kissed, both refusing to move. The afterglow bliss didn’t last long as Tony cussed quietly, shifting one of his legs which was starting to cramp.
“Well, I’m beat, I think I’m gonna go to bed,” Peter said, eating the last cherry off his plate and standing up. He had been wearing the shirt Star-Lord got him for about three days in a row. It rode up a little when he stretched his arms above his head, going around and hugging everyone’s face who was sitting at the table.. “G’night,” he called. The Avengers watched him go after giving him a chorus of good-nights.
In fact, it almost seemed like he and Steve were getting along too well. Later that night when it was just the two of them and Nat had gone to bed, he wanted to ask him about something that had been weighing on his mind as of late. There was no one on Earth or in space that knew Steve better than him, which was why…
And he was kissing him. Steve was kissing him, and he was kissing him back. Overwhelmed and suddenly breathless, Tony immediately grabbed Steve by the biceps and leaned up to kiss him harder and with a better angle. He wanted this so bad, was this happening? Oh, God, oh fuck, his mind completely left him as his lower jaw gently moved to slot his own lips against Cap’s lips in ways that had his stomach feeling like he’d gone down a rollercoaster. He was too god damn old for this many butterflies.
Steve flexed the fingers on one hand, squeezing them into a fist. A part of him was suddenly thankful he finally had a reason to talk to Tony—a real reason. Not just an, “I missed you Tony.” He did miss him. He missed him so much his heart hurt at the thought of seeing him. No matter what had happened between them, Cap was always the one ready to move on and just, be friends again. It was Tony who held onto the resentment like a bad cough.
“Good,” Tony said, sitting up and stretching. “Would giving me a blow job be too much for you right now? Wanna try it?”
“We will be there,” Nebula confirmed. Nebula was actually good at disguises unlike a certain hairy god.
“Yeah, for sure. I didn’t even finish elementary school. The kid’s a genius,” Star-Lord said, nodding his head. “Love that little dude.” After the Peters argued for hours about pop culture, they did discover that they had more in common than either of them could have ever known. And as they slowly starved to death, they’d become very good friends. Quill would die for that kid any day, and Peter had started thinking of him like a big brother. His superhero family was the only family Parker had left. Even if his older brother was now a bum from space. And his older sister wasn’t even human. “Welp,” Quill slapped the table, startling Thor into jerking awake again. “Time to hit the ol’ dusty trail. Got shit to hock! Yes!”
The papers were the property deeds, floor plans, stock inventories, and other papers regarding the Stark Solutions complex. It was beautiful ten story building only an hour away from Avengers HQ. It had been designed to be modern, sleek, and strong in the event of an attack. There were other buildings for different divisions around it, and it all had been completed in less than four months. Tony made sure of it. He’d wanted it to be done by the time Peter graduated, and other than the initial design phase, tried to keep Peter in the dark about its progress. Peter had been so busy, he hadn’t even asked, assuming it was going to take much longer.
Steve immediately jerked his head away from his current partner and stepped away from the guy in a second’s beat.
“Uh, huh, yeah. Much better than a motorcycle,” he purred, even though Steve wasn’t in the room for him to rub it in.
Tony looked up at him, rolling his jaw and nodding. The idea of not being alone in his bed that night sounded just fantastic suddenly. “Yeah. Only if you don’t mind having 12% of the bed.”
“Bucky?” Nat said, feet propped up on her desk. She looked a little less miserable than normal and she was sipping a diet soda. Bucky was in a chair in front of her, helping her look over notes and cases. The pair had began to tackle Avengers business together, it felt kind of like he was the Maria Hill in this situation, but he didn’t really mind. He thought that lady was badass, even if he’d never gotten the chance to meet her.
Peter, whose hair was messier than usual, was gesturing wildly to a glowing box with a shiny cloud of nano-particles swirling about. They were in the (actually very) secret garage underneath Tony’s cabin. It was three stories down, humongous, and had three hidden entrances; one in the house, one super long tunnel that went all the way to the other side of the woods, and one that rose up and opened in the middle of the lake near the cabin. It reminded him of an old SHIELD base, it was pretty neat.
Tony sighed, the kid was a great freaking driver even without his spider-sense. Still didn’t mean he liked the sound of it at all. “Maybe. Graduate first.”
Bucky nodded, pleased with himself. “Just try. That’s all I want.” Bucky gave Cap his most shit-eating smirk and then nodded. “Okay. Want to help me eat the rest of these?”
“There they are,” Rhodey said, pointing at a blip on the monitor. Rhodey flew the quinjet down near the water’s surface, letting it hover just above the waves.
As far as Bucky knew, poor Steve’s love affairs had always been short, brief and catastrophic. He wondered if Steve even knew what he really wanted or needed. Sharon was dusted, Peggy had passed, and Howard was long married and gone. He hoped Steve could find something real and good, too. He deserved it. It was only matters of the heart that Steve was ever uncertain about, it wasn’t like a battle. A tactical mind couldn’t really help a damaged heart that still belonged to a 95 pound rascal in a super-soldier’s body.
Tony took a deep breath and turned to glance at Steve before staring at the road intensely. “I did think about it.”
The taller man spun Tony out, and then chuckled when Tony shot him a playful pouty look. Steve was a wonderful dancer, and he was so confident and happy looking it really was infectious. Tony let himself be dipped (not very low) and full-on laughed when Steve popped him back up. Steve picked up the pace, and the two found an easy rhythm with each other. By the time the second or third song ended, Tony was panting and Steve was flushed from something that looked a lot like joy. Honestly some people were staring at them, but Steve didn’t seem to care. Tony certainly didn’t give a rip. They walked over to the bar. Tony got a martini and Steve got a coke. They drank in silence before Tony turned to him and said over the music, “What you wanted?” Tony had loosened a few of his shirt buttons and taken his suit jacket completely off. Steve was still in his full suit and everything.
Tony shrugged, closing the door and then getting back in bed. Once he was all covered up he threw his arms above his head, under his pillow, and then laid his head down. He looked up at Steve with an actual smile. “He’s my kid.”
On the way home, Tony let Steve choose the radio station. Of course, he chose an oldies channel. Luckily, oldies these days consisted more of 70s songs than old showtunes. Steve tended to find the 70s stuff more palatable it seemed. Tony drove slower now that it was late and lightly sleeting. Every now and then he’d glance over, just to find Cap staring out the window all thoughtful-like. Tonight was really not what he was expecting. It seemed like it had turned into a real date, and Tony wasn’t even mad about it. It was nice. Unexpected, but nice.
“It’s a tick. Okay, y’know what, since you’re not used to all this and I am, I’ll tone it down for you. Real kosher stuff, no yacht. Mostly. Besides, I’ve always wanted to see you in a fitted suit.”
As Cap’s thrusts became more sloppy and frantic, Tony really ground his hips against him, biting his lip and wondering if he’d need to pump himself at all at this rate. His mind was beginning to go blank and all he could feel and hear was Steve, as his body demanded more. He felt his hips lurch and twitch as his balls drew in tighter, oh fuck yes, he was going to come just like this.
“It’s fine, I like it,” Tony said, taking a deep breathe and looking down at Steve’s length still in his hand. “You taste good Rogers. All of you.” He was so hard he thought he might actually die.
“Okay,” Tony slurred against their kiss, arms gripping the material of the other man’s shirt. “Okay,” he repeated, pushing Steve back a few steps. Steve let himself be guided backward until he just broke the kiss, took Tony by the waist and led him to the elevator. Tony couldn’t keep his hands off of the other man now that he had permission and ran one of them up and down Rogers’ back. Once the button was pushed and it opened, Steve pulled Tony inside in a fashion that reminded him of their dance. Charmer.
Steve watched him and just chuckled at his back as they pair went upstairs and enjoyed some music. They scrolled through missions, reports, new movies, new music, and Peter’s Official Spider-Man™ tweets while Tony cooked. He didn’t like cooking before the Snap, but now he found it kind of cathartic. Pepper always called him a huge man-baby for only learning how to mix drinks and make sandwiches.
“I do,” Cap nearly whispered, nipping Tony’s bottom lip and then capturing his mouth again in a salacious French kiss.
“So, first thing’s first. Dinner. Then a show. There is a Cirque du Soleil show in town, and those are literally the only kind of shows I like. It’ll be great. Even if the ones in Vegas are better.”
The elevator went down to the basement quickly. It was a floor like the penthouse, accessible only to other Avengers and Happy. As the doors opened, it was Tony who half kissed-half dragged Steve away from the elevator and into his not-so-used room. It was a big studio-style modern apartment that didn’t look like it was underground. The ceilings were high, the floors were a lovely matte black wood, and the décor was luxuriously cozy.
“Who ya messaging, Nebula?” Quill sat down in a chair, tossing the candy to Thor who ripped into the package and just ate a roll of the gummy straws like a sausage.
“Wow, what kind of things?” Steve had this funny little smirk that Tony thought looked almost flirty-sarcastic.
The kid’s eyes were wide and he just rubbed his face, not even knowing how to process the information. “It’s done…I mean…it’s there…it’s real…”
“I was just curious to what kind of party they were having. I was shocked to see so much…freedom of expression. There were men and women holding hands and dancing,” Cap’s eyes softened. “It was nice. I’d seen it on the television, and in movies sometimes these days, but I’d never seen how far we’ve really come with my own two eyes. Sometimes it feels good be reminded of what all these battles we keep fighting are for in the first place.” Cap put his hands on his hips and looked down. “It wasn’t like this where I’m from, you know that. I mean, you would’ve gotten arrested for holding another man’s hand.”
Peter ran downstairs, wanting to excitedly tell Quill all about his new compound but nearly fell over a chair when he saw what the hell Thor and Quill were doing.
Tony had always liked Steve. He knew for a fact that if he’d found out Cap was gay earlier than 2016, he might have tried to get in his pants.
Steve turned and kissed his ear, hands still feeling up his body. “Okay,” Steve agreed, seeming excited for it. Tony liked how even though Steve was a confident and open lover, sometimes he was shy and adorably eager. Tony had begun to wonder if that super-serum made him horny because of just how much Steve seemed to enjoy and initiate intimacy when given the chance. It made him eat everything in the freaking compound, and he had energy for days, so he thought it made sense.
“Been real busy, Cap. Had things going on. But, it turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.”
“You guys and your freakin’ shawarma. I swear.” Sam grinned, having already downed a few beers too many.
“A lot of kids aren’t being forced to go to school until they’re ready, but Mr. Parker here’s got himself a future business to run, so I put my proverbial foot down.”
Tony blinked. “Alright then why not?” They walked down the street, and Cap hailed a cab. Once they were in, Steve told the driver to go to an address Tony wasn’t familiar with. Once they got inside, it seemed to be a sort of lounge that catered to jazzy music and it had a huge dancefloor where some couples and individuals were dancing to a medium-paced song played by a live band. It was a happening and swanky place, Tony actually kind of liked it.
“Hello, I’m Peter Quill, people call me Star-Lord,” he said, standing taller than usual and resisting the urge to deepen his voice. “Captain of that ship.”
Steve looked up at him through his eyelashes, crossing his arms and then leaning back in his chair, “Okay.”
By the time Quill woke up, his body felt heavy, but he wasn’t in pain anymore. He rolled over and groaned, staring at the ceiling and coughing. God that sucked. The sound of a song softly playing filled him with some joy, there was nothing he liked more than waking up to Bill Withers’ smooth voice. “Ain’t No Sunshine” was playing quietly as he sauntered on up the stairs to the cockpit of the ship. The brilliant colors of space and stars streamed by the windows, casting ghostly colorful light on the metal of the ship’s interior. One of his favorite parts about being the captain—and he was the captain, absolutely not Thor—was this part. Watching the stars go quietly, but that was the problem. Space was too quiet.
“Me? Oh, Mr. Rogers, please go on,” he smirked, taking Cap’s helmet from him as they entered the tower penthouse. They were the only resident Avengers home except for Nat (who had decided she was going to investigate the terrorists’ suppliers). Tony tossed Cap’s helmet on a nearby couch and then leaned against the bar. He was wearing dark jeans, converse, and a Play Station shirt. “Like what you see?”
“Don’t make a habit of it or I’ll sell your car,” Stark said as they both headed down the stairs together.
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed as he put one hand on his hip and leaned so close to the window it fogged with his breath, eyes unfocused on the scene outside. “Still?”
He heard Nat shout, one of the only noises in the world that ever put him into a mindset he absolutely hated. His thoughts were suppressed, and he wasn’t holding back his actions anymore. If Nat was hurt, he needed to stop messing around. He couldn’t see her. His body knew what it could do and it did it, hurling men into walls, kicking them unconscious, firing at them quickly, and generally being a beast. He heard Nat speaking to him but couldn’t hear what she was saying over the machine gun fire and shouting.
“In three days. He’s picking me up from here.” Cap made a noise to himself and then sat down, shaking his head.
“So this is the part where I leave, and we tell our friends through text how dreamy the other was,” Tony said, suddenly realizing that Cap had moved him so far back he was only inches from being against the wall, caged by the other’s bigger body.
“I am literally starving to death here—trust me, I know what it feels like—and so’s the kid.” Tony said as he was already walking straight past Steve and out of the door.
Cap was rubbing circles in the middle of Tony’s back, and walked him down to Tony’s basement apartment. Cap followed him in, sitting on the corner of the brunet’s bed and just watching him.
“Aw…I’m sorry Stevie. How can I ever make it up to you?” Stark said, shoving his ass against Steve’s hands and effectively impaling himself. “Oh, mm…” He turned back to look at Steve who was giving him that quirked eyebrow of amusement. He met it with one of his own.
Tony whimpered and bared his neck in submission, his right hand having disappeared in his pants, clearly jerking off to the dominant behaviour in front of him. God, he was so fucked. He never meant to be confronted by the Alpha he was lusting after during his heat. He was so damn fucked. Only problem, he wasn’t literally being fucked. Damn his Omega brain.
“It won’t be long,” Steve called after him just as Mr. Johnson placed a photo of himself as a kid in a Captain America costume on the desk.
Steve happily bit down lightly on the man’s neck and shoved his cock in one more time, knot completely deflating and tying the two heroes together. The grunts that followed, a sign of the blond cuming inside the smaller man, marking him up while his dick was massaged by the hot walls, reached the Omega’s ears.
With that she turned on her heel and left towards the exit of the lab. The Omega, who was still taking in the words and the rare willing display of affection coming from the former assassin whirled around before Natasha could vanish completely.
“MOM YOU’RE BACK!”, the excited, unmistakable voice of his youngest pup Peter came from the doorway.
In the process of turning the Omega managed, like the graceful person Tony was, to turn widely and ultimately rub up against the Alpha’s crotch. Which was, hard, rock hard. The blond let out a low grumble at the contact and Tony could feel heat rushing to his cheeks, pheromones spiking at the sudden wave of pleasure.
Peter smiled at the Alpha, getting into the car with a quick jump he was already thinking about his plan for the school day with a gleeful expression. Today would be interesting.
Steve was also strangely enjoying the day, spending time with Peter and his friends while visiting classes. It was nice, getting to know the young Omega on such a personal level. No regrets were present anymore in his mind, all replaced with ease and gratefulness to be able to experience such a moment.
Without sounding full of himself the Omega knew he was more than a handful, someone difficult to handle, a person who liked to rile people up for fun, especially Alphas and who’s already got two teenage pups. Damaged goods like he preferred to call himself.
The Alpha nodded eagerly, thankful enough he didn’t get kicked out when Tony opened the present. It was a risky move, but god, so worth it.
“Peter, kid, tell me how I can help you,” the man said carefully from next to the pup. He didn’t dare move closer not wanting to startle the Omega so soon after being tormented by other Alphas.
“The Iron family is clearly playing a torturous game of tickles! Yet, all of you have lost to the mighty God of Thunder, be honored, my small Alpha friend!”, the loud booming voice of the Alpha sounded through the room.
The screech of a chair could be heard as the Alpha tried to move closer, leaning over the table and gently gripping the small hand in his. Now was the time to ask Tony. He just hoped the man finally understood his sincere intention.
Steve remembers that he had felt light-headed, when reading article after article about LGBT-people, and of their history and plight. Eventually, he had somehow found his way to reading articles about himself in connection with this LGBT-community, how some people thought he was against them, or how he was actually a member of the community, or just people wondering about his thought on the subject. His heart had pounded, fast and hard against his chest, as if it wasn’t sure if it wanted to leap out and fight or run away and hide. Cold shivers had run up and down his spine. He stopped reading and had to go to do something else, physically challenging, after he read an article which said that, surely Captain America couldn’t be against gays, one of his team members was bisexual.
“I know it’s hard for some people to accept themselves. I can only imagine how you feel. But I, I don’t hate myself because I like guys, too. And you shouldn’t either. I don’t think anyone who you are close to could hate you because you’re gay… At first it was hard, for me, to accept or to even realize it. I tried to hide and forget about it. I would only be with girls, and I thought that I was predatory for even thinking about holding someone’s hand. I guess I’m lucky to an extent, since I’m bi. I could hide it, and I still liked girls. But that’s no living. Hiding like that and being ashamed. It’s just not”, Tony says. He pauses for a moment, and then says:
“But don’t think that I’m lucky that I’m bisexual, like I can just choose who I like and who I want to be with. It doesn’t work like that. I do have a preference for girls, I won’t lie about that, I just do. It made it easier, I guess. I could focus on that, act like I was straight. But once in a while I’d see some guy, and just fall for him. I’d fall head over heels for some guys and I would feel so confused. I didn’t realize you could like both, you know, I thought I was the only one. It must have been different for you… I think you’re so brave for even letting yourself admit to yourself, and now to me, that you’re gay. That’s always the hardest step. It’s gets easier after this. I promise. And I will always be here, if you need me to. I won’t let you fall.”
The rollercoaster of feelings keeps on going, and the content blissfulness in Steve metamorphoses into bitter mixture of happiness, anger, and sadness. Mainly sadness, the bittersweet kind.
“Are you cold? I’m cold”, Tony says, and stands up. He pulls Steve up as well, and soon after lets go of Steve’s hand, but it doesn’t matter. It’s almost like a non-verbal promise, that Tony will wait for Steve, with open arms.
“Sorry, I’m bad at this”, Tony says. He takes off his sunglasses and massages his temples with his free hand. Steve feels his treacherous heart jumping, as Tony runs his fingers along his goatee. Steve notices, how tense his upper body is, and forcibly relaxes it. He takes the sketchbook out again, and with it a blue ballpoint pen. He opens a new page, and draws a delicate line, then stops and looks at Tony. He wants to say something but as soon as he opens his mouth, he feels something reaching into his mouth and strangling his vocal cords. Steve turns back to his sketchbook, and feels Tony’s eyes fleetingly on him.
– deflected the question on his behalf and started talking about something else. It was good, that he hadn’t asked what the letters stood for, he doesn’t even like to think about how he would have reacted or what he would have said. He researched it when he got the chance to be alone, sure that no one would walk in on him. LGBT, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. On some websites, he noticed, some letters, like A or Q or even the plus-sign, had been added to the end, but the stem of the acronym stayed the same. There were several new words he had to look up, and several words that weren’t in the use anymore, as far as he could tell. That was good, Steve had thought, he never quite liked those words – especially when they had left his own mouth, and how they seemed to sour the air around them.
Steve stops drawing. The pen feels cold and clammy in his hand, and it slips on the page leaving behind a trail of blue spots. He looks at Tony. His eyes are brown, and sad. It’s such a clash; Brown is such a warm color, but all Steve sees in them is blue. Tony’s mouth twitches, and he licks his teeth, mouth opening a bit. Steve thinks he’s abhorrent for finding Tony sexy in such a state of mind.
“I just feel – I feel like I’m, I’m being selfish”, Steve says, and his voice feels skinned, and too high, but sounds steady, and low, “like I’m stealing something, something I don’t need or deserve. Thinking about what I want, it – it makes me so darned happy. I feel like I’m floating. But I don’t think I deserve to get happiness like – like that… Do you know what I mean? Like, somehow I’m hurting others because I’m such a bad person – wanting something so selfish like that.”
Of course, Tony happens, and there’s a change in Steve’s plans, but it’s fine, he thinks, these weren’t important plans set in stone. Tony does that, mixes up Steve’s plans and thoughts. Most of the time, Steve doesn’t mind, loves it even.
Steve runs normally. He punches things, lifts things, and kicks things, usually. Today he feels like it’s a slow day, the type of day you can’t outrun. He feels like walking around. Looking at things, and listening to nothing. It’s a slow, slow day, hopefully. He takes a smaller, cheaper sketchbook and some pencils with him.
“I think I do. You want to talk about it? Ask me something? Honestly, there’s a reason for my reputation. I’m a whore, there’s nothing I haven’t tried or at least heard of, so... Oh fuck, sorry”, Tony splutters. He can see how Steve’s pen stops suddenly, how he closes his eyes for a second too long, how his eyebrows knit together. “…I guess, you want to start with something, ah, not explicit? See, I told you I’m bad at this. Sorry.”
“I don’t know.” He glances at Tony, who looks extremely uncomfortable. Steve isn’t surprised, Tony isn’t one for hard discussions about feelings and emotions. They have spent enough time alone for Steve to notice, how easily Tony dances around words to avoid speaking about subjects he isn’t comfortable with. Steve doesn’t know what exactly they are going to talk about, but he knows that this occasion is considerably different than any other interaction they have had in the past. But he does have an inkling of what Tony’s getting at.  Somehow it feels incredibly flattering, that Tony is willing to force himself in to this situation.
He still holds Tony’s hand, when he puts the pen between the pages of his sketchbook, and clumsily tucks them into his back bag. Tony’s chatter fills Steve’s head, and his heart. A gooey happiness oozes out of Tony’s hand into Steve’s bloodstream, and it soon fills his whole body. Steve smiles, and thinks that he doesn’t have to be in control all the time, and that some lines in his life he can learn to cross over, and erase.
“What do you mean? I don’t think you’re being selfish. It isn’t selfish or bad or in any way wrong to want something good for yourself. Pursuing happiness is a human right, you know, and wanting happiness, no matter what kind of happiness, it isn’t bad. It’s good. You’re good. God’s sake, you’re Captain America! If anyone deserved happiness, it’s you! Want – heck, need! – is not, and will never be wrong. And you aren’t selfish. You’re not. There’s nothing wrong with you, Steve, you’re not hurting anyone.” Tony’s voice rises at the middle and drops to a warm comfort at the end. He gives a Steve a hopeful and encouraging smile. His hands are shaking ever so slightly, Steve notes.
To some extent Tony did blame himself. It was his fault Harley was never able to learn how to actually deal with older Alphas, most importantly how to deal with his mother’s heat mates when the heat cycle was over. An important lesson for overly protective pups and another big factor in understanding the three dynamics.
Now, seeing all the Avengers, even Natasha, looking caught off guard and at a loss for words was a sight to behold, if you asked Tony. But, well, he understood the situation pretty well, since it was Peter they were talking about. Sweet, polite and friendly, looking like an actual puppy, Peter. His kid who still prefered his school lunches without crust around the bread, the kid who cried when he stepped on a butterfly once and the kid who took naps with Tony every Friday, when he visited the tower after school, tired out of his mind.
Steven Grant Rogers was just too perfect for his own good. A person would be mental not to fall in love with the legendary Alpha.
The young Omega blushed lightly at the question which received a mischievous grin from Harley beside him. “Go on, tell Mom about your breathtaking idea, a true contribution to the science world”, the young Alpha nudged the boy with his elbow.
Taking in the scene in front of him, still with a half asleep brain, the pup started purring right away out of pure happiness. The warmth and close proximity to his Omega parent and sibling made his scent glands emit a strong wave of content Omega smell, branding the whole nest. Peter nuzzled closer to his family, damn, he could stay like that forever.
Steve’s brows furrowed at the answer as he picked up the sour scent of the pup next to him, clearly filled with worry and misery at the state of one of his family’s pack members.
And to Tony’s surprise a pleasant smell of bacon and scrambled eggs reached his nose making his stomach release another deep growl. Food.
Steve was so sure, sure this was going to work this time. But damn it! How should he have known Tony was allergic to tulips, tulips out of every flower there was?!
Well, not really ‘dreaded’. It was mostly Tony’s anxiety talking and making him feel like the date was already doomed from the beginning, not even worth attending cause he would fuck up anyway, like usually when it came to relationships.
The boy was still mainly uncomfortable with the unwanted attention but tried to pump himself up for his history class and the hopefully defeated look of his asshole of a teacher when the boy held his presentation.
Much like Mrs. Adams the other teachers quickly welcomed the Avenger with open arms, probably to starstruck to do anything else in the presence of a national hero. As well as the students who kept staring at him awed, some even being brave enough to approach him and ask for an autograph.
Like that the two stayed on the floor curled up against each other and ever so slowly the pup soon had his nose pressed up right against the Alpha’s scent mark on his neck, practically sitting in Steve’s lap who was still purring loudly and stroking through the teen’s hair with one hand.
Another minute passed in silence, with awkwardness rising exponentially at the table. Steve was getting nervous, he waited so long for this date to happen and now, now that he actually got Tony to agree to come here today his mind was blank. They basically already knew almost everything about each other, spending these past years together as team mates, so what could Steve still ask the man.
“No Steve. What I need to do is make my kids something to eat and you should leave”, the Omega bit out. Just anything to escape the dreaded after heat talk.
“Now, I need some coffee or else I’m gonna die in the next few minutes and you don’t want that, do you Platypus?”, Tony whined and tugged at the sleeve of the Alpha beside him, received a fond eye roll in the process.
The Omega could suddenly feel eyes on him, looking across the table he saw Steve grinning at him from ear to ear bashfully, clearly still feeling sorry from before. Rolling his eyes playfully the genius returned the smile, not being able to resist the Alpha any longer.
The man in front quickly parked the car right in front of the school and looked at his watch. “Five minutes, kid. Better hurry though.”
That traitor! His instincts just couldn’t act normal around the Alpha once, could they? Inwardly cursing his biology Tony squeezed his eyes shut, not wanting to face the reality of his actions and one side of him already planning how to flee without the man behind him noticing.
Turning around again, shaking off Natasha’s hand in the process, Tony came face to face with Steve again, who was casually leaning against the door frame, arms crossed observing the scene peacefully.
“Welcome to the land of the living, Pete. Did you sleep well?”, his Dad asked, smiling as he saw his son walk in sleepily in his pyjamas.
The young Alpha sleepily watched his Omega parent, having been alarmed by the pure distress of two Omega’s in his close proximity and as the only Alpha around he had to make sure they were alright. Even if it cost him another hour of blissful dreaming in the softest bed ever. Family was more important.
Soon enough they arrived at a big brick building with several kids in front, Midtown Middle School, a school focused on science and technology. A perfect place for kids like Harley and Peter.
This time, plan D, he prepared to give the Omega something more personal, which took the man more time than he’d like to admit.
After a few seconds Jarvis already announced his arrival and the Alpha was nervously sweating now, scent full of anxiety and worry.
Turns out he was right. The boy waved him off right away, saying he wasn’t good at writing essays anyway and if Peter wanted a good grade he’s have to do it, plain and simple.
When they reached the floor of the common room Pepper wasted no more time and swiftly excited the elevator while taking hold of Harley’s arms in the process, forcing out a fed up “Hey” from the boy. Tony only was able to catch another glimpse of Harley’s hair as they already vanished behind a corner, obviously following loud noises coming from the living room.
After two days, he was exhausted and he still wasn’t nearly done with the essay. Dark, purple bags under his eyes and trembling hands reached for the coffee machine on the counter, while his ears were slightly ringing.
At the same time his youngest pup slowly uncurled himself from the makeshift human ball still pretty shaken from the extreme scents and pheromones, now meekly watching his mother with curiosity. Another omegan whine was close to being released from his mouth out of pure intake of the disappointed scent emitting from the older Omega. At least the Alpha growling stopped, his brain delivered.
The genius laughed and nuzzled Steve’s neck breathing in the smell that was so unmistakably Steve Roger. He was in love.
The genius gladly let himself be pulled along, all aboard to see the dominate sight of Steve, even if it was just being lead around. He had fantasies, like any person, no matter if Alpha, Omega or Beta, had. “Ay ay Cap, just lead the way.”
Together the three walked to the elevator, Pepper leading the way with quick steps, her heels noticeably clicking on the ground, a well known sound around the tower.
The sight that greeted him didn’t ease his distress at all and rather made him emit another pitiful whimper.
Steve Rogers deserved the world and Tony was only an unworthy man, sinking in between anxiety and insecurity. And then there was the simple fact of him being damaged goods, used before, body run-down due to two birthings. No sane Alpha wanted someone like Tony.
A  deep sigh could be heard next to him as another presence came to a stop beside the genius, kicking some feathers out of the way in the process.
Wordlessly Steve watched both Omegas leave through the entrance to the kitchen, awed and maybe, perhaps, a little scared of Peter’s similarity to Tony. Genius parent with genius kids, he chuckled to himself before following them with a slow pace.
“You think Sam acts like a child?”, Steve asked with eyes trained on the weather forecast for the next days.
“Oi Pete, you’re not the only one in the nest!”, Harley remarked with a slight grin on his face while retreating from his mother’s neck.
A few minutes passed with heavy breathing sounding through the dark room. Both men tried to catch their breaths, being exhausted from the sheer blissful orgasms both just experimented.
“Mom look what somebody left in the fridge!”, the happy voice of Peter suddenly cut through his mind hollering loudly from the kitchen.
The young Alpha was leaning against the doorframe of his mother’s bedroom, intensely staring at the two adults and especially the dressed up Omega in the middle of the room. A happy scent, he was already able to smell down the hallway a few seconds ago, clouded his mind and making his own instincts react positively.
The boy left and Steve let out a sigh relieved but nonetheless still in shock at the sheer attitude of the young kids based on something uncontrollable like their dynamic. It was such an old mindset it even surprised the man out of time, who was glad it was overly better for Omegas these days. But apparently that did not change school bullies.
The sound of happy Omega, of a happy Tony, was so pleasing and probably his favourite. Not counting the moans and whimpers Steve was already able to hear though. No, these sounds weren’t comparable.
Tony was glad, that he didn’t lose Steve as a friend, but gained something else entirely. It was a step forward, the relation of the situation. Maybe he really should rethink Natasha’s words from that morning.
Please leave kudos and comments if you liked the chapter <3 What do you guys think will happen during the mission?
The blond was cut off, brunette Omega now in front of him with a grin and leaning closer. The lips that met his were warm, soft and oh so inviting. Forgetting about whatever he was trying to say the Alpha quickly wrapped an arm around the shorter male, let out a growl and accepted the kiss. Quickly taking over he opened his mouth, letting his tongue trace the full lips of the Omega in his arms and silently asking for entrance which the genius gladly allowed.
Alpha instincts worked like that. Higher ranked Alphas had to show off their dominance to teach young Alphas the importance of ranks and dynamics. It was all a part of growing and mostly playful.
The Alpha in front of him, though, took the words at heart right away and placed his hands on the Omega’s shoulders caringly, which startled the taken back man in the process. “Tony, please tell me you slept more than three hours last night.” His voice was heavy with concern and eyes filled with worry.
Peter furrowing his brows and cocking his head to the side looked up at his mother, grinning cutely. “Technically, though, the rule doesn’t apply since we’re currently living in a tower.”
Innerly, however, Tony was still pretty much freaking out, not grasping the concept of Steve, the Steven Grant Rogers, trying to court him. Him! A damaged Omega! What a joke his brain only delivered.
The silence that followed covered the table in an awkward atmosphere, everyone now concentrated on their food.
“Now what’s this about, kid?”, Steve asked when they came to a stop in the library of the common floor.
“Hello Mr. Johnson! What do you mean, sir? I’m just preparing to present my project,” he admitted with raised eyebrow.
So there he was, a perfect looking chocolate muffin with icing and red and gold sprinkles placed on top. Such a pleasant looking present, the Alpha could only purr in satisfaction and looked forward to giving said Omega his first, technically second, courting gift.
“I should have known better and left before anything got out of control”, Steve concluded for the Omega with a shameful expression. “I’m so sorry Tony, but, god, my instincts wouldn’t let me leave. My inner Alpha so desperately needed to see you after-”
“You’re overly bright, but your talent of getting yourself into dangerous situations is outstanding, pup”, Tony sighed. “Reminds me a lot of myself”.
Tony presented his neck at the slight use of the Alpha voice and moaned out in want and lust. Head resting on the bedding and throat including scent glands in perfect view for the Alpha, he stared at the man beneath his lashes with a loose grin. “Okie dokie, Alpha.”
Steve chuckled from behind him and trusted his three fingers against the Omega’s prostate firmly, forcing another moan from Tony’s mouth. “Keep sucking, I’m close too, Omega”, he ordered lightly.
Natasha saw the realization in his eyes and jumped down from the table, coming to a stand beside the speechless Omega.
Okay first of all thank you all so much! I can't even describe how thankful I am for all the sweet comments and the many reads this story already got. To be honest I never would have imagined this...
Steve didn’t need to be told twice, swooping the Omega up in his arms and made his way to the master bedroom.
‘His Omega’, Steve smiled at the thought. It sounded so fitting, so perfect, suiting Tony just right.
Though, then suddenly a scent reached his nose and simultaneously making his insides warm up, a content feeling washed over him and forced a small purr out of his mouth, startling him in the process lightly.
Steve opened his mouth but quickly closed it again, searching for the right thing to say, something to convince the Omega to stay, to talk to Steve and hopefully accept his courtship. But he came up with nothing.
Tony shrugged leisurely and bend down to pick the garment up again, smiling challengingly at the female Alpha in front of him. “Nah it’ll do”, he added and started walking around the room again in search of a fitting pair of pants, completely ignoring the deep sigh let out by Pepper.
So when his aunt May told him, she’d be gone for two weeks, her job demanding her to go to the west coast for a few meetings, he already knew where he was going to stay. Obviously his Dad’s place, the Avengers tower.
One date and the Alpha already got to him. No, screw that, Steve has gotten to him since the day the Avengers officially moved into the tower.
Yet, his jaw was itching. Steve knew something was missing. A mating bite. A bite to finally make the Omega his forever.
With that the god backed off a few steps, catching the other Alpha’s attention once again, who abruptly let out a snarl at the sight of the retreating challenger.
“Alpha, please fuck me”, Tony whispered exhausted. He could already tell he was close with Steve stroking his dick skillfully like that. But the Omega didn’t want to come like that, no, he craved something else.
The thick omegan pheromones in the air completely drowned out the dominant Alpha scent from just a few moments ago, underlining the shift of dominance in the room, completely being in Tony’s hands now.
Slowly the man outstretched his hands and embraced the teen carefully, to which the kid did not react at first. Though as soon as Steve started purring and flooding their space with a domestic and safe scent, an action usually reserved for the pup’s parents, Peter sighed into the contact and let his hands fall down beside himself to raise his nose towards the scent.
Peter quickly let go of his mother and made his way over to his closet, on the search for something school appropriate to wear. An old science shirt of his mom would surely do, he thought excitedly.
“However the damage was done nonetheless. I had two pups who grew up without their father and Harley took it even worse, the Alpha figure in his life being ripped from him once again. Both of them are as clingy as they are because I couldn’t offer them more. offer them a real family. And as you noticed Harley still doesn’t really know how to act as an Alpha even though he’s already fourteen. And that all because of me.”
All of sudden strong arms wrapped themselves around his body, squeezing the life out of him while his face was plastered in mass of red wavy hair. The potent smell of Alpha female made itself known and Tony swiftly relaxed into the familiar hold.
His movements slightly slowed down, his forming knot at the base of his cock stopping him from his rough trusts. He didn’t want to hurt his heat mate, so he altered his trusts to slower, but still firm and prostate stimulating forces.
The other man couldn’t stop his whines and purrs, the Alpha ramming into him just like he promised at the beginning. Another slap to his ass cheek, staining the milky white flesh with a harsh red and the Omega was hard again. His short cock pulsing painfully.
The Omega was now looking over the menu once more, slowly losing his grip on the sheets and listening to the blond talk about the past. Something he Tony always enjoyed. The animated look in the man’s eyes, the contently tinted scent and the relaxed posture was a sight to behold, making Steve seemingly glow. A glow that people tried to diminish many times before and thankfully haven't succeeded yet.
Not catching the eyes of either adult the teen simply looked down at his fumbling hands and let out a breath. “He’s staying home today because he’s not feeling well.”
His pups helped with placing the dishes inside the dishwasher as well as restocking the fridge with the several foods they used for breakfast. All while Tony tried to clean the stove from Steve’s greasy bacon stains.
The grin grew wider on his face as the Omega tried to wrap his brain around his morning discovery. Oh how he wished he could take a picture of the man right now. Well, he could always ask Jarvis to do so but that would just come off as plain creepy and Tony wasn’t creepy just noisy most of the time.
But then again Harley was growing like a fucking tree these days! Quickly on the way to adulthood, sooner than Tony would have preferred and he was only fourteen! For christ’s sake the Omega had to buy his Alpha pup new pants again already, since he outgrew his last once the man bought just three months ago.
Peter’s smile fell at the reminder of his brother, who was currently sick in bed probably getting coddled by their mother. The first time he’s really gotten sick in like forever, which was just plain weird and frankly scared the young Omega in a way he hasn’t felt that many times before.
And with that Peter sat down his glass again and took the controller back into his hands, starting the game anew.
But the thought of that-that Alpha being interested in his mother and even asking him on a date just set his Alpha instincts into rage, something that rarely happened.
After a few more trusts, the Omega felt an intense, but blissful, pressure at his entrance. The Alpha’s knot was finally popping and steadily sealed Alpha and Omega together. Finalizing the breeding as cum flooded the Omega’s hole.
“He’s not my fucking Alpha”, Tony grumbled lowly at Clint’s words but continued walking closer nonetheless.
Tony laughed  with glistening eyes and pulled her from the seat, placing an arm around her waist. “Like? Fuck Pepper I look like you’re about to sell me at an auction. I love it!”
Peter winced at the fed up tone in the man’s voice, though he knew Happy actually cared for him a damn lot, the man really didn’t get paid enough for handling the two young Stark boys. Well, what could he say, he and his brother were a handful.
Pheromones thickened in the room as both men panted from the movements, moans and grunts loudly sounding off as both chased their highs.
Don’t get Tony wrong, he loved his teammates, he really did. But he also loved Steve, particularly alone time with Steve.
Steve took the smooth collar out of the box with lightly shaking hands, still thinking he should keep apologizing for the nerve he had to buy such a gift, but Tony was already presenting his neck submissively and what else was he supposed to do at such a sight? The tanned and soft skin looked so perfect, perfect to be graced by a collar, complementing his omegan nature.
The older Omega, however quickly advanced at both of his children, purring deeply before reaching out with his hands.
Suddenly, before Steve could reply, he could hear quick footsteps advancing as a person came to a stop right beside the blond Alpha. Tony’s and Steve’s heads both turned at the all familiar scent, spiked with excitement. Peter.
Finally the Alpha shook his hand one more time and nodded towards the present in his hand, expecting the Omega to take it off him. Though nothing like that happened and the genius rather took a few steps back, raising his hands as if trying to defend himself.
No, it was the fact that when he got up to go to the bathroom he ran straight into a sticky, fibery substance hanging from the ceiling. A minute of struggling to get out of it, got him stuck even more. He grumbled sleepily, while hanging in the fibers, swinging back and forth.
The continued in a lighter manner from then on, though, they kept the conversations casual, having had too much of deep and personal stories for one day. The topics again differed from their work, comments about the food, which was now rather cold but still enjoyable nonetheless, and occasionally Tony threw in some funny stories about his pups.
“Confidential, yeah, yeah nothing new there,” Tony answered with a grin, not offended in any way. It was part of their job, secrets, rules, the whole deal. “Though, given a few minutes I could find out myself. Fury honestly doesn’t have the best security system, at least not Stark proved,” he concluded mischievously.
Tony smiled into the sandy coloured hair of his eldest, enjoying every bit of their lazy morning. Breakfast
The sound of the fridge opening could be heard and Tony breathed out a sigh, getting up himself in the process and facing the guilty looking culprits once again.
Tony’s reaction was immediate as he sprung up from his chair with a smile just as Natasha was entering the lab. Without any regard the Omega ran up to her, who was already waiting with outstretched arms and embraced the smiling Omega with a direct purr, reacting to the emitting scent.
The Omega cursed inwardly, waiting on his exhausted eyes to adjust to the ungodly brightness seeping into the room and right onto the bed.
Steve’s head snapped over to the voice of his boyfriend and he gasped at the sight. The whole side of the room was covered in webs, looking right out of a horror movie, and Tony was right in the middle of it pulling at the fibers.
Steve smiled thankfully once again and promptly sat down in the small chair with a sigh as he quickly threw Peter a look that just screamed ‘you owe me after this day’. Though, his scent was content nonetheless as he relaxed into the chair and began to read through the flashcards the boy had shoved at him, to prepare for the presentation after lunch.
Of course. Tony knew it. No matter what he’ll always be just that, another desperate Omega, in the eyes of Alphas. Nothing worth more, a slut to be fucked. He wanted to cry, self conscious as ever and, sadly, a part of him shortly believed Steve might actually be interested in him. What a joke.
“Mr. Stark, care to explain your shenanigans,” the gruff voice of his history teacher reached his ears. And here we go, Peter thought bitterly.
Some time later, while all the Avengers were trying to clean the room, gathering feathers into their arms, footsteps could be heard from down the hall.
“Newsflash idiot just because you’re a Stark doesn’t mean you you’re not an Omega, a weak little shit who’s just born to be looked down at.”
However he knew what to do and promptly stood up with the pup still clinging to his front. To reach his phone with one hand the man set Peter on one hip, still keeping the contact to his scent mark and dialed Happy’s number to be picked up immediately. He had to get Peter to his mother.
Before the boy started he threw Steve one last look, a thankful expression covering his face. Not only would Peter surely get the full credit for his work but he was also not alone up front when talking to the class. The presence of the familiar men beside him, his noticeable support and the knowledge that he could always help him out if anything were to go wrong was easing the young Omega’s mind and soothing his instincts due to the presence of the Alpha.
The brown haired Omega beside Rhodey watched the unusual behaviour of the Alpha closely, whatever made the man speechless he shrugged mentally.
“Gee, your talent for compliments are astounding kid”, the mother rolled his eyes lovingly and stared at the suspiciously behaving pup once again. Something had to be wrong?
The Omega in the room furrowed his brows at the slight change of pheromones in the air. A hint of sourness slowly tainting his pup in front of him. “Pup?”, he asked worriedly.
Tony could already feel the thickening base of the godly Alpha cock and shivered in anticipation. This, this was what he was waiting for. The feeling of being filled to the brim with hot cum, hole being completely drenched, a true breeding. To fill him with another pup.
And with that the elevator doors opened again and the kid left in a flash, leaving a speechless Alpha behind, openly gaping at the space the pup stood just a few seconds ago.
God, Steve was freaking out innerly, if nothing he could still pretend it was all a joke and call the whole thing off.
Steve nodded perplexed at his Omega and complied, not wanting to feel another exasperated look from the man. Damn, this must be how the pups felt plenty of times during the day.
There was no turning back was it? Steve sighed once more and began walking alongside Peter, who was walking with his head cast downwards avoiding the many unbelievable stares of his baffled classmates.
A whine escaped the Omega, the Alpha’s mouth swallowing it up right away and pressing his tongue more forceful against the other one. Both men stood in the middle of the elevator, Steve tightly holding onto the other’s hips, Tony tracing his hands across the Alpha’s muscular chest and pheromones interwinding with each other.
Harley was slowly strolling behind his mother, avoiding the continuing worried glances the man threw at him.
Only moments later the scent of Omega slick reached his nose as a familiar, round ass was shoved into his face. And oh damn. The Omega positioned himself above the Alpha, facing his oozing cock and presenting his still clothed hole to the Alpha’s face. It was just like Steve always imagined it would be like and so much more at the same time. The scent, the thick smell of just Tony, his sweet slick, covered him seemingly and the Alpha looked on in a blissful state.
Tony shivered lightly at the feeling and even though he was consumed by heat and lust at the moment, managed to roll his eyes at the Alpha behind him. Alphas, they just loved being addressed by their hierarchy.
Though the genius had no time contemplating the adorable sight of his pup as a much deeper and loud growl reached his ears.
Like that the boy cried out a meekly ‘yes’ and quickly vanished from the Alpha’s sight when he nodded at him to go with his strong Alpha demander.
Slowly he lifted the blonds arms from his waist and put the arm back down, carefully not to wake the sleeping beauty. The man just let out a groan and rolled over. Thank god.
“Alpha!”, he screamed out when Steve began leaving small bites at his neck. So damn close to his mating mark, goddamnit.
“What are you sighing at?”The sudden deep voice ripped the Omega from his exasperation and painfully pulled him back to reality, the situation he got himself into.
With that Tony undressed in flash, pulling his expensive jacket and shirt off and throwing it somewhere in the room. His shoes were next which he just kicked off without any regard, pants following in a flash. Just like that he was left in his underwear, panting breathlessly and looking back at the now naked Alpha in front of him.
Tony grumbled but shook his head insistingly. “We have the worst team mates. Even my pups know how to help. God, I swear they’re just a bunch of children, which I apparently have to parent.”
Tony was at a loss for words and drooling at the sight in front of him. Sex with Steve Rogers? He was actually offering to sleep with Tony?
The kid smiled at the man thankfully and threw the car door open without any regard, earning him a quick ‘HEY!’ from Happy to which the teen just shrugged with a light grin, the ‘oops’ clearly written on his face.
A sad smile graced his lips as he quietly sat down at the counter, already thinking about a new idea.
The young Alpha in fact kept up his growls, though, his eyes slightly widened at the tall Alpha across from him. He knew he only had a minimal chance of setting his dominance above the older man, but he was holding on. Mostly because of his mother.
“If I didn’t want you I wouldn’t be standing here right now, presenting the makeshift gift of mine in hopes of you accepting my courtship”, Steve called out, slowly stepping closer to the trembling Omega across the room. “And god, Tony, you don’t even know how many times I’ve tried to give you a courting gift this week. But turns out you’re harder to reach than I would have thought”, Steve admitted with a light smile, scent of hope flooding the room, combining both scents once again, similar to the heat they spend together.
Tony looked up at the outburst, eyes now trained on the other man for the first time since he started talking, the dominant scent flooding his nose and making him dizzy for a split second. Alpha anger in fact.
A sharp tug at his sleeve directed his panicked gaze at the small Omega beside him who was still beaming up at him.
Naturally he would have picked something up. Ever since Peter wanted to talk to Steve his inner alarm bells have been ringing, his instincts rising at the possible reason for their conversation.
Quickly exiting the elevator the Omega took in the sight of the living room and groaned at the scene. Pillows strewn all over the place, dozen of empty candy wrappers, a spilled drink on the expensive table in front of the couch and all sorts of electronic devices messily placed in a colourful pile on the floor. The room was looking like a bomb exploded, a damn teenager bomb. During moments like these Tony sometimes, always, wished he could go back a few years when his pups were still cute and innocent, nothing like the troublemakers they’ve obviously turned into.
