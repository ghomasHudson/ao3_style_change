Every head in the room whipped up to the tv. A plane crash was on a beach. Sam winced at the sound of Bucky’s metal arm being crushed again.
The robot made another happy chirp sound and waves. Peter dropped a puzzle onto the table and instructed the robot to completely it. After a few attempts, it did. Waving its hand in joy when it finished and offering its fist for another fist bump.
We spent the night in the broom closet kissing. It was the only thing that would keep him from going out and getting his ass kicked. So he was out and I wasn’t, but we made it work. After we got out of basics they sent us to the pararescue training. The other guys had been there for weeks and were the new guys. But after a week Rylie and I were on par with the best of them. We knew everything about each other, knew how we were going to react. Wingmen they called us. The Hawk and his Falcon. There was always speculation about the two of us, but it was pretty high up in government clearance so we kept it hidden.
Loki nodded letting out another sob. Natasha took a deep breath and waited another minute before beckoning Sam over. “Sit against the wall,” she ordered in Russian.
Wanda ran in floating a large bucket of ice above her. She dumped it into the bath and Natasha wasted no time in getting Peter in. Waiting for Cho was hell because Peter’s fever would not go down. But the ice bath stabilized it. It was torture watching the happy go lucky fidgety child moan and groan from pain and dry heave. Natasha would rather stab herself than watch it.
He walked out of the room and Sam laid against his bed. It was horrible. He was a bisexual widow, one of the first guys to get married. And his best friend didn’t know. Even if as Peter claimed Steve was the bisexual to end all bisexuals. Sam knew that no one would judge. But he didn’t have the heart to tell them that he was still broken and agonizing over his love’s death.
“Hey,” Sam greeted crouching down to eye level and rubbing Loki’s forehead gently, “I’m headed out to work now,” he announced, “Natasha is here and she’s having breakfast with you before Steve and Bucky come over. I’ll be back by dinner. Try to get some more sleep, okay?”
Steve didn't sound that upset or instant, but Bucky sighed anyways. He watched Tony through his lashes like he knew how Tony was affected by the way Steve was acting. “Wait until Steve relaxes. He’s worse than I am.”
Wanda never really thought about how it would be like attending college as Wanda Maximoff not Becky from the bar down the street. This was so different. Some of the teachers made a big deal about it some didn’t. She got glares and smiles, thanks and threats. She had professors asking her to help with experiments or experiment on her. The first time the second one happened had been a mess.
“You have a room in the ranch house,” Tony answered, “but you have a house on the property. I suppose you want to be there?”
Sam laid in the room next door looking up at the couch. When F.R.I.D.A.Y alerted him to Loki walking up in a cold sweat and screams Sam ran into the room. “Loki. It’s Sam,” he yelled walking in.
Loki nodded slightly. Sam nodded back. “Overall, it seems like you are pretty comfortable with me and I’m cool with you. From a psychological standpoint, it seems like living in the Ranch House is just going to stress you out. It makes sense. There’s not enough space or privacy. Here you can have privacy.”
Clint snorted. “If you change your mind about the drink let me know, but I have to go, the masses want drinks.”
Tony shrugged. “F.R.I.D.A.Y make a compilation video for everything everyone on the Avenger's team had ever said about the accords,” he ordered.
Loki’s followed them. They arrived at a small room. A queen size bed a few dressers and a bathroom. “Well,” Tony whistled, “here's your room. You should probably shower and sleep. Dinner is at six F.R.I.D.A.Y can give you directions and she is your go-to gal if you need anything.”
Peter spun in a full circle pulling at his hair. The couple watched him for a moment waiting for Peter to calm down. When he finally stopped spinning he looked at Tony. “Is that okay?
“Bucky is trolling the internet again,” Natasha announced stretching herself further into the coach, “and now fan girls or guys, I suppose, are drawing Cap in that hoodie and lacy white underwear with the caption God Bless America.”
Loki waved her goodbye and went to see if he could find anything on cactuses in his new book collection before he tried the internet like Bucky has shown him.
When Sam arrived back at the Neighborhood from work and went into the Ranch house the next Thursday he headed to the kitchen to steal from Tony’s chocolate and coffee stash. Instead of coffee and chocolate, he found Tony and Clint yelling at Loki. Bruce was hovering in between the three men his eyes twitching hands held out towards Clint and Tony. “Hey,” Sam barked, “what are you doing?”
Sam kicked his legs out of bed. “I asked her to help me out with Lo when he arrived, and they’ve grown attached.”
“Everything has changed from when you were born,” Rhodey exclaimed, “it’s changed from when I was born.”
Sam shrugged. “They were angry over what happened with New York, but if that was not of your own free will, well perception happens to change things.”
Sam hesitated and then jogged off with a wave. Natasha dropped back against the couch with a dramatic sigh. “I should make Tony get me a fainting couch so I can collapse whenever I deal with fools.”
U spun around Steve moving his camera towards the man’s butt. Steve skittered away while Tony laughed. “That ass is a national treasure,” he exclaimed, “I wanna bite it.”
Sam let Peter have free reign on the music and didn’t even try to peg down the boy’s taste. Peter was happy with this arrangement.
Tony wasn’t sure what he was expecting for an answer, but a small laugh wasn’t one of them. “Maybe,” he agreed, “they tend to adopt me.”
It was a small metal, Falcon. “Really,” Sam complained but pocketed the little metal bird before Bucky could demand it back.
Shuri didn’t say anything for a moment before nodding. Sam flicked on the tv so Shuri would have something to watch while Steve drew. Steve loved live models, but it sucked to be one.
Wanda rolled her eyes and slipped the women her ID. The women looked at it and frowned. She looked between the pair and her frown deeper. “Jesus Christ,” Tony muttered as they sat down a minute later, “the other two colleges just gasped at us. Geez.”
Loki looked at him and nodded. Then he slinked into his room. Loki looked at all the beds he could sleep in and smiled. The options were nice. He pulled the book he had been reading earlier down and climbed into the bottom library bunk. He read until he drifted off to sleep.
Sam knew that very well. “I think she’s going to be spending more time in Washington now,” Bucky added his jaw clenching.
Natasha looked at Fury her eyebrows twitching up, but she nudged the kind of teen to stand next to Peter and Wanda. Wanda slipped her arm around Loki’s waist and drew herself in front of him. He dropped his chin down to her shoulder and Fury looked over the three of them and nodded. “Well, I’m sure between the three of you-you can get your parents into trouble.”
He didn’t feel safe. He felt like clawing off his skin. Loki climbed out of the bed and put the book he had been reading away. Then he went down the stairs. A shower should do him some good. It would relieve the ache to remove his own skin.
Loki sighed a peeled away a few pieces slowly eating them. Then he abandoned it. Loki kept reading. Then he felt his stomach turn and rushed for the bathroom. He retracted his previous meal. Loki leaned his head against the wall. Right he had to eat soups first, and he was dehydrated. The Grand Master had only allowed him to eat once a week on Saakar. Loki got to his feet and slid out of his room. He stumbled in the hall and looked for a kitchen of some sort. All the doors were closed. “Are you trying to find Tony or Mr. Wilson?” The house temptress asked.
"Speculating on your sex life. Are you the bottom or is he? I could easily see both ways. Oh! That's it isn't it! You switch!" Dean was laughing as Steve's face grew redder and redder.
"Self harm? What like if I'm gonna kill myself?" Dean laughed. "I may have a shit life but I promise you I'm not suicidal."
When the jeans were out of the way, Steve wasted no time in licking the hard outline of Tony's dick through his boxers, earning a deep and long groan from the man. Taking a second to wink playfully, the blond sucked hard at the tip through the material.
“It’s true,” the man continued. “Do you know what his therapist said before the two of you came to us?” Dean shook his head slowly. “They said apart from some abandonment issues from your father leaving, he’s a well-adjusted ten-year-old boy. Which is incredible, considering everything he’s been through, and it’s all because of you, Dean.”
The two stood in silence, both breathing a little heavier in the charged atmosphere. Loki dropped his eyes and nodded once.
"Alright. I'll be back soon." Steve stood up and kissed Dean's head. "You sure you're alright, love?" Dean nodded. "Okay. Twenty minutes, tops." He called out.
"Oh no, you take your sad eyes right out of this room, mister," Tony said sternly. "There will be no goodbyes here."
“Good. But you are wearing way too many clothes.” Becky started pushing up Deans shirt until he threw it across the room to join her jeans. He then stepped off the couch and pulled down his jeans to let them pool on the floor before letting him boxers fall to the ground.
Slowly, so Dean could follow his movements, the man rested his hand on Dean's arm. “Dean, there’s no way in hell you’re going to school, and there’s no way we’re leaving you home alone today, either. Now, get up to bed, and I’ll bring you some soup.”
"Well, I mean, kinda?" Sam responded. "But this isn't like when he was grounded, he hasn't been awful in like, two weeks! He's been annoying, and a little mean like he was with Clint, but nothing like he was before."
Exiting the car, the two did as Tony suggested and admired the handiwork that was the fixed half a million-dollar car. Dean held the keys out to Tony only to blink in surprise when the man said: “Keep it.”
"Steve. If you don't bring them in, I'll be forced to get up and do it myself." Bucky stared down his friend until the other man relented and opened the door.
“And what if I’d rather deal with him for the rest of my life instead of destroying this ring?” Loki snapped, the haze in his eyes replaced with anger. “I’ve lasted this long, what’s the harm?”
Nodding seriously, Steve replied, "Pudding it is," then returned to the conversation as if nothing had happened.
Why did Dean have to interrupt them in bed? If he had just done it after dinner they wouldn't be coming down right now. The beating was always less right after dinner, they were too full to have any actual energy. And now-
They didn't need words as they stood there holding each other, from time to time one would turn their head and press a kiss to wherever they could reach, but for the most part, they simply enjoyed the feel of each other's arms.
Steve instantly missed the physical contact–the sharp sting of its loss made him yearn to regain the sense of intimacy.
"It feels good to be wanted, to be pulled closer instead of pushed away. It's–it's an experience that
"But that's different! Sex isn't like drug or alcohol, they can't poison me!" Dean defended. Tony squeezed Dean's hand and sighed.
"With your past, that's a very valid concern for you to have. However, when you're looking into the future, can you tell me a situation in which you would
“I was being funny!” Tony defended. “It’s the same order!” he continued, receiving a glare from both husband and son.
"He is, actually. I didn't want him to just come in, in case you were having a bad day or something."
Tony laved his tongue on the nipple, circling and lapping, occasionally drawing a yerk and a moan as he bit down. The process repeated when he moved to the other side, paying just as much attention to the other nipple as he did the first. By the time he sat up, mouth glistening with saliva, Steve had his head thrown back in abandon, eyes squeezed shut and breath coming out in shaky pants.
"Well, yeah!" Dean shouted. "It's my fault! If I were a better hunter, dad would've brought me with him and he would've had back up! If I wasn't so useless he wouldn't have left for so long in the first place! He wouldn't have felt the need to get away from us all the time! He– It's all my fault!"
Once again, this chapter has NOT been edited by anyone other than me! On a completely related note, a huge HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my beta morrismsteph!!!!
"Þú þarft ekki að segja neitt, því ég veit að þú ættir að hata mig en þú ert bara of góð manneskja og-" {
Dean nodded and went to his backpack to retrieve one, while the man pulled an old receipt from his pocket.
"In that case," the blond pulled back to rest his forehead against Tony's. "I'm gonna make you feel me until I come back. It'll be like I never left."
Groaning, Steve dropped his head to his husband's chest. "No. We're gonna call Mr. Singer before we do anything and you manage to talk me out of it.
Again, so sorry for the unexpected hiatus.....turns out going back to work after a pandemic is going to keep you busy...who knew, right?
"Steve. We'd be putting people in this house at risk. I know you have a bleeding heart, but love," Tony reached out to his husband. "Do you really think this is the best idea? What about Nat? How do you think she's gonna feel about more men in the house? She just starting to be comfortable talking again and this could set her back. Or Clint! He was abused too and with Deans track record who knows how he'll react."
The room remained quiet while Dean turned off the light and got underneath his covers, facing away from the other boy that continued to watch him in silence.
Dean was struggling to keep his eyes open, so, eager to let them slide shut and sink into oblivion, he nodded and buried himself in his blankets, listening as Tony quietly cleaned up his sick.
Steve’s face broke out into a smile. “So much happier. And his history teacher said he even stopped ‘making a ruckus’ the last few days!”
“I always wanted to go to a normal Christmas church service,” the boy replied hesitantly, gaging the teen’s reaction.
"Only if I don't get to commend you for that," Colonel Rhodes responded, leaning back in his chair. "Tony's gonna love this."
The soldier chuckled and waved off Steve's embarrassed apology. "It's okay kid, I guess lots of people are gonna be asking from now on. It got sick, and the doctors had to take it off before the rest of me got sick too."
Today's update was originally two chapters, but seeing how short each section was....enjoy the short scenes in a normal sized chapter lol
"Look. You clearly know we're upset." Steve started as he sat beside Dean. "But why don't you tell us what was going through your head?"
Tony, watching Dean’s stiff posture and eyes still trained on the ground. He wasn’t at ease just yet. “And who was it that called you about the funeral, Mr. Singer?”
“If you’re telling the truth, your fever won’t improve. If you’re lying, we should see the fever lessen the longer you detox,” Tony summarized curtly. His tone made it clear which of the two he thought more likely.
With a frustrated look, Steve sighed. "I'm really sorry I can't talk long, but I really miss each and every one of you and I love you all so much!" Steve blew a kiss into the camera, smiling when Clint and Sam returned the gesture.
Nat was too tired to argue. It wasn't like she couldn't find something else to bring back the colour and the numb.
Dean didn’t have to wait for long. A knock interrupted the teen’s thoughts, and Mr. Wilson popped his head through the doorway, his tired smile masking an exhausted man. “Hey, Dean.”
"Be careful, Tony, they're really strong," Dean warned. He didn't want Tony to accidentally get addicted again. That wouldn't be fun.
"Natasha, sister, you need to breathe!" Thor coached his younger sister as she brutally attacked a punching bag in the gym.
The men smiled at Sam. "That's awesome buddy." Steve told him. "I'm sure he'll really appreciate that."
Also, just a heads up that I'm going on vacation next week so there will be a brief hiatus before the next chapter!!
The entire table went quiet as they whipped their heads to look at Dean. Apparently they were all in consensus that a ten year old didn't need to know how to swear.
He was still waiting for the other shoe to drop, but man the wait was sweet! He had a cell phone, two private pools, a gaming system, three meals a day and the heat hadn't gone out once. Hell, if Steve and Tony did start hitting him soon he wouldn't even mind.
“You’ve been at war ever since you were four years old.” That shut Dean up. He looked at his therapist with wide eyes.
"You betcha!" Tony answered, strutting in through the doorway. "I gotta say, the build-up after two and a half months of not—"
Steve smiled at their girl, reaching across the desk to squeeze her hand before returning it to the armrest of his chair. "Bruce?" he called out.
"I want you to know that I'm not gonna hurt you," Dean spoke in a low and calm voice, "I'm not letting go right now because I know that when I do you're going to run and you'll never want to talk about this again."
"Oh yeah? What does he say?" Tony responded, pulling his pyjama shirt over his head and watching his husband lean against the doorway of their ensuite.
"Of course I do, buddy!" Dean quickly reassured the boy, placing his hands on his little brother's shoulders. "I'm not going anywhere. I just–I don't know if I'm ready to let go of my dad just yet," he admitted for the first time.
Dean shook his head adamantly and resumed his breakfast. “No, he knows I get into a lot of fights. He’s seen me scratched and bruised before.”
"John Winchester knew what he was going into when he decided to join the hunting community and he was well aware of the risks he took. He was coming back from a hunt when he heard the possibility of a supernatural being in Jersey City. He was woefully unprepared and didn't tell anyone where he was going. You couldn't have helped him kill those werewolves, Dean. You were miles away and looking after Sam with no means of transportation." The man stopped when he saw Dean drop his gaze to his lap. Placing a finger under the teen's chin, Mr. Coulson lifted Dean's head until he was once more looking at the man.
"Dude, why are you-" the blond sighed and ran his hand through his hair. "You know what? Yeah. Yeah, I would, because even though you can still be a jerk sometimes, you're my brother. End of story."
"No, I barely had time to pry the little munchkin's phone out of his hand before he betrayed me and called you."
"Really, Steve? The man who abandoned the kids that called him 'Uncle'? The man that never went five minutes without a beer in his hand at the funeral? The man that probably gave Dean codeine? The man that's in a frickin' biker gang?!"
"Shhh, Mommy is getting her medicine, Clint. You have to wait." Natasha huffed and shoved a toy block in his face.
“Dean! How are you feeling sweetheart?” Steve stood and embraced the teen, not deterred at all when Dean stiffened before melting into the hug.
The teen huffed and flopped backwards onto the mattress, stifling a whimper at the subsequent pain in his head and side.
Dean fought the urge to throw up again as he sipped the water. “Like sunshine and rainbows. How do ya think I’m doin’?” he spat at the engineer. “I just love puking my guts out, don’t you?”
The teen stiffened but nodded slowly. The hug wasn't nearly as warm as the other kids' and Steve mourned the opportunity to grow their relationship, instead of putting it on hold.
Searching Steve's eyes, the engineer smiled. "You want us to go slow, hun? Want me to take my time?" The man's once wandering hands softened, and made their way to rest on top of Steve's chest.
“Seriously? You believe in some mystical being in the sky that’s supposed to be in charge of our entire lives?” Dean’s voice rose without his permission, betrayed in the knowledge that there was something about his brother that he didn’t know.
"No. No, I haven't heard from him or about him for a couple of years now." The man sounded tired–not as rough and gruff as Dean remembered.
"Okay. We're gonna try this again. What the fuck was that about?" Tony asked. Dean shrugged. "Nuh uh. You're not getting shy on us now. You owe us an explanation."
Steve laughed, which quickly gave way to sobs, the high emotions of the past few days catching up to him.
A single tear traced itself down Dean's face, revealing how much the teen needed to hear the affirmation. Quickly wiping it off, he smiled at Sam. "I know. Now go back to bed, bitch. I don't want to hear you complain about you not getting enough beauty sleep tomorrow morning."
"Alright, alright," the blond laughed, and with a slicked-up finger, began circling his husband's hole, kissing his neck all the while.
Tony calmly walked towards the veteran and took the offered hand. "Anthony Edward Stark, of Manhattan and this studmuffin's husband."
“I care because you’re family, you idiot,” he responded, none too kindly. “Whether you like it or not, you’re stuck with us, and I’m not letting you get hurt when I could put a stop to it in less than a minute. Now, let’s go burn that fucking necklace and make you fucking safe.”
TW for this chapter: discussion of past child abuse (but tbh, that's why you're here, isn't it? LOL)
"I talked to Dr. Mills a lot about telling you. We worked out why I didn't want to tell you in the first place and she told me you were going to find out eventually, so why not just get it over with?" Sam returned his gaze to the ceiling.
"He asked you to spank him. This could be his way of getting us to hit him. Make you angry enough, put the idea in your head, and…" The engineer trailed off.
"Fuckin prude. You'd think with a body like that he'd just never wear clothes so anyone could just use him whenever they wanted." Dean spat.
Also, a very big thank you and a huge welcome to my wonderful and amazing new beta for this series: Apollos_Meatballs!!!
"We don't start with punishment, kiddo," Tony sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "We start with what you did to land you in a talk."
"Why do you think I'm the one that opened the door every time you 'couldn't find your other shoe'?" Sam asked, rhetorically. "I have an idea about what you went through, but I don't know what it feels like. And that, to me, is a win, Dean. You're the reason my nightmares are not being able to save you, instead of being the one lying in my own blood.
She listened to the doctor explain why 'biting is never the answer, Natasha'. Scoffing, the girl had to disagree. She escaped the mean man, right?
Once he saw Steve drive off to NYU with Bruce and Thor, Dean pulled out his phone and called a cab. Thank god for the allowance money Steve and Tony gave him every week. With the amount he'd saved up, Dean had more than enough to get to New Jersey and back.
Fighting a scoff, Dean quipped: “I never thought I’d see the day, his highness prince Loki, sitting on the floor.”
"Please let me come in now, Steve. That was perfect and I need to meet this guy right now," Tony's muffled voice called out.
Bucky smiled at the excited kid. "Well let me know when you do, we can talk fantasy," he winked and moved on to look at Dean.
Dean quickly blocked him, forcing the door open and grabbing the other boy’s arm. “Hey,” he warned, “don’t do this. Don’t shut me out again.”
Continuing to be gentle with the other teen’s prized possession, he placed the ring in the middle of the logs and began covering it in salt, so much salt it was impossible to see the gold underneath. As Dean was about to light the match and set it ablaze, Loki reached out and gently touched his adoptive brother’s arm.
Sam sighed heavily. “I always thought there was a chance Dad would show up, you know? Even if he left that morning for a hunt I thought ‘maybe this year he’ll come back in time’. Stupid, huh? Now- now there’s no chance of him coming,” he whispered.
Dean raised his brows in a silent question. "Me? Pfft. I have a lot to say on the matter, but nothing's gonna change your mind so why bother."
Dean snapped his eyes up to the lady. A Dr. Mills. Tony said she was recommended for him and Sam by-
“Dude,” Dean dropped his head to try and catch the eye of the other teen. “You’re always gonna know how much your mom loved you, with or without a ring.”
Steve could hear the pout coming from the almost teenager. "Mmmhmm. And why did he take your phone away, honey?" The man was happy that the boy couldn't see his smiling face, for all the mischief Clint managed to get himself into, his hijinks never failed to make the army captain smile.
"If I weren't an alcoholic and you weren't a minor I'd be offering you some liquor right about now."
Dean nodded. "I realized that you were right. I love him, I'll always love him, but he wasn't the best dad. Steve and Tony are— they're just—" he trailed off, struggling to find the words.
Clint was looking between his sister and the woman, confused. "'Tasha? Why are you not talking to the nice lady?" The girl simply shook her head at the boy and continued walking. They didn't have time for this, they were
Dean didn't sleep that night. He sat with his back on their door, standing guard for Sammy. When he felt sure that everyone in the house was asleep, he went to work.
The teen threw both his caution and his hands into the air as he started shouting, "Are you ready to go there? Do you really want to know everything that I keep from you? Do you wanna know about how I refused to cry when mom died because every time you saw me crying, you'd start too? Or how about the fact that the
Steve laughed and buried his face in his husband's neck. "I see how this is going, eh? I do all the work and you get to sit back and relax."
"I know your history." The man began, not even bothering to keep looking at the teen. "I know you stayed with some real monsters in the past." At this he pointedly looked at Dean before continuing to roam his eyes around the room. Dean's breath stopped. Monsters? He knew about the supernatural?
“Thanks, Sam.” Dean finally began struggling to push himself further up the bed, then leaned back against the headboard. “Pass it here.”
"Natasha, sweetheart, I need you to open the door again, please," Tony knocked again, a slight edge to his voice that wasn't there before. She looked down and almost groaned when she realized that the blood had soaked through her shirt sleeve.
Smiling at his husband's antics, Steve climbed into their bed to lay next to the genius. "Your logic is flawed."
Dean was in so much agony that through his tears, he never noticed Steve's soft words in his ear or the man's delicate fingers carding through his hair, easing him into slumber.
"Oh, come on. What did they do? Or were you just feeling extra dickish? That's cool too, those guys kinda suck on a good day."
“Dean, what’s the matter with you?” Sam demanded, confused as to why his brother was treating their favourite uncle as a pariah.
The younger boy stared intently at the teen, knowing that he could spot any lie his brother gave. Finally, Sam smiled. "Then yeah. I think I am gonna let them adopt me."
"Can you even try to eat like a human being?" Natasha looked at him in disgust, daintily holding her plate further away from him. Clint's reply was to simply lean towards her and, with a mouthful of food, say 'Ahhhhhh' to let her see all of the partly chewed food.
Steve and Tony looked at each other and collectively took a bracing breath. Tony stood and moved to sit on the couch on the other side of Dean.
“I-” the soldier stopped to take another breath. “I think being back overseas in the base, and-and just...being
Leaving the broken man behind him, Dean ran up the stairs, once again taking a measured breath before entering his and Sam's room.
A couple hours later, the boys woke to a knock on their door and Tony telling them that French toast was waiting for them in the kitchen.
Dean scoffed as he stared out the window. "And that's why you probably never got laid. You're lucky you're hot otherwise you would've had trouble getting Tony willing to bone. He probably only saw your fine ass when you walked up to him anyways."
Dean picked out the specific traumas that most likely happened to each kid. Sam just took the information in stride, not bothering to wonder where the behavior could've come from.
“Since when do you care about religion, Sammy?” Dean wondered. “What, are you gonna start praying every day?” he scoffed again, checking his own tie.
"Ugh feels so good to double team with you again, love," Tony sighed, before making a kiss sound into the phone and passing it to the boy.
Dean sighed loudly as he resigned himself to the fact that he was not going to be able to sleep in today and mumbled, “Breakfast.”
Dean sighed and walked over to his brother, placing his hands on the boy’s shoulders. “Hey, I’m sorry I ruined the mood. Let’s take a page out of Steve and Tony’s book and just not care about what anyone else believes in, yeah?”
“He was my protégé, Dean. I tell him to trust me, and he will.” Mr. Coulson smirked; the look spoke of untold memories shared between the two colleagues.
“He’s… as well as can be imagined,” Steve replied hesitantly. The POW in question still refused to wake up for any longer than a couple of minutes, and most of those times he still believed he was back at the prison camp.
"Without question." The father continued, reaching up with his other hand to gently card through Loki's dark hair. "I love you so much that when I think about anything happening to you, my chest physically aches."
Even Bobby didn't want him. His dad abandoned him, all of his foster parents hated the sight of him, and now even their Uncle Bobby didn't want him.
"Oh, love," Steve sighed. "I need you to know that you weren't bad, you just made a mistake. That's why Dad took away your phone, to help remind you to correct those mistakes in the future. We love you so much, sweetheart and we want you to be the best person you can be."
This chapter hasn't been looked over by my lovely beta yet (I may just have finished it a couple of hours ago, whoops) so it may change slightly in the coming week.
Dean snapped his eyes towards the pair on the love seat. The boy didn't look much older than Sam and he was not letting any kid get hurt, no matter how they behaved. Dean saw Steve's eyebrows raise in surprise.
“Look at you, being all responsible,” Clint chimed in. “Obviously, he didn’t see you on your twenty-first birthday, breaking beer mugs and shouting, ‘Another!’ until Papa had to carry you to bed,” the newly thirteen-year-old teased.
"Really? You would teach me things you're learning in university?!" He gaped at the older boy. Bruce chuckled at Sam's enthusiasm.
Steve raised an eyebrow at his husband, receiving a "we'll talk later" look from the man before he thanked Dean genuinely.
Steve sighed and fell into a chair opposite his husband. "He's been waiting for us to hit him. Hasn't he? This entire time."
"Ugh. K. This is how this is gonna go." Dean sat up straight again, placing his hands on his knees. The couple instinctively moved back, giving him space. "I don't trust you. At all. But if what your saying is true then it could be really good for Sammy. I'll let you do what you do, but if I think you're gonna touch him in any way, you're both in shit. And I mean it," Dean pointed at the men, glaring at them dangerously. "You touch a hair on his head I'll be burying you in an unmarked grave, then Sam and I are gone. I don't know if they told you, but our dad is coming back for us. The moment he does we're leaving, no if's, ands or but's. Agreed?"
Tony finally tugged down the man's briefs, silently asking him to step out before he stood straight once more and cupped the tear-stained face in his hands. "There's my beautiful husband," he smiled.
little frame to sleep off the liquor!” the man boomed with laughter, taking his place back in front of the sink. Thor laughed even harder when Clint stuck out his tongue, only to get splashed with dirty dishwater. Freaking out, the boy scrambled to rinsed his mouth with water straight from the tap, grumbling about his ‘huge jerk of a thunder god brother’ the entire time.
Tony hugged his husband in return. "I get it. We've been through a lot, we can work through this. But Steve." Tony pushed himself out of Steve's arms. "What if we screw it up? What if we scar them for life?"
"It's okay, Papa!" Sam brought the man in for another hug. "Dean already made them! Dean's been making our lunches for almost all the time you've been gone!"
“I do pray. Every day. I have for a long time.” Sam answered, looking at his brother straight in the eye.
sex life, too!" Although her voice was disgusted, a small smile crept onto her face at the man's antics.
"How are you faring, young scholar?" Thor asked, resting a hand on the boy's shoulder. "With the demise of your father."
“It’s not just Christmas things!” Sam shouted again, only to be reminded by Steve to use his inside voice. “Sorry, but Dean, come here! Have you ever seen a menorah? It’s so cool! Oh! And Thor just showed me his Yule Log!”
The next few days proved exceedingly busy, filled with recitals, football games and parent-teacher meetings, but Steve and Tony managed to keep an eye out for any behavioral changes in Dean. They were not disappointed.
Dean looked at the other man now. The 'Mr. Coulson' that was the reason they were here. Dean didn't trust him yet. The man nodded to Dean before sitting in the desk chair a few feet away.
Clint had done his job and he, as well as Thor, Bruce and Natasha were milling in their father's office when they arrived.
Dropping a quick kiss to Sam's head, Steve headed to talk to Dean and leave the rest of the family to congratulate and welcome their newest member.
"We figured you would want to share a room for now. If at any time you want your own rooms just let us know and we'll fix something up, we have more than enough rooms." Steve told Dean. "Sam can you look at me please?" he called out to the boy. He made sure both boys were paying attention before speaking. "This is your room. No one else in allowed in your room at any time except for you. The only exception to this rule is when you're sick and need to be taken care of, or if we feel someone is in danger. Other than that, everyone in this house will get express permission before walking through this doorway. Understand?" Sam nodded and returned his attention to the computer. Dean eyed Steve, scanning him for something, before nodding slowly.
"Steve?" a groggy voice came from the speaker. The screen was still dark, although Steve could see shapes moving vaguely.
"Yeah! And dad kept it!" Sam was smiling ear to ear as he stared at that trophy, no doubt remembering the day he'd gotten it.
“Oh, hun,” Tony sighed when he saw the captain. The man’s hair was wild with all the times he’d run his hands through them and his eyes puffy from the tears he kept trying to keep down but failed. “Darling, I think maybe it’s time to come home for today.”
"Yeah I'll take a look at what they have. I wouldn't mind reading more books!" Sam looked excited at the prospect.
By the time Sam had told Tony about Dean taking the painkillers because of an injury, and Tony had run through the huge house to tell Steve, Dean was having a hard time staying conscious.
Sam stood silently a moment more. “So, why are you coming to church with us?” he asked quietly, ignoring the teen’s warning.
"Alright Dean," a man opened the door, looking intently at a file as he made his way to a cluttered desk Dean was currently resting his feet on. "My name is Sam Wilson and I'll be your caseworker!" The man looked up from the papers as he sat down, extending his hand towards the teenager.
"I would never!" Dean interrupted. He was now standing in the doorway, the need to defend himself greater than his fear of the redhead. "You have to believe me, Steve, I would never! She wanted it! I–"
"Oh, sweetheart," the genius leaned back down and began to devour his husband's mouth. "I'll always give you what you need," he whispered, before moving further down and sucking a nipple into his mouth.
"Okay, Dean. I'm putting this bucket next to your bed; if you feel the need to puke, just lean over and have at 'er. I'm also putting a bottle of water on the nightstand. Do
“There was nothing protecting her. There's no higher power, there's no God. I mean, there's just chaos, and violence, and random unpredictable evil that ... that comes out of nowhere and rips you to shreds. You want me to believe in this stuff? I'm going to need to see some hard proof. You got any?” he searched Sam’s face, daring the boy to contradict him.
Despite Tony's jest, (and multiple offers of road head,) the couple made their way directly home from the landing strip.
"I'm not sure yet, Sammy," he answered truthfully. "But if we ever have a fight like the other night, and I tell you that you need to back off, you need to back off. Okay?"
Tony slammed the door and walked around the car to get in on the driver's side. After putting on his seatbelt, Tony glanced at Dean and saw that the boy was having trouble with his own.
Dean turned to his hosts. "Thank you." His smile was tight, as though forced, where as Sam was gleaming ear to ear.
Surprisingly, Steve chuckled. “It’s a little more complicated than that Sam, but yeah. I just ignore that part.”
With one final brush against his prostate and the friction of their stomachs against his cock, Steve buried his face and bit Tony's neck to stifle the scream of his orgasm. Tony threw his head back in a mixture of pain and pleasure and continued pounding into the man, following his husband in completion not long after.
Just when Dean was going to give up and go back to bed, Loki spoke. “It was never meant to be my fathers,” he muttered. “This belonged to my mother’s father, she had emeralds added to give to me on my sixteenth birthday.”
Dean chanted in his head as he turned up the volume on the new headphones he’d gotten for Christmas. Apparently, Dean was terrified of flying, not that he’d had the opportunity to find out sooner, but here they were, Sam, Steve, Tony and him on a plane.
Steve was the only one who actually sat in the offered chairs. Tony was pacing and talking to the kids that they had hastily left back home.
Loki thought as he gathered all the clothing into the garbage can and left the door swinging behind him.
A muffled response came from behind Tony's hands. "Fuck if I know Steve. I am definitely not the expert in this area." Steve handed Tony his robe which the other man swatted away. "With Nat she just didn't talk to us, Dean just straight up offered to be a punching bag! I mean-"
“Nice try, mister. Good luck on your math quiz today,” Tony chuckled as he ruffled Clint’s hair. “I’ll stay home with him this morning. I’ve got some meetings this afternoon, but I don’t want to go to them anyway…”
Selective mutism caused by trauma was the official diagnosis. Natasha didn't care. She and Clint developed their own language and really, why would she want to talk to anyone else? Other people hurt her.
Dean trudged down the stairs to be greeted by the sight of Steve and Tony waiting for him at the breakfast table.
"But I don't want to!" Tony whined again. "I wanna have sweaty, athletic sex with my hunk of a husband and not invite a potential lunatic into our lives!"
"Clinton, if I hear you click your pen one more time, I will break it," he whispered loudly at the boy he shared the table at the library with.
"I think you have everything you need now. I really shouldn't be leaving you alone, but I still have the codeine in my pocket, and it's getting really hard not to take it myself. I'm going to go in the hall and call my sponsor really quick. If you need me, you just need to call for me, and I'll be here in a second.
Dean looked at the men with wide, innocent, and unbelieving eyes and squeezed Steve’s hand tightly, before shaking his head and clearing his throat. “Um, thanks. I–I’m still sorry,” he said, somewhat awkwardly into his empty plate, taking his hand away from Steve.
Dean paused and thought for a moment. “Well, Mr. Wilson, but I’m not letting him near me right now,” he admitted.
"We have much work to do if the team is to reach regionals, however I am confident we shall do our best!" The man puffed out his chest with pride. "Although," he paused. "Something odd happened today that I feel I need to seek council for."
"Despite my best efforts." Steve rolled his eyes. "But okay. Have you noticed how Deans always moving? Shaking his leg or playing with something in his hands?"
Tony looked to Steve then, breaking 'character' and said "we're definitely coming back to that later. But for now," he settled in again, staring at Dean unwavering once again. "Bet you never had supermodel cunt before. And you haven't lived until you've gotten a rim job."
“You sure?” the man’s brows furled in concern, noticing the way the teen’s mind seemed far away. “I can’t help if you don’t tell me what’s wrong.”
"Yeah, yeah," the blond assured him. "I just, uh, he had to go in for surgery last night." Steve took a shaky breath. "They had to remove his arm to save his life."
The girl sat with her head between her knees and listened to Tony guide her through deep breathing in a chair across the room. Gaining control once more, Natasha lifted her head to look at the man and realized he was trying to hide tears as he gave her a slight smile.
“Really? Caesar? No?” Tony searched his son’s face for any sign of recollection, then slumped on top of Steve, draping himself across his husband’s lap. “Sigh.”
Knowing when to pick his battles, Steve sighed. “I wish you could see what we do. From where I stand, I couldn't ask for a better version of you.”
"Oh good, you're here! Start stretching with me." Steve beckoned for the boy to come closer to him on the mats.
Loki sat, just staring at the ring for another minute or two, then took a big breath and nodded, but made no move to put the ring on the logs.
"Your father didn't bring you on hunts because he knew it was too dangerous to bring a thirteen-year-old. It doesn't matter how skilled you are Dean, you should never have been put in that dangerous a situation and your dad was right to leave you behind."
” Steve’s Captain voice made another appearance, silencing the room once more. “We are not accusing Dean of having a drug problem!”
Also: Disclaimer that I know nothing about the American adoption process, everything I know is based on books and movies :)
Steve smiled and kissed the man's hip bone before sucking his husband's dick down until it bumped his throat. Concentrating, he took a deep breath and swallowed the head into his throat.
"You can put them all in the main living room if you want. Then once everything is inside you can look through everything." Tony suggested, taking one of the heavier boxes from Sam and helping him set it on the coffee table.
The boxers were already wet with precum, Steve sucked at the material until it was so wet with spit it clung to every ridge beneath it. Only then did he reach up and rip the material down at the seams, leaving scraps behind as the cock jumped up in enthusiasm.
“Which, coincidently was a year and a day after his first proposal.” Steve smiled lovingly at his husband while Tony in return took hold of one Steve’s hands and kissed his knuckles softly.
"Fine! Fine, we'll call the fucking gang member and invite him into our home to corrupt our children and turn them all to drug addicts." Tony ignored the eye-roll the blonde gave him in preference to pout spread eagle on his king-sized bed with his gorgeous husband hovering above him. Realizing their position, the engineer smirked and ran a hand underneath Steve's shirt to cup the soldier's perfect pecs. "You know, since I was such a good boy–"
After the last fateful therapy session, Phil Coulson reached out to the couple and told them he knew of someone that could replace her. He guaranteed that whoever they were would be able to stand Dean’s… eccentric therapy habits.
Abandoning her ass for the moment, Dean worked on lifting the girls incredibly tight shirt. The moment her flesh was in view Dean started kissing and biting her stomach, even going far enough to tongue the inside of her belly button as he gazed at her through his eyelashes.
Tony let Steve do as he pleased, lowering his own walls and just letting Steve to hold him and kiss him, clearly in not so friendly a fashion any more, his own hands wrapped around the man’s waist as he kissed him, tongue so warm in his mouth.
Steve looked at him and then at their apparent enemies, sighing and lowering his guns. He was hired to protect Tony, even if that meant not engaging in a fight that would cost them way too much. He only hoped that this mysterious woman liked Tony enough to let him live.
“I just, I don’t know, it really means a lot that you think that what I do is admirable,” Ton said, shrugging his shoulders. “I try, you know.”
“Is that right?” Tony huffed, and he shook his head. “Clearly those people need to see the real monsters out there. And do you agree with their characterization?”
“Run the tests, keep me updated”, Steve finally decided, but before he could even leave the room, a voice was heard coming from the panel that Reed was staring at.
It wasn’t until Bruce started to talk, getting even angrier, only interrupted by Fury’s warning to leave Loki’s sceptre down. They were all silent for a moment, confused, and the loud explosion threw everybody on the ground.
“I’m glad about that,” Tony nodded, not really knowing what to say. “It’s nice to see that my influential skills are growing.” This was Steve’s territory and, without wanting to admit it, Tony felt strange to be in the very same city he'd sworn to burn down before.
“We’re not soldiers, Rogers! I’m not one of Fury’s soldiers, I refuse to be called that!”, Tony snapped all of the sudden, furious with the thought that someone would even consider him being that. He didn’t like loosing his temper, in fact he hated it, and he was pretty sure Steve noticed that, as he wasn’t looking at him with the same look as before, was it concern this time? “We’ll take Loki on, and I know exactly what he has in mind”
“Password..”, he muttered, looking around for any clues as to what this could be, but came up with nothing. He didn’t know Tony, so he knew nothing about him and what his password could be. The only thing he did know was his father, since the two of them shared a connection due to Howard Stark’s relation to the project that birthed Steve. Still, it wasn’t enough, he needed more info on the man if he was to use his technology to try and find out more about this century. Yes, he was offered help, but he would rather not share some things with a complete stranger.
Steve’s eyebrow raised as the suit began to speak, it definitely sounded as though it was coming from the audio processing unit of the suit, which was probably all automated knowing Tony. So that was his suit, his new suit that Tony was eager for him to see. He nodded and trailed his finger lightly but cautiously over the delicate fingers, examining each bend in the metal.
“No… not really, until the next time he figures out how to get here… Tony… you’re… fading away…”, Steve gasped, trying to hold on the man’s arms.
With the corner of his eye, he noticed a figure walking slowly in the distance. His shield was on his hand, ready to strike if that turned out to be Kang again or some of his low class goons. And yet, as the figure started to approach him, the possibilities of it being hostile were dropped down to zero. His lips were apart, his eyes were warm and his heart was beating so fast that he could have sworn that it could jump out of his chest any moment now.
“I can see why your people think of me more as a demon than a human,” Tony nodded, less annoyed now and more trying to understand, to learn. “But I can’t let go of something that easily, I have a name to preserve, responsibilities. And if I’m bound to be a demon for eternity, well…”
“He has his contacts...”, the driver said cryptically, waiting by the door as he left the apartment keys by it.
Steve obeyed, biting on the crust and closing his eyes; the last few days have been overwhelming, to say the least.
“All he’s been talking about since yesterday and this morning was you. About the project, I mean. I see that it went absolutely fantastic, they seem to be working perfectly”, she pointed out, looking at his legs as well as they stepped inside a glass elevator.
“No, no.. not again..”, he said as he squirmed, noticing that he was hand cuffed on a pillar on top of the- how the heck was he even on top of his own Tower?!
Steve held his breath as he gestured to Reed to shut down the communicator, to which Tony responded by slamming his fist against the glass again.
“Are you hurt? Did he do anything to you?”, he asked with visible concern, sighing in relief when Tony shook his head.
“I didn’t think you believed in that love-dovey stuff-”, Tony started to protest, but Steve was gone already, returning shortly after with a light coloured padlock on his hand. He turned his back at him, taking out a couple of markers from his bag and started to draw something. Tony was the one who insisted for him to carry those around, in case he wanted to practice his drawing inspired by the scenery.
He was however surprised to see that the man wasn’t kneeling on the snow because the darts hit him; he was in shock, and it was actually painful to see. With careful steps, Tony walked past the soldiers and knelt down with him.
It was Steve’s turn to blush faintly, rubbing the back of his head. He didn’t expect to get a confirmation straight away, but the fact that Tony seemed to be feeling the same way was simply astonishing. “I.. uh.. I really..”, he stuttered as he leaned closer to the older man, keeping his eyes fixed on him.
Steve shifted uncomfortably at being called ‘ageless.’ He didn’t often reveal that he couldn’t age, especially to others, and he had known that his story was being spread around Greece.
“I'm not letting you die, dammit!”, Steve snapped, breathing out heavily. “You don’t get it, you don’t get this at all! If you die, everyone else dies with you!”
“I’m following the orders that were given to me. Have a good night, Mr. Stark”, the sheriff replied and turned around, putting on his gloves and leaving the building.
“It was... amazing,” Steve said eagerly, kissing down Tony’s neck to his chest, nuzzling the medallion softly.
He placed his lips on the man’s soft cheek to press a light kiss there. And then he pulled back quickly, watching Steve’s reaction with his heart racing.
His hand drifted over along the work surface, looking over at a spanner and picking it up, pouting a little as he looked at it, inspecting it curiously and then going over to some schematics. His eyes began to scan them, trying to make sense, but they were far too clustered with mathematical equations, in fact to him they didn’t even look English.
The handshake was firm, and as soon as the door was shut, Steve closed his eyes and laid back on his chair.
“Cap…?”, Tony called, holding back from shooting the super villain right into the centre of the hole. “Now..?”.
That’s how I learnt how to make good weapons; from the best. It’s a medallion. It protects me from basically... Well, everything”,
Their arrival at the airport was long and tedious, despite the fact that Tony had used his own private plane.
“This isn’t just for the show, you know”, Tony replied as he pointed at his reactor. “It’s filled with energy, which is exactly what we need right now”. He took one of the wires and fidgeted with his back turned against Steve for a moment, the projected starting to produce a noise. “Aha! I knew it would work!”, he exclaimed, taking the film reel and carefully putting it inside the machine, the cloth opposite them starting to show blurry images in black and white. “Come on..”, he muttered as he adjusted himself, finally able to see what was on the cloth; Captain America standing on top of the barracks, giving an inspiration speech to his troops.
Tony was behind him, being unusually silent, but even him knew all about the sanctity of silence in moments like those. He watched the Captain walking slowly towards the large closet, holding the handles for a moment before opening it. He couldn’t see properly what was inside, but he didn’t want to intrude and disrupt Steve when he was clearly having a strong emotional moment. However, he was there for him, Steve knew that.
Tony’s hand hesitantly moved closer, eventually patting softly Steve’s palm. Steve smiled at that sight, and gently closed his hand around Tony’s.
“Then you won’t accept me into your city, behind your walls?” Tony asked again. “Not even when I’m coming in peace, wanting to save your people as much as you do?”
Among the many ancient cities in Greece, there were two empires that rivalled one another due to the many social and cultural differences they had. The first was Athens, the largest city in Greece, ruled by the goddess Athena, city of wisdom and justice where the priorities were education and law. It was one of the most respected cities and one of the most beautiful, with its many architectural wonders that often astounded outsiders and visitors to the city.
Tony wanted to hear it; he just needed to hear something hopeful for once, to have someone to reassure him that he was not beyond saving. And Steve was there all of the sudden.
“Shut your mouth!”, Steve yelled, feeling his fingernails digging into his skin, clenching his fists so hard, even through the red, thick gloves.
“Uh...ta-da?”, Tony attempted to say, waving his hands in a show-offish manner. “Surprise, it’s me? And it has been me all along, not a bodyguard, I guess.. Kind of a silly cover up, if you ask me..”
After a good twenty minutes, he pressed on the button again, stepping outside, dripping wet and wrapping the towel around him, inspecting himself at the mirror once he cleared it from the steam. He realised that he haven’t seen his reflection ever since he woke up, and the fact that he looked untouched by the passing of time made him feel on the stomach. What if his old friends were still alive, looking so old in their beds and he showed up, his strong posture just looking like it came out of those Captain America tapes? That would distance him from them even more, he thought to himself as he rubbed his chin, looking for any facial hair that needed trimming, but finding nothing. Pushing back his blonde mane, he turned away from the reflection on the mirror, putting on the clean change of clothes and heading back to the bedroom he was staying in, not bumping into Tony this time around.
“Just that your cooking skills, from what I had heard,” Steve said, taking another bite. “You have a reputation for not being the best of cooks. Though apparently what I heard was wrong.”
“I’m pretty sure they have a gym on the second floor that you can use while I’m away”, Tony yawned, the jet lag always being present even though Steve seemed to be absolutely fine.
“Mhm.. I should have done so sooner.. if I knew that you would react like that..”, Steve said softly, looking up after a while and caressing the man’s soft cheeks.
“Come on..”, he said between gritted teeth, managing to pull out a pointy, silver part. Upon further inspection, it wasn’t hard to figure out what it really was. He would spent hours reading about the Second World War, the weapons that were used, the tanks, planes.. that’s how he was introduced to the family business in first place. “This is a WW2 era German airplane..”, he muttered, mostly to himself, walking carefully around the iceberg, realising in horror that the rest of the plane, at least the cockpit, was stuck inside it.
“I’ll take this as a whole new learning experience then" Tony said with a firm nod. “The stars look prettier from here. We’re blessed with a clear sky.”
“I’m going there. They aren’t getting away with this, not a chance. It’s not just about me, have you seen those people? They still don’t have anything left, they had their lives thrown away and didn’t even get a replacement like I did.”
The door slid open and the cold breeze that blew on his face truly made Tony think that he was walking inside a freezer. “What…?”, he asked, eyes fixed on the tables and the sheets that covered something under each one of them.
Tony looked at him once more; he seemed too calm, far too quiet but he preferred it over having to calm down a panicked man.
Steve sighed a little, looking into Tony’s eyes. “So do I. I’ve never been close to anyone...” He trailed off, his hands reaching for Tony’s hands.
Steve kept his eyes on him the entire time, leaning closer to take a better look at those clever, blue eyes, illuminated by the reactor’s light coming out from Tony’s open shirt. After spending so much time with Tony, this was the most emotional talk that he had with him, and the fact that he considered him some sort of a guardian only made his heart fill with newfound joy. He needed that, he needed to know that someone really needed him there, especially when he thought that he couldn’t offer anything to this newfound world, not at this state.
“Do you want to relive that?” Tony offered, trying to be careful with his words – Steve was so innocent, only now learning to admit to things out loud. “Because I can make it work...well, if you want me to take over from where we left it back in Sparta.”
They walked for so long, Tony showed him everything in the facility, from the smallest room with dozens of monitors inside to the actual chambers where the tests were going to take place, but also the lab where the artificial limbs were being developed. Steve looked through the glass window, his hands reaching for his missing legs, resting on his thighs instead. He didn’t realise until that moment how desperately he wanted them back again. It was painful, to see everyone around him performing the simplest tasks with such an ease when he was initially struggling to even get himself out of bed without help. He was used to offer his help to others, not being the one needing it. He strongly believed that he could offer more, and the chance to do so was robbed from him by a rogue missile. Of course, the case was being investigated, trying to put the blame on someone, but so far, nothing came to the surface.
“I’m coming, don’t worry, your bacon won’t get over crispy this time around”, Tony chuckled as he fixed the photograph and gave it one last look before yelping as Steve nudged his shoulder.
“My point,” he said in a lower voice, “was that I’m not sure if my people are ready to accept such a change."
“That’s.. one of the oldest ones, I think, when they first started making them.. I remember Bucky’s reaction when we watched it together”, Steve said with a small laugh. “I gotta say, they were pretty inaccurate, but he took it more personally than I did”
“You have no idea. I don’t think anyone does until they actually get out there and under fire”, Steve muttered, shaking his head.
Tony breathed into him, Steve's lips against his own all he wanted to feel before his last breath left him, Steve's last words echoing in his ears. “It’s been an honour fighting...by your side.." he said as he reached for Steve’s hand, placing his own on top of it as his eyes closed, the loud noise of the battle around them barely audible any more.
“Before Reed found you… he found different version of you from other universes.”, Steve started, giving him some time to process. “According to him, they all fell from the sky, just like you did, but…”, he stopped, lifting the sheets of one of the closest tables. “…not all of them were lucky… in fact, you were the only one who was left alive… and we still don’t know why.”, he explained.
“Now if you excuse me, I have the next search party to prepare in about..”, he said, looking at his silver watch on his wrist. “5 hours. I’d rather shut my eyes for an hour or two before that”, he announced, shutting off the communication and taking off his large, dark blue parka that covered most of his face, especially when the goggles and hoodie were on. The only visible part of himself was his trademark beard that he carefully trimmed even in this cold weather.
“So.. this happened, huh? The two of us.. together.. it’s all real..”, Steve said, just to receive the confirmation he needed.
“Don’t sweat it, she will have it back by tomorrow. I’ll give you a ride home”, Tony interrupted him, heading close to wrap his hand around Steve’s waist. They were so used to this way of transportation, even before they started seeing each other, figuring out new ways for Tony to carry him every time.
Tony held their faces together, kissing Steve deeply in return as his back tensed to keep him.  He really didn’t mind if Steve was unsure; this was far more than he had ever hoped for, and he was enjoying the man’s affection the way things were.
“Right. The meeting is on the ground floor, I’m sure you can occupy yourself for a couple of hours until I’m done, right?”, Tony asked as he opened his suitcase, pulling out a dark suit and started changing into it.
Steve watched Tony and then tilted his head up, looking up at the stars too. “I wonder if I have changed the tapestry of fate, by telling you what I knew.”
“Captain America… what will you have left? Nothing at all, everything that you love is taken away from you, you’re sealing your own fate!”
Steve laughed. “No, it was a nice vision,” he said blushing slightly ad he pulled his arms back to wrap around his own chest.
“I’m fine with staying here”, Steve said as he closed the bedroom door behind him. “You don’t normally eat with me though..?”
“Then I’m happy that I’m the first one to do so,” Tony said with a nod, rubbing Steve’s shoulder as he noted calm and relaxed he was, as opposed to the Steve from earlier who had shouted at him.
“I see. Thanks for letting me know, Happy”, he finally replied, offering his hand for him to shake. “Take care, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
The Captain shook his head. “It’s absolutely fine, I understand you’re busy with this..Stane fella?”, he asked, somewhat glad that he could think of something else for now.
“Only if you want to," Tony replied, continuing though he wished he didn't have to. “If you don’t, there’s an empty chamber next door..."
“Very well, Athenian. I offered you a chance, “he replied with a scoff, stepping at the side, “a chance to learn from us and our culture, and I thought that you with all your hunger for knowledge would appreciate it. If you don’t wish for it, then be on your way."
“This is Happy Hogan. Happy, this is Steve Rogers”, he said, the man taking off his hat and offering his strong hand for Steve to shake.
Tony didn’t really expect Steve to agree, but when he did, Tony could hardly hide his excitement. He waved for Steve to follow him, walking out of the palace and into the main city to go through the market, amongst the people who were busy with his chores. And he couldn’t stop thinking of the way Steve blushed after the kiss, and the way he came back to him to return it, even if it was just a noble gesture. It had still been sweet.
“Easy there, Stark.”, Steve replied as he let his book at side and helped Tony sit up properly in his bed.
“How come that you’re so interested in this project, Tony? I know that want to dive into new markets and industries, but I wanted to ask you, is it something..personal..?”
“Affirmative”, Tony replied as he watched Steve examining the arms of the suit, always unable to hide his excitement when it came to Tony’s own creations, which he seemed to love way more than he initially thought he would. “Mr Stark requested that you try my new functions, sir”, he said with a cheeky smile, holding back a chuckle.
“And if you ever bring down those barriers?” Tony asked. “What happens then? Is there any chance of saving me?”
“All right.. we have.. salmon, tuna, prawn.. ah, this one is actually an omelette”, Tony said as Steve joined him and stared at the yellow piece. He picked up his pair of chopsticks and offer one to Steve as well, swiftly taking a salmon piece and eating with a content smile.
“Meet me outside in a few minutes”, Tony shouted at him, with Steve nodding and running against the crowd.
“I honestly don’t know how to respond to that, thank you, Steve... I’m really glad that it’s you. For the project, I mean, we couldn't honestly get someone better for it, you are..perfect”
“I’m fine, don’t you worry," Tony reassured him, giving his back a soft kiss. “Just tell me if you want me next to you.”
They walked inside the same large tent where the Captain was being kept, the rest of the crew members opening a path, their taser guns still aimed at the man, who didn’t try to hide his annoyance
“Have you been exercising while I was away? That was one heck of a kick”, he replied, rubbing his arm.
“Leave it, it’s fine. I’ll stay on my side, don’t worry”, Steve reassured him as he left down their bags and went ahead to wash his hands and unpack.
Tony reached for Steve as he pulled away, wanting to say so more, but he couldn’t with everyone else in the room, with everyone accusing him of doing something that could bring the wrath of the Gods to him. “Wait, Steve I- didn’t say that, I said that it wasn’t him," he said, pointing at the archer. “Will you leave us alone?” he snapped, ignoring Rhodey’s disapproving gaze on him.
“Do you mean he tried to hurt you before? And you still keep him around?”, Steve blinked, wondering if the machine on Tony’s chest was the result of a personal attack on him from his rivals. “Because that doesn’t sound like a smart move to me, no offence.. you should do something about that”
“So you insult me in front of your people because it’s what they want to hear?” Steve said, rolling his eyes. “A man of the people.”
“...Pepper?”, Steve asked as he turned back to him. Tony was dumping many things on him at once, and this name sure didn’t ring any bells.
Tony’s eyes widened; he didn’t know what was going on, if that was the both of them sort of confessing to each other in a way.
Tony was interrupted again, this time being thrown on the ground, as the man pulled the wires away from his chest, grabbing a satellite dish that there for repairment and running towards the exit as the men ran after him.
“Son of Athena, you seem to see yourself as a saviour, but if you heard me out too, you would realize that we don’t need saving. What help are you offering to give, without implying that we are lacking any of your qualities? Speak up and I will judge myself whether or not you are to be trusted,” he finally said as he got the spear in his hands again and moved slightly back, nodding at Steve to start talking.
“No, it wasn’t,” Tony said, smiling a little as he stroked Steve's cheek with his thumb. “That’s why I kept asking you to stay; I need some time to come to my senses.”
That feeling, wanting to be the one in control got even worse ever since their nights together seemed to be more frequent, and Tony needed to feel powerful yet again, relive his glorious, good old days, but he could see that being a gentleman about it got him nowhere. He needed to use all his intelligence in a more mischievous way, and that’s when he told Steve that he was working on a different suit for him, still gutted about the loss of the Iron Patriot. In reality, that suit wasn’t anything special in particular, at least not from the outside. Nobody could know until it was activated, and Tony had a plan in mind to help him get on top once again.
The moment that he spotted the walls he had only seen once before, he held more tightly onto his spear, the medallion feeling so heavy around his neck.
Tony shook his head. “Because, in reality, who really wants to get on the bad side of the gods?” he said. “And anyway, you might call fear, but it’s different. It’s like watching everyone that ever doubted you just stopping, letting you do your work, without mocking or questioning your authority.”
That particular day, Tony was sitting in his chambers, polishing his sword, when his close friend Rhodey stepped inside. If he wasn’t Tony’s best friend, he would probably get mocked about his female name, but nobody wanted to get on the God’s bad side.
Steve stared at Tony, trying to think of an answer. “I always wanted to have a friend, but it can be nothing more if I am to continue my duties.”
Steve waking up covered in sweat, his palm placed on his chest, panting for air wasn’t an unusual sight for Tony.
“We’re pretty much the same person… so very similar designs and concepts, I need to make some alternations, and I'm not too keen on the black and yellow pattern… but I can pilot those suits, no problem. I've built about… 42 of them back home.”, Tony nodded as he turned to look at the blond.
“Whatever may be happening, I am confident that our parents will inform us when they feel we must know.”
"Alright Dean, take a deep breath for me." Steve had his hands on either side of Dean's ribcage, assessing his breathing. "Any pain?" Dean shook his head. "Okay, well I don't think anything's broken, you'll have to thank Thor for reacting so quickly or that might not have been the case."
Steve went to reach for the child, but Dean was faster. He launched himself to his feet and knelt in front of Clint, trying to catch his eye.
Tony and Steve looked at Dean. Then at each other. "Dean," Tony started, "I promise we will never harm Sam. If your dad comes, we're not going to stop you from seeing him. But this hostility? It needs to stop."
With a laugh, Steve kissed his husband and continued pounding the man's hole, using it at a fuck toy, continually lick and sucking at Tony's neck and chest. When Steve's rhythm began faltering, Tony clenched his hole and felt the blond breathing heavily into his neck. The genius pulled on the man's hair and swallowed the groan that came with Steve's release.
"No, Sam," the teen stood up abruptly. "I don't care if you get into that stupid Freudian 'everyone wants to fuck their mom' crap, but keep it away from me."
Sam threw the covers off and hurried about the room, gathering textbooks and socks along the way before throwing open the door to a startled Tony.
"Okay then. We're going to eat in the casual dining room, we'll call for you when the food is ready. If you get lost we'll send someone to come find you. Now it's time for Mr. Wilson and Mr. Coulson to go home, why don't you say goodbye." Steve pushed his husband toward the stairs, muttering about leaving them to get acclimatized.
"I thought all the shrinks said you were normal," Dean pointed out. "That you had no idea what was going on."
"How'd you get so smart?" Steve pondered sarcastically, wrapping his arms around the smaller man, giving him a true kiss this time.
"What's this about?" the teen asked as he and the two men sat around the breakfast table. Dean was very aware of how much this resembled their conversation just a few weeks earlier.
“Do you really want to do that to Steve and Tony?” Dean asked quietly. “These guys have waited four years to bring you over to be their son, and you’re gonna risk all that for a memory that you’re gonna have anyways?”
"Hey," Dean sat up further, throwing the blanket off. "I didn't look out for you because dad told me to. You're my little brother. I'll always be here for you, Sammy. You know that."
The boy ignored her and continued crying, throwing the block as well. Sighing, Natasha sat on the ground next to her brother. "Come on, Clint, she's coming back, you know she is. She comes back every day."
"We took you in because you needed somewhere to go. As simple as that," Steve smiled. Dean was sitting stiffly, glancing both at Steve and at Tony's hand that held his. "I know it's hard to understand with what you've seen, but the world does have some good people in it, and we like to think we're some of them," the blond man wrapped his arm around Tony, creating the picture of a happy couple.
The man opened his phone and wordlessly asked if he could read the message out loud, which Natasha answered with a nod.
As Steve grabbed his bags from the trunk, Tony leaned against the car, smiling. "Last moment of quiet before you head back into the madhouse."
Steve and Tony were beaming with pride and joy at the emotional output Bruce shared, but knew not to linger on it. "And how about you?" Steve asked, looking pointedly at Clint.
"Nobody's doing anything to me!" the boy shouted, a look of fear now clouding his face as he continually failed to pull the arm back and cover the proof.
The man pressed his hand against the wound, but it was too deep and too late, he stumbled with the weight of the girl on his back and fell to his knees in a puddle of his own blood.
The two sat in the den, simply looking at each other. Tony lifted an eyebrow slightly and Steve responded with a sly grin. Wordlessly, they got up and began racing to the bedroom, pausing occasionally to kiss the other before leaving them behind to catch up.
The last stop on the tour was their room. It was twice as big as their last motel room with dad and held two identical wooden frame double beds. The walls were sparsely decorated but was painted in shades of green and blue. Opposite their beds were matching desks and wardrobes, complete with laptops on the desks and clothes filling the drawers.
“Are there no adults you trust with that at all?” Steve inquired. “Doesn’t have to be a doctor, do you trust one adult to never force you to do anything of the kind?”
"Hey, did you hear me calling for you?" the woman asked with a soft expression. She started moving her hands quickly while speaking and added: "You're not deaf are you?"
"I acted out in front of them. Did stupid stuff," Sam shrugged, obviously oblivious to the implications he gave his brother. "I thought if they wanted to hit me, I'd have my proof and we'd get out of there."
Waiting for his heart to calm down, Dean slowly pulled himself up. Cautiously, he peered over the side of the bed, hoping to gage the man’s reaction and make a break for it, if necessary.
Another pause with the sound of more glass clinking. "Alright. The whiskey's gone, Stark. Ask your questions."
"Natasha, what do you mean he took advantage of her?" He spoke calmly and carefully, as if approaching a wild animal.
"You better be sorry you-" The engineer muttered as he folded himself in the larger man's hug. "Now what's this about you figured something out?"
They were too far apart to hear, but Tony saw the man mouth his name before making a dead sprint towards the waiting area. The genius simply opened his arms and caught the love of his life as Steve wrapped himself around his husband and buried his face into the engineer's hair, freshly washed for the occasion.
Tony revelled in the feeling of his husband's chest, flattening his hands over abs and around pecs and raking his fingernails down the soldier's nipples and feeling him suck just a little harder. The engineer gasped and threw his head back when he felt Steve bite his collarbone.
“I’m fine, Steve.” Dean ducked, trying to avoid the hand headed for his forehead. Steve got him anyway, briefly touching Dean’s heated skin with the back of his hand.
“But why can’t I see them?” Sam questioned. The boy had woken up between crisp, stiff sheets in an unfamiliar white room. A gentle-faced woman was sitting at his side who, though kind and altogether polite, had refused to let him leave or go see his foster parents.
leave. Every time she tried to force out a sentence it felt like the world was suffocating her. So she didn't try anymore.
"I don't understand why you're doing this Dean." Steve told him as they were driving back from the clinic.
Phil had returned with three other men, two of the most jacked blonde guys Dean had ever seen, and a short man with dark hair and an impressive goatee.
"I don't understand, Tasha. He said all I'd have to do is sit there and he'd give me ice cream! But I didn't like how he was touching me! It made me feel all icky!" Clint sobbed into his sister's threadbare dress.
The subject was dropped quickly when Natasha pulled her brother aside to lecture him on 'subtly, which I highly doubt you have an ounce of in your entire body'.
“He and dad fought about that thing in Missouri a couple years back, remember?” Dean shook his head. “They haven’t spoken since.”
The new family also meant that Natasha had to go to school, a place she hadn't been to since their mother left. So, with a hug to Clint and a hand on Barney's old backpack, she took a deep breath and walked into the schoolyard. Clint's step-mother kept asking her if she'd made friends. It was hard to make friends when you refused to talk to them.
Getting on his hands and knees, Steve began to crawl up his husband's body. "You know you love it," he whispered, kissing Tony once more. Coming back up, Steve reached for the forgotten lube. "You ready?" he asked as he warmed the lube in his hands.
"In case I was curled up on the floor or attacking innocent nurses, you mean," Bucky smiled softly and held out his hand for Steve to grab.
Sam shrugged and opening his book, replied: “It’s just a plane, Dean, I don’t know what you’re so scared of.”
"Is that what you want?" Tony asked, crawling his way up the bed to look up at the captain, still in his army suit. "You wanna throw me around? Hold me down? Have your way with me, 'Captain'?" he practically purred.
"Alright, then, everyone get their bags and lunches," he ordered, watching as the chaos around him unfolded.
Sam immediately wanted to sit beside Bruce and talk science, while Dean almost got sacked when he winked at Natasha. He sat far away from her at the table.
Dean looked from Tony, to Steve, and lastly to Sam, who was too busy asking Bruce about the swirly thing on the cover of a science textbook to notice the commotion. After a moment, he dropped his head in defeat and shuffled towards the stairs.
But Tony frowned at how torn Steve clearly was, not sure what he had done to cause that distress. It looked so similar to the expression Steve had worn the night before. “Steve? I have to tell you some things," he finally said, sitting up, even though Steve was still above him, wanting to come clean. Maybe telling him what he really thought on the matter would cause Steve to leave, but he couldn’t stop feeling as though he was taking advantage of the man’s innocence, a thought that only filled his heart with guilt.
“How do you feel…?”, Steve asked him as he examined him carefully, ready to take an action if he had to interfere in any way.
That particular night seemed different. They went to bed at the same time, something that was almost rare amongst them, Tony always stayed up late working on everything he could think of, and Steve was retiring to the bedroom, bored and hoping that Tony would get the hint. Eventually, Tony would sneak in after a quick shower, and take his side of the bed, careful not to wake Steve up, even though they both knew he was wide awake.
“How many times do I have to tell you to call me Bucky?”, he frowned, giving Steve a nudge on his shoulder with his good hand.
Steve placed down his scrolls as Tony moved forward giving him space to embrace him. As he gently raised his arms around Tony, he felt his lower lip quiver slightly in sadness, knowing that deep down in his heart he wanted it too.
“My men know very well that dying in battle is considered a privilege. As son of Ares himself, I wouldn’t let any Athenian take the joy of war away from me or my people, and we’ll ensure that the great Sparta stands above any other Greek city. You have your ways, we have ours, and did you come all the way here to talk democracy and tragedies with us?” Tony asked him calmly, not losing his temper this time around.
“So you refuse help when it’s asked from you? Is that it?” Tony asked with another hiss. “How blunt does someone have to be to appreciate their call for help?”
Steve stopped, lowering his head for a moment, cursing himself before he spoke for having this need to reply. “You have not done anything to prove otherwise,” he said. “Many of my friend’s lives have been lost at your hands.”
Steve was so relaxed, even though he would hardly talk during those rides, always relieved to put his own two feet on the ground. Still, having Tony hold him close like that was a blessing back in the day, and he was glad that his cowl covered most of his blush, not that Tony was able to see.
“The results aren’t too bad so far. In fact, they seem to be perfect. Too perfect. Which of course is good, it will speed up the procedure and lower the chance of any unwanted side effects happening.”
“Is that the custom in Sparta?” he asked. “Is it rude for me not to reciprocate?” He wanted to know. He was curious, always curious, especially when it came to learning new things.
Before he knew it, he was back at the facility; when the large doors were opened, all eyes were focused on him. His hands resting on his legs clenched into fists, taking a deep breath before relaxing and wheeling himself deeper inside.
Tony pouted slightly, crossing his arms. “Speaking of which, that shield is one magnificent weapon, I couldn’t help but stare at it before.”
After Steve had spent some time teaching Tony, he pulled out some brushes and dark coloured natural paints that he kept amongst his scrolls, showing them to Tony with pride. “These are the finest in Athens,” He said.
He clenched his jaw tightly, lowering his shield even more and standing for a moment. “I came to offer help to you. Instead you violate my words and make me turn to this so that I can be heard. And yet you still don’t listen when I use your own methods of communication. What else am I to do?”
Steve loved the small flutter in his heart every time he touched Tony. “Well, it was an accurate representation, I hope.” he said, standing up to look down at his work from a different perspective.
His horses were white and very tall and proud looking, delegated specifically for him along with a beautiful silver chariot with intricate patterns.
Now, both of them were competitive and perfectionists by nature, so more elaborate recipes and builds were attempted, and it was when Steve argued that there shouldn’t be so many different ways to make a decent cup of hot chocolate. Tony of course teased him, asking if he quit and Steve huffed, keeping a grumpy face the entire next day until Tony came in with a new cup, this time with an edible chocolate spoon.
Steve let out another sigh, but this time he seemed more pleased with Tony’s words. After all, he was allowed to feel proud of what Tony became, of how he changed him for the best.
“I’m not playing games, nor am I in a gaming mood. I’m talking straight, man to man here”, Tony replied, growing weary himself.
Steve’s voice sounded nothing like the calm, soothing voice of his from the night before; he seemed ready to explode, he could only imagine how he felt. To hear that his life was ruined in the name of so called science, that he was exploited so blatantly, and that the man who he seemed to trust the most at that point of his life worked for those men...
Tony shivered when he felt Steve’s firm hand gripping his own, their eyes meeting for that split second, before Tony turned his head away quickly, smiling.
“I’m going to cut you right here, Stark. I’m not sure if you were informed, but I didn’t give my final reply yet. I will after you show me around first.”
What could they possibly want for him at that point? He was starting to get slightly annoyed, he just wanted to get better on his own without people pitying him or trying to make him do something that he simply wasn’t. The sudden thought of people wanting to study him made his blood boil. He didn’t fight in wars only to lose his legs, retire and become a test subject of some sort.
That’s what they would say when trying to explain Tony’s broken heart. He wasn’t careless, but the moment that he let someone inside his walls, they were easily shattered and broken down. That’s what happened everytime that he decided to let someone handle his heart; there was never a happy ending to any of those stories.
Steve looked at him carefully. “Perhaps...a rest is needed. And after that rest I can decide whether I wish to stay.”
Everyone knew who both these men were, the Starks were one of the wealthiest families still around and Stark Industries got famous during the 40’s, with Howard Stark’s involvement in the war. He should have guessed that his son would carry on the family tradition, even though Steve only saw his interviews in different magazines and didn’t know what to make off him. He seemed like a type of person that he wouldn’t normally approach and befriend.
His chin was tugged down whilst his hand pawed over Tony’s reactor, the bright light that kept him going. Steve tilted his head forward, trying to shake the hair out of his face as he felt himself on the verge of finishing, hungrily kissing Tony only to break it moments later, calling out Tony’s name as he clutched to the metal chest plate as hard as he could, his body tensing finally before climaxing. With a loud pant he slumped forward and rested on the large metallic suit, counting on the cold metal to cool him down, even though by now the metal was warm from all of the movement.
“A genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist”, Tony replied coldly. Something was off, but right now nobody would notice. This wasn’t Tony Stark’s usual kind of reply, no. It wasn’t snarky, it was a forced reply, trying to sound like his usual self, but somehow it didn’t.
“Thank you, Shellhead”, he smiled once they were back, taking off his cowl and allowing his fluffy hair to jump out.
“Please. Please bring him back. Do something, father, please!” he yelled, looking at the sky, then down to Steve, leaning to press their foreheads together. “No... No... We’re going together; we’re walking those gates together. Together...” he said, his heart instantly feeling weaker the moment that he removed the one thing that kept him strong.
“And you know, I have nothing against that, for once," Tony said with a smirk, shutting his eyes to rub his cheek against Steve’s hand, enjoying every subtle touch.
They fought, they managed to win, and Steve rose up to deliver one of his speeches that made him who he was; the Captain America. They would bury their dead and then get back on their feet, be who they always were, the Avengers. They defended the world and put asides their own selves, and they wouldn’t just rebuild Asgard, they would rebuild their team, the world. Tony felt a fiery passion burning inside him when Steve was uttering those words. The soldier knew exactly how to boost up the morale of his troops, and this is why he was their Captain after all.
When the alert came in, the thought of what day it was just vanished from his mind, suiting up in no time and flying out. From what he gathered, Natasha asked for help in what should have been a stealth mission, an easy one for her. The wrong intel was fed to them, and the AIM lab she was meant to infiltrate had a little more manpower than anticipated to be taken out in a stealthy way.
Tony shook his head, head turned to start scanning the area. “He’s got Christmas business to attend to. Got it, the big guy there? The device in his hand, if we get our hands on that, it shuts down this whole shindig. No sure what it does yet, but I’m sure that we don’t want to stick around to find out.”
It was beyond his control, the way that Tony would scratch him made him unbelievably happy, like a proper canine. He was grateful for Tony’s devotion and patience, he spent hours with him training, making sure that he still acted human regardless of his feral state. Steve wanted to let him know that he had everything under control, but the only way to confirm that was to offer Tony a human like hug, his huge hands, covered in gold fur, wrapped around the smaller man’s frame. Tony not so secretly enjoyed it, it was warm and comfortable.
“Make sure?” Steve asked, his muscles tensing slightly as Tony trailed his fingers along his pectorals.
“Ah, you should be careful with what you’re saying, Herr Rogers. We are the ones who made you walk, again, remember? We can easily.. take that away”
Tony took a deep breath; he avoided talking about this at all times but right now he was talking to a war vet that lost his legs, he saw the same, if not worse, destruction that he did. If there was one person that could understand how he felt, that would be Steve. He avoided talking in detail about it even to therapists that he visited, but something about the vet’s calm and soothing tone in his voice, his firm grasp from earlier and the concerned look in his eyes made him want to talk more for the first time in his life.
The room was in silence now, the argument focusing between those two, nobody daring to say anything.
“Is this what you put up with?”, Steve asked him, pointing at the elevator. “That sort of guys work for you?And you let them act like that?”
“They also talk about how you are a demon,” Steve added leaning down to fix his sandals, making sure they were tied on properly. “Worse than the ones that rest in Pandora’s Box.”
The billionaire sighed, knowing that it would be pointless to either protest or trying to see what Steve was up to. A pat on his shoulder made him turn around, facing Steve with a happy smile on his face, showing off the now painted padlock on his palm. Steve had painted his shield and Tony’s arc reactor next to it, joint together, the letters “S” and “T” written across them.
The man before them was shorter than Tony; he did look slightly older, his dark brown hair having very faint grey lines, as well as his trademark beard. What Steve noticed though, was that he lacked Tony’s warm, blue eyes; this Tony had large, brown eyes, and he surely didn't look happy.
“We’re not your enemies, we’re here on behalf of the American government. We need to fill you in about what happened, Captain, if you would like to come with me in-”
He bit back a moan as the second finger entered his body, his loins aching with ecstasy, getting more excited by the suit, the beautifully crafted suit. His head rested on the table, his chest heaving as the fingers were feeling around him. So this was what it was like to be in Tony’s position, no wonder he moaned so much. The soft pulse of the fingers was driving him to his limits, hearing the clicking of the suit as it moved. His eyes opened to stare at it, its gold faceplate, its crimson red body and glowing chest. Steve found himself giving in to a suit, a non-living entity but he couldn’t stop seeing it as the man that had saved him countless times in battle, the thing that had displayed such heroism.
Tony nodded in return, lightly pushing Steve back on the bed, taking his moment to appreciate the man’s beauty. His face was so full of emotions; fear, agony, even adoration, but all for him. He rubbed Steve's cheek once again before moving his hand lower, to his chest, and then he placed his lips over Steve’s neck to press soft kisses against the warm flesh.
“Well, if he’s out to get you, you should be worried too”, Steve simply said. “So, what does he want from you now?”
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose lightly to stop himself from displaying how pained he was by such ideals. “I do not wish to follow the example of those who fight over and over without cause, including the Gods,” he said, taking a step back. “I will heed your words, Spartan, though I will not endorse such behaviour. I never will. War is tragic, and the lives lost are countless. That is something I fight against, and I always will.”
“It does get hard but I don’t give up so easily, despite my last failed attempt talking to you,” Steve answered, placing the vase down and picking up his things to move on.
“Steve, wait!” he called again, standing up, only to be stopped by the blonde who stood in front of him.
Tony’s rubbed his chin in interest, it was about time that they sent someone down, and he was getting impatient. It was the local law, the Sherriff had to stop by the saloon for a welcoming drink, and all that Tony had to do was wait. He put on his jacket and fixed his shirt, wanting to look formal enough for the newcomer and nodded at Thor in his corner, whose hat hid his watchful eyes. Soon he was going to be offered a drink and he would ask for Tony’s permission to sit down and relax for a bit.
Together, he had no idea where this could lead them, but he knew that the moment when Steve gently got his hand around his waist and lifted them both in the air, that only good things could come out of all this. The blonde didn’t seem to be losing his focus anymore as Tony cupped his face, lips touching his own, the long, soft kiss doing the talk for them.
Steve expected to see the same deteriorated, old factory from outside on the inside too, but he was greeted by a busy lab, equipped with the latest tech possible. Everyone seemed to be busy, some people with labcoats didn’t even turn to see the newcomers, but others stopped what they were doing, muttering inaudible things to each other, but Steve knew that they were all talking about him. He wondered if Zola and Tarleton informed everyone of his arrival, which was probably the case. The building looked and felt cold, and it sure made Steve feel uncomfortable; he disliked hospitals, too many unpleasant memories took part in them, and this facility reeked of that. This was meant to be a new beginning for him, he had to stop worrying about everything and remind himself of the benefits of the experiment. He wanted to go back to the battlefield, get his legs back, to feel useful. In the end, that was what he was craving, to be able to give back to his country, and he knew that without his legs, he couldn’t reach the peak of his abilities. However, this “future” didn’t look too trustworthy to him.
“And why exactly are you asking that, Stane?”, Tony asked him defensively. “That shouldn’t concern you, Steve is here as a guest, not any lab rat or whatever you might be planning”
Steve’s chest felt heavy as he mentally went through different names, not knowing where to start from. The part of him that hoped that all of this was just a nightmare was urging him to ask about Bucky, but the memory of the teen holding on the plane and Steve falling down, watching it explode on the sky was far too painful for him to relive.  Now that he was thinking about it, he didn’t know if he actually wanted to know about the whereabouts or what happened to his friends. Bracing himself, he decided to only ask one question, for now.
Steve's expression turned more serious for a while, and then he glanced down momentarily to think. He was forbidden to fall in love. But he was sure his mother would understand that he was doing what he needed to do to protect his city. “Do you wish for us to be lovers, then?” he asked.
Although their words weren’t heeded by their people, their self-sacrifice did not go unrewarded. In the end they ended up together for eternity, resting with one another despite the quarrels of their parents, in their own peace, their differences set aside in favour of the overruling love that they had for one another. They were destined to be together forever in bliss and harmony.
“I started very young, that’s what we all do, when I was around seven," Tony started to explain, surprised that Steve wanted to hear about it. “We learned how to fight, how to wield swords, how to depend on each other. They were really strict with us. And when I was of legal age I joined the army, that’s what we all have to do. I still train; I throw spears, I walk up the mountain, we carry boulders between our shoulder blades. All to make us tough.”
