He glanced at Bruce, who nodded.
“You're meeting the others today. They called yesterday but I didn't tell you because you wouldn't have slept.”
“I don't want to tell you, Bruce !”
“I'm going to move out of the Tower. Find an appartment somewhere, but not Brooklyn.”
“Bucky,” Natasha sighed and waited for the soldier to look her in the eye. “This is about you. You need to know that you're free. You can get your own place and spend your days at the tower, or get your own place and just stay there all the time, or simply stay at the tower, and no one will judge your actions. You're free, Bucky.”
Ok, before you start on the Clint hate, if you do spread clint hate in your comment, meaning : WHAT AN ASSHOLE or any insult, would it be towards me or any of my characters, your comment will not be approved. I'm sick of the hate, bad vibes are really what I need right now and I EXPLAINED, they're angry. They're going to calm down soon, and Clint will be regretting each and everyone of his words. You can say that he acted like an asshole tho. I mean it's not hate it's just stating the obvious... Just, don't insult anyone, kay ? My poor feels don't like it  at all ^^"
'I know !' Steve screamed inside, wanting to cry. But for once, he was the one wearing the mask of iron. Bucky needed him. Tony was going to be just fine. Right ?
“Come on Buck, don't think we don't notice how you seem to avoid Steve and Tony as much as possible.” Said Natasha, sitting on the other side of Bucky. The soldier startled.
“And what would that be exactly ?” Questioned Bruce.
In those last two days, he had spent time with Thor, listening to tales of Asgard and telling some of his own stories about world war two. He had avoided talking about Steve, though. Bucky felt like he needed some time away from the blond. He wasn't angry anymore, though. After all, a month had passed, and Bucky had barely seen Steve. The supersoldier seemed to have understood that Bucky didn't want to see his face, and had taken the habit to leave the room whenever Bucky entered. The raven haired man suspected that Steve did the same for Tony.
“Did the Winter Soldier...?” Asked Tony, fearing the answer.
Next Chapter is : Watching
And it never failed to end the discussion, since they both knew Tony blamed Bucky, they didn't need to ask the genius to know that.
“It's like... They were made to be weak, intentionally. But look at these. Cameras and microphones. They were observing us.” Tony Stark was saying. He sounded tense.
“What.” Clint let escape, agape.
Bucky was gone. Again. Steve made him go away.
Bruce sighed and laughed sadly. “No, of course you can’t. You’re in a coma.”
I haven't even written "Chapter 21" On my google doc, but hey, I have a plan for it anyway !
“What do you mean smart ? Every child is smart in their own way” Had asked Steve.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Thor said he is a nice guy, though. We can’t just decide who tells the truth between him and Clint.’
Tony slowly opened his eyes to the light blue ceiling of his bedroom and groaned in pain. He was hurting everywhere.
Steve wished he could just die already.
‘It’s all on me’
Hawkeye looked at the target. “He's breathing. His pulse is normal, if not a bit weak. He looks paler than usual. He aslo have several wounds caused by the robots' lasers. We might need Bruce, the soldier is right.”
It had been 70 days since Steve had broke up with him. 70 days of heartbreak, 70 nights spents crying into his pillow and waking up from horrifying nightmares. 70 days spent hoping that Steve would reach out, appologize, ask to be forgiven (and Tony would probably forgive him, because he loves him). 70 nights spent trying to convince himself that the next day he will wake up to a sleeping super soldier, discovering that this nightmare was just a dream. 69 mornings revealing the ugly truth : this is real, this Tony's life now.
‘Stop complaining and drowning in self pity. You’re a weight, for all of the Avengers. It’s time you release that weight, because we all really miss the old times’
Bucky stared at him. This guy was fearless. The bowman wasn't even tense at the idea of being sat right next to the Winter Soldier. Barton, who had focused on the screen for a few seconds, must have found the lack of answers weird, because he turned to Bucky again, frowning.
XD speaking of puppy eyes, you're gonna love chapter 14... Or maybe not. Ok no more spoilers I always spoil everything.
I meant that I'll love you forever
I know the tags say Bucky has PTSD, but PTSD doesn't always mean flashbacks all the time, I know it coz I have PTSD. Thank whoever's listening tho, because it's not too bad, just some flashbacks and nightmares and wait why am I telling you all this XD I'm just saying, be patient, Bucky's PTSD will come.
He started talking again, his vision blurring more and more with each word he spoke.
Chapter 12's title : .... It has no title. Shit. I forgot to name it. Wait a few minute imma read it again.
“And you two ! Especially you Natasha ! Couldn't you see that he wasn't fine ?! And you Bruce ! I can't believe you let him out of medical when he could barely stand !”
“For you maybe, but not for us, humans. I would know, with what he did to me !”
'I fucked up.' He thought.
“You could make it yourself, you cook way better than me. Look at my eggs, they don't even look eatable.”
Tony followed the little blond thief for hours, wondering how the hell this kid hadn’t noticed him yet. Seriously, the boy never looked around once. He wasn’t a really good thief, he was really lucky he hadn’t  stole from that bastard of Justin Hammer. This guy would have had him put in jail for sure.
Bruce opened the bathroom door, making Steve scream “No !”
It was Tony's turn to blush.
“So, how would you like your eggs, Cap ?” Asked Clint in fake-politeness.
“Hum, language Stevie” Singsonged Bucky as he entered the room, smirking and looking very satisfied with himself.
“I request to be paired with the Target.”
It hadn't been Steve's fault, it hadn't been anyone's fault, it was an accident, a consequence no one could have ever seen.. Coming. Pietro. That guy was the reason why Clint was acting like this. This had felt too much like Sokovia.
“Tony ?” Someone was holding onto his arms, but it wasn't painful. “Tony come back to me doll.” The genius opened his eyes. Why were they closed anyway ? When his vision focused, it was to find the face of a very concerned Bucky Barnes. The concern disappeared slightly when the man smiled at him. “Yes doll, that's it, come back to reality. You're doing well. Breathe with me.” Bucky said as he pulled the inventor against him so that their chest were against one another.
I would like to thank Every_Fandom_Trash too, she is the one who motivated me to write this fanfic, and she will most certainly be the reason I finish it, so everyone go on her profile and read her fanfics, she's awesome !
short extract (did you know those are really hard to select, like, what the hell am I spoiling today ? Oh no not that, too spoily, not that, they'll get the wrong expectations, not that either it's boring...) :
His expression did not even change when Jarvis applied the disinfectant. He was so used to the sting by now, that he almost felt nothing.
Bucky frowned. What a strange question.
------------------------------
'Well, shit.' Thought Steve as he heard the genius walk out of the room in quick angry steps and close the door.
“Ah don’t worry big guy, that’s just the cookies burn… WAIT WHO FORGOT THE COOKIES !?”
Bruce took one step backwards. And a second. Then another.
For a moment, Steve had just wanted to join them, sit next to them and hug them both. And then he remembered. The Winter Soldier. Howard and Maria's death.
For the first time in his very long life, he felt truly alone.
Oh no, the Asset was going to get punished, in the end. The doctor seemed really angry at him.
“No Tony, I cannot be certain. There are good chances that he will make a full recovery, but only because he was injected with a serum similar to Steve’s. However he was as heavily injured - if not more - as Steve, and his healing abilities were badly affected by the number and severity of the injuries, and as a result, functioned with a lot less efficiency. If Bucky’s healing abilities did the same, well…” Steve. Something was not right. “It may take,” Steve.” Hum, a long time for him to recover, if he ever does. However we shouldn’t forget that he is lucky to be a supersoldier. He would be dead otherwise.” Bruce told them as he grew more and more anxious of the well being of the other supersoldier.
“I take it you paid a visit to Barnes ? Is he alright ?” Asked the archer after the door closed.
Tony took a few steps back.
“Brother !” Shouted Thor as he ran down the stairs.
/Us./
'Not here' Bucky thought. He did not want the Asset and Tony in the same room.
Next chapter is Steve and Bucky in the hospital. it contains bruce yelling, tony being sad and guilty, thor being overprotective, steve being suicidal, clint being a sad crying puppy, natasha being said puppy's pillow, and overprotective too. see ya im late for my math class (this sucks !)
There was a tense and heavy silence in the room.
“It is.”
Clint was on the top of a building, watching over Natasha and shooting at robots when he had the time. He could see Thor and Tony doing a really good job at destroying the flying bots and saving the civilians, but he could barely see the two supersoldiers. His vision was blocked by a pile of rubble.
“Oh so hum, Winter Soldier. What are you doing ? What's your plan ?”
“Good morning soldier.”
He didn't feel hungry, though.
“I-” Tried to explain Steve, before shutting his mouth. What could he say ? It was all on him.
“Deal.”
It was Steve's turn to take a step back, scared that Tony was talking about Bucky. Tony took a step forward.
“I care about you. And even if you don’t believe it, they care about you.”
Steve could not hear JARVIS anymore.
Bucky suddenly flinched.
“Call me Bucky”
And then Tony's eyes widened comically and finding himself speechless as he opened his mouth once, twice, and a third time before finally talking.
Bucky’s lips were dark pink, almost red.They looked bloody on his pale skin - paler than usual - Steve noted.
There was something desperate in the assassin's voice that Clint didn't like at all. How bad was the situation exactly ? Why wasn't anyone else responding to the soldier's calls ?
I know, even my extracts are angsty. I'm so mean. x)
questionable, no wonder Damian never had a company worth investing in), that somehow everything will get smoothed over between them. Tony has responded by turning “avoiding Damian Grey at social events” into an art form. It’s just his luck that tonight, he’s too distracted by making Steve laugh to notice Damian before his hand is clamping down too tight on Tony’s bicep, and Steve is stiffening like someone just insulted the Dodgers.
“And you haven’t rebuilt the Tower yet?”
“What is this,
. Let’s just…get it over with.” Steve closes his eyes again. There’s a heavy silence coming from the other side of the car seat, as if Tony doesn’t even know where to start.
“Thought you weren’t willing to let me drag you around your apartment?” Tony points out. Rogers just shrugs.
It occurs to Tony suddenly how this must sound: like Tony thinks Steve will

“Well, I mean, it’s an interesting theory…” Tony tried weakly, but Odinson acted as though he hadn’t even spoken.
should have known better.
Steve was spending Saturday lunch in mutual awkwardness with Bruce at the Ravenclaw table when Tony sidled up to him and glanced around like they were in a Muggle spy film.
“Are you concussed—"
“But you never really believed it. Did you? Even then.” He sounds tired as he says it – tired and so certain. And suddenly, unfairly, Steve is
“Well, you wouldn’t have found it in SHIELD’s files, because I never told them, but the Winter Solider, he…he was my best friend. From the war. Bucky Barnes.”
“Y’alright?”’
“Designing my coffee-maker to look like the machines in the movie was a kind of joke with myself,” Tony admits. “Something like: coffee saves the engineer, so the engineer can save the world. What’s the quote from the movie? ‘Machines and marvels?’”
he knew what had inspired Thor’s comment, so he could stop doing that as well.
. “Anyway, I’m calling about last night.”

, and—"
“I’m not stopping you,” Rogers retorts, words clipped. It’s a tone of voice that Tony is used to hearing over comms during Rogers’ fights with HYDRA, but which Rogers tends to keep resolutely under wraps in other, non-superheroic circumstances. Great.
“Have you started that Defense essay yet? Three feet, what a nightmare,” Tony tried. Everyone liked complaining about homework, so it seemed like a safe bet. But to his horror, Rhodey gave him a baffled look and even Pepper had stopped eating her orange long enough to listen in.
Then, suddenly, I’m face-to-face with Bucky. And if anyone was gonna be able to break through that screen, it would’ve been him – the person I used to love most. But I didn’t even know him. And it made me realize that the problem was never the Avengers, or SHIELD. It was me. I lost whatever part of me used to be able to connect with other people. And I don’t think it’s coming back,” Steve finishes simply.
, exactly. Tony knew that he was not great when it came to panic, but luckily for him, billionaire geniuses with an artificially intelligent pal don’t
Before Tony can deliver a devastating retort, which was definitely on the tip of his tongue, Rogers turns to Strange.

“No, I’d be more worried if he’d been making sense,” Bruce said in a shaky attempt at his usual wry tone.
“Sir, I hesitate to interject—“
“So what do you suggest we do?” he asks her, which is the closest Tony thinks he’s ever heard Rogers come to an apology.
“I want a copy, how do I—”
They spent almost the entire rest of the afternoon in Honeydukes, arguing about whether they could ever pass Fizzing Whizbees off as a Muggle candy (no), and whether it was horrible or funny to send someone Cockroach Clusters without revealing that they were made of cockroaches (yes on all counts). By the time they made their way across the street to the Post Office, laughing and laden with sweets, they’d managed to curate a selection that Steve
“I’m not so easily impressed, Stark.” Steve raised an eyebrow, and Tony huffed.
Rogers seems to agree, because it’s with a distinct air of stoic resignation that he asks, “Used for what?”
“Uh, sure,” Steve replied, trying not to blush. “Bye, um, Bruce. See you later. In Ravenclaw Tower. Where we have…Friend Things planned.”
“That’s

“I always forget you used to be an actor,” Tony says to him, leaning his own body into Steve, to complete the tableau.
He doesn’t mean it to be a pointed statement, but Tony goes quiet on the other end of the line. It’s not as awful a silence anymore. More like thoughtful, if Steve had to name it.

,” Rogers whispers to Tony), and into a small, cluttered parlor, frowning speculatively at their hands the whole time.
And then the Asset screamed in the comms.
It was Steve's fault.
Steve felt a warm hand on his throat, feeling his pulse, and a cold one gripped his shoulder tighlty, but not tight enough to hurt.
Also, for all the phans in need of angst, I posted an angsty one shot this afternoon (so while you were sleeping if you're american), go check it out if you're interested !
They ate and they played a card game next to the chimney and then they went to bed in their separate rooms. When they learned that they would be getting twins, their parents decided to make two separate rooms for each of their babies, in order to let them know that they truly were both special to them, and different from their twin.
“Then I'll just go back to the Tower and maybe talk to him later. Tony said my place would be ready tomorrow, no ?”
‘Yes, yes I can doll, I can !’ Bucky tried to say with all his strength, in vain.
Bucky meets Natasha and Clint
Tony cleared a few tears that had been threatening to spill.
He was blind, and it should have panicked him more than that, but he didn't have the energy to care. He was exhausted, he wanted to just sleep.
“No ! Listen to me Soldier ! You do not do that ! You will die if you do that ! Leave him there ! Leave him he will be alright if you hide him !” 'There is no way to know, but I can't lose both of you.'
“Come on ! We have to run !” He shouted to his sister and he pulled her out of her room. They ran downstairs and then out by the kitchen’s door, which was on the opposite of the light.
From who I want to be
There was a short silence.
Tony tries to be nice and triggers Bucky.
Bucky had been serious when Stark had asked him to cook for him. He knew the genius had meant it as a joke, but it was the perfect occasion to finally make a new friend. He really wanted to get closer to the inventor. He could not explain it, not really. He just felt drawn to those emotional eyes and this beautiful smile and the intelligence coming out of every pore of Tony's body.
Steve had smiled back. Of course this amazing man would help him, even if curing Bucky seemed impossible. Tony was perfect.
Tony let himself fall on the ground and just sat there, watching the two supersoldiers walk out of the workshop.
The genius closed his eyes for a few seconds then, and when he reopenned them, there was anger burning inside of them, like a wildfire.
They changed the subject, then, and Tony Stark started talking about his arm, as well as all the new technologies in the future, and then he told Bucky about the super heroes, and he was half way into explaining the Hulk and Bruce Banner when the door slammed opened, revealing Captain America.
“The answer is obvious, Tony.”
I don't wanna sleep
Steve laughed, getting out of bed.
“Tony ! We need to help him ! I know you can invent the technology to erase all the brainwashing !” Steve pleaded.
If he could just die there. Forgotten by the world.
Now, let's talk about next chapter. So chapter 15 is actually chap 14, part 2, because I split chap 14 in half, because it was too long. So chap 15 happens at the same time as chap 14, mainly from Bucky's point of view (spoiler, he's with Thor and Thor is just as oblivious about the whole situation) and then Tony's, when he is calling Pepper after the whole yelling at the avengers for not taking care of steve thing. And there is Bucky, and I won't tell you why you'll have to read.
The door was kicked open and in less than a second, an utterly terrified Clint was grabbing his arms and looking him in the eyes.
“Your brainwashed Hydra assassin self killed my mom.” The brown haired man finally blurted out, but it didn't look like he was upset. He was stating facts, reasons to... What ? Stay away ? Not get attached ?
... I love it so much I'm gonna start writing tonight. Or now.
“No one went to check on him ? I mean, doctors. Or at least a nurse ?” The physicist’s legs started to shake, ready to run towards Steve’s room.
A short extract for the addicted ones who can't wait :
No response.
“What..? Bucky ?”
“Will our brother of Winter ever wake up ?” The thunder god’s tone was so sad, Bucky wished he could open his eyes and tell Thor everything would be alright.
“I will check on that, you know. You better go to Bruce for real.”
He only stopped when he was at least three streets away from the guy, and looked at his treasure. There was a funny sci-fi looking phone, and a wallet. He opened the wallet and..
Bucky knew that the billionaire was trying to come up with a believable lie, or a half truth that would get the soldier off his back.
“So, Bucky, I know you and my AI are friends now or something, so I decided to install him in your new place and oh hey yeah speaking of that I bought you that amazing apartment and.. No.”
Bruce opened his mouth but he kept going. “No. I’m not done yet. They sure as hell don’t show it, because I don’t fucking deserve it, Bruce. And what you’ve been doing for the past two months, you did it out of pity, so stop lying to me. Stop lying and tell me you care, stop saying that THEY care because that’s just ridiculous !”
Thor frowned, confused. “I call everyone of our teammates brothers. Except for Lady Natasha.”
He bumped into something and fell on his butt.
“The puppy eyes one ?” Clint seemed thoughtful for a second, and then smirked. “Why ? What was the other one ?”
Thor grabbed Bucky's shoulder and waited for the soldier to look him in the eye.
But if there’s one thing that sitting on a concrete divider halfway between Sandusky and Toledo is good for, it’s confronting how completely and utterly alone you are in the universe.
“Tony.”
“What? No! I’ve never been less in the middle of anything in my life. More of a beginning and ends kind of person, you know, just very
The six of them had retired to their abandoned Transfiguration classroom after Christmas dinner in the Great Hall, where they’d already devoured a shocking amount of food, and now, judging by the cairn of smuggled sweets currently being constructed on the classroom floor, they seemed set to consume half as much again.
When he pulled back slightly, it was to find Steve smiling that wide, goofy, wholehearted smile that Tony always secretly delighted in putting on his face.
“Remember what I said when you joined SHIELD?” Tony interrupts Steve’s prolonged state of shock. “That you were--”
“So,” Tony says brightly, the instant Rogers hangs up his phone. “Do you call me in for the dangerous missions rather than Wilson because you think I’ll care less if you die, or…“
“Gotta call you back, Cap. I’ve been invaded,” Tony announces, and lets his chair drift around to face the stranger, slow and easy to distract from the sharp flicks of his wrist that will call up his Iron Man suit.
“Oh god, things must be really bad if you’re calling me that.”
Are you in a
condition,” Tony said, like it was the biggest imposition in the world.
“Wrong superhero, sweetheart.” He pulls Steve towards him like he wants a kiss, and then, once Steve is leaning over him, flips them both with a move that Steve is pretty sure comes from Natasha. Steve, laughing, allows it. “And you didn’t have any ethical quandaries about interrupting a meeting with the UN Ambassador to text me a picture of you, fucking yourself with a dildo in this very bed, and the caption ‘This could’ve been you.’”
“Not a chance, Wolf of Wall Street,” Tony says instantly. “I’ve got sixteen dollars and thirteen cents sunk into this venture. I’m entitled to an investor’s report.”
Tony manages to wait a full three seconds after he hangs up with Pepper to say: “Well. Fuck.”
can hear.
Their path opened suddenly into a small clearing about twenty feet across, ringed by pine trees. Moonlight reflected off the snow that blanketed the ground, giving it a silvery glow. It would be a big enough space for the wards that Tony and Bruce needed to set. And it might be superstitious of him (not to mention a foolish feeling to indulge in the middle of the Forbidden Forest), but Tony felt oddly safe here, surrounded by the same kind of tree that had produced his own wand.
“Actually, JARVIS found it on ebay,” Tony quips. Rogers drops his eyes with a sigh.
Tony guides Steve through a few easy, swaying turns. Luckily, it’s Tony’s left hand that’s holding Steve’s right, which puts him in the correct position to lead a dance. Steve gets the hang of it as quickly as Tony knew he would, but he’s looking at Tony with such delight, like Tony’s managed some sort of miracle, rather than just reminded Steve that he already knows how to walk in time to music.
And the Soldier had complied, but not before shooting her a confused look. Surely because the pain he had been expecting for around half an hour had never come.
“I thought he would be okay.. The supersoldier serum...”
Steve opened his eyes slowly.
------------------------------------------------------------
“The mission is on the ground.” Informed the Winter Soldier. “Waiting for orders.”
Oh god, he was too far gone. There was no going back. He was inlove.
It's named : "(Don't) Hold Me"
“Hm, yes. Please.”
“What happened ?”
“I fucked up, Bucky. Messed up so bad. I don’t think I can fix this. Bruce won’t even let me k-kill myself. I need to end this, Bucky. I can’t take it anymore. Even you don’t want me in your life anymore. How can I ever live with that ? What purpose do I have ? That of a soldier ? There are so many enhanced people out there now, no one needs Captain America anymore.”
“And what if they're from Brooklyn, and I don't know, named... Steve Rogers.”
So hum, I'm going to assume you liked that chapter more than the last one. ^^
“I found an interesting one in Sokovia. The name is Pietro Maximoff. Five years old. Twin sister is worthless. I recommend killing her and the parents, and then get the boy.”
Suddenly he could feel the strong hand holding his left metal one, and another, smaller hand grabbing his right one, and pressing.
---------------
The smiles disappeared, replaced by hurt expressions.
“Well excuse me, sir” Ross had mocked him, "but I don't think that's any of your business."
The fic will most likely be named "Two can keep a secret if one of them is dead"
Yeah that guy is amazing. He doesn't look like it, but he will be there when you need him, and defend you if you can't do it for yourself. He's really sweet in his own way and omg he's so funny. He'd made me laugh if I was feeling suicidal. Oh, wait, that happened a few months ago XD see ? he's amazing.
“What. What ? I never wanted you to do this ! What the fuck Steve !”
“By the way, anyone knows why they broke up ? Is it because of Bucky ?” Questionned Bruce, and it seemed like he already had his opinion on that.
“You look tired. And sad.” Stated the man. “You need to eat and sleep.”
“Yeah ?” Replied Hawkeye.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Sir, I believe Captain Rogers is not feeling well” JARVIS informed Tony as he shot robot after robot. Those things were weak, it was ridiculous, however there was so many of them that they still constitued a huge threat for the city.
--------------------------------------------
-------------------------------
Slowly, the genius' eyes became more aware of the real world, and his breathing returned to normal.
Tony could see his science bro was concerned, really, he could, but he also couldn't tell the truth. No one wanted Hulk to run after Steve through the tower, and then kill Captain America, because that was how it would end if Tony told the truth. So he settled for a lie.
I know, just that title tells that it's going to be awfully painful.
“He… He tried to kill himself.”
------------------------------------------------------------
See ? Bucky would never, ever have accept... Wait.
Bucky had a warm plate in his hands, and Jarvis was leading him to... Wait, if they were going to the workshop, they would be going down, but they were going up right now.
Bucky was terrified of what the government would decide to do with him. Execute him ? Throw him in a maximum security prison ? Torture him for information ? Experiment on him ? Bucky shivered. The last one was the worst.
“You don’t look like he’s fine. You look worried. Don’t bullshit me Bruce, I’d rather you tell me the truth, even if it’s not a easy one to hear.”
When they arrived at the battlefield, that was once again right at the foot of the Avengers Tower, the Asset turned to Clint and Natasha.
He heard a young voice coming from inside, but no one went to open him, so he knocked again after a while.
‘Most people have it worse than you ever will.’
Bucky's grey eyes darkened as he went quiet for a few seconds, staring at the white wall in front of him. He looked troubled and confused.
-Hawkeye_girl
Some of the wires attached to his body fell with the movements.
“Are you even listening to me ? Open your eyes.” Demanded the usually gentle scientist.
His heart felt numb. Like it had died.
But the grey eyed man couldn’t. Hell, he couldn’t even remember how he got there, in a coma, stuck in the darkness with for only company his own thoughts and the occasional sounds occurring in the room.
When they entered their home, they were greeted by the warm smell of their diner and the welcoming smile of their mother, who asked them about their day. Pietro was very happy to tell her everything about the games in the parc and school, but he chose not to tell her about the policeman. He wasn’t sure if he had done something wrong or not, and he didn’t want to risk not having dessert.
So.. I'm gonna say it again : I'm sorry. You might be crying right now, it's okay, eat chocolate, cuddle something or someone, and remember : happy ending.. Or you might be furious. Then breathe with me. Deep breaths. Right. 1, you hold it, 2... Do it again. And again. Feeling better ? It's still too much pain ? I know, I know. Chapter 9 is all fluffy though. Well, almost fluffy. I mean, better than chapter 8, and there is a lot of progress on the Bucky/Tony side. And Bucky meets Thor. That's cool, isn't it ? Yeah, so cool x)
Bucky was surprised. He was preparing for a flow of words from the genius, not just... Was that extreme shyness ?
The second time Tony tried to talk to Bucky, it was out of concern. He wanted to check that the arm was working well. So he told JARVIS to wait for Bucky to be alone before asking him to come down to the workshop.
“We're in 1945. Right ? Or was I in a coma ? Is it the 50s now already ?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky’s hair was as dark as ever. It looked soft. Steve hesitated, then carefully extended a hand and started caressing it.
“I'd eat them” Replied Tony, walking around the kitchen and choosing a chair away from Bucky.
Bucky didn't say another word, letting Steve guide him to their room.
Then a loud, cruel voice at the back of his head reminded him that he wasn't allowed near Bucky, and it brought him back to reality harshly.
Bucky had trouble hiding his blush. They were talking about him. He didn't like being the center of attention, but at the same time it meant they cared.
The bed was empty, but there was a stain of blood in the middle of it. Bruce would have worried if he hadn’t seen it earlier during his first visit.
Steve put a hand on his shoulder and smiled gently at him.
He was abruptly thrown to the ground and vaguely heard a body fall next to him, just as the shootings stopped. Was Bucky okay ? Were they safe ? Steve could faintly hear voices shouting. There were hands on him, removing his suit, ripping it. He desperatly tried to open his eyes, to see what was happening, to check on Bucky, on Tony... Oh god was Tony alright ? He opened his mouth, but couldn't hear himself talk. He felt himself drift, and then, nothing.
He remembered kissing those lips. He knew their taste by heart, knew how soft they were, how good they looked when Bucky smiled that teasing smile of his.
They hated him. Steve could see it on their face, in their eyes.
Chapter 16 : Cold as Ice (you make me freeze in fear)
Only after, when I'll have the time, will I write and publish the first AU.
Tony stood there for a few seconds, and then left the room, stopping at the door to say "I love you"
“The others ?”
A special thanks to DreadfulWitch (I love your profil pic) and SilverNovaHeals (you don't have any profil pic...) for being the first ones to comment on my fanfic !
“I'm not going to hurt you” Let out Bucky, voice pained.
“Captain Rogers seems to have fainted and is on the ground. The Winter Soldier is killing any robot that comes near them.”
“No” Replied Natasha. “I'll check on him.” She added, but her tone was colder.
On a happier and less serious note, I had a Natasha centered fic idea. So expect to see one show up on my profile in a few days, because omg, I love my own idea (thank gosh, how could I ever write it otherwise)
(See the end of the chapter for
The spies agreed.
Steve ran to the gym.
He was the bully.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
“The mission is on the ground.” Informed the Winter Soldier. “Waiting for orders.”
He looked back at the note and sighed.
Oh which reminds me...
We're sharing music and arguing about the best way of going to sleep (If it's later than 2am where you are right now, GO TO SLEEP. READ LATER.) and I'm for the tricking the brain into thinking you're simply closing your eyes for a moment. If I actually decide to go to sleep I won't sleep all night.
“Tell him to kill the robots. He is not with Hydra anymore and he knows it.”
It smelled like his childhood.
“I am... What ?” He demanded.
“You're welcome” replied Bucky under his breath.
/The Winter Soldier. Let me take control. They need us to fight with them, and I am a better fighter than you will ever be./
“Hey Winter”
Don't hesitate to say what you think in the comments. As you can see, I take your opinion into consideration, but do not expect me to do anything I don't want to do. I am the master of my own fanfiction, last I've heard. King (well Queen but oh gowd I wanna know what it feels like to be a boy) of my own little universes.
It had been a little more than two months since the events in the hospital, and since then the physicist had decided that they would at least take one meal a day together, just the two of them.
/Let me take control/ It said, but there was no threat, no danger in its tone.
Steve sighed.
Something went cold in his chest. In his head, a voice that sounded just like his own spoke in russian.
“I'm Bucky” He added as an afterthought.
Bucky looked taken aback by the question, but he answered as a second.
-Zeyra
So please don't hate on me, I'm just a beginner at all this, and it's so hard to write angsty polyamory fics omg. This chapter however doesn't have much angst, it's mainly Bucky making two spy-friends, and it's cute.
When Tony didn't answer, Steve added in a dark, threatenning tone.
Steve is feeling miserable and the author makes an important announcement
“Then why aren't your knuckles at least a little damaged ?” Asked Bucky, trying too sound genuinely confused, but it came out sounding like an accusation. He turned to the inventor to see his reaction.
Anyway, chapter 17... Well I haven't thought much about it yet. What about Clint's side of events and then it goes even after Steve... IM NOT SPOILING.  AH AH IS HE DEAD IS HE ALIVE NO ONE KNOWS BUT ME AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH *cough* hum.
I'd like to tell you all that Bruce is going to keep his promise and not tell anything to anyone :D Now you can try and imagine what I prepared for them next x)
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve looked at his skinny hands. They reminded him of his time before the serum.
Everyone but the redhead felt way too uncomfortable with giving the Winter Soldier orders, so she had decided that she would be her 'handler' as long as he struggled with free will. She hoped he would understand soon that he can make his own choices as long as they don't hurt anyone.
Bruce frowned.
“I am afraid Captain Rogers cannot talk for the moment. He needs water, mister Barton.”
“JARVIS, what's happening ?”
“Get. Out.” The blond supersoldier had growled between gritted teeth as soon as he had noticed Tony.
For a few seconds, the genius didn't answer, and they just stared at each other while tension slowly filled the air.
He could hear people around him, and the steady, regular beeps of his heart monitor. Sometimes he drifted off and lost himself in his thoughts, seeing flashes of his past and of what could be. Time seemed to fly as if in a different dimension, both so fast and so slow.
He kept silent.
“Steve, calm down. They're not ours.” Had requested Phil in a calm but sad voice.
Barton laughed. “Oh yeah she is. Awesome isn't it ?”
'It would be a good death' he decided, and closed his eyes again.
Natasha stared at him, reading him and his lie.
And in order to get money, he had to steal it.
“No, I’m not here to put you into jail, kid, I’m here because… Because… Uh.” The man eventually fell silent.
“Bruce, you should step back, Clint-”
Blood on Captain America cards. A black mask thrown on the ground. Cold grey eyes.
The kids would always sit in front of it and ask questions about the weird long words the reporters used. Pepper would always explain everything to them before Steve could even open his mouth, or a dictionary, because even he didn’t know as many words as Pepper.
Tony froze.
“I can't do this” He murmured to himself, feeling overwhelmed.
Bucky turned an unfocused gaze on him, and said something in russian. "Ready to comply" Translated the god's All Speak.
--------------------------------------------
“Rogers.” Answered the archer in a cold tone.
They both froze, looking each other in the eye, one terrified and fragile, the other surprised and hurt.
here is an extract of chapter 19 : (you even get to have a very long one because you waited so long and I am so sorry)
Then another.
“Give the baby his fucking water Nat.” The woman frowned.
Bucky walked into the workshop, but didn't come near Tony. He felt like the genius didn't want him too close. He decided to look at all the robots and technology in the room, trying to look like this situation wasn't stressing him out.
This chapter is not much, I tried to add some humour because heavy angst if very cool and addictive but you gotta breathe to go even deeper x)
But how could he ever believe that the genius was not pretending when the man had only became friendly when he had understood that Steve would die if he didn’t ?
If you read the song lyrics at the beginning and end of this chapter, you will notice that I was in a big Cigarettes After Sex mood tonight ^^"
“But after that night at the bar—” Tony blurts out. There’s another abrupt silence on the other end of the phone. It’s abundantly clear that this was something Tony had never meant to discuss. Steve can picture the exact look on his face, could draw it from memory: frustration in the press of Tony’s lips together, anxiety in the crinkles of his eyes. Just the smallest of details, really, but clear enough to someone who’s learned to look for them.
anyone, so who really
He immediately busies himself with his phone so that Tony doesn’t have the opportunity to push it. Although Tony isn’t actually sure whether he would have pushed on this or not. Granted, attacking a problem until it’s solved
“It’s okay,” Tony says instantly. “It’s just…y’know. The armor. It’s kind of personal.”
“I could barely sleep an hour at a time,” Tony continues. “Part of it was anxiety – and you’ve already seen that particular symptom in action – but when I first got back, I couldn’t sleep with a blanket, or even clothes sometimes, because in my dreams they’d turn into hands. Holding me down. But the worst nightmares were the ones that featured someone I cared about. Someone who died.”
– in an emergency,” Tony pants.
, what did you think I was doing? Looking out the window?”
“Exactly, I’m basically the Jackson Pollock of international politics. So don’t worry about it, okay? You’re an Avenger. First, foremost, forever. A SHIELD badge won’t change that.”
Tony froze. In truth, he’d been brewing without really thinking about it. He’d taught himself to brew this potion in third year as part of a prank, and then he’d gotten curious enough to start tweaking the recipe. When Tony looked down at their cauldron with a growing sense of dread, it was to find that their potion was a perfect shade of sunshine yellow. He shot a quick, panicked glance over at Bruce and Rogers’ bench. Their potion was more of a bright lemon, which was much more plausible for someone’s first try at brewing it.
surprising to suddenly be in a different body than the one you were used to, but Steve remembered puberty, so the feeling wasn’t completely without precedent. By the time he’d tried to stand up and nearly fallen over again, and taken a few tentative steps, and then
Tony tries to work out what he might’ve done recently to make Pepper not just pissed at him, but
Tony’s head shot up, startled, and before he looked away again, Steve caught a glimpse of a pale face with dark circles under its eyes. Steve watched Tony search the room before coming to the conclusion that Steve already knew: there were no other available partners, and their professor was just about to launch into the lesson.
For a genius, Tony realizes, he can sometimes make
him for that?”
. Tony tried to make himself even more unobtrusive, which was no small feat for someone who glowed in the dark.
It shouldn’t have mattered to him. He was here now. He had been since the middle of fourth year. And clearly McGonagall thought he fit in well enough, since she’d chosen him to be one of the Gryffindor Prefects just a half-year after he’d arrived, and then Head Boy after that.
“Of course, Sir. Would this file be titled
Tony watches their hands expectantly for a beat, but when he tries to pull them apart, they remain resolutely clasped together.
Bruce flushed and stuffed another Cauldron Cake into his mouth.
He was halfway to Charms before he remembered that Gryffindors had Herbology first thing, so then of course he’d been late to that as well.
“Aw, they’re not so bad,” Tony said cheerfully, and Bruce stared at him in such shock that he tripped over an exposed tree root and went sprawling into a snowdrift. And then proceeded to just lie there.
for this,” Bruce complained. He blew on his hands – quite theatrically, in Tony’s opinion, since the first thing Bruce had done upon leaving the castle was cast a Warming Charm on himself. But five hours ago, Bruce had been flatly refusing to come at all, so Tony was willing to grade his level of dramatic whining on a curve.
“Buy you a Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks?” he suggested, and hoped he didn’t sound as desperate as he felt for Tony to agree.
super rich, remember?” And Steve can tell, even with the suit dampening most of Tony’s subtler body language cues, that he’s practically vibrating with the anticipation of testing out the handholds. “The bike’ll be back in New York by tomorrow. So can we go, or what? I wanna hit up Philly before this cheesesteak place closes for the night.”

“That’s it, I’m leaving.” Strange only makes it a few steps before he’s whirling back around. “And for the record, assholes?

It seems like the only thing my alternate universe counterpart wanted was to force you both to spend time with one another. I take no responsibility for
“You know,” Tony realizes, hours later when they’re both getting ready for bed again. “Now that we have the nanoparticles up and running, it wouldn’t be that hard to program a few of them to stitch up the seam of your suit, if you wanted to rip the arm so that you could finally take it off.”
“The purpose of this spell is to facilitate understanding. Sometimes it requires the participants to share something true; sometimes it requires them to work together to solve a problem; sometimes it’s set to release after a certain period of time. Only the original caster can say for certain.”
Steve shrugged. “I mean, it’s in the rules.”
It’s an absurd strategy, to pretend he doesn’t know who Steve is. The entire performance is absurd. It would almost be funny, except that Damian’s fingers are still digging into Tony’s arm. He takes a deep breath and tries to ignore them.
There’s a palpable silence from the other side of the shower curtain, no longer quite as companionable as it had been.
“It’s not dangerous.” Another pause. “No, really, I
“And I know you missed me,” Tony adds, squinting his eyes open to slant a teasing look at Steve.
“I still say there must be

– a series of movies that he'd last seen fifteen years ago – just because Clint had mentioned offhand that he liked the special effects.
“Listen,” Tony tells Rogers distractedly, mind already consumed the problem of what spell-breaking method they should try next, after the icebreaker list was such a flop. “This whole spell thing? It’s a problem with a solution. We just have to find it. I happen to be quite good at problem-solving – dunno if you’ve heard that about me – but I’m at my best with metal in my hands. Do you mind if I, y’know, tinker a little? I figure we’d want ‘at my best’ on this one, but if it bothers you, I don’t have to pull out the whole…” He gestures at the crates of assorted electronic equipment that Happy had obligingly lugged up Rogers’ stairs.

more complicated when the participants are also holding hands, and had silently agreed never to discuss it again. They’d also discarded participating in a scavenger hunt (even though JARVIS assured them that he would construct one “appropriate to the circumstances,” and honestly, Tony hopes to never learn what that means), building a structure out of toothpicks and marshmallows (Tony was all for it, but Rogers informed him with some relief that he didn’t have any marshmallows in his apartment), and anything involving singing. Tony is willing to take the chance that karaoke isn’t the key to unlocking this spell, and if it is, well, there are worse things than being stuck with Rogers for the rest of their lives. Like having to live with the memory of Captain America singing “Sweet Caroline.”

touching Steve. So he squeezes the hand that he’s holding, and Steve squeezes his back. Just a light acknowledging pressure.
“Well, Ilvermorny’s in Massachusetts,” Rogers says. There's a beat, and then his eyes widen hilariously. “I mean—"
“So this seems like the appropriate moment to tell you that I don’t know how to dance,” Steve mutters into his ear. His mouth has gone pinched at the corners, and his blue eyes are searching Tony’s face almost anxiously, like he’s bracing for either teasing or disapproval.
“I’m observant. Stark also moves like Steve, by the way.”
“I- I don’t,” Rogers stammers, and even in the dark, Tony can tell he’s blushing. “I mean—“
Tony started to wander down the corridor, chattering incomprehensibly about Gamp’s Law, without seeming to notice that he’d left the contents of his school satchel scattered across the ground. Steve gathered up their things with a flick of his wand and caught up to Tony easily.

, are you serious?” Pepper practically growls.
He knows his reaction is bordering on the ridiculous. Hadn’t he and Yinsin built the armor together in the first place? Tony’s never forgotten – never let himself forget – that the first Iron Man was a collaboration. So why is he finding it so impossible to agree to another one?
“I did warn you,” Natasha was saying, but almost like she regretted being right.

“Made a lot of progress on the spell so far, have you?” Pepper asks, voice dry as the desert. “Feeling utterly, 100% certain that it’ll be solved by Friday?”
“I’m not,” Tony retorts stupidly, and grabs for his half-full coffee cup in the hopes that the motion will distract them both, until he realizes that his hand is shaking too much for him to be able to drink from it. Perfect.

incapable of connecting with people. I mean, look at what we’re doing right now!”
Steve watched the easy familiarity with which Ellen hugged an unfamiliar girl, and decided abruptly that they didn’t need him here to supervise. They’d find their way back to their own Common Rooms. Or maybe they wouldn’t, but regardless, Steve didn’t have to stay here and find out for sure. He backed out of the corridor and veered instead toward the moving staircase that would deposit him directly beside the main doors (eventually, and with a little coaxing, but it

no. Get me outta here,” Steve blurts out, and Tony’s grin returns full-force.
He’d managed to force himself to forget that their hands are touching, but suddenly it’s all he can think about. Especially now that the apartment is so quiet around him. The only noise is the intermittent whisper of one of Rogers’ pages turning. It feels as intrusive as an alarm. And in the silent gaps between pages, Tony’s own mind starts to spiral louder and louder.
? Oh.”
“So?” Rogers’ head shot up and he gave Tony an incredulous look. “
Tony takes a deep breath, and can’t help but let out a bit of a laugh on the exhale. “It’s fine, JARVIS. Even the best of intentions are no match for Pepper. You’d better put her through.”
“On the other hand, I’m feeling merciful, spirit of the holidays and all that.” Tony made a gesture somewhere between a bow and the sign of the cross. “I hereby grant you clemency.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bucky was sitting against the opposite wall, looking straight ahead, but not seeing anything. It was the same look. Thor wondered what happened but decided that it wasn't the moment. He needed to help them.
He gently cupped Bucky’s cheek, and kissed his forehead slowly, closing his eyes. Taking his time. A tear rolled down his cheek.
A smile that screamed “You are wanted ! He wants you ! He loves you !”
Tony rolled his eyes and turned to Bucky. The man was holding a steaming plate of what looked like rice with vegetables and... Was that chicken ? Tony loved chicken.
There were robot killers everywhere, in the streets, in the sky, both in and on the buildings. He couldn't quite figure out what was happening. Someone told him to go fight somewhere, he went there. Everything was so confused. He hit robot after robot, but it didn't make any sense.  His vision kept going black for a few seconds and then coming back to almost normal, only to do it again.
Wait, would you guys enjoy that ? The chapters getting longer I mean. (It's not like you have a choice but I can cut them if it really bothers you)
Howard.
And on top of that, the only week on which Steve had been called on a mission he could not refuse, also happened to be the week that Bucky decided to wake up.
As his eyes roamed the room, they fell upon a metallic box. The blond went to open it and found several scalpels.
“Hey, sorry about yelling at you... Nope.”
Oh, how Steve missed his innocence. As tears troubled his vision, the memories started to blend together, sending Steve to a place somewhere between the past and the recent memories, but he could no longer tell the difference. He was lost.
I don't think anyone will be in a relationship with anyone, just natasha&avengers friendship.
Thor chose that moment to enter the room.
It killed Steve to say all that. But it was necessary. It was for Bucky's safety, because Tony must hate him : Bucky stole his parents, and his lover. Who wouldn't hate someone who did that to them ? Tony was a threat to Bucky. Tony wasn't even getting that hurt, because Tony never loved him, he loved Captain America. Captain America was a prize for the inventor, the hero from the past that Howard surely never stopped telling his son about. Tony would never have loved him back then when he was just a kid from Brooklyn.
“All this for a game of mario kart.”
“Hold that for me would you ?” Tony and his daddy were in the workshop. Tony was not allowed in if he wasn't useful, so he offered to hold things and clean things and do all that. When he had nothing to do, he could observe and learn, as long as he stayed away and he didn't make a sound.
When the dust settled on the battlefield that had become the streets, the Winter Soldier approached the rest of the Avengers, who were gathered around one of the dead robots while Tony Stark, who had stepped out of the Ironman suit, analysed it. The Asset was carrying the target, bridal style. His expression was as blank as usual, but his gaze kept shifting between the avengers, the dead robots, and Steve's unconscious body in his arms.
Clint clapped him on the back, gently pushing him towards the exit. “Yes you are. He made you an arm, no ? He only does that for people he cares about.”
“Winter Soldier, can you hear me ? All of the robots are coming to you and Cap. Now I don't know how badly injured Cap is, but if he can't run, do not risk carrying him to safety, do you hear me ? You hide him under the rubble, you run towards safety, and we hope the robots get distracted by you. Do not try to carry him.”
Tony and Steve loved each other. There was no questions about it. Even when they disagreed on things, even when they woke the other up in the middle of the night with their nightmares, even when they had to battle their demons, even when they lost. Through it all, there was always one constant : Steve and Tony loved each other.
. Like an
“So that’s the other thing I got you for Christmas,” Steve mumbled breathlessly. “If you want it.”
“Fine, whatever! Ugh, I’m already totally off-script…” Strange mutters to himself, before taking a deep breath and fixing Tony with a piercing stare. “Tony Stark,” he intones, “the universe is in danger from a powerful Titan named Thanos. I have taken a great risk by traveling back in time to warn you, but you need to know – the only future in which you have a

“Well, first thing, we should probably contact everyone on Fury’s old list of potential Avengers,” Steve muses. “Strange seemed pretty convinced that the Avengers would be the key to beating Thanos. I think Romanoff and Barton are still working for SHIELD. Sam’ll definitely know—”
“Well, I have my chair, and I can be quiet while you work.”
“Don’t be cute. No, this is about Steve’s Christmas present. The two of us are gonna figure it out once and for all.”
“Huh,” said Natasha. She popped a Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Bean into her mouth, and then leaned back on her hands as though settling in.
It was shockingly un-terrible to patrol the castle with Steve.

“Tony,” Steve repeats (
One hour earlier, Steve Rogers had been nowhere near the Forbidden Forest, with no idea that a miscast and highly illegal spell was about to change his life.
he wanted to lie for them, Rogers just lifted his head and stared directly at Tony’s stupidly gaping face, and said with the kind of stubborn determination that had probably gotten him sorted Gryffindor: “Perfectly sure.”
“Against…paying for lunch?” Tony finally asks, a bit strangled. He leans forward and puts his elbows on his knees, and Steve finds himself leaning forward to meet him.
“D’you want, uh, a blanket or something?” Steve asks. “Will you be cold?”
If Tony can’t sleep tonight, he won’t be able to do either of those things, will he? He’ll just have to lie there quietly and let his mind tear itself apart.
He was just congratulating himself on remembering to use sneezewort in his Befuddlement Draught, as their textbook advised, instead of the trickier but more potent arrowroot, when Romanoff leaned over and said in a low undertone: “So,
said you’d forgotten that! You said the potion caused amnesia!”
“That’s ridiculous,” Tony snapped, and Steve wilted. Every other option was significantly more horrible than this one. “None of this was

“It’s just…how can you, of all people, be advising me to work for SHIELD?” Steve rests the phone against his shoulder and grabs for his drawing pad a little absently. He always finds it easier to pay attention to phone calls when his hands are occupied.
“Steve disapproves of mayhem,” Tony explained primly, although his eyes held a teasing glint when they slid over to meet Steve’s next to him.
Tony squints and tilts his head. The man actually looks vaguely familiar. Hm. Tony doesn’t think he’s a former SHIELD agent, and the man doesn’t
Steve blinks at him. There’s water running down his face, clinging spikily to the ends of his hair, to his eyelashes, dripping off his chin, and down his chest, and – and Tony is

like the kind of thing a house with an address like ‘177A Bleecker Street’ would have,” Tony argues. “It’s like the world’s most annoying Sherlock Holmes cosplay.”
“You’re also Rogers, yeah. Sorry.” A strange expression flashed across Rogers’ face, but Tony was too busy working himself into a panic to parse it.
“Yes, good job, you did it, you saved the day.” Tony pet Dummy on the top of his claw, and narrowly ducked a fire extinguisher to the face. “Okay, it’s definitely time to put that down now, the fire is gone – oh, why the

the ones that Tony was expecting to hear.
“How could you possibly know that?”
They both turn to regard Steve and Bruce on the bench behind them. Steve had a slight frown of concentration on his face as he patiently chopped his lovage into tiny, identical pieces. Tony had to give it to Romanoff – literally
“Like I said, I can’t actually let go. I think our hands might be…um…magically stuck together,” Rogers mumbles, and really, there’s nothing for Tony to do in response to a statement like that, except to topple over onto the floor and wait for death to take him.
Tony glanced from the spreadsheet – which was actually now
It didn’t feel as gratifying as it usually does. In fact, it felt a lot like falling out that window, but this time, without the suit to catch him.
“The hotel pay-per-view is never a good deal, don’t buy anything out of a stranger’s car, and always wear a condom,” Tony says promptly.

And then Rogers heaves the kind of long-suffering sigh that would be more appropriate coming from a teenager. Tony stares at him in shock. He can barely believe Rogers had acted like a teenager when he
They had not come that way. The wreaths had, in fact, been fabricated in Tony’s lab. And it’s possible that, in addition to the gift things and the Steve thing, Tony was also not amazing at wreath-fabrication.
Steve’s face went from wonderstruck to nauseated so quickly that Tony thought they were under attack.
Tony presented the Post Office to Steve with a dramatic flourish like he’d built it himself, and then bounced on his feet, clearly waiting for Steve’s approval.

“Barton. Seventh-year Slytherin. I know you know him. He’s on the Slytherin Quidditch team. You once got a penalty for unsportsmanlike behavior that time he managed to hit the Snitch with a Bludger.”
The cars that thunder past are starting to flick on their lights, and Steve idly counts them, just for something to do. And then he realizes with an odd jolt that it might be the first truly
by another person, all Tony feels now is…sleepy. It’s nice, actually, to feel the warm pressure of Steve’s hand there. Safe. It’s the kind of touch that feels like it could shield him from danger, rather than itself be a threat. And Tony has no illusions that his brain will react the same way next time (not that there’ll be a next time when it comes to cuddling with Steve! It’s a
Tony wonders idly what Rogers’ untidy apartment might say about his brain, but he’s learned his lesson about becoming too curious about Rogers’ bizarre motivations for doing things.
“Well, uh, goodnight,” Tony offers. Rogers doesn’t answer. Tony glances over to find him staring up at the ceiling with his lips pressed together into a thin line. Tony wonders if Rogers is maybe still pissed about Tony accidentally strangling them both with the top sheet.
Tony, meanwhile, has found the door he’s looking for, partially concealed in a hallway off the main ballroom. He pulls Steve into the small supply closet before flipping on an overhead light. They just barely fit pressed up against each other in the tight space.
,” Tony vows, and that’s when Steve hears the repulsors in the distance.
“Sam?”
“To play scientist with you, Bumblebee? Never.”
“Nope.” Clint gave him a wide grin and leaned back on Tony’s bench with the distressing crunch of something delicate being sat on. “Except that in this particular circumstance, what I actually need is a favor.”
Now, they both stare at the pile of things Happy has left in Rogers’ foyer with distinct dismay.
Which Tony is then informed in no uncertain terms is “irrelevant to the issue at hand” and also “unsupportive of his employees’ interests.”
They slide into the back of the limo, and a tightness Steve hadn’t even noticed around Tony’s eyes relaxes in the near-solitude. He’s lost his heart-stopping smile and traded it for a subtler, crooked quirk of his lips that has the opposite effect on Steve’s heart: sending it shuddering in rapid, uneven patterns against his breastbone. Tony leans his head back against the seat rest with a sigh, and Steve almost forgets about the scene in the restaurant, distracted as he is by the line of Tony’s throat against the car’s dark leather.

Not to mention, he still did not have a gift for Steve, and he had approximately twenty minutes before that fact was revealed to everyone, including Steve, who had probably gotten him something thoughtful and perfect for Christmas, because Steve himself was thoughtful and also perfect, so it stood to reason.

He flushed – which was another thing Tony could have lived his whole life without seeing on his own face – and fixed his eyes on the snowy ground. “I just mean…you wouldn’t just get detention. She’d probably expel you or something.”
And then Tony leans over the seats to tug Steve into the car by the hem of his shirt. So, probably real.

to get them both caught.
“I always knew your hero complex would be our downfall.”
Tony squinted through the flurries of snow that had been falling steadily since lunchtime, trying to judge the distance to Hagrid’s hut. He didn’t want to accidentally stumble upon it in the snow and risk being caught outside after curfew, even if the worst Hagrid was likely to do was feed them rock cakes before sending them back to bed.
. He’d barely even looked in a mirror this whole time, worried that he would be inadvertently disrespectful to Tony’s body in some way.
“No, no,” Steve insists, struggling gamely to his feet. He pulls open the car door and stops, swaying slightly, at the sight of Tony sprawled in the back seat. He’s pale and messy-haired and wearing a pair of soft, gray sweatpants that Steve has never seen him wear before. Steve doesn’t

Tony has racked up a comfortable number of points by the time they hit their first true snag. Luckily, until Damian Grey corners them (the potted plants in this ballroom are a real hazard!), most people they encounter seem to believe that their continually clasped hands are cute. Damian Grey, unfortunately, has never seen a cute thing in his life that he didn’t want to immediately destroy and sell for parts.
“No,” agreed Natasha. “But I think you’ll find that Tony did.”
Steve brushes his lips right up against Tony’s ear, and Tony’s breath catches.
“Ebay my ass, Tony. I knew I recognized this. You really designed your

The thought was echoing through his head like a broken record.
“There is a giant octopus-like being causing level 8 damage in Brooklyn. The robots from the previous two attacks are back but have been enhanced : they are faster and stronger. I suggest not to destroy them at short distance, as they explode after deactivation.”
Steve wished he could just die already.
Hey guys ! There are already 256 hits and 18 kudos on this fic as I am writing this, and this is so crazy ! So I decided to post a new chapter to thank you.
Bucky nodded. “Why do you keep calling me brother ?”
It made Steve shiver. Anything relating to coldness, even behaviors, made him feel like he had felt for so many years. Asleep, but not quite. Dead, but only almost. Barely alive. Barely conscious. Just enough to want to scream. Not enough to feel time. Not enough to know if an eternity or a second had passed.
.AU3 : Steve stays dead, winteriron ending with Bucky dealing with Tony's issues after the trauma Steve left behind.
The genius stared at him for a long moment, opening and closing his mouth several times.
“Maybe... No.” Started Clint.
Steve laughed bitterly. “They sure as hell don’t show it.”
“You didn't answer my question. Who are you ?” The soldier insisted. Something was wrong. He could feel it. Something was so, so very wrong here.
Oh, how much Steve had missed this voice.
Bucky resumed cutting the vegetables. He had decided to prepare something with rice, chicken, and some vegetables for Tony, he really hoped the genius would like it.
‘Is Tony alright ?’ The echo of his voice asked.
“I take it we're still together then, punk ?” Bucke's tone was playful, but Steve could see the worry in his lover's eyes.
He always had a huge crush on this celebrity, but he hadn’t thought about Stark since he was sent to the Shield Orphanage.
“What did you just call me ?”
“Brother of Winter, are you okay ?” Thor questionned, concerned.
When he arrived in the corridor where Steve’s and Bucky’s room were, he almost ran into Natasha, who instantly grabbed his arms.
However Bucky felt like he should have a talk with Steve soon. At least to talk about that whole Tony thing. Because if the problem was that Steve had felt like he had to choose... Well, when Bucky caught the way the inventor sometimes looked at him, he thought that it might just not have to be this way. Especially when Bucky knew very well that he was looking at the genius with the exact same “I'm pretty sure I'm inlove with you but I'm afraid to even think it” eyes.
“Who’s it then ? Tony ? Steve ? I hope you’re not worried about Natasha ‘cause that’d be ridiculous, you know that mission Fury sent her on is like a vacation for her. She’s supposed to come back in like, half an hour anyway.”
Machines were beeping around him. He didn't know why there were so many machines in a hospital... Or at least he supposed he was in a hospital, and ouch, this was too much reflexion for his head.
‘Fix your mess’ Bruce’s voice whispered into his ear.
He started struggling, attempting to swim back to the surface, but there were no up, no down anymore. Just water. Everywhere. And the dead bodies of everyone he ever loved. Their eyes followed him.
“Is Tony alright ?” The blond asked in a small voice.
--------------------------------------------
“I’m sorry” He murmured.
He quickly made the flower crowns and put a few petals on their clothes and around them, before putting the crowns on their heads.
Bucky then glanced at his right, and there, sitting next to his bed but turning his back on him, sat Howard Stark. Of course. The man must have invented some sort of new prosthetic made of metal. He was a genius. But something looked.. Wrong. The man next to him was Howard... But not quite. Was it an hallucination ?
“Who ?” Thor's voice was suddenly stronger, protective.
The man let him go instantly and Tony tried to pretend he didn't see the flash of hurt that passed on Barnes' face.
“Tony, are you okay ? What happened ? Natasha just called me to tell me you had a panic attack.”
Okay so today was a total mistake. I mean I got scolded by almost every teacher, coz I draw A LOT in class and these days my anxiety is worse so I draw even more, really you should see my copybooks, they're covered in drawings and colors. Mostly random stuff, sometimes Avengers, sometimes Bucky, sometimes quotes that I wanna include in the Hardest Choice.
“What ? Why ? Of course I am.”
A movie night, and everyone cuddling each other with a small content smile.
“We have been crowned my friend ! Princes of flowers !” Laughed the god.
Hey everyone... I'm so sorry this is not the usual hour, I'm sorry for those who wondered where the hell the chapter was... Well the chapter was being a brat, not wanting to let me finish with it in time. I had more ideas, and i wanted to build the tension the right way, and it was supposed to be even longer but I guess you'll get the rest in chapter 17 tomorow. Oh god writing this was so hard but also so fucking cool. I can't wait til they fight something more interesting than robots. x) (aka next fight)
“Eat.” Bruce ordered, putting a plate of pasta in front of Steve.
“Brother !” Shouted a familiar voice.
Steve would have found it really nice and touching. Really, he would have. If he was able to feel anything.
There were two strangers in the room. Well, not strangers. More like new people he already knew a lot about. These persons were Natasha Romanov and Clint Barton, superspies and avengers. Bucky noticed that they were studying him too, but he saw no fear, no mistrust in their eyes, and a weight seemed to disappear from above his chest at that observation.
“You ? What ? You didn’t mean to do this ? Then what, exactly, did you mean to do by starving yourself to the point where your boyfriend, or should I say EX-boyfriend -because there is no way I’m allowing you near him again- is between life and death because of you ? Did you mean to get everyone’s attention ? Because let me tell you that endangering your life and others’ is never the right way to make some friends or to seek forgiveness.”
The first session had been a huge fail. Bucky had sat in a chair in front of Natasha in the Hulk Room, which had been locked by Clint, who was watching from the exterior. He had then closed his eyes and called the 'winter guy' – because apparently other guy is for the Hulk – out. When the Winter Soldier had awaken to find himself in a metal chair, he had panicked and screamed, and it was clear that he wanted to get up and as far as possible from the chair, but he didn't, he forced himself not to move and seemed to brace himself to suffer.
Bruce entered Bucky’s room to find it just like he had left it several hours ago : Tony and Thor worrying over a lifeless looking Bucky.
“Sergeant James Barnes...”
“I'd say 21 ? Yeah something like that.” Wondered Stark aloud.
“Yes, but you call me brother all the time.”
And that could only mean one thing, he realized as his smile disappeared.
“Well I need you to hold it for a minute. Keep still.”
Bucky stared at him, surprised. Thor was the first one to talk to him about this. Most of the time he just pretended this part of his wasn't real, that it was just a big nightmare.
The supersoldier wanted to snort at that. Steve woudln't care less if he died, and none of the others would.
“Yes, it’s Wanda, she is my twin sister, but I’m older by twelve minutes, so don’t touch her !”
Now, that was unusual. No one ever came to the Shield Orphanage.
---------------------------------
----------------------
“The train. I fell. I should have died but... I survived. I lost an arm, left one. I was in so much pain, and everything was so cold around me that I stopped shaking. I was dying. Did you find me ? Why... How am I still alive ?”
“Steve ! Tony Stark is at the door !!”
Clint released a huge sigh. “Great. Killer Bots 2.0, that's all I needed on a sunday afternoon.”
Something was wrong. He didn’t know what, he didn’t know how he felt it, maybe it was the way Steve looked at him when they talked earlier, maybe it was how the blond was digging into his bleeding wound with no apparent sign of pain, or any emotion at all actually. Or maybe it was just Bruce’s imagination, and a really needed to calm down.
PS : please do not kill me if you see any plot hole in here, just kindly point it out, because I just most likely genuinely forgot and will rewrite everything again as soon as you tell me !
He didn't have to wait too long. Merely an hour later the supersoldier was standing in his workshop, looking a little lost. He was looking around at all the robots and screens and Tony could see the confusion and wonder in his eyes. Bucky was way too cute, it almost hurt to look at something so perfect. Just as the thought went through the genius' head, Bucky's eyes narrowed on him, and for a moment the inventor seriously feared that Barnes had mind reading habilities he never told anyone about.
“Oh no I was just surprised, since he is hm.” Tony paused, eyeing him carefully. Bucky understood before Stark told him. “He is dead. I try not to think about him too much.” Bucky frowned slightly. New Stark was lying about the reason why he didn't want to talk about his father.
“JARVIS ? Were are you taking me ? Isn't Tony in his workshop ?”
“No one is speaking, Sergeant Barnes. Are you feeling alright ?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve clenched his fists. He had to come in. He could bear it anymore. He missed Bucky too much. His former lover would never know he visited him anyway.
“Bucky, this is important. You need to know that you're not a prisoner here, you can get your own place.”
“Howard ?”
Clint could see more and more robots landing near the supersoldiers and approaching them slowly. They only had a few seconds lef to live if they didn't move.
Bucky stared at him for a second, and yes, that was pain Tony read on his face. The supersoldier gave him a sad look and then turned away, walking out without another word.
“I'm not his..” Protested Bucky just as the elevator stopped.
There was a short silence. Tony didn't like that at all. Who the hell showed hesitation at the thought of checking on their teammate ?
---------------------
Speaking of... Next chapter's title is "King".
Later in the evening, Tony tentatively took a bite of the now cold food.
“Oh no, this one you love ! Because he is Captain fucking America and he can hit his boyfriend if he wants to !”
“Hello Bucky, so I wanted to tell you that since I'm sorry and I like you and want you to be safe.. Shit, no, absolutely not.”
The man crossed the room and sat next to him on the couch.
Just when Steve was about to ask if he was alright, Bucky finally answered.
Steve had told him that a serious Thor was a very rare sight. Right now, the god looked like someone had just died.
.AU 1 : Steve talks to Tony about Bucky being his boyfriend back in the 40s, and Tony, with that information, decides that he's not worth almost a century of love, and breaks up with Steve. : Stuckony happy ending, the cliché stuckony where Steve and Bucky try to help Tony with his self worth issues (and the rest too)
“STEVE ! BUCKY ! No ! stay with me !!” Clint fell on his knees between the two supersoldiers, feeling the pulse of each soldiers. They were weak, and if Bucky was now uncouncious, Steve seemed to still be with him.
And Steve starting to act very self-destructive ? I bet all of you are going to be mad in the comments again because I'm doing it wrong. And yes I know, any normal human wouldn't be able to stand and fight for that long after a week of not eating, but I think Steve, being a supersoldier, can last longer, but not much longer because he has a fast metabolism.
And it's mainly from Steve's pov but there is some tony stark and bucky barnes interactions in there, especially at the end (the not yet written part that is tony FINALLY calling pepper about the situation)
Tony rolled his eyes. “Okay. Convenientely forgot. But still, I forgot, not my fault, right ?”
“You should be. Now act. Do something. Fix your mess.” Bruce told him in a kinder voice as he finished fixing Steve’s wound.
Clint's first reaction is "Shit, someone de-aged the team again."
“What the…” Started Bruce.
short extract :
Steve sat in his room, looking at all his drawings. They covered the ground now. They were mostly drawings of Tony and Bucky, but now the other Avengers had their drawings too. There was one drawing were everyone was sitting in the living room, reading, watching a movie, playing cards, or sleeping. Steve had added Bucky and thought that this could have happened, had he not fucked everything up.
“Okay, time for breakfast, Buck. You're meeting the others today.”
I hope no one is crying too much. Or too angry coz I messed up. It kinda makes me feel weird to know that so many people read this. I have over 80 subscribers to this story, and we're approaching the 6000 hits. I just wanted to say thank you ! So you get a huge chap. With lots of angst. Coz you love that.
“Will our brother of iron be alright ?” Questionned Thor.
It is that last observation that made the genius come out of his state of shock.
Okay so I spent a bad day, my cat is sick and it's ugly, and if he dies I'm killing my dad (kidding. I'll just yell  A LOT because it's him who doesn't want to bring him to the vet) but anyway i'll just keep calm because I have other things to worry about and really Sarah have some perspective at least you're not secretly dying from Palladium poisoning. And your dad is not a god planet who wants to dominate the universe. and you little brother isn't loki (oh god that would be so exhausting but amazing at the same time but mainly exhausting so I'll keep my little demonic blond nerd thank you) or other bad things that happen to superheroes.
His choice was made. Steve decided to choose Bucky. They had been together for years, while his relationship with Tony had only started a few months ago. Bucky knew everything about Steve's weaknesses and he still loved him, even before the superserum, while Steve could never know for sure if all Tony saw in him wasn't only Captain America. Plus, Tony was a playboy, he would be alright, Steve was pretty sure Tony never loved him anyway. (And if that was a
“Where are you going ?” Asked Clint, stepping into the elevator too.

Jarvis stood up and turned to face his employer, carefully hiding the red and gold box behind him.
“Well, boy, if you want to go live a normal life so badly that it’s making you cry like the little girl you are, pack your things. You’re leaving in an hour.”
“Yes. I'm not sure they will want you around for the next few weeks, maybe months, Steve.”
“Yes, but not quite. He was listening to orders, he didn't care that we weren't Hydra.” Replied Natasha.
---------------------
“... I am six years old sir.” Young Tony frowned. Why didn't his daddy remember his age ?
Steve didn’t want to be awake anymore. He didn’t want to be awake ever again. Not in a world where all he does is harm the ones he loves. Not in a world where his loved ones hate his guts.
Steve stood up, and his head spinned. He needed to eat something.
I am currently writing a fanfiction named "Two can keep a secret" and it's Natasha centric because there are not enough of those fics out there. I don't think I ever read more than ten of them, both in english and french.
Bucky's throat tightenned. Why did he feel so protective of that man ?
Steve would never get to see that again.
Because it's the only thing I wanna do
I can't help but relate to Bucky so much these day. I got post traumatic amnesia and it's a true bitch. I wish I had someone like Steve, someone from the times that I forgot, to help me remember. But there is no one. I was alone. That's just my luck XD but anyway it doesn't matter that much, except that this story helps me feel better. and you readers and especially YOU commenters, motivate me to keep writing. So thank you everyone !! I love you !

And he couldn't move. That was the second thing he realized.
Bruce closed his eyes. He had no other choice.
“I try to include him in team activities, but he always finds a way out of it. He doesn’t even try to make any excuses, he… Oh Bucky, I don’t think our Steve is there at all, not anymore. It’s like… It’s like he died. Like we killed him. Or maybe he killed himself. No, that’s not it. We… We made him kill himself.”
He paused at Steve’s door, wondering if he should knock, before deciding otherwise and simply going in, closing the door behind before turning to…
The scientist glared at him before dropping his gaze to the blond’s wet hand. His eyes darkened even more, and Steve almost wished they had gone green. Hulk could punch and throw him against walls all he wanted, it was Bruce who inspired the most fear in Steve.
Bucky stood right in front of Tony now. It had been a while since they had been that close. The last time was when he woke up. Even when they had played mario kart together Tony had sat as far away as he could. He extended his metal arm to put the ice on the genius' eye.
Steve stood up, feeling his throat tighten. The choice he had just made resembled the one that led him there in nothing : it was not hard at all, and was made for others, not himself ; but it did not mean that it was less painful.
He hoped his healing factor had been numbed by the rest of his injuries, because otherwise it would be impossible for him to lose enough blood to die.
“Ready to comply” No.
“Put me on a private channel with him.”
Steve has a flashback. He remembers the time when he worked at the Hydra Orphanage and discovered a truth that would lead him to where he is now.
Anyway, as you can see, I didn't publish the natasha thing yet... Because I can't find the time to write with all those orals to prepare ! I have four of them in spanish and three and a half in english ! It's for the first week of june ! I am going to diiiieeee ! But at the same time I don't want to abandon you guys, and writing makes me forget about all the stress, so I'll try my best to give you one chapter a day, or every two days. Sounds okay with you all ?
“Like a lover.”
I'm sorry this is so short. I just want more time to figure out what the hell im gonna do with the second part, it's about Bruce. Steve is supposed to do something stupid but I don't know how to make it at least a little realistic yet. Sorry. Your comments on this chapter (if you decide to comment) would help a lot. So please please please comment, I really need your support :(
“Kill the robots.”
Bruce would also ask him if he wanted to spend an evening or an afternoon with him once a week. They would play cards, talk, watch movies, order something or cook together.
Bucky’s heart jumped, and the steady beep of the heart monitor went mad for a second, before going back to normal.
“And I won't work with you on anything, not a single project, as long as you don't tell me what happened.” Replied the scientist, crossing his arms and frowning.

“I just ran into an angry ex. You know, playboy and all that, it tends to annoy people a little bit.” Tony shrugged, but his tone was dark, and his eyes, clouded with violent memories. Bucky knew what it looked like, he saw it everytime he saw his face in a mirror.
----------------------------------
----------------------------------
He quickly checked the supersoldier's vitals and yes, the heart rate had augmented for a very short time right before Tony had called him.
The blond kept his eyes tightly closed. He wanted to go to sleep. Forever. He never wanted to hear anything from anyone ever again. Because all the persons that ever mattered to him hated him now or would hate him if they knew, and they were right to do so.
Tony was late. Again. And as always, he did not give a shit. They could all go to hell with this business shit. He just wanted to invent things not manage the whole selling them thing, it just bored him to death and wasted his time, time he could use to make better computers and phones. Or maybe he should try putting that AI in his hair dryer, it seemed like a funny idea.
-------------------------
“hm.” Tony's frown deepened at the short answer. Was he really being that boring ?
He hadn't been prepared for what had happened next. He had been looking at them from the shadows and no one should have been able to spot him, but one second Bucky had been trying to read Natasha's body language to figure out if she was planning to hurt Steve or not, and the next Thor's eyes had been on him, studying him without revealing anything to the others, while Bruce was saying that Bucky should leave, that because of him Tony was suffering.
“You'll stay with me ?” He asked, really hoping the answer would be yes, but he knew Steve wanted him to handle it on his own.
Also, today we are mainly following Bruce's point of view, but you will get some Steve and also another character. ENJOY ! :D
Clint grinned at Bucky “Mario kart is very useful because it's the only game on which I can beat Natasha without her saying it's because I'm a sniper so it doesn't count”
“No, you know what, I have had enough of you. I thought I could make you better, but you look at you !” Steve pointed to the bottle Tony had just grabbed from the bar, and held in his shaking hands. “How many bottles a day, uh ?”
Lunch passed, and the kid didn’t appear to be hungry since he didn’t buy himself anything and just kept going through shops. Tony couldn’t stop to buy something for himself either as he would instantly lose the kid. So he kept following him, and ignored his hunger.
“Because you’re part of the team.” Replied Bruce immediately. Had someone hexed the captain ?
Bucky. Steve opened his eyes and lifted his head, looking at his boyfriend through his tears. A question burned his tongue. He needed to ask.
“The Winter fucking Soldier is asking for a mission, that's what happening ! What the fuck !”
“Why wouldn't I enjoy it ?” He replied, turning to face the god.
After that he saw a perfume store and went there to buy a heavenly good smelling perfume for Pepper, because he knew serious women had very good smelling perfumes, and Pepper wants to be very serious when she grows up.
The Winter Soldier opened them.
The blue eyed supersoldier opened his eyes, a weird light shining behind them. “Yes I am ! I hurt people. I am a danger. You hate me. You all hate me. I’d rather be dead and know that I am not hurting the ones I love anymore.” Steve closed his eyes again. “I just want you to let me go. To let me.. Die. Am I asking for too much, Bruce ?”
