“He’s in Washington, for Air Force related business,” he answered stiffly, as Cap said “This is good, he’s remembering more!”
He couldn’t get the words out of his mouth. Every time he wanted to speak about the witch and the curse, his throat closed up, his tongue curled in his mouth and his lips became sealed. He gritted his teeth in frustration.
As the minutes tick by, the smell of sweat impregnates the gym. It fills Tony’s nostrils, creeps into his mouth, stings his eyes. Steve’s smell and his own intermingle until they’re indistinguishable from one another, and Tony can barely keep from salivating. There’s no blood, thankfully. If there were, Tony is under no illusion that he wouldn’t lose his mind. He’s already high on the adrenaline rush. He’s already one inch away from jumping Steve and rutting mindlessly against him.
Two weeks later, Steve was comfortable in his role as shop assistant, and people came to him if Stark wasn’t there, assuming that Steve was an apprentice. Steve never corrected them. In a way, it was fun, casting little spells, helping people, playing with magic.
For a terrifying moment, there was nothing but Stark, Steve, and their hands linked together. They were flying, or falling, or sinking, or floating, stuck in time and place.
better.”
He needed to save Tony, needed to fight with him, for him, needed to stop the Witch from doing anything to him. He wouldn’t let her do anything.
“You’re… Iron Man? Mr. Stark?”
Steve couldn’t believe it. He thought he had two options to regain his body, that if he didn’t manage to break the contract, or if Stark kicked him out, he would still have a chance with Potts. But there was no Potts. Potts was Stark, and that meant that Steve had no other choice but to stay in the moving castle.
Steve should hold Tony more often. With him here, sleeping is the easiest thing in the world.
Steve is so close that Tony imagines his hair shifting slightly with the air coming out of Steve’s mouth. He can see Steve’s face clearly in his mind’s eye: the downward curve of his pale blond eyebrows, the slightly pursed lips, the long eyelashes framing his ocean-blue eyes. Maybe he’s crossing his arms, or maybe he has them on his hips, or on his belt. He’s wearing the uniform, of course. It’s the first thing he does when he wakes up: briefs, socks, uniform, boots. Gloves, if he needs to go outside. Cowl, if there’s a fight.
Steve had been in his room a lot the last few days, had Tony brought her home without Steve noticing? Steve could see him do that. Sure, Tony didn’t seem all to interested in O’Casta, but you never knew. She seemed interested enough for two.
Tony sees exactly how badly he’s miscalculated when Steve strips right in front of him to change into workout gear. One instant, Tony’s looking at a handsome body hidden under clothes, and the next, there’s the object of his fantasies in touching distance. Tony can’t keep his eyes away from the chiselled muscles bunching and stretching as Steve removes his T-shirt and jeans. Tony can see a vein pulsing along Steve’s upper thigh. He wants to sink his teeth into it. He’d do it, right here, right now. He’d slide to his knees and wrap his hands around Steve and taste what he wants. The smell alone is almost too much.
James collapsed to the ground as if he was a puppet whose strings just got cut. Tony cursed again, getting down on one knee to check on James, who was unconscious. What had happened? What had the Witch done? Steve hurried over to help Tony carry James to the couch they’d been sitting in, putting the blanket around him.
“I mean, not that letting out a little steam isn’t understandable, but we’ve got more pressing matters than a little friendly murder between—” and he stops at that, because what are they? Teammates? Former friends? Enemies? Executioner and death row inmate?
They resume the sparring without a word. Tony keeps himself in check this time, tries to never exceed the power and speed he used during the first round. Steve is agile and fast, and has a few tricks up his sleeve that allow him to throw Tony down on the mat several times. Each time, Tony has to grit his teeth to stave off the bloodcurdling anger, the enraged voice inside of his head that howls at him to make Steve pay, to show him who’s most powerful, most dangerous, most lethal.
“The first loop I remember is when I, when I suited up and pushed you and”—Christ, he can’t even say it—"and you. You fell.”
She stared at him.
And they’re against a wall again, and Steve still has his hands on his shoulders, and his eyes are burning through Tony’s soul, and there’s a horrible part of Tony that wants to kiss Steve, just to see what will happen, because he’s baring his heart already, why not go all the way? He’s lied to Steve, betrayed him, deceived him for months, so why shouldn’t he make everything the worst it can be by confessing?
He doesn’t know how to make sense of that. How can he reconcile his meticulous planning, his machinations, his manipulations, the awful things he’s done to keep things from getting even worse; and this desperate need for it all to stop?
It may sound insane, what Steve’s saying, but he’s right. He found a neat little loop-hole. Tony will be technically dead, but still conscious. The average human loses consciousness about 20 seconds after their heart has stopped. Tony’s almost sure that he can last longer thanks to Extremis. He’ll be dead, and he will be able to touch Steve, for real. Not just a glance, or a punch, but a full-body contact.
The eggs were ready.
Steve racked his brain, trying to remember what they’d been talking about before they found themselves snuggling on the couch. James had turned back into a man, he’d talked about Natasha, and—
With someone tall and lanky, draped in cloth that looked expensive and—was that the scarecrow?
Tony was fighting the Witch, and with every spell that she threw at him, he grew a feather. She didn’t stop, didn’t stop when he collapsed into a heap, when the scales took over his face, when the marks were hidden beneath coarse black feathers, didn’t stop until he was immobile, a mass of feathers and claws and scales.
. I didn’t think you knew, since you never said anything about it. Have you known from the start?”
“How did it happen?”
steve doesn't get a break from the ice in my story, no siree!
Jarvis wasn’t there, gone, and Steve could do nothing with his measly body and ridiculous shield.
What does a man say when he’s got moments left to live?
“I never laughed. Nothing about this is funny. Steve, I mean it when I say that I never wanted to wipe you. If it’d been up to me, we would have kept you with us, because you’re the one with the highest morals. And you were right, that day, when you told us we would lose sight of ourselves if we started thinking about the worst scenario, and that we would convince ourselves that it’s the lesser of two evils. And that’s exactly what happened. We—I built bombs. And I won’t say I would do anything differently, because I wouldn’t. I still believe that if it comes to that, the most ethical thing is to destroy a planet. Even if I won’t be able to look at myself in the mirror afterwards. Because it’s that or losing two entire universes. Trillions of lives, Steve. At such a scale, morality becomes irrelevant.”
“Where’s Rhodey?”
Tony wants to throw up. What the hell was he thinking? What the fuck did he just do?
am I supposed to think, huh? I thought Extremis might be messing with your emotions, but you were all over the place! You were fucking spilling your emotions everywhere! And then you come back and you don’t remember anything and I tell myself to move on but how am I supposed to do that if you never explained why you did all this, why you felt it was necessary, because you always have those pretty reasons, but now everything you have to say is that you’re sorry but that you’d do it again. And then you pull this shit and I still don’t understand what’s going on, and I’m so angry I can’t even think straight but now we’re both here and we have nothing better to do and I want, I need to know. I need it to make sense, because there’s the Tony that I thought I knew and then there’s the Tony I see and I don’t know which one is the real one, if there even is a real one. And you never give me any answers, but now you said you’d answer me, so do it. Do it.”
Steve would never have thought that he would one day ask a weredog if he was friends with a scarecrow, but here they were.
“Tony… we’ll find a way to stop this, I promise. Please don’t give up.”
The next, he broke out into hysterical laughing.
“I’m not telling you to kill yourself, Tony,” Steve sighs. “We both know you can survive a heart attack.”
That was… It was too late to change anything now. King Rhodes had appointed Tony to be the court sorcerer, it was official. The outcome was everything Tony didn’t want it to be, and it was all Steve’s fault, because he couldn’t even lie convincingly. But on the other hand, Steve felt good that he hadn’t lied, because he wanted someone else to know that Tony was better than people believed him to be. Why he wanted to, well, that was something he didn’t want to examine too closely. He felt that he wouldn’t like what he found, wouldn’t like the depth of his feelings.
The prettiest flowers were the ones from the field. There wasn’t really much of a choice.
Was there no way that he could convince the King? Appeal to his clemency? But that meant that Steve would have to explain why Tony had to stay away from the Witch of the Waste, and that was something that only three people in the whole kingdom knew. If miss Potts didn’t, then the King couldn’t be aware either.
He couldn’t let the scarecrow in. He had done enough damage today already, and he would be damned if he let this happen as well.
“Leave the girl alone.”
It’s almost nothing, almost just a piece of cloth.
Tony infuses just the right amount of helpless anger in his voice, averts his eyes from Steve, and holds in a giggle when the armour tells him Steve finally smiles.
He also knew that all the clients systematically underpaid Stark. Which meant that either they paid Stark in another manner—food? Information? ……Sacrifices?—or the spells were of a very bad quality and weren’t worth more than that. But that didn’t make any sense, because the customers always came back happy with the products, thanking Steve or Stark profusely, always so happy. The spells had to be genuine. Besides, Stark was a potent wizard; he had a fire demon. Steve had read that if magic users that make a contract with demons aren’t powerful enough, they will be consumed by the demon, in a few minutes or several years, depending on the power gap. Steve had asked Jarvis about it and Jarvis had said that raw power wasn’t the issue with the contract.
He watched, awed, as the armour levitated out of the workshop, up to the kitchen, and out of the castle. Jarvis was still burning in the fireplace, sending him a full-body wave goodbye as a part of him took charge of the armour.
on you, Tony, it’s unbelievable. You truly think that you’ll be able to fix this on your own, don’t you? Creating this little secret group, convincing yourselves that six people can rule the world from the shadows. How is that working out for you, Tony? Did you solve the incursions yet? Or do you just bomb every earth that is unfortunate enough to cross your path. I don’t know what disgusts me more, you know. That you’re doing all this, or that you thought we could still stand side-by-side like you deserve it. I wouldn’t have thought you’d be the planet-killer type. But then again, I never thought you’d wipe my mind just because I was inconvenient either, so it shows what I know, huh?”
She only knew Stark by reputation, then. Which could be good or bad, depending on which stories she’d heard. Stark must have been thinking along the same lines as Steve, because his body language became more closed as he asked, still smiling, what other things she might have heard about him.
He hasn’t seen Nomad in a while.
Steve nodded, ears hot, and Stark waved at him. The next moment, the paint was gone, and Stark was sitting at the table, inviting Steve over.
The peace is broken by a shrill noise.
, gossiping like little ladies of that age are prone to do.
Tony was gone, for God knew how long, and all Steve had was his shield and a scared fire demon to help him. Had Tony decided to flee? Would he even come back? He had to, he wouldn’t leave Steve like that, would he?
He thinks of the sneer on Steve’s face when they last spoke. He thinks of the defeated slump of Steve’s shoulders after Tony left. He thinks about hugs and clasped hands from a lifetime ago, of the sun playing with Steve’s hair, giving him a golden glow.
Tony smiled at him, wide and easy, and laughed.
The warmth has spread to Tony’s fingertips, to his nose, to his toes. He’s safe here. Steve has him. Steve’s hand is a heavy, comforting weight on his chest. He’s so tired. Maybe he could sleep for a while, Steve wouldn’t mind. Steve always says Tony should sleep more.
Steve tried to start a conversation with Jarvis but got pointedly ignored. He walked around the kitchen, looking for something to do. There were no customers to help, he’d cleaned the whole castle already, and dinner was still a long time away. What could he do?
Tony was supposed to keep him safe. Was supposed to put an end to the fighting.
It didn’t really surprise Steve, to be honest. He’d been surprised at first when he discovered that Stark wasn’t charging them enough, but it made sense in a weird way. Steve himself was essentially living in Stark’s house for free, eating and sleeping without paying anything. Stark had even given him clothing after a few days spent in the castle. “To be more presentable”, Stark had said, but Steve suspected it was because the wizard had seen that he had worn the same clothes three days in a row.
Tony stood up, feathers fluttering to the ground as he stepped towards James, and said, in a terribly quiet voice:
“You’re mistaking him for Loki Laufeyson, Margaret. My grandson saw the wizard whisk away his friend, and he had shining blue hair and golden-brown eyes.”
“You should get out of bed.”
Steve, still coughing his lungs out, couldn’t protest as Tony used magic, clearly using his last reserves, to ease the burn in his chest. The cough abated, and it was Steve’s turn to put a hand on Tony’s back, easing him into a lying position. He was sweating profusely, his hair plastered to his face, his eyes electric. The scales were covering various parts of his body, reminding Steve of the toll that using his magic took on Tony. With the marks and the scales and the feathers, Tony didn’t look like himself anymore. He looked more beast than human.
“I—well—I mean. Yeah? Why not? You seemed glad to move back to Brooklyne, so why not take the opportunity to move into your shop? Then everything would be familiar to you, and we could combine my magic skills with your painting skills to make an even better shop.”
There’s little to work with, but one theory is safe to voice.
A tomato hits Steve’s jaw, the juice dripping onto his uniform. Steve doesn’t react. Tony forces the undersheath back under his skin. He will find the civilian later. Extremis recorded everything. He looks back to Steve, tries to read the slant of his eyebrows and the upwards tilt of his chin. Steve pauses mid-step.
The man recoiled, eyes wide, then hard. Tony guessed that that hadn’t been a good answer. Did the man know his name? It was safe to assume so. But why was he so angry? Did that mean that he was working for the enemy? Or was he an old rival? Did he know of Tony’s extracurricular activities?
Tony entered the kitchen just as Steve was about to carry one of the vases to the shop. He didn’t look happy, at all. But his face lit up when he saw the flowers.
There was nothing left, nothing but a single wasp. It buzzed slightly, flying towards the nearest window.
“Thank you for the explanation, Mr. Rogers,” the King said. He was smirking, lips curled up behind his hand.
“This isn’t one of the spells I left for you. I don’t know where this came from. Where did you say you found it again?”
“I’ve tried everything, but I still can’t take off the chestplate. Best I can do is lengthen the time between charges.”
“The audience with the King is soon, I’d like to talk about it with you, if you’re still all right with going for me?”
Oh. He should probably answer before Steve kills him.
Unexpectedly, Tony didn’t seem to mind the news about the King making him court sorcerer that much. He frowned when Steve told him but looked oddly pleased that the King had caught out Steve’s lies and turned them into the compliments they really were.
—and Steve
He didn’t know what to say other than that, so he stood up and shuffled to what looked like a pantry. After some digging around, he found what he wanted: an egg and two thick slices of bacon. Now to find a pan. Jarvis didn’t say anything, but Steve could feel the burning gaze on his back as he moved around. When he had the pan and a lick of butter, he walked back to Jarvis and held the pan up.
This should make Tony happy. They’re both attracted to one another. They both like each other. They do. Just because Tony wants to bleed Steve out doesn’t mean he can’t like him as well. How many humans have bonded with their hens, kept them as pets, lovingly knitted scarves and hats for them, only to drink them up in a nice broth when they were too old to lay eggs?
“Thank you.”
Stark ignored Cap, and started rooting around in the lab until he found a paper with the blueprints to a small device, a “pacemaker”. He thrust it in Tony’s hands,
“Did she do something to you? I couldn’t see her hands.”
“Thank you, that’s enough.”
He really was lucky that Tony didn’t exude this air of importance. He’d never have dared to talk to him otherwise.
Steve scoffs.
Tony’s in his workshop, and he panics as he tries to understand what happened. There are running footsteps coming closer. He turns to the door as Steve skids to a halt in the workshop, and they stare at each other. Steve’s eyes are so wide, his chest heaving, his cheeks flushed. He looks, and Tony looks back, and he takes a step forward, and suddenly Steve is crowding him into the wall, hands around his face, and Tony has a flash of panic, remembering the last time Steve’s hands were on his head.
As he came nearer, he realised that the scarecrow was emitting sounds, but sounds that he couldn’t place, that weren’t words. James seemed to understand him, though, speaking to it normally.
He stumbles, trips and falls on his back, and Steve is on him before he can right himself. Steve is a formidable foe, a master in close-quarter fighting, and each and every one of his punches lands. Tony is very much not an expert in hand-to-hand. Besides, most of his techniques he knows from sparring with Steve, which means that he is at a disadvantage, and that he should get Steve off him, get some distance between them.
Tony wiped his brow, took one look at Steve, and practically ran out of the castle with a hasty word about seeing O’Casta. Great. Apparently, Steve’s bad mood was particularly obvious, to the point it had chased Tony out. Just what Steve needed.
“I’m uh. I’m Steve Rogers. I needed somewhere to sleep and the door was unlocked, so I came in. Thank you for your hospitality.”
She managed to strike him in the middle of the chest, a bright burning agony that made his heart stutter. It was a terrible pain, white-hot and searing, as if she was branding a star right into his chest.
“Isn’t there any way to break the curse? You still have a few months before Midsummer day.”
Steve won’t let it lie. He insists. Tells Tony he needs the practice. What if his armour is incapacitated? He needs to be able to stand his own, can’t he understand that he isn’t invincible without his suit? Tony wants to answer that the day someone gets him out of the armour will be the last day of that person. He’s itching to sink his fangs into anything, anyone, when he fights, and if he gets out of the armour, it’s game over for everyone. Including himself, of course, because then everyone will know what he is. He’s honestly surprised that it hasn’t happened already. Maybe JARVIS is making sure that the opportunity never arises. God knows that
Tony looked at him, bewildered.
Stark was gone, again, leaving a faint smell of metal and honey as he strode out of the door and disappeared into the sky. He hadn’t listened to a word Steve had said.
painting shop?”
Tony stares at the ceiling. Like this, he can almost pretend he’s alone in the room. Pretend that no one knows where he is, that no one cares about him or what he’s doing.
James’ eyes widened.
“Were you trying to see if we could move into the painting shop?
That was something else that surprised Steve. Tony was making jokes about his possible demise. And while it was preferable to crying about it, Steve didn’t know what to think of the dark brand of humour that Tony had adopted.
It only takes 20 seconds to lose consciousness after the heart stops.
When he had some free time, he read books about fire demons and their magic. They varied in form and colour, had mysterious names, never lied. Steve was surprised to read that no one knew where they came from, because no one had found a fire demon that wasn’t tied to someone already, and the demons never spoke of their earlier lives.
Steve would love this, Tony thinks. He’d look at the pale blue ray and say something about different lightings giving different moods. Maybe he’d even take out his notebook and draw this.
“You just threw your last punch, boy,” the soldier growled behind him, and fired.
It was Tony’s secret to tell.
He’s a rabid beast.
A thud from the stairs jerked them apart. James was heavily leaning against the ramp, hands gripping his head, panting heavily, groaning as he fell to one knee.
Thor is swinging his hammer left and right, but Steve is fixated on Tony, hitting him again and again and again, unrelenting.
20 years and still no hope for his heart? It couldn’t be true.
“You didn’t manage to catch one, did you?”
Tony stayed that way for a long time, immobile under the shield while Steve did his best to stave off the Witch’s increasingly frantic offensive. Tony’s hair was standing on end, floating around his head. His eyes were completely taken over by the electric blue glow, the signature colour of his magic. His hands were nothing more than claws, his legs bent oddly. He was transforming into a monstrous human-sized raven. But that meant that he was using his magic, all of it, every last reserve. This was his last attempt at stopping the Witch. If Tony failed, Steve knew they’d both die.
It couldn’t take long, surely, she had been so close to the shop, and—
met a younger version of Tony. Did Tony mean…
He agreed, and Stark smiled that beautiful smile again. Steve had to be careful, or he would grant Stark everything just to see that smile.
In the end, it’s Gretl that finds him. She’s going to have her baby soon, she says. They won’t make it to the hospital, she says. It’s just like being stranded on top of a mountain, she says. But there won’t be any rescue.
“Why are you here, Steve?”
As soon as the scarecrow touched the skull, they fused into one in a cloud of orange smoke. When the smoke cleared, there was a man standing in front of Steve, as tall as Tony, his black hair slicked back elegantly, hints of white strands at his temples. He had a tasteful goatee that reminded Steve of Tony’s moustache. He was clad in dark blue clothes, the dark red robes he’d had as a scarecrow transformed into a grand cloak that was swaying lightly around him.
They’re as close as they’ll ever be.
“Please call me Joy. You too, Mr. Rogers, or can I call you Steve?”
He needs another taste.
Tony’s nursing his bottle. It’s the last expensive one he bought, an old scotch. It burns his throat, and empties his mind, and he loves the taste of it.
Steve tells him he used him, and Tony knows it’s too late.
Armour that kept others out, but kept him in. Safe from the outside world. Imprisoned. A part of him died there, inside the first suit. The rest of him never stopped screaming.
“I’m telling you, it’s a bad sign that
“A heart’s a heavy burden.”
James helped Steve carry Tony to the couch, where he insisted Steve join him to rest from his coughing fit. Steve didn’t need to rest, but he saw that James had brought them a blanket, and Steve couldn’t resist spending time in close proximity to Tony, so he sat down on the couch. He caught the knowing look that James sent his way before slinking out of the kitchen, where to, Steve had no idea. Honestly, he didn’t care.
Steve couldn’t deny that it was pretty damning evidence.
It would be bad for business to only have one of them in the shop on their first day open. Steve walked back to the shop, flipped the sign so that it said “CLOSED” and locked the door. The shop wouldn’t disappear, he could always open it tomorrow.
—like he said, he doesn’t think about it.
friendly discount, if you asked Steve. Did the girl have a beautiful older sibling, maybe? Ugh.
The fire demon scoffed. It was a hissing, popping sound.
The Witch had Tony. She had captured Tony.
After coming back to see the bathroom cleaned, Stark huffed and grumbled a bit, but congratulated Steve on a job well done. He forbade him from entering the room with the battered door and gleaming handle, saying something about his workshop being off-limits. Steve was just glad he had one less room to clean, even if his curiosity only got worse. The fear of discovering something horrible in there still won out. For now.
Another one chimed in: “I hear he’s a lovely young man, you wouldn’t think he ate people’s hearts if you saw him in the streets, which is how he lures so many youngsters to his home. I heard he’s got beautiful blond hair and sky-blue eyes.”
With a wink, Stark walked away, leaving Steve with the shield, looking at the reflection of the dancing flames. Stark wasn’t wrong in that he could use something to protect himself. If anything, he would look less ridiculous with a shield than a frying pan. It really was a magnificent thing, but it could be even better. The stark surface of the shield was all sleek lines and cool colours, but Steve wanted to have something of his on this. He was going to paint it.
“I—I can’t. I. I don’t want everyone to know about the incursions because that would lead to mass panic and guilt and they deserve to live in happiness, even if its’ a lie, because the next months might be our last, might be everyone’s last. And I hoped we would find a solution before it would get this serious. We’re working on it, we’re recruiting and we’re putting the best minds on Earth on it and—”
The lab was even worse. There were all kinds of machines, several other Iron Man suits, and terrariums of ants, which was unexpected. Iron Man immediately set about scanning Tony with several gizmos. Every time the scans came out negative for whatever he was looking for, he huffed out a breath. Cap was on the side, alternatively watching Iron Man and Tony, sending them both increasingly concerned looks.
He put one of Tony’s arms around his shoulder, put the shield on his free hand, and stood up. He panted harshly, getting used to the weight. He could do this.
, and I’ll focus on the more urgent matters,” Steve reasonably said, “as in what we’re going to do now that the Witch has found two of your addresses.”
“Tony, Jarvis, you’re barely recovered from the fight, shouldn’t we wait a little before—”
He drops to the ground, pushes Steve off and steps out of his armour, hands up, hoping that his surrender will calm Steve down. Steve’s sneering, shield in his hands, and then his arm’s a blur and Tony feels a
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.”
He realizes that he’s crying.
“Incredible, isn’t it? How much technology has changed in twenty years.”
He took a deep breath in, steadied himself, and continued.
What if it was the Witch? What if it was someone else? But who else? Two of the four places the door led to weren’t inhabited. It wouldn’t hurt to check, though. Steve had been surprised by the scarecrow and the weredog, what if this was yet another being he had met before? What if it was Lord Fury, or even Natasha? Or Tony who couldn’t enter the castle for some reason?
Steve had agreed to Stark’s plan, but now that he was face to the King, he just wanted to bow deep and confess about the plan. He suspected the King’s eyes had that effect on anyone.
Was Stark even his real name?
There was green again, a lot of it, and then blue again.
“I—It’s hard—my memories—all over the place. Bu—no. James. I’m James. James? James B… Buc—I don’t remember.”
Tony eyed Steve, fingers tapping absentmindedly on his chest.
Tony chuckled humourlessly.
“Tony, did you go visit O’Casta?”
“What?” Came the eloquent answer.
Tony’s a little surprised that Steve only brought Thor and Black Widow with him, but then again, his wrath might be so consuming that he can’t think clearly anymore. For all he knows, they’re here to stop Steve from doing something too drastic. They aren’t angry with him, and Tony wonders if they even know why they’re here. Do they know what he’s done? Do they know what’s waiting for all of them? Or are they trusting Steve to be right, to know what he’s doing, when he accuses Tony of being a traitor?
Steve wondered what the King meant about types. Steve wasn’t anyone’s type, that was for sure. But if the King knew that kind of thing about Stark, they must be very close. Steve felt a surge of jealousy at the thought.
He doesn’t deserve this Steve. He deserves the one that hurts him, that punches him in the face, that chokes him and looks at him with cold, dead eyes. This parody of kindness is worse. It’s everything Tony will never have, everything he’s yearned for and annihilated before it could happen.
The room was clearly the space of a skilled magician or inventor, or maybe both, although not a very orderly nor organised one. It needed tidying up and cleaning. And the fire was almost out.
These falling stars were killing themselves, he understood. And that boy was saving one of them. He put his hands to his mouth and ate the star, the light pulsing pink and purple in his throat before dying in a midnight blue glow in his chest. Steve cried out loud at that, afraid for the boy, and why wasn’t he getting closer?
Cap glanced uncertainly at both of them. He stepped closer to Tony, eyes searching for something in his face. Tony stayed stock-still and tried not to notice how handsome Cap was. Cap didn’t seem to find the answer he was looking for, because he just frowned even more, and, oh, was that a
There. Vague but not untrue. Cap’s face fell.
“I’m going to make breakfast. Do you want anything? Or maybe you only eat wood? Does fried wood taste better? Actually, do planks taste different than sticks or logs?”
Tony wonders if Steve resents Tony for this too. There’s a good argument to be made that this is Tony’s fault. He saw the war come and didn’t stop it. He escalated, made things worse, drove heroes apart. He made Steve defenceless. And now he was too slow to save Steve.
Tony shrugged. It had seemed like the thing to do at the time. He couldn’t help but notice that Cap was torn between believing Iron Man and him. He ultimately put himself closer to Iron Man, and Tony cursed inwardly. Cap wasn’t going to trust him, then. Cap turned to Iron Man, putting his back to Tony. Tony was a little bit insulted to be dismissed so easily.
Stark knocked politely.
Tony ran faster. Behind him, Rhodey shouted something about idiots and tripping and breaking their neck. He might have had a point, but it was too late to worry about this kind of thing. Tony would run like a “fucking madman”, thanks Pepper, until he found the key. Tony spared a thought to be thankful that Jarvis was still on the airship, because he would have popped a vein at the sight of Tony pushing himself further than his heart allowed it. Sorry, Jarvis, he’d recharge his heart later.
He put a knee to the ground, bowing his head in respect. The King waved him up, one eyebrow raised.
“Don’t even try, Stark. Something scared you, a lot. What was it?”
Steve knew that he would have to apologise at some point. He’d damaged the castle, possibly endangering Jarvis and himself, and insulted Stark. And he would apologise—he knew his manners, after all—but not right now.
“Yeah, well, we wouldn’t be in this situation if you weren’t a liar.”
“The weredog turned into a man again today. His name is James. Maybe he can tell us more about the Witch and what she wants.”
But Stark didn’t give up. If anything, he became even friendlier, accepting her refusal but redoubling his advances.
Tony’s hands were trembling where they clutched his tunic, his eyes wet. Steve didn’t know what to do. He was to blame for this, he knew. He hadn’t been careful enough, he’d picked the flowers without looking for a mandrake. He’d promised himself not to do the exact same thing he’d just done, and with devastating consequences. What could he say? Nothing he would say would make it better. Oh God, what had he done?
“Please bring it closer.”
Well, they didn’t need to know. Besides, Tony knew that the Gestapo had sent their newest Zemo to retrieve the key, and the Nazis getting their hands on this artifact was not an option. If the artifact worked as it was described, it was a teleporting device. Tony wasn’t clear on the physics, but he’d seen enough weird things in his lifetime to know that sometimes science couldn’t explain everything.
Tony couldn’t have decided to give up, could he?
“I’m—I heard you wanted to—to meet me. I’m—hrrrk—Natasha’s lover. Don’t tell Sta—”
“I didn’t know you were going to Shield, otherwise I would have! I’m very grateful for Jarvis and the armour, thank you. Next time, I’ll ask you, certainly.”
Tony found himself shaking his hand.
Jarvis’ tone was unreadable.
Even now, Tony can’t bear to entertain the very real possibility that Steve will be hanged for treason. His mind revolts at the mere thought. It won’t happen, Tony will make sure of it. He still has some favours he can cash in. There is simply no way that he will let Steve die, nor let him get imprisoned for life.
Sulkily, Steve sat up on the couch, grabbing one of the cushions to prevent himself from making fists, and glared at Stark.
“Hey, Steve, are you okay? How are you? Jarvis told me you weren’t feeling well?”
“Glad you’re having fun, Stark, Steve.”
His limbs are slow, heavy. His head is too full. He feels stuffy, as if someone has put cotton inside his head. He wonders if his veins are blown up, if his sinuses are full.
Sometimes Tony doesn’t know who the Iron Man is supposed to be protecting. Is it a metal suit to keep the sunbeams from touching Tony? Or is it a walking prison to keep the bloodthirsty monster from tearing open the throat of the nearest civilian?
Stephen Strange smiled again, and said:
The Witch had found Tony, and they were fighting.
“Your—uh, your wounds?”
“And what about the skull?”
, voice-Natasha laughed.
Steve seems to be thinking along the same lines because his frown deepens.
Steve understood. It wasn’t as if Tony’s name or address were a secret. Which meant that—Tony had been muttering about wards, hadn’t he? He must have hidden his castle from the Witch somehow, and it had worked, until very recently. What could have—the curse. Now that the curse had caught up with him, his own warding spells were weaker against the Witch. She had to know that her curse had touched Tony, and she was trying to kill him now that she had the advantage.
When Steve came back to the kitchen, Stark was nowhere to be seen. It was just as good, if you asked Steve. He really didn’t want to see the man. So he sat in front of the fire, watching Jarvis burn through a birch log. It was soothing, in a way.
“I assure you, no one here has tried to cast the spell, I just want to read the rest of it. With my hand on my heart, I promise we’ll be gone as soon as I read it, and you won’t hear from us again.”
Tony’s frequent references to his heart.
Maybe he should proposition Steve, see how he react. It'd be entertaining.
It was the man from two nights ago, the one who had saved Steve’s life. And who also was Stark, apparently.
“You’re right. If I could ask you for a favour, would you please help me exit the guild domain without getting noticed by Stark?”
The gauntlet is licked clean, the dull shine of the blood replaced with the glistening of saliva. Even the smell is gone, Tony’s done such a thorough job. There’s nothing left. He should have touched Steve for longer. Should have let the blood soak through. Should have offered Steve a ride home; he would have bled all over the armour. Tony shivers at the thought and tries to ignore the raging hunger for more.
Warnings blare up in his HUD and Tony knows his core has died.
A whining sound behind Steve made him look back. It was one of the armours, speeding towards the fight. It raised its hands, a blue beam shooting out of them and hitting the Witch in her bad arm, giving Tony the time to fly to the armour and change back to a human just as it encompassed him.
There it was again, that cocky smirk, and Steve suddenly felt a lot less bad about assuming false things about Stark.
gets out of their bed. It’s not as if it’s fucking hard. All he has to do is sit up, pull the covers aside, put his feet on the ground, and stand up.
“So you want me to say that you only think of yourself, that you aren’t good at helping people or rescuing them?”
She must be a very good friend if Stark had used her name. Steve was curious as to what she thought of Stark. She must see through his masks, and maybe she would give some hints to Steve as to how to do it.
“Drop your gun and we’ll talk. Final warning.”
He wasn’t going to think about it.
Still, if the Witch was so powerful, surely she could guarantee that the curse would happen? Maybe the words were a metaphor for something else. Maybe it wasn’t talking about a mandrake, but something that was symbolically connected to a mandrake, or maybe mandrake was something else for magically versed people. Steve had no idea, really. How would he know what to do? And Stark had said himself that it was difficult to best the Witch.
Steve doesn’t know what he does to Tony just by standing in the same room. The scent is so strong that Tony can smell him from three floors away. Tony has to breathe through his mouth when they’re in the same room, or else the smell clogs up in his nose, entering into his every pore, and drives him insane with want. His breaths are measured, in, out, in, out, until Steve leaves and Tony can almost relax again.
“See? Just like that,” Steve whispers.
Why couldn’t he be taller? Why couldn’t he have said yes to Tony’s offer when they met on that first night? It would’ve been perfect, both of them on a date, and with some luck, he would have spent the night with Tony, who had showed clear interest in his looks. It was a story out of a fairy-tale: a man in danger, another saves him, and they fall in love. Instead, Steve had rejected Tony, gone home, and gotten himself cursed by the damn Witch.
“I hear he can take any form at will, be it a woman or man’s, but that his eyes always stay green and his hair raven-black.”
“Stop this. I won’t repeat myself.”
Tony can’t bear to see the thinly veiled disgust he’s sure to find in Steve’s eyes. He looks down, to the side, settles on a point over Steve’s shoulder.
Behind him, Tony and Strange were showing no signs of having heard anything. James was still frowning at his arm. Steve supposed he would be the one to open the door. He grabbed his shield, almost as an afterthought, and opened the door just as the conversation behind him grew heated.
It was Tony! He’d transformed himself into a raven and was now matching the Witch blow to blow. Steve watched with trepidation as the turquoise flares outnumbered the green ones. A particularly big one ended with a howl of rage, and Tony flew away as the Witch grew to her original size again, clutching her arm. Steve wasn’t sure, but he thought he saw blood. The Witch didn’t stop at her own size, however, having seemingly decided that if shrinking wasn’t working, she’d grow tall instead. She grew and grew and grew until she towered tall as a tree, her hands sharpening and straightening into pointed blades, her dress rippling in yellow and black around her. She had wings, Steve saw, insect wings that kept her flying. All in all, she reminded Steve of a giant, deadly wasp.
There is nothing Tony can do but wait and see. He’s ready. He’s prepared for everything. In the case that he survives, he’s put a comfortable sum of money aside, whipped up a few false identities, stuffed a duffel bag full of clothes and blood and sunscreen.
“I guess I didn’t imagine the angry mermaid screaming? And that it’s the reason why the marks have grown so fast in so little time?”
Gretl.
Tony wasn’t allowed to die before Steve confessed his feelings to him. He just. Wasn’t.
Steve couldn’t stand himself. He needed to do something, he needed to stop being so useless.
He doesn't know if he is stronger than Steve, though. He gets so overwhelmed by the scent of Steve’s blood that he can’t decide on what Steve is to him. He wants to say that Steve is just a meal waiting to happen, but the truth is, he doesn’t know. When Tony inevitably gives in and goes for Steve’s throat, it could go either way. Maybe Tony will pin Steve against the wall and suck him dry. Maybe he’ll take control, keep the straining mass of Steve in place while he takes what he wants. But just as easily, they could be evenly matched, fighting and fighting until they both succumb to exhaustion. Steve could be stronger than Tony, too. Maybe he'll push Tony back and take his shield and slice off his head. Who knows.
He shouted at Tony.
“Mighty Avenger.” Tony blurts. “It’s Mighty Avenger. You should… don’t you know that?”
He needed to know more before he could form a judgement. He had misjudged Tony too many times to fall to the obvious conclusion. He refused to believe that Tony was just being his infamous libertine self, not just after realising that the Witch of the Waste was so close. He opened his mouth, ready to ask for a reason, when he saw the walls come up behind Tony’s eyes.
So this is where Tony sleeps, when he takes the time to rest, or when he’s so fucking tired that he can’t do anything else but lay on the mattress like a dead fish.
They helped each other to the entrance of the castle, sitting in the sand until the familiar whine of the suit reached them. Tony let it embrace him, and as soon as he was surrounded by it, he stood straighter. Steve suspected the suit was the only thing holding him standing.
, the voice whispered. Steve frowned.
He was saved from coming up with something when the weredog—how could a dog be this silent, Steve wondered, this was the second time that he had completely forgotten about him—barked curtly, as if to remind them that he was there.
The irony of the situation isn’t lost on Tony. He’s here, in his workshop, in his home, surrounded by his teammates, but he knows no one will come to help him. It’s his fault, anyways. It’s his armours that are shooting at Thor, restraining Black Widow, exploding around Hawkeye’s arrows, making sure Hyperion and Starbrand are too distracted to realise that this isn’t a brawl, isn’t a mere disagreement, is anything other that the collapse of the lie Tony has spent months cultivating, protecting, all the while knowing it would come to this if Steve ever found out. Tony doesn’t need to remember the final moments of the war to know that this is what Steve looks like when he’s about to kill you.
Tony dares to smile back, and Steve kisses him again. This time, Tony closes his eyes, and he barely registers the world going orange behind his eyelids.
“He shot at me first!”
Steve inched closer, trying to get a good opening to help James.
. Jarvis could keep on calling his name, but it wouldn’t stop Steve.
Tony was on the floor, breathing too hard and too fast, scrambling to take off his tunic, likely needing to see the damage for himself. When he was bare-chested, Steve winced. Tony’s whole torso was full of the marks, a good deal of them marring his back as well, having reached well past his ribs. Several strands disappeared into Tony’s pants, others had started travelling down his arms. In the centre of his sternum, the marks were so dense that they looked like a black circle, as if there was a hole in Tony’s chest. It looked terrible.
“This, Steve, was my garden. The desert you see is the Waste, where Janet’s castle roams.”
He sat up, rubbing his head with one hand, the other one still clutched around the key. He wasn’t in the cave anymore, that much was obvious. Looked like the key really did its job, then. Now, the more pressing matter was
When he felt better, he looked up and took in the scenery. It smelled heavenly. The flowers were beautiful, pastel pinks and blues and white peeking through the grass or swaying slightly above it in the light breeze. Steve could hear the trill of birds, water gurgling near his feet, leaves rustling behind him. They were on the edge of a grass field, streaked with small water streams, with a forest behind them. In the distance, there were majestic snow-covered mountains. At the edge of the treeline, there was a mansion, its red bricks completely covered in vines. There was a path winding into the forest, leading to what looked like a village, if the puffs of smoke in the distance were any indication. Stark was walking towards the mansion. Steve followed after him, wondering if this was one of Stark’s houses.
He’s striding forward and grabbing Steve’s wrist before he knows what he’s doing. There’s a small line of blood that has travelled down Steve’s arm, dividing into rivulets and patterns on Steve’s hand, pooling on the fine membrane between Steve’s thumb and index. As Tony picks the wrist up, the blood drips onto the gauntlet of his armour, crimson blending with crimson. He’s touching Steve, is touching Steve’s blood. The smell is cloying, so close to his nostrils. He wants to drown in it.
“Is it… it’s just out in the
As soon as he set foot into the Waste, he felt the magic of the Witch, trying to ensnare him, trying to make him fall, trying to catch him and kill him. But he kept running, mindless of the dry air, mindless of the stench of death around him. He kept running, straight forward, certain that if he ran fast and long enough, he’d find her.
What do you say to your best-friend-turned-mortal-enemy in his last moments? What do you say to the man that you’ve loved for the better part of your adult life? Do you confess? Do you beg for forgiveness? Do you try to ease his worries? Do you offer him empty platitudes to make it hurt less?
As if she could hear his thoughts, Miss O’Casta stopped in front of a wooden drawer and picked up a piece of paper.
It's high time someone brought Steve down a peg or two.
“No, you must have mistaken me for my uh, my cousin, he looks like me, but taller.”
Somewhere deep inside of Steve, a part of him breathed out in relief.
One of the older ladies interrupted her: “Do you really believe those stories? About him stealing—”
, Tony. You can sell magic and I can sell paintings and supplies and we’ll find a way to combine the two into something even better.”
was he speaking to it? What did the scarecrow have to say?
A flash outside of the door illuminated the whole room, waking the dog, reflecting in Tony’s wide eyes.
Steve steeled himself and put his foot on the first step. Immediately, he felt a current sweep through him, leaving his fingers tingling and toes curling. The stairs were imbued with magic, it was oozing off of them, and Steve started to believe there might be an undercurrent of truth to the rumours.
“You’re not Tony.”
Dinner was a quiet affair, Stark not being his usually talkative self. In a somewhat desperate attempt to get him to talk, Steve mentioned the King: when was Stark going to the audience? It fulfilled its purpose, because Stark started gesturing and talking animatedly about how he could absolutely not accept the request. The King was making a mistake, he proclaimed. Everyone knew that it was a bad idea to appoint Stark as the Sorcerer Supreme, especially after the former one had been defeated by the Witch of the Waste. The King had sent a new letter, requesting that Stark present himself at the court within the week, and what was Stark to do?
Steve steps in, and glares at Tony. His stance is battle ready, but he doesn’t attack right away, and Tony thinks they might break the circle of violence this time.
Steve wondered what part of Stark’s past was hidden in the mansion.
He can’t see straight.
He growled underneath his breath as he walked back to the kitchen. He didn’t want to do anything. He didn’t want to draw, he didn’t want to be in the shop, he just wanted Tony to be okay, but that was the
“I—I need to work on my armour.”
He desired it.
As for Stark… He felt a little bad that he was being led on like that, but not enough to pity him. Stark was bound to fall into such a trap sooner or later, anyhow, with his propensity for courting every pretty thing he laid his eyes upon.
You get used to living in the streets very quickly. You know where to sleep, how to avoid the cops, which doorways are free and which parks stay open all night.
Their attacker is gone, the gun has disappeared. Sharon falls to her knees next to Tony, her eyes wide and glazed over.
“Thank you.”
He's surrounded by armed men, the armour susurates.
Steve didn’t like how familiar she was being with them. Jarvis had given his full name, and Steve followed suit.
Extremis goes haywire and rushes the symbiote into forming into his armour as he gets spit out on the other side. It whispers into his brain what he can already see with his own eyes: he's not in his own time anymore. Not in his Seattle mansion, either.
At least he wasn’t planning on dying alone, then, if he’d said he would come back.
There was nothing to do but cleaning things up and going to bed.
Any hopes of deescalating the situation flew right out the window.
But what he looked like didn’t matter. He was the eldest of the Rogers’, which meant he would always stay here, in his little house, sell his painting supplies, and maybe find someone to share his life with, most probably another eldest who couldn’t leave the town either. It wouldn’t be too bad, he reasoned. He had already spent 26 years in this town, why not his whole life? Either way, dwelling on his fate wouldn’t do him any good. He’d had the misfortune to be born as the oldest sibling, and there was nothing to be done about it.
He stood in front of the teahouse for a long while, trying to understand, half-hoping that the mysterious magician would come back. Of course, nothing of the sort happened, and Steve resigned himself to never seeing the stranger again and walked home.
It wasn’t supposed to happen like this, Tony thinks.
Tony’s getting sloppy. He needs to be more careful of what he says, lest he gives too much away to Steve. There’s no need to complicate things further. Besides, it wouldn’t be welcomed by Steve.
“I—I’m sorry. Do you mean Stark and Potts are the same person?”
He couldn’t believe it. Why did everything have to go wrong with Stark and Steve?
dead. Did he mean that he would literally die, or would he change as the Witch of the Waste had changed? Would he turn into an evil man? Would he be unrecognisable to those who had known him beforehand?
He killed Steve.
Steve was frozen in place, realising he’d made a mistake. It wasn’t that he thought Stark was capable of it, it was just that he didn’t understand what else could explain the lack of income.
“Don’t worry, this is just a spell to keep intruders away. Just take my hand and step into the black.”
“She wanted—she needed someone close to Steve Rogers. But. But she couldn’t get to Natasha, because Shield’s wards protect her. But I wasn’t a part of Shield. I was just a soldier that’d met Natasha and fall—fallen in love with her. When I left again to fight against the Latverians, the Witch caught me and c—cursed me. She has control of my arm. I can’t—if I tried anything, she would—I couldn’t
, Steve?”
“I feel—there’s a weight in my chest.”
“You’ll find that a lot of what they say about me is less than true, miss. If you would like to spend some time with me, I could show you how wrong they are.”
“Are you alright?”
“Shit!”
He can’t come up with a good reason to keep fighting, so he lies there, and waits for something to happen.
Steve wasn’t supposed to die.
Was that a part of his curse, maybe? That he hadn’t just lost his body, but his mind as well? Maybe he was in his bed, and this all was just a dream. It would surely make his life easier.
He blinked tiredly at Strange, then snapped himself awake once he realised who was standing in front of him.
Where’s the bottle? He had it… He had it just now, he’s sure of it, and if his hand could just stop shaking—
He was in what might be a kitchen, but cluttered full of diverse objects and apparatus. If he squinted, he could see the hint of the outline of a sofa on one end of the room, facing a hearth where some embers were still glowing. On the other end, there was a table covered in dirty plates and pots and pans, with food throwed haphazardly on it. There had to be a faucet somewhere, but he couldn’t see it. There was a chandelier with a few of the candles burning, the others half melted or simply not there. The room was stacked full of books, parchments, papers, tools, metal plates and parts, pouches filled with herbs and bizarre plants. On the fireplace mantel, there was an array of sinister objects: fangs, bits of fur, and several skulls, with one that was notable in that it was a
“I don’t want to do it without you. We just moved here, and you said we would have the shop together. Don’t break your promises.”
How could Steve have ignored that? How could he live with this fiend, how could he help him, when he knew what he did during the nights? Steve was just as bad as Stark if he didn’t say anything about it. How could he? How could he smile and laugh with Stark, turn a blind eye just because the man was charming?
Excessive consumption of alcohol can lead to iron deficiency and anemia. If Stark men are made of iron, and Tony doesn’t have enough of it, then what is he?
Jarvis was looking even worse than when Steve had left him. He was just glowing faintly, his core exposed by the lack of flames. He pulsed gently, the soothing pulse of the blue glow enough to make Steve want to sleep again. He was
“Oh, please, call me Tony. I think we can, uh, stop with the formalities now that you know who’s behind the mask.”
Tony’s gut churns.
A small voice teased at the back of Steve’s mind. It sounded disturbingly like Natasha’s voice. And what was that supposed to mean? Of course Steve would be alright with whoever Stark wanted to bring home. It wasn’t illegal to have some fun.
Tony walked very carefully into the centre of the biggest circle. He put his feet together, standing tall with one arm outstretched sideways and the other holding Jarvis in front of him. The circles were pulsing blue now, the light having dimmed as Tony had walked into the circle, but steadily growing stronger as Tony chanted under his breath. Tony’s hair spread out, his tunic billowing. The pulsing light grew stronger, and Jarvis swayed where he was, burning brighter and brighter until he let out a hiss and
“That’s such a shame, I so wanted to talk to him. Could I wait here until he comes back? I really want to see him.”
Tony was right at the edge of the desert, staring into the distance, his body still. Was there something in the desert? Steve squinted at the horizon, but all he could see was sand, sand, and more sand.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay. You’re okay. I know it’s hard. I know this isn’t, that it wasn’t supposed to be like this. But we’re here now, and we gotta make the best of what we got. You’re here, and I’m with you, and you can do this, okay? We all have bad days. The hardest part is getting out of bed. It’ll go smoother after, trust me. Shhhh, It’s okay.”
looked at Steve miserably, that night in the paint supply shop.
The scarecrow pushed, and Steve pushed back, but he changed strategy when it became clear that they were evenly matched. He tipped the shield up, catching the underside of the scarecrow’s head with the shields’ rim, sending him flying back with the uppercut. Steve watched in satisfaction as the scarecrow tumbled in the grass, disappearing down the hill.
Maybe someone could help him?
Tony’s mind is alight with questions, already trying to find a way to make it make sense, he’s trying to bend it into something at least fractionally scientific.
He deactivates his suit when Steve punches him straight on the Repulsor Core One. To anyone, it’ll look like Steve broke his suit. After all, it’s happened before, right? Steve always manages to break Tony’s armours before he can seriously hurt him.
He hoped it would help.
a heart attack? Tony, what’s wrong with your heart?” Cap was so pale, you’d think it was his own heart that was failing.
They don’t need him to keep things running, anyway. He can delegate, he can, he can make things work. Just for today. Just a few hours, until he feels better.
Steve will think the same. Steve will see him, and his gaze will be cold as ice, his irises frozen blue. Or, worse, his gaze will slide past Tony, and Tony will know that everything they once were is gone.
They avoided the more serious subjects neatly. Sometimes, it was just easier to pretend that everything was fine.
After lunch, Steve worked on the spells for Anthony’s Sorcery, which were in a neat pile of paper on the table. One was a good luck charm, another one was to help someone draw better (Steve painted a flower and put it in a bottle, the flower was moving around on his paper. He wasn’t surprised anymore, it happened sometimes when he drew now. Steve’s theory was that there was magic in the air in the castle and that it permeated the objects lying around), yet another one was for belly ache. But the spell he had picked up now was…weird. It wasn’t a request, wasn’t a simple charm. Instead, it almost read like a poem.
Jarvis’ voice resonated around him, cracklier in the enclosed space, but somehow more intimate as well. Steve settled down. It made sense that Jarvis had some kind of control of the armour, since he controlled the castle. It had to be more difficult to control a whole building than a mere suit, so Steve should be just fine.
They gazed at each other, both smiling softly.
He didn’t need any more nasty surprises.
The guilty look the man shot him was answer enough. It didn’t make any sense. Steve knew that Tony could be serious if he wanted to, and everything pointed to him being utterly serious about the curse against his life. So why was he wasting time on courting a woman that wasn’t even interested in him?
“Ahhhh…My head—I can’t—I don’t—Where is this coming from, there’s something I need to say but I don’t know why and it hurts so
“I hate to say it, but you’re right, J. Ten thousand days, was it? That would bring it to about
“Wasn’t Doctor Strange the court sorcerer?”
Tony’s heart was literally in his hands now.
—are you okay?” Tony rasped out. He really shouldn’t be talking.
“You wanted to walk all the way there? But that would have taken a day at least! Why didn’t you say anything? I could have taken you with me!”
It was very late, but Steve still needed to arrange and present the new brushes he’d made that morning in the shop window, and he doubted he would be able to sleep, his blood still pumping from the near-death experience. It always calmed him to prepare the store for the coming day, arranging the brushes, stacking the canvases, drawing a little something on a sheet of paper with the charcoal to show its quality, sweeping the tiles one last time.
Jarvis was busy fending the shadows off, his glow brightening and dimming in a rhythm known only to him. He shouted at Steve, who was already at the foot of the staircase, to go faster and douse Stark in warm water once he was in the tub. Steve concentrated on dragging Stark without missing a step.
And now he was just making a fool of himself. Thankfully, Jarvis cut him off.
Steve scowls at him, frowns down at his hands, and when nothing happens after a minute, growls a little. Tony is quick to placate him, because he really doesn’t want Steve to be even angrier than he already is.
And yet, the face looking back at him in the mirror was undeniably his own.
“Exactly! That’s good! You can also mention my suits: I’m good with objects, automatons, armours, but not people.”
Steve had a myriad of questions, but he didn’t utter a single word while he was being led through the streets until they stopped before a teahouse. The stranger turned to Steve, then, his smile binding, asking if he would fancy a cup of tea?
Steve takes one look at him, and throws the shield right at Tony’s head, running at full sprint towards him, barely dodging his warning shots. He’s on Tony in an instant, and Tony lifts off, because he doesn’t want to be on the ground, and maybe Steve’ll calm down if he can’t reach Tony. But Steve is too stubborn to let go, and they smash into the ceiling instead, hard enough for Steve to cry out and squeeze Tony’s arm until the metal starts to dent. Steve’s bleeding from a head wound, but his eyes are clear when he stares into the faceplate, piercing right through Tony, and he’s still furious and this is going to end with another one of them dying if Tony doesn’t
Steve’s heart unclenched, his relief that Natasha wasn’t falling for Stark all-encompassing. He was disappointed that he wouldn’t be able to meet her, but it was good enough knowing that what he’d been afraid of wasn’t going to happen. But he didn’t like the manipulative streak of Lord Fury and liked even less that he was roping Natasha into his machinations. There wasn’t much he could do about it, though.
Tony didn’t come home in the evening, and after a quiet dinner with James, Steve went to bed. He thought he’d be too worked up to sleep, but with everything that had happened that day, Steve fell asleep in minutes.
He was happy for Natasha, of course, and glad that she was going to live up to her amazing potential. It had always been this way: Natasha had always been excellent at anything she cared to do. She danced like no other, made the finest brushes for the painting supplies they sold in the shop, was smart and cunning and beautiful to boot. Next to her, Steve had always felt clumsy and overgrown. He was tall and muscular, all thanks to the heavy lifting he did in the docks when he needed extra money (which was more often the case than not), and while he liked feeling strong, he knew he could look a bit intimidating. Natasha always told him that his baby blue eyes and blond hair made him look like a powerful angel, but he preferred her grace and flaming red locks. If he was an angel, then she was a nymph.
“He wants you to understand that he is utterly inadequate for the position. He has given me several arguments; Stark is infamous for his hedonism; he is self-centred. I live with him, and more often than not, he interrupts me when we talk, he doesn’t let me finish speaking, he has even left in the middle of conversations before. You could argue that he only thinks about himself, that he doesn’t care about other people, but, well, I’m the living example of the contrary, he’s really considerate, did you know that he helps people in need?”
Tony’s with a woman he almost loves, and they could almost be cuddling. They’re wrapped around each other, sucking the warmth from each others’ body and leaving too little in return. His teeth are shattering.
“Go away, Steve.”
It was Tony’s turn to be confused. He’d never seen or heard anything about a red and gold armour. Was this one of the new projects of the Army? Tony hadn’t given them, or SHIELD, anything on his own suit, and the Nazi Arsenal did
He shot up from the couch, rage burning through his veins, and started throwing everything he could find at the walls. He should burn this whole place down, he should alert the authorities, he should warn the King, he should, he should—
Tony could be dreaming.
—Stark, you need to—it’s too late—
Steve stared at the door, silently thanking the gods that Stark had accepted his flimsy excuse so readily, and decided to inspect the castle before he started cleaning it.
“Cap, there’s something I have to tell you. Or rather, show you.”
The next weeks went on in much the same way. Steve tidied up, cleaned, cooked, and generally made himself as helpful as possible. All in all, he turned the castle from a troll cave to a homey and cosy place. When they weren’t cluttered full, the rooms where beautiful. Steve liked this castle, he realised.
Miss O’Casta was at the door, a hopeful smile on her face. What did she want now? Steve scowled as he tried to listen to the conversation behind him. What where they saying about hearts?
Steve won’t let Tony skip the sparring. After a few shouting matches (except that’s not true. They haven’t had real shouting matches since the one on the Helicarrier. In fact, Steve and Tony get along well. Too well), the self-destructive not-so-insignificant part of Tony rears its ugly head and whispers that Tony might just as well accept if Steve’s the one to spar with Tony. After all, Tony’s been hungering after a more hands-on encounter with Steve. This isn’t exactly how Tony’s been imagining it, but it’s close enough. Tony accepts, and Steve marches him down to the gym to spar right this instant.
Steve grabbed his shield and let his smile drop.
It’s too late, now, isn’t it? Tony’s sealed his own fate. He’s gotten a taste, and it wasn’t enough. It’s only a matter of time before he comes back for more. Tony can’t wait to taste Steve again.
Tony told Steve to dress in the best clothes he had, which were naturally the clothes that the man himself had given him. Steve ended up picking a light blue shirt and white pants. It was unpretentious and stylish; the blue made the colour of his eyes stand out. When he walked to the kitchen, Stark was waiting for him, looking intently at him.
Steve opened the door again, and there it was, the fireplace, the messy kitchen, and Jarvis, still looking at him, and was he laughing?
The world doesn’t seem so harsh anymore. He’s relaxed. Calmer than he’s ever been, he thinks. He’s ready. He’s ready to sleep. To slip into it. Steve will wake him up.
He can hear again, and the noise is from the ship-wide alarm. They’re under attack. He needs to take action, they need him to be in command, he has a job to do, people to protect, enemies to defeat.
Step by step, he walked towards the shop. Step by step, he dragged Tony with him, until he got used to the weight, until his muscles weren’t screaming with exertion, until he got his breathing under control again. He didn’t know where the additional energy had come from, but suddenly he knew that he was strong enough to properly carry Tony. He hoisted him up in his arms, one arm under Tony’s shoulders and the other under his knees. He put the shield on top of Tony’s chest, underneath one of his limp arms.
Tony was… Tony was here!
His grip on the pen tightened.
It was too fast for Steve to make out a coherent sentence, and seeing Tony so agitated only increased Steve’s nervousness. What could they do? What was going to happen now? Should they flee? Ask the King or miss Potts for help? Could they even help?
It was shifting colour, the raven black bleeding out to leave a pale blond behind, which in turn darkened to an orange hue, which turned red, then purple, then blue, green, pink. It stayed pink for a while until it started darkening again until it reached a dark brown. All the while, Stark was moaning and shivering.
Steve would do it all in one fell swoop: prepare himself for his meeting with the King and come further with his own investigations (that had been on hold for too long).
“Oh, yes. I’m healed already, thank you.”
The armour is whole, perfect, strong. A bullet would never pierce it. It’s the pinnacle of human technology, so cutting-edge that it really belongs in the future. It wasn’t fully assembled when the gun was fired.
Tony can only nod.
. It made Steve want to pick one up and look at it, look at the small arms and claws and how they were moving and how they worked. But most of all, he wanted to sit down in the middle of the bric-a-brac and paint it.
Tony loudly cleared his throat.
“What’s wrong?”
“This isn't Mr. Stark, he came out of nowhere, I don’t know who he is or why he says he’s Mr. Stark.”
Tony smiled awkwardly. He had no idea who Thor was, but Jarvis was a familiar name. A little too familiar. A lot of coincidences were piling up.
Maybe he was losing his eyes to the cold.
He was slow, and cold, and probably dying, but he couldn’t find the energy to care.
He took a step forward, determined to make her talk, but when he opened his mouth again, he found he couldn’t utter a sound. His body was stuck in the same paralysis as the night he’d been cursed. He couldn’t move, and this felt awfully familiar. The Witch sauntered towards him, cackling lightly.
That would make things easier. If neither Natasha nor Stark were seriously interested in each other, there wouldn’t be any hurt feelings when the courtship ended. Steve didn’t approve of Stark’s frivolous courting, but it was better than him loving his sister.
Tony had been talking to Jarvis.
, Natasha-voice reminded him. He hadn’t told Tony about his curse, first of all, and even if Tony had known, Steve had still been convinced that it was a secret. He had also kept to himself the fact that he was trying to break the contract between Jarvis and Tony. Not to mention that he hadn’t told Tony that he’d seen him as a child. Or that he’d tried to sneak behind his back in one of his own armours.
“You’d need to be closer to me. I think I could hug you, if we were closer.”
A whimpering moan escapes Tony’s lips. He’s beyond speaking. There’s a tear track down one of Steve’s cheeks. He’s blinking sluggishly up at Tony, and Tony forgets what he wanted to say. Forgets everything but the colour of ice, of death-kissed lips, of eyes so clear you can see the shifts of the light on them.
It couldn’t be—no one knew where fire demons came from, no one had seen any fire demon that wasn’t already bonded to a human. Was it because—
The moment he kept the gauntlet on instead of sending it to decontamination along with the rest of the suit, he abandoned all pretence. The only thing that’s going to happen to that blood is that Tony is going to lick it up. Like a dog slobbering over a bone, Tony will lick his own hand, clean it up until there isn’t anything left. He thinks that if Steve were in his shoes, he’d do the same. Reason flies out of the window when super-soldier blood is involved. It’s there, it smells like addiction, and now Tony can get a taste. It will ruin him, ruin him for any blood other than Steve’s. Drinking animal blood is already disgusting enough as it is. When he gets his first taste of Steve’s blood, he won’t even be satisfied with regular human blood, he can feel it. It’s not enough of a deterrent to keep him from putting his mouth to his own wrist, in a parody of a kiss. He sucks, and the taste explodes on his tongue, in his mouth, behind his teeth. The high is instantaneous. He’s floating, or maybe he’s falling, his legs not strong enough to hold him upright. This is what absolute bliss feels like. Drugs, alcohol, sex have
“You won’t tell me, but can you give me a hint?”
very sorry for the late chapter, I was so caught up in the MTH frenzy that I completely forgot about this. whoops.
There was a man standing between Steve and the soldier.
Steve would rather die than live without Tony.
They were closer than before, weren’t they? Had they been so close, that their breaths were intermingling, that Steve could count Tony’s every eyelash, that he could feel the puff of warmth as Tony licked his lips, as they leaned into their shared space and—
When will it finally end, he wonders.
But Tony was gone. Could Steve do anything? Miss Potts had said that he had some magic abilities. Well, his spells might not be very powerful, but something was better than nothing at all.
“No…”
He wondered if he was dead, and this was where the Witch had sent him.
Right.
He thought about seeing falling stars.
He’d had worse odds. He thought.
He doesn’t care about anyone other than himself. He’s just going to screw them all over, and he can’t even feel bad about it. What is
They both turned back to Tony. Cap said, in a calm and deliberate voice:
“I don’t think I will, are you even listening to yourself—”
“I thought that Dr. Strange was dead?”
He’d drink until he was sated, and then he would dump their body somewhere it would never be found. He’d fly down, and go back into the fight, and no one would have noticed that he’d been gone for at least fifteen minutes.
“When I was, uh, younger, I had a, how do you say, brief little
Tony, by confessing that he hadn’t flirted seriously with Jocasta, had just fulfilled the last condition of his curse.
“Steve. Do you know what’s going on?”
Sure enough, it’s only a few minutes before the familiar scent invades Tony’s senses and the back of his neck prickles. He turns around to face Steve. He’s wearing his uniform, cowl down. He’s standing in parade rest, his shoulders drawn back tight, his chin high, hands behind his back. The blush high on his cheeks undermines the steely resolve in his eyes. Tony inhales through his nose. Under the alluring scent, there’s a tremor of fear. Steve is here for Tony, then. He’s going to lay everything out in the open. No more hiding, no more innuendos, no stolen glances. This is it.
“If you insist. I do think it’d be more convenient for me to wait here, by the fire, it’s a bit chilly in my house.”
It’s Christmas, and he’s got something to celebrate. He’s toasting to the end of living. His end, to be exact.
He took off his shoes, although he regretted that decision as soon as he stepped into a puddle of unidentified goop. He padded over to the hearth, relishing in the heat. He still felt weak, but he managed to put two logs on the embers and blew new life into the flame. The flame flickered a little, its heart a bright blue that contrasted with the purple, orange and red of the edges of the fire. Then a tendril licked one of the logs and gained purchase on the wood. Steve watched in rapt fascination as the flame seemed to move
It sounded just as sentimental out loud as it had been in his head.
He’s on the floor, bottle in hand, watching the smoke billow above him. In a few minutes, the fire will reach his room, and he’ll be dead. He wonders if the alcohol in his blood will make him light up, a bright flame that will consume itself in seconds. Or maybe he’ll suffocate before then.
The colours were pretty. Steve liked blue the most though.
Oh, right, the Witch! Steve had completely forgotten about her.
There’s still wine in the bottle. It’d be a waste to let the fire evaporate it. He should drink it. At least he’ll go down doing something he loves. (Loving something and being addicted to something is the same, right?)
Should Steve confront him about the lie, or should he play along?
“I was a soldier in the war. I got frozen for a while, and Tony and the Avengers found me.”
He coughs.
Stark was gone,
Tony. He stopped arguing, instead putting down ideas for what to do about Tony. They were now in deep conversation, bodies angled together, close enough for their shoulders to touch.
“You were the falling star that Tony caught all those years ago, weren’t you?”
The tension in the room isn’t as thick anymore. Steve takes a step back, and waves Tony up, eyes steely and body tense.
He pushes himself up, meaning to activate his suits, make Steve vent his frustrations on his armours, but Steve sees him move and slams into him.
. It’s not worth it. He can stay in bed. Just a day. His therapist told him he should listen to his body more, take a break. This is self-care, right?
There had to be a loophole Steve could use. Maybe he could play a game of “yes or no” with Jarvis, and hope that if he guessed right about what Tony had given him, Jarvis would say “yes” and that would break the contract.
“What about the marks on your chest? How did you get them?”
Hearing her dismiss his entire existence in one swoop was enough for Steve to flush angrily. If she wanted to insult him like that, she could do it outside the shop, and now. He stepped forward, ready to make her leave, but she raised a finger, and he found himself unable to move.
“Cap, trust me on this, but this can
mean nothing to you?
Steve tried to laugh it off.
The scarecrow mumbled something at James, who translated:
Stark’s eyes were sad. He shook his head.
Steve was floating in the dark, voices whispering in his ears.
Steve is
how low he’s come? And selling useless things, as well. You wouldn’t happen to be a noble or a knight in disguise, would you? No? You’re just a poor kid, aren’t you? You don’t even have the money to buy proper clothes. To think that when I finally get the right one, he’s just some peasant. Incredible. After all the effort I went through to find you, this is quite disappointing. It’s a shame, really. But that doesn’t matter. I just need to remove the concurrence.”
He was pulled out of his thoughts by Stark gesturing at him.
But even as he said the words, he didn’t have his usual self-assured expression. He knew that he wasn’t believable, but tried regardless, and Steve knew he had him.
He’s going insane. The psychologist was right; he’s out of control. He’s fucked up.
Much love from me to all of you.
As if summoned by the words, Tony groaned and woke up.
. The super-serum-enhanced blood, to be even more precise. The serum drives Tony crazy. It elevates the scent of Steve’s blood from enjoyable to tantalizing. It’s suffocating, it’s all Tony can think about. He wants to wrap himself up in the smell, follow it to its source, sink his teeth into yielding flesh, and
He clears his throat, almost bursts into tears again when it scratches a little too much, and speaks.
They danced around each other, Steve evading their attacks, but never managing to get in range to punch or kick them. They were skilled, even with their senses dulled by alcohol, and made sure to keep him far enough that they could reach him with their bayonets, but not so close that he could touch them. They hadn’t tried to shoot him yet, but Steve knew it was only a matter of time before one of them remembered they could kill him at a distance. His best chance was to run away, but during the scuffle, they had managed to crowd Steve into a dead-end. He was going to be trapped like a hare in a snare, ripe for the killing.
Tony was working himself up, still too pale, his hands still claws. His feathers were falling, but new ones were growing, Tony’s agitation proving too much for his health.
Steve thought back to his nightmare.
“Tony Stark, at your service. It’s complicated.”
And Steve... Steve became Hydra, took over the country, and summoned Tony here. It's obvious that he needs Tony. What a pity that Tony doesn't need him back.
Captain America is in front of him, his eyes tell him.
Steve is not a man that Tony can put into neat little boxes. He’s tried, but just when he thinks he knows who Steve is, a new side of his personality makes itself known. Steve is so much more than a soldier. He’s so much more than the man out of time. He’s devastatingly intelligent, emotional to a fault, and predictable until he isn’t.
Steve couldn’t stop his eyebrows from raising at the obvious lie.
His vision is turning black at the edges. How many seconds already?
“How are you—what did you—please tell me there’s a way to make it better.”
“You’re all alone. Natasha has someone else now, Tony doesn’t love you, you don’t even have friends.”
