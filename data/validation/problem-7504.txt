Sam confirmed the words with a grimace, remembering the shift on Tony's face – from excitement and happiness for his friends being there and the pizza, to a frightened child crossed with an angry lupine creature who would have pounced him had he not left immediately.
As Tony and Steve however, the disagreements were forever lasting. They'd fight tirelessly, shouting and arguing over such trivial matters that sometimes Steve thought Tony disagreed just to get a rise from him – just to get him angry. He wouldn't put it past the man, honestly. He probably knew how those arguments affected Steve, too. The man had his creepy super-computer spy after his teammates – all of them were quite sure of that, how could Steve know if the man hadn't watched him while he…
So Bruce left him, and as he walked out Tony was suddenly completely silent, only the machines attached to him are still proving he is even alive with a loud beeping noise every few seconds. Bruce was no longer sure that is a good enough indication.
The Hulk and Thor took the brunt of it, both seemed more than determined to destroy every piece of weaponry they could get their hands on, and were quite successful in that endeavor, too. Natasha thought she could imagine Tony's face if he saw the two of them ripping through his defense systems so seamlessly, without a hitch, only once or twice struggling to shake off a stubborn missile, which would be then intercepted by the war machine armor. It was a mixture of horror and amusement and concealed pride in his friends.
The rest of the visit was short but a lot more lighthearted, Tony made fun of the huge teddy bear while also hugging and refusing to let go of it because it was so soft. He was smiling brightly when Pepper talked about how the employees of the New-York offices all chipped in to buy and send gifts and flowers -apparently so many that she had to divert all the deliveries to his rooms at the tower. They agreed that everyone was to receive a nice, fat bonus with their next paycheck.
A large bit damaged yet functional War Machine armor stood in sentinel mode next to where Tony's bed would've been had he been there but was now an empty spot. It's empty and emotionless eyes surveying the room and scanning everyone who entered. Natasha, who sat on the bed on the other side of the room, looked at it warily.
He couldn't remember how or when he fell asleep – Bruce had been there, outside his room, trying to convince JARVIS to let him talk to Tony, he apologized over and over and the regret in his voice almost made Tony cave and let him in,  but then he started trying to convince Jarvis that letting him come in was in Tony's best interest, and explained to him what he thought was the true nature of their predicament – It would take time but Tony would eventually have to understand, have to accept that what he thought happened was not in fact true. Bruce wasn't stupid, he knew Tony was listening and watching through the Armor's eyes.
Rhodey didn't want the job at first. Ok, no, FALSE. Rhodey wanted the job. Rhodey wanted to go back to active duty, but he couldn't. because of Tony. because Steve was getting out and Tony couldn't be left alone because he couldn't protect himself any more. It caused a rapture between them, awkward – since Rhodey still refused to leave his side, which Tony resented.
Until it was needed, all Steve wanted was to keep Tony safe, and to keep Tony
Steve froze a moment, questions running through his mind – how had he not recognized a heart attack? Was Tony faking it?
The hospital room is a mess. Rhodey stood there for what seemed like hours, looking at the ruined medical equipment, broken bed and the bits of metal, jaggedly torn, dented in the form of fists. The armors, all three of them, were scattered around the room in the same way. Scorch marks tainted the once cream-colored walls…  and the window was broken. it was a mess – violent, inhuman. And all through him, Rhodey knew – it was all done by Steve Grant Rogers.
Steve stood still, wearily staring at him. "You know I didn't want to hurt you, Tony…" he said, taking a step forward, "this is not what I wanted…"
And yet, exiting the elevator Tony found himself breathing a little harder, pressing his hand against is chest just to make sure his heart was still beating. He took his inhaler- Breathing device out of his pocket and took a long whiff, shutting his eyes as Jarvis turned on the lights to reveal the ransacked room.
Not really refused, not that he was on a hunger strike or something. He simply couldn't hold anything down in his stomach.
And wasn't that unfortunate.
Steve was by his side too quickly, overwhelming Tony out of anything he meant to say. He was staring at him, his body language tense – not that it ever been not-tense – and out of nowhere asked: "Do you love me?"
He made his way to the facility the next day, given the special clearance needed for him to step out of that apartment. He ignored the small cuff beeping around his ankle as he passed the threshold and sending the information to Ross' people, ignored the voice telling him he was just a puppet for the military to play with, now. Once he and Tony were united again, this was all going to resolve itself.
Tony inhaled it hungrily and reached to grab with flimsy fingers at Steve's wrist in an attempt to convey his need for it to stay where it was and not move away.
He had kept it up, for the last few years. Fought irredeemable maniacs and outright villains on the virtue of his words alone. The cracks always kept under a considerable amount of snarky comments and jabs. It had worked every time.
Bruce sighed deeply, not answering for a while as he looked back at all of his teammates. "It's a delicate situation, Clint… I can't say his behavior is completely unreasonable." He sat down and held his head between his hands, his shoulders shook slightly, almost unnoticeable to anyone with human-level observation skill, but to a group of super spies and super-humans, it was all too obvious how discouraged and tired the man was.
He was so tired, he barely grasped the meaning of Pepper’s words. What she thought happened... “That- wait, what? no, we haven’t…” he knew it was meaningless, she’d already made the decision to come over, which meant she was booking a flight as soon as the conversation was over. “it’s not about Steve, Pep. I just needed some me time.”
Bruce couldn't have that. "I'm sure Tony would be delighted to see you, Steve." He said, widening his smile, "He is alive thanks to you. We wouldn't have found the location until it was too late if you didn't pass us a message, and removing all that debris from his chest probably saved his life even before that."
– moaning and giggling under him as he pushed in, too big to go all at once, an inch by inch turning his lover into a heap of lustful mess. Tony moaned and gasped beneath him, his breath rate too fast and short to be of any actual help to his damaged lungs. Then suddenly he whimpered loudly under him. His eyes blowing wider and filling with yet more tears. Steve made further effort to push inside him now, groaning when Tony clenched around him. "Yes, love… you are so good." He attempted to reassure him when Tony made another desperate sound, "So well… you are doing so well, you know that? Feels so good…" the gasps and whimpers continued and accelerated as Steve picked up the pace, burying himself as deep as he could before pulling put and then repeating once again. "Ssh, sweetheart…" he murmured and brushed his lips against Tony's forehead when a gasp came to close to being a scream, disrupting his fantasy. "Be good. I'm trying to help, ok? Just trying to help."
"I hate you. Hate you. Hate you." Tony repeated the mantra as Steve carried him to their bed, dressed him in warm, clean clothes he'd bought on his outing and tucked him in under warm and thick blankets. He suffered through the repetitive chant, only sometimes interrupted by a cough or a series of dry heaves onto the air. The bluish color of Tony's skin was not going away, in fact it got slightly more pronounced around his lips and fingers, he was shaking uncontrollably now, his heart beat loud and faster than normal.
But… when Tony finally managed to open his eyes and blinked to get rid of the heavy dizziness, he became convinced that he was stuck in a nightmare and could not truly wake up.
"Yeah," he said, grabbing his kit-bag, "but you need to keep your promise to Bruce and get a few hours of sleep every night. And take your meds, Tony. that's non-negotiable."
Clint ignored the sounds of the fight, dim as they were through the steel wall, in favor of a look around the room. It was the only other room in the cabin according to their blueprints, barring the bathroom. Not finding Tony there did not come as a surprise, even if it did squash what hopes and dreams he had of ever being able to do so. Bruce warned them that there might be no one left to rescue anymore, and their mission was to capture Steve from the get go. Neither he or Nat were too optimistic, it was a trait people in their line of work tended to lose early on.
He didn't speak, it seemed that Steve needed to unload some crap, and Tony hoped to find a justification he could agree with. Aliens made him do it. He was an alternative Steve from another dimension. He was brainwashed. an
told you. So what the
He pulled out his inhaler as he sat down, ignoring her piercing gaze as he took oxygen-enriched air deep into his lungs. She waited until he was done, surveying him from head to toe while Happy started the car despite her presence, determined to get them out of the lion's pit as soon as possible.
The voices his throat produced resembled an injured, trapped woodland critter. Steve remained insistent and ignored further attempts, using his other hand to take hold of Tony's waist and pull him into an embrace that left no space for needless struggles. "Let's get you back to bed, You're still recovering…"
After a brief talk with a doctor who had him sign several forms stating that he will listen and follow the Staff's directions and leave when asked to, Steve finally was directed to the room where Bucky was housed. It was a big room, similar to the one Tony used at the hospital in its luxuriousness and size, not at all what one would picture a room in a mental hospital to be like. Steve found that he was thankful for that. Bucky had suffered so much in the last couple of years, he deserved this. It did however make him feel unease, as in a place like this it would be so easy for Hydra to just come in and take him away again.
"Bruce… I…" he breathed in heavily, then exhaled as if trying to avoid another attack. Their hands found each other and Bruce squeezed Tony's reassuringly. "I promise, thank you."
When he lowered the shield, looking through the tendrils of smoke that filled the room, the thought for a moment that he was alone in the room again – he spotted Natasha just before she delivered a kick to his head and wrapped her thighs around his neck in an attempt to smother him or at least get him to disarm. She was nearly successful, but he sooner flung her across the room than dropped his shield – and just in time to see Clint pass through the door to the bedroom.
When nothing continued to happen for more minutes than any of them cared to count, the group once again fell into melancholy silence.
After hearing what they had to say, she never regretted having good ears and greater spy skills more.
Tony inhaled air and spat salt water and bile through his mouth roughly at the same time he struggled  up onto the board, which caused him to choke and nearly lose his grip on the slippery thing. His legs kicked at the water's surface frantically in his repetitive  failed attempts to climb the board. Finally, he stilled. His legs stopped kicking and remained dangling in the water while he breathed heavily, the side of his face and his chest were stuck  against the board surface, his eyes were wide-open in terror. His pupils darted around in panic as he tried, not very successfully, to remind himself that he was
Once Jarvis shut down the voice channel, Tony’s muscles lost all of its tension. His head felt airy and he slid down to the cluttered floor, holding on the table’s edge to keep himself from falling further. Dum-E chirped in the distance, but was concealed by the smoky layer that crept into his mind, and in seconds the haze  had isolated his mind entirely.
Steve took a step forward. "Yes, Tony. I am… I'm so happy you finally understand." He beamed, "We had a bit of a rough time, but we will do better, the avengers are gone, Bucky is back… everything is going to be much better when it's just the three of us, we don't need anyone else-"
Maybe it was Stockholm Syndrome, a variation of it? Did he care?
"What, what is it? Another invasion?" Sam walked to where Rhodes stood and took hold of his arm, stabilizing his shaky form. the man remained barely responsive, looking to be in shock from what-ever news he'd received on his phone. "Jim, Jim?"
Tony didn't answer, he didn't bother to mention that he'd just had a heart attack, or pose any argument against whatever Steve had planned. He knew that it would happen sooner or later – he expected it sooner, if he was being honest with himself. Every touch and every stroke against his skin made his mind turn on a deafening alarm – numb turned into hypersensitive, apathy into panic. The worst part was knowing that Steve would not rip into him mercilessly and be done with it as soon as possible – no, he would not do that. Instead, he would make it linger, take it slow and whisper loving nothings in his ear. He would do anything to make Tony enjoy it and respond to him, and he will succeed.
It was infuriating enough for Steve to break the kiss – and when he did Tony gasped again, a rasped groan leaving his throat as he attempted to bring in air with little success. Steve closed his eyes, imagined Tony –
"You have all heard the rumors." Tony stated. Increasing the volume of his voice to boost his own confidence in the words he was saying. "You heard the announcements, and the speculation. I am here today to set the record straight, and to… well, I'll keep that one until the end." He winked, earning an uncomfortable silence from everyone in the room.
Whoops, a week passed, and here's another chapter!
"When Sam came with me to visit Tony, he thought Sam was going to finish Rogers' Job by killing him." Rhodey had told them when a consensus about Rogers position in the group was met.
Tony tried slurring words of rejection, tried questioning Steve's actions but the words were stuck in his aching throat, what did come out sounded more like gasps and gargles. He felt something – fingers- crawling down the crack of his ass – slightly cool with slick – probably spit or blood? and oh, that was disgusting. Tony couldn't imagine anything worst right at that moment, but he was proved wrong promptly when everything went directly to hell.
"Jarvis…" he exhaled, "status?" his voice broke mid word as he took step after cautious step towards the body curled up on the floor, he could hear the war machine armor turning its head as it mapped and scanned the room.
He put on and strapped the oxygen mask to its place on Tony's face, noticing how it seemed to fit almost too perfectly, as if shaped specifically to his face, disturbingly like a permanent fixture. As he wondered if one day they could be rid of the sight, the dim sound of an explosion far closer than there should have been one made him get up and leave the room, closing it behind him with a silent sigh and his back to the door. It was hidden just as the entrance to the safe-house was, the door resembling a normal wall more than anything, and powerfully sealed against explosions and advanced lock picks alike.
"Rhodes combed through a freaking desert for three months when Tony went missing in Afghanistan, it's not that surprising." Clint said when Bruce questioned the sanity of going on scouting with no leads and no new information, "Everyone thought Tony was dead back then, too. But the bastard is really hard to kill and stubborn to a fault, the Colonel knows that better than any of us." the arrow he played with in his hand split into two pieces before his face softened, disheartened. "He is probably building himself another fucking armor right now and will free himself before we can even count to ten. Any minute now."
friends, helping with his campaign to extract the Winter Soldier from Hydra's grasp and taking down Shield and all those other things they did together. Her relationship with Steve was not based on her spying on him when they first met, at the very least.
What had he left? What worth was to his life if he couldn't make up for the pain he had caused, continued to cause with his mistakes and carelessness. A genius he wasn't – not when he couldn't see the darker side of things when they were right in front of him. First Hydra within SHIELD, for which he created machines to help with a murderous scheme he had no knowledge of, and Steve… whom he considered a friend, yet turned out to be this twisted and sick thing.
again. Fuck you, rapist." He closed his eyes immediately after saying the words, readying himself for the punishment he was sure would come, the backlash backed by the rage of the delusional Super-Soldier. It was stupid of him to say it, and he couldn't stop himself regardless.
He promised him, again, that they could have that.
Sorry for the delay, guys. please enjoy. :)
I haven't oiled Butterfingers in a while and he gets… you know, bitchy. I think. And… and get him to take the Spyder out for a spin. She needs the exercise…" he was rumbling again, about the bots and about his cars and then about Pepper and Happy and SI Board of Directors. He seemed distant and distracted, Bruce wasn't sure if Tony even knew he was even there anymore.
Well, death kinda took the humor out of this, at present.
"Tony, the goatee will grow back." He tried to sooth, attributing Tony's sudden change of behavior to his unexplainable attachment to his old look. "Put down the knife, and I'll give you a mirror so that you can see yourself... you look handsome – You should see." Without replying, Tony pressed the knife to his neck – not near any critical blood vessels yet, thankfully – but enough to draw blood. He looked scared - an expression so much more vivid and genuine now that the beard was gone.
He knew she could tell when he was using his Press smile, so he didn't try to use it on her just for the sake of fake comfort. He kept stroking her hair and letting her stay close as the car sled across the road in relative silence, until they arrived at the Avengers tower.
"Sir?" Jarvis' voice rung in his ears but had no follow-up, just waiting for him to ground himself and answer again. The AI was prohibited from calling Rhodey or Pepper unless the situation absolutely required it, a panic attack happened too often to warrant it, and Tony made sure to make that clear after too many accidents over the last few weeks.
He didn't open his eyes, not planning to fall into another nightmare featuring his friend as the maniacal rapist. He couldn't let his mind play any more games on him, had to find out what was going on but more importantly at that moment – had to get away from the touch of one Steve Rogers.
There was something deeply provoking in hearing Ross telling him, about a month after his release, that Bucky had been brought in before he ever had a chance to go look for him again, and by none other than Colonel James Rhodes.
"I was going to make him confess what he did to you… threaten him into giving me proof." Rhodey said quietly, "He tried to convince me that you are crazy and that I am crazy for believing you, and then he said he
Speaking of…
Tony froze at the invasive touches, he kept his eyes open as Steve leaned in to nuzzle his neck, staring at the ceiling. How long was it since Jarvis told him it'd be twenty minutes until the police arrived? He counted in his mind, letting himself escape from the scenario as the touches became more direct in their direction and intention.
command soldiers?"
Steve didn't feel up to it, he looked up at his friend's face and smiled weakly, apologizing. "I just… I need to stay around here for, well, you know. There's still a lot of paperwork to fill." Sam nodded, he probably knew Steve would be worried about Tony, but the real reason still eluded him.
First of all, he had to keep Tony safe. And that meant keeping him away from stress and loud noises, and from the interference by those who did not understand why all of this was necessary. Second… well, he was angry – justifiably so. Tony had shown no progress. He lied, pretended, manipulated him for his own gain once more. He deserved this, and it will no doubly benefit him more than it could do harm, anyway. Steve was even generous enough to let him have the breathing machine with him, so there should be no further complaints once they are secure again, once the Avengers give up and walk away, made aware finally that they were not needed or wanted near them, not at the moment.
I also have most of the next chapter ready so you can expect it soon - sadly, as I started my pretty intense study regime this week, next chapters might get delayed. So I hope you can be patient.
His skin pinpricked with goosebumps and he shivered.Even though he felt boneless and there was barely any strength left in his muscles, he still managed to curl his legs closer to his body in a semi-fetal position.
would fight by his side, as he always did, and they will win it together.
. Banner."
Clint coughed awkwardly and turned his eyes to Tony, whose prolonged unconsciousness became a disturbing worry on the front of everybody's mind. Next to his bed Rhodey was snoozing uneasily in an uncomfortable looking chair, his hand resting on the bed-rail and his head nodding on the line between sleep and wakefulness. Bruce told them he stayed awake since they returned from the rescue efforts hours after extracting Tony, and had roamed the infirmary since then trying and succeeding at locating his friend and accompanying him to every test and surgery. He urged them not to interrupt his slumber, so they kept their conversation over disgusting-hospital -lunch hushed down.
All of it, from the burning to the song in his head, it all stopped at once – leaving behind a silence that only the dead could bear, and cold that had him shaking violently, craving the heat from before. He was trapped in this nightmare, all too aware of it being a dream and yet unable to open his eyes to wake up. The notion of waking up felt too terrifying. If he opened his eyes would he see the two pools of the darkest black, nestled in a monstrous face, swirling? Would he be dragged down, breathless under the heavy weight of water?
Not one soul in the hospital questioned the need for the black and gold 'Iron Man' armor standing at Tony Stark's room door at the hospital – they all walked by it with a bit of awe in their eyes, some stopping to wave at the suit or try to coax a reaction from whoever is inside, just to fall on their asses – spooked when a metallic voice warned them about breaching the perimeter not being allowed for unauthorized personnel. After a few days, it became a fixture in the ward just like any other piece of furniture. The Doctors and the nurses paid it no mind as they entered the room undisturbed, greeted by James Rhodes, Pepper Potts or Happy Hogan with welcoming smiles. It seemed that no matter the hour – the man was never alone.
Fear settled deep in Tony's gut. 'Protect him'? did that mean he'd have to stay inside, closed off from the world again? Rhodey would not do that to him, he would not force him to stay. Of course not. But if Steve was out there, if he was coming for him… what else? Three suits of armor could not keep him safe, Rhodey could not stay by his side all the time, Rhodey could not stand against Steve, the super soldier, the American Icon that was loved and revered as a hero still if he came for them. He would get hurt again because of him, because he was protecting him…
At the time, he thought he was dreaming as well. Maybe he was… it was more plausible than the notion of being… by Captain America out of everyone. Couldn't his mind produce someone he could actually deal with doing this? Because Steve, Cap – he wouldn't. Howard's words echoed in his mind, telling him of the greatest Hero he'd
Sam swallowed and followed in his footsteps, he tried to come up with something to say too, something that would maybe cheer the colonel up a little, make the walk to the hospital less quiet and difficult. "What is it like to be War Machine?" was the conversation starter he finally opted for, and rightfully – it seemed the subject made Rhodes light up almost immediately.
People were quick to peg him a selfless martyr for the sacrifices he supposedly made – enlisting in the army, letting mad scientists perform their dangerous magic on him, taking on Hydra with limited resources and against orders, Even crashing the Valkyrie into the ice - an act of heroism – he gained from all of those actions. Love, adoration, loyalty so fierce it preserved for years after his perceived death.
They both watch as the figure leans in, his hand tracing lines across Tony's sleeping form as his head descended nearer and his hand cradled Tony's head to lift it and close the distance… Rhodey shoved the ball back into Natasha's hand and wiped his tears.
Without another word he leaves, hoping Steve would take his honest advice and do the same.
The hand tightened, cutting Tony's breathing efforts almost completely. "I thought… I thought you'd be dead, is why I did what I did." He sighed, "I thought it'd be the last time I saw you, how could I deny myself… us, how could I deny both of us that one time? It was a long time coming and we almost missed it, I knew that. I did what was right for us." He let go then, only keeping one hand on Tony's body, on his trembling thigh on which wounds had now re-opened and were leaking blood again. His one hand enough to keep Tony completely still and at his mercy. "Don't twist my words like you usually do, though. I'm glad you are alive. I'm happy we will get to start again."
Maybe that was why he felt a little grateful when the building collapsed over him, why he hadn't fought as hard or made a significant effort to get free. Not from the rubble, not from Steve's hold.
Tony worked. He used to love working, used to lose his head and sense of time in a flurry of ideas and thoughts. He used to produce plans and prototypes by simply being in a workshop, but now it felt like a roadblock was permanently set inside his mind, so work meant letting Jarvis do simple calculations he used to be able to do in his sleep while he watched the news and tinkered absent-mindedly with a piece of tech he could not remember the purpose of.
Before leaving, Steve let Tony have another one of the pills and made sure he had water with him before tucking him in under the covers, making sure he was warm and comfortable before kissing him just once more on the lips, getting a small, indistinguishable noise in return.
The team watched Rhodes walk to the door silently, a few of them twitching in their sits and averting their eyes from the others when looked at with inquiring eyes. Then, the alarm started blaring.
"Just… call Rhodey, ok? Tell him to feed the boys- the
"This is how you show me you are alive, Tony… come on, you even enjoyed it before… remember? When I did this…" his hand was between Tony's thighs, massaging his genitals in a slow and deliberate method. "You lost so much blood, but you still… you still managed to get hard, for me… remember?"
He did what he could, took out as many of the enemies as was possible by his weapons, created deadly flaws in the defenses of the opposing force that could get the team their eventual victory just moments before his suit was crushed and flung away into the midsection of a building, consequently causing it to come down around and on top of him. Effectively burying him alive in an early grave.
But there he was. Waking up from sleep he didn't remember falling into. And everything was dark and silence all around him told that it was no longer the room in the hospital that accommodated him. He didn't know if it was a dream, at first. He hoped, he wished, and then the pain washed through him and stabbed into his flesh inside and out and he knew that it was not.
Sam stood there, looking at the scene, looking at his hands. Feeling again the squeeze of Steve's hand on his arm when they hugged and a sudden turbulence attacked his gut. He replayed the conversation again and again in his mind, trying to find any clue that would allow him to make up an excuse and nearly slapped himself. No. Steve was his friend, but it became clear that he had done a terrible and inexcusable thing. It didn't matter
It was the third night when Rhodes came to see him, and they both sunk in the atmosphere of defeat that hung around the entire tower. Bruce was locked inside one of his special rooms, unable to de-hulk since the night before, Natasha and Clint were out, coordinating the search along with local authorities, to whom they have not told about Steve and instead sold them a story about a Captain America impersonator. That the real story would not have been believed was their reasoning as explained to a furious Rhodes who demanded Steve was held accountable for his actions.
Tony could barely move his hands due to pain, so it was a relief to discover the Emergency buttons panel in an approachable position on the side of the bed as was designed by his R&D department and approved by his own hand, he was just able to press it as his body convulsed again under Steve's body, desperate for air and relief.
"I know." He said, and absent mindedly took a whiff from the inhaler, for which he needed to find a more proper name. "And I know you did what you did to keep that from happening. And I know you are not sorry for doing what was necessary. I don't… blame you, if that helps somehow. I don't blame anyone."
"D-Don't look… so sad…" Tony coughed, once again feeling blood mixing with the saliva in his mouth, he spat it out before attempting more words. "C-capcsicle… it's ok. The p-puppy eyes won't…" His vision swam so he must be close again… soon - it'd be over soon. "T-the C-comms are down, eh? You… you should g-go and find help, I c-can wait here..." Steve didn't have to be there when he was finally gone, he shouldn't be there… it was fine.
Tony pressed the duress button.
Later, he'd gotten up and walked around the room, and the next room. There wasn't another room after that. He found a bare kitchen with no utensils or appliances – only cupboards filled with canned food with a tab opener. A small corner on the other side with just a single couch made of a block of wood and some cushions and attached to the floor, completely unmovable, he found some windows and was able to see clear night sky through the thick glass – uncharacteristic to the vicinity of New York.
Which meant it had something to do with Steve.
Tony fell to the floor as Steve was flung away. His so-called hand, what was left of it was a metallic skeletal formation, wires and some singed and torn patches of synthetic skin that extended all the way above his elbow, and at the middle of his palm was a small, smaller than any he'd created before, arc reactor. Powering the entire thing.
A painful memory of one teenager and one young adult drinking and laughing uncontrollably while listening to – and later reenacting 40's and 50's Captain America radio skits in their dorm room, a make-shift, pizza box-made shield thrown between them as they reclaimed the hero that Tony used to think of as a tool in Howard's hands, meant only to degrade him. A night ending with warm touches and hugs and kisses reserved only for them.
It was the shout that finally woke Tony up. His heart was pounding within his chest, and the intake of air he took caused him to burst into a fit of coughing. His throat felt too dry, and his chest hurt again, but otherwise he felt warm and comfortable in the nest of blankets and pillows Steve apparently made for him. Considering how he was woken up, and what had happened before he lost consciousness, Tony felt rather calm, almost tranquil. It didn't really matter what happened from here on. Steve was probably going to forgive him, or kill him… it really seemed like the same thing to him at this point, with death being the slightly better option, perhaps.
aaand that's it? please enjoy, and fear not - there's at least one more chapter before I leave you for another year ;)
Steve gritted his teeth together and his hand moved again to gain a hold on Tony's jaw, cupping his face to make him look into the blue eyes he was once sure belonged to an ally, but not so much anymore. "Do you, Tony?"
Tony saw spots in the darkness. A sign that his medications were wearing off… surely enough the pain started prickling under his skin not long after that, turning numbness into torment. He wondered if Rhodey would still be there when he woke up; hoped so – but also knew he'd tell him to go home and sleep if he found him sitting by him and holding his hand again. It wasn't right that he had to worry so much about Tony – nobody needed that kind of responsibility for his stubborn, borderline suicidal self. And yet his friend took it voluntarily, years ago.
"Okay, I'll come back later." Steve smiled again when Sam clapped an affirming hand on his shoulder and gave him the trademarked 'Encouragement look', assuring him in whatever step or decision he wanted to take.
"Yes sir…" Jarvis sounded dissatisfied with his orders, "If I may, your body seems to still be under distress-"
(I tried researching heart attacks but I may have not depicted it very well... sorry!
Bucky was admitted into a private mental facility, his care funded by a Stark Industries charity fund. It was all done under the radar, far from prying eyes. And Steve knew, he just did – this was done by Tony, a grand gesture like he loved to do to show his devotion. Another voice, smaller and definitely more annoying, tried to convince him that maybe it was the other way around. Maybe Stark held Bucky as leverage against him, a misguided attempt at provoking him. But even if it was, Steve was far too grateful to fall for it.
"I will shave you." Steve said decidedly with a smile before kissing him again, "I won't be as precise as you are, with all the clean-cut shapes and angles, I have no idea how you do it like that… But that's okay, I wanted to see how you would look without that goatee for ages, now."
The silence was aggravating, the white walls too bare. Clint was getting restless and his patience for the constant beeping of the machines hooked up to Tony was running out. If anyone wanted to break him – that would definitely be the method of torture they should choose.
"Younger, I bet." Steve grinned as he dipped in for another kiss, his hand sliding down Tony's torso slowly, "Lovely… sweet… just for me…" Tony considered trying to push him away as Steve's lips moved down, laying pecks along his jaw and throat, but every movement of his hands hurt, and the thought of putting any more pressure on his still fractured bones made him cringe as he considered the damage they were subjected to.
"Nah." He said, firing-up the repulsors and taking off the ground. He didn't face the others as he spoke. "Get ready, and listen closely. This is how we are getting in."
"You always think you know best." Steve hissed. "You don't remember but you say it's bullshit? You were
bug going around at that hospital and infecting people? Not that it was entirely impossible, but the chances of that happening were too low to deprive Tony of pain relief after getting his thigh torn apart a second time, it was unreasonable.
"Nobody else agreed to come over here to give you those… your things from the tower; Some art supplies, and clothes, and… the fucking uniform." He looked disgusted as he said the words, his hands leaving the box as if touching it burned them. "The uniform you don't deserve to wear."
"I sh-should… be in the hospital…" he muttered when Steve laid him down on his mattress. Tony's eyes dropped immediately as if he was straining to stay awake. "Please, Steve…"
"Thank me, definitely." Rhodey shot back, taking a bite of the buttered bread in his hand, "They can find out with the rest of the world, when you are better." He peered at Tony through half lidded eyes, finding him staring back at him with a hint of horror. "You are going to get better, Tones. You promised me."
He was going to say words of encouragement, remind him Tony was still alive, still there. He had that chance now and they would be amazing together – and then Tony lost control.
"Tony?" Bruce rushed to his friend's—patient, bedside at the machines indicative sound of heart rate accelerating and blood pressure climbing. The anesthesia they used during the surgeries to fix the man's tracheal rupture and extract the bits of metal and glass from where these lodged in his flesh was wearing off, and as those procedures took care of the worst injuries, Bruce decided keeping the man essentially comatose for much longer would hinder any further examination of his condition and necessary treatment.
Howard was the example that Steve was most fond of – Peggy moved on and got married, Bucky was with Hydra and couldn't remember him – not his fault, of course. Howard? Howard focused all of his resources on Steve, including his own person. He neglected his family, neglected Tony. For Steve's sake. And with the little pang of anger at that mistreatment, Steve found it made him feel… not exactly good; but appreciated, wanted, not entirely forgotten.
Tony hoped, a tiny bit, that it took him more than just a week to be broken down, that he wasn't so weak and susceptible to Steve's manipulation and dominance that he accepted it so soon. He hoped – and hated that he did, that the Avengers had given up, that Rhodey had given up. That they would not find him hugged tightly against Steve's chest, not fighting, begging for whatever relief he could get from the burning pain in his chest.
Tony woke up. He saw a blinding light and knew he was dead.
It was over. They were almost in.
Tony hesitated, hand gliding across the abused skin.
Tony seemed to relax a fair amount at his words, and Rhodey smiled down at him as he fell asleep again when he finally heard the sound of the repulsors that indicated an Iron Man armor arrival. This armor was smaller than War Machine, and Jarvis piloted it into the room with little difficulty. It's face unnervingly glared at them before the mask retracted and the front plates of the armor opened to accommodate a body.
Steve was so happy when he saw him wear it, he didn't even get upset about Tony swiping it away from where Steve discarded it the night before on the sofa, It fed right into the domestic like setting he hungered for.
Tony squirmed against the wall. His composure shattered and his efforts at reminding to himself, again and again just where he was, and what he could do, was barely working to keep his terror controlled. The small padded room he nearly died in was closing in on him as Steve narrowed the distance between them, more and more, suffocating him with his mere presence.
"When… are you coming back?" He asked, careful not to meet Steve's eyes as he turned his head in his direction, he tried not to sound panicked, or especially desperate to know, yet somehow his voice managed to exhibit both of those tones with a pinch of fear added for good measure.
"Why did you lie to everyone about being dead?"
No one dared deny that the man in those pictures was Steve Rogers, not anymore.
"Where is Tony?" he asked, his head bowed and his hands clenched to the point of digging holes in his own palms, Natasha could only guess Bruce had revealed what she heard discussed herself the day before to the rest of the team, and a small part of her was mad on Tony's behalf, even if she knew Bruce did it for what he deemed a good reason.
He dared to open his eyes, blinking them a few times to find a clearing image of Bruce looking at him with his worry lines digging deeper in his forehead than Tony ever saw them. "…Big green…" he slurred, opening his eyes a bit wider, and then he finds the other person by his side, and his heart sinks. "B-Bruce…" he whimpered and lunged at his friend, grabbing at his lab coat in an attempt to pick himself up and move away from Steve who had the same stern and cold expressions as he did in the nightmares.
From there on out, it's been a mess of mixed signals. Sometimes, despite knowing it was true – Steve wondered if Tony Stark and Iron Man were really the same man. Sometimes he found himself wondering if the man he was talking with was actually Tony Stark, or if he was just a stand in. Time after time Iron man would perform feats of heroics on the battle-field no one expected of him after meeting Tony Stark, just to later justify their prejudice by playing it up in order to gain praise from his teammates under guise of worrying about the future.
He heard Steve pacing around the room, then leaving it for the sake of the next room before returning once more. His breath caught in his throat as he waited for him to settle, decide on the best way to discipline him and do it. He just wished it would be over already.
As he continued his ministrations on the limp body under him Tony's voice turned less audible, his gasps less frequent and throatier as well as shallow, Steve took it as a sign of relaxation, not opening his eyes or slowing down his now almost brutal pace, he groaned into the flesh of his partner's throat, nibbling on it as his buildup became nearly unbearable, moaning as he searched for lips to kiss to share his moment of pleasure with Tony.
out? Isn't that a bit of an overreaction?"
"Your beard is turning grisly." He mentioned as he swiped the towel down Tony's hollowed cheeks, soaking remains of thick soup from his beard and picking out unidentified bits out of it. "It's too long and mangled. Doesn't that bother you?"
"Sh… baby, it’s okay… I will help you, make you feel good." Another stroke made Tony freeze, a pitiful sound leaving his throat when Steve mouthed at it, harshly sucking and bruising the skin further. He tasted salty with sweat and blood, and smelled so too, with an addition of another stink Steve couldn't quite place. He imagined he smelled of grease and aftershave, like he thought it must have been like in his dreams… it made everything more bearable if he could picture brown eyes looking at him with laughter instead of crippling pain in them, a hand moving to rest on his back instead of laying crushed and mangled, never to hold another power-tool again. It made it all bearable, a more desirable situation to be in.
But then, Bruce had to go and call it 'Rape'. As if Steve would ever do something like that. Not that they knew it was him – sure, if one of their enemies was to do the same as Steve did, that'd be sexual assault… Although… knowing Tony, he'd probably enjoy it anyway. The man talked – if in a joking tone – about fucking an alien being an item on his bucket list. So how horrible would that really be for him, anyway? Who is to say Tony wouldn't have provoked them to do it by his own resolve, if the chance presented itself? Steve himself was baited by the man to do what he did, made to believe that it was his last chance to ever touch… have Tony as he dreamed to for so long.
His stomach was on fire. It was sudden and there was no warning before the heat ignited under his skin. He gasped as air did not arrive to his lungs, and  his entire body convulsed in pain as the heat kept increasing. It was changing something inside him: he could feel it –could feel the rearrangement of his organs so clearly– and when he moved his hands to his stomach he could feel small changes of shape and size as things got pushed around.
"I am counting on it."
Tony was always so smart when it came to security, but right now it seemed so dumb. Obviously, creating a connection between Jarvis and the safe-house could create all sorts of security problems that would have been less than ideal if it was being used for its original purpose. Tony did his best to avoid those problems, he never even considered it being used against him. He never really thought how something could be used against him. He was naïve like that.
"No! No… please don't." The words left his mouth before he could stop them. It wasn't even such an important thing, was it? Just his beard, he could always grow it again when Rhodey finds him, when he is free. It wasn't worth it right now. It wasn't worth the pain and the lethargy. It was ridiculous, it was so stupid. "Steve, please…" again the words left him, this time in the form of a whine as Steve ignored his plead and lathered a brush with the soap.
It was fine, Nat was going to be fine. He took in a deep breath to consider the situation. His arrow supply was depleted from being used against the constant barrage of actual missiles they had to deflect while they waited for Sam to come back from the errand Natasha sent him on. He still had knives hidden all across his attire and the cartridge of the gun he had on him was still full – he hoped, of course, that he would not have to use it, that he would have no reason to – but after seeing Steve's face back in the other room…
She was there the day before, when Bruce and the other doctors rushed Stark inside, saw them as they hooked him up with tubes and needles and an obscene amount of painkillers as well, probably. They pulled a curtain around his bed and talked in hushed whispers, but Bruce should have known that it wouldn't really matter with her in the room, she was a bit disappointed in him, to be honest.
Even in the rare case where the Avengers found their way in, they would not find Tony. Even if it meant… it was fine, because he would stay his even beyond the end.
When she left the room, Steve was no longer there.
I feel like chapters are just getting shorter and shorter.
"I'm afraid I cannot provide any further information." Jarvis repeated stubbornly. "Any further attempts to access those files will restrict your access to my services, Doctor Banner." Bruce pounded the desk with his fist hard enough that the glass coating on it cracked and a low, rumbling growl found its way out of his throat. "Doctor Banner, I strongly advise that you step into the restraining chamber and calm down."
Natasha and Clint were back at her bed and were pulling the curtain around them to give Tony privacy as they talked among themselves. Rhodey was still sitting in his chair with his eyes every bit unfocused as he was tired from so many hours of wakefulness, Bruce made up his mind to get a spare bed in the room for the man before he exhausted himself completely. He injected Tony with the drug that would at least block some of the pain if not all of it for the duration of the night and watched as Tony's face relaxed, the lines in his forehead turning shallow and flatten while his body numbed.
When Steve came into the room just moments after the nurses left, Tony controlled himself if only barely. He kept breathing the air provided to him at a moderate pace, focused on the burning pain in his throat and chest and everywhere else to remind himself that waking-time Steve was different from sleep-time Steve, and as long as pain was present, and the ability to recite Pi in his mind was not completely gone, this was fine. He was awake, and Steve was just Steve.
The cold look was back in Steve's eyes, the set of his jaw turning firmer and sudden force in his grip over the back of Tony's head. The pain of his firm hold was not as horrible as the rest of the aches all across Tony's body, however it was distinctive - it's warmth and insistence and the texture of the glove striking against his skin, all resulting in a choked gasp leaving Tony's throat. The sudden shift of strength, sending a wave of panic down his spine.
The expression on Steve's face remained neutral during Tony's thrashing and honest effort of breathing properly, he remained unfazed by the noises Tony's throat was making while trying to draw down air enough to keep himself alive. Just like before he seemed undisturbed by his teammate's peril.
A wave of panic tore through Tony as he momentarily stopped breathing again. "What…" he breathed deeply and blinked before he saw Steve's hand move toward his face, and immediately retreated from it almost unconsciously, his eyes moving from the outreaching hand to Steve's now frowning face. His breathing was suffering from the shocked state the question placed him in, and the words nagged at his mind and chased away any other sobering thought he managed to stack in there before.
"Go home and rest, Steve." He finally said, too tired to continue the conversation, too exhausted from worrying. he sees the reluctance in Steve's eyes, and can't find the energy to fight. Puny Banner.
It was her turn to frown now. Bruce had been reluctant to speak about what happened much like the rest of them but did inform them of what happened with Steve in the room, how Tony asked that he leaves as soon as he woke up. He looked disturbed by that request from Tony but did not elaborate as to why he thought that happened, letting each of them dwell on the information on their own, probably driven by the guilt of exposing them to the true nature of the assault Tony endured without the man's own consent.
This is turning out to be a multi chaptered fic. I didn't plan on that.
They were going for Tony. he could not let them find him.
The two spies exchanged subtle glances, Natasha's face remaining stony while Clint's frown deepened and eyes darkened. "Cap…" This time, it was Hawkeye who addressed him, shaking his head slightly, "Steve, please. We can still try to fix this." He said with a voice emotional and dreary, "at least… we'll make sure you are treated with respect and dignity and get a fair trial. Alright?"
Not a dream. It was not a dream.
Pain attacked his body all over as he did it, he felt dizzy but everything was better than spending another helpless moment lying in bed with Steve staring down at him like that. He buried his head in the folds of Bruce's shirt and panted heavily as he tried to form words to explain his bizarre acts. "Bruce, p-please…" he whined when Bruce tangles a hand in his hair and caresses him, "Mmm-make him g-go."
team, more focused on bringing back the Winter Soldier safe and hopefully sane, than actually participate in official Avengers operations. As such, his encounters with Tony Stark were both brief and unflattering to the genius, who spent most of his spare time either running his company in sharp suits or holed up in the laboratory in pantsuits and oil stained tank-tops, creating whatever. Some of the time was also spent arguing with Steve, as the two leaders of the group seemed to have clashing sets of ideals and ideas about strategies and… pretty much everything else.
"That's so cheesy." Tony smiled as he replied, exchanging a reassured glance with his best friend, who smiled softly, with the same glint of sadness and resignation his eyes adopted for the past few months.
Steve's eyes skimmed over his entire body. Blue, cold, full of disapproval. "You look well," was the comment he finally decided on making, his hand moving to rub his chin in consideration, his tone was the polite yet judging one he often used in the past to chastise him when they fought. "The goatee is back, I see..." Tony's hand flew to his own chin, as if afraid to find it turned smooth again before he reminded himself again just where he was. Steve was not done.
so yet again, Tony is alone, Steve is there. suffering inbound!
?" said one pundit, his flat face and sweaty complexion caused a sense of revulsion in Tony, as he set his jaw in annoyance.
. His thoughts struggling to turn clear for long enough to even grasp the significance of the places where Steve was stroking both his arms and his lips – his tongue – on his body, or interpret the appearance of Steve's face as hungry, or was it horny, actually? Perhaps both.
She just watched.
"Right, right. I forget the proper… proper way to talk, sometimes." He whispered, trying to ignore the shiver passing through him as he passed the kitchen area, looking at the thin layered dust covering the empty counters. He told Pepper to tell Natasha that they could stay there, that the tower was a gift, the Avengers were still needed. But, for each their own reason, everyone ended up leaving eventually. None of them telling anyone where they were going - except for Sam, who joined Rhodey overseas, hunting rampant Hydra agents.
"Of course, Doctor Banner." The A.I. said and suddenly the entire room lit up, holograms of maps and pictures of the entire area affected by the invasion, another of the building that collapsed on top of Tony, and then another one of the hospital were Tony was for the past days since then. A list of visitors and visiting hours as well as any doctor and nurse to have entered Tony's room and had been cleared to do so while the suits were on guard also floated in front of Bruce's face. In the corner of the room, a miniature re-enactment of the fight outside of Tony's room just before he disappeared was looping mutely. "for your consideration, Doctor Banner."
"Uh… yeah. Usually. I guess he just needed some time alone, you know? After that whole showdown with Colonel Rhodes. I can't say I blame him." Sam sighed, sneaking a look at the exhausted Colonel who leaned against the counter, his broken hand shaking and his face as good as made of steel. "I can't believe he still thinks Steve would do anything like that, even after we told him Steve is not even in the country right now. He is not letting up."
Bruce sighed deeply. Was there some sort of
"Whatever anyone else says, whatever shitty lies they tell themselves to justify that asshole," Rhodey breathed in heavily, his face cast in a mask of restrained rage but his hand gently stroking through Tony's hair. "I believe you. I will find proof and make him confess what he did and then I will crush his fucking head with War Machine's boot, or your Hulk-buster, maybe. I will keep you safe."
He felt Bruce shift to look at Steve, could imagine the curve of his brow at the request. Bruce will want to ask why, later. It was fine. Tony could tell. Bruce would think it's ridiculous because it absolutely was, and then they would laugh and everything will be okay again. He won't see the image of Steve's hateful look directed at him ever again.
, Rogers. And you want him to just
Although, seeing him now walking through the tower like he had nothing to worry about, Rhodey would have rolled his eyes and told him the exact opposite. He was the most idiotic person he had ever met, probably.
Then they took him for tests and surgeries, and he wasn't back since the night before. She didn't get any answers from the nurses or from any of the doctors, and Bruce was presumably by Tony's side still, so he didn't come back either. She was just about ready to leave the infirmary to go demand answers about Stark's condition when Rhodes came in, still completely encased in his suit, only his helmet dispositioned, and looked around. Eyes lingering on Natasha but a moment before he stepped toward the vacant spot and stepped out of the suit, his face grim and wounded. Even with his height diminished out of the large metal suit, Rhodes stature of an experienced soldier was conveying a threatening vibe, like a lion ready to strike down anyone who would dare open their mouth around him or step too close.
One louder thud, accompanied by a shout by his partner alerted Clint to the passing of time, he found himself kneeling near the bed with a hand over his mouth, trying to keep the scents and his own convulsing stomach at bay. He didn't like that sound, it was the kind of sound one makes when a hurt spot is being exploited to cause greater pain, like a broken arm being stepped on, or broken in another place. Natasha was strong, she could withstand torture both physically and emotionally, but Clint preferred for her to come out of the encounter whole.
"I actually hoped you would have come to your senses by now, the entire world is telling you what they saw in the video you leaked, and it wasn't rape. but you, you convinced yourself, didn't you?"
At some point, the chanting stopped, and both of Tony's casted hands were positioned close to his chest, grasping and clutching at the shirt he wore and the blanket that covered him.
When Steve talked again, his voice was soft and deceivingly sweet. "You shouldn't be so hard on yourself, Tony… it was the best you could do in such a short time. It wasn't perfect, but it damn well served the purpose we set for it."
Next chapter might be last?? I don't know. anyway it might take some time to be done for "I'm studying animation and time is fake" reasons. Thank you for your patience ♥
He called Rhodey, finding his voice brittle and weak as he pushed himself against the thin mat his body was propped on. He called Rhodey, and Jarvis – just to hear their voices and know they were okay would have been all he needed to let himself go and fall back asleep. All he got was silence and darkness. Somewhere in his mind, there was anticipation – a predictive, false sense telling him how soon a bag would be pulled away from his head, and people around him will shout at him in intangible language and hold his head straight by pulling on his hair so a camera can catch his likeness. Logically he knew that he wasn't there – he wasn't back in Afghanistan, not in a cave. He knew, logically, that calling out Pepper's name, or Yinsen's, was going to help him zilch… but he could think of nothing else to do.
She bit her lower lip, lowering her head. Truth be told – she knew no better than Clint. She thought it would be easy, that she would be able to just, well, take Steve down, like she did her operators in the KGB, like she did Hydra-SHEILD. But as they made their covert way to the side of the house, advanced lock-picking equipment and explosives for a case in which the former did not work carried carefully in lightweight cases by the two spies, she realized she had no idea what 'Taking Down' Captain America entailed.
The TV turned off as soon as Rhodey entered the room, prompting a protest from absolutely no one who sat in the room. It was sort of a relief, actually – as Jarvis made a point of haunting the Avengers with news coverage of Tony's 'Mysterious' disappearance and crazy theories born of the media's need for an explanation no one would actually provide. The theories were all crazy, some were downright offensive, and none were close to the terrifying truth.
First, and quickly – he decided to go on the safe side and dashed to the cabinet where he locked the medicine from the pharmacy. He found both the needed pill bottles in the bag of supplies, recognizing the Nitroglycerin as one of the prescriptions he grabbed to cover his more particular interests and sighed in relief at his incredible luck.
Meanwhile, Tony refused to eat.
Steve. His blue eyes cold and his lips curled up in a pale mock of a smile.
The two spies exchanged looks, then Natasha moved toward Ross while Clint went back to his sit glumly. "We will release everything we found out to the press, Stark industries will make an announcement sooner or later too. People will not welcome him back so easily." She said quietly, to which Ross replied with a bark of laughter.
"I told them to call you but they called some other half-wit instead." He said quietly, turning back to look at Tony's face, "could've been Hydra for all we know, we have too many enemies, Bruce. We can't just let any other person touch him and inject him with who knows what."
As he did to Tony, they made sure to deprive him of anything that could be used to commit suicide. With Tony being dead, that would've been the only way for him to get him back – but he was not in a hurry to die. He still had to find Bucky before that, couldn't leave him under Hydra's control. He had to give his friend a chance at life before he ended his own and joined Tony. He knew without a doubt that Tony would wait for him, wherever he was, his dreams assured him – dreams of the first time, the smile on Tony's face when he moaned his name, his slack hands trying to hold him closer, patting his skin urgently as the loved. He told him he loved him back in those dreams, and Steve believed it couldn't be anything but the truth, because now Tony had no more reasons to lie to him.
ANYWAY anyone else Loves Rhodey? I love Rhodey.
He barely noticed the touches anymore, the violation stopped being new and scary and instead became familiar and manageable. Routine meant not having to think, meant numbness – and no more of that horrible pain.
The hand shot a beam again, hitting Steve's abdomen and sending him crushing into the same broken-glass covered surface as before. Steve yelled, his shout a mix of animalistic rage and pain.
He pried the phone out of Rhodes' hand and looked at it, and just as he did the alarm stopped blaring and was replaced by the relatively calmer, British-Accented voice of JARVIS.
Rhodes snorted, "Even if you bothered checking, you will twist it any way you can to make Rogers come out in a good light. What was it? He was forced to do it by the aliens, wasn't he? Tony should probably get over it eventually, forgive him for violating him, right? Steve would
Steve stood up, not looking back at the limp heap of flesh that bore a semblance to the Genius, Billionaire… Hero he loved, he tucked himself back into his uniform and wiped beads of sweat from his brow before picking up the shield that represented Captain America, made by the father of the corpse he was leaving behind, to be found by rescue teams or scavengers, whoever got there first... No—no. Tony deserved at the very least a proper burial, a hero's funeral. Steve could not let his sense of loss affect his ideals like that. He picked up the busted earpiece and put it in his ear, whatever was blocking the signal before was gone now, and he was able to transfer Barton a message with the coordinates of his and Tony's location.
He sat on the ground next to the opening in the rubble the crashed building, leaning against his shield and wiped tears from his eyes when they found him. He told them Tony was dead – and they didn't believe him. He understood, of course he did, how accepting such a thing was an impossibility to anyone who knew Tony. The man sure liked to act as if he was immortal, rush in and jump ahead to face dangers that were not his to face, just like he did during the battle that caused his death.
"Tony…" he tried saying his name without letting himself sound as tired as he really was, it wasn't working. He wasn't sure what he wanted to ask. About what happened? he knew - well, he had an idea, a theory. About Steve? If his Theory was right, it explained that as well. He couldn't make Tony live through it yet again, not to satisfy his curiosity. Eventually Tony will tell them… or he won't, probably the second option, because it was Tony. "Tony, if something hurts I can give you another dose of painkillers." He said in a whisper, only to recoil when Tony shook his head in fierce denial and mutters his rejection.
They stayed that way for a while, stroking each other's backs and heads as the tender hug continued, reminiscent of something they have left in their youth, but was never completely gone from their relationship. When they finally met eyes again, Rhodey's hands resting on Tony's shoulders, both sets of eyes were damp and threatening to shed tears. Tony was shaking and his eyes drooping as his breathing became heavier. His head leaned towards the warmth and safety of Rhodey's body, which had now climbed to the bed to sit beside him, and it was the one place he knew he would be protected.
It was a longer adjustment than he had hoped, but Steve managed to get to his feet and fight back, slamming the spy into the wall with the entire weight of his body and the shield, he heard Clint calling her name from behind him, but ignored his voice, focusing his strength at disarming the more dangerous part of the pair.
his Tony, after all.
"Sam." He didn't answer, he was too tired to listen to any more of this, too tired to handle the phantom feeling of touch on his arm again as they asked him once more about his encounter or with the guilt that came with it all.
"Why do you have to be like this?" Steve's voice was remorseful, deep and heavy in his ear. "Always a pessimist. Can't you at least try, Tony? for me?" Tony shook his head before feeling another pinch, afterwards he stayed completely still. He found himself wondering detachedly if Steve was aware of himself when he hurt him, if it was on purpose or just an automatic reaction. He didn't respond to Tony's whines of pain and did not seem to care for his erratic breathing patterns. Did he think Tony was faking it, still?
Without noticing that he did, Tony had been chanting a plead for Steve to go away for some long minutes, not ceasing his body's struggle against air and nothing, only to stop when Bruce's voice managed to break through his confused mumbling and clogged ears. Bruce wasn't in either of his dreams, so maybe this was actually real? Did he finally really wake up? Or… was his mind turning his torture even more elaborate?
Days passed in a haze, only organized by the things Steve did or said. When was it time to eat – be force fed – or to go to the bathroom, when was he allowed to sleep and when must he take medicine that wasn't helping ease any pain at all. Otherwise, he knew nothing on the passing of hours or days, not anymore. He could equivalent such a haze to his days long binges in the workshop, where he could keep his mind too busy to care about things like time passing him by, but it wasn't exactly the same thing.
The apartment Ross housed him in was nice. Basic, like the one he used before Shield fell - before he moved into the Avengers tower. It obviously wasn't as nice as his room over there - which Tony gave him freedom and money to furnish as he liked - and it barely had space to hold his art supplies, which, now that he thought of it, were still at the tower. He didn't have time to bring them with him to the cabin, he hadn't thought about drawing at all during the time he took care of Tony.
He was pulled away from his thoughts by Steve's lips on the corner of his mouth, a peck inquiring for permission for further access. Tony closed his eyes and pried his lips open. To let him taste what he made Tony swallow, maybe. Because he was scared of what will happen if he didn't… maybe.
"Any progress?" Clint, who did not expect an answer and did not really get one, got up as soon as Rhodey got in the room, handing him a pre-made sandwich they had prepared for all the members returning from their nightly patrol.
Hydra, and the Avengers too.
"Maybe I'll go see Tony after all… see that he is…"
"Sir, the police forces outside – they were dismissed by general Ross. His tone may indicate that he is displeased. He demands access to the tower immediately."
He injected Tony with a low dose of Valium and then increased the dose of the pain-killers to help his friend relax. Tony was sweating and his dilated pupils were blindly focused on the ceiling for several more seconds before his body slumped, the tension leaving it somewhat. Bruce didn't attempt making conversation, as much as he wanted to check for his friend's well-being, letting his patient rest until he was in a position to recognize where he was and what was actually happening was a higher priority. Bruce hoped the valium would be enough to let him sleep peacefully, with no bad dreams to plague him.
She didn't rush to a conclusion – Tony and Steve had an excellent working relationship, but privately they were a couple of bickering old ladies who could not seem to decide what they should argue about next – yet always finding something. There was a lot of unresolved tension between them, and sure – she could see it grow in one way or another into different things. For Steve that change seemed to have triggered already, maybe for Tony it did not - or did, but in a different way?
"Tony got hurt before-" he paused, realizing how idiotic the phrase coming out of his mouth actually was. Tony was never hurt like he was now, this was different. "I… god, Steve. I don't think he fully realized yet what happened. I think he… he believes it was a dream, and for some reason, you are somehow the main star of that nightmare that plagues him. I won't… pressure you into talking. If you do want to talk it doesn't have to be me – it can be Nat or Sam. He is a therapist, right? He'd be the better choice anyway." He is deflecting – he knows. Inside his head, The Other Guy is calling him out. 'Puny Banner', the Hulk sneers at him, and yes. That he is.
If Steve got to make stuff up, then… so did Tony.
It was almost over, soon one side will prevail and drive the other to his knees and hopefully - it'd be the right side. In the meantime, they had to continue fighting. No matter how many of them fell, or how hopeless it seemed…
Before he went back to Tony's side, his eyes landed on another thing he took – a breathing machine and a small oxygen tank. He got it for Tony despite having gotten the inhaler, in case of an emergency, not for casual use. Tony could turn even the smallest piece of technology into a weapon, a bomb or something else equally dangerous, just giving him the oxygen tank could mean an end to the entire facility.
He sat, fiddling with the edges of his shield as he listened to more and more explosions and shouts from outside, listening to the dim roars of a frustrated Hulk as he fantasized about going back to Tony's location, hugging him until he woke and then thanking him for keeping them both safe. He wasn't as upset about the lies anymore, they would go away soon enough.
Before any of them had a chance to check what happened, Rhodey turned to face them, just barely holding a cellphone in his trembling, injured hand without it falling to the ground. The duffle-bag did fall and clashed against the floor with a deafening metallic racket. His face paled tremendously compared to a minute before that, and the Avengers paused their scrambling around for their gear and information to stare at him.
Also, he really wanted to make sure his friend was still there. That he was… okay.
He got up, strapping the shield to its place on his arm and heavily turned to look at his team-mates, former, if the weapons trained on him and the looks they gave him were any indication. He really wished it wouldn't come to that, it really didn't have to.
Bruce didn't believe him, neither did any of the other Avengers. None of them would make an effort to keep Rogers away – and it was clear that they, in fact, could not. Captain America was the leader of the Avengers, the man with a plan, the symbol. Tony was never supposed to even be an Avenger; he wasn't fit for it. Narcissistic, so self-centered he was willing to rip the team apart over what might have been a dream or a misunderstanding.
A surge of energy hit his body and it jerked violently, his eyes shooting open to find several faces looking down at him. None of them covered with the blue cowl of Captain America or looked at him with ice blue eyes full of the accusation and contempt he expected – but their hands were holding him down, and that was no less horrible at the moment.
A muscle tensed in Steve's throat as he turned to look at her. "...a security guy, and a nurse. A big nurse." He muttered before sipping at his coffee, grimacing at the bitter taste of it. Natasha wasn't sure if she should have thought it was funny or not but smirked with amusement anyway.
A vehicle took Tony's body away accompanied by Bruce alone. The Avengers still had work to be done.
Steve turned to look at Bruce with a raised eyebrow. "Do we at least know how… who? Was there… was there a rape kit? Did they get anything?" He asked patiently, searching Bruce's eyes for clues to the answer. Not that he'd care if they accused him. What happened was not rape, it was not assault. It definitely wasn't violent – he wasn't trying to hurt Tony, not any more than he'd already been hurt. Steve loved him, after all.
"Anyone of us would have reacted the same way, Doctor Banner. Accusing our Shield-brother of such an atrocious act should be unthinkable. I'm sure the Man of Iron would soon realize it himself." Thor supplied with a soft smile, laying a heavy hand on Bruce's shoulder, who shook his head slightly but said nothing in turn.
Rhodey stayed quiet, but the look he gave Tony was a guilty one, and his injured hand came to rest on top of Tony's on the bed rail. His eyes alternated from looking at Tony directly to finding any other spot in the room to look at. When the nurse finished treating the wounds and left, he finally spoke.
Rhodey stood in the corner, still in his armor which rarely came off in the last few days, and ate his sandwich in silence. Despite reaching an accord with the team, he did not fraternize with them anymore, and shared only information he thought was crucial for them to know. It was evident to all that he was not going to let anyone besides himself lay a hand on Tony once they found him, not unless they wanted to face off against him. And if Tony was not… if because of their delay and negligence Tony was hurt with no chance of recovery, there would be hell to pay.
At the moment, Tony's vital signs were going crazy; the man was trying to breath normally where his body was currently getting its oxygen from a chest tube, and he was definitely panicking. Bruce vaguely remembered Tony making an offhanded comment about third-rate anesthesia wearing off too early to expose him to the horrors of open heart surgery in a cave in Afghanistan. Bruce thought he was joking, back then. Now he wondered how he could ever consider anything coming out of Tony Stark's mouth a joke. The man has been so brutally honest, always coming on too strong… too strong for some people. Not for Bruce. He adored it, he found it amusing, even when the self-deprecation was so evident in the genius' words.
Once he was standing, his head swimming and a bout of nausea developing in his gut, Steve seized his arm again, holding him upright when he almost toppled over. Tony did not struggle and tried not to whimper when a tremble passed through him at the touch. He let himself be dragged to the bathroom – a sect of the small house locked behind a wooden panel, only unlocked by biometric identification.
get to meet, the man Tony will never, in his life, compare to. He wanted to laugh but even more than that – he wished to just
They came for him, they were somewhere inside the cabin, looking for him. Tony barely scrambled to his feet, nearly falling when they tangled in the mess of blankets and sheets on the floor. The oxygen mask torn away from his face as he made his way, leaned against the wall towards where the entrance to the room should have been, if he recalled the design correctly – he had his doubts about the ability his mind possessed for remembering things correctly anymore. It was just… one of the things he had to come to terms with over the last couple of days. Not being a genius anymore, becoming a messy invalid who couldn't keep his bowels in check, forgetting both vital and trivial pieces of information his brain had stored over the years…
"Where were you?"
The only reason Ross knew was because Rhodes decided it was better that Steve knew and stayed put instead of going out to search for his best friend aimlessly.
"Life signs found," relief washed over him and he hastened his steps at once, falling to his knees besides Tony's body, "However, extremely feint, breathing is erratic and heart rate is too fast, might be heading for failure." The AI paused, "Sir requires extensive emergency care as soon as possible, Colonel."
As for the beard, Tony had worse bad-facial-hair-days so he sucked it up. He had no doubt that Steve wouldn't give him a knife to shave with, not even a safety disposable razor. He didn't bother mentioning it.
“Of course, Sir. Should I notify your Doctor?”
"Okay, Tony." a breath of relief left him at the words, only for the next one to hitch in his throat when Steve leaned in for another kiss, stealing it away before getting back up. "You've been so good, and your condition seems to have improved…" he smiled, "I took care of you, like I said I would. And you're getting so much better. Maybe we can try the surprise I had planned for the other night."
"Don't worry, hon…" he whispered softly, sitting down on the mattress next to Tony's tense body, who then attempted with a gasp to scurry away. Steve frowned and reached to pull him back, one hand on his slim waist enough to cause Tony to freeze completely and allow with only the slightest wounded cry for Steve to pull him back into place. "I am going to take care of you, you can trust me." He leaned in to kiss Tony's temple, brushing through his hair with his fingers to try and help Tony relax, but his muscles convulsed under his touch, tensing like those of an animal straining to escape a child's too-tight hug. "You don't need the hospital, Tony… it's not safe there. It's better here with me."
Tony felt like he was going to throw up. He kept still, only removing his eyes from the face of his ex-teammate.
For a moment he almost thought he somehow fell asleep again – but the pain in his chest was so real, so how could he be asleep and yet feel that?
It was a bizarre turn of events that led to his first meeting with Tony Stark, and by the time they finally met Sam was already engrossed with Steve, a part of
Howard gave him Tony. damaged and longing to be fixed – if Steve was willing to take him.
"Uh, yeah, so… everyone lost their sense of humor while I was gone, huh." He said, scrunching his eyebrows. "Anyway. Here it is. I am not dead. That is obvious, obviously. However, the announcement made by the Avengers was, while misguided, not false.  I have severed my personal ties to the organization, SI will of course continue to support the operation financially to create a safer future for everyone, to the best of our ability, however, Iron man, War machine, and all such developments under my name will no longer participate in the organization's operations. I may not be dead, but as of…" Tony looked at his wristwatch thoughtfully, "Four months ago, I am retired from the Avengers, for good."
"He is in pain," Bruce whispered after a while, "I know you want-" Rhodey didn't move his eyes from Tony's, but he nodded slowly and watched as the drug took effect on the man he could call a brother and dragged him back to sleep. The hand not held by his friend was clutching the bed rail with such intensity it bent a little under his grip. Every single person occupying the room could tell that he was there to stay.
It was fine, he said - tracing the curves of Tony's lower stomach with his hand, Tony was strong. He could endure it just as well. He just had to try and be positive.
As Tony reminisced quite peacefully inside his mind about wild years of a sixteen years old and a twenty-two years old youngling geniuses conquering MIT with their combined mischievous brilliance, the pain was rapidly becoming worse by the second. Tony wanted to wake up and beg a nurse to give him some of those amazing drugs Bruce had used before to numb the feeling of being run over by a truck in a prolonged and unending sequence.
Logically, he knew Jarvis was updated on news feeds all the time, the A.I. knew his Sir was in the hospital, if not the details of what happened to him. JARVIS was never too squeamish about hacking into the most secure systems in the world as a pastime. And even less so when it considered his master's safety. Rhodey still recalled the havoc the A.I. created in the USAF computer systems during Afghanistan, it was terrifying.
(See the end of the chapter for
When Steve let go and got up Tony's breath had already diminished, his eyes closed and body limp. Nothing remaining of the inventor but a husk of a body. He was dead, and the only thing reducing the pain that stabbed through Steve's heart was the knowledge that he, at the very least, managed to share one last experience with him, and perhaps made it all less painful for him.
"I… truly thought this would be different. But you could never see, could you?" he muttered, a bark of laughter rolling out of his mouth as he crossed his arms across his chest, while Tony was still lying motionless, scared to move in the wrong way and provoking Steve to touch him again.
Tony moaned something under his breath but nodded curtly as Rhodey handed him a small box which at the press of a button expanded into a full workstation complete with a StarkPad, several tools and some half-finished prototypes Rhodey determined would not require power tools to finish building, he included the one he built himself for laughs just to watch as Tony took it apart without two thoughts about the matter.
The next day, Rhodey took the job.
In his car, Natasha was already waiting in the back seat when he got in, frightening Happy who had just finished fending off the swarms of journalist who were not satisfied with the announcements he'd given already, looking for another scoop, another comment.
The silence between them remained consistent for several more moments, and just as they saw Happy draw closer to them with a carton box bigger than his head, presumably full of donuts, Tony broke it.
"No, you are here to arrest me." He snarled, causing her to recoil from him, her weapon right back in the air. "We are doing nothing wrong, Nat. just… strengthening the bond that was already there. Taking time, like you suggested." He sighed then, staring at the both of them. "we needed this to figure everything out, both of us."
To ease the pain, he had to do things. He created a suit of armor – amazing, truly a marvel. He wasn't going to be modest about it, he knew what he had created and he felt justified to his pride in it. Even when wearing it brought more pain, more injury. Even when it caused those he thought loved him to turn against him – it was the only thing to offer a contrast for the much deeper sort of pain, the other side of the coin called "Iron Man".
"Jarvis, summon an armor that has a cloaking technology over here. I know Tony made one." He said softly, "the mansion… Stark Mansion, is it empty now?" some of the tension in Tony's muscles relaxed under his touch, the wrinkles in his furrowed brow smoothed as Rhodey spoke, and he wasn't sure if it was because Tony subconsciously knew that he was being rescued, or because his body was failing and had no strength to keep the tension in his muscles any longer. When the AI replied positively he got up and gathered Tony from the floor, he was lighter than he ever could have anticipated, and his body was limp in his arms.
That's… what Pepper would say. Jim tried, he tried looking at Iron-Man and seeing it as a horrible thing that put his best friend in constant danger - instead he saw an engineering miracle, a tool that allowed Tony to perform incredible things for the betterment of the world - for the future. It brought back that idealistic, incredibly idiotic, risk-taking,
"You are my Knight in an Advanced Threat Response Battle Suit, I'm going to turn War-Machine into a medieval armor next time you come to me for an upgrade." Tony squeezed on Rhodey's un-injured hand as he joked, though the both of them had averted their eyes from each other. "I… it terrifies me, but I don't think he was lying, Rhodey."
He sat on the chair on Tony's bedside and watched as he again called a nurse to take care of his too protective friend.
The woman eyed Steve, obvious recognition of who he was shown in her attitude. She was not a fan, apparently. "Ok, Colonel. Will we be seeing you again next week?"
Tony kept quiet, his breathing heavy and ineffective. He knew Steve had tried to initiate conversation between them, or hear some words that Tony had no intention of ever saying. He lowered his eyes to watch him hook the machine into a hidden, biometric panel protected power outlet and bit his lip at the sound of whirring once it started working. He was impatient and an idiot, which was why he outstretched his hand to take hold of the oxygen mask on his own, only to freeze in that position, when it was unsurprisingly grabbed by Steve first.
"I'm sorry." Her voice when she sobbed in his ear was something Tony was certain he'd never get to hear, but there it was. And he couldn't even feel a bit smug about it.
He found Bucky sitting at a large desk, looking over what looked from afar like pictures, his long hair clean and pulled into a messy bun on the top of his head, his skin regained some of the color Steve remembered from their childhoods, and was no longer the pale, ghostly shade of someone who had not seen the sun in seventy years. There was really just one problem with the picture as Steve saw it, one big problem.
"There are times I wish you had a real body so I can strangle you." Bruce grits under his breath. "I'm doing it, all of it, to help Tony! we are all doing whatever we can! But we can't do the best we can if you don't trust us!"
Three weeks later, he came back from Budapest with James Buchanan Barnes in tow.
They Marathon–nitpicked Star Trek for the rest of the night, and it felt almost like the old days.
after their fights. Maybe that was why he was so difficult all the time.
Some part of him wanted to believe that the person who did this to Rhodey was not his teammate, was not the person who assaulted him, was not… waiting outside his room again. A shudder caused him to bury his face in his casted arms against his knees, not really crying – not in the ugly sort of way. For a moment he still wanted all of this to be a dream.
We are not here to fight you." Her voice was soft, and if Steve had not known her skills he would have perhaps believed her words. Unfortunately for her, he was well experienced in that regard.
"There's no time for that. Just… what are you running, if not my queries?" he poked the hologram of a process in order to view it, only to be greeted by a blaring alarm telling him his access had been restricted. The Hulk roared in his head. How dare they? He should smash it, destroy it. It was hurting the metal man.
"We should get him into custody as soon as possible," Clint said once Bruce was done treating his wounds – a sprained ankle and some fractured ribs, but otherwise in a much better shape than both Natasha and Steve, he wasn't part of the fight for as long as either of them, and he had the element of surprise on his side once he re-joined it. "We need, need to get Nat to a hospital, and we need to lock… lock
And if they did not, if Tony did break… Rhodey will be there to pick up the pieces, and he will be there to exact revenge on whoever struck the final blow against Tony.
Go back to the basics.
"St-Steve…" the name eventually rolled out on his numb tongue, though choked and barely audible made the Captain freeze for a moment and meet Tony's eyes. Bloodshot and blown up so desperate for reassurance, for Captain America to help him – tell him it was going to be alright… and let him die. Let him rest.
Next chapter might get graphic.
"I will never… do anything
If after this chapter you find yourself in need of some fluff and comfort, please give my other fics a chance ;)
"Not if I found him," Steve said, and Tony snorted a distressed laughter. Steve didn't seem to notice, "That's what the facility was for, Tony. to have him be comfortable and safe while we-"
Rhodey needs to get all the spotlight tbh. Also some bonding time with JARVIS, who is probably going to be more dangerous than even the Hulk when (if) the truth comes out.
Steve crossed his arms over his chest, and tilted his head. Tried to look as non-threatening as possible as he took a step back from Tony, hoping to ease him enough to remove the knife from the vicinity of his throat. He knew that it would be safe to step in, then. But Tony was too smart to fall for that trap – he was aware that Steve could take the step forward before he could manipulate his damaged hands back into position, and he didn't lower the knife from where it began cutting into his neck.
He didn't like the idea. If Tony had means to work he would do that instead of rest, he would exert himself until he collapsed and in his current condition that could be potentially deadly. However, when Tony looked at him again it was with a grateful gaze, his big eyes brimming with relief and emotion – if he'd never been conditioned by his father to keep all of that feeling inside, Bruce thought Tony would probably break down and cry for hours. Some part of him hoped his friend would be able to break that dam now and just let him comfort him through tears, somehow he thought it would be easier than dealing with the lack of them – sometimes tearing down the dam was necessary.
Steve, stop being so awful. GOD.
"I have alerted the police, based on their case priorities, traffic and their initial disbelief in my report, I predict it will take up to twenty minutes for them to get here." Another pause, "Sir, the panic room-"
The heat burned as he watched blood trickle along Tony's skin… Was Tony aware that he was doing this to him? Was it on purpose? He didn't mind playing the game.
She didn't say a thing, but he could see the trails of tears in her makeup.
It was too hard to imagine a man as powerful as Tony Stark could ever actually need Sam Wilson's help.
"Awesome." Tony got up slowly, his breath heavy and mind beginning to cloud. He took his oxygen-emitter out of his dash pocket and took a few moments to just breath, ignoring and pained grunts the super-soldier sprawled on the floor, covered with small glass shards was making. He rearranged his clothes, taking special care at smoothing any crumple that could hint at the rough treatment they suffered moments before.
Rhodey and Sam were out nearly all the time, Clint and Natasha were scheduled for the morning, and were keeping an eye on the queries run by Jarvis and the news in the meantime, and Thor was searching in more remote locations, despite no one believing Steve had gotten too far with an injured, barely recovered Tony and no known means of transportation.
Ross was red in the face with rage, stepping around the empty suits, whom at a gesture from Tony's hand, allowed it. "You! You have attacked a national operative, this is beyond you and your lover's quarrel with the captain, Stark! This is about national security!"
If the need to stay able to give his friend proper treatment hadn't reined him in, Bruce would have hulked out and destroyed what was left of Manhattan out of sheer contempt against his own ignorance.
you tell me? Have you run any other queries on your own? Please tell me."
Hey guys! Sorry for the delay. I went on a short and unexpected vacation in Berlin (Which was really awesome but also so COLD I almost gone to sleep just to wake up 70 years later.)
Didn't matter if it did, Steve treated any complaint that Tony dared make as either spoiled behavior or a challenge, like he did with Tony's breathing woes, where his solution was an inhaler of all things – only helpful to a point as the medicine did help expand and clear Tony's airways to let more air in, but truly did nothing to help his lungs absorb the extra oxygen he needed so his body could function correctly and start healing. Trying to explain to Steve that what he needed was a breathing machine meant trying to convince him to take him to a hospital again or provide him technology, and that just made the man suspicious and set him in a bad mood, and that meant more pain, more fear. Tony didn't need more of those in his life.
"Rogers? You mean Steve?" Rhodey prompted and immediately caught the hitch in Tony's breath when the name was spoken, "Tony what are you talking about?"
The whales returned.
Coming out of a detached moment of thought, Tony was tuning in to a conversation being held outside the door, the voices were both harsh whispers, two people shouting very quietly at each other, unaware that speaking normally would probably have had the exact same effect.
Steve felt the usual mix of ire and excitement that accompanied each of his and Tony's arguments start to bubble in his gut. Even unconscious, Tony could provoke him with his mere presence in close proximity, maddening Steve with his argumentative nature even if only in his own head.
"You son of a…" a voice said behind him, and Steve turned to meet the eyes of Colonel James Rhodes – the man's hands clenched at the sides of his body as he composed himself and progressed towards him, his eyes closing as he took a deep breath. "Steve," his voice was icy, causing a light shudder to pass through Steve's body before he could help himself. The use of his first name had caught him off guard, as the Colonel usually referred to him by his rank.  "You were told to keep your distance. Bruce told you, the nurses told you,
"But you do." Finally, his voice rasped dryly as he opened his eyes and looked straight at Steve. The uneasiness in his gut burned. Steve looked at him in surprise, as if not accustomed to get replies from Tony. then he smiled and his face lightened up the way it would have months ago, as they joked with each other or had some rare, cute conversation about their lives. For a moment, the monster turned back into the Steve Rogers he knew.
Here, his mind had become dazed, a thought not lingering in his mind for enough time to actually form and have substance, his broken hands unable to build or hold on or even stop shaking uncontrollably all the time – and so useless, neither could provide any distractions from the time crawling by.
The rest of the was spent with Rhodes talking enthusiastically about what he called an 'engineering miracle', apparently the Colonel was quite the geek, and knew how to explain several functions of the suit with a lot of detail Sam didn't quite understand. It was a little better when he started to describe the weaponry, and Rhodes promised to give him a demonstration sometime, perhaps even spar with him if he felt up to it. It was a pleasant and inspiring conversation.
he got past Jarvis and the suits also remained unsolved. The A.I. seemed as conflicted as him by the data being missing – an entire half hour before the alarm started was just gone, consistent with the hospital's own security records.
Whatever happened – and Bruce was now just beginning to estimate how disastrous that was – made Steve pause for a bit, then, when he talked, his voice was laced with a peculiar kind of anger that made chills run up Bruce's spine, and the Hulk inside him a little too excited for his liking. "I watched him
When he got out of the room he didn't call Rhodes. He would – eventually. But there was something else on his mind at the moment, more important than taking Tony's cars for a spin, all that could wait.
There was so much stress in his muscles he thought he could break someone's bones without any help from the Other Guy, as puny as he was in this form. he was holding back on Him, and the Hulk didn't like being held back, it didn't like that his Metal-Man was hurt and sad, he wanted to
"The facility was a mistake, Steve. It was… inhumane and-" Tony quietened down when Steve narrowed the gap between them by just one small step, he couldn't see him, but Steve's glare was near physically painful, burning holes into his back while at the same time managing to make everything around seem colder.
Ross growled at him but gestured at his goons to carry Steve out of there. "You will not get away with this, Stark. This is much bigger than your little grudge."
Too bad, the bleeding did not weaken much, and other wounds all over Tony's body demanded just as much attention as Steve was giving the cut on his thigh and it was impossible- he winced when Tony gasped in pain again – his only option was to take advantage of his last opportunity, hope he could make it good enough to make Tony's departure less painful.
He closed his eyes and bit his lip in an attempt to calm himself, wondering if the shark got spooked by his thrashing and decided not to take a bite out of him  and instead went away, but he didn’t dare look. The salt water he swallowed made his throat scratchy and trying to get his voice to come out was painful, but that was not what stopped him from calling out for help.
"Tony I swear to god-" Rhodey paused, he and Tony were about the same size, in fact, Tony was taller – and smug about it to no end – but at the moment Rhodey was towering over him, almost. "You have… If it's… if it's Stockholm syndrome, if you feel like… like that for him…"
Somehow, he knew that once he went to sleep he would not get up again. Be it because Steve would definitely kill him once he was done with Natasha, or because his body was at the last stages of complete failure, there was no doubt anymore that those were his last moments awake ever again.
The realization that he might have really fallen in love and started a relationship with this man if none of this happened hit Tony hard enough that he flinched, closed his eyes as tears started to emerge from them and shook his head. "No, you… you sick… I will
Rhodey may have over indulged himself at Tony's minibar. He was trashing Tony's lab. He realized he was doing it after the third picture frame he broke and shattered on the floor, and he couldn't quite stop. The paintings themselves were not harmed – Tony would hate him if they were… the man was an art and antique
Steve yawned beside him, cutting abruptly his amateur humming as his hand slackened a bit around Tony's waist, allowing him the slightest freedom to move his body somewhat away from Steve's warmth.
. Anything would be better than him just being the same old Steve who had raped Tony to death under a collapsed building. Anything would.
"Colonel?" Jarvis' voice blared in his ear and he shook the thoughts from his head, his anger and frustration dissipating in favor of cold, calculated planning. He asked Jarvis to show him a scan of the area and took into account the visible and hidden weaponry scattered around, being familiar with Tony's style, he was able to pinpoint likely locations for more hidden weaponry, and laughed shakily as he compared the artillery remaining in War Machine's inventory. It wasn't even nearly enough.
Rhodey looked back at Sam as Tony struggled to get his breathing back in order, the man looked scandalized and hurt and shook his head at Rhodey while mouthing that he had no idea what Tony was talking about.
you."
This chapter is a bit short, sorry.
Rhodey kept quiet for a moment, looking at his friend's unconscious face partially hidden behind grown out bangs of hair. He was clean shaven, and Rhodey was thrown back years just by looking at him. The removal of his facial hair, which Rhodey had no qualms about calling ridiculous – combined with the reduction of his body mass, resulted in a ten years younger looking man more similar to the boy he spent his precious time doting on all through college, than any version of adult Tony stark he could think of.
He didn't recognize him at first. He knew it was him, there wasn't anyone else it could have been, and Jarvis confirmed it. They were wrong, he was… he was wrong, when the doubt reared its ugly head and crawled around in his mind, he'd been wrong, and just a little bit right as well - to trust in the sheer stubbornness of Tony Stark.
Steve sat, still as a statue inside the enforced glass cell. It was the same material they have used to hold the Hulk, and Steve's strength could not fracture it – not for lack of trying. Getting zapped every time he tried was not helping either. Eventually, convinced that this was just a minor setback, he stopped his effort and started looking for other ways out, instead.
"Please don't…" Tony murmured under his hitched breath, but it didn't seem like Steve heard him, or maybe he was just ignoring him. He seemed to have developed a condition of selective hearing during the last few days, refusing to hear things that didn't fit into his narrative of what he saw as their budding relationship.

"Come on, Sam…" Steve tried coaxing, another smile finding its way to his lips, "You don't mean that. I'm not mad, we are still friends, right? I can talk to Ross, we can put together a better team, New and better Avengers – you and me and Bucky-"
Once Tony was wrapped in warm blankets in the small nest of pillows Steve had made for him, placed in a small and bleak room Tony had designated in his plans an 'even Safer room', Steve hooked in the breathing machine into another hidden wall socket and loaded it with a fresh and full oxygen tank – a precaution, most of all. He had no reason to believe that he would be gone for more than a few hours, at most, but if for some reason that was not the case… he knew he could count on Tony to make do until he came back to him, but Tony's body was traitorous, so such precautions had to be taken.
(See the end of the chapter for
Of course, the door had been sealed shut and he was trapped inside the small room, which, as it were, Tony had started to realize was way smaller than he initially thought. Suddenly it felt like the walls were closing in on him until vertigo hit and he went down to his knees, covering his head as he closed his eyes and breathed deeply. He heard a crush and a shout, again, it sounded like Natasha. Steve would not hurt her, right? She was one of
, If I may ask, are you doing here?"
loved him, and that didn't change. That kind of feeling didn't weaken or disappear; not really.
And then the media found out about Tony being missing, and all hell broke loose.
And now… now he had to deal with the Avengers too, on top of it all.
He knew he was being an idiot, he knew the best thing to do was to go hide and cower in the panic room and not leave it until the police or one of the Avengers got there but he chose not to, and he knew what he was doing.
Natasha kept her face set as stone, not part of her body moved an inch further than how it was supposed to, like a perfectly carved statue she stood and aimed her weapon at him, assured in her resolve as if she and Steve were not teammates how brought down an entire branch of corrupt government together, as if she and him had not bonded as fugitives from the law just months before.
Tony replayed in his mind the last time Steve stood over him like that. 'I thought you'd be dead… that's why I did it…' those words seemed too morbid to be real, too gross to have come from between the lips of who he considered an ally, a friend… perhaps a role-model, even if he'd never admitted it – how could it be real, how could the act the words referenced to be real – but it
"Too bad our ex-team demolished it. We don't really have time to build another one. Do we?" Tony turned halfway, finding Steve looking at him, hopeful like a Labrador dog who was promised a treat, a small smile plastered across his lips, when Tony didn't answer the Labrador smile turned into a vicious, predatory glower. He took another step forward, Tony instinctively stepped back, his flank knocking several wall-mounted screwdrivers from their mounts and onto the floor. "Not answering is as bad as lying, Tony. I don't like it when you lie."
that you won't even let people help you." Tony winced, only his free hand supported him against the wall as he took a step backward. "That's what I am trying to do, Tony! I was helping you. And you hate me for that? You cannot possibly be that arrogant, that selfish?"
Steve, whose lips were tracing the lines of his body and hands were stroking down his stomach and thighs, squeezing down on their softness while Tony was lying motionless on the bed, his heart just barely recovering from the cardiac event it had suffered through without the proper care, medicine and monitoring. He had oxygen now, that, at least, kept him from getting worse again.
He wanted to do it peacefully, sit everyone down and talk about what had happened, he just wanted to do it after he and Tony had their relationship figured out – but was he ever given that opportunity? From the moment he realized he was given second chance at it, at every turn, someone was there to stop him from talking to Tony. of course, at first it might have been for the best; he was misguided. He thought Tony could not possibly be the same anymore, that his Tony was already - and should stay – dead. There still was a sliver of that thought hanging in the back of his mind, bugging him. But… he couldn't really let him go again, not without knowing, really knowing if there was anything, even the slightest reminder of Tony in there.
... " Steve hurried to his side when Tony's legs gave out under him. He was freezing after having stood wet and naked in the chilly air of the facility for the last several minutes, his skin was developing a worrying bluish tang of color where he was the palest. Tony writhed under his hands, his fingers clutched on the handle of the knife as he tried and miserably failed to keep it in a threatening position on his throat. It was in Steve's hand not soon enough, after only grazing the skin of Tony's neck twice more.
. He stopped with the paintings and moved on to the work area, where he pushed unfinished diagrams and schematics off the table along with work tools and incomplete stereotypes, he knew things broke when they hit the floor, he knew and he didn't care. What good were any of those things Tony was building – he noticed a schematic for a new rocket launcher for War machine – what good was any of it if it couldn't even protect his best friend?
"Don't be mad, platypus… I needed… I needed to work. Do something. I can't… be in just that room all the time." Rhodey didn't answer, his fingers moved through Tony's - much in need of a haircut - hair gently, and Tony knew he understood and will not further reprimand him on getting up. "I couldn't make anything…" he whispered, "It's gone, everything… just blank, not there anymore."
The hospital systems were apparently out of commission due to a large scale power outage, and while medical equipment was powered by a separate generator to save lives of patients who were dependant on it, security equipment like cameras was shut down to conserve power. For Jarvis, there was no such convenient excuse. There were a few options that could explain it, but each seemed less plausible than its predecessor.
He knew the setup of the small cabin he was held in, he had helped fund its creation. He recalled with a growing sickness in his gut how Steve had come into his lab months ago and told him of Bucky, and what he wanted to do when he found him. The idea was to create a place where the Winter Soldier could be held comfortably and discreetly while they worked out how to break Hydra's hold on him – nothing that could be used as a weapon was to be found, all the heavy furniture was reinforced and attached to the floor to prevent even someone of Steve's strength from lifting it and using it to break the door or the windows. Everything, in fact, was reinforced in steel and made to withstand even the Hulk's strength - at least for a while.
Jarvis didn't answer him, Tony knew it was because he was being such an idiot that even a computer could tell, and maybe even be a bit mad about it, it made him both proud and annoyed that his creations could judge him like this, like the rest of the world did.
When they got to the hospital, they found Pepper – and a giant teddy bear in Iron man colors, and a two bouquets – one of the flowers and one of red, gold and silver "get well" balloons, all held awkwardly by Happy Hogan, who looked like he had not slept in a week. When Rhodey offered to relieve him of at least some of his burdens, the bodyguard shook his head and frowned in full offense.
No one except him and Steve and… perhaps Wilson who was Steve's confidant in all that regarded the Winter Soldier knew about the location. Even if they did – they would not be able to break him out easily. It was all in the design… and it was such a smart design,
"Cap… Rogers also had a hard time accepting Tony was alive at first. He argued Tony s
The thought of this body belonging to Tony disheartened him.
Steve's hands were around his neck and were squeezing, crushing it with strength reserved for the nation's most iconic hero, Captain America. The man who was, at the moment, killing him.
As his tongue invaded the gap of Tony's mouth Steve moved his hands softly down his sides, feeling cracked, broken ribs under torn skin and flesh, smelling the burnt stink about it as his fingers pressed down on what should have been a soft and plump ass but turned out to be stiff now. It was disappointing, contradicting the image he created for himself. Tony was so far gone now… if Steve wanted to make it before he was completely gone he'd have to hurry. He kept on kissing Tony as one of his hand aligned his cock with the little stretched ring of muscle, palming his length until a slow and steady drip of pre-cum started, and as far as Steve was concerned that was supposed to satisfy the need for lubrication.
"I was a little worried when I heard that it was Rhodes who found Bucky." Steve said then, and Tony startled, brought back into reality by the mention of his best friend's name. "He is very confrontational, not really a good trait for someone in high ranks. I should know." He chuckled, "I mean, I guess I get it. He is over-protective of you because he was liaison to Stark industries for so long, and he needs you to maintain the armor he stole from you. Anyone would get mad if you called them out on this kind of shit."
In the present, he had some people who were like that – Sam, for example.
Despite everything, he still held on to the idea of Tony by his side, alive and happy. It was still within the scopes of fantasy, as it turned out… Steve wanted to believe otherwise for a while, but was proven right in his precautious thinking – when put to the test, Tony still had enough arrogance in him to deceive and lie to him for benefits, and that just didn't fit the bill of what he was trying to achieve.
The oxygen mask was taken away, and the air turned stale and unsatisfactory. Tony gasped softly and turned to look at Steve, he felt himself trembling, the picture he created for himself in his mind crushing into pieces at once.
“Jarvis… I…” he closed his eyes. “Cancel everything, Jarvis, I am taking a sick day.”
"It could still be anyone else. Maybe Loki came by for payback during all the chaos… he has a thing for alien invasions, and it would explain the hallucinations." Clint shrugged and grinned at Thor whose smile turned into a frown in a blink of an eye at hearing his brother's name.
That was why he went there, going against the warning Rhodey gave him just before leaving the country again, his voice remorseful in the same way as it always been lately, only now guilt ridden as well. Tony knew something happened when he went to deliver Barnes' new prosthetic arm and check on the recovering brainwashed Hydra assassin, but Rhodey refused to tell him what it was.
When he looked at Tony now, he couldn't find regret for what happened. Sure, it would have been better if they did that in a bedroom, and if Stark was not a broken body on the verge of death, it would have been nice if he could participate and express his own love and appreciation of Steve as he did Tony's. The scenario could not have been much worse for their first time – had it not been their potential last time as well.
Bruce hesitated, Tony was obviously repressing the cause for his repeated panic attacks, his fear of sleep indicated nightmares, despite having been administered drugs that were supposed to shut those down completely. "I guess… Colonel Rhodes is back in the tower, I can call him and ask him to bring back a StarkPad."
But it was absolutely depressing. Clint had no desire to be the one walking out of there and having to face Rhodes, who had kept his hopes high and refused to even acknowledge the possibility of his best friend not being there anymore. The least he could do was try to look around some more, maybe find something of Tony's to bring back with him, or a clue about the location of what was left. Steve acted and talked like there was nothing wrong at all, like He and Tony were a single entity, or a couple of some sort. It was sickening, but it also meant that perhaps Steve kept something to remember Tony by, something that would keep his sick delusion going.
Tony cleared his throat and stood quietly, waiting for the crowd to calm down before speaking.
as I've mentioned before, I'm a student with nearly zero free time for personal projects, so getting this done was not easy, but I'm really glad I did it.
Rhodey groaned again and got up, one of his eyes was swollen and was starting to bruise, Tony looked at him sympathetically. "Look at us, we match now." He quipped, trying to lighten the mood though he knew such a feat was not really possible, Rhodey looked at him now, his eyes sharp and steady and his lips set in a frown.
After a sleepless night of rescue and cleanup duty, the team - minus Tony and Natasha, who was indisposed as well, was debriefed on the events of the previous day, at the end of which Bruce got up to update them on their teammate's health.
Tony murmured something about 'Christmas' and 'revenge'but otherwise kept quiet. The was obviously something off in the atmosphere. He knew from Bruce's frequent updates that Tony had refused to take pain medication, and had tried on several occasions to bribe a doctor into letting him go. He was jumpy, paranoid and refused to sleep, and it all had something to do with Steve Rogers.
Steve lost his patience with Tony's lack of answer and let go, straightening his back as his eyes thinned, catching Tony's gaze like a spider does a fly. Then a chuckle left his lips – despite the lack of change in his features.
"Yes, Sir. The arm's repulsors seem to function perfectly well and on cue, power levels are raising quickly and will soon be at ninety-five percent."
a bomb, but with Tony, one could never know.
It's not that he didn't like or worry about Tony – he'd went to a local Support center to get some material about PTSD and coping with sexual assault and then promptly discarded all of it because the feeling of overstepping some invisible boundary was overwhelming him from the moment he stepped into the tower. It was dumb, being a counselor was a part of him, an important part. Helping people who had gone through something awful, as he had, as all of the Avengers have – it was something that should have come easily to him.
true, Steve conceded to himself, yet couldn't find it himself to feel bad about it. It seemed like the right thing to do, at the time. Tony just needed to see his perspective, understand why. "I did… it would have been the merciful path to take. I am so sorry I couldn't do it… I love you, I want us to have another opportunity…"
"Your arm was hurt when you crushed, though." He said softly, as if talking to a child, "how can you blame this on me, Tony? this is… it's horrible."
"He just holed up in there, giving my nurses the 'Captain America' glare and barks orders at them!" Her face was one of pure rage as she talked about Steve, slandering the Captain for about three minutes for the way he treated the employees under her command. She kept on talking for ages, so Bruce couldn't really be blamed for drifting away from the conversation a bit. "-"-Even the Colonel – Bless his heart, he was so polite all the time. He got up and got out of the room when it was needed to change a diaper… even if he did leave that armor around all the time. He let me touch it, actually. Mr. Stark designed that thing – did he not? Such a brilliant young man, so sad, so sad." She shook her head, looking genuinely gloomy on Tony's behalf. "No one deserves what he was through, you just can't go through it and be the same. No wonder he gets panicked."
His murmured rejections went unanswered as Steve leaned down, his free hand cupping Tony's chin and cheek to turn his face for a breath-stealing kiss, just like before. Silencing him and ignoring any complaint that was impossible to make.
Maybe it was just what he needed all this time.
He repeated his tours of the skies of the city for two more days, joined by Clint and Natasha in the quinjet and Rhodes in his armor. These were useless, none of them had no idea where else to look, and no further sightings of Steve were found since that one night.
. Bruce thought that for a change – he agreed with that need.
Steve allowed him only a bit of privacy at the toilet, citing Tony's dignity as he turned his back to him, not leaving the room.
"Colonel, I believe I may have found a lead."
He was leaving. Tony felt a wave of relief followed by a tsunami of anxiety. Steve was going away and Tony would have to stay in the small building alone, barely able to walk, barely managing to breathe. And who knows when he would come back and what he would do then.
Some people on the team said this was just the pair of them flirting – but Sam saw, well… Sam experienced Steve's form of flirting, and had seen the way Stark could schmooze reporters and young fans until they all had hearts in their eyes, and from his point of view flirting was not really what he would call those interactions between the two.
"If I do that," He started, his voice cautious and his eyes readily searching for changes in Tony's expression, "I need you to promise – and Tony, I mean honestly and with full intent to follow through, no take backs or regrets – I need you to promise you will rest, and take the painkillers. Too much pain is no less dangerous than bleeding, and I can't stress enough how important it is that you sleep well." He watched as the light in Tony's eyes shut off, then the tension in his shoulders became a helpless slump. He wanted to comfort him and didn't know how. "We want you to feel better soon, we want you to be safe." He whispered, "me, Steve… everyone.
"No." Tony answered, walking towards the elevator. Its door opened immediately. "No. I am going to the workshop. It's ok."
"Jarvis, you
He jolted into awareness with an almost-scream, his voice too croaky to actually be able to make such a sound, but hell if he didn't try. He thrashed and beat his head in every direction he could without ever opening his eyes. He could feel the same fingers that choked him before rubbing at his wrist and the touch was making everything worse, he couldn't handle it, not Steve – not again.
He knew Steve would get mad and take away the air if he resisted. But he couldn't help it. A warning pinch caused him to freeze up, close his eyes as hard as they would go.
Sam knew the scenario all too well, and he could not identify but do nothing about it – so he offered to join the visit.
Rhodes blinked at him, and the corners of his mouth perked in a pained smirk. "What are you talking about? Tony loves attention, the more the merrier." He said, shaking his head as he put his hand on Sam's shoulder in a friendly gesture. "but be prepared, Happy might start crying at some point, and it's not a pretty sight."
Bruce cut the conversation quickly at that point. "Okay, enough for now." He said, his smile faltering as Tony turned to look at him with morbid exhaustion all over his face. "Tony- you need to rest. I know that's a foreign concept to you, but right now you're under my care and you will listen, or I'll call Steve and have him fawning all over you until you get too tired to stay awake." Tony didn't even argue with him, his eyes dropped and he nodded, throwing everyone off.
He barely managed to gain support by holding to the kitchen counter and waved away any of the Avengers who rushed to his aid. Shooting vile glares at them. "If you want to help, find Rogers." He said while gritting his teeth. And they looked at him helplessly, still unable to believe that this could be possible, that he, of all people, would do this.
"Tony wouldn't hold trusting your friend against you, and I don't either, okay? You've made a mistake, everyone on the team did." Rhodes' voice is calm. Not the stony, terrifying -the calm before the storm- sort, only resigned, tired maybe. "If I said I don't blame you at all, or any of the Avengers, that would be a lie. But I prefer to do this with all of you than without. The only things that matter in finding him, now." He concluded before leaving the room, the heavy boots of the War Machine armor pounding the floor on his way out.
Steve breathed in, not watching as Rhodes disappeared behind the corner leading to the exit. He was getting tired of those transgressions from the colonel. He had tried to be understanding, seeing how this man, for some reason, was one of Tony's friends despite his many offences against him, not limited to stealing the war machine suit. It was becoming too much for him to tolerate any longer. Tony was going to have to stop seeing him and maintaining that toxic relationship if they hoped to fix things between them.
He hated Steve. He hated his touch and the way he looked at him tenderly as if he truly loved him, as if Tony could love him back. He hated the words he said to him as he kissed him along the jaw and whispered in his ear and he hated that he couldn't say so.
like it, Tony." Steve's tone became dangerous, "You know you do, you shouldn't lie."
Tony’s eyes flashed to where the eyes had been, they, and the entirety of the inhuman face – were now gone, replaced by a patch of bubbling water. He opened his mouth and drew breath, ready to scream for his life – when he felt the first tug on his leg, powerful and unrelenting enough to make him lose his grip on the only thing that was keeping him afloat, and he forgot  his resolution to scream and maybe get the attention of his team. Instead, he attempted to regain his hold and kick away the nightmare creature that had its horrible hand on him.
"Soon, big guy… When we find him you can come out and smash as much as you want," he muttered, his entire body going numb as exhaustion replaced rage. "Jarvis, what
(See the end of the chapter for
When only stunned silence answered him, Rhodes once again laughed, his breath wheezing through his broken nose. "You all… you work so hard at making up excuses, when you have had the means to prove or disprove Tony's words for… how long now, Doctor? A couple of days at least, since you tested the SAK in the lab Tony provided you downstairs without any of the bureaucracy delaying the process."
So he smiled, and was about to call Steve by some nickname to get him to come over, he wanted to apologize for his little freak-out, get over that one particular barricade on the way to recovery. His words died in his throat all too soon.
He had long given up on the notion that Steve was in any way the same one he grew up idolizing, or even the one he thought he was working side by side with as equals, as teammates and perhaps even friends, the man had proven it far too many times to count by now. But somewhere in his subconscious those images of him still existed, and with every shout he heard Natasha make, the louder the disappointment and outright fear rung in his ears.
Well, hadn't Tony just manipulated him into trusting him before snatching that knife and threatening to kill himself? What if this was another ruse? What if…
"Is doing well enough without Captain America." Bruce spat, his stature seemed a bit bigger, and his skin a bit greener, before he inhaled and exhaled slowly and calmed down, "the world doesn't need a murderer, a… a rapist… claiming to protect it."
"I think Tony is having nightmares." He shared quietly, "Specifically, nightmares about you. Might be waking hallucinations as well. Do you have a theory as to what might be causing that?" he kept his voice low, tried not to sound accusing – because this is not about blame. If Steve was really the trigger to Tony's panic, there must be an explanation that can make sense. As awful as it may be – Bruce had to endure hearing it, for the sake of Tony, Steve and the rest of the team.
Ross gave him an unimpressed look. "There was never a body produced to prove that Tony Stark is truly dead." He stated, "As I understand it, they had a lover's quarrel, and Stark, being the irresponsible rascal that he is, fled somewhere in the world to not deal with it. Rogers was upset and you attacking him and refusing to hear anything he had to say didn't help." He ignored the scandalized looks on the faces of the two spies, "Steve Rogers is a pinnacle of human perfection, the perfect weapon and a damn good soldier and commander. He, of all people, does not deserve to be in that cell for something as minor as disagreeing with Stark's sensibilities."
The pharmacist was easy to charm, as he did not hide his identity from him and banked on him being an Avengers fan. The man bombarded Steve with questions about the things he wished to purchase. Was the asthma medicine for someone on the team? Captain America didn't need an inhaler, so maybe it was the archer – what was his name again? Oh, right. Hawkguy. Hawkeye? Never mind. For Captain America, it was on the house – the simple, over the counter stuff. Everything else Steve had a good look at, memorized the names and smiled at the pharmacist as he put them back in their place, promising to come back with an appropriate note from a medical doctor.
Tony went into a fight or flight mode at the very sight of him, just knowing he was Steve's friend.
He didn't so much as turn to face Steve as he knocked down the doors effortlessly and entered the workshop, though his breathing did turn heavier again, and his chest seemed to constrict tightly around his heart and lungs.
After Bruce left, a couple of nurses came into the room to care for him, they talked with each other cheerfully, and asked Tony some questions – both medical and ones pertaining to his Iron Man or Tony Stark persona, positively delighted when he answered fully and to the point, fulfilling fantasies with short anecdotes about his adventures as an Avenger and funny stories about other celebrities he'd met, most of it was half-truths combined with small white lies to make them more exciting.
He didn't sound happy. Tony closed his eyes, the pain coursing through his body was overwhelming and the need to scream was nagging at his mind but he
Could he get to sleep then?
burden – but he was Rhodey's idiot, and he has already taken it on.
It was good. He managed to get Tony out of that hospital, out of the grasp of people who would have him believing something was wrong with what he and Steve shared, away from the people who couldn't protect and save him when he was dying under the collapsed building – that was Steve. He found him, he moved the debris and handled the wounds as best as he could under the circumstances, he called for help. He deserved to be happy with the person his heart chose, who was essentially made for him.
The nurse who said the last line smiled warmly and winked at him, exposing Tony's embarrassment at the kind words, she was cleaning him before another nurse was changing his sheets, all was done efficiently and gently, and Tony was tempted to ask if they could receive tips for their great service.
And they wouldn't let him find out. Tony himself was rejecting him, not willing to hear what he had to say. Bruce had contaminated their consummation with words like 'Rape' and 'Sexual assault' without actually knowing what had happened, Natasha implied that he wouldn't have done it if he had a choice - which was false, because the choice was there and he took it and couldn't find regret at doing so – they all stayed blind to the act of love that transpired, insisting instead on victimizing Tony and himself by making up a tragic story for their own comfort.
Well, try to enjoy.
"Raise your chin for me, baby…" Steve whispered in his ear and then bent his own head to kiss him again before leaning Tony's body against the wall where he slumped down passively and stepping out, he came back with a canister of shaving soap and a safety razor. At the sight of them, Tony's hands shot to his face.
The long strain of words left him nearly breathless, but there was no more time to breathe. Steve was getting up.
Rhodey inhaled again and blinked, from where he was standing at the entrance he could not see the entire room, so just because it looked empty, didn't mean it really was. The armor was too big to fit through the door, so he didn't try to enter until he was released from it, somehow it seemed that rushing in into the room just to find it empty, or worse… it would be horrible, he couldn't do it like that, he had to be prepared.
They looked into each other eyes, deadpan expressions lasting but a minute before they both burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter, just in time for Pepper and Happy to come back and stare at them and the small metal sphere hovering above their heads in confusion.
you. They don't know who you truly are, what you truly want."
Steve looked at Tony – the man breathing through tubes and an oxygen mask, his face lined with years and worries was nothing less than deplorable, his hair still lined with crusted mats of blood and filth. He was pale, and by all means
“Jarvis…” he wasn’t sure if his voice even materialized audibly at all. “Something… something is not okay with me.” He blinked slowly, he was not sure what he’d been saying – the fog in his mind made thinking too hard, too much of an effort. He could just relax, just let himself let go and lay down comfortably. Wouldn’t that be something, now? His head dropped down, eyes too foggy to register the sight of the cluttered floor and crumpled designs at his feet.
Maybe it really was just a matter of time before the two of them advanced their weird relationship into something more, took out their frustrations with each-other in a more effective way. Steve was sure that Tony was just as interested as he was. The rest of the team realized it too, some of them knew that it was so a long time before Steve thought of it himself, and had teased them about it at any moment, relishing on flustered expressions and faces turning red.
Rhodey tightened his grip as he listened to Tony's rambles and quiet sobbing. His best friend wasn't the same person. Not like he wasn't the same person after Afghanistan, or after New York – both have left a visible crack in his friend's armor, and on his soul. This time it was nowhere near being just a crack, it shattered him in and out, leaving jagged pieces to be picked up and reassembled excruciatingly slowly, and as time went by Rhodey became more and more convinced that too many pieces were missing now for it to ever be possible. He resented the thought, told Pepper and Happy and the crew of private therapists and doctors who unknowingly tried to convince him to not get his hopes up, not understanding that his hopes shattered the moment he saw Tony in the padded room, He told all of them, and most of all to himself, that it was wrong. That Tony was strong enough to overcome. Tony was invincible.
It didn't really matter though. Steve's hands moved across the now bare body under him, not holding back his strength to manhandle Tony into a more approachable position – leaning against a piece of concrete with his head upright, cloudy eyes looking but not seeing Steve right before him, lips murmuring inaudible, incomprehensible things. Gashes across the flesh of his thighs leaked blood down his legs still at a slow, constant pace, turning his skin red and sticky. Steve stopped for a moment when his eyes spotted one of the deeper cuts. He knew what he was doing was not doing any good to any of those wounds, that he was making any chance of a recovery drop to the negative numbers by not performing any first aid routines. As it were, he was probably making the situation much worse.
Bruce's glare was icy and hard, and as he got up from the stool he sat on while taking Steve's blood, he was shivering with rage. "Rights? Steve, do you even realize what you've done? You dare talk about rights after you stripped another human being of his? As for the purpose of this cell – it is meant to hold dangerous things that pose a threat to others. between the two of us, the one whose lack of self-control caused the death of our teammate was not colored green."
Well, Hi.
The repulsor ray hit the door once, then it hit it another time. The door wasn't as heavy and enforced as the main entrance to the cabin was, on account of it being hidden so thoroughly. It came down when he shot both of his gauntlet repulsors at the same time, the third time. Rhodey kept his eyes closed a few more seconds, staying rooted where he stood as the dust settled and inhaling the filtered air his suit provided. A he opened his eyes, his mask receded and revealed him to the mostly empty room. The walls were white and padded to stop the dweller of the room from harming himself, on the far side, there was what looked like a nest of dirty blanket and some pillows, and next to them was a small breathing machine, but no one was using it at the moment.
Steve lifted his head and stared longingly out of the window, following a cloud of ash and smoke trailing out of the destroyed portion of Manhattan. "I'm not the one with a medical degree, Dr. Banner." He said, "I assume, between the two of us, you are the one more qualified to give a diagnosis." Bruce knew he failed at keeping his voice blameless, he bit inside his mouth and coughed a bit.
"Why should he trust you with Tony's safety, Banner? You said yourself you would not 'Tear apart the team' over it." Colonel Rhodes voice suddenly interjected from all around him. "The information Jarvis is withholding from the team is information they will choose to ignore and dismiss for their own selfishness, you are so obvious, a computer, a very smart computer of course, but one nonetheless, sees through your bullshit."
The helplessness was eating at him all night, he thought of calling one of the Avengers over because misery loved company, but the thought of any of them walking around in Tony's personal space after being exposed to private information about his state was suddenly repulsive to him. He wasn't even sure what he himself was doing there, and the guilt joined helplessness in consuming him from the inside-out. The breakdown happened and the aftermath produced a small, light emitting gadget Rhodey wasn't sure about the purpose it fulfilled. He was pretty sure it was
The whale song drowned out his screams, overpowering the sounds of distress as his own nails dug into the skin of his stomach and hips, trying to rip it away to get to the source of the burning, and get everything back to where it was meant to be.
No. no. he couldn't think that way. Mistrust and caution were essential, but also caused the rift between them to deepen further. Whether Tony really was undergoing a severe medical emergency or not, Steve had to show him that he would be there for him, that he would work to rebuild the bridge of friendship and love between them. If Tony tried to do something wrong that would hinder that effort Steve would be the bigger person and deal with it.
He unfolded his body, slowly moving to sit up. Looking down his naked body, he found more evidence of self-harm – scratches, some deeper than others, along his hips and thighs and at any spot that burned in his dream during the night.
Rhodes answered that a vacation would be nice, his voice breaking somewhere along the line when he jokingly tried to ask if he could join.
– her words – and was not leaving the room to let the nurses do their jobs, would not even let them pull out a curtain to take care of the less attractive chores of caring for a human being.
Another shuddery, painful breath left his throat. "The nurses didn't rape me or tried to kill me."
The location is nice – quiet, but not too far from the city. The road is not too bumpy and his motorcycle rides on it well enough, even if the ride is not the smoothest he ever made, it's not the worst either. There are roads in Brooklyn that are more or less the same, so it's really fine by that standard.
The commanding tone made it clear that Rhodes was pulling rank on Steve, and despite the both of them being out of uniform and Steve not really being under the Military's command chain anymore, the interaction itself was quite enough to make him straighten his back and shift his stance, almost automatically, to Attention.
The man was awake, but his eyes were shut closed with his brow creased with lines of pain and effort, his breath was quick and shallow like he was trying to get too much air but was getting too little instead, despite the oxygen mask strapped tightly over his mouth and nose and around his head. He sweated so much a thick sheen made every patch of bare skin of his body shine, he was too pale and his entire body looked tense and trembled horribly.
But it wasn't the time to think about it.
"We vetted all the doctors here, Dr. Garcia was one of the surgeons who operated on Tony, they're very accomplished and knows what they're doing." He said with the same frostiness he used on Ms. Song a few minutes before, only to regret it when Steve looked at him with injured baby-blues, like an over-grown Labrador. "Steve, I understand how you feel. I am worried for his well-being too but I can't- I will not be here all of the time, we can't be here all of the time. Tony is due for a long recovery period and at one point or another a different Doctor will have to take care of prescribing his meds and taking care of him and we will have to trust them."
She handed him the small metal ball that he himself assembled just days before, lit up with an orange glow once Rhodey touched it. A panel on it opened to reveal a small, grainy screen which played a set of pictures, over and over again.
"Sir believed the Avengers needed a way to shut me down in a case of emergency, or in the case of his unavailability. At the time, he believed Captain Rogers would be the most qualified and reliable member to entrust with the task." Jarvis voice was as cool and even as it ever been, but, and perhaps Rhodey imagined it, it felt full of scorn. "Unfortunately, Sir is the only person allowed to change the codes, and his security measures did not permit me to replace the codes upon learning of the Captain's misconduct. As some of the identification methods require biometric identification, such changes cannot be performed remotely."
Clint was awake now, but he pretended to sleep yet. His shame radiated through the room with his uncharacteristic silence.
For Steve it was different, Rhodes knew from debriefs about the Winter Soldier – both from the Avengers and the military, that Steve had been chasing a man who did not want to be found. He was relentless, convinced that he was the one person who could get his friend back from the clutches of Hydra by sheer force of stubbornness. It didn't matter much that the man, by all known reports, had long been out and on the run from both Hydra and the Avengers, wanting to keep to himself and be peaceful – Steve wanted him back, and he was determined to get him no matter what.
At that time, Sam did not think of Tony Stark as anything but what he saw on the news or read about on the internet. The man was a true celebrity, appearing in all sections of the news –  economics, with articles and columns discussing the stock market and the effects of SI's new direction on the market, or the appointment of his sweetheart as the CEO of the company. Global Affairs – on the exploits of Iron man, and later War machine, and about the shift of powers happening where they acted. Gossip – with images of the man in expensive designer suits and impeccable style, adoration clear between him and his partner, the same woman whom he appointed as CEO of his company whose intelligence and strong will was evident in all features of her face and the stance of her body, alongside articles describing his lascivious life style of excessive drinking and partying, citing a birthday party gone wrong here and some infidelity accusations there.
Steve buried his face in the palm of his hand, pinching the bridge of his nose in a try to soothe his budding headache and the pressure that suddenly encompassed him from all directions. He was tired of this, weary of keeping himself subdued and calm for the sake of anyone else. And most of all for Tony's sake.
"Steve... god, man, you know I hate this, right? I trust you and it's been a tough time, especially for you. We are all anxious and worried about what happened to Stark but some people are taking it too far." he said then, "So just… You didn't do it, right? It wasn't you."
Then, after lifting his arm and taking it back, Rhodes looked at Sam like he was seeing him for the first time in years, and his smile turned warm. "You were a PJ in Afghanistan, right? A real hero." He nodded, almost to himself as he kept on walking, "I heard about what happened to your partner, about what you've been doing at the VA, I saw the pamphlets you got for Tony too – he won’t read them, but… thank you, regardless. For your service and otherwise."
Pepper was the first inside the room, running over to the bedside and hugging a shell-shocked looking Tony whose haunted eyes closed tightly at the first touch by his Ex, his hand slowly moving to hover above her back, not quite touching her blouse while he waited for her to move back, when she did he sat through her chiding speech in silence, smiling softly at her as she wept about the awfulness of it all and told him how much she resented that goddamn armor that could not even keep him safe. Happy soon came to his aide when he was done setting the giant teddy bear at the foot of Tony's bed, the balloons tied to its rail and the flowers watered in a vase by the window. He gave both Rhodey and Tony a small salute before softly guiding Pepper out of the room, his hand resting on her waist as they bantered quietly with each-other. They were an interesting couple, that was for sure.
It took Tony a couple of seconds to comprehend what was happening. The little sphere chirped excitedly in his ears for several seconds before he managed to recognize it as the prototype robot Rhodey had shown him, it was a little dented at places, rough handling messing up the perfect metal-work Rhodey had been right to be so proud of – and it was there, now descending into his casted hands, warming the exposed bits of grimy skin as it purred mechanically.
"It doesn't matter if you love me or not." Steve stopped dead on his feet "It doesn't matter, not anymore. You loved doing it with me, Tony. do you remember? You were just… there. And you were looking at me and pleading. I couldn't do anything else, I couldn't save you. And we both wanted it for so long, you know that." He once again came close to the bed, and Tony's heart was drumming in his chest as he tried making himself smaller, less noticeable with his legs folding and his arms crossed across his stomach.
