Toni couldn’t help it, she nodded her head, trying to hold back the tears that formed in her brown eyes.
Toni turned around, a smart-ass remark ready to roll off her lips, only to turn around to see Bucky holding back a pissed-off, fighting Steve Rogers.
“You aren’t, I promise.” She sealed her promise with a kiss. “Now take me to your room and let's spend these last two days together as close as we can get.”
The two made their way down the hallway, laughing as they heard Clint screaming, doing his best to evade the bigger man. Running around Coulson and Nebula, pulling office chairs in his path.
Toni smiled softly, taking Steve’s face into her hands. His bright blue eyes looked down at her as a soft sigh escaped his lips.
“Nope,” popping the p, Clint rolled his eyes once more, this time with a fond smile on his lips. “It’s disgusting.”
Just as she opened the bathroom door, Steve was getting situated under the sheets, not having looked up at his dressed-up fianceé.
“I thought we were getting in bed?” Toni asked softly, wiping the tears off her face as she stared at the bigger man's chest and not his searing gaze that was staring down at her.
“Oh Elisa, don’t scare the kids. Toni, doll - I’ll see you tomorrow afternoon. We can head down the street and get those sewing machines fixed... Get you some pretty gowns and another supper or two as payment.”
Toni always thought this was her greatest fear, not the aliens in space, not dying, or losing Steve. But Toni always thought facing Howard again would be her worst nightmare.
“Awe, Barnes. I knew you were my favorite super soldier.” Toni stood up from the sofa and made her way over to the metal-armed man.
Toni completely forgot that Steve didn’t know about the reactor in her chest or even her prosthetic leg. For the last two months, Toni hid her leg under her black pantyhose and always had her arc reactor covered with a thick square of flesh-colored fabric.
The man she watched the whole world love, knowing as soon as he got behind closed doors, he beat her and her mother just for kicks and giggles. Just to make himself feel
“Yeah? Oh, yeah we’re decent now.” Steve placed a soft kiss on his genius’s lips and turned to face Bucky.
“Well, it’s a pleasure to meet ya, Toni Grant,”  Steve smiled. “Grant’s a good name. My ma’s maiden name and my middle name.”
“Like you need a hand, get the fuck over here and help us.” Toni laughed as she watched the blond's shoulders drop as he moved across the lab to help his brother-in-law.
He saw Toni raise an eyebrow in confusion at her fiancé’s antics over an old, silly sketchbook. “Clint, give him his book back,” Toni hollered, her attention back and focused on Steve’s old white shirt. Her nimble fingers running delicately over her favorite shirt.
“Baby, baby I’m here,” Toni whispered as Steve’s hands continued to run up and down her body almost as if she would disappear if he let her go.
“What’s wrong buddy?” Sam asked, trying to match the Captains' concerned tone. Steve dropped Toni’s hands with a huff and turned to the shorter man.
“The feeling is mutual, Barnes," Toni spot. "Stop acting all high and mighty like you’ve got this world figured out.”
“Thank you,” Steve whispered to both of her father figures. Thanking them not only for the way they raised Toni into the amazing woman she was today, but for trusting him enough to take their place, so to speak.
“I won’t, doll. I can't, you prove it to me every day.” Toni placed a kiss on the taller man's lips and smiled. “Can we take this slow, the whole emotions thing?”
“Right, my apologies, Miss. I did not mean to come off as insensitive. I was just in shock, you see.”
“If I'm sure?” Steve chuckled, shaking his head in disbelief at Toni's gentle care of his heart. Just another reason he loved her so much. “Toni are you? I mean you deserve a fella who can wow ya... I don’t think...” He looked down at his body and sighed. “I’m not that guy.”
“Yeah, no. I’m okay.. I’ll be back.” With that, she turned to Daniel with a smile. “Lead the way, Danny.”
“I’ll give ya and Stevie some time alone.” The brunette nodded and waved as the bigger man made his way over to a bench, giving the two lovers some time alone.
“Bucky, watch your language around a lady, what’s goin’ on--?”  Steve came to a full stop as he rounded the corner into the kitchen. “
Toni couldn’t help it as a smile grew across her lips, Reed Richards had never shown any interest in being civil with the younger Stark. But this, this was one of the sweetest things anyone had ever done for Toni.
“Yes, most definitely. I love working on Victrolas.” Toni told him eagerly. Daniel chucked at Toni as she was obviously interested to get a hold of the music player.
“I love you, future Mrs. Rogers.” He muttered against her lips, admiring the blush that flooded her cheeks.
“Copy that, Doctor,” Toni told him. Daniel flashed her a smile and made his way over to the couch to join Werner.
Seeing from the corner of her eye as Steve’s eyes grew wide watching this moment unfold between Toni and his best friend.
“No can do doll, that one stays between me and Tones,” Bucky told him as he flashed a smile and a wink at the smaller brunette.
“I’m sorry, Thor blessed them? What did you bless them with?” Bucky asked, turning his attention to the blond god.
“Good, good.” Howard said, taking a seat down beside Maria.  “Well, the future doesn’t sound too bad then.”
It was a silent walk back into the living room as the two men grabbed their jackets out of the hall closet. Neither man spoke as they began pulling on their coats.
“May thirteenth, 1999,” Maria whispered. Clint immediately pulled his phone out and shot a text to Richards.
“Steve, James!” Toni said with an uneasy smile on her face. Steve threw a questioning look to the brunette, only receiving an unsure shoulder shrug in response. Daniel stood to his feet and greeted Steve with a firm handshake and then turned to Bucky, saying:
“If Steven continues to age like you, I have a really good future ahead of me.” The smile that broke out on both of their faces was something Toni never wanted to forget.
Just as they got to talking about Steve’s new project for Timely Comics. A tall, blond man with stormy brown eyes approached the table. Toni saw Bucky’s shoulders immediately tense and Steve’s eyes grew cold.
Steve couldn’t help but think about what Coulson said as he walked with Toni through the office, watching her fix the copier with the touch of three buttons. One down - was Clint and Bucky
“Enjoying... Her-herself in another time period.” The god squeaked out, a smile on his lips even as his eyes started to bulge out of his head from the pressure of the soldier's grip.
“Okay, good. Now, sit down and eat some pizza. I’ll be back in a few and we can watch a movie or something.” Steve nodded his head, taking a seat at the table as Toni made her way to her room to change.
“Yeah, after you came back from Loki’s trick... I had all these memories of my grandpa teaching me about mechanics. All these memories of him telling me about this girl who taught him all he knew about machines.” Reed said, turning his attention away from the wires and meeting the shorter brunette's eyes. “He told me, I’d meet you one day. He knew of it. I always thought he was crazy. But then you showed up at the Baxter Building the next day after the memories appeared and I knew he wasn't crazy. I just thought, because you never got to say goodbye...” Reed shook his head and turned his attention back to the machine. “It was dumb, I ruined your wedding day instead.”
Loving the feeling of the warm air that brushed her skin. The smell of home that was Steve and Bucky’s apartment, flooded her nostrils.
Steve yelled, moving to jump in front of his genius - to try and take the spell for her. But, just before he did, the green smoke engulfed Toni, and the next thing he knew, she was
“Yeah,” Steve smiled at his teammate and turned back to Toni. “Doll, wanna teach me Italian? I learned a bit of it from the war, but I think you’d be a better teacher.”
“Awe, It’s so nice seeing the two of you together," Elisa said, joining her hands in front of her chest. "What a beautiful couple you make.”
“Can I show you something?” Steve asked softly, breaking their comfortable silence as he smiled down into Toni’s brown eyes. Flipping his genius onto her back.
Toni scratched the back of her neck and smiled softly at the younger boy. “You get those... Moods when you’re older.”
“Ignore the fucker, let's get her home,” Bucky told Steve as he moved closer to Toni’s side - sandwiching Toni's body in-between theirs.
They made it through breakfast, talking and trading stories of Toni’s time in the ’30s. Mainly sharing about Bucky and Steve and the stupid shit they would get into. Because now Toni was there to actually shed light on the real truth of pre-war Bucky Barnes and pre-serum Steve Rogers.
“I’m serious... Toni, you are so beautiful... And this ain’t even an accurate drawing of just how gorgeous ya are... I don’t have colors to really get the chocolate-honey color of your eyes... This was just my first sketch of ya.”
Toni stared down at the man, bringing her bruised wrist to cradle it against her chest. She didn’t even notice Bucky and Steve had made their way over to her. In shock at what they witnessed. She ignored it, standing wide-eyed over the unconscious man who’d just touched her.
She saw the bedroom door fly off the hinges as it slammed against the wall. The door handle dented into the drywall, as it hung there - now embedded from the force of the soldier.
When the team landed in Central Park, they didn’t see any dragons like JARVIS had reported, in fact they didn’t see anything of the sort, just an empty park.
“It would be my pleasure..” He saluted the brunette, only for her to raise her hand to her forehead to salute him right back. Steve smiled at his goofy fianceé and thanked God that he got to spend the rest of their forever together.
“Who?” Steve asked, turning his body to face Bucky, Toni’s head quickly falling from the soldier’s shoulder, landing face-first in the center of Steve’s crotch. The bigger man instantly froze, his eyes wide in shock as he tried to remember how to breathe.
“Tones, stop overthinking,” Bucky chuckled. “It really is okay; I love spending time with you and Stevie.”
“Ugh, duh. I wanna fly and shoot stuff but be protected by all that metal! You’re like the greatest Avenger.”
“I believe you have to have lived in the 1930s to understand that one, Mr. Barton,” Jarvis informed the archer with a smirk on his face.
In shock, Steve’s hold on Toni dropped. She tried to get down on her feet, but her body shifted on the bigger man's shoulders, and as she tried to swing her body around, her legs followed down Steve’s back and she hit the floor. Her ass landing on the concrete with a loud smack.
The masseuse’s made their way back into the room, and the heroes spent the next two hours relaxing on the heated sheets, as strong, handsome men worked knots out of their tense muscles.
The brunette flashed her fiancé a soft smile and she tightened her grip on his forearm. Knowing by the gaze of his blue eyes she wasn’t fooling him. Steve could read her like a book and could see the turmoil her heart and mind were trudging through.
With not an ounce of insecurity in his mind, he began to climb back into the bed - but he stopped when caught the way Toni’s pupils grew, taking in Steve’s naked glory.
"Buck!” Steve whispered to the bigger man, “Don’t say things like that.” He pulled a worn, brown leather jacket across his narrow shoulders.
“Oh, they’re just teasing you.” Toni giggled, as she felt her future husband pick her up, throwing her over his shoulder.
“Captain, follow me.” Fury told them as they entered the building. “Toni, Clint will take you to Richards.” Toni nodded at her godfather's orders. She ignored the bustle of SHIELD agents running around them and looked up into the empty gaze of her future husband.
? Do ya think someone drugged her?” Steve asked, running his eyes up and down her body, checking for any signs of assault.
“We’re nothing, Steve," Bucky interjected, “I kissed her. I kissed her three times... Two times last night and the one you saw today. I ain’t got a reason why, Stevie, but maybe I was jealous and confused... Maybe I was jealous that a gal like her was so in love with you.. I.. I’m so sorry, Stevie.”
Daniel and Von Doom stood to their feet, smiles on their lips as they made their way across the dark green rug, over to Toni.
Toni laced their fingers together, smiling as they walked, hand in hand, step for step as they began their journey home.
But, just as her hands reached out to grab the book that sat on the other side of the table, she caught herself, moving her hands back to her lap and saying: “If he wanted you to see it, he would show you.”
“A pure soul, and everlasting love,” Steve told her, placing a chaste kiss on her cheek. “You’re so unbelievably special ‘ta me, doll.”
“Something like that, yeah,” Toni said softly, flashing the younger Barnes a smile. Bucky turned his gaze to his pizza with a bright red blush on his cheeks.
He definitely could see himself being with Toni. Steve couldn’t see himself ending up with any other person in the world. He wanted Toni and he wanted all of her. From the fights to the sleepless nights. Steve wanted the sensual nights of lovemaking, he wanted nights of carrying his genius out of her lab, after a thirty-hour binge. He wanted those sleepy snuggles, he wanted all of Toni’s snuggles.
As they started their walk home, Toni opened the envelope, her eyes growing wide as she saw ten - one-dollar bills in it.
Toni asked softly. Not sure what was actually happening right at this moment. All she knew was she felt a wave of exhaustion rush over her like she had just gotten out of a battle. That Bucky was taking care of her. Bucky made her feel safe.
The couple stayed cuddled up together any chance they got. They went walking through town every night after supper with Bucky, just enjoying being beside her guys.  Early mornings over coffee as Steve and Bucky got ready for work. Staying up later than they should as they all played cards around the coffee table.
They were always gossiping, pulling pranks, making fun of Fury, or really everyone together. Toni was always there to help Steve with his computer, or phone whenever he had trouble and that happened more than one would think.
Steve had been living in Avenger’s tower for over a year and a half now, his and Toni’s friendship had recently just reached a new level Steve didn’t even know could exist.
“Toni... Doll, my heart can’t handle much more.” The smaller man placed one of his hands over his heart as his breathing began to pick up. Toni smiled at the blond as she pulled her pants and black pantyhose to the floor. Seeing the same reaction she always got back home from her Steve as his lips slightly parted, his tongue sweeping across his bottom lips as he took in the sight of her beautiful hips, and ran his searing gaze down her almost naked form.
After Steve and Toni shared their last kiss as an engaged couple, they parted ways right before the clock struck midnight. Clint and Toni snuggled up in her bed, eating ice cream cake and watching FRIENDS.
“No, Toni’s right,” Steve said softly. “She can speak for herself.” The look in his blue eyes told Toni that even he wasn’t comfortable with that statement that just left his lips.
“Still. It was disgusting, ugh. I’ll never get the image of you pressed against her like that out of my brain.” Bucky shivered in disgust as a small smile graced his lips. Toni just buried her chuckles into Steve’s neck as he held her tighter, exactly like he did when Bucky caught them in the hallway.
She looked at her family sitting at the table, frozen as they watched Toni. Concern was written all over their faces. She saw Bucky standing behind Steve, a sad smile on his lips.
Steve stood up from his sofa and made his way over to Bucky. He lifted the genius into his arms and brought her back to their shared sofa.
Toni used her free hand to strike the man in his neck. Using the area between her thumb and pointer finger, to knock the breath right out of his throat. As he dropped his grip on her wrist, his hand came up and knocked her across the cheek. Toni retaliated by landing a roundhouse kick to his chest. Using her vibranium leg to make the landing. As the pervert stood hunched over, now groaning over the pain in his chest and throat - Toni swept his legs out from under him, knocking the man unconscious as he hit the hard, cold pavement.
Toni took a deep breath, seeing the pain in those beautiful blue eyes and agreed. Knowing it was a promise she could never really keep, but for the sake of his mind, it was worth making.
A couple of moments passed before Toni felt Steve’s body finally relaxed a smidge. His face leaving her neck, his baby blues meet Toni’s brown eyes.
“How’s that, Miss. Stark?” Steve propped his feet up on her desk, turning away from the front entrance, just watching the chaos of their office unfold. Thor was still jamming buttons on the printer, Bucky chasing Clint around all their desks, Coulson was in the break room, begging the coffee maker to work, and as always Natasha and Fury were nowhere to be found on the third Wednesday of every month.
An hour passed as Steve was looking at every detail in every photo, commenting on all of them to Toni, as she patiently waited, loving every second of this time with Steve.
“What are you guys doing!?” Reed asked, ignoring the older couple. “Stark, I just needed a date, not for you to tell them what’s going on in your life right now.”
“Anything for you, my sweet dish,” Toni said with a wink. Bucky placed a chaste kiss on her lips and smiled.
Steve pulled Toni away from his chest and handed her his shirt as he had shucked hers across the room.
Toni jerked back from Steve in an instant, brown eyes wide in shock as her lip curled up in disgust.
“No!” Clint shouted, holding the laughing Toni tighter to his chest. “Not until you promise not to kill me!!”
“No, this will only bless you in laughter and joy for the rest of your days.” The trickster god spoke, his voice low as a soft smile grew on his lips. Toni stepped out of her suit, ignoring the shouts of protests of her teammates.
The man who made her feel like she wasn’t worth a single penny. That she would be nothing without him.
Walking into the room, the smell of fresh lavender wafting under their nostrils, as they heard the soothing instrumental music coming from a speaker in the ceiling. They noticed the lowlights of the room, sending a very calm vibe out as they saw two white massage tables in the center of the room, and two tall men standing with their hands locked behind their backs.
get your skinny ass in here!” He hollered once more. “Don’t worry ‘bout me. I’m doing great, babydoll.” Bucky breathed, finally making eye contact with the genius. “That’s also a nice shade ya got there on your lips.”
“Why, thank you...” Bucky responded, running his hands down the front of his uniform. “Ya, know I look even better with it off.”
Steve Rogers joined the fight, he went and rescued countless men from the clutches of Hydra and saved his best friend in the process. He became the soldier, the fighter, The Captain she always knew him to truly be.
“Let’s go,” Steve told them, “I’m getting married in a couple hours.” The trio turned, noticing the tone in Steve’s voice and by the soldier’s stance that Steve was in no mood to fuck around.
“And?” Steve asked softly, worry prevalent in his voice. Toni held up the ticket in her hand, her heartbreaking as she watched Steve’s face fall.
“Right, I’m ridiculous,” Toni muttered. “Steven Grant Rogers, you’ve spent our whole relationship - the past three years digging and clawing into my life. Helping me come to terms with my fucked up past, and all the shit I’ve been through and caused.”
“Much better.” He watched for a moment as her lust-blown pupils raked his body, before reconnecting her lips with his. Steve pushed his body tighter to hers, feeling her hot, sultry skin against his. The blond pinned his dame’s wrists to the wall behind her with a loud
“On us, you seem like a wonderful young man.” Steve looked in shock at the older man and saw him nod along with his wife.
And with that Toni felt the smaller man's arms wrap around her waist, and she laid her head on his bony, thin chest. Feeling nothing but disgust with herself for feeling peace in Steve’s embrace. Knowing that not even six hours ago she had just kissed another man, and that man was her fiancé’s best friend.
“Show off,” Toni muttered, taking the box from his hands. She sat it outside the door and turned back, pointing the light at one more box. “I can get this one.”
Elisa told Steve about sharing a bed with Bucky and he immediately agreed, saying Toni needed her rest. So, after Elisa looked over and bandaged both the boys, they said goodnight. Daniel and Elisa pulled Steve out with them, saying something about letting the love birds say goodnight, the blond just faked a smile and begrudgingly followed the older couple out the door to finish off his soup.
“Okay?! Steven!” Toni shouted, looking up at the shorter man. “These should be in the MoMA..” she muttered, turning her attention back to the last couple of pages on the sketchbook.
Toni couldn’t do it; she couldn’t not tell them that Steve was okay. They didn’t need to live the rest of their lives thinking he was dead. No parent deserved that.
“What is it? It’s..” Steve watched as Toni’s face dropped and she turned her gaze to the floor. Steve took in the beautiful blue light that sat in between her breasts and smiled. “
“Yes, Steve, come sit beside these love birds.” Steve threw a soft, confused glance in Bucky’s direction and took a seat on the bed, beside the two.
“No,” Steve grumbled through a mouth full of his white rice. Pulling his and Toni’s container closer to his plate. “Get your own food. I bought this for Toni.”
It was at that moment Toni saw the Winter Soldier make his first appearance. Bucky listened as the words left the taller man's mouth. Only to respond with a right hook, nailing him right across the jaw. Toni watched as the four men started to brawl on the sidewalk. Not moving from her spot because Bucky told her to stay there, and Toni trusted him with her life. But, also because she was still in shock of all the events that had unfolded in the last five minutes.
“Sleep Stevie,” Toni muttered, laying her head against his chest, ignoring the hundreds of metals that kept her from touching his firm pecs.
“Welcome home darlin’, how was your day?” She heard Bucky chuckle as he sat in his brown leather chair, reading the newspaper. Not even glancing up as the genius made her way into the house.
Toni opened the door, revealing a panicked, long-haired Sarah Rogers pacing around the lab, as silver fox Joseph Rogers sat in a desk chair as he dug through some stuff on the table before him.
Toni pulled away from her fiancé’s embrace and shook her head, bringing herself back to the task at hand.
“He spit it at me when I told him to shut up. Then I tried to pull it out and well...” Bucky held up his now ruined hair.
“You know I don’t want Bucky right?” She whispered, feeling the bigger man sigh against the sensitive skin on her neck.
Steve and Bucky’s expressions change from concern to heartbreak. Their eyebrows furrowed, as sad frowns appeared on their lips. A sadness that only the other two men could understand, showing in their blue eyes.
Toni sat there for a minute. Wanting to rub her hands up and down his back, but they were still pinned above her head, locked in the bigger man's grip.
So, she took a shower, changing into a clean pair of clothes, and reapplied some ointment Elisa had left her for the gash on her cheek. The only thing running through her mind the whole time was trying to figure out how to tell Steve that she had kissed Bucky.
“Don’t you ever speak about her like that! Ya, hear me!" The smaller blonds form puffed up as he was protecting Toni with every part of him. "Ya may be a big man, but there ain’t nothing special about ya! Especially when you speak of a lady like that!"
“I don’t want you there either.”  Toni muttered looking up into those baby blue eyes she called home.
“I did because it’s true,” Clint informed them. “Bucky’s not a snack. He’s a whole meal.” The archer had made his way down off the refrigerator and was now stealing a kiss from his boyfriend's lips.
“Handed the mantle of SI over. Toni is head of R&D and Howard; she's put out more inventions in her first year as head of R&D than you did in your whole life. Toni Stark is a goddamn genius; this world is lucky to have her in it.”
“Toni! Hey.” Steve’s head jerked up from his book and gave Toni a soft smile while quickly closing his book, pushing it away from his body. Toni’s eyes followed the green-colored sketchbook as she smiled.
“What is it that we’re doing?” Steve questioned as he walked into the kitchen. He made his way over to the fridge, grabbing a water bottle and then straight to sit by Toni’s side. “Hello doll baby,” he placed a kiss on Toni's lips and sat down in his chair, his arm resting over the back of Toni’s seat.
“He comes from good stock, that boy. Anywho, I was stopping by to--.” Daniel scanned the living room and then turned his attention back to Toni. “Well, it sure is warm in here. I didn’t know the boys got that radiator worked on. They’d been tellin’ me how they’d been saving to get it fixed up.”
“Take me to the bedroom?” A breathless whisper fell off her lips as Steve stalked his way over to her, pushing her body against the wall.
Steve’s hardened gaze ran up and down her form as if he was reminding himself who he was speaking to and softly shook his head. Bringing his large hands up to his face, Steve rubbed his eyes with his fingers as whispers of ‘sorry’ fell from his lips. Anger still evident on his face and in his tone, but not like before.
. I don’t know why you keep doing this. I love Stev-” it was that instant Toni made eye contact with the smaller blond. Her eyes immediately lost the fierceness she had just a second ago when she had looked at Bucky. Instead, a wave of sadness rushed over them as she locked eyes with the smaller blond.
An hour or so later, Toni made her way into the kitchen to grab a bite to eat when she saw Bucky sitting in his brown leather chair, reading the newspaper.
Steve ignored the subtle laughter falling from Bucky and Sam’s lips and turned his attention to Clint.
“I swear to God, I’m gonna kill him.”  Steve raged as he searched for the man through the crowd. His blue eyes raging with anger at the man who made Toni feel so small. Who dared to make his dame feel scared and inferior. Whoever this man was, Steve was gonna tear him to pieces for even daring to mess with
Toni swore Steve was a man from the ’40s with the way he worked electronics and dressed. But if Steve was being honest, he knew how to work a computer, better than anyone in the office - besides Toni.
“I’m okay, Stevie,” she whispered, staring into his empty blue eyes. Laying her forehead against his, she whispered, softly: “I’m okay, sweetheart.”
“Who even says that?!” Steve shouted into the room, running his hands through his hair at the fucking audacity of this man.
The next couple of days that passed were bitter-sweet. The couple spent every waking moment together. They made all their meals together, stayed up late almost every night playing cards or making out on the couch just to gross Bucky out. Steve would take Toni out most evenings for a walk or maybe to see a film.
“Well, I for one think these two are a perfect pairing,--” Bucky stated. Toni turned to face the taller brunet, dropping Steve’s hand in the process.
“I’ll change into that for our dance…” Toni popped the face mask open and kissed her soldier. “I wanna marry you, how I met you.”
The soldier carried Toni over his shoulder, out of the interrogation room. A smile unbelievably wide on his lips as they made their way down the hallway.
“Oh.. Okay, okay..” She whispered, nodding her head. “We can do this if you’re sure. If you’re comfortable.”
“Three hot dogs please, just ketchup on one, mustard and onions on the other two.” and with that, she handed over the fifty cents, the man's face growing in shock.
“You came home in this dress... I can’t forget that day, even if I tried... I thought I was gonna bust a nut right there in the kitchen..” Toni laughed at her soldier's word choice and smiled. “I thought you didn’t hear what he said?”
“No, come on. I hate inside jokes,” Clint begged the taller man, grabbing onto the bottom of his shirt. “Bucky tell me!”
The blond didn’t even notice Bucky and Clint’s fierce make-out session right in the middle of the office as his blue gaze was settled on the way of the genius’ hips and her sparkling brown eyes.
Toni and Natasha laid in the spa chairs, cucumbers on their eyes, and black charcoal masks covering their faces as they received manicures and pedicures. Getting the pampering both women hadn’t had in a very long time.
The two men turned to each other in shock and made their way into their toasty home. Seeing Toni sitting on the sofa, as their neighbors Daniel and Elisa sat opposite to her, chatting away.
“It’s alright,” Toni whispered, as she laid her head into the captain’s lap as her now bare feet rested in Bucky’s. “I was tired anyway.”
“Toni? You okay?” Steve asked once more, concern shining in his tone as he placed a soft kiss right beneath her ear.
“The look on his face was something I'll never forget.” Toni smiled, laying her hands on the smaller man’s chest.
“Shut up, Wilson,” Toni muttered, as she lifted her face from the bigger man's crotch. Sitting back up in her seat, promptly laying her head down on Bucky’s shoulder; not even recognizing The Captain’s still rigid body language. “You’d probably pay to watch that.”
“Listen to me for one goddamn minute. You’re the most stubborn human being on the planet. Hell, you give Stevie a run for his money!”
“Yeah, come on in,” Toni responded, sitting up in Steve’s bed as she straightened out the covers around her body. The bigger man walked through the door, holding what Toni assumed was a cup of tea.
“I dunno, Buck! You interrupted before anything happened... I think she likes me and over the past months, we’ve grown pretty close... But, I dunno... I find it hard ‘ta believe... She’s beautiful and I’m--."
“You as well, Sue.” Clint shared a soft smile with his fellow blonde and turned to Reed. “You knew you had a wedding to be at in less than four hours, and you still fucked around with interdimensional shit.”
The last time he’d seen the chest was when he threw all his sketchbooks in there, about three months after Toni left. He just couldn’t bring himself to draw much a couple of months after Toni left - his main muse was gone. So, his sketchbooks disappeared into the chest.
“I am, actually,” Sam informed Toni, a cocky smile on his lips as he turned his attention back to the girl. “What’s your question?”
“Oh, come on, you two get her all the time. Tossing her around like a real whore, I’m sure. Give a real man a chance to fuck her.” It was with those words Steve lost it. Pushing Toni into Bucky’s arms, he marched himself over to the bigger man.
“Nope, she’s ours too. You’re gonna have to learn how to share.” Bucky chuckled as he made his way over to his boyfriend.
It was only eight-thirty, and the coffee machine had broken. Kinda sorta blew up as soon as Clint plugged it into the wall. So, everyone was frustrated about that.
She pulled herself out of the older man's embrace and quickly stood to her feet, a bout of worry stirring in her gut as she heard the panicked tone of Steve’s voice.
Steve... You’re so kind, you’re stubborn and so arrogant. Yet humble and righteous all at the same time.” Toni ran her hands under his shirt and placed a kiss on his lips. Steve settled his shaky hands on her thighs, feeling the almost velvet-like, warm skin beneath his palms.
Steve just shrugged his shoulders, smiling at the beautiful brunette in the dim emergency lights and the subtle flicker of her lit candle at her desk.
Steve dreamed of one day dropping to one knee and asking her to be his forever, and down the line eventually starting a family with the girl of his dreams.
“I love you... And I promise you, it doesn’t seem like it now... And it won’t for a while, but I’m gonna see you again, Steve Rogers.” Toni wrapped her arms around the smaller man's neck. “You’re gonna marry me, Mr. Rogers..” She leaned in close, nipping gently at his ear. “You’re gonna put a baby in me and we’re gonna live happily ever after...
There was Nebula and Thor, they were from Norway or somewhere over there. Thor loved to talk, and when he did it was like the man's voice was always amplified. Whereas Nebula was very quiet and got her work done.
After dinner, Toni headed to Steve’s bedroom to get changed into her normal everyday pair of pleated brown pants and one of Steve’s white button-up shirts. That has to be one of the things Toni missed about the future; clothes with color. All they wore were dark browns, muted tans, whites, and sometimes black. Toni did love black clothing, but to be honest the browns weren’t hitting on much.
“He did.” Daniel nodded. “This dame right here is one of the smartest people I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. And I do believe if I gave her a couple of textbooks in my line of work, I’d be out of a job. Mr. Von Doom, she’s a genius, and I expect you to treat her as such.” Daniel’s chest puffed out, and he stuck his finger in the air, making his final point. “Woman or not. She is incredible and you will treat her with respect. Do you understand?”
“That’ll be fine,” Bucky said softly, his gaze frozen on the ground beneath his feet as the door opened revealing a slightly less bloodied Steve.
“You’re welcome to stay here, as long as ya need,” the short blond told her softly. His smooth, deep voice calming her nerves.
“WE WON!!” Steve yelled as Sam and Clint lifted the smaller boy in the air, after guessing the winning point. Toni sent a wink to Bucky and mouthed
“Why only you and Steve?” Clint asked, shooting Steve a toothy grin as he blatantly ignored The Captain’s request.
“Yes ma’am!” Clint saluted the younger woman and made his way back to his desk. Poking around with the files on his desk, pretending to sort them.
What is in here you don’t want me seeing?” Clint laughed as he ran away from the soldier. Dodging and jumping out of the older man's grasp.
“And what is it Antonia has you believing about her? That she grew up under the horrible Howard Stark? That I was such an awful man? Maybe, that she’s a genius and has it all put together. ‘Saves the world’ all by herself, that bullshit?”
delicate features, the way her eyelashes rested softly against her cheeks. The way her hands were gripping the lapels of his jacket, holding on to her husband. The way her blood red lips were softly parted as she regained her breath.
Steve smiled up at his fianceé as she sat on his chest and then took her left hand into his, sliding the ring on her finger.
“I love you more, Mr. Rogers.” Toni whispered, a smile growing on her lips as she glanced up at the bigger man, she now called her
“We don’t mind,” Steve said softly. His fingers messing with the label of his beer bottle, obviously he did mind.
“Somethings never change,” Natasha chuckled, as they stood to their feet to follow their teenage teammates.
“I love you,” Toni whispered, laying her head down onto the bigger man's shoulder. Those beautiful chocolate eyes smiling up at him, like he had personally hung the moon and stars just for her.
“No,” Toni whispered, uncrossing her arms from her chest. She took a step closer to her father, standing eye to eye with the man who abused her - her whole life.
he gasped, wrapping his arms around her waist. Wanting nothing more than to hold her and make sure she was safe.
“I don’t know what you said, but I forgive you,” Toni whispered, placing a kiss on the taller man's cheek.
But, little did the blond man know that Toni was planning a date night for when she got back home. That involved a thirty’s style dress and an apron.
Steve and Toni were born for a fight, and she believed that with her whole heart. They met in 2012, fought aliens, and fell in love in 2014 for a reason, and she knew they had to get back to that.
Bucky mouthed, ‘smooth’ as Toni smiled, remembering her Steve had said exactly that, not five minutes before she was thrown back into the past.
One of the guards came close to Toni, only to back up when Steve shot a murderous glare in his direction. The soldier protectively threw his arm around Toni’s waist and pulled the genius closer to his body. Ignoring the snort from Sam and Clint as he heard Bucky whisper:
“Oh, Steve.. sweetheart,” Toni whispered, not realizing that Steve was actually upset over Toni, Clint, and Bucky’s jokes. “I didn’t realize it really bothered you, we were just joking around.”
Toni had her hands tight around Steve’s bicep, leaning against the bigger man as he pulled her into the elevator and penthouse.
“One of the most legendary duos in the history of... Well, the world.” Natasha confirmed for the smaller man.
As soon as she was within arms reach of her fiancé, those muscular arms snatched off her feet and threw her onto their bed. Her body was almost instantly covered by a very naked, very aroused Steve Rogers.
“Pizza?” Clint and Sam suggested at the same time, only to turn to the other boy for another high five.
Glancing down at the empty left hand, a small sigh left her lips. Her hand felt naked without the ring. She didn’t like that at all.
She turned around and opened the lab door, and as she grabbed the handle that was when she remembered the ring. If she couldn’t tell Sarah and Joseph about Steve, she could show them.
“Come on up to the penthouse and see for yourself. There is absolutely no fucking way to explain this.”
“We’re okay. Aren’t we, Stevie?” Toni whispered, and nodded her head saying: “Yeah, yeah we are.” Bucky took a seat beside Natasha, holding a slice of pepperoni pizza in his hand.
“Edwin Jarvis?” Steve sniffled as he looked at the envelope in his shaking hands. A questioning look in his blue gaze.
“Well, while Lady Stark has wonderful chemistry with the whole team, her chemistry with our fearless leader is the strongest. They are a destined pair.”
Steve learned to take this all one day at a time, Toni had really good days, sometimes weeks without problems. But, then a sore day would roll around and the cycle would start anew. Sam said he would talk to Toni, but he thought Toni and Bucky spending some more one-on-one time together would probably help.
“I will, I promise.” The short blond nodded, as he swallowed around a knot in his throat. The rims of his eyes doing their damndest to hold back his tears.
The brunette tried fighting the smile that was threatening to spill off her lips, but the smile won and stole his heart again in the process.
“What makes my heart do cartwheels?” Steve whispered, a soft laugh leaving his lips. “You, you make my heart do cartwheels. When you’re in the lab for way too fucking long. When you’re sleep-deprived and covered in oil and you flash me that sweet innocent smile, I lose my fucking mind, Toni.” Toni couldn’t help the sob that left her lips as she smiled at her fiancé who was finally sharing some of his heart with her for the first time.
“Gosh, at least wait until you’re alone,” Sam chuckled, a smile gracing his lips as he watched Steve freeze up at Toni’s new resting place.
Steve just outwardly groaned, knowing in his heart Toni would hate those shirts so much she would make him wear it, and well that thought made him smile. But then again, everything about Toni made him smile.
Toni watched as Sarah and Joe smiled at the picture, tears in their eyes before she turned around, burying her face into her husband's chest. Toni listened as she sobbed, clinging to the older man's shirt as she found out her son wasn’t dead. He hadn’t died. But also, that he was happy. So happy.
The next morning Toni and Steve were in the kitchen making breakfast for the team - everyone was overjoyed that the whole team was back together again after a month apart.
“Yes, The Captain is possessive over Toni in a very sweet and charming way.” Pepper blushed at Natasha’s short but passionate peck. “It’s very sweet.”
“Don’t apologize...” He muttered not looking up into the brunette’s eyes. “I know what it’s like..” Toni sighed as Steve quickly grabbed the broken pieces off the floor, and hollered out to the team asking if they wanted eggs.
“Gosh, I hope not Stevie... Could’a been mugged and the fella knocked her out. Then just left her here..”
With that job finished, Toni went to the bathroom, taking the coldest and quickest shower of her life. She then wandered into Steve’s bedroom, pulling on one of his white button-up shirts and a pair of his lounge pants. She washed her clothes in the sink and hung them up to dry in the living room. Hoping the radiator would speed that process along.
“Monet who?” Toni asked Steve, as she stepped closer to the painting that graced her walls. Her brown eyes soaking in every small detail of her fiancée’s work. Smiling as he got every detail of her 30’s outfit down to the black pantyhose and her red lips.
Toni quickly noticed Steve’s avoidance of talking about his feelings. Which was so different from his pre-war, pre-serum self, and Toni knew she had to figure out how to bring that back. She had to figure out how to do for him what he did for her. Toni had to show Steve that she was ready to pick up his broken pieces, just like he did hers.
“That’s true...” Sue whispered, smiling back at her husband. “Oh, Clint! Good to see you outside of saving the world!”
“Buck, what did I say about your language?” Steve muttered, running his hand through his hair as a way to express his frustration with being interrupted.
JARVIS spoke, through her Stark Phone that laid on one of the workshop tables. Toni turned to Reed and Sue in shock, her eyes flashing from the machine to the door.
“Toni, meet seventeen-year-old Barnes, Wilson, Barton, and Rogers,” Fury said, patting her on her shoulder. “You’re in charge of Rogers and Barnes, Natasha has Wilson and Barton. Good fucking luck!” and with that Fury took her empty spot in the elevator.
Steve rolled off Toni, as the laughter left his lips louder than before. “You said your last name was
“You’re not from here, Toni, I don’t know how I know it, but I do.” He placed his bony hand on Toni’s shoulder and smiled. A look of comfort and love in his eyes. “You’re different. Bold, outspoken, brave, intelligent beyond my own beliefs.”
“You two lovebirds are so precious.” She whispered, applying some ointment to the newly cleaned gash on Toni’s cheek.
The elevator doors opened, revealing the men of the team in the middle of a nerf battle. Couches and side tables were flipped over, and cushions being used as shields.
Steve jumped to his feet and sailed across the room, leaping over the coffee table and couch trying to snatch the notebook from the archer's hands.
Toni couldn’t help but laugh at the confidence Joseph carried. Steve didn’t get any of that from his father, he inherited more of his mother’s gentleness.
“Okay, but as much fun as this is... Bucky, did you say people ship Toni and me as a couple?” Sam asked, bringing the conversation back to the soldier's earlier comment.
“That’s why it’s here. I want them to see just how much I love you.” The soldier smiled, wrapping his arms around her waist.
“You should be, he can kick your ass. Flames or not.” Sue said, as she pulled her younger brother in for a hug.
Toni looked down the aisle as she locked arms with Fury and Edwin Jarvis, smiling at her found family. Each dressed in their superhero costumes, from Natasha’s black leather outfit, Clint’s purple combat suit, Sam’s red and grey wings, and Thor’s Norse armor.
“You’re perfect,” Toni whispered as Steve began placing kisses down her neck. Leaving a trail of bruises down her bare chest, marking her as his wherever his lips touched.
“Depends on the day,” Bucky muttered, hand in Toni’s as she led the man out of the break room and to her desk.
He heard Toni’s soft voice, as her hands ran up and down his chest. She pulled his face down, to lean her forehead against his. The feeling of her cold skin bringing him back to earth.
“Daniel?” Toni whispered, turning to face the scientist. Forgetting all about her parents across the building with Steve.
“Well... Um. Thank you for saving me, I guess..” Toni ran her hands through her short, spiky hair and racked her brain for a reason she was in the alley, then she lied through her teeth. “I’m not from around here... I came in from Ca-California... I only remember a tall man... Wanting money... And now I’m here.”
shorter than Steve). She has beautiful, short brown hair and chocolate eyes that could whisk you off to neverland. But she also happened to be the funniest, kindest, smartest person Steve had ever met and in their three years of working together, they quickly became best friends.
Toni nodded her head and snuggled up beside Steve, wrapping him into her arms, just like he did for her when she was upset.
He had been sitting at his desk, drinking some instant shit Clint had found in the back of a cabinet when the phone at the front desk rang, and rang, and rang.
“GIRL ALERT!” Clint yelled, running across the living room, diving over the couch, tumbling down onto the floor.
“Come on, Stevie," Bucky said, jumping to his feet once he realized his best friend had begun to stir.
She smiled, pulling away from her fiancé one more time. “One more thing." And began unbuttoning her pants.
“That’s why you're my only girl.” Bucky threw Steve a wink, a chuckle escaping his lips as Steve tightened his grip on Toni’s waist and shook his head.
Toni couldn’t help the chuckle that bubbled in her chest, listening to Bucky talk about Steve being like his father. When Steve proposed that night after they had celebrated - just the two of them. Steve had told Toni about a quote his father always told him growing up:
“Fine," Toni grumbled and made her way down the hallway, slamming the bedroom door behind her for good measure. Steve smirked as he listened to the door slam, rattling the few pictures on the wall. The sass in that woman was unbelievable and he loved every ounce of it.
“Who is it?” Toni called out, trying to think of an explanation for her being alone in Steve and Bucky’s apartment.
“They picked me up off the side of the street, and took me in,” Toni informed him, a bright smile on her face. Daniel threw his head back laughing, at what he thought was a joke.
“Stevie, how did you get rice on your glasses?” Toni whispered through her smile, her delicate fingers picking a tiny grain of white rice off his black frames. “There, all better.
“Could I climb in bed with ya?.. Bucky kicks like a mule in his sleep.” Toni sleepy nodded her head against the deep blue pillowcase. “Toni, it’s dark. I can’t see ya, doll.”
Just as Steve was about to comment on the strange life they lead. Strange opened his eyes, taking Steve’s attention over to the wizard.
“Oh dear, look at you,” Elisa whispered, walking across the room, setting her medical bag down on the floor in front of Toni.
“Of course, he’s a very lucky man, I’m sure,” Werner said and pulled a white envelope out of his jacket.
Toni shook her head and smiled the most beautiful smile Steve had ever seen. “I get to decide who ‘wows’ me, Steve Rogers... And the answer to that, my dear, is always gonna be you.”
“What company? Where did you send her?” Steve shouted, feeling Bucky and Sam pulling on his shoulders to keep him from lunging after the god again. “
Bucky and Clint had cold looks in their gaze as they talked to Fury. By the way they were standing, it looked like Fury had been preparing them for a battle.
“Cuddling you.” Toni placed a kiss into his blond locks as she snuggled her body closer to the bigger man, smiling as she took the position of being the big spoon.
“Sweetheart, you are family.” Sarah whispered, making her way over to her. She took Toni’s hands into her own.
Toni let out a sigh of relief and looked around the small living room, taking in its used but homey feeling. Toni smiled at the homemade quilts that rested on the sofa and the couple of pictures that graced the off-white walls. She felt comfortable, and that said a lot given that Loki had just thrown her seventy years back into the past. A brush of cold air settled into the room, sending another shiver down her spine, pulling Toni from her thoughts. Damn, New York winters.
“I don’t like him.” Toni turned back to Steve; a beautiful smile wide on her lips. “I don’t like him at all.”
You knew Steve was lying when he didn’t make eye contact with you as he spoke. But, no one else on the team but Bucky and Toni knew that. All their teammates' mindsets, still thinking about how Steve is too righteous and pure to lie. It made Bucky and Toni chuckle every time.
“I was gonna give you guys some family time,” Toni whispered, watching as Steve’s smile fell off his lips.
“Why yes, the fates have souls that are destined to be together. That be partners romantically or platonically. You and the Captain are destined mates, did you not know this?”
She had caught up on the tape of Howard and Steve as she made her way to the room, and Howard never once asked about Toni. That was Sarah’s second question after she figured out where she was.
“Ooh, did you enjoy the show?” Toni asked with a grin, placing her hands on her hips as Strange bit back his chuckle and rolled his eyes. “But, exactly how long have you been in my mind? How many shows did you actually experience?”
And with that Toni made her way out of the bedroom and onto the balcony just in time to see the quinjet taking off.
“Oh...” Toni whispered, realizing the couple didn’t spend as much time apart as she thought they did.
Who snuggled the most? And that everyone answered, the genius’ name falling off all their lips at the same time. Toni just shrugged her shoulders as she continued to stay cuddled up into Steve’s side.
As she went to respond, Toni turned the next page and was greeted with a drawing of herself. Steve had drawn Toni, sitting in front of their radiator, fixing it. He wasn’t there when she fixed it, so she had no idea how he knew what her ‘working’ face looked like. But, every single detail was right, down to her dressed in Steve’s clothes, and the tools spread out all over the floor.
“I love you,” Steve told her. “But, also could we maybe watch FRIENDS? The episodes with Tom Selleck are my favorite.”
“Of course, of course. One of the nicest men I’ve ever known, and his grandson is a prick.” Steve chuckled, pulling his fiancé back to his chest - knowing he wasn’t ready to let her go just yet.
He began going through the smaller contents of the chest, smiling at some of the pictures of his family - the scratched and gently faded pictures of him and Toni. The worn ticket stubs from some of his and Toni’s movie dates and the tickets from their trip to the MoMA. Which of course brought a sappy smile to the bigger man's face as he remembered their adventures very fondly.
“I hate you. I hate you.” Bucky wrapped his arm around the smaller man's shoulders and smiled, saying:
We meet pre-serum Steve and Bucky!! An get a glimpse into what Toni's life is gonna look like until her team back home can find a way to save her.
“How? How…” Bucky asked, sitting down in the chair, smiling as he ran his fingers over the worn leather on the armrests. “How is this even around?” He turned to Toni with a smile on his lips.
His forehead still resting against the smaller women’s, Steve’s blue eyes looked suspiciously around to room, and he asked: “Am I good at...
“Are you kidding? You’re so talented, I’d love to!” Toni’s heart felt like it grew three sizes when she saw the grin that broke out on Steve’s face.
“Steven!” Toni slapped his bare chest, her voice full of concern as she took in his tear tracked cheeks.
Steve stumbled into the spot where Toni had just stood, not seconds before. A boiling fury like no other rushed through his veins as he grabbed the trickster god by the collar of his green shirt, and threw him against the fridge.
“Of course, this is nothing compared to what you’ve done for me,” Toni told him, smiling as his heated blue gaze rested on her lips.
She sat back down onto the sofa, bringing her hands up to cover her face doing her best not to panic about this whole fucked up situation.
“Thank you, for loving my son.” Sarah smiled and placed a kiss on Toni's forehead. “He’s a very stubborn man.”
“Toni..” His hand cupped the side of her face and before she could even blink, his lips were on hers.
“What’s going on? I’m not supposed to see you!” Toni looked to Steve, then back to her godfather. “Is someone hurt? Is there a mission?”
You’re one sweet dish.” Bucky brought his hand to his chin as his eyes danced up and down Toni’s body.
“It's rough, I’ll get better. It’s not easy having such a challenging piece... Knowin’, it’s near impossible to get just how perfect ya are down on paper.”
hand, dance down the front of her dress. Running delicately over the lace, teasing Steve with every single movement.
“Yes, sir, I did. About an hour ago.” Toni warily eyed the older man as he took in her appearance again. Then a smile graced the older man’s lips and Toni breathed a sigh of relief.
“No, Howard.” Not a doubt of uncertainty in her voice as she finally stood up to her piece of shit father. “I did that all by myself.”
“I love you,” He whispered, as Toni brought her hands up from his chest to wipe the tears off his cheeks.
Yeah, they both had been through so much in their lifetimes. But, she never had a moment with him, where he broke down and shared things he had bottled up. He’d always broken those walls down for Toni, and Toni never even realized he had walls. Not until she got to know pre-serum Steve.
“Ladies, please undress to your comfort level and we will be back in five minutes.” The taller man said as Toni picked up a slight Hawaiian accent slipping from his lips.
“If we don’t get a call that some random ass dragon is trying to take over the Golden Gate Bridge, I’m gonna throw myself off the tower,” Clint stated, dramatically flopping down in a chair at the kitchen table.
Daniel knocked on the large white door, smiling down at Toni as they waited for the owner of the large house to welcome them in.
“Okay,” Toni whispered and buried her face into his pectoral muscles like she always did. His hands ran up and down her body, being gentle as he brushed the sensitive skin at the end of her right thigh.
“I’m very glad you think so, doll..” His voice dropped an octave as his gaze lingered on her lips. Toni drew a quick breath, noticing Steve's gaze flicker down to her chest and back up to her lips.
“Every time, Tones. I don’t know why you’re still surprised when he picks you up,” Bucky said with a laugh falling off his lips.
When Friday afternoon rolled around, they arrived at the train station about thirty minutes before she was set to board.
He heard the smooth voice of his best friend over the line. Steve hid his blush, tucking the phone between his shoulder and chin as his hands began to dig through Toni’s drawers, looking for the pink Starbursts she always hid from him.
Toni rolled her eyes as the words left the doctor's lips. “What’s the plan here, Wizard? How am I getting home?”
“Well, I don’t mean to interrupt ya and whatever this is..” Bucky gestured between the two of them who were now holding hands and smiling at the other like idiots. “But, I’ve gotta head down to the steel mill, and Stevie, you have that tutoring lesson for that little punk down the street,” Bucky informed them, breaking the two from their trance.
“Call me Toni.” She said smiling and pulled her phone out of her pocket to type the pizza order to JARVIS.
“Captain Rogers, you may kiss your bride.” Steve wrapped his arms around his bride, sealing their lips for the first time as husband and wife as he dipped her at the altar. Their friends and family erupted in shouts of joy as the two were finally married.
“He’s got a crush on Toni. Thinks she’s engaged to you,” Sam pointed out, using his half-eaten slice of pizza to point at the god.
“Umm, so that's nine?” The host spoke, pulling the two heroes from their gaze. Steve ignored the blatant grins on his teammates' faces.
“I do.” Steve mirrored his actions, sitting up in his chair. He wasn’t gonna let Howard threaten him, not when Steve could kill the older man with his pinky finger.
Before the genius could finish her word, Steve had used his much bigger mass and flipped the genius back onto her back. Her tan skin lay against the blood-red sheets, as Steve sealed their lips together in a kiss.
The boys all exchanged glances of shocked, confused, and surprised emotions before Bucky spoke up: “Am I a sniper?”
Toni placed a kiss to her future husband's lips, his strong arms snaking around her waist as she whispered: “You’re the only man I wanna marry, Mr. Rogers.”
Steve dropped Toni to her feet, placed a quick kiss of apology on her lips, and chased the short blond right out the hallway. Threats of murder and other unpleasant things leaving his lips.
“I never expected him to go for a brunette, especially one with short hair. But gosh dang it, he got the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen.”
“Water boy?” Clint chuckled. Both men receive a sharp smack to the back of the head from Natasha. Steve took his bottom lip in between his teeth and looked back down at his interlocked hands in his lap.
“You’re alright, although I could have gone my whole life without havin’ to see ya mauling Toni like that.”
“What happened?” His blue eyes dancing back up her body to meet her chocolate-brown gaze. “Who did this to you, Toni?” Steve demanded, his voice dropping into a low, concerned tone as he pulled the brunette's waist to his.
“I’d like that, Reed. You and I could get into some real trouble.” Toni smirked as she watched Sue roll her eyes. “We could give our blonds a run for their money.”
“I know, I love it.” And with that, the two superheroes continued to enjoy the hot towels on their legs, the massages on their feet, and the masks on their face. Revealing in their last few hours of being pampered.
“I love you,” Steve’s lips moaned against her skin. Running his hands around her back to unhook the black bra that hid more of Toni from his sight. Steve pulled away, chucking her bra across the room, and smiled down at his dame’s naked chest.
“Yes, yes ma’am! Have a good time, I’ll be here when ya come out,” he told Toni as Steve helped her out of the cab.
“I..” Toni whispered and reached into her pocket, pulling out a small letter and a business card with an address on it. “Write to me. I might not be able to respond, but, I promise, I’ll read them.”
As the front door closed, Bucky clicked the lock across it; and they both turned to the short-haired brunette. Looking for an explanation for everything that had just unfolded.
waist in his hands. Wanting nothing more than to mark her neck with his bruises and have her perfect, sweaty skin beneath him.
And with that, he walked over to where Bruce was standing and followed the older man's instructions. Clint and Sam said their goodbyes and were now laying out on the sofa asleep when it came down to Bucky's turn.
“It’s me, baby.” Toni nodded her head, realizing Steve had just woken up from reliving his past all over again, and he felt as if he hadn’t seen Toni in over seventy-some years. She ran across the room, jumping into her lover's arms. His arms wrapped around her waist as if they were designed just for her, holding her body so tight as a way of saying he would never let her go again. Toni squeezed her thighs tight around the bigger man's hips, as she threw her arms around his neck. Holding him as tight as she possibly could, reminding him she was here and safe. They were here, together, just like they promised.
“Huh?” They asked softly, looking around the room. Toni heard the locks click shut and heard a muffled yell on the other side of the door.
“Now son,” Joseph said with a chuckle as he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the lipstick off his son's face. “I know you’re not ruining your wedding by messing up your doll's makeup, now, are you?”
The slight whine in his voice had Toni smiling like a teenager. God, Steve Rogers was so precious. “What are you doing?”
Toni had about fifteen dollars saved up from jobs she’s done. Steve and Bucky thought she’d spent it on herself as they asked her to. But, since when did Toni ever listen?
Sam left out a huff of disappointment, laying his forehead back down onto the kitchen table as Clint buried his face in Bucky’s shoulder.
“Wait, wait. Thor, you would sleep with me?” Toni asked, a bright smile on her lips as she brought her legs up on the sofa and pulled them close to her chest. She locked her hands around her knees and smiled at the god.
I must be the luckiest guy in the, in the whole ‘ide world!” Steve leaned down, resting his forehead against the smaller genius’. “I keep ya happy right?”
She always had fun flirting with the blond, because she knew it got Steve riled up and riled up Steve was always good fun in the bedroom. It was also hilarious for Steve and Johnny to be in the same room together. Johnny was the spitting image of Steve. Just way more douchebaggy.
“Well, he’s a prick,” Edwin stated, causing the whole room to bust out in laughter at the older man's choice of words.
But Toni knew with Steve by her side, the world could end, people could die, and she’d be alright - as long as those blue eyes always met her gaze.
“No, no. Nathaniel couldn’t snag a doll like this, even if he tried. Plus he’s only fourteen, Werner. He’s not looking to settle down anytime soon.”
” Steve spoke, not missing the way Toni’s brown eyes grew in shock at the foreign tongue falling off Steve’s lips.
Bucky sat Toni onto Steve’s bed, helping her out of her dress and into what appeared to be one of his shirts. Toni was too out of it to even notice when the man had left her side to grab it.
“It was a gift from my parents when I moved out. Ma was so proud, she went out and bought it. Spent so much money on it.” Bucky recalled.
“Injury on one of the mills, they sent everyone home. But, we still get paid, so it’s alright," Bucky told him as they hit the second landing and followed the hallway down to apartment 2D.
too, by both of these gorgeous specimens is truly a wonderful thought... I don’t think I’d ever walk properly again.”
“Nope, Nat’s rules. No penises allowed.” Toni told him. “That means you and yours, Mr. Rogers.” Steve huffed, his bottom lip poking out into a pout, as his arms wrapped tighter around her waist.
“She comes first,” Bucky whispered. Steve nodded his head, knowing Bucky was right - Toni always came first even if he did wanna go beat the shit out of the man who did this to Toni. But, Steve just settled for shooting one last glance at the dance floor before he made his way over to Toni.
Steve nodded his head as he fixed the collar of his jacket, saying: “I’ll be back ‘round four, we can scrounge something up for supper after I get home... It gets pretty cold in here with the heater being broken. But there’s a jacket or two in the closet in my room, if you need ‘em.”
“I love you, Mrs. Rogers,” he whispered, placing soft, peppered kisses onto her lips as Toni tried to regain her breath. “I love you.”
But, the boredom didn’t last too long because then the United States joined the war, taking Bucky with it.
“Stop it with all the love! I can’t take it.” They heard Sam as he entered the kitchen, opening the refrigerator door, and grabbing a can of soda.
“Steve, down there.” Fury pointed. “Bucky and I will be right here; we can get into that room in less than three seconds. So, please, if you do, kill him quickly. I can alter the footage.” Fury disappeared into the second room, leaving Steve and Bucky alone in the hallway.
“They’re okay..." Steve watched the way the brunette eyes raked over every one of his drawings like they were made of solid gold.
Steve blinked back his tears and wrapped his father in a hug, not even minding the traitorous one that fell down his cheek as he cherished those words his father had spoken over him.
Fury stood in front of a large black door, pressing his hand against the Stark handprint scanner. The locks made a loud ‘
“How many are a lot, Rogers?” Toni asked as she took in the proud, almost cocky look on the smaller man's face.
Steve smiled and closed the distance between them, sealing his lips with the smaller women’s. Moaning as her fingers dropped from his neck to his shoulders, gripping his shoulder blades pulling the bigger man impossibly closer. Their lips moving against the others like the steps to a perfect tango. With perfect execution, familiarity, and passion. It was like an art craft that had been perfected.
“Hi, baby doll,” he whispered as their lips met, in what felt like it was for the first time in a month but was probably only twelve hours.
“Stark, what are you wearing under that suit?” Falcon asked. “I damn sure know a wedding dress wouldn’t fit.”
“Shut up, Barnes. I’ve walked in on you doing way worse.” Steve watched as Toni’s fingers buttoned up his shirt on her body and bit her lip as she caught him watching every delicate move her fingers made.
As the serum-enhanced couple, Clint, and Bucky were cleaning up dishes from breakfast, JARVIS alerted the room.
“Hello beautiful,” Steve breathed, dropping his forehead onto hers. Smiling as he felt the soft skin of his nose as it brushed against the side of his own. His black glasses softly bumping up his nose, only for Toni to gently fix them before dropping her hands back around his neck.
With that Bucky left the bedroom, slamming the door behind him. A huff left Toni’s lips as she stood to her feet. She didn’t know how to make this better. She didn’t know how to tell Steve, or even talk to Bucky about it. She and Bucky had never had any conflict before, ya know besides her parents' death. Toni had no idea what she was gonna do.
“I love you too,” he whispered, pulling back from the kiss. Smiling as he saw the brunette's eyes were gently closed as her tongue ran across her lips - as if she was trying to taste more of his kiss.
“Toni, I can’t afford that.” He told her as she pulled them over to the hall closet, opening the door to grab their coats.
“Tones?” The smaller man asked, making Toni’s brown eyes meet his blue with nothing but curiosity behind them. “I want ya to be my girl... If you wanna be tied to a fella like me, that is?”
“Steve?” Toni whispered, as she pulled on Steve’s black army sweatshirt. His last name was printed on the right side of the chest and sprawled in big white block letters on the backside across her shoulders. The sweatshirt was obviously three sizes too big for the brunette, but she looked drop dead gorgeous in it. “You ready?”
“He’s a very important man to me,” a fond smile rose on her lips as she thought about the man she knew as her father. Edwin Jarvis was one of a kind and she didn’t know where she would be without that man. “You’ll meet him one day.”
Her brown eyes fluttered open and she flashed that perfect smile at the younger man. “Yes, Steven, forever.”
“Brother, bring her back this instance. Lady Stark has been nothing but good to the people of Asgard.” The trickster god sat up on the table and smiled at his older brother.
“You are practically naked...” He whispered, a smirk growing on his own lips as his hands ran lower, landing on Toni’s plump behind.
“The one girl... The one girl that’s ever liked me like this..” Steve whispered, taking a seat on the couch. “And you kiss her? You try to take her from me before I can even have her?”
“How did this happen?” Toni asked, placing her hands on her hips. When she left for the office this morning, her team was adult-sized. Now here she is eight hours later and they’re seventeen fucking years old.
“It’s not..” Steve whispered, running his thumb delicately across Toni’s cheekbone. “It’s not that I don’t like sunsets... It’s just that if the sun was setting and you were beside me. I’d look at you. I’d always look at you.” Toni choked back a sob as she smiled at the older man and wiped a stray tear off his cheek.
“Toni! Just the dame I was looking for. There is a man on the phone asking for ya, says his name is Stephen Strange. That sound familiar?” Steve must have noticed Toni’s reaction to the name because he left his spot at the door walking over to his genius, a concerned look covering his face.
“Well, Miss. Grant.” He placed the white envelope in Toni’s hands, a soft smile gracing his face. “Have a wonderful rest of your day. I will call if your services are needed again.”
“No tricks brother. I just came to congratulate my favorite couple on their nuptials. I was a bit upset that I did not get an invitation though.”
An hour passed them by, as Daniel sat on the sofa, keeping Von Doom busy talking about work, life, the military, and so on. Toni had just finished up fixing the record player. She packed her tools back in the bag and lowered the lid down on the dark oak player.
“Should I be offended by that?” Steve asked Toni as Bucky pulled her onto his lap. He swore he heard some fans actually sobbing in the audience at the interaction between Bucky and Toni.
As Toni looked around, she smiled as she saw Nastaha and Edwin standing at the foot of her bed, slight smiles on their faces.
Just as Steve made his way to his bedroom door, he heard Bucky stand to his feet and ask: “You had every right to kick my ass, Stevie. Why didn’t ya?”
Steve’s body grew rigid, feeling the delicate movement of the genius’s plump lips through the fabric of his jeans. Steve had to remind himself to breathe as he felt most of the blood in his body start to change directions and head south instead.
They arrived at SHIELD headquarters about thirty minutes after leaving the tower, Steve’s mindset and form grew colder and stiffer by the minute.
“Thank you.” Toni smiled at the shorter man, then turned to Bucky, saying: “And don’t worry, Barnes. Your stuff is safe with me. Doubt I could get much for it anyway.” Toni sassed, throwing a wink at the much bigger man. Steve’s expression looked a bit taken back as Bucky’s grin only grew.
All those years of wishing for one moment to finally tell Howard Stark what a piece of shit he was. To tell him he didn’t break her, and that she was worth more than anything he ever made.
“This is more important, Steven.” She told him, laying her hand on his arm. “Let’s go, Monet awaits!” Toni dragged the smaller man out of the apartment, hearing his slight protests all the way down the stairs.
“You’re a thousand times more beautiful than that sunset, Toni... I love you.” And with that he captured her lips in a kiss, pulling her body tighter to his. Their lips moved in a passionate flurry as Steve’s large ran down Toni’s plump backside like he was claiming her as his. The moment was short, but had a fire burning in her lower abdomen almost instantly - Steve Rogers always had that effect on her.
“Thanks, Nat.” Toni closed the book, placing it under her arm, smiling seductively up at her soldier.
“Arc Reactor,” Toni told him in disbelief as she watched the younger man's hand gently caress the light in her chest.
“I’d be lying if I said no… Like I love him and he’s the most beautiful human being on the planet.” The blond smiled as he watched a blush run across Toni’s cheeks while she answered Bucky’s question.
Just now noticing she didn’t have to look up like she normally would to look into her lover's eyes. But, now she almost stood eye to eye with her much smaller fiancé, her being just an inch or two taller. Also noticing how close in proximity the two of them had gotten as if they’d been slowly drawn together.
“I’m sorry... Come again?” Toni asked, turning to see Natasha and Pepper with wide eyes as they took in Steve’s information. “You didn’t just tell me... That Howard Stark --”
“I would never.” Steve lifted up the empty trash bag to see if she had hidden them at the bottom of the trash can. “How dare you accuse me of something so scandalous, Antonia.”
” Steve reached his hand out, gently laying it over the center of the blue light. “What’s it called?”
Toni hadn’t noticed how the distance closed between their two faces. But, it had and Bucky’s blue eyes were staring right at Toni’s lips.
“I’ve already seen your penis, Steve.” She smiled at the laugh that bubbled off his lips. “It’s a great penis. My personal favorite, I love it.”
The whole group couldn’t hold back their laughter at Toni’s thought process of being in a triad with the two soldiers.
“Toni...” Steve moaned as Toni’s lips moved to his neck as her fingers fumbled trying to unbutton his pants.
“Sorry, I didn't want anyone to interrupt us.” Toni told them, smiling as she pulled her phone out of her pocket. “Yes, we found Steve. Alive.”
He had Bucky, and he was Steve’s oldest friend. Bucky knew almost everything there was to know about Steve Rogers. But there was something different when it came to his relationship with Toni.
Steve sent his final letter off and gave Howard a bag of his things, including his favorite white shirt that smelled like his girl. He told the man to keep them safe. That one day someone would want them. Steve told him to put it in an old chest he kept in his room, and to keep it safe. Howard nodded, promising he would as he took the bag from the bigger man's hands and wished him luck on his next mission.
This is the last chapter of this installment. I have absolutely adored sharing this story with y'all. I hope you enjoy the last chapter of this particular journey of Steve and Toni's.
“Oh?” Maria asked softly, a smile growing on her own as she took in Steve’s facial expression. Steve grinned even wider as he realized Toni got her breathtaking smile from her mother, along with her sculpted cheekbones.
“Find me everything you have on Daniel Richards - Brooklyn, New York. Probably born in the late 1870s.”
..” Fell off Toni’s lips in a breathy moan as she ran her fingers through his hair, slightly tugging on his golden locks.
“Yes, you saw him before he deployed. The changes from the experiment?” Toni asked, unlocking her phone, and going to her photo album.
“Yours.” Toni smiled at her crazy, possessive man as his teeth nipped at the sensitive skin on her neck.
“If I could guess, Edwin... Probably some R-rated drawings of your daughter.” Natasha stood to her feet, walking over to the laughing archer. “And I would really like to see these.”
“Yes, ma’am. That would be lovely.” They heard Steve as he and Bucky made their way back to the table. The taller boy rubbing his arm, as if he’d just been punched.
The green leather notebook had nude drawings of Toni. Steve had started to draw in that one a month after she started living with them, more after she left and
“That’s a good idea.” He whispered, dejected as he slumped his way to the door. Defeat was written all over his face. “Sleep well, Toni.”
Just as the blond took a seat beside Toni, wrapping his arm around her shoulders there was a knock on the door.
“Ya know, for the longest time I thought it was so sweet for a man to open a door and let a lady walk into a room before him, but after living with you and Bucky...” Toni rambled as she walked into the apartment, only to turn around to catch Steve in the exact act that was leaving her lips. “I realized you just do it to look at my ass.”
“Oh yes, yep! That’s me, tripped on the dance floor last night, and he carried me home. He’s such a gentleman.” The older man smiled, believing the lie that just left Toni’s lips.
“You alright, doll?” Steve asked, wrapping his arms around her waist from behind. Pressing his body flush to hers, as he tucked his face into her neck.
“Let me see!” Toni threw the shirt into the chest and sprinted across the room to the green sketchbook that Clint and Natasha were flipping through.
Steve nodded his head, biting the inside of his cheek. Howard hadn’t once even mentioned his daughter. Steve knew any parent worth their salt after being thrown into the future, their first question would have been about their own child.
“Yes, follow me.” He led them out of the dark office, down the blinding white hall, and into what seemed to be a living room.
“Well,” Toni stacked a folder neat on the edge of her desk and fondly rolled her eyes. “Help me grab a heavy box from the supply closet then.”
It was nice to see that Toni was affected by Steve's physical appearance just like he was with hers.
’ signaling the door had unlocked, inviting them into a dark hallway where two more black steel doors were revealed.
When Toni wasn’t at SI, at SHIELD working, or out on a mission - She was in the lab, in their bedroom, or lounging around the living room.
“We should head back. Buck will kill me if you get sick.” Toni whispered, squeezing his hand tighter. Steve nodded his head as his eyes caught an older couple selling flowers across the street. He had a buck in his pocket but he knew exactly what he was gonna spend it on.
“No, no he’s right. Steve does need guy time...” Toni told them. “You guys should plan a guy’s night out!” She flashed her teammates a smile, and placed the warm ceramic cup to her lips, taking another sip of the liquid gold that was coffee.
Toni’s heart broke for him. He hadn’t seen them in over seventy years and didn’t even get to grieve their death as they had been long gone before they unfroze him. Toni just watched as the older man's lip began to quiver as he listened to his parent’s voice over the speakers.
Steve couldn’t stop the grin that grew on his lips. God, just when he thought Toni couldn't get even more perfect, she had to go and speak fluent Italian.
“As sweet as this is, it’s kinda gross now,” Natasha said, making a laugh bubble off of Toni’s lips.
Toni sighed, leaning her head on Steve’s broad shoulder as he rested beside her on the leather sofa.
Bucky turned his attention down to the shaking brunette as she rested in his arms, her face buried into his neck - taking soft, shaky, comforting breaths.
The two heroes exchanged their vows, their promises to love one another for the rest of their lives. Their promise to always be there for the other, to cherish them in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer. The superhero couple smiled as their bridesmaids and groomsmen couldn’t hold back tears as the two
“What?” Sarah whispered, pulling away from her husband's embrace, her soft blue eyes taking in the ring on Toni’s finger. “That’s my...” Sarah grabbed her left hand, smiling as she felt the same ring on her finger. “You? You’re with my Steven?” Sarah whispered.
Now, Toni knew this look. Steve got this look in his eyes often. When Toni would wear his clothes, a pair of yoga pants, and even her Captain America pajamas. Not long after she saw this look in her Captain's eyes, he would sweep her off her feet, toss her over his shoulder and take her to the bedroom or the nearest flat surface.
“My grandpa,” he whispered. Hands moving faster as he worked with some wires, not wanting to look the shorter genius in the face.
“Yeah,” Steve whispered, concern showing on his face. Toni shook her head softly, grabbing the small bouquet from his hands. Bringing them up to her nose, taking in the faint smell of the white roses. Relief flushed his body as he watched her smile grow from ear to ear.
Toni boarded the train with one final look to her smaller fiancé. Getting situated in the cabin she was instructed to by Strange and watched as the doors closed, taking her love from view.
“Alright, fellas. Who wants to spin me around the dance floor?” They both turned their attention to Toni as she made her way down the hallway.
Just as he began to pull the olive green button-up off her shoulders Toni yelled through their kiss.
“Yep, no celebrities or anything like that. But, if we ever meet an alternate version of ourselves we gave each other full rights to fuck them.”
She flipped her phone around showing her future in-laws a picture of Steve in a pile of puppies that they had rescued. The bigger man was sitting on the ground, donning his Captain America suit with an unbelievably wide smile on his face as the puppies jumped and licked him all over.
“I’m so proud of you son. Not just for… saving the world or risking your life…” Joseph turned and looked at Toni. “But for finding a good woman, for treating her right...” He smiled back at Steve and whispered. “And for letting her treat you like you deserve as well. Steven, I couldn’t have asked for a better son... or a better daughter-in-law.”
Steve watched his future wife having the time of her life, being thrown around the kitchen floor as Bucky led her in a dance they’d grown up learning. Steve couldn't wipe the joy off his face if he tried. He knew of Toni’s love for the 1930s and ’40s and loved watching her have an authentic experience of it in Bucky’s guiding arms. Ballroom dances and dance marathons were all the rage growing up in the 1930s. Steve never being one for dancing didn’t care for it then. But watching Toni spinning around the kitchen floor made Steve wish he could take her back for a night at a sock hop and spend the evening in each other's arms on the dance floor.
Toni was a safe space like Steve had never experienced before. The two heroes had gotten off to a rocky start back at The Battle of New York, but they moved past that quickly and had gotten to know who the person was that actually lied beneath their mantles.
“100%, I’ve seen his work, Steven. Overrated, and I know he’s technically post-impressionist but he still counts.”
“The most popular ones are Steve and Toni, Steve and Bucky, and Toni and Bucky. Hell, I even saw one that was the three of them, Stuckony or something like that.” Clint added.
The couple laid there for another fifteen minutes. Toni smiled proudly as she was finally breaking the Steve Rogers code. She was finally learning the hidden secrets of her man's heart. Steve was smiling because of the weight that was finally leaving his chest. The weight he didn’t even know he was carrying until Toni took it from him.
“Oh yeah, after the bath I borrowed these, I hope that’s okay. My clothes should be dry by tomorrow evening, I--.”
Toni smiled at the irony of the situation and nodded in agreement. “The feeling is mutual, big guy.”
“Get the information, get out, marry Toni,” Steve whispered back to his brother - like a soldier confirming his mission. No emotion, just fact. “Get the information, get out, marry Toni.”
A couple of weeks passed by since that Wednesday where Toni came in on her day off, saving the office from turmoil, pulling Bucky and Clint’s heads out their asses, and getting them together.
Steve shouted, raising his hands into the air, for the god to stop talking about fucking Toni. “Let’s stop talking about making love to Toni
Toni ran her hands through her hair, a loud exhale falling from her lips as the events that just took place finally began registering in her brain. Toni took an uneven breath and felt her knees give out beneath her. Not fighting the exhaustion that racked through her body, she prepared herself to hit the cold concrete floor, only to be caught in Steve’s strong arms.
Steve laughed at the antics between his future wife and brother. They were truly like brother and sister, always picking on one another, and starting petty arguments. They acted like Steve remembered Bucky and his sister Rebecca’s relationship.
So, Steve hoped he could work his way up in Timely Comics, and that way he would be able to safely provide for Toni and their future family. Toni of course told him that she thought he would make an amazing soldier and he shouldn’t give those dreams up for anybody. Steve smiled at her, seeing the love in her eyes as she supported him and his dreams. He just held her closer in his arms and whispered that she was his dream now, nothing else mattered. Toni kissed him sweetly as those words fell off his lips, but as she pulled away Steve saw a sadness in her eyes.
“My armor,” Toni told her, giving Pepper a quick hug. “Keep Sarah out of trouble. We’ll be back, I promise you Pepper Potts. I’m getting married today.” Pepper placed a kiss on Toni's lips and smiled at her best friend.
“Nonsense, my treat,” Toni told him, grabbing a dollar from her pocket, pulling the smaller man alongside her to the hotdog stand.
And as if it was on cue, Clint tossed a paper airplane across the office. Hitting Bucky right in the face.
“James Barnes, this is an absolutely lovely woman you’ve got here. Handy, smart, and gorgeous. You checked all the boxes, son.”
“I’m... Okay... Happens when I -- When I get excited.” Toni nodded her head and stood up from the table, making her way over to the sink to get him a glass of water. Bringing it back to the table she placed it in front of his right hand and smiled.
“Hey! Don’t you speak to her that way.” Joseph shouted, catching the whole room off guard. “She’s a lady, you will speak to her with respect. Do you understand, son?”
“I know!” Toni turned her attention to the blond super-soldier, a smile wide on her lips. “Stevie, I gotta borrow the shield.”
Steve coiled back in disbelief as he heard Daniel refer to Toni as Bucky’s girl. Looking at his best friend, Steve saw the same shock on his face. They both noticed Toni stand up from her seat on the couch and wave her hand down by her thigh. Signaling both men to go along with the charade.
Steve just smiled as he watched Pepper roll her eyes, taking his bride across the roof top to talk to some friends.
Those two thought the other hung the moon and stars. It was so cute to see how they’d been married for over twenty years and still doted on each other like they were freshly dating.
“Not possible.” Steve’s hands danced up and down the lace that covered her back, settling perfectly, finding their claim right atop her backside. Smiling as those brown eyes he loved so much rolled fondly at his actions.
“You can ignore these man-children. What’s your question, sweetheart?” Toni asked, making the blonde’s blush grow even wider.
“Let’s bring the trophy home, brother Barnes!” Thor said, rubbing his hands together in excitement. Toni and Nat caught the millionth eye roll from the tiny Steve Rogers and couldn’t help the laughs that fell off their lips.
All three men shouted to Toni; chase forgotten as none of them had expected the brunette to suggest that.
A loud gasp leaving Toni’s lips as she felt Steve’s large hands on her body, shaking her back into reality. Toni blinked, taking in the shattered plate at her feet, and the scrambled eggs all over the floor.
“I’ll be okay... I should be askin’ you the same question, doll.” The brunette sighed in response, staring up into his blue eyes as they were lit perfectly by the moonlight shining through the window.
“Wrapped right around her fucking finger.” Howard huffed, looking Steve’s form up and down with a look of disappointment. “Disgusting.”
hehe, can y'all guess what's gonna happen next?! Comments and kudos are always appreciated! Feel free to scream at me in the comments!!
“No,” Toni mumbled, as she continued folding the same pair of pants she’d been folding since he walked into the room.
“I’ll be alright,” Toni reassured the bigger man. “Might have a bruise or two.” Steve’s hands tightened on her butt, pulling her close to his chest.
“Bed in a minute.” He groaned, finally removing her shirt from her shoulders, his hands going to unbutton her soft, brown pleated pants.
A low growl escaped his chest as he danced his eyes up and down the exposed skin around the arc reactor. Digging his nails into the palms of his hand as he was fighting back every instinct and urge to rip that dress right off her and carry her to their room.
“Nope,” Steve told them, with a shake of his head. “Toni and I are best friends and co-leaders of The Avengers.”
“You’re right. I’m not.” Steve moved his lips down Toni’s jaw, leaving a trail of tiny bruises on her collarbone.
“Let’s go answer some crazy questions!” Bucky shouted as he ran ahead of the group towards the stage door.
Not two minutes after the doors closed Toni felt her hands begin to vibrate, as a green glow appeared around them and soon her whole body followed.
Toni opened her eyes taking in the appearance of an old, brown, wooden slatted ceiling. She sat up, pushing the heavy quilts off her body. Noticing the voices that had filled the room, came to a full stop.
“Yeah, a genius told me that. She also tells me she’s never wrong, so it would go against a scientific fact to disagree with her.”
He wondered what she would think of his new role as Captain America? If she would like his new body? Or if she would like him doing shows around the world?
“Yes, back to nerf wars!” Toni agreed, patting her soldier on the chest. “I’ll be waiting in our bed when you’re done, Captain Rogers” Toni swayed her way down the hallway to their bedroom, with a laughing Natasha trailing after her.
“You’re my bride,” Steve told her, carrying her through the threshold of their bedroom door. “I get to carry you like this whenever I want now.”
Then it hit him, his head was laying on her chest, and his arms wrapped tightly around her lower back. Steve pulled back with a yelp and stumbled into Bucky.
“What?” Steve asked, eyes growing wide as he took in the information his brother just spoke. He looked over at the brunet seeing his fist clenched by his side as he looked like he was in pain.
“Rude!” The archer shouted, turning his body, to lay his feet into Toni’s lap. Toni rolled her eyes as purple socked feet laid down on her thighs, and she turned her attention to Natasha.
“Yes, I’m sure it’ll be great,” Steve said, throwing a glare to his friend as the bigger man's arm went around his shoulder.
Steve walked over to the chest and gently ran his hand across the lid. It felt like he was like seeing an old friend again after years apart.
“Anyways,” Stephen cleared his throat. “You have two days left here. Which, a day here is about twelve hours at home, and that’s enough time to gather a couple of other sorcerers and bring you home. But, here is a train ticket for Friday afternoon. Board the train and we will grab you from there.” Toni took the ticket from the taller man's hands and slowly nodded her head.
“Too tired for cheeseburgers?” Happy asked, a smile grew on his lips as he caught a glance of Toni in his rearview mirror.
“Yeah, I am. There are way worse things than a couple of neighbors thinking a beautiful dame like you belongs to me.” Toni smiled fondly at the taller man, her brown eyes softening as she looked up at the brunet man. Steve felt his heart sink in his chest. It always went like this: Steve fell for the girl and the girl fell for Bucky. Why would this time be any different?
They were always the first to take the love seat during movie night, and that soon became their spot. No one dared to sit in the loveseat after this one-time Steve lifted Clint up by the collar of his shirt, threw him off of his cushion, and across the room. The soldier didn’t pay any mind to where the archer ended up, he just settled back into his seat. Lifted his arm up, ignoring his shocked teammates, and let the much smaller genius curl up into his chest, like she always did.
“Toni, no..” He whispered, licking his lips as his eyes continued to drink in Toni in his jacket. “That’s your money, doll. You were supposed to use that to buy ya some new shoes.”
“What stuff?” Steve asked as he laid his future bride down on their mattress, crawling over top of her body, and burying his face into her neck. Toni ran her hands through his blond hair, her nails softly scratching his scalp, comforting the bigger man.
“Toni, you’re alright. You can use whatever you need,” Steve told her, stopping the brunette mid-rant. “We don’t have much, but if ya want it - it’s yours.”
“Give that back!” Sam shouted, snatching the drink out of the metal man's hand. “Get your own..” Sam took a long refreshing sip of
After dancing through six straight songs - Bucky was pulling Toni back to the table, begging the dame to take a breath.
Toni asked softly. Not sure what was actually happening right at this moment. All she knew was she felt a wave of exhaustion rush over her like she had just gotten out of a battle. That Bucky was taking care of her. Bucky made her feel safe.
The geniuses shared a soft smile, and then Toni turned back to the machine in front of her. She took one look at the panel in front of her and threw her hands in the air, shouting: “Why the flying fuck are you using a UTP cable when you should be using a VGA?” She turned to Reed, a bright smile on her lips. “You’re the stupidest genius I've ever met.”
As Toni made her way into one of SHIELD’s labs, she saw Sue and Reed fretting over what Toni assumed was the machine that had brought her parents here.
“Toni, Toni Grant. Nice to meet you.” The older man took in the brunette's appearance and nodded his head.
He knew how to recover a file he accidentally deleted, to pull up his history, or how to save a PDF. He just loved it when he would look up from his desk, pull his black frames up his nose and flash that beautiful brunette a ‘please help me’ grin.
He shouted. His tone dropped dark as he let an angry growl rip from his throat. The dam had burst and there was no going back from this.
Toni turned her attention back to her fourth cup of coffee that rested in between her palms as she listened to the guys begin to discuss their big plans for their guys' night.
Toni watched as Steve clenched his jaw, his blue eyes growing darker at the words that left the smaller woman's mouth.
“He’s everything I prayed for,” Toni whispered, twirling her ring around on her finger. “He’s one of the good ones.”
He wasn’t weird about it, because sometimes he caught her smiling at him too. Toni would watch him as he sold more products to a client than they needed, using his silver tongue to keep him at the top of the sales leader board where he had been the past four years.
She pulled the door open, revealing an older man - he seemed to be in his late fifties, with short grey hair, and a pair of thick-rimmed, white glasses that rested on his fairly large nose.
The two made their way to a small park, taking a seat on the bench as they quietly ate their food and shared their coke.
Toni would tell him she knows he could do more than dumb, bond-selling shows for the United States Government, that he was worth more than that.
“What happened? Is the team, okay?” Toni asked, her heart already dropping in her chest as her head ran through every terrible outcome. “Is Steve, okay?”
“Of course, Steven. You two take a seat; this is your home after all. I’m gonna get out of these work clothes, and I’ll be right back.”
“Avengers, it’s go time,” they heard a new voice in the room. Steve turned his attention to the door and saw a tall, slender man with a headset on and a clipboard in his hands.
Super excited for this chapter!! Slight mentions of past child abuse. Get ready for some bad ass Toni and protective Steve!!
Toni smiled as she took in the painting in front of her. A painted version of her and Steve kissing on a white, wooden bridge. His arms wrapped around her waist as she was dressed in navy blue, a-line dress from the ’30s.
” Steve whispered, taking the genius’ smaller hand into his own, grabbing her attention back. Her brown eyes were glued to his lips as she didn’t understand a word that fell off his lips. But by the way, her eyes darkened at his words, Steve knew she loved it.
Steve nodded his head at the man and as he turned to Toni, doing everything in his power to keep his anger concealed, because even though every part of his being wanted to pull this ticket selling punk from his desk and give him the old one, two. He couldn't, this night was for him and Toni to relax, this was their night. Ignoring the annoying glare from the ticket salesmen, Steve turned to Toni, waiting for her to pay the man when felt her slipping something in his pants pocket. Steve raised an eyebrow, wondering what his genius was up to.
“Watch yer mouths, or I’ll toss your asses out of these fancy windows,” Bucky said, scolding the other two teenagers.
Steve couldn't fight the blush on his cheeks as Toni flashed him a smirk. Her chocolate gaze running over his biceps, painting over his shoulders in his black button-up and back down his chest to settle on his muscular thighs. Steve just beamed with pride as Toni's heated gaze continued to linger on his form.
“Take your time, he's loaded.” Toni busted out in laughter, and she didn’t miss the curious glance Mr. Von Doom threw in their direction either.
Steve stood up from the sofa., looking down the hall in the direction of his bedroom door that held his dame. “You touch her again and I’ll kill you.”
“JARVIS, you’re a dick," Toni said, resting her hands onto her thighs as she tried to catch her breath from running up all those stairs. The AI had no response, but if an AI could laugh, Toni would bet he would be laughing right now.
“He’s on the phone for ya.” Daniel reminded them, his green eyes looking a bit foggy which had Toni a bit on edge.
“What’s with all the bickering?” They heard as the lab door opened, revealing the younger Storm sibling. “Stark and Richards shouldn’t even be in the same room together. Nah let me have Stark, we can go to my lab and have some fun.”
“Steve..” She cried, shaking her head ‘no’, and continued saying: “I’ll come back. I promise... I can’t stay away from you, Steve Rogers.”
“I’ll see you when you’re older, kid.” Steve’s cheeks blushed cherry red as he smiled back at the brunette, saying: “I’ll see you when I’m older.”
The dress was nothing fancy, nothing you’d see the biggest Hollywood stars in on the cover of magazines because well, that just wasn’t Toni.
“This fucking place falls apart without Stark, I swear,” Coulson muttered walking away from the jammed printer. Leaving the big gray machine to whirr as the screen blinked
“So, who were you trying to bring here?” Toni asked, as she and Reed looked over the interface of the machine.
“I dunno, we live together, I see them every day,” Steve muttered. “Plus, Bucky and I had breakfast together this morning, and Clint and I were in the gym most of the day yesterday. I’m with them all the time.”
“Bra and panties?” Clint asked. Toni heard muffled laughs over the comm line and an uncomfortable groan from Steve.
A flicker of lust flashed through Toni’s chocolate brown eyes as a mischievous grin appeared on her lips.
Toni took the cucumbers off her eyes, popping one into her mouth. She looked over at the redhead that rested in the chair beside her, who apparently had also removed her cucumbers. Toni smiled and with a crunch, she responded: “Yeah, he’s very big on physical touch. I think that’s his love language or something.”
“He’s kind, intelligent, and much older than me...” Toni whispered. “He has blond hair and blue eyes.” Steve cracked one eye open, raising his eyebrow as he stared at the shorter woman in surprise.
Steve turned away from the pathetic man curled up on the floor, and pointed his gaze toward Maria Stark, asking one more time.
Steve let a moment or two pass before he sucked his teeth and sighed, knowing Bucky would never hurt him like this, not on purpose. As much as he wanted to scream and yell at him, as much as he wanted to beat the ever-living shit out of him, he just couldn’t - because that wasn’t how Steve Rogers dealt with his family.
“T, we haven’t spent more than fifteen minutes alone with Steve in over six months,” Sam stated, lifting his head off the table, to throw a glance in Toni’s direction.
Toni's smile grew wide, as she dropped the dishes in the sink and ran over to Bucky, taking his hands into hers.
“Forget Steve, I don’t know if my body could physically handle two super-soldiers! That’s so much man... Well...” Toni muttered, her thoughts trailing off.
Toni whispered softly. She couldn’t help but laugh as she watched his blue eyes grow wide from shock, as he pulled away from Toni’s embrace.
“Okay! I’ll be right back!” And with that, the smaller man took off running for his bedroom. Toni eyed the green sketchbook, every part of her wanting to get her hands on it and see what he’d been drawing. Especially because of how quickly he closed it when she made her way over to the table.
“Oh, you’ll freeze out there,” Bucky said, grabbing one of his jackets and laying it around Toni’s shoulders. “Here, what kinda fella would I be if I let my girl outside without a jacket on.”
“Lady Stark, your lips would be treasured on Asgard. Many would pay greatly to watch that right in the court.”
“Come on,” She whispered, making room in the bed for the smaller man. Steve crawled softly in the twin bed, laying his head down on their shared pillow.
“Toni, doll. You could never, you’re our daughter.” Joseph said, smiling as he wrapped his arm around his son's shoulders. “You’re family.”
The taller man’s face ran even paler. His mustache-covered lips turning to a frown, as he took into account Daniel’s tone of voice and his body language.
“You’re a sweet lookin’ dish yourself, Toni.” He smiled, sadly as they shared a soft moment - knowing she wasn’t just leaving Steve, but for him too.
“Yeah, he was an ugly bastard.” Toni agreed, smiling as the older man threw his head back in laughter.
“Of course I do, I love him.” She told him like it was the one true thing she knew in her life and if Toni was being honest; her love for Steve and his love for her was the only thing she really knew she could depend on. “You don’t kiss your best friend's girl! Everyone knows that, James!”
The four boys all turned to face Toni and Natasha; spoons filled with ice cream still in their hands.
The anger she heard rising in his tone was something she was not used to. She and Bucky had never fought before. While they were both stubborn assholes, they always got along. They were the others' safe space when it came to certain things in their lives.
“You aren’t going anywhere near him,” Steve whispered into her hair, as his grip tightened on her hips. “I promise.”
“Leave her alone.” Sarah muttered, smiling as her husband wrapped his arms around her waist. “My name is Sarah Rogers, and this is my husband, Joseph.”
“I love you more, Mrs. Rogers.” Toni couldn’t help the blush that rushed her cheeks as she smiled at her future husband.
The brunette just shook her head at the stupid antics of their friends, ignoring their shouts, and just as she turned back to Steve. About to ask the bigger man to finish his thoughts when Bucky and Clint came barreling through the door.
“I won’t be home till mornin’, so ya can take my bedroom tonight. It’ll be much better than that lumpy couch ya slept on last night.”
“Oh, okay, good. Whew!” Toni turned to face Steve, smiling at him like she had known him for years. Looped her left hand around his arm, like she’d done it a billion times before, and said: “How about we eat some dinner... That sound good?”
No calls for a fight, no meetings for SHIELD, just a regular old week, and every single Avenger was bored out of their
“Love it. Let me just put on another one of the dresses I got today and I’ll meet you two by the door?”
Toni scratched her head, blinking her eyes, fighting every urge she had to run and jump Steve Rogers right in the middle of the SHIELD hallway.
Within seconds of JARVIS alert, Toni shot out of the lab, taking the stairs three at a time, thanking Howard for the first time in her life for this serum that ran through her veins.
“Of course, doll,” Steve whispered, his hand running through her short pixie cut he loved so much. He couldn’t hold back his grin as those beautiful brown eyes fluttered closed, and she leaned in closer to his touch.
“James... I know you didn’t do this on purpose. I know...” Toni told him. “I know you better than you think.”
“Oh, there’s no need to be embarrassed. Adrenaline is soaring through your veins after a fight, it’s normal.” She reassured them both as she took Toni’s bruised wrist into her hand. “I’m just gonna wrap this up and then let you get to bed. You’ve had a long day, Toni. I’m sure Steve and Bucky won’t mind sharing a bed for tonight.”
She just shook her head softly and whispered: “Wait." As she got up off the bed and stood to her feet, beginning unbuttoning her white shirt.
“Let’s get married! Let’s go right now!” Steve couldn’t lose Toni, not when he just got her. “Toni, I wanna marry you.”  Steve antagonized as he watched the tears fall down his lover's cheeks. “I wanna spend forever with you... We can go to the courthouse... Bucky can be our witness - Toni please.” He muttered between wet kisses.
“Thank you, Clint.” Sue chuckled and flashed Toni a soft smile, mouthing a quick ‘Thank you.’ As a way of letting Toni know she had heard their quick, friendship rekindling conversation. Toni just nodded her head to the blonde and turned back to Reed.
“Welcome back fellas," Toni said softly and made her way over to her full-grown, sleeping fiancé who rested on the third sofa in the living room.
And with that Steve stood up from his seat, walking across the kitchen floor as the fully grown, enhanced-super heroes continued their arguments of ‘Nuh uh’ and ‘Yeah huh’. Steve wrapped his arms around the genius’s waist and threw her over his shoulder. A shriek leaving her lips as her face, yet again collided with her supersoldier muscular back.
“Good to be back.” Steve smiled at the shorter man, and out of the corner of his eye saw the old wooden chest that used to sit in his bedroom in Brooklyn. His gaze darted over to Toni before he did a double-take, making sure this was real. That the chest was actually there and this wasn’t his mind playing games on him.
“What is going on, why are you taking me to my bedroom?” Toni laughed as they pulled her into her room. “Steve isn’t gonna like this.”
A little insight of how Toni is spending her days in the 30's, a nice surprise character reference and artist Steve!!!
She was sitting on the couch, Clint’s head resting in her lap as he complained about not being able to wear a purple suit at the wedding.
speak that way about a lady!” Steve jerked forward in Bucky’s arms, fuming at Clint. “Especially not
Coming up empty, his eyes landed back on the gash on Toni’s cheek as she softly nodded her head. Thankful it had been Daniel and Elisa that opened that door, and not Steve.
Just as Toni was about to tell this man to fuck off, that she didn’t need a man's permission to dance with anyone. Toni remembered where she was and what time period she was in.
” Bucky shouted over his shoulder, as he made his way closer to the passed-out dame. “Miss, miss are you alright?” Checking her neck for a pulse and breathing a sigh of relief as he felt the
“I know just what you need.” The grey-haired lady disappeared behind the stand. Reappearing not a second later, walking back over to Steve with a small bouquet of three pure white roses.
“One second, babe.” And with that, she walked into the kitchen and grabbed the midnight blue apron that hung on the pantry door.
Steve paced around the living room floor as Stephen Strange searched the multiverses for signs of Toni. It had been a little over an hour since Loki pulled another one of his tricks, sending Toni off to God knows where leaving Steve and the tower's residents a mess with worry. All Steve could think about is what if she's gone forever. What if time fucked him over
“First Stevie with the brunette, and you with a fella…” Joseph whispered, scratching the back of his neck. “Why, this is wonderful!”
“Yep, those.” Pepper said, unhooking the last button on the dress just in time for the Iron Man armor to walk into Toni and Steve’s bedroom.
So, between no caffeine, grumpy, sleepy coworkers, and his father, bugging him every thirty minutes since his day had begun. The day hadn’t started off well at all.
Pre-serum, slightly jealous Stevie in this chapter. Also you are introduced to my very first OC, I love him very much and I hope you will to.
Steve watched as his best friend explained their kisses. He watched as his best friend apologized with a tear running down his face.
Thanks for reading!! Comments and Kudos are always appreciated!! Let me know your ideas and how you think the story is gonna go!!
and then the robot took off to wheel around the middle of the lab doing his happy circles. Toni shook her head with a grin and turned down to look at U and HOMER.
As the bridesmaids and Clint made their way down the aisle, Toni couldn't help but smile at what was her life.
use that tone with me, Steven.” Toni glowered at the taller man. Reminding him that no matter how angry he got - he was never allowed to speak to her like that.
After the manicures and pedicures were finished, Nat and Toni made their way to the third part of their day: the massage rooms.
“You didn’t have to say that,” Clint muttered. Steve caught the soda can with ease and sat it down on the kitchen table.
They followed the impatient butler down a long hallway. The walls were white and bright, not a speck of dirt in sight. As weird styles of silver masks hung sporadically on the walls.
I’m a strong, intelligent woman. Despite how every single day of my life you shouted at me, telling me I’m nothing.” Toni poked her finger into his chest and growled. “Telling me how dumb I was and reminding me;
“Steve? Sweetie? Don’t you wanna know what you do?” Toni asked, walking over to the empty spot beside the tiny super-soldier.
“You were accidentally pulled into the future.” Toni muttered, folding her hands together in front of her chest.
“I think it’s genius, really.” He whispered, his tongue running across his bottom lip as he moved closer to Toni, resting his hands in their rightful place on her hips. Toni smiled and placed a soft kiss on his glistening lips.
Pepper and Natasha took lead in decorations, apparently the roof was turned into a garden. Faux grass, and vines and flowers galore - white roses of course. Clint promised her it was breathtaking. Neither the bride or groom had seen it, but it had been approved by everyone - Edwin Jarvis and Nick Fury included.
“I knew it. Thank you... Knowing that he ends up with someone he really cares for... Thank you, that punk means a lot to me.”
Steve rolled his eyes at his best friend's dramatic antics as she turned her smaller body away from his. Her eyes now resting on Thor and Bucky forms.
“I want kids...” Toni raised an eyebrow as the blond kissed her hip bones. “One day. Not now! Please, don’t freak out.” A laugh fell off the brunette's lips as she took in the panicked look in his blue eyes.
“Johnny, I will go get him. Howard Stark or not, he will kick your ass” Clint threatened the boy. Toni rolled her eyes as the two boys continued bantering back and forth.
“Yes, thank you, ma’am,” Bucky said, knocking his best friend upside the head. “Look at her when you talk, you jerk,” he whispered.
“Aren't you hurt?” Toni raised her eyebrow, concerned for the man's physical wounds. Not wanting to jostle his injured ribs.
No one ever came close to topping Steve’s sales, he was the best in the office, probably the company. Steve knew the only other person that would be able to beat him in sales would be Toni, and he would gladly lay his crown down for her.
But that wasn’t something he wanted to confess in a room of over five hundred fans and most of his teammates. Hell, that was something he was only just now admitting to himself.
