“Who are you?” asked Thor.
Tony pulled Steve close, marking the omega in turn. “Wouldn’t want any alphas getting any ideas.”
"It's your fault. Sir, is here because of you!"
“Again, I’m sorry about the damage,” he said.
"Jarvis, connect him to the home line."
“I’m fine.”
Steve dropped his bagel, stunned at the bomb put in his lap.
“You aren’t a monster,” he said.
“I will comply.”
“Yes."
“We’ll handle it in the morning. Go to sleep.”
“Monkeys? I do not understand-
“Right, I caught his act in Stuttgart,” said Steve.
“No, did you think I would forget that you stole his keys,” said Steve.
“You don’t have to ask me,” he said.
"Because of him, you won't have to pick me up for our next date."
He had to get to his mate. Of course, as soon as he leaves Steve goes into labor that's his luck. He ran to the roof of the hospital, tossing the suitcase to the ground. It transformed into a full suit of armor. It opened for him, locking around him. He took off at supersonic speed.
“I don’t know what I did to deserve someone so perfect.”
“To tear us apart.”
“Two beta nurses. Don’t know what happened to them. Don’t care either. One of them was a giant butt hole, hit me when I couldn’t fight back. And there was a peppery smelling alpha guard. He wasn’t there much, but he always wore a mask. So he had something to hide.”
"I hate that you had to see that."
“Introduce yourself, Jarvis," said Tony.
He woke the omega. Steve's eyes briefly opened his then closed them again.
“Nat?” Steve asked, coming to. He moved off her. "I'm sorry."
"I don't know where you are sweetheart, but I need you, please."
Piper nodded, picking out a green apple flavor. “Thank you.” She got dressed and happily popped the lollipop in her mouth.
“Yes."
He nodded.
“What did you choose?” asked Steve.
“You and me both,” said Tony.
Piper stared as his stomach. She thought he'd be bigger. Lena told her he pregnant. It could have been a lie. Or it could still be in the early stages. Six months was two heats. Every three months, she'd been dropped off with Aunt Pepper and Aunt Maria. It wasn't difficult to put it together. It was merely biology. The idea of Papa and Daddy doing that stuff was yucky. She closed her eyes, processing his scent. But she couldn’t pick up on any changes. Maybe he was wearing scent blockers.
"But it seems obsessive. Yesterday, I nearly slept for twenty hours straight."
“What if I can’t?!”
“Just as much of a smartass as your father,” she muttered. Her frail arms wrapped around his neck. She smelled of jasmine tea and a light floral perfume. He flinched as she slapped him on the back of the head before breaking the embrace.
"Fine, hold it in. While you're stuck in your head I'm here with Piper. Maybe think about that."
Steve groaned.
Tony laughed, only hearing the end of the conversation. “What brings you’re here, Furry?”
“Not trapped," said Phil.
“We were raised together. We played together. We fought together-
"Yes, little miss, I'm delighted that you are home."
"Let's take Piper to meet Peggy tomorrow. Banner won't be done for days. We promised the old bird a visit," said Tony.
“Please, leave me alone until then,” he begged. Steve burrowed into the nest, not wishing to be seen. His shame deepening. From his blanketed shelter, he heard Tony purring. He sunk into the mattress, soothed by the deep rumbling sound. His eyes closed. What an alpha he had found.
“Don’t look so tense there’s no reason to overthink things,” she said.
(July 28, 2013)
“I’m here,” whispered Steve.
Edith tried avoiding situations where she was left alone with Stark. She hadn't much occasion to be with him. She mostly worked with Steve and their appointments had become less frequent. Now she mostly worked as his gynecologist He only ever made an appointment with her if it were to replace the birth control implant in his arm.
He went to one of the lockers, taking out bandages.
“Say it again, please,” he said gently nosing against the alpha’s neck. The words were difficult for the alpha, but that made him want to hear them all the more to make sure it was real.
“Steve."
“You’re right,” he said. He got to his feet. “Jarvis, can you erase this conversation?”
“I think its only fitting.”
“Now what are you two hen clucking about."
“They told me to keep an eye on you.”
"Stark secure server now transferring to all known receivers."
Her small brow wrinkled. She didn’t understand. Piper wouldn’t understand even if he explained what work was. He rubbed her back.
Steve slowly woke, falling back into the pillows. His arm stretched out for his mate. He growled when he discovered Tony wasn’t there. Steve got up from bed and went out into the hall. From there, he heard Tony talking with Rhodes. He went into the kitchen, giving a quick wave to Rhodes before throwing his alpha over his shoulder and grabbing a jar of pickles from the cabinet.
Tony gulped. He would be alone with Piper for five days. That would be the longest the two had ever spent together alone.
Steve shook his head. Tony let him be. "I'll be the workshop if you need me."
He kicked started the bike. The motor purred to life. “I’ve missed that sound."
“Me too sweetheart.”
“Don’t go near him!” snarled Tony.
*****
A bald man with an eye patch stepped out of the car. He had a dangerous aura to him, which set him on high alert. “Who’s that?” asked Rune.
Piper crawled to the end of the bed.
Tony checked jet’s travel path on the monitors. It was locked on the massive base’s heat source. They were only minutes away. He put on his helmet.
“Tony.”
“It doesn’t look good.”
“Please call me, Steve."
“What did they tell you about me?” asked Tony.
“There’s a debriefing packet waiting for you at Stark Tower,” said Fury.
The request worked in Lena’s favor, so she allowed it. Winter’s presence during the appointment would make Piper less likely to try anything.
"That would require you holding still for more than five minutes," he said.
“Can I snag one?” asked Tony.
“She’s your-
“Just a role. ‘The Mandarin’, see, it’s not real.”
“Are you sure?” asked Tony.
“Steve."
“What do I smell like to you?” asked Steve.
“Nothing,” said Tony.
“What are they saying?” asked Steve.
"Okay, first thing first I need the armor. Where we at with it?"
“No, I want some time alone”, he said.
How many were affected by trying to replicate the results that made him? It was for the best that formula was lost.
Winter went silent. His gaze focused on the wall.
“I didn’t take you as the overprotective daddy type,” said Tony.
"Come on, Steve," said Tony, grabbing his hand. He wasn't going to pass up the chance to sleep while their daughter was in trusted hands.
"Papa, wouldn't like that."
*****
Natasha sighed.
“I would say it does. We have so little here. They can’t take where you come from. If they take your memories of it,” said Rune.
“You said that two hours,” said Jarvis.
January 5, 2016
“You look terrible,” said Bruce.
“Sure, it’s a bit of a walk, though,” said Steve.
January 1, 2016
“Yes!” Steve walked the little girl onto the dance floor. He let her stand on his toes as they danced.
Suddenly, the punching bag was flung across the room, taking a chunk of the ceiling with it. Papa collapsed, clutching his head; screaming as if he were trying to block out some non-existent sound. She should leave, but her feet were glued in place.
“I can't answer that," said Bruce.
“Every two to three hours for twenty to forty minutes sometimes longer,” said Steve.
“Sweetie pie, it’s time to wake up.”
"Shall we?" said Lena.
“Tell her yes before you lose your mind.”
Waddle - is a group of penguins on land.
Piper got to her feet, slowly moving each limb, reviewing the sensation brought by the movement.
Matt backed off. He’d forgotten how protective omegas could be over their alphas, even if they were complete assholes. Steve’s breathing calmed.
“But she pulled back together,” countered Tony.
"Are you free tomorrow?" he asked.
Drumming forced her attention from freeing Winter. A large troop wielding shields, blocking her in. She straightened her stance as her opponents drew closer, falling back on her training successfully. Metal doors rose from the ground. She screamed slamming herself against the wall, but she only succeeded in disorienting herself and leaving a large dent.
He wouldn’t call it that, rather a general observation. When someone moved toward them, Piper straightened up and smiled. He’d seen the behavior so many times in Steve. It was meant to be disarming, so the person would lose interest. It was unsettling to see it in a toddler.
Steve sunk back into the water.
“She’s right,” said Steve.
“I’m under strict orders not to tell anyone of your condition by Fury. Especially Stark,” said Phil.
"When they woke him he went into a feral rage. Killed the team working on him with his nothing but his bare hands. It took twenty men and two days to subdue him."
The armor wrapped around him. He lifted Steve from the floor and put him in bed. Tony made a nest around him.
“What are our instructions?”
Steve yawned. He kissed Tony. The taste of wine lingered on the alpha's lips. “You shouldn’t drink alone.”
“Do you want me to print it out?” asked Edith.
“I will be,” said Steve.
*****
“Pe.”
He flinched when he accidentally spun the mug off the counter. He hurried to pick up the pieces. Steve sighed.
“It measures galvanic skin response, oxygen consumption, micro-expressions, biofeedback, brainwaves, pupil dilation, voice biometrics. And ninety-six variables in all.”
"Stark, you know this will take a while."
“I didn’t do much better,” said Steve.
She flipped over the card. It was a three of spades.
“I can’t say. A psychiatrist may be able to give you further insight into it,” said Edith.
“I’m sure what you build will be perfect, but you don’t need me to tell you that,” said Piper.
Steve only brought him closer, borrowing closely to his chest. Tony sighed settling back down, earning a tired purr. He closed his eyes for a few minutes.
Steve swallowed a growl. Too many knew! None of them were his alpha. Now it was a fact in a mission. A handicap that may affect his performance. It was never supposed to be that.
"She won't come out until she's ready," said Rune. He stared up at the sky, admiring the stars. "Just let her figure it out."
“We’d wait however long it took for you to be comfortable. Or find a doctor you prefer,” said Edith.
“Put me down!”
“What’s wrong?”
Tony laughed.
Thor frowned. “You are perceptive, Captain. May ask why you care?”
Steve shoved his hand pocket. Out of habit he always kept some cash in whatever pants he was wearing in case he needed to make a quick escape. It was something he did during the war which he couldn't kick. Always having to be ready to move.
"Yeah."
She took Steve's hand and led him into the living room. They sat on the couch. Piper was starting to wake up. Steve took her out of the penguin jacket. She blinked a few times before squirming. Steve knew that look. She was seconds away was from crying.
"I believe we can operate this week," said Wu.
Steve shot backward, tumbling into a set of weights.
He needed to buy time. Tony lowered to the landing pad.
“Go ahead,” nodded Tony.
She put Stanley down.
“Stress can’t override a biological imperative, not if your body is capable following its will,” said Edith.
*****
“Want to try it out on the range?” asked Natasha.
"My location."
“What gives you the right to say who I am?! Everything you are isn’t even truly yours! You’d be nothing without the serum. Just some nobody from Brooklyn,” shouted Tony.
"At times like this, I hate you."
“What’s the first thing you remember from before you fainted?”
“I’ll make the call. Steve and I will want a full explanation of what you did find once pups are put to bed,” he said.
He got up from the couch and headed out onto the beach. Steve sat in the sand, digging his toe into the ground, enjoying how the sun felt against his skin. The last time he was out here he was with Tony. Those comforting arms were braced around him. He pulled his legs to his chest, whimpering. It was pointless his alpha wouldn’t respond to his calls. He spent hours watching the waves, before finally getting up. He went back to the mansion.
Steve groaned slowly, peeling himself from Stark Tower’s gym floor. It has become a habit, him waking up there. Working himself into exhaustion was the only way he could sleep. There was too much going on in Hell’s Kitchen for him to risk a trip to Fogwell’s gym.
"Steve?" said Pepper.
“Homeland Security, we good here,” she said.
"Wasn't my place. I doubt you would have dropped the subject even in the throes of heat."
“You want to see her?"
*****
The session ended an hour later on a peaceful note that didn't leave Steve's scent bitter. Steve went to his apartment. He kept in case he needed to stay over after a mission. Steve changed into his gym clothes. An afternoon run to burn off some of his excitement sounded like a good idea.
Tony climbed into the nearest car, speeding in the direction of the hospital. He pulled into the parking garage. The press hadn't shown up yet, but it was only a matter of time. He went to the front desk.
“You’ve lost your edge. That’s why he got away.”
Steve sighed when his phone ringed. It was Natasha. She would give him hell if he didn’t answer.
"When have you ever willing gotten out of bed before ten?"
“ALPHA!!”
“Safe to say. It’s happened far less frequently since I meant you,” he said.
Winter's eyes widened, backing away. She was fine a minute ago. What happened? He went to his corner letting her work through whatever she was experiencing. It took three hours for the episode to pass. She was now sleeping in the center of the room. He was in no rush to wake her. Dinner came at seventeen hundred hours. The pup was dozing, but by the time he finished his share she'd woken up completely. He pushed the tray toward her. She slid it back. He pushed it back toward her.
“It was a good match. And Phil got me a new bike,” he said.
“I can get there fastest,” said Tony.
“I wouldn’t call them masterpieces.”
“She was already examined for it. It was negative,” said Tony.
What kind of strange world was he living in? An army from space. It sounded like the plot to one of Tony’s old science fiction stories.
“Usual honey?” asked the waitress.
“Are these really necessary, Rumlow?” rattling her handcuffs. “You know my threat doesn’t lie in the physical. So why don’t you unlock these so we can have a civil conversation,” said Lena.
“Get my suit ready,” he said.
Steve timidly opened the door, smiling softly when he saw Piper tucked happily into her Daddy’s side.
“Happy birthday, Piper!” Rhodes handed her a wrapped present. She shook the box.
"Well congratulations," said Edith nervously.
“Correct.”
"I've done this for a long time, Piper." It had proven difficult to hold back his attack. Restraint wasn’t something he was used to during a fight.
“Hungry?” she asked.
Tony got what he needed from the kiss. Love was there. It hadn’t given him any answers to why Steve was like this.
"You don't have to stay with me, Tony. You can go work on your armor," said Steve.
Phil explained the new functions S.H.I.E.L.D added and the electric start. He easily started the engine. It purred loudly.
“No need,” said Tony.
“How sure of her guilt?” asked Steve.
“You ask deceptively hard questions, Winter,” she said.
From Malibu, Tony watched the live footage of Edith from Stark Tower. Everything seemed normal.
"You should have tried harder. He's your best friend for god sake!"
“We should get her home,” said Steve.
Steve relaxed, letting Tony wash him. Once clean and dressed he was more than willing to return to bed. He cuddled up with Piper. She cooed happily, pressing against him.
*****
“You should be thankful for them cleaning up this mess,” said Pepper.
“No.” Piper wouldn’t let Winter be demeaned like that.
“Steve?”
“Are there any cameras in here, Jarvis?”
“How are you going to explain not taking your bike back?” asked Natasha headed to the parking lot.
"Fine, I'll go. Bye Pepper."
“I thought it would have faded by the time you woke up.” Tony would never let him forget the day he made Captain America limp. His alpha was stared at him hungrily. “Why are you looking at me like that? It’s not like you haven’t seen me like this before."
Rune deeply breathed in the delicious smell filling the room. He licked his lips. "What's smells so good?"
"Not like these," said Tony.
"Let us do our work. You've helped him as much as you can," said the nurse.
“If you break him, you’ll face the full wrath of S.H.I.E.L.D,” said Fury.
Soon enough it was time for him to leave for his session with Dr. Turner. Piper was too busy playing with Natasha to notice him leaving.
"I'm sure they'd be happy for you."
"Jarvis, when Bruce wakes up tell him we left," said Tony.
That wasn’t the first line of questioning he was expecting. Normally, the first question someone asked when they first encountered him was how he was alive.
“After I feed her.”
“I will.”
It had been a month since Piper was born, and the couple had fallen into as much of a routine as a person could when dealing with a newborn. Steve yawned, stretching out in bed, smiling when he found Piper cuddled to his chest. Oddly enough, they were sleeping better since she was born. Steve ran his hand down her back. She was perfectly healthy and putting on weight steadily. There was a time when he believed he would never be capable of producing such a healthy beautiful pup. He frequently counted her fingers and toes, reassuring himself she was real. Her intelligence became more apparent. She was already making cute babbling noises. They constantly had to find new toys for her that would challenge her. Once she thoroughly figured out a toy, she lost all interest in it and it would be donated. The only exceptions were the platypus lovey and wheeled giraffe Bruce gave her.
“A ring. He wants to marry me,” said Steve.
“Yet it feels like I’ve known you for years. You can’t say you didn’t feel a connection when we first touched,” said Steve.
“That’s more than most parents of missing children have.”
“Steve?”
She stiffened. It had been months since she heard the kind of tone mimicked that of her parents. It wasn’t angry. He was disappointed. But she couldn’t tell him about what.
He'd slept soundly through the night. Tony’s warm breath tickled his neck. Had the simple fact of knowing that an alpha he trusts was there for him to help him through the night been enough to hold back the memories of the past? It allowed him to sleep in an actual bed instead of the floor. How could his presence do so much for him? Steve fell back into the warm comfort of the bed. His eyes began to close. Only to be force open by the sound of his phone ringing. Tony grumbled behind him. Whatever time it was, it was too damn early for human communication! Despite this, he grabbed his phone, knowing whoever was calling was unlikely to leave him be. He didn’t bother checking the name.
“Can’t sleep.”
“And what happened?” asked Tony.
"You said you were no nauseous were there any other signs to make you believe you were pregnant?" asked Edith.
"Sorry, I'll go sleep on the couch," said Steve. He threw off the blanket.
“I won’t." Tony relaxed.
“GOD DAMN IT!!" Steve grabbed the couch, tossing it across the room. "Egotistical jackass!"
“Rune your with me,” said Maria. He reached up for her to pick him up. Rune was approaching the age where he was getting to big to be held, but she couldn’t resist.
*****
"I don't think it will be as boring as we think," said Piper.
“Jackie Falco.”
“There’s plenty to be ashamed of,” he said. He hung his head. Steve never had confidence in his appearance, even now. Especially now. At least before, he was what was expected of an omega.
While in the frozen food aisle a kid ran up to him and hugged him. He stood motionless for a bit, unsure of what to do. This never happened before. Most kids were intimidated by him especially omega pups like this one. The little boy had a mop of messy brown hair and big brown doe eyes. The kid looked seven or eight years old.
"I'll try."
“I will have to carry you if we are to make it in time,” he said.
“What’s wrong with the penthouse?” asked Tony.
Clint put a hand on her shoulder, gently pulling her back. "We've done what we can."
"Tony?"
"Sure, it wasn't."
“Love you,” said Steve.
“Are you going to tell me why?” asked Natasha.
He scooped her up into his human arm, then put her down in the corner. The chemical stench was agitating him. The cell no longer smelled like his territory. He rubbed himself against the walls, trying to make it smell more like his own. He returned to the corner, taking the pup in his arms again. Winter cradled her to his chest. His scent had to better than bleach.
“There’s no avoiding stress. Not in my life,” said Tony.
“Too cold?”
Tony’s scent was intoxicating luring him further into a lustful wanting state. Steve became lost in Tony’s touch. His knees grew weak as those callused hands worked him perfectly. They sank to the floor. He spread his legs letting Tony rest his between them. Steve dropped his head back, baring his neck submissively. He looked up at his alpha through his eyelashes. A desperate want for his alpha filled him. Steve raised his hips and whined.
“Gave me a lot to think about,” said Tony.
“Happy’s number. Give him a call. He’ll take you wherever you want. I’ll make sure he’ll bring you some clothes and shoes,” said Tony. He flew out the window.
An earthy clove scent touched Steve's senses. He moved his hand from his stomach.
“Can we go back now?”
His ex and mate being friends was nerve-wracking at times.
"I love you," said Steve.
"It's ten in the morning. Is there a reason for this current mood?" he asked.
“Mistletoe,” said Steve.
“You think Fury is hiding something,” said Steve.
Steve smiled and brought her to his chest. A peaceful aura surrounded them. From there, it was easy to fall asleep.
“Right away, Little Miss.”
“I can’t tell you that, sir. The doctor hasn’t finished yet.”
“Part of you wants me here,” said Tony.
Steve was perfectly calm while he worked. It was Tony's constant gaze that was distracting. Everything was normal. Bruce easily drew blood and collected a skin sample.
He would have to tighten up security. Maybe buy a house somewhere out of the way to give his family some well-deserved privacy. It would be good for her to have a yard to run around in. Rebuilding in Malibu wasn't an option. Neither of them would feel safe there after what happened. He would have Jarvis look around.
He reached his hand out her, shocked when he felt her tiny hand wrap around his fingers. Papa pulled her close. He put her on the deck first before climbing out himself. They were both covered in mud and stunk of distress.
"Is it morning?" she asked.
Piper ran ahead of George when she saw them. Steve quickly caught her, holding her close.
"How else will you get there? Besides, I want to," said Tony.
"Wake up," said Steve playfully nudging Tony awake.
*****
“What’s there to explain?! For the longest time, I thought Howard’s feelings were one-sided but apparently they were shared. Don’t lie to me and say they weren’t!” growled Tony.
Piper glanced up to Papa to make sure it was okay. He nodded.
"Oh." Steve purred.
She pointed to a drawer.
“30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?” said Fury.
“Better now."
Steve sighed, fully satisfied at the moment. They were still knotted. Alpha’s hips were rocking gently into him, bringing him into a lazy orgasm. Pleasure gently swept over him. Alpha pulled out slowly. They remained huddled closely together. He purred as Alpha’s tongue ran over his neck. A heavenly haze set up on his mind. All his strength vanished, trusting his protection fully to the man beside him. He never wanted to leave this place. The night continued in a heated passion, leaving little or no time for sleep.
Steve bit his lip. Telling Tony about Kate would bring out the alpha tone again.
“I’d start with something simple like a goldfish."
“How’s your pain level?” said Edith.
“Does she know?” asked Steve.
“Teeth, Piper,”
*****
He took a pen from the counter and placed it in the palm of her hand. She grabbed it. When he tried taking it away he was met by unexpected resistance. She grew fussy and threw the pen across the room. It lodged in the wall.
“You’ve only been out of the ice a day. My diagnosis will take a few days,” said Barny.
“And she will recover. Though she may be in the medical wing for a few days. Remember your place Winter.”
“I never leave an omega unsatisfied,” said Tony.
“We don’t have to go,” said Tony.
Steve fell asleep. Omegas slept through most of their preheat. The tall man curled up in the corner of the couch.
"NASA will be a lot more careful," said Bruce.
She gently took his metal hand. He pulled his hand away from her. Winter mainly used his real arm when dealing with the pup. Afraid that weapon molded to him may accidentally harm her.
“Piper.”
Steve groaned. “Tell Tony to call me when he lands."
“Goodnight Theodore.”
“Jarvis, where is he?”
"Make her sign a non-disclosure agreement before seeing Piper and Rune," said Bruce.
"You mean, you'll talk to him."
“You are?”
“No, I want it back the way it was,” cried Piper, stamping her foot.
Rune gave it a try.
"Steve, we're here."
Steve leaned against the car door, letting the wind hit his face. By the time they got home his slick had soaked through his pants and wetted the leather seat of the car. Tony was growling deeply. The scent of the alpha’s arousal sunk into his sense. Those deep brown eyes had gone wild with lust. Steve purred. He quivered with anticipation.
“Ask him, genius,” she said.
“Not that,” he said.
“Now the trainees will stop flirting with me,” said Steve.
Steve smiled, pressing further into the alpha comforting embrace. "Can we go home?"
Winter left for Smith's flat. Perched out was a camera. He opened the door a crack on arrival. Catching the tripwire set at the door, he stepped over it. It was tied to a grenade. Winter found and removed all of Smith’s hidden weapons. All he had to do was wait for his prey. The door finally opened a couple of hours later. Winter's senses came alive.
The bear reared onto its hind leg, roaring. With its massive paw, it swatted him effortlessly through a large tree. Steve charged at the bear, hitting its flank at full speed, sending it to its side. Its jaws locked around on his shield, the leather straps couldn’t take the stress and ripped. His shield was flung away. The bear squared off with him. Its glowing green eyes focused on him. A mixture of blood and drool oozed from its mouth. It reared up onto its hindquarters, snarling. Steve jumped for the beast’s neck. Its claws sunk into his back, tearing at his flesh. He climbed to the head of the beast. His legs clung around the bear’s neck. The bear tried throwing him with no success. It fell onto its back, in an attempt to crush him. Over thirteen thousand pounds of muscle landed on him. Steve grunted. One arm kept the bear pinned. He grabbed a grenade from his belt and forced it into the beast's mouth. Steve clamped the bear’s muzzle shut. There was an explosion as the bear’s stomach blew out. It went limp. Steve went to help his team. They’d been tossed around like rag dolls. He ran for his shield, tossing it at the bear nearest Natasha.
Lena came into the room. Piper instantly moved closer to Winter. He gently patted her head.
“That’s how you greet your boyfriend after he’s had a long day?” said Steve, draping his arms around Tony’s shoulders. He nuzzled against Tony's neck, taking a deep breath of Tony's earthy, metallic clove scent. Tony reached over, carding his fingers through Steve's hair.
Steve growled lowly.
Tony nuzzled his neck easing him into sleep.
Her stomach growled. Sir pulled his hand away from the chalkboard.
Steve cut the line. It went better than he thought. Steve changed. He packed a small bag not knowing what conditions he would encounter. Steve took his shield from its place by the bed. He returned to the living room. Nat was flipping through the channels.
Steve bit his lip. He’d never slept over at an alpha’s place when not in heat. His mother taught him it was improper to do such a thing.
“Because we need break from this pain. If only for a few hours. When we’re together there’s nothing but you and me.”
“Okay.”
“Feel free to look around,” she said.
“Didn’t really go his way did it,” he said.
“I want to spend it in Malibu. It's more private there,” he said. At least there they had acres of private property.
"I love both of you. I don't know how I survived before the two of you," said Tony.
"Same place different position. What’s with alpha? Didn’t you as someone to ever settle down.”
Piper woke up first. She let out a gasping cry of pain. It hurt to breathe. Everything hurt. This kind was a new kind of ache. She had nothing to compare it too. What happened to make her feel this way? Piper cried and whimpered, not caring who heard.
“It also means more people getting hurt,” said Steve.
“Calm down, Edith.”
“Thanks for the warning, Nat.”
"I can do that out of bed. And there's something I have to do," said Steve.
“Turn on the shower for me,” he said.
“Winter.”
“Don’t be.”
“Dr. Banner is pulling into the driveway,” said Jarvis.
“He made it personal,” said Tony.
She silently stepped into the room, bag in hand. The woman was dressed in sweatpants and an old sweater.
“Papa loves you he’s just having a bad day."
It took a few rings for him to pick up the phone. The alpha’s sleepy image appeared before him.
"They were Nazis. Who tried taking Steve away from me. Use him as experimental material," said Tony.
“What about our clothes and I don’t have a passport?” asked Steve.
“Tell me when he wakes up,” said Tony.
“I enjoyed speaking with you,” said Steve.
“Look, I’m not one to talk. I’m making friends in Pakistan.”
“Thank you, Nat.”
“Steve?”
Steve emerged from his cramped shelter. He got his feet, searching for any danger. Steve clawed angrily at Alpha’s armor. Off, he needed it off! The mask came away. He nuzzled him. Alpha pulled away again. A loud, high-pitched whine left him, begging him to stay.
“Why would tell them they already know?” said Rune pointing to the camera position in the corner of the ceiling.
“How does it look?” asked Steve.
“I…I can’t remember.”
Fleur came over.
“Well, I love being handed things,” said Steve, taking it from Phil and switching it out with Tony’s glass. Tony rolled his eyes and sighed.
“Because of our friendship, the government decided to make me your babysitter,” he said.
“There is no excuse for how I acted. I needed to figure something out,” said Steve without preamble.
“Sorry, did I wake you?” asked Steve.
Steve sighed. He sympathized with Tony. The alpha seemed to be looking for any excuse to strike out against the Mandarin. "How do you know that?"
“Shut up," said Steve.
“Fine.”
“Rune.”
Rhodes choked on his drink.
Helmut never mentioned that when he talked about her over the phone. Why was she working at some child's playground? She was sure a rich husband or even wife would happily take her as a mistress and treat her wonderfully.
“You like this?”
“What questionable about electricity? It’s my suit. I can’t. I’m not gonna. Oh, god."
"There's nothing to discuss," said Steve. Barny's stern gaze locked on him. “You won’t leave that alone, will you."
"Good, now spread your legs and keep your knees bent for me. Mr. Stark, I want you to sit behind him so he can brace against you," she said.
“Is this forehead of security?”
“I’m not sure what else you have planned for today, but I could make you dinner,” said Steve. His mom taught him the fastest way to an alpha’s heart was through their stomach. It should apply to the genius inventor. Steve tensed when he didn’t get a response right away.
Steve's inner omega cringed at the idea of spending hours with alpha with wasn’t his mate while in heat, but with Clint’s help, they could leave sooner. “It’s fine."
Tony nodded.
His shoulders sagged. Steve was right. They couldn't lose their baby.
*****
“Steve.”
“Now there’s that guy,” said Tony, getting up.
When the song ended, he was laughing, remembering the time he'd walked in on Tony singing and dancing to ACDC's Highway to Hell. The moment was ruined by cramping spreading through his core. He took a breath, pushing through to discomfort to work on breakfast. Steve tossed the pans into the sink, fully intending to clean them at some point today. He sat at the counter poking his stack of pancakes with a fork. Steve made himself eat. Once done he settled on the couch. A show called Too Cute was on. He almost changed, but then saw the newborn puppies. With his nurturing instincts already in overdrive, he was hooked after only a few seconds. All those soft whines and whimpers were reaching out to his inner omega. By the end of it, he was hugging a pillow to his chest. Steve threw away the pillow.
“Don’t.”
“Tony." He gently nudged him awake. The alpha’s eyes shot open. He was panicked.
"I'm okay," he repeated. Steve tucked himself under the blanket, hiding from view.
“Find Through the Looking Glass and give it a pull,” said Jarvis.
“No.”
“Yes, and I’m his doctor. He comes first,” said Star before disappearing back into the medical bay.
“I know.” Carl smiled and nodded. “Can you tell me about the chinstrap penguins?”
“Have you ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?”
“It's kinda hard to have a good conversation when I’m strapped to the bed,” said Piper.
Piper opened the iPad. She looked through the apps. There many weird programs, among them a lip-reading app. She paused on the sign language icon. It could be interesting, she shrugged to herself.
“Don’t do this.” Steve had been through so much. Both parents had. Tony was the one picking up the pieces.
“Smell anything?” he asked.
"Yes, thanks. Things are clearer now."
“I’m not the same as before,” she said. She doubted she ever could be. Thinking about it was confusing.
“Not sure. What does it feel like? I know what it looks like.” He thought he was gaining further understanding of the emotion. Winter only wanted her to confirm it.
“I don’t think Lady Jane would appreciate such an event. Why are you only celebrating the new union and not-
“Happy to help.”
The pups slept the entire drive. Howard’s mansion came into view. It’s not Howard’s anymore, Tony mentally corrected himself. Now, it was their temporary home, until things settled down. The front gates opened to greet them. Tony went to the backdoor, unstrapping Piper from the car seat. He carefully picked her up and she clung to him, cuddling to his chest.
“But I already had you and Piper.”
"No." Winter was right it was better for her to have control over it than them. It had to be hers.
“I don’t know why you have such animosity toward me, Mr. Stark. I don’t enjoy this alpha posturing,” said Edith.
“Thank you, sir.”
“That’s fine.”
Happy dropped the groceries on the floor and left for the elevator. He wasn’t expecting to see Rogers again.
“Love you too,” said Tony.
“There’s no need for concern. Piper is with Rune,” assured Jarvis’s calm, logical, tone.
"Until things settle, you are the child's temporary guardian. I will take lead from this point forward," said Fury.
“Sir, you seemed to be suffering from Broken Heart Syndrome. All you can do is try and wait it through."
“Jarvis?”
The went to the lobby. The fossilized remains of dinosaurs were perfectly out place in the marble and high arched ceilings of the museums.
She was right, but Steve never wanted a big wedding. Unlike most omegas, he hadn't put much time into dreaming of his wedding day. It was always made him feel bitter. But now he could.
“Leave her,” said a female voice over the radio.
They might have their daughter back today.
He leaned back into the leather seat of the car. Tony sighed deeply. He hadn’t gone to his parents’ funeral; instead, he got blackout drunk.
"I'm fine. How is he?"
“He killed himself.”
Tony’s hand fisted. He took a breath unclenching his hands.
“She’s not ready to face those vultures!” growled Steve.
“It’s nice to meet you, Rune.”
“What? You have to admit it’s funny.
Steve took off his shirt, laying back. He flinched as the cool gel was squirted onto his stomach. Edith turned the image. Unlike the ultrasound, Steve could see the developing face of his child.
She laughed. “You don’t know what happen the last time we did that. Otherwise, you wouldn't have made that suggestion."
“It’s better than the Dorito cravings. I will never eat another one,” he said.
"What are parents?" Rune added, curious.
Her tears made him uncomfortable, but he didn’t regret not telling her the full extent of her actions.
“You know about Doris,” said Steve.
“Okay.”
“Piper, you need to speak with me,” said Lena.
“They could be using you as a carrier to spread whatever was in that dart to others,” said Natasha.
“Chocolate milk.”
Steve laughed.
"Feel like talking?" The man scowled at him. "So, no."
“Deputy get this woman-
She sighed sadly. "You're like him."
“Our final destination,” said Tony.
"It feels like one."
“I want to come,” said Steve.
“I’m having a hard time trusting S.H.I.E.L.D. after this mess,” said Tony.
“He’s out,” said Tony.
“Where are they?”
“No.”
“Your thanks is enough,” he said.
Piper turned her head to the side, smiling when she saw a familiar form sitting in the chair near her bed. But, as her vision cleared, she whimpered. His face was swollen and bruised. His wounds were untreated. Why hadn't they healed Winter?
“I should say this sooner, but I’m sorry,” she said.
“Steve is an improvement over that Pepper. You two were never a good match. What kind of parent names their child after table spice,” said Peggy.
Killian stepped in front of him. Those flaming orange eyes glared down out him. Steve did not break the stare.
“He tried to bash his own head in. I don’t call that handled!”
“What caused it?" asked Tony.
"Do want me to let him?" asked Jarvis.
“He’s a Hydra operative. I've encountered him before. Over the decades he's been off and on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar. We only theorized he may be like you. Him going toe to toe with you on an equal level only furthers supports this belief. He may have been the sniper that deactivated your birth control," she said.
Tony led him to the birthing room, carefully lowering him to bed.
“Twenty-three days?” It had felt so much
"When you were having a panic attack about my eyes, and it was too much for you to look into them and see Piper looking back."
“She won’t give in to our ways easily," cautioned Lena.
“It’s only unneeded stress.
*****
December 26, 2012
Bruce nodded.
“No, they’ll think he broke it off.”
“Beautiful,” said Steve.
Tony sat next to him. Steve pulled his head from the toilet. Tony offered him water, he managed a few sips.
“Don’t worry, sir, she’s with Bruce,” said Jarvis.
"We'll have to go in through the front door, but I can get there unseen."
“You were right about Killian along, Happy.”
"I said idiotic," said Steve.
“The train where I lost Bucky. I can't get out of my head,” he said.
Tony working again didn't bother him. Since the alpha was his own boss he could work whenever for as long as he wanted. Every few hours he would come up and check on him and Piper.
“Alpha.”
Fury came out of the shadows.
Steve took a pencil from the table. Piper had difficulty spelling. She spelled phonetically. She also had trouble with b and d, using them interchangeably. Years of reading Howard and Tony's handwriting made translating her jumbled words simple. She looked over his shoulder watching his corrections before he handed it back to her.
“When do I need to be there?”
Rune smiled, liking how the beta said his name. It was a gentle caring tone. "Okay."
“There’s been a delay,” he said.
“A doctor is going to come tomorrow.”
"I'd kill for some armor right now," said Rhodes.
“I could have killed him.”
“I’ll see if there’s anything we can use you for.”
She got up only managing a few steps, before becoming dizzy and collapsing. Piper whined, unable to get up. Her tummy turned uncomfortably and the room spun. She threw up. Theodore kneeled next running his hand down her back. She whimpered.
“Tony!" yelled Steve.
“When I have nightmares it helps to have a good memory I can actually grab onto. Having it under the bed makes easy to access,” said Steve.
“I’m looping the footage from the playground. So, he still thinks we’re there. He doesn’t even know we’re here,” said Piper.
“Yep,” asked Piper.
“Morning sickness?”
“It puts a light on things.”
"I won't ask you what happened up there. Tell me when you're ready."
Steve pecked Tony on the cheek, then went to greet the beta. “Phil, come in.”
“We've searched a city of 1.629 million. We can find one man. I already have Jarvis looking. It won’t take long,” Tony said. Though, even an hour more was too long.
“You have an interesting taste in style, Pipes,”
“Let’s vanish,” said Fury.
“Matt, I can’t thank you enough for what you've done for me,” said Steve.
It was the right answer, but it the answer Steve needed. He ran his fingers through Steve's hair.
“Maybe something with Tony,” said Steve. He didn’t really think on the sentence. It felt natural spending the holiday with him. Tony would probably have some kind of important event to go to. He didn’t want to get in the way of the alpha’s business.
Tony nodded.
Their pace slowed, barely missing several pitfall traps with spiked barbs. The space was too large for the average person to jump.
He leaned back in his chair but didn't close his eyes.
“You’ve been through a trauma. Yes, you found love during the war unlike some soldiers but that doesn’t mean they wouldn’t want you to have a second chance. Everyone who knows you are overjoyed that you’re here with us today. Sergeant Barnes would be happy that you are thriving now,” said Barny.
"Any ideas on a name?" asked Tony.
“It’s for your own good, sir. You haven’t eaten since breakfast,” said Jarvis.
MIA was printed on the corner of one of the pages. He closed the folder.
“She was then Steve left for work.”
“I need you to drawl his arm. Can you do that?” asked Tony.
"A three-year-old that was trained to be an assassin. She's not as much of a child as she used to be," said Tony.
“There’s the alpha. I need Stark. Don’t you want to help your mate?”
“I was always careful in that aspect of my life,” he said.
Steve watched as Tony examined each of his paintings. He played with his fingers waiting for a response. If they were bad he wished the alpha would just get it over with and tell him so.
“What the hell was that?! Why is Hydra attacking my house?!” yelled Tony.
“She’s a super-soldier. Why would she need it?” he asked.
"I haven't put him through anything. Your misbehavior is solely responsible for his pain.”
Pierce nodded.
“I would never hurt him.”
“This is amazing! You should really enjoy the moment,” said Steve. He wanted to extend this moment as long as possible. It was only a matter of time before it was ruined by S.H.I.E.L.D visiting.
, she prayed.
“I will.”
She giggled. “Jerk.”
To keep his mind busy he started drawing. He drew several portraits of Natasha.
“Can’t help you there. No one ever got close enough to knock it off.”
Steve chuckled. The alpha got up from the couch. “Tony?”
Steve carefully lifted Piper from the ground, breathing in her scent. This was real. He grabbed Tony's arm.
He braced himself against the counter.
“Sold fruit?”
“Shit, Steve."
She jolted upright when he slammed a ruler against her desk.
Steve watched Tony move around the room.
“Yes, just let him work through it,” said Rhodes.
“She’s not ready,” said Natasha.
"A majority of the time. I came out of it for an hour on the second day."
“Then you can home with me.”
"Dr. Erskine's notes," said Bruce.
"I doubt the U.S. will have to unify together against England for a fight against independence again."
“You want to know what I see, handsome?” said Tony raising his chin.
“Do you have any questions for me?”
Steve huddled close to him. The omega was still crying. Tony tried soothing them away.
“Tony.”
A soft non-threatening noise forced his attention; the pup was baring her teeth. She met his gaze. Her blue eyes pulled at something unknown inside him. The intense, yet gentle gaze elicited a level of familiarity from the usual blankness of his mind. Winter’s head spun and he fought the temptation to slam his skull into the wall and knock himself out. Winter clutched his head. He needed it to stop.
“Then, you understand why I can’t accept,” said Steve.
“Piper didn’t respond well to her.” That was putting it nicely.
Piper shrugged. "I guess before I would have, but I got used to it. Winter had a horrible time. Papa has you to help him calm him down. Winter is all alone with no to help him with his nightmares."
Tony's heart ached. The life of his mate was in the hands of another. He wanted to be with him. Steve would want him to stay with their daughter. Whatever his worries were he had to save them for another time. The room felt too large. He was alone with his daughter. Her small delicate form was huddled against his chest. Those newly opened blue eyes gazed up at him. They held such a deep fascination, unaware of the turmoil he was forced to endure by being here. Her head fit in his palm. He sired this perfect being. She stole his breath in the most amazing way. Nothing he'd ever created would compare to her. Her tiny hand wrapped around his finger. Tear sprung from his eyes. He kissed her softly on the forehead.
“Don’t,” he said.
“Not even you,” said George.
“Could you use your arrows?”
He and Tony hadn't labeled it.
“No.”
“Jarvis."
“You’re too nice. I don’t have that issue,” said Natasha.
A suit was lying on the couch. Steve sighed.
Piper couldn't tell if he was lying.
“Thank you, Peggy,” said Steve.
Tony was a godsend. He’d make breakfast for him, changed Piper, and made sure he was comfortable. Tony earned some rest. Steve put her in a fresh diaper and onesie. He went into the kitchen and put her down in a playpen. His stomach growled. He cracked several eggs into the bowl. Piper wailed, instantly quieting when he picked her up. He sighed Tony could take over breakfast when he woke up. Steve grabbed a protein bar from the cabinet before settling down on the couch.
"You didn't tell her."
Bloom sighed. Piper wasn't connecting with her. The pup was suspicious of her from the start. Maybe George would have better luck getting through her.
“Only one more day,” said Tony.
“Like it or not you’ll be forced to work with people like him. You’ll be expected to treat them like anyone else,” said Steve.
*****
Tony pushed against the blade with all his strength
The slight motion of getting up made him go lightheaded. Someone caught him, putting him back in his seat. Natasha stood in front of him.
“Tony?”
Steve nodded. They walked down the aisle military members stood attention saluting him. There were six, two from each branch. All the eyes were focused on him. When he saw his mate at the other end aisle.
“Intelligent and humble. Someone who doesn’t see me as a monster,” she said.
He snorted. "Whatever miraculous fabric it's made of isn't meant to stretch that far."
“Four hours, if he wakes up try to getting moving. It will help him dilate and move the baby's head into position," said Edith.
“Do I want to know what state they're in?” asked Fury.
"You should have told me."
"Sure, sweetheart."
They tackled each other. Their arms locked. Steve’s was stunned at the man’s strength it. It was equal to his. How long would his strength last? Their closeness allowed him to take in his attacker scent.
“I can't believe you're settling down before me," said Rhodes.
He nodded.
“Send it to Banner as well,” he said.
“We are not soldiers! I’m not marching to Fury’s fife,” said Tony.
"Yes," said Steve.
The appalling sound of the beta's neck breaking replayed in Piper’s mind. She accidentally saw a person getting beheaded when her parents were watching their grown-up show. That was fake. This was real. She'd seen the life fade from his eyes. The beta deserved it but Piper felt guilty. The panic and sadness proved too much for her to handle. It transformed to rage.
“Morning." Matt emerged from his room.
“You say that as if you know what they’re going through.”
“Fine,”
"Tony."
"You can," he said.
She nodded. He pulled it open. It was filled with headbands and hats. He took out several, holding up different options. She pointed to an orange one lined with small orange flowers.
He met his gaze but he didn’t seem to be there.
A week later Steve woke at four in the morning to leave for the mission. His bag was already packed and ready to go. Tony and Piper were asleep. He glanced back at the bed. Piper was tucked securely in Tony's arms. He returned to bed and kissed them both.
"Nice to meet you too," he said.
The way his teeth dug into his neck was perfect.
Tony huffed.
“I assume you want this off the record,” said Edith.
Tony wandered off. As soon as he left Piper started pouting.
Steve relaxed.
Winter jolted, tossing her from his chest. The pup was curled in a tight ball, her hands covered ears.
“There’s only one God, Nat. And I’m pretty sure he doesn’t dress like that,” said Steve.
Tony glared at him. Behind the anger was pain.
"Nothing could keep me away." Tony leaned forward kissing Steve on the temple. “Do you need anything?”
They discussed the plans for the announcement and the finishing touches. It wouldn’t take long but it was apparent she’d lost Tony. The alpha kept glancing back in the direction of the studio.
Her grip remained firm when he tried yanking it from her. She didn't even stumble in her stance.
*****
“Sorry." She glared at him. It was obvious she hadn’t lost her grudge from this morning. “Whatever you have to say, Kate, say it now."
“What will you name her?” asked Phil.
“What were you dreaming of?” asked Tony.
He had to prove that he wasn’t an omega insane with grief. Her posture changed as the message played.
“No.”
“Why?!”
“Where?”
“Alpha." His voice shaken.
His weapons deployed as he forced his way through the worm, exiting at the opposite end. Tony was thrown, landing on a taxi.  He got to his feet only to be shot back. Alien troops marched toward him weapons drawn.
“Shit, Rhodes, I’m not fit to be a father,” said Tony, rubbing his temples.
Tony’s heart raced. He was so genuine. Tony caressed Steve’s cheek. Steve leaned into his touch. He’s so perfect.
“I want to perform an x-ray to see if there’s been any movement of the shrapnel,” said Wu.
“You make me forget, Tony. I find myself forgetting some of the darkest parts of my past."
“Good.”
“For the time being. I need time to absorb this. And there's telling, Tony."
“You wouldn’t want me anymore,” she whispered clicking out of the network.
“Will Pepper approve of you replacing part of her collection with some unknown artist?” asked Rhodes.
“Including Chad Davis?" asked Tony.
He followed the alpha to the elevator his curiosity getting the best of him.
They went back to their hotel. Steve toed off his shoes and got into bed. He groaned unable to find a comfortable position.
"I don't know. Bloom said it could take some time," said Steve. Tony tapped tapping his fingers nervously against the counter.
He pressed snow against his face. The stinging cold sensation gave him something focus on until he was brought back to a better state of mind. He threw the snow at Harley.
"Fine," said Steve reluctantly. "Where are we going?"
“What?”
“What do you want?” asked Tony.
She flinched noticeably when he brought out a larger knife, taking a few unwarranted steps back. The black, serrated edge of the blade glinted in the artificial light. Piper whimpered.
"You have to be cleared by medical before you can go on assignment."
“What’s your status?” he asked.
“Alright, I get the hint,” said Happy.
“I apologize I did not mean to insult your independence it's a feature I find attractive in omegas. It's a tradition in Asgard for an alpha of any standing to ask for the honor of dancing with the alpha’s mate. Anyone who wishes to dance with the omega's alpha must ask. Why wouldn’t you want to share such wondrous news?” said Thor.
Steve sniffled, calming only slightly. Then he felt it. A thump against his stomach. He purred loudly, running his hand over his stomach. It was such a miraculous feeling of relief.
The glass wall sealed behind them. He put Piper on the mattress pulling the blanket over her. She should sleep for the rest of the day. When dinner came, he gently nudged her awake.
"I don't want this to become a science experiment," said Steve.
"It's fine with me. James Something Stark," said Tony.
Matt retired to his room. Steve took the blankets and pillows from the couch. He stared up at the ceiling. Thinking of Tony made his chest ache and tears well in his eyes. No, he didn’t want to cry anymore, but he couldn’t stop them from falling. What was wrong with him? Steve spent most of his night thinking.
“What?”
“Or just good aim. You were awake when you fell,” he said.
“What’s that?”
Steve climbed into bed with him, bringing him close.  The omega’s skin smelled of lavender oil, which complemented his scent perfectly.
"This goes against every omega instinct."
Now that the pup was free of distraction, it didn’t Lena long to repeat the process she’d begun during her first session with the child. She activated the child.
“Dr. Hounsfield,” he muttered.
June 9, 2012
“How’s the reactor, Jarvis?” asked Tony.
“People always believe alpha are the violent ones,” said Clint.
“You have too much to risk by revealing this. Dr. Erskine was forced into his line of research by Hitler. They wanted an inexpensive way of producing super soldiers. Erskine believed an omega; if it survived the procedure, it would be able to do this. Hilter didn't want to risk giving an omega that kind of power.”
Steve leaned into his touch. The fear melting from his expression. Those blue eyes slowly fluttered open. He smiled sleepily.
“Yes.”
The doctors finally permitted them to leave the hospital. Tony struggled with buttons of his shirt, impatient.
"Eight tonight."
“Very,” said Tony.
“Look at me, Tony!”
“Thanks,” he said.
“What?”
“Not that kind of miss.”
“A Glock 26 my personal weapon of choice. Doesn’t overdo it. The balance is perfect,” said Natasha.
“In the neighboring guest bedroom. She had an accident,” said Jarvis.
“It’s 2:30 the morning, December 11, 2011,” said Tony.
"Steve?"
“January twelfth,” said Steve.
"That answers why he's here." That was likely only a small fraction of what he could do.
“Tony, what do you survive on?” asked Steve.
“Get out of that suit. You’ve worked nonstop for days and need to shower,” said Steve.
“Keep it down.” He could not let this guy blow his cover.
“Alpha.”
She shook her head. Papa had never spoken to her about this.
“What else besides the physical features?” asked Tony.
She nodded.
“Steve, you’re my omega."
"I'm terrified," he said.
Lena chose that moment to enter their room, checking their vitals. She took several samples from them for procedural sake. Lena doubted that they'd reveal anything new. The two would likely sleep the rest of the day.
Steve had no idea where it came from. "Yes, was it successful."
“No, Steve it wasn’t you’re fault."
She whined. Papa would let her sit in his lap when Uncle Bruce took her blood. Piper forced back her tears. It was only a needle.
"Do you want daddy or I to ride in the back with you and Rune?" asked Steve. He caught the conflict in her eyes. Her expressions were very much like her father's when she was trying to bottle something up.
June 16, 2016
“I know you, big softy.”
Steve’s shoulders sagged in relief. Even, after all, he’d gone through his baby was perfectly protected inside him.
Steve was forced to focus in his reverie.
"Why didn't you redirect me? Why the fuck would I want to come here?"
“Now.”
*****
“Did she give you any trouble?” asked Steve.
There was a pixelated photo of him and Steve on. Steve’s face couldn’t be seen.
“Get on my back.”
"No."
“You’re helpless without me,” said Jarvis.
"Yes."
Bruce rubbed his temples trying not to be annoyed by the man in front of him. Thor reached his hammer to sky charging himself with lighting.  Thor caught him in his arms.
“You only dilated a half-centimeter since I last checked. If it continues to follow this pattern you’ll have seven hours left in your active labor.”
“You hit me.”
“Steve Rogers, miss,” he said.
“The postpartum depression is temporary. I wish I could say it was the same for the rest. There will be good times and bad. There's no magic pill. But I can give you the tool to manage it. Steve, I want to meet with you twice a week more if needed."
“What could have been,” said Steve.
Piper poked at her food. She hated her new green and white flowered room. The door opened.
“Tony,” he purred.
“Tony, you wouldn’t want to be near me last night,” said Steve.
“Steve, the system of omega alpha pairing only allows an omega to pair with the same alpha three times. Otherwise, things get complicated. The couple is tied. It becomes challenging to untie that knot. Pardon my phrasing."
"Why?"
They went to the medical floor.
“I wouldn’t have to give it so often if you listened," she said.
They crossed a glass bridge from the parking garage into the building. It was smaller than he thought for such a highly rated hospital.
The front door burst open. He threw his shield.
“Three years ago, I was kidnapped while presenting my new Jericho missile in Afghanistan for the military. On the return convey, we were attacked. I was the only survivor. One of them was just a kid." Steve squeezed his hand.
She was hesitant to touch. This was cybernetic technology. She knew enough to recognize it, but that’s as far as it went. The issue was a simple fix. The alpha was clenched and unclenched his hand.
"Drawing," said Rune.
“I don’t care."
*****
He wouldn’t mind being held by those. Steve couldn’t pick out the word to describe him. Everything about him screamed alpha.
Steve allowed Tony to lead him away from the bedroom. Tony opened the door of the guest bedroom. It had been converted into a studio. It was perfect. His old paintings were neatly shelved and everything was where it should be.
“How long has he been it?”
“Why didn’t we know of such a place sooner?”
“Where are you going?” asked Happy.
“You fell asleep in your suit again.”
“Piper.”
"I have to make a call," he said. Tony nodded. Steve went out to the deck. A warm breeze hit his face. Natasha first.
“I’ll take care of you." Tony didn’t want to know of Steve’s first hellish experience. He wanted nothing more than to pleasure Steve. “If, at any point, you feel uncomfortable, tell me."
“You didn’t let me finish. Only if Winter comes, too."
"No one looks for a dead man, Steve. You'll be fine. There will be too much going for anyone to notice you," said Tony.
“I prefer strawberry,” said Steve with a shrug.
“You’re lying now.”
They shook their heads.
“Thank you, sir.”
“What happened?” she hissed.
“I’m not ready for a family,” said Tony.
“What’s that thing on your chest?”
“She isn’t Tony.”
“I want to see this."
“It isn’t only the weight of his parent’s death. He chooses that day to let out all the guilt and negativity that's built over the year. He takes it out on those closest to him. That includes you, Steve,” said Rhodes.
"Thank you," he said.
Steve caught the spark of inspiration in Piper's eyes. It would take a while to get her settled back down.
“I was.”
Tony nodded. He laid Piper on the changing table. Christina handed him one.
He glanced at the clock. “I have to go.” Steve went to the office where he met Barny once a week. A plate of muffins was waiting for him. As much as he hated going to these sessions, he needed them.
"Did he not take the news well?" he asked glancing at Steve's stomach.
“Where?” asked Steve.
*****
He paced his cell, ignoring the prickling sensation it caused in his feet. It was six feet by eight feet. It was too big. For someone so small, she could really fill a space. He peered through the glass wall at the front of his cell; his surroundings gave away nothing.
“I need your fingers.” Tony scooped her up, placing her in his lap. She easily connected the two wires he’d been working on.
“I’ll burp her you eat.” Tony put her over his shoulder and burped her.
Steve did not want to dig further into the subject. How easily Natasha could read a person could be disturbing at times. “What did you learn?”
"You don't sound good, Steve. When are you coming home?" Tony asked pointedly, worried, but also trying to contain his alpha voice.
“Yeah, what does he have to do with anything?”
“Hmm.”
“We’ve all done terrible things, but I don’t see a monster, Nat. I see a dear friend,” said Steve.
“Too fast." He looked up again. He ducked back down. “Three guys one girl all armed."
Steve nodded, but he didn’t want the scent to leave him. It was a reminder of the first perfect heat he had.
The voices of the new casters grew annoying. He flipped through the channels until the screen became a blur of gray, white, black, enjoying the white noise it provided.
“Sir, Captain Rogers is calling,” said Jarvis.
“They match with the vitals of the most severe cases,” said Jarvis.
“Died in 2009.”
She yelped as his attack hit its mark. The wind was knocked out of her. Winter stood above her. If that had been full power she’d doubted she’d be breathing this easily.
“A month in, I bled out. When I regained consciousness, I was in a hospital. Doctors told me that trying to have a pup again would kill me,” said Steve, his voice stone.
“Papa?”
“Why are you here? I thought you had some time off coming,” said Steve.
"Load him into the machine."
“Easy big guy, you’re the only one for me until your heat finishes. Unless you want more,” said Tony.
Pierce watch the gruesome display unamused. The beating had gone on for several minutes, and all the child had managed to do was scream and cry. Quite normal for a pup in this situation, but they hadn't taken her for normal. They wanted extraordinary. Pierce clenched and unclenched his hands. The sounds from the girl were affecting him, but, he reminded himself, it was all for the bettering of the world order. Dr. Zemo stood, unflinching, by his side.
Natasha shook her head before leaving. He locked the door behind her.  She left behind a toothbrush and toothpaste. He took a breath and steadied himself. For the moment his stomach was calm. Steve brushed the taste of vomit from his mouth. Steve wandered walking ship until he found somewhere secluded. There was a small window ledge where he could sit. Bruce and Tony lodged an uncomfortable thought in his head. He yawned. Steve tried pushing it away.
For the first time, he found himself agreeing with Rumlow. He knew the alpha meant a more permanent stay, so Steve only glared at the alpha. Anything more would only tip off Rumlow’s ego. He went to the tent he shared with Nat. She was working on something on her laptop. He took off his shirt drying his chest with it before putting on a fresh one.
“No!” growled Steve. “You will let me take care of you.” It had been so long since he last took care of someone. He needed to be helpful.
"Let's take a break," said Tony.
“I don’t need to tell you what’s coming up do I?” asked Rhodes.
Tony nodded. "I'll read through them. See if I can find anything."
“Turner.”
Tony gave him a few seconds to collect himself. He caressed Steve's cheek. Tears were threatening to pour-over. "Don't cry, sweetheart."
“Should I know her too?” asked Steve.
"Things have changed so much." This era never seized to surprise him.
There was shakiness to his voice. The enemy above became all the more clear.
“Go,” Steve instructed.
Phil kept his expression neutral. He didn’t want to know what his hero whispered to Stark to make Stark have such a heated expression.
The crisp sound of a beer can opening behind them.
"Because he's a person! He doesn't deserve to be treated like that."
“Did she get better?”
Piper’s eyes opened upon hearing the command. She heard Winter’s steps leaving the jet.
"I take it you know who I really am?"
“Where is my daughter?!”
“I only wish I was in on it,” said Steve.
said Tony.
The process was routine enough, though she shivered when the stethoscope touched her skin. "Stop," said Piper.
“They were made in America based on a Japanese recipe,”
"Let's get you comfy." He moved the armor into a comfortable position. “You happy now?”
"How do I punish a person who doesn't fear pain or even death? Even welcomes it. I would have thought it impossible until now.”
*****
Tony made a gagging sound. Steve laughed.
“Now isn’t time for this,” said Steve, pushing past the alpha.
Piper took the pen and pad. “This contract is meaningless even if I do sign. I’m still only three. I could easily say I didn’t know what I was signing. And everyone would believe me.”
“Do you want to go on a run?” She squealed happily. "So that's a yes."
“Beaten and bruised, but nothing can keep that man down.”
Natasha smiled at the confidence in Steve’s voice on such a topic.
“Steve, we have to talk about this.”
"I can't imagine what she'll be like when she starts walking," said Natasha.
“You didn’t have to. We can do something you like,” he said.
“I guess I’m next,” said Uncle Rhodey.
“How’d he take it?” she asked.
Piper nodded. As soon as she set foot inside, she was tackled hugged by Rune.
“He’ll be okay,”
She washed herself. Dunking her head in the water to get the shampoo out of her. Once she couldn’t smell that place on her skin she got up the tub. And she did feel better being nice and clean. Papa wrapped a towel around her, drying her off. He gave her the bag of clothes the agent brought. She ripped it open.
The only reason paternity is mentioned is a method for Banner to gather DNA from the embryo without potential harm.
It’s odd. I didn't take Stark as a modern art fan," she said.
“Why? For believing?”
*****
But that admission would be the last step before relinquishing all his vaunted independence. An independence which had cost him his pup, so he couldn’t let go of it now. Steve was always a person with a plan even if the most chaotic of situation. Somehow Tony had managed to find some level of calm. He wanted that. Steve wanted to be that put together.
“Jarvis."
Aunt Peggy took mercy on him. She gently squeezed his hand.
"It's impossible to make this not scary, but you need to put this in terms she can understand. You have the benefit of having a child that can understand how complicated this is. Tell her why you're going through this."
“Seemed right at the moment,” said Steve, shrugging.
“I’ll call my doctor later,” said Steve.
All six of them were in the park. For some reason only known to Piper, Thor was riding a large dog. Clint was having an archery contest with Legolas. Hulk seemed to be eating a hot dog cart. Natasha was sitting on a bench. He and Steve were simply sitting on the grass together. Piper never used a figure for herself, claiming she was already there why would she need someone to fill in for her. The simple thought inflicted such a harsh sting.
“Antarctica.”
Steve relaxed beside his alpha, but he wouldn’t sleep tonight. He smiled when Tony fell asleep on his chest. The alpha was a surprisingly cuddly sleeper. Tony slept like that the entire night.
“Yeah, just like the giant hole in the ceiling is nothing,” said Tony. The scent of Steve’s distress was suffocating, but mixed with it was Piper’s calmer tone.
“Still here?” asked Tony.
Steve snarled at the accusation.
“And the flashbacks,” said Barny.
“I assume extreme duress,” said Bruce.
"Clint ran his DNA, but there were no hits on any database worldwide," said Natasha.
Winter tossed the omega off him, then ran into the slowly gathering morning crowd. He didn’t dare look back. Those piercing blue eyes were too much for him. He felt like he was betraying something like it felt to disobey a command. But that didn’t make any sense. Not when he knew he was following orders; orders that were the only way to keep he and the pup safe.
“You can paint me."
“Asset, do you recognize these men?”
“No.”
Steve accepted the offer. He huddled himself against the alpha’s side, resting his head on the man’s chest. It should be more awkward cuddling with a stranger, but somehow it wasn't. He noticed a dim blue glow coming from the alpha’s chest. Steve pulled away to get a better look.
Steve rolled his eyes.
The rhythm was slow and deep. Steve’s leg wrapped around his waist. The omega’s eyelashes fluttered against his cheek. It wouldn’t take much longer for them to both be through.
Tony groaned. He didn’t need Jarvis to tell him. Rut was unpleasant. Some got a high from the wild strength it granted. He hated the lack of control. Steve licked his neck. For both their safety, he would have to collar Steve. He tapped the silver necklace, laced around Steve's neck. It expanded into a collar protecting the omega's scent gland. Steve wasn't agitated by its presence. It was meant to breathable. He'd made dozens of necklaces for heat protection. The collar shrunk to its original size. Jarvis could activate when they were both too far gone to.
“I got just the thing.” He went his suit, pressing down on one of the panels. It opened. “This is a pinata for a cricket. I’m kidding it’s a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face and twist the button on top and it discourages bullying. Not lethal just to cover one’s ass. Deal?”
“Everything fit okay?” asked Tony.
“Let’s go,” said Tony.

“We haven’t even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?”
Tony rolled his eyes.
He kissed his mate goodbye. Tony worked through the night.
“You alright?” Clint was standing calmly at the entrance of the gym.
Steve yawned feeling more relaxed now that his mate was home.
When he could no longer stand the quiet of the art studio, he left, pausing in front of Piper's room. Steve hadn't been able to enter it since she was taken, fearing what it may do him. Yet, now, his hand rested on the doorknob. He pushed it open, firmly frozen at the doorway. The room was exactly how she’d left it. For the first time, he was happy to see the mess. He stood there for a few minutes, unable to enter.
The windows darkened. He coiled around the large soldier. Steve pressed closer. His skin was too warm. He breathed in Steve's honey vanilla scent.
“God, you sound just like them,” said Steve.
"After the rest of your guests get here."
"What would you suggest?" he asked.
Tony growled at the doctor when he came closer.
“Any idea of when he’s going to pop the question?” she asked.
"There's nothing to explain! I was your replacement for him!” snarled Tony, before his faceplate slid shut.
"I do Tony. She was the one that drove me here that night."
“Sleep and dinner,” said Tony.
“I think they all made it."
“Thanks,” he said. Steve took a bite savoring the flavor. “This is really good."
“Will this work?” asked Steve.
"Because she nags me."
“That was quite a show, Rogers,” said Clint.
"Please, try. You've gotten less sleep than me."
Steve knew Tony communicated with the surgeon over the last few weeks, but he didn't believe they were at that level of readiness.
“You’re the omega he helped through heat,” said Rhodes.
Lena smiled. One of the walls she placed within Piper’s mind made it impossible for the pup to recognize her. She could be standing in front of Piper, and she would not recognize her. But Piper would always know her voice. She couldn't erase that from Piper’s memory. It was too involved, placing the foundations in the girl’s mind.
“Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head,” said Natasha.
“You’ve reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark. Please leave a message,” said Tony.
“Can I be marked and bonded to an alpha with my healing factor?” asked Steve.
“Almost perfect,” said Christina.
“Fuck,” said Fury.
Piper wanted to cry with sympathy, but tears were the last thing Winter wanted, so Piper forced them back.
"You still look like you have something on your mind, Pipes."
“Do not touch me again!” warned Thor.
Pepper shook her head. She could focus on the beta doctor later.
Tears threatened to fall from her eyes. There was still part of her that had those morals.
“Winter, I want you at the asset enclosure now.”
Alpha was moving too slowly. He grabbed him, yanking him into bed. Steve tucked them into bed. His arms wrapped around alpha’s waist, keeping him close. Alpha laughed.
Her husband believed she worked at the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica studying penguins and the effects global warming was having on them. It was someone's story but not hers. In reality, she worked at an undisclosed location in the Transantarctic Mountain range studying super soldiers. Pierce granted her full freedom.
"Anything else?" asked Tony.
“That’s still not gonna find them in time,” she said.
An unknown voice among the chaotic sound of battle drew Winter. An omega dressed in a white winter uniform spotted with red. The omega was armed with a blue and red shield. He charged, catching the enemy soldier off guard momentarily. They tangled a familiar battle. The omega slammed him against the wall pinning him place with his shield.
“Steve is the best person to discuss this situation. This is more his world than mine. I wouldn’t know what to do,” said Pepper.
“Mark 42. Well, I'll be damned the prodigal son returns." It crash-landed next to him and fell to pieces. “Whatever.”
"Not taking it easy on me today, sweet pea." He patted his stomach affectionately.
“I know them,” said Piper. They would never abandon her.
Piper slowly met her gaze. "What do you want?"
“And what about you?”
The distant shatter of ice as the door to the base opened. Followed by heavy military footsteps. He counted three. They were getting close.
She focused on the text of the newspaper. It was written in Russian. It was dated May 5, 2016.
