“Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suit. I’m pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, badass, baby brother.”
Tony drains his own cup of ramen and beckons for Steve’s empty one. “You think SHIELD is using the Mandarin as a test run for Insight?”
“Where do I sign?”
“You wanted proof, this is your proof,” Maria nods curtly at Fury’s bed, and pins her attention on Tony again. “Your turn.”
“Steve,” Tony repeats the name, sees if it rolls comfortably off his tongue. “I’m uh, pleased…” Great choice of diction there, doesn’t sound the least bit lecherous. “I mean, I’m looking forward. To this. It’s been quite some time since the last one, so… it’s quite an unusual experience.”
“Rogers, freeze!”
“Being Tony. OK.” Everybody and their mothers know first-hand how difficult Tony can get when fussing over his trinkets. “I’ll call back later. Thank you, Pepper.”
He doesn’t have abdominal muscles as prominent as Steve’s – not that he can see what lies underneath the uniform Steve has on – and the way Steve’s hands knead his stomach nags renews Tony’s resolution to sign up for a gym membership. His erection remains as steadfast as ever, much to his embarrassment, yet Steve makes no more reference to it. He skips the flimsy towel once he’s done lovingly caressing those angular hipbones and focuses on the fleshier aspect of Tony’s thighs. Again, Steve’s hands wander dangerously close under the towel, and good God, Tony doesn’t think, doesn’t wait – he parts his legs and belatedly berates himself for being so goddam
Steve pulls away, God, the tip of his tongue just barely caressing the plump edge of Tony's lip. And air –
“Any attempt on the director’s life had to look successful,” Maria replies as she rubs a spot between her eyes.
arms outstretched, has inserted himself between Steve and his prey. There’s a glint of clarity in those hazel eyes, and his chest is cycling like mad.
“Two years and a half. I’m moving soon, in fact. This is my last month here.”
“Yes, dad, I’ll be fine. You know the building is not too far from yours, and I know I can call you whenever something’s wrong,” Peter states. He puts his clothes down and finally faces his father, who has his hands in his pockets and his sunglasses on. Right, because whenever Tony is wearing his sunglasses, he’s actually wearing a mask.
“No, we couldn’t get in touch with anybody. But we’re not worried, the news has a live-feed of what’s happening back there.” He points towards the television where the news is indeed playing. Tony lets out a cheer when Steve appears on the screen, decapitating a Doombot with his shield, hair wild and bits of metal stuck in his beard. Tony really likes the beard, but Steve
“You want me to sing Edith Piaf for you?” Steve smiled widely at her for remembering his taste in music. “Steve, dear,” Yaël said as she grabbed his hand and put her other one on his shoulder. He automatically put his hand on her back “We need to practice for that special dance for when you get married to that asshole. Since you don’t have a mother to dance with, you’ll have to do it with me.”
The sun is slowly getting up. The city that never sleeps starts coming out of its peaceful moments. And Tony is purposely avoiding looking at the empty spot right next to him.
Tony nods, though he’s not particularly sure what to think of this. He’d been expecting that he would be staying in here for another two weeks or so, but after what the other doctor just told him… It seems like he’ll be home by the end of the week. Though, regular check-ups with Dr. Cho will be necessary. While she’s no expert on the Super Soldier serum, she’s the one who knows most about it other than Bruce, and Tony’s not seeing him anywhere around.
“Okay so I got this scholarship from Stark Industries for when I go to college, don’t ask me how I got it I just spontaneously went inside and made an appointment and then the guy just gave it to me after I told him my sad story, and now I find myself with enough money to go to college
“So, what, you two together now?” Johnny continues with the widest smirk on his face. Peter just slaps him on the arm.
It’s about twenty minutes when they finally arrive, and Peter’s feeling stiff all over his body. They go through the private underground parking before heading to the elevator. Using their Avengers-badges, they get up to the medical floor, where, as soon as the doors open, Peter is faced with a whole hallway of nurses in gear.
“Bake some fish, eat, read a book… Raido smuggled a few new ones for us,” Cem answered calmly. He had always been a very serene man, but one with joy twinkling in his eyes.
“You’re Spider-Man,” Ned whispers, shocked. Peter knows he’s screaming on the inside – he’s aware of how much of a fan Ned is. All Ned does is talk about the Avengers, and mostly Spider-Man. He would just never have thought he would find out.
“Because I’m an idiot?” Tony tries, giving him a light smile. It’s not convincing at all. If they weren’t in public, Peter would have hugged him or something. Tony looks like he’s been feeling horrible for a while now, and nobody’s really there to listen to him. Not even Peter, which tells a lot about him, doesn’t it?
“I haven’t gone through everything yet since Blonde Ambition times two over there keep on distracting me,” he mutters. Steve and Sharon roll their eyes again.
“Yaël, let me assure you that I will never think you’re incapable of doing something just because you’ve been through a whole bunch of shit and you don’t feel so great.” Yaël smiled. He had a point there, didn’t he? Why would someone stop treating her like an equal just for having a troubled mind? Why would Peter, of all people, Peter, do that? That boy was the ultimate good-guy himself.
“Hey Aunt May,” he mutters when he picks up. “I screwed up, and I need your help…”
Oh, great. That’s Liz. Peter turns around to face the girl, noticing rather quickly that she’s taller than him, though only slightly. Her dark skin shines a bit from sweating, and she licks her lips the moment she joins up with him.
Somehow, Yaël had the feeling that this boy couldn’t talk about this problem to anyone. It must be so damn frustrating, waiting to find out who really is your dad. But on the other hand, the way he spoke sounded like the man who had raised him, had died. So maybe, just maybe, if he finds his real dad, the man can be his new father figure.
the Peter on the screen burped and then went on with:
Harry…
“Colonel Rhodes and I, we were wondering why there were policemen ringing on the door?” Holy shit, really?! Were they so desperate to find drama that they went to the Avengers?
Johnny shakes his head. “I know when to stop,” he says. “But I’ll need Iron Man as well since I probably can’t absorb it all.”
“Have you forgotten that you’re my son?” he asks.
“I was going to show him around a bit, introduce him to Fury and whatnot,” Steve mutters out. “But I’ll catch you later?”
Peter listens as he explains, at last, what happened in Siberia. The betrayal he felt when he realized Steve hadn’t told him about his parents. The hatred he felt for the Soldier that killed his parents; Peter’s grandparents.
“You know, I’ve been kidnapped once or twice. It’s not that big of a deal, Peter,” Harry continues. Peter feels just close to punching him in the face. “But alright, I guess I see your point. But we can’t change it now, she’s already inside.”
Okay, no, that’s a lie. The asshole just creeps up on him all the time and Tony hates it.
Depending on who is guarding Mr. Stark, there’s reaction to said behavior. Widow usually just talks him down, giving him the hard facts and then playing in on his guilt. Where Peter wouldn’t have thought that would work, it does prove effective on the man.
“Hey, man, good for you! I don’t really know too much about that kind of shit but I guess you being off them means you’re getting better, right?”
But wait, maybe there was a message… Why else would she go through this?
Suddenly his hand hung in front of her nose.
Then he hurries out, running around the car to get to the other door. Trying to be a true gentleman, he bows forward before opening the door, holding out his hand to hand it to Steve, who rolls his eyes but can’t seem to help himself from grinning.
“I can get why she would want to do it. It would bring me some peace of mind, as well,” Tony admits while focusing on the computer in front of him. If Peter can see it right, he’s making some adjustments on FRIDAY’s code, which is not to be taken lightly. He suspects it has something to do with what happened yesterday.  “You might not realize it yet, but the Avengers really seem to have adopted you into their weird family.”
“Three?” he gets out.
“I wanted to help people, but I figured rather soon that this wasn’t the way I wanted to do it.” Once Tony’s removed the needle she grabs a tissue and presses it against the bleeding wound. Tony, meanwhile, goes to take a bandage to put on it.
“Listen, prince, I suggest a bargain,” Mr. Stark starts to the Principal as Peter observes Flash some more. With divided attention, Peter tries to catch up on the conversation. “I’ve already called up the contractors, and they’ll come and work on the school to fix it back up. I’m not going to cancel them if you say ‘no’, but would you agree that Peter gets off the hook? I’ll make sure he’ll work extra-hard at the workshop, instead.”
Peter shakes his head. Now’s not the time to start asking these questions. What matters is that they catch him so they can put him away again, and maybe take care of him.
“Ian and I never were together, get your head in the game. Also, yeah, couples are dumb, unless I’m part of the couple. Duh.”
“You’ll be brought to the right spot on the right time. Just listen well to the instructions you’re getting, alright”
, is already ready to pound on him. He’s not giving him enough time to even fight back. But even Tony knows that Steve can’t do any damage to him. The only thing that can help is…
Peter shakes his head. “No, classes start again. I’ll still be here in the morning, though. At least until eleven.”
“Nah, a meteor flew from the sky and blew the building up,” Harry says shortly. Sam loses his balance and drops down on the ground, while Clint almost jumps up in the air.
“No, I haven’t!” he tried to counter while putting his hands on his hips to make try to himself seem more serious about it. Well, it looked more like he tried to convince himself he hadn’t been crying.
? Do you know what it would have done to me if you would have gotten hurt? Again?”
“Looks like we’re both hopeless when it comes to the matters of the heart,” he says, copying Natasha’s words. The thing she told him when Pepper was going to break up with him. The sentence Tony thought was about Bruce, while in fact he now knows better.
The quinjet is already on the landing platform on the balcony. Clint salutes Tony once he sees him, but the others are busy talking to each other. The moment Steve is close enough, he asks for a status update. Natasha is the first one to respond.
Then Peter starts running. Running towards the window, throwing all his weight onto it. It shatters under him, cutting a bit through the suit and slashing his skin here and there. What hurts more is the impact of himself against the glass before it breaks. For a moment, he’s breathless, taking a second or two to recover.
“Alright, alright, I’ll put it down,” Reed says, making a gesture of surrender as he puts the thing down at last. Sue grins at winning once again. She leans to the side, putting her head on Reed’s shoulder and taking a bit of comfort close to him. A quick look at her finger, she once again catches a glimpse of her engagement ring. The wedding is supposed to be in a few weeks, and it’s mostly going to be a private matter. On Sue’s insistence, they’ve invited a few members of the Avengers, and normally everybody will be there.
“No! We’re not-! Not that!” Steve quickly counters, finally opening the door the moment Tony’s back on his feet.
“Really? What’s the meeting about? If I may ask, of course?” Typical Captain America, so friendly all the time. Peter just chuckles and shakes his head while looking at his hands.
he knows!
The closer Yaël got to the cottage, the older it started to look, but also well maintained. Someone had taken care of all those flowers around the small building. Someone must’ve painted these shutters a thousand times and someone must’ve spend hours of keeping the ivy, curling up against the walls, in control.
“Uh, wanted to hang, I suppose. Got a bit nervous,” Peter answers. She would know why he would be nervous, but he hopes she won’t bring the issue up. It’s not time for even Steve Rogers to know that Tony Stark has a son.
“There I was, reading through every name, and nowhere on that list was that one stupid little name. And I thought; is this it? Is this the year I won’t have to keep on looking at Parker’s stupid face again?”
“I feel great,” he says, deciding not to mention the panic attacks he’s been getting around Harry. They’re not important, and easy to fix when he goes to see the psychiatrist again in a few days. “Though I could do better once you’re all back.”
“NO!” the real Yaël screamed as she saw her friend collapse. His glass eyes stared to nothingness. Yaël ripped X’s hand away and started running to Raido’s body. She didn’t hear her memory yell “DIE!” to her own sister. She didn’t see how her memory self accidentally made a hand-gesture that caused the steering of blood. She didn’t see how her memory-self made her own sister stab herself five times, without even knowing how to stop it. The only thing she saw was her dead friend, her brother, laying in front of her.
After looking at Strange for a few times, who is giving him a funny look, Peter turns to a stumbling Bruce Banner. Then he points at him, trying to say his name despite his mouth being closed. He’s probably shaking to much, because there’s nothing coming from Tony. Peter hurries towards Dr. Banner and grabs him by the arm, pointing towards his face.
By the time he gets to the eighth message, MJ seems to realize something’s up. She asks him if he could call when he gets this message. The next few are the same, until she threatens to call up Tony if he doesn’t answer soon.
“Because I like having you near?” Steve tries hopefully. Tony shakes his head, leaning forward until his helmet bumps against Steve.
Steve, too, leans forward and kisses Peter on the head. It’s a thing all his parents seem to like to do lately, but Peter doesn’t complain. He rather likes it when they mess with his hair, or when they’re showing affection towards him. Peter just dives into Steve’s embrace, staying there until he hears his cue.
In Steve’s eyes, the bad outweighed the good. Sure, Stark was smart, and sure he was ready to offer up his life to save an entire city. But he was also the kind of guy that would announce his home address on live television while being actively targeted by a terrorist, thus endangering his current girlfriend and himself.
“My mom… did she- did she seem nice? I don’t remember her that much…”
“I’ll explain it when I see you,” he says. “See you at the park?” She knows where.
“Your dad is in medical,” Clint says.
“Hey, Francis, what’s up?” Peter asks, dropping the screwdrivers upon seeing the inventor in front of him. Francis is by far not the smartest guy on the floor – that’s difficult with Stark running around – but he’s the one assigned to take care of the interns, being good with the youth. That’s probably because he mostly behaves like he’s a teenager as well, always carrying his expensive backpack on one shoulder, listening to his music with his Stark-made wireless headphones and being pretty handy with the latest edition of every Stark-Phone – courtesy of Mr. Stark, who lets his employees test them out to find if they’re user-friendly.
“Come on,” Wade shooed the man off her belly “Let’s go, before you start an orgy here.”
.” After that, Peter hangs up. Steve’s already in the hallway, not caring if he’s waking everybody else up with his heavy footsteps. T’Challa’s room is on the floor above them, and it’s surrounded with security. But Steve expects they’ll let him in if he asks, right?
"No coffee before bed," he says sternly. Tony pouts.
Oh, if Tony wants to drink, that means that he’s having a hard time again. Peter gets up from the couch and nears the man standing there. Tony doesn’t notice Peter’s moving, so when the teenager wraps his arms around him in a strong hug, he startles a little bit.
As soon as Steve let go again, he pulled the door behind him shut and looked at her confusedly. “How did you even survive?”
“Well, well, well,” she grinned as she stepped out of the little wall of ice Yaël had tried to create. Yaël bit away her pain and tried to get back on her feet, with not that much success. By the time she was on her knees, she had to quickly dodge a ball of fire coming from Nilla by steering it away. She pulled herself up on the wall, leaning against it.
There’s nothing from Steve. Of course, there isn’t.
“You’re seriously going to walk off like that?”
“You’re up to something,” Michelle says, putting her hands in the pockets of her pants as she leans against the elevator, not seeming interested in getting out.
He doesn’t even bother to change back into his own clothes. Peter throws himself down on the bed, face down in to the pillow. The coat is actually rather uncomfortable, and it stings in some spots. But Peter doesn’t care.
The coach invites him back in with open arms, and before Peter knows it, with barely any baggage with him, he’s on the bus on his way to Washington, being questioned by Liz who is trying to keep everybody sharp.
“Aren’t you ashamed?” the King hissed to Lopt as soon as the counselor walked out of the door.
"You don't have anything to do with her, why would you protect her?" the unknown voice grunted.
Peter’s heart is racing in his chest, his arms aching from the constant swinging. Venom seems to have favored a construction site for the showdown. Peter can see the web where MJ is currently stuck, high between the tops of two near towers. A fall like that would mean her death before she even gets to the ground.
They have to be quiet when they arrive back at the Parkers’ home. Mary guides them inside, makes sure to close the door to her and Richard’s bedroom before gesturing towards him to get to what Tony suspects must be Peter’s room.
JARVIS explains. Tony sighs. He should have known, there’s nothing in the workshop indicating anything related to the Avengers, after all.
Tony shakes his head.
“Peter,” Tony greets him simply without looking up. It makes the boy frown in confusion. He heads towards the coffee machine to clean up the pads before putting a mug with milk into the microwave.
“Is somebody going to join us at the tower, then?”
When Peter suddenly feels like he can breathe again, he opens his eyes. He can’t feel the wind going over him, but he can catch a glimpse of the water underneath him. He’s flying above it,
“I know I do,” he says. “But… I have responsibilities now, Pete…”
He’s not too surprised when Steve is standing behind him as he turns around. What
They make it until lunch time. They take their usual (empty) place at the lunch table, make arrangements for a movie night to let Harry catch up on the new movies he’s missed this year, and discuss other film theories. It’s a good way for him to relax a bit after these past few stressful days.
“Yeah, uh, sure,” Tony says. He takes a step back, allowing the nurses to enter the room. “Can we go with him?”
a hero, but… Sue can’t explain why, but sometimes she thinks Johnny is just lonely.
“FRI?” Tony asks, looking up.
He’s thought about inviting Wade (why even?) and Yael. They assured him they’re having a little celebration on their own, that they wouldn’t feel completely welcome. Peter knows it’s because the girl rather avoids Tony. That’s an issue to solve in the near future, but not yet.
Not that Peter minds, of course; he only wants the best for Mr. Stark. But even Peter notices the way Steve is around him. Always trying to touch, but also trying not to touch too much. He’s always worried, calling out for Mr. Stark whenever he only sneezes even. Peter has made multiple mental notes that he should ask Yaël about it, since she seems to know Steve a lot more than Peter does.
“Oh, I was just telling Bruce here about it. I’m trying to give him dating-ideas for him and Betty!”
So when someone knocked on the door of her apartment, Yaël was rolled into a blanket, watching series, drinking a small glass of whiskey. She hoped the liquid would make her feel warm. Yaël growled as she heard the knock and rolled herself back out of her blanket.
“Yaël, do you even know what these two words mean?  Do you even know what these two curriculums would look like?” His smile turned into a wide grin. Guess he was right, who was she to counsel Peter with his choices?
Well, sort of… he’s not really sure how to call them since he doesn’t really have much contact with them – or well, he mostly just ignores Wade’s request for a quicky after a battle in the future. In any way, he’s sure that he could go to the weird purple-haired girl he’s come to call ‘friend’ so quickly after meeting her. It’s quite strange.
“In the bedroom,” Steve shouts back. Tony stands up from the couch and stretches a bit. Then he walks towards the coffee machine, prepares two cups for the both of them, and then makes his way to the bedroom. There, he can see Steve with damp hair, seated on the side of the bed, dressed in a sleeping-shirt and his boxer shorts. Tony doesn’t say anything. Instead, he hands him his cup, and sits down next to him. Silently, he grabs his hand lifting it up towards his lips to give his fingers a soft kiss.
They call for another break after every hour. It’s the perfect occasion for a toilet visit, or to get another cup of coffee. Sharon once takes the moment to hurry towards Tony and ask him something Peter can’t hear. He doesn’t think it’s important since she hurries off again not five seconds afterwards.
“Yes, dear,” Steve mutters in response, giving Wanda, Vision and Natasha a short wave. After that, they’re out of the common room. Natasha crosses her arms, glaring towards the three men on the other side of the table.
Being Spider-Man with the bag on his back isn’t particularly the best way to swing around. It’s a weight, and it messes up his swings or landings. But on the other hand he doesn’t want to risk leaving it around again, either. So the first thing he does is swinging to Stark Tower, where he climbs up the building and lands on the balcony of the penthouse.
“I, eh, this,” Yaël pointed at her head “is kind of empty. I simply don’t remember, Steve.” His confused look turned into a frown.
“I drew Francis!” Wade sounded proud, so Yaël looked down at his paper. It was very quickly drawn and colored man, some sort of stick-figure, like a kid’s drawing. That man, Francis apparently, got shot by another figure that he colored red. Yaël turned her head a bit. Oh, crap, it clearly was Wade shooting this Francis in his head.
“Lady, you need some snickers,” Wade jokes.
Peter makes another surprised sound, but it doesn’t even take him half as long as before to return the kiss with just as much enthusiasm.
“Tony, stop it!” Steve calls out, grabbing Tony’s arm and pulling him to a stop. Tony freezes, keeps on standing there unmoving. He needs to pull himself loose, needs to get away now. “Can’t you understand that I’m trying to talk to you about something?”
to save him. I owe him that much.
“Twenty-five,” Steve replies over the pelting of water on tiled floor. “Top mercs, led by Georges Batroc. Ex-TGSE, Action Division, top of Interpol’s red notice. Guy’s got a rep for maximum casualties.”
“You said you were removing it from the Net, Tony!” From this vantage point, Tony’s expression remains hidden from him, but the crinkle in the newspaper says it all. “Why is it
“You OK? Broke anything?”
Tony nods his thanks, and returns to the car. There
? Steve,
Steve doesn’t like the odds. “STRIKE Team Alpha. Rumlow, we have four pounds of C-4 strapped to the western walls. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th. Stark, any movement from the Goblin?”
“Uh oh.” He taps his ear piece, just in case.
“Put on that jumpsuit. And we’re taking your hobby car for the trip.”
Tony doesn’t remember if he asked for the egg mayonnaise or chicken sandwich to go with his coffee, and he certainly doesn’t recall how he ordered said coffee, which never happens. He
“No, that was heroic.”
They say, absence makes the heart grow fonder. As he waves Steve away and clambers into his bed, he’s already looking forward to waking up.
Because I can’t.”
, Steve did
He dares blame Tony for ruining the Avengers. And here he is
He’s not that cruel. Read between the lines – he’s gifting Tony a way out, despite how today has transpired. That’s ten minutes of a head start should Tony wants to mount an escape. The key is purposely left in the ignition. All Tony needs to do is to hop into the driver’s seat and speed off, fat middle finger a-waving.
But still. What a way to go down.
“General, leave her out of your schemes. She’s a civilian. She has no fault in this.”
This job… every sunrise is a lottery of life. Or death, maybe Fury’s the glass-half-empty type. Nobody mourns with tears though he can only imagine just how much that one-eyed nightmare mean to them. Rumlow and another tough-looking guy with a scar running vertically down his cheek are soon fiddling with their phones, probably looking for the right number to call. The missus’? He never stopped and wondered if Fury was ever married.
Is Tony even in
He leans into Steve, head lolling back until it rests against Steve’s shoulder. “Who knows even
His lungs inflate gratefully with air, as Steve draws back to his full height, already wiping his oil-coated hands with a fresh towel. “We’re done for today. You can schedule for another slot tomorrow or the day after. The front desk will handle the booking.”
“Tony? Can you hear me?”
“… I did.”
It’s over.
“You wrote a programme for the Lemurian Star. It launched a satellite meant to sync with Insight Hellicarriers. What’s your game?”
presence of mind left to process that – and distantly remembers getting himself checked last year for STDs. He rotates bed partners as quickly as he goes through his Bacardi stash, so.
No one else is in the car. Just Steve, thrashing in his sleep. And he won’t wake.
Steve and Tony hang out on the bench like two moms watching their kids having fun in the sandbox. Tony uncrosses his legs and asks, “That’s a good thing I did for the team, isn’t it?”
. Sooner or later, they’re going to know who he is. He won’t be surprised if the birth certificate of his scrawny Brooklyn ass makes headlines tomorrow morning.
judgement call. Steve's point exactly, but Fury is making his case to the wrong audience, and that grates on Steve's nerves even more.
comments – look, Sir, if you want to speak with Captain Rogers, you’ll have to make an appointment,
billows from his mouth.
Shouldn’t have shouted. Idiot. The echoes magnify the pounding in the back of his head. He’s numb for the most part, barely able to move – still, his mind wanders. What if he manages to free himself from this casket and realise his legs have been ripped off from his body trunk or something?
“Yeah, but we’re not gonna walk up to Pierce and demand him to step down nicely, are we?”
Mouthy, mouthy. Can’t have that now… not when they are getting on
the mission.”
Then, the man steps right into Tony’s personal space – so close that Tony’s forehead lolls to rest against his shoulder – as he loosens the knots fastening Tony’s limbs to the cot. He collapses wholly into the man’s embrace, a stream of almost-screams muffled against the front of Kevlar vest.
Maria exchanges a look with Steve, and sighs dramatically. “Looks like we’ll have to bring you up to speed when we reach.”
Sadly, he forgets Tony is Tony wherever he is.
“Not in jail, regrettably.”
That’s when the weight on Tony’s shoulders seems to melt completely. He rolls his necks and the joints creak, a light laughter erupting from his throat. “I welcome every touch you lay on me. Every one. I expect nothing less from Captain America,” he smirks. “You work me so hard I get so tired I just fall asleep, six hours straight. No nightmares.
when he talked about it –”
“Can you defuse the bombs?”
“It’s rhetorical. I won’t be far. I promise to stay on the premise. You sleep in the meantime, OK? I’m keeping the helmet next to your shield. Don’t drool on it!”
“What did Nick want with you at the office?” Tony suddenly asks. “It’s about the Lemurian Star, isn’t it?”
That again? They’ve been airing the same shit on national TV the past three days! He’ll even go as far as saying it’s the
were you last accessed from?”
Where is Steve Rogers?
“No more weapons.”
“Hey, I’m just thinking from your point of view. How would you define loyalty to the cause? Blind faith? Absolutely.”
It won’t go.
His cyber trail is a freaking yellow brick road when he keeps the route open like this. He works his mojo, tries to deflect all indications that would no doubt point to him and his computer occupying this very spot. He’s already cycling through shell accounts like Steve does his punching bags.
“I don’t mean that part of me,” Tony bites back a grunt. “Scoot to your left. I’m putting the seat down.”
That’s the million-dollar question. “At least, we know we’re at the right place.”
Steve checks the rearview mirror again, just to make sure nobody’s on the verge of
Even his Extremis can’t handle the excitement. Just too much! Tony’s hand shoots up in the air. “I want to ask the question first. You’re a lovely person, I’m sure, but you’re SHIELD, and I’m unfriending everyone SHIELD.” A tangerine-sized fireball erupts in the centre of his palm. “Who are you?”
“No, I’m not. Is this too hot for you to handle? I would do something for you, you know,” Tony waves nonchalantly at the raging erection in Steve’s lap. “But… nah.”
“Four thirty, then?”
“I won’t leave you. However it is between us, I won’t leave you!”
“Not suicidal. We jump down.”
“Sir!”
“It’s me!”
“It’s a date.” Tony winks at Steve, and hightails in the opposite direction. Somewhere between a decent speed on the tracks and building lactic acid in his quadriceps femoris muscle, he receives an automated text message to confirm his slot with the spa at four thirty. His only reply is a stream of cuss words under his breath as he trades the treadmill for a sandbag.
“I want… a promise.”
“… More or less. Anyway,” the tone of dismissal is obvious. “Anything up?”
Tony grabs his helmet and rushes clumsily to the front door. He sits on red earth – dog shit, whatever, he doesn’t care – and curls up against the wall. It’s much cooler here, thank the rain, and sucks air like a vacuum cleaner. His insides are torched. He needs
“It’s my treat, Mr Stark.” Steve stoops to lock the drawers installed in his trolley, a wan smile tugging on his lips. “Since you’re not getting the massage anyway, consider this a refund.”
Steve is no slouch either. He heads for Tony’s private suite on the topmost floor soon after, and keys in his access code, the one that Tony gives Captain America for use in emergency situations. Like this one, dammit.
“Is this uncomfortable, Mr Stark?”
“Maybe he should think twice about shooting his victims up with poison, or plucking their hearts out, yeah? I don’t tend to play nice with people like that.”
“Do you know what they were doing? Were they trying to get past SHIELD’s firewall, or maybe porn was on –”
Tony’s bodily thrown into the mesh wire with the force, and he thinks he blacks out a second or two. Pain – hot and intensifying – radiates from his middle, and he slumps in his bonds once more. That
They would’ve fired his ass there and then. His near-immaculate track record of securing grants after grants in the last five years sets him back with only a thorough chewing out, that by the end of the call, Tony cuts the line with a sharp jab on the screen and promptly pitches his phone into his pillow. These distractions... What gives? He's conquered projects of worse monetary value. He's convinced Luddites to invest in omics technology. He could've sold sins to saints, and this is -

Their director is dead. Everyone’s ticked. “
“Hilarious.”
“You are a man of great resources, Mr Stark,” Ross continues as if never interrupted. “I know you have ears in strategic departments within the government. Tell me, have you heard of Project Wide Awake?”
“So?” Tony surveys a row of hydrangea with disinterest. “That’s some king-sized balls you showed Nick there, dressing him down like that. Sounds to me you just gave him your three months’ notice. Stark Industries is
“I do
“I’ll drive,” he says, and nudges Tony to the elevator.
“… Lunch time is over for me. I should be –”
“When did you last sleep, anyway? You look like you’re ready to drop.”
Tony looks around with mild panic dressed up as curiosity for the snacks bar. “If I move, I can’t work on the computer, and that means I can’t defend the line, leaving myself open to detection.”
“Stop this. Not today.”
“Mr Stark,” he greets charmingly, and invites himself into the backseat. He nods at Steve, and says, “What can I do for you, Captain?”
“Really?” An operation this important and Tony Stark is whining about looking like a chick for one morning. Very mature. “Fine. Give me that. Set the bodies up.”
“You want to explain that elephant in the room?” The video playing on the giant screen behind Tony might’ve been muted, but it doesn’t take a genius to guess what’s spilling from virtual Steve’s mouth, currently moulded into a vulgar “O”.
Unless.
Steve is in the adjacent room. He hopes Steve doesn’t notice the extra security.
“You damn well should. What else is there to stay for?”
“Trust is a two-way street, Maria. You are manhandling an ally of SHIELD, and I hate to break it to you, they come in rather short supply these days. Let him go. He’s
“Currently, yes.”
With due respect, dissing SHIELD in full view of its founder’s resting place is bad taste. Steve wasn’t around when SHIELD came about, and Tony was too young to remember its glory days. SHIELD no doubt has changed over the years, morphing from the idealistic peacekeeper it was when Howard and Peggy were helming it, to a more jaded, pragmatic one Fury now leads. For better or worse, it adapts. Only then can it survive the trial and tribulation of time.
The night won’t last forever, so is their time for wound-licking and self-pity. Tony is first to stand up and get ready. He puts on two more layers of shirts, and with each layer of fabric the light in chest dims. He checks the trunk again and heaves a tire iron over his shoulder. Steve is so enthralled by Tony’s sudden showcase of determination that the flashlight Tony tosses his way almost hits him in the forehead. Their eyes lock, until annoyance surges in Tony’s, and he says curtly, “Bring your shield. If this were a meet-and-greet with some evil supervillain, we better dress up.”
She rolls her eyes and marches furiously to her table. She takes her seat in the executive chair this time, and swirls it so her back is set resolutely against the window. “This is a multi-billion-dollar transaction. We spent two months negotiating a deal which
Steve’s hand slips under it, and he flattens his hand over the dips and curves of Tony’s toned abdomen. There is strength and flaming passion – a man of iron will and heart, Steve respects Iron Man for that – as is vulnerability, and mortality. His hand dips lower to fiddle with the curls of dark pubic hair, and Tony lets out a whine, his pacing stuttering.
“Let’s go. Grab your shield,” Tony grumbles still. “Don’t forget my helmet.”
That’s why Tony is here in San Diego on Christmas week, some three thousand miles away from home. Tragic, really. He has exactly one lazy cat waiting for him in his posh penthouse-bachelor pad. Period.
outside, an endless shower the size of the oceans. Steve’s fire is still alive, and it warms the coldest of hearts. Steve himself is still where Tony leaves him – on the floor, arms crossed over his front, eyes shut. It’s difficult to tell with soldiers. Constantly drifting between slumber and not.
“The Winter Soldier took it.”
Tony’s own puzzled look is met with Steve’s dry smirk. Bastard, he knows what’s coming.
Steve is where Bambi says he is, loitering around the foyer, still as fresh-looking as the last time Tony sends him packing into SHIELD’s SUV. He too is admiring Howard’s portrait. It’s not exactly easy to ignore it. Very in-the-face. While Tony looks at Howard with indifference, Steve’s visage is anything but. Entirely understandable, in theory. Howard spent more time looking for Steve in the waters than he did raising his own son. He might’ve given up on Steve at some point, but he pretty much given up on a lot of things by then, and Tony had become too cynical to care.
“What?”
And, scene. That fireball had cost him the last of his strength. Tony lets himself be manhandled onto a stretcher, and is meekly towed into a non-descript black truck. “Take them away,” he hears Rumlow bark before the sky he’s gazing at turns to boring felt. A great adventure this has been, after
“Doesn’t look comfortable,” Steve points at the snoozing lump, and takes the seat next to Clint. “He should’ve gone to bed?”
a piece of my mind.” He needs to hammer home the importance of yelling at Fury a bit. They do
About people like him? Tony regulates his breathing to the beeping of Steve’s heart monitor. “Establish limits to control their growth. Curtail unusual activities that aren’t crucial for survival, at least temporarily until we understand this issue better.”
“Give me your tie.”
“I think he looks like that guy from ‘Black Swan’. You watched that movie yet? OK, no. I can
He mumbles “Yes” into said pillow, and all that comes out is a muffled “Oomph.” Which is good enough for Steve nevertheless, and strong, nimble fingers ease into his shoulders. God, it is heavenly. Tony loses himself into the kneading, and finds himself lulled into a sense of… being. Just, being. An odd place to be, where there’s only him in the present. No past to escape from, no future to worry about. The oil Steve is rubbing into his flank begins to sizzle, and Tony welcomes it. It’s hot and cool like the oxymoron that is the business of medical sciences. Did he mention that a course of T-cell therapy is estimated to be a quarter million dollars a pop? For something that is only administered after a patient has exhausted all other conventional therapies, for something that is basically a patient’s last resort, man… a quarter million dollars for a shot at life.
Why hasn’t Steve opened the case with SHIELD? The debriefing should’ve been over – it has been three hours since he bailed.
“… Get in the Quinjet.”
When Steve’s on a straight stretch of road – like this one – he’ll turn to run a palm up and down the length of Tony’s arm, if only to reassure himself that the body beside him is still warm and alive.

“I didn’t mean to startle you, Anna.”

! of Christmas arriving early.
He flicks his own right hand – it now sports two rings around his middle and ring fingers, and a matching bracelet, all of which are decorated with red filigree instead of Steve’s blue – and the boots and gauntlets shoot away in opposite directions.
“Well, that’s another job well done, I suppose,” Tony mutters without mirth.
“Well, McBryde, I saw Rogers slap a pickup towards a HYDRA mook with his bare hands, and as for Stark… actually, thank you for reminding me. Arrest him.”
Tony jerks upright, eyes wide open like a raving loon. His elbow misses Steve’s nose by an inch. “What’s up? What happened?”
“Hey, Cap?”
And then, and then, and then, Monday happens. Pepper is so looking forward to receiving them that she’s gone ahead and arranged for the company’s jet to pick them up sharp at eight in the morning. She was going to plan a luncheon with those folks in Long Island to welcome Tony’s homecoming, and that’s where he draws the line because, “It’s still your show, Pepper. You’re still CEO.” He may not be dying anytime soon, but he’s serious about passing the torch to her. Nevertheless, like he said, he won’t say no to CTO, and knowing Pepper, it’s an arrangement that’s probably already in the pipeline.
“Sure they are, buddy.” The compliment is worth enduring the ringing in his ears, so Tony gives him a thumb-up. He huffs apologetically at Steve. “Another time then.”
“He is here,” she begins slowly. “He says he’ll be in touch with you as soon as he can. There’s some… last minute designs he needs to work on. It’s for the Long Island plant, the Chief Engineer has been trying to get it dismissed, says it doesn’t adhere to safety regulations. Tony won’t hear any of it, so he’s… you know…”
“What’s with that accusatory tone?”
“… You used to care a great deal about my safety.”
“I’ll explain later,” Steve pulls Tony to his feet. “We have to go. Now.”
His HUD flashes red as his chest piece emits one last shot of bright blue light. Something shatters into sprinkles of metal and concrete, and Tony doesn’t waste anymore seconds. He makes a sharp curve mid-flight when his suit dips rapidly against the scream that just died in his throat. He’s losing altitude.
oftentimes a pledge to the lady that he’s coming home after they win. They did win, and he did come home, but the lady is gone, and he’s here collecting sexual favours from the son of a good friend. There is so much wrongness in that thought, Steve sinks his
Steve shakes his head, the lines on his face hardening. “Unbelievable.”
– hey! Hold on a damn second!
“Borrowed it.”
“Have you been sleeping?” A question that barely rises above his breath, but it startles Tony all the same. His tongue makes this
Speaking with Steve at the cemetery gave him a moment of clarity.
“Stark, get away!”
“JARVIS?”
Then, the gap between the door and the floor darkens, followed by two curt knocks and Pepper getting it. Her shocked expression prompts Tony to stand straighter, and instinctively park himself closer to Steve’s bed.
He shushes Steve down, and pulls the waistband to midthigh. Steve must be wanting this so bad, he’s leaking steadily that precum trails along the underside of his cock. Free lub? Waste not want not. So, he palms over the tip – yes, moan that moan again, Cap – and slathers it all over the length. Steve’s musk is particularly strong. Didn’t he read something about frequent ejaculation helps lower the risks for prostate cancer? Not that Steve needs the extra precautions. Despite being ninety-six, his prostate is probably healthier and
And this is where Steve leaves him, so they could all go back to doing the heroic thing, the

Milos cries out once – before he clamps his hand over his mouth.
Tony can’t believe they drove two days to listen to a madman raving. Suggesting that SHIELD is inherently HYDRA? He doesn’t really root for the home team, but this is ridiculous. “That’s impossible. SHIELD would have stopped you.”
“– that will improve security on the national level, and this is SHIELD. We can trust them.”
“Three!”
“Biometrics. So, I’m betting thumbprints or retina scans, but with SHIELD, it’s up for toss. Maybe it’s scalp patterning. Hair swirls. Oh, wait…”
There’s sand in his nostril, Christ. Coal in his throat. His brows and hair are nicely singed. He coughs, and God, his throat is so raw like it’s flayed. Is he?
“They know
Steve quickly learns. In the bowels of the bank, the Goblin has locked up thirteen hostages, one of them a girl aged five – the daughter of the bank’s regional manager. What information the Goblin seeks he never specifies, and that makes the Avengers, SHIELD and the NYPD nervous.
“I’m with you,” Tony eventually sighs. “Just thinking out loud, you might want to suggest SHIELD to hire precogs instead. I’ve heard some interesting rumours about kids with special abilities. Try headhunting for some at Xavier’s School. I’m all for driving job creation.”
“Move,” Tony threatens, his voice so deep it’s almost a growl, “and I’ll blast your head off. From this distance, I won’t miss.” From this distance, like hell he could misrecognise that face. “James Buchanan Barnes. The Winter Soldier. I have a spare handcuff somewhere, and I know a police station ten minutes’ drive from here.”
“Uhm,” Tony starts, not exactly sure what she’s talking about. He’s never seen this girl before in his life.
And Steve is happy. Because he’s got Tony, he’s got a slowly-healthier Peter around here, and he’s got Bucky wandering around. That, in the combination of his crazy family surrounding him here?
?” Yaël asked in disbelief. Brunhilde nodded to her to confirm the fact that Thor did name their group the Revengers, though looking like she thought the name was pretty clever. Oh, she had no idea…
“Oh, impolite to mentor? That deserves a mention in here,” Tony bluffs, and Peter quickly pulls the paper out from under his hands and tries to run away with it.
He can’t let MJ down like this. She’s probably up there, scared to death – or knowing her she’s throwing multiple curses at Venom and has almost managed to escape multiple times before being tied down again. Peter can’t leave her like this. So he starts running again, fighting through the tears in his eyes. There’s something heavy in his throat, almost preventing him from breathing.
“Oh, hey Daisy,” Steve says, not at all appearing nervous. He’s a good actor, Tony figures. “This is, uh… Iron Man? Yeah, I just found him stopping some crimes on the streets and I figured he could be a help.” Steve shrugs. Tony keeps his lips tightly sealed, afraid that people could recognize his voice. He shortly closes his eyes, focusing on his suit. Change the voice modulator, make it sound more metallic. Avoid being recognized.
Without any interruption, the four of them sit together. They talk, joke, and even start up a few games of cards. It’s all fun, and Peter hasn’t felt better than this in the past few weeks, feeling like he’s complete again. But he knows it won’t last; things aren’t the same, and soon enough they’ll be called away again.
“You just don’t understand, boys,” Harry says after a few minutes of silent staring. Harry takes out his phone and starts going through it. He doesn’t have a lot of numbers, and he’s not even allowed to get a Facebook account despite his false name. The thing is mostly for show, to play games or to listen to music. “You’re right, why MJ? Well, I’ve been with fake girls all the time. They only cared about my money. But now that I don’t
It’s by the time that he gets to the second book – yes, he’s finished the first one already – that there’s a first mention of his father, who by that time already worked at Oscorp.
“Uh, whales,” he says shortly. Ned frowns but Harry nods in understanding.
- Depressed Peter (as a result of his own stupid actions)
Tony chuckles, leaning forward until his lips are next to Steve’s ears.
Three days left until Infinity War here in Belgium. I'm all kinds of nervous! Anyway, another update, because that damn deadline is getting closer and closer!
I need to say: I am aware that the hour difference doesn't add  up in the previous chapter. I did my research, but something went wrong and I had already written too much to change it. So, please just try to ignore the massive mistake I made there.
The reading slows down a bit after school picks up again. He takes them to classes, and spends most of his time just reading through them, missing whatever the teacher’s trying to teach him. About a week after receiving the journals, they have passed five years give or take. Peter knows he’s getting close to the end, because this is about the time that they disappeared. Up until now, nothing more has been said about Mr. Stark – it’s like his mother just completely banished him from her life. Meanwhile, their study with the spiders with Dr. Connors seems to have advanced, even though his mother has taken a little step back from it to take care of Peter. Somehow, once again, Peter finds a few pages missing, and by then he wonders what his mother would probably not have wanted in written evidence.
“No,” Tony says. Ross frowns. The woman next to him drops her tablet on the table and gives him a long look.
your biological son. But… I want it to be on the papers; to be your
“What are you thinking about?” Yaël asked after a few minutes of silence. Not that she minded the silence. She had just been staring at the movements the branches made when the wind caught them.
“Yes, I did,” Tony mutters.
He’s been telling himself for the past three months that they’re done. That they’ve broken up and that he has to move on with his life. But as it is now, how can he do it? How can he do any of it without Steve? The man who has been taking care of him when he was at his lowest. The man who loves his son as if Peter were his own.
Because he’s watching his father dying. The man on the ground, begging for his attacked to help his wife – Tony’s mother. Howard recognizing Sergeant Barnes. Tony then looks up at Barnes, who is doing everything he can to keep his eyes away, looking as if he’s reliving his worst nightmare. Their eyes only meet shortly. On the screen, Howard Stark then gets pounded in the face with a metal fist. Tony closes his eyes when he’s sure his father is dead. Then his breath speeds up again at the thought that his mother is next.
about how he’s gotten to the suspicion that Mr. Stark might be his father, following by how he came to the discovery that he actually
“Hi, dear, when did you get here?” Tony asks, nearing Steve to kiss him on the cheek. After that, he takes place on the seat next to Peter.
“I know you care about him, champ. But we’re… too much has happened, and I can’t stay with him and pretend everything’s fine, you know?” Peter blinks for a moment.
Steve’s familiar voice says on the other side of the line.
“Come on, I’ll come with you,” he says. Peter nods, and after taking a deep breath, he walks up to those stairs that lead to the stage.
“Steve, are you alright?” Peter asks, slightly worried. He just hopes there’s not already a fight with Tony, because honestly, they’re
“I sure hope for him he’s not,” Tony answers, carrying his suitcase along with him. Peter didn’t expect him suddenly showing up in the room, so he startles a bit at how near he suddenly is. He quickly turns around in the couch to face Tony, seeing him run up to the kitchenette to get himself another cup of coffee. “Shit what I would do for a scotch.”
Tony doesn’t dare speak, barely even manages to look at his son, who looks even paler than before. His hair is sticking to his forehead, his eyes closed. His mouth is opened, as there’s a tube put through it. Endotrachial tube. Tony closes his eyes.
I'm not sure if people are actually enjoying this story, but I'll keep on updating anyway. To be fair, writing's been pretty rough lately because for some reason I've been feeling... low. I keep on writing because I want to finish the story, but I just hope I don't start lagging behind on my chapters. I'm sorry if my 'sadness' is too obvious in everything that's happening in this sequel. I don't even have a good reason to BE sad, which makes it even ten times worse.
If he wants to call Steve, he needs to do it now. With his web shooter, he gets the phone off the floor. Trying his best not to crash against anything, Peter searches for the only number in there, and presses call. This time, he holds the device with his hand.
“Johnny?” he asks, confused.
“Peter, you alright?” Tony asks. He can feel Steve shift a bit next to him. Peter just grunts, rubbing his eyes while sitting up.
Tony shudders visibly. Steve looks at him sadly before pulling him into his arms, into a strong embrace. Kissing him on the head, his eyes meet the others.
This man was completely crazy, but Yaël liked him that way.
Peter only looks back up when the two have walked away from the kitchenette. Once their voices have completely disappeared, he lets out a relieved sigh.
, like Steve said.
“Why do you hate me so much? I can’t remember hurting you! We’re sisters!” Suddenly Nilla’s face came dangerously close to hers again.
May sobs lightly against Steve’s shoulder. It’s a heartbreaking view, and Tony just can’t be a part of that. He averts his eyes, keeping his attention on Bruce who has discarded the charts to look some things up on the tablet he got from Tony about a year ago.
“Whatever! You don’t have to repeat it all the time, man!” Scott complains, sad that his joke has failed once again. Peter will never let him have that one, because Scott’s just fun to mess with. As Tony deals in the cards again, Steve turns towards Peter.
Peter pauses for a moment. “Have you been watching Brooklyn Nine Nine?” he asks. Natasha just smirks but doesn’t say anything in return.
“TONY!” Steve snaps, throwing another pillow over his head.
Peter now starts to realize he might not have come home at all.
“I agree with Ben,” Reed finally speaks up. “Besides, signing means we can keep on going. If we don’t, we’re not allowed to do anything anymore, Johnny.”
But his mother still got the air strangled out of her. After that, the video ends with Barnes aiming towards the camera. After that, it’s only static, which represents exactly how Tony is feeling inside right now.
“Sorry! I was gonna come in normal clothes but I forgot they burn off when I flame up,” Johnny explains his appearance. Peter shakes his head, grinning towards Johnny as he pulls him into a hug.
“Steve,” he starts, taking a few breaths. But Steve’s no longer awake, and Tony is left alone in this discussion. He clears his throat before getting back to the living room where he sees Hilde already carrying Sam as well.
He sighs, forgetting about going to the toilet after that. He looks at the bruise; it’s enormous. He rubs the spot for a moment, leaning back against the pillow and closing his eyes again.
“Y’know Cap, is no use at’ll,” Mr. Stark says. “There’ssssno leg-cy fffor ma compny.”
Oh, man, Charles should see her right now. They could be wheelchair buddies, doing wheelies with the carriage. Or not, maybe, as Charles was already an old man in real life. But they’d still be wheelchair buddies that played checkers or chess together.
“Did your husband forget something here?” Oh, the way Norman talks is just so supposedly innocent, but Tony knows enough about him to spot his selfishness from miles away. He’s heard the entire story from Harry already, and his respect for Norman Osborn hasn’t gotten any bigger for it.
Being given an office of his own, Tony sits down at his desk and watches the security footages of Barnes being locked up in some sort of isolation chamber. In Tony’s experience, he knows that won’t really hold him if he
“You could have done it as well, you know! It’s not all
“Honey?” Tony asks.
“Harry can start arriving now, he’s twenty minutes late almost!” Ned complains. Peter just hums in agreement, going through his mobile for a bit. Even there there’s nothing new to say.
“Auw,” Peter mutters as his cheek hits his plate. There’s a fry poking his eye, and the sauce is already in his nose.
“Good morning! What’s the day bringing us?” he asked cheerfully. Thor ended up with and eyepatch and Yaël with a wheelchair, that was how much damage Hela had caused them.
Peter has in fact been scolded by Aunt May when she’d heard the news about Peter’s detention. He’s got house-arrest, and isn’t been allowed to leave except for school or the internship. Peter understands it completely, and never even tries to talk himself out of that sentence.
She gives Peter a knowing look. He sighs. Why does he always feel like she knows too much? She can’t know, right?
“In a relationship?” Steve tries to finish when Tony hesitates on his words.
“On it,” Steve says, pressing around on the buttons for a bit before Peter takes pity on him and takes it over. Despite everything, Steve’s still not as handy with technology as he probably wishes he was.
Tony frowns. “Why would you assume I wouldn’t want to be a part of it?” he asks. Pepper sighs, rolling her eyes as she sits up straight.
“Ow, that was a hard kick,” Peter complains.
Peter nods, smiling.
“Don’t count on it.”
she says, making Peter roll his eyes. “
But Charles doesn’t say anything. He just holds up his thumb and nods. Tony clears his throat before nodding as well.
“I’m Peter,” he says. “I know this is going to sound weird and you’re both probably not going to believe me, but… I’m going to be your relationship therapist right now.”
“Goodnight, Harry. Don’t let the bed-bugs bite.”
“Ah, I was waiting for you!” Dr. Cho says the moment he gets in. He can barely close the door behind him before she’s already on her feet and walking towards the counter, where a big envelope is lying ready for him. There’s no name written on it – unsurprisingly. “I only got the results in this morning, these tests are always tricky, but with the latest Stark-tech at least it doesn’t take a whole month.”
“Uh, no?”
“Are elected to fight on a rank higher, congratulations,” the woman added as dry as possible.
“That’s because he respects you. And doesn’t want to marry you. If I get one more marriage proposal through text I think I might throw my phone out of the window,” Peter mutters.
The school is undergoing some reparations due to the whole conflict between Wolverine and Deadpool, causing for some classes to be relocated until it’s finished. Other clubs have been cancelled for the time being, including the Decathlon team that Ned had been anxious to join (and also bugging Peter to do so as well) ever since he’s gotten here.
“You can’t stop me,” the guy says, pulling up his left fist to punch him in the face. Peter stops it easily, turning the hand around painfully until the man lets out a painful shout. Looking down at the man’s hand, he sees it.
“Why, thank you!” Korgh answered with a dumb smile.
Mr. Stark doesn’t react to it, instead turning around and pulling up his phone. In the hallway now the leftover teenagers from detention appear, taking in the carnage that is left in the building. Flash looks in horror when he sees that the football-trophy has been destroyed.
going to Berlin to see his dad, and that’s that. But it would be risky. She might ask Tony how Peter’s doing, they might realize that Peter
“Oh, Brunhilde, meet Yaël. Yaël, meet Brunhilde, she’s a Valkyrie.” Yaël nodded shortly with a friendly but tense smile.
“Tony drank?” Peter asks with a high-pitched voice, scared for the answer.
“Steve?! How- wha- where are you?!” Peter calls out, almost unable to contain his excitement. It’s the first time he’s speaking to the man since… well, a few days at least. He’d almost forgotten how it feels to talk to him. “Steve, what’s going on there?”
“Actually I didn’t come here to talk about school; I was wondering if maybe you want to hang out tonight? Go see a movie? There’s this Slenderman movie that came out last month but I haven’t gone to see it yet.”
“Where’s Dick?” Tony asks. Nobody ever calls Richard that except for Tony. It’s one of the things that he liked to annoy Mary with back when they were still friends.
“I wanted to thank you. For helping out Peter,” he says in return.
It’s not that things are going crappy at school. The classes aren’t too hard, Ned is by his side, and even Michelle isn’t as annoying as always. But no matter how nice everybody is being today, he’s still having a horrible time.
Peter pulls his hands back, pushing his fingers into his mouth and sucking on his fingers. Tony blinks when his son starts drooling all over his arms.
Yaël totally didn’t like being called a piece of someone and every time some random guy she just danced with or had a drink with, said it, she got more and more annoyed.  So when someone laid his hand on her shoulder to pull her back to him, she snatched out of it and…accidentally used her powers. Being drunk made it way harder to control them.
When they’ve been outside for almost twenty minutes, another sound comes up. It’s an aircraft, from the sounds of it. Peter figures the Guardians must have arrived, perhaps. With a short look at Yaël, the three of them start heading towards the landed aircraft.
,” Harry hisses sarcastically once he notices him. There’s a giant grin on his face, and his tongue is passing over his lips quickly, “long time no see. How’s Gwen?”
he counters immediately. Tony just smirks and grabs Peter’s arm to take a good look at the web-shooters. Peter just hopes he doesn’t recognize the design from what Peter showed him at the interview. “Wh-what are you doing?”
“Hello?” he asks, not bothering to say his name.
“You- I’m sorry, you’re going to… what?” Steve had asked, wiping a tear away. His smile quickly disappeared when he saw the dry look Natasha was giving him. One that could indicate that she was messing with him, but might as well mean that she was ready to kill him on the spot.
“Nowhere I can go for now,” he says in defeat. Sharon just smiles sadly at him before leaning forward to kiss his cheek. Then she pulls on her white coat again and hurries back to the door.
Okay, Peter feels it’s about time to better hide into his bedroom. But, doing that would mean that he’ll have to get in between Steve and Tony, who are currently still at the beginning of the hallway, blocking the way in their discussion.
“It’s harder than it looks, really,” Bruce mutters. Pepper rolls her eyes, walking towards the counter and gently pushing Bruce aside.
“Peter Parker,” Natasha calls out, still wearing her uniform. She has her hands on her hips and a murderous look on her face. Peter’s breath gets stuck in his throat, and for a short second he fears for his life. Johnny, too, seems frozen in place.
He doesn’t meet Steve’s eyes. Not at all. It’s probably also how he discovers the handcuffs around Steve’s left hand. The ones that attach him to his wheelchair. Once he sees Tony stare at it, Steve sighs.
“I’m looking forward to it,” Tony admits. “I can’t wait to see it.”
! And I failed! I lost one of the most important person in my life. And you’re telling me that there’s a way for me to have him back, but you just won’t do it because the world might explode? IT’LL EXPLODE NONETHELESS!”
Peter nods as well, following after Gwen with hasty steps. The girl takes off her mask the moment she’s inside, so Peter figures the people here know about her. But they don’t come across anybody. No scientists, no Avengers. The building is practically empty.
“I guess we both did?” Clint offers. Natasha rolls her eyes, flicking all three of them over the head.
Oh, if only he could run away, put as much distance from this creep as he can. But, he’s still at work, and ignoring a call for him – no matter how personally – could get him in serious trouble. Especially when his boss is giving him a watchful look with an eyebrow raised.
It was a good day. Back then, there weren’t any worries about
Of course, Charles was the answer to this mystery. His younger version walked around the corner, with his hands against his back, like he was just taking a stroll.
Suddenly two cold hands grabbed her waist and pulled her back a bit, so she leaned against him. The difference between his cold skin and her feverish one was very noticeable. As she looked behind her, she noticed he had pulled off his own shirt. Suddenly, the cave didn’t feel like an oven anymore. It felt just fine.
“We had a tough time, with you being unable to get on the transplant list. Luckily, Mr. Rogers decided to help. Even more luckily that he was a match, too.”
“You miss Steve, don’t you?” Peter tries.
“We’re just waiting for Harry,” Peter says. Tony hums, still pensive about letting Harry hang out with Peter this much. They’ve had a conversation about it to make sure Peter’s feeling okay with it, but despite that Tony never really seems completely comfortable with letting them hang out. It’s probably going to take a while.
The suit kicks out. It’s a surprise to both Steve and Peter. And as Peter kicks Steve right in the groin, the super soldier releases his hold on him, instead falling on his knees with a red face, looking pained.
“I don’t want to destroy the world; only protect it,” Peter counters, making Harry roll his eyes.
And Steve walks off, leaving a scared Adrian Toomes behind on his place at the table.
“What do you mean?”
And that’s how Peter finds himself being the deliverer of two pizza’s to a house that left the specific instruction that he might be away for long. Of course, his boss didn’t take it seriously, at all, instead sending him on his way and not paying much more attention to him after that. What Peter finds odd is that the person on the phone apparently
As it turns out, he’s not sure if luck’s by his side or not. Seeing Wanda’s name on the screen, he doesn’t hesitate on picking up the phone, pressing it against his ear and rubbing his eyes with his left hand.
“I know who you are, and I know that you suspect Stark’s your father,” she explains. When she’s looking at what Peter’s staring at, her face falls a little bit. Still, she doesn’t say anything, instead handing him a vial of blood. Mr. Stark’s details are still on it with a sticker, so Peter pulls that off to keep it hidden from Dr. Cho. She doesn’t need to know that the man who’s funding her is the father of Spider-Man.
we haven’t!”
Chapter warnings:
Parker… now that’s a name he hasn’t heard in a long time. One would think that with such a big company, at least one of his workers would have that surname. Still, the only Parker he can think of is… what was his name again?
, like you said. Because James seemed to love it.
When he wasn’t phoning with some important chief, he took a few minutes to call up Peter. It had been good to hear his voice, find something familiar in this group of people where he knows absolutely nobody. Sure, Natasha is here, but when have they ever been
Landing on the soft surface pulls out a groan from him. His muscles ache, his head hurts. The bruise on his right eye doesn’t help. How is he going to explain that to Tony? He could say he got in another fight on the streets, but either way, he’ll get trouble from it. Maybe he just fell against something? Walked some stairs and accidentally dropped his face onto Flash’ fist?
Everybody stays quiet, obviously knowing not to make anymore smart remarks. That’s when Tony pulls up his phone, and brings up the research he did in the past couple of days since the MIT-presentation. Immediately, a picture of a laughing Charles Spencer comes up.
“I missed you, Steve,” Peter admits. “I know I might not say it like that, but… you’re my dad, too. You know that, right?”
They’re keeping it quiet, Peter notices quickly enough.
“Aren’t there any guards?” Peter asks.
This girl can be his friend, just like Wanda – who has proven to be the kindest and most gentle person he knows right now. She does appear a bit sad sometimes. Peter wonders why, but on the other hand he knows it’s not his place to ask. If Wanda wants to tell, she’ll do it when she’s ready.
“Stark, is this really the right moment?”
“Nice of you to join us, Mr. Stark. We were just about to call for you,” he says, greeting Tony, who gets himself out of his suit again.
“You’re strong too,” Steve assures him in a whisper, smile obvious in his voice. “And I care for both of you, so we’ll make sure you’ll both get out of this.”
Tony gives him an unimpressed look before grinning again, leaning forward to kiss him. Before he can reach, Steve steps aside, pulling him along to get him out of the penthouse.
” Peter repeats in a hiss, preparing himself to throw out a web, but his hand is shaking too much; he can’t aim right now.
“Right…” Fury mumbles. Tony blows out another breath, regretting it immediately when it hits him in the face almost instantly. “I’ll, uh… I’ll just meet the Captain on the deck upstairs, then.”
Tony sighs again. “No, this little one here is the reason we need May distracted for a moment.”
Steve nods. “You don’t think she might go after some Stark-tech next, right?”
This right here, this is exactly what he’s good at. Takes another good look at the place with the help of the screens on his glasses, and then he goes to his toolbox and starts tinkering around.
“I’m sure he’s fine. You said he was on his way back, right? Who’s picking him up?”
“I know,” Yaël leaned against the back of her chair, rubbing her eyes. “Does Stark actually already know you’re his son?”
“O-okay,” Yaël muttered confusedly. He had told all of this like it was nothing, with a tone that didn’t fit the subject, but that was typical to Loki.
“Peter Parker!” someone calls out. And it immediately clicks.
“Yeah, but it’s pretty quiet tonight. I’m actually just chilling on the roof, so not getting into any danger you know,” he assures him with a forced chuckle. He can see Tony roll his eyes at him.
Despite the fact that they barely knew each other at all, Natasha and Clint both accepted Steve into their little group. He joined them on SHIELD missions. Sometimes the three of them, sometimes just him and Clint, and other times him and Natasha. A couple of time he was the one getting benched, but that was mostly in case the mission was a covert one that needed infiltration that spanned in a longer period of time. In hat case, Steve was the back-up.
There’s a slight panic going through Peter when he wakes up in a strange place. The room he’s currently in is not his own; where are his posters? His top-bunk bed in which he likes to climb in so much? His messy desk full with electronical devices he took from random dumpsters to mash something together?
“Nope, told me to go to Hell, but I’m going to the compound instead. But you can call me any time; I’ll put you on hold, I like to watch the light blink.”
“Yeah, we should talk to him maybe,” Steve suggested. Tony nodded.
And then the screen turns blank, and all Tony can see is the table through the glass. A breath escapes his mouth, and at last he gets back the movement in his arms. He leans back in his chair, raises his eyes to the ceiling, and tries to count to a hundred to calm down his nerves. What he would do right now to have Rhodey here. He’s not sure who stayed here, and who left, but he could figure it out.
“How about a loose follow?” he asks. “Boundaries are good, buddy.”
“So do you have any idea how fast you were flying when Iron Man brought you back?” Ned asks, and Peter snorts. He’s been getting these types of questions for a while now, but Ned keeps on wanting to know more and more. It’s kind of hilarious, Peter thinks.
Suddenly, he’s pulled into an extremely strong hug. He shouldn’t even be surprised by Steve’s reaction, though the breath is still stolen out of his lungs. After a small moment of shock, Tony manages to put up another smile and gently taps Steve on the back.
But sometimes it’s dreams of Peter. Mostly of the kid disappointed in him for some reason, but sometimes with the kid being in danger, chased by the Goblin – who they
Another chill passes over him. Peter drops down to the ground and rolls to the side, only realizing a bit too late that he’s showing too much skill here. In an attempt to draw it back a little bit, he purposely stumbles himself against the desk, earning him a headache. Then, something smashes against his forehead, sticking on it like a sucker. When Peter tries to pull it off, he finds that it’s, indeed, a sucker.
“What, I thought you liked it?” the girl asks playfully through her grin. “You were very much a willing participant, after all.”
Who turns out to be none other than Yael. Peter’s mouth falls open; he hasn’t seen this girl ever since the crap with the accords first started! She’d been on a trip somewhere, and practically disappeared from the world! When did she even return?!
Of course, after that, things easily went to shit. HYDRA, Bucky, Fury dying, Natasha and him going undercover. A lot happened, and when Steve come up in the hospital after being shot three times, he honestly felt as if an entire building had dropped o his head. To be fair, he had fallen from quite a height.
Though they did help along during the war against Thanos a few years back. Tony probably shouldn’t complain about it.
“Yeah, there are the sex-positive asexuals,” Heather adds. “Then there’s the antisexuals like your Aunt here.”
“Thankful? THANKFUL?! The whole planet looks at me like I should be caged! We could’ve ran away-“
for that.
kingdom?”
“…Yes?”
Instead, all he gets is warning from FRIDAY, telling him that multiple things have come up. Viewing her findings on Barnes’
Peter leans back, mouth open as he nods in understanding. He would have expected Rhodey or something, but given that the man is out of town for his revalidation the following week it’s not like he can just ask him.
Steve has to admit that Natasha has a point. But… when it comes to Tony, he just never really thinks rationally.
It was one of the rare times Steve saw Natasha actually
“Ehm, I can’t drive… But if you give me an address, I’m willing to search for something, somehow. I’ll figure it out.”
“WHAT?!” Peter shrieks out in surprise, almost jumping off the edge because of it. “No I’m not!”
Chapter warnings see end notes
The phone vibrates in his hand. He doesn’t pick up.
“You alright, kid?” the man asks him. Peter shakes himself out of his stupor, blinking a few times before turning towards Hawkeye.
Yaël turned to Tony. “You could’ve ask me to leave, but that would’ve been too simple, right?” she hissed. Did this man really have such a big need of showing off his power, he’d just let his bodyguards drag her to the street? She ignored the fact that Stark looked a bit shocked as well as he didn’t do a thing to stop the bodyguards, with his mouth fallen open and his eyes wide.
That surprises Tony.
Steve almost crashes into a tree. He rights his steering wheel, and winces when the driver overtaking his car salutes him with a middle finger. “Where is he going?”
Steve swats the burning stick from Tony’s grasp, and kicks the haystack into the rain. Blood drips onto the floorboard where a nail in the stick tore through the flesh of Tony’s palm. “It’s OK, let’s get that cleaned up. We can stitch it up, I know… how…”
“Fury, huh?” His name is everywhere. Not even trying to hide his little scheme. “Terminate programme. Get us out, J.”
“… We’re here.”
“Thought you’ll never ask. What’s your favourite colour, Cap?”
“Whatever that’s on Steve’s tablet, I want them on the wall.”
, Rogers. Language!”
“Is that really you, Stark? It’s like I don’t know you anymore.”
crazy?”
He finally beeps into the gym without incident, and goes through another door on his right into the unisex changing room. A quick eyeballing tells him there are no cameras installed – not visible ones at least – and promptly occupies the bench closest to the door. The uploading was interrupted courtesy of Mr Husband, and he’s lost precious minutes just dealing with Anna’s admittedly weirdass acquaintances. All things considered, things have gone quite swimmingly for him, and he sure hopes the same can be said on Steve’s side.
means, even the media is marching to SHIELD’s fife.
He won’t stop calling for Steve, until Steve fucking acknowledges he’s here.
into it, figured if it was advantageous if we could, you know, pre-empt crimes, just like what your buddies in SHIELD are trying to do.”
Done deal. A closure, for both their sakes. Steve rises from his stool and makes for the door, hoping it’ll let him out without needing Tony’s handprint because this exit will be
Steve continues drilling him into the bed. Tony can’t hurt – his body won’t let him. “You’re a closet masochist.”
“Stay close to me, Tony,” Steve reminds him as he towels his hair dry. They’re back in their private quarter, and Steve’s whole person is damp, fresh out of shower. “After we find you a safe place to work from, I’ll go after Pierce at the conference.”
Steve looks forward in a pensive way, turning to Sam who simply shrugs.
He did see her a few times back when that whole drama with Mary begun, but never had he spoken to her while he’d been sober. He can only vaguely remember her face, but has stated rather quickly that she looks extremely young for her age. She can’t be much older than Pepper, Tony thinks. Probably even the same age.
After the form-fitting fabric has been perfected and sent away for dyeing, Mr. Stark put Peter to work on some sort of holographic wrist display that will be added to the suit later on. With the help of the inventor, Peter put together a GPS tracking-system, along with a prototype for a small recon-drone.  But, as usual, while Peter helps with the basics, Mr. Stark keeps him out of the final product.
“So, when do you leave?” Tony asks, walking Steve by in an attempt to get away from him as soon as he can. But before he can even make it past the desk, he’s suddenly pulled back by his arm, turned around by Steve before the man puts his hands on the back of Tony’s head and presses their lips together. Tony’s eyes widen in surprise, but in just a matter of seconds he relaxes again. This is Steve; there’s no danger here at all.
“Let me do it,” Hilde says, kneeling down and reaching for the lever on Tony’s neck.
Sif shakes her head, but smirks in return, pulling out a little bag and offering it to Hilde without looking at her. She doesn’t seem upset, luckily.
“C’mon! I’m sure you can arrange something with Mr. Stark about the internship! He’s your dad, after all,” Ned counters. Peter jumps forward and waves his hands at him while making a shushing sound.
“I could just return another time,” Peter suggests then, and immediately Tony turns around to face him again. Only one look at Peter makes Tony realize that the boy seems a bit off, himself. There’s this strange expression in his eyes that make it clear that something is bothering him. The bags under his eyes indicate that he hasn’t had a good night’s rest in a while, and then there’s the fact that he looks like he’s actually shaking.
“I didn’t do it on purpose, Wade.” Yaël replied annoyed.
The second reason is mostly the fact that, when they couldn’t reach aunt May and they asked for another number, Peter gave out – how stupid though it is – Mr. Stark’s number instead. The woman, who took it, was new and has no idea what Peter’s home-situation is. So when Peter muttered something about ‘father’, the woman quickly came to the conclusion and called Mr. Stark so – which must have been very weird for the man.
. And so far, nothing’s happened that can’t be undone if you sign.”
“I’m Iron Man. And I need your help.”
“Do you see how much hair I have? You can’t do it all with one small bottle of paint!”
Tony blinks a few times, waiting for whatever orders he’s getting through her.
“Peter, you’re up!” Steve states the obvious, clutching his cup of coffee tightly before heading back to the counter to drop it there. Then he opens the fridge and starts taking out some eggs and what seems like bacon. “I’ll make some breakfast.”
“We were just saying, Mr. Stark, that we don’t think you’re taking the company’s best interest at heart,” Klaus says. Or, Tony thinks it’s Klaus. To be fair, he hasn’t been to these types of meetings in years. He’s still not really sure what he’s doing here right now.
There’s a loud noise on the other side, and then Tony cursing something.
“No way! We’ll find it one way or another!” Clint says, smashing his fist on the table. “And I know exactly who to ask!”
enjoy it with Gwen, that time. He had loved her, and as they slept together, Peter can’t say that he regrets it.
“Well, that’s my point,” Steve then says. “We’re… even… now.”
hard and could actually make it worse.
“Now,” the nurse said when she was done patching up Yaël’s hand once again “Don’t you dare to move!” And with that, the nurse walked out of the room, followed by Loki walking in.
Eventually it’s time to continue. They pick up right where they left off. Everybody throws in their notes, but Peter and the others of his age stay silent. They’re not experienced enough to know what exactly they’re supposed to say.
See any mistakes, don't be afraid to tell me.
Is it possible that Steve is actually happy with her? Maybe even happier than he could be with Tony?
Tony stays quiet again, but there’s shifting noises. Then footsteps; Tony is heading to the fridge and is taking out something to drink. Peter hurries towards the other side of the hallway, hoping that the man doesn’t see him.
“You’re right,” Sam admits. “It wasn’t cool of us…”
“What’s your name, kid?” Peter asks.
“He’s probably still doing his make-up,” Yaël added. Hulk shook from laughing, which kind of felt like an earthquake, so everyone in the area looked a bit startled at the green giant.
No, no way. There’s absolutely
He doesn’t hear what they’re saying, only that Steve looks extremely grateful, pressing a kiss on Tony’s cheek before pulling him inside. That’s when Peter loses sight of them, and decides not to linger any longer.
“Think we should go and pay a visit?” Steve squeezes Tony’s hand, looking at their fingers entwined together with a fond look on his face.
“That’s Adaro, right?”
- Vaguely written violence?
Thinking back of that day, Peter feels his chest tighten.
So, there’s enough reason to go for biochemistry, right? But, then, why do his eyes always move back to the electrical engineering folder on his bed?
the Yaël on the screen shouts, slurring over her words much like Peter does in the entire video. “
The knock on the door brings an annoyed groan out of Tony. They’re both very much aware of their state of undress, so Steve quickly reaches towards the duvet to cover them both. Tony keeps his forehead against Steve’s shoulder.
back when you were still with Pepper, and we had to constantly hear it. You could at least indulge us so I can collect my money.”
“Yeah, things are good,” Peter says with a shrug. “In college now, so life’s a bit busy.”
Mr. Stark just waves it off before facing Peter again. Then he nods towards the chair he had been sitting on, pointing at the backpack. Without having to say anything, Peter understands completely what he wants. He hurries back inside the office, takes his bag, and then hurries after Mr. Stark, who is already making his way out.
It’s clear, though, when he spots him carrying the coffin along with the other few family members. In the past two months, Peter has been introduced to Peggy’s children and grandchildren. He recognizes her son, Michael, along with her grandson George. Who-ever is walking on the other side, though, Peter can’t really see. But that doesn’t matter, because all he can seem to focus on is Steve, with red eyes looking like he’s trying everything he can to keep himself from crying.
“I know, but I also
Tony returned smugly. “
“What word would you use, Mr. Secretary?” she asks. Even from how she speaks, Tony can hear the slight smile on her face. Rhodey lowers his head for a bit before stretching his neck. Vision lifts his hand up to his chin to rub his skin in a strangely human gesture.
“I don’t understand, sir?”
“I know,” he says. “Can’t an old man just be happy to see his boy?”
“Sir,
Done deal.
Steve frees his foot without effort to full-on step on Tony’s cock. A free massage, so enticing, so loving… and Tony embraces it. The naughty sounds spilling from his lips are the sweetest hymns, and Steve fiddles with the remote some more, pushing a slider button up.
Great idea. Something’s sizzling, Tony’s nose doesn’t play tricks on him.
“… Thanks.”
“Jump!”
“Feet apart, Stark.”
“Uh,” he tries Steve’s number again. “No jumping over firewalls this time. Enough illegal activities for the day.” Steve kills his call again. “Come on…” He stows his phone in his pocket and grabs his jacket. He’s done, he’s leaving. It’s been a confusing day. He trusts SHIELD to save the world, he doesn’t trust SHIELD to save the world –
“It’s fine. It’s over anyway.”
“Yeah.” Steve, too studies his cooked dinner with interest. “You just boiled water with your hands.”
Regardless, it’s not like SHIELD could advertise a super-soldier slash World War II veteran vacancy and expect a queue of replacement candidates by Monday. So, Steve agrees to stick around until someone suitable crops up. Big shoes to fill, no doubt. He can work for
Gun shots – he hears guns going off like never before, and he’s sitting duck if he doesn’t get a move on. So are the paramedics. He sees them so spooked that they daren’t moved an inch. He leaps off the gurney and grabs two of them – the ones huddled nearest to him – and yells at the rest to get their butts off the floor and run.
let go, he hurls back to the door, tripping over when it opens and smashing headlong into the grass. He’s scalded – that’s all, nothing the serum can’t handle. It’s godawful painful, that tells him his nerve receptors are still all there.

What happens in San Diego, stays in San Diego.
He believes, all right? He
“Don’t worry about it.” Tony wipes his chin with the back of his hand. “I have tissue in the glove box. You want some?”
Does he even want to play this game? “Hey, Steve. Back from your leave, I see. How did it go?”
“Steve.” The syllable inflects with genuine surprise. “You came.”
will be.”
Tony snaps his fingers, and grabs his helmet. “If she could break into the ship’s mainframe, then I certainly can, too. She proved that the stuff wasn’t guarded by biometrics.” He puts on the helmet, and says, “JARVIS, the Lemurian Star. Is it online? Let’s go, go, go.”
“… I’m not going to.”
“… Unless what I’m smelling is your cologne, then I must be mistaken.”
“I’m not sure.”
“You’re welcome. Remember to sign off at the front desk. Have a good evening, Mr Stark.”
Steve has leapt off the dais and is expertly
“Close the door,” Tony bids him, fingers still doing a mad tango on his keyboard. “Lock it!”
“… Sorry,” Steve mumbles against Tony’s stomach. “Didn’t mean to.”
“Screw you, Cap, that’s what. Would you give me my screwdriver or not?”
By nightfall, Steve decides to hell with everything because he owes an old friend an apology for wrongly assuming Tony is doing this for kicks and giggles, as if this incident has no implications on him and his company at all. Steve brushes his teeth and waits until it’s close to nine o’clock, assuming Tony will be home at this hour, and then makes his ascend to Tony’s private suite again. The front door is unlocked, which itself is not odd. There’s minimal lighting escorting his way upstairs, also not odd. The bedroom door is ajar, and Steve drops his posture to a quiet creep, because
– and you fight back – and you
It’s all Tony can do to wheeze pitifully, waiting for the ultimate strike. Another hand – flesh and blood – that’s familiarly ruthless creeps under his shirt. Fingernails scrape against the valleys of his abdominal packs, but up and up the hand goes until its thumb scrapes against the housing of his arc reactor. Without slightest gust of a warning the assassin
For the longest hour, Tony stands under the icy cold shower with his palms flat against the smooth tiles. Water dribbles down his nose and chin. His mind is numb. Hollow. Which never happens. He doesn’t care about an engine, an arc reactor, an automated toaster – because mankind needs one of those. He only turns off the tap when his fingers become gnarly, and the Extremis taps into his noggin wondering if he wants to puff his flesh out. No, thanks.
“Right. A SHIELD assignment, then.” Tony steals another glance at the lady. A muscle in Steve’s cheek ticks. “Too bad. I’m all dressed up in a mechanic jumpsuit. My armours are all locked up in the vault, so –”
Stark Industries isn’t technically in charge of maintaining SHIELD’s weaponries and equipment, even if their top-secret projects
Tony scoffs. “Family, yes. To my old man.” He glances again at Howard’s portrait. “Anyway, you said you have work stuff to talk about. I’m all about work stuff today, Pep. Hit me.”
– Rogers!”
“They were here.” The knife eases off somewhat. “But the cradles are empty now. Where are they?”
“You keep saying that,” Steve growls, and pushes Tony bodily into the side of the car. He reclaims those lips, and ignores the glint of fire in those hazel irises. “You asked me to leave when you had palladium flooding your body. I didn’t, and it was fine. We pulled through! You’re asking me that again, and you think I’m finally gonna?” He grasps the front of Tony’s shirt, and slams him again into the car. “Can’t you see?” he pleads, the lasts of his syllable cracking. “Please,
“Pre-recorded, Sir.”
“OK, thank you. I’ll be right there,” and he wordlessly nods at Pepper, who nods back. “Let him know I’m on my way, will you?”
, to seek out Tony but this eight o’clock news is saying don’t bother
As Tony bullshits over the phone to save his hide and buy himself more time on the negotiations, Steve keeps his hands to a polite kneading around the shoulders. As the conversation gets more heated – read, Tony realises the purpose of this call isn’t just-checking but more like buck-up- incompetent-sack-of-shit – Steve lifts himself so he, too is kneeling on the massage bed, with his front almost flushed against Tony’s back. A hand comes to Tony’s front, and sits atop the crevice of his chest once more, minding its own business.
“Sure. Whoa.”
surrounding him. He’s a mess, God, he’s a mess in here, but he knows deep down that this is right. Gripping the edge of the case, he fully embraces the sweltering heat and flames, and completes the destruction of his arc reactor.
Tony’s back arches as he lets out a long, wanting sigh when Milos grasp his cock. The car swerves sharply to the left, and Tony grapples at the dash for support.
“Why did you go Jason Bourne on SHIELD?”
this latest shenanigan. It’s a problem of course to be under such microscopic scrutiny, but for Steve, this is doubly worse.
In the nick of time.
Infantry Regiment of the New York Army National Guard, before I selected him for the Howling Commando.”
What does Tony have to prove? That he’s a better SHIELD benefactor than his father before him?
That, Tony has nothing against.
It gets hotter, and steamier. He blames the shower. Steve pushes himself up against Tony, all kinds of liquid lubricating the friction. Polyester on barren buttocks, hot breaths on ruddy cheeks. He can get used to this. Is this Tony’s reward, or his?
“Nope,” Tony blurts out, as Steve goes to his trolley of wonder oils and lotions.
Rounding a block somewhere downtown, he parks his car near a back alley and pulls the handbrake up. The crank jolts Tony from his stupor.
“Of course not. That would immediately expose HYDRA’s base of operation to the world. Camp Lehigh isn’t SHIELD’s anymore, is it?” The camp is abandoned. Annihilated, last time he checked.
it and it breaks off, and his hand falls to his side.
“Miss Potts is the CEO of Stark Industries,” Tony interjects. “Assuming you’re here on behalf of our government, and that means whatever you have in that envelope right there,” he looks pointedly at Ross’ hand, “is a proposition either for me, or my tech. In any case, you’ll have to deal with her directly as the patents are wholly held by the company, not me.”
“Sir!”
Steve runs his fingers through his hair. “Fine. Can you patch this line to Miss Potts’, please? She should be at the Malibu campus.”
“You’re a sick puppy, you know that?”
“Come on. Work on it.”

“No, Sir.”
That sounds criminal-ish.

“Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull,” Steve replies coolly. “He’s been dead for years.”
“I was thinking, maybe lunch?” Steve offers Tony the hefty folder. “You might find this interesting.”
Tony runs his fingers through his hair, and splutters the one thing that’s perhaps, the most sensible thing he ever spouted today. “Join me for lunch?”

“Tony,” Steve unfolds his arms as he addresses the room. “Zola wrote Insight algorithm from Camp Lehigh. He didn’t mean to launch it from there.”
And that’s how they remain for the rest of the duration. Tony doesn’t return to the passenger seat, and Steve doesn’t demand it. That’s good. That’s
“They’re gone, Tony.” He brings the tablet closer to Tony’s stomach. “The scars around the arc reactor. They’re gone. You said you were on your suit’s life support. You don’t have even have a bruise.”
And Tony smirks, “Because I say so. I can also do… this!”
Even then, he keeps his gaze fixed on Maria’s name, eyes glazing over and don’t blink. It’s a sorrowful sight. Apt, but Steve doesn’t wish it upon him. To Steve, those twenty years since Howard’s passing are nothing. Timeless. He never knew Maria. Tony obviously loved her.
“No.” These eggs are delicious! His compliments to the chef. “He’s supposed to be here. We’re scheduled for a meeting with Senator Briggs in DC next Tuesday, there are concerns that we need to discuss over before we lay out recommendations.” Natasha’s phone chimes, and Steve takes a swig of coffee from Clint’s mug. “It’s not sustainable for Stark Industries to be billed continually for damages, not when Tony is already privately funding the Avengers operation. The President wishes to transfer that authority to a new subcommittee called Damage Control. It’s not…” Under the table, Natasha seems to be sliding her phone over to Clint, who looks down to his lap and gapes at whatever it is that’s playing on the screen. “… an arrangement that Tony is comfortable with. Is there something going on that I need to aware of?”
“We have intel that he’s last sighted in this area.”
“… Fantastic customer service indeed. Thank you.”
Milos probably finished about the time he stops beating on the driver’s seat.
Bon appétit, suckers.
“I have nightmares.”
For he hears what Clint doesn’t, and he’s brought this unto himself: “
He hops into his car and heads to this warehouse Stark Industries has in DC. There are still people working at the front despite the late hours, forklifts manning the crates. He gives the workers two short honks, winds down the window to stick his hand out and waves, and promptly parks his car behind the block.

getting on my nerves.”
They’re screwed.
Before long, the Triskelion looms in the vicinity.
Steve will find him.
a full tank of gas. No cash, too bad, but Tony hopes to charm his way into the cash register sitting on the table right there. They don’t need much, some change perhaps for emergencies. There’s only so many coins one can find in the nook and cranny of a stolen car.
He remembers helping a

The hair on his neck stands on end when Steve stops folding his towels. His ego and downstairs brain hazard a guess and say his proud erection has commanded Steve’s attention. He quickly slips into the flimsy paper pants on when Steve’s chair scrapes against the floor.
Tony takes two seconds to roll his eyes and discards plastic packaging under his seat. “Of course it’s a trap.”

What a way to teach the great Tony Stark some humility.
Her nostrils flare, and Tony’s not sorry. “He said to call Dr Streiten from SHIELD medical if your symptoms get worse. I asked him what was going on with you
Steve’s the pro. He politely removes himself from Tony, and backs away to the corner of the room where his stacks of folded towels are. “Are you alright, Mr Stark?”
“… Are you on stand-by? Any alerts from SHIELD?”
Coffee spills onto the table top when Tony laughs into his mug. “Wow – talk about silver lining.” He holds his phone out, and Steve takes it. “It’s the Senator. Read her e-mail.”
“A recording, or it didn’t happen.”
“What? Insert Tab A,” Tony taps at Steve’s
Oh? This is what it’s about? Naughty, naughty, Anna Smith. So, Tony toasts his drink in mocked acknowledgement, and keeps his trap shut. His squeaky Teletubby voice will only do him a disservice.
“Let me in. Steve!”
male voice, actually. “I’m wondering if you’d like to book your last session with us this evening?”
There it is again. The attitude, that haughty dismissal. So maybe Steve doesn’t have the right to presume so much. He huffs solemnly, and casts his eyes to the stained carpet. “Be that as it may, I don’t wish to take advantage of your hospitality. Not like this. I don’t mean to – to be ungrateful, God knows, Tony the times I spent here in the Tower, with everyone have been the times I felt most alive.”
“Do we need to ration our food?”
Breathe. Just…
“You know the way in and out that building.” Steve nods, affirmative. “You know which room they’ll use. The people likely to be made in-charge of the launch.”
, seeking more friction. “Live life a bit, Cap. You want this.”
“It’s from a movie that…”
Tony exhales air from his lungs, deep and long and regains control of himself in that split of second. By the time Clint comes back with a glass half-filled, Tony is long gone, yet Steve still kneels on the carpet, distraught and beaten.
“What?” Tony’s grin fades somewhat. “You look like you’d seen a ghost.”
And they both scramble like the Devil himself is visiting. Tony scoots from under the car and readjusts his jeans while Steve turns the remote off, and checks Tony over from head to toe, just in case. Then right on cue, Fury ambles in between tall stacks of engineering thingummies, looking dapper in his trademarked leather trench coat and eyepatch.
“Very. But!” Even his back straightens up. “SHIELD isn’t going to expect this. Crawlers typically take months to do their job. Their cyber guard dogs will be looking for malicious ware, not this. Let me do this. It’s
“Where are your suits?”
“I’m glad, Tony. I’m really glad he’s with you.”
Steve walks back to his room with two sets of sandwiches and steaming coffee, void of sugar and creamer. They don’t stock up on the finer things in this warehouse. He knocks on the Iron Man door twice, and opens it anyway when they go unanswered. At least Tony hasn’t locked him out of spite. Tony himself is lying on the second bed, his back against the door so Steve can’t see his face. No matter, Steve sighs, and closes the door behind him.
“Yeah, my downstairs brain has been thinking… that I’m ready to try something new.” Then, Tony tugs Steve’s waistband down to the knees, and playfully cups at Steve’s taut sacs. “Fuck me.”
“We can help, too,” the young Agent’s chair scraps on the floor as he stands. Fury’s men have spunk. “What do you need us to do, Captain?”
“Hey,” Tony offers a hand, and they shake it, palms as cold as ice. “Where are you from? Any interesting projects I should hear about?”
Coldly, Tony comments, “I might need to have a word with
let’s be honest, the original rotating blades on the Helicarriers are so ‘Final Destination’ they make me super gassy just thinking about them.”
“Sir, stay calm.”
Maria has with her a tablet – StarkTech, Tony notices – and her mouth twitches when she activates the holographic display. “We have quite a lot on our plate to clear, Agents. Preferably in the next twelve hours. The single most immediate threat is this.” She taps once on the screen, and three majestic Helicarriers float in space. “Insight Helicarriers. Once they reach three thousand feet, they’ll triangulate with Insight satellites becoming fully weaponised.”
“Walk faster,” Steve eventually hisses, his patience running thin. “What are you playing at?”
He steadies himself with a deep breath, and marches out of the park, the Iron Man helmet wedged safely under his arm.
And from the tail of his eye, Tony stirs. That’s his cue. He owes an apology to his team. Most of all to Tony, Tony who is still jerking where he lies, eyes squeezed shut and lips twitching in discomfort.
“The table is fine.”
“Will you go look for him?”
is incapacitated, it’s anarchy. It might get bad enough that Fury decides he is the country’s best-suited benevolent dictator and nuke Capitol Hill after brunch.
The few other Agents they rode in here with take hold of Tony’s arms and twist them around his back with immaculate efficiency. They shove him face-first against the side of the truck, and Steve’s body flickers. His first instinct is to pull them off their prey, but he stays his grounds, his teeth clenching when handcuffs are fastened around Tony’s wrists.
“It’s my pleasure to, ah,”
“What are you going to do?” Tony asks and his philtrum itches and he wants to scratch it, but if the nanofiber coating comes off, his moustache will show on his lady-face, and since the circus isn’t in town…
The temperature must’ve dipped several degrees, and Ross’s cool smile widens. “You are quite mistaken, Mr Stark. What I have
“… OK.”
“Guys?” Clint is holding his bow up, and the sudden loss of explosive chaos is momentarily disorienting. “I ran out of arrows. Sorry, I used them all up, Stark. They’re awesome.”
He shoots back up to the second ship adjacent and gives it his best. As he reclaims his place in the line of spitting exhausts, stabilises flight amidst vortices as sweltering as three thousand and two hundred Centigrade, Tony sees now – as clear as ever – the price tag slapped on freedom. It’s hellfire and brimstone and heart-stilling fear for failure. His stabiliser is overworked, and the heat seeps through gold titanium alloy that Tony gnashes his teeth so hard because he
“OK,” Tony hits the ‘Enter’ key. “Done deal. I’m uploading to the Net.”
“Welcome back, Sir. It’s my greatest pleasure to continue working with you.”
feels the effects however momentarily before his superpowers digest them – neutralise them – to render these xenobiotics ineffective. He ought to rename his powers, by the way. Christen it with a cool moniker. Cooler than “Captain America” and regrettably, “Iron Man”.
“… I do, Tony.”
“A quick check on the registry tells me when you’re checking out.”
It’s incredible, and Tony knows it. Steve feels a growing smile on the edge of his lips.
“I know what this is. What it does,” Steve comments impassively, and pushes the rest of the fabric off Tony’s back. “I won’t use it against you. That, I promise.”
“He made that plenty clear.” Tony does need one gadget – his cell phone, which he'd tossed recklessly onto his in-tray on his workbench. “Wonder what SHIELD is up to these days?”
“You need to cancel all business we have with SHIELD. Every one of them.”
“The wall’s a bit thin around here. Don’t worry, we don’t judge. But seriously,
Tony suddenly falls so quiet, it’s unnerving.
He tugs violently against his bonds, but they won’t give. He’s effectively chained to his cot, upended to hold him in a standing position. This isn’t the afterlife either, this is his garage. His collection of supercars looks pristine on the other side, his computers are – to his horror – still turned on, running some programmes that he doesn’t recognise. He twists his neck to the far right – thank God – the rows of cradles meant to house an Iron Man each have all been vacated.
“Something magical is happening.” Man says it with his mouth slightly agape, eyes locking with Steve's, his expression stricken, and slowly his eyeballs careen to the workstation where Tony is at. Steve really,
? Really? Wow. I should be on the lookout for pigs with wings anytime now…”
Not Dum-E. It’s just a
whom his saintly colleagues describe as always knee-deep in pussies on Friday nights – getting off after a handjob. By another male.
Sighing dramatically, Tony puts his helmet down and lifts the hem of his oversized shirt. The bluish glow of his arc reactor casts shadows around them. “I’m the best-looking floor lamp this side of America.”
“Where’s Nat?” Tony bites out, and turns to face the wall. He flattens his palms against the tiles that are slowly heating up with the water.
a walking billboard that resurrection is possible! It’s not that far-fetched, Tony.”
Glass shattering, walls crumbling. The very foundation of his mansion shakes with renewed vigour as all thirty Iron Man suits of armour undock, ready to flee.
“Tony Stark is not an enhanced individual. That may be an imposter.”
That’s the grand plan? Letting loose a flammable genius billionaire into the wilderness. There are dried twigs everywhere, he’ll be the reason this side of America record the largest bush fire on the planet.
“Welcome back to the living.”
in which the sky is the limit.”
“Tony, you –”
“If I may offer my unsolicited opinion,” JARVIS interrupts. Steve holds his tablet up and sees a map coming onto his screen. “I suggest rendezvousing here.” A marker blinks at the centre, which happens to be about fifteen minutes’ drive away from where he’s parked. It’s a quiet suburb. Somewhat upscale. People tend to go about their own business low-key.
