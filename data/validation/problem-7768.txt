“Please be mine . Don’t lose the faith in me babe “ Steve pressed thier forhead together and closed his eyes .
Tony opened his eyes and closed them because of the strong light
He punched Steve
“You gonna be ok shit head.” Tony said to Ross and smirked when he saw how much Ross was scared.
That’s true he could never be a hero like them.
He left Peter looking at his hands on his thighs, he preferred Tony beating him better than ignoring him.
He sighed and grabbed a cushion from the couch. He winced when he tried to stood but he ignored the pain and puts the cushion under Steve’s head so he wouldn’t have any neck pain.
"Come on shorty let's go." Tony teases him and Bruce rolled his eyes.
B : No friends!
“Yes sir.” He swears that if his AI had a face she would be so much worried.
He looked to see Sharon sitting in his place where he was sitting and resting his head on Steve’s chest .
“But I don’t care for her . I’m with Tony “ Steve said looking up at Nick .
he look around him there’s nothing but Steve
“Sir are you ok ?” FRIDAY asked him and Tony smiled
Tony was sitting on the chair.
“I saw him Tony... the one who was abusing me when I was only 7, he still got the power over me. I... I couldn’t do anything I just stood in front of him and the fear climbed me. I felt so weak.... Fury told me that when I’m strong again he’ll let me go to missions.. He doesn’t know that this man has power over me, Tony I’m scared that he’ll be free again and try to kill me.”
“U-uncle Th-” He was cutted by Thor again.
Steve was shocked. Tony’s tears immediately fall.
"Rest." That's all He got for their talk. Yeah The winter soldier is not active for small chitchats.
what about Steve?  He’ll broke apart if he remembered what happened and maybe he’ll kill everyone in the tower then kill him self?
He asked but there’s no answer.
“No, Happy I will be fine I promise.” Happy nodded but Tony can see the doubts in his eyes.
She’s a bitch don’t lose it Tony. Don’t lose it. Control yourself! You can do it. You can do i-
"I know captain, we will know where they're keeping them." She tried her best to comfort him while she was wiping the blood from her blades.
He wish that he could back in time and tell them that it’s ok we can start a new part of our life, but he was so selfish.
And Tony... Tony never even acknowledged him as anything other than that guy Anton was dating now. Tony didn’t think his engineering was good. Tony didn’t find him intelligent. And Tony certainly didn’t find him that interesting.
Anton is forced to don on his own emergency Ironman armor, but of course, while it’s far more advanced than before, Anton hardly uses it as often as Tony. He defeats whip man, Vanko, obviously, but the suit is horribly damaged.
Tony, Ironman was already deemed suitable for the Avengers Initiative on a part-time basis. Part-time partly because SHIELD is squeamish about bringing in anyone when they don’t have a solid grasp on their personality or background, and partly because neither Anton nor Tony were very interested in working under SHIELD in the first place. They were used to being the bosses of their own thing, they had each other, Pepper and Rhodey as their team, they’re able to let my Ironman out with the public and government’s blessing, and honestly, it wasn’t like they weren’t capable of retrieving whatever information SHIELD has as well.
Pepper Potts was the best thing that's happened to the Stark twins.
“Well, I mean,” Tony hesitates because he’s not exactly
The Stark twins may not have nailed the first impression, but they certainly leave a lasting one.
“Please, I am Agent Phil Coulson,” the man says courteously, but with as little emotional inflection one could possibly make without coming off cold. It was like the man screamed unassuming and bland. While Tony and he had done some research about SHIELD they hadn’t really personally met anyone from there other than Fury and Natasha. However Natasha had come off the whole situation looking incompetent and like any other corporate spy that exploited their good looks, and Fury had quite a… personality that suited a drill sergeant than a spy. Phil Coulson though, that’s the sort of guy Anton and Tony always imagined a real spy would be like.
Anton raises an eyebrow, “Okay, now I’m intrigued- by the way, I would bang Loki, date Thor and marry Ironman.”
“He’s a fucking dick, that’s what he is,” Tony scoffs angrily, “Look, now DUM-E’s all scared and I spent ages trying to teach him to be kid friendly! And I ended up shouting at him in front of the children Anton! The
The older Stark twin gasped for air desperately, thrashing as much as he could just to be able to get barely a lungful of much needed oxygen before once again he was pushed face first in the dirty water. Scratch that. They were total dicks.
“What do you want then, Agent?” Anton does not sulk.
It starts like this.
In the end it was Rhodey who intervened.
Anton would lead the press by the nose with a winning smile, a glass of scotch in one hand and his brother by his side, adding any technical jargon he'd missed. Tony would shine in his research and inventions, his own pride shown to the clients and his fellow scientists with his brother oozing in the real charm to smooth the path to a successful negotiation.
JARVIS pauses for a bit before he complies.
Anton shuffled his feet uncomfortably, which meant that Tony needed to put down the wrench and pull all focus onto his brother because nervous shuffling meant feelings, genuine ones too. "That wasn't what I meant." Anton backtracked. "I meant that I may have... emotions. Toward Pepper. That may or may not be slightly stronger than what I feel for one night stands."
Maybe in a different universe Tony only had one copy of the new arc reactor and was forced to use his original one in the fight against Stane. But that was in a universe where Tony was alone and had to fight to juggle the press, the company, and Ironman, alone.
The gasps and hushed whispers were louder now. Anton can practically hear the room, how they immediately blame Obadiah for treason, greed and the loss of a Stark twin. With two words he has the whole room. Anton should feel guilty for doing this, using his brother, himself, but it was for himself, for his brother, for the both of them that he deceives.
to help you and you’re just, just signing off your will, giving up!”
But Tony can’t stop now, not when they’ve finally started doing something he knows in his bones is
Stane falls.
Anton finds out. Of course he does.
Nick Fury knew about Vanko.
Well, until the whole ‘alien invasion’ thing.
"I said," The older twin clears his throat, "I don't want to be Tony Stark anymore." He looks at his twin, pleading, "I want to be Ironman, I want to be
Tony scoffs, “Yeah right.”
If Hammer wants Tony’s attention, he’s certainly got it now. Instead of ignoring the man, he goes out of his way to point out what Hammer’s done wrong, his inventions, his clothes, his handling of his staff. Try and correct him. Help him.
“Tony, don’t,” Anton sobs, “don’t.”
Okay, maybe Natasha just wants to have brunch with Pepper.
"But I had to." Anton sobbed. "I had to watch
Justin would come to any event the twins attended. He would try wow Tony with second-hand knowledge and second tier inventions despite even his best work barely up to par with Anton’s, well, maybe not worst works, but definitely down there.
Obie was... he was the cool uncle they always had. He let them into a boardroom meeting once, he listened to their ramblings and ideas, he even once asked to use one of their designs as a product to be marketed. Tony liked Obie a lot. But Anton, Anton looked up to him.
Natasha respected the hell out of her.
"Oh god, oh god, shit, fuck, shit, Tony," Anton mutters under his breath, his hands are trembling violently as he helps some random stranger practically shove a car battery in his brother's chest. He's never been good with stuff like this, he went completely vegan for six months because he saw twenty minutes of one of those animal torture fast food documentaries. He would've gone longer but... Well.. Bacon.
Tony fiddled with his hands awkwardly. "Promise, more like forced to agree under duress." He mutters snidely, because if there's one thing the Starks all have, other than amazing intellect, it's the inherent need to avoid all gooey emotions when possible.
It doesn’t work. For some reason, Hammer got even more obnoxious and annoyingly needy. Anton says he’s doing it wrong. Tony doesn’t give a fuck. He has no fucks. His fucks for Hammer have flown off like geese in migration season that have gotten shot down by trigger-happy hunters and are never coming back. Why? Because he hates Hammer.
She was pretty, and patient, and once she finally got a decent footing around the whole billionaire genius twin thing, she became the snarky badass in heels who took no shit. Tony loved her. Anton was in love with her.
They break out.
. Which isn’t exactly ethical now, but the point is they, at one point, had consumed dried whale meat in Japan. And jellyfish noodles. And haggis. But not shawarma.
Tony then would purse his lips in that way that conveyed he was beyond unimpressed at the explanation. “I think fast.” He says sulkily. “Remember when we saw dad’s blueprints and I immediately found his mistake? That was super fast.”
"Wait. What?"
“I better,” Tony mutters as he remembers the absolute reaming he got from their father afterward. God Tony hates how stupid he is at this stuff. Why couldn’t people be like math problems and be satisfied with one answer?
Rhodey and Pepper do not agree.
Okay, so when Anton said sufficiently prepared he meant just enough not to jump in shock at the intruder but definitely not enough for a clever quippy pun. If Tony were here they could play it off, make a fun game of it in front of the agent but unfortunately, Tony is playing dead and trying to figure out how some stupid secret agency managed to hack JARVIS well enough for them not to have noticed the breach in security.
“Give me a minute, I need to finish off the suit for Rhodey,” Tony mutters, eyes glued onto a hologram with schematics for a new suit in front of him. He needs to fit more ammunition in somehow, Rhodey is more fight than flight type of guy so he’ll discard the streamline design for a little more built.
“I didn’t,” Anton would shrug back, puzzled at why someone as smart as his brother couldn’t understand, “S’just quick thinking that’s all.”
one was brutal.
It's impossible for anyone to tell who's who between the Stark twins save for the twins themselves. They smile the same way and they chatter with the same bright, polite manner and they even move in perfect sync when they want to.
Pepper learned that if you wanted the suave businessman you called the younger Stark, and if R&D needed help the elder Stark was the one to summon. That they were both sweet and funny and thoughtful in their own weird, eccentric convulsed ways.
“You told him that he should try getting into baking because it’s probably more his speed,” Anton says flatly.
Tony and Anton Stark were identical only in face.
“Ironman is one of us,” Rhodey growls possessively, apparently far more angry than Pepper about founding a spy in their midst. Though in reality, it is Pepper that is probably leagues above in rage than Rhodey, a shouting outburst from her means anger, but it’s when she gets all quiet and smiley that’s when you should really be afraid.
A few weeks after the return from Afghanistan. After Obie’s betrayal. Obie’s death. Anton asked Pepper out to her favorite Italian place.
tower, come on.
Tony was the oldest, he was the genius, the polite, shy, quiet one that liked to tinker and ask questions. Anton was the youngest, the smart-mouth, the confident loud firecracker that liked trouble and explosions. But it wasn't like they hadn't also had their share of similarities too. They were both bright, intelligent little boys that shared the same burning curiosity in their veins, the same hero worship of Captain America and the same need to please their father.
. To do
“Wha- why are we adding more rules to this?!” Tony groans, and also, he knows they need to keep their covers but ugh, so much ew.
Knowing exactly what Tony was thinking Anton makes the verbal equivalent of a scowl. “Or one they could control like Captain Popsicle.”
It wasn’t supposed to be like this.
Rhodey at the time. He seethed every time Tony brought him up like a jealous lover and the first time the two ever met, Anton had straight out declared Rhodey as his arch-nemesis over brunch.
"I hope he falls into a well." Anton hissed as he helps a shaking Tony up from the ground. Tony gave a weak laugh at that.
The applause was outstanding.
That was another thing they shared.
“But that’s a different thing ain’t it?” Anton frowns back. “I mean, maybe it’s just cuz you don’t like crowds and all the pressure and stuff you blanked then. You’ll probably get used to it.”
SHIELD’s leader was a one eyed guy named Nick Fury.
“I’m not sure that I appreciate that being the only reason you’ll accept my ring on your finger, Doctor.” Tony laughed, earning a small twitchy smile from the other.
Rhodey was Tony's roommate in college. In less than two weeks, a roommate had become a friend and in a month, a friend had been elevated to best friend. The brother from another mother. Tony's grumpy giant honey bear.
Howard Stark was frankly overjoyed when he heard the unexpected news. He had barrelled into the room with a wide grin and zoned onto his tired wife and the bundles in her arms like one of his recently created homing missiles. Howard's always prided himself in his plans and blueprints and failsafes, but he had never foreseen this.
Nick Fury was a fucking dickbag.
God, he loves that woman.
When Tony and Anton were twenty-one, their parents died in a car crash. They became the heads of Stark Industries overnight. They finished off six bottles of their father's most expensive bottles of alcohol that same night.
You want to fake your own death," And
"Oh my god," He gasped, "She thought, that
“Tony, come on, he’s just... maybe try to pay him some attention?”
Anton massaged his temples, he was always the more emotionally mature out of the pair, “For fuck's sake Tony, just compliment him and he’ll... well actually he definitely won’t back off but he’ll be less desperately aggressive about everything.”
“You could say Ironman is our little... mascot.” That earned a few chuckles from the reporters and small whispers of smiles from the government agents. Anton’s grin only faded once the laughter did, “Ironman shows the world StarkIndustries refuses to be used by terrorists, to be manipulated. Ironman is our offensive defense and I refuse to cross that thin threshold between that and turning Ironman into an outright weapon by giving it up to the military.”
The Agent immediately complies, looking at the woman with far more fear and respect, which, while completely understandable, does not make it any less rude. Like, come on. He doesn’t want to be that guy but it’s
Worse. Anton is damaged.
Tony fights with Anton's work powering his heart and he thinks how right it feels.
That was also a valid point. Recently, especially that last two years or so, mutant activity was starting to form and gain attention, opinions on them were varied and unfortunately skewed toward the negative. It would’ve been much more beneficial to have picked a mutant for the Avengers Initiative in the long run.
Tony bit his lip, Anton knew exactly how he would feel when he pulled out the ‘I’m the dumb twin card.’ After all, Anton may be lower in IQ but he certainly ran circles around Tony with EQ. Bastard.
Natasha's eyes glinted in the exact way the Stark genius knew meant knives would be coming up soon. He shuffled nervously closer to his workshop desk and wondered briefly why he hadn't thought of designing an anti-knife force field or something. That would have been
Tony is the planner, the calculator. He is the architect that builds and devises and creates the impossible from the possible. Anton is the wild card, the artist. He is the designer to his brother’s architect, polishing, improving and finding the possible from the impossible. Together they are unstoppable. Together they’re ready for anything.
“No Tony,
"I have literally never heard of that in my life."
"You are strong," Anton protests annoyed, but his voice sounds suspiciously choked. Not that Tony's doing much better. "You protected me from those bastards, if you hadn't decided to be such a stupid idiot and pretended to be me when I clearly didn't need the help-"
Anton told Pepper and Rhodey and Happy about Tony’s condition. Because while the two both share a stubbornness that could move mountains, it’s surprisingly Tony that has too much pride to admit his shortcomings. Anton is prideful sure, but he’s willing to throw that pride away and snitch like a little bitch if he realizes that it’ll get him what he wants.
Captain America would be disappointed in both of them. That was also another thing they had in common.
Not one but two. Two babies. Two boys. Two heirs.
"Scotch?" Tony Stark offers as he lifts the head plate up.
And Miss Virginia ‘Pepper’ Potts especially was… formidable.
The thing is, even with Tony's shy charm and Anton's charismatic personality, neither could really nail the whole first impression thing. Rhodey's first impression of Tony was a drunk horny rich kid, and Anton was a crazy psycho who just heavily implied murder to his face. Pepper got arrogant crass walking sexual harassment lawsuit waiting to happen from Anton and rude, callous, know it all from Tony.
The third fight was about Rhodey.
“Four minutes and sixteen seconds,” Tony replies smugly.
"It's Yinsen. And you need rest." The other man replies, "They'll be coming back to check on us soon."
Anton Stark dies in Afghanistan. Anton Stark becomes Tony Stark. Tony Stark becomes Ironman. It's brilliant.
“I love you.” Tony murmurs and then he ends the call.
Unfortunately, Justin was a little too hungry for better things. He wanted the ‘better’ twin in his opinion. He wanted the smarter one. He wanted Tony. He wanted to
"Tony." Anton looks devastated, every bit the younger brother that he never tries to be.
Tony also did
Natasha originally thought the assignment beneath her. Watch over Tony Stark? Child’s play.
Even fighting, they are in sync, their hips swaying to the same beat and there is never a point in the dance where they truly separate from each other. There’s a point where it almost looks like the pair is about to break the growing furious tension with a kiss, the ultimate act of sinful depravity and yet an entrancing vision of symmetry. It leaves the viewers breathless. Wanting.
Fuck. Tony owed Anton so much money after this.
Tony was too quiet, too shy, too
"I've seen the papers. I've heard the reports. That's why I want to put an end to all this wild speculation. The truth is-"
“Did you not see me yelling at Hammer’s incompetence for five minutes straight?” Tony snaps, “How is that not giving him my attention, because believe me, most people would beg for me to tell them where they went wrong.”
Inside the quinjet, Anton chortles as he listens in.
It takes him about a month and a half. Usually, it would’ve been much faster considering their almost unhealthy dependence on each other but the younger twin had been on cloud nine since Pepper had started dating him.
There was literally nothing SHIELD could offer the twins that would benefit them save some extra firepower. And even then it was a little iffy.
They had burst into the dance hall with sunglasses on and suits so expensive they could probably exchange them for a relatively cheap car. Tony with a jacket and pants colored with a deep red, just one tone above the darkness of blood, and Anton glittering in gold, they had no ties, but a handkerchief of their twins’ colors folded in their breast pockets.
"Ironman's identity would be a secret between us so no one could target you guys as well," Tony tacks on enthusiastically, his face, usually so worn down since Afghanistan, even before that really, was earnestly bright and smiling. Anton personally would have been a bit more elaborate, pressing that argument with multiple scenarios where Pepper and Rhodey, even Happy, could be in danger because of them.
Nick Fury was the one who planted Natasha Romanov.
"Antonio." He finally decides, "You'll be Antonio Steven Stark."
They started walking again and Tony thinks that Steve is the one who ordered them to be nice with Tony, cause after what happened with Steve that night he wakes up to find himself in the bed and Steve sitting on a chair near him. So Steve started coming down to Tony’s lab with food or to just sketch there and Tony found it comforting in some how. Sometimes Steve will give Tony kisses on the forhead, cheeks and near to his lips, but not on the lips. maybe it was Steve’s way to apologize about something he did right.
And now Nick wants to put Tony away from him and that’s really hard on him .
“What ?” Steve said
Thor was a good friend to him and he was ready to collapse in front of him because he did not judge anyone and this is what distinguishes him from everyone.
Maybe he’ll get better as long as this kid stays here.
when The kiss finished Steve looked down at him his eyes opened wide
He opened his eyes slowly to find Tony resting his head on Steve's chest while Clint and Natasha standing at the window. Thor and Bruce were talking quietly. Loki and Bucky in no place to be seen.
“Oh I see “ was all Tony answer
After 5 months:
"He'll make it." Bucky whispers to him and all Steve can do is breaking down and sobbing.
“Tony? Fury called me and Steve for a mission and when he told us about the mission it was to earn Sharon’s trust by getting closer to her just for Hydra and no one can do that only Steve,”Natasha start to explains to him.
“So when they’ve died your aunt was protecting you even when you’re an avenger. So after that she’s now a human cause the other angels knows that she’s helping you . And now she’s ill and they’re searching for you to kill you “ Loki said looking at the ground when he finished .
“He’s in the kitchen boss.” Jarvis replied and Tony went to the kitchen. He stumbled on the road, but he didn’t care. All he cares about is Peter.
“Well he was in the space we don’t know what happened to him “ Thor said to him
“ You’re putting my boyfriend behind you ?! away from me ?” Steve said taking step forward and Thor too .
Steve had no choice but following them .
“Can I ask you a favor for one last time?” He asked avoiding to make eye contact with anyone of them and they nodded to him.
“I told you to ignore them.”Loki whispered to him and Tony rolled his eyes.
“Yeah, You are.” He start walking again but Clint pushed him to the wall this time.
The avengers ignoring him or mocking him or saying mean words to him or humiliate him. And he was friendly with them even when they’re treating him like he’s the dirt in their shoes.
Everyone joined the hug after that and there was no sound at all.
Why can’t he just be just obvious with him ?
He nodded and go out of the car. Happy go out with him to help him carry his bags.
Just seeing Tony gets pleasured by another one its killing him .
"Come in!" He yelled and then he brushed his teeth fast and go out to see who's waiting for him.
“Hey babe” Steve welcomed him and kissed his forhead. Tony kissed Steve’s lips and hugged him tightly .
He kept helping people and when it was 7 he sighed and left to get back to his house.
“Dad enough, please.” He sighed and stood. he knows that he can’t walk away without telling them anything but there’s no lie in his gead right now so he had to.
“So who’s going to share the room with us?” Tony asked and Clint smirked.
“It’s just w-when I was in bed with her I turned to Hulk and it’s still hunting me... I can’t forget about what happened Tony! It’s hard really hard. She was so scared, she told me to never talk to her again. Do you know what’s worse than what happened? It’s hard to get near anyone again, I felt that I’m a monster Tony...” Tony knows that Bruce was talking about his ex. God he wishes that he knows what’s she was thinking about. He hates her for hurting his best friend.
Tony go back to his room and the first thing he did was taking of his shirt and standing infront of the mirror .
“Fri?” Friday understand him without saying anything she locked the lab.
Why now? Why Ross wants to destroy him! Why Steve now told him that he thought there’s something between them? He knew one thing for now.. He’ll end this mess right now.
“Well you’re kissing him alot and you didn’t give me a kiss ! I need only a one kiss “ Steve said looking upset
“The rest of the avengers with Steve “ Loki said crouching infront of Tony and Bruce
And when Tony kissed him for the first time it’s like his dream had came true and the more important thing that he told him he loves him . And when they had sex for the first time Steve saw Tony’s scar on his chest and he was shocked .who could hurt a beautiful one like Tony ? Who would want to break this beautiful heart? . After the first time Tony never took off his shirt again. Steve will see his chest only when Tony is taking a shower he will come and have sex with him and see his beautiful chest and heart.
There was Thor , Loki and Bruce.
He’s not going to let her or let them control him again. He was about to lose Peter. If someone tried to stood in his face he’ll kill him even if it was Steve.
He sighed and the tears rolled down again
He heard Loki shouts his name, but he can’t go back.
“I told you to back with the others ! I told you to go back with them all ! but you ? you decided to do what you want ! you’re killer” Stephan said walking to Tony and Tony taking steps back
They were celebrating after defeating Ultron Tony was drunk but he can realize everything
he was sitting
“Come on Thor is waiting for you with Bruce “ Loki said still smiling to Tony .
“Birdbrain! My favorite! I made sure that your family is safe so don’t need to worry about it and I informed her so she’s coming after three days from now.” He smiled to Clint and Clint just kept giving him the same glares.
Tony’s smile dropped and he found the floor is interesting so he kept looking at it and Bruce gave him the time but he was pissed off and Tony wasn’t talking so Bruce sighed and Tony looked up at him.
Clint chuckled and then it fades and tear slipped down his cheek.
“That’s ENOUGH!” Rhodey snaps and shushed everyone. Tony didn’t even notice that they were arguing. “All of you going to work things together! You’re all made mistakes! It’s not only Tony who made it! Steve and Bucky made mistakes too! You little butch witch, made mistakes and killed dozens of people! So I’m going to calm the fuck down and try not to kill you when I see all of you against Tony.”
"You ok there?" His dad said softly and he nods.
He sighed and shook his head to get rid of his thoughts.
Seriously Tony ? Nothing important? You’re important to me you idiot!
He made everything worse and worse. He was such a disappointment. They run and run, fire behind them, an explosions happen behind them, but all they care about was getting to safety.
“No . It’s over.He chose her .I chose you . “ Tony puts his fingers to lift Thor’s chin .
“What– why?” He moved her a little so now they were looking into each other eyes.
“It’s not our job to tell you. It’s Peter’s” Stephan said and Peter sighed in relief.
"Good night sweetheart."
Then Sharon come to him and hugged him but he wasn’t buying attention to her.
He never felt this happy for seeing Captain and Thor.
"Why she's scared of you?" He asked and Frost shook his head.
He closed his eyes and remembered how cruel he had been with Tony. He was just trying to save the situation, it wasn’t his fault and yet he said mean words to him.
“And I’ll be The king od Asgard ! I’m the god of thunder!”
Thor left cause his brother called him and all of them were sitting.
How’s he gonna make it? How should he do that? It’s hard, he’ll face them and maybe they’ll try to kill him again or maybe they’ll kick him out of the team if he had one panic attack; and then there’s Bucky, how’s he supposed to face that man? What if he tries to kill him again or worse! Maybe he’ll be a couple with Steve? This is the worst nightmare for him.
"I'm sorry uncle, I'll tell them I promise." Stephan kissed Peter's forhead again and Peter missed being contacted like that. He missed being warm, he missed to sleep between Tony's arms.
"I'm ok!" He comforted himself and stood cause of course he'll be ok, in the end of the day everything'll be ok.
Ultron was pain in the ass, but together they make it out alive. Tony started distancing himself away from them. He felt like he's a monster again.
“He’s changing his clothes now sir “
“No ! I can’t live with that kid in the same house! He’s a nightmare! Of course you’re suffering cause he won’t let you sleep because of his cartoons “ Tony giggled again and Bucky rolled his eyes.
“It’s only two years I can do it.” He was convincing himself that everything is going to be ok but he knows that the hell is waiting for him there.
"If we lose?"
And finally Tony kissed Steve .
"I'm sorry..." Tony whispered to Thor who smiled sadly.
He started checking Tony’s body and when he saw it, his face pales. Of course he would be dizzied.
“He’s with Thor now Nat” She just kept hugging him .
“Hey good morning “ Tony greated them and all of them smiled to him .
Tony could not stay in the back I was making and Thanos was grinning with amusement as he saw Tony.
“To who ?”
When she lefts he went to the lab but FRIDAY told him that Tony is busy with work and he sighed and go back to his bed .
He stood and hid his wound with his jacket and bit his  lower hip when the pain was doubled.
He sighed and left to his lab.
When he become like this worthless? Helpless? not capable to do anything?
"Enough,he's a kid. Don't forget." Frost pulled her wrist roughly and looked her dead in the eyes, she just kept looking at him for moments, then she nods and left.
“Mr Stark, please talk to me! Don’t leave me behind you! Please!” The kid kept sobbing and Pepper starts crying too. Rhodey left the place and punched the wall once he was out of the room.
He pushed Natasha and Rhodey and walked to stood infront of Steve
Tony moaned and his hands were pulling Thor closer.
"Who do you mean (We)?" What if she's the weakest one here in this place?
“What happened to dad? Is he ok?” He asked Stephan who was eyeing  him all the time.
They were so quick and following Clint’s leads and then they were about one corner out of this hell.
“So did you see that they don’t care about you ?” A voice suddenly said to him and Tony jolted and was looking around to see who was talking.
on top of Tony, he blushed and wanted to sit but Tony pulled him to his chest and Bruce froze. Was Tony being soft with him?
He was trying to keep working but the image of what he saw is playing over and over again .
He was so tired.
“Tony, please, I’m not in the mood for You right now!”
Tony took off his t-shirt and Bucky touched the wounds . and Tony bited his lower lip because of the pain.
He feels himself as a monster!
Seeing Tony comforting Thor after defeating the enemies and how Thor is resting his head on Tony’s chest and Tony brushing Thor’s hair and kissing his head .
He closed his eyes remembering the day Tony came back from the space, he was so thin and he run to him, already feeling that he let him down. But what can he say now?
What a disappointment you’re Peter.
Tony pushed Thor from him and stood.
Bruce looked at Tony and he was searching in his eyes again, he looked away from Bruce.
“Guys what the fuck ?! Why this seems so real ?! Why I feel like this is happening and I’m a soul so you can’t see me or hear me !” Tony said sitting beside Loki .
“Good morning.” He mumbled to them and he gets a waves and a (Hi,Hey) with a (goodmornings), but the only one who doesn’t care about his Presence was Tony, he just kept sipping his coffee and totally ignoring Peter.
He stood and realized that he was sitting for along time thinking.
I'm writing fast cause my phone just broke and I'll be out till I got a new one.
He finish and slept beside him .
He fall to his knees and covered his ears with his hands. “STOP IT PLEASE! TURN IT OFF PLEASE!” He kept pleading them and they were only looking at him with disgust.
Steve took a shower and then he sitted alone reading a book .
They're only a week since they come to the house.
After week :
“Oh yeah ? What am I then ?” Tony asked wiggling his eyebrows .
Tony had slept that day hardly, he had three nightmares. When everytime he wakes up, he find himself alone and feeling their hands on him.
He never told him that he loved him ! He took all the power from Tony’s body . He broke him for the million times .
“Hey Loki ! What are you doing here ? I really missed you dude !” Tony hugged Loki and Loki hugged him back and he was smiling to Tony
Bucky put his arm around Tony .
Thor growled and pushed Tony to the wall. Tony gasped in pain and surprise.
He was making the rules in his head when Loki came out he nodded to Tony and both of them go to eat and go back without troubles.
He was eating once in week.
“D-don’t! Please don’t touch me! I’m sorry, I’ll be good. I promise! I’ll go back to the garage, please sir-just don’t! I didn’t mean to” peter’s voice was hoarse from screaming. Everyone was shocked and looking at him. He felt so small and so embarrassed, yet he just wanted to go back to his room.
"What? Who took who?" Tony asked them looking like his heart is about to stop.
"Move." She orders Frost, who refused to move. She was mad in a second and she controled her power and throw him to the wall. He groaned in pain and Peter's eyes filled with panic. She chocked him with her power and Peter stood and run to her so he can stop her but she moved her hand to him and he was hitted by her power and fall to the ground.
She’s acting innocently again what a devil! He snorted
Thor who was so worried about him .
"Aunt Pepper! Please, I can't take it! They're all looking like someone kicked their puppies! Change the house for us!" He was begging her to change their house. Especially after seeing Tony looking at someplace where he hurt Peter and the tears just fall before he gathered himself and left to his workshop.
“Oh my god ! Steve I’m so sorry. You did this for me ?” Sharon kissed his hand again and Steve was about to say I did this because of you , Because you destroyed the most beautiful thing in my life . But he just nodded to her nd the next thing he was in the bed with her having sex .
“My Friend Stark? What happened?!” And that was Thor.
“Tony? apologies for this now.”His father bossed him like always but Tony stood and take the bags from his father’s hands and walked to the door.
“Bruce you piece of shit !” Tony was calling Bruce and when he saw him . Bruce was arguing with Thor and Loki
"Loki, maybe something bad happened in Asgard and your father wants you back? Your brother is right Loki you should try to calm your self down cause you'll only hurt yourself when you're angry an-" He couldn't finish what he's saying cause Loki came and everything was on the table in front of Tony was broken on the ground now. Tony was shocked and scared that Loki will try to kill him again.
“No ... He’s not “ Tony sighed heavily and go down to finish their breakfast.
Tony moved back and looked at Steve he wears the same expressions in the first  kiss
Thank for your kudos and comments❤️❤️♥️
"By 7 huh? let's see who'll be back by 7!" He kept jumping from building to another.
But now it’s seems so different.
“Don’t! Don’t you ever dare and lie James!” What they did to make Steve angry like that?
Peter smiled to Stephan and hold stephan’s hand.
He felt someone wrapping his arms around him. His eyes shoot open to see Thor picking him up and Loki was standing on the other side of the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
They were making progress and that’s all it matters.
“Guys Hydra tried to attack Peter! Not spider man ! Peter! I don’t know how did they know about him being Spiderman !”
Tony sighed and tried to rub Peter’s back but Peter hissed in pain. He regret it for sure, he saw how Tony and Steve were looking at eachother then Tony turned back to him and pulled the blanket away.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Morning pete” Bruce replied and came to eat with Bucky.
“S-Steve ? What are you doing?!” Tony was shaking but Steve will make it clear to Tony that Tony is one of his properties.
“But he needs to be loved ! No one can do that only you brother!” Loki said pleading Thor who shook his head.
No one loves him, he was a villain to all people.
all of the avengers were here and they hadn’t noticed that Tony is a wake
Clint saying mean words to him, that’s wasn’t new at all. And the man who called himself Antman was  horrible, he told them to never trust Stark men.
He did everything for Steve.
Bucky hugged him from behind and kissed the two wounds .
Tony turned and looked at Peter who looked at him too then he turned to look at the same spot.
“It’s ok, I wasn’t hungry anyway.” He said and received a few sighs and curses while Tony just ignored him and left to his room.
Thor talked calm until he shouts in Tony's face who was trying to remove the tight grip on his throat.
And suddenly everything was quite and there’s no hands around him or mouths.
“Of course I’ll!” Tony answers and soon they forget about the ring and started making love.
“I’m fine Steve.” Steve sighed and then Tony moved so Steve can take Peter to his room. Of course Tony can’t pick him up cause Peter and him are the same high now.
Happy is a good person and he was one of his friends. He doesn’t have a lot of friends. Pepper , Rhodey and Happy were his only friends.
There was a hand on his shoulder he looked to see Bruce looking at him with the rest of the avengers even Steve was standing beside him
Tony saw Peter sleeping on the chair and his head was on the books, he was half holding his pencil.
They were watching with horror how Steve left Tony for death. And they call him Captain?
“Let’s go Tony. Can you walk?” Steve asked him and Tony nodded, But he felt his legs being so weak and he stopped walking.
He looked at Thor to see him tilting his head and he was like a confused puppy.
••**••**••**••**••
Steve started kissing Tony’s neck and Tony couldn’t help but moan .
Natasha rolled her eyes
He was wrong! so wrong! Just when he entered the dining room everyone was looking at him. He stumbled and looked down at the floor, he can feel the heat rising to his cheeks.
He go to Tony’s workshop.
“I also recognized the betrayal and the sickness but he was so scared and disgusted.” Vision agreed with her.
He should care more about Steve. He smiled to himself and prepared himself for the next morning to treat Steve as if he was his own king and he felt that Steve is his king . He tried to close his eyes but he couldn’t so he spoke to FRIDAY again
Steve rolled his eyes . Seriously why they couldn’t just kill him .
“Tony ? Tony babe wake up ?!” Steve shouted on him and this time Tony opened his eyes he was looking at the room then at Steve .
He knows why Pepper did this. He's really thankful to her.
He will ask me to take of my shirt and he’ll hit me with a whip until I’m begging him to stop.
maybe there’s only one chapter left...
“Nothing happened.” Peter mumbled and Tony stood he was walking to the door and Peter was looking at him.
He closed his eyes but he wasn't listening to them clearly, but he knows if he falls they'll be here to catch him.
“Tony?” Thor wrapped his arms around him .
“Yes sir.”
“You know that you were my favorite hero? And you know that you’ll always be my favorite hero?” Tony said and Steve was surprised but he smiled to Tony and Tony was grinning to him.
And he was sitting on the bed while Steve was standing infront of him
When he grew older, his friend kidnapped him and he managed to escape from him.
Once he entered he saw Loki mocking Clint .
He was snapped out of his thoughts when Clint stopped them to just say ‘YES!’ Out loud.
“Sharon ? Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me? Will you marry me ? “ he was holding her hands and she cried and hugged him .
He looked one last time at Steve to see him looking back at him. He really wants to run and comfort Steve or comfort himself but he felt so dead.
"Stop being dramatic bitch Tony." She retort and he glared at her.
Your nephew, Peter’))
He smiled to them and nodded.
“It’s been three days since the last time you eat something. And maybe it’s been week since the last time you got sleep.” When Tony said what he was thinking about Bruce start laughing and Tony wasn’t.
“So what the information you got from her ?” Nick asked him and he told Nick everything he knows .
Natasha stood beside him and she sighed heavily.
Of course Sharon was an easy target . But Nat told him to have sex with her and he was shocked.
Not for Pepper not for Steve and not for anyone else.
Guys I’m sooo grateful for your support! You’re really nice to me ! Love you all !!
“Peter, What’s exactly is your problem?” Steve asked and took a step forward.
C : Don not disrespect you superior !
“What’s going on?” They heard Tony’s voice and all of them turned to see him standing at the door. He was so pale how he’s still alive?
“Seriously man ? I was enjoying this fight ! “ Loki said rolling his eyes at Bucky and Bucky ignore him like always.
"W-who are you?" He hates how his voice's shaking. She chuckled and shakes her head.
“You killed me ! You are the worst person ! You’re a monster !” Peter said
They looked at him when they noticed him standing dumbfounded.
Hope you enjoyed reading this chapter.
“This is the first time you’re dreaming that I’m leaving you .” Steve said and Tony took a shaken breath and smiled to Steve
“How are you Stark ?” she asked him smiling and he sit beside Bruce
“And for how long you’re not letting him eat?” Loki asked crossing his arms to his chest. Tony sighed and sitted in his spot again.
He groaned and realized that he was sleeping on the floor. His neck was like hell from pain.
But no they don’t have to keep him away he can’t fight this war anymore yes he’s giving up on Steve cause if Steve’s happiness was with Sharon then let it be he will leave without hurting anyone. He was never enough for Captain america, For Steve Rogers. For the Avengers.
And where is Sharon? He can’t see her.
Loki remains Tony in him self, both of them got the 'daddy issues'. Odin was harsher with Loki, and that's not nice at all! He broke Loki and now he wants him back?
“Woah! Petey, take it easy. What happened? I can see it in your eyes that you were crying- No! Don’t lie to me about this Stark son.” Thor warns him and Peter looked at the ground.
It was 3 am and Clint started hearing whimpers, he thought it was Bucky.
he waited for Natasha and when she comes she looked so disappointed just like him .
“This for leaving me alone “ Tony said so calm and turned to leave but he was stopped by Steve pulling his wrist
Bruce and Natasha shared a look and then again they looked at Tony
“I’m just happy cause we win this fight together!” Tony said explaining and They hears their teammates clapping and whistling for them
He went to the file and start reading, seriously? They're keeping his boy and bestfriend under the ground?
“Thanks Bruce nothing is bothering me “ he replied smiling to him and Bruce nodded .
“Your Virgin ass in the mood for what captain?” Tony asked him and his virgin ass wasn’t in the mood for Tony’s bullshit. Steve ignored him again and walked past Tony so he could go to the kitchen, but Tony grabbed his wrist and stopped him.
He missed his mother so much but he never miss his father.
He looked at the blades that he was making for the Black widow and use it to cut his wrists. He cuts it again and then again and then again.
He opened his eyes and a tear slipped from his eye, Thor wiped it with his thumb and then he lifted Tony and took him inside.
“Tony darling you’re not a human “ Loki said still smiling and Tony start laughing .
When Tony opened his eyes they looked at eachother no one of them saying a word .
“Oh come on seriously?! That’s not fair” Tony still teasing them.
then the ship landed and the door opened slowly and Tony walked out
It was 4am and he wanted to eat something so he decided to go out and eat. He closed the lab behind him and when he entered the kitchen, he opened the fridge door and kept searching for his favorites. Thanks to god Steve made Tony's favorite food and kept it for him 'Like he knows that Tony will come and eat something.' Tony smiled and pulled the food out and put it in the microwave.
and Tony’s eyes watering he can’t breath he just wants to breath he fall on his knees and his hand on his chest
Tony nodded and left to the roof.
Tony turned and he was Stabbed by Thanos
Bruce patted his shoulder and stood to see Thor .
"He gets in your head when he was evil! When the first time he tried to control you and he found you interesting! He told me about it and he apologized for it!" Tony felt guilty for moments, but that doesn't excuse Loki talks about his parents like that.
Tony was only looking at them and ge was praying that these are just nightmares and nothing more.
“Just tell me if you want someone to fuck you ! You’re a whore Tony ! You let everyone fucks you even your father . I’ve seen so much dirty people but you’re new . You’re the worst. You’re just a trash . I’ll make you feel better...”  Steve regret what he said cause he didn’t mean to mention Tony’s father . But he was drunk and he can’t control himself. Tony’s tears were falling and like the words had died in Tony’s throat.
Tony waited for him outside the room.
................
What’s brought him back to reality was Bruce’s hums.
He rememberes telling them that it’s ok it was just a scratch, but the truth is it was a deep cuts on his wrists. Then after that he told them to leave him alone cause he needed some time alone and they did.
“Tony ?” Steve was about to reach him but Tony flinched away and Tony regret what he did cause he can see Steve was hurt
After Tony've had enough of him he pulled Peter's hair and dragged him to the garage.
"Tony..." Steve made a wounded sound and sighed, "Babe, you just got out of the surgery!"
Guys Please leave comments and kudos! hope you enjoyed and I love you all ! Muah !
but Steve held his head so he won’t hurt from the floor he puts him slowly to the ground and wiped the tears that falls from his eyes and left Tony on the floor
“Tones ?” The same voice he heard earlier.
Tony stopped laughing .
Steve chuckled and stood beside him again and Peter wanted to tell him to give him a little space.
“Steve you basterd! Wake up I need you to bring me Peter! I’m sorry I’ll forgive Bucky just wake up. I-I’m lost without you Steve I need you...” He start giving up on Steve and his voice was getting lower and lower with every word.
"Of course my love." It's was his dad's comforting sound. He smiled and his eyes started closing.
“Captain I’m not here to fight.” Stephan said calmly and Tony sighed. Peter took steps back away from them all cause he knew what’s coming up next.
He pushed Tony to the bed and slept beside him.
'Hi dad, hi pops I wanted to tell you that you've been controlled by pop's ex?!' He shook his head"No, I'm not going to tell them. I'm not ready yet."
“That’s it!“ Thor punched Steve. Tony was only looking at them feeling sick from them. He’s really tired of them.
“Thank you guys ... I’ll just let them be together. I know he’ll back to me “ Tony said wiping his tears
Steve kisses his husband one last time before leaving. Once he was out the door his tears fall.
“Shit...” He grinned to Thor but Thor picked him up and throw him on the couch in the sitting room.
“Pops please, l-leave me. I’m sorry I won’t burn the place I -I promise!” Shit he never felt himself loser until now.
"Babe, take it easy. Doctors are saying you have a failure with your arc reactor and with your heart. You should rest babe. You can't even walk." Tony groaned at the news which made his husband smile at him.
“To tell you how much I’m sorry for what I did today.”
But now what? Is this the time they regret what they did?
His shiled fall to the ground and he took quick steps and hugged his husband and his son.
Tony stood and went to his workshop .
He couldn’t know who’s Steve anymore .
I hope you’ll enjoy this one❤️
Tony smiled to the memory and he realized that he’s missing his babe his love his boyfriend. He sighed happily and decided to go to see him and he was actually surprised that the other avengers are out . He go to their room and he heard a moan he blinked and again he heard it but this time louder . he sallows and opened the door a little slowly and he was prying that Steve is not cheating on him. His eyes went wide open once he saw Sharon is riding Steve she was on him and Steve pulled her into a kiss . Tony never saw this love in his boyfriend’s eyes when they’re making love .
“You don’t have to do this for me or just because you’re sorry black widow. Now get some sleep.”
“He’s right, you can’t give me food while I’m grounded.” He said smiling to Thor and Thor looked at Tony like he was about to smack his head but he sighed instead then he ruffled Peter’s hair.
“I..I have to call Thor !” Bruce left him and Tony was shocked why Bruce is acting weird ?
“Come on Tones . You have to wake up now and be strong “ The voice said again and Tony felt some one behind him .
“I promise you everything is going to be ok.shus baby.” Rhodey was trying to calm his bestfriend.
Why you kept talking like you care about me ? It’s ok just say that you don’t love me and you love her !.
Tony was pale like there’s no life at all inside him.
"I-..I was mad at you and uncle Thor and pops of course." He replied and sighed.
After days passed, weeks and now months. Tony is getting better and to their surprise he wasn’t drinking, but sometimes he’ll cut his wrists and soon he stopped doing that.
Clint left them to their own business.
He sitted on the couch and
“If I was a demon I’ll make sure to kill Sharon and drink her blood “ Tony said smiling evilly .
Steve sighed and sit on his chair next to the window .
“Why you were fighting ?” Bucky asked them and there’s no answer.
“Steve and Bucky left Tony for death in Siberia.” Loki replies and that’s seems to shock everyone in the room.
“I love you ... I always kissed you just because I love you all of them except the first one “ Tony laughed and Stopped laughing because he was pained and Started coughing again
< ——— >< ——— >
When they finish Tony go down to his workshop and Thor went to see Bruce.
He opened his eys again to see the same worried eyes were looking at him.
Tony was the first one who took a step in their relationship. He was the first one to kiss the other , He still remembering how Steve was sitting on the couch reading a book and once Tony entered the room he smiled to Tony and Tony smiled back, Tony kept walking and sit in Steve’s lap and kissed Steve. Steve was surprised by Tony’s surprise action but , when the kiss was over they were grinning to each other
Thor was looking at him and smiling.
The last thing he remembered was Sharon’s face and she was smirking and then everything is black.
Tony entered the room and he can see Tony’s foots in front of him. He covered his mouth with his hand, he closed his eyes and tried to breath , he shivers and when he opened his eyes to find Tony crouching imfront of him and grinning to him.
“No,No! I’m not done with you yet Stark” Tony smiled to him and wiped the blood from his lip and Punched Clint back but it’s easy for Clint to dodge him.
Steve sighed he knows Tony wasn’t going to tell him so he just hugged Tony and kept brushing his hair and Tony started to relax again.
They smiled at each other because they had finally won together.
“Tony?” He froze, he never expected to hear that soft voice again. He turned around to face Bruce.
He sighed and faked his smile .
He closed his eyes and remembered when Tony spit in his face and told him he’s cursed with killing everyone.
Tony sighed and stood but he was still feeling dazed.
Tony rolled his eyes and go to prepare a coffee for him and he felt a hands wrapping around his waist. Tony froze he knows that big arms . It was Thor’s!
Then there was a sound of a bullet . Everyone stopped and look at the door .
Loki rolled his eyes .
Thor smiled to him and he smiled back .
“Thanks” Tony only nodded to him.
“Tony! You can’t do that!” suddenly Steve snapped causing everyone to jolts. Peter looked at Steve to find him red and that’s mean he’s angry and he would kill anyone right now if he wants to, but Tony slammed his hands on the table and Peter’s eyes filled with fear.
“Soldier ! You promised to put the safety of all people above your relationship with Stark !” He was wrong after all she’s a spy and all she cared about was her job .
He stood in his shaking legs, he supported himself by leaning on the wall.
Tony finally gets Bruce out. He took a quick shower and go to make food for both of them, Bruce must be really hungry.
Steve doesn’t know why he slapped Tony . He hates himself for doing that .
But maybe he got feelings towards Steve even after what happened? It’ll be a torture to see him with Bucky. He understood that Bucky is also victim right here, but he can’t help it; he felt angry that he’ll lose Steve for Bucky and in the end he did.
“No ! Babe give me your hand Please don’t turn to that guy !”Natasha said holding Bruce hand
“Do you need me to tell Rhodey that you’ve joined the military?” Happy asked and Tony shoke his head.
“Wow... My son’s hiding things from me and he’s telling them to you. What a shame Peter.” He looked at Peter and Peter’s eyes burn with tears.
"I'm not a good brother Tony. He... he was begging me to stop hurting him and I was just listening to them not doing anything else just kept hurting him more and more." Tony doesn't know what he should say to that. So he kept brushing Thor's hair.
“Run you idiots! What are you waiting for?!” Natasha start running and they followed her.
“I can’t hurt him “ She said and Steve sallows.
Tony smiled to him and his eyes started getting heavier to kept them open
For pops and dad? Shit who am I to call them like this again? They’re different people. I really don’t know them.
After  one week of hurt and hearing them talking bad about him. After one week of hiding away in his workshop. After one week of pain and crying alone. He finally go up only to be shocked to see what was playing on the TV.
Thor slept beside him and hugged Tony .
He started to faint in his lab more than usual. Friday will never open the door if he told her to, while Jarvis will open it if he saw Tony's in a bad situation.
He felt so much in peace. He fell for his teacher Mr Beck.
And he was jealous again.
This chapter for Steve’s pov .
“Tony we’re here. You’re not alone in this.” Tony nodded and rubbed his eyes furiously.
“Nothing happened. Everything is alright. Dad I’m sorry, I will go to the school. And I promise I’ll be good.” He wasnted to go out but Steve blocks his way.
Oh my god what have I said ? I’m sorry Steve I’m really sorry!
Tony couldn’t understand what does he mean by ‘They’re coming’ .
“Loki this is The Sixth stab ! “ Thor kicked Loki’s ass
"Other than russia?" He asks again.
“I’m a monster now because of you. If only you treated me right I’d never be like that and here. Mom you know what Natasha said to me? She said that she doesn’t care about me and I thought that she’s the only one who cares about me.” He chuckled and his chuckle pained his own heart. He sighed and throw the bottle on the picture.
“Pete? What happened? Did someone hurts ya when you were patrolling?” Bucky asked him and start moving towards him.
“ I’m not doing this because you take Steve from me.. No, I’m doing this cause you go to the best part in mylife... Peter. Yeah you bitch you’re just a trash I don’t care about you... Seriously find something better instead of destroying happy lifes. huh what a whor-“  He was cutted by Steve slapping him for the second time. And that’s smirk again on Sharon’s face.
"Yeah.. Just glad to have you back with us." Tony smiled to him, but Clint left him making stupid excuse and Tony knows it was fake.
“THOR !” Steve was really pissed of !
“Why nobody loves me mom?” He looked at the picture on the wall, it was for his mother and him. “Why you never loved me? W-why you were hurting me? Am I a disappointment to you and him? Are you proud of me now?” Tears falling, but he didn’t care.
“Shhh Tones I’m here . Nothing gonna hurt you I promise “ Bucky kissed Tony’s forhead.
“I’m fine . What about you ? And what a surprise to find you here in this morning” He grinned to her but she smirked and said
"Steve, d-don't be s-selfish this time, please?" Tony pleaded him and Steve was selfish again, he ignored Tony and jerked his head towards Strange who nods and opened portal. They walked inside it to Wakanda's hospital and Tony looked at Steve one last time and then he passed out, Steve won't believe that he heard Tony whispers "I love you." No it's can't be true.
Tony jolted and looked at the bed to see Stephan.
That’s true his mother was like his Howard, but he loves her and he can’t stand anyone talks that bad about her. Even when she hits him in the past it wasn’t her fault, it was the drugs and alcohol’s fault.
At least they could hope for the best now.
“Woah ! Tony you’re so lucky !” Sam said grinning and Tony look at Steve who was holding Sharon and smiling to her .
Tony wake up his whole body hurting him . He looked around to see himself in his bed and Bruce is sitting beside him on the chair. Bruce smiled to him and he smiled back .
“I don’t know “ Tony answered him and Loki entered the room
He shakes his head and started walking to the kitchen.
Hope you like it . Support me with your comments and kudos. Thank you all . You stand for me and supported me to continue. And I’m so sorry that I was about to stop writing forever. But I won’t stop . I hope I’ll make you happy in the end guys .
"Maybe You should see a doctor and check your brain cause I can't talk with someone crazy like you. Loki you could never be a goo-" he couldn't finish what he's saying for the second time because Thor pushed him to the wall and he was choking him... Again.
“I’m-I ..I’m really sorry I didn’t mean to -I ...”Tony  can feel the heat himself. He knows that he was blushing heavily but he couldn’t help himself.
They stayed like that in silence just breathing each other and trying to comfort each other by their presence.
"Who can hate my beautiful lovely son?" Steve asked and Peter grinned while Bucky rolled his eyes.
He looked at the dark skies. He never liked anything after what happened. He hates everything now.
Sometimes Clint will come to play with the robots but the main reason he's down in the lab is Tony.
“Son you know that you’re all I’ve got. Peter I- I just can’t see you fading like that. I know you’re hurt but please, tell me what happened with you. I promise you everything will be alright again just tell me.” Peter pushed Tony’s hands away, he wishes he can tell them but he can’t. He took a step away from them.
He was in Afghanestan and they were torturing him burning him hurting his heart . he was hurting but this was new Steve was Standing besides Sharon and they’re both looking at him
Natasha for sure was in a serious situation. He was ok, he was a wake. She was not ok, she just passed out.
He disappeared and showed in Peter's room. Peter was listening to the music and he was jumping on his bed.
“ What are you saying Stark ?” She asked innocently and he snorted.
And when I took my shirt off I saw the disgust in your eyes and I learned a lesson that I’ll never be a shirtless again.
"Why you're late?" Tony asked him in a calm voice.
“You’re moving! Tony, You’re moving!!” Tony chuckled softly.
“I don’t know them “ Tony said
“Nah I feel that I’m good “ Tony said then he left Steve standing by the door and Tony go to see Bruce.
He stayed there for hours until he heard his dad voice.
The last thing he remembers was Wanda the girl who volunteers to Hydra experiences with her brother. And then the Winter Soldier was coming out, but that doesn't make any sense cause the Winter soldier loves Tony and Loves Peter so no way that he wants to hurt him.
He was lost.
"Save him Steve, please?" Steve just closed his eyes to prevent himself from breaking down and crying like a kid. He gasped when he felt another one hugging them, he looked to see Peter hugging them and they both hugged him back.
“No you’re not I know what you’re suffering just when I touched you “ Loki smirked when Tony’s eyes widened
"I'm good. How about you our soft princess?" He smirked and her eyes darkened then she smacked his head."Ow!!"
“Steve? Steve please help me!” Tony was pleading him but Steve smirked when Sharon started laughing and they give him his back and leave him .
He looked behind him to see them all behind him.
“THOR !”
“Let’s take him to Bruce now “ Natasha told them and Steve nodded and still looking at Tony between his arms
Steve smiled to him and leave him.
“Steve? Thor ? Follow me “ Bucky said and they did .
"I don't care! Do it! It is better than he dies here!" Steve looks at Clint because he just snapped at Thor and Thor lifts Tony without saying another word.
“TONY !” Steve puts him down slowly and kept crying on Tony’s  chest
He’ll never be sorry and Tony knows that.
“Mr Stark? What’s going on between you and Mr Rogers?” Peter asked him and Tony shrugged off.
“And Why Los Angelos ? “ Nick asked and Steve didn’t know what to answer.
Tony couldn't sleep, not when Thor is suffering.
Tony is pissed off from Steve, of course he thought that Steve was scolding him for patrolling out late and he was having a panic attack because of Steve. Yeah that happened before and Tony thought it’s happened again.
“MR STARK!” Bucky jolted away from the voice.
But for Sharon she hates it she always tells him that he looks like a homeless man and Steve hates her for hating the things Tony in love with .
(See the end of the chapter for
“Anyway. You noticed how Tony was suffering? “ Bucky asked and Thor nodded.
“ They don’t love you Tony ... They will kill you so soon “ The voice said and Tony couldn’t understand what’s going on .
He kept crying and he knew that he should call Rhodey or Pepper, but he’s too scared to say anything.
ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
“Nat I can’t do this ! Ton-“ she cuts him before he can continue
“What’s happened to him ?!” Bruce was paniced the first he saw Tony
He was hungry and that's ain't new, he used to be hungry through the past month, or better say he hadn't eat for three days but that's ok as long as they're fine.
“They’re so idiots.” Natasha mumbled and both of them looked at her. She was free and no one knows how! She moved and untied Clint then she did the same for Tony.
“Please Mr Thor help boss!” Friday’s panicked voice cut what ever Clint was about to say.
"What have we done to him, Steve?" He asked and the tears already falling down.
Peter was happy with his life he really was. He hummed and closed his eyes.
He knew that he was blushing and he knew that Thor know why he's blushing. Thor starts getting closer and Tony can feel Thor's breaths, he closed his eyes and parted his lips a little. Instead of feeling Thor's lips on his mouth, he felt it on his forhead and that's sent warm feelings inside his heart.
She was mad, like really mad. They start torturing him to remind him who he was and for who he's serving.
Tony sighed. No they couldn’t make him jealous. No matter how much they’ve tried. Steve is the one who doesn’t care about anyone except his career.
Thunder showed in the sky and Tony shivers.
“I’m good actually perfect. And I just wanna talk to Steve but when I saw you guys I decided to stay and have a nice morning with you “ She said looking into Steve’s eyes then looking at Tony .
Of course in the past before Sharon came and destroyed their relationship Steve was feeling jealous from Bruce and Rhodey. They were so close to him . And then he was feeling jealous from Peter who hates him and Steve also hates Peter.
“You’re. I don’t love him and I know he doesn’t love me, but he let’s me in. You’re here because of them. I’m going to have a power and thanks to him and this stupid agent Natasha,” He closed his eyes and took a breath.
“What’s wrong? The cat eats your tongue? “ The bully smirked and Clint stood.
He hates it when all the attention is being on him. He hates it when someone wants to say that Tony is a weak person.
“Pete? Where are you?” Peter stayed under the bed scared his dad will abuse him again.
“You think they’re coming to save you?” She asked and all he can think about is 'No they’re not.' Of course they’re not going to save him even if he asked them to. He just kicked them out of his tower and they were so sorry for what they did with him.
There are many questions in his head.
"I am Nebula" the girl introduced herself and he nodded to her .
“Tony ? What’s bothering you ? Tell me you know that I’ll help you and I won’t say anything to anyone if you want .” Bruce said and Tony sighed
He turned to see his dad unhappy of course.
“What if someone tried to kill him Thor? Or you was so busy trying to fuck him and not bothering if someone killed him later?!” Ah they were talking about him of course.
“Don’t sweat it Loki, I’m sorry too.”
“Then let’s go take a shower and eat something then maybe we can talk?” Tony suggested and look up at Bruce with eyes full of hope. Bruce chuckled and Tony grinned genuinely.
He went to the bathroom and splashed water on his face then he patted his face with the towel and then ther was someone knocking on his door.
“Clint? Babe what’s wrong?” Tony tries to make his voice softer and he thumbed the tear away.
he saw a paper beside him .
“It’s ok Bruce they’re scared about Steve nothing is wrong.” Tony replied to him and Bruce nodded after staying silent for minutes.
he kissed Peter’s forhead
He sighed and broke himself free from Steve’s hands.
Tony froze in his place. do not Cry ! You are not weak! do not Cry !
He really hates the bullies.
He smiled to Tony and Tony rolled his eyes.
There’s a group he could call the famous cause everyone was around them.
“Hey..” Loki smiles to Tony who nodded to him with warm smile.
In the end of the day Tony dragged him out to the garage.
He go out and froze when he saw Steve’s back. He was fighting with the others avengers. There’s someone Tony couldn’t recognize him.
“Why?” Tony finds himself asking without thinking.
Even though Natasha sometimes hack Friday's system and she'll enter the lab to drag him so that he can eat something.
They were fighting like kids and for what?
“I thought you were having sex.” Tony turned red and looked away.
“Tony ?”
“Oh Shit! I’m so sorry uncle Bruce! I-it’s my fault and I’m really sorry!” He start wiping the tea from Bruce’s chest, the last thing he wanted is to piss this guy off. Shit there was a strong hand holding his wrist, he froze and looked up at Thor. There’s something wrong in Thor’s eyes they seems so distracted, he still can see the love behind this lock but he doesn’t know what happened.
The one who Tony doesn’t know, pulled Tony wrist and Tony looked up to him.
But he never touched it cause he can feel that Tony doesn’t like anyone touching it . And then Steve never felt like he deserves Tony’s love . When they had sex for the first time Steve saw the love in Tony’s eyes and it’s hurting him so much that he doesn’t deserve it . He doesn’t deserve Tony . After that he start letting Tony facing the pillow and not facing him . And Tony wasn’t complaining about it .
He can’t look at Steve with the same adoring eyes.
"That rough huh?" He chuckled when Clint groaned.
Clint picked Natasha up and they walked.
Tony raise his eyebrow and nodded to the man.
He sitted Peter on the couch beside Bruce and decided to face the one who destroyed his beautiful life .
“Yeah I’m. Don’t worry ‘bout me Happy.” He pulled away slowly smiling to his friend who was about to cry.
“Yes, you are and it’s hurt so bad Clint. If I disappoint y’all then I’m sorry... I’m so sorry Clint, but don’t give me your back! Damn it Clint I...” he stood and kneels in front of Clint who was shocked. “I don’t want the cold treatment from you... Please Clint?” Tony can feel his eyes burning with tears, but if Clint pushed him away now then he’ll leave and accept Clint’s decisions. But of course Clint won’t push him away, Clint’s hand was touching Tony’s cheek and Tony closed his eyes.
He got a call from Nick and he went down to talk with Nick .
Now there is no Peter ... no life for him to live. Because of him the wizard gave the stone of time. He was a waste of time. He hates himself so much.
“Guys why you’re arguing?” Tony asked and they all looked at him and smiled .
“It’s all my fault “ Steve said sighing and hiding his face with his hands
“I’m sorry I didn’t mean to scare you like that. I just thought it’d be nice to keep distance between us now,” he hold his hand to stop them from protesting “but I was wrong. I’m sorry again.” Steve came and pulled him to his chest.
Tony kept sobbing on Steve’s chest
Tony turned to face the base.
“Sometimes I’m curious to know why you’re not broken? I just hope someone will brake you!” Natasha said and he wanted to tell her that he was already broken and so many people had broke him but he just smirked and fired back.
“Hmm yeah I’ll admit it that he is the strongest avenger cause he will kiss him !” Rhodey said proud of Tony .
“Yeah a little bit distressed nothing important “ Tony said smiling.
“Hurry up and finish our breakfast you whore!”
He bumped into Thor who lets him fall.
He can’t look at anyone of them and feel safe.
In the next morning he woke up because of a hand touching his face . He opened his eyes slowly to see Steve smiling to him Tony smiled back and he pulled Steve to kiss him and Steve kissed him back .
“I tried to do everything to make you proud of me, but.... But you were never proud of me. You know what? They hurt me when they talk about you in a bad way, I can’t control myself because I know it’s truth that you are not the best mom or the best person. In the end I feel jealous of them when they talk about their parents.” He took another bottle and sit on the floor in front of the picture.
“Tony ?” Steve called him and when he was about to put his hand on him Tony flinched away . Steve was shocked it’s really hurting him how Tony wants to stay away from him . Of course he had all the rights to stay away from Steve.
“They all know about us except Tony , Bruce and Thor don’t worry babe” She said and he nodded .
Steve pulled his wrist to stop him .
“Mr Stark ?” Tony turned to see Peter behind him
“I can’t see them together “ Tony looked at the floor and Loki sighed this time .
“Steve found you on the floor and the doctor said that you have to rest “ Bruce said smiling to Tony and moving the hair from Tony’s face
This is also true he likes Steve.He always loved him but could not tell him for fear that Steve would reject him. He has always learned to hide his feelings.
Loki nodded to him.
then the door was open
“Steve loves me I know that even if he hadn’t told me “ He said it loud to convince himself
“Oh shit ... Peter stop crying I’m here “ Tony said moving a little to kiss the kid’s hair
“Hmmm My demon is thirsty for the blood?” Bucky asked and start walking to Tony who hide his face in his hands .
“But it’s wasn’t my fault?” He wiped the tears away and tried to calm down. But in the end he couldn’t and he kept his room locked even when Thor was threatening him that he’ll break the door.
He can’t hurt Tony anymore. He had enough. When he was a kid and they’re hurting him . Tony’s father was a demon he raped him . And in Afghanestan they tortured him they’ve burned him and They tried to destroy his beautiful heart! After that what Loki did to the earth he made him feel like it was his own fault. And then ultron came and everyone said that it was Tony’s fault. Then the fight in Berline after that the fight in Seberia had broke Tony completely . After that Thanos come and he was a nightmare to Tony but after that they win again.
“Let’s have this fight then “ Thor said and punched Steve .
“Enough! Enough! I can’t.” Loki stood and start pacing around. Thor looks back at the screen that playing Steve when he was hitting Tony with his shield.
He wishes that he can take the pain away from his friend, Bruce just doesn’t deserve that.
“Thanks Nat” She hugged him and he hugged her back but Tony couldn’t see them he was so shocked that the avengers
“Thanks Tony.” Tony just nodded and go back to his lab.
Tony kept having those stupid visions.
Until Natasha broke the TV. “He told you to turn it off!” She kneeled in front of him and he was pleading them to stop even though everything just stopped rightnow. It’s hard how he fall apart in front of them all.
“Babe ? Are you ok ?” Steve asked cause Tony was closing his eyes and hugging him he never acted like that only when he had a nightmare.
Guys I wanna say that I’m only 15 years old . The English is not my main language. In our country we don’t read the english as an important lesson. So I’m still reading and learning it by myself. I don’t use a translator as I said I’m writing it by myself. I’m really sorry about that guys don’t hate me .
“S-Steve  ... ah !” Steve was surprised what’s wrong?! he thought Tony was having a nightmare about Titan and not about him .
I know this is a fake smile Tony stop smiling please and cry between my arms I’ll keep you safe no matter what .
“Aww ! Why did you do that?!” Thor was rubbing the place where Tony smacked him .
"But baby!" Thor protested.
Or maybe he’s just wasting his time with her ? yeah he’s wasting his time with her . he wiped the tears away and stood he went back to work on the suits .
“W-Who are you ?! What do you want from me ?!” Tony asked he was shaking and feeling cold and he was so scared.
"Leave? You know you never paid for me? I spend alot of money on you and you know that." Tony said and every word was like a knife to Peter.
"There's a lot of places, Captain. We're going to find out once we breach the other bases." Natasha replied and he nods.
“I don’t love him Bruce! But I’m doing this just to make Steve jealous!” Thor snapped at Bruce who just sighed.
He heard his mother braking everything in the room while his father is telling her to stop.
“And I know you will kiss him from the start but you always need someone who’s telling you that you can’t to proof them that they’re wrong “ Sam said fixing his glasses
Thor, thanks for his presence, hugged Steve and kept promising him about finding Peter and how everything is going to be ok.
“Anytime sir” and she went off .
"I'm giving up ! I'm sorry!" Buck was eyeing them and smiling. Loki was calm like always but there’s a little smile on his lips .
When Tony wanted to make their relationship official for all Steve was so scared at first but then he agreed with Tony .
“He was like my father captain! He’s my everything “ That was Peter’s voice
The door slide open and Bucky entered the room and he was so pissed off .
How could Steve be like this ? he’s torturing the one who puts him in his eyes !
Happy pulled Tony in a hug suddenly and Tony felt he really needed this hug.
again Steve nodded and take a sip from his drink
“We’re all here now and I want to tell you something!” Steve said the existence filling his voice.
This time thanks to god the lights didn't hurt him, everything was a blur at first but then it's like the fog in his eyes seems to clear, but he didn't expect to see the cold eyes. He never did.
"You And Bucky are the cause of this hole right?" Tony's eyes narrow and Loki shook his head.
“No ! No ! Steve please  don’t leave me come back please babe!” He was shouting and crying cause they’re back to torture him
“Yes , your mother’s sister . She told the wizard everything and he told Thor everything and Thor told me everything and I’m here to tell you everything “ Loki said wiggling his eyebrows.
“Steve! What are we doing?!” She was really pissed off and her sound was between them but Tony can hear them .
“Weirdo !”
“Friday? Is everything ok?”
A man approached them he seemed idiot Loki and Tony rolled their eyes together and when they noticed that they smiled to eachother.
“Did they do something to them?” Steve asked and Tony nodded.
“Steve? Thor? Follow me “ Bucky said and they did .
Tony stumbled on the road and fall on knees cause Clint was moving too fast and Tony couldn’t move fast.
He couldn’t believe that Natasha did this only to get them apart.And why ? Only because she hates Them being gays ?!
Steve looked at the ground and tried again.
Peter’s eyes shoot open, he looked at Tony searching for something but he couldn’t find it.
“Come on babe we have to eat our perfect breakfast “ Steve wiggled his eyebrows and Tony was totally in love with Steve. every second pass he’ll love him more and more.
Loki grips Tony’s hand and lead them to set far from the others.
(See the end of the chapter for
“My friend it’s not your only fault! it’s ours “ Thor said putting a hand on Steve’s shoulder
“Tony ? “ Steve was horrified
And like that Tony was alone in the room on the couch. Even if it’s made him dirty to throw himself on Bruce like that, but at the end he helped Bruce and that’s all it’s mattered.
‘Put your mask on Stark.’ That’s all he thought before he smiled to them. “Welcome back! Your rooms are still the same and there’s a room for you too Bucky it’s in the same floor with Steve I didn’t want to get you apart dude, but if you wanted a floor alone then there’s one already completed for you.” Tony wishes that Bucky will say that he wants a floor alone, cause he hates seeing him close to Steve.
“What’s wrong Tony ?” Bruce asked sitting beside him
Bruce was always angry and he Hulked out every day more than three times.
It was the same day his parents died in car accident.
Thor wiped the blood from his lips and said “Let’s have this fight then “ And yeah they did !They only stopped when they heard a sound of bullet .
Number one 1
Tony rolled his eyes.
“Yes sir . Do you want me to call you when he’s a wake?” She asked
Steve turned to Tony surprised, he opened his mouth to reply but he closed it and Tony can see the hurt in Steve’s eyes. In these moments Tony will be apologizing to Steve and kissing him and maybe begging him to forgive him but right now he felt so numb, He can’t look at Steve in the same way he was looking at him before...
“Tony ?” Tony looked at Thor who was looking at him .
“Seriously Tony, I’m fine.” Bruce said and squeeze Tony’s shoulder.
Friday protests, but he told her to do it.
Then they stopped suddenly and Peter was on the floor he looked at them and they walked out of the door but to his surprise he saw the others following behind Steve and Tony. There’s something wrong! It’s like someone is controlling them but right now he didn’t care, all he cared about is to run for a safe place!
He felt dazed and suddenly he was falling to the ground breathing heavily .
"Stark? I'm happy to see you again .. Tell me .. How do you feel after losing this annoying child?" When Thanos mentioned Peter, Tony felt the blood boil inside him. He could not stop himself from attacking Thanos. He can hear Steve tell him to back down.
Sorry for being late. You know how the school is :( . This is short chapter I hope you’ll like it.
Steve wiped Tony tears with his thumb and Tony pushed him off
“Go with this one Anthony” The soldier pointed at man was standing waiting for Tony and Tony nodded.
“You’re my only curse !” Thanos said and Steve come with the others to finish Thanos
“Tony ?! “ Steve was searching for a sign to tell him that Tony is a live
So where’s Steve? And why did he leave him even when he saw him like this ? Was really Sharon more important than him ? But Where’s the rest of the avengers? And why he feels his heart hurting him this much ? And why his back is like on fire ?
“Nothing Tasha. I just got lost.” He lied and Natasha rises her eyebrow and she seems like she wants to smack his head for finding this horrible lie.
And when Bruce tried to stood Tony stopped him, No way that he’ll let him suffer alone.
Tony felt the tension in the room, so he wears his t-shirt again and then excused himself and left to his lab.
“ Seriously why you want to kill her ? If she’s the reason that why you’re suffering I’ll kill her” Bucky said pulling Tony to a hug .
Speak of the devil.
Number two 2
He passed out.
"Blackwidow this is the first place in russia. We can't wait any longer." Steve Spoke through his com. And he was in position ready for the breaching.
Tony wants to laugh he really wants. He can’t believe them.
“That’s it !” Thor walked and punched Steve.
How pathetic he was. His father had broke him too many times. His mother as well, the students in the school he was in,Obieda. Steve just like his father he hurts him so much. And now Natasha and Clint.
he giggled and said
Thanks for your comments and kudos♥️ love ya ♥️♥️💋❤️
“Tony! calm down! Peter baby? I told you we’re here to help you right?" Peter nodded and looked away.
“So this is a no ?” Bruce asked and they nodded to him .
“Come on say it ! I’m the strongest avenger!” they start laughing but soon their laughs stopped
He felt a hand squeezing his shoulder, he looked up to see Bucky looking at him.
"Frost, where's my dad?" He asked even though he's leaning into the touch cause that's the only comfort he'll be getting and that's what his guts telling him.
“ You can go to me instead of going to Peter but you want to destroy the avengers piece by piece and I’m not going to let that happen and you know that!” No body dares to stop him .
Once he opened the door he was shocked to see Thor was kissing Bruce. They broke apart and looked at him just shocked like him .
Steve was leaning on the counter and he was watching Peter carefully, from the look on his face he was having nightmare and Tony knew it.
“Po-pops? Please, Let me go? please!? I-I’m scared pops! Please I-I’m sorry for whatever I’ve done. Just please save me I can’t do this anymore, I’m hurting pops, I’m in pain- m-my head hurts so bad I-” Peter doesn’t know when he start crying but his breath was stolen away when Steve pulled him to his chest and Peter broke apart and started sobbing between Steve’s arms.
Steve’s tears run down his face. “Tony? Oh thanks god!” He hugged Tony so tightly, but Tony didn’t hug back.
Thor smirked and left Tony slowly.
“Nah I feel that I’m good “ Tony said and left him standing by the door . He hadn’t even said anything else and Tony run away from him .
What a shame. Of course he was scared to tell them about what happened, of course he’ll be scared that they’ll hurt him again. They’re monsters, they don’t deserve to be a live. And now he felt betrayed by them.
He whines and Steve rised his eyebrow.
How could he think of Steve at this time?
“FRIDAY close the door and don’t notify anyone that I’m here “ Tony said his voice is shaking
“Tony ?!” Steve tried again but Tony ignored him .
It’s hard for him to live while his father told him that he doesn’t deserve to live and he’s the one should be dead instead of the great captain America.
“Oh sorry you’re an angel ypu can’t hear these words, but really, fuck you.” The man shaked his head and nodded to the guards who were standing by the door and left.
"I need you to stay strong. Till they come." Frost told him and Peter nods.
Tony left with Bruce and Tony turned to them .
He sit down with his family they were talking and laughing every now and then someone peck him on his cheek or on his forhead(Tony specially).
Loki transfers them all back to the compound.
Once he was with the others he sit beside Bruce and he sighed heavily.
Clint avoided Tony’s eyes then he answered him. “Today, Fury told me.”
“Soldier? We really need you in this mission. HYDRA is planning on something really bad and only you can stop it “ Nick said to him and this time Steve nodded .
“Oh no come on ! Brotha I’ll talk to Bruce about it don’t worry “ Loki just nodded to Thor then he go down where the rest of the avengers sitting.
“ Tony is still sleeping right?” he bited his lower lip .
But then it’s look like the things get changed!
"Uhm hey?" They all turns around to see bruce shirtless and he was looking so exhausted. Thor chuckles and pulled his husband to them.
“Tony, why did you do that?” He looked at Natasha, then she passed out. ‘I’ve to.’ Was all he can think about.
“It’s over Tony. There’s no Sharon again. Bucky kicked her out the tower.” Bruce answered him.
“What about you slapping me twice?” Tony asked looking at the ground grinning as if it was a joke but inside no he mean it .
Then every thing was black. But he knows one thing that he's safe now.
for Bruce, Nat and Clint he’s sure they will be like a body without a soul, they’ll try to keep the avengers team and will be there if something bad happened.
Number five 5
“Shut up! Shut the hell up!” He walked to the elevator. ”Friday. Please lead them to the lobby. All of them” everyone was shocked but they did what he said he stopped bucky.
He wakes up because of Stephan and the others sounds.
••**••**••**••**••
"You're the worst brother! Of course father will torture you! Do you know who you are!"  Thor shouts at Loki and Tony blinks.
“What ?! Where’s Peter ?! Is he okay ?!”  he pushed Steve away and go out . He couldn’t wait to hear the answer.
After 1 month:
He's finally having his family back. Even though he's been through enough but here he's.
“Tony calm down !” Steve tried again
“Guys ! Stop arguing ! Tony I dare you to kiss Steve “ Natasha said
......................
"He told you to let him go!" Loki pushed Thor away and pulled Tony to his chest. Tony yelps in surprise but Loki transfer and so is Tony.
"I-I'm sorry sir! I'm really s-sorry! I didn't mean to, plea-"
he looked at Thanos beside him then again at them
He swear that he won’t talk to Natasha anymore cause she’s the reason why he’s in this situation.
After three days:
He laid on the couch and closed his eyes .
“Tony ? Tony babe Wake up !”
"I tried so hard to make Stark sad by hurting his son, but Sharon the idiot fails so I decided to do it my self."
“A-Are you ok ?” Steve couldn’t help his voice is shaking but Tony smiled to him . How could he still smiling to him after just what Steve did to him ?
I’m sooo sorry guys ! I’m having alot of troubles and I’m sorry for being late . I know this chapter is not good and I’m sorry again:(
Tony can feel Steve’s fingers in his hair it’s massaging his skull and he sighed and hide his face in Steve’s chest .
He closed his eyes and wiped the tear that slipped from his eyes.
after hours Bruce dragged him out of the lab cause Bruce was hungry and Tony told him to go but Bruce insisted that Tony will come with him .
He could feel his heart aching he wiped his tears that started falling but no , he can’t lose Steve! He won’t fight him about what happened.
Bruce was checking with his hand moving from Tony’s neck and to his wrist.
Tony moans the pain and wrapped his arms around Thor then he rest his head on Thor's chest. Thor flies away and Steve turned to him.
“Hey “ Tony smiled to them and sit beside Bucky .
“Yeah I wanna take him . That’s the truth! I wanna keep him between my arms in the night ! I wanna kiss him and take the pain away from him ! I wanna make love to him and make him forget everything he kno-“ Steve couldn’t hear it anymore. These things no body should do it to Tony only him !He punched Steve and cuts him .
“Take care of Peter please.”
His thoughts were lost when they landed. He had no idea where they were, but it’s  looked like the desert of Afghanistan, like the place where he was tortured.
everytime he close his eyes Peter shows up begging him not to leave him alone .
“And We all know that’s she loves you “ Nick said and Steve looked at the ground.
Stop lying Steve I know you don’t care . but he smiled to them and nodded .
He yelped when he heard lound knocks on his door and he heard Bucky roaring his name! shit this was the winter soldier and not his own lovely sweet uncle Buck!
He opened his eyes slowly only to close it again, the lights did nothing but hurts him more. Where the fuck he's?
Tony was laughing with Thor because he hit Thor by mistake and he was running away from him .
He bumped into Steve and they kept looking at eachother.
“What are you talking about ?” Bruce asked looking at both of them
They all were ready for something big but nothing happened.
“No, I’m bigger than this. And you’re bigger than this. Why he’s so skinny like that? When was the last time you guys gave him some food?” Tony walked to Ross and started untying him.
He finished dealing with Natasha a while ago and now he was waiting for the team and he’s still thinking what if Natasha had died today?
"I want you to know what happened with Peter, please?" Loki looked at him then looked at the hole in the wall and Tony eyes it too.
"Yes, I'm fine, thank you," he replied as she nodded, but there was doubt in her eyes as he ignored it and returned to work.
I know it wasn’t the perfect end, but I tried. :( Love you <3 ;*
"For god's sake Tony.. Can you please just do what Cap is telling you to do?" Natasha asked him and she was crouching beside Clint.
They can’t hear what Bucky is saying to Tony but Tony lefts .
Steve watched as Thanos's army fading one by one and then Thanos faded too, he smiled they did it, but who did the snap? Of course it's Bruce or Thor or maybe Carol? His eyes widened when he saw Tony paling and then he slumped against the rock and fall, No, no, no, he can't die NO!
before returning to look at Natasha and Bruce
"It's ok spidey." she kissed his forhead and then she left him alone.
••**••**••**••**••
Bruce was rubbing his eyes and Steve was looking at Peter and smiling-oh he was looking at him with that warm look again.
“Friday, where’s Bruce?” He asked her and stood to face his fear.
"Good, now we're going to record a video to your papa. You're going to beg them;let them know how much they're causing you pain! Let them fewl what I felt! Especially the whore Tony Stark." She said and the venom clear in her voice.
Peter looked at Thor for help but Thor shrugs and went back to eat his food.
He opened his eyes when he felt a hand on his cheek. He saw Stephan and everyone was on the floor, What ever Stephan did it had saved his life.
He ignored their stares and he had to pass between them and when he did Natasha pulled his wrist and he lift his eyebrow and he was about to tell her to fuck off but she spoke before him.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and Steve kissed his lips.
He can't blame her. She's saying he's the one who killed her parents and then she says he's the reason of Ultron. Although Steve, Clint, Natasha and Bruce disagreed with her and told her that she's the reason of Ultron and her brother's death was Ultron's fault and not anyone else.
“Sh-Shut up and go !” Tony throw a book on him and that’s was Steve’s book .
Them they were celebrating and Steve’s heart was with Tony he was afraid that Tony will do something wrong.
“I’m sorry Captain” Wanda said and used her power and he pass out
Peter saw him and Tony’s heart melted for Peter’s puppy eyes and the tears were rolling down his cheeks.
Tony picked her up and she yelps in surprise and he smirked.
“You’re going to regret that.” He Hissed in pain caused she was pressing hard on his wounds.
Tony wakes up and groans in pain then he looks around to see Steve sleeping on the chair beside him. It was midnight, he kept looking at Steve then he smiled and drifted off again.
"Hello my assasin." He walked to him and the soldier pulled Loki closer to him from his waist and kissed him then pressed their foreheads together.
All of them did this to him only because of a fucking mission?
He go to Bruce’s room cause he needed to discussion him about the updates of their new suits.
“If something happened to him I swear by my life that I’ll make sure to drink all your blood “ Tony warned and she cried
“Steve? P-Please d-don’t leave me” Tony was kicking the sheets and he was sweating and breathing heavy .
Tony was making the food and he was humming a song .
Tony left and Loki followed him .
Time goes on and nothing changes.
Here’s another chapter!
Steve stopped fighting once he saw a ring opened and the wizard came out of it and he was coverd with blood .
“What ?” Tony asked when he saw them looking at him he just can’t read them
“I’m the god of thunder. I’m the king of Asgard . I’m the strongest avenger . Do you know me now ?” Thor asked pulling Tony to stood behind him and what he did surprised everyone except Loki who was so calm like always.
This was so real . His soul stucked in the Avengers tower .
It’s clicked in their heads when they saw the knives. This is Loki, but why he was in this body? Oh...
“Tony she’s not the on-“ He cutted Natasha and snapped at her.
He stood and go back where the others are.
They all were celebrating and he was only looking at Thor who stood to see Tony .
Clint nodded to him and then Tony took them to the living room and they sit together, hands tangled together. And then Tony froze when Clint says, “Can I kiss you?” Tony looked at him for too long then he nodded and let Clint kiss him, he returned it in the last.
Tony finally moved and his neck was hurting him from the position he slept in.
Tony’s hands start moving. One was rubbing his arm and the other was brushing Bruce’s jaws and lips.
“Tony are you okay sweetheart?” Thor asked taking steps forward to reach Tony who kept laughing.
"We won't care about you cause right now you showed us how useless you're. I'll request rooms for us so we can live far from you so that you can't hurt us anymore."
He kept crying and for the first time he felt scared in this tower.
"Could you just accept the fact that I'm not your fucking Soldier!" Here he was having shouting match again with Steve and the whole team.
and Thor was looking at the ground.
“Woah ! Tony ?!” Steve called him but Tony couldn’t hear him
“If anything happened to him I’ll make sure you and Nick will pay for it “ He stood and left Natasha behind him shocked .
He was remembering the beautiful days with Steve and how they ended up like that ?
“My wings. They’re beautiful.” She said and Tony raised his eyebrow. He couldn’t move again cause they were holding him.
After 1 day:
"You chocked me again and then you'll kill me right?" He opened his eyes to see the guilt in Thor's eyes.
they’re now 4 vs 4 .
“Do you wanna see him ?” Bruce asked them and they both sighed.
"Now I'm going back to work. If you need me just call me and I'll be here." Peter nodded again and kissed Stephan's palm.
“J? Lock the lab no one in.” And Jarvis did what he said without saying anything.
Tony stood and Peter starts walking, Tony wasn't sure if he should touch him or Peter will refuse to touch Tony. But Peter made the decision by running to his father's arms.
“yeah Thank you so much because of you now I’m having Tony Stark only for me “ Steve said and look into Tony’y eyes and kissed him they deapened the kiss
Tony was shocked now.
And Tony knows that if he closed his eyes he’ll be safe and he did.
In the next hours Tony woke up because of a nightmare again but he wasn’t to go back to sleep . Steve’s side is cold Tony sighed and go to the bathroom he took a shower and go down to the kitchen where the other sitting . When they saw him they smiled to him and he smiled to them but soon his smile dropped. He saw Sharon is here and sitting in his chair next to Steve .
“Well if I was a demon that means I’m going to hurt the people I love ?” Tony asked his eyes glowing with tears .
He sighed and stood.
“I can’t! I can’t betray him ! I can’t hurt him ! He’s my everything please don’t do this to us !” Steve was about to cry and Nick sighed .

“Turn on the music please?” and the driver turned it on for Tony. Tony was feeling sorry about their driver his father was always hard on this man but Tony was always so good with him .

To his surprise they just ignored him he sighed and stood.
He opened his eyes and Tony was still looking at him, not smirking or judging or anything else he was just looking at him with... worried eyes?
Tony put his head on Thor's shoulder and closed his eyes and this time he didn’t prevent himself from falling sleep.
Steve walked to Peter who stepped back, but unfortunately his back hits the table behind him, but yet Steve hadn’t noticed it.
“No you’re not. Come on get up I want to offer you something maybe you’ll be pleased with.”
But the truth that he couldn’t sleep not when He’s thinking that Tony is under Thor and Thor fucking him not even making love to him . The way Tony will be shaking in the end of the sex and he’ll be so calm to have Steve beside him . But now he’ll be happy and calm because of Thor .
He’s safe with Tony’s hands wrapped around him protectively. Tony had a soft spot for them and they should never broke him cause then no one can pick him up again.
He entered the base and give his name to the soldier who was standing and checking the names.
there’s a wound in his heart and it’s hurting him more than the two in his back .
Peter tried to shoot him but Thor held Peter’s wrist and broke his web shooter and Peter’s wrist start bleeding. He was speechless, only looking at him.
“Good I need you to be strong cause I want to ask you one thing to do please ?” Loki said his voice suddenly serious and Tony nodded to him .
They’ll force him to have the answers they wanted to know.
while everyone was waiting for Tony she speaks.
Loki closed the book and started changing his clothes as well.
"No! I can't! I've to keep fighting, who would protect your back if I wasn't here?" He asked.
fighting the tears.
"You know he loves you, right?" He asked Peter who nods softly and Steve smiled then he leaned down and kissed Peter's forehead. Pepper pulled away and wipes her tears then she smiled to Steve and left them alone.
“I’ll make sure to burn him alive” Loki said smirking .
“Of course Peter anything you want.” Jarvis says.
this was his failure
Every word Steve had said is hunting him.
“Captain Rogers “
After 1 month:
he moved back and hold Steve’s hand with his both hand he kissed it and Steve was only looking at him doing nothing more
Tony laughed on them he hadn’t noticed when Thor and the other come .
"I know you're trying to do everything for them, but they can't see it. Tony stop trying to do everything for them and when they see it they’ll blame you, they’ll always keep blaming you no matter what. You deserve better, go back to the compound and don’t accept them when they want to come back.” Tony pushed Thor away from him.
“What was that? You know maybe I’m the one who’ll use the safeword.” He asked her and smirked, but when she looked at him in the eyes, he froze. She was crying, but why? He cupped her face “Tasha what happened? Who’s the reason of this!?” He asked her and he couldn’t hide how furious he was.
“It’s working!Go inside quickly! "Nebula ordered him and Yes, they have finished repairing one of the spaceships and now they will be back to the earth .
And now he back to the blackness again.
"Rape him." Thor finished for him and everyone was shocked.
He knows one thing that he just Can't Let Go.
“I’m turning a green oh god ! oh god !” Bruce was really turning green
Is it possible that Steve is still alive?
"You of all people talking about what's right and what's wrong? You of all people talking about getting back to an abusive father? Do you remember what Howard was doing to you? Yes, Tony I've seen everything happened in your life. Tell me how your mother pushed you from the stairs and you got your ankle sprains?" Tony closed his eyes trying to hunt the tears away. Yes he remembered what happened back there, but she was drunk. Tony opened his eyes and looked at Loki who started walking away and then Loki started to talk again. "Anthony, or should I say Tony cause you hates it when someone calls you 'Anthony'? Your parents are the same as mine, but my mom loves me instead of you. Tony we're the same. You've a slut mother and a monster father."
“Hey Tony. what’s with your chest, Frankenstein?” Tony chocked and then chuckled. He wasn’t expecting that.
But he just left them alone .
“Is it so cold for you mr Stark? Do you want my coat? Do you want hers? Just fucking answer me you son of a b–!....” he cut himself when he saw Tony’s eyes widened in shock. “I’m sorry Tony, I didn’t mean to snap at you. It wasn’t your fault.” Clint sighed and then sighed again. Tony looked at the ground and then nodded to Clint. “Let’s keep walking, I hope we can see a safe place so we can contact with the others. Is that ok with you?” Clint asked him and Tony nodded again, Clint smiled and Tony smiled back to him.
The compound is empty, his body's empty. Everything was empty.
He go down to the bar and he looked at all the whiskey bottles and he felt like he really needed to get himself a drink.
“Hey Loki “ Tony replied and Bucky pulled the middle finger for Loki .
“Thanks Tony.” Clint kissed Tony cheek and left him to lift Natasha and get inside the cave.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you happy now ?! Thor the god of thunder, The king of Asgard and the strongest avenger congrats for you! you wanna take him huh ?”Steve was shocked that’s he can’t be Calm anymore.
“I- I don’t get it, What do you mean by spell? Sharon is involved in this right?” Peter asked his voice so low like it’s never going to be loud ever again.
"Aunt Natasha, please? If you're going to talk about it then leave me alone!" Natasha shook her head and again he disappointed them. When he saw how she flinched when he raised his voice he regret it.
They couldn’t make it to his room, they stayed in the same room, on the same couch.
He wasn’t in the mood for her . He wasn’t in the mood for the reason why he’s suffering.
.....................
He felt dizziness creeping down his body and he reached for the nearest thing and it was a tree. He sighed and reached the wound. He looked at his hand it was red from the blood, he cursed under his breath and Clint turned to him.
The door closed and he walked to break everything in this room.
"Damn... How I'm going to survive this?" He sighed and turned to see Thor leaning on the door.
Tony’s body was shaking and as soon as he entered the lab he broke crying.
“You’re not a monster Bruce. She doesn’t deserve you or deserve Hulk. You two are better than being with someone fake like her.” Bruce wanted to interrupt him but Tony put his index finger on Bruce’s lips to shush him. “Come on Bruce? Seriously? When was the last time you had sex?” He asked but still he wasn’t mocking him or anything.
God he missed Clint! "How was your mission Legolas?" Clint sighed and collapsed on the couch.
“What the fuck ?! This is a joke right ? Stephan or Loki stop doing what you’re doing now !” Tony’s body started shaking.
He felts Steve’s hand touching his wings and his wings started to twitch.
Tony moved himself up a little and put his hand on Steve’s cheek and the other was on Steve’s arm to get support
“Sharon what are you doing?!” He asked her and she rolled her eyes before she come and kiss him on the lips .
Loki looked at Steve who was a shamed and he wanted to leave to the gym while Tony’s body was shaking.
He kept playing with Thor’s hair as the storms kept coming again and again.
"Soldier, bring the camera now." She ordered ad the soldier did what she said.
"Thor?" Tony called Thor and his voice was calm and coherent .
Tony was shocked
All he did was smiling to her.
Of course he broke down and tell the others to leave him alone but they didn’t. Instead they stayed with him and he slept with his head resting on Steve’s chest while the others slept beside them on the bed. It was Tony’s bed after all and it was large enough for the sixth of them.
“Wings ?” Bucky asked and Tony sighed.
Thanks again Love ya!
He can feel that there’s something about to break between them and if this thing had broke that’s mean they could never be the same .
He grabbed Bruce’s wrists softly and tried to stop him from hurting himself cause Bruce was scratching himself.
Tony looks to see a small cave and of course they could use it to try and contact the others for now.
“Tony ? Let’s go to bed I don’t want you to be sick “ Steve said looking straight into Tony’s eyes . But , Tony stood and nodded to them
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked up at furious Clint. Oh that’s was bad... so bad actually.
Tony can feel his heart is aching but he was smiling and laughing with his friend Clint . And now he was sure that Steve was with Sharon out side making out .
He couldn’t close his eyes or relax because he was thinking of Peter .
"No one is a whore just you." Peter said and she kicked him hard in the ribs. Frost closed his eyes he's not strong to see anymore.
How many times did Steve put Tony in pain? It's countless times, and now he'll di- no he won't. Steve won't let him.
“Sorry boss.” The AI replies and Tony closed his eyes and started taken deep breathes.
“Of course we all know about that ... I don’t like to talk about that I’m king of Asgard or I’m the god of thunder and all this shit I was just trying to make you distracted “ Thor said grinning
He inhaled Steve’s scent and kissed Steve’s shoulder before he closed his eyes and started chasing the sleep.
and Tony’s cheeks is red
Bruce and Thor didn’t help either. They were pressing on Tony to apologize to Steve and he didn’t tell them what happened in Siberia.
Peter kept crying between Thor’s arms until he passed out. Thor picked him up and walked towards the elevator, he puts the kid in his bed and kissed him on his forhead. The kid was breathing heavily and his expressions was pained, What happened to him? If he saw the one who damaged his kid then He’ll make sure to kill him and let him suffer. He kissed Peter’s forhead again and whispered “Peter you’re not alone, I’m not going to let you through this alone.” And like that he went out and closed the door behind him.
He saw everything, every cold night, every pain, every punishment they were given the kid and everytime he was pleading them to stop hurting him, then there was Sharon, she’s the cause of everything. He knows one thing that she’ll pay for it.
The day went by no one came to see Peter.
“Girls, calm down.” Steve said with his captain voice and sighed.
Tony smirked to him and Bruce slapped his shoulder playfully.
Beautiful things also happene :
“What’s wrong love ?” She asked softly and kissed his knuckles several times and he sighed just when she did that he remembered Tony when he’s smiling to him and kissing his hand .
“When you’ll be with her you’ll make her feel that you’re really in love with her cause we need information about HYDRA “ Nick said but this time Steve couldn’t stay silent .
“Nice perfume” Thor winks to Tony and Steve was like a volcano. How could he flirt with Tony infront of me ?! And Who is he to talk about Tony’s perfume? . There’s many questions in his head and he was about to kill Thor but he stopped himself.
And What about him being not a human ? But he’s acting like one of them . It was a real problem to him .
“You know that he loves you “ Thor was sure with what he was saying and that’s what made Tony snorted .
“I’m sorry Steve I’m really Tired I don’t know what I’m doing I ? I guess I need Time to rest “ Tony said his face is hot and red
“Congrats” He said grinning and even he knows that it was fake and all of them knew that .
"Clint what's wrong?" Steve asked him and Clint knew he should tell them about what he done to Tony and he did.
He saw Sharon sitting on a chair in front of him.
“Peter? let me see your injuries please?” Peter shook his head.
“I couldn’t move and I’m so  tired to get kicked out of your tower right now.” Stephan replied to him and Tony rolled his eyes.
"You stary here!" and like that he was alone crying and breathing heavily, his body was hurting him like a bitch.
"Roger Rogers!" And like that they all breach the place.
“You can do what ever you want to do without asking me Clint.” Tony says after they finish kissing eachother and then Clint was resting his head on Tony’s shoulder and Tony dropped the blanket over them.
Tony pulled Steve and kissed him like it was the last kiss
First Pepper and then he promised himself that he won’t love anyone. But when he saw Steve he forgot everything. Suddenly Steve was the most one hurting him.
“You’re the death of me boys.” Loki hummed in agreement and Thor snorts loud which caused them to laugh.
They took him to a dark room with... electric chair??
He knocked the door .
“Babe what’s wrong?” He asked and Steve stood and kneel on one knee.
He couldn't focus on anything but what he knows that it was getting heavier to stay a wake. Wanda pulled his hair and forced him to look at her.
When he had sex with her for the first time in her bedroom .
“Baby that’s me. I’m Thor your uncle, I’m not going to hurt you. That’s it. You’re doing great baby.” Thor tried again and this time he leaned into the touch and that’s was a sign to Thor who wrapped his arms around Pete protectively and he throw glances towards Steve, Tony, Stephan and Pepper.
“Tony I’m really sorry I was drunk earlier I didn’t know what I was doing. I really didn’t mean to say these things and I didn’t mean to you know r-rape you.“ Tony was shocked that Steve was saying it as if it was a normal thing trying to rape people?!
Tony opened his eyes and they were sore and black and they were bleeding.
She opened her eyes cause she felt his presence and she looked at him and smiled that smile again. She was winning this war and he couldn’t do anything about it . She moaned and pulled Steve closer to her . Tony’s tear rolled down his cheek before he decided to leave them continue what they’re doing.
He can feel the others eyes on them but he doesn’t care about them anymore.
He can see the others are joining like him. He saw group of girls and suddenly he felt that he’s really going to be alright soon.
Thanks for your support. Thanks for all the kudos and comments and Bookmarks.
And He was only pleading him to stop.
“Thor is touching Tony and flirting with him “ Steve said looking at the ground.
After 1 month:
His heart was hurting him .
Peter’s heart stopped he screamed and Tony crawled to him bu Peter was faster cause he’s a kid and a spider he gets out of the room running and hearing Tony’s laughs after him.
Friday closed the door behind him and he start working on their suits.
"Peter, they'll remember one away or another. Believe me it'll be easier if you tell them."  Peter's eyes shoot open, he swallowed loud and this time Stephan sighed.
He could never hurt his son no matter what, but yet Peter will flinches when everytime someone tried to touch him. Sometimes he could feel that's it's real so he decided one thing to do.
and Tony thought that Steve will kill him but Steve broke his heart
He stood in his old house it was near a lake. The house was small, warm and remains him in his mother.
"No, you're not! I'm not going to get pregnant and have your baby!" Bruce pushed his glasses up.
Tony pushed him but Steve hugged him Tony’s hand dropped his tears start falling
He was more skinny and He was pale like a ghost, His face was having bruises, also his neck was having a couple hickeys. He sighed and closed his eyes only to see Thor marking him, his eyes shoots open and he fall to the bed like a dead body.
He jolts and Tony smirks.
"At least take me with you, please?" Bruce asked coming with him cause he knows that he can't stop Tony.
Tony opened his eyes to see Thor is already smirking at him .
Why ? Steve must wake up! He did not have the opportunity to admits his love for him.
Peter the hand that's brushing his hair and kissed it. "Dad stop blaming yourself. I'm glad you're alive and I'm glad you come to me and burned the base. What happened wasn't your fault or anyone's fault- God aunt Tasha stop looking at me like that, It's not your fault! Seriously guys, I really love you and I know you'll never do something to hurt me even on purpose." Peter says and squeeze Steve's hand for support, but he didn't receive the support he was expecting cause Steve Rogers was giving him the puppy eyes who was kicked.
As you can see.. They started to remember what happened :) ... I hope you liked this chapter.. thanks for your kudos and comments❤️ Love ya
“Sharon? Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me ? Will you marry me ?” Steve asked her holding her hands and she hugged him and cried from the happiness.
The doctor left them and Tony could not believe this.
Even when Bruce was hurting him now at least he hope it’ll lead to something good at the end.
“Because I don’t feel comfortable with people looking at my chest.”
Steve is a brave man with or without the serum just opposite him.
Loki shrugged like it was something normal to have people bullying them.
“Nat He won’t back to me again I know that ! He’ll go and leave me ! “ Steve was really pissed of from all of them
“I’ve to go back to talk with the lawyers about Sharon.” Pepper said.
Tony was scared and Steve can feel it .
Steve smiled and closed his eyes and he tried to sleep.
Loki stood and start walking to Tony and Tony was taking steps back until Tony was between the wall and Loki
“Good for you Sharon! You taked the person that I always loved! But I’m not going to let you take my son away from me!” No he can’t do it.
“What happened? Steve I swear to god if I know you were behind this then you’re going to regret it!” Like always only Tony’s voice could make everything better. He start recognizing things now.
Tony cuts her.
She left him to them and they hurt his wings.
"I'm Back!" He closed the door behind him and Bucky smiled to him.
Thor sit on the bed and put his fingers in Tony’s hair
Steve was looking at him but he wasn’t talking or saying anything and Tony found out that he’s used to be scared from the love of his life .
“Tony you should rest seriously babe we can’t resk your health like that “ Steve tried again putting his hand on Tony’s cheek but , Tony just hold Steve’s hand and kissed it and Steve started hating when Tony is kissing his hand . That’s mean he’s trusting him and he loves him . But Steve knew that he doesn’t deserve it .
“ I’m not responsible about what happened I swear . Please believe me . Steve?” She asked Steve who was feeling not to stand in Tony’s face when he’s angry .
“Please tell me you’re going to be fine here?” Tony chuckled and patted his friend’s shoulders.
Tony tried to stay on as his feet but he couldn’t stop the headache or prevent his body from shaking .
Tony was sitting on the couch now and Peter sitting beside him holding Tony’s hands between his hands .
Tony cared about Bruce, he’s his favorite person and Jarvis informs him that Bruce was about to Hulk so many times, so Tony decided to let him rest for a while.
After what Tony said Peter's tears dropped he couldn't believe what he's hearing of course he missed something.
Steve looked at him then he lefts him
“Don’t tell them what happened. I want to tell them by myself. Please I want to hear it by everyone here to do that for me please.”
She was behind him with other guards.
“L-Loki what are you d-doing?!” Tony can hear the fear in his voice. Shit Loki start getting closer!
“We don’t know what he’s until we can see his wings “ Loki said still smiling
But again it was the wrong thing to say, cause again the red power is on him and he's being hurt. He screamed and was surprised that Frost did nothing to her.
Tony wants to cry, Rhodey is the only one who’ll never change and give the cold shoulder to him. Rhodey was everything for Tony. He’ll kill him self if something happened to this man.
He can’t lose Tony . He can’t let Thor have him !
Thor wiped the blood that dropped from his lips and smirked.
"You know that you should tell them about what happened?" Stephan said and Peter sighed. He wasn't in the mood to talk about it.
(See the end of the chapter for
And again Steve didn’t react anything he just let Tony do what’s he wants
He rubbed his face and look at Loki then said “I don’t know ok!?” then he looked at Peter and he was defeated, the boy looks so small sitting like that, it’s like he’s going to throw up but Tony can’t take it cause the last time he saw Peter like that was in the hospital when May died, “It’s over he can eat now.” He said dryly.
