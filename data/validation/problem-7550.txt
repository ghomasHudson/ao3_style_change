At least he had the workshop.
“Tony, no. I mean it,” Pepper said firmly. “You have training. I know this time at the ranch is important for your team.”
“Fine! Everything’s fine!” Tony said it too loud. (Shit.) Too little sleep and his defenses were down.
Tony startled. “Excuse me? SHIELD strong armed him in recruitment and now you’re implying you want to drop him for PR?”
Steve shook his head.  “Nope.  I finished that.  Wasn’t very useful—I’m starting to think that he worries I’m bored or something.”
(Maybe Steve was--)
“Then he’ll come.”  Natasha smiled.  “He’d never back down.”
“Do please forgive the interruption,” an elegant woman in her mid-fifties said. (Ah. Margaret Macmillan.) She was stunning in a full skirted, scarlet dress that, like her daughter’s, had an understated sweetheart neckline. Her dark hair was liberally peppered with grey, swept into a Gibson tuck. She looked up at her husband with an apologetic smile. “Tyrone, I’m afraid you really should come say a few words to the archbishop.”
Rogers looked surprised. “I thought you were too busy with the energy readings.” He hesitated a moment, then added, “Uh, it wasn’t just you, you know. Bruce isn’t either. I mean, he’s busy with scientific things too. I didn’t . . . not because, uh--”
Tony was congratulating Joseph and Janine Jabobs on their daughter’s admission to Harvard—Another Harvard student in the family! Oh boy! What a surprise!—when Clint caught his eye and gestured to his watch. And, look, he’d already collected Bruce!
“Tempted to hack your credit card records.”
(Oh! Oh.)
“Take me to the workshop,” Tony said, stepping into the elevator. “I’ll use the shower there.”
Pepper continued: “Anyway, we floated the possibility to the Captain and he had a few ideas too. Seemed very enthusiastic.”
“It’s okay.” Bruce patted him on the hand. “You can’t be a genius at everything. If I want a challenge, I’ll keep playing Steve.”
“One time, we had bad intel—got trapped in The Black Forest for five days while a huge German convoy went by. No way to fight through, no way to get back to the rendez vous until they passed; just had to wait it out. We ran out of rations.”
"Very well," Phillips said after a long pause, glancing over at Fury.
Rhodey sighed again and took a sip of his beer, straight from the bottle.  “I was on a mission—and, no, I won’t tell you about it—and they had rocket launchers.  A lot of them.”  Rhodey’s face went tight.  “They managed to take out my ground support.  At least temporarily, so I didn’t have anyone to cover me.  There were too many missiles all at once and I got hit.  Put half the repulsors out of commission and then, well—”  Rhodey gave a grim smile.  “--I fell.”
It had only taken a couple of months to get the first generation StarkSafe on the market-- a miniaturized, limited function JARVIS smart enough to recognize a safeword and call 911 within ninety seconds once triggered unless given a customized deactivation code.  Stark Domestic's stock soared.  (And Tony'd made sure that the Maria Stark Foundation had a special endowment to provide them free to low-income submissives.) According to a national survey, non-con and contract abuse dropped by thirty-three percent the year the Stark Safe went on the market.
“Right. I remember.” Tony turned his attention to his right. “Okay, Katie, hit me. What have you two cooked up?”
“A fine for breach of contract—the price point for various potential infractions is on page 144—or your removal from the Avengers’ Initiative.”
Up in his suite he hastily changed into his workout clothes and then perched on the edge of the bed, tablet balanced across his knees.
Tony wanted to tell the Captain he wasn’t tired, wasn’t going anywhere, and could stay up just as long as a super soldier, but Bruce beat him to the punch saying, “Thank you, Captain. I appreciate it.  Tony?”
“What!? A backhanded endearment? From you?” Tony ran his hands down his body. “Also, fyi, I do not have muffin tops, you little dick!”
“Well, she was laying waste to our forests, fields, and livestock,” Steven said, “She had already killed some of our best knights and the poor king--and Bucky’d lost his arm to her--so I challenged her to a duel of wit instead.”
(Had Steve been working on the research he’d postponed yesterday?)
uncool—Steve let out a shuddering breath and seemed to melt down onto the couch. Ever so gently--(as if afraid he might break?)--Steve let his arm come down around him. Tony curled closer, bringing his knees up onto the couch. He leaned his head against Steve’s chest and could hear his heart beating wildly.
“It was loaded?”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Yeah. Thanks, J.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Hey, I only just found out myself!” Tony said, holding up his hands in surrender. “Though, uh, maybe I should have texted you?” Tony was hovering awkwardly.
Tony looked over at the doorway where Bruce had arrived.
Tony couldn’t quite dispel the uneasiness in his stomach.
“Harry! There you are. Oh, and Mr. Stark. Hello.” The elderly woman who approached looked startled to see Tony and glanced back and forth between him and Harry a few times. Tony nodded. She turned her attention back to Harry, saying, “Oh, Harry, you really do need to come talk to the Johnsons. They’ve been looking for you for quite a while.”
(Good, good, so good,
“Mmmm-hmmm,” Tony answered. “Just hand me one of those cushions, will ya?”
Steve blinked up at him with a look of surprised pleasure. “What was that for?”
(Heavy shit.)
“Can you tell me about it?”
“You okay, man?” Clint asked with a frown.
Tony glared and his heart pounded.  He backed away slightly.
A light touch to his shoulder and the bed dipped beside him.  Tony raised Steve’s head with gentle fingers at his chin.  Steve’s breath caught in his throat at the sight of Tony’s face, his rich brown eyes, his lopsided private smile—not the bright, public Stark smile.  (I love you . . . I love you so much . . . )
Tony heard shuffling footsteps behind him.
Tony tried to turn over, then winced in pain. Pepper leapt to her feet, expression tense. “Does it hurt? Do you want more of your drip? The nurse said you could administer your own dose.”
“Right,” Tony said, curtly, “got it.”  Rogers stopped smiling but his eyes were still so big and wide.  He had this confused ‘barely smart enough to breathe’ look on his face.  Tony’s phone let out a soft ‘ping!’ (Good timing, JARVIS.)
“I’ll be there in time for dinner.”
another time.”
“We appreciate being informed,” he said with a nod to Tony and Steve. Then he addressed the team, “I believe you have about an hour for lunch before your next meeting.”
“Lockdown protocol allows me to alert you of personal communications I deem relevant,” JARVIS answered, then added a little coolly, “unless, of course you choose to modify my programing.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed.  “But from what I overheard—and by that I do mean ‘eavesdropped on’— it’s Fury and his minions’ who didn’t get it loaded.”
Tony looked up; everyone had a photo collage, but with slightly different photos.
“What?”
This chapter dedicated to N---.  I hope you're dancing with David Bowie.  We miss you.
Steve thought about the drawing he’d given Tony.  He spread his legs a little wider.  His cock stirred.
“Yes! Definitely.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tony smiled and checked his rearview mirror. “Nah. If it were too much trouble, Leila’d have no qualms about telling me to piss off.”
Tony nodded.
Steve had gone too far accidentally—it was a mistake lots of Dominants could make, especially as novices—but a Dom was unlikely to do any irreparable damage unless acting negligently and Tony couldn’t picture Steve like that. Then again, most Doms only had to adjust to a new body gradually at puberty, so maybe . . .)
“Steve sent me to tell you dinner’s ready.”
1) Pretend to listen to another of Fury’s pitches (bla bla national security, unknown threats, aliens, bla bla) before telling him there was no way in hell Tony’d give a suit to SHIELD.  (Rhodey’s my special pumpkin pie honeybunch.  And if War Machine’s gonna have a baby sister, she’s gonna be Pepper’s, not yours, Nicky-poo.)
“You too,” Tony said and really now wasn’t the time to be feeling all mushily romantic, but Steve was looking down and smiling at him and his hair was shiny and his eyes were—
Tony took a deep breath, but Rogers broke the silence first, asking, “Will you sign it?”
Steve took a sharp breath. He closed his eyes.
“Alec—loved your interview. And don’t feel too bad. Lots of people don’t know which continent Chechnya is on . . .”
Check mark. Never any dots.
It had been nice. Really nice. But somewhere in the back of his mind, Steve had kept thinking of Tony's mysterious present and he had to fight off a blush, a semi, and the urge to run off and satisfy his curiosity.
“You want me, don’t you?  You wanna drive me crazy, make me come down your throat.”
“I'm eating!” (Did I really just say that? Ew.) “I'm fine. I'm
“HHMMMMMMMMMM.”
With that, Rogers departed. Tony gnawed on his lip and turned back to the schematics.
Steve bit his lip, looking pleased but embarrassed. He opened his mouth as if to protest, but Tony cut him off.
“We haven’t tested our winter gear yet,” Steve said. “So how about some training outside to put it through its paces?”
"Plenty of ways to serve," Phillips said. "Or do you think being a soldier's the only way that matters?  What--farmers, weavers, dairy maids beneath you?"
“I asked you to pass the salt,” Bruce said with a little smile. “Three times.”
He was fine. He should have known something like this would surface eventually. Tony’d put it in every contract he’d written since . . . since
Steve hovered. He didn’t want to leave, but—
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tony held out the mug like Steve might bite.  Steve accepted it even though he didn’t want coffee anymore.  He had a sick, sinking feeling.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, sure,” Tony called without looking, “Come on in.”
Tony tossed back a double espresso and stumbled into some clothes.  (Seriously?  Why didn’t I say noon? Ugh.) His hair was a mess, but at least his clothes were clean.  (Wait.  This
“Oh?  What are you making?”  Steve leaned forward to peer at the lines of code and graphs.  “Are you still working on the new arrows for Clint?”
was his mystery Christmas plan. (Absurd.) Tony laughed at himself. There was no way Steve could keep a secret that well.
When Steve drew back for a moment to adjust his position, Tony looked so panicked, but as Steve pulled him closer his eyes lit up with— (Triumph? No, no. Just pleasure.)
“Of course, sir.”
#CaptainLiberationismGIFsFTW
Clint shrugged. “Who knows? It’s Natasha’s theory. That’s how it went down with whosit—the PR idiot.”
“And how’s Steve?” Pepper asked at last.  “Is he treating you right?”
: how’re they treating you?
“It wasn’t my idea,” Tony protested, digging his hands into his pockets.  “Bruce thought it would be good for team dynamics.”  Rogers blinked and looked around the apartment again.  “I’d have expected you to agree, quite frankly,” Tony added, feeling a bit put out.
Steve lifted it easily and followed.
Rogers frowned at him, opened his mouth, then shut it.
“Why thank you, Mr. Stark,” she said, somewhere between rolling her eyes and smiling amusement.  (Good.  That’s good.)  “It’s nice to know that you appreciate the skills I cultivated as an English major. Though you do realize--”
mention his 72 hour foodless lab binge last week...)
“Yes, clearly,” Pepper said exasperated. “I’m meeting you there and it’s going to be huge for photo ops; I want to coordinate outfits. So what are you wearing?”
Steve said it so earnestly that Tony wondered if he could lie. (Well, clearly, he could, but somehow Tony found it hard to imagine Steve lying to
Tony looked over at Steve, tearing his eyes from the perfectly ordered world of his own designs.  Steve was giving him this sweet, hopeful look.
not even touching, left him flustered and full of anticipation. As he raced into the garage, Tony couldn’t bear it a moment longer. Really, he should have at least gotten out of the car first—or waited until they were in the elevator—but the instant he turned off the engine, Tony blurted (trying for a sultry voice and failing): “So, did you get my contract?”
“What?” Tony asked incredulously. “I saw his first interview. Great stuff, really.
“Nah. It’s need to know, J. If they start pestering me, we’ll deal with it then.”
“I’m fine, Tones. How you doin’?”
“Obviously,” Tony said a little sharply.  “If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have a dozen lawyers working on the contract.”  There was a soft humming noise overhead.  Tony looked up at the quinjet.
Tony sighed. “I love you, Pep.”
Bruce took pity on him (sort of) and got a chess set.
“The TV.  Technical difficulties.  I assume that’s why you’re reading a book instead of, you know, using the TV?”
It had taken two pots of coffee and more brain-ache than he’d like to admit, but he’d finally managed to cross something off the list. Date: check! Now on to the next thing . . .
“I’m afraid we got more applications than usual and we’ve already hired our models for the upcoming session,” he said gently.  “And we’re operating on a reduced budget, so we have fewer slots than in previous semesters.”
was Steve: having received free license to whip, fuck, and choke him—among other things—Steve still treated French kissing like something to initiate with cautious inquiry.)
“I thought it was about letting Hulk smell you.”
?” Steve asked the ceiling.
Steve was still frowning. “I still don’t like the idea of you lying for me.”
Tony’d bought it. Tony’d bought it even when his mother quietly tried to plant seeds of doubt. Even when, more importantly, she’d point out that he could be all those wonderful things—smart, brave, determined, heroic—no matter what. Without even knowing it, Tony had taken in Howard’s brash orientationism over his mother’s soft-spoken, modest liberationism.
“What’s on my calendar today, JARVIS.”
Nothing.
“Uh.  How about ‘shield’?”
“Now then, gentlemen,” Fury said folding his hands on the table.  It did nothing to make him seem less menacing. “Dr. Banner and Mr. Stark would like to relocate to Stark Tower and take the spectrometer, correct?”
“Just, I know you’re Catholic and you’ve never had sex, so I thought maybe you think sex outside of marriage is sinful or something.”
Bruce rolled his eyes.  “Well, all my stuff is in my lab, but I could—”
“Yeah.”
Natasha was standing in the stairwell holding out Tony’s glass.
A pause and a little sniffle.
“Back at ya, amazing fella.” Tony said, grabbing more bacon. “Technically though I’m ‘sharing art I already owned with the public in your honor’ for Valentine’s day; it’s basically the billionaire equivalent of a really nice hand-me-down sweater.”
Rogers smiled at him.  “Can’t blame a fella for trying.”
“Yeah, oh God!
“Naturally, my dear Ms. Winters!” Tony exclaimed, plopping down in an armchair. “Wouldn’t dream of missing it. Uh, even if I never wrote back to your emails. Which, knowing me, I probably didn’t.”
Mollified, Tony nodded. “Yeah, I’d like.” Tony grinned. “I warn you though, I’m dangerous. People usually underestimate me.”
Tony smiled.
Tony’s heart twisted a little.
“Well, you’re very good at that,” Pepper said with a smile.
KIRK: Of course.
(Fuck.)
Tony’s smile dimmed. “Uh, picking you up for our science date? You said we’d go over the Thanksgiving data again, remember?”
Tony caught Steve’s hand and pressed it to his chest, so he could feel the outline of the dogtags under Tony’s tux.
, “Uh-oh.”
And, hey, he wouldn’t mind scoring a few on Captain Self-Righteous.
“Well, sure,” Steve said uncertainly, “I mean, yes, but I’m sure you have far more experience and--”
“I thought we were a team, damn it,” Cap said.
“Uh, yes, thank you.” Rogers looked up startled from his thoughts. “Thank you, Mr. Stark.” He took a seat in the armchair on the left. Tony nodded.
Steve flushed and Tony added, “And I find all of that unspeakably hot.  And amazing.  And sweet.”  He kissed Steve gently.  “And, yeah, I can probably teach you.”  Steve squirmed a little in his arms, stomach going tight at the thought.  Tony bit his earlobe and whispered, “Baby, I’ll train you to take it.  I’ll keep you tied down on your knees until you can stay open for me, until I can fuck your throat.”  Steve gasped, cock stirring again.  “Is that what you want?”
Tony frowned and clenched the blowtorch a little tighter.
Rogers frowned.
Fury turned to Steve. “Captain? A word.”
Happy Valentine's day, everybody!  Hope you liked it!
When Tony turned he found Steve bending over to look at Dummy who was energetically waving a fabric scrap at him.
“Good,” she said with satisfaction. “Would you be free for a meeting sometime soon? Tomorrow perhaps?”
Steve was still stroking his hair and murmuring indistinct terms of endearment as Tony sank into a warm, contented slumber.
“I’m an alcoholic,” he said flatly. “I’m always drunk.”
“Awww, babe, are you gonna carry my books to class for me too?”
He didn’t get a text.
“Of course you did! It’s a classic!” Tony said. He turned to Bruce. “Do you want to finish off the chow mein? I know it’s a favorite of yours.”
“Uh, yeah,” Steve answered.
“If you ever need anything, you let me know,” she said. “Orientational minorities have stick together around here, you know? We never get the respect we deserve.”
Bruce nodded. “Glad I could help.” He stared at the chart in silence a few moments before adding, “I—it was . . .
“Tony?  Start you with a drink?”  Jake asked, eyebrows raised.
Natasha threw back the rest of her vodka and smiled.  “Taken care of.”
Steve felt raw, all bruised up.  He gave a tight nod.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tony took a deep breath and tried it out, his gaze fixed on the coffee pot: “I feel like you don’t want to—“ (Fuck me.) “Uh, be
“Don’t forget to get some sleep though, ok?” Steve said, looking a little concerned. “Big day tomorrow. You need your rest.”
Tony turned to Steve with a wry smile.  “Little mishap in the shop.  One of my robots and, really, can’t work without coffee, ya know?”  Steve nodded.  “Top secret Avengers gear—work in progress.  Will tell you all about it later if it works.  Which it will, ‘cause I’m a genius.”  He gave Steve a wink, then gathered the coffee machine in his arms and started towards the elevator.
Chapter 17
“Steve?” Tony said, his voice a little uncertain.  “Can I ask you something else?”
“You were!?” Harry looked overjoyed.
Clint continued, with a loud snort, “Iron America romance? Seriously? I mean, fine, they write trash and are total assholes, so obviously they’re gonna pair the only sub on the team off with
“The King has requested your first audience be alone,” Sir James told him.
The Avengers all shook their heads.  Agent Dominick got to his feet immediately.
Steve cut himself off, shaking his head. “Sorry.”
“Good night.”
“I’ll contact them each directly.”
(He likes it!  He likes that I’m shy and awkward, that I bow my head and blush.  He thinks it’s
“Whatever you want, I’ll get it, ok?” Tony said. “But, I just, I wasn’t sure if any of these was
“That’s not much of an answer, man,” Rhodey said.
(Please don't hate me.)
Tony sauntered over and sat down next to Steve on the bench. Steve pulled his drawing close, out of Tony’s sight.
pretty tired so . . .”
Steve propped up on one elbow to look at Tony.  His expression was curious and intent, but not distressed in the least.  (Good sign!)  Reassured, Tony continued.
“With pleasure, sir.”
“Looking forward to being out with you, as your sub for the first time,” Tony said with a smile.  “Not looking forward to some of the reactions we’ll get, but it’s not my first rodeo.” He shrugged, then smiled again, “But I refuse to let anyone spoil our night out for us, ok?”
“I’ve got the meeting with Langdon Corp and Boeing on Tuesday.”
(Though he could feel that Rebecca was itching to get him alone to ask for the scoop on Steve.  Well, she’d just have to wait.)
When Rhodey’d first invited Tony over for Christmas that miserable winter after his parents died, he’d been about to accept until Rhodey got to describing all the glorious attractions: stockings, two trees, traditional cooking, church—quite a bit of church—and grandparents and uncles and aunties and a veritable horde of cousins. Just hearing about it had nearly sent teenage Tony into a social anxiety attack.

“Well, I couldn’t handle the cold very well as a kid. I used to watch the other kids from the window and wish . . .” He trailed off for a moment. “Then
than with the guy who wanted to pull out his chair and make him eggs, but who ever said Tony made sense?  Maybe it was because, for all their complicated past, Tony felt like he knew what Natasha wanted from him now.  Rogers?  Not so much.
Tony gestured at Steve’s unbuttoned coat and said, “For God’s sake, bundle up! It’s freezing out there. Can’t have Captain America catching pneumonia on my watch.”
“I didn’t realize they’d been sending you down to the labs,” Tony said, hoping it would be enough of a prompt.
On a cold, wet day in late November, Stark had showed them all to their suites and then to the common areas that he’d designed for them to share— the patio on the roof, the huge kitchen, the (of course) lavish bar, the vast living room.  And, sure, the furniture was a little weird looking and  a little cold, like so many of the sleek new things around him, but Steve felt pretty sure he could get used to it.  So, that first morning in the Tower, Steve came up to eat breakfast with the others.  Nobody was there.  He read the paper in a huge leather armchair.  Nobody came up.  Eventually, he went for a run and then retreated to his own far too large, far too lavish suite.  That evening he went back to the common room to read yet another history book.  Nobody was there.  He tried again the next day.  Nobody was there.
, Bruce dropped by Steve’s suite to wish him “happy holidays.”  He was going to an academic conference in Buenos Aires and decided to stay on for a while to do some sightseeing.  Steve wished him a pleasant trip.
Tony sighed and sat heavily on the bench.
even his motorcycle had “Dom” in the name.)
“Well,” Rhodes said briskly.  “And you?”
(“Ages.” Like, five hours…)
“Humph.  Good point.  All right then, foot massage is your just punishment.”
Tony just nodded.
“Ok, everybody,” Steve called. “Let’s go!”
Tony hurried into his clothes.
He usually didn’t skim in erotic scenarios; that warm, extra-relaxed state normally came from service-y cuddling with Pepper and (maybe once) with Rhodey. But Steve’s firm affection and tender Dominance had gotten him there effortlessly. It was nice. A good sign. (Maybe someday he’d—) Tony shook his head. (No. Stop.)
“Gotta close the portal,” Tony said around the lump in his throat.
Steve looked at him quizzically.
“Was it just the accumulation that was too much?” Tony asked. “Or did I touch on a specific trigger?  Or was it something else?”
“I think it’s admirable,” Rogers said earnestly. “You have so many demands on your time, but you’re still willing to work on the readings, even against the odds.”
“You and Tony?” Clint said.
“Fine!  See if I try poetry on you again.  From now on, I’ll call you my little closed-loop controller.  Or start telling you that you’re the exponential stability to my marginal stability!”
“You all right back there, sir?” Francis asked. “Need me to go more slowly?”
They stared at each other for a few moments.
A quick snack, then a real bed.  No, a shower then a real bed.  No, no, bed then shower.  But food first.  Food.  Tony rubbed his neck and stumbled a little bit on the way into the kitchen.  He blinked.

“Okay,” Tony said, pensively, “I’ll talk to Gina.”
, so get your butt over here and work your magic, Stark.”
Tony nodded, grabbed a sandwich and took an absent bite, turning back to the schematics.
“Besides,” Tony said, rejoining the conversation, “we don’t need your technical support. Dr. Banner and I have created a temporary containment unit in case the Hulk has an . . . incident.”
Steve’s mouth twisted bitterly.  “They bet on who’d be able to get Tony down first—‘by whatever means necessary.’”
her would have been fine with Tony too.  But no—they just weren’t emotionally and orientationally compatible.  (And deep down, he knew it was relief he felt not disappointment—relief that they could never try, so he could never fuck it up.)
(Perfect.)  Crunching numbers would be the ideal distraction.  And while working with Bruce, he’d savor how very wrong Pepper had been.  (And not worry about Pepper.  Or Steve.)
He dropped.  Hard.  So hard, JARVIS called Pepper.
Steve shook his head. “It wouldn’t have been fair to ask them to fire Ruth, especially since she had two children to feed. Really, she needed Anna and Luca more than I did.”
The lady smiling up at him was in her sixties, barely five feet tall and hardly  a hundred pounds, her long graying hair pulled back in a loose bun.
(Yeah,
Tony frowned. “Why?”
“Longer than I’d care to admit,” Tony said, fluttering his eyelashes and giving Bruce a playful look.
Tony headed for the elevator and, very softly behind him, he heard Bruce say, “JARVIS?  About earlier. I’m sorry.”
Soon, he drifted back under.
“ . . . Steve . . .”
Fury didn’t react, just looked at Tony with that motionless impassivity that made Tony want to fidget. But he fucking refused to fidget. Tony refused to look away first too. So he just stood there, staring Fury down. He didn’t know what was going on yet, but he’d be damned if he’d let Fury win.
Pepper was flat out wrong about them. He loved Tony and Tony loved him. He'd first started falling in love with Tony exactly because Tony saw him as Steve, just Steve, not Captain America from the newsreels and the comics. Tony understood him. Tony let him be shy and awkward and afraid and disoriented. Tony loved Steve's eyes best of all.
Tony blinked.  His heart sped a little and his cheeks felt slightly warm, but it was just the exertion of flying the suit.  Contrary to popular opinion, it was quite physically demanding.
“I’m starting to resent the frequency with which this question is asked of me, you know.”
Dom put up his fists and started bouncing on his feet. His grin was nearly manic.
“I was a dishwasher before I was a soldier, remember?” Steve said with a smile, rubbing cheese from one of the plates.
“Just think,” Tony said, “You loved the idea of me, and I
“If you want to pester somebody’s cooking, go pester the Captain!” Mrs. Rhodes added as Tony walked away. He paused.
Steve nodded.  “Honestly, I can’t fault him for that.”  Steve sighed and raked his fingers through his hair. “We may not be a conventional unit, but I’m essentially your CO.  The potential for abuse is right there and, well, I have thought about it.”

Clint, Bruce, and Natasha were puttering around the kitchen. Rhodey was frowning at his phone, jabbing at it as he typed out a text. Pepper’s head was tipped back against the couch and she was breathing deeply, sound asleep.
?) Tony was eager to give an answer.
Steve nodded.  Tony smiled and leaned up to give Steve a quick peck.  He cupped Steve’s face with one hand, caressing his cheek with his thumb.  Steve smiled and leaned into the touch, looking down at him with wide blue eyes.  Tony’s breath caught.   (So beautiful, so trusting.  Fuck, Steve.)
space.  (Not home.)   And definitely not someplace people might recognize him and make a fuss . . .
Tony shook his head; his chest felt tight.
Steve ran his hand down Tony’s back--
“Yeah,” Tony said, still trying not to laugh. Then he asked with sudden inspiration, “and when you were standing up to a bully back then, how’d you feel if somebody stepped in for you?”
Tony raised his coffee cup, then paused as an equally ridiculous explanation for Steve’s absence shot through his mind: maybe Steve had found a submissive and was keeping his new girlfriend top secret—even from his team—so she wouldn’t be a target for violence or pestered by the press and that maybe
“Ah, you’re welcome.”  Tony chuckled.  “Confession?  I maybe changed my mind about them a few times after they arrived.  I mean, roses—kinda clichéd, wasn’t sure you’d like them, sorta predictable. That kinda thing.”
Steve swallowed.  He remembered the famine, though he'd been young.
Steve looked away, expression hard and voice harsh. “I’ll come here and be polite and drink and make small talk, because it’s the right thing to do and I want to help, but I’m not gonna sing and dance on command.” He took a sharp breath. “I’m not a performing monkey, not anymore; left that behind with the USO tour. They can’t just . . . Just . . .”
“Hey!” Tony said indignantly. (
(Tony hadn’t been to Mass on Christmas Eve since his mother died.)
Ta-da!
about it.  As if to say:
“What the fucking fuck?” Tony yelled.  He tried to get around Rogers who remained stubbornly in the way.  “Bruce, Jesus, don’t listen to those A-holes.  We’re good.  Let’s just go.”
Tony drained the rest of his mug and poured some more coffee, then turned to the projection.  (Not with baited breath.  Of course not.)
(Shit! Don’t say that! He already felt bad; don’t make it sound more rapey.)
“Mr. Stark, that’s entirely unnecessary.” Rogers looked almost pained.  “I really only need a bedroom.  Access to a kitchen would be great, but it’s--”
“Hi, Tony,” Steve said softly, reaching for Tony’s hand and leaning in to kiss him on the cheek.
Steve shrugged and looked away. After a few long moments, he said, “It’s November 19th."  There was a long pause, but Tony didn’t press. (His heart was racing.) Steve swallowed, then cleared his throat, and added softly, “Today. It’s Bucky’s birthday, my best friend. He’d a been 29. In 1942, anyway.”
Tony should have known it couldn’t last.
Steve shook his head and gave an amused little snort.  “Nope.  Business lunch.  Stark Industries something.  So he’d better not forget to eat!”
Bruce backed up.  “You don’t know that.”
“Okay! Well, I’m free now. Food? And what’s this project you wanted to show me.”
Tony stretched and she looked over with a smile.
Tony rubbed his eyes.  It felt good to work on a project like this.  It was good to use brains and hands and just sink into it.  But, now it had been . . . how many hours since he got back from Bruce’s lab?  Nine?  Maybe ten?  Not sure.
Clint’s stomach plummeted.  (He’d upset Tony?  Really?  Shit, shit, shit.)
“Me too.”  Bruce’s voice seemed almost tender.
“You shouldn’t have to.”
“But what?”
Clint laughed. “Eewoo phone home!”
Steve took a sharp breath. A few moments ago, he’d felt chilled but now the pub seemed far too hot.
“So it helped?” Tony pressed.
“Forget Rogers-- I think
“I mean,” Rogers said hastily, “you shouldn’t have to deal with that. Nobody should treat you that way.”
“The Captain wished to bring you coffee. This seemed a reasonable variant on Protocol 387-J12, however, on finding you asleep he had no wish to wake you. The additional presence of the small electronic device with which he returned still seemed in compliance with Protocol 387-J12 and was therefore permitted.”
He was exhausted and everything ached.
But that was a blatant lie. Hours more and he still wouldn’t know what to say so—
good.  Perhaps that was the key to keeping the upper hand here?)
“Oh, I dunno,” Steve said with a shy smile, “New traditions are good too. Park Chop Sui it is.”
Tony alternated between playing with a pen under the table—just something to keep his hands busy—and trying to make an ‘I Am Politely Listening (to Things I Already Know)’ face. One thing to be rude to SHIELD; another to be rude to Steve. (He was pretty sure Steve hated repeating himself almost as much as Tony did, but still…)
“Right.  And after that?”
“I’d like that.” He hesitated. “But, really? You promise you’ll wake me?”
like . . . like they were . . .)
(Uh, is he following some sort of official first date script or something?)
“Maybe?” Steve shrugged again. “I dunno—I haven’t really thought about it much. I mean, I’m a sinner now, I’ll be a sinner later, but on the list of sins that'll weigh on my mind? Making love to you outside the sacrament of marriage isn’t gonna make the list.”
“Well, if God’d bang you, maybe you wouldn’t be an atheist anymore.” Jackie winked. “Keep that in mind the next time somebody has you moaning, ‘
“So,” Rhodey said. “Pretty sure there's a game on. Wanna--?”
“Yeah, why not?” Tony said with a shrug. “Besides, the potatoes were making my hands all weird and starchy feeling. Could use a break.”
Tony tapped absently at the arc reactor.

With a bit more prodding, Steve soon was describing various movements in Islamic art with considerable enthusiasm.  (See you know tons of stuff I know nothing about!)  Tony wisely refrained from asking if this recent reading had been inspired by Steve’s research on the Iraq War and whether, like Pepper, he’d cried reading about the sacking of the National Museum in Baghdad.  (Yeah—depressing shit.  Best avoided on dates.  Up there on the list with ill considered PDA.  Oops!)  Tony found himself impressed, both by how much Steve knew and by how
Tony hadn’t danced with any of his teammates, but he’d seen Nat—and even Clint!—on the dance floor a few times. Bruce had magically disappeared into the crowd (or hidden in the bathroom), but Steve had been on the sidelines all evening, watching the dancers and chatting with anyone who came by. Tony’d seen a string of pretty young subs entreating him to dance, but Steve never set foot on the dance floor.
(And, yeah,
“Hello to you too,” she said, sounding a little amused despite herself.  “So,” a long pause, “when were you going to tell me that you’re remodeling the top six floors of Stark Tower? And
Steve replied with a blinding smile.
“Yeah,” Tony muttered.  “Like that.”
coffee boy now?” Tony asked, still typing. “Does this mean you pick up the dry cleaning too? Are you the guy to call if I want donuts? ‘Cause I--”
“JARVIS? Tell Steve I’m on my way to pick him up.”
“Hmmm.”
.  Like Steve could fit in the palm of his hand, and Tony could crush him or burn him up, consume him with the force of their coupling, and even if Tony broke him
Tony sighed and closed his eyes.
His eyes were stinging. It felt good to be held, to let Pepper take care of him, even a little, but he’d been coiled so tight the thought of really letting go—
“Well damn, Tony.”  Rhodey stared for a moment then broke out in a bright, wide, shit-eating grin.  “You lucky son of a bitch!”  He reached out to give Tony’s shoulder a rough slap.
“Are you ready for your first lesson, baby?”  he asked softly.  “You’re gonna learn to take my cock so I can fuck your face.”  Steve gasped again.  (Fuck!)   Tony kissed him gently on the forehead and whispered, “I’m gonna teach you.  Are you ready?”
“Ha fucking ha.”
“Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen! One more thing to look forward to at the gala. It looks like we’re out of time. Captain--it’s been an honor.”
“I hate chess,” Clint said shortly.
Steve grinned. “Of course you were.” It sounded fond, rather than mocking and something about it left Tony feeling flatfooted.
--bedroom.
“That’s a nice idea,” Bruce said slowly, pouring himself another cup of tea. “But I’m not sure, uh—“
“So, who else would you predict?” Tony asked.
they have waited until they got married?  The strange mirror world he’d been imagining dissolved into gray impossibility.  The early parts were easy to imagine: in a lot of ways dating was like making a new friend, but he’d never wanted sex with a woman and he never would.
Tony squirmed without meaning to, then went still.
“Maybe gin?” Steve suggested.
“Overall, you’ll want to think first about tone,” Katie picked up.
(Oh fuck.  Fucking feelings.)
Tony reached under Steve to tweak first his right nipple, then his left.  The little jolts of pain made Steve whimper and twitch.
“-- between, above, below.”
“Hey, Cap?” Tony said, voice a little hoarse. He cleared his throat and held out one of the glass balls. “Trade you?”
By the time Steve resurfaced, Rhodes was long gone.
Tony chewed at his lip. (No, that would require a wider gap between Rhodey— no,
Tony scrambled under the equipment, fumbling for the little screwdriver.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Steve has no idea what they’re talking about.
It was Rhodey: kind, strong Rhodey! Tony loved that guy!
Clint’s fork came down to hard on his plate with a clatter that drew a (subtly) disapproving look from Natasha.
Tony Y. grinned. “This semester’s grades were so good even Grandpa couldn’t be disappointed.” Tony seemed suddenly to remember himself. “Uh, Steve? May I--? Uh. I’d like to introduce Ms. Katherine O’Conner. Katie, this is Captain Steve Rogers.”
Tony stroked the soft skin of Steve’s wrist gently with his thumb.  He wrapped the first restraint tight, threaded the leather strap through the buckle, then closed again.  The leather was soft and well-padded, the metal buckles heavy and thick.  It felt like a second skin or like Tony’s hand clasping him firmly.  Tony closed Steve’s right wrist in the second cuff.
“Oh, okay,” Tony said. “Good. Just, sometimes, I get into an engineering zone and don’t notice . . . stuff. Even when JARVIS reminds me. Bad habit.”
He’d fallen asleep in the workshop again. Tony stretched and rubbed his cheek, which held the fabric print of Natasha’s nearly-completed new uniform. At the far end of his workbench, there was a cup of coffee. Tony blinked.
“Ah!”
“I was thinking Marcov.  Or Manelli,” Tony answered.  “Take your pick.”
“Steve!” Tony exclaimed as he saw the elevator open.  (Oh fuck.  Uh.)
not prepared for this conversation.)
Rogers said it with a little shrug, and Tony let out a startled laugh. Rogers gave him a sheepish smile.
“Hey, Dummy, leave him alone!” Tony called. Steve looked up at him with mild reproach.
Steve had started drawing again. (It was something to do. Something, it turned out, he actually still liked in this brave new world.) And he was trying to pick up calligraphy.
. Tony’d cherry picked the episodes to make sure none of them were too dark or conceptual—just fun action and shenanigans in space, with an emphasis on the crew all looking out for each other. (Not that he put a lot of thought into that stuff or anything like that…) The scattered remains of their brunch lay cooling in carryout containers on the coffee table. Tony’d ordered far too much food, counting on Steve’s amplified metabolism—he’d seen the man eat! —and though he’d put away a good amount for anyone else, for the super soldier it wasn’t much. Tony sighed and glanced over to find Steve frowning in his sleep.
))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
“Sir,” Rogers piped up for the first time, his tone disapproving, “forcing Mr. Stark to house military personnel would be a direct violation of the Third Amendment.”
“That’s it,” Tony said. Tony ran his hand down Steve’s spine, maintaining contact as he knelt behind him.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
“Protocol 387-J12, my ass,” Tony grumbled, rolling his eyes. “Seriously? Cap bringing coffee falls under: ‘previously vetted and authorized delivery personnel?’”
Pepper sighed heavily and added, “I used to think I could manage it, if I had the right co-parent, but that feels even more hopeless.”
Rogers and the ninjas were already in the kitchen when they arrived, but at least nobody had set the table.
“Seems like all of this—the Avengers—would put a lot of restrictions and complications on your life, Mr. Stark,” Rogers said seriously. “But you still want to do it.”
After a few moments Steve reached for his own coffee. “So, tell me more about this art collection?”
Steve gave a little shudder.
“Captain Rogers is still on the common floor, Sir.”
The elevator seemed slow (it isn’t) and Steve took long steps down the hall (not
The Avengers’ press conference was a consummate success. Almost as good as if the team had written the articles all from start to finish, give or take a few vexing subordinate clauses. The film clips posted online were fantastic and, though carefully constructed, looked informal and personal.
There was a loud thud and a pained cry.
“Yes, sure. Good,” Cap replied, still seeming a little . . .
“As if! I was going easy on
Tony shrugged. “I always want a burger.”
And sore must be the storm -)
Tony let out a long contented sigh and rolled over, half hoping to find Steve curled up—on top of the covers, fully dressed—asleep at his side. His bed was empty, but it left him more eager for the future than disappointed by the present.
“Bruce?”
“Hawkeye!  Chatter!”
Rogers looked up and saw him standing there, staring. The man smiled at him and suddenly Tony felt like he should have changed clothes for this, not shown up in a hoodie and ragged jeans.  Then again, they hadn’t warned him.  Then again (again?), if they had he wouldn’t have showed up.
”  He wants this.)  Steve took a deep breath. The minutes trickled by in silence.
“Definitely,” Tony enthused, rapidly gathering steam, “and I’ll have Vera Wang or Martha Stewart do the decorations! Or, no, wait. Maybe we should do that ourselves? That’d be nice, right? We can decorate it together and drink mulled wine and eggnog and stuff. And, if you get back from Magdalene House in time, we can all eat dinner together or something. How does that sound?”
“You’re forgiven, JARVIS.”
The liturgy washed over him and he sang happily with the multitude around him, starting to shake off the chill.  He couldn’t focus on the sermon (too many references he couldn’t understand), so instead he listed to himself the things he had to be grateful for.  (Thank you, Lord, for letting me continue to serve my country.  I’m so grateful that we were able to defeat the Chitauri, that we helped to protect New York and the rest of the world.  That we prevented so many casualties. . . sorry we couldn’t prevent them all.)  Steve felt a little guilty that he couldn’t make a longer list.
"Impossible," Steve breathed.
Tony held in a sigh and said, toneless: “Nope.”
Steve felt a little unsteady as he walked to Tony’s bedroom in the penthouse.  (Coward.  You couldn’t even hold his hand.  Even though you wanted to.  Pathetic.)  Steve took off his shoes and socks and, after a moment’s consideration, left them tucked off to the side of Tony’s sleek black dresser.  (It was just a kiss.  Nobody was even looking.  Coward.)  He unbuttoned his shirt.  (No, it’s okay.  Tony said it was okay.)  He folded his shirt and left it on top of the dresser.  (It’s early.  It will get easier.  “
“Lights please, JARVIS,” Steve whispered and the room went dark.
Cathy Dworkin had given Tony shit about appointing a Dom CFO of a submissives’ advocacy foundation, but he’d shrugged it off.  Isaac Greenblatt was the best in the industry and if he wanted to give up a vast salary as CFO at Goldman Sachs to join the fight against orientationism, then Tony said let him.
Tony yawned and blinked. Apparently he’d nodded off during
Thanks so much for joining me!  And, yes, I promise Tony follows through on the plan to Talk to Steve in the next chapter.  Honest!
Tony sighed.
“Sounds good, Steve!  See you later!”  Tony smiled.
Tony pulled off his cock, murmuring wordless little noises and caressing his hips as he pushed his fingers in and out of Steve’s body again and again.  There was a loud noise filling the room and Steve realized with a strange distance that it was his own voice moaning and crying out, as Tony went on and on, leaning down to lick at his cock until he was at the brink, then and pulling back.  Steve bit his lip and tried to quiet himself, but it felt like he was floating in some strange place where everything was desperate and urgent but calm at the same time.  On and on . . . in and out . . . Steve threw his head from side to side, swept up in the waves of sensation, whimpering, gasping, moaning.  A single tear escaped from Steve’s eye and slid down his cheek.
Steve bit his lip.
“Steve!” Tony cried desperately.  “Fuck!  I—Steve, I’m—“
“Whatever sin it is you think you’re atoning for,” Tony said sharply, “I want no part in it.”
(Shit—where did he come from?)
“Potato, pah-ta-to.”
“Wait,” Steve said, “The entire engine and stuff? You redesigned it yourself?”
(Huh.)
Steve hesitated.  “I’m pretty sure it’s ‘lay on, MacDuff,’ actually.”  Steve paused and shook his head.  “And for somebody who doesn’t care about poetry, you drop an awful lot of Shakespeare lines.”
Tony blinked.
“Captain Rogers,” she said in that scrupulously polite voice she used with him. She turned around with a pinched smile, makeup immaculate.  (Maybe he’d been wrong. Or maybe women like Ms. Potts could cry without mussing their paint.)
Bruce took the casserole dish and put it in the cabinet by the refrigerator.
Tony nodded.
“Certainly, sir,” the AI answered.  Steve had finally learned not to be startled by him (it?), but he still looked up at the ceiling every time, even though Tony had explained that JARVIS wasn’t actually in the ceiling.
AT LAST!!!!!
“Dr. Banner is in the communal kitchen, sir.”
As Tony started an email to Leo, Natasha asked, “Have you finished
“Interesting fact,” Bruce said, “this was the first episode where Spock uses the mind meld.”
Tony waved his screwdriver at the screen.  “Only if it’s someplace they serve real food.  None of your trendy raw, vegan crap.”
“And thank you for the simulations, JARVIS,” Steve said, looking up at the ceiling.  “You did a great job making it seem like the hologram opponents were actually trapped in the nets.”
“Very French Canadian,” Tony said. “You’ll love it!”
“Hey, J? What time is it?”
“Wait for me a moment, sweetheart,” Steve said. “Just like this.”
“Thanks, buddy,” Tony said, setting it down again. “Now then, how about you gimmie your hand?”
Rogers shook his head. “It’s not that. I--” he paused. “My suite is beautiful and, uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but well, it’s more to my taste than this floor to be honest. But, well, this is where the team spends time so.” Rogers shrugged. He bit his lip, then added, “If you think I’m here too much, though, I can—“
Steve shrugged.  “Just working off steam.”
. Hey, Nat,
He should have sent his contract to Steve
“6:49, sir.”
“Oh, God,” Steve gasped, suddenly finding his voice.  “Tony,
at Tony, like he was drinking him in; or the way they each left a hand on the table, so they could sometimes reach out to emphasize a point with a little pat or a squeeze or a subtle caress, eager to touch and relishing the newfound liberty but not quite willing to venture so far as to sit there
Steve buried his face against Tony’s neck, clutching at him, grip tight, almost painful.
“What kind of sandwich did you want? I’ll bring it to you.”
(p.s. I promise P&P is still in progress!)
Steve swallowed thickly; Tony’s eyes flicked to his throat. He was giving Steve a considering look that made his insides squirm.
“Yeah, Jen seriously needs her more than you do right now.”
Steve wanted to rip Tony’s clothes off, but Tony had been moving so slowly, so sensually—he tried to keep the same tempo.  Slowly, he pulled Tony’s sweater and T-shirt off as Tony obligingly raised his arms.  He kissed his way from Tony’s neck down to his wrist on his right, then on his left. He ran his hands across Tony’s shoulders, his chest, the arc reactor.  He kissed Tony deeply and caressed his shoulder blades for a while.  Eager but trying not to rush, Steve pulled away to carefully unzip Tony’s trousers.  Steve slid Tony’s trousers and underwear down his legs, turning it into a caress.  Steve dropped to his knees.
Steve’s silence seemed a little stunned, so Tony continued encouragingly, “You could show me a few moves, let me practice what Clint and Natasha were teaching me. Maybe throw me around a bit . . .”—Tony’s heart was racing just with the words—“toss me down on the mat and pin me there . . .
(I love you . . . I love you . . .)
“Fair enough.” Tony gave a little nod and a shrug.   Rogers looked pensive, staring at his coffee with unfocused eyes, and Tony wasn’t sure what else to say. He hadn’t been planning to have this conversation yet. (Especially after he’d gotten caught admiring his marks in the fucking living room . . .) Tony got up and turned away to refill his coffee cup.
Jackie tutted. “The Captain’s been on my list since 1988. For him, I bet she’d make an exception and co-Top in her star-spangled panties.”
“It’s getting cold,” Steve said. “I think I’ll head in now.”
Tony smiled and let out a little purr of contentment.  It had been a long time since he'd done something so service-oriented for a Dom(me) or Switch, even just a friend.  It felt good.  He savored the little sounds Pepper made, basking in the knowledge that this pleased her.  (And safe in the knowledge she'd never hold moments like these over his head.)
“So?” Steve repeated.
“Rare teas,” Bruce said, holding up one of the neat little packets. “Including ‘Iron Goddess of Mercy’ and ‘Monkey Picked Oolang.’ Really wonderful.”
This chapter dedicated to thatwhichyields and ds862 who gave me beautiful, hot, amazing gift art!
Tony smiled up at him and nodded.  “Yep!  Lead on, MacDuff!”
“Yeah, I’m good.” Rhodey looked uneasy. Pepper had called earlier, now Rhodey. It was weird.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Look out!” Tony cried.
Tony caressed Steve’s thighs, ran teasing fingers across his erection, then brought a slick finger to Steve’s crack.  (Please, please, please . . .)  Steve uncovered his face to stare at Tony, unsure what to do with his hands.  The arc reactor glowed, beautiful and brilliant, in Tony’s chest; it lit his features from below, casting shadows across his face in the dim bedroom.  (Beautiful.)
Steve left to intervene.
, but still. . .) There was a certain playfulness to the look Rogers shot him. Tony grinned back. (No, yeah, cool. Definitely teasing.)
“Twenty-two!” Clint shouted as a snowball slammed into the back of Natasha’s head. “Shouldn’t let your guard down.”
after Afghanistan. There were apparently more veiled ways to ask “Were you raped?” than Tony’d ever imagined! It had been the question everyone wanted answered, but wouldn’t voice directly. “Did they torture you? What kind of torture? How long, how bad? Any permanent damage?” were all next on the list, though the news coverage made all of that pretty clear, so—
“Mmmmm,” Steve moaned around Tony’s cock.
“You like that, don’t you, baby?” Tony asked.  “This is what you want, isn’t it?  To be opened up for me.”
“That’s the spot, isn’t it?  You like me nailing your prostate, making you gasp and moan.  Maybe I’ll tie you down and make you take it until you scream.”
“Look,” Tony said, holding out a cut-crystal tumbler, “apology accepted, I don’t hate you, so-- drink with me!”
Tony snorted. “As if you could ever run into me in my own Tower.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony?  Did Colonel Rhodes think--? ”
A small ‘ping’ chimed from Bruce’s pocket.
Tony ignored them and strode over to the coffee machine.  Somebody had just brewed a new pot, but it had the sharp, acidic smell of bad institutional coffee, the kind that tasted burnt even when it was fresh.  Tony didn’t really want it anymore, but maybe he should take some all the same.  It was piping hot so, worst-case scenario, he could spill it on Agent Dickface if he got too close.
actor.  He could fake his way through just about anything he wanted.  And, really, why would he want to do all that work?  It was so clearly all about Steve  (Stupid.  Selfish.)  Steve came to a sudden stop as if he’d run into a brick wall.  How had he not noticed before?
“Come on, man,” Clint said to Bruce.  “This is hardly fair.  You can’t leave poor Steve hanging with Pippin & Merry in the hands of the Uruk-hai!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Jackie laughed. “Oh good. I’ll put them in the Rolodex. And you know who else I just added, on the word of two
“Don’t pull that shit again, though,” Tony added with a frown, “because somebody else might be seriously distressed or creeped out and, I mean, you’re right-- it’s not cool in a ‘no means no’ kinda way. Not that it was
(Oh shit.)
Steve shrugged and turned to him. “Mom just kinda blinked and then said, ‘I only have white candles for you.’” He smiled, gaze going soft at the memory. “But our friend, Mr. Schultz, brought a beautiful cake, a huge lekach, and he covered it with dark blue candles. He even brought hamentashen for everybody. Not that we needed many; it wasn’t a big party or anything. Just me, mom, Mr. Schultz and . . . Bucky. Father Gabe dropped by too.”
“Tony!” Steve exclaimed with a big grin. “I—uh, hi.”
The creature leapt again and missed the rope—its friend?—by a good twenty feet. It wailed.

“Yeah.”
updates. Tony was just turning his attention to a new creature, hitting it with repulsor blasts in quick succession, when a new voice—familiar and comforting— spoke on the comm:
“Stay,” Tony said, his voice a commanding rumble that did something funny to Steve’s chest.  Steve froze.  “Shhhh,” Tony murmured and then he

,” Natasha said, and the other Avengers joined in thanking their PR gurus for their excellent coaching and for keeping the top douchebags out of the reporters pool.
“You’re beautiful, Tony,” Steve mumbled into his ear and drew back. He lowered Tony’s wrists from the wall.
Tony blinked.  It was hard to focus.  He licked his lips.  Steve shifted his weight slightly and the movement rubbed Tony’s cock against his abs.  He gasped.
Tony strode away and this time Harris let him.  Tony just wanted to get this fucking meeting over with.  SHIELD was like a warren.  Or a labyrinth.  (The bad kind, with no David Bowie.)  Tony checked the map on his phone.  (Hm.) The break room, but more importantly
“All right, Big Guy,” Tony said gently, approaching Hulk who was frowning at the stationary ball.
“Yep.”
When Tony rose from the table, Steve stood with a shy, questioning look and Tony’s breath caught in his throat at how
“ Oh, right.  Good.”
The sound of a phone ringing filled the workshop.  Hm.  JARVIS must be pissed if he just called without replying first.  Ring.  Ring.  Riiiing.  Jesus, where did Rogers keep his phone?
“It’s okay,” Tony said, reaching up to slide a new graph into place.  “Just busy.”
“It’s a beautiful tree,” Steve said. “Thank you for getting it for us, Tony.”
“I give you my word, Tony.”
Or maybe Steve would find Stark looking into the refrigerator with a frown. "Anything good in there?" Steve could ask and Stark wouldn't look at him, just shrug--not encouraging, but not ignoring him--and Steve'd say, "We could go grab pizza." And then Stark'd look at him and it'd be curious and a little suspicious as he'd think it over, then nod slowly, still kinda frowning with concentration. "Yeah. I guess we could." And Steve would smile at him and Stark wouldn't really smile back, not yet, but the corner of his mouth would quirk up just a little at the side as they got into the elevator to go down to Johnny Ray's.
(Not that Tony needed a Dom to bring him coffee.)
Tony was sweaty and greasy-haired, stripped down to an old tank top that nearly showed the top of the arc reactor. (And surrounding scars.)
“Good,” Rebecca said. “Any trigger areas you want to tell me about, or shall I just read it?”
“No, it is,” Steve insisted, then amended, “Or it will be.  Maybe.”
Steve visibly hesitated before shaking his head.
“A scotch and a Sam Adams, please, if you’ve got it.”
“Wow,” Steve breathed, seeming stunned. Then he added, sort of sad and wonderingly, “Time’s gone so quickly . . . I . . . I actually lost track of the days.”
“Yes.”
@KristenJohnson55
“Tony?” she said.
The little check marks appeared almost instantly again and Steve wondered if Tony ever had his phone out of reach.
“Bruce, come on! I told you I had a breakthrough. Do you want to see all the schematics?” Tony flashed them up on the screens, then said with a frown, “I mean, I could try to walk you through it I guess. I’d have to catch you up on arc reactor technology to understand it, which would take you away from the weirding patterns, but if you don’t trust me to engineer the—“

Then they’ll be here to do one-on-one conferences and come up with a proposal—then we kick it around with them until we’re all happy.
“Yeah,” Steve smiled and shrugged.  “Probably better get used to it though.  I mean, we’re *us,* right?”
Tony waved his hands in sharp angry gestures. “But, oh well, apparently all we’ve learned since 1969 is that subby boys are such useless sluts, it’s really all he could do to be helpful. Adams might as well have tattooed ‘only good for fucking’ on his forehead!”

“Absolutely,” Tony agreed. “Don’t worry. I’ll be up to join you soon.”

With someone else, Tony might have put on a show—canted his hips just so, arched his back, exposed his throat. (Reclaiming control.) But Steve had put him where he wanted him and was looking at him with such a serious, earnest gaze that—
Steve looked up and said to Tony, “You must be very proud. The little guy takes after you.” He said it facetiously, but it didn’t quite sound like a joke. Not entirely.

Rogers’ fists were clenched, his expression tight.  He may be an orientationist throw-back in general, but Tony felt pretty sure that he wasn’t faking his outrage.  He didn’t seem like that good an actor.
“Ok,” Steve said. He turned to Tony. “I’ll see you later?”
Tony shrugged. “You’ll do great tomorrow. They already love you.”
Tony felt a flood of relief, quickly followed by uncertainty. “So you don’t have a problem with it? Or think pre-marital sex is sinful?”
.  I’d imagine that taking him on a date is a little like trying to get him a birthday present.  I mean, he can buy himself anything money can buy.”
Steve was looking at Tony with wide-eyed admiration, as though Tony’d made the episode himself
Steve thrust in hard, nailing Tony’s prostate as he squeezed Tony’s cock.
Wet hot mouth, up and down, up and down.
A quick shower and an hour looping around skyscrapers and coasting over the Hudson had done wonders for Tony’s mood.  He’d considered calling Pepper, but he knew what she’d say so instead he called Rhodey to vent.  It had gone straight to voicemail and Tony realized belatedly he didn’t even know which time zone Rhodey was in at the moment.  Still, the crisp sound of “You’ve reached Lt. Colonel Rhodes.  Leave a brief message.” made Tony feel a little better.  Tony headed home and walked down his frankly glorious landing pad, armor unfolding as he walked.
“If you Hulk out, it will be okay,” Tony said as they landed in the quinjet. He put all the conviction he could into his voice. “We trust you—we’re a team. Seriously though, buddy, if you can science for me now, that would be better.”
“It was a long time ago,” Steve said, shaking his head.
There was a long silence; Tony braced himself.
“Tony,” Steve said, voice raw but controlled.  “Don’t move your hands.  Can you do that for me, baby?”
Vast thanks to everyone who leaves me delicious, nourishing comment cookies to feed the muse.  You are wonderful!
Steve kissed his hand.
Tony suppressed a sigh of relief.
try designing training robots that pose more of a challenge.)
“Got it.” Tony held his hands up in surrender. “No decorators.”
“You knew, didn’t you?” Tony asked as soon as Natasha entered the study.
“And what I got at the Dollarama!” Clint added.
(Curled up in an armchair in the Tower, catching up on world history, reading about “gay rights” . . .  It had felt as remote and unreal as Asgard. . . )
Steve grimaced, but complied.
JARVIS was quiet a moment before answering. (Triggering the self-harm protocol authorized JARVIS to report liberally on its trigger, but that didn’t mean he didn’t care about privacy anymore.)
Now his mind turned to Stark with less of a churning than a flutter.
?)  Rogers must have read his expression wrong, since he added a bit sheepishly, “Well, of course they have mass at ten also, but then it’s in English.”  Tony focused on his eggs.
“Like Sherlock Holmes.”
“So,” Rogers continued more seriously, “how much training do you already have?”
Clint shook his head. “Dude, I can’t believe you’re this slow. Like hell Cap’s playing basketball right before Valentine’s day. He’s probably spent nineteen hours walking around Bergdorff Goodman’s trying to figure out what to buy for the sub who has everything.”
“I know that,” Tony snapped.  “But it--  We--” He shook his head.  “I have to go.”
“Thank you, Jarvis.” Steve’s tone was subdued. He took a new pencil—bright yellow—from its case.
“I won't say a word until you say so.”
Steve let out a little humming noise and tightened his grasp on Tony as they lay chest to chest, circled in each other’s arms, fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.  (Oh fuck.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
.”  Steve’s voice sounded like he was breaking into a million pieces, like he was in pain.  “Please!  In-- inside me. . .”  His face was scalding; he pressed his cheek against his bound arm and closed his eyes.
All the air seemed to rush from Steve’s lungs in a desperate ‘whoosh’ that left him feeling half dizzy with lust.  He struggled awkwardly to obey, shuffling his knees further apart.  The motions pressed him heavily into the cushion and made his wrists pull against Tony’s belt.
“Hey, Bruce!  Tell those morons to get it to the southside!  And bring the fucking XE generator.  We didn’t make the damn thing as a lawn ornament!”
Tony rolled his eyes.
“I’m sorry, am I the only one who got the memo? Isn’t the Other Guy’s whole deal that he’s
Steve reached up to touch Tony’s hair—it was still very slightly damp, freshly washed. Steve felt a twist of something (jealousy? envy?) to know that Pepper Potts was still able to bathe her ex-lover, that there was that much trust and tenderness between them.
Just 5mm! It sounded so small! But it was enough you could see its outline under his clothes unless he dressed in layers; enough that it would mark a person’s skin if it pressed down, cutting off circulation. (He’d given the damn thing a rounded rim after napping across Pepper’s lap and leaving a nasty mark where the sharp edge bit into her thigh.…)
Tony opened his mouth, then blinked and closed it, distracted from his witty repartee by the way Steve’s thumb had strayed to caress the underside of his wrist.
“I’ll do that. Sounds fun,” Bruce said, then added a little more softly. “You’re a good friend, Tony.”
“You were so beautiful,” Steve whispered, pulling Tony tight and nuzzling into his neck. He pressed a lingering kiss to the mark he’d left. “You’re always so perfect for me, Tony.”
“You know,” Clint said, “Spiffy dudes in tuxedos. You two clean up real nice.”
(Shit.) Tony frowned and bit his lip.
Steve continued: “He said, ‘

“If we didn’t do business with assholes, we couldn’t do business at all!” Pepper’d yelled to cap off her rant.  “Now, do you want me to go to the fucking meeting and take over that douchebag’s company, or not?!”
“Oh, right,” Tony said.
Tony tossed on a pair of black jeans and a tanktop, then grabbed the hoodie he’d been wearing earlier. He gave it a sniff as he walked down the hallway.  (Meh.  Good enough.)   He shrugged it on, preparing to launch himself at Rhodey as soon as the elevator doors opened—he stopped short.
Thank you all so much for your kindness.  Your kudos and encouraging comments mean a lot to me and make me tremendously happy.
Mrs. Rhodes set down her rolling pin. She turned to give him a
NB:  I did a minor ret-con on the end of the last chapter; might help to go back and read the end bit...  Sorry!
Tony rolled his eyes. “We’ll see.”
Steve slumped.  The doors opened.

Thanks so much for reading and for the thought-provoking responses to the last chapter!  Several of you had asked earlier about healthy BDSM relationships in this world, so I hope the interlude with Sam and Rebecca helped give more insight into the world and the possibility of sex-positive, non-exploitative power exchange in this AU, as well as some additional information about Tony.
“Okay,” Natasha continued. “Too modern with the lip piercing? How about Jenny from accounting. She’s nice, she’s pretty, and I get the impression she’s kinda old fashioned too.”
“Fine,” Rogers panted, still on the ground. “It’s just . . . got a strong grip. But I—I’m fine.”
“Hey, Bruce!”
Steve leapt up. “Would you excuse me for a minute?” he said to Rhodey, then called out after his fella, “Tony!”

Steve whirled around, panting. Clint was leaning against the doorway to the gym wearing his weird purple workout gear. Steve swallowed.

(And here we are again.)
(First things first.)
Steve kissed him almost desperately and Tony swam muzzily through the waves of pleasure. Kissing, gasping, writhing in Steve’s firm grasp, on and on. . . It wasn’t subspace—(of course not, stupid)—but it was relaxing and warm to take pleasure from Steve and to give it in return.
pressed a finger into Steve’s hole.  Steve gasped.
Tony hesitated.
Steve licked Tony’s cock, a firm, wet swipe of tongue that felt utterly luxurious.  He did it again, teasing Tony, then lightly caressed Tony’s balls.
“I’m afraid that’s confidential,” Tony said seriously. “Shall we, Captain?”
. You can hang out with the team! It will be awesome! We’ve got tons of booze and ice cream.”
Clearly, he was trying to drive Tony insane.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“You know I’m going to steal some of your tiramisu, right?” Tony asked as their server took her leave.
Tony shrugged.
“Can I put Kahlua in mine?” Clint asked, gathering their dirty bowls from the coffee table.
person I want to see me like this.”
Sasha smiled politely--as if Tony’s words had made any sense.
, I could have gone to school on the GI Bill.)  Steve sighed.  (But that’s probably selfish too.)
“Would you say a blessing, Captain?” Mrs. Rhodes asked.
What the hell would he say to Rhodey?
“Creepy Bob?” Tony said after a moment to recover.  “Bobby C? Not bad.”  He caved to temptation and grabbed Bruce’s coffee too.  Rogers made no protest.  “Not bad,” Tony repeated. He drained the last of the coffee, tossed the cups, and turned back towards the adjustor.
Tony ran his thumb across his thigh, knowing there was a mark there under his jeans--bright purple, where Steve had nipped and sucked . . .
“Would you have dinner with me?”
His words did nothing to mollify the Captain, who slammed a fist on the table and hissed. He let go of the mangled fork. Jerry changed tactics.
“Hello, Mr. Stark,” she said, in a polite professional voice. “I have your order right here.”
, well--” Steve grimaced and shook his head. “It wasn’t exactly the time.”
Thanks for reading!  I couldn't keep writing this monster without you.  Four years and counting...
(He’d banged his head against the data enough already; he probably should clear his head.)
“Aw, come on,” Harris said with a roguish smile.  He had perfect teeth. “Nobody’s gonna expect
“That’s cool,” Clint said. “No worries. I mean, these are no big deal.”
“Sure did!”
“Yeah,” Steve said, pulling out the meat thermometer. “He was.”
Then Steve was sucking his cock, wet and hot, while a slick finger caressed his hole, not pressing inside—not yet—just stroking over his entrance in a steady rhythm that matched the dizzying drag on his dick.  Tony felt lightheaded and breathless, like the only things holding him up were the ties at his wrists and Steve’s hand at his hip.
(You idiot. Steve’s just come from
“Call for you from Lt. Col. Rhodes, sir.”
Tony jerked away and flopped down on the bed, with his back turned to Steve.
of recalculating.”
Pepper added, “Jerry would have taken your tablet away ages ago.”
(Shit.)
And Tony should just let her read the damn thing again for a refresher on the rest, but he found himself speaking anyway. Rebecca’s hand was firm and strong, fingers twinning in his hair, and Deetz was still holding his right wrist tightly in one hand.
“Hello?” Tony said cautiously.
As Steve stood, he pulled Tony to his feet with a gentle pressure on Tony’s wrists. Then—once they were both standing—slowly, fluidly, Steve pulled Tony’s arms above his head and pinned his wrists to the wall. Tony’s heart leapt.
Tony blinked. “The twenty-fifth? Huh.”
“No, hey, that’s not—“ Tony cut Steve off. “Look, just, you’re always cooking, you know? And trust me, you do
Tony tossed Hulk the helmet calling, “BAAAAaAAA!”
“Good morning, Natasha,” Steve answered. A pause, then, “Good morning, Clint.”
(It was a long time ago.  Before Afghanistan.)
“Is there any update on Richards?”
“Tony? Is everything okay?” Steve asked.
“Hey, Tony!” Tony called, heading for the kitchen. The others waved and offered a chorus of hellos.
“I ought to shoot you for your stupidity,” Pepper said, lowering the gun to point safely at the floor. “I thought you were some criminal here to steal Tony’s tech. I could have killed you.”
“Well then,” Tony said, taking Steve’s hand. “Follow me—Master suite’s down the hall.”
“It’s so nice of you to cook for us like this every Sunday,” Bruce said. “I was thinking I might try taking a day too. Maybe a mid-week breakfast? I mean, nothing this fancy, of course, but—“
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Steve looked upset as he said, “It wasn’t appropriate.”
Johnny nodded and, with a furtive glance over at Steve and Agent Dominick, took out his phone to pull up a photo.
“What do you draw?” Tony asked, hoping Rogers might offer to show him.
In the 1930s, Steve would have learned more about actual reproduction and biology than many kids in the USA today; there was no such thing as “abstinence only sex education” back then.
“Hey, Steve,” Tony said softly as he approached.
Steve laughed. It was a sharp brittle noise. “No. Not really in the mood.”
Thanks so much for all your support!  I'm going through sort of a rough patch and sharing this story with you makes things a little bit better.  I'm very grateful for your kindness.
The silent stillness stretched on.
anything to me. It was fine.”
“Yeah.” Tony said, pouring himself a second cup. “I’m upgrading your body armor. I mean, all the body armor of course. So, yeah. New uniform on the way.”
“Did you change the compound again?” Tony asked Bruce, squinting.
“Yeah, well,” Tony agreed, jokingly, “dating basically blows, but it’s still the necessary first step for Big Church Wedding, White Picket Fence, and Bouncing All American Babies, so you’ll have to suffer through it eventually.”
“Our ‘why the fuck do we love this asshole so much and why is it so hard to take care of him?’ pact.  Our joint mission to keep you sane, nourished, and in one piece.  It was too big a job for one person.”
And he’d carried Tony again, once three months ago. Steve had found Tony face down on the kitchen counter, perched on one of the bar stools, looking like he might fall over at any moment.  Steve had shaken Tony’s shoulder gently and Tony’d mumbled, still asleep, and swatted at his hand like a fly.  Without trying to wake him again, Steve had tipped Tony easily from the bar stool and into his arms, feeling thrilled and flushed and guilty, knowing that he’d done it before, but knowing also that this time was different, that he shouldn’t.  He wasn’t carrying Tony because he was drunk or injured or unconscious—he was carrying Tony because he wanted to hold the man in his arms and, without Tony’s permission, was stealing a moment.
What time was it?
FLASHBACK
“Are you awake?”
” the narrator intoned.  The Dom emerged to find a beautiful sub posed seductively across the hood, wearing a miniscule red satin dress that seemed to merge her into the image of the car.  “
“Just . . .” Pep was probably biting her lip. (Or, if she were extra anxious, her hair.) “You won’t tell your team, right? I know it’s silly, but it makes me feel like such a stereotype and a bad Domina to—“
Steve licked his lips.  “Yes.”
“So, who’s Pep want me to meet?” Tony asked.
Steve’s throat before leaving kisses along his jaw.  Steve shuddered.
It was beautiful, simply beautiful, even if Tony hadn’t made it.
Steve gave him a blinding smile and turned for the elevator.
“I could read you your twitter feed,” Natasha said.
“Congrats on the upcoming merger, Mr. Fields;
Tony slid a box across the floor.
“Three, actually,” Tony said, with a slight smile.
He rolled his eyes, but Steve seemed not to notice.
“I didn’t stop to wonder until years later, if maybe that ‘punched in the gut’ look on his face wasn’t just shock when he saw the blue candles.”
“Well, when you put it like that.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Looks . . . interesting.”  Steve glanced over at Tony’s copy of their spreadsheet.  “This what you’ve been working on?”
“Yeah,” Steve said, smiling.
“Hey, Steve?  Babe, you didn’t tell me where we’re going, so I don’t—“ Tony wandered into the living room.  He was freshly showered, wearing a tank top and slacks, and he had three shirts, two jackets and a tie laid over his arm.  He took in the sight of the Avengers sitting seriously on the long couch.  Tony took a step back.  “Uh. Sorry.”  He glanced at Steve, then looked worried and said softly,  “Thought you’d be done.  Wish you’d let me, ah—” Tony cut himself off uneasily.
It had become a bit of a habit for Steve to come down and work on his reports in the workshop after training; Tony fumbled around for an excuse to brush him off. (He’d left the Norton Dominator in plain view of the main shop and wanted to get back to work on modifying the engine, so he couldn’t exactly have Steve hanging out on his couch.)
Recent revelations and old conversations ricocheted back and forth across his mind.
“Sorry, sorry!” Tony called as he stepped into the kitchen the next morning. “Coffee then we go—not gonna make us late. Or you go first and I’ll catch up in the suit? Sorry—overslept. Was working late.”
doing this together—nobody can tell us what to do.  But they can help us avoid making mistakes that might hurt us.  There’s no reason to reinvent the wheel here.   And it’s not really that different from the research you did for the spreadsheet, right?  That didn’t seem weird, did it?”
“Thank you.”
Steve let out a little gasp and carried Tony swiftly to the elevator.
Jake was pulling a pint at the bar.  He nodded to Steve, then gestured to their table with his chin. Another smaller sign at the bar proclaimed, “Cell phones are a privilege, not a right.”  Tony suppressed a chuckle behind his menu.  When Jake approached the table he automatically brought over breadsticks and a beer—big and blond— for Steve.  He nodded politely.
at him, studying him in that way of his.
Tom ducked over to the drinking fountain as Rogers once again exited the mess hall. He let the Captain get ten feet ahead of him, then followed at a casual pace. He took out his phone and plugged in the enhancement ear buds with a smile, pulling up Candy Crush and putting it on mute. The occasional sound of chattering agents passing by was loud enough with the ear buds to nearly make him wince. As he followed Rogers with his eyes glued to his phone, Tom worked to project the oblivious app zombie the older agents all assumed he was anyway. (Blah blah Millenials blah blah.)
“I’m good with frittata,” Tony said. “Uh, actually, Steve? I really like eggs. I’ve even tried to make omelets myself! So don’t worry about serving them to me.”
“Uh, should I go take his phone?”
As Veronica led him into another twirl, Tony saw Steve standing at the bar, watching him dance, but when Tony caught his eye Steve looked hastily away.
Steve shook his head.  “Tony, I loved them.  And it wasn’t predictable.”  He looked down at the table.  “Nobody’s ever given me flowers before.”  Steve gave a little shrug, then looked up and added, “It was nice.”  Steve squeezed Tony’s hand.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Anyway, enough about my gorgeous queen,” Jackie said, pressing his thumbs firmly to Tony’s temples. “Got any good gossip for me? Any news? FYI, if you missed it—like you always do—Perez Hilton laid into you for wearing the same tux again to that gala, but I was like, hello?
When he looked back, expecting an answer, Clint and Natasha were having one of their conversations conducted purely in facial expressions.
“Workshop, J.”
“Oh please!” Dom snorted. “Uppity little bitch probably enjoyed the attention.”
She nodded, then opened the door and stepped inside.   “I’ll see you soon, Tony,”  she added through the open window.
Tony gave a little snort.  “No, obviously that’s not true because
With a nod, the scientist shuffled out of the living room.
Tony shrugged. “Once I thought to add mini arc reactors, the whole thing kinda solved itself.” He paused. “Okay, so I got in touch with NASA—they owe me big time—and they’re sending all their recent studies. Should hit your tablet in ten.”
turkey. For ten people.”
“Let’s just have coffee,” Bruce said, a little stiffly.
, “duty calls.”
“Yeah, sure.  Come on in, Cap,” Tony said. He glanced away, then back.
“A pleasure, Captain Rogers.”  JARVIS actually sounded
“I’m--I’m close,” Tony choked out. “Can I?
Tony grinned. “How about going to bed with me?”
Natasha reached out and picked up one of the tiny screws between her thumb and forefinger, examining it pensively as she added, “You have a bad habit, Tony.”  She set it back down very carefully and continued, “You idolize people. You actually believe that some people are perfect--  Pepper,  Steve.  But they’re not.  No one is.”
Okay, maybe Katie was related to Natasha, because Tony heard the “you’d better have a moment” loud and clear through her professional tone.
“Now, for the moment, I recommend delaying your press exposure--”
Tony’s heart started pounding. (Do
Ah, fuck--there he was blushing again.  Tony leaned his head on Steve’s shoulder and murmured, “Back at ya.”
“I love you,” Steve murmured against his lips.  “I love you so much, sweetheart.”
Tony went back down to the workshop.
(So much for blending in.)
“God, Tony,” Steve gasped against his throat.
Tony stepped away and threw his shoulder back, chin up.  “Every second of every day, every inch of my home is under video surveillance.  There is no privacy mode in my presence.  If you
“I’m sorry,” Bruce said, voice muffled. He took a deep breath.
“I think my sub is the best part of the twenty-first century,” the Captain says. The audience coos again and he adds to them, “And we already talked about how much I love Star Trek!” Scattered audience laughter.
“Da-da,” Clint snorted into the comm.
Steve jumped and dropped the spatula.
. Please. There is nowhere I’d rather be right now.” Tony gave him a tentative smile. “You’re my friend.”
“You’ll see him again, won’t you?” Natasha asked with carefully feigned nonchalance.
On the way to the gala, Tony ran back through the notes of all the important people who would be there. Who were the top donors. Who had political power. Who to avoid. All pretty basic stuff. Natasha and Clint seemed bored—no doubt they already knew it all—while Bruce and Rogers seemed to vacillate between finding the info-dump reassuring and panic inducing.
. People looked at him, but they always did. Tony was not only rich—they all were at these sorts of things—but famous. (Infamous too.) So, Tony talked to people he knew (whether he liked them or not) and let new people introduce themselves (whether he wanted to meet them or not). Politeness prevailed. The evening felt no different from dozens of others he’d had at The Regency, The Plaza, or The Carlyle. Little by little, Tony started to relax. He went to the bar.
“No.  Proprietary stuff.  I don’t know how to make it affordable on the mass market.  Plus, it’s good PR to have technology on display at HQ nobody understands.”
Tony resisted the temptation to laugh again; instead, he stroked a hand gently across Steve’s shoulder.
Again.
“Thank you,” Cap said, gathering the uniform and beating a hasty retreat.
The Captain stepped out of the elevator and glanced around the apartment curiously, eyes bright.  Rogers’ dockers and plaid were horrible, but he wore them beautifully.  (
“Yes, Steve. Please!
“Yeah,” Steve said heavily, his face tight. “There’s that. Sure. But you’re just . . .
UPDATE: I'm so sorry to leave you waiting!  I have a major deadline at the end of this month and then another in the first week of May, so things here are on hold until I get RL a bit better controlled.  Please don't worry, though-- this story is NOT abandoned.  I just need a chunk of time to do a bit of planning, connect some dots, write and polish.  So, more coming mid-May!  Thank you for your patience.
“Good.”  Pepper hesitated.  “You’re sure you’re okay, Tony?”
“Aw, man! You introduced Steve to
Tony was looking at him and Steve hoped he couldn’t see him blushing in the flickering light of the movie. Nope. Thighs would be too much. Something else then. Something more subtle…. Yes!
“I go home to the workshop and it takes me three days to work up the nerve to call you and ask for a date. You say yes and ask if I like Italian. We go on dates—long, amazing dates—and we talk about politics and art and Star Trek, ‘cause you loved it as a kid too. At some point, I know you’ve realized I’m Tony Stark, but you don’t treat me any differently.”
’s what you thought?  That’s what you think of me?” Steve bit out. “That I’m some sort of bigot?”  He got off the barstool and his sharp, jerking motions nearly sending it toppling.  Anger made him clumsy.  But it wasn’t just anger.
“There’s broken glass,” Ms. Potts warned as they approached the workshop.
Tony bit his lip.
(Maybe he’d start with Natasha’s.)
“Oh, absolutely,” Bruce said. “Ease into it. The slower the better.” His voice dropped to a morose undertone: “Maybe never?”
Nasty, cruel words from the past were closing in on him, crowding out what he wanted to say.
It was cold outside, even wearing a thick sweater. He really should have gotten a jacket. JARVIS flipped on the heat lamps without asking. Tony shivered and leaned against the railing as he looked out at the New York skyline. His breath misted in the chill air.
Tony hesitated. “Hey, JAVIS?” he called softly. “How’s it going? I mean, Rogers’ history lessons and stuff.”
“What?” he said, summoning a smile. “No, no. Just surprised. I mean—you’ve read my contract, right?”
for their recent piece. Michael and I already ran a few possible scenarios that--”
“Fuck me!” Tony gasped, unable to hold the words in. “Please, please Steve. Fuck me. Oh, God, fuck me!”
“I was small growing up,” Tony said, shrugging. With a laugh, he added, “Still am, I guess. But Howard always talked about how the greatest Dom he’d ever known had been small too at first, and I’d be a great Dom just like his best friend Captain America and on and on.” Tony swallowed. “I had posters of you in my room as a kid.”
“Yeah, sure.  All right.”  Tony added, “But no rush.  Whenever.”
Original Series.”
Tony groaned and forced his eyes open into a little squint.
Lately, he’d been so kind.
glasses of wine, and everything else he might do would really call for the blow-torch . . .
“Stop deflecting. What’s going on, man?”
The King cleared his throat.
“Uh, what time shall I--?” Tony asked, waving a hand.
(Leave it at that.)
“I just have this flash that he--” Bruce mumbled.
“Unless you’re charging him with a crime,” the Captain insisted, “you can’t just detain him.”
“—like a disgustingly conspicuous display of wealth? You bet.” Tony grimaced. “And they want their pound of flesh. It’s not really philanthropy for most of them; it’s networking or marketing or hunting for a nice rich Dom. Well, richer.” Tony shrugged. “But, whatever, I’m hardly one to judge. Stark Industries makes lots of important connections at these sorts of things. Pep will be there doing her CEO magic. It’s how things work.”
—that worries you, let me know. Okay, JARVIS?”
“Oh, well--” Steve looked sad. “I got sick. Really bad, for weeks. Eventually, they had to replace me.”
“Yeah. Good night. And, uh, merry Christmas?”
Steve glanced over at Tony as if asking permission.  Tony just gave a smile and a little shrug.
Thanks for joining me!  Sorry there wasn't more Steve here . . .Tony needed some time on his own.
(Fuck, fuck, fuck.). Tony’s heart kicked into high gear again.
Tony sent Dummy back to his charging station, threw out the now empty cartons of Chinese take-out, and skimmed over his Stark Industries email, then headed up to the common room.
“So that’s Captain America,” Pepper said in a neutral tone. “
it was the right call to model the training robots on storm troopers. Who doesn’t want to join the rebel alliance?)
“Mom?” Rhodey said, clearly pleased to be superintending introductions. “This is Dr. Bruce Banner.”
Steve added another note:
“Nope! No drawing, no sandwich.”
Tony grinned—he’d been practicing—and rattled off: “Gāngtiě xiá zuì bàng le!”*
Tony shifted to her other foot.
(You’re a good man, Cap.)
They were silent again. Maybe that was it? Maybe Tony would just fall asleep right here on the floor—maybe Steve would too. Or maybe he’d pick Tony up and tuck him into bed once he nodded off and—
“Chatter on the comm,” Steve chastised half-heartedly.
“Yes,” she said, teasingly. “The Wonder Woman armor is
“Nice to meet you,” he said by rote.
“You drive a hard bargain, Mr. Stark.”
“Scrap that, J. Send the chart to the back. Give me . . .” (Fuck.) “Give me 7344. Yeah. And run a double check on my calculations on, uh, on 7217.”
Tony scooped all the crumpled clothes up in his arms and tossed them into the closest, out of sight.  (Again, optimism.)  He slipped into his three-inch boots, grabbed his great coat, and hurried towards Steve, who met him with an appreciative gaze.
Tony dashed for the elevator and looked at his phone. No new emails. (Well, none that mattered.)
“JARVIS! Get Rhodey on the line, would you?”
(“I will literally die if you don’t let me suck you.”)

Tony buried his face in the blossoms and looked up at Steve from the corner of his eye with his chin tipped down to the side.
“Come here,” Tony said and guided Steve to the couch next to him.  Steve glanced down at the carpet by Tony’s feet, a quick darting look, before turning to Tony with a little smile and obediently sitting where he’d indicated.
(And even if he
“I think it’s my duty to be ready if they do attack again. That’s what our team has been training for.”
“And now the bobbin thread broke. What the fuck?”
“I assure you I have,” Steve said sharply.  Though it was Dominick who had spoken, Steve turned his gaze to Fury as he added with a bit of an edge, “I have considered it very carefully.  We all have. And I believe we’re committed to this course of action.  If that will be all?”
Steve went for a run.  It made sense that he ran alone, since nobody could really keep up with him and running was supposed to be a solitary activity anyway.  (So what if he saw tons of couples out running.)  It was winter in New York.  He was supposed to feel cold.  (So what if it was inside and out.)  He ran and ran and ran.
“I guess it’s helpful to have a certain separation,” Rogers says. “I might wanna give Clint an earful for leaving dirty dishes in the sink, but that’s nothing to do with Hawkeye.”
(Ask if he’s okay going alone. No, ask if he’d like company.) Tony couldn’t quiet keep the frown from his face. (But I fucking hate Church. And it’d be hypocritical!)
Jake looked like he couldn’t decide if he should be annoyed on Steve’s behalf or amused by Tony’s teasing.  He raised an eyebrow.  “If you want arugula, you have to order the Rustica.”
Steve took a long breath.  “Tony, I—”  He hesitated.  “I thank God every day for the crazy miracle that brought me forward to you.  To this time where I can love you and be loved by you.”
“Just--” Steve sighed and ran his hands through his hair.  “Sometimes I really hate SHIELD.”
The number “190” kept flashing through his head; he reminded himself there probably weren’t 190 people in a fifty mile radius up here.
St. Michael’s was good for him—quiet time to himself, a short chat with Meredith, and two (yeah, okay,
Steve shivered and realized abruptly he was hard in his pants. Tony’s body was so close they were almost touching all up and down, and Steve wanted it desperately, but feared that touch at the same time. (Not again, not again—you can’t. Not like last time.)
(Crap.)
Steve shook his head. “No. Not until tomorrow.”
Thanks so much for reading this!  Hope you liked it!  Sorry for the little cliffhanger.  I hope to have the next chapter written more quickly!  Cheer-leading appreciated as always.  :-)
“I performed a retinal scan,” JARVIS said primly. He paused, then added, “If my actions were in any way unacceptable, sir, you are entirely able to set new protocols.”
She found Tony crying quietly, curled in a little ball, hiding his face in his hands, still reeking of sweat and cum.  Without a word other than—“JARVIS? Please cancel all my meetings for the day.”—Pepper stripped out her sumptuous suit, changed into one of Tony’s giant sleep shirts, and climbed into bed with him.
Rogers opened his mouth, clearly intending to protest-- Tony was half looking forward to it, his heart pounding-- but then Rogers just took a deep breath and said in an even tone: “All right, Mr. Stark.  I didn’t mean to offend you.”
“I have an unpredictable temper,” Bruce said.
“You don’t have to do all this.”
“Mmmm.”
“Of course, sir.” Another pause. “I shall be most attentive to Captain Rogers’ wellbeing.”
A little of the hostility bled out of Tony’s body and he asked, voice curious, “What was he like?”

outstanding,” Carmichael piped up, then gave a glittering, practiced smile, “but my work is a little more specialized.” She turned to the room as a whole. “I specialize in military-civilian relations and have done some preliminary impact studies for the Avengers Initiative. With your permission, Director, shall we begin?”
Tom watched as Captain America strode from the mess hall. (It’s none of your business.) He hesitated for about forty seconds before following. (He may not have Rhodes’ robust build, but he was swift and silent on his feet.)  But Tom nearly gave himself away when the Captain stopped abruptly in the hallway and doubled back to the cafeteria. At the sight of the Captain striding purposefully towards him, Jerry flinched, but Rogers just picked up his untouched lunch tray and carried it to the bussing racks.
Tony’s hands twitched for his tablet, wanting to watch the video again.
“Pep, Pepper, darling,” he said, voice gentle. “It’s ok. It’s gonna happen for you.”
p. p.s.  Beta and I sent a bug report about the embedded image descriptions not working; still waiting to hear back.  Hopefully we can make progress on that project soon!
“It doesn't look like things are going well down there.” Steve helped himself to a glass of orange juice and peered over at Bruce's creation. Something with lentils and chickpeas. “He told me to 'fuck the fuck off' and let him work.”
“I’ve gotta . . .go,” Tony said with a vague gesture, not looking at Clint or Natasha before retreating to his workshop once more.
Another smacking noise. A loud sigh, then resigned, “Okay, JARVIS. Go ahead and tell me.”
Tony looked up at the familiar sound of Steve’s voice and took in the sight before him: Steve in nice slacks and a polo shirt, looking a little nervous or maybe sad. Tony felt a sweep of panic.
Steve shifted closer to Tony on the bed, head against Tony’s chest.  He stared, eyes unfocused, lost in thought.  Tony’s heart was pounding.  After a few long moments, Steve shook himself and continued.
“How’re you holding up?” Steve asked.
Tony’s stomach twisted into an unexpected little knot. He frowned.
Standing in the antechamber to the Stark Industries’ auditorium (now holding a swarm of blood-sucking journalists), Tony checked himself in the mirror one last time: his Van Dyke was crisp and trim, his suit perfection. (And some well-applied concealer hid the dark circles from too much engineering and too little sleep.) Next to him Natasha pinned back a wayward curl.
“Thank you.”
“Good night, sweetheart. I, uh, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Tony resisted the urge to shift restlessly at Steve’s feet, a nervous twisting in his stomach.
. Shit. Maybe. Shit.)
“How’s it going?” Tony asked.
Steve shrugged. “Sure.”
? Then, a little later, I was thinking hot dogs. You love street hotdogs!”
Tony rolled his eyes. “He’s such a diva now that he’s on TV. I think it’s gone to his head. But he’d do it if I asked since he’s gonna owe me always forever—I sent Captain America to him for a fitting.” Tony stretched. “Anyway, if I needed to ‘make it work’ at the last minute, I’d call Tim.”
Tony’s lips curled up. Just a little. (Was that all?)
“That sort of thing is bullshit.”  Tony rolled his eyes.
Tony pressed his cheek against Steve’s neck.  “How’s that, babe?  You okay?”  Steve nodded and took another shuddering breath.
(See the end of the chapter for

“With your permission, I’d like to look at the contract.”
“Don’t you want your concubine?” Tony asked in a sultry voice, leaning forward to look up at him through his eyelashes.
Steve let out a strangled laugh.
“Hey, come ‘ere, baby,” Tony said, leaning over for a kiss.  “It’s all fine.  Really.  Okay?”
Rogers chuckles. “Not at all. But if you ask me about them as Avengers it only seems right to be more formal. They’re my teammates and we work together, even if we’re not a traditional unit.”
taken Chem I together . . .
(Calm down, stupid.  They’re both fine.)  Tony’s eyes flickered from screen to screen running mental calculations.
“Yeah. Yeah,” Tony mumbled, feeling a little muzzy. “Better do that.”
“Yes, Steve.”
She laughed; Tony smiled at her.
And for the first time Jackie had asked if he wanted to “do something about” the grey in his pubic hair--grey he hadn’t even noticed he had. Somehow going grey below the belt made him feel
Tony couldn’t stop thinking about Rogers.
“Oh, I got those too,” Steve said, looking guilty.  “I’ve been meaning to reply.  We’re supposed to schedule a press conference soon.  And there’s a gala coming up, then another one.”  Steve bit his lip.  “Do you think we should still go?”
“Sure. Whatever they want’s fine. I’ll be there.”
“Birdbrain better love it—stupid macho Dom, trying to go bare armed.” Tony rolled his eyes. He tilted back a bit to bump into Pepper. “So, think we can come up with a market for any of this stuff?” Tony joked. “Think the board of directors might like this?”
“Shut up, Clint,” Natasha said, at the same time Captain America barked, “Chatter!”
“Yeah.” Steve smiled. “Sounds great.”
“Captain,” an Agent (another Tony didn’t know) said, “Shouldn’t we do some reconnaissance? Send Iron Man through the portal to learn more?”
He almost said “for a Dominant,” but that wasn’t quite right.
“Hi, Tony,” he said to his plate.  “You’re up early.”
(Oh God.)
“And I informed them you were in the middle of a delicate project and asked not to be disturbed.”
The elevator doors opened on the living room, pristine and impersonal as ever with one small exception. There was a small Christmas tree made of carved wood sitting on the kitchen counter. From down the hall, Tony could hear a rich baritone singing:
“Are you going to beg for it?”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Do you have any idea what you look like?”  Tony asked.  Steve felt helpless in his own lust, unable to move.  He let out a little moan and heard Tony’s movements speed up.  He was panting with each stroke.
“It’s hard to find someone who has a practical knowledge of finance, but also has expertise in math or science,” Tony explained. “You’d be perfect! And I know how much you miss spending time with math and mathematicians; it would be a great way for you to stay in touch with developments in the field and meet inspiring young scholars.”
. There it was.)
“Oh?” Steve said, trying to sound casual. “That sounds interesting.” He swallowed. “So, you’ve seen Tony? I thought he might still be holed up in the lab.”
“Tony.”
“Something like last time?” he said a little hopefully.
“Can he actually do that? Contractually?”
JARVIS complied and Tony spun to face Bruce with a (perhaps somewhat manic) grin.
Tony laughed.
“Pep! Pepper-pie! Pep my love!” Tony cried. “I’m kinda running late. Can I call you later?”
“Got it in one, soldier boy,” Tony teased.
Steve chuckled. “Right. Well, if you’re sure you and Tony don’t mind . . .”
“Harry, have you met my friend?” Tony asked.  “Sasha, this is Harry Silverstein--one of the only people at this party with whom I actually enjoy talking math.  Harry, this is Sasha Andreovich . And he’ll more than give you a run for your money talking about the Mirzakhani thesis.”
“Are you thirsty?” Steve asked, approaching.
“There you are, dear,” Mrs. Rhodes said catching sight of Tony, “I was starting to wonder where you’d gotten to.”
Tony didn’t know what to say to that—insult? compliment?--so he stayed silent. (There’s a first.)
From his seat, Tom couldn’t make out what he was saying in a low, vehement voice, but he saw Jerry go pale and start shaking his head and protesting loudly: “No! No, it wasn’t like that! Just some silliness!”
“Don’t worry, Tony,” Steve said, giving him another kiss. “He’ll come around.”
“Good boy.”
Phillips paused.  Steve waited for him to continue.  After waiting a while, Phillips sighed (looking disappointed?) and continued:
Rogers’s fists balled at his sides and he bit out: “Is it true that you ran a betting pool on who would be the first at SHIELD to get Mr. Stark into bed,
touch me again without my explicit permission.” He gave her a nasty smile and added, “Do be a darling and tell ‘the others’?”
It annoyed Tony all the more that he was.  The way Rogers had said “you're Iron Man,” tone full of admiration, bordering on awe-- it had been such a shock that, without realizing it, he'd had the beginnings of a perception shift, a hopeful realignment. . .
And I do appreciate you being 'round
“Mmmmm.  Funny,” Tony murmured.  He stretched and smiled, eyes still closed.  This was a good way to wake up.
“Thank you, Tony,” he whispered.
Tony’s mouth twisted, but the words (mostly) didn’t sound bitter when he said, “Aye-aye, Captain.”
“I'm good, thanks,” Tony answered blandly, not bothering to lift his head from Pep's lap.
“Good boy,” Steve murmured, then did it again.
“Oh, uh,” Steve said awkwardly, shifting his hips away.  “You don’t have to.”
Something reassuring. Tony should say something reassuring. He should, but he hadn’t had coffee yet, so that seemed like an impossible task. They stared at each other.

saying,” Steve grumbled.
“Never,” Steve said, the word warm and vehement against Tony’s neck as Steve pulled him close again.  With a firm caress, Steve’s hands mapped Tony’s shoulders, his back, the curve of his ass, holding Tony tight against him.
“You have to hang Black Widow!” Clint cried. “Don’t be such a spoilsport!”
“Oh, fine! Sure! Go ahead and ask about your baby instead of your best friend. I see how it is.”
“Hold steady!” Steve barked.
(Agh! No. Never open like that.)
—was tucked away in Tony’s wallet for safekeeping. He’d give it back to Steve soon, but he couldn’t just leave it lying around on the table, could he? It seemed private. So he’d put it in his wallet. For safekeeping.
But yes, clearly he had.
Joy to the world!  ;p
“Good afternoon.  Flowers on Fifth.  Linda speaking.”
Steve set the water aside and ran his fingers through Tony’s hair; Tony pressed up into the caress, anchored by Steve’s touch.
“So,” Tony said, voice cold. “This is Fury’s office?”
Tony’d never seen him so flustered and stammering.  He cut in:  “Calm down, Cap.  It’s not like I heard “hey, Tony, you worthless slut,” whenever you pulled out my chair.”
Like you would with a glass of scotch.
Steve flushed, caught out.
and felt at once irritated and disappointed when he got another, “Captain Rogers is otherwise engaged, Sir.”

Steve let his arm slide off the back of the couch, real casual, then let his fingers curl gently around Tony’s shoulder.  (It’s fine. Nobody cares.)  Steve laughed-- the guys in the movie didn’t look very good in dresses.  (Not like Ru Paul, who looked like a real lady in a dress.)  Steve put just a tad of pressure on Tony’s shoulder to draw him closer, so they were side to side, thigh to thigh.  (It’s okay.  It’s just our friends. They don’t care.)  In the flickering light of the huge TV screen, Steve reached slowly across his lap to lay his hand palm up on Tony’s thigh.  Steve held his breath and glanced over.  He could see Tony was smiling.  Tony gave Steve’s hand a little squeeze, but when he tried to pull his hand away, Steve squeezed back and held on.
He needn’t have worried.
“Never!
“Welcome back! Sadly, we have to let the Captain be going soon. But before we do, we’ve got some questions collected from the audience.”
“I'm not gonna give you a hard time about staying up all night-- honest!-- but I really think you should eat something. Brains run on fuel too, you know.”
“Deal!”
“Of course!”
Tony passed the picture to Rhodey.
“Fine. But the new training for us isn’t from SHIELD. Something I worked out with JARVIS.”
First, Tony tried to call up all the words he’d spoken.  Maybe it was something he’d said, there at the end?  Had some of the taboo dirty talk made it past his filters.  He’d been planning to try some of that out on Steve another time, but wasn’t going to rush it.  (Yeah, spread your legs, you fucking slut.  You’re gagging for it, aren’t you?  Such a filthy little slut for my cock . . .)  No—Tony was sure he hadn’t crossed that line without noticing.  He rambled during sex, but not mindlessly and even the filth he held back surely wouldn’t provoke
“I hope so.”
Tony’s stomach gave a little flop.
“Mmmm,” Tony murmured, pulling another big bite of noodles into his mouth with a slurp. The specs on the poly-aramid looked great. He hated not to do the whole thing from scratch, but the workshop wasn’t set up for that kind of manufacturing. Besides, Leo was the best. He’d take care of it. And
“Of course,” Tony said pouring boiling water. “I’m glad you came.”
!’ just like Anna used to; I tried to knock him out, but it was hard to know how much force was too little to keep a man down, and how much was too much and I didn’t mean to if I could help it, but sometimes I’d hear a neck snap or skull crack and the wet sound of--”
“I’m sure I’ve no idea what you’re talking about, sir.”
“Hey, Pep! Merry Christmas.”
“Did something happen?” Rhodey asked, brow creased.
Tony rested his hands on the counter and took a deep breath. (
“Your aerial work with Clint and Natasha is progressing really well.  How did it feel to you?”
Steve bit at his hip bone, then licked the bite mark.
“Who was your favorite character?”  Tony asked.
“That? You've always had a sharp tongue. Didn't figure that'd change.” Steve shrugged and the water sloshed in the tub. He gave Tony a gentle shove and asked, with a hint of playfulness in his voice, turning up his Brooklyn lilt, “An' whad is this? You think I can't take some damn cussin', Stark? Fuck you. I'm from fuckin' Brooklyn, ya fuckin' asshole.”
“I told you, right, that I presented real late?” Steve asked quietly, turning his gaze to Tony again. His eyes flicked down to the arc reactor and Tony realized he’d been tapping at it nervously. Tony placed both hands firmly on the rails and nodded.
Tony continued to pet him, stroking his shoulders gently.  The frantic heat of Steve’s earlier arousal faded somewhat, now banked embers rather than open flame.  The ropes around his wrists were like an embrace he could sink down into.
With thanks to all those who have cheered me on while writing this story, and especially for SeiShonagon whose insightful comments helped inspire some of this chapter's worldbuilding.
Tony’d washed Steve off with his favorite louffa—exchanging wet, soapy caresses, more affectionate than cleansing—and now Tony was eager to get things moving along in a more sex-wards direction.
Tony crooked his finger.
Full of pizza and beer, Tony relaxed back into the couch, then slumped over against Rhodey’s shoulder and drifted to sleep as the sounds of Sufjan Stevens washed over him.
“Cards tomorrow,” Natasha said.
(See the end of the chapter for
shaving for this. Chinese food and
Dom” but either way it was clear that Agent “Dom” Dominick hadn’t meant anything good by it.
“Call everyone to the table?”
“Thank you so much for a wonderful evening,” Steve said, still sounding breathless. “I had a great time. But it’s late now; I should go.”
Not that Tony’d asked JARVIS every hour if he was back yet. (Like a pathetic needy little sub.)
Tony’s eyes were prickling again.  (Absurd! Steve hadn’t even started . . . whatever it was he’d tied him up for.)
A screen popped up in front of him and Pepper’s worried face appeared.
“Hey, Cap?” Tony said at last. He sounded exhausted. “Help me back into bed?”
“So, how are the training robots coming along?” Steve asked.
Tony grabbed the dust cloth and drew it back with a flourish. “Ta-da!”
Many thanks to aries_taurus, carzla, Moonlit_Lampshade, and charmeandering for translation help!  All continuing errors are my own...
“So good for me, sweetheart,” Steve said, running his hands over Tony’s body. “So beautiful.”
Tony shot it a few times, just to be sure.
Tony blinked a few times and yawned as Steve shifted under him. (Had he dozed?) Steve worked one arm under Tony’s knees and the other behind his back, then carried Tony to his bedroom as if he weighed nothing. (Mmmm…) Tony hadn’t bothered to make his bed—he rarely did—so Steve set him gently down on the sheets like he had the night before, pulled the covers over Tony, and knelt beside him.
Sadly, Pepper went back to California, but they’d gone out clubbing to celebrate first.  About twenty people had propositioned Tony in the club—many who hadn’t recognized him, which was nice—but he’d just danced and drunk with Pepper and she brushed the annoying ones away like flies. Tony flirted, Pepper laughed, and Happy’d smiled as he poured them into the limo singing and giggling.  Fuck Jacob Lang!  Lang Inc. was Stark Industries now, baby!
“Uh, pretty sure I oughta be embarrassed by just how bad I want to,” Steve admitted, then asked, “What’s brought all this on?”
Tony tossed back the contents of his mug with a grimace.  Cold coffee. Ugh.
He pushed aside the blankets and got to his feet.
will be watching us this time, right?”
At Cucina Paradiso, the hostess led them back to a table far from other diners (who still ignored them) and Steve immediately drew back Tony’s chair for him, head held high, shoulders back.  Proud. Tony took his seat gracefully and looked up at Steve through his lashes.
“Clearly we’ll have to come up with an alternate mode of communication,” Bruce said.
Tony held his hands up in surrender. “Okay, okay. At least give me more news. It’s boring in here.”
(“He helped you.  Say thank you,” Pepper’s voice urged in his head.)
“In that case, how much longer do you think before we could slip off without being missed?  Because, I confess, I’ve got one last surprise for you back at the Tower and I’m getting . . . Eager to give it to you.”
“Fuck!”
Tony leaned closer, careful not to muss his corsage.  He squeezed Steve’s hand.
“Ah!”
Tony picked up the coffee and let the mug warm his hands. His eyes fell to the note.
Anticipation, nerves, eagerness, arousal—it was all swirling around in the pit of Steve’s stomach, making his breathing a little rough as he waited for Tony, losing track of time.  He focused on being still for Tony, the feel of being on his knees, the carpet against his skin, the heavy ache of his cock.
. . . Tony!  Oh God . . . It’s like you’re fucking me . . . Oh God, breathe. . . )
(Noooo! I want Steve to myself. Preferably naked.)
“My God man!” Tony burst out. “I’m an engineer, not a miracle worker!”
Tony frowned, fantasy fading. Natasha pounced, spinning Steve around in her grasp, kicking Clint away. Steve threw her to the matt and caught sight of Tony in the doorway.
, caressing the rim of Steve’s entrance.
“Steve?” Tony called softly, clutching the duvet he’d brought.
“And I’m not an idiot,” Steve said playfully. “Half in advance.”
“Be right back,” he promised. “Wait here and I’ll bring it.”
“Hey!”
Also, now there's an out-take!  What *did* Steve and Clint talk about in the elevator?  Read it here!
Tony frowned. If Steve wanted solo time with his buddy that was fine, but he was acting weird about it.
? And, honestly, I’ve been an outspoken advocate of safer sex for years! Do your research, ‘xxx-top-lolz5’.” Tony shook his head and tsk-tsked again.
Then Tony was dragging his finger out of Steve’s body, pressing back in—slowly, gently, carefully, sometimes crooking his finger and making Steve see stars, sometimes twisting his hand to pull and stretch his rim.  (Not enough . . . more . . . more . . .)
“Dummy, no,” Tony scolded. “Do I look like I want to play ball right now?” Tony took another long swallow as Dummy let out a low bee-boop and started to roll away.
Tony swallowed.  His voice was thick.  “I love you, Steve.”
“Oh, uh.” Steve bit his lip. “I don’t expect— I mean, you don’t have to, uh--”
The blue overhead started to go green-ish violet, like a tornado sky, then began sputtering and crackling like a tv tuned to static. The hair on the back of Tony’s neck stood up.
(Steve had his contract, so surely now he could…)
“Jealous, Tony?” Rhodes asked. He leaned his hip against the kitchen counter and smirked.
“And trust me,” he said, voice going low. He tightened his grip slightly on the back of Tony’s neck, nipped his earlobe, and whispered: “I really
It was
“Why not?” Clint asked. “It’s a Classic!”
“Fuck you, Rogers,” Tony said, voice low and vehement.  “Go fuck yourself.”
Rhodes was shaking his head and chuckling. He nodded over to Steve, then back at Tony and asked, “Seriously? Can you believe this guy?”
“All right, all right,” Rhodey said, holding his hands up in surrender. “But I’m coming back to make sure you eat dinner. You got that?”
“Tony?  Are you awake?” Steve whispered breathlessly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Other than Sam and Rebecca, Tony hadn’t knelt with anybody—friend or lover—since . . . wow. Since Pep’s last visit? Maybe. It was nice.
(7:30?  How the hell did it get so late?  I can’t have nodded off for more than twenty minutes or so…)
“I might,” Jackie said. “But it’s gonna cost you.”
“That was the crunchy rice,” Tony explained. “We had it with the pomegranate sauce.”
Steve was frowning—Tony’s smile faltered a little.
“On your six, Widow!”
“And don’t . . .” Tony stammered, suddenly tripping over his words. His heart started speeding. “Don’t . . . don’t try to put me under. It won’t . . . I mean, I still can’t. . . I--”
“Don’t be silly,” Pepper said primly.  “I’m not always right, I’m only usuallyright.”  Tony smiled; in that moment he missed her so fiercely he thought he could feel it in his bones.  “Now then,” she said briskly.  “You had a meeting with Isaac, didn’t you?  What’s he planning for the renovations?”
Rogers always greeted him from the doorway to the shop.
“You’re so beautiful,” Steve repeated.  “I’ve always loved looking at you. Sometimes I had to remind myself not to stare, not to look too much.”  Steve’s voice went rough.  “But I can look at you now—like this—can’t I, sweetheart?”
“Well, yeah. But
“That’s correct,” Bruce answered.
Tony’s heart was hammering in his chest; his palms started sweating. (Oh, fuck. Drowning, water, cold . . . cold . . .)
The server looked expectantly at Steve who was hesitating.
His mouth twisted as he spat, "You'd whore me out?"
“You are too kind, Agent Barton,” JARVIS answered blandly.
“MMMMMRMM.”
“So,” Bruce added, “shall we reschedule this meeting for a time when we’re all better prepared to discuss the matter fully?”
Tony glanced over as his schematic went to screensaver—Classic cars—then back to Steve.  Steve rubbed the back of his neck and looked away for a moment.
(Fuck.)
“You’re wearing them,” Steve murmured, eyes blown.
“Bruce!” Tony called over the comm. “I’m getting you to the jet! I need you in the lab.”
, but still. Not exactly professional behavior.)
(See the end of the chapter for
“Natasha, Clint, and I are going shopping for Christmas tree decorations and—“
Tony opened his mouth, closed it again. There was a lump in his throat.
Steve grinned, and shook his head as he continued, “And, you know, the next day, it’d be Anna saying,”—he spread his hands, palms up—“ ‘Lasagna, Steven. Won’t be any good tomorrow for customers. Here, here. But don’t tell Luca—he’s so tight-fisted, my husband.
“Sorry, Bruce. Gotta dash. And change and, you know, emails. And stuff.”
Steve nodded.  (And, damn it!  Just opening the topic suddenly makes it seem hard to speak.)

“Steve?”
(And yeah, that burned. Of course Bruce gave Tony credit for engineering and foresight and everything, but still.)
“Mmm,” Rogers murmured.
liking this one.)
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
(Of course you did.)
“Calm down, Rogers,” Tony said, jerking himself from his thoughts.  Clearly Rogers misread his silence.  “I know how to use a phone—I could call the Submissive Rights Organization myself.  It’s nothing like that.”
“Tony?” Steve called.  “Would you like some?”
“Do you want to?”
Steve kissed him, soft and tender on the lips, then murmured, “You’re so good for me, aren’t you, Tony?”
“What about Liu?”  Hill asked looking up, a little glint in her eyes.
Fuck off EVERYONE talking about Stark looking old! Subs should be allowed to age naturally. 1/3
"Your page said you'd found someone," Fury said in a deep growling voice.
Me: I SAID WHAT I SAID!]
“No, I--” Steve’s heart was pounding. “I couldn’t intrude and--”
“He might surprise you,” Bruce said, over the sound of his typing.  “Anyway, just thought I’d mention it.”
Steve and Tony took a seat at what was apparently their table and a moment later, the bearded guy was bringing Steve a beer.
“Ms. Potts has been looking for you. There’s someone she would like you to meet.” Steve paused, glancing at the other Dom who had spun to face the newcomer, then turned back to Tony. “If you’re done here--?”
They nodded solemnly and shook.
supposed to reassure me?”
Steve knew he reeked of desperation, but instead of withdrawing awkwardly the Professor only looked softer.
“It matters to me,” Tony said softly, stroking Steve’s hair.  “But you don’t have to tell me about it now if you don’t want to.  You don’t
“Self-pity’s a bad look on you, Stark.”
Thanks so much for sticking with me!  You guys are awesome!
A cloud drifted away and the moon shone brightly, beautiful and cold, in the mirror above them.
“You weren’t curious?”
“Yeah. I figure you’ve got steadier hands than DUM-E and I can’t actually do everything myself. Yet.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony could practically
“Yeah,” Tony said with another shrug. “Why wouldn’t we be?”
Tony waved it off and took a sip of water.
Tony took a deep steadying breath, then pushed down gingerly on the presser foot; the machine whirred to life.
As the elevator doors opened, Steve let his arms fall and pulled away.

“Now’s good,” Tony said, setting his fork down abruptly. “Just lost my appetite.” And he hated to ask, but they kept moving things around and none of the hallways were marked, so: “Where is it now?”
They walked quietly a few more moments.  Some event must have ended recently; the corridor was crowded with SHIELD Agents dressed in their full gear.  Rogers stood out in his dockers and leather jacket.  And, well, Tony always stood out there.  Especially next to Rogers, who towered at least eight inches taller.  (Not that Tony’d calculated or anything.)
“I guess so,” he said.  “You’re free to go if you prefer.”
“Good morning, sir,” JARVIS said, as Tony blinked himself awake. “It is 9:17 am on January fifth.”
Tony swallowed the last of Steve’s come, then let Steve’s cock fall from his mouth and pressed his cheek against Steve’s thigh.  Tony grabbed his dick.  He fucked his fist hard and fast, slick with lube, desperate to come with Steve still clenched hard around his fingers, the taste of Steve’s come heavy on his tongue, the sounds of Steve’s pleasure—almost pained, like a beautiful anguish—throbbing in his ears and the sight of Steve undone and desperate dancing before his eyes.  Tony’s hand flew up and down his cock, hard and fast, the sound of it loud and obscene.
exactly. (He'd spent three months in hell...)
Then again, running on a treadmill was boring as fuck so the distraction was probably good for him. (And Steve’s physique was a thing of beauty, in motion especially.)  Tony could tell Steve was still upset about SHIELD. (And maybe still feeling guilty about that long ago sparing match?)
Tony landed gently on the training room floor.  (He’d learned that lesson the hard way, thank you very much.)  Bruce sat cross-legged on the floor, right where they’d been training, dodging, weaving and shooting.  (No sign of the Other Guy.)
(Okay, try again.)
Steve reached for Tony’s hand then pulled him a little closer, giving him a little squeeze and a smile.
“Really?” Steve asked. Tony nodded.
I worried the pacing was a bit off in this chapter, so I cut another little scene at the gala.  If you’re curious—and the sort of person who watches delete movie scenes—you will find it on my tumblr shortly: ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com
(Too soon . . . There’d be time later, for all of that.)
.  He sighed.
Tony blinked.
“Wanna watch
work on it.  Bruce was there on and off, but seemed pretty philosophical about the impossibility of coming up with a solution in the absence of fuller data.  So Bruce would come down for a while, then leave for meals and sleep and zen crap.  (“Life-work balance in a non-emergency scenario.”) Sometimes he dragged Tony with him, sometimes he didn’t.
“If you say so, Tony,”  Steve conceded with an amused little smile. “But I
“To be fair,” Tony said, “That tree is so big five little Avengers will hardly stand out. It’ll be like Where’s Waldo in there.”
Steve reached out to caress Tony’s cheek.  “I’m great.”
“Smells amazing!” Steve said.
“Ah!”  Steve cried out again, as Tony brought his hand into play too, twisting and squeezing, moving faster and faster, urging him on.
Steve nodded and now it was Tony’s turn to strip him bare, button by button and thread by thread. Steve’s body was perfect—chiseled muscles, flawless skin, stunning proportions.  (Tony felt a little grateful Steve had done their first scene clothed.) Steve silently let Tony tend to him, watching with a hint of a smile as Tony undressed him, folded his clothes (badly), and set them aside.
“I take it we’re going to Jake’s?”
is awesome. Cap was gonna love it. As long as Tony started him on a good episode.
He hadn’t even had the decency to keep it on the down low in a coatroom or a bathroom stall, let alone to get an actual hotel room like a mature adult.  (It would have been so fucking easy too.  They’d already been in a hotel for Christ’s sake!)  No, Tony just grabbed what’s-his-name by his tie, hopped over that little side railing right on the dance floor, stripped and—
Steve swore under his breath. It sounded pained.
Tony inhaled two slices of pizza, reviewing code, while Ella Fitzgerald sang:
Steve smiled and took his seat.
Tony shrugged. “That’s even better.”
“Wore it last night.”
Calmly, casually, he headed for the nearby Men’s Room. (He didn’t actually need to pee, just wanted a moment out of sight.) At the Pierre, there were no mere toilets; even the men’s facilities were vast and sumptuous, beginning with a plush lounge featuring full-length mirrors, overstuffed armchairs, and even a chaise longue.
This is a very personal story for me so, as a kindness, I ask that if you don’t like something in this story, or the way it relates to RL, or think I’m Doing Feminism Wrong—
“And, hey, tell you what,” Tony said, bumping his shoulder into Steve’s and aiming for casual, “next time I have a nightmare, I’ll wake you up and you can return the favor.”
I may not have escaped unscaithed, but here it is.  All praise and gratitude to thatwhichyeilds for her unfailing awesomeness and patience.
portal.)
“All right,” Fury said leaning back in his chair.  “Stark Tower will house the Avengers’ Initiative.”
“Oh yeah,” Tony told Steve absently, “there’s coffee in the bathroom.”
“Hop in. My Rolls Royce is at your service.”
“Got it,” Steve said after a moment. He laid the table.
After a few long, even breaths and the strange lurching in his chest began to fade.
—just to hold your hand or have your head on my shoulder. When you’d curl up next to Pepper or Rhodey, I’d wish it was me. I’d stopped hoping, but I, I still wished . . .”
“So,” the Captain turns to face the camera, “To anyone struggling, please know that it’s ok not to be ok and to ask for help. It’s a sign of strength, not weakness. Please don’t give up. And--for what it’s worth, if it helps--I’m walking this road with you.”
“Technically. Now, stop deflecting and answer the question.”
The deployment satellite for Security Blanket was easy—there were plenty of those around they could just adapt. It was the unique mechanism that was hard to come up with.
“Sure,” Steve said with a smile.  Bruce was the only person in the Tower who
Tony went silent again, but Steve could practically
Tony glared at him as Bruce muttered,
Steve took out a fresh sheet of paper. He wouldn’t give up.  He’d just keep trying until he could get it right and then he’d be able to continue his painting.  He sketched out the familiar lines of Tony’s jaw, his cheeks, the curve of his forehead.  Steve took a sip of tea.  Earl grey, which still reminded him of Peggy, but in a good way.  His little studio—with easels and drawing boards, paints and charcoal—was always a refuge.
Tony froze, then turned to give him a curious look.  Steve flushed with embarrassment.  (Pathetic—so desperate for a little human contact you make it sound like a call to assemble. He’s busy, stupid.  He’s not lonely and he probably doesn’t care about Christmas.  Or you.)  They stood staring for a few long moments.  Steve looked away first, preparing to apologize—though what for he couldn’t exactly say.  (For asking you to spend time with me?  For not wanting to be entirely alone on Christmas?  For offering you cocoa when you’ve just told me you want coffee?)
Tony held him tight.  “I want to know everything.”  Tony kissed him—he’d meant it to be soft and gentle, but it turned out fierce and possessive.  Steve didn’t seem to mind.  He clutched at Tony’s shoulder and arched into the kiss.
Tony nodded and rushed ahead, “You can definitely wrap Christmas presents in the common room. And we can get a tree! You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”
“Did you make a contract with Sam on the way over?”
“I’m fine anywhere.”
Tony raised the faceplate and nodded. “Yeah. A basic one, but it would at least give some parameters for the evacuation.”
“Nah, I’m good, just lost flight capability apparently.  No injuries.  And, JARVIS, we’re gonna have words about letting the boss have a special ability it doesn’t use until the end—‘cause, seriously, if it can breath fire, why didn’t it lead off with that?  Why do bad guys alway—”
“Damn it.”
In the privacy of his workshop, Tony combed over the coverage once more. Not a thing.
Steve’s stomach clenched and his pace sped.  Tony was an

“I did really enjoy the movie,” Steve insisted.
Tony unwound little by little, giving a certain lazy attention to the TV. Together Uhura and Spock were inventing a new interference-canceling communications device. Tony’d forgotten what a good episode it was—he always liked it when Spock and Uhura worked together.
Thanks for your patience!
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn't mean to startle you,” Steve said, taking an exaggerated step back and holding his hands up in half-joking surrender.
He grabbed his mug and headed for Tony’s en suite. As he returned he let out a long sigh and groaned. “God, I needed that!”
Tony picked up the coffee, but before he could answer Rogers’ question, Clint cut in.
Steve nodded. “Yes. That makes sense.” A pause. “Thank you. I, uh-- It’s still . . . disorienting. Here. Sometimes.” Steve swallowed and looked down at the city.
Little dots sprang into life and Steve held his breath. After a few moments, they vanished. Steve waited. And waited.
“Isn’t my first time on this battlefield--and now I’ve got back up.”  Tony shrugged. “We’ve got a plan,” Tony said. “Just stick to the plan.”
“Wanna get a midnight burrito?” Pep asked with a smile.
“That’s what I’m calling our unexpected guest.”
Tony awoke in a strange bed. He stayed frozen, feigning sleep, for a few tense moments before realizing he was at the ranch and everything was fine. Steve must have carried him to bed. (Mmm. Speaking of Steve--) Tony reached across the bed. He sighed when he found it empty. (This seriously reduced the chances of morning nookie.)
“Yeah, that’s good, sweetheart.  Just focus on breathing.  Relax.”
“Cap,” Natasha said, “It’s been mimicking you. Why don’t you just have Iron Man fly you up as a demonstration?”
Tony was still wearing his clothes from the night before, his tank top dimming the glow of the arc reactor, a grey sweatshirt covering his beautiful shoulders.  Steve loved Tony’s shoulders—well-muscled without being bulky, like a classical statue only warm, so unlike cold white marble.  (And sure, Greek statues had actually been polychromatic, but that’s not how you see them in museums, so it’s kinda hard to picture them that way.)  Tony was built like Apollo, but he’d make a better Hephaestus—god of blacksmiths.  Steve smiled.  He’d probably like that.  Maybe Steve would sketch him as Hephaestus sometime.  Or draw the pair of them—as Achilles and Petroclus or members of the Sacred Band of Thebes, lover-warriors who fought as pairs in ancient Greece.  Steve shook his head, half chuckling to himself.  They’d probably look ridiculous if he tried to draw them like that.  Still, it might be fun to try.
JARVIS paused a moment before answering, “Captain Rogers has not left his floor.”
“You did, didn’t you?”
Steve turned away, clearly intending it as a dismissal, and went back to the couch where Tony now noticed he’d set up a little nest of blankets and pillows. His notebook and sketchpad were on the coffee table, along with a big pitcher of water and a small cup.
“But awesome?”
Steve nipped him again and Tony’s heart leapt.
“I started the coffee,” Natasha added.
Once they were in range, his Eewoo passenger started growing a longer and longer tentacle until it could reach out for its compatriot. Then, suddenly and swiftly, it detached from Tony and entwined itself around its comrade. Both creatures hurried through the portal with astonishing speed, making the loudest, most high-pitched,
Steve’s breathing was speeding, steadily faster and faster. Tony wanted to drive him wild, needed to show how badly he wanted Steve to have him.
“So, how’s Theresa?” Tony asked, eager to distract Jackie from the million beautifying procedures he didn’t want.
“Hey, JARVIS?” Tony called softly, taking out his StarkPhone. “Give me some
that.)  Tony held in a sigh and tried not to let his shoulders slump, tried not to give everything away.  (Great.  Yep, shovel speech. Woo.)  He was holding his breath, unscrewing things that didn’t need it in an attempt to look busy.
“You’re not too disappointed?” Steve asked. Tony shook his head; his chest felt a little tight.
Jackie ran his fingers through Tony’s hair, clucking his tongue. “What did you use in the back, a weed-whacker? What kind of billionaire
“Yeah! Be out in a second!”
Tony couldn’t blame the guy—he was still adjusting to the future. (He had trouble keeping Nixon and Clinton straight, for Christ sake!) Rogers didn’t have the context for the magazines or talk shows; it would just be a bunch of names to him and she wasn’t exactly explaining, except to say they’d all eat him up. And, it had to be weird to hear himself described like that, turned into nuggets of grade-A PR gold.
“Good night! Merry Christmas!”
“I’m so proud of you,” Tony said softly as Steve stepped into the car.
Steve paused.  He shoved the last of the biscuit in his mouth, wiped his fingers on a napkin, and reached for his tablet.  He added a note at the bottom of their spreadsheet.
“Uh, billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist?  How do
Rhodey laughed at something on his phone, then looked sheepish.
Tony took the tablet and eased his way back to Steve’s side, shifting slowly and carefully, until he could get both hands on his tablet while still cuddled up against Steve. (He’d always been a master of Tetris.)
Lots of ambient world building in this chapter, but I promise I won't let anyone intrude on our lovebirds in the next one...  :)
and put him under; couldn’t say or do in a calculated or explicit manner any of those little things Doms did to help their subs into subspace. He’d learned the hard way how much it hurt for none of that to work and the added pressure of a Dom who felt their ego on the line was too much.
“Huh? I mean, yeah. Thanks.”
“Just—I like an enemy I can understand,” Steve said. “Things I can study and master and then develop a strategy to defeat. This makes me feel . . . useless.”
“Muh…?”  Tony rubbed his eyes.  (Awesome.  Drooled on my arm.  Hot.  Really sexy that.)
“Not good,” Bruce muttered, rushing over to their beautiful device.
Tony kicked off his boots to settle on the couch and, after a moment’s deliberation, slid under the duvet next to Steve.
(Pull it together, Stark. You can do this.)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Now then,” Tony murmured, drawing Steve close. “Where were we?”
“Well, if you say so.” Tony gave him a little smile. “Fine. Photo. Count me in, but I wanna hold the drawing.”
(Of course he is.)  Tony smiled.  Then double-checked that all his marks were covered.
“Thank God, Tony,” her voice sounded pained.  “Don’t scare me like that.  My heart really can’t handle it.”  She exhaled loudly into the phone.  “Now then.  What’s going on?”
“Iron Man! Report!” Cap called.
ALSO! Nonymos wrote the most beautiful story set in an AU of the P&P AU about D/D Steve/Bucky.  WONDERFUL!  You can read it here:  http://archiveofourown.org/works/4508121
“—just know, I’ll be having a dozen lawyers look at it before signing.”  Tony tried to give the room a dismissive look.  “Great chat, guys.”  He put his sunglasses back on.  “Bruce?  Shall we?”  He turned to look at Fury over the rims.  “Unless you object, of course.”
“Uh,” Steve said, fidgeting in the car seat. “May I walk you home?”
Tony’s stomach felt tight; it wasn’t the hangover.
“Mr. Stark, please wait! I--”
“I’m fine, Tony,” Steve said, with what he hoped was a reassuring smile. “I just love you so much.”
He wondered if he should get up, but hated the idea of leaving Steve to wake up alone. No, he’d just . . .
Steve was taking him on a date tonight.  They’d talk after that.  It would be fine.  Tony turned his attention back to the schematics for Clint’s programmable arrows and realized he was repeating work he’d already done.
“They’re pigs,” Rogers said.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Yep. Sure. And shoot Pepper an email with a big picture of the salad. Tell her I’m a good boy, eating my greens.”
A long pause.
“Good luck with your work today,” Steve said.
(Ms. Potts slapped me too. Did you know that?)
Tony let out a squawk of indignation and a torrent of invectives. Bruce joined in and they were off and running.
Tony woke slowly.
Tony couldn’t help the little smile that formed as he watched. (God, they looked happy. And, oh, hey—Pep was right, their timing wasn’t off.)
“It’s part of the workshop aesthetic.” Tony shrugged. “Don’t mess with my mojo, Potts.”
Rogers gave him a look half hurt and half frustration. “Not everything is about orientation for me any more than it is for you.” He frowned. “It’s not because I’m a Dom and you’re a sub, it’s because I’m a person and you’re my friend.” Rogers paused then added softly, “And I don’t have that many friends here.”
we announce that you’re an Avenger.  Press conference, talk shows, the whole nine yards. Deal?”
Instead, Tony went limp, playing possum. Rogers stayed right where he was, panting slightly, eyes bright. Tony summoned his strength and made a final bid for freedom. Tony pressed his shoulders hard into the mat and struggled for leverage, but Rogers was prepared for the attack and too fucking massive for it to have mattered anyway.
He needed a cold shower.  (Or maybe a nice long one.)
“Oh, hello, Mr. Stark,” Rogers said a little distractedly.  (Yep, he never dropped the
“Wake up! Daddy’s home!” Tony called into the silent workshop. The lights flashed on. Dummy whirred to life on his charging station and made an eager little clicking noise. “Lazy buckets of bolts,” Tony grumbled. “Get over here.”
“Uh,” Steve looked away.  “Sorry.  Never mind.  Dinner’ll probably be ready in a hour if you want.  Uh--”
Tony’s response was immediate.  (He clearly wasn’t focusing on his conference call.  Poor Mr. Lawyer, et al.  Tony had better not be making trouble for Pepper—she’d have his hide.)
“On three,” Cap agreed.
“But since I have too much property already and I’m not gonna knock you up . . . ” Tony added with a grin.  He shrugged, “I think you should define it however you like.  What we already did could count.  Or you could hang on to the v-word until you’ve tried everything that interests you on the spreadsheet I made for you.”
“Are--” Pepper hesitated. “Are you okay?”
After a productive talk with Pepper about the StarkTab upgrade specs—mercifully undamaged by their time with lesser engineers—and brainstormed marketing—which Tony was good at, but found boring— they’d rung off with a promise to talk about something other than business soon.  Pepper ran to her next meeting and Tony returned to the common room.
“Are you gonna laugh if I choose
“You were right, you know,” Steve said softly.
Tony immediately backtracked. “Er, no, we don’t have to. We can do something else.”
“Harry!” Tony said, drawing the Dom’s attention and feeling lucky at the timing.
“It went well,” Rogers said a little stiffly.
“Ok,” Steve said. He turned to Tony and said, with a hint of uncertain up-speak, “I’ll see you later?”
(Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!)
“Of course you did,” Tony teased as Steve gave him a little twirl.  “Wouldn’t do to
Steve looked up at him, eyes wide and expression shocked.
Tony trailed his hand across Steve’s chest as he continued, the scene vivid in his mind.
Tony smiled, chasing Steve’s lips for another kiss, but the Dom drew back.
“Mmmm,” Tony murmured stroking Steve’s cheek.  “Love kissing you so damn much, but I can’t get distracted.  I brought you something.”
Apparently Rogers didn’t know what to say, so the line was silent for several long moments.
“JARVIS?  Have Darla send him on up to the Captain suite.  Use the private elevator.  I’ll meet him there.”
“Is that good?” Steve asked softly.
(Fuck. You moron, Tony. You should have had
Tony sighed and unpeeled himself.
Rhodey raised a palm in a gesture of surrender.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
(Fuck. Get a grip, Stark.)
Clearly, Rogers had been doing more reading. Or maybe he’d taken one of SHIELD’s training modules? Or maybe Katie or Michael had said something? (Yeah, seemed possible—maybe while prepping Rogers for the press?) Or Bruce. Or-- (Whatever. Doesn’t matter.)
“Guhhhh,” Tony mumbled into the blankets.
“Oh! Right. Just, JARVIS mentioned you hadn’t eaten in a while, and I was making some sandwiches anyway, so . . .” Steve held out a plate of artfully arranged little sandwiches—tea sandwiches, he’d call them—with bits of tomato and bacon sticking out.
As they cuddled warmly under the blankets that Steve had immediately wrapped around them, Tony contemplated how best to broach the subject.
Tony gave Rhodes a curious look.
having a career and wouldn’t see it as a burden. Somebody fierce and independent, who’da been glad I wasn’t the kind of Dom who’d insist he quit if we got married.” Steve’s voice was soft, almost reverent, “Somebody who’d
“With pleasure, sir.”
(Oh God, so embarrassing . . . )
Steve nodded.
(Jake!  Yeah, that was it.  A kindergarten teacher and a black belt.)
Tony’s stomach dropped.
Tony fled.
Tony’s hand reached up as if to touch Steve’s cheek, before settling on his shoulder. “Don’t hide.” Tony swallowed then added softly, “Not from me.”
“Oh my God.”  Francesca raised a hand to cover her mouth, eyes wide.  “Did you really—“
“So, what’s the plan, Cap?” Clint asked, tipping forward with a thud.
RL is kicking my butt.... So, uh, you get a chapter a little earlier than expected.
Tony took the offered paper and laughed. Steve had drawn a pair of cartoons: Dummy with a goatee and Dummy as Iron Man.
“It’s not . . .
“Shhh,” Tony said.  “None of that.  Come on—lift up off the mattress, here.”  Tony pulled Steve’s hips up and soon Steve was rearranged as Tony wanted: his ass in the air, his legs spread, and his cock and balls hanging heavily, while his torso was still down, pressed against the bed. Tony sat up beside him, one hand stroking and soothing Steve’s arched back, the other between his legs, teasing his cock then skating lightly across his hole.
Steve agreed readily, but it was clear he didn’t understand.
exactly, but it matters and if he really thinks--)
when—“ He snapped his mouth shut, nearly vibrating with outrage. “Tend your own goddamn house, Fury.”
“I—I guess I could start at the beginning? If you’re sure you wanna hear it.”
“Tony?” Steve said. “Would you like more coffee?”
“No, no!” Tony protested, then backtracked, “Uh, well, actually—“
For a hideous, disorienting second, Tony thought he’d blacked out, but he could still hear Steve and Bruce and soon his eyes were readjusting. As he recovered from the unpleasant flash-blindness, he found the glowing force field gone.
' energy after their first 'I love you's' had faded without any additional make-up sex. (Tony was
“Thanks,” Steve said eventually, looking over at him. “For coming to get me. Sometimes, I just . . . I get so mad, you know?”
“So gorgeous, Steve,” Tony murmured, still teasing between Steve’s legs.  “Spread out and restrained for me like this.  You’re so good . . .”
“ . . . Katrina! What a surprise seeing you here! I thought you’d be in San Tropez . . .”
Tony’s heart twisted a little. It was so easy to forget—Steve: sick, struggling,
He nodded absently as he diced some more tomatoes for the aloo-gobi and Clint cut the cauliflower.
“JARVIS,” Tony barked, “Start running all my hypos, stat. Cross the blanks with the new output as it comes in”
Tony gestured to Steve’s sketchbook; he’d flipped it over at Tony’s approach.
“Steve,
“So, uh.  More research, huh?” Steve said with the beginnings of a blush.  Tony stared. (Oh fuck, I love that.  I want to fuck you over and over and cover you in my come then see if you’ll still blush so easily.)
“Oh?” Steve asked, a smile tugging at his lips. Tony nodded. “You inviting me to bunk with you, sweetheart?”
“We’re done here,” Tony interrupted. He turned and started walking away, then added over his shoulder: “Worst.  Apology.  Ever!”
“Lift incoming,” Tony said, swooping low. Cap jumped again and Tony caught the shield, then sped after the swiftly escaping spiders. The HUD picked up nearby electronic signals—cameras, cell phones—but he couldn’t lose his focus. Bystanders were distractions; the best way to keep them safe was to go after the spiders.
Tony shivered and went below.
Tony went still.  Steve could hear him swallow.  “Uh, sure.  Ask away.”
Tony was definitely getting donuts.
“Oh, uh, good.”  Bruce took another sip of tea.  “No problem.”
Fury reached out to toy with the glass pyramid paperweight on his desk, breaking eye-contact.
“Gonna hit the showers,” Clint said, sniffing his shirt with a grimace. “Later, Tony!”
Steve obeyed.  Tony moaned and pulled at his hair a little harder.  It was rushed and frantic, urgent and heady.  Steve let himself be swept up in it.  (Tony’s in control. . . I’m yours . . . take me . . .)
Some old business bore was droning on at Pepper, only occasionally sparing Tony his attention to say, heavy-handed with innuendo, ‘How very glad everyone was that Tony’d turned his life around . . . and so dramatically!’ Tony let his gaze wander around the great hall; Bruce was at the bar, deep in conversation with Harry Silverstein who nodding effusively at every word; Clint was over by the balcony laughing raucously with a stocky looking switch in a suit; Natasha was nowhere to be seen.
Tony’s heart started pounding.
Steve started on the buttons and, really, it was silly wasn’t it?  (Tony has seen me naked.  A lot.  He loves my body.
As they all went down to the cafeteria—preemptively complaining about the food—Tony tried not to think about what Fury might be saying to Steve.
Dom laughed and call out to Rogers: “Seriously? Maybe you
Steve rubbed the back of his neck.
Friend: But you’ve been married for 12 years and your husband always does something extravagant for--

“Makes me wanna go down there in War Machine and give him a piece of my mind,” Rhodey said, throwing back the scotch. A dopey grin spread across his face: “Except Miranda’d rip my balls off if I tried it.” He sounded incredibly pleased. “You’re gonna like her, Tones. You too, Pepper.”
“Yeah, J?” Tony called.
“Yes,” Tony said with a smile, giving Steve a playful little poke in the ribs.  “It is. Have you been reading Youtube comments again? What happened to not letting anything ruin our night, hm?”
Stephen Colbert smiles at the camera and says: “Welcome back! And now please welcome our special guest: the one, the only, the original Captain America! Steve Rogers, ladies and gentlemen!”
“No big deal, really,” Tony said waving him off.
(Yeah. After coffee he’d . . . Yeah.)
“Look, JARVIS, said you weren’t answering him anymore, so I came down. Are you still coming up for sushi and
The Captain takes a sip of his water.
“Oh.  Oh!  Right, sure.  Fine.  Whatever,” Tony stumbled awkwardly.  “If you need anything . . .”
“To the Avengers,” Tony finally said.
Steve swallowed.
(Yes, yes, yes!)
Tony blinked and looked up at Rogers, who wasn’t quite meeting Tony’s eyes.
On the side of the bed there was a tray with fresh fruit, a bagel, and some of that extra thick bacon he loved. And a red rose in a single stem vase.
Bruce took his bishop with a pawn and raised one eyebrow.

“Only if you tell me what’s going on,” she said. “And call the next time you’re coming, damn it!”

“Your calendar is clear until tomorrow afternoon.”

Rogers nodded and smiled, pulling food from the fridge. They shared the kitchen in comfortable silence while Cap prepared Sandwiches of Reconciliation.
They hadn’t done anything new in bed, but Tony had curled up with him almost every night, even when they didn’t go to bed together.  Waking up with Tony in the mornings left Steve feeling warm and contented—he liked to dwell on the way Tony’s arms felt around him, the way he sighed and murmured and wiggled closer even sound asleep. (And he’s willing to be big spoon!)  It was wonderful.  And, though they hadn’t tried anything new, what they’d done had been . . . (Ha! Not blushing! ) Well, it had been really really good.  (It’s called “frottage” apparently, that thing we’ve been doing.)  And Steve was getting better at blow jobs, or at least he was thought he was.  (Stupid gag reflex. . . ) Steve was pretty sure he’d made some progress already, even though Tony hadn’t actually gotten him any
Tony laughed. “You found this place on yelp?”

reference, you Trekie?”
“Well, yes,” Bruce said, smiling.  “I have some data sets from the new experiment I ran, but I’m doing the breakdown for the spectrometer data and could use a second set of eyes.”
“I don’t hate you.”
That guy was weird.
“Sir? Agent Romanoff noted your return. She asks that I inform you the team will meet for the gala in the common room at 7:40.”
Somehow, Steve looked even more gigantic when he was barefoot and wearing his pajamas.  Sure, it made sense to be built like that as a brave super-soldier or a veritable pin-up boy, but looking tired, casual, in blue flannel it was just . . . odd.  (You look so human, so normal like this…I should be used to it by now, but . . . )
“Mmm?” Tony muttered absently, reaching for one of the meta-transistors and kneeling down to get a better angle.
“What?” Tony cried.  “So now you talk about me with Pepper?”
“Snob,” Clint scolded from the pilot’s seat.
Hi everybody! So sorry for vanishing for so long. RL + writer's block = long absence. You know how it goes. Anyway, I'm hoping to finish this story very, very soon, and then, if there's still interest, I'd like to continue the series in shorter, more manageable stories.
. Seriously, the whole damn meeting could have been a memo. Not to mention Steve had gone in
“Or, I could leave you alone—sorry I—“
Tony bit his lip. He wanted to drop his head, tilt it to the side and look up at Steve through his eyelashes—it required active effort not to do something that felt not only natural, but
Tony fumbled for the doorknob.  “Oh hell yeah!”
“No worries.” The timer went off and Bruce bustled over to the oven. “And, if you want some, curry will be done in another hour.”
Tony snorted. “What, ‘cause I’m too big a slut for Steve?”
Tony smiled.  “You just gonna stand there, babe, or you gonna come in?”
“What do you mean, you don't know how to dance?”
“I surrender,” Tony said dramatically, tossing his head back. “Do with me as you will, O mighty conqueror!”
“Pff,” Tony sniffed, waving a hand.  “Tony, please.”
Ta-da!  As ever, infinite thanks to my generous readers and my patient and loving beta thatwhichyields, who told me in strong terms not to mess with this chapter any more, but to go ahead and post.  So here it is!

Tony saluted and went back down to the workshop.
“I could eat,” Rogers said, tone verging on shamed confession.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“This isn’t a conversation we could have had when I was a soldier . . . before, but a lot has changed since then, so I want you to know that--”  (Shit, shit, shit.)  It was hard to breathe.  “That--”  Bruce was doing some sort of smile-frown thing, and the others looked concerned.
“Jarvis?” Tony said.
“Only an alien invasion could get me to New Jersey,” Tony joked.
“Sure thing, Cap.”  Tony took another long drag of coffee.  “Sounds good.”
“Things seem . . . good?” Bruce asked, a little questioning but very hopeful.  Tony nodded.
“Yeah, of course, Steve Rogers.”  They sat, staring stupidly at each other over the lavishly arranged table.  “Wait, who did you think--?!?”
“You know, though,” Pepper followed up more seriously, “there’s nothing wrong with having an interest in fashion. You’re aware how I feel about my Louboutins.”
“And let’s get images of Cap and Widow’s uniforms on screen ten, ok?  Post battle.  I want to see the damage.”
“I was planning to tweak those seams a little for you,” Tony said, half apology. “And I had a new double plating in the works.”
“I agree!” Tony exclaimed, clapping his hands together.  Steve and Bruce looked at him in surprise.  “It’s time for you to Hulk out, buddy.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Not sure I’d know what to do with a concubine,” the King admitted, rubbing the back of his neck.  “Sounds a little . . . decadent. It might be nice to have a consort, though. If I could find the right fella.”
and had been working on the incomplete Bob readings ever since.  Without any help from Bruce, he might add.
“Completely.”  Steve said it with the tone of a vow.   He caressed Tony’s cheek gently and leaned in--
Steve ran the tap, checking the temperature, and grabbed the cup on the sidebar.
Tony felt rather smug.
“Oh, fuck, you’re gorgeous like this,” Tony growled.  He pulled out and pushed in very slowly. Steve panted and rocked back wanting more, harder.  Steve could hear Tony breathing heavily.
“Yeah,” Rhodey agreed, “Otherwise it’s a horrible downer.”
(No!)
For somebody with such long legs, she sure walked slowly. Tony paid careful attention to their route so he wouldn’t have to ask directions again—he hated that shit. No seriously: even MIT labeled doors and hallways.
“No,” Jackie said primly. He brushed imaginary lint off his immaculate billowing silk
“Doesn’t seem like just talking should be so hard, but—“ he shrugged, not meeting Tony’s eyes.

“S'okay,” Tony murmured.  “You're busy.”
It really shouldn’t hurt.

“Anyway,” Tony said, trying to recapture his usual tone. “One bad experience with some SHIELD guy shouldn’t poison you against an entire profession.” Tony appealed to Steve’s sense of justice, adding, “That hardly seems fair, you know?”
“I’m sorry, Bruce,” Steve said with an apologetic smile. “We’re scheduled for training at Tony’s ranch in January though. We’ll get you more involved then.”
“Of course, Mr. Rogers,” he said, still a little melancholy.  “I hope the position proves satisfactory.  I wish you the best of luck.”
Bruce chuckled.  “Yeah. I know what you mean.  Tea?”
It took a few moments for Bruce to return his gaze to Tony, shaking his head a little.
“Yep! Unless Bruce changed his mind, which seems unlikely. I wasn’t expecting him to be so excited about it, but he seemed pretty pleased.”
“I like Sam. Maybe I could tag along?”
Tony felt the wind knocked out of him with every thrust; he was nearly dizzy with it-- panting, sweaty, out of breath, heat coiled tight between his thighs.
“So, let’s get drinks before I go.  Or dinner?”
No. No, if they actually started
“All right then,” Tony said, not backing down.  “What have you heard about me?”
Steve ran gentle hands up and down Tony’s back, carded his fingers through Tony’s hair.
and—”
“Mmmm?”
So, he'd hopped on his bike and headed to St. Michael's where he found Meredith tending the garden. The parishioners volunteered in turns to keep things in order and Steve was relieved to find something he could help with. He'd dug and planted and weeded with Meredith, did kitchen prep with Tom for dinner at the shelter, and helped Jon unload the latest donations. (And if the eighty-year-old noticed that Steve carried far more at once than even a fit twenty-five year old should be able to, he kindly didn't mention it.)
“So,” Tony said, “any clue what this meeting’s about?”
“Look at you!” he exclaimed. “If I'd known it was that bad I would have agreed to take you today as a charity case. Seriously honey if those eyebrows got any bushier, we’d be gathering berries!”
“I like to think so,” the Captain says smiling.
(Oh fuck!)
Tony hadn’t meant to say anything but suddenly the words were pouring out of his mouth. Tony turned and Steve answered with a solemn nod.
Sorry for the delay!  Thanks so much for all your constant kindness, especially thatwhichyields and Nonymos.
“I confess, I’ve been a fan of yours for years, Tony.”
Steve cocked his head and waited patiently for Tony to gather his thoughts.
