Sarah swims by then, a little faster than her parents, and George drifts in after them.
Already carrying a tray of fresh bread baskets, she winds her way toward them, rolling her eyes as she does.
Steve continues gazing down at Tony with half-lidded eyes.
This is day one of the review. According to the procedures Steve had reviewed during the car ride over, it could take
Embroidered in white and navy, the logo for the “Chicago Flyers” is a little studebaker with wings on its side. The patch is attached with a few different colors of thread stitched around its edges, like it’s been sewn on more than once.
Tony leans back, mouth open in shock. “The shield was real?! Oh, god, I can't believe I didn't ask you about it before. Was it made of adamantium? I've heard about these new adamantium wand cores—"
, he thinks happily, having grown rather attached to the nomaj material.
Nothing to do but wait.
“Since this thing is technically RI property,” Rhodes whispers from behind Steve, both of them crouching beneath the draped film of the invisibility cloak, “I’m telling Tony he has to make the next one bigger.”
Tony nuzzles Steve back, then pulls away, just a few inches; his gaze dips, and his voice is quiet when he speaks again.
had carved this?
“I do,” Steve says sincerely. “I do, now.”
Steve's face goes slack and his hands fall to his side.
It’s vague, sure, but it seems to vindicate Steve suspicions: the killer is using obscurials, or something very like them—how else would you turn a wizard into a weapon?
Steve balls his hands into fists so tightly his knuckles crack; Doom is going to
It was uncomfortable to consider, but Tony had a point—had a lot of points. He’d never thought of MACUSA’s secrecy as being hurtful to people—nomajs, squibs, other magical peoples—but when you got down to it, if you had the power to help and turned away, wasn’t that almost as bad as inflicting the hurt yourself?
Etched in the bottom of the mirror is a logo Steve had never paid much attention to, but focusing on it on it now, he can see what's printed there plainly.
at Doom with his off-hand. He doesn’t even bother to use his wand, raw emotion erupting from him as a powerful attack.
They reach the intersection of Broadway and 44th, and Steve feels a tug on his sleeve; Tony stops walking, and, using Steve's own momentum, yanks Steve back to him, twirling Steve to face him.
Steve knocks on Sam’s door. For the third time.
ID. Right. That rectangle of nomaj plastic with the stationary photo of himself printed on it to prove who he is. (As if that could stop someone who was transfigured to look like you.)
. You never really struck me as a Roger," he muses.
Doom roars, and stalks away from the orb, crossing the room halfway, back towards Tony.
"The armor?” Tony asks brightly. “It's a work in progress."
,” Tony chides, voice muted as he reaches inside the closet, digging around. “Not like
"Yeah, okay," he sighs again, sounding more human. "Guess it has to be like this."
rare.”
He can’t think about… what he’s thinking about. Not right now, when he’s about to meet his new teammates.
But—that can't be right, can it?
“Who?” Steve asks, trying to stifle a grin as he takes another sip of rose hip tea.
needs their protection.
Then the smiles fades.
Maybe it's better than Tony being embarrassed and storming out in a huff. Steve still wants to crawl under the table, apparate away, and never show his face in public again.
—” Steve begs.
Tony wants to—?
to live.
, are you?”
Tony looks baffled. "Rhodes Industries...?"
Tony.
DUM-E and Tug wheel over next to Tony. The sight of all three of them, at their staggered heights, hanging in the doorway, breaks the tension at least; Steve wants to laugh.
“We moved back to the States, I changed my name, hoping maybe the press would lose interest—they did, eventually. Mom used some of her connections to get me into the best technology focused schools. I graduated early from M.I.T.—that’s sort of… Hogwarts for nerds, I guess. Then my folks died, and things got … bad for a while. That’s a story for another day, but… Not long after that, I found Cap. The comic books, I mean. It was just what I needed at the time. And it wasn’t
“I think they’re experimenting,” Tony offers, flipping through projections of images from each site. “The readings change over time, so that means they aren’t able to replicate the effects consistently. The procedure—whatever it is they’re trying to do—isn’t successful yet. Or at least, not as successful as they would like.”
Tony's stomach won't stop doing flip flops and something is balling up in his throat, that horrible tightness that usually only releases with tears. He gets some space between himself and Steve, starts to turn to face him.
Tony sneers. "I'm a glitch. A skipped-gen."
To his left are glass doors leading to the bar, the only feature on this level, according to the map. It’s currently empty, and several signs seem to indicate that it’s closed for renovations.
"—go," Tony finishes, sheepishly. "Okay. Thank you again for the best time. I'll remember it as long as I live."
“Hey, Rogers. I know you’ve been around longer than me, technically… But you’re not one, you know.”
"Dr. Prentiss!" Steve jovially greets the woman now standing next to them.
He looks back at Steve, still conversing with Nita—just how much is there to say about humping humpbacks, exactly?—and he supposes Steve was probably a very mature child, too, though for very different reasons. Steve's explained how he grew up sickly, how he lost his parents at young age. Having to fend for himself in Manhattan in the 1930s must have been... Tony's not even sure he has the vocabulary to understand it fully, let alone describe it.
(If by 'funny', you mean 'absolutely mortifying.')
"What's the little one's name?" Tony gestures at the massiveness of the ocean before them. "Little, relatively speaking."
my partner—get hurt. I’m not leaving them alone, you understand?”
Tony sighs. “I... I saw a little girl there tonight with her parent, and I just… I don’t know.” He shrugs, his shoulder bumping Steve’s knee. “I don’t know.”
(Distantly, Steve considers that he may need some new friends who have fewer dangerous pets in their homes.)
to complete the interview process.
“Everything all right?” Steve asks.
“The feeling is mutual, sir.”
Steve looks pleadingly at the waitress, who shrugs, as if to say, “I don’t know what he’s doing either,” and walks away to serve her other tables.
Doom brings his wand around, and Steve looks him squarely in the eyes, seeing the pure hatred glowing in them.
“Why didn’t you say how serious it was before?” he asks. “Where should I meet you?”
It was a betrayal of our
to be a catch.
, Steve focuses on the thought.
"Hydras have multiple heads, not multiple arms," Steve frowns again.
The author's name moves into view, and it catches Steve's eye:
Doom?
“Mmm,” is Steve’s only reply, and when Tony glances up, he’s staring out the window.
Slowly, enjoying every ragged inhale and exhale, every thump of their syncopated racing hearts, they quiet themselves, laughter fading into contented smiles.
"You've known me for all of three weeks. And I acted fishy—I admit, the flying breadsticks were probably a bit much. But I wanted to impress you," he admits. “Plus, hey—” he holds up the garment he was wearing before when he was flying. “Invisibility cloak. Not a normal nomaj thing.” He tucks it into a drawer carefully.
Tony laughs.
suck.”
Tony holds the briefcase handle with hands, rocking back on his heels once, clearly as reluctant to leave as Steve. "Goodnight," he says finally, turning and heading toward the nearest street corner and hailing a cab.
“What?”
"Stop," he commands. "Tony Cerrera, you are under arrest, on suspicion of first degree disintegration, destruction of public property, and possession of unregistered magical devices. You have the right to refuse to Legilimency, and to decline to provide your memories for inspection in a pensieve until such time as evidence is found that—"
“That’s okay. I understand that,” he says, as if Tony’s rambling monologue had been at all coherent. “And for the record, I don’t know about having kids either, right now.” His gaze drifts down, and he’s starting to look as lost as Tony just was. “I… I don’t think… biologically…” His mouth forms a line. “I have some concerns. And even adopting, or engaging a surrogate, I—” Steve forces a half smile. “I don’t know either, is the long and the short of it.”
Steve takes in the sight of Tony, illuminated by the golden glow of his creation. He’s somewhat more solemn than before, his secrets laid bare, but he’s still radiating that infectious, profound hopefulness that Steve has come to love about him.
. He never knew science could be so interesting, so… personal.
"No," Steve protests, but words fail him mid sentence. He shuts his mouth, and draws himself up to his full height, neck and shoulder muscles tensing in anger.
he knows where Tony is headed, but he can’t be sure; he needs to follow.
“Here you go,” Tony says softly, seriously, handing Kyle back his cherished toy, “Don’t

—and Doom hits him with
“STEVE!” Tony yells. He’s helping Sam limp away, while Rhodes carries Reed over his shoulder. He throws an arm out, reaching for Steve. Anguish is reflected in his eyes. “I’m
The name sounds strange to him. He hadn’t been particularly famous during the war—Project Solstice had been successful, yes, and he had been part of an elite fighting squadron, sure. But all the details has been classified. Besides, he was just doing his duty. And
Treading as cautiously as possible, Steve makes his way to the center of what was once a room. There are runes scratched in the concrete, just like the most recent report said.
Steve feels his heart swell up with conflicting emotions—joy, at the idea of a young Tony having this pivotal moment of discovery, and a deep sadness, for what Tony was surely about to tell him next.
“Get ready,” he warns Rhodey and U.
” Richards spins to face Steve, annoyed at his progress being impeded—and then he goes absolutely still, suddenly seeming… bewildered. “You’re…” his eyes dip to take in Steve’s lanyard. “Roger Stevens,” he intones slowly.
people?
“Catch,” Tony says, and tosses the broom to Steve.
The creature ruffles then refolds its wing. Its body is snakelike, and its face is that of a bird's. Both its scales and feathers have an absolutely beautiful iridescent gleam to them.
Tony closes the door as he holds up his jet boots and gloves. They look like they’ve been polished, but more importantly, they have a new paint job: red and gold, just like in Tony’s schematic.
“Agent Ayala will be following up with you individually with leads.
But Redwing just cocks his head to the side quizzically.
Tony waggles his eyebrows, then slips his own hand under Steve's and retrieves the object, holding it up between their bodies.
to do with the fact that the deli is around the corner from the latest explosion site, on the case he is absolutely not supposed to be working on. That... is mere coincidence.
“This is…” he trails off, at a loss for words.
“No!” Tony hastily denies. Then glances upwards, considering. “I mean, I don’t
Guess those are the upgrades Tony mentioned.
“Sorry to hear that. Well. Anyway. You, uh, need something?” Tony asks coyly. “Or just dropping by to say hi?”
Tony’s hand is warm—not too warm, as usual; just perfect—and his pulse is lively under Steve’s fingertips.
“Stevens—Rogers,
As they wind their way closer to Yankee Stadium, the landscape changes some—it's a more populated area, even at this late hour, and Steve doubles his concentration to keep the cloaked figure in his sights as they dart between nomajs.
"God, you are so
And it might be made of metal the same as Doom's armor, but that's about all the two have in common. Seeing the it now, Steve can't imagine how he had ever confused the two.

Steve vision is practically crimson at this point. "Stop it. This is

Steve lets his hands fall onto the table. Bobbi catches one and holds it gently.
Tony tells Steve the whole story—how he tricked the staff at Ollivander’s in Hogsmeade, how he bought everything in sight at Honeydukes because he knew he might never get to return, how he even snuck a sip of butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks.
“Because you’re scary powerful! You can wipe their
"My dad didn't yell,” Tony recalls, calming. “At the time, I kind of wish he had. He didn't speak to me for about a week. I think it was less the squib thing than it was how much I embarrassed the family by showing off. I was really worried about what my mom would say, though."
the science thing. It was...”
A panel on the side wall of her stand slides back, revealing a hidden space full of merchandise not for nomaj eyes; the images on the front page of the paper move with a soothing familiarity.
He hadn't seen Italy under the best of conditions during the war. It was December, 1943, and they'd been tasked with taking back San Pietro Infine. The fighting went on for ten days in the cold; everyone was wading in muck up to their calves; the rolling hills were still flooded from the heavy November rains, and not even all the magic in the 5th army was enough to keep their boots dry.
Tony finishes strolling around the lab, finally stopping in front of Steve, encircling Steve’s waist with his arms.
, Steve! That’s a terrifying power to have!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Then the gloves and boots give off that whirring noise again, and Tony bursts upward again, at an astonishing speed. Doing a graceful loop in the air, he sets off south and west, toward Central Park.
Then Tony makes a gesture, and an image appears, projecting upward from the workbench surface in a flash, floating in midair. For what feels like the hundredth time in twelve hours, Steve has to remind himself that Tony isn't a wizard.

Everything about him is…

Now the guests of honor are less than a mile out, and it's almost surreal, the idea that this thing that had grown in importance along with their relationship is actually happening.
"So, you know how I said my dad had a business?"
He turns right abruptly and heads for the bank of elevators, stopping briefly to take in a map of the hotel’s layout near the call buttons.
He finally looks back at Steve, holding his breath as he does; even after all this time together, there’s still some part of him that feels like he could ruin everything with Steve in the space of a moment. Like there’s a piece of him made of glass, liable to shatter at the slightest impact.
Bobbi sits up, defensive. “I might be a Legilaffex, but I don’t need to read your emotions for this. It’s on your face, for Merlin’s sake.” She leans forward, imploring. “Come on, Steve. I think you’ll feel better if you tell me, and it’s not like there’s anyone else around to hear.”
Tony hits the ground, his body going limp as the spell rolls over him covering him in a spider web of green light before it dissolves.

The report indicated that MACUSA was working under the assumption that the wizard responsible for the explosions had written the rune—but this was not the precision work of someone preparing a ritual.
Tony beams at Steve, absolutely radiating delight.
Reasonably certain that no one is looking, he pulls out his wand.
Tony turns to the computer terminal one more time, and enters a passcode of some kind, and then motions again. The armor and the deciphering script disappear, revealing…

Tony turns to Steve a second time, and he's looking back now. Smiles of relief (and, okay, plain adoration) are mirrored on one another's faces.
“Well,
He’s tall, with close-cropped hair, sharp brown eyes and a warm smile. His suit coat is unbuttoned, a hint of a seemingly laid back personality making itself known. Leaning against the front of his desk, he looks absolutely at home in his magnificent, airy office, its floor to ceiling windows continuing the transparency motif Steve noticed in the lobby, giving them all a beautiful view thousands of feet above the teeming metropolis below.
And he has Tony, too, for that matter, right here in arms. He’s still the amazing, delightful man Steve had a crush on hours ago.
Tony's breath is coming quicker than the thrusts now, almost double time. He moans.
“Thank you,” he says, waving the sheets in her direction before folding them up and inserting them into his jacket pocket.
“So you’re not a…” Steve pauses. He has really started to hate

Steve wraps his arms around Tony. Their height difference is just enough that Steve's lips align perfectly with the place Tony's earlobe meets his jaw.

"I'm so glad we're here," he whispers.
Tony laughs. "I know, right? Same name. Super weird."

there.”
Doom frowns. “I did not want to do that,” he growls. “But if he would give his life for you, he was more of a fool than I thought.”
He knows Tony was right.
Steve's eyes dart momentarily to the occamy, who is back to her normal size and once more snoring softly on Tony's sweatshirt, her odd name suddenly making a lot more sense.
It’s… Reed Richards? The biologist is in league with Doom? He
He is, frankly, exceedingly lucky he didn’t get splinched on his way here. He wasn’t even sure where he was headed when he left Tony’s lab. He just knew he needed to get away—
"No," Steve demands.
They're both kneeling facing the end of the bed, nestled together, Steve's front to Tony's back, as if spooning. Steve holds Tony upright, one hand curled possessively around Tony's hip, the other across Tony's chest. Tony's back arches in pleasure, his head lolling back onto Steve's shoulder now and then.
Steve nods.
Tony guffaws. "Uh, never mind. The point is, there were paparazzi around pretty much constantly while I was growing up. They wanted to see how magical Howard Stark's offspring really was, if the pumpkin had rolled far from the patch."
. I'm a
"My dad wasn't exactly... a kind man, but he didn't tolerate anyone speaking to my mother that way, so he did what he thought he had to do: he quit MACUSA, left the day-to-day operations of Stark Enchantments to his brother, Edward Stark—with a clause that I had the right to inherit the business when I got older, of course—and moved us all to Europe right after I was born. He thought it would quiet the chatter about our family." Tony laughs. "I think it only made people more curious. One of the foremost magifacturers of the day just quits? How often does that happen? And to say people were curious about
"I want to talk about what you said," he tells Tony, his tone as gentle and earnest as Tony's ever heard it. "Please. Let's discuss it. Tonight?"
Much as Steve had reached for his own tool of choice, Tony retrieves his phone and captures a photo of the runes, which shows up immediately on screen. Steve describes the jist of the code he and the other soldiers used during the war. Thirty seconds later, Tony has a script running, attempting to auto-decipher the message.
The latest explosion site revealed a detail that none of the others did: runes carved into the floor near the epicenter of the blast.The report notes seem to indicate that they were placed there by the bomber as part of a ritual.
Did Tony believe he and Steve were so enamored of one another that he could win Steve over to his side? Tony was going to be sorely disappointed if that was the case. Nothing justified hurting other wizards outside of a combat situation—nothing.
The acrid smell of Fluxweed and Knotgrass reaches Steve’s sensitive nose just after it hits Tony’s, and Steve realizes what he’s seeing.
“It’s not just that—”
Steve thinks ruefully.
It is, of course, the sound that saved their planet: whale song.
He grins impishly, and leans in again, brushing his lips against Steve’s, pleading seductively.
“I wasn’t even the one to tell him,” he clarifies. “His on-again-off-again girlfriend, who’s a witch, did. But thanks for jumping to that conclusion.”
"I'll get you back, man," he promises around a mouthful of bagel, and Steve smiles. At least Sam has learned he shouldn't put up a fight regarding this topic; no one goes hungry on Steve's watch.
Tony respects and trusts Reed’s intellect more than nearly anyone else’s, so if Tony thinks Reeds idea has merit, it’s probably a sound one.
A week ago, Doom had tried to kill Tony, and nearly scared the life out of Steve in the process. Tony has seemed completely fine since then, perhaps the first person to walk away from a killing curse since Potter (Steve has been doing some reading in the interim, and yes, he does know who that is now, thank you very much), except no one can seem to explain why it happened.
The next few moments feel a little like coming back into the airlock after a space walk, like gravity's just returned.
“Yes,” Tony says, deliberately calmly this time. “I mean, I
“We’ll see what we come up with, he says, satisfied, stepping away from the keyboard to let the program run.
I’m available, I can probably make that work. Do you have a place in mind?”
“I don't know,” Tony says again, blowing out a long breath. It’s the truth, but Tony really hates things he doesn’t know, especially big important life things, things it seems like other people know so intrinsically.
The figure bolts.
Doom’s jaw drops open, his arm frozen mid-spell, dumbstruck for a moment. Then the angry resolve returns to his face and he tries again.
"I swear, Tony, I had no idea." He buries his face in his hands for long seconds, then parts them enough for his mouth to peep through. "I am so sorry."
Timidly, but bearing a promise of things to come, pink blossoms are beginning to reappear on the tree next to McDonagh’s newsstand at the corner of Broadway and Chambers.
Steve chuckles in his ear: the haughty sound of a man with a plan. "Since you're being so good."
“This ends with me wearing the Captain America outfit doesn’t it? With the… what did you call them? Booty shorts?”
He swipes back to to the Captain. The character has a shield, he notices now—it appears to be an actual object, though, unlike Steve's spellshield. It's completely opaque, and also painted in red, white, and blue—it’s a little much, Steve thinks, and would have made quite the target in combat—but that's definitely meant to be his shield.
Tony taps the plastic circle against the back of the phone, and it chirps and lights up, the screen proclaiming that a new contact, Tony Cererra, has been added.
Tony looks. God, Steve is beautiful. He loves Steve so much.
The neck—or is it an arm?—bends down out of sight for a moment, and then pops back up holding a coffee mug in its claw. As it wheels around the desk toward them, what Steve had previously thought was a shelving unit comes to life as well, rolling out from under the desk. A shelf with a tea kettle on it slides forward, and the kettle begins to whistle.
"This is..." he whispers.
Except… upon closer inspection, it seems the garage door affixes directly to the brick at the top, where it should curve inward; it doesn’t look like it has a mechanism to open, like it even
"No," Steve shakes his head, voice gone taut, expression entirely serious. "Tony, I fought in the war. World War II, I mean. I... I'm..." he shrugs. "I'm Captain America. I guess."
Steve takes a swig of soda—that last bite of sandwich didn't go down so well.
Steve's pace is quick and unwavering, his thick, lube-soaked cock driving deep into Tony at steady intervals. With every thrust, Tony can feel his own cock bobbing in front of him, can feel his ass jiggling obscenely.
“If only…” Tony looks back up at Doom, and
“Even you?” Rhodes asks.
“Glad you asked,” Tony answers, eyes aglow. He punches a few more commands into the keyboard, pulling up some figures on the holoscreen next to the armor.
Doom is already stalking toward him, the orb held high in one hand, brandishing his wand in the other.
Sam is the last to appear, Rhodey apparating along with him, sidecar style. Sam is still in rough shape, limping over to Steve’s reclining form, and Rhodey looks a little green around the gills from apparating twice in quick succession.
Steve resists the urge to sush him—Steve already cast a dome of silence over them, but old habits die hard—and he can’t deny that Rhodey has a point.
Heading down the street, brown paper deli bag in hand, Steve prepares to disapparate, about to head home, when he catches a flicker of light out of the corner of his eye.
Steve manages to push himself away from the ground, and raise his wand arm just a few inches, barely enough to point it in Doom’s general direction. He can hardly see straight, but the orb glows brighter still, drawing his eye.
,” she purses he lips and tilts her chin, giving him a stern look. “Stoner said—”
“Hey, man, it’s kinda crowded in here already—” one gentleman begins to protest, but Steve’s wand is at the ready before he can finish his sentence.
Tony's armor is elegant, clearly designed for him and him only, the contours of Tony’s body reflected in the armor’s distinctly lean shape. The helmet, gloves and boots Tony wore earlier are all present, but they suddenly make so much more sense in the context of the full design. It was like having only read the words to a song on paper, and then suddenly hearing it sung aloud for the first time: the boots and gloves were poetry before, but the armor was symphonic.
Life goes on, noisy and fast-paced and irritating and wonderful.
Tony nods. "Yeah."
The rush of excitement Steve feels reading Tony’s words—particularly the familiar greeting—is tempered by the nausea he feels at discovering the solution to the cipher.
“I was actually just going to ask if you would let me have a second chance at picking a better restaurant,” Steve explains, quickly adding, “But I
Steve takes a deep breath and focuses on Tony’s right hand sliding reciprocally around his back, Tony’s breath rising and falling, and the delicious warmth curling in him where their bodies meet. He looks down at Tony, and Tony looks lazily back up at him, those deep blue eyes sparkling in the lights of the shining billboards all around them.
He can be the hero Tony wants him to be.
He races after his boyfriend, soaring into the twilight.
,” Steve chides him softly, “You’re a flying knight in armor who wants to save the world. What does that sound like to you?”
"Better."
“Who’s going on a date?” a new voice joins the conversation. Footsteps echo in the cafeteria, as a woman with bright green hair, wearing matching sunglasses and a black trenchrobe tied with a sash, crosses to their table.
Tony sits back down, still grinning. "Earlier tonight, you thought I was a wizard pretending to be a muggle for nefarious reasons, using magic disguised as tech. And I thought that was breathtakingly hilarious, because for the first eleven years of my life, I did exactly the opposite. I made science look like magic. Same as with the flying bread tonight." He shrugs. "I think I always knew what I was. I knew I was never..."
He strolls away from their table, pulling Steve along by the hand, and he realizes Tony is dragging him over to the table with the angry man and his son.
Stoner’s head shoots up at that, alarm writ large on his face.
Tony bares his teeth at Doom and yanks his arms forward, banging his cuffs against the pipe in a show of disgust.
—from hurting anyone else.
. Later. Right now, you just need to get through a couple of meals. So, ask him out today, the two of you go get a bite, hit it off, and then when you finish this assignment, you can go on the magical date of your dreams.”
"Who do you work for?" he asks, scowling.
Before Steve can protest that that's impossible, Tony cuts him off.
He feels like he’s been chewed up by a dragon and spit back out, but Steve can feel some of his healing power kicking in. Steve has always handled magical wounds better than other wizards since Project Solstice. He’s out of combat and relatively safe now; he’ll recover… so long as he doesn’t have to move much for a few days.
,” he casts with what little is left of his ragged voice.
“I implied we were leaving the
That, of all things, seems to make Tony blush. He blinks, changing the subject.
Before Doom can curse him again, he follows Steve’s line of sight, and has the same realization.
Steve pauses, thoughtful.
And that was that: the start of a tradition.
"C'mon,
” he casts at Reed and Tony. A golden beam strikes their cuffs, and they fall to the floor. He turns, focusing on the far wall where he and Rhodey entered, and casts a
“Text you tomorrow,” Steve promises, going one better. "Maybe even later tonight."
The graceful contours of handle catch the light. It’s made of a polished mahogany, sturdy but with some flex, perfect for riding. Toward its end, the handle is wrapped a whiskey colored leather sleeve, perfect for gripping. The bristles are full, wrapped with care, and taper to a graceful elegant point.
At the far end, Steve can see Sam seated on the floor, barely keeping himself upright, bound with a nasty looking incarcerous spell. It looks similar to the one Bucky had been trapped with before.
Tony is rising, standing up in front of Steve. Color is returning to his skin, the ashy pallor of death fading away.
As soon as Tony stands up, reluctantly taking a step away from Steve to let the professionals work, Rhodey rushes in, wrapping Tony up in a protective hug. He practically lifts Tony off the ground. Steve smiles at them, the haze of the pain beginning to recede.
,” he orders. He hopes to Merlin Sam is well enough to apparate them all out of here. He has to be. They
He doesn’t see anyone on the lab floor or out on the balcony, and hopes he hasn’t gotten the date wrong—now that RI’s W.A.N.D.D. status has been approved, he doesn’t have to come to the office every day.
That, coupled with the flickering streetlight (often a side effect of a spell in use in a nearby area), tells Steve he’s looking at the effects of a warding charm: an imperfect illusion, meant to keep nomajs away.
A waitress, the same one who indulged Tony’s breadstick shenanigans, is already approaching the man, probably to confront him about making a scene, but the man intercepts her before she can even admonish him.
As they reach the edge of the balcony, Steve's spell finally manages to tag the edge of the invisibility cloak, snagging the edge of it like an invisible hand. Steve yanks back with his wand, and the cloak comes with it, releasing from the figure's body.
James Rhodes’ turns just in time to catch Steve attempting to stifle a yawn. The CEO smirks pointedly.
Squibs are unique. They grow up with magic, have a front row seat to see everything they'll never have. Some even continue to try learning magic later in life, convinced they're late bloomers. Those dreams almost never pan out.
"You think I'm not serious about this?" Tony points toward his computer console, matching Steve's volume. "About my team?"
them.”
Tony looks up at him searchingly, like he's trying to decide if he can trust Steve with his secrets. Steve had thought it would be the other way around, when the time came.
“No,” Tony denies, then blushes. “I mean, maybe for my birthday. And our anniversary. And special occasions. As a personal favor.”
Before Steve can even begin to explain the situation, Rhodes breaks in. “Is this some stupid wizard thing?”
Steve stands, tossing the cloak aside, and fires a blast of
"What did she say?"
And just like that, Steve takes a step back, sips the last of his drink, and coolly resumes looking out the aluminum panel as though the exchange never happened.
“I… don’t drink coffee,” Steve explains, confused where this is going.
Tony feels it immediately: Steve's entire body tenses, wire taught. His mouth drops open, brushing Tony's ear again. He doesn't let Tony go, but he doesn't say anything right away either.
magic sometimes.”
“Promise me, Captain,” she points at him before slinging her bag over her shoulder and starting to head out. “Promise me you’ll ask him out.”
“A dark parasite that grows in a young witch or wizard when they are forced to suppress their powers,” Steve explains. “They can become extremely dangerous. Grindelwald—”
Tony quickly bends to grab his briefcase, and makes for the exit at a quick but graceful clip, with Steve hot on his heels. Before they’ve gotten halfway to the door, Steve hears the restaurant burst into a round of applause behind them.
Tony shakes his head again. "Not really. I mean, I read the Conjurer, I keep up with big events—especially stuff like this explosion business. But if you mean, do I hang out with people who remind me of what I can never be?" he sips his coffee. "No, not on the regular."
“May I kiss you?” Tony asks.
—the day is nearly over.
See? Steve’s back. Tony’s safe. Steve’s always going to come back to him.
"Of course. I'm Nita," she introduces herself casually. "I didn't want to interrupt you, it looked like you were deep in conversation."
Tony just stares at Steve, disappointed. Even U seems upset.
“It’s gorgeous, Tony,” Steve says sincerely, running his fingers reverently along the handle. “Thank you.”
curse at Steve, who dodges it ably. Doom turns his attention to Rhodes.
,” Tony titters. “I’m learning to control it.”
Steve stands up along with her. “Bobbi—” He looks more pointedly at the folder in her hand. “You… You wouldn’t, ah—”
Sam threatened that if he heard Steve say the word "processor" or "transistor" one more time, he was going set Redwing on him. (Redwing seemed to screech and flap his refusal of this notion, but nonetheless, Steve dialled back his enthusiasm some, thinking it better to be safe than shredded.)
Tony jumps up to a sitting position on top of the nearest workbench. “Do you want to hear it?” he asks.
emancipare
"Then again," Tony smiles first at the sleepy occamy, and then at Steve, "So am I.
Steve spins around, searching the bar area for something, anything he can use—
“Where are we going?”
"I..." Steve leans forward, elbows on the table, scraping his fingers through his hair. "I grew up in a wizarding family, Bobbi!" he gestures emphatically. "We were druidic Irish. Very observant. Mom's practice got her through some bad times with my Dad. Magic was her life, so it was mine, too. And then I was a battlecaster in the war. I don't... I don't know who I am without magic, and I don't know anything about technology. I'd be too terrified to lie, and I can't tell him the truth yet. I'll probably just... end up saying nothing at all. We'll be five minutes into the meal, and he'll realize what a huge mistake he’s made."
He tries again… And again, nothing.
" Steve spits, frustrated. "I mean,
Tony knows maybe more than most about appreciating colossal things. (He chuckles silently to himself: he's not even making a dirty joke about Steve being, ahem, well-endowed for once.) Glimpsing a starship—
Slowly, gently, U wiggles her way onto Steve’s outstretched arm, while Rhodes pauses, taking in Steve’s words.
When Steve was young, he didn't get to go to wizard school. Not everyone did, then—hardly anyone in his neighborhood could afford it. He dreamed of going to the Chicago School for Sorcery, and he knew a few people who went to that one school in Massachusetts, the one that had since been rededicated as the Center for Native Magical Studies.
“Do I detect a clanking noise?” Tony goads. “Are you shaking in your armor, Brave Sir Robin?”
” He smiles imploringly at her. “I’ll get down on my knees, if I have to.”
"You're insane," Tony tells him. "That's impossible."
Steve marches over to Tony, gripping the fabric of Tony's undershirt.
But Steve’s dreams are dashed; he feels them fading like a cancelled spell.
Then, Steve feels… something else. White noise fills his ears, and there’s a slight buzzing sensation against his lips. His chest suddenly feels heavy where Tony’s hand is resting. His whole body feels heavier, and the air of warmth and brightness he didn’t even know he normally felt inside suddenly becomes heavy. It’s not a bad experience, it’s just… different. He’s not exactly sure how it’s possible he can know this, but it feels true, somehow: he feels like a nomaj.
"You... what?!" A bark of laughter escapes Tony's open mouth before his hands fly, faster than owls, to cover it. "Seriously? You never heard of the Olive Garden, and you thought... that it was—and you picked the one in
The grey blobs below the surface are getting bigger every second; the drone filming them a half a mile out must be zooming in for a better view. That, or they're surfacing. Dark shapes obscured by seawater dominate the screens in the viewing room.
be one… But that didn’t stop him, you know? He found a way. I don’t know if that’s what it was like for you, really, but… he made me not want to quit, made me think I could make a real difference. He made me who I am. That’s why I’m doing this,” Tony cocks his head to the side, indicating the armor.
“Welcome to undercover, Stevie,” Sam smiles smugly, conjuring a pair of sunglasses to appear on his face. “Welcome to W.A.N.D.D.”
“Wow,” he breathes, eyes locked on Steve, as if they are the only ones in the room, as if they’re not being orbited by bread baskets and watched by a hundred sets of eyes.
Before Tony can react, Doom roughly seizes his jaw in his hand, forcing Tony’s gaze back in his direction.
Steve hadn't actually considered that the person he was chasing was the one behind these explosions—involved perhaps, but probably not the mastermind behind these disturbances. Why would the perpetrator return to the scene of their own crime?
"HEY!" Tony steps in front of the creature, waving his arms wildly in the universal gesture for 'stop it'—seemingly meant for both Steve and the creature.
- Re: Wonder Woman, that one’s for you, @shetlandowl and @tonystarkier ;)
He’d better change the topic, though, before he finds himself getting maudlin.
you?” the father hisses at the child. He’s waving something in the air angrily—a nomaj toy of some kind. A horse? No, a unicorn. A purple one, with pink streaks in its hair.
Steve squeezes Tony’s torso against his side; Tony can practically feel his smile. “Which part, specifically?”
could. I’m just not sure if I want to.”
“Nomajs wouldn’t understand,” Steve maintains, voice simmering with anger. “They’ve always tried to hurt us—they’re scared of us—”
It’s odd, the way Richards is saying it, as if Steve is a complete stranger; true, Steve doesn’t know him well, but they
None of that is important now, he tells himself. Tony can break up with him if he wants to—just so long as Tony is safe and alive.
They talk at length about the humpbacks, and what their favorite parts of the evening were. About how incredible it was, and how everyone back aboard the Avenger will be insanely jealous once their shore leave is over (Clint will pretend not to be impressed, they both agree, but he’ll actually be just as envious as the rest.)
That’s polyjuice potion.
“Yeah,” Tony agrees, “It’s weird.”
He might even be the same man—Steve feels himself reeling slightly, and tightens his grip on the mop beneath him—who tried to kill him seventy years ago.
An elevator car comes swooping down, and its doors part to reveal a massive bulldog with a sort of... tuning fork protruding from its forehead.
fired,” Rhodey informs Steve, incensed.
Before Steve can even close his mouth, let alone run to the edge of the rooftop, there’s a strange whirring sound, and something rockets up above the edge of the balcony at a tremendous speed.
Steve rights himself as the footsteps tear off in the direction of the bar; he gives chase again without a moment’s hesitation, pushing through the glass doors and shooting off several rounds of
“Doctor Richards?”

He has to stop this, once and for all. For Bucky. For Sam. For Tony.
She nods at first, then shakes her head. “Sir, I can’t—” she protests.
Tony sighs again, but this time the sound is heavier, more resigned.
to access his magical stores. He’d do it with a flourish, whether it was his first time meeting a customer or his five-hundredth.
Another figure appears in the water, floating out from behind Gracie's immense form: Dr. Nu'val looks like some sort of sea nymph or other mythological being, her all white wet suit and pale skin contrasting the black of her swim fins and her chin length hair, which is currently bobbing in a halo around her face.
Steve doesn’t know what he would have done without him.
Steve half-jogs towards the door, trying to catch up, when he hears a squawk—a distinctly different sound than either of the bots made.
“I don’t intend to raise a sissy boy. These toys are for
“No—” Steve sputters. “Of course not. But you can’t just decide—”
"I would never—" Steve continues.
too perfect. It’s even worth it if I end up being internet infamous for a few hours."
one," Steve argues, getting incensed. Who else knew what an auror even was, let alone about the Bureau? "Who the hell are you working for, Tony?"
"I don't know what a 'Doom' is, at least not in the way you seem to mean it. And I don't have anything to do with the explosions. I was investigating them, the same as you."
Steve turns to Tony at that; that doesn’t make any sense.
Not even any cachet they wielded as decorated Starfleet officers (and, in Steve's case, a bonafide living legend) had netted them access to one of the most coveted tickets on the planet: an invitation to the underwater viewing areas that were part of Dr. Prentiss' Farallon Islands research facility on the first day of the whales' return.
"Go. To. Dinner." Bobbi demands. "GO TO DINNER."
But there's still no visual of them out the windows. Tony looks to Nita.
,” Tony punches the name again, “is going to kick your sorry ass all the way back to the forties, even without a Time Turner—”
Steve shuts his eyes without a second thought, and pictures it: the peeling paint and ugly carpeting of the hallway of Sam’s apartment, rushes back into the void again, arriving momentarily at his friend’s door.
“Tell them already,” she admonishes Steve, who sits across from her at one of the enormous tables in MACUSA’s expansive commissary.
A ball of light shoots up from the center of the room, and hovers there, illuminating the passageway. It’s much as Steve had thought: mostly featureless, walls of concrete bordering them on all sides.
“Rogers,” Stoner acknowledges him, not looking up from from a stack of photographs of the blast site—eerily still for wizard photos.
Tony wrests the wand from Doom’s hands.
Redwing glides down, landing on a side table in the hallway adjacent Sam’s bedroom door, but continues to flap frantically. He seems as disturbed by Sam’s absence as Steve.
“Here you go, gentlemen,” Mrs. Arbogast says at last, handing Steve and Sam two more squares of flat plastic—nomajs really, really like their plastic—on loops of fabric cord, like the ugliest amulets Steve has ever seen. Reluctantly, he slips his over his head.
Tony looks pretty amazing himself. He’s clad in a black t-shirt that’s just a little too short for him, and tight jeans in dark indigo that cling to the lines of his body perfectly.
so. Probably not.”

. You think it's a weakness… But you're wrong. I don't measure people's lives... I save them.’ Do you know who said that, Steve?” Tony asks.
Steve blushes hard, feeling it up to the tips of his ears.
"—you want to make sure they're okay," Tony broke in, understanding dawning. "As okay as you are."
“You’d be saving your friends’ lives,” Doom beseeches Tony, sweetening the deal. “Help me adjust procedure, make it safer, and they can live on without their abilities. Think of what we could accomplish together!”
“Dee-Oh-Dee,” she finishes for him with a smile. “Mister Samuels and Mister Stevens. I’ll let Mister Rhodes know you’ve arrived. If I could just see some ID, I’ll get your access cards and lanyards ready.”
“This isn’t a panacea, you know,” Tony goes on, more seriously. “It’s… kind of the opposite. No more magical fixes to mundane injuries for me now. No healing potions, anapeo charms, skele-grow… None of it will work on me. We still have to be careful when we’re... avenging.”
If he learned anything from his seventy years as a stone statue, it’s that it’s not just himself it might get killed if he runs off half-cocked and without backup.
Doom wastes no time in retrieving his wand and firing back; he blasts a
"That's a little welcome from our friends picked up by the remote mic," she tells them both, nearly glowing in anticipation. "Captain Rogers, it's been wonderful talking to you, but I—"
"Want to see a magic trick?" Tony asks.
Tony feels like he's learning something new about Steve every day they are together. How Steve's left eyebrow hitches up just a bit higher than his right when he's seated in the command chair on the bridge and something mission related hasn't gone to plan, but he doesn't want to jump to conclusions yet. How he takes his coffee (usually black, but occasionally with amounts of sugar that would stagger a normal human). The names of the old timey tunes he sometimes hums in the shower ("I'm Beginning to See the Light" by Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots is a particular favorite). What noises he makes when he's just about come. Tony's begun to memorize every morsel of information about Steve like... well, like Steve memorizes whale facts, and everything else.
Reluctantly, Steve pulls away, just as Tony is about to deepen the kiss. Tony’s eyes flutter open as he comes back to himself.
going to be obliviated?”
It's almost unrecognizable as a building at first; there's hardly anything left of the structure. Most of the image is taken up by a crater, a wound in the surface of the earth. Part of a wall remains at the far edge of the visualization, and as Stoner adjusts the image, zooming out, bricks, rebar, and other debris can be seen.
"But—the project—Tony can't know—none of them can know about magic, about any of it, until the interview portion is over—"
"I told myself it was just another way of being magical, but I think I knew that was a lie. I hid my talents—or lack thereof, depending on how you look at it—and made it look like I was just another young wizard on his way to greatness. Another magical Stark, ready to take on the world. I even made my
“Man, I’ve
They’re starting a conversation about who some of the brightest and best are in this year’s graduating class at the Academy—Tony notes he met a particularly sharp young woman named Kamala who was eager to change the reputation of the name “Khan” during their last visit to campus. Bruno Carrelli, the guy she introduced as definitely-not-her-boyfriend, didn’t seem like a slouch in the science department either. Tony could easily see them as part of a new crop of ensigns. “Though Carelli would be Pym’s, probably, not mine,” Tony babbles on, popping another grape into his mouth.
"Nothing," Steve says.
Steve is heady with delight. He’s—he really shouldn’t be thinking this, not yet, but it’s true, it
“It’s not as elegant as yours, true,” Doom agrees with Tony’s assessment, while pulling Sam up to standing, yanking at the magical bonds. “But it protected me through the course of my experiments, so it has served me well.”
"Do you need something, Commander?"
“Speaking of animal companions,” Steve glances at Sam’s conspicuously empty shoulder, “where’s Redwing?”
—when he hears Tony’s voice say, quietly but clearly, “
. Tony feels like an idiot all over again. He hadn’t even thought, for some reason, about the ramifications of an Augment potentially passing on his DNA. And as much as they trusted Fury and the crew of the Avenger, anyone who knew Steve’s real identity and genetic status put him in danger. It was the kind of thing Steve could waive away easily enough when it was only himself at risk, but if he was discovered, who knows what the Federation might do? If he was, say, banished to another quadrant, and a child was involved—

Tony follows Steve's lead and repeats the movement, again and again, rocking forward into the sleeve, then back onto Steve's cock. Tears begin to form in Tony's eyes as he builds to a steady cadence: it feels unbelievable.
we go.”
Instead of Sam’s gait, Steve focuses on the flecks of stubble on his friend’s jaw, and the dark rings beneath his eyes.
“Then what?”
Steve huffs a laugh, awed. Cerrera or Stark, Non-magical or anti-magical… it doesn’t matter. He loves Tony so much.
Doom raises his wand arm, circling it in the air, preparing the final blow; Steve knows what’s coming.
Steve steps in between the man and Tony, blocking Tony with his body. “I wouldn’t, if I were you,” Steve warns the man.
DUM-E rolls over and flexes his claw at Steve. Steve hands the robot his mug, and sits back down.
There had been a code, Steve recalls, a cipher he and the others at the front had known... Nothing like what the cryptomancers used at Bletchley, of course. It was simple, just a letter transposition that they had sometimes used to pass messages around if they had to interact with an SOE contact, or thought maybe they were being scryed on. Each unit had a different number of letters to transpose—Steve had no idea what unit this man was a part of, though, or if that was even the cypher in question, but he could at least start working on some different combinations.
“But you’ve been around spells your whole life,” Steve considers. “You had to have been charmed before now. This never happened before?”
“But you’ve never
Like Steve would actually say no; he loves listening to Tony talk.
“Here,” he presents a colorful image on the screen. “Steve, meet Cap. I got ‘im in both physical and digital format. He’s… kinda my favorite.”
charm behind him, sending the elevator back down.
"I thought... the 'garden' part sounded nice," Steve admits, the words little more than a mumble.
Tony gestures at the occamy. “U, meet Roger. Roger, this is U—like the letter.”
The whales. They're arriving. They're swimming straight toward the observation center, their pectoral fins gently wafting up and down in time with the propulsion of their tails. Even ten meters out, it's starting to become apparent just how massive they are. And yet, they're astonishingly graceful: they look like they're flying.
"Cut the nonsense, Tony. What wizarding organization? Or country, for that matter? Is it Russia? Somewhere in Eastern Europe?"
“I don’t agree with Stoner much,” Sam says, watching their superior walk away, “But I have his back on that. You should have talked to me.” He puts a hand on a Steve’s shoulder, and Steve turns.
Steve breathes a sigh of relief, just as Rhodey stands all the way up, calling out frantically.
But an entire generation of nomajs on the front line who knew about spells and magic was simply too much for MACUSA to bear. They all had to be made to forget.
Finally—
—and curls her neck around its long arm. The robot flexes its claw, seemingly happily, like this is a thing that happens often.
Sam only hesitates a moment before tearing into the bag.
Steve feels himself beginning to grin back. “Lead on.”
“Please,” he implores her. “Don’t you wanna put that guy in his place as much as I do?”
Doom cries out in frustration as his work is destroyed before his eyes. He breaks the standoff with Steve, bringing his wand down hard, slicing his spell beam in an arc at Steve’s shoulder. The magic scorches through Steve’s uniform, tearing at his flesh, and he cries out in pain, falling to one knee.
Tony never, ever gets tired of hearing that.
“He is
Tony takes half a step away, giving himself some space to gesture, eyes sparkling with excitement.
“Yeah?”
Steve shuffles slightly. He hasn’t gotten the best sleep since his, uh, de-statue-fication, that’s true. “A bit.”
“Out flying laps around the building. It’s not like he can help us where we’re going today, anyway.”
Steve's eyes widen, first at Tony's boldness... and then at what's under his own fingertips.
They approach the old passageway to the subway tunnel, sealed off with concrete by the nomajs decades ago. Steve checks in every direction: there’s no sign of Doom out here, or of anyone for that matter.
"Fascinating stuff," Tony adds, willing his voice not to crack. (Augments really
Steve gasps involuntarily. It’s not made of glass at all, but shards of metal—a very special metal—
Scars and burn marks bubble up on the skin of Reed's face as he and Doom simultaneously writhe in pain. Finally, they both go still.
, meaning the young wizard—caused, but Steve remembers. After all, he was there. He might, he considers, be the last person alive who was. He was all of seven years old at the time, but that kind of destruction remains vivid in one’s memory.
He wants to buy Tony a bouquet of night lilies—the ones that are the same dark blue as Tony’s eyes—at the Brooklyn Bizarre Bazaar, and then turn them into butterflies with a flick of his wand.
It’s been seventy years since Steve fought the hydra, but it only feels like six months to him.
,” Sam jumps him, throwing a smile to Rhodes and a scowl to Steve, “like an amazing company.”
“Okay,” Tony exhales weightily, as if he’s just decided something important. “All right. What the hell, here goes: I said I wasn’t working for anyone—and that’s true—but I am working
“Everything?”
"Sarah." Steve sips. "After Sarah Cooper. They kept the legendary comedians theme going, although twenty-first century this time."
He's wearing those funny little tight shorts, just like the Captain character, only Bucky’s are over loud red tights. But the double breasted uniform jacket and red gloves look
“I’ll text you the address,” he says, even bolder than before (he
“I’m sorry,” Steve leans back against the workbench, his hands sliding over his face momentarily before he lets them fall to his sides. This is a mess. He sighs. “I can’t guarantee anything, but I’ll talk to Stoner Monday—”
"Uhm," Steve's gaze is suddenly drawn down the tabletop, as if by rare-earth magnets, like the ones Tony showed him. "The first day I met him."
Tony walks back over to his stool and slumps down on it, staring blankly into the middle distance.
Tony finally stops laughing. "Hey!" he protests.
“Nice patch,” she says, sincerely. “One of those new... retro things, right? It looks really good. Authentic.”
“So, you made these… bots?” Steve asks between sips of tea. “This is your lab?”
Steve lowers his mop over the landing pad, and hops down without breaking his stride. He throws the cleaning implement aside and draws his wand once more, pointing it at Tony's back as the roboticist—no, rogue wizard—makes his way into the lab. His scowl is all bravado; he hopes he looks far more confident than he his.
He cants his hips up and thrusts forward almost too quickly, slipping inside the sleeve as he slides halfway off of Steve's cock. Lube gushes noisily out of the sleeve, onto his balls and the sheets below. Then Steve squeezes, and all the metallic baubles inside the stroker rub up against Tony’s dick in the most fantastic ways.
“Who is this—?
Steve's only seen an invisibility cloak once before, in Auror Academy training, but he's never forgotten what it looked like.

Tony’s hand slides past Steve’s left pec—and his wand pocket—

Tony smiles fondly. "The same thing she always did. She just scooped me up in her arms, held me tight, and said, 'Hey,
"Yeah," Tony says, tension simmering in the rough bass notes of his voice. "Now you're getting it. I'm not a murderer, or a bomber, or

have thought to do this on my own, so... thank you. Truly."
Scott coughs. “Hope to what now?”
He hops off his stool and paces away. Steve assumes he's going to get more coffee, but Tony stops at the far end of the workbench from where U is resting, and grabs a keyboard. It's not connected to anything that Steve can see. He's no expert, but doesn't there have to be a screen of some kind—?
It's going to be okay. They're going to be okay.
,” Tony says, defensive. He walks to the end the table to retrieve U, who’s been woken up by the shouting. “Is that the only thing you think is important?” he challenges Steve, draping the occamy about his shoulders.
Without looking away, Tony raises a hand and snaps his fingers with another stylish flair, and all the baskets fall to the floor at once.
Tony chuckles. "Yeah. Oh,
. But Tony doesn’t know who he is yet, not really. The thought of Tony calling him

think I was a spellcaster. Jarvis was the only one who knew the truth, and bless his heart, he never told anyone... Until it all came out in public."
The other thing about not being on assignment anymore means Steve can wear what he likes to RI when he visits his boyfriend. In this case, it’s a slim fitting white t-shirt and a pair of olive khakis with brown boots. He’s not an expert on nomaj clothing yet, but he’s experimenting. So far—if Tony’s expressions are anything to go by—he’s not doing too badly.
A completely separate elevator looks like it can be boarded from the rooftop bar, and taken down to street level; if Steve was trying to get away without having to double back through the main entrance, that would probably be the first thing he would try.
He tucks the paper under his arm and is about to leave when she nods at the shoulder of his jacket.
Normally Steve would assume this was innuendo, Tony giving them a chance to (heh) experiment in the lab.
What was that about?
Sam, Reed, and Rhodey disapparate, blinking out of existence.
Steve could kick himself.
"Welcome to the Olive Garden," the server greets them, not sounding all that welcoming, while depositing a basket of breadsticks on the table. "Times Square," she adds, as if that bit wasn't completely obvious. “I’ll be back in a few moments to take your orders.”
Steve remembers the last time he saw an armored figure wearing a cloak. He suppresses a shudder as he tries to keep pace with the trespasser.
“So quit,” Tony pleads, reaching for Steve like he’s at risk of slipping away. “Work with me. Do you know how much good we could do? Haven’t you ever thought about that before?” He counts off the possibilities on his fingers. “Wizards can conjure food in an instant, apparate across the city in the blink of an eye, regrow bones and heal wounds! Did you ever stop to think how many people we could help? We—the whole wizarding community—we can do better than this!”
As if he knows what Steve's thinking, the man presses a catch on the side of the helmet, and its faceplate pops open, confirming Steve's worst fears.
"No,” Tony reassures him, voice a little hoarse. “It wasn't—isn’t—like that with you. I figured you were a wizard—no offense, but you knew less about defense contracts than just about anyone I'd ever worked with at RI—and, ah, the Olive Garden thing kind of clinched it. But you never made me feel less-than. Maybe for a minute out there on the balcony, I guess—”
Tony, seemingly pleased with that answer, smiles and leans in again, closing his eyes. Steve does the same, feeling a soft, warm breath, gentle on his lips just before they meet Tony's.
He thinks he could, even without drawing his wand, push the man back down into his seat with a simple
He's going to have to place Tony under arrest now. Tony will be put on trial, and imprisoned at the Raft—the underwater wizarding prison just off the coast, the last prison in the United States to still use Dementors as guards. He'll stay there for the rest of his life—that is, if he's not sentenced immediately to the Dementor’s Kiss.
to me growing up,” Tony goes on about Steve’s fictionalized counterpart. “Everything. I don't think you understand."
Steve’s almost made it to to the door, when he hears Lang call out to him again.
Tony hooks his fingers in his belt loops and shuffles in place, for once not offering a witty quip in response, seemingly unable to take in that Steve just implied that he was ‘brave at heart.’
His colleagues who were officially assigned to the case had cleaned up the previous sites straight away; the fact that they had left the crime scene, and the evidence contained therein, remain as-is was telling—were they having trouble finding additional leads?
Steve jumps back, letting out a little gasp.
Doom holds it aloft triumphantly, presenting it to Tony.
Opening his eyes, he comes face to face with the remains of a bombing—the signature silver starburst pattern is even more pronounced this time—it's even more beautiful and horrible than it had appeared in Stoner’s scans.

It should all be beautiful. It

got to get out of here and talk.
Tony stretches out his hand in a curve before him, as if highlighting a newspaper headline. "STARK BOY IS A WUNDERKIND! Surely the next great wizard of our age!"
It's going to be okay, he thinks.
“Would you—” he starts, a little dreamily.
Tony shakes his head. "It's fine."
, and
Red bloomed in Steve's cheeks at being called out so directly. He paused a moment, then took a deep breath. "Well, it's just that... they're from out of time, too. They're from the twentieth century, and I—"
It stares at them, unmoving and unimpressed.
"C'mon inside," Tony invites Steve. "We should talk. I'll make you tea, Roger. If that is, in fact, your real name."
The shadow of a scowl overtakes Tony's expression; Steve can feel Tony tensing in his arms.
Steve shudders at Tony’s choice of words, even though his hypothesis is sound. Who could think any of this was a ‘success’?
“Distract me from the pain,” Steve requests, squeezing Tony’s hand again. “Did you tell Doom I was your
There’s a faint… beeping sound inside. The light on the security panel turns green, and… the door...begins to open of its own accord?
His smile fades again. “I’m really sorry you lost your bracers, though—er, well, the orb. I know you loved your spellshield.”
Never let it be said that Tony Stark ever does less than his best for his Captain.
"Of course," says Steve, nodding, both relieving her from continuing the conversation and reflecting her delight right back to her. "It was a pleasure meeting you."
Sliding his wand between the folds of the cloak, Steve casts a spell, and the concrete splits and begins to slide apart, shaking the earth beneath their feet as it moves.
Steve… has no idea what any of that means, but Tony is smiling more than ever, so Steve smiles right back.
DUM-E makes a beeline for the occamy, who shrinks obligingly to the same height as the robot—
“Then what is it, Rogers?”
Steve’s shuddering climax ripples through Tony’s own body, a secondary wave of pleasure, almost too much to take in.
- Steve Englehart (
Tony pulls a metal stool away from one of the work benches and sits. Steve feels a nudge next to him, and sees that DUM-E has pushed up one for him as well.
Steve blasts off a "REVELIO!", but the figure moves too quickly, dodging his spell. They rush toward and through the faux wall, the cloak flapping around them as they go, a shimmer of light, disturbing the air.
Of course, there’s the name of the place as well. It is, in Steve's opinion, a bit misleading.
“You know how you said you had something… bigger than a shovel?”
The room shakes again, and up from the ground a structure begins to rise. A circular metal platform surfaces first. From it, curved panes of glass ascend, reaching up to the room’s ceiling, creating a cylindrical holding cell of some kind. It looks like a fusion of technology and magic, and it crackles with energy, seemingly unstable.
"Is this what you want?" Steve asks almost distantly, as if he wasn't pounding away at Tony's asshole.
It doesn’t matter. The spell reflects off his hand, leaving him unharmed.
Doom staggers backward, terror reflected in his dark eyes. Tony moves forward, filling the space.
A cheer goes up in the viewing room. Dr. Prentiss, standing closest to the panel of transparent aluminum, releases a held breath and laughs softly. Even Dr. Nu'val, the researcher and designated cetacean interpreter standing next to her, cracks the tiniest of smirks—pretty much the Vulcan equivalent of punching the air.
But the speech isn't—at least, not one of the few words he learned from his mom. And it's not English, either.
Doom raises his free hand, and makes a fist, squeezing. Rhodey’s gun crumples, the twisted heap of unusable metal teetering off his shoulder and landing on the concrete.
“At ease, Commander.” Steve’s voice is a rasp. “God, I love you.”
He should
“Whatever it is, it’s
, I think my time in the military might have been a factor, too," Steve adds, hoping he can adlib around that topic more easily than his childhood.
, and
, all right?"
, big guy," Tony wriggles out of Steve's grasp, shoving him away. "Look," he says more calmly, holding up his hands.
A robotic huff of air comes from the helmet—a sigh, Steve thinks.
Bobbi shrugs nonchalantly. "So don't bring magic up. You don't have to tell him your life story on the first date. 'I was in a lake in Germany for 70 years' is a little much for anyone to handle, wizard or not. Just... have dinner. See if you click."
It has absolutely
"But you're doing okay now, though, right?"
Tony turns, adjusting his trajectory, bringing Steve out of his thoughts, and Steve follows.
He couldn’t see past his own prejudices, couldn’t let Tony in—can’t seem to let anyone in—Bobbi, Carol, Sam—
A glimmer rolls over the silver armor hologram, and suddenly it's covered over in rich carnelian with amber accents, just like the back of Tony’s calling cards.
Tony's eyes are closed, but the twisting shapes of light filtering in from the floor to ceiling windows of their underwater hotel suite dance over his eyelids. (They were on the waitlist for over a year for this place; If Tony was going to book them a sea-themed weekend, he was going to do it right. It's located just off the mainland, miles from Blue Point, but the effect is very much the same. Except, of course, with no other guests and no whales to peek in on them. Which is good, because what Steve's doing to Tony at the moment might, in fact, make even a whale blush.)
“Can you, uh?” he asks, nodding at Doom. “Before he tries to get away?”
Scott drifts down to the table, maneuvering into the seat next to Bobbi, a spectral cup of coffee appearing before him with ethereal steam rising from it. He's still wearing his auror's robes, just as he had been back in 1972, when he was killed on the job by a stray curse.
you, and I know who you are—I should have trusted you—"
It's been three years since Fury lured him out to San Francisco to show him pretty pictures of oversized nacelles, and subsequently introduced to him to the man he'd idolized his whole life in two different ways. The man who would save his life, break his heart, then save his life
Steve points his wand at himself, and light spills over his form, transfiguring his suit into auror robes. He closes his eyes, focusing on a few new details. The double-breasted uniform jacket is still a familiar navy, but Steve lets red and white thread stitch itself into a delicate pattern of stripes on the sleeves and at the hem. On each shoulder, a silver-white star embroiders itself, nearly glowing under the cover of the cloak.
"He meant
As Tony glances back at Steve, he scowls, his eyes narrowing to slits.
Tony beckons to one of the baskets, and it floats closer to him. He plucks it from the air, and, rooting around in the breadsticks, he pulls out the purple unicorn.
“We hold,” Steve tells Rhodes.
knowledgeable and professional, not to mention helpful."
“Now…” His hands fall still. He stares at them. “Do you remember what I said the day we met?” He stops himself before Steve can reply. “What am I talking about? I know you do.”
“Doom,” Tony calls out to the dark wizard, letting his voice waver slightly. He sounds less arrogant—curious, even. “How… how would it work? You giving me powers?”
The left corner of Tony’s mouth curls downward. “Bad name? Okay, okay, it’s a work in progress. But whatever we’re called, they’re…my friends. They’re all sort of magical outcasts. Like me.”
The gathered attendees all hush as the first wave of it comes loud and clear over the speakers. Heads swivel in all directions in unison, everyone trying to get their first look, as if they're all wondering how they could have missed the giant beasts' approach.
Light shimmers over Steve as well, dressing Steve in a smart two-piece suit, but he barely notices the change. He can’t tear his eyes away from the business card until Sam begins speaking again.
Reed, on the other hand, is a deformed mess, driven back to unconsciousness by the pain.
reading he’s been doing lately.
Tony steps around a metal partition, two Rhodes Industries logo mugs in hand.
Stoner flicks his wand again and turns the entire image, and now visible in the foreground is a sign: LAYTON PREPARATORY ACADEMY.
His captain. His partner. His home.
Oh. Kids at the Academy made him think of… yeah, Tony can see him making that connection. Damn. He thought he might get through the night scot-free, that he might not have to address the, uh, whale in the room, so to speak.
New footsteps echo in the room as the shaking dies down, and a man’s voice incants a
" Steve stops, realizing how much he's raised his voice, and tries again, his tone more measured. "I thought... you were only supposed to tell someone who you were...
Doom lets loose another spell from his wand; the broken glass fragments shimmer, turning to bits of metal, each one sharp as a knife’s edge. Flicking upward, he sends them hurtling through the air toward the occamy, swarming her, biting into her sensitive scales.
It looks for a moment like Tony might be sporting a bit of color on his cheeks as well, but he pivots on his heel and heads out of the room before Steve can be sure.
He rises, crossing back to the massive contraption enclosed around Sam.
His lingering hurt and frustration from his argument with Tony is dissipating as seconds tick by in between his knock attempts.
They stop first at the twenty-seventh floor, where the head office for Magical Transit Authority is located, and the dog exits.
Shifting from fully invisible to merely translucent, ex-auror Scott Lang fades into view.
"Maybe not," Steve agrees. "But I'd like to. If you want to tell me about it."
“Because,” Steve starts, quietly channelling every ounce of distress he’s feeling into his tone as he waits patiently for the occamy to respond. “There’s a chance this could end up with someone getting murdered, and there is no way in hell I am letting Tony—
That’s why Steve’s here, pretending to be someone else: Rhodes Industries is a rising star in the nomaj military technology sector. Their equipment is so advanced, the briefing said, it seems to border on the magical already; it seems likely they could produce wand scanners and other magi-technological devices for the Auror’s Bureau and other divisions.
“The runes carved into the floor, at the last site.” Steve pulls his wand out, and recreates the Ogham glyphs by drawing them in the air. “The letters are Irish, but the words are—”
“—stabilized the spell, made it so you could summon more than one person, and prepared it for mass incantation,” Tony explained. “He was a natural born wizard. But even he knew he couldn’t have done it without the help of his W.A.N.D.D. colleagues. Yeah,” Tony nods at Steve’s surprised look. “The Tee-Dub was a military project at first. Back in the early eighties, there was a huge push to explore the scientific properties of magic—a real renaissance period. For a time, people actually wanted to understand what made magic
“We’re not going to cancel each other out and blow each other up, are we?” Steve asks, hoping he doesn’t sound like an idiot for even mentioning it.
"What?" Tony asks seriously, taking in Steve's observant silence.
Another metallic structure rises just in front of the contraption, a sort of console, or podium, Steve surmises. The pedestal at its top has a depression, a space for some kind of object to rest.
, he thinks, flicking his wrist, and, as he succumbs to the nauseating squeezing feeling that always accompanies disapparating, he vanishes into thin air.
Steve is holding fast to him, but gently, as if letting Tony know he's wanted but not trapped. "Tony—"
Steve? Tony's never struck Steve as the cruel type, but he doesn't understand Tony's reaction at all.
“I don't think so,” he says after a long pause. “Probably not. Definitely not.” He nods, then feels his mouth twist to the side. “Probably definitely.” He chuckles at himself, at the absurdity of those words together, and Steve smiles at him, still very carefully not looking either hopeful or disappointed, Tony notices. “But…” He scrubs his hands over his face and grumbles in frustration.
"It's not illegal," he says, not answering Steve's question directly. "So what’s the—oh," Tony face falls, his delight from mere moments ago draining away. "I’m not a wizard. That’s it, isn’t it?"
"That's... an occamy," Steve breathes, astounded.
He raises his free hand in a fist, exultant, and takes a half step away from the orb, back in Tony’s direction.
He’s halfway through the door as his enhanced hearing catches a scrap of their conversation.
The artifact flies in their direction.
It looks like Tony's headed back to RI.
Tony had looked up from his worktable, shoving aside a hologram schematic to look at Steve head on. "You're really got an interest in these whales, huh?" He bit his lip, squinted. "I just wouldn't have expected it, I guess."
There aren't many surviving photos of the damage it—or perhaps rather,
He sighs and pulls out the card.
“But now?”
"Very okay," Steve reassured him with a kiss.
. Reed has an interesting theory,” he adds brightly.
Bobbi throws her hands over her eyes and groans. "Oh my god. You’re
Steve is fucking Tony from behind the way he does everything: thoroughly, with decisiveness and precision—and achieving amazing results.
When he finally extracts his hand, what he pulls out is an orb, about four inches in diameter, its surface glistening in a sort of craquelure pattern, bringing to mind broken glass.
your friend—”
He’s alive. He’s
organization. They’re posing as nomajs?
—a grabbing spell. He catches chairs and cocktail tables with the spell as he goes, narrowly missing the perp's cloak every time. Steve growls in frustration, flinging furniture to the side. There’s going to be a lot of cleanup enchantment, not to mention a ridiculous amount of paperwork, but he can’t think of that right now.
"—Stark," he provides, pleased he's gotten to the point of remembering his name again. He extends a hand, settles into a smile. "But please, call me Tony."
Feeling chilly and exposed, Tony sits up and covers himself with the comforter. Steve raises an arm in invitation. Tony crashes into the pile of pillows beside him, cozying up next to him, looking anywhere but at Steve’s face.
“What is it, Tony?”
He stalks through the lab, searching behind every chair and workbench.
As relieved as Steve is that he's not actually facing a hydra, it doesn't explain much of anything, least of all Tony's casual attitude. Doesn't he realize the seriousness of the situation?
Sam scrambles to his feet, moving to the center of the tube, trying to stay away from the magical energy now cascading over the glass panels. "Hey," he shouts desperately. "HEY!!"
He could have just responded to Steve belatedly and said "I love you, too."
it, have you?” Tony needles him. “I’m doing this—forming the Avengers—with or without you. Are you going to report me? Am
“There’s also this stuff called anti-matter. It has some things in common with matter, but some ways, it’s matter’s polar opposite, too. It’s hard to explain. The most interesting thing about it, though, is it’s incredibly rare, and no one can really explain
"Oh, I'll tell you, Commander." Steve's whisper is rough, demanding. The sound sends shockwaves down Tony's spine. His underwear seems to have shrunk about two sizes. "You'll be very clear on what I want done."
Sam smirks as he opens the door to the meeting room where their morning briefing starts in five minutes.
But life—nomaj life in particular—is funny that way sometimes.
Maybe someone with an entire military technology company at their disposal?
Steve pauses fucking him abruptly.
The perp has him at a disadvantage; if they're a wizard—and they must be, really; who else would have an invisibility cloak?—they can just apparate away. Unless Steve can get in touching distance of them and follow along, he'll have no idea where they're going. Spells leave a trace, and Steve has the training to follow them, but there are obscuring countercharms; if the person he’s tracking is gone, they’re probably gone for good.
He holds the sheets in front of his face momentarily, shielding himself as well as taking in a cursory few details.
Sam points his wand at himself, and whispers a transfiguration incantation. A wave of light ripples over his brown trench coat, rumpled blue button down and khakis, transforming them into a smart grey business suit and clean, pressed white shirt with a black tie.
Even at little sidewalk shops, it’s all tech now, no spellcasting necessary. It’s silly, probably, but Steve misses old Mr. McDonagh flicking his wrist and using
was what DUM-E’s motion had reminded him of on the first day he met Tony. And presumably, that explained the movement he saw in Tony’s lab that he couldn’t account for—the occamy making an appearance, and then shrinking down to a size too small to be seen.
Tony smiles, and without warning, pushes into Steve’s personal space, his hand sliding under the lapel of Steve’s jacket. For a moment, Steve thinks Tony is about to kiss him—or something even
Tony gives a quick, surreptitious glance around, as if to make sure they aren't being watched, and, satisfied that the staff and other patrons are too busy annoying each other to see whatever he is about to do, he opens the briefcase.
Rick Stoner, head of the Federal Auror’s Bureau, flicks his wrist, and from his wand springs forth a 3D representation of the crime scene in the front of meeting room. Several gasps are heard from the crowd of assembled aurors at the all-staff.
Tony swings his legs and uses the momentum to pop back down off the workbench. God, he’s excited today. Steve can’t really blame him. Being told you’re not special for years on end, only to find out you might be the only one of your kind on the planet? It’s got to be exciting. And maybe a little terrifying.
He remembers explaining his own origin to disbelieving nomaj soldiers on that mission with Simonson, thinking there was no harm in telling the tale. It made everyone laugh, and boosted morale. The nomajs all had to be obliviated anyway, after the fighting stopped, so why hold back?
He’ll have to be on his own for a while longer.
Steve is overcome with joy—both at the progress they’ve suddenly made on the case,
A quick
He talks a mile a minute about SLAM algorithms, ABSO data, and possible improvements in teach pendants, and Steve doesn't understand a word of it, but he's captivated nonetheless, finds himself getting lost in the rhythm of it. Computers and robots can do so much, Tony explained to him. They can cart supplies around hospitals, automate difficult tasks, harvest crops, keep people safe.
“Better than that, Steve. I was
Rhodes laughs. “Okay, Mister Samuels, I guess that’s you, then. Reed’ll be here shortly. And for the robotics tour, Mister Stevens—”
“You’ve said it yourself: you hate magic. But if I may offer a small amendment, I think what you actually hate is wizardkind. They’ve humiliated you, made it clear how
“He didn’t give up. Everyone said he wasn’t really a soldier, that he could
He finally looks away from the character's bright clothing to see his face. He's struck by how much it looks like, well,

. It’s a brilliant bit of metafiction incorporating all kinds of Chicago history and traditions, and I highly encourage you to read the whole tag; it’s waaaay waaaay better than what J.K. hastily and largely insensitively threw together for her Wizarding World history in the US.
"Captain Rogers and Commander—" Dr. Prentiss looks to Tony, like his name is on the tip of her tongue.
- Not dissimilar from Petter Pettigrew and his little finger, Bucky is definitely alive, sans arm; I wonder how a long term Imperio curse would affect someone’s mind, hm?…
Wordlessly, Steve thrusts his bagel bag at Sam's chest.
"I know what house you would have been sorted into," Steve grins.
Tony gestures to the room. “After you.”
Joyful moments are like this are a bit less rare than maybe they once were, but there is still no one Tony would rather spend any of them with.
It lands in Steve’s palm with a satisfying smack, just a fraction of a second before Doom can reach for it. But that’s all the time Steve needs.
Tony reaches across the table to stop Steve before he can cover his ruby-red face yet again, catching the fingers of Steve's right hand with his own.
Their cackling echoes so loudly in the lab that it actually wakes up U, who puffs up to twice the size she was when sleeping, and gives an irritated snuffle.
Before Steve can be offended, he notices that Tony's pivoted, directing his shout toward the lab door. The tea-making robot, apparently summoned from Tony’s office, rolls out onto the balcony.
"Oh, uh, right the… Captain America thing,” Tony dives back into his story awkwardly, apparently desperate to change the topic.
At least fifteen feet tall, its long, serpentine neck uncoils, arcing down over Steve menacingly. Its mouth opens, releasing a high-pitched cry.
never done that,” Steve spits back, unyielding.
The whales are doing a second lap. Dr. Prentiss is opening the floor up for a Q&A. Dr. Nu'val is about to begin speaking, by way of a mind meld, to George. The world moves on around them.
"Clint is. I showed you Clint—he has a bow and arrow? Long story, but—"
acidic
There's a stir behind them, and Dr. Nu'val, now outfitted with an underwater breather to go with her wetsuit, is heading upstairs, preparing for her dive and communication session with the whales.
, he can’t—
Tony shivers and blinks and squeezes Steve before interrupting him and pushing away from his chest a few inches.
“Your dad—?” Steve asks.

“There you go. NFC,” Tony says simply, sing-songing, as if that should mean something to Steve. “Easy as 1-2-3.”
ready,” Rhodey bristles.
“Thank you,” he tells her finally, sincerely.
Tony waves their waitress down, and she crosses to him, looking annoyed.
Before Steve can risk another painful laugh, the popping sound of wizards apparating fills the room, and suddenly, half of the Auror’s Bureau surrounds them.
He raises an eyebrow, making the same expression he did the first day they met, when he was asking about coffee and tea, and thinking about his robots. Steve's starting to think of it as Tony's Planning Face, and it thrills and terrifies Steve in equal measure.
Everything is
Bobbi's eyes go wide and she breaks out in an open-mouthed grin. "Get out! When?"
Should he just... leave? No, he can't—he still has so many questions for Tony—but he's caused so much hurt already. He doesn't want to make it worse.
“We can make that future together, Tony. We have so much in common.”
It's one of his calling cards, the same kind he gave to Steve on the day they met.
Leaning in the doorway to Rhodes’ office, grinning, casual as anything, is the most beautiful man Steve has ever seen.
Stoner lets his wand fall to his side, and the image dissipates. "Dismissed."
It’s... not ideal, that’s for certain, but it will have to do: from a janitor’s rolling bucket, he retrieves a rather disgusting looking floor mop. Not even stopping to wring the water out of it, Steve climbs aboard it and lifts off. Descending only momentarily to scoop up the invisibility cloak, he sails over the balcony’s edge and into the night.
“That’s a pre-release,” Tony says, nodding at the broom. “The six-hundred series doesn’t come out until the fall. I got one of their sales witches a new Stark Equinox 7 tee-dub with an unlimited conjuring plan,” he explains, “And she got me one of those.”
When they part and Steve opens his eyes again, he finally notices that the sun has completely set; the massive billboards all around them are shining all the brighter, streaming light down on them, casting a multicolored, dancing glow over both their faces.
Steve doesn’t have time to dodge. He’s hit full on, and pain racks his entire body. His vision whites out and his mouth hangs slack; he can’t even hear himself scream.
It's a suit of armor, but it's unlike anything Steve's ever seen. It may well have been inspired by the medieval knights' attire on display at Hogwarts, on some level, drawn from a memory from Tony's childhood. But it's so much sleeker than those must have been, the lines so much cleaner and more precise.
The first Reed stands and pulls a small vial from his pocket. He uncorks and tosses it to Tony, as if in answer.
"I've... picked up a few things. Maybe," Steve allows.
In a night already full of huge smiles, Tony breaks into an even bigger one. His centuries old secretly illegal boyfriend is the cutest.
For minutes, they say nothing, waiting and watching in peaceful silence, the occasional fish or loose twist of seaweed floating past the window.
Next year.
Steve is still just wearing the suit he usually wears to RI. He can’t help but feel he’s wearing a costume, but he has no idea what else might look good when not paired with wizarding robes. He wishes he could be himself, explain to Tony who he really is… but who he really is has already caused him enough trouble for one evening.
"Yeah?" He gives Tony a sheepish half-smile, and gets a little reassuring squeeze of Tony's hand as a reward.
The door swings open with a slam, but before Steve can cast anything, he’s hit with a blast—it's like no spell he's ever experienced,  a bolt of pure energy striking him square in the chest. He's knocked back into the opposite wall, stunned.
Instead, he has to pretend to be knowledgeable about pizza places he’s never been to and rock bands he’s never heard of.
,” Steve replies, in what he hopes is similarly flirtatious fashion.
Steve blushes again, and rushes out of the room, hearing the door latch as he shuts it behind him.
He reaches for Tony’s face, trying to brush his gauntleted hand against Tony’s cheek. The blue glow throws Tony’s features into sharp relief; he looks nervous for the first time since Steve arrived down here.
“AVADA KEDAVRA!”
"A stone statue?" Scott offers. Bobbi scowls and swats at him. Her hand passes through him. "Sorry," Scott winces.
," he intones with gravitas typically reserved for dictating to one's officer report log, "
Steve spares a momentary glance to his left. U is now over sixty feet long, her massive undulating body curling up around the containment chamber. She tightens her grasp, squeezing for all she’s worth.
Steve takes a deep breath. Where to start?
Tony rests his head against Steve's shoulder again, musing about how he'll have to write a script that leaves comments on all the videos taken of the incident, discrediting it as a hoax.
Steve leaps in front of the nomaj, and counters Doom’s curse with a blue bolt of his own. The spell energies clash, each canceling the other out, locked in mid-air.
” Doom howls, throwing his arms in the air, enraged. “He
Reed was recovering slowly but steadily—the healers at HMC prescribed him bedrest, continual application of dittany to his scars, and plenty of chocolate. He has been having trouble with the first one; he is nearly as inquisitive as Tony, and upon arriving at a magimedical facility, he kept asking the healers on call questions about their work. Steve had heard they finally had to slip him a sleeping draught in his pumpkin juice to get him to calm down.
badly to touch himself. And Steve hasn't specifically said not to, not tonight. But Tony knows the sort of mood Steve's in, that they're both in. He knows the game they're playing. Neither of them has to say it out loud.
"Steve,” Steve tells him plainly. “Steve Rogers.” It feels good to say out loud, not to lie anymore.
From anyone else, Steve would suspect that this was a load of garbage; sweet lies to try and set him at ease and get the night back on track.
“I need…”
"I dated a nomaj a while back," Bobbi chimes in, "But he was only into dive bars."
—even if they adopted—
He stops just inches short of Stoner, demanding the director’s attention. “Sir.”
The creature shrieks again and spreads its wings—no, wing, singular—there's only one on the right side of its long, narrow body—
Tony lifts his chin up. “Whoever needs to be saved,” he says, his voice even, expression every bit as grave as Steve. “Muggles, wizards, house elves—anyone. Everyone.”

good at covering how terrified he is. Steve is laying odds it’s the latter; he stands by his assessment of what house Tony belongs in.
That would be impossible, he tells himself. Doom can't still be alive.
As soon as he reappears on the other side of the door, Steve takes in the space around him. It’s dark and silent inside; Sam isn’t there. Dammit.
He and Sam approach the massive, arching reception desk in the lobby, and they peer over the counter to see a middle-aged woman with dark hair, wearing cat-eye glasses. She has something of the appearance of a librarian—wise, sharp, and perhaps warm as well.
Steve soars a thousand feet above Central Park, just darting up into the clouds enough to maintain some cover from the nomajs below, but low enough to keep an eye on Tony's flight pattern.
“Evening: Kyle, Kyle’s Loud Father,” Tony greets them pleasantly, just as Angela is bringing their requested soda and breadsticks.
“You didn’t do a damn thing wrong,” Steve says, firm but kind. “You didn’t ‘slip up’, and even if you had, you’re allowed. You’re allowed to change your mind. You’re allowed to work it out over time.” He holds both of Tony’s hands in his own, like he’s holding something precious to him, something rare and breathtaking. “I want to be there for you as you do. And I want you to be there for me.” He cups Tony’s face in his hand, and damn Steve, he’s about to put tears in Tony’s eyes again, and it’s for much more terrifying reasons this time.
"Goddammit, Roger," the man says, sounding disappointed. "You couldn't leave it alone, could you?"
He had heard about the Mirror of Erised growing up, the magical glass that showed you your heart’s fondest desire—what kid hadn’t?—and always wished he could see it.
Steve’s mouth hangs slightly open in astonishment. “I’m… sorry, sir?  You said
with the man. They
“That’s your cue to disapparate,” Tony informs him coldly, not looking him in the eye. “See you Monday, Steve.”
Rhodes beams with pride. "Good! Good. I notice you've been spending a lot of time with Tony in particular."
“Calling cards.” Tony tells Steve.
He takes a few steps towards the desk and peers over the plastic wall, but there’s nothing to be seen. Huh.
The metal of Doom’s armor goes suddenly dull. His cape lays flat, enchantment nullified. Finally, the glamor dissolves from his face, his scarred countenance returning.
Steve surveys the situation. Rhodey is still struggling to free Tony and Reed, U is badly hurt, and Sam is shaken and unarmed.
"That is totally true," Scott concedes. "On both points."

Now that sentiment, Tony understands entirely.
At the same time, Rhodes un-slings a massive firearm from his back. He settles it on his shoulder, peering through the sight, aiming, and launches a rocket at the dark wizard.
“Well,” Tony muses, nodding at the mug in Steve’s hands. “It
No, the image reminds him of something much older. Most people remembered the incident as the Great Obliviation of 1926, or possibly as the ordeal with Newt Scamander, who went on to become something of a celebrity in magizoology.
“A ghost. You’re alive, Steve. Bobbi’s right: you’ve gotta start living.”
"I really did." The man's dimples should be outlawed, Tony thinks, then remembers that they actually are, along with the rest of him.

Heading back to the ground and catching a cab would be too slow, and he
“Oh, god, I
Maybe this was a bad idea. Maybe he won’t be able to get Rhodes to come around on this. He’s still going to need a way to fight Doom. He should look for an alternative form of backup.
Tony arranges the pillows into something a little more suitable for sleeping, and slides down into the bedding to get cozy, suddenly not even sure he’ll be able to stay awake long enough for Steve to return. Even a year ago, he’d have forced his eyes open to confirm he wouldn’t be sleeping alone. Now, he knows Steve will come back. He knows it.
Rhodes employed hundreds of people, but there were only maybe a dozen he and Sam interacted with regularly. He should go back to RI, see if he could use his system access to get a list—
to hurt Tony, or are thinking of using your relationship with him to get at the company—"
He spins around, then, and, exactly on time, pulls Steve into a kiss.
"I couldn't make things... happen, like I was supposed to. I tried saying the magic words, and thinking about it really hard, and believing in it with all my might… Nothing ever worked. But then, one day, my mom got a care package from one of her old nomaj colleagues from her school days. It was a beginner's electronics kit—they had no idea about Howard being a wizard, or that I was supposed to be one, too. And that day it was like... it was like I found magic.
"What was that?"
Two right turns and a left brings them to a locked door with a security panel beside it.
"Of course! Which is why you are definitely not thinking about dating Tony, and we definitely didn't have this talk."
"And Steve."
He barely stops himself before he gasps.
But what he says, leaning back against Steve even further, is: "Do you ever think about... uh... starting a... a 'pod'? You and me?"
What does technology have to do with it? Not that Steve isn't impressed by that as well, but doesn't Tony want to talk about magic? After all the time they’ve spent hiding it from one another?
But before Steve can get another word out, a massive, inhuman figure appears before him, seemingly out of nowhere.
, Steve remembers,
, and I would
"Sure," Tony agrees, and the knot in his throat is releasing. He squeezes Steve's hands. "Sounds good."
“Not once. But Reed thinks the traumatic nature of the curse I was hit with might have triggered it. Stress causes mutation in a number of species—usually over the course of millennia. But magic is… you know… special. Maybe it just took that one hit.”
It’s almost entirely dark inside—giving Steve awful flashbacks of the cave system containing the hydra he fought—but if his other senses are to be trusted, it sounds like he’s in a plain concrete room. Just on the other side of it, Steve surmises, is the old City Hall station; Steve had seen it as a child, its graceful swooping curves and leaded skylights burned into his memory. Doom must be creating his own gateway from that side of the passage.
badly to show Tony his world—to thank Tony for all that he’s shown Steve, and give Tony something special in return.
) is the Cap writer responsible for giving us Nomad (thanks, Steve XD). I was going to call the bakery “Gruenwald’s” but I was afraid it would be confusing this universe; it sounds too much like Grindelwald. These ideas are both, of course, nods to the inclusion of “Brubaker’s Bakery” in Avengers Assemble. (
He hears Sam and Tony before he can see them.
"Not exactly..." he begins. "My family was very conservative. Part of an... insular community, you might say. I'm not sure I want to talk about it—"
Tony slows and eventually stops, levitating in the air, twenty feet above where Steve is standing. Light radiates from his palms and the soles of his feet, as well as from the eye slits of the silver mask.
As she replaces the empty basket with a full one, she sighs tiredly, and glances back and forth between Tony and Steve.
Soon, though, it becomes clear that Tony is as cagey on certain topics as Steve is.
Grasping at the base of Tony's shaft and gently angling it away from his body, Steve fits the open end of the stroker just over the tip of Tony's cockhead... and stops. Tony gasps: the lube is cold, sending a chill up his spine, and the slick, tight contact is amazing, but not nearly enough. He supposes there's a single solution to both those problems. The engineering portion of his brain, if it were even remotely functional right now, would like the efficiency of that.
was... an understatement."
“Tony,
“I don’t do magic,” Tony continues, vitriol coming off him in waves, “so I don’t get the privilege of deciding who and who isn’t in your club—”
Eventually the glass, even bolstered as it is by Doom’s spellcraft, cracks unders the strain, shattering into a million pieces. U shields Sam with her coils, allowing the shards to rain down, bouncing off her scales as they fall to the ground.
"Okay," Steve nods on a determined exhale, gripping the edge of the table, as if to steady himself. "Okay. Dinner."
“Anyway...” Tony approaches his desk, gaze coasting over the work surface until it lights on a stack of flat plastic circles. He grabs one off the top, and then returns to Steve, handing it to him.
He manages a half smile. “Thanks,” he offers quietly.
“All right,” Steve huffs a laugh, “Glad I finally wore you out. With talking, if nothing else.”
“The what?”
“...completely awesome, right?” Tony fills in. “But you know what would make it even better?”
The underwater microphone catches some stray bubbles from the breather, but Dr. Nu'val's words are clear enough. "Gracie has indicated that they are all pleased to be here once again."
Steve... says nothing. He hadn't considered that was what Tony could be at all.
“Not a normal
Steve beams.
A snap of his black, angular wand, and his signature armor materializes on his person. A green cape appears in mid-air and floats down to curl about his shoulders.
“What?” Tony takes another step backward, as if trying to propel himself away from Steve’s distasteful words. “NO! God, no. FAB would never approve of us. They’ll actively try to shut us down—if they even deign to take us seriously, that is. We have to stay off their radar.” He scoffs. “It’s not like we’re going to be working with the NYPD, either.”
Back on the monitor, the edges of the blobs sharpen and form ichthyoid outlines. After what seems like an eternity—probably about ten seconds in reality—a shimmer breaks the surface: a cloud of mist bursts from one massive blowhole, then a second, and a third smaller one.
“Hey, Ab,” Bobbi twists back in the seat, greeting her partner casually. “Steve is. Probably. If he gets the nerve up. You know any hot nomaj spots?”
Something incredible happens, though, as Tony is describing it:
“Tony…?” Steve asks, trying to coax out an explanation out of him.
Steve pauses. He’s already here, and it doesn’t appear anyone else from the Bureau is around at the moment.
"What?"
Bucky
Tony doesn't have to be told twice.
They say nothing to each other, simply strolling quickly and holding hands, wearing matching expressions that resemble the kneazle who got the cream.
Doom makes a motion to cast again, and just beyond his shoulder, Steve spies the orb on its pedestal, nearly forgotten in the fight.
how little I fear his arrival.”
Bobbi blinks. "And again, I say... so?"
“You went to—” Steve says, awed, before Tony cuts him off.
Giggling, they order the Taste of the Italy platter, and, while picking at too soft pasta slathered in inauthentic sauce, Tony talks a little more about himself, revealing a bit more about the man behind the machines.
," Tony repeats even more forcefully. He paces, setting his coffee mug down on a workbench. "Captain America... He was transformed with science. He's an achievement of biology, okay? Erskine was a geneticist. And he took Steve Rogers, and he used the serum to make Steve as strong on the outside as he was good on the inside. That's how the story goes. That's the power of
Steve thrusts his hand between the closing doors, tripping the sensor to reopen them (thank Merlin they work the same way the ones at Rhodes do), and he barrels in.
As Tony does so, the baskets of breadsticks on all the tables Angela was serving… begin to
He glances around the lobby trying to catch sight of the figure. The shine of brass details at the reception desk and light reflecting off chandeliers gives Steve momentary pause, but he finally sees the signature glints of light racing up one of the grand staircases, and then turning toward another stairwell.
But as luck would have it, the third year was the charm. Their number got pulled in the lottery for attendance to the Reunion Ceremony. Both Steve and Tony were ecstatic.
U untangles herself from DUM-E and, making herself smaller still, ascends to drape herself around Tony's shoulders, like a living scarf.
In that moment, Steve wants
Doom’s armor takes most of the impact from both blasts, but he’s knocked back, momentarily stunned by his attackers.
Tony is standing, his shackles at his feet, looking horrified. He attempts to close the distance to Steve, his lips forming Steve's name. Rhodey blocks him bodily, trying to guide him to the door.
Steve really, really hates this guy.
Steve drags his finger on the screen to the left, and the digital "page" obligingly flips over.
“...I’m still alive? Nope,” Tony says, popping the ‘p’.
“You said we were back in the field today,” he says, voice sounding thin and low, brittle with disappointment.
Stoner pivots and walks away without another word, leaving Steve stock still and fuming.
This is
“Steve,” Steve blurts out too quickly, forgetting his false name. He hangs on the single syllable, trying to recover. “...ens. Roger Stevens. But. Roger is fine.”
He has to be.
Yeah, Steve thinks, licking his lips and putting his phone away. Nomaj casual wear is pretty much the best.
someone. A few someones. I’ve got one more thing to show you.”
Tony raises a quizzical eyebrow. "Is there... something I
Over a dozen people are still blocking his view as the whales continue their lazy lap around, not quite having swum to where they are standing yet, and Tony is already mesmerized.
“Is there any chance there could be an Obscurial behind this?”
“Then why are
Still dazed, acting entirely on instinct, Steve uses a binding charm on Doom, tying his wrists and ankles with magic, and then follows it up with a little shoving spell, pushing the madman further away from them, just to be safe.
It only serves to underscore Tony’s point from earlier: the two worlds are too intertwined, and it’s no use pretending they’re not.
Bobbi sighs, then pulls the top few pages from the folder and performs a simple
"You are..." Steve laughs, shaking his head, still in disbelief at what he's just seen. "You're not like anyone I've ever met, you know that?"
Steve is grabbing up Tony's hands, then, looking him right in the eyes.
“—like to join me for dinner?” Steve finishes, a little more confident in his words this time, since he’s got a
“Well,
N-F-C stands for Near Field Communication, he's since learned, and more importantly, the nomaj device he was assigned is a mobile phone. It's a lot like a Two-Way Mirror, only with a battery and whole lot more tiny electronic bits inside, and together they let him get in touch with Tony at any time. He hasn't, of course, but just knowing that he could, just thinking about Tony picking up (why do nomajs say 'pick up'? You answer by pressing the button) and saying "hello?" all expectantly and sweetly sends a shiver up his spine.
"Hopefully better. Or no, not better, but at least adjusting more smoothly. I had a couple rocky starts."
want to… invite you over to, ah, spend some time…” He lets a hand coast over the back of his neck, which is also going hot as he struggles to finish the sentence.
“Those are… interesting names,” Steve comments, taking the mug. “Ah, thank you?” he offers the DUM-E, who actually coos. It’s incredibly sweet.
“No need to be scared, dummy,” Tony comforts the robot, making a coaxing gesture. “Come on out. And bring the cup.”
"You're coming with me," Steve informs him, holding him at wandpoint.
“What, bab—” Steve clears his throat, catches himself falling out of character. “What is it, Stark? What do you need?”
When the cab is completely gone from view, Steve starts to meander away from the most populated areas of the square, away from theatregoers and costumed mascots.
Written and drawn by Kirby Simonson.
“Good!” Tony exclaims. “That’s a good dummy!”
“What the wizard said,” Tony agrees with Sam. “Reed, whatever you’re doing, whatever he’s offered you, it’s not worth it. We can still get out of here, all of us, just wake that guy up, and—”
his bed, and... god, he's going to drive himself crazy that way. He needs a distraction.
all evil, he decides.)
Steve tries to keep his face neutral at that, as much as he wants to sneer. Wand scanners could be placed on the end of any standard issue wand and capture the scene before them. It was useful enough, true, Steve could admit that. But it gave way to this exact situation more often than not: aurors prematurely (in Steve’s opinion) destroying the state of a crime scene. Sure, hiding from nomajs was important, but a representation of evidence was never as good as the real thing.
According to the notes, it happened the previous night in Highbridge. Not terribly far from Sam’s apartment. Steve considers stopping by in a few days; hopefully Sam will be feeling better and the initial official investigation will be over.
"That of all the people that can communicate with these creatures, it's Vulcans."
This is very, very not good. Steve wants to curse himself for not coming to check on Sam sooner.
He could go home. But it's too early for bed, and besides, Steve is far too keyed up for sleep. He can only think of Tony, and now he's thinking about bed, and Tony
The whale song ducks out for a moment as a researcher makes an announcement on the loudspeaker. "Three minutes out, Dr. Prentiss."
"It's fine," Tony murmurs. "You're fine. He's not going to hurt you. Or me, or any of us."
“Gentlemen,” she says, grinning from ear to ear, more like she’s congratulating them than chastising them, “I’m afraid we’re going to have to ask you to leave.”
“G’night, Tony,” he mumbles, and the last thing he remembers before letting sleep embrace him is the pillow shaking with Steve’s laughter.
He read all about how important it was as soon as he was revived, in fact. He can practically still see passages from
Lower to the ground, near to the panels on the opposite side of the room, there's a rush of movement that grabs Tony's attention. For a second he thinks it might be whales, or Dr. Nu'val in the water, but he blinks and his eyes refocus in the half-light: it's definitely on this side of the transparent aluminum.
Having secured the very last sesame seed bagel, he’s on his way out when he runs into two fellow agents. Familiar faces—familiar as anyone is these days, anyway.
How could Steve have been so taken in? He thought he was in
It’s much longer than the first message, and even at a glance, almost certainly not from Tony.
Steve Rogers, auror, notes them briefly, squinting slightly at the bright spring sun, before asking Laleh at the stand for his usual.
Steve tenses—this could be it—
, as well as the ‘stuffing breadsticks in my purse’ meme.
Laleh retrieves Steve's items with a smile and hands them to him; he pays in galleons, and she doesn’t comment on his penchant for the print version of the periodical, or his use of cash; they’ve had that conversation many times already.
“Vibranium?” Steve recalls. “Rhodes mentioned it to me.”
my spellshield,” Steve whispers.
“Shit,” Rhodey curses, awed.
,” Tony clears his throat rather emphatically, “Ah, personal calling cards. With my personal information. In case you, uh, think of something you want to ask me. Off-hours. Or. Whenever.”
As sentient creatures, George and Gracie had every right to make their way to the open ocean after their interaction with the Probe; their reason for being transported in the first place had been fulfilled.
“I told you, it’s Rhodey,” Rhodes insists. “Look…”
Holding out his hand to Steve, he directs his wand to his empty palm, and in another flash, two business cards appear there. He hands one to Steve, who reads what’s printed on it:
"You loved that, didn't you?" Tony asks him, already knowing the answer.
Steve swallows. How can he respond this question?
The feel of the orb in his fist is familiar, bracing; it hums with power. A glow bursts forth from the fractured and refused artifact. It’s not quite Steve’s shield, with its balanced shape and elegant curves. It’s no more than a mass of pure spell energy, but it’s enough.
- The Bar With No Doors is, of course, where Dr Strange, Wanda, Brother Voodoo and all the canon magic users in 616 hang out.
“Not a wizard,” Tony agrees. “Still can’t cast a spell to save my life. We ran
What if he told Tony everything, right now? What if they
"It's not?" Tony asks brightly, sounding relieved. "Thank god. That would have been awkward, dating someone named
Tony presses a pattern into the side with the red and gold design, and the card expands, doubling in thickness, parts shifting into place, panels sliding open to reveal spinning rotors. The card—or robot, Steve supposes—lifts off Tony's hand and into the air, hovering around in a circular pattern like the baskets.
“...and not only was Rhodes International named a Fast500 Tech Innovator last year, but also—and maybe more importantly—it was selected as a SilverDoor 2016 ‘Best Place To Work’ award recipient. We’re incredibly proud that people love working here—any, uh, comment on that,
Steve sets the bag containing Sam’s soup on the curb and approaches the building’s facade. He closes his eyes and walks directly at the brick wall, hoping with all his might that he’s right, that this is a warding charm, and that he won’t simply bounce off, knocked back onto the pavement with nothing to show but a bruised forehead.
Steve wants... what Tony wants, too—
U shrieks and shrinks, making herself tiny again, floating down to safety in between the savagely sharp pieces. She’s spared the worst of the cuts, but doesn’t dare to grow again, seeming to fear injuring herself further. She slithers to a far corner of the room and tries to hide.
. And, lastly, it’s volatile when it meets up with matter—they cancel each other out, and leave pure energy behind.
"YOU! STOP!" Tony glances backward at the beast, and as Steve's haze of panic recedes, he noticing the animal has a beak, not the lizard-like snout of a hydra at all.

McBryde clears his throat and repeats himself. “I said—”
—the resemblance is uncanny, really.
what you are, Tony,” Doom counters. “No one else seems to, though—certainly not that thick-headed auror paramour of yours.” He crouches just in front of Tony. The metal facsimile of a mouth he wears is fixed in a grimace, but his voice pitches upward, signalling a hidden smile.
"Me too." His lips brush Tony's ear tenderly. "I love you."
There is a sea turtle passing by just then, but Tony is pretty sure that’s not what’s caught Steve’s attention. “Hey, what’s up?”
. I'd mix the right chemical compound, and suddenly it would glow! It was my special hobby, and I was
Tony smiles ruefully and wiggles his left hand—oh, the briefcase. Tony hadn’t put it down since they left the restaurant. Steve had nearly forgotten.
But most shockingly of all, his skin begins to shrivel and crack, his face twisting into some of the most horrific patterns of scarring Steve has ever seen. Patches of his hair fall out, floating to the ground, and his nose recedes, leaving a jagged peak of torn skin and cartilage around a gaping hole.
“Thank you for coming to save me. I was worried if you did, Doom would try to use your power to turn you into a bomb. In a way, I almost hoped you wouldn’t try to come for me.” He looks back up at Steve warmly. “But you did anyway.”
“RI has been prototyping with this new material—”
He approaches to the door to Tony’s office, and is about to use his voice code to unlock the security panel, when the door swings open. Steve smiles, thinking he’ll see one of the bots, but a man with slicked back dark hair storms out, muttering to himself. Steve’s seen him in the hall with Sam a few times, the guy from the Biology department—
"What?"
Steve references the folded copy of the report Bobbi gave him. An older gentleman had lived here—a classical portkey craftsman. No one could confirm whether he had been caught up in the blast or not—there was no trace of him to be found afterward, no bones, teeth, wand core, anything. But given that no one had seen him in several days, it was assumed that perhaps he was; the explosion had been so violent, perhaps he was completely disintegrated.
"Please," Tony grits out in response, his voice a little higher than he expected. He opens his eyes, but doesn't even try to focus on anything.
Dr. Prentiss launches into an introductory speech, with some basic facts about the whales and how they came to be here.
charm.
"Auror's Bureau," Sam says aloud, triggering the AE—auto-enchantment.
"TO ME, MY BREADSTICKS!" he calls, with enough volume and intensity for enough for their server to overhear. "ALA-KAZAM!"
“TONY!” Steve screams. “
"I'm sorry," Tony sighs, not sounding the least bit sorry at all. "You just... you have no idea...how much I would have
Elevators used to have goblin attendants, Steve remembers as they zoom past floor after floor in silence—well, silence except for the sound of Sam chewing.
"Hm, what?" the ghost asks, floating over the table. "Oh, hey, Rogers, Morse. Didn't even see you there."
He looks through Scott’s translucent form to regard the large clock against the far wall; he should probably get ready for his day soon. If he’s lucky, maybe he’ll catch Danvers or Whitman before he has to head out to RI. They’ll probably have good non-magical date ideas they can share with him.
Neither Steve nor Tony looks away from the mammoth creatures directly in front of them. But Tony reaches out two exploratory fingers in the general direction of Steve's hands. Steve clasps his whole hand in response.
,” Tony says, his tone impish, “I can tell you’re just
"No, I'd like to, eventually... Just maybe not tonight. But as far as being sheltered from... well," he points to the restaurant around them, "
“Would you like—” Tony starts.
"Oh, yes." Because of course, Steve has read up on it, remembers it all, and can hold a coherent conversation about it. Which in turn allows Tony to regain his composure in peace, all while watching Steve dazzle one of the earth's foremost marine biologists, armed with quotes from her own paper on male humpback mating displays and his hyperwatt smile. (Okay, maybe 'evil' was a strong word choice.)
“You are perfectly positioned at the intersection of technology and magic, and possess a superior mind, capable of unlocking their combined power. Rogers and I may be from the same time, but he chooses to remain in the past, while I have always looked toward the future.”
"What?" Tony looks back and forth between the hologram and Steve, until Steve's meaning dawns on him. "Oh, I hadn't even thought of that. I was going for sort of a... phoenix color scheme, you know?"
Apparently, though, some traces remained in this one soldier's vivid imagination, and made it out onto the page.
"Hmm, the words are still wrong," Tony muses, munching on his breadstick ‘wand.’ "Not the right... incantation, per se. But the effect was good, no?"
Finally, just before that “stupid ratty chapeau” (Tony’s words) could give away Tony’s secret, Tony announced that he was bored with school and made a rather grand and dramatic exit by attaching tiny rockets to roller skates he wore, concealed under his robes, and shot out of the Great Hall at lightning speed, much to the astonishment all staff and students present.
- From
“Everything’s fine,” he argues, sitting back down, seemingly done causing a ruckus after having embarrassed his son in front of all the surrounding tables. “Can we get some more pop and breadsticks already?
more fun than your pal and Richards.”
Steve crawls to Tony, grasping the wand. Tony lifts his hand off of Doom’s person.
"Oh," Tony glances upward in thought as the drone hovers back down to his outstretched hand. "No... I mean, I highly doubt it. That guy seemed more like a blowhard than anything. He was pretty embarrassed. I bet he'll mostly just want to forget that this ever happened." Tony pockets the drone and beams at Steve again.
“Anytime,” Scott assures him, with a little wave. “It’s fun to to hear about love lives that aren’t DOA. Happy to be your Ghost Host.”
the first message reads.
Kyle shakes his head.
But regardless of the circumstances, Steve thought of Southern Italy often, dreaming of what it must have been like in summer, in peacetime. Olive groves covered most of the region; they were the crop the area was known for, and even after all these years, Steve dreamt up fantasies of the sun beating down on the olive trees growing up and down the hillsides of Campania.
They came. The whales came back again.
” Doom curses Steve again, red sparks flying. The pain is agonizing, but Steve bears it—at least Doom is still focused on him and him alone.
While Steve is freeing the nomajs, Doom lets loose another curse. “
real, and I need to know something right now.”
Tony probably thinks Steve is some pure-blood fanatic now after the way he acted.
Sam sighs, scraping a hand over his face. “Woke up late today, haven’t even had breakfast.”
The nightmares are all but gone now, and the therapist he started seeing last year has truly helped him more than he thought possible, but sometimes he still has to perform a little mental gymnastics to keep his mind eye's from winding through imaginary cave systems and seeing the glint of battery leads in the darkness. Especially at moments like this.
The voice doesn't have an accent, like Doom's did—but that's not what's throwing Steve for a loop.

Another woman in an embroidered Olive Garden uniform shirt approaches them—probably a supervisor of some kind?
Tony relinquishes Steve's hand and bends down in his seat, only to pop back up with something on his lap: a briefcase of some kind. Steve had noticed Tony carrying it in passing when they arrived, but had forgotten about while he was, well, drowning in shame.
It sighs at them. Steve and Sam look at one another, and they board the elevator.
A section of the glass retracts, and Doom shoves Sam forward, into the chamber. Before the dazed and bloodied wizard can react, the glass reseals itself, locking him in. The incarcerous charm that bound him falls away. He bangs on the glass, yelling, to no avail.
"That's good, Commander," Steve praises him in a deep register. "Very good."
“The Vambraces of Erskinus,” Doom announces. “Or least, what’s left of them. One of the most powerful artifacts ever created, capable of channeling untold amounts of magic. I’ve used several conduits over the course of my trials, but this one could be the key to my success. I suppose the good
"It was a spellshield," Steve says, a little sheepishly, afraid of disappointing Tony, dashing still more dreams about his childhood idol. "It only worked with a magical artifact—the Vambraces of Erskinus—and those were destroyed."
To his right is the door to the stairwell.
“I think,” Tony grins, “you’re about to find out.”
“Is… everything okay?” Steve asks, trying push past his apprehension.
Tony walks around to stand beside Steve as he inspects the image. "Yeah," he agrees. "You and he kinda look the same. I noticed that, too. I, uh," he crooks an eyebrow, hesitating. "I might have a type."
are.”
Time slows down, almost like it did in the hydra cave all those years ago. But he won’t wake up this time in a world he doesn’t know, and that’s fine, he thinks. Tony wouldn’t be there in the future to greet him, so it’s okay if this is the end.
The same kind he gave to the waitress.
“Listen,” Rhodes continues. “I told him not to get involved with you magic folks again—I sure as hell don’t want to. I didn’t even want to be in this W.A.N.D.D. thing he suggested we apply for.”
"Tony," he calls, "Tony, I'm—"
As the light ascends, casting a wider glow over everything in the room, Steve can make out the man’s profile as he works.
bigger than a shovel."
that when I—You thought I was—" He lets off another peel of hysterical laughter.
“Here,” he shoves the unicorn toy at her dismissively, “Throw this out.”
The spell snaps out toward Steve, with a burst of red light and a sharp whip-like crack.
“I need you to fill me up with your come,” he says as steadily as he’s able to. “Captain.”
Steve apparates directly back to Tony’s lab, pacing back and forth the second he’s fully corporeal again. He reads Doom’s message over and over, trying to think of what to do next.
funny, Cerrera!"
“Say goodnight, Tony.”
“Absolutely, Mister Rhodes,” Steve chimes in, trying to look engaged.
“LAB TIME!” he calls out as he stalks out of the room. “PREPARE TO BE AMAZED!”
Steve narrows his eyes warily. He’s seen a bouncing shield before, in some of the
Steve checks the time on his phone (he’s actually getting sort of used to that motion now); 5:27pm. Hopefully Tony hasn’t left for the day.
to judge us?”
Steve's been on the W.A.N.D.D. assignment for three weeks now, seeing Tony nearly every day, and they've settled into a comfortable routine. Tony's bots make him tea, Tony waxes philosophical about technology, Steve resolves to ask Tony out… and then the work day ends, and Steve goes home alone.
Doom crosses to the corner where Sam is captured. Sam begins struggling anew, but he makes no progress.
Tony kisses him softly, slowly, as if reassuring Steve that he’s still alive, and still himself; Steve wants to melt into Tony’s embrace, to hold onto him and never let go.
He nods courteously in their direction, and they smile back. “Avery. McBryde. Good to see you.”
Tony’s not a wizard after all.
"Oh," Steve says, barely suppressing said shiver, "we click. There's definite... clicking."
"Come on, Steve. Say you'll avenge with me. Please?"
you down, you murdering piece of—”
—hopefully you do—” Tony gives a manic little laugh, “because you’re asking me—but I
Bobbi rolls her eyes exaggeratedly. “Whoever this person you’re making moon-eyes over is, Rogers.”
"I've never seen one before," Steve says quietly, radiating a childlike wonder. "Not in person. I saw a dolphin just off Coney Island once, but...this is something else."
," Steve chides him.
"We were just talking about mating behaviors," Steve explains. "Of the humpbacks."
“Not a one-of-those either, apparently.” Tony bites his lip. “I seem to be… something else. Maybe something
“So, the armor,” Steve asks. “You’re using it in your investigations? What’ve you found so far, about the explosions?”
“SHUT UP,” Doom tries to order him. “You think I’m afraid of Rogers?”
A shadow falls over Tony's expression. "What are you—? You hadn't even
The circle has a beautiful red and gold geometric pattern etched into one side, and the other appears to be blank… until you move it, and it catches the light, which reveals text that just says ‘hi there.’
Steve’s caution proves to be well-founded; the room begins to shake again. Sure enough, it sounds like the opposite wall is shifting this time. Steve uses the covering noise of the room reshaping to shut his own door behind him.
"I'm not working for anyone, okay?" Tony insists. "Just myself. And I'm not a wizard. I'm not magical at all."
But Steve is surprised at what he sees when he crosses the threshold of the illusory building. The figure is... running. Just running.
"So who are you—"
“—decode it?” Steve finishes for him. “Not yet, but I have an idea what the key might be.”
open, the way a nomaj one would. Steve might not have noticed if he hadn’t been spending so much time around mechanical engineers, but now the strangeness of it is obvious to him.
Steve cranes his neck back in surprise. The nomaj police force? What does any of this have to do with them?
Steve scowls playfully and leans forward on his broom, preparing to give chase. Tony’s not going to get away from him that easily.
“No,” Brand says grimly, frowning, as her hair turns a fiery red and orange color, clearly thinking of her own nomaj dating horror story. “But
What could Tony possibly have to be nervous about now?
“We’re a pretty good team, you and I,” Steve sighs happily.
Bobbi turns back to Steve, closing the investigation folder and gathering up her things. “I have to go, Steve. Good luck with your date, okay?”
Tony is wearing a more casual style of button down today, opened to reveal the heather gray A-shirt underneath; it hugs his lean body in a  completely different way than his carefully tailored business casual outfits usually do. Steve’s mouth goes dry, and he has to tear his eyes away from the hint of Tony’s bare arms peeping out from the shirt seam—he has to focus enough to get through the invitation first.
As he twists his wand in the air, preparing to disappear from the lab as he was told to do, Steve is hit with the uncomfortable sensation of all the air leaving his lungs—and he knows it’s not just the feeling of disapparating affecting him.
“You know what else is magic?” he asks.
“I guess I am,” Tony fires back.
Steve feels the muscles of his neck clench, and he makes a fist involuntarily. How could anyone be that cruel?
Tony begins his descent to a large landing area built off the eastern side of the building, a beautiful curved balcony, twenty by thirty feet. It leads directly into the main robotics lab on the 118th floor. Tony had showed off some of RI’s larger military drones there last week. Steve had thought they were wonderful: broomless flight! How innovative!
Steve manages to sit up and debrief the other aurors on the situation, and warns them about Doom’s abilities as he’s taken into custody.
Steve sighs and drags his eyes up from the plain white tablecloth to look at Tony. Tony, who probably thinks Steve is the biggest idiot he's ever met. Tony, who'll probably never speak to him apart from business details again. Tony, who...
But he had never known anyone who went to the oldest, and maybe the best, wizarding school in existence. The school where Merlin himself was trained.
"Thanks." A smile returns to Tony's face. "So, what do you like to do for—"
"...Going up?" Sam asks it eventually.
“We don’t have to.”
Steve see the muscles of Doom's neck tense. He throws his head back in pain, and as he does, Reed stirs, releasing an anguished cry. Tony twists back and forth helplessly, watching both of them howl.
“No,” Tony corrects Steve joyfully. “That’s a Jan.”
"Touché," Tony concedes. "Still, I wonder about the pressure of it all. Does it bother them? Are they aware of it? I know they were already starting a family—a pod?—before they came here. But being the progenitors of a species seems... kind of intense."
At least he's not here to hear this conversation and make fun of Steve for it.
"A fizzer?" Tony tries again. "That's an old, old word for it—I don't know anyone who uses that one anymore."
Tony holds up a finger to her. “One second.”
Tony stammers, tries to pull away from Steve. "Never mind, I didn't—I—"
As Steve holds court on "fluke markings" and "spyhopping" and a bunch of other terminology he doesn't really follow, Tony lets himself drop away mentally from the conversation and just takes Steve in.
were female Russian aviators in world war II.
different for Tony, he thinks to himself. If a nomaj found out about Steve’s abilities, they might lock him up—or worse. It’s happened before. Magic has been kept secret for a reason.
What is going on here?
," Steve insists. "I was so concerned about catching the killer, and I didn't think—I
Steve raises an eyebrow, and Tony knows that must sound like an odd introduction. He's got nothing against Vulcans. "I'm sure they do an amazing job conveying facts and medical information. But I suspect there's something lost in the translation. I mean..." He points again to the sea, indicating the whales that are soon to arrive. "What do you think they're feeling?"
“I,” he quotes Tony’s frequent promise back to him, “can work with that.”
Steve doesn’t really blame her for not remembering him; she’s fresh out of academy training and has met a lot of new people in the past few weeks. And it’s not as though he’s been particularly social as of late, either. Not to mention, not everyone has his unusually precise memory—half the soldiers in his old unit didn’t refer to him as the ‘walking pensieve’ for nothing.
, my legendary hero of a boyfriend, gets here and wipes the floor with you—”
,” he says more softly, his pitch rising up and then dropping suggestively low on that last syllable, causing something warm to coil in Steve’s belly.
“They’ll be here in a half hour,” Tony explains. “When the meeting officially starts. I thought we might want a minute… you know, alone.”
“We have to go,” Brand drops a folder on their table in front of Bobbi, labelled STARBURST. “There’s been another one.” She sighs. “They think someone might have been caught up in thethis blast this time.”
But in the moment, Tony's dark blue eyes are crystalline, shimmering with joy, and his hand is soft and warm, holding fast to Steve's. It's impossible to believe Tony is being anything but completely earnest, and the knot that twisted up in Steve's stomach upon their arrival at this zoo of a restaurant begins to unwind slightly.
didn’t represent a whole country. He didn’t even represent all the
“I am now,” he tells Rhodes.
From his jacket, he pulls out a little grey electronic device with a glowing screen, not unlike the one the one the Bureau equipped him and Sam with for this assignment, only Rhodes’ is smaller and sleeker. He thumbs it a few times and pockets it again.
"Are you still... involved? In the magical world?"
It—or she, Steve supposes—lowers her head into Tony's outstretched hands, and makes a cooing sound, closing her eyes in tender moment of trust.
Either Sam’s not at home—he wasn’t even in good enough shape to walk, let alone fly or apparate, the last time Steve saw him—or he’s in a state where he can’t come to the door.
The kiss starts slow, but builds in intensity, both of them wanting more than either can give tonight. Tony catches Steve's lower lip between his teeth and tugs gently, making a devastating little humming sound as he does so. Steve's belly gives a little flutter, like it's full of Cornish pixies.
Tony chuckles softly. "It's kind of funny, if you think about it."
"Bingo," Tony confirms. "Check out the amateur magizoologist. HEY, DUM!"
“I will,” he tells her. “Cross my heart and hope to—”
“You’re on,” Steve returns.
,” he says the title like he’s snarling behind the mask, “may have mentioned them to you. But he’s not worthy of them.”
"No," Steve says finally. "Not at all. And you have to—"
Doom sheathes his wand in the folds of his folds of his cloak, then extends his hand further into the fabric—it doesn’t so much as ripple as his hand disappears beneath it; perhaps he’s using an extension charm on the garment; Steve shudders to think of what else Doom might be hiding.
“Did you feel that? The rumbling.” Sam asks. “I think we have company.”
He said Roger. Not
How can it be?
“—YES,” Tony cuts him off. “Sorry,” he adds brightly. “Was that too much? It was too much. Please, finish. I’ve only been waiting three weeks; I can hold out until the end of your sentence.”
Steve feels something in his chest twist.
The boy—Kyle, Steve assumes—shakes his head furiously, almost nonsensically, as if it’s a habit, a learned response dissociated from his dad’s words. His is gaze still trained down towards his hands, now fidgeting nervously in his lap. He’s clearly heard this all before and doesn’t want to risk disagreeing with his father again.
,” Sam says. He surveys Steve’s injuries and calls over some mediwizards, who start the application of anti-shock charms and healing potions; Steve begins to feel better immediately.
Steve sets off at a sprint, chasing them in earnest now.
Steve looks around the room, not really seeing, trying to come up with a solution—when he glimpses Tony’s RI logo mug from before.
“Unfortunately, I still have no idea what caused it,” Tony sums up his findings glumly, banishing the pictures and other files from the holoscreen with a wave of his hand. “I’ve never seen this kind of magic before.”
,” Tony smiles sweetly, “one microbiologist in particular.”
- Re: steve’s wands, Sycamore wands are known for being fickle and becoming bored—probably a bad choice for a young wizard, in addition to all the problems one might have with a hand-me-down wand that didn’t “choose” them. Alder wands are well suited to wordless magic, which I feel might be the next best thing for Steve in lieu entirely wandless magic. Both Alder and Sycamore are native to Ireland.
Steve takes a deep breath.
A smug smile spreads across Tony’s face. “You’ve been spying on me for
Steve hasn’t heard of that type of magical creature before. “Like… a djinn?”
, good.” Tony says cheerily. “Can’t wait. But first…”
with me,” Tony informs him.
"No one," Tony tells him. "Look in the corner."
Steve didn’t trust Tony’s instincts about other people, didn’t think he had a claim to his own place in the wizarding community. Did that make him just as bad those wizards who ridiculed his mom? Or the ones who made Tony feel ashamed for not being able to do magic?
Steve moans low like he always does when he’s about to come. Tony bears down on him with everything he’s got.
They walk as fast as they can without running, for about a block, evading the green glow of the restaurant’s multiple neon signs, and the lingering gazes of the patrons through the glass windows.
Steve’s heart skips a beat—has Tony forgiven him? He doesn’t deserve it, not yet—he really has to apologize first—but if Tony wanted to reach out to him first, he certainly wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to make amends.
"Anyway, I can only imagine they try not to think about that part of it," Steve continues. "It's probably just nice to be alive and not have to worry about being held captive, or hunted."
Tony turns back, looking quizzically at Steve. "Hmm?"
“Uh-huh?”
“He doesn’t
They both collapse on the bed, exhausted. Mere moments pass before strong arms yank Tony in, and he finds his face pressed into a sweat-sheened pec muscle that guards a rapidly beating heart.
“Steve, this is my team,” Tony introduces proudly. “Tony Stark and the Super Stark Friends.”
Rhodes returns to smiling politely and munching on pasta for long seconds, before mumbling under his breath: "Besides. A guy like me? Whole military technology company at his disposal? I'd use something
“Hold,” Steve orders him. “We have to know what he’s planning. We have to know what we’re up against.”
Tony opens his mouth to protest, and yawns a second time, all his energy suddenly just gone. So many emotions, so close to the surface, that’d do the trick. That, and, as Steve said, ‘the other parts’; he’s not a new Academy grad anymore after all.
He crouches down to inspect them—it's hard to make them out in the debris of the blast. But, gently brushing a bit of rubble away with his fingers, he notes the individual glyphs. In fact, he recognizes them as Ogham—Ancient Irish.
Tony Cererra gives Steve a sad half-smile.
This is an important job, he attempts to convince himself. It
Steve looks down at Tony. He takes a deep breath in, and Tony’s stomach clenches. “I was wondering if we could talk about… the thing you brought up earlier tonight. About us, starting a ‘pod’.”
Tony emerges triumphantly, holding up… a broom. Not some push broom for sweeping the lab floor: a proper racing broom.
Good thing they both care so much about Tony.
Steve pulls out his wand to scan the runes when he hears a shuffling behind him.
“Tony!” he shouts, starting to stand all the way up. If there was more light in the room, their feet would be exposed.
pretty proud of it, anyway. C’mon,” he smiles even wider and tips his head toward the bank of elevators at the end of the hall. “We’re gonna have
Behind him, Tony hears a choked off little noise and feels Steve’s hips hitch up.
Steve talks about travel and combat, trying to sub in places he knows W.A.N.D.D. (and hopefully, the nomaj military) is stationed now for locations he fought on the European front, and when Tony asks him if the time in France and Germany Steve mentioned was part of a college program, Steve hastily agrees and lets Tony’s able mind fill in the gaps.
Tony raises his eyebrows, his mouth a soft "O" as realization dawns on him.
” Steve cues Rhodey.
Steve feels his fists clench. A school, where young wizards still attended class in the summer. Could it be happening again? That kind of oppression? In this era? For all that he's not fond of being in the future, Steve had come think of modern nomajs as more tolerant—and that wizards had become better about finding and helping their own kind. Maybe he was mistaken.
seen in his life, was definitely not what Steve assumed he would be getting.
Fortunately, Captain Spock had already formed something of a bond with the animals, and began to liaise with them. He wasn't entirely able to make the concept of genetic diversity clear to them, but they agreed more whales was a good thing, and they were open to the idea of continued medical care.
fight. Can someone break up with you after only one date?
“Steve, god, are you okay?” Tony starts to reach for Steve’s injuries, the hesitates. His gaze darts around, he tries to find something to staunches the bleeding on Steve’s stomach and shoulder. “We’ll get you some help—hold on, okay?”
“Don’t you
But here Tony was, laughing so hard tears were streaming down his face, like he was glad to have someone to tell the story to after all these years. Steve was more than happy to be that person—he’d like to continue to be that person for Tony, for as long as Tony would let him.
“I have no idea,” Tony tells him, getting the general idea of Steve’s question, and apparently having no better answer. He shakes his head, baffled. “Uh.
"I'm... mostly over it, I think," Tony reassures Steve. "I mean, my family was well off, and I’ve done okay for myself. Only one real regret, to be honest. I didn't get to do the one thing I wanted to more than anything."
alone. He has Sam, and Bobbi, and everyone else at MACUSA—if only Steve would let them in.
They burst out laughing, heads thrown back, unable to contain themselves any longer. They laugh long and loud, and it leaves Steve breathless and teary with absolute joy for the first time since he woke up.
“Agent Brand,” Steve nods.
—drop him an owl and check in on him.
“Floor 178. Mister Rhodes is waiting for you.”
Under a swooping arc, the line of flight made by some kind of magical bird, it looks like, is the word—or rather, the name—in all capital letters:
is. What if Doom survived the blast, too?
He runs a finger over the scratched rune. It’s shaky, erratically and hastily carved.
Steve's still caught up in his thoughts of the whales, it looks like. Good. Tony nods mildly and takes a deep breath. He's good at redirection. No need to bring the mood down. Not tonight.
Tony goes on about his friends, and Steve can barely process what he’s hearing. He had no idea Tony had been working on the investigation with other people. He doesn’t know why it surprises him so much, that Tony would have friends—other magical friends at that—but he can’t shake the surge of jealousy spiking within him. He thought what he had Tony had was special, unique.
“No—I meant—” Steve makes a fist, feeling his stomach do a flip flop as he tries to explain himself.
the various terms for non-magical children of wizards; none of them come close to describing how special Tony is.
—" Steve frowns. "I reminded you—"
Sam blinks.“Englehart’s?” he asks.
“Yes,” Steve answers, hoping that’s what Tony wanted to hear.
Tony’s hair’s a little more dishevelled than normal, and there’s a grease stain on his cheek—Steve’s fingers twitch as he thinks about reaching out to gently wipe it away.
Steve uses his fingers to push the picture around. It can't be more than simple luck, he thinks, until he pans to the left and sees... Bucky.
U gives a little yawn before tucking in her beak and her single wing, forming a perfect little loop with her body, and preparing to nod off.
“That’s… it? That was your elaborate cover? Really?” Tony chuckles. “Your parents were big Captain America fans, huh? Didn’t know wizards knew about him. Was one of them a muggle—er, sorry, nomaj?”
is immediate, enveloping the entire elevator car, and shooting it up to the top floor at an alarming speed.
