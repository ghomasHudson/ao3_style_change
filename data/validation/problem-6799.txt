… Tony wanted to say, million other sentences trapped behind his lips waiting to be let out, words of pleas, to beg the Alpha in front of him to tell him that his baby was alive, that he wasn't dead like everyone always ended up saying, words of hate and rage, at how cruel the world was to take his only babe away from the safe heaven that Tony provided, words of betrayal, for how his father was so weak that he let Stane manipulate him how he wanted, how no matter what good intentions the Alpha had for his son, he always goes at it the wrong way, how it had been a year and a half since the Alpha gave up on being able to mend his relationship with Tony, and end up running away to Malibu to deal with his heartbreak there, not calling Tony anymore after being rejected by him again and again…
There was a monster in the lake; a monster that saved him a month ago, a monster that healed him, a monster that made sure his baby was good and that she wasn't hurt… there was a monster in the lake… surprisingly though, hearing that didn't cause Tony to scream bloody murder, it didn't cause Tony to feel scared, it didn't make him pack all of his shit and book it out of this strange town. There was a monster in the lake, but for the first time in his life, Tony felt safe.
"What's that?" Peter asked when his mother seat on the bed, the boy leaned on his mother to see the picture in his mother's hand; Steve smiled a little and adjusts himself until he was leaning on the headboard with Peter sitting in his lap.
"I appreciate what you're doing, but at this rate, it might take another year before we're both finally naked…" Tony groan and gingerly moved Steve off of him in order to stand to undress, causing Steve to whistle at the exposed flesh which made Tony grin; it had been months since the two of them truly enjoyed themselves.
"Can you tell me the name of his lawyer?" Peggy asked which got her a comforting smile from the Omega as the man told her the name, which made her curse internally, considering that she knew for sure that 'Chester Philips' has died nine years ago in a car accident… "Do you know… if Dr. Erskine left any message of any kind?" Peggy asked, getting desperate for any clue, hoping that she will at least find something that will help her stop Hydra.
"Yes, totally! We are going to introduce you to the wonder that's the shawarma; you are so going to thank me after taking one bite!" Tony grin playfully at the end of his speech causing a chuckle to leave Steve, the faint light twinkling, informing Tony that Steve was very happy, which made Tony relax, a slow smile stretching his lips as he gazes at Steve. Tony doesn't know why, but gazing at Steve at this moment made him tilt his head thoughtfully…
When breakfast was done, Howard watched as Peter jumped out of the chair, telling everyone that he was going to his grandma to tell her about his new grandpa, which did nothing but make Tony and Steve laugh; Howard on the other hand was feeling quite embarrassed, for he had never thought that it will be a big deal being bestowed with that title. "I will go with him, knowing Peter who will go to Bucky first so the two of them can roughhouse together…" Steve said as he stood up, taking his and his son's plates with him to the sink, and coming back to give Tony a kiss on the cheek; before the Alpha was gone though, Howard saw the knowing smile send his way, and it made him wonder if the Alpha did this on purpose, making his son go to his grandma's house so he will follow him, leaving Tony and Howard alone.
So after kissing his son and telling him that he will be back soon, he left the young boy with his aunt (Thank God for Pepper or he would have run around the house screaming like a headless chicken) Tony was off to go with his team to fight Hydra, grimacing to himself when he saw Wanda in the mix, he got used to the woman planning their doom, always accusing them of killing her brother, when in fact her brother decided to join them and protect innocent lives sacrificing himself for that honorable cause.
Reaching Peter's room, Steve took a deep breath as he prepared to go inside the room; he took a deep breath and pasted a smile on his face hoping that no one will know how broken and hurt he was inside. "I'm sorry…" Steve heard when he tried to open the door, and for a second he thought that it was him who said these words aloud, these words that have been running inside of his mind for years.
So Tony could say that Rogers was not only weird but dangerous as hell, and he even begged Fury to take him back after the cat accident, but the man refused, saying something about Rogers needing 'Familiar faces' so that he will be able to 'recover'… though Tony knew that secretly Fury was afraid of Rogers, that's why he doesn't want him in S.H.I.E.L.D, or any where near it… so now Tony was stuck with Rogers as a 'Forever Here' guest, but that didn't mean he didn't scream at Rogers. He screamed at the man for what he did to his gardens, and the dead animals that were buried in his backyard… he doesn't want a Pet Cemetery in his house, the horror of dealing with that cat was enough…
Steve returned early today, planning on cheering Tony a little, he knows that the Omega wasn't doing well, not since last night, not since he saw the comics, the comics that the Alpha tried so hard to keep out of the Omega's way, comics that he always told his son to put in his room, but as it seems, his son didn't always listen, it wasn't that Steve didn't want the Omega to see his work, he knows that the names he used for his comic will make the Omega go crazy, probably do something rush too, that may as well have been part of the reason why he decided to return home earlier today, with a heavy heart, his mind was running around in circles, wondering what the Omega will do, wondering if he would…
So my updating schedule is pretty messed up, maybe, probably, I don't know but it's a possibility I wouldn't update any chapter of my marvel stories this week… though I will answer your comments if this helps.
"God, you are so cruel, is this a way to treat your husband? At least make yourself useful and go make breakfast before latching into me!" Tony pouted, his words causing Steve to let another laugh and nuzzle Tony's cheek, probably rolling his eyes at the way Tony was acting like five years old; Tony couldn't help it though, not when he was still high on his mate's scent and their still fresh bond.
"The Winter Soldier… who is he?" Peggy finally asked which made Steven give a small and pained smile which made the woman's eyes widen a little then returned to their size as her theory was confirm by Steven, even if it was not verbally. "You want a press conference, right? How big?" Peggy asked already planning a counter-attack if anything unpleasant happens.
"Does James share the same sentiment as you?" Anton raised his brow, decided to go and retrieve his clothes, the chance of taking a bath has long since gone without return, leaving Anton grumbling in his place; Anton just had to post point his bath until another time, when noisy Omegas weren't there to annoy him.
That night an explosion rocked SI injuring lots and lots of people, but Steve was fast, with the help of Shield agents, they were able to save everyone, unfortunately, the person who was responsible for this was able to escape, that misstep that happened because of one of the newbies made Steve and Peggy go to plan B which was declaring the Starks and Peggy's deaths…
"Looking for Steve…" Tony whispered, already feeling uncomfortable at the million eyes that were gazing at him like he was an animal in a zoo. He swallowed his whimpers, his need to find Steve increased drastically. He needed to find the Alpha, and he needed to do it now, and even if the Alpha was still angry or mad at him, the Omega would take it, it was better than being put on the spot like this.
He was dying, Tony knew he was, the thing that kept him alive was slowly poisoning him, he knew that after six months of him being back, Stane was finally dead and his father was forced to do what Tony wanted if he didn't want a scandal to happen, Tony turned into Iron Man caused SI's stock to rise, which was probably the reason why his father was that docile, or probably it was because Tony lunch his first invention after the weapon manufacturing stopped, a robotic limb that was the perfect replacement, but even with all of his intelligent, Tony couldn't find a replacement core that wouldn't poison him.
At least Tony hoped the town's people didn't do something stupid like selling his house, not when he was sure he left a letter to Peggy telling her about him returning back when the time right. And the time was finally right for him to return to his home.
"W-well, y-you see… I…" Tony stuttered, his eyes glancing around wildly as he tried to find a way out of this; oh my God, he was going to die, he was going to die by the hands of his friends just because he had the unwanted affection of a crazy Addams, oh why God? Why?!
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, darkness, horror elements, creepiness, torture; Steve is so in love, and finally the date is here! And we will meet surprising characters! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Steve, was told everything that happened after the crash… how much time passed since then how they are now in the year of 1988, how his friends were alive, back here home… with families and children… and grandchildren to look after, he was told about how Peggy had finally found her fated mate, a Beta woman with the name Angie, he was told that Howard was finally married with a wife and a… Peggy didn't finish her sentences… Steve didn't pressure her. And he was told that they… that they had finally found Bucky's body… that thirty years ago they found him and return his body to give it a probable burial… that if Steve wants, she could take him to see Bucky…
But something, something that Tony didn't know what held his tongue. It was a few seconds later that Tony remembered; he remembered the pained words Steve stated when they were in the Avengers tower, about how he lost his glow because he fell in love with someone.
"Please, Tony! You are wasting your life, weren't you the one who always talked about wanting to be recognized, this child is going to ruin your life." Howard plea with him, making Tony sigh and wipe his mouth, looking at his father with such a disappointment look that made Howard swallow and look at his son's tired eyes.
"Come out; come out, where ever you are Addams! We need to talk." Tony called out as he walks deeper into the room, wondering how big the room really was that Tony felt like he was walking for minutes but didn't reach the other side of the room, which was concerning.
… left unsaid as Steve continued to pack his bags, putting the clothes he needs in his bag while continuing to go back and forth between his stuff and his baby's.
Steve looked at him like the sun shining out of his ass, and Tony could only groan, why? Just why does the universe hate him? "A date!" Steve peeped happily, gazing at Tony with too much cheerfulness to be natural. "I will stop terrorizing everyone in the mansion if you agree on going on a one date me." Tony raised his eyebrow, and he had to give it to Steve, the crazy Addams knows how to make a deal, but that's not a surprise considering that he most likely deal with the devil on a daily basis.
"Unfortunately yes, everyone is worried sick about you, and it will be really bad if Tony and I hide you here, the police may even get involved." That caused Harley to choke a whimper and hold tightly into Steve's shirt, the action causing Steve to hum gently trying to calm the boy, kissing his forehead and pulling him away, to gaze at his brown eyes. "But don't worry sweetie; you are only staying there until Tony and I finalize the adoption, hopefully, it wouldn't take long." Steve couldn't help but smile at the wide-eyed look Harley send his way…
Steve smiled at the Omega, lowering himself to whisper the name in Tony's ear, which caused the Omega's eyes to widen and for him to let out a happy sob, throwing himself in Steve's arms as he shook, his tears that he desperately held into start sliding down his face, but he took comfort in the way his Alpha held him in his arms and start rocking him gently. "You are an amazing Mom, Tony, never think otherwise." Steve whispered in the Omega's ears getting a choked sob from the said Omega as he nodded his head, it was a few minutes later that Tony returned to the album, drying his tears as he starts going through the pictures.
"Oh? Why don't you tell me his name? Maybe it's someone I know." Tony said with a grin which made the kid lights up at that and look around the place before signing for Tony to lean down even more like he was telling a secret, Tony grin widely at that and lean down, only for the pup to jump and squeak when someone called his name from behind Tony, which also scared the Alpha a little.
Tears started trickling down Steve's face as he hides his face in his knees hugging himself tightly, his heart, it felt like someone was squeezing it, he felt like the burden of the world was left on his shoulders, and Steve had been struggling to carry, ever since he discovered that he was pregnant… no before that, when he met Anthony for the first time, Steve should have known that he will end up here, crying his heart and wishing death because he couldn't do this anymore… he couldn't see his baby suffering anymore, he couldn't work, work, and work for hours, before his son woke up to him coming home hours after his baby fell asleep, only seeing his child one day in the week, he was tired of pinning after an Alpha that broke his heart over and over again, killing his best friend and brother, and breaking his child's fragile heart, he was tired of seeing May and Ben forcing themselves to help them when the two of them deserve to live their own lives without a needy Omega forcing their hands to take care of his child… he was so tired…
The first time Steve opened his eyes, he saw that he was in a room, not a hospital room, but a beautiful one… Steve wondered to himself if he went to heaven, he sighs gently and closes his eyes for a bit… it was then he heard it, a gentle voice humming a song. Steve furrows his brows at that and tried to sit up, he looked around the place in hope of finding from where that voice was coming from… it was enchanting. After Steve stood up from the bed, he heard the door opened making him look toward it, only to gasp, because there stood… "Peggy?" it was Peggy, an older Peggy that may have been in her early forties, but still beautiful as the day he saw her.
Steven smiled at that as he looked at the woman, happy that the woman was on his side. "Big enough that it will leave Hydra squirming, I'm sure the thought of them having the serum from someone not effected by werewolves' biology will be like a dream come true for them… I'm sure they will make their move after that." Steven said with a smirk, which made Peggy give an amused smile of her own and shake her head a little.
Suddenly memories start assaulting Steven, causing him to hold into his gasp and close his eyes tightly, trying to hold in the scream of pain that bubbled inside of him, as he tried to ignore the emptiness that seemed to crush him, the emptiness that only now Steven was able to notice, after his memories were back, and for a second, Steven wished he was dead.
"For you and other people out there, you may seem like you have recovered, but to us broken people on the inside, we knew that no matter how much we try we never really recover, that there will always be a scar deep down that refuses to be healed." Steve chided the Omega gently as he caressed his right cheek, wiping the tears that started falling on the Omega's face. "It's just like how you never forgave your father, just like how you refused to touch any baby you came in contact with. The only children you interact with are children older than two years, and Baby, this is not healthy, killing yourself like this." Steve pulled the Omega in his embrace when the Omega started shaking uncontrollably and Steve hated himself for making his lover cry.
"Rogers!" Tony snarled when he saw the man crossing his arms over his chest, Tony's scream made everyone, even the whimpering Natasha turn to the angry man who was snarling and looking at Rogers like he would rip him open a new one, which did nothing but make Rogers sigh happily, like being subjected to Tony's rage was the only thing he ever wanted… Tony really needed to find a therapist for the man (that would handle all of the Addams' craziness) and he won't give a fuck about what Barnes says! "What the fuck did you do?" Tony hissed as he took a kitchen knife and held it to Rogers' throat, which only caused the man to look at him like the sun was shining from his ass, which was uncomfortable on so many different levels.
Jamti let out a tired sigh, looking around Anton's workshop, hoping that there weren't any weapons that Anton will be an idiot to use against the elders. "They have every right to choose, Anton, especially when you are an unmated Alpha at the age of 32 springs; not only that but your actions in the past years are out of control, what happened a while ago with Hamar, was the last straw." Jamti stressed his words, causing his friend to growl and return back to the metal he was working on, hammering it with all of his strength, making Jamti wince.
"Who is she?" Steve asked with a dangerous smile on his lips, which did nothing but gain a smirk out of Tony… ah! How he loves when his husband gets all possessive and protective, it was even better to watch him go on a rampage to protect his virtue and honor.
"OK…" Harley smiled, his eyes start sparkling in wonder, which made Tony's breath leave him in a rush. Tony doesn't know why but seeing the small boy relaxing around him, made something flutter inside Tony's chest; it made Tony feel like he has done something good…
After that 'Pleasant' day in the police station, Tony decided to say fuck it and return to his work in SI, thankfully his coworkers didn't say anything about his month-long vacation, but Tony was sure that the only reason they kept their mouths shut was because his father was their boss, and him being their future boss meant he could fire them anytime he wants… it was a tempting idea, especially when they decided to be idiots and blow his lab when he was away.
Telling their friends that the two of them were engaged was not that much of a challenge that Tony thought it would be, he still remembered his friends' shocked faces that turned happy and delighted at the news, even Rhodey, who already knows about the engagement start crying once again, which ended up with Carol trying to calm her husband who looked like a mother seeing her daughter at the altar; let's also not forget Winnie who starts glaring at her son until the poor man cracked and confessed that he was dating Natasha for the last five years, which was shocking to everyone but Steve, even Natasha was shocked and flustered by Bucky's confession; Winnie's face though, the expression was gold… and if Tony took a thousand of embarrassing pictures as blackmail materials… no one needs to know.
Anthony never knew what heartbreak was, that was until he returned a month later and found the apartment empty. After a month had passed, Anthony returned to the apartment with a smile on his face, already imagining Steve waiting for him there with that gentle smile of his that made Anthony's heart dance in joy, so when he reached his apartment he was confused as why Steve hadn't come to greet him when he called out for him, Anthony had bit his lip feeling that something was wrong, walking inside of the house he saw something lying on the coffee table, he went to it and his heart stopped in his chest, this was his ID, the thing that he hated the most, with his full name, the name that confirms that he was a Stark.
"Yes, he used to beg me to make it for his birthday, every year… wouldn't eat it if it wasn't on the day of his birth." Jarvis said with a chuckle making Steve smile at that.
"The queen spoke the truth…" Jamti whispered his eyes were wide as they refused to move away from the amulet Anton was wearing. "That means the chain of misfortune has started…" Everyone froze at the admission of Jamti, gazing at Tyber with horror at the misfortune the Stone clan brought to their village… Anton though, couldn't help but gaze at the bear, like it held the answers to his questions…
"Little one, listen to me carefully, I want you to be brave for me, can you wait outside with your bear? Papa is going to make everything OK?" Steve said in a rush as he put the pup outside, which only made the pup whine, but the sound of Goose made the pup look at the cat then at the Alpha with a small nod. "Such a brave hero, Papa is so proud." Steve said as he kissed Peter's forehead making the pup nod his head and go with Goose, who starts pulling at his pajama pants.
" The woman growled, and Peter screamed and cries softly, making Steve screams and screams inside his mind. "
Angry, furious, spitting mad… was all Anton could think of, and all he could feel; his Alpha was snarling, and pacing in his cage, wanting to be let out, wanting to go on a killing spree. Why was that? What the foolish queen did was not his business, who the queen associate with was not his business; the person who the queen decided to share his bed with was not his business… then why? Why was Anton mad? Why was his Alpha furious? The queen was not his, the two of them were nothing but mere allies on the best of days, and enemies forced together at worse. So why? Why was Anton screaming and snarling? Why was he seeking blood in want of revenge?
"Oh, fuck it!" Tony growl as he gets out of the bed, giving Steve a nasty look, which was received with heart eyes from Steve. "OK, fine, one date! You fuck it up, your chance is over, got it?" Tony hissed at Steve, getting a happy squeal from the man in return, which was scarier than any horror Tony ever faced. In front of him, the Winter Soldier, the scariest assassin in the world, the man with the metal arm, the original Captain America, and a part of the Addams family; was squealing like a high school girl after Tony said yes to the idea of one date… scary… "Yeah, yeah, enjoy your five minutes of fame, until you fuck it up that is… by the way Addams; your crazy cousin Wednesday or something says Hi; when you see her tell her to fuck off! I don't need another Addams sniffing around me I already got my hands full with you." Tony snapped as he went to the door, ignoring Steve who was sighing happily like he was finally able to reach the stars.
"What do you think they are after, Fury?" Peggy asked as she frowned at the reports on her desk, reading and rereading them as she tried to gather as much information as she can, pursing her lips when reading the reports for the tenth time didn't give her any new information, which made the woman become irritated more than ever…
Tony gulp wondering what he was about to do, on one hand, Tony can make a run for it and hide in his workshop until the end of time, hoping that the Avengers won't go after his ass when they learn of Fury and his organization fate. On the other hand, Tony can man up and tell the Avengers what happened to S.H.I.E.L.D., hoping that they will understand it wasn't his fault and that it was Steve who destroyed the place with his Ma. All in all, everything promised Tony nothing but death and humiliation either by the hands of his friends or by Steve's hands… life sucks…
"You should have been here three hours ago; the little devil wouldn't let me sleep unless I take her outside." Tony stated, nuzzling his girl, and taking her baby scent; an action that calmed Tony's fragile heart more than he cared to admit. "What took you two so long? I thought you will be back an hour ago." Tony questioned as he stood up, smiling at Rhodey when he took the baby bag with him, and Pepper took the rest, as the three of them went inside the house.
Steven sighed as he looked at the room ceiling then turned his eyes to Peggy who was able to calm herself down, which made the man turn to her and stop her when she was about to leave the library to search for Tony, he already knows that Tony wouldn't appreciate this at all, and it could get really out of hand. "Whatever you are thinking, it will only make it worse if you search for him now." Steven said which made Peggy glared at him and Steven won't lie, Peggy has mastered her glare of doom in this universe, and it was a little bit scary, but it wasn't like his late husband when he was forced to get up before nine on Saturday… that was the scariest sight he ever saw, especially if his husband was putting on his green beauty mask… Steven was scared for life.
Tony held the roses in his hand tightly, giving his father a nod, trying to stop the butterflies in his stomach from making him more nervous as he was. When the door opened, Tony's breath hitched as his eyes fell on his husband-to-be. Steve look so handsome in the suit he wore, causing Tony's heart to start racing in his chest; when Steve's eyes caught him, Tony knew…
They eat their breakfast while making small conversation, talking about this and that, and Peter was the most energetic, talking about what they should do this summer vacation considering that schools will be over in two weeks. Peter though was hopping in his own seat, trying to convince Tony and Steve to bring one of his friends in the clinic with them, a boy that Peter befriended half a year when he arrived at the orphanage in the clinic.
Tony though only blinked and gave a tired smile, leaning a little on one side of the boat, gazing at the inky water under the boat, one of his hands came and start playing with the water, while the other cushioned his head as he gazed at the lake with sleepy eyes. "Thank you…" Tony murmured, a yawn nearly left his lips as he gazed at the still water; it has been ages since the last time Tony felt this calm that sleep came knocking on his door. "Thank you… for saving her." Tony's voice became drowsy the more the boat rocked him back and forth, rocking him to sleep. "I wonder… if you would have saved me… months ago…" Those words were followed by an exhale, Tony finally losing the battle to stay awake.
"No, Carter, you were the one who made the mistake; I warned you to never get near my husband and children or there would be consequences." Steve's voice got closer to the closet, and Tony couldn't help the flinch when a gentle knock on the closet's door was heard. "Sweetheart, you can come out now, everything is under control." Steve's gentle voice caused Tony to shake before he crawl toward the closet and opened the door, his legs not supporting him from how shaky he was.
"Sometimes… it is easier to just ignore everything, acting like nothing happened, like everything was going to be alright in the end… even if it meant lying to yourself for a few hours to achieve a little peace…" Steve whispered making Tony's eyes return to the ceiling as he took a deep breath trying to calm the storm inside of him. "Other times, going to the gym and hitting the punching bags or sparing with Natasha helped, but not always because when I lay in my bed at night I will never be able to sleep, even if I was tired as hell." Steve finished his words which made Tony nod his head in the darkness.
much of the sweets, Steve was more afraid of the two eating the whole plate, so he was content knowing that Tony won't throw a fit about them going into a sugar coma. "Peter, why don't you go help Tony preparing dinner? Harley and I need to have a little chat." Steve ordered his son, causing Peter to look between Steve and Harley a few times before nodding his head, taking the sweets with him when Steve handed it to the boy.
or something of that sort; thankfully the two of them were angels as soon as they finished their pillow fort and had their snacks, leaving Tony to finish his work before starting to prepare dinner. Burger steak as the kids demanded.
And lastly, there was him… he who spent nearly all of his time in Tony's room, who spent his time cleaning it and make it livable for the owner that would never return, he who enters this room for its calmness, not to draw, no, for every time he draws...
But the truth was Steven was scared… he was really scared, not only he was carrying a child he did not want, but he was… a slave… a slave to a man that was one of the reasons he lost a child in the past, a man that wouldn't hesitate in ordering Steven to get rid of his child, not that Steven wanted the child in the first place, but if the king knew about him being with a child, then if he thought that being the man's slave was tiring, then what to come will be the straw that broke Steven.
The sound of a gunshot ringing in Tony's ears froze him in his place, and for a terrifying second, Tony couldn't help but think that Obadiah had shot him. Tony turned toward Obadiah, his body shaking and tense, but Tony couldn't help but feel relieved when he noticed that the gun was pointing at the ceiling, not him. "Now, now, Tony, I don't think I gave you the permission to leave did I?" Obadiah stated, pointing the gun toward Tony as he took step after step until he was in front of him; ignoring how Tony's terrified eyes followed the gun, and how he put his hands on his belly, trying to protect it. "Now you that are listening like you should come and sit, I have a lot to discuss with you." Obadiah stated with a sick smile on his face, causing Tony to swallow.
Well, I think that I botched this chapter but I don't know anymore, I hope that it was at least good or something; I don't fancy writing this chapter for the sixth time.
It was an hour later that Peter and Tony finally left, and not from the lack of trying, but because Steve kept tugging both of their ears when they tried to sneak off, it was when Steve deemed them ready, after packing Peter's back bag, and giving him his cellphone, while making sure that his baby knew what to do, (And threat Tony with death if something happened to the boy) Steve finally let the two of them go, gazing at Tony's car until it was out of his sight before he entered the house, a thoughtful look taking over his face before he closes the door behind…
"So how are you holding up?" The doctor asked him after she gave him a sheet of paper to give to the secretary to make another appointment.
"No, he came home, six p.m., you made us a fancy dinner, and then you told Tony you are pregnant. You fainted after Tony starts talking about buying drinks or something…" Bucky said slowly, standing up and going to the sink to give his coffee cup a quick rinse. "Maybe you should take him to the doctor, Tony." Bucky said uncomfortably, before rushing out of the kitchen, but not before giving Steve a look like he was insane.
"Eye-Patch!" James suddenly shouted as he pointed at Nicolaus, causing the Alpha to glare at the pup and send Steven an accusing look, which ended up with the Omega smiling in amusement. Count on his babe to be just like him, a blunt kid who calls them as he sees them; that was the same exact title he gave Nicolaus when he saw him for the first time, the difference was that his dam had pulled his ears for insulting the Alpha.
"Hey little one, can you be brave and look at me?" Steve whispered in the child's ear, making the pup raise his head to look at the older man, it made Steve smile a little and caress his burning forehead. "Listen here little one, I need you to be brave for your Mama, can you do that? Can you go with these good people?" Steve asked making the pup whine at that.
Harley's breath hitched and he turned around to call Peter once more only to see him running and laughing with Cooper and Lila running to the second floor and leaving Harley alone; a gasp left Harley's chest and he turned to see Mr. Tony and the strange woman causing Harley to swallow harshly and stood up, running toward the door and hoping to help Mr. Tony before that strange woman does something to him.
Edith said after a while of ambiguous silence and Tony furrow his eyes, thinking that he had imagined the reluctant tone the A.I. used. "Can you take us to him?" Peggy asked in a distraught tone, her sentiment echoing from all the Avengers, Edith has just found Steven when J cannot, that means the need to move fast.
"It wasn't your fault… I should have got rid of that room for a long time now… maybe this is for the best." Tony breathed out as he turned around in Steve's arms hiding his face in the Alpha's neck, breathing in the man comforting scent. "Where is Peter?" Tony asked, already planning how to apologize for scaring the pup, the boy probably felt bad about what happened in the room.
"I said leave Steve! He is mine!" Natasha snapped, taking his 'Huh' differently than what Tony meant it, which only pointed to Tony and informed him that Natasha hasn't seen herself in the mirror recently, which Tony doesn't know if it was a blessing or a curse.
The fourth story 'The Sound Of Breaking Glass' an Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamic story, with pregnant Omega Steve, it's a Thrill/Mystery story, with a dash of psychological horror, as two possessive Alphas fighting over out poor blond.
In the past three years, a lot of things changed, and a lot of things continued to change. Rhodey and Carol finally end up marrying each other, both of them still in the air force and it seems that both of them determent to never quit or have any children, but the two of them were happy and that what was important. Clint and his mate and children were happy; they end up adding another member into their family, when Clint gave birth to their third child two years ago, a young boy by the name Nathaniel. Bruce and Betty, on the other hand, didn't want children just like Rhodey and Carol; they said they were good without them, though Tony wonders from times to times if it wasn't something else. The Barnes though were happy that their children had finally left the nest as Winnie liked to say, Rebecca or Becca's as she liked to be called finally ends up mating with her lover after graduating college, it ends up with Winnie crying her eyes out on his couch, Rose and Lora the twin ends up going into college to study law and medic, Winnie was still trying to get Tony to go out with her elder son on a date, Tony always says 'No'. An Alpha woman ends up moving back in the neighbor a year ago, Sarah Rogers, apparently she was an old friend of Barnes and used to live here before moving to Queens, Tony met her a few times, she was friendly and kind, and made it her mission to make Tony smile if she could, Tony was grateful. As for him and Pepper's family, they were on good terms, if he wasn't in their house they were in his, there was never a day that passes without them talking to each other. Another thing that took a place was his and his father's relationship got better in the end, and what made him happy there was no Stane; it was rough at the start, when SI turns its direction to clean energy, but after the new inventions that Tony creates, that turns every head to it, everything was good.
"I'm just saying you should move fast… last thing I heard he was dating a civilian and they are about to be bonded." Steve said just to mess with her, but the sound of his phone being broken by Natasha made him hit breaks and look at the Alpha that was looking at him with a gaping mouth. "What the heck, Natalia?" Steve snapped looking at his dead phone that was in Natasha's hand.
"Is that so?" Tony asked which made Peter nod his head with a happy grin on his face making Tony smile a little at that, turning his face toward his Alpha when he entered the kitchen and saw the Alpha cooking dinner.
"Oh, great, great, blond, blue eyes, and a secretly abusive A-hole; great job." Tony pouted hard, stabbing his ice-cream as he thought about his marriage with a dark cloud surrounding him this time, he should have known, he should have turned into a monk or a priest after Ty, no, not after Ty, after Sunset, but Tony was an idiot and he hoped, even with Steve, which turned out that Steve was probably worse than Ty, being an Addams and all.
Damn! I did a lot of research for this chapter, my head is spinning! Though it was fun learning so much about Vikings, if you will excuse me, I will return to my searching about Vikings' lives 😂
"What about the king?" Nattalegg asked which made the Omega sighed at that and pointed to the ship's wheel, the woman turned her head to see the king behind the wheel, sitting the course for them to return home, glaring at everyone who dared to gaze his way, scaring everyone within ten feet of him, and that was fate if Nattalegg saw any, it made her really wonder…
When Steven found Tony, he found the Omega packing his bags in a rush, which made the older man, let out a tired sigh at that and knock on the door, which made the Omega jump and whirl around to look at Steven like he was a dear caught in a headlight, and it pained Steven that Tony has an expression like this. "Oh, hey, what are you doing here?" Tony asked nervously which made Steven smile despite his heart hurting.
"What do you mean Steven? Hydra can't possibly be out there, I and the Howling Commandos made sure of that." Peggy said gently which made Steven turn toward her, and his eyes to soften when they fell on her figure.
"Hello?" Tony had answered with a shaky voice full of hope, two months had passed after all and the hope of him finding his son was stronger than he could imagine.
Tony then went to help Steve putting their bags in the trunk, they didn't travel with heavy suitcases, but it seemed that they have bought all of Chicago with them when they returned to New York, which was sweet, Tony wondered if there was a present for him in there, it was only a matter of minutes before Steve and Tony were sitting in their seats, Steve was the one behind the wheel this time, something about Peter wanting to talk with Tony and him wanting to busy himself.
Without realizing it, Tony ran crossing the street, making the cars hit breaks and honk at him, while the owners screamed, but Tony didn't care, he just ran in hope of reaching the pup, which thanks God noticed him and seemed to recognize him as he starts pulling his hand from the Beta that was dragging him away. Tony heard the sound of someone snarling, and it was much later that he realized it was him, but it didn't matter as he reached the Beta and punched him hard in the face making him let the pup go, and crash into the window shop behind him, that scene caused chaos as people start screaming and some even tried to pull Tony away from the man that was twisting and trying to escape from the punches that Tony was dishing.
It ended with Tony sitting on the sofa, the TV was on, but Tony wasn't focusing on it, for him, it was just background noise, he was thinking deeply while biting his thumbnail, a habit that Tony thought he got rid of, but it seems that he was wrong, a scenario after a scenario entered his mind, and all of them left him shaking, doubtful, because every time he analyzed his surrounding, he became more and more certain that he was an idiot because how blind was he?
"Yes, you are… please, do not lie…" Tony stated, letting out a sigh when his daughter started tugging on his shirt, demanding that he gave her the attention she wanted. "I know that in your eyes, you are doing the right thing, protecting people and stopping another disaster from happening. But… what the two of you are doing is wrong, and I can't stress that enough. I don't say it because I care about Rogers, far from it, I say it because it wasn't only my trust you broke, but you endangered many lives with your games." Tony stated before he starts pouncing Morgan who gave a tired whine. "I can't forgive you… or in reality, I don't want to forgive you. Not now at least, so please just… just leave me alone for now." Tony pleaded, going to his house, ignoring how Peggy tried to stop him, only for Bucky to shake his head.
"Well, you see, because of you, that old bitch reported me to Barnes and Carter, and guess what? It seemed that you are their favorite out of everyone, which was strange considering they don't take a liking to anyone… anyone but the supposed monster living in this lake… do you know what they did?" Ty leaned to whisper in Tony's ear, making him choke and shake his head, hoping against hope that Clint or hell Fury was coming this way, but Tony could only give a pained cry when he was pushed down to the ground, and he sobbed as he tried to curl around himself and protect his belly from the man who was standing over him. "Do you know what they did? They kicked me out of the town and took everything! Like they have any right to do as they like! So what if I harass whores like you and drink all day long? It's not like your life matter or anything not after you whored yourself to the monster and carried its child." Tony sobbed as he tried to crawl away, letting out a shriek, when the taller man drops on him, taking hold of his hands in one arm while pointing the knife at Tony's belly.
"Tony, are you OK?" Steve questioned gently as he stood behind Tony holding him, his words causing Tony to shrug because the Omega didn't want his fiancé to know how sad and heartbroken he was that his father refused to come, not that Tony can blame his father, after all, he was the one who pushed his father away.
"Why don't you look at that? I would have never imagined The Tony Stark in such place." A familiar gritty voice said, caused Tony to raise his shades once more, a grimace itching into his face as he saw the person he tried to avoid since he was 19 and successful in doing so for nearly twenty years.
There isn't a sensation in the world that comes even close to how it feels to be with his Alpha, and Steve forced himself to keep his eyes open as Tony begins to move, watching Steve as he mewls in frantic pleasure. "Mine…" Tony groaned, and Steve answered with an ecstatic noise, wrapping his legs around Tony. "Mine." Tony repeated, softer now, and tears are falling down Steve's cheeks. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's shoulders. "Mine, my omega, Steve." Tony rambled as he nuzzled Steve's collarbone, then kisses his throat. "Darling, sweetheart, don't cry. Don't cry, baby…" Tony went on as he caressed Steve's hair.
Tony was happy, he was really happy, he couldn't remember the last time he felt this happiness, but he thinks that it was years and years ago, before Stane and all of the shit happened in his life, but Tony will be lying if he said that Peter wasn't one of the reasons of his happiness, because no matter how painful it was, no matter how humiliating and heartbreaking, Tony will never regret having his baby, because not only was the small child his sanity, but he was his, his and only his, even if Stane was the donor, because by the end of the day, hearing his baby's happy giggles and squeals as he was chased by his family in a game of tag, made Tony's heart flutter happily in his chest.
"Howard," Steve called out making the Alpha look up from his phone fast, the hope shining in his eyes. "He wants to see you…" Steve said making everyone stand up fast, Maria was the first to enter the room as she pushed Steve and run toward her son.
"Yeah? What do you want me to do, Pep?" Tony asked as he signed another paper and gave it to Pepper only to have the woman growl and scrunch the paper in her hands to a ball and throw it at the screen. Thankfully, having Serpentine here inside the mansion, and threatening everyone with physical harm if they hurt Tony and Steve's relationship, seemed to have turned down the hate that was directed toward him (Though not by Natasha and Bucky). "Look at the state of the mansion, everyone coming here won't even disagree with him." Tony stated, stumping on a stuffed doll that tried to stab him in the ankle, ignoring Pepper's squeak at the action.
Life was good! Even if he had to take the graduation exams early… way early to graduate from MIT, which kind of made him mad at his father at first, but he got over it. The only thing that his mother didn't seem to get over was him having a powerful Alpha, a subject she always talk about in dinner time, which made both Tony and Howard sighs in annoyance… like now.
"Father is back from the hunt! You will not believe, My Queen, but father managed to slay a bear!" Petrus gushed about the king, going on and on how huge the bear was and how it would probably last the village for months. Steven's lips twitched up at the enthusiastic look on both his babe and the king's son; the smile though fell as he glimpses the dark frown mixed with shock on Nicolaus' face…
"Calm down foolish king, I did not mean to embarrass you… much." The queen laughed, which made Anton sputter and turn around, planning on starting a shouting match with the queen to defend his case, did the queen not understand how Anton was practically dying right now? Not only was he compared to a peeping predator, but the queen also compared him to a boy who just entered his Alpha-hood, as if!
…" Steve purred before leaning down to kiss Tony's cheek, an action that made Tony flush pink and for the people around them to grind their teeth so hard Tony can hear it loud and clear. It was when Steve was out of sight that Tony relaxed, trying to cool down the flush on his face as he remembered Steve's soft lips on his cheek.
"Sorry, sweetheart, but I needed to destroy them all and bring their real leader Killian; those bastards were trying to hack your suits and seek them on you using something called Extremis, how dare them to try to defile your tomb like that?!" Steve snarled kicking the poor bastard on his back, making him whimper and shiver in his place, pleading and whining for mercy which only enrages Tony even more after the piece of information he got.
Tony shifted in his place, before nodding his head and following Steve when the Omega headed to their bedroom. Reaching their room, Steve let out a tired sigh as he went to the closet, his mind was running around in circles that he wasn't focusing on when Tony starts ranting about this and that. "…And then he had the gall to play the victim! I am sure that Bucky has a hand in this!" Tony hissed making Steve close his eyes and count to ten.
It wasn't until Steve was on the way to know the gender that he became nervous, wondering if he should put it off until the birth to make it a surprise for both him and his 'absent' mate. A hand softly touched his shoulder, making Steve look up to see that Bucky was giving him an encouraging smile; the smile seemed to be infectious because Steve couldn't help but return it. Turning to his doctor, Steve could only nod his head; squeezing Bucky's hand when the Alpha held his.
Steve's words seemed to have frozen the man in his place; it was a few seconds later he returned to his dish playing with his food. "Yeah… military…" The man whispered absently, picking on his food while taking a bite now and then before turning to Steve who was looking at his plate uncomfortable. "My… my friends call be Bucky… if you want you can call me that…" The Alpha offered as an olive branch, gazing at the Omega whose smile widen at that until he was beaming happily.
"Mama…" James murmured as he woke up, gazing at Steven who turned his face toward his babe and gave him a small tired smile, seeing Steven awake, James gasped and his eyes start clouding with tears, as he all but throw himself in Steven's embrace when the Omega opened his arms. "I was so worried, you did not wake up for seven days, they said…. They said that you may not wake up, they said…" James let out a sob, which caused Steven to coo, he winced as he tried to sit down, the pain in his abdomen was sharp but he paid the pain no attention as he held his babe tightly in his arms.
"Yeah… overprotective… you sure you didn't notice how the man has been trying to get in your pants since you came here?" Tony asks spitefully, not caring about jeopardizing Bucky's chance with Rogers, still a little bit angry for the mean things the man said to him.
The sound of screams made Tony look up, only to see a speeding car heading toward him before Tony could do anything, there was pain, so much pain, that he opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out…
Tony grunt as he felt the last trace of sleep leaving him, throwing him once more into the living world, reminding Tony once more that he was alive to see a new day. Letting out a tired sigh, Tony wiped his face on his pillow, wondering to himself if he should get up and face the day head-on, or if he can stay in bed and sleep some more, probably sleep until Aunt Peggy or Pepper came knocking on his door. The grumbling whines Tony heard, made Tony open his eyes, and search the room with sleepy eyes, until his gaze finally landed on his eight years old baby, snuggling into Tony's chest while huffing and muttering sleepily. Tony could only gaze at his sleepy son, blinking his eyes a few more times before he looked at his digital clock, his face then became colder as his eyes fell on the date, Tony only shut his eyes tightly and pulled Peter in his embrace, snuggling tightly to his boy as he pulled the blanket over their heads, trying to cocoon them away from this awful day.
"Do you want it to be one?" He asked which made Tony look at his hands, a blush taking over his face as he shrugged his shoulders not knowing what to say. Six and a half years ago, he would have squealed and jumped right into the opportunity to go on a date with Captain America, but this was Steve Rogers he was talking about, the man his pup was attached to. "It's whatever you wanted to be Tony, friends hanging out, or date; it's a choice you need to make on your own." That made Tony nods his head and snuggled under the covers saying good night to the Alpha and pulling his pup, closer to him...
It was an hour later that the pup finally woke up, Tony's face becoming worried as the pup hugged his toy tightly, watching the TV silently without a word, only nodding his head or humming if he wanted something which was concerning as he tried to cheer the pup but getting no reaction.
"Thinking about Peter…" Tony answer after he swallowed the mouthful of French toast that Steve fed him. His answer made Steve's eyes soften and the Alpha lean to kiss Tony's brow, causing the Omega to let another purr; God, Tony had to find a way to stop purring every time Steve was going to do something sweet as this.
"You are right… I hate it when you are right…" Tony grumbled which gained him a knowing smirk from his husband, causing his pout to increase and only to stop when Steve leaned down to kiss him. "You know… I really need a distraction right now… why don't we find the next poor soul and bury him into our cemetery…" Tony whispered seductively, which caused Steve to grin and let a dark laugh at the thought of torturing the first person they saw.
"I didn't know you could dance," Tony spoke after a while of dancing, which made Steven chuckle and twirl Tony, making the Omega smile. "Don't change the subject, Mr. Rogers, where did you learn how to dance like this? Steven smiled at the curiosity in Tony's eyes, they looked just like his husband's, yet so different.…
"Are you Steven Rogers?" The man asked getting a nod from Steve who was trying to calm the fussy baby down. "Well, I am Abraham Erskine's lawyer, you can call me Phillips." The old man said as he offered his hand, making Steve look at him with a confused face but took his hand nonetheless.
"Will you go out with me on a date then? No torture involved this time! I promise! You can be the one who plans the date and I won't say no to any part of it!" Steve said, his words causing Tony to stop in his place, thinking and rethinking about Rogers's offers. In the end Tony shrugged his shoulder, already knowing he was doomed from the start, at least then there was no torture involved in any future date…
"Papa! I wanna Papa." His son sobbed into his chest making Tony close his eyes tightly at that. "Papa protect Mama, wanna Papa…" Tony let his son sob to sleep, he was too tired to tell his son what dead meant…
“They couldn’t come, Steve is taking Peter to see his friend Sam in Chicago, so they are staying there for a few days, they asked me to come with them, but unfortunately I had honey bear’s birthday to attend.” Tony said in mock disappointment, putting his hand on his chest, letting out an annoyed sigh which caused everyone to chuckle.
"Was that Peter?" Steve asked as came to the living room with slow steps, the grocery bags in his arms as he made his way slowly to Tony, who took half of the bags in Steve's hands, getting a kiss on the cheek as a thank you. Steve always had the bad habit of bringing all of the grocery bags in one trip, which was the main reason why Tony needed to be careful or the bags would end on the floor.
"You never changed, ya punk… I missed you, Stevie, we searched for you for so long… Ma, Pa, Becca, and I… we never found you thought the worse…" Bucky's voice cracked as he pulled Steve into another hug which made the Omega gives a choked noise and pulls the Alpha tightly toward him, which made Bucky shake and hide his face in Steve's neck, biting his tongue to hold his snarl as he smelled Stark's scent on Steve… though his heart did break a little as he smelled the scent of tears and pain… and Bucky for the thousand times tried to remind himself that Stark was also a victim of his father's manipulating.
Reaching the front door, Tony nearly sob in relief as he opened the door and run toward the lake, it was a miracle that Tony didn't trip and fall on his face and hurt his baby; it was a miracle that Tony managed to reach the boat and jump in it, pushing the boat away from the shore as far as he can. Tony's eyes took in the house, taking in the figure standing in Morgan's room, gazing at them from the window before the shadow disappearing.
"You are right, I cannot kill you, but it does not mean I cannot kill your little followers, nor does it mean I will not punish you, for you not only attacked my son, but you attacked a pregnant Omega who held the sacred runes that formed the word 'Life' on his person, and you have cursed us with death and plague, for Goddess Frigga will punish all who hurt those who carried her bless!" Murmurs and panic start taking over every person on the hill, for only now did everyone realization of what Hamar's actions caused them. "An Omega who went into a shock after you hurting their unborn… do you know what kind of punishment awaits us from Goddess Frigga? Plague, sickness, starvation, death…" Starkad's smile widens even more at the panic he saw on everyone's faces. "Now, your punishment shall be known to the Gods, Goddesses, and everyone standing on the hill, for only a true sacrifice will stop Goddess Frigga from seeking to curse us." Starkad words were followed by screams of agreement, the fear of being cursed and abandoned by their Gods and Goddesses pushed any sympathy they held for the criminals, no one wanted to be cursed with plague and death because a few idiots didn't know when to pick their battles. "For daring to attack the Omega that held Goddess Frigga's blessing, you are punishment are death, in the form of 'Blóðörn', the sentence shall be executed tomorrow at dawn." Gasps of shock and fear took over the people, for not once since they start living in Mantta did this severe punishment was performed on anyone, and seeing their king ordering it, it made the knowledge of how serious their future punishment at the hands of Gods finally sink.
, not ven zey needs vu." The man looked around the place, taking oat cookies and putting them in Steve's cart, causing the Omega to puff his chest in irritation at the rude move. "Tell me, Schteffen, vere is Morkan?" The man's odd question stopped Steve from what he wanted to scream to the man, Steve froze in his place when the man's question finally made sense…
The Irish accented voice answered making Steve give a wobbly smile at that and knock on the door, he opened it a little while later to look at the man sitting near the window in his wheelchair talking with Dummy. "Steve? Oh, you are back! How was your mission?" The older man asked with twinkling eyes after he saw Steve enter the room and walk toward him. "Oh, for me?" Tony asked happily taking the roses out of Steve's hands.
"I see; why don't we eat dinner? We can watch a boring movie later where you can fall asleep without Bucky making a fuss about you sleeping too much." Peggy smiled as she starts walking toward the kitchen, Tony still in her arm and a pie in the other hand, Bucky when he caught the sight of them shook his head in amusement with a smile on his lips. Tony couldn't help but feel warm at the way Peggy and Bucky always treat him, his heart pounded in his chest at the affection shining in the looks the two of them send to him…
And to be true to himself Tony had fun, Steve was charming, caring, loving even, and it made Tony flush every time he remembered how the Alpha gave his baby as much attention as he gave him, keeping in mind Peter's happiness as much as Tony. The Omega never had any real date in his life, but Tony think that yesterday was the closest he had to a one, but what really surprised him was Steve's words, how the Alpha gave Tony the freedom to make his choice every step of the way, and it made him happy, it made him happy and he couldn't help but a fantasy about what will happen if he just said 'Yes', he wondered if Steve would have smiled and leaned up to kiss him, and that thought made Tony's face become red at the thought of being kissed by the Alpha after all the Omega was never kissed before, not even Stane kissed him in fear of the Omega biting his tongue off, and it made Tony grateful for that because it meant that he got to enjoy the kissing experience without fear clouding it.
The sound of the door slamming shut made Tony give a wet gasp in relief, moving shakily and opened his good eye, looking around the place like a wild animal as he tried to calm himself down while curling on himself protecting his tummy, waiting…
It took a long time before everything turned out to be alright in the end; a lot of ups and downs before everything settle down, lots of tears and crying, and many happy moments that made them hope and wish for a better future. It was getting better, things are looking up, and bridges that were burned a long time ago were being mended.
"What… is a b-bear?" Peter asked touching that thing in his Papa's hand, it was soft and warm, made Peter want to hold and nuzzle it, he was feeling a little sleepy but his Papa's hugs and kisses made him keep his eyes open a little more, he wanted to stay with Papa and Mama a little more before Mama says it is a nap time.
"Mama, look, I am holding her!" Harley called, causing Tony to turn his attention to his baby, a smile taking over his face as he cooed and purred, opening his arms for Harley and Peter when they rushed to him and he held his kids tightly in his arms as he kissed their heads. Yes, Tony doesn't need his father to tell him… he knew… all thanks to Steve who gave him the strength to face the demons that dominated his life for years now. Tony was really happy that he met Steve and Peter in the park that day, if he didn't he wouldn't have this amazing life; looking at his children Tony purred and nuzzled them…
"Everyone is waiting outside, they wanted to see the pup, but he starts crying when he saw them." Steve said which made Tony look at his baby who was playing with the Shield, so that's why the Alpha brought the Shield, to calm the pup down, Tony nods at that and turns to the Alpha who cleared his throat. "Pepper and Colonel Rhodes are waiting outside too." That made Tony gasp and look at the door with teary eyes, Pepper and Rhodey were here! He couldn't believe his ears, he had thought that the two of them had forgotten about him, but Steve was saying that they were here.
To say the truth the chapter was not to my satisfaction, I wrote and rewrote the chapter, only getting this far before saying enough… sigh…
Again, I am so sorry that I ended the story like this, but as you can say a lot has been going on lately, and I just couldn't finish it anymore, hopefully, one day I will return and finish the story.
"You are making a mistake, Steven…" Carter stated in a too calm voice, that caused Tony to swallow several times as he tried to calm his breath, trying to stop the terror taking hold of his heart that his husband was finally back home.
"I thought you will never come." Was the only thing Maria heard as she entered the house, and she could only look at the Omega in front of her, he was skinny, too skinny to be healthy, and he was tired, too tired probably from taking care of the small pup and working overtime to pay for the bills, she wondered how old he was because she can see that he was young, younger than Tony by years, how young was he when he fell pregnant? She knew the answer to that question will scar her for life.
It seems that the news of Steve having a match with Petey-pie made everyone crazy, as every one of their family, even Goose showed up to see the match that was going to take a place, even Angie who usually sleeps until noon was awake in her nightgown sending Steve harsh glares threatening him with death if he hurt her baby, which made everyone blink at that and look at the woman who was narrowing her eyes at Steve who was ignoring her, but needless to say, everyone was taking Peter's side cheering for the pup who was going to go against Captain America, while sending glares to the Alpha ordering him silently to lose, even if it meant going at it dramatically like fainting when Peter put a finger on him.
"What about the pup?" Steve said desperately, that question made Maria froze, and she nearly fell on the floor if a shocked Howard didn't take a hold of here, Angie leaned heavily on Peggy, who was trying to hold herself and her mate up.
"Maria Stark, I know." The Omega said gently to the woman like it was a secret to be shared with only the two of them, which made Maria relax a little when the Omega didn't seem like he wanted to kill her or curse her on the spot, something she wouldn't blame him if he did. "My name is Steve Rogers." He said as he gave her tea, which only now she noticed the cups, pot, and other beverages and sweets on the table, and she wondered to herself since when did the Omega know about her coming, and why didn't he say anything?
It took Tony three hours of driving through the forest to reach the town that was called 'Shield' a strange name for a town… one that wasn't mentioned on any map so far. Tony blinked when he finally spotted the town, relief taking him over when he realized that what the man informed him of was true, and not one of his father's many mind games. The village was quiet and lively at the same time. As Tony drove through it, he saw people stop and look at his car every time he passed a place, giving Tony the chills, wondering what kind of shit he's thrown himself into.
It ends up with Steve calling Anthony over and over again, but to his dismay, the Alpha never once picked up his phone or sent a message, Steve tried and tried to call him over and over again, for three days he did, but the Alpha never answered him and Steve was at his wit's end, it end with the landlady knocking at his door on the third day, she had looked so uncomfortable in being near Steve, but she told him to leave, that she was giving him only an extra day to pack everything and leave, least the police became involved.
"You are awake…" Tony breathed out in wonderment, making Steve smile, but it looked like a grimace more than a smile, with the way Steve looked at this moment, it was a small miracle. It was the first time anyone saw Steve awake when the sun was up in the sky. "Wait! Did Peter just say you hit the Scarlet Witch with a chair?" The wide eye look as Tony said those words, made Steve give a tired chuckle and nod his head. Tony on the other hand could only gaze at Steve with a dropped jaw as realization made his breath vanish…
"I think that no matter how much I assure you that nothing is going to happen, you won't believe me." Angie sighed and shook her head, coming to sit beside Tony on one of the chairs, humming to herself as she gazed around the place. "I was an actress you know? Not the famous kind of actress on TV, obviously, but a stage actress. I was doing well I supposed, I was married, I had a good job, I had a home…" Angie hummed, lost in her thoughts as her eyes took in something invisible in front of her.
The redhead thought held her position for a moment longer, before stepping back and removing the blade from Johann neck, which made the Alpha released a shuddering breath and clutched his throat. "
Everyone in this mansion had unhealthy coping methods, Howard with him being a workaholic and always searching for his son, even when Maria and Peggy would beg him to stop, to let go, to leave Tony to rest in peace. Maria who either spent her days on anti-depressed meds, or out fighting for Omegas' right, who created a hospital just for Omegas in need, with support Alphas system, a new idea that shook the world, but helped every Omega to stand on their feet. Peggy who nearly followed Howard in his methods of being a workaholic, who couldn't handle Howard's begging, who adopted Natalia who was near Tony's age when he was kidnapped, just to stop the hollowed feeling inside of her. Angie, who was always emotional, screaming her mind without filter, not caring who she hurt, because she just wanted the hurt in her heart to stop, who was only ever calm when she was with Natasha, never with Peggy, for she thinks that it was her mate's fault that Tony was dead… and Jarvis, poor old Jarvis, who became a ghost, who punished himself daily every time he passed Tony's room, who accepted being ignored by Angie and screamed at just because he was too weak to stop what happened, Jarvis, who wanted Tony's happy memory to stay with everyone, but no one wants that to remember the pain, no matter how much Steve snapped at Angie to stop her pointless abuse, no matter how much Steve and everyone else reminded her that it wasn't Jarvis's fault, no matter how much Steve spent time with Jarvis to remember a loved person that was long gone, no matter how much Steve see the gratitude in Jarvis' tired eyes, he knows it wasn't enough… he knows that if Tony saw what Angie was doing to a person he cared about so much that he named one of his greatest creations after… the teen would be crushed…
So far, Steve decided to act as obedient and demure as he can be, following everyone's lead and orders; just until Steve regain his strength and the ability to move his body as freely as he can, maybe even remember what the hell happen to him. When that happens and Steve can finally move on his own while gaining solid prove about his kidnappers, he would escape from this place and search for Tony; after that, Steve would make sure that Bucky and everyone he paid to confuse him would be thrown behind the bars never to be free again.
Steven smiled as he took in the stories he heard, his eyes misted a little when the Alpha talked about how Brookland fare in his absence, and how Steven's betrothal became nothing but a pain in the behind when he reached his young adulthood. "W…what happened to Volundrsson?" Steven finally decided to ask, gathering the courage that eluded him for hours as he listens to the Alpha and getting insight into each other's lives.
"Anton, what are we to do now?" Jamti shouted, his bow and arrow ready, waiting for Anton to say the word for him to fire. Anton growled as he stood up, his sword in his hand as he turned to the bear, narrowing his eyes as he prepared to fight the beast.
"Well, that's awkward…" Bucky muttered making Tony hum and pull his hand away from the Alpha. "Look I'm sorry for my Ma's pushiness; can we just pretend this never happened again? I will be grateful if we do." Bucky said making Tony blink a little at that.
"Umm Steve, why are we in the cemetery?" Tony asks as he followed Steve, blinking his eyes at the rows and rows of headstones he was forced to pass in the darkness of the night. The cemetery was really scary right now, especially with the crows and owls making it their mission to scare the crap out of Tony, who was trying hard not to latch into Steve and scream bloody murder; even after getting used to the Addams scary way of life, walking in the cemetery at night was something that Tony never dared to cross, especially after his parents died, because he was so sure that the two of them raised from the ground like a zombie and until this day no one believed him when he tells them that his parents run away from their burial place.
Steve remembered years and years ago; when everything was simple and Tony was just Anthony, and Steve was just that annoying kid from Brooklyn who enjoyed annoying that hot Alpha who always blushed at Steve's advances. He remembered years ago when he fell in love with Anthony's vision of the future, promising himself that day, that he will do anything he can to be in the future that his Anthony always saw. He remembered when the two of them were together, holding each other under the blanket, planning the future that they hoped for, but never achieved.
"I hope you know what you are doing, mother." Loki said before he nodded his goodbyes to the woman and left, leaving the woman gazing at the pair with a thoughtful look and pained eyes, as vision after vision of what to come assaulted her…
"Your… dam's Shield?" Anton asked slowly, getting a nod from the boy who was still too engrossed in tracing the Shield with his fingers; itching the shape of the shield in his memories to pay him any attention. "Tell me about it, the Shield's story." After knowing where the Shield belonged, Anton really wanted to know the weapon's story, wondering about the use of a weapon that he found in the Hydra king's treasure room; a weapon that was forgotten and left to gather nothing but dust.
Jamti let out a breath as he followed his dear friend when Anton left his workshop, grumbling many insults under his breath, making Jamti's lips twitch in amusement when Anton cursed every elder by the name. Jamti paused in his place when he saw Anton's sight turning to gaze at his son; his son who was grinning mischievously and running around with the queen's babe, laughing freely and playing like any child his age should. Jamti couldn't help but bite his lips, happiness fills his heart; finally, Petrus was finally making friends and acting like someone's his age should.
"That fucker!" His father's voice made Tony stop in his place, the sound of Aunt Peggy and Steve coming from the room stopped him in his place, wondering what everyone was doing inside his father's office. "How did he even do that? I thought the court plead him guilty! How did he get out of that death sentence?" His father snarled which made Tony jump a little, he really should just leave, he should turn around and ignore this day ever happened, but Tony was frozen in place, and the Omega didn't even know how to move.
"What the…?" Tony muttered to himself as he stretched his hand toward the slight, furrowing his brows when he felt a breeze on his fingers, tilting his head, Tony put his fingers through the slight, raising his brow when the wall seemed to give away and slide to the left. It was then that the door behind him was wrenched open (He didn't even know it was close!) and Rhodey came nearly ran Tony over with how frantic he was.
"I… I honestly don't know, Stevie…" Bucky answered shame written on his face causing Steve's lips to tremble and for his hands to rest on his belly. "It depends on Howard; he is the one who decides what goes in the family. Tony… Tony would do anything Howard says just to be on his good side and gain what he wants; that's how the family had been for decades. Though I am optimistic that Howard would leave you and Morgan alone, especially when he is trying to play his games of you go through the divorce and Tony married Pepper… Pepper would refuse to raise Morgan if that happened, which would give you the advantage of gaining full custody." Bucky's words made Steve lower his head, the tears finally running down his face as Bucky's words resonate in his head.
Clint sighs and throws his bow and arrow away and massaging his forehead trying to make the headache go after a long day in the ranges, he should have pestered Phil for a mission or something, because he was getting dangerously bored, but Phil got sick of him always following him and talking about Steve nonstop; it ended with Phil threatened to lock him in one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s holding cells if he didn't stop his whining.
"I will try and talk with Tony… I won't promise you that he will not go and sneak out with Rogers in the middle of the night like his threat implied, but I will try to talk with him, and advise him to slow their courting until we find Bucky, which may as well be the end of their relationship." Steven said which made Peggy take a shuddered breath at that.
"You!" The blond growled as he saw Anton standing in front of him like there was nothing wrong and that made Steven growl and let out a war cry as he went to attack the brunette with the pillow making the man shriek and dodge the crazy blond. "You cannot just stay dead can you?" Steve let out a growl as he attacked Anton once again, which made the man dodge once more.
"And do you know your father, piccolo bambino?" Maria asked which made the pup eyes sparkle at that, which took her breath away how similar the small pup was to her bambino when he was the same age as Peter right now, the pup looked around the place until his eyes fell on a photo frame on the coffee table, he then rushed toward the table to take the frame and return to the older Omega showing her the picture. Maria had to hold into her sob when she saw it, looking at the picture with disbelieving eyes, because here he was, her Anthony from a decade ago, smiling happily with sparkling eyes with no care in the world as he held his Omega closely toward his chest, she looked at Steve, only to see the pain in his eyes as he stood up and left the room, which made Maria swallow at that a little.
"Oh, look, there is the light switch!" Tony called out when he found the light switch, pointing the flashlight at it as he stood up, hoping that the light switch was not that of the forties, which made Tony wonder how he was going to change it and the electronic of this room. Turning the switch on, both Rhodey and Tony were left in awe at what they saw.
"Mommy, can Mr. Stark come over sometimes?" Peter asked Steve, making the Omega freeze in his place where he was washing the dishes. It had been three hours since Stark left the house after giving Steve the surprising news after nearly causing his death from asthma's attack, he was still angry at Stark, for getting him fired from his jobs, but as much as he hates to say that, but the Alpha had a good point, what he was doing was not healthy neither for Steve or his pup. But that didn't matter really and not his conversation with Tony after, what made Steve freeze in his place was Peter asking about Stark, it made Steve concern that the pup knew something or suspect that the Alpha was his father.
"Thor… Asgard, you need to return to Asgard; Thanos has made his move and he is going to attack Asgard!" Tony choked breathlessly when he finally reached his fellow Avengers. Tony's outburst caused his friends and family to let out confused noises, and for Thor's face to turn as pale as a sheet.
While Peter was busy sorting the cupcakes, Steve came and pulled Tony aside to talk; Tony couldn't be more thankful to escape to the living room, he is sure as hell doesn't want Peter to listen to his and Steve's conversation, especially when it considered Harley. Tony couldn't help but wonder what if it wasn't him who found the boy? What if someone else had found him today? Just imagining that caused a shiver to run down his spine.
OK… OK… so things got a little awkward after the kiss… awkward on Tony's end but still awkward. Part of Tony doesn't even know how to act around Steve anymore; I mean the man just kissed Tony out of nowhere! In a very creepy way, but still, it was the same. Tony was kissed without consent and he doesn't even know what to do! Should he scream at Steve? It never worked before and Tony doubted it will work now; should he hit Steve? Every time he thought of that the image of Steve's red face after Tony throw the holy water at him, flash in Tony's mind, making the genius more guilty than ever.
"Is that so?" Was the queen's amused response, leaving Anton grumbling in his place as he gazed at the forest, ignoring the splashes coming from the lake as the queen seemed to be moving. "It still did not stop you from peeping." The laughter was clear in the Omega's voice, causing Anton to hold into his growl, not wanting to show the Omega how truly embarrassed he was at being laughed at.
"Mr. Wilson…" Tony's voice trails off as he saw the Beta looking at him with guilty and sad eyes… No… Tony swallowed as he took a step after a step toward the Beta putting the gift bag on the desk; he then pulled the file toward him and starts reading through it.
"So how are you really, Stevie?" Bucky asked as he helped washing the dishes with Steve, Bucky still couldn't believe that he was standing here beside Steve, talking to the Omega and joking with him, he couldn't believe that hours ago, he met Steve's baby, a small kid who was too smart for his own good, but the smell of sickness surrounding him, he couldn't believe that the boy knew his name and introduce himself as Peter telling Bucky that his mother always told him stories about the Alpha, he couldn't believe that an hour ago he was sitting on the dining table with Peter and Steve sharing stories and jokes and eating dinner without a care in the world… it made Bucky wonder if this is what living with Steve meant, wondering if he would have had this if he asked the Omega out years and years ago, he wondered if he would have sat on this table sharing stories and jokes with Steve and his pup, but the Alpha shook his head at that.
"Who the hell is Ty?" Tony heard Bucky ask Peggy in what the older man hoped was a low voice, his question made freezing coldness surrounding Tony, and he raised his eyes to gaze at the older man with teary eyes, which caused Peggy to give her husband a nasty look.
Tony wrote heart beating like a crazy, usually Tony will leave his home for the clinic at 10 AM but if Peter and Steve were going to come with him, then the three of them needed to go to the clinic earlier, hopefully, Tony and Steve will be able to talk with some of the therapists about Peter and what's going to take a place with the pup.
Steven said finishing with wearing his pants and start ripping the top part of his dress, lips twitching up when he saw James's face flushed as he looked away from his mother, hiding behind the blanket, it was the first time his babe saw him in anything but a dress.
Steve looked at Tony as he heard the Omega's pained voice and he had to swallow at that. "He didn't, I handled it. Every reporter knows not to enter the clinic or take photos inside of it or there will be legal issues, that man tested our patience, too many times." Steve said which made the Omega let out a shaky sigh of relief as he leans on the wall behind him.
Tony was only grateful that he didn't lock the door when he decided to play with Morgan outside; it meant that Tony had easy access to the house before Rogers managed to catch him. slamming the door and locking it on, Tony curse how stupid he was for going inside the house, a house that Rogers knew the inside and the out like the back of his hand, a house that even when locked Rogers managed to enter without permission needed.
"Working on my armor, I want to make it stronger and lighter, so far I didn't find the component that will help to make the armor lighter." Tony explained as he let go of his tools, it was a time for a break, it was tiring working none-stop without a visible improvement insight.
"I don't doupt zat." The older man chuckled, his eyes becoming softer as he gazed at Steve, causing Steve to shift in his place at the fondness he saw in the older man's eyes, this was getting strange. "Vu schtill schouldn't pe
"…I wanted to come, Steve… I really did, but something happened!" Tony finally gained the courage to say, breath hitching in his chest as he said those words hoping that the Omega will understand… "I couldn't…" Tony finally said in a small voice which made the Omega turn to look at him with a blank face, making his blood run cold at that…
"S… Steve…" Tony could only mouth the Omega's name, his voice vanishing as he looked at the Omega who has a hand covering his face, looking away from both Alphas while taking deep breaths to calm himself down… Tony hated himself for not realizing the level of pain Steve was feeling until now.
. it was Tony's way of asking for a new start, that's what he probably meant by putting it in Steve's car. After all, the only other person who has the spare keys was Tony, and his husband clearly used them before getting back home. That was the only conclusion that made sense to Steve, especially when S.I. was five minutes away from the café Natasha and Steve went to.
"Sleeping, he tired himself from how much he cried… maybe the two of you should rest so that tomorrow you will have clear minds to be able to talk to each other." Steve whispered which made the younger man nod then pause a little.
Rogers on the other hand was frowning darkly, sending Tony dark looks before he let out a sigh and before his gaze returned to being annoyed once more. "Bucky is my mate Tony, I'm sorry that you believed there is going to be anything between us other than a mutual benefit deal, my mate is back Tony and he needs me, sorry." Rogers said in a tone that implied Tony should have known this from the start.
"P-Papa told me… about you two getting married." Peter said shyly, causing Tony to smile and give Steve a fleeting glance before returning his gaze to Peter who was struggling to say his next words. "You c-can marry him... c-can I… can I call you M-Mama?" both of Steve and Tony's eyes widen at that, Tony probably from the shock and Steve because he didn't think that Peter will accept Tony being his other parent as fast as he did not with what his boy told him not a few seconds ago.
"Stay back!" Tony cried out when he saw Rogers take another step toward him, a terror to slide down Tony's spine at the thought of Rogers getting closer to his child; Rogers only tilted his head in confusion at the words Tony spoke, taking another step in Tony's direction. "I said stay the fuck back!" Tony shouted, glancing around the place, desperately trying to find an opening so that he can run. "Dammit…" Tony cursed, turning around and running toward his home, ignoring how Morgan started to cry the farther Tony took her away from Rogers.
"I'm so sorry Tony, I should have warned you about Ty." Angie said as she came to check him over which caused Tony to give a small smile trying to reassure her which caused her to sigh tiredly. "Don't worry, I will make sure that he won't bother you again, dammit that lad to hell and back, it wasn't enough we had to put up with him drinking and making passes on people, now he is bothering you." Angie growled as she said that, turning to glare at the bar Ty went to.
The plan Tony has in mind was simple, or it would be if Tony made sure that no one will follow him, but knowing the town well enough; Tony counted that at least two to three people will be watching every step he took, which will increase his chance of seeing either Peggy or Bucky today. The plan was simple if Tony had to say; he knew that after Rhodey went to the town hall to ask about the Rogers family, no doubt Tony was being watched by the town; call it paranoia, but Tony knew that something was going on in this strange town and their lake monster. To keep his daughter safe it meant that Tony has to shed away the ignorance he decided to live in.
That night, Tony told Steve, Peter, and his family how much he loved them over and over, making Steve promise him to destroy the Iron Man suits that were left in the basement gathering dust, for Shield and Steve never found someone good enough to hold that mantra of 'Iron Man', he told Peter how proud he was of him and how much he was happy to call the younger man his son, he told MJ to take care of Peter and Steve, because he knew the two of them will always get themselves in troubles if someone wasn't there to stop them, he told his grandchildren how much he loved them and how much he was going to miss them… that night Tony went to bed with a wide smile telling Steve that he loved him three thousand…
.' Tony could only shake as he held Steve and Peter tightly, trying to banish the horrifying thoughts of losing Steve again. Disbelieve finally made way for hope and happiness, the joy of having the love of his life back was exhilarating, this time Tony would do things differently, this time Tony would make sure to protect Steve from anything that would cross their way and he hoped that Steve wasn't stupid enough to try and play the martyr once more. His family happy chatting in the background, made Tony relaxes and lets out a relieved and happy laugh… Steve was back…
Tony didn't even know how, but in the end, he ended up helping Barnes get his friend back after the annoyed man begged Tony for three days straight after Project Insight to help him get his friend back. And as much as Tony loved Barnes' begging, it was honestly getting annoying, so in the end, Tony agreed to help the man and in the next two weeks they were able to catch the Winter Soldier with no issues… that is, if you didn't count Barnes' broken face (Again).
It was a few minutes of the woman standing outside of his home, making Harley frown, wondering why the woman would stand in here for minutes without knocking on the door or leaving the streets. "Peter…" Harley called out, turning his head toward Peter only to see him too busy with Lila and Cooper to pay Harley any attention, which did nothing but caused Harley to pout and turn his eyes back toward the strange woman once more.
"I have to say Peter spends yesterday talking about Mr. Jarvis, it's a neat work Mr. Stark." The Alpha said as he looked down at the pup who flushed a little and hide his face in his father's neck, grumbling something, which caused Tony to laugh and followed Steve and Peter to their car, a family car that Tony smiled at. "The little one refused to stay in the car, going on about how he needed to say good morning to Mr. Jarvis before leaving." That got a squeak from the pup and a whine, which got a small laugh from Tony as he felt his heart fluttering happily at that.
His phone vibrated making Tony swallow and give Harley a smile before standing up from his chair, hoping that it was Betty. "I am going to order some more sweets; do you want one of the cheesecakes?" Tony asked as he pointed to the dessert the man from the next table was eating, Harley blinked his eyes and gazed at the treat before licking his lips and nodding his head shyly which made Tony ruffle his hair gently. "Just wait here, I will bring you a blueberry cheesecake, blueberry are your favorite, right?" Tony asked getting a happy nod from Harley who drank his glass that was half full with milk.
Well, in this story Bucky and Steve were together, in fact, they were engaged, though they did not mate at that time but were planning on doing so once the war was over, unfortunately, Bucky fell from the train… in this story Bucky Barnes did die when he fell from the train, you will notice when you read the second chapter, that Peggy told Steve that Bucky's body was found three years after Steve went into the ice and was brought home and buried, Steve used to spent his time visiting Bucky's grave.
"Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!" Tony chanted under his breath and he looked around the place hoping to see the Alpha so he could give him his pup and then make a run for it, damn Pepper and her cookie duos! "Ok, when was the last time you saw your father, Peter? I am sure if we were fast we would-" Tony was cute by the sound of a throat being cleared behind him which made him flinch and for his heart to nearly stop when the pup squealed and run behind him… too late now.
The trees had been cut down around the path leading up to the house, so it sat in a clearing, there had once been a garden of some kind it seems, but now the flowerbeds were choked with weeds and the grass has gone to seed, but Tony was sure that he will be able to restore the garden in no time, though maybe he will leave that to after autumn and winter pass. The house was smaller than Tony had expected from the outside but it looked homey, a small building with a porch out front overlooking the lake. By the shore, there was a deck, the wooden boards jutting out over the water, it was worn but still in a good condition, and a small stretch of private beach sloping down into the still, dark water... a house with so many potentials.
After explaining the situation to the woman, and one grocery trip later, the two of them finally returned to the mansion, with Tony glowing at the thought of finally getting rid of that crazy Addams and having his home back, Tony did tense though when he saw the man waiting for him on the front door of the mansion, and Tony ignored how the man glows with happiness when he saw him, no way in hell was Tony letting that crazy man run his house anymore, nor was he affected by his act like all of his teammates seemed to be, Tony was made of iron! His will won't be bent from a cute look that was sent his way by the possibly hottest man alive!
"Hopeful…" Tony ends up saying which made Winnie laugh happily at that and hug the Omega tightly toward her, which made the Omega give a halfhearted protest as the dirt that clings to Winnie from working in her garden transformed into his suit.
"Do you want to talk about it?" Tony asked only to get a headshake and Steve burying his face deeper in Tony's thighs; Steve doesn't want to remember, he doesn't want to remember the cruel vision he had to see, he doesn't want that crazy nightmare to become real. It was only a few minutes later that the towers' alarms started shrieking causing both Steve and Tony to jump from the bed, Steve could only watch in fear as his mind remember the scary vision that he saw, as for Tony, it was only a few second later before he was fully clad in his armor. "Steve! Go and find Peter, Jarvis would lead you to a panic room, go now!" Tony's command broke Steve from his panic, causing him to gulp and jump off the bed running straight to Peter's room, being thankful that Tony and he wore pajamas to bed.
Everything suddenly became quiet, there was no screaming, there was no laughing, there was no sound of skin slapping against skin and objects… the quiet was as loud as the bloody scream Tony heard just a few seconds ago, Tony could only shake in his place as he cried, Morgan whimpering and whining in his embrace…
"So you are finally awake, good…" The man in front of Steve sneered making Steve tense and glare at him daring the man to do something, but the man did nothing but pointed a gun at Steve, making the Omega's heart nearly stop, but the blond man gathered himself, listening to the Alpha's demands, something about convincing Tony to give the nuclear codes to Hydra which like hell Steve was going to let his Alpha do something as idiotic as that.
Steven hummed to himself as he opened the library doors, freezing in his place when he saw huge dogs/wolves? In the library, but what made him give a manly scream so loud that he was sure even the dead in Antarctica heard him (Scream not screech, thank you very much) is that the two wolves were actually fucking and were growling and biting each other. At the sound of his voice, the two wolves turned toward him, and Steven stiffens when the huge two meters blond wolf turn to him and growl while hiding the smaller one of the two under him… Steven wondered if he will be able to back away slowly and disappear without having something from him getting eaten, he wondered how these wolves even got here, I mean shouldn't the mansion be secured against such a thing?
The voice was gentle when he said that making Sam hum a little. "The worse…" He muttered tiredly after he went inside his office to close the door behind him.
He doesn't need someone to take his house away from him, he doesn't need someone in his land; it was his land, his right, the only thing that he has left, but everyone seemed to try and change that, everyone continued to sale his house and land over and over, ignoring that he was the one who owned it for more than fifty years. That doesn't matter though; he will give this boy only until he births his baby before letting it be known that he wasn't welcomed in his house.
Part of Tony was enraged, wondering how Betty nor Bruce told him about Harley running away from the place that was supposed to be a safe haven for kids and adults alike. "Hello, Harley, it has been a long time hasn't it?" Tony asked, smiling as he came toward the kid slowly, trying not to spook him in any way and cause him to run away. "How are you doing?" Tony asked as he lowered himself when he was near Harely, trying not to show how it made his heart hurt when the boy flinched and his eyes darted around trying to find an escape.
"OK…" Tony said as he took a step back, planning on making a run for it because he can't, he just can't. "Please, next time, go and threat Steve, he was the one who refuses to let go of me." Tony stated as he made a run for it, ignoring Natasha's scream as she chases after him and ended up turning into a shoe-size spider halfway to his workshop.
"B… Bucky is alive?" Steve's voice cracked as he asked that question, looking at Steven like the older man hold all the answers to the universe. "You married him, didn't you? He is alive in your universe, he didn't fall from the train, he is alive… why are you doing here if he is alive?" Steve screamed as he stood up, looking at his counterpart like he was crazy for wasting his chance with Bucky to return to this place, Steve knows that if it was him, he wouldn't leave Bucky at all, not like his traitor of counterpart.
A voice screamed in Steve's ear which made him gasp loudly and curl on himself, it was Edith, and she was coaching him on how to breathe, it made Steve give a chocked laugh that turns into a sob as he heard Edith calming voice coos into his ears. Steve didn't know how much time had passed in his panic, but he was finally able to breathe again, his breath hitches every now and then but it was better than before when he gasped desperately to get his breath.
"P-please d-don't… I... I'm p-pregnant…" Tony was able to choke out through the strong grip on his neck, hating how the person standing behind him just snorted and tighten his grip on Tony's neck causing him to let out a choked noise of pain, God, how much Tony hated himself when tears start sliding down his face when the man pointed the knife at his belly shaking it like he was mocking him.
Tony pout at her words, only to give a devilish smile later, causing Betty to narrow her eyes, and for Bruce to snort and turn his attention to Steve, telling him about baseball scores and all that jazz. "Fine then, if you won't tell me, I will have to hack the clinic security system, which won't be fun by the way; oh, and I won't go to the infants' room as I promised." Tony shrugged his shoulders; the bored expression on his face was hiding the giddiness he was feeling on the inside.
