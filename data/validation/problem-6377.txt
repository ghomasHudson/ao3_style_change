This wasn’t the first time she had found Peter isolating himself in the panic room, trying to stave off his demons alone. He often went there when he was experiencing a sensory overload or was feeling overwhelmed. It was no secret that Tony and herself were the closest to Peter; with Steve being a close second. Tony was practically the kid’s dad, and she wore the title of aunt Tasha proudly. They knew him the best and were usually the ones that found Peter and coaxed him out of hiding.
“Tony! Peter!” Steve’s deep voice rang out after the dust cleared, allowing the heroes to enter the building safely.
“Can- can I hug you?” Tony asked, unsure of how Peter would react. Hopefully, it would be a good reaction, considering how much the vigilante enjoyed physical affection.
“Do you think he’ll be a problem?” Most viewers were easily found, caught, and drained. But if this child was privy of their desire to find him or fought back... it would be difficult to subdue him. “It’s likely he doesn’t even know just how strong he is.”
Tony could only hope that the team got here soon. Because he wasn’t sure how long they would be able to survive here.
A massive, crushing weight sat heavy in his chest, pressing down on his lungs and squeezing the air from inside him. I don’t deserve him. His hands trembled. They wouldn’t stop shaking no matter how hard he tried to steady them, to steady himself. He collapsed onto the nearest workbench knowing his legs would give out any second. The immense weight of his guilt so debilitating he could barely breathe, let alone keep himself upright.
“Stay the fuck away from him!” Tony reached out in an attempt to grab his old enemy, but a guard held him back.
Tony and Steve never once left Peter’s side, providing emotional and physical support in the form of affectionate touches and soft reassurances. All of the Avengers attended in a show of support for their youngest teammate. Each hero wore some form of a disguise and stood scattered throughout the crowd to divert attention from themselves. Both Pepper and Happy hung towards the back. Neither one liked May, but they were there for the sweet kid that had so easily worked his way into their hearts.
But the waiting was killing them. All they could do was watch through cracked windows on the sidelines as their kid fought these psychopaths. It was beyond painful, but not in the physical sense.
She stood up and effortlessly pulled Peter up so he was standing in front of her. He stood just an inch taller than her, and it made her smile. “You know that Tony, me, and the rest of the Avengers will always be here for you. No matter what.” She wrapped her arms around him, hugging him gently, her chin resting on his shoulder.
Steve doesn’t waste any time. He instantly toes off his books and then removes his suit. He can’t help but notice the way Tony’s throat bobs up and down as he looks over Steve before he turns away to compose himself. Even Shuri looks a bit flustered and flushed.
The second they land T’Challa is waiting for them along with the entire guard. He has a concerned look on his face like he isn’t sure what to expect. Steve looks at Tony and sees the nervous energy radiating off of him.
The great thing about Sam is that he knows when to press him and knows when to let him be. As soon as they make it back to the house Steve take off to the garage. He grabs a jacket and hops on his bike.
His hand is like fire on Tony’s arm. It burns, but it’s hypnotizing. He hates it and he wants it. It clouds his mind. He shakes his head and breaks the trance.
“No, Matt hasn’t been by yet. I’m not sure who it is. He was in there when I came in. One of the other girls must have signed him in.”
There’s an understanding between them. It’s shaky, it’s new, but it’s there. They lay their heads down and fall asleep looking at one another, feeling Maria’s heartbeat steady under their hands. And that’s how they are found when Alana, Peter and the others arrive. Feet curled together, knees touching, hands intertwined resting on their daughter, lips inches apart, foreheads resting against one another.
“I can't even remember the last time I asked her about her life. About what’s happening or how she feels. I don't even know how her relationship with Matt is going. Which is a whole other issue I need to address.”
“Chemo…therapy?” Steve says in confusion. “Isn’t that radiation? Won’t that kill her?” Steve’s horrified.
They take a serious press photo and then it quickly dissolves into hysterics. The poses get more and more ridiculous with each click of the camera. A high pitch giggle cuts through the crowd and Steve’s breath catches in his throat as he watches a little girl in a gold and white dress with long raven hair comes running towards them. It’s her, Maria. She runs into Tony’s arms and he swings her around, sending her beautiful hair flittering around them. Alana’s close behind. Tony has never seemed happier.  The photographers forget anyone else is there and focus on Tony and his beautiful daughters. Not that Steve blames anyone, they are a sight, all three, tanned and beautiful. The rest of the night goes by in a flash and all hope Steve has for talking to Tony disappears with it.
Steve’s world collapses. He can’t believe what he was hearing. It can’t be true. He knows it for a fact.
“Papa, what was she like?” Alana whispers shyly, “Nonna Maria, your mother? You never talk about her.”
Steve sees a mix of emotions flash across Tony’s face. He can’t figure out what they all are, but for, for the second time since he’s been back Steve thinks he sees his Tony. It only lasts a second, but it gives him a bit of hope. He’s never encouraged Tony’s drinking, but tonight’s different. At least, that’s what he tells himself to justify why he’s pouring Tony another glass. And if it wins him whatever little favor he can get from Tony, Steve doesn’t dwell on that either. He hands Tony the glass and as their fingers brush against each other Steve swears he feels something. He looks at Tony hopefully, but if Tony feels anything he doesn’t show it.
Steve gasps and pulls away from Tony. He looks up at him with swollen eyes. “I have mine. I still have it in my room.”
“See here, Steve’s DNA has all these ‘blue areas’, which don’t exist in any other living thing on this planet. I am assuming this is the super soldier serum.”
when she wraps her arms around his neck. He hasn’t held any toddlers before, but he feels like Peter’s struggle is justified. She’s surprisingly solid for someone so small.
Tony reluctantly takes the phone from him and looks through it. He finds nothing. No missed calls, no voicemail. But it’s meaningless. Those things can be erased. Tony wipes the tears from his eyes and hands the phone back to Steve.
“She had a fever, I thought it was the flu, but it obviously wasn’t. She had a seizure and then she was put into a medically induced coma to keep her brain from frying.”
“I’m s- Look, Tony, I’m trying. I’m trying to figure out what I should say to you when my presence alone is enough to set you off. You won’t let me apologize-” He can see that Tony’s about to go off on him again, but he brings his hands up to stop him. “And I’m smart enough to know it wouldn’t make a difference at this point. But I’m at a loss here Tony.”
“Not intentionally, no. I won’t let her life become a revolving door. She deserves better than that.”
About 5 hours in Shuri comes back with another treatment. She goes about it the same way as before. It seems too soon for another dose, and Steve says as much.
“Don’t say that Tony. You aren’t a failure and if I know Alana, and I’d like to think I still do, I know she loves you more than anything. She just has a temper and she’s stubborn. Can’t imagine where she gets it from,” Steve assures him with a smile.
“You ever gonna tell me what these dreams are about?” Tony asks. Steve isn’t sure if Tony’s asking because he cares or because it would ruin what little foundation they’ve managed to build between them if she didn’t. Either way, he’s positive Tony wouldn’t want to hear it.
“Okay, lay down on your stomach,” she instructs. She must have seen the confused looked on Steve’s face because she pats him on the should. “We are going to do a bone marrow transplant. The virus has severely compromised all her systems. Your pure cells should reverse the danger, hopefully.”
Matt pulls her back into his arms and soon after Peter comes up behind her and wraps his arms as far around both of them as he can. They break apart and Nat comes over, handing Alana a cup of tea as she leads her to an empty seat.
Eventually, the press asks for a group photo. A man asks for ‘The Avengers and friends’ to which everyone agrees without much protest thanks in large to the aid of copious amounts of alcohol. The only problem is Tony’s missing. Steve does his best to sound casual as he mentions he thinks he saw Tony walk out towards the pond. And before anyone can offer to go find him, Steve walks off. He follows the path he knows well to the pond, but stops dead in his tracks at the sight he stumbles upon. Steve finds Tony sitting on one of the benches with another man. He’s tall and handsome. They’re sitting close to one another, whispering. Steve watches as the other man caresses the inside of Tony’s wrist. He can’t stop the jealousy that floods his veins. He’s one step away from making a huge mistake when Tony whispers something in the man’s ear that has him looking put out and walking away.  Steve backs away and pretends like he wasn’t there the whole time. They make eye contact and Steve motions him back to the tent. He doesn’t wait for him. They join the rest of the group and Nat pulls them to either side of her, front and center. They wrap their arms around her waist and Steve’s heart flutters when he feels Tony’s arm against his own.
“Master Tony called to remind me to ask you if there was anything you wished to request for the weekend grocery effort?  We can accommodate any request, so long as it can be found on this planet.”  Jarvis said mildly, Steve got the feeling that last bit was aimed at Thor.  Jarvis passed him a pad of paper and a fancy lapis and gold pen.  “Write what you wish to have purchased there, and I will see to it.”
date. Most people would have jumped on what he was offering without a second thought. He guesses that's his problem. Steve's not like anyone else. It's as confusing as it is the sweetest thing anyone has ever offered him.
After Iron man left, Steve sat.  He didn’t know for how long.  Minutes blurred together as he stared out the window with unseeing eyes.  The rush had ebbed, but for him it never fully left, and so he felt a clammy sort of sickness, his body poised at the edge of a cliff, perpetually unable to truly relax.  It couldn’t have helped that he’d gone into the ice while in a rush either.
beautiful. His own cock is so hard it almost hurts, smearing precome against the back of Tony's thigh in an pearly trail, but that hardly seems important with Tony writhing around practically riding his fingers.
It’s so good it makes his head spin.  Tony seems to sense his mood. He sits there, draped across his lap and whispering soft things, drawing him into short kisses while he pets through short cropped blond hair.  He feels almost giddy with it, reckless and unashamed to ask for what he wants; what Tony promised earlier in the night.
“Ceasing recording now, thank you for that. I am invoking the law of one party consent, as of now this conversation is over. Thank you for your contribution.” JARVIS is the best, Tony thinks distantly.  Hammer starts sputtering, getting right up in Iron Man's face. Or he would, if he could reach.
“No it's fine Steve, not like we haven't slept together before.” The devious grin on Tony's face suggests he knows exactly what sort of innuendo he's just made.
“Hey smart guy.” He calls up to their apparent holiday elf.  Tony jumps, head whipping around to stare down at Steve.
Steve blinks his eyes open, unaware of when they closed.  He noses over Tony's throat, along the sharp line of his jaw, smiling against warm skin when Tony leans his head back and closes his eyes. Maybe it's strange to sleep next to the person you're sweet on like this before you've taken them out on the town, but he wants it with such powerful intensity that is almost leaves him shaking. Cold, it was so cold on the train, and no one
Tony hummed, pulling his gloves fully on.  “Saving me again, big guy, I could get used to the special treatment.”  Tony blinked rapidly, pursing his lips.  “Not that I’m special.  To you.  Of course.”
“Don't talk with your mouth full.” Tony whispers against his lips, yelping when he gets a little bite in retaliation.
“Razzle dazzle Mister Stark.” Pepper answers, to the whoosh of JARVIS opening the glass doors. Yeah, Tony can do this.
Strange. Steve thinks as Iron Man produces a small notepad made out of actual paper. His movements are jerkier than usual, and his words are more clipped even if the voice is the same. When Clint flicks a paper football right between his glowing eyes there is no ensuing battle. Iron Man merely takes his seat, grabbing a pen from the cup in the center of the table.
“Steve were you out jogging in that?” He sounded a little breathless. Steve looked down at himself, he wondered if he’d gotten pretzel cheese on himself somehow and not noticed, but everything still looked clean and unstained.
Steve nodded, sitting up straighter, and giving Tony an encouraging smile.  “Oh, you’re seeing someone, trying to get in the family way, congratulations.” He tried to sound happy about it for Tony, he thought he managed it. He
“Hey boss, how's the date going?” Happy asks immediately, Tony feels bad for talking over him, but there's no time to gush about Steve. Which is truly a crying shame.
Sure, that would go over about as well as the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby.  Steve groaned, knocking his head back into the pillows.
“I meant, can I touch you-” Steve sounds almost abashed, but he doesn't let that stop him. “inside, can I, Tony, sweetheart?” There's strong hands running over his skin, gentle and loving. Tony knows without a doubt that if he says no, Steve will drop this all, scoot back under the covers and cuddle him until the day has well and truly started. Steve is good like that. Maybe he should have higher standards than a partner that takes a 'no' seriously, but Steve is so many things, most of them good, a lot of them stubborn and pigheaded. Tony loves him more than he ever thought he could love anyone. The thought of Steve touching him, maybe pushing into him, moving in him, yeah. Tony definitely wants that.
“Cap your arm is broken, closed break from the scans, but we can't just leave it like that with how fast you heal. Avengers-go scout around while we get this taken care of.” Iron Man says over the comms.  He hears several exclamations of concern, but confirms Iron Man's orders, they won't figure anything out standing around worrying about his arm.
.” It twists through his mind urgently. It’s panicked, harsh, lower east side accent ringing in his ears. Tony gasps, chokes as Rhodey lifts him out of the water, but the ocean is still rushing in his ears. Tony stares out at the water unseeingly as Rhodey shakes him, rubs his arms, grabs his face and asks him questions he can’t answer. He thinks of the plane, of gloved hands reaching, of the endless dark, of old soldier’s songs he can sing but has never heard. He thinks of flashing numbers, longitude and latitude. Tony blinks.
a prince after all; he's done his fair share of political posturing to go along with displaying his rippling pectorals to best effect and wrestling bilgesnipes.  He's smart too, with a sort of wisdom only an undying godlike being could possibly have.  Tony is really,
love a rapt audience. ''Pretty good, what's that one?” It takes a few minutes to try all of the flavors, mostly because Steve has the sweet tooth of a toddler and Tony has to chug water between a few of his more diabetes inducing concoctions. By the time they scrape the bottom of their bowls Tony is sailing on happy hormones and enough glucose to power a wind turbine.
that, didn't you?” Tony sounds delighted, fastening his mouth over his nipple and lavishing it with attention until Steve is squirming and panting with the effort of staying still.
There were more voices exclaiming all around him, but all Steve could think about was Bucky.  If he was alive then maybe Bucky was too.  He struggled into sitting up, eyes wild.  The world tilted before him, his eyesight blurry and warped as if he’d been sleeping for days or hit his head.  He paid it no mind, lurching to his feet, a red and gold blur reached for him, but he stumbled back.  The floor was warm and grated for drainage, the whole room was balmy in fact, as if he’d been taken for a temporary tropical vacation.  Where in the blue blazes was he?
“Close your eyes, just let me, let me make you feel good.” Steve says hoarsely, and really, why would Tony resist that kind of offer.
“Alright there Shellhead?” He asks, staring worriedly down at the reactor where more tiny hairline cracks have appeared on the glass.
“You know I like everything we've been doing.”  Steve says, breathlessly, already feeling his body react just with Tony's words.  “I don't need that, I-I don't mind being on bottom. Hell I, I really love it.” It had been a surprise just how much, how good it felt the first time.  Tony had been so patient too, so sweet and careful that it had left Steve gasping and overwhelmed with some emotion he couldn't name. Sure he's wondered what it would be like to have Tony that way too, but he's well aware he's well, probably too big too feel good for Tony, and he has never offered before.  Still, he remembers a few weeks ago, Tony getting him off between his thighs. Good God that had been something.
“You make me feel like I belong already.”  He says quietly, thumbing over Tony’s kiss swollen bottom lip, rubbing at it to watch the plush skin darken further, to feel Tony’s body lean into him more as if silently demanding more kisses.
“You love me.” Tony says, awestruck, turning in his arms to touch over his face wonderingly. “You really do, this isn't some joke.”
“What if he has that thing with him Tony?” He says softly, rubbing his thumbs over the delicate latticework of veins along Tony's wrists. “Have you thought of that? Even in the armor, it nearly got to Iron Man, cut through the metal like a can opener.”
. Tony thinks, burying his fingers in Steve's soft hair and letting himself be kissed into oblivion.
“What am I supposed to do? What use is a man out of time to all of you?” Steve licks his dry lips. What is he compared to a team of superhumans? What is he compared to something-someone like Iron man? Maybe he is a man beneath the armor, but the armor is
Afterwards, he laid there panting atop the sheets.  He was a mess, his chest covered in come and sweat plastering his hair to his forehead.  He’d lost track of how many times he’d come sometime after the fourth.  God he hoped nothing got on Tony’s blanket.  He’d been so desperate, so keyed up, for anything, any hint of Tony.  It was wrong of him, but he’d balled the heated blanket up, pressed his nose into it while imagining Tony was there with him.  The blanket did not even smell like Tony anymore, but that was beside the point to Steve’s lizard brain.
A single red rose-promises life long devotion and love. The red rose speaks of a love that is unchanging and does not wither away.
Tony blessedly didn’t press, leaving him to ride out the rest of the come down without any embarrassing slips on Steves part.  At some point the room got warmer, he didn’t know how, but he was pretty sure the heater was on.  He wondered if Tony had something to do with that.  The suite was quiet, he heard Tony walking around in front of the door in the sitting area multiple times, heard him talking out on the balcony instead of indoors, and even then in hushed tones.  When Steve finally emerged, there were take out containers waiting for him on the coffee table.
Outside it's snowing, Tony can see it through the giant windows. He wraps the fluffy blanket around his shoulders more tightly, clutching his mug of hot chocolate and taking a long sip to feel the pleasant heat warm him from the inside out. Behind him a razor thin television plays a movie that came out five years ago. Tony doesn't remember it, but he does remember the exact year and day it came out. The functionality of his mind is unquestionable. He
“Are you looking for me?”  He calls, staring out into the black expanse of swirling water.  The weight of the ocean is crushing him down, but he’s trapped.  Metal skeletons bear him down, glowing controls grow dark.  In that murky deep a pair of hands reach for him-gloved hands in brown leather-and Tony reaches back desperately.
“I'll um...pass that along if I see him before you do.” Tony manages, aware that the silence has stretched on a bit too long while he's been staring up at Steve with veritable stars in his eyes. Steve nods, stroking over his cheek wordlessly, blue eyes so intent on his face that Tony feels stripped bare; as if he could tell Steve anything in the moment, and Steve would say '
Steve shivered, pulling the blanket over his head and falling over onto the mattress on his side.  Seventy years gone, just like that, within the blink of an eye.  How did you even come to grips with something like that?  Everything he’d known, everyone he’d loved.  Steve clapped a hand over his mouth.  He was shaking apart, curling into himself the way he might behind the shield to save him from a blast.  The shield could not save him now.  It was still on his back, and Steve sobbed, rolled up to sit and slung it off his shoulders to thump onto the floor.  He didn’t know what to do.  Seventy years,
“Tony.” Steve says, leaning over his back again and kissing the shell of his ear as he works a second finger in. The slide is easy, Tony let's his legs fall open and loose on the bed, turning his head to watch Steve over his shoulder. “Okay?” Steve asks, short and breathless, and wondering as he spreads his fingers wide and slides a third into the space he's created.
Vaguely he becomes aware of someone crouched near by, only the smell of old fashioned cologne keeps him from flinching back violently. Steve is here, speaking in low soothing tones at just enough distance away that Tony doesn't feel the pressing urge to do something inadvisable.
“Did I miss something, is this some kind of villainous reunion tour, you all just couldn’t resist getting together for one last hurrah, like Aerosmith.”  Iron man was hovering above the street, his palms turned towards the chaos.
“Oh no, soup is swell, sounds perfect, I’m feeling a little cold, truth be told.”  he admitted quietly, even though it left him feeling off balance and ashamed. Tony sucked in a breath through his teeth.  His hands fluttered a bit, and then he pressed himself to Steve’s side as they exited the elevator, their shoulders rubbing together.
“JARVIS, is Tony angry with me?” He asks, after staring at the mussed spot on the sheets where Tony had slept the entire night.
“Hmph.”  Namor grunted, and sank beneath the waves with his guard, just as swiftly as he had arrived.
“Why are you dressed like Captain America?” Tony asks, curiosity breaking through the panic and confusion for a moment. “I mean that's an amazing costume, who made it, were we at a Halloween party?”
It couldn’t be, but it was.  Steve’s head was spinning as they disembarked from the submarine.  There were cars waiting for the Avengers, cars with no drivers, whisper quiet and humming with power.  The city was huge, sprawling around them in every direction.  The city he grew up in, it was a large city, but this, this was so much more.  The Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, where once they had been the tallest around, they were dwarfed by other, taller buildings, each reaching towards the sky in spires of steel and glass.  There were cars everywhere, or at least he thought they were cars.  They had four wheels and steering wheels, but that was about the only way they bore any resemblance to anything he’d ever seen.  He could hear honking, people yelling, sirens.  Well, at least that hadn’t changed.
“I always have been rather fond of you darling, I thought it was all terribly transparent, but I guess not.” Tony says, a little ruefully, a little breathlessly. Steve kisses him again.
Sometimes he wonders if that would have changed things.  If him being with his parents somehow would have prevented the accident.  If his absence had driven Howard to drink more.  It doesn’t matter now.  The rain drives down  as they lower his parents into the ground, Obie’s hand is heavy on his shoulder, but not as heavy as the dreams that night.
“Yeah. You're right, but he's not seeing anyone Cap. The bruises are from,"  Tony frantically grabs for explanations from his mental library of excuses,  "a...lab accident. Experiments can go boom when they go wrong.” It's not his best work as far as explanations of injury go, but it's what he has today.  Steve crosses his arms over his chest. It just makes him look more impressive. Sometimes Tony really appreciates being able to stare.
flirting with Tony-and even if he were to be really flirting, he couldn't really be too upset about it.  All that said, Steve can't help it, the scrappy little bastard he used to be wants to ask him what the big idea is. He doubts Tony would appreciate the possessive behavior, or the no doubt ensuing property damage. Besides, he
“Yeah, hot stuff, touch me.  Here,” Tony slips his hand away from himself and pats around the bed for the bottle of lube, popping it open with a click, “Get this on your fingers, honey, make sure I'm all nice and still open for you.”
“You, you like this color? You like the arc reactor?” Breathless, he's breathless. Their steps come to a halt-blue light filling the space as Steve turns towards him, eyes fixed on Tony's face searchingly-as if he knows this isn't just a simple question about color preferences.
“We're on the floor-how did we get on the floor?” Steve gasps out, leaning back against the wall to stare up into wide brown eyes. Tony traces his fingers over his lips, dipping his head to drop a kiss over the furrowed line of one blond brow.
“Can we make cookies, I always wanted to make those little gingerbread reindeer.” This time of year isn't always the best for people who grew up in tenuous situations, or who had less than ideal family dynamics. It doesn't escape Steve's notice that the people in the tower most into the spirit are Tony, Clint, and Natasha.
“Do not blame me, I'm not the one that promised kisses.” Tony says with a shrug, giving JARVIS and the armor a high five when he joins them in walking up the ramp. Steve laughs, squeezing him a little more tightly against his side.  “You find out what you needed, what are we dealing with?” Tony asks, once the ramp has closed behind them, and SHIELD can no longer eavesdrop on their conversation.
As ever your comments and yelling sustain me, and to everyone on the Discord just know that I love you all so much.
“Hammer, still alive and kicking, did you take care of that rash or does your face just look like that?”  Tony asks with false cheerfulness, stepping out from around JARVIS.
He had money now though, bank accounts left untouched for decades.  Tony had triumphantly informed him he had a big lump sum of backpay to his name as well as being paid by the Avengers.  He had some idea of what he wanted to do.  Of course the trouble was that Tony was an alpha, it wasn’t really common practice to give an alpha lavish courting gifts, but Tony wore jewelry, and in some of the glossy magazine photos he had seen of him, Tony had been wearing gloves, so clearly he eschewed traditions both spoken and unspoken.
“Well I don't know Mister Stark, going straight to marriage seems kinda fast. Guy like you deserves to be courted.” That was
"It is a fine food my friend, I would offer you some but I am afraid your faceplate defeats me on this day."  Thor says solemnly, the effect is ruined however when he spoons another massive bite of the sweet into his mouth.
“JARVIS, please distract me.” He says, raking his hands over is face to keep from reaching down and imagining
“Have you even ever been with a man before Steve?” He asks, all joking gone from his demeanor. A lot of people don't view their first time as something special, but Steve is from the forties. If Tony's going to do this, it seems like something important to know.
“Hey Iron Britches-” Clint calls, prompting everyone to stare over at his perch atop a frozen over sun lounger.
“Does he wear gloves?”  She asked, bending to retrieve another tray, this one full of all sorts of steady gloves, thin lace studded with stones.  “That might be too much of a statement, but they are very pretty.”
“Thank you green bean, you warm the cockles of my heart.” Mission accomplished he comes sauntering back into Steve's space.
“Okay, okay, love you all, but I have a meeting in,”  Tony lifted his hand, looked at his wrist, “two hours, and I have to jet.”  He chewed on another bite of the donut, Hawkeye threw a balled up napkin at him.
“I don’t need charity Mister Lorenzo, I’m good for it, got enough jack.”  Steve knew he probably looked like he only had a few wooden nickels to rub together, but he wasn’t about to start taking people’s handouts.  Other people could use that more than him.
“You're still hard,”  He slurs out, reaching down to get a handful of Tony's round glorious behind.  “haven't-haven't come yet.” Maybe Tony will rub off against him like this, take what he needs.
The endearments make him flush all down his chest the way they always do, but there's something in them today that Tony hides most nights. Steve steps closer, reaching out to wrap a hand around the narrow span of Tony's wrist. “Sounds good to me, but you're going to have to teach me how to work with your fancy ingredients if we're doing something other than boiled potatoes.”
Tony shakes his head.  “No it...I.” He squints down at their hands but doesn't pull away. “I have shitty circulation. Bum ticker, sometimes I just get cold.” Steve nods, sitting right up against Tony on the long limo bench and seemingly deciding to be his own personal hand warmer.
“Sure why not, let's science. But first food.” For such an unassuming man, Bruce can be shockingly commanding. Tony seems unaffected however, hopping off the counter to press a smacking kiss to the side of Bruce's face.
“Not this time, it’s well. Things that belonged to you. I figured out years ago that the army had a bunch of your stuff locked away, and so I um,” he faltered, before soldiering on, “I bought it, before we found you. Some of it’s in museums, but I kept some of the things that seemed more personal, letters, and,” he trailed off, upon noting Steve was staring at him. The warehouse, his things, he thought them lost forever, figured the army would have tossed it all in the trash after he was declared dead.
“We're here to offer assistance, if you need it.” Carol says, smiling at Tony when he gapes at her wordlessly.
dedicated to tradition.” Tony's eyes are bright and dancing, but he looks like he's gone a few rounds flat on his back. Steve stares at the man purported to be one of the smartest in the world incredulously as he picks up his ridiculous hat and adjusts his sweater.
amazing.” Steve says as he peppers his face with kisses, and Tony squirms but doesn't push him away. It should be sappy, it
The shower itself was astoundingly luxurious, especially given the last time he’d had one it had been in a barrack.  The floors and walls were done up in a pale green stone that looked almost translucent, milky and swirled with deeper green tones.  It was heated too, the floor warm beneath his bare feet.  He stayed under the spray until even his skin flushed red, and his fingers started to prune.  The linen closet was full of huge fluffy towels so obscenely soft, Steve wondered if they were made from some heretofore unknown fabric.
“Good morning, that's a pacemaker in your chest, and my name is Pepper.” She says, seemingly anticipating his next question. He wonders how many times they've gone through this song and dance. None of them seem surprised. Tony knows he should be terrified, his memories have more holes in them than Swiss cheese, an incredible super-battery is lodged in his chest cavity, and a guy with a shiny metal arm is apparently so common place that no one is staring at it. He's not afraid though, just confused and a little sore-as if he's been running a marathon. Or maybe having seizures. That seems more likely. He vaguely remembers laying on the floor and doing a whole lot of flopping. Fun times.
“Hi.” He croaks, cracking his eyes open to stare up into the worried brown eyes of a man in military dress. Tony likes him instantly, he hopes they're friends. He sort of hopes everyone in this room with him is his friend.
“Yeah here.” Tony motions all the Avengers over to a pile of shoe boxes, passing out green and red slippers to all of them.
He doesn't know how long Tony writhes atop him and kisses him, whispering sweet things and moaning while he opens himself up. Steve's concept of time is usually so accurate, each minute ticking by in Steve's awareness. Time hardly seems to matter now though, Steve lets it spin out without notice, loses it to the way Tony is moving atop him, the sounds he makes, the scent of him, the wet heat of Tony's mouth when he kisses him, the way it feels to have Tony blanketing him here on the bed. Distantly he realizes he's moaning near continuously, kissing any skin Tony offers to him, he can't find it in himself to be self conscious though; everything feels too good, and he wants Tony to hear him, hear how much he wants him always.
“I want in, I want a piece of the pie. Obie was dealing, and you might be playing house with superheroes or whatever the hell it is you do to keep your conscience clean but I
That doesn't stop him from thinking about it later when he's laying in his bed alone. The thought of Tony making those sounds while laying beneath him, or above him leaves him a sweaty, panting, frustrated mess atop his sheets with a hand guiltily down his pants.  Steve blows out a heaving breath as his body unhelpfully refuses to relax.  Well, he didn't have anything to do tonight anyway, he supposes.
“I know, we're Avengers, we don't give up, I'll find a way back to you Steve, honey, I promise.” Tony sounds shaken. He hates being alone, truly alone-no bots or AIs to keep him company. Steve shuts his eyes tightly, turning the covers back and stretching out on the bed.
“You will not, because as you have expressed on many occasions, I am your favorite-and as I am your favorite I have flown to Italy and brought you chocolates in your time of need.” In Thor's massive arms Tony stops squirming, fixing the Asgardian with a wide eyed stare.
“I did. I also said watching you work made me want to bend you over.” Steve says slowly, running his hands up Tony's stomach, feeling the taut muscles there flutter beneath his touch when Tony sucks in a harsh breath in reaction to his words.
It's kind of great. Tony takes one look at Steve, sweaty and probably grubby from his workout session and smiles like Steve's decked out in a ritzy tux rather than in need of a shower.
“Nah, here.” Steve strips off that soft leather jacket Tony was admiring earlier to wrap it around his shoulders. Tony tries to control the expression on his own face, but it must show at least somewhat, because Steve smiles, cupping his jaw and thumbing over his kiss swollen lips.  “Yeah.” Steve murmurs, cheeks pinking a little when Tony slips his arms into the sleeves and does up the zipper. “I like that. Looks good on you.” The jacket is still warm and smells of well worn leather and Steve.
It was good to pull his uniform back on, to strap the shield to his back.  He had not slept properly in days, but that hardly mattered, he’d run potentially deadly missions before with far less sleep under his belt, he’d manage.
“So that’s real, you really can, I dunno, feel what other people are feeling when you touch ‘em?”  Steve asked, eyes widening when Russell shrugged, affected and unaffected at once.
“I'm fine, I'm not whining, this is unnecessary, and how did Clint wrap me up in this blanket so tightly? I'm trapped in here like a caterpillar.” Tony appears to be making a break out of his blanket cocoon unsuccessfully.
“I'm going to tie your wrist up against the headboard, and I want you to hold onto the frame with your other hand. You won't break the tie, will you, mio caro?” Tony's voice is so lush, so rich, so full of praise that Steve can't help but suck in a shaking breath. “You'll be good for me won't you?” Tony continues, letting the red sash spill through his fingers to tease over Steve's flushed skin.
“Sir-” JARVIS interjects. “It appears The Grinch will be playing in five minutes, would you like to watch it.”
Something he would like to try?  For a moment he thinks Tony might mean more food, but then he takes in the lean of Tony's body against his, the dip of Tony's long dark lashes, and he realizes Tony means something completely different.
“Right so.” Rhodes says, completely ignoring him, grabbing a fruit cup from the fridge and gesturing at Steve with it.  “The question I have for you is simple. What are you trying to do, what are you after?” Gone is the look of casual friendliness on Rhodes' face. He looks every bit the hardened military man his chest full of medals implies. Steve feels like he should be saluting and shaking in his nonexistent boots right now.
“Oh well, if it's a bet then.” Steve says, tucking himself down and launching out of the garage with a screech of tires on polished concrete. Tony whoops with laughter, warm and snug behind him as the bike eats up pavement and they cut through traffic at a speed just shy of reckless. Or it would be reckless without Steve's reflexes. Tony just urges him on, gleeful and more carefree than he usually ever is. Steve doesn't stop grinning until they make it out of the city limits, and the road stretches out in front of them in a long ribbon of pavement.
“Yeah, you like it?” He asks, pleased he's made Tony feel good.  Tony flushes a little in response, rubbing his cheek against the fabric of Steve's shirt.
“Alright, let’s see what this old Betty can do.”  Steve said, shifting the car into drive, and putting his foot down on the pedal.  Tony whooped as they peeled out of their spot on the tarmac.
“Yeah, hug away, go for it, but no groping, I have to be presentable in a minute, Captain Handsome.” He wouldn't really object to a little groping, truth be told, but he's trying to behave.  Steve hums, pulling Tony back against his chest, wrapping his arms around Tony's waist and setting his chin on Tony's shoulder. Tony sighs, leaning back against Steve and resting his arms over Steve's where they drape low on his waist. Steve just holds him like that, kissing his cheek now and then, and stroking his fingers over the backs of Tony's hands until one of the organizer's comes back to give him the cue.
Tony doubts it. He's seen the reels-Steve underestimates the power of his smile and his ridiculous eyelashes.  “I Would have bought war-bonds from you babe.” He blows kisses at Steve and winks as he backs up towards the stage. The sight of Steve's cheeks going a little pink buoys him even as he flits around the stage and sells himself and his vision with words that use just enough guilt and self aggrandizement to get these people to open their wallets. It makes him feel slimy, but it gets the job done.  It's a little poetic too, when he thinks about it.  Howard drilled all these skills into him in, taught him how to be ruthless, how to press the right buttons, he doubts he would have appreciated how he was employing those skills now.  He'll never be the son Howard wanted, but he can do things for people who need it that Howard never would have dreamed of.  When he steps off the stage donations are still coming in, and that makes the whole performance worth it in Tony's book.
A low elegantly appointed couch offers a cream colored backdrop to the man curled up against it. Three glass tablets covered in scrolling data are tossed haphazardly on the floor. It looks like Mister Stark has fallen asleep in the middle of working on something. Steve blinks down at one of the slim pieces of glass, noting something that looks to be the sketched out lines of Steve's uniform. The rest of the tablets are incomprehensible, but that's not what has Steve's attention.
But even if he didn’t always know how to help, Steve always tried to be there for the young hero he saw as his own son. He couldn’t deny the hope that Tony would win the custody battle so he, Steve, and Peter could become a family. Not that they weren’t a family already, but having their relation solidified with legal documents would be a nice perk. And then maybe, just maybe, Peter would feel comfortable calling him and Tony dad.
A sparkling gold portal opened up at the back of the quinjet, surprising everyone. An elderly wizard they immediately recognized stepped out.
A hard slap cut his words short. The sudden movement and familiar throbbing sensation radiating from his cheek dispersed some of the fog. Don’t talk unless spoken to. Another rule he neglected to follow.
Peter’s hold tightened as well, though not so much that Tony was uncomfortable. Quietly, in a barely audible whisper, he said, “the little ballerina girl.”
The Avengers advance in their quest to help the young vigilante while Peter is left to contemplate his warring emotions.
And that’s what hurt Tony the most. The realization that Peter was used to guns, criminals, and dangerous situations pierced his heart like a knife. Peter was only sixteen years old. He should be worried about girls, his grades, and hanging out with his friends. Not desensitized to the dangers that hero-work brought. But here they were, being held captive by unknown assailants traveling to an undisclosed location where who-knows-what would be waiting for them.
It meant the world to him that his heroes were looking out for him and trying to be supportive, but that did little to reassure him. Because under no circumstances could anyone find out that May was neglectful, verbally abusive, and physically abusive. His problems were his and his alone. He didn’t want to burden anyone else with his issues, not after they had been kind enough to let him into their lives. Neither his friends nor the Avengers deserved to feel May’s wrath.
“That will be a while then.” One of the kidnappers growled. He wore an all-black padded suit, black combat boots, a helmet with a clear visor on the front, and was armed to the teeth. Various sheathed knives lined his belt, and no less than four guns were on his person, one on each boot and one on each hip. Six identically dressed soldiers lined the van’s carriage.
It took all of Peter’s willpower to fight the darkness calling him, beckoning him into a world of hate and anger. Hamir had warned him as a young boy and in the present. Peter could not, under any circumstances, allow the dark forces of the Unknown to take control of him. If they did, the darkness would use Peter as a vessel to bring about mass death and destruction. Peter was stronger than the undead. He just needed to make sure he stayed alive.
“I need to tell you… someone about this.” He scrubbed a hand down his face tiredly. “I can’t hold it in anymore, especially after today.”
The group of killers looked around, stunned, not daring to get up from where they had fallen. The woman in the hat, on the other hand, smiled darkly and sauntered back over to her prey. She looked up and found Peter’s gaze once more, the child at her boot-clad feet. Rose looked him in the eyes as she stabbed the scalpel into the little girl’s heart.
He broke a rule, the third of many enacted by the scientists to keep him in line. Address Mary and Richard as ma’am and sir. His pain-ridden mind was barely able to process where he was, let alone how to properly address his superiors. Each waking hour was a living hell. Peter never knew what form of pain he would be receiving. Whips, scalpels, starvation, frigid and searing temperatures, knives, and dog whistles were tools he was all too familiar with. Even something as mundane as a belt could be used against him.
He looked between Peter and the spoon expectantly, his excitement faltering when nothing happened. “Then why aren’t you bending it?”
“I care about you, too.” He spoke genuinely, lightly squeezing his crush’s hand. “But I’m okay. Please don’t worry about me.”
“Yes, Mr. Barton,” Peter grumbled quietly. Clint obviously meant him no harm, but it felt kind of patronizing to make him bend a piece of silverware on command. He wasn’t some trained animal.
Her hand found its way into Peter’s curly hair, tugging at the matted curls. “And what does that mean, subject?”
Tony hesitated just outside the Parker’s apartment door. A strong sense of dread filled his veins, shooting through his body like ice and shocking him to his core. Something was definitely not right.
The superfamily headed towards their car as the crowd dispersed, the Avengers trailing silently behind them. His friend’s and family’s support meant the world to Peter, more than he could convey through words. But there was something else he needed to do before leaving.
The guilt hit Tony like a truck, and he couldn’t help but feel like the biggest asshole in their universe. All he could do was nod, then headed off to find his kid.
Tony crossed his arms and pushed off the fridge with his hip, stepping closer to Peter. “I just feel like there’s more that you aren’t telling us.”
There was an arrogance to her words that Peter couldn’t help but laugh at. Even while staring death in the face, Rose refused to admit defeat. Peter would change that.
“Alright.” Tony clapped his hands together before setting them on his knees. “Okay. Has she ever seen you use any of your powers, Spider powers or psychic powers?”
“I’m assuming that I need to tell the rest of the team,” Peter asked once they pulled apart. A wave of dizziness hit him from not eating in the last three hours, so he was thankful that Natasha kept a hold on him. If he passed out, that would worry everyone more, and he did not want that. Because despite what the Avengers might think, he could handle himself.
Peter shook his head. “You know I would never do that. Plus, there were civilians around. Someone could have gotten hurt. We need to wait for the team.”
Rose advanced towards the meta that killed her family but halted abruptly. Peter was drained of most of his energy. That much was obvious. But she couldn’t underestimate him. She wouldn’t make that same mistake twice. Her arms drooped, and the hatchet made a resounding thunk as the metal hit the floor. It wouldn’t do her any good to rush into a fight, her friend’s deaths a glaring warning against that route. Instead, she elected for a verbal assault. With how injured and worn out Peter was, it would only be a matter of time before his body gave out. She just needed to drag things out and hold onto the hope that Peter would fall.
“He and his goons have bullied you for years. Even though you try to hide it.” Her hand found its way back into the honey-brown curls she loved so much, tussling the strands absentmindedly. “I’m the world’s best spy,” she smirked, “did you think you could hide it from me?”
Peter screamed, “just stop!” And all of the lightbulbs on floor eighty-six exploded. Everyone’s gaze fell to Peter, his thin silhouette illuminated by the full moon shining through the lounge’s glass wall that could be seen through the kitchen archway.
“And communicate with them,” Peter spoke softly, “sense them, and sometimes… remove them. I also have Telekinetic abilities.” He continued to wring his hands nervously. “I told you it was weird.”
Peter appeared in front of his wall of precious memories, guarding them against prying eyes. His skin was deathly pale, verging on white, and his once brown curls were now jet-black. Instead of the warm hazel they used to be, his eyes glowed white. He looked like a black-and-white version of his usual self.
The only thing he could be certain of was that his superiors enjoyed every opportunity they had to put him in his place.
“You killed Hammer to save me, Pete.” Tony did his best to reassure Peter that he hadn’t done anything wrong. But he knew Peter would still feel guilty.
Quietly, Rose approached the bed and the slumbering teen inside it. She picked up the picture frame off the bedside table out of interest. In the picture, a well-known billionaire stood beside a young teenager, the same one she needed. Lightly, she ghosted her fingers over the people in the photo then turned to the bed, glancing between the photograph and the boy asleep in bed.
“So I’m assuming these aren’t your average steel cuffs.” Tony snarked, glaring at all the guards lined up in front of them, hands-on their holstered guns. At least two dozen more armed men and women waited for them after they arrived, all armed to the teeth. Clearly, whoever wanted them was prepared.
Peter took a step forward in response, chuckling at how fast his opponents jumped back, flinching as if they’d get burned. “Hm,” Peter glared, “and so are you.”
Fix-it bots and other cleaning robots Tony had created were cleaning up all of the shattered glass and replacing the windows and other glass fixtures on the penthouse floor. It was November; therefore, it was getting very chilly in New York. Especially for Peter, who couldn’t thermoregulate. The combination of these predicaments was why the two geniuses were currently staying on one of the communal floors where it was nice and warm.
“She knows I’m a meta and that I have powers. But she doesn’t know the extent of what I can do. Not that she would care.” He sighed, voice somber. “It’s better that she doesn’t know.”
No one had the nerve to speak; the chilling news shocked them to their core. A viewer that could control their dreamscape was unheard of, let alone one who could easily manipulate Rose, the most experienced viewer in the world. There was no telling what this child was capable of.
Also, I use the term meta and mutant interchangeably. I just wanted to say that in case anyone got confused.
“It doesn’t matter… if I could get away. I couldn’t leave you, Mr. Stark.” Peter subconsciously scooted closer to his mentor, only stopping when the chain on his leg pulled tight. He could snap the metal like a toothpick but knew he shouldn’t. There was no way he could leave Tony in some unknown location with many armed criminals to fend for himself. They didn’t know where they were, so why would he run? There was nowhere for him to go.
A muffled snore drew his attention to the left. Tony was sitting beside the bed in one of those uncomfortable plastic hospital chairs, the upper half of his body slumped over onto the bed. Tony’s face was tucked into the crook of his elbow, the baggy fabric of his MIT hoodie dampening his snores. One hand firmly grasping Peter’s.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed heavily. He and Peter both shared a hero complex that left them feeling like subpar superheroes, more often than not. Always unable to live up to their own expectations. There was no arguing with Peter on this, but Tony’s patience had already run out. Maybe, if he hadn’t just been on an emotional roller coaster filled with all forms of torture, he would have handled this better. But it was too late for that now.
Steve and Natasha did their best to clean and dress any wounds Tony and Peter obtained during their kidnapping. Being Avengers, they were well versed in first aid and could treat just about any injury. But they knew that Bruce and Helen would be better equipped to address their medical needs. Peter needed an IV for intravenous nutrients to keep his body from shutting down and would need stitches for his deeper cuts until his healing factor kicked in from the nutrients. Tony, on the other hand, could get by with some gauze and a few butterfly bandages. The small injuries he obtained were in no way life-threatening.
“Peter!” Tony screamed as he pounded on the invisible force field in a desperate attempt to get through. But he couldn’t break in, even with the power of the Iron Man gauntlets behind him. Nothing the team tried was strong enough to dismantle the force field solidifying Rhodey’s previous assumption. The Avengers would just have to wait until the magical person removed the shield themselves.
The crack of Barry’s neck snapping echoed throughout the warehouse. The sickening crunch sent shivers down Roses’ spine. His body fell to the floor beside Sarey and Diesel, their necks twisted in a similar fashion while their mouths hung open in a silent scream.
Peter’s heart shattered again for what felt like the millionth time. “Hamir!” Tears soon accompanied his mournful cries. He almost couldn’t take it, yet another person was going to die because of him. And there was nothing he could do to stop it. The Knot stood about ten feet away, watching the scene with nothing short of amusement.
A quiet whimper escaped him at the sharp pain the smoldering paper brought. Peter fought his fight or flight instincts, forcing himself to remain still. If he tried to fight back, there would be hell to pay and there was no where to go so he couldn’t run. Multiple small burn marks soon painted his forearm, sharply contrasting against the paleness of his skin.
Just as her fingers touched the binding of a large red book, someone grabbed her outstretched arm and roughly threw her backward.
So, instead of suppressing his emotions and hiding out in his lab like he would’ve done before a cute little spider had so easily worked himself into Tony’s heart, he tugged Peter into a standing position and began walking back into the communal lounge. Tony knew that it would hurt the teen if he withdrew, and he was not about to abandon Peter when he needed him most.
Tony cleared his throat, fighting back the tears pooling in his eyes. No child should ever have to scavenge for food, fear going home, or struggle to live with a neglectful family. No one deserved that, especially not Peter. Squeezing his eyes shut, Tony managed to choke out a response, “no problem, Underoos.”
Blood, Peter’s blood, was slowly dripping towards him, sliding down the slanted cement panel in Tony’s direction. The blood, abandoned warehouse, and overall atmosphere had a classic horror movie-like feel to it. Not to mention the psychopath that was currently torturing his kid.
Rage shot through Natasha like lightning, sparking through her insides and shocking her to the core. The way Peter said it so nonchalantly. As if it were no big deal, a normal thing most parents did to their kids. But she decided to overlook that detail, for now, at least.
Crow shoveled one last pile of loose soil onto the shallow grave then threw his shovel off to the side. He smirked, “I highly doubt that. But I’d love to hear it.”
“Yes.” His response consisted of short, clipped sentences. “But it’s like with my other powers; she doesn’t know the full extent of what I can do. Not that it matters. She still thinks I’m just some freak.”
“You’ve seen death and destruction... and so have I. I live it. You told me to keep my feet on the ground, but that’s never going to happen! Especially not since you blackmailed me into helping you fight in Germany and then hung me out to dry after the ferry incident only months later. And the shit with the ferry wasn’t even my fault! I am in so deep now that the only way I’ll ever be able to get out of this life of hero-work is if I die!”
“Now, now, Stark.” Justin tisked, looking down at the billionaire condescendingly. He wiped the bloody knife he was holding on his shirt as he approached his old rival. Crouching down in front of him, Justin smirked. “I gave Petey the choice of who gets martyrized.” He nodded towards the injured teen, without a hint of remorse. “And he chose himself. Why I don’t know.”
Tony nodded somberly, looking away as his eyes took on a misty sheen. “Y-yeah. You were in pretty bad shape when we found you. I- uh, we were afraid you were too starved to be able to recover and that… that you…” his voice cracked emotionally, the tears he’d been trying so hard to hold back finally broke the dam, rushing past the floodgates and down his cheeks.
Because Tony wasn’t made of iron, as his father always drilled into his head. He was a human being. And humans could get bruised both emotionally and physically. And that frightened Tony. He refused to wear his heart on his sleeve, believing that, if you left yourself vulnerable, you would always get hurt. But that simply wasn’t the case.
“We’ll find him, Tony,” Natasha assured her fellow teammate, concern evident in her voice. She and Steve often played the referee’s role, stopping fights before they could escalate and cutting off arguments before anyone said something they would regret later. But she didn’t expect Steve to be at tip-top-shape right now and had no problem stepping up to the role of peacemaker. Besides, everyone was a little scared of her anyway.
And through the dizziness that threatened to pull him to the floor, the physical ache that reached his bones, and the gargantuan weight of guilt tearing him apart from the inside, all Tony could think was, I deserve this.
“Thank you, Mr. Stark, truly. I really appreciate it.” And he did, because it wasn’t often someone went out of their way to help him. Besides his two best friends, Mr. Delmar, and a few select teachers, no one was ever kind to him. Instead of being recognized as the gifted student he was, Peter got labeled a problem student because of the bullies that targeted him. Other SI scientists often ignored his genius, their inherent jealousy of the young protégé overshadowing everything Peter accomplished. Even Spider-Man got criticized, the Daily Bugle and anti-mutant organizations tearing apart his every move. Sometimes, Peter felt as if he couldn’t do anything right, his insecurities blooming under the constant judgment that plagued him.
“Is it alright if I ask a few questions about May?” He asked, hopeful that he would get better results by asking politely. “You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to. And I promise I won’t push you, bud. I went too far earlier.”
Tony threw his hands up in frustration. “I just want to know why you’re hiding things from us! Does it have something to do with May? She’s your aunt. Don’t you think you owe it to her to be honest an-“
“Peter,” Tony spoke up from where he was leaning against the fridge, watching the domestic scene before him, “I had meant to ask you something.”
“I wasn’t sure what to do. For the first time in a long time, I was afraid. I couldn’t move.” Peter clenched and unclenched his fists, pretending he had a stress ball in each hand. “She said that…” he took another shaky breath, “she said that countless people visit her here each year. But they never truly see. Un-unlike me.”
There’s fire in his veins, he’s angry. All of his pain and frustrations are bubbling to the surface. He’s going to use it. There’s going to be a reckoning. He runs back up to Maria’s room. He finds Tony suited up and standing guard inside.
It isn’t long before they hear Alana and Peter’s demanding voices. They sound put out and angry. Peter’s voice is an active higher than usual. Alana is almost all accent.
“I’m terribly sorry, you’re not on the list Captain. I’m can’t let you in,” she looks at him embarrassed and unsure of what to do next.
, Tony reluctantly leaves Maria in the care of everyone else in the house. Everyone is happy to take turns spending time with her, but more times than not, she ends up asking for Steve, which throws him for a loop, because he’s done nothing to make himself appealing.
So much for talking through his emotions. Rhodey would be pissed Tony hung up on him, but he can’t really bring himself to care. He rushes through his morning routine and pulls on the closest and cleanest clothes he can find. Rhodes was wrong. Steve gave up on them along time ago, and there was no way in hell Tony was going to let Steve waltz in and waltz back out whenever he felt like it. Over his dead body! He’s rushing out the house to get to Maria. He’s running through the entrance when see Peter walking by with Scott Lang.
“Look if they do find anything helpful the doctors will probably have to do something drastic like a bone marrow transfusion, okay? And then the big secret will be out. “CAPTAIN AMERICA KNOCKS UP IRONMAN!” Tony says fanning in hand across the air, mimicking a newspaper headline.
Tony, as it seems, is as busy as he led Steve to believe. But the lack of his presence doesn’t keep away any of the bustles. The house is alive with the sounds of family. Maria unsurprisingly is a big hit with everyone. She makes fast friends of all of them, quickly learning their names and any bit of information she can pry out of them. Despite his best efforts to keep away from her, Maria seems determined to spend as much time with him as possible. With Tony working and Alana single-handedly running the
“STEVE!” Tony shouts at him. His eyes shoot open and Tony’s voice softens. “You’re dreaming. It’s just a dream.”
“How much do you know about these guys? Maybe I’m just being paranoid now, but I don't feel right about this. How is it possible they still don’t have anything to tell us?”
Steve hesitates and looks over at Peter. “Listen, it would be so awesome if you could take her for a while. I have a whole bunch of stuff that I promised Tony I would do like a week ago. You’d be doing me a huge favor.” The kid actually looks nervous, and between the little girl in his arms and Peter’s anxious look, Steve caves.
Steve takes Tony’s hand and links their fingers and brings their hands to rest over Maria’s stomach. “I promise,” he repeats with force.
“Uh, you know I could come with you to the hospital,” Peter says doing his best avoidance techniques.
“Look I get it you’re upset. But please understand the circumstances. Those doctors? They weren’t trying to help her. In fact, it seems like they were the ones who made her sick in the first place okay. The hospital was a mess. We had to get out quickly once we figured out that they knew….” Steve is trying to get her to understand without saying it outright. He glances quickly at Peter and then back at her.
. Tony’s off put by seeing Steve take an interest in Maria. No one ever mentions her mother. Everyone mentions another parent. Alana’s mad at him. Alana called them both selfish.
Steve hits the gas, he’s pushing the bike as hard as it will go. He’s tempting fate, at this moment he’d welcome a fiery crash. All he knows is that he has to get as far away from the house as possible. He drives until he reaches a mountain and then continues to makes his way up to the top. It’s a fairly common place to go in the are, that is in the warmer months. The cold keeps most people away and Steve has the whole mountain to himself. He walks out to the edge and looks out at the view. All he could see is trees for miles. He feels small. He likes to come to be reminded of who he is in comparison to all the beauty of the world. He’s just one man, super or not. There are far greater things then him in this world. He sits down with his legs dangling over the edge. He has to try and make sense of everything that’s happened to him.
“No, I mean yes, but it doesn’t make sense. If this were true, she would have died a long time ago,” Shuri cuts in.
Steve stands there with no reaction on his face, where Peter looks between them like a bomb was about to go off.
The last time he saw her Alana was a 23-year-old grad student, alone in the world, searching for family, for a place to belong. Now she’s a strong, confident woman. Whenever she walks into a room everyone turns. She’s found the trademark Stark swagger and she definitely knows how to work it to her advantage. She’s so much like Tony.
“I know and I wish I had something concrete to tell you, but I don’t have all the information myself. All I can tell you is that she’s mine… and she’s Tony’s too.”
“No, that’s not what I’m saying. In no way am I suggesting that you didn’t do your homework. All I’m saying is that something didn’t feel right about the whole thing. I’ve seen that look. I’ve known that look and it has never ended well. My blood, the serum, it’s always going to be a problem”.
“How about with your daughter’s life?” Tony isn't throwing any punches. He has to use whatever he can to make sure Steve’s all in.
“She’s going to wake up,” he says out loud, not completely sure if he’s trying to reassure himself or Tony.
Tony comes over to him and takes his hand in his and squeezes. He feels a searing pain, but it’s gone as quickly as it comes. It’s replaced with a sharp pain that is followed by immense pressure and a dull throb. He wishes he could see what he’s feeling. He looks to Tony for information.
“Hello, could you please let the doctors know we have something for them. It’s urgent,” Steve tells the nurse.
Peter looks like he only took in about a third of what Vision said. Steve, on the other hand, hangs off of every word. The boy shakes his head in confusion and then tries to move around Vision.
He stands up and sits on the edge of Maria’s bed and pull the grey bunny out of his jacket and puts it next to her before he takes one of her hands in his. “I’m so sorry, Maria. I don’t know what I’m doing here. You’re so beautiful and brave and kind. You deserve better than this. I wish there was something I could do.”
From the moment he was pulled from the ice, no, from the moment he met Tony his life went upside down. Tony. How could one man so drastically change his life, his world? He never understood it when people said they were consumed in relationships, but after Tony it makes sense. Tony infiltrated every aspect of his life, every aspect of his mind. After all he’s been through, Steve never thought he’d welcome the invasion with open arms. But Tony did something no one else could. He managed to get Steve to open up, unknowingly and completely. He’s seen the darkest corners of his mind, he’s seen all his flaws, and loved him still. He loved him for who he is and not who the world sees him as or expected him to be.
“We aren’t sure. Seizures are usually symptomatic of something else. Which is why Tony and Alana are still in with the doctors.”
The fire alarms turn off and the sprinklers stop. Steve walks over to a cabinet filled with different bottles. He pulls them out at random and throws them around the room. He reaches into his jacket and pulls out a Zippo lighter he found at Tony’s and flicks it open. He watches fear spread across the doctors’ faces as he drops the lit lighter onto the floor. The room is instantly engulfed in flames. The doctors start to shout for help. It a chorus of desperate cries, but Steve feels nothing. He walks out of the room and makes his way towards the elevators. The doctors barge out the door behind him.
“I prayed for help. Things with Steve were terrible. I saw the writing on the wall and I felt so lost,” Tony answers as he rubs his face. “I know you think that our problems started with the Accords, but we had a problem before that. There were little things that just got bigger and bigger. Everything that happened at the end was the breaking point.”
They are given scrubs, hairnets, masks to put on as they enter the lab. No one is allowed in without them, not now, with Maria’s immune system being practically non-existent.  The eerie silence of the lab highlights the beeping of the monitors on Maria. The four of them stand like statues as they wait for Shuri to address them. Steve sees King T’Challa standing in a far-off corner, he stands still and straight, but his eyes betray him. He is just as anxious as the rest of them.
Swear! Ha! Do you think there’s anything in this world you could swear on that would make me trust you again? Trust you enough to let you near Maria. To let you be a part of her life?”
“They’re your children,” Okoye says. Steve pretends he doesn’t hear the change in her voice when she says your. “They are at our borders, fighting to get in.”
"Where are you going?" a voice calls out from the shadows. No one knows how to lurk in dark corners like a Stark. He watches as Alana emerges into the light.
Tony is tired. He’s tired of always worrying, of being angry all the time. He looks Steve with Maria and wants to believe what Steve is saying, but he can’t. He wants to believe Steve’s story, but it’s too convenient. How can he just let Steve walk into his daughter’s life? Steve just said he’d do anything, but what about The Accords. They would keep them apart. Steve would never sign and Tony isn’t sure he even wants Steve too. If he did it would be for the wrong reasons. Tony’s always admired Steve’s resolve. It was one of the traits that made Tony love him. But it would keep Steve away. How can he subject Maria to that kind of life? How can he call himself a good father knowing too well how it feels to live that kind of life?
“That ‘boy’ is a man in his thirties and a lawyer.” There’s a lightness in Tony’s voice Steve hasn’t heard in a long time. It’s strange but welcomed. He sends a silent thank you to God for allowing them a bit of peace.
“I don't know what else to do. I had the phone on me at all times. It never rang not once. I had it…..” Steve’s lament ends abruptly. “I didn't. I left in my room during my workouts. Someone, someone could have erased the calls couldn't they?”
“No,” Tony says with a horrible sinking feeling in his stomach. He isn’t sure he wants to follow Steve down this particular rabbit hole.
After his failure, Steve doesn’t try to get Tony alone again. He got the message loud and clear. Steve no longer has a place in Tony’s life and it’s never more apparent than when Steve observes the ever-growing Stark family. Tony isn’t alone in the world, as he’d once felt he was. He’d taken young Peter under his wing. Alana, who he believed once loved them equally, in the end, had chosen Tony without hesitation. It wasn’t as though it was much of a choice once they found out she wasn’t Tony’s sister, but his daughter. Once, Steve had foolishly thought that Alana’s parentage was the most shocking thing that could happen, and then Maria came along. He tries not to dwell on painful memories, but a part of him likes it. It’s like poking a bruise. It hurts, but it also feels good. It occurs to Steve that line of thought isn’t the healthiest and so he distracts himself by spending time with the family he knows he’ll lose again.
Tony thinks over his pregnancy, the secrecy, the lies. He looks over at Maria and thinks about the day she was born. Steve is so close to him Tony can smell his cologne. He’s still intoxicating. The familiar scent is lulling him. He wishes Steve had been there. His heart aches, but so does his body. Tony’s head feels as though it’s been split open. The feel of warmth and calmness that emanates from Steve makes his limbs relax and his eyes heavy. He hates that being near Steve still inspires comfort, love, and safety in him.
“Yes,” Tony shoots back instantly, shattering Steve’s heart. “No… I don’t know anymore, Steve. This is hard for me to find you here with her. It’s confusing. I don’t know what you’re looking for or want. You have to understand why it’s hard for me to hear you talking about her like that. With everything that’s happened, I don’t want her to get hurt.”
“I have to go. I’ll explain everything later, but right now I have to take care of something,” Steve says before he rips the tracker off of his watch and races back to the hospital.
Steve’s gut twists in knots. It feels like all the missing pieces of a puzzle he’s been trying to solve are dangling in front of him. He knows they’re there, but he’s too afraid to reach out for them. He isn’t sure he wants to solve this puzzle anymore. He leans against the wall beside the door and slides down it. His chest getting tighter by the second. Was it possible for him to have a heart attack? He imagines what he’s feeling is as close to one as he’ll ever get. He brings his hands up to his chest, clutched over his heart.
“You have to talk to him, Papa. This is crazy,” Steve listens through the door as Alana speaks. Her voice is filled with desperation. Her accent getting thicker the more she pleads.
“I’ve - It’s…” Steve wants to tell him how much he’s missed him. How he still hasn’t gotten used to sleeping without him by his side. How much he misses the conversations they had, hell even their arguments, but Tony stops him before he can even begin.
Steve’s ears perk up at the mention of her birth. Steve was still trying to work that bit out. No one mentions Maria’s mother, not even the girl. He wonders what it could mean. He hopes Peter will unknowingly fill in some of the gaps for him.
He doesn’t like to talk about his mother, but how can he deny his daughter knowledge of her grandmother. Especially, when neither of them have the luxury of forgetting family.
“I will do anything to fix this Tony. And when I find out who did this, who hurt us! Who put our daughter in danger I’ll kill them.”
He watches as Alana takes his seat next to Maria’s bed. He watches as she kisses her little sister’s hand.
“Yeah,” Wanda responds. “We’ve been trying to get her to eat something so she can take her medicine again, but she just won’t do it.”
Sorry about the delay. I'm still alive, but you know life keeps getting in the way. I apologize this is so short, but I needed to through the medical stuff as fast as I could so quite frankly I could move onto more interesting things. Like the boys learning how to co-parent. Steve and Maria getting to know each other as father and daughter and Tony fighting himself and trying to let Steve be.
“Yup. I came to visit you and Papa. Do you know you’re the first baby I ever held?” Peter tells her as he attempts to cradle her like an infant. “Yeah, you were definitely lighter then.”
She types furiously at her computer before she tells them that Maria is currently with the doctors in the pediatric ward. She lets them know they are all welcome to go up to the second-floor waiting room. Steve thanks her before making his way to the elevators. The rest follow him. There are people staring and taking pictures, but Steve can’t bring himself to care. It’ll only be a matter of time before the media circus begins. Steve clenches his fists in anger as they all silently pile into the elevator. The ding! of the elevator is jarring. The doors open and they are greeted with a wall decorated with characters from children’s books and movies, some Steve recognizes and other’s he doesn’t. Somehow they make the whole thing worse.
The more time he spends with Maria, the more he realizes she’s not like other children. It’s a cloudy day, which means Steve can’t take Maria out and that’s fine because Maria’s been sick for a week with a fever and spends most of her mornings curled up in Tony’s arms, fussing and crying. Tony made the decision to work from home, understandably not wanting to leave his sick child. On this particular morning, he leaves Maria in the care of Clint, Wanda, and Nat. The medicine they give her slows her down considerably and Steve isn’t a fan. She doesn’t behave like the little girl he’s come to know. He walks into the living room to find Maria pouting, her little forehead shining as she pushes Wanda’s offering of crackers away.
“I did. It is a blood sample from Maria’s other parent. I’ve isolated some the more relevant information in the sample,” Tony explains.
“It’s okay, angel. Go to sleep. Me and Daddy will be here when you wake up,” Tony tells her. She looks between the two of them. Steve nods in agreement.
“Alana, please. So what he came on this own? It means nothing. It doesn’t change anything. He isn’t going to stay. He made it very clear, from the beginning, he doesn’t give a shit about us. Whatever this is? It’ll end. I won’t let him come and go whenever he pleases. I know what that feels like, to never feel good enough, Maria deserves better than that!”
Tony gets up before he does and rushes towards the door. “It’s fine. Stay. I should go to sleep. Alana’ll kill me if she finds out I spent the whole night drinking in the living room.”
He knows he should, but he doesn’t bother with a helmet, he’s too tired to hold up pretenses. The cold morning air stings his face. It feels like hundreds of tiny shards of glass are cutting into his skin. Deep down some sick part of him enjoys it. The good old Catholic boy inside him that tells him he deserves to be punished. He makes a stop on his way. As he pulls up to the hospital and sees the reports he goes around back and hides his bike in a different parking lot before he sneaks in without anyone knowing. The last thing he needs is his picture taken. He heads straight for the pediatric ward.
It is approximately 11 hours later when Tony comes back looking completely unrested. Tony takes one look at Steve and says, “Don’t. I know I look horrible. I don’t care.”
Hours pass and none of them move. They hover over her and yet Maria doesn’t open her eyes. He can see the worry and the panic begin to set in Alana and Peter’s eyes. Eventually, when he just can’t take it anymore and he knows Tony is about to burst from the anxiety radiating off the two of them he sends them away to get food.
After his conversation, if one could call it that, with Tony, Steve finds it hard to do anything for the rest of the night. He wanders around the living overanalyzing everything Tony said to him until his head starts to hurt. After a while, he sits down on the floor next to the sofa and holds one of Maria’s shoes he found in his hand. At some point, while he stares at the shoe he’s overcome with the need to go to her.
Tony is proud of himself for being able to get through the whole story without breaking down. It seems like that’s all he’s been doing lately.
“Hi beautiful, hello angel,” Tony says in between kissing the top of her head and her cheeks. “I love you so much. So so much. My God, I love you.”
Steve sits down as Tony goes over to a drawer and gets out a needle and a tube. He doesn’t think too much on the fact Tony had a needle strong enough to pierce his skin already prepared.
“Thank you, Daddy,” Tony corrects her. She looks at Tony in confusion but seems to recover quickly. Tony has tears in his eyes.
Steve looks up from his resting place and realizes that he’s been there before. It was spring the last time he was there. People were laid out all over the grass enjoying picnics. Tony brought him to see the view of the United Nations. It had been a beautiful day.
Tony rolls his eyes and sighs. “You can’t still be this naive!” Tony walks over to Steve and flicks him in the head. “Think Steve! You can’t just waltz into the hospital and say hi I’m Maria’s other biological parent.”
“Oh, sorry,” Steve says, starting to relax. “I wasn’t expecting…. honestly, I don't know what to expect from you anymore.”
Tony grabs a chair and sits down next to Maria and Steve follows suit. Steve couldn’t imagine either of them leaving her side. They barely notice as a curtain is pulled around them for privacy. All they can do now is wait.
After Steve confronts him, Tony’s positive having the team stay with him at the house is a big mistake. Steve thinks that he can just give Tony apologies and sweet words to make up for everything. He analyzes Steve’s every movement and watching him act like Maria is just some stranger he has to get used to is heartbreaking. But at the same time, he’s relieved, clearly, Steve doesn’t want anything to do with her. Which means he’s not there to hurt her by pretending he can be anything real to her. The Accords takes up too much of his time. Everyone wants him to be present. A few days in when it became apparent that Tony would have to leave Maria he hates every minute of it. He doesn’t want to leave her in there house with Steve, but he doesn’t have much of a choice. He’s out of options, with Rhodey going to meetings with him and Alana busy running the foundation. He does feel slightly better about leaving Maria after his talk with Nat. He knows the others will look after her.
Alana’s always a safe bet. Steve’s never seen Tony more at ease than when he’s talking about his daughters and Alana’s everything anyone could ever ask for in a daughter.
Steve is staring out the large windows when it finally happens. Tony has long since fallen asleep in a chair next to Maria’s bed, his head resting on the mattress. Her voice is so soft, so quiet he almost misses it.
He takes one of the many bikes Tony had given him over the years. He’s surprised they are all still there. His garage is frozen in time. Everything is exactly the way he left it, as though Tony closed the door and never looked back. He rolls the bike all the way down the back road before he turns it on. Sneaking out of the house makes him feel like he’s doing something wrong.
Steve stands off to the side and behind him. It’s awkward, but T’Challa doesn’t let it affect him. He walks over and greets Tony.
“I - I came to see Maria,” Steve fumbles. She looks down at the bunny in his hands and smiles at him. She takes his hand in herself and gives them a squeeze. She looks like she might cry. They haven’t had much of an opportunity to speak and Steve desperately would like to, considering every time he sees her he feels like she’s on the verge of making a confession. He misses her company and her confidence.
“Exactly. I don’t know about anyone else, but I’m starving and my goddaughter’s making those pancakes look awesome,” Rhodey thankfully interjects, breaking the strange silence. Steve clears his throat and aggressively begins piling food onto his plate.
“Please, Tony. Don’t do this,” Steve sobs. “You can’t. She’s mine too. I want to help. I want to be a part of her life. You have to believe me. Tony if I had known I would have come to you. I never got a call. You have to believe me. You have to. How can I prove it to you?”
“Oh, no,” Steve whispers gently onto the top of Maria’s head. “That’s not good. We need to take our medicine.”
“And suddenly you’re an expert on being a father? Alana had a grand childhood, did she?” Steve spits back, venom lacing every word.
“How can I not? Sometimes things just happen. Things that are outside of our control. She’s strong and you need to stay strong for both your daughters.”
He turns away from her and starts the bike. He can’t deal with her right now. He can’t deal with anyone right now. His skin feels too tight and he feels like the walls are closing in on him. He has to get away. He drives off with her yelling at him.
“That’s right, I do know how much it hurts, but I don’t think you do! Our mothers died, Alana. My father, he walked away, he washed his hands of me and that hurt more than death. They were taken from us, but he chose to leave,” Tony argues. “Everything I do is for you and Maria. I’d give my life for you.”
Steve’s not even halfway through the sentence when Peter’s taking off down the hall, shouting his thanks.
Steve watches as a man brings Shuri a drip bag filled with a clear substance. “Other than a stomachache and a headache, the process is painless. I will be back later to check on her. There is a room prepared for you.”
One of the people on the plane walks over and hands Shuri another device. They watch as she lifts Maria’s hand and pricks her finger. The results instantly show up.
“That’s fair. I want you to understand, you are welcome here, for however long you need. Please know no one will pressure you for information, but I do need to know if there is any potential danger towards you and if it should affect Wakanda.”
“I am mad at you, there is so much that has to be discussed, but it isn’t more important than our sister. Your daughter,” Alana forcefully tells him.
The next few days pass in exactly the same way. Steve and Tony rotate their vigil next to Maria. They sit and watch as Shuri and others on her team give her treatments and other medicine to help ease the process along.
“PAPA!,” they hear Maria cry from the dining room. “PAPA, WE HAVE PANCAKES!” It’s followed by a squeal of unbridled joy that brings a smile to all their faces. Tony, however, looks horrified.
As they speak, Steve watches as a group of people in white coats walk down the hall towards Maria’s room. Steve knows they must be the specialist Tony had mentioned. They call someone out. It’s Alana. She nods to the group and then closes the door behind her. She looks over and spots him. She has a nervous look on her face as she excuses herself and walks towards him.
“There’s gotta be something we can do. There has to be,” Steve says desperately. He looks over to see Tony staring at him questioningly.
“This is it,” Shuri says as she changes out one IV bag for another one. Only this time the bag she’s hooking Maria up to is filled with Steve’s bone marrow. “Remember this has never been done. We don’t know how long it will take to see change if any,” she cautiously adds.
“Were you scared? I can’t imagine going through all that alone,” Steve is pressing his luck, but  Tony gets it. This is possibly the only time he’ll get the chance to ask any of these questions and actually have Tony answer them.
“Good job, baby,” Tony praises her and kisses the top of her head. Maria then reaches up and pulls Tony’s face close to give him a kiss. It’s perfect in the way only a kiss a child gives a parent can be.
Steve spins around to face him. Tony’s filled with so much anger, it kills him and Steve is just exhausted, too exhausted to fight, too exhausted for all of it.
That wakes Steve up. Our kids. Steve’s heart clenches in his chest. He tries to stomp down his hopefulness. Tony is tired, he’s not really thinking about what he’s saying. He doesn’t mean it, Steve tells himself.
