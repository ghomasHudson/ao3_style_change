"Dammit!" Tony cursed. "That fucking bunny is behind this!"
He did not even know what state of mind the man was in right now. Before what happened happened, Tony had it set up where if Barnes was feeling up to it he could see Tony freely. Now, however, there was no way in hell the soldier would come to the genius willingly. So, it stands to reason that it was Tony that needed to be the one to step forward and begin the process of hashing things out.
Steve couldn’t explain it but he knew without a shadow of a doubt that he deeply loved this child also.
“Jealous?” Steve poked.
“Spiderman is down. He’s with Natasha on the outskirts. I talked to Tony, a second team is heading our way!”
Chapter 12: What I Have Endured
“Why do you ask?”
He stuffed paper into all of the boots seeing as they were all a bit big for the small children. They looked odd but the rubber should protect them.
He quickly began the arduous task of connecting what was left of his suit to his arc reactor. He kept forcing his attention back to the task at hand but every time he put a wire into place, his attention was diverted. He was constantly hyper aware of the battle around him. His team fighting off the hoard of doom bots and getting zapped by the zappers. The mother was also vying for his time. Her wails of glee reverberated now that she has mostly materialized.
Steve climbed up onto the railing of the rafter.
“Anyway, when I mount the arm it will click into place but won’t be connected. I’ll let you get used to its weight before moving on to step two. You ready?”
"Honestly, I don't know what to think now."
“What?”  Steve asked looking at Tony face.
“What was that you idiot!?” She wailed as he punched him five times in the arm to emphasize each word.
Tony watched idly as his bots worked slowly but meticulously to clean up his thoroughly trashed workshop. He sat upon a wobbly stool that was missing a leg. He teetered back and forth on its uneven legs watching his bots with a blank expression, completely drained. Dumm-E was picking up fine machine parts and separating salvageable bits from the shattered remanence of glass. Butterfingers was manning the more heavy lifting, up righting tables and various other equipment. There were other smaller maid bots vacuuming debris and other particulates.
“Why, what happened, Tony?  Did the simulations work?”  The Captain inquired to the genius.
“Wow.” Barnes murmured.
Tony gaped at the prisoner shocked that they still had the balls to be so damn insolent despite there obviously craptacular confinement.
“The cityscapes at twilight?”
"How do you stop it?" Widow asked.
"You'd like that wouldn't you?" Tony growled despite the overwhelming ice cold fear pulsing through his veins. "How about you beg me to stop instead."
Now this Revelation had truly taken Tony aback.
"Of course, it is, I'm right here." She said tugging his hand for emphasis.
His tone was forlorn, and Tony’s heart sank.
“You’re a freaking jerk! It just slipped out.” Steve replied with a bittersweet smile. He could recall dozens of times where they had that exact same conversation.
"Yeah, Babydoll?" He tried to sound reassuring.
He smiled and nodded. Then he began to add small touches of the pink to bring out the light.
Tony groaned loudly. If Steve could see his face he’d bet the genius was rolling his eyes with every bit of attitude he could muster. He shook his head sadly.
Suddenly, Tony was sucked out of his torment by a series of resounding explosions. He snapped his head to the sky and watched as the helicarrier went down in a fiery blaze.
“You’re coming with me!”
“We’ve already established that I am an impulsive nutcase.” Tony shot back instantly. “This should not be a surprise.”
“I actually have a surprise for you.”  He said excitedly, his grin not unlike his own.  “I hope you don’t mind me bringing them here, they just couldn’t wait to see you.”  He stated still excited.
Her death was instantaneous.
“Keep me posted.” Tony commanded.
How on earth was he going to find him? There was no telling where he could be at this point in time. The others sure as hell weren’t going to simply let Steve go gallivanting off to find him. To be perfectly honest he was sure they would force another kind of house arrest on him.
“I will stay, we still have a procedure to finish.” She said nodding to Barnes.
“Steve?”
~-0-~
"Yes, Steven, your world has passed… Barely."
“What up Cap?” He sounded out of breath.
He took a deep breath a little calmer now, he addressed Tony.
"As you wish." He said.
"What's the deal with these ones." Barnes asked.
“Your eyes are a pale blue.” Was all he said.
“Mr. Stark! Our guest does not want to hear your quip so early in the day!” Fury reprimanded fervently as he entered the room behind Tony.
His mind was clearer than it had been in what felt like weeks.
Sub unit number two launched another pressure bomb but Tony was ready and maneuvered himself to the other side of the detonation using the momentum to cast him to Bucky’s direction.
On the other side…
Tony took a deep breath, “Okay, you ready?”
Eventually, he gave up and told himself that he must have imagined the man standing there. He did not know what frightened him more, that he had imagined the man or that he hadn't. Either way, this was becoming a huge problem.
Step back.
“What s-special plan?”
Working with the archer so closely the last few years Tony does have some modicum of a notion as to what Clint really went through on a very personal level when Loki brainwashed him. Even without Natasha pointing it out. So, with a heavy heart, he left the refuge of his workshop to seek out Barton.
“Fuck!” He exclaimed painfully.
Steve was finding it hard to gain his balance. Something was off and this new development wasn't helping. There was something… Something that just wasn't right.
“H-he’s my f-friend.” Steve rasped.
Meanwhile…
“You really were doing something!! Spill Rogers!” She demanded excitedly.
It depicted Gloria talking to another agent identified as Special Agent Martha Hadley. Natasha had interviewed her earlier; her story matches what they know.
"Yeah, I'll get right on that." He smirked.
The prisoner swallowed thickly fighting against the restraints.
“Jarvis?” He was half expecting no reply.
It was odd. He felt the soreness over his right arm and abdomen. It felt like there may have been a serious injury there but all he saw was smooth and blemish free skin. He ran his hands over his stomach and flinched a bit when he pressed harder and felt a twinge of pain. Maybe he’ll ask Peggy about it later. Maybe he was hurt recently and he just can’t remember it. Maybe his serum just doesn’t work the way it used to. He decided on holding off discussing it with Peggy. If it was normal he’ll know when he remembers again. Likewise, if it was something concerning he’d rather wait to remember and have all the information. No point in alarming her. Not just yet. If it gets worse he’ll say something. He nodded resolutely to himself. He stepped into the water and relaxed immediately. For once in a very long while he let his mind go blank.
Steve rolled his eyes.
Before he could perform evasive maneuvers he was hit by Dr. Dooms attack. His shield thankfully took most of it, but not all of it.
Bucky regarded Steve again, “Okay, you know you’re a miserable punk right?”
Fuck!
“Suit up!” The Captain commanded.
“Don’t you mean escape?” Bucky corrected with an edge to his voice.
“You’re in love with the Stark!?”
“The ‘cavalry’ has arrived.” Steve stated with glee.
“Very well then, fall back!” Odin addressed his troops.
They made it nearly two miles before they came across a massive wall of zappers. They were near the perimeter. These were the ones that couldn’t get through the Human Torch without being burnt to a crisp. He looked behind him and he can literally see the new wave coming like a cloud. He realized that part of it was a super electric shock wave making the ones present replicate.
“I was coming up with some ideas.” He smirked.
"Here." He said handing Tony an extra com unit.
"Sounds like quite a catch." Tony murmured softly, now mere inches away from Steve.
At the sound of Steve’s voice everyone paused and took a deep and long and cleansing breath. A wave of tranquility washed over them for a moment. They felt something percolating deep within the core of their souls. Something akin to relief, perhaps acceptance, and maybe just maybe even a little spark of hope still smoldering within their hearts. It is incredibly amazing that such peace had been achieved under such a woeful circumstance.
It had been close to a week since the incident in San Jose but the wound looks as if he had received it not hours ago. It’s not healing. Which is even more concerning considering Steve’s super soldier status.
“God, you can’t even cut me a freaking break for one God damn moment!” Tony sighed. “Fine! We’ll continue this later. Tomorrow afternoon I want to mount the first prototype. Be ready.” He said stifling yet another yawn. As Tony brushed past Barnes to get to the door first our genius zapped him in the ribs with his tiny zap stick.
It was a genuine question, with not a hint of mockery.
Angie had taken Ellie to go to the bathroom and get breakfast. Steve wanted to stay behind in case something happened. He was far too high strung to eat anyway.
How is it he knew and felt these things?
“And that point of view is spectacular. I could not help myself but I started painting that scene right before this whole mess started.” He said bashful.
He looked down dismally at the deconstructed mess that was once his newest Iron Man suit. He knew the risks when he had made the decision to use his armor to re-create the distorter. However, he had wholly underestimated how utterly vulnerable he felt as he sat there wearing a nearly half dead suit and completely disconnected from Jarvis and his team.
Upon their arrival they were immediately debriefed and they got straight to work. They started going through all of the documents. Most of them were being scanned into the computer and translated by a translation formula Asgard also provided. Then the documents were put through an algorithm that Tony set up, now it’s the waiting game. Steve hated to wait.
Steve dove through the air head first with his shield that is front.  He managed to slice through the arm of one of the bots.  The appendage fell to the ground beside the robot becoming completely useless.  As the bot seemed to look down upon its arm seemingly in horror the Captain whipped around and flung his shield severing its robotic head.  As soon as Steve caught the shield he darted off into the facility, leaving Natasha and Clint to deal with the remaining two outside.
"Of course, it is, daddy! Please." She pleaded holding his hand.
“Not even a peck on the lips?” Her voice was starting to rise an octave.
“My Son, forgive this kind of greeting, but if Calamity came with you, I did not wish to be found unprepared. Even if our efforts would be futile.”
“Aww! What the hell man? It’s a love letter! You seriously wrote a love letter?!”
“It gets better!” Clint could hardly contain his smile.
Tony's response was a bit more intense, "So, what? Is that what you want the souls for? Power and life?"
Why was it so important? What was so imperative about an artificial heart?
“Well, it’s true, you leave much to be desired now, but that doesn’t mean you are really anything less than a hero. As it had been painfully pointed out to me recently, if you had the choice, truly had the choice, you absolutely would not have let those things happen. Right?”
“Two minutes.”
He looked down at her iridescent black crystal fairy-like form and agreed that she did look like a little black star.
The ominous tone in his voice was the only warning Ellie got before Steve began to gently poke at her sides. Her delighted squeals of laughter widened the smile on his face so much that it hurt. After a moment, he finally let up.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
She smiled, her eyes shining, “This conversation amuses me!  Does it not amuse you Anthony?”  She laughed.
Steve smiled as the genius walked off.  The Captain sipped at his coffee before simply chugging it down.
This was way beyond his pay grade. Steve did not know the first thing about time travel, except from what he read in science fiction novels. Did he even possess the slightest capacity to do anything about it?
The white wash picket fence was lined with a variety of roses. The big oak still had the tree swing hanging from one of its massive gnarly branches. The maple he found himself under not days ago was on the other side opposite the driveway. There were a few more American flags on display then he remembered, however, that is no surprise considering who he is.
Tony watched as Barnes stood as the victor holding his chest. The genius felt so fucking lucky the soldier was on his side albeit a tad reluctantly. He swallowed the bile down as he took in the state of the agents, especially Rumlow. God, that was brutal. He suppressed a shiver as he called out.
“That isn’t going to work anymore!” Rumlow shouted as he struggled to let himself off of the floor. “This entire level is on lockdown.” He grinned despite his struggling form.
Shit!
"I swear to you, no more tricks, no more half-truths. Let me take you to a place where I can stand before you hiding nothing."
“You and all our Allies are welcome to it.” She nodded and began to thumb through some of the files.
“I’m sorry.” Bucky whispered.
“Indeed, if we were not in such a hurry I would have suggested we have a pint.” Thor stated wistfully.
"No." He declared with iron conviction.
He had installed the safeguards himself specifically so no one could do this. It was only a matter of time now before they were able to take his own suit down, judging by how easily they were able to deflect his assault.
“You betrayed us and for what!? A fugitive, a murderer.”
"It's 1955." Steve answered him, watching the man closely.
"What's going on?"
He sat up slowly. He noted that he felt oddly sore but nothing too terrible.
“How’s the search for your keystone?”  Asked Steve.
Tony hesitated to turn the page. He had no idea what Steve had in store for him. Probably going into detail about how much he thinks Tony is the scum of the Earth. At least maybe he would finally know what he did wrong. Perhaps, Steve wrote why he left. Full of trepidation Tony turned the page and found that the rest was indeed addressed to him. He winced at how long his part of the letter was. Steve really had something to say.
“Okay, Mr. one with the chair, are you done?” He asked again.
“Hey! I’m not making you do anything!” He smirked again with a wicked glint in his eye.
“That’s true, what if she told Tony he was wrong because he actually is close to finding an answer?” This response came from Maria that just came through the door with Jane in tow.
Tony took a deep breath pulling himself out of his thoughts. He had a pretty good idea where to start.
He removed four of them, two adult coats and two children coats. He draped the largest one over Maggie.
“So you just fucking then?” Bucky asked with a straight face.
"Fuck!"
“Fantastic work Barton!” Fury commended.
A burden.
Steve looked at her in new he was utterly fucked. But he remained resolute. He shook his head.
Steve woke up sometime later with a raging headache. He glanced around him to find the room empty. He made to get up only to find he had been thoroughly restrained.
“I don’t know how to be around you without fucking up somehow.  Either I’m going to give in and tell you or something worse.”  He admitted clearly distraught.
“How can I?  I’m on house arrest.”  Steve replied.
"Thank God." Tony thought wryly.
“Prisoner 86!” Official number three shouted out.
Thor smiled in relief. “Well then, we are a bunch of foolish, selfish idiots.” Thor retorted.
“Are you all right, Sir?” Official number two asked suspiciously.
“I needed you to tell me if what he wrote was true! Immediately after reading the letter I headed straight to the Raft.” The genius replied defensively.
Laughed…
“How long do you think you can hold your breath?”
Someone special? Yes! There was someone special!
The dark visitor merely raised an eyebrow.
A well-wisher’s lament, pah! He would have rather blown the place skyhigh. Each time she entered Tony’s personal quarters and left he felt a piece of his already broken heart chip away and die. It just made him want to carry on with his plan all the more.
Then things started to go even more South.
“I know how you feel Buck, but this is something I need to do. You all are my friends and if I have the capacity to save you then I’m going to try.”
Tony looked out of the elevator to see what the commotion was only to have the sight that greeted him make him pale in trepidation. What had to be fifteen agents and guards started charging through the corridor coming from the direction the Strike unit came from.
“Oh come on Cap, he didn’t order us to stay here.  He didn’t say we couldn’t leave.”  Tony smirked, “And I have my suit with me remember?”
"Why not give your race a fighting chance? You'd rather me just be done with it?" She replied seemingly genuinely.
"Could have what? Been together? You did not even fully comprehend your own feelings for him before I arrived. You may never have." She replied.
They were hurt, they could have been dying!  Where are they?  Are they safe?  Steve’s mind finally clicked back together after eighteen hours of regaining consciousness.
Suddenly, the three air subs in pursuit were shot out of the sky by an invisible aircraft. The subs plummeted back into the ocean with a terrible kerplunk. Tony turned his attention back to the approximate location of the aircraft. As he kept watching the bay doors of the jet opened.
With a curt nod they all bailed.
Yay for no new cases!
Barnes coughed back a laugh.
It’s blurry and obscured but it appears to be a dark figure holding a rifle of some sort.  He also appeared to have a metal arm.  Whether it’s armor or prostatic was indiscernible.
But what if he could?
Four minutes.
As much as it relieved him to see her well, it also alarmed him to see so much medical equipment attached to her. He was sure he had less during the serum infusion procedure.
‘Angry?!’
He backed up against the far wall of the roof.  He breathed deeply and set his sights on the seventh story window and broke into a sprint.  He pushed his sore aching body passed its limits. He put every last bit of energy into his legs willing them to move faster and faster until he made it to the end.  He sprang off of the ledge with a force that was excruciating.  He felt his legs burn miserably as his muscles tore and tendons popped.
He turned around quickly only to find that Barnes was not behind him. He was still in the danger zone. As if in slow motion the mother’s massive corpse was sucked up into the pseudo-void. As soon as her massive frame was no longer blocking the opening the full force of the spatial distortion came into effect.
“What a fire cracker! I can see why her husband is such a jumpy fellow.” Tony said mostly to himself.
“Tony?” Pepper asked suddenly alarmed. “Is that supposed to be smoking?”
“On second thought I’m glad you’re here. I may or may not have broken the coffee pot down here about 3 hours ago, so I need you to get me some coffee. Some glorious liquid heaven, yeah?” Tony looked at Steve in anticipation all the while still smirking.
He clicked his tongue at himself and chuckled darkly. That was another reason he guessed that he himself was so adamant to help Barnes in this way. It was something that he could accomplish, something that he could control 100%. He needed to be of use in this one little stupid way. Calamity probably has them all fucked six ways to Sunday but at least Tony was going to accomplish this. He was going to help this man, Steve’s friend and brother in ways Steve himself could not.
“I can get on fine without it.” Bucky replied sharply.
Tony’s close proximity and breath on his neck sent violent shivers crashing through out Steve’s body. He turned rapidly in his seat to face Tony who was sporting a wicked grin.
“That’s really good Buck but we need to keep moving, I’ve got a plan.” The Captain replied standing up.
“So we make sure she doesn’t get a hold of this keystone.” Clint said adamantly.
When he entered, the bell above the door jingled. The shopkeeper looked up and saw Steve, his face lit up brightly.
Suddenly, Steve barreled past him. The genius’s heart plummeted in fear and horror. Before he could even tell him to stop, Steve turned to Tony just enough to show him a cocky grin.
"Tony!" He gasped in exclamation.
Steve however, was in an entirely different universe. While the soldier was inside his head Steve finally got a fleeting glance at his eyes. It felt like someone had thrust their fist into his chest began to squeeze his heart.
Calamity’s face lit up in delight.
Oh thank God.
“NO FUCKING SHIIIIITT!!!” Clinton bellowed insanely, his eyes wild.
Bucky fell to his knees and stared in horror at his missing arm. The agents came in fast with their electrical weapons. Bucky wasn’t fast enough to get away this time. They surrounded him and began to subdue him with the electricity. The scream that tore from Bucky’s throat was even more excruciating than the first. Steve was in such desolate pain. There was nothing he can do but beg.
Fuck!
"Steve and little Eleanor, it's good to see you again!" She jovially greeted them, giving them a hug each in turn.
After Sam and Steve arrived, Clint got right into briefing them on their newest mission. Steve was beyond irritated that it was Von Doom and his doom bots that they were meant to stop.
How did it come to this? The Super Soldier started to look around the room in horror.
“Yes, well, I guess we can rule out that I’m here to kill you.” Tony shrugged, just now realizing how unkept and deranged he must look.
He was actually very thankful.  With what Bruce told him, Professor Xavier was capable of seriously amazing things, and those things could very well help them out tremendously in their current predicament.
At that time, I pulled away from the other sentient beings and pursued the answers to my deepest questions. Eventually that led me to the deepest depths of the universe itself and I found that Yggdrasil was the answer to everything…
“On it, Jar!”
"Graham's human soul and life essence." She answered.
“God…” He muttered. “Always.”
“What are your names?” Steve asked hoping to gain the children’s trust enough to move them.
As Bucky walked out into the bright sunlight he took a quick sweep of the area, swiftly identifying all possible ways he could be compromised. He did his best to avoid those avenues and proceeded to work his way to the predetermined rendezvous point. He did not know how the rest of this day was going to go down, but he could feel it deep in his gut that it was not going to end well. At least at this point he was not being rapidly swarmed by the government or the Avengers. Which means he hadn’t been discovered yet. That means they had time.
“Yes, and I’m going to enjoy it immensely.” Tony replied impishly.
Tony began to pout. He groaned leaning back.
“Sir, you are about to activate the self-destruct feature, are you sure you wish to proceed?” Jarvis asked seemingly concerned.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
"No, I mean, Howard can't have children." Steve replied thinking about the disheartening information he had learned recently.
“I see it!” He exclaimed suddenly. “I see what they were doing, I see what they were getting at. It’s beautiful and God dammit, I hate them!”
"Maybe!" He sighed. "No, I know I'm being stupid and the fact that you can't remember should make things so much easier, right? God, it makes it so much worse." He admitted.
Could she really do it?
“No stop!!” Steve screamed but it was futile now.
"All right." Steve said as he looked left then right in order to safely cross the street.
First, she morphed into a beautiful elf like creature. Though mystical and otherworldly, he could still recognize her humanlike features.
“If we now know that this being chooses people based on being touched by evil perhaps that is how the planets are chosen. Worlds that are torn apart by war and madness? Just a thought.” He replied.
Steve was shocked out of his thoughts as Bucky cried out waking up suddenly in a fit. He sat up rapidly looking around wildly before his eyes settled on Steve. He huffed in relief for a moment, realizing finally where he was. His respite was short-lived however when he got a good look at Steve’s torso.
Steve watched the exchange like it was happening miles from there.  He was vaguely aware that they were talking about him.  However, he was still unable to be fully present.  He felt so lost.  He watched as Jean and Hank finished their conversation.  He turned back to the beeping monitor as Dr. Grey left the room.
“Well forgive me I had completely forgotten that humans will just stand still and gawk at all the pretty lights even if it kills them, faerie.”
They stood there an awkward silence for a moment just sort of sizing each other up in a way.  Until Tony spoke up,
“The most complex coding on earth right now is Jarvis. That is Jarvis.” He pointed to the display. “He is currently just over 100 TB and growing.” He began to adjust the display. “This?” He holds up the thumb drive Calamity gave him. “Is this.”
Three…
"And what does that name mean?"
Tony lied on the ground trembling. His frail human body now acutely aware that the mother was a true predator, a force of nature that could put any the earth could produce to shame.
Tony barely registered the Rhododendron laughing like a psycho. Before Iron Man could even consider what to do about the hell bird, Captain America's shield suddenly whipped past his helm and embedded itself into the bird, slicing it right down the middle.
“Tony…?” The Captain looked to his right at Tony who was still fiddling with his phone.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You are too late Anthony." Calamity stated gravely. "He's mine now."
To say the things he couldn’t before…
"I do."
"Just so you know, I'm here to." He heard Barton call out from somewhere else in the room.
He took a deep breath.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course not, Sir, you volunteered." A voice sounded from the device that Steve realized must have been a high tech com-unit.
He hadn’t seen Tony much the last few days. The genius was working on a whole shit ton of things at once. He was still deciphering the code among other things. Tony did manage to find time for Pepper, however, when she came to visit. One of the hardest things he has ever done was to plaster a kind smile to his face and accept her well wishes.
“Oh God what now?! What now?!” Clint became hysterical again.
Peggy turned to have handing him the car keys. “Now, you be careful with Mary Anne.” She said.
“It’s too risky.” Steve countered.
What did it have to do with destroying the core? The core of a devise that could cause so much pain…
‘Good, the kid is fine.’ He thought in relief.
Steve looked at the screen in fascination and horror. Tony continued.
“What exactly did he tell you!? ‘Cause I haven’t been with Pepper since we broke up a year ago.”
"Oh, I saw you at the bus stop yesterday. I couldn't remember my dreams till then." Steve said.
“As you must know by now director, we need to return to New York to address this new development.”  Professor Xavier stated as he motioned for everyone to follow him.
“Well, as I’ve said before I have this annoying guy that insists I consume more than coffee on a regular basis.” He smirked.
“So Captain,” Natasha eyed Steve slyly perking Clint’s interest.
“From the moment she made eye contact with the mysterious woman to the moment she stopped was exactly 69 seconds."
A little over a half hour later found our dear Captain in the middle of a briefing of a new case. A new case on top of everything else.
He shook his head. He couldn’t think that way. This was for Steve. Plain and simple.
Barnes looked at the device skeptically. “What is it?”
“Or, that time you knocked out Franklin with a stale baguette.”
The coding was an utter mess. It looked like someone had chewed up the patchwork code then vomited it all over the fucking place. Tony had Jarvis running the best pattern recognition algorithms in the world in an attempt to figure out how to stitch back together terabytes of ones and zeros the way it was meant to be. Calamity really, truly, knew how to fuck with him, she really did. As soon as he felt like he has made significant progress she somehow makes everything thousand times more difficult. It’s like every time he takes one solid step forward she painfully knocks him ten spaces back.
Not to mention all of this was happening on top of everything else he was trying to do to save the world. He was constantly working to figure out how to read and analyze that dense data load Calamity gave to him on the freaky alien crystal. He could wallow in self-misery and simultaneously work on a solution to save the universe. He was very proficient in multitasking.
“Oh God, I knew sending it was a horrible mistake.”
“You are to me. I know what you’re thinking, what you did all those years? That wasn’t you.”
“I needed you to reach your breaking point so that I could have full access to your soul.”
"Fuck!" Tony roared in tandem with his team.
“You weren’t there! After you stupidly dove into the giant zapper and destroyed it you were going to die! You were dying in my arms, Steve.” His voice wavered. “Your body was so broken and your skin was ripped apart.” Tony choked. “There was so much blood…”
Charles and Hank looked at the ‘Out of Time’ young man in awe. The Dr. could definitely see why this man was the leader, the Captain of their group.
Without any further ado, on with the show!
“Eh? Sorry Babydoll, I was distracted.” He laughed despite himself.
Barnes gasped at the contents, it was Captain America's shield.
Beep.
He also noted that his wounds remained untreated. His arm had not been relocated, his hand and wrist were throbbing painfully even more intensely because they were twisted and bound so brutally within the confining jacket. His ribs remained unset, making it incredibly difficult to breathe regardless of the restraints. The stitches were still torn, he could feel his blood still leak minutely. On top of the other torn muscles and fractured bones caused by his efforts to escape the marking on his wrist till burned like fire.
Steve startled at the sudden memory, his entire body involuntarily pulsed in shock and he had emitted an almost inaudible yelp. He soothed Ellie absentmindedly. She stirred as he desperately tried to cling to the memory.
Steve couldn't even say he was surprised that tears ran down his own face at Tony's confession and declaration. His own heart broke for the man before him. Yet, despite the weight of Tony's words, somehow, a profound heaviness had lifted from his soul. He couldn't remember what had transpired between them but he could feel it. He knew that he loved this man, profoundly, and that whatever had happened was alarmingly big. It truly broke his heart to see this beautiful man in such anguish. He did not know how a man from 2014 had become such an integral part of his life that he felt it deep within his soul.
“Will do, Mr. Stark!” He responded.
His surroundings changed from his prison to the vast freedom of the night starry sky. The stars twinkled brilliantly and the crisp cool air filled his lungs soothing the crushing tension in his chest. He relaxed in her hold and watched as the dark scenery passed them by. They were up high, way way up. The ocean was a vast void on the horizon. Buildings, no, cities were mere specs below them.
“You want my professional opinion? I say this is the work of an alien or mutant. In which case, contacting Thor is our best bet with an alien foe. If this is the effect of a mutant then we should consider contacting Professor Charles Xavier and Dr. Hank McCoy. If there is anyone out there who knows anything about the abilities of mutants then they would be your best bet.” At the doctor’s admission, Tony and Steve looked at each other. Their thoughts were on the same wavelength.
“Deal.”
“No worries Cap, I’m with you all the way.” Tony smiled as he clasped the Captain on the shoulder.
“Steve?”  Johnny uttered quietly.
Steve gave him a questioning look and Tony continued, "I mean, I just feel like if you remembered then you could be angry with me and call me a stupid arrogant asshole and I could beg my hands and knees for your forgiveness and somehow everything would be okay but it's not going to be okay! It's never going to be okay and it's my own stupid ass fault and you don't even know why!" His voice rose in volume as the floodgates opened.
Maybe?
Were once his pain had been excruciating and unbearable now receded to numbness. He could not feel his body nor his emotions. He could not feel anything at all. Somewhere he knew he should be afraid of the numbing sensation but he could not be made to care.
“That’s not good enough!” He bellowed.
“Of Course”
After attaining a painfully visible brain freeze that sent the both of them into a howling laughter they bid the various remaining people which mostly consisted of the staff a hearty fare well.  Tony paid the bill after Steve relented his insisting that he could pay his fair share, the genius wasn’t hearing any of it.  Tony suited up and they escaped out the back door from once they came.
End Chapter 31
Steve stared at him concerned and confused.
She laughed merrily as she helped add the other ingredients also. She began to go into detail about the grand adventures that she and her pony, Rocky, went on. Steve listened adeptly as he began to cook up some pancakes.
This would be a great time to give me a theory. What do you think the connection is?
He winced a little as Bucky went over the worst parts of his abdomen. He had to really pinch some sections back together a bit harder to ensure a proper stitch. He stared at the blood now on Bucky’s steel hand. It was oddly mesmerizing.
A/N: What is the deal!? Well, you are all going to have to stay tuned for the next chapter, (and maybe even the next after that) to find out.
"Please, Daddy." The girl tugged his hand and pleaded again.
“If you had, would you have told me?” Steve replied sharply.
“Be well Professor, I hope to see you back on my ship soon.”  Fury said as Xavier boarded the X-jet.
“I can’t…”  He thought for a moment.  “It’s just I can’t stop thinking about what you said to the kids.”  He said finally.
“Honestly, I surprised myself.” He replied.
“But we can put it off. It doesn’t have to happen so soon. We have time!”
“Okay, I know you’re angry.”
“Where is Dr. Banner right now?” Tony said while initiating the start up program for his ‘space phone’ as the Captain called it.
Steve chuckled as he knelt to assess her work. At the very least he could tell which feathers were meant to be gold and not simply yellow without her pointing them out. That’s a plus. But he could tell what she meant. They still didn’t quite read “gold.” Steve almost wanted to tell her that it was fine the way it was. For a seven-year-old the drawing was excellent. However, he also knows the value of constructive criticism. Ellie wasn’t fishing for compliments right now, she needed guidance.
“Ah, nothing, it’s nothing.”  He replied swallowing thickly.
His wrist throbbed and burned. He looked down at it and it was glowing deep iridescent black.
He forced himself to stand up. He huffed deeply in so much pain. He kept going.
"The other souls, Steven. Not Midgardian souls, mind you, but all the others. They are all here, inside me."
“You know Cap; it is customary to end the night with a goodbye kiss after a successful date.”  Tony’s smirk widened at the Captain’s shocked expression.
“She said she took them…”  Steve replied.
Being a legendary super soldier has its perks as if you didn’t know. In His profound military and martial arts training, experience in extreme battle conditions and on the brutal front lines, Steve has developed the innate ability to perceive the dangerous nefarious intentions of men of the villainous nature. In short he gets a hunch when bad people are doing bad things. And in the altered cliché phrasing of a web slinging ally “His baddie sense is tingling.” Steve firmly believes that someone is behind the unexplainable cases; someone with heinous intentions. Thus his brisk walk to Tony’s lab where he knows the genius is hiding in which Steve hopes of finding a good set of ears to voice his concerns to.
His amusement morphed to shock. It was a memory! Chills ran up and down his spine. The more he tried to cling to the memory of burnt gray eggs and an excruciatingly familiar face, the more it wrenched away.
He remembered everything.
Before Steve could even answer, Captain America's shield clattered suddenly on the ground next to them. It was covered in blood, gore and ooze. It reeked of a dank putrid odor.
Bucky turned abruptly and began to limp back to the elevator as fast as his broken body would allow. That was until he heard a whole cluster fuck of shouting.
He should have just let him rot in there. The only reason he hasn’t tried to kill the guy himself, yet, was because Nat threatened to put a bullet in his head if he tried. Honestly, he was maybe 60% sure she was bluffing but decided he did not want to find out the hard way.
'Much better than the time Tony tried his hand at cooking.' He thought with amusement. 'We all survived at least.' He thought wryly.
“Repairs are complete and we should be in contact with Asgaurd in a few short hours.” He said in a snarky tone.
"Inside you? How do you mean?"
He gestured to Captain America-Barnes, who was closest to him, to relay his message to the team.
This flight was a thousand times more awkward than the last one. Everyone was desperately trying to avoid whole keystone elephant in the room thing. It frustrated Steve to no end.
After Peggy came back from checking on the child making sure she really was asleep they made idle chitchat for a time.
As soon as he walked into his workshop he forced his thoughts to get back on task. He took a deep breath and let it out all at once. He clapped his hands together and spoke out loud.
“Yep, the contacting Thor part of the plan is already in motion. I had already initiated the start up program for the ‘Trans Cosmic Tele Communication Device’ about 40 or so minutes ago, so in a few short hours we should be in contact with Asgard. In the mean time how do you think we should get in touch with Professor Iron Sides?”
Tony worked methodically, removing pieces of his own armor in order to use the small machinery and mechanisms to rebuild the device. He had already removed most of his chest plate, the suits arc reactor, both gauntlets and his helm and face plate.
Suddenly Tony landed in front of him, blocking Steve from Calamity. He knew it was futile but tried anyway.
“Will do, Sir.” Was Jarvis’s reply as a holographic display of the security entry feed lit up the room.
This is where Natasha found him sometime later with his head on his desk groaning aloud, almost whimpering.
Everyone ran to the sick bay were the victims were located for analysis and treatment. As they arrived the leading physician met up with Fury to brief him.
~-0-~
Gloria, when she got out at twenty-one, got the help she needed and with the assistance of various charitable organizations and a lot of hard work she got into Stanford where she also studied criminal justice. Because of her outstanding test skills she was eventually recruited by SHIELD and because of Jimmy’s experience on the front lines and back ground in criminal justice he was also recruited by SHIELD which led them both here.” The Crazy genius finished almost mournfully.
"Ah! Language!" Ellie squealed reprimanding from her perch by the table.
Steve couldn’t help but to look at Tony with such awe and admiration.  It was amazing to Steve how Tony figured out that there was in fact a problem trying to find the woman in the media and quickly found the solution to it all in one day.  Hell, he was pretty sure it was just in the last couple of hours.  The crazy genius was just special like that.
“Fifty bucks.” Steve declared suddenly.
"No!" Steve thought and called out desperately.
“Come on, let’s go see if your mommy needs help.”
Bucky opened his mouth, no doubt to deliver another litany of awful insults, but Tony beat him to the punch.
Tony smiled. "Exactly."
He looked about the room hoping everyone got the double meaning from that. Seeing that everyone had knowing faces on he continued.
“After I learned about the value of my existence during that time I knew what I had to do. I took the planet Xiréth in the Vanaheim. Next I took Ödeskar of the Jotunheim, then Pläkktakienvín of the Niflheim, Körga of the Muspelheim and lastly Trëyía of the Alfheim." She smiled watching Thor as she spoke.
“Just shut up and tell me what the fuck this is!” Tony shouted.
Calamity took a deep breath and seemed to be containing her emotions, then spoke. "In that case, I will offer you this one last bargain." She suggested almost slyly. "If you offer to me your soul right now, I give you my word that I will reunite you two after the harvest. The two of you together for all eternity? Deal?"
Fuck!
Steve needed a break. Seriously like right now. He had been staring at a computer screen for the last several hours nonstop. His body viciously reminding him that his aching, healing body needs to eat.
He shrugged.
"Ellie?" He asked in a reverent whisper.
“Any time now. Like I said, I have days at the most.”
Thor turned to him and smiled softly his previous mischievous countenance completely gone. Leading Steve to believe that ‘that’ was the continuation of a previous encounter. He wondered how that went.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
Bucky effectively dodged the agents in favor of facing off with War Machine. He successfully disarmed three of the agents and kept two of their electrifying weapons. Steve watched in terrifying trepidation as Bucky successfully sidestepped and avoided most of War Machine’s brutal annihilating attacks. The Winter Soldier whipped around fast jabbing one of the Shield weapons into a weak spot in the armor. War Machine went down hard on his knees and some of the more fainthearted agents backed off in complete terror.
“Ok, inform him about the situation and send him all of the case files and other information I have gathered. Have him get back to me a.s.a.p.”
He finished off the last of his tea before it gesturing for Peter to follow him. He led him through the compound until they came to a room that was Steve’s art studio. The Captain let the young man in and let him scope of place out. As Peter was going through some work he hadn’t seen yet Steve allowed himself to get lost in thought.
“Ta-ta then.” She waved as she started to head for the door.
“Hey, hey are you okay!?”
Tony held his breath and turned it on. He watched on a holographic display as the small electric pulses emanated from the device and penetrated Barnes’s brain and spinal cord. Bucky froze and grabbed the arm of the chair. Tony backed up to give him space. He watched as the soldier struggled to stay in control.
“Steve, that was crazy, reckless and impulsive! You could have just destroyed your life doing that! If they don’t kill you on site along with me they will lock you away for good, American hero or not. I’m not worth that!”
This was why he could never trust anybody with his true self. Nobody.
He watched as Pepper exited Tony’s room smiling a sad smile gently to herself.
We finally reached the end of the climactic battle.
The absolute last thing he needed right now was for Tony and Bucky to try and kill each other. Steve had no idea what to say or do in this situation but he knew he had to neutralize the conflict and fast. The Captain held his hands up in an attempt to defuse the tension.
‘Great!’
Well that's foreboding.
Tony then went and took Thor’s old seat next to the Captain.
“Oh my God, you two really are five years old.” Nat said striding into the room with Barton and Wanda hot on her heels.
They nodded and saluted him, well as much of the salute as young children can manage.
“Y-yeah.” He answered as he began going through Tony’s files again.
‘Yes creature.’ Tony thought again.
It was a new day. A day that was supposed to be bright and sunny; and despite the overwhelming situation an ally was amongst them with useful information. Things were supposed to be looking up.
Johnny smile that that.
Clint’s eyes widened comically.
All too soon it was bedtime for little Eleanor. Steve carried her up the stairs and made sure she accomplished her nightly routine. He found, however, that she was quite self-sufficient in that area. With clean teeth, brushed hair and donning her favorite nightgown she practically drove into bed. Steve laughed merrily at her antics.
'We are going to make it aren't we?'
“I believe so.” He laughed.
“Come on Cap!”  Tony said firmly pulling Steve to his feet, “We need to go see…”  He swallowed thickly. “…Who she took.”
He wallowed in self misery for another half hour or so. He couldn’t help it. He indulged himself in his own pity party. It’s just... It’s just he thought he really was doing something right for the first time. He truly loved Steve. And he thought maybe just maybe the Captain felt the same way. At least it felt like it anyway.
In minutes they were rolling around on the dirty floor of the old factory fighting over the sketchbook, to the utter amusement of the twins, squabbling like the brothers they were.
Steve looked at Tony, shocked out of his pensive.
“I stand corrected.”
“Absolutely.” He smirked.
Tony scowled. "So, what?" He snapped knowing exactly what Barnes was going to ask about.
"That was a real close one, was it not?" She smiled.
"Daddy, what's wrong?" Ellie looked up to him.
That did it.
He took a deep breath and allowed himself one last lingering glance at his Captain before snapping the helm and face plate shut on the armor before quickly leaving the infirmary and blasting off into the sky to meet his team on the battlefield.
Steve could barely make out the name of the shop. 'Elaine's Fabrics' it said in faded cursive on the window. Steve was better able to identify that it was the place they were indeed looking for because of the sewing mannequins displayed in the window.
“So did you get those photos I sent you?” Asked Peter.
“Don’t worry Captain.  They are all fine.”  He said soothingly while rubbing Steve’s back.  “They all made it out safely because of you.”  He said.
“The pain!” He shouted. “I don’t deserve this! This-this relief. I deserve to suffer!” He wailed wretchedly.
Johnny nodded dejectedly.  He knew there was nothing he could say or do to stop him.  One, he was physically incapable and two, he couldn’t really argue with that.  Especially knowing if he was capable he would tag along, for Sue.
The first thing that Steve noticed was the gentle glow of the arc reactor.
“Not even a spark?” Steve quipped smirking at him.
Johnny could barely watch the scene before him. Hot prickly tears started to flow down his face also.
‘Please don’t kill me. Please don’t tell me.’ He chanted to himself.
"And my test?"
“I know and I want to be there for it.”
Steve was so confused.
He needed to get lost again.
Tony broke a little more inside. “She took him.” He whispered.
Thor looked torn but did as he was commanded. Tony continued to protest angrily but Steve could no longer hear him after Thor jumped into the sky. He landed swiftly a few blocks away and grabbed Antman and Johnny before hastily flying out of sight toward the evac zone. The Captain wasn’t too worried about Ben, he was rather bulletproof, he’d survive.
“Ah yes, James Buchanan Barnes. That one is quite the beacon. I do know where he is.”
Tony and Bucky start taking care of business.
“Car accident.  I think I look pretty damn good considering.  I asked you five here specifically because I need people who I can trust.”
Steve shook his head. See, long and painful ass day.
“No.” He answered. His voice was gravelly from his torrent of emotions.
“So, hey, how about we have a talk?” He began as casually as he could muster given the awkwardness of the situation.
“I concur, we can’t just walk in undetected.” Pietro agreed.
“I bet.” Steve replied sullenly before fixing Fury with another seething glare.
Tony probably saw him as a bit of fun in the sack, nothing more. Sure he cared for him, but the genius cared for all their friends.
“Yep, and I’ll tell you all about the gruesome details later.” He said as the elevator came to a stop. “But right now, we gotta get out of here.” He finished.
"I will." Iron Man replied.
“Mr. Stark!” Tony jolted out of his dark thoughts as one of the doctors bounded into the room. “I see you prepared the tables. Efficient as always.” Dr. Davidson stated briskly as she prepared a few of the surrounding monitors to display the Soldiers scans of his shoulder taken just an hour ago.
And then it hit him.
Steve flinched and bowed his head.
Antman and Iron Man made sure the doom bots stayed clear of the evac zone. Thor attempted to thin them out as quickly as possible. Tony had informed them that the bots were all likely linked together. He said that it was a possibility that when one fell the others learn from their fallen comrade and adapted. They had to do this quickly and carefully.
Seriously, yesterday was the pentacle hell. We don’t talk about yesterday.
“Clear. Once you reach the appropriate level the halls are free to travel, however, despite my efforts, many officials are gathering to bar your escape from portal B – 03, Sir.”
Everyone freezes for a moment considering this alternate method.
Whoa… Okay, that’s something else. It dawned on Steve that Bucky’s response was something Hydra forced him to do.
"But- but my Lady! I'm so close! If you could just open the rift again, we could win!" He pleaded hysterically.
“How would you like to be my guinea pig?” Tony asked fully aware of the dreadful implications regarding who he was talking to.
“I-we were going to lose you because of your stupid suicidal self-sacrificing nature!”
In no time, he arrived at the Raft. It was a super max prison located in the middle of the ocean designed to house dangerous enhanced individuals. The Avengers, as a team, had put most of the prisoners there themselves. He loathed to go there for anything other than business and even more so recently to avoid being anywhere near a certain prisoner. Unfortunately, said prisoner was the very reason he had to come. That prisoner was the only person in the world that could tell him what he needed to know.
“Gosh, that sounded like a wonderful idea! Too bad.” Steve agreed mournfully.
“Yes Sir” Steve replied as he scratched the back of his head sheepishly.
“For once I agree with you.”  Tony sighed.  “I’m still nowhere near decrypting the information Calamity gave us.  Our tracking efforts are useless until I do, so we might as well keep a lookout for this guy.”  Tony said taking out his phone to make the adjustments.
“Uh, Peg? Where would this ice cream shop be?” He asked sheepishly.
“It’s the only way I know I can protect you.”  He replied softly but firmly.
"I will." He whispered wetly.
“Boss?  Are you sure you want that one?”  The slender man asked.
Tony turned to head back to the lab where they were working before.  Steve followed slowly behind them. He was debating whether or not to go back to the lab with them or to simply go back to his own quarters.  He had a lot of thinking to do.
“Oh Nicholas, so much fear and rage.” She sighed. “A very dangerous combination that is.”
Steve stiffened noticeably at that. He shook his head subtly at Tony who was seething and looked ready to pounce.
Another alarm blared and he felt his blood run cold. Remember how it was mentioned that the mini subs were versatile? Well now the three that were in pursuit just broke the surface of the water and were now in flight heading right for them.
Tony pried the plastic casing of the thumb drive a part to reveal a black iridescent crystal, crudely wired to a USB port.
Barnes scowled and flipped him off.
That is if he already hadn’t figured out that they were still in the area due to Bucky’s appearance at the post office. It was truly a matter of time now.
Steve turned to Tony suddenly. Before the genius could comprehend what was happening he felt a warm feather light pressure on his forehead right where the Captain got him earlier. A wave of euphoria flowed over him like a cascade.
"Like I'm gonna let that happen either!" Barnes groaned as he shakingly got to his knees.
“Shit, okay, I got you.” Tony tried to reassure.
“You can go first if you want.” He suggested.
Again the Captain resisted the urge to punch him in face.
"Is Mommy okay?" She asked again.
“Tony? What did you say to him?” he inquired with a bemused manner. Tony’s face was contorted somewhere between horror and amusement.
"That's just it, it doesn't have to be just words. It can be real. It is a very complicated process and even I don't know if the outcome will be the one I desire. But I feel like I owe it to the universe to try. I owe it to this planet." She gestured wide.
He blinked at it.  There was something important he was doing.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake!” Tony cursed. The genius took a deep calculating breath in an attempt to alleviate his irritation, then continued on. “Don’t be afraid to give it hell. It may not be good for an actual battle but it should hold up well in other rough conditions. I’ll be monitoring its progress through the sensors I installed.”
“Oh!  I thought I had heard something?”  Hank came rushing into the room.
Steve had enough. He pushed off the wall with an incredible force that left dents on the surface. He made his way to the middle of the room with absolute abandon and authority. He took one last look around the room full of chaos before,
“Ah Huh.” She giggled in affirmation.
“I… I can’t even describe it.” He whispered. “She spoke of eons and millennia, she’s a powerful and ancient being.” Steve breathed. “And I believe it.”
"What the-"
“Okay,” He spoke over a mouthful of jelly donut. “What is so God damned important?” He asked feigning irritation as he subsequently gulped down a full glass of milk.
Director Fury, being as exhausted as he was didn’t really mind others swaying the meeting every which way.  He was just happy that they were seeing results. As minuscule as they were, it was still something.
Thor left earlier that morning back to Asgard. That meeting with his father isn’t going to be a fun one. Xavier and his X-Men are in the sick bay discussing what happened yesterday.
"Uh, guys? I don't know how to tell you this…" He began, his voice laced with alarm.
“Lucky guess, you can go now!”
Not so much of a cliff hanger this time but still kinda leave you yearning for more right? All theories and comments welcome.
The moment he was on, Tony blasted off making their way to the weird alien robot thingy in the sky.
“I don’t like this Tony. What could possibly cause something like this? Is it a new super virus? Is it unregistered technology? Could it be the works of an alien or mutant or or…”
“Will do Sir.”
The walk wasn't too terrible, it felt good to exert himself. Ellie dutifully stayed close to him.
“W-what’s going… to h-happen now?” He asked softly in a strained whisper, his eyes never leaving the sky.
“Mr. Stark, I won’t ask you again. Surrender now!”
“You all right there?” Tony asked uncomfortably.
“Listen, she said I had a month at most, right?”
“No, please just leave, I can’t. I can’t.” He chanted in a mantra.
Hi! First off I am so sorry that I have been away for so long. The Holidays just really kicked my ass.
“Nat, I hate to break it to you but he was faking it all along.” Tony spat with bitter abandon.
Her somber was alleviated soon enough as she came up with a new idea.
Soon everyone was arguing, yelling and threatening.  The acrimony in the air reeked so much Steve wanted to choke.
No, it wasn't because they hit a few snags when placing the devices on some of Calamity's victims. Because apparently there were a few select people who tried to interfere due to some weird anti-technology extremist cult. Because you know, that's a thing.
There was no one.
“Well, before this night gets any weirder than it already has, I’m going to go find something… ‘Productive’ to do.” He emphasized with air quotes. He turned suddenly intending to leave then paused. “Oh, you should get some rest. We will pick up where we left off tomorrow, sometime afternoon.”
“See! I had to keep it from you before you went and did something stupid again! I can’t lose you like that.”
He shook his head. He remembered Tony. The mystery man he had been trying to figure out this last week. He remembered his sudden appearance in the barn last night and how all his notes, drawings and paintings had disappeared.
“Love, with sights so grand even a stone would quiver.” She mused.
“The doctor said everything is perfect. Just one more month my love.” She said happily as she wrapped her arms around her middle.
“Oh! You’re not coming with us?”
"Aww, okay." She pouted. "But we can get ice cream, right?" She asked hopefully.
A/N: Hello everyone! I'm back, and I'm ready to finish this!
“Ha! Don’t worry, I got this!” He shouted as he dove out of the Quin Jet.
He put the teakettle on the stove to bring to a boil. Little did they know he had slipped in a few sleeping capsules into the water. They were rather tasteless, they tricked Tony enough when he had to drugged him, so he wasn’t too worried. He prepared the tea pods while the water boiled. He participated in idle chitchat with them while he prepared the tea.
Tony did not think that he would ever be able to thank his team enough for their courage, determination and tenacity.
“Oh no! You do not get to shut me out!” She shouted, grabbing his wrists and making him look up at her. He moaned pathetically.
"Steven..."
"Uh hi, I'm here to pick up an order for Margaret Rogers." He asked matching her pleasant attitude.
Tony groaned again and ran his hands through his hair.
“It’s just five stories.”
He was broken out of his reverie by the sound of tires speeding over his gravel driveway. He turned to see a car he was unfamiliar with come to a screeching halt not three feet from him.
The display of Jarvis’s mind looked like a glowing orb of circuits and neuro-pathways flitting about.
Once it had been established that pies were happening, most waited patiently in the dining area.  Natasha had a brilliant idea and went out to get vanilla ice cream.  Once the pies were done some sort of odd domestic peace and tranquility fell over the compound.
“What do you plan on doing now?” Barton asked, his curiosity perked.
“No…  Tony she took our team, our family.”  He whispered desolately with an undeniable quiver.
Tony mused regretfully. Steve would indeed, if he were here…
He tried to think of anything that he said that could be misinterpreted. He was on his best behavior, however, and again if he said anything stupid Steve would have called him out on it. He eventually came to the conclusion that Calamity must have interfered somehow. For the life of him Tony could not figure out when the shift happens. There was a moment when the team was gearing up that Steve sat quietly by himself in his room but he seemed to do that often.
When Bucky heard him cry out he rounded on the Shield agents closing in on him using his left arm to utterly devastate them without remorse. With yet another weapon in his possession he whipped around with fiery intensity gripping the powerful firearm tight in his left.
“Do not engage!” Steve shouted at Bucky as he was rapidly gaining on them.
'Yes here! Ellie needs me.'
“You are so stupid!”  Tony nearly wailed.  He grabbed each side of Steve’s face putting a grip on his ears.
"I think that's how…" Barnes pointed to the sky after shooting down two doom bots.
“Oh, thank you, Howard is such a sensational man, I can hardly believe it myself.” She laughed. “Oh, please call me Maria.”
Tony then decided to pipe up yet again.
When they made it outside Ellie had to burst what little pleasant bubble he had.
"Uh…" Was Tony's only response as cold dread ripped through his soul.
Amazed at how at easy and happy he felt at the geniuses entrance. He winced internally, wasn’t he supposed to be on a mission to act normally?
"No!" He shouted in anguish and despair.
"N-no." She answered as she started to sob.
“I will not.” She said firmly.
He smiled at them gratefully.
"Then why fucking don't you!? Really? It would be a whole lot better than having to listen to your cryptic Bullshit!" He shouted fully aware that he was now literally asking for it.
'No! This isn't real.'
“Boss! I’ll protect you!” A tall skinny man ran in front of Harker and was adamant about shielding him.
“He ripped my heart out.” He could see the twins listening intently now.
She moved behind the Captain and put her hands on his shoulders.
Xavier was glad he hadn’t scared the good Captain by talking to him in ‘that’ way.
When he felt far enough away he hid behind a dumpster and he pulled out a ball cap, hoodie and a pair of aviators out of his pack. He also pulled out a blanket and set it aside. He put on the hat, shirt and glasses before wrapping his shield in the blanket. He squared off the edges making it look like it was neatly folded up, then he strapped the shield to his pack, it rested right against his back. He walked past an old shop window and was glad to note that he looked like an ordinary transient. Easily overlooked. He did not know exactly where he was going to go next but he definitely knew he had to get out of the city.
"If it's that bad I'll change." He said through gritted teeth.
Without any further ado, on with the show!
Steve was shocked out of his daydream at the sound of Tony’s voice.
Barton snorted derisively. “Like she told us why.” He said. “All she said was that Tony here has only 0.5% chance at figuring it out, assuming the right conditions are met.”
"Angie, you turn the car around, I'll go get Ellie." He ordered sternly.
He felt himself being pulled close to cold armor. He glanced to the side using every last ounce of his strength to locate Bucky. He was lying on the street unconscious a few yards away.
“I may or may not have chased a slippery nipple with a Jaeger bomb. Then subsequently had taken six shots of whatever was handed to me at this raging hot party and never mind, asshole, laugh it up!” Tony almost squealed indignantly.
‘Why!? Why is it always electricity!?’ The Captain shouted in his head.
The Soldier had just, quite apparently, returned from a mission with Nat and Barton. He was still decked out in his combat armor and his new arm gleamed menacingly in the light.
“Again, why keep that from me?!”
He showed what it felt like to wake up in a world vastly different than the one he left behind. He was so lost and afraid and his hell became worse when he found himself completely and utterly alone. He showed her what it was like to finally have a new mission, a new team and a new family. He showed her all of the horrible things he’s had to witness in these modern times including everything that was happening with Calamity. He shared with her his deep sorrow over learning he was the keystone and everything that represents.
She stood there in her little Mary Janes and a long baby blue nightgown with lace at the cuffs and hem. Her arms were outstretched to reach for him but too afraid to touch him. He was about to reach for her then he heard a voice, a whisper.
Thor shook his head and replied, “It was from a time long past. Eons ago my people had discovered a planet of ruin during my grandfather’s time. Not a single soul was found. But artifacts unearthed suggests that a race once existed that could have been as advanced as our own race at the time. Among the artifacts was this etching.” Thor held the drawing up once more.
"Aww." She bemoaned.
Upon entry, he noted how relatively barren the structure was. Really? What was he expecting?
Tony had just single-handedly delivered the finishing blow to Steve’s already broken heart. Of all the things he could have said in that moment Tony had uttered the very things that had always plagued and haunted his soul since he could remember. That he would be useless, worthless, expendable and unwanted to those who he cared about most.
Steve winked at her and turn to a random page and began to read her “The One-Eyed Doe.”
“OK, you two almost had sex?” She questioned.
"Hello, welcome to Francesca's. I'm Anna, how may help you." Anna, greeted pleasantly.
A/N: Welcome back my faithful earthlings. Keep those tissues on hand, we might be needing them.
Calamity if the Rhododendron killed them all.
He turned to his team and addressed them. “Well, I think it would be a good idea to let everybody know that we all have reason to hope now. It would definitely boost everybody’s morale at this point.” He said with a painful smile.
“Thank you for telling me that at least.”  The Captain said with gratitude.
He began to maneuver through the streets, picking paths that had a thinner number of zappers.
"The others sure as hell didn't." The man replied, then looked over Steve's shoulder. "I like that one better." He nodded.
“I want a Sentinel backup. As much as you can while we’re here.”
“We are going to look at that program before we turn in.” Stated Natasha, pulling Clint along to go to their favorite work station.  Everyone left the room leaving just Steve and Tony by themselves.
“Time to clean up.” Tony said finally.
She squeezed Bucky’s hands then leaned over and patted Tony on the cheek. She gave him another small meaningful smile before walking out of the room.
Barnes only nodded as he began to sort through Tony’s personal files once more.
“Maybe he’s an actual human being who’s happy for once.” Countered Steve.
Where before its spatial manifestation was about fifty meters in diameter, it was now a good eighty. Using his scanner, Iron Man located all five of the focal spatial disorders.
