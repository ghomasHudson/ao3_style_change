He wished Tony didn’t have to close himself up in his study, though, but Steve understood there were things Tony needed to do to get ready, and he was grateful for the warning. There was a part of him that worried the reason Tony was doing it was because he didn’t want to be around Steve, but Tony had specifically said he could get him if necessary, so in all likelihood it wasn’t Tony distancing himself again. That had honestly been the hardest part of the punishment, the emotional separation, even though Tony had been in the same room.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” she said, because they both knew how much damage that would do in the current situation, but she said it kindly, recognizing how upset Tony was.
He’s so drunk on desire that it takes him a moment to realize that Steve’s noises could actually be a bad thing, and he drags his tentacles out with his hands when they don’t pull out right away. Steve’s wings thrash against the surface of the water in reaction, and he pants, “In, put them in, oh, please, Tony, Tony,” and Tony’s thrilled to comply.
It implied letting people see him for the man he was, and that was vaguely terrifying to be perfectly honest.
But whatever.  It was probably better in the long run not to have sex with Steve.  Virgins were a huge pain in the ass, dropping feelings left and right, and there’d be enough damn expectations being his first Dom—his first Dom, what the ever-loving fuck—because even if Tony didn’t
“Only if that’s what you want, Steve. I don’t need you to do that for me,” Tony said, serious enough to break Steve’s heart all over again.
But no matter how caught up he was in Tony’s kisses, reality eventually reasserted itself when he jammed his elbow against the stall a few too many times.
It felt a little odd to walk across the entire room with Tony just watching him, however, so much so that he started wondering if he always walked liked this, or were his arms swinging slightly further than usual, and why did he take such big steps? He made it to Tony without tripping over his feet, which he was grateful for, and he stopped a short distance away from him.
He pushed off from the wall and straightened up, letting the weight of his decision settle on his shoulders.
“C’mon, Puppy,” Tony said, his voice hoarse, his hand sliding around Steve’s side to curl over the head of Steve’s cock. “I want to see you come.”
He was invited to speak at Tony’s funeral. Not the private one at the lake house where Tony had found a piece of paradise with Pepper and Morgan before Steve had shown up and set him on the path to his death. The public one, where his words were transmitted all around the world in honor of the man who’d saved them all.
“You said you wanted to do your job. I was assuming you meant kicking evil-doers’ ass and not like working part-time at Starbucks or something.”
“Your Blue Boy has you wrapped around his finger, Thor.  Have a care that he never discovers this and be tempted to abuse that power,” Fandral had said once, his tone light, but his eyes without humor.
“Now, I knew a doctor a few years back who had a patient that would … well, let’s just say this person made a noise of a feline nature during an exam. Not all the time, mind you, but whenever the speculum went in and whenever it went out, there’d always be an accompanying sound.”
It’s not completely honest, he knows, and he imagines it’s going to skew his results, but he can’t bring himself to confess. Right now, Dr. Stark thinks he’s suffering and doesn’t consider him some kind of sexual deviant, and Steve would like to keep it that way for as long as he can.
He takes a half-step towards Tony before he realizes what he’s doing. Tony, who touches his tongue to the corner of his lips in a way that frankly should be illegal in forty two states, his gaze drifting down for a fraction of a second, scraping along Steve’s skin, before being jerked back up, and fuck. Steve doesn’t really need to shower, does he? He’s just going to get dirty again in a minute, right?
There’s no question about who would win in a contest of strength, and while Tony could--and will--probably put something together that can keep Steve right where he wants him, there’s nothing but Steve’s desire to please keeping him where he is right now.
“My . . . my car broke down about two miles east of town,” the man said, oddly tentative even though his eyes were running all over Tony like he didn’t know where to look first but couldn’t bear to miss any of it.  “The sheriff said I should come here, that you can fix just about anything.”
,” Joe had said, rolling his eyes.  “Jeez, Dad.”) were talking.  He'd been sitting in there with them until Fury had called him out.
Or that Tony’s seen him naked. More than once. Or that during each visit, Tony has had his fingers as well as—
loving him the way he should, Steve thought, feeling sick, and he had to breathe out of his mouth, because he hadn’t once stopped and considered whether the fucking machine was anything other than a way to hurt him. Because he was always willing to believe the worst of Tony, whenever he could.
“I told you that you wanted to get drunk,” Tony says, smiling.  “I was just the lucky guy sitting next to you in the bar.  You, my friend, can drink tons of alcohol.  Seriously,
And how that made him tense, hearing those words, because Tony had been trying to do the right thing all this time, and Steve had always assumed he’d choose the opposite.
being Uncle Steve, liked how trustingly Morgan would slip her hand into his when they walked to the park, loved her bright mind and her sweet humor, and he was grateful to Pepper for letting him be part of her life.
“Alright?” Tony asked, and he nodded. He had the urge to settle into parade rest, but that was him just trying to find comfort in formality, so he forced himself to stand normally instead.
It flustered Dr. Reynolds as well, who said, “Dr. Fury explicitly stated that I was to check up on all aspects of Steve’s health, including—”
They mate twice more before Steve falls into an exhausted slumber, and Tony wishes he could lay down next to Steve, but he doesn’t belong on land. He’d dry out if he spent all night there, already has a sunburn on his face from how long he’s been above water. It’s painful seeing Steve and being unable to hold him the way he wants, and it frustrates Tony to no end.
For those of you interested, I am writing a Nostalgia AU that's a little less angst-filled if you want to check it out
But something changed with his submission, either the angle maybe, or Tony had realized he wasn’t going anywhere, or maybe just that his body had rearranged itself enough that it stopped hurting so much, but Tony’s frantic thrusts started to feel … better. Not quite good, but they hinted at something that
(There was a part of him that sneered at the idea of being a bad Sub, but it was the same part that had looked down on Star—on
, the one who mattered the most, and while he wouldn’t get that emotionally, he damn well was going to get it sexually.
Tony busied himself with pouring wine into both their glasses. “It’s a busy time of year for the business unfortunately. She was planning to fly back to LA tonight, but she says ‘hi’ and is sorry she missed you.” Because she wanted to punch Steve in his face, he didn’t add.
Steve honestly didn’t know how to feel about it, but Tony said he would play games with Steve and take him on walks, and while the idea of Tony doing that was mortifying, it was also something he could look forward to. A little. Spending time with Tony, doing what Tony wanted, being good for him. Being Tony’s good boy.
He changes two more times before he finally settles on an outfit, and even then, he only stops because he doesn’t want to be late. He hasn’t been this anxious before a date since he was getting ready to take Peggy to the movies after four years of crushing on her from afar, and he feels ridiculous, but he also can’t stop smiling.
“That we were still contracted back then.” Steve took a few steps into the living room. “Why did you let me think you and Nick had terminated our contract?”
“See you tomorrow!” he called, slamming the door behind him and leaving Steve’s apartment that much dimmer in his absence.
“I was going to call after Nick died, but then I was being pursued by SHIELD, and it was just easier to tell myself I was keeping you safe by not contacting you. And then … then I found out Bucky was still alive,” he said, and Tony’s body jerked around as he stared at him. By the expression on his face, Steve knew he didn’t have to explain who Bucky was. “Hydra had him,” Steve said and looked at the floor, forcing himself not to think about what Bucky must have gone through. What he might still be going through. “But he’s alive.”
“There’s not much to do here,” Steve said a trifle meanly, and it was both true and not, but he was rattled from what he’d learned and how he’d learned it, and he hadn’t expected Stark to be waiting for him.
Tony shoved him, and Steve blinked up at him from his position on the floor. Tony looked just as surprised as he felt, and no wonder. He was
“I’m good,” Stark said, getting up quickly. He rolled his neck and squared his shoulders. “Keep it coming.”
Tony pulled Steve closer to him, heedless of the pain it caused him, tentatively at first but then with greater strength as Steve let himself be held.
“Just rinse off,” Tony said, standing so he was in the middle of the rest of the spray. “You already took a shower earlier.”
Because of the gym? Because of his reaction? And why now?  Why was Stark—unless something had happened yesterday to lead up to it. Had Pepper said something to Stark after breakfast? Was that why she’d come back? She’d been incredibly kind to him during breakfast, but maybe that had been an act. What if she didn’t approve of Steve? Stark had said she liked him, but that didn’t make it true.
“I’m not saying you have to do anything too intense. A little scene here and there can go a long way. It doesn’t even have to be sexual,” she said, although her expression turned slightly dubious; she knew from experience how Tony got during play. “It’s just that from everything you've told me, Tony, the last thing—the very
Tony still hadn’t figured out if Steve had an oral fixation so much as a love of sucking cock—or at least, a love of what sucking cock did for him—but whatever the case, Tony appreciated the results. Steve couldn’t get Tony’s cock deep enough in his throat to satisfy himself, which wasn’t to say he didn’t try, again and again, his nose pressing against Tony’s abdomen as his throat spasmed around Tony’s length, Steve struggling to relax and fighting against it at the same time, because he
Ever since Tony had burst into the room, he’d been fighting the impulse to touch Steve—what if he didn’t want it? What if he didn’t want it but let Tony do it anyway? He still wasn’t sure it was the right move, but knowing how much Steve was hurting, he couldn’t
“You didn’t wear me out,” Steve protested, although the huskiness of his voice didn’t do anything to support his claim. “I was still tired from my mission.”
.  You’re the one who showed us all the news reels and comics, and we all love—”  She glanced at his face.  “We all
“Are you alright?” Natasha asked softly, and Steve looked at her in surprise. He hadn’t noticed her come up. He’d been trying to give Dr. Martin and her husband what privacy he could in the small jet, but he couldn’t help but overhear them sometimes, and their words to each other made his heart ache with sympathy.
“Well, look on the bright side. At least it’s free mediocre food,” Steve says and wonders at the snort Tony lets out.
“Aha!” Tony said, twisting and shoving in order to take advantage of Steve’s momentary lapse in attention and his unbalanced position.
Although, if anything, that seems to prove his point. Here he is, getting lost in daydreams, and Tony’s just … standing there.
Still, when Tony accepted the mug with a heartfelt “thank you” and took a sip, sighing in contentment, it filled Steve with hope—irrationally and foolishly maybe, but it was true nonetheless. It was just a cup of coffee. But it seemed like so much more than that.
“I don’t really … know how long exactly, but—” Steve licked his lips, his body language tense and unhappy, and Tony watched as he came to some sort of resolution, his shoulders lifting up rigidly. “But I only realized how I felt a few days ago. The n-night I came back.”
himself—and it’d be like throwing a cup of water into the ocean really.  Whatever, that wasn’t important anyway.
Steve, on the other hand, only a small group of people had known who he really was, and he had grown up in a time before the Internet, before people could find out your life story with the click of the mouse, so this had to be excruciating for him.  To make matters a zillion times worse, no guy wanted to admit how little (zero, zilch, nil, nada) experience he had.  And then the fact that Fury was offering Tony a place on the Avengers made him think he was their last resort.  That they didn’t have another Dom lined up after him.  It was Tony or nothing for Steve, and hell, if Tony had been in Steve’s position, he’d be demanding a pen to sign on the dotted line—Tony was quite the catch after all—but instead, Steve was just standing there, looking miserable and almost defeated, and fuck it.
So yeah, he hadn’t expected to beat Steve. But like, give him a small challenge? Maybe get a hit or two in? Show that he could handle himself? Was that asking too much?
But Steve had no intention to say anything of the kind, and he let out a long sigh as Tony began to nuzzle his stomach. It was almost ticklish as Tony kept the touch light, but it also felt good, all that heat and the promise of weight behind it. It felt even better when Tony pushed the T-shirt he’d borrowed from Dr. Strange aside.
It’s the tone of voice, Steve decides later after he’s gotten Tony his tablet from his bedroom for the third time that day.  It’s so mild and
Steve’s eyes fell to Tony’s neck without thought, looking for red, for any signs indicating what Tony might have been doing last night, even though he’d obviously changed since yesterday—and then Steve immediately forced himself to look away.
“You don’t want to sit down?” Tony asked politely but without the normal warmth, but Steve would get it back. He had to. He shook his head.
“Unbelievable, Tones,” Rhodes said, shaking his head. “Only you would save a race of people that had the technology to bring you back and the determination to do whatever it took to accomplish it.”
“But that much?” Steve asked, his fingers straightening slowly, gesturing towards the lines that criss-crossed Tony’s skin.
“I wouldn’t do that,” Steve said, looking self-righteous and offended, and Tony supposed he should be feeling grateful that whatever his feelings about the matter, Steve was willing to try to make it bearable at least, but what he was actually thinking was, seriously?  Was there anything that
“Maybe we shouldn’t,” he said, his hand down Tony’s pants.  “There were only two other couples in the store.  They’ll notice we’re missing—”
, he thought, even though it was a lie, just like he’d lied every time before that when he’d promised he’d start believing in Tony. It had never happened, and now there were no more chances.
“Steve, it matters that you’re trying to fix things with me. That you didn’t give up on us. You know that, right?”
Steve had eaten with Tony frequently enough to know how he liked his sandwiches, and he assembled three of them, putting them on a plate, as well as grabbing a bottle of water. It was quick, which was important, and besides, there was no reason to make Tony suffer because of his cooking.
Tony stumbled, nearly falling over his own feet, because even though JARVIS had warned him, he hadn’t been prepared for the sight of Steve so humbled and low.
ETA: Oh crap, I forgot to say many, many, many thanks to MetaAllu for the encouragement! <333 You rock, bb. :)
“I’m hurt, Steve, truly and deeply hurt that you would entrust my life into the hands of men that we know nothing about.”  Tony shook his head sadly.  “Just because the tag
He knew it was foolish to wish for impossible things, but he couldn’t help himself. It still hurt to think about Tony, even now, and while he imagined there would come a day when it didn’t anymore, he doubted he’d ever stop missing him completely.
“It’s not how I … imagined our first time happening,” he said, and Tony froze mid-lick. Steve gently pushed his massive head away. “I really care for you, Tony. More than I should probably. And it’s fine if you don’t feel the same way. I never expected you to, and I probably never would’ve told you if this hadn’t happened. Still, you should know that I, um … I volunteered for this.”
“I’m so sorry for everything, Tony,” he says miserably, clutching onto Tony’s shirt, the only thing he’ll have to remind him of Tony, to give him the strength to say goodbye. “I—”
It means, though, that he’s unprepared for the huff of breath against his mouth, the slide of Tony’s tongue; is completely vulnerable to the taste of Tony, less like something new and more like something lost and longed for ever since.
And because Steve’s so frazzled, he says, “Okay, thanks,” for absolutely no reason whatsoever unless he’s thanking Dr. Stark for doing his job and practicing safe hygiene, and fuck, as if everything he’s done so far isn’t enough. Who needs blankets when he has humiliation to keep him warm?
He supposed that he should find a room and unpack.  It was what Stark undoubtedly expected of him; he seemed the type that would want to find Steve neatly tucked away, available for when he wanted to pull him out for his own amusement but not disrupting his life otherwise.
“No,” Steve groaned, hips spasming, thrusting into Tony’s grip, and Tony swallowed heavily, thinking about the wet drag of fabric against Steve’s cock, thinking about how much that kind of friction had to
“No, don’t look like that, no, Steve. I’m not—you’re doing great. You’re not doing anything I don’t want—well, there’s one thing, but that’s my fault.” Tony reached out to cup his cheek, and it made Steve tense, but just until he felt the warmth of Tony’s hand against his face, and then he was melting into the touch. He closed his eyes for a second, biting his lip to keep it from trembling.
Steve stared at his reflection, at the face that stared back at him, no longer gaunt and lined from sickness. Even after the Super Serum, nobody wanted him.
Steve closed his eyes for a second, swallowing heavily, and Tony realized distantly that Steve’s cheeks were dry now, and when had Steve wiped them clean?
He clenched instinctively at being so exposed, and his face burned, but he didn’t stop, started circling one finger over his opening even, the awkwardness of the position be damned. He needed Tony to look, needed Tony to
“Thank you,” Steve said, knowing better than to hold Tony’s words against him.  Not-drugged Tony didn’t think he was attractive.  Not-drugged Tony didn’t like him at all as a matter of fact.  Not-drugged Tony had nearly killed him once or twice.
That morning had been the first time Stark hadn’t wanted to spar. He’d run on the treadmill the entire hour instead and left immediately after, and Steve didn’t know what that meant, just knew that it bothered him more and more the longer he thought about it.
asked him to do anything he couldn’t handle, but here he was, doubting Tony again. Fuck, he just wanted to be good. Why couldn’t he ever be good?
The object was to get some damn excitement in his life, and killing just wasn’t doing it for him anymore.  He had everything he could ever want, fame, money, power, sex, and what was left?
“As in full-on sex?” Clint said, gesturing in a way that made it very clear what he was referring to. “Or like, holding a pillow and letting Tony hump it. What?” he said when everyone looked at him. “It’s a valid question!”
“Hi, Dr. Stark,” he says, and alright, maybe it comes out a little more breathy than he’d planned but— ”
“Steve?” Tony says, and Steve lets out a humiliatingly high laugh as he launches himself away from the door, his cheeks burning. He is the. Absolute. Worst.
“Ma’am?” Steve said, turning away from the window to look at his psychologist. Dr. Leslie Saunders looked to be in her fifties, was always well-groomed, was a Sub, and she started and ended each of their sessions with a kind smile on her face. If Steve had met her in a coffee shop or sat beside her on the subway, he was sure he would’ve liked her. As it was, however, their conversations to date had been stilted and polite, and Steve had never said more than he had to, not because he was trying to be difficult, but because he didn’t know how he was expected to confide in someone who was paid by the hour to act like he was the most important person in the world—someone who was on SHIELD’s payroll besides, because how much privacy could she really guarantee?
“We were under attack,” Tony said, no longer rocking him but still not drawing away.  “Loki and a new damn army.  They managed to capture the two of us and took you away.  When you came back, you were—”
He took a deep breath after she left, glancing around the room, which looked exactly like the last exam room he’d been in, and the one before that, and the one before that, with the possible exception of the art. Maybe.
He’d gone into this prepared for it to hurt. He hadn’t, however, anticipated how good being hurt would feel.
Steve outright shuddered at that, and all the fight drained from his shoulders, leaving him limp and receptive.
They spend the next several seconds fighting for their lives, and there’s just one guy left with less than half health when Tony says, “It means I probably won’t be on Saturday morning either, just so you know.”
Steve had seemed so taken aback by Tony grabbing his wrist. At first, Tony had thought it’d been because Steve had recognized how pointless the action had been when Steve could’ve broken the hold at any time; or maybe it’d been anger that Tony would dare to touch him when they’d stopped sparring; or maybe it’d just been honest surprise that Tony would do it all. But he hadn’t pulled away.
I just thought I’d warn you that I am considering writing a Nostalgia AU (even though I haven’t finished this yet, I know, I know) where society is a little meaner towards Subs and there is a lot of dubcon/“noncon but he likes it” sex. So if you guys see an alert for Nostalgia AU (I’m all about original titles), don’t be surprised, and read the warnings, because it would have amoral!Tony and dive into the hardcore porn much sooner.
He wanted to say that he tried to pay attention, but it would’ve been a lie. Ten minutes later, he still had no idea what was playing, and he didn’t care. He didn’t bother Tony, however, didn’t move all over the place, or sigh, or drum his fingers, or do anything else to express his impatience. He did take several deep, calming breaths, though. If Tony wanted to use this time to actually watch the movie, even though he had a naked and willing Steve on top of him, then who was he to complain?
Some twitch of Steve’s face had Stark saying, “Wait, you disappeared in what, 1945? Which was after Colossus was developed but before ENIAC was finished, and oh fuck, tell me you’ve at least heard of something more advanced than Babbage’s difference engine?”
Steve just shook his head in reply, a fast, jerky movement, but he pushed his chest further into Tony’s fingers, to use and abuse his sweet little nipples, and Tony supposed that was answer enough. Steve really was too good to be true.
“Yes,” he says, or he tries to say anyway, but it comes out so hoarsely that he has to clear his throat and say it again.
Steve waited until he was certain Stark—the name didn’t belong to Howard anymore and wouldn’t ever again—wasn’t coming back before he let himself walk into the apartment, his legs unsteady now that there was no one to prove himself to, his back hunched with the weight of memories and might-have-beens and too many deaths to carry.
It hadn’t been that way a year ago, however. Steve had almost never asked for more than the most superficial things from Tony, things that he hadn’t cared about, that Tony could deny him without hurting him. The only time he’d asked for something that mattered had been when he’d told Tony he’d wanted to apologize, although he wasn’t sure if Tony had understood he’d used that for his one request of the day. He’d needed Tony to hear him out, however, and it was the only way he’d thought he could guarantee that Tony would listen—even if it hadn’t been necessary in the end.
He means to talk to Tony about it, he really does, but Tony is very good at not being where you think he’s going to be, so there’s never a chance to sit down with him one-on-one.  And after two weeks go by without any more orders, he starts to optimistically think that Tony’s given up on the idea.
After all this time, Tony is intimately aware of what Steve smells like when he’s aroused, and apparently while Steve’s eyes were shut, Tony had leaned forward close enough to catch his scent over the pervading aroma of coffee.
Hours, Steve thought, and he couldn’t really imagine what that was going to be like, nervousness  coursing through him. He had no frame of reference for it but thought it’d probably hurt after a while. Even his body couldn’t handle
. And not in the sort of blase “oh yeah, Superman rescued me the other day, just swooped out the sky and tucked me into his manly arms and kept me from being squashed like a pancake because I was looking at my phone instead of the crosswalk sign, and by the way, I managed to get a selfie, and it was kind of amazing” way. No.
Steve stared down at Tony’s hand which was now hovering inches away from him after being yanked away. He hadn’t meant to do that.
“We’re getting into a groove,” he said, honestly enough. There was no reason to mention the occasional bumps in the road.
He hadn’t thought Tony would get anything out of having Steve act like a dog. In the back of his head, he’d started to assume Tony had chosen it in order to emphasize how Steve needed to listen to Tony’s commands and learn to trust him to take care of his needs, to have faith in Tony period. And all of that might still be true, but if Tony also just liked the way Steve looked like this … if Tony got some sort of enjoyment from seeing Steve in fluffy ears and whatever else he was going to wear …
But the larger part simply wanted to drown in Tony’s touch, his scent, wanted to soak up every second of contact while he could, because Tony had barely touched him in days, and Steve had missed it more than he’d thought possible.
He couldn’t rock Steve, but he stroked his arms, rested his head against the back of Steve’s and made shushing noises until the tremors left Steve’s body and he couldn’t hear Steve’s gasping breaths anymore; until his own heart had calmed and he didn’t feel like he was one wrong word away from shattering into a million pieces.
“Until we can be absolutely certain you are who you say you are,” Hill began, and then all hell broke loose as a glowing circle appeared in the room.
He hefted his bag and walked outside, looking at his motorcycle. He hadn’t exactly had anything in mind when he’d started his trip, other than a vague idea of finding
“Take care of yourself,” Tony said, his tone and expression seeming to soften for one fraction of a second, there and gone, and then he was turning away.
Except now that he’s looking at Tony with his tight tank top and unfairly-toned biceps, Steve becomes all too conscious of how he’s sweaty from nerves, his thighs are tacky with slick, his jeans are wet, and Tony’s shirt is still hanging around his hips. It can’t be a good look on him.
“If you—if you’re talking about the marks on my back, then you can’t—” He swallowed loudly, trying to compose himself, shame and guilt and longing running through him. “They aren’t your fault. I was the one who decided—”
He dredged up a smile from somewhere and said, “So think about it, and tell me what you pick. I’d prefer that you don’t use it for the small stuff just to annoy me, like what we’re going to eat for dinner or what we’re going to watch on any given night, but it’s your right either way. Something like yesterday shouldn’t happen again,” and it wouldn’t, his voice said, his tone turning hard, “but if it does, yes, please use it right away.”
He shifted restlessly, not even realizing he was doing it until a pang shot up his legs, and he tried to mask the wince—
“I know you don’t. But it’s there if ever you need it.” His lips quirk. “I guess it was fate that I finished my calculations this morning. Well then. Goodbye, Steve. If it helps at all, I did love you. I just loved him more.”
Steve tried, only stopping when Tony went too deep and Steve had to pull away, coughing, before Tony guided his head back, his hands warm on Steve’s cheek; or when Tony would pause for a few seconds, pushing against Steve’s gag reflex as his throat tried to flex and accommodate his cock, Tony’s dark eyes watching him all the incentive he needed to choke himself further. All the while, Steve kept his hands were they were, his grip probably too tight, but he couldn’t help it; he didn’t want to accidentally let go.
He debated calling Tony on the way to New Jersey with one of the many burner phones they’d gotten. Even though he and Tony weren’t contracted, he knew that SHIELD would put Tony on surveillance and bring him in for questioning since they were living together. As much as Steve wanted to talk to him, It’d be better for Tony if he didn’t know any of Steve’s plans and could truthfully claim he had no idea what was going on. Tony wouldn’t like it … but it was better for him to be as far from Steve right now as possible.
That hope took a blow, however, when Tony finally pulled away and Steve saw the pair of ears he’d picked out. Steve wouldn’t have said that he’d had any expectations of what he’d be wearing, but apparently he would’ve been wrong, because the ears came as a surprise. They were the same color as his hair, and they were long and floppy, falling halfway down his face. If anything, Steve would’ve assumed they’d be short and out of the way, but these grazed against his cheeks every time he so much as twitched, and he could tell they were going to impede his field of vision.
So what if Tony has a date? Tony’s probably had tons of dates while they’ve known each other and just hasn’t told Steve about them. It doesn’t change anything. It’s not like they’re ever going to meet up or anything. Tony lives in California after all.
"Sure, sure, I'm all for adjusting plans on the fly, but on a daily basis, routine things.  A higher ranking officer says 'jump,' and you say 'how high,' right?"
For a brief moment, it’d been almost everything he’d wanted, and without even seeing her, Steve had yes.
Steve’s steps faltered. What kind of Dom was Tony? The answer was obvious. The more appropriate question was what kind of Sub was he?
“Yes, thank you, I’m fine,” he says but starts regretting it a few seconds later, because he doesn’t know how he hasn’t noticed the air conditioning is on, but he has no doubt that he’s painting pink, pointy bullseyes on his chest right now.
, oh, Tony. Tony,” Steve said, shuddering, hips jerking under Tony’s hands. He distinctly heard a screech of metal, and he suspected Steve had just bent his headboard beyond repair, but he didn’t stop to check, too focused on the sight of Steve taking him in, on how Steve felt on his cock. For a man who’d been stretched out with four fingers, Steve was somehow still incredibly tight around him, and Tony wondered what it’d take to make him sloppy and loose—
He could make up all the excuses that he liked, but he knew why he hadn’t tried to go through with it yet. He was nervous. Unbearably so. But not because he thought he’d embarrass himself or that Tony would be disappointed in his performance.
Tony spent the next ten minutes getting dressed and saying things like, “Are you crazy? You’re so crazy. Why are you so crazy?”
“You’re right, wrong tactic.  Please,” he said, brown eyes large and soulful, and jeez, why couldn’t he say no to him?  “It would mean a lot to me.”
Oddly enough, it turned out that thinking about the reason why he was so aroused just made the problem worse, and he needed to stop if he ever wanted to be decent.
“Please, Tony,” he said, his voice cracking, and he didn’t know where to put his hands now that he was done with his task, so he kept them at his side, curled into fists.
say anything until his punishment was over. “It’s okay, Steve,” he said, a note in his voice that made Steve bite down harder to keep back the sound that wanted to slip past as Tony’s thumb glided over his cheek. “I’m going to take care of you,” Tony said, and Steve swallowed convulsively, pressing more firmly against Tony’s hand. He wanted that. So much.
“Wait. Before you—there’s something—” He forced himself to take a shaky breath. “Do you remember when I asked for a punishment and you said no? Th-that the only way you’d do it would be if
Steve never had to deal with being a sickly, ninety pound weakling and flirts with Tony as easily as breathing, while
“Tony,” Pepper said, and Tony knew she was going to bring the conversation back around to Steve, even though he’d much prefer to reminisce about his and Happy’s exploits.  Or anything else really.  “I don’t think there’s anyone in the world who knows about your tendency to make spur-of-the-moment decisions better than I do, but this is another man’s
After Tony had gone downstairs, after Steve put everything back where it’d belonged and cleaned himself up and somehow managed to put himself back together, he’d worked for a while on finding Bucky, but it’d been a struggle to gather the shreds of his attention into anything resembling focus.
Being on his knees is only slightly better for Steve, and he sways into Tony, his thighs shuddering as they try to hold his weight. Tony’s tempted to take it even further, but this is enough for now, he thinks. Maybe next time he’ll take Steve all the way down.
“I never said I wanted to break our contract,” and there something in Steve’s voice that made Tony pause but only for a second.
He shifts slightly, his cock rubbing against the mattress, the ache inside his body going all the way up his spine.  Of course, that just might make it better . . .
It meant a lot to him that Steve was willing to give them the time to get back into some kind of groove, but Steve had obligations: a team of his own and deadlines. He had a network outside of Tony, and truthfully, Tony was glad for it. He hadn’t liked the isolation of their previous time together, and the fact that it wasn’t an issue anymore took a load off his mind.
, and for once it’s his heart and not his loins that melt into a puddle of goo. There’s no reason for Tony to lie about that, because it has to be painfully obvious that Steve’s a sure thing, like do not pass Go, do not collect $200, just go straight to Tony and sit on his dick like Steve’s been wanting to do for years now.
“So let me get this straight,” Rhodes said after they’ve finished rounds and rounds of debriefing and were sitting on couches surrounding Tony. Rhodes had retired as War Machine almost five years ago and been promoted to General, and while he’d had access to all of the interviews with Tony, he hadn’t been allowed to be present in case Tony broke free and tried to kill everyone. “Aliens
Tony walked into the penthouse a few minutes later, purposefully not looking directly at Steve in order to give him time to collect himself and said, “You know, when I said you could pick whatever room you wanted, I didn’t actually mean the living room, but I like it. Everyone should aim big.”
There hadn’t been an ounce of hesitation in Tony’s actions. He’d been confident that Steve would enjoy everything he did, and he’d been right. Steve had more than enjoyed them. He’d been thinking about them ever since whenever he had a spare moment, and even when he didn’t, random thoughts intruding without his permission. Tony made him want things he hadn’t had in a very long time, and it was almost unfair that it’d happened right before a mission, because he couldn’t give it half the focus he wanted to.
Steve glared at the verbal jab, but he didn’t bother denying the necessity of being able to abuse Tony in private. Asshole.
Tony ran his hand over his mouth, and Steve felt his stomach swoop sickeningly when he noticed how unsteady it was.
Steve blinks and tries to organize his thoughts.  Tony obviously isn’t telling him everything—like why Steve proposed of all things—not that Steve would mind getting to know Tony better—c’mon, Steve, get it together!
“I can do it however you want me to, Steve,” he said, putting words to action and squeezing hard enough that Steve’s knees buckled, his fingers pressing bruises into Tony’s skin.  “Is this too much for you?”
“Alright, so why don’t you take off your pants and underwear and lie down on the bed. There’s a sheet you can place across your lap, if you’d like. I’ll just step outsi—oh damn,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve blinks, because he might have been getting distracted. “I’m sorry. There was a blackout for a second right before you got here, and I was going to check on the machine,” he says, gesturing to the black screen of the computer, “but I forgot. I have to boot this up and put your information in. I know it’s a little unorthodox, but would you mind if I stayed in the room while you got undressed? It’ll save the both of us a lot of time.”
Life would be so much easier if he were a Beta.  Betas slipped under the radar without all the annoying preconceptions of what they were or what they were capable of.  People left Betas the fuck alone without all the "it's your
, ha, yeah.  He groans as Steve applies the makeshift bandage, everything turning hazy around the edges from the pain, and it’s all he can do to not throw up.  When Steve lifts him off the ground, it’s a relief to let go, the blackness sucking him under, down and down and down.
He raises his glass in a silent toast to the vacant seat across from him.  It’s the only reason he sees the shape out of the corner of his eye.
He winced. He still couldn’t believe he’d said that. If he’d ever wanted to highlight the difference in their experience, that had definitely been the way to do it. Crap.
When it finally hit him what Tony was expecting, he flushed hotly, looking down, and yes, it was still embarrassing, but it seemed less daunting in comparison to ask for something so straightforward. “May I suck your cock?”
His angel just tastes like … Tony doesn’t even know what he tastes like. Nothing in the ocean compares, nor anything the Humans have brought to Atlantis as gifts. He hates that the taste is muted since the receptors in his tentacles aren’t as strong as the ones on his tongue, and he’s never wanted to put his mouth on someone more than he does right now. He wants to lap at his Angel’s sweetness until he can’t taste anything else ever again, and it’s shocking just how quickly and how deeply he gets aroused.
“Send me the feed,” he said, pulling out his phone. He intended to just take a quick peek and gauge Steve’s mood before braving the lion’s den. He didn’t expect to catch him sitting on the couch, however, staring out at nothing, defeat etched in every line of his body.
Should he interrupt him? No, that’d be rude to expect Tony to drop everything just because he’d gotten back. He’d should wait until Tony was finished.
to me, Tony,” Steve snarled, and Tony would’ve jerked away at the harshness in his voice if Steve hadn’t gasped, “
Steve kind of wants to ask if they had sex, but it sounds like they didn’t, and he thinks he might come off more hopeful than he should all things considered, so he refrains.  Tony seems interested, though, so maybe later they could . . . although Steve
“Not exactly anyway. I know I made it out to be, and of course it’s an aspect of it, but the reason we’re down here is because you’d mentioned you’d like to try it, and I wanted to see you try it, and after yesterday, I thought we could both do with something good for a while.”
Bucky would make so much fun of him, he thought, his mouth twisting wistfully. He remembered how he’d teased him when he was mooning over Peggy.
“The bedrooms are down that hall.  Feel free to redecorate your room, although I warn you that Pepper picked out a lot of the art on the walls, and she can be nasty when you don't agree with her choices.  Just tell me what you want, though, and I’ll get it for you.  Or rather JAR—”
“I—yes,” Steve said, confused but latching onto the fact that Tony had decided to keep him. That was all that mattered. “I’ll do whatever it takes—”
“Which one is mine?” Steve asked, still standing in the doorway like he wasn't sure if he was going to come in.  Tony hated to break it to him, but Steve had already signed the contract, so vacillating at this point was too little, too late.
“I think I understand already,” Tony said, his voice calm, steady, and Steve’s head jerked up, but Tony’s eyes weren’t blank anymore. They were indifferent. Tony looked at Steve as if he didn’t even see him anymore, and Steve’s body went numb with panic. Tony was … Tony didn’t …
“I know it’s sudden,” Steve said, and the apologetic expression on his face went a long way in curbing Tony’s more panicked thoughts. “Some new intel came in, and if we don’t go now—”
And the milking! He thought milking might be the bane of his existence. It felt so good to start out with,
Dr. Stark, whose gaze flicks down to the tent in the sheet and freezes there for a second, before moving back up to Steve’s face, and it’s all Steve can do not to cover his face in shame.
didn’t have a rule like that for himself. Steve had assumed at the time that was because Tony wouldn’t hesitate to let him know in vulgar and explicit detail all the things he expected Steve to do. Like with so many other things, however, Steve had been wrong.
But Tony feels … amazing. The scratch of his beard, the softness of his lips, the way his hand eventually comes up to first cup Steve’s jaw and then drag back into his hair, Steve’s imagined all of it, time and time again, but it’s always been hazy in the past. (Quick too, if he’s being honest, a prelude to fantasies about unforgiving fingers and a thick cock, and he is ashamed of himself, okay, but considering how his interactions with Tony normally go, he thinks it’s understandable.)
“But when I woke up, there you were,” Steve says, and he sounds awed, grateful, and Tony feels so much love for him that it seems impossible to contain it. “I need you again,” he tells him, and Tony pulls him into his arms.
Steve started to sit up, so Tony moved to accommodate him, trying to hide the wince as he straightened. Fuck, his back.
to keep it from happening, because in all the time Steve had known Tony and seen him hit on pretty much anything that moved, Tony had never once indicated he thought of Steve as anything other than a friend.
good, Tony’s fingers inside of him, pressing and rubbing . . .  The sensations would build up, everything spiraling upward, pleasure turning sharp and aching—and then it would seep away, leaving him unfulfilled, like a promise, broken, heightening the yearning but taking away the need. He’d seek out Tony that much more frequently as a result, only to have Tony toy with him once again, drawing everything out until he felt like a strand of taffy at the edge of breaking apart. Only then would Tony let him climax, when the tension had ratcheted up exponentially, so it felt like an explosion when Steve finally came, and he was ruined in its wake.
He actually hadn’t intended to instate rule six for a few more weeks since he’d been hoping to establish more of a relationship with Steve first, but fuck that. After Steve’s reaction to his offer to give him some freedom, he could have rule six if he wanted to.
Steve has a moment to absorb the fact that there’s nowhere left to hide, and then the sheet, which Steve has managed to keep dry by some miracle up until this point, is clinging like a second skin to his buttocks, and the scent of his slick gets so strong that it pours out from around the drape and
Although maybe part of that was because Steve was coming, Tony realized hazily, as Steve clenched rhythmically around him, grinding against the mattress and gasping like he couldn’t get enough air, just from Tony pushing in.
Okay, so I am on tumblr again. http://some-blue-jack.tumblr.com/ I don't post much that's fandom related, and I'm all over the place really, so why anyone would want to follow me, I have no idea. BUT sometimes I want to ask for writing prompts, so I need people to follow me so you guys can give me ideas. *puppy dog eyes*
Understand? Steve understood that Tony was willing to let him orgasm but that he didn’t want to to be easy for him. Steve would have to work for it, which was fine. Good even. The fact that Tony was allowing him to try had to mean something. Didn’t it?
But while Steve had gotten his fair share of appreciative glances and comments and understood that he was considered handsome
But Tony had never announced he’d contracted with a Sub either. And while the coffee shop was on the third floor and only accessible to employees, there’d be no mistaking what the two of them holding hands meant.
“When you told me you wanted to get drunk, I didn’t realize how determined you were, but wow.  When you go for something, you really go for it, don’t you?” the guy asks, brown eyes crinkling as he smiles, and Steve realizes to his dismay that the reason he’s feeling so poorly is that he’s suffering from the worst hangover he’s ever experienced.  Apparently, he had somehow gotten drunk last night.  He hadn’t known that was possible.
“Sorry, I guess I’m still n-n-nervous,” Steve says, stuttering as Dr. Stark pushes all the way inside, his knuckles digging into Steve’s ass. Fuck.
He’d known that Tony had cared. What he hadn’t known was how much. And he still didn’t, honestly, but he couldn’t have hurt Tony to that degree unless his feelings for Steve had been a lot deeper than he’d grasped back then.
They were going fast enough that Steve didn’t consciously think about sweeping Stark’s legs out from underneath him. Stark had left himself wide open, and his body took the opening before his mind could catch up.
Dr. Stark hasn’t explicitly asked him if he’s had either of those side effects after all. Steve wouldn’t actually be
Steve made himself a sandwich while he was waiting, no longer in the mood for breakfast foods or for eating much at all really, but knowing his stomach would complain sooner rather than later if he skipped a meal. He put everything away, hesitating a moment on the pancake batter, before deciding to save it for tomorrow, hating the idea of wasting food but without much hope that they’d eat it the next morning. Not if that morning was anything to go by.
It wouldn’t do to stare for too long, however, not this first time, although Tony had plans for one day, wondered if Steve would agree to lounging around naked for Tony’s viewing pleasure, would bend over and hold himself open for Tony to take advantage of—or not—as he saw fit. Tony wouldn’t want him to get bored, of course, so maybe a vibrating cock ring to keep him focused and nipple clamps that tugged ever so sweetly whenever he moved. Tony couldn’t decide if he’d prefer to leave Steve’s ass untouched and waiting for him, or if he wanted to split him open on something huge, so he’d cry with gratitude when Tony took it out, but maybe he’d do both.
“I included the predicament bondage, so you could keep control, so you could decide when and how the machine moved. You could take a break if you needed to, and I’d be able to monitor the frequency of those and how much force you exerted for each one. It’d let me know when you couldn’t handle it anymore, so we could stop.”
“Nooo … that’s not ...” Tony takes a deep breath. “Some doctors want the option to have um, attachments. To help omegas during heats. There’s a small but still significant number of patients who need to be monitored during a heat, and a lot of doctors would prefer to keep that in-house instead of sending their patients somewhere else, which can be infeasible because of price or distance or what have you.”
Tony moved his feet out of them, shaking them off, and Steve absently folded the jeans, resting them on top of the shoes.
Steve learned a lot about himself in the next few weeks. He learned that he actually had very little patience when it came to … many things; that Tony could get him hard and aching with just a filthy, filthy smile; that pain could be very good indeed—and he would never forget being bent over Tony’s lap that first time, trying to muffle his sounds into the cushions as Tony brought his hand down over and over again—that he hated and loved nipple clamps in equal measure; and that the minimum number of orgasms he needed in one day could go up after all.
He let the material hang from his hand. “Excuse me, ma’am, but . . . I thought this was just going to be a routine physical.”
Steve rolled his eyes, but what did he know?  He’d gone from being a tall, gorgeous, extremely fit man with short blond hair to a tall, gorgeous, extremely fit man with long blond hair.  He couldn’t understand Tony’s pain.
Until it isn't anymore, the speculum sliding out of him with another gush of slick that no longer seems sexy at all, and Steve feels cold and small as Dr. Stark turns off the lamp and moves away, peeling his gloves off.
He had to resist the urge to touch Steve in order to offer some kind of comfort that, at best, Steve wouldn’t feel, and at worst, would pull him from his desperately-needed rest.
Now he was back, though, acting like no time had passed at all and offering things Tony had made himself forget he’d ever wanted.
“Please keep in mind that he didn’t ask for this either, alright?” she said, and he nodded, because there wasn’t any way Steve would let him forget.
He got up, the sound of the stool scraping against the wood too loud, but at least it filled the silence. At least he could concentrate on carefully setting his plate into the sink instead of how quiet Steve was, and it was only coincidence that he didn’t look at Steve again and not because he was avoiding his eyes. “Let me know when you’ve chosen,” he said before turning tail and fleeing.
If I do another installment of this series, I think we'll get to hear more from Tony. Steve kind of directed the show this time around, but I think Tony should get a chance as well, right?
Clark was pretty used to it all in all, and he’d smiled and been effortlessly charming and sweet and bashful, and if Dick hadn’t been a Superman stan already, meeting him would’ve done it and then some.
Oh. He raises his head and catches a glimpse of Dr. Stark reaching for the lube and the speculum, the first of which isn't necessary, the second of which definitely is. He drops back onto the pillow.
“Please, don’t apologize. You didn’t do anything wrong. I’m just … nervous.” If “nervous” now means humiliated but still wildly turned on and barely resisting the urge to shove Dr. Stark’s hands between his legs.
It wasn’t going to be the close-range fighting they’ve been doing up until now, so they agreed that a win would be when one person managed to hit the other with a weapon in their arsenal (in Steve’s case, his fist or his shield). Tony had the obvious advantage, but then, Steve had always had the advantage when they’d sparred before, and Tony had never complained. Besides, Tony had brought him to a place where the terrain could be used in his favor, a heavy forest surrounding the meadow the helicopter had landed in. Tony would have to slow down in order to avoid colliding with anything, and the trees would provide a lot of cover.
Steve tried to resist, he did, tried to ignore Tony’s hangdog expression and harden his resolve, but it was pointless.  He’d known he was going to go along with whatever Tony wanted as soon as he’d barged into his apartment.
“Right,” Tony said, licking his lips and watching Captain America follow the drag of his tongue, sweat beading on his forehead.  “I totally believe you.”
“Are you normally this tight?” Dr. Stark asks, and there’s something about the way that he says it that makes Steve shudder, makes him feel like he’s going to drench the whole damn floor in slick, and his thighs fall open from where they’d been trying to close.
Steve hesitated, and Tony didn’t push. He wanted to give Steve something special, more than a rushed kiss that was over before it could properly begin and more than something casual that could happen between anyone. He wanted it to have meaning, and considering their past, that was probably asking for a lot considering they had a clock ticking over their heads, but he was going to try anyway.
“I—yes, but—” They frequently watched a movie or played games after dinner, so there wasn’t anything particularly unusual about Tony’s request, but . . .
“I’m not marrying you,” he repeated instead, trying to infuse the words with as much conviction as possible.
For the prompts “Proper use of first aid” (Cap_Ironman bingo) and “Undercover operation” (Avengers_Tables).  Title from Fun's "We Are Young."
It didn’t make Steve feel any more comfortable about the idea, however. Growing up, his mother and then someone from the orphanage had accompanied him to his medical visits, and after he’d moved to the boarding house, Bucky had done it whenever he could.
ready, Steve shooting off less than two seconds later. Tony worked him through it, though, stroking his cock for real, even if he probably didn’t give it the attention it deserved. He was too caught up in the way Steve kept clenching around him, the aftershocks of his orgasm lasting for so long that if Tony had been there for his most recent climax, he would’ve thought it’d been weeks since Steve had one.
Steve’s shoulder hunch, as if making himself smaller will solve anything. What if Dr. Stark doesn’t like the way he smells?
“Right,” he scoffed. “Excuse me if I find it hard to believe that nearly a year after you go off into the wild blue yonder, you decide you want to catch up on old times.”
They had talked about it, though. And Tony had made Steve want to talk about it more. He didn’t want to lose that.
“Steve …” Tony said, his voice gentle for the first time since Steve had walked in the door, and it felt like his heart lurched in reaction. “Shit.”
“Please,” Steve gasps, finally tearing his mouth away so he can talk, his lips swollen and bruised. “Your knot, please, Tony, please—”
The hug was different from the one last night, Steve holding him carefully, grip firm but not tight and without the desperation from before. There was almost a little too much control involved, as if Steve were deciding how much pressure he should use and where the best placement of his hands should be, and hey, it wasn’t like Tony could complain since he was doing the same thing—he was just less obvious about it. Still, it kind of amused him, because Steve was an A hugger, his arms high across Tony’s shoulders and back with plenty of space in between their lower torsos, and it was an awkward way to stand for long periods of time.
“Please, Steve?” he asks, and he’s not above busting out the puppy dog eyes, which he reserves for just these kinds of special occasions.
He’d known to expect it, but it still hurt, Tony somehow speeding up even more, shoving his growing knot into Steve’s already aching hole, just to yank it back out again. It should’ve made Steve tense up and struggle to not jerk away, but … .
It’s embarrassing, so, so embarrassing, but unfortunately, there are worse things for him to focus on than his nipples. One would think that with all the humiliation and with being cold and wet, the last thing Steve would be thinking of would be sex. And yet.
There was a long silence, and Steve could feel his anxiety starting to peak again by the time Tony spoke up, his voice rough.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered, and Tony tensed but didn’t move away. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he said over and over again, and Tony let it wash over him, keeping it for later.
Steve yanked him close, twisting his fingers into his hair and kissing him until he couldn't breathe properly, until all he could taste and touch and feel was Tony, and it was fitting that he'd taken over his senses, the same way he'd taken over everything else in Steve's life.  Had he really thought he'd be okay if Tony hadn't wanted to be with him?  Had he really thought that'd be possible?
He didn’t know what to feel about Stark at all most of the time. He was a combination of brashness and obnoxiousness and humor with an underlying layer of consideration that left Steve unbalanced, and if that weren’t enough, he’d taken Steve flying . . .
about sex as a result. The kind where he’s so desperate for cock that he doesn’t mind if the prep is minimal; where he cares more about getting a knot deep inside of him than being able to sit on a chair afterwards.
Tony’s smile got bigger. He lazily looked Steve up and down, and Steve felt painfully conscious of his neatly ironed-shirt and slacks, the dampness of his hair. He should’ve just gone to Tony as soon as he’d gotten off the elevator.
“You think I’m referring to an orgasm. You gave me one; I should give you one back. Yeah, I’m not very hung up on reciprocity,” he said, and Steve jerked when Tony let go of his hair to rub at his nipple through his shirt.
“Excuse me?” Steve croaks, because that is not something people generally say to describe him.  This time, he manages to pry his eyes open and keep them that way.  His first thought is that it is excruciatingly bright and he would give half his yearly salary for a pair of sunglasses.  His second thought is “goatee.”  His third thought is that there was an incredibly attractive man in bed with him.  An incredibly attractive,
It was different, however, to hear it from Stark himself; to realize that even if he were joking, Stark could envision the two of them pressed together for an entirely different reason.
He regretted telling Tony he wasn’t interested in men, wished that he could turn back time and snatch the words out of his mouth before they could pollute the air. It didn’t matter that it’d been the truth as he’d known it back then; it had led to so much heartbreak that his chest still ached when he thought about it, a phantom pain that made him want to seek Tony out, just to prove that he could, that he was allowed to, that if he reached out to touch, Tony would not only welcome it but would touch him back.
He hadn’t known what he was agreeing to when he took Stark up on his offer. And now it was too late to take it back.
Tony had been so apologetic and horrified, even as he stood there dripping coffee down his expensive fitted suit while Steve’s own clothes, a holey T-shirt that had seen better days and a pair of ratty shorts, had barely been splashed. Tony had ignored the slow destruction of his suit and used his single napkin to try and blot at a few spots on Steve’s arm. Steve had been immediately charmed.
Except … then brunch had happened, and Steve might not exactly have a lot of experience in this department, but he had to understand the significance of having Natasha and Clint over and being that open about their relationship.
“You okay, Steve?” Dr. Stark asks, lifting his hand so it’s no longer touching him but still close enough that Steve can feel its warmth. He lets out a breathy sound that he desperately hopes Dr. Stark will take as an affirmative, because he’s incapable of anything else.
And the expression in his eyes when Tony had demanded Steve look at him had held surprise, yes, but something that had resembled panic as well; panic and what had appeared to be a thread of longing.
When he finally pulled back, he was gratified to see Bruce blink and lick his lips, seemingly without realizing he was doing it.
Dr. Stark’s fingers are still inside of him, but they’re not moving. He’s undoubtedly staring in shock at the mess Steve’s made of himself. In all likelihood, Dr. Stark has never had an omega on his table like Steve. Most of Steve wants to curl up into a ball and hide in the blankets Dr. Stark gave him, even as a tiny part of him twinges with something like pride that Dr. Stark is looking at him, that Steve has proved just how much he wants him, even if he can’t do anything about it.
“That’s enough!” Fury barked, a day late and a dollar short, because there was a lost look in Steve’s eyes, just for a second, but it was there, and damn it.  Tony hadn’t even started it; he simply had a habit of ending things.  There was no reason for him to feel guilty.
Steve woke up full of energy, starving, and incredibly aroused. It was an odd combination, and not one that he’d experienced many times in his life. The first two conditions were easily explained away, and the third—
and it doesn’t seem like that’s going to change any time soon. Fuck, this wasn’t how he imagined asking Tony in after coffee. He’d wanted to be … not sexy exactly, but attractive. Appealing. At this point, however, he’d honestly settle for anything above “complete and utter mess.”
do as well--but still. I am very conflicted. So here, have the beginning of some Steve/Tony bdsm fic. :)
By the fifth time it happens, he’s gone out and gotten a few bottles of Everclear 190 proof. They’re expensive, and the taste is terrible, but if he chugs them, one right after another after another, then for a little while, it gets … not better, no, but maybe quieter? Definitely slower, all his thoughts pausing in their mad rush, and he gets to pretend for a few precious moments that he never saw the look on Tony’s face when he found out Steve had kept the truth from him.
The point of this wasn’t to orgasm anyway, even if Tony had given him permission. Steve didn’t even want an orgasm. He didn’t deserve one. Especially not if Tony was going without. And yes, it would hurt if he didn’t come, was already starting to ache dully since it was so late in the day and Tony had changed his minimum number of orgasms to two—had changed more than that, but Steve had never told him or thanked him, had never thought to say that Tony made his life better just by being in it—but that was okay. Steve welcomed the pain.
“I—yes,” he said, feeling ridiculously flustered, because it was one thing for Tony to know, another for him to call Steve out on it. He almost missed the tickling, because he’d been concentrating more on when the next attack would come than on the questions Tony had been asking, but now, there was nothing to distract him.
He was almost finished with his lunch when he heard, “Well, well, look who’s here,” and he looked up to smile at Natasha.
“You’re not my Dom anymore,” Steve said, and he hadn’t meant to be cruel, but from Tony’s expression, he had been anyway. It left him floundering.
Not that he wasn’t red, because he was, but at least he didn’t feel like he was having a heat stroke.
Dr. Reynolds made a noncommittal noise as he dried his hands, but his eyes were keen. He didn’t say much for a while other than asking Steve to take deep breaths or to move in a certain way or if something hurt, his hands cold as they palpated his skin, carefully shifting the gown when necessary.
It’s an audio glitch, I told you!  You know what, I’m just going to fly to the mansion ahead of you guys and work on the problem.  Catch you later,” Tony says, and he takes off, leaving Steve standing by himself, wondering how it’d all gone so wrong.
He’d all but declared himself to Fury. Tony’s jaw went slack. What with the whole overprotective Dom schtick and all the chest-pounding, he’d been asserting his claim left and right in a way that no one in a contract of-of
proof that he was alive and would continue to be until they found him again.  Assuming anyone ever did.
No, not once. Many times. Not giving Steve a safeword immediately, not looking past his obnoxious behavior and staying with him when he moved into the penthouse, not making it clear that Tony would never,
“Thanks,” Steve says, and he’s not actively trying to show off or anything, but he’d had the headshot, so he’d taken it. “So why go?”
But he’s in real danger of coming all the same, just from knowing it’s Dr. Stark’s finger inside of him, from getting this one thing he’s been so desperately wanting.
“Yesterday was more … intense than I’d intended. At least, I assume so. Maybe it wasn’t. Maybe you thought it was boring, hell, I don’t know,” Tony said, and Steve didn’t mean to duck his chin, but it happened before he was even aware of what he was doing. He heard Tony let out a long sigh. “Yeah, I thought so.”
“You were just trying to do the right thing,” he said, surprised by the apology, although maybe he shouldn’t have been. Stark wasn’t . . . Stark wasn’t anything like he’d expected. “It’s not your fault,” he said, and this time he believed it.
“Good morning, Steve,” Dr. Stark says, smiling and unfairly appealing with his lab coat all buttoned up and his tie framed by the collar. Steve wants to reply, but he can’t swallow past the lump in his throat, can’t do anything but twitch his lips and curl his fingers into the cloth of his robe.
Not that Morgan took to him right off the bat, and for the first several months, she was quiet whenever he visited, but she let him read to her or play with her as long as Pepper was nearby. It was only when she saw him sketch a picture of her favorite teddy bear that she looked at him like he might be someone interesting, and it was so uncannily like how Tony had looked at him in the beginning that Steve had to choke back an inappropriate rush of sadness.
It was hours later before he swung by the living room again, long past the time he would’ve expected Steve to be awake, which was why he was so surprised to find him sitting on the couch, reading.
He was aware that his decision coincidentally gave him a few more hours before he had to confront Tony, and while it wasn’t the main reason he didn’t call Tony, it did help.
“What the hell?” Tony yelps as Steve dies. He’d been sniping the zone, so by the time he gets to Steve’s ghost, the other player is gone, and Tony can’t even avenge him.
It would be different if he could at least know that Tony was enjoying it, but Tony had gone back to not saying anything, and from the clack of the keys, it seemed like the last thing on his mind was Steve.
So then he’d definitely be using the enemas, Steve decided, cheeks blazing, feeling more and more humiliated and overwhelmed as Tony laid down the rules.
Fury watched him for a second before letting out a sigh. “As I said already, I’m handling it. Reynolds won’t ever be in the same room as Steve again, let alone treat him, and the next time he comes in for an exam—”
“Then,” Steve said, taking a deep breath, and Tony found himself matching it, “I want you to punish me.”
He didn’t remember getting to his feet, didn’t remember crossing the room to his door, but he was careening into the hallway a second later, and it still wasn’t fast enough.
“Good. Now a few more things. First, I want you to wear a blindfold and use earplugs. Don’t worry,” Tony said, as if he knew how Steve’s heart rate had spiked up. “They won’t completely block out your sight and hearing, just reduce them enough to make sure I have your complete attention. Second, JARVIS is going to be monitoring you the entire time.”
things like that,” Tony groaned, gripping Steve’s cock tightly just to hear him hiss, his fingers tightening around Tony’s wrist almost painfully.  “Are you trying to make me to come before I get to see you naked?”
Tony—would ever look twice at him.  Inside, he’s still that scrawny kid from Brooklyn who never won a fight or stole a single kiss, and okay, yes, he’s jealous.  Because
Why would Tony do that? He’d already altered the suit to minimize any potential damage to Steve and giving him even this much control seemed—
"There's a pony?  Where?  We should call Animal Control.  Wait, they might try to take the Hulk, never mind, bad idea.  Over," Tony says, and Steve already knows he's not going to win this, doesn’t seem to win any of these bouts with Tony, but it never stops him from trying.
After being with Loki year after year after year, he’d learned also that they appreciated beauty, from the perfection of a snowflake to the stark monoliths carved from ice that made up their home; that they possessed a sense of humor that was at times gentle as well as cruel; that their touch could burn in such a way that made him ache for more.
“Of course!  I should’ve asked; I just got . . . distracted.”  Tony grabbed the retention plug, gaze sweeping over Steve’s profile one last time before he moved behind him.  “Okay, I’m taking out the nozzle now,” he warned before putting action to words.
But then he just … doesn’t, and when Steve finally comes less than a minute later, it doesn’t feel like an orgasm, the sensations too acute to be pleasurable, but he still yells in something like release, a dribble of come leaking from his cock.
“I don’t want to hear it!” Tony said fiercely, dropping his arms, and Steve’s mouth snapped close. “As a matter of fact, I don’t want to hear any of it. You couldn’t be fucked to say a word to me for three days, so I don’t want there to be so much as a peep out of your mouth unless it’s your safeword for the duration of your punishment. Do you understand me?”
He made a sound of protest when Tony drew all the way out, but Tony said, “Shh,” and pushed his mouth toward his testicles. “Suck,” he commanded, and Steve did, licking and sucking in between gasps of breath, burrowing his face in between Tony’s legs and taking as much as he could, his cheeks and chin wet.
“Mmm, like . . .” He tried to think of a way of explaining things without resulting in Pepper laughing at him. “Like yesterday. Steve didn’t hit me.”
Damn.  Off or not, he had a good smile, wide and adorable like a basket full of puppies, and it made Tony want to clutch at his chest just a little bit.
“C’mon, Steve, it’ll be fun!” Tony said, putting himself in Steve’s line of sight, as if not seeing it meant Steve didn’t know it was there.  “Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum!”
that he’d purchased from a used book store earlier that week to keep him company.  He’d always meant to read the classic, but for whatever reason, never had, and when he’d seen the battered copy on the shelf for fifty cents, he’d picked it up without hesitation.
It filled Tony with tenderness, and he decided to let Steve keep his silence. “Up on your knees then, but keep your head down and your hands where they are,” he said and wasn’t surprised by the presence of the wet spot he found on the sheets where Steve had been, although the size of it did give him a momentary pause as he stared at it in admiration. If it hadn’t been enough to show that he didn’t need to worry that he was pushing Steve too hard, Steve’s cock, hanging full underneath him, would’ve done it.
He’s already humiliated himself so many times in front of Tony, and Tony had still wanted to go out with him, but there’s the very real possibility that if Steve tells him what’s wrong, it’ll be the last straw. That Tony will decide Steve’s some kind of over-sexed maniac that needs counseling to get over his addiction, maybe even medical intervention and treatment—
But Tony had kept things platonic between them for a week without showing any signs of taking it further, and while Steve realized a week was no time at all, would Tony have waited that long with anyone else? Steve had been around long enough to know that in this day and age, if two people were living together for a week, a lot more would’ve happened by now than just hugs and two kisses. So why were they taking things so slowly?
“Now, if you were ever interested in exploring just how pleasurable pain can be, I’d be more than happy to help,” Tony said, his thumbs stroking Steve’s knuckles, “but for discipline, for
“How do you know?” he asked, eyeing the tunnel that looked exactly like the one they were currently traveling down.
Although . . . he wasn’t sleeping, was he? And it really was going to be a long flight; and he already knew he’d inevitably spend much of it thinking about Tony, unable to do anything except sit there and wait; and yes, he’d already taken care of himself in the shower after he’d gotten back, but that had been a while ago, and it’d been quick and perfunctory at best.
There’d been a moment when he’d been incredibly tempted to climb into bed with him, but he’d simply wrapped Tony up in his comforter before heading to his own room instead. One thing being with Tony had taught him was the importance of receiving permission; Tony had always been so careful to ask before he ever did anything to Steve, and he didn’t want to return the favor by assuming Tony would say yes.
“Mm,” he grunts in lieu of speaking because he’s sure his voice would break, and putting together a chain of words seems excessively daunting. Dr. Stark is still straining to get deeper, his fingers veritably mapping the contours of Steve’s prostate as he goes, and Steve tries to do what he asked, but his limbs don’t want to cooperate. They feel jittery and weak, and it’s a miracle he hasn’t fallen off the table with the way his pelvis keeps jerking in response to something Dr. Stark does.
He kept to the road for a long time, stopping wherever looked promising. He drove through national parks and visited out-of-the-way museums, ate in diners that ranged from quaint to just plain disgusting and tried a piece of blueberry pie that he would’ve cried over in different days, and it didn’t get better.
“Don’t look!” Steve gasps, bringing his knees up and clenching his thighs together automatically in some sort of pointless attempt at modesty, as if Dr. Stark’s somehow going to miss his reaction in a few minutes when his head is between Steve’s legs and his fingers and tongue are inside his—
“If you need to pee during the day, you can whine and scratch at the door, and I’ll take you outside. Yes, that means you’ll have to take care of business in the bushes, and I’ll expect you to do it by lifting a leg and being as careful with your aim as you can.”
Yes, his back hurt like fuck, and his knees were going numb, but he was used to forcing himself to function through all kinds of discomfort, and he had every intention of continuing to ignore it until …
“We’re going to talk about this later,” Bruce said, implacable, and Clark nodded weakly. “In the meantime, however, we’re going to take this somewhere a little less public and closer to the governor's office. I’ll explain on the way,” he said, taking Clark’s hand and leading him toward the side of the room, his thumb skimming against Clark’s skin in a tentative caress.
“Where is he anyway?” Happy said, looking around as if he was expecting Steve to pop out from behind DUM-E.  “Oh crap, don’t tell me we’ve been talking about Captain America while he’s been sleeping on your dinky cot—”
“Alright.” Steve pushed back the covers and stood up, ignoring the curtain of darkness that fell over his eyes. He’d been picking at his food recently, but he’d have to make sure to eat properly at breakfast. What good was he to Tony if he had trouble with something as minor as this?
For the prompts “Writing format: documents” (cap_ironman bingo – last one didn’t count) and “in the future” (avengers_kink).  Just one more prompt to go.  Wow.
the news reels and clips of Captain America, had watched the man lift a motorcycle with one arm, but it was one thing to admire a guy’s ability to bench press a truck, totally another to have him block a strike and make
“Well, I was always planning to make orgasms a reward for doing well,” Tony said, confusing Steve for a second because why would he—
“Unfortunately, as I’ve already explained to you, Captain, military regulations require that Subs who have seen combat or experienced traumatic situations
tired earlier. But then, he’d been so focused on Tony that he hadn’t really paid attention to where Tony had taken him.
She rolled her eyes. “If you’re not sick, and you’re not working on anything in particular,” she said, and he cursed the fact that he’d admitted as much to her already, “then what’s running you ragged?” Her tone made it clear that she already knew the answer.
It takes a little bit of experimentation to get situated. Tony wishes Angels could breathe underwater, because then at least, he’d be able to swim normally, but he has to turn onto his back in order to make sure the Angel doesn’t drown. It’s a pain, especially since the wings are a lot broader across the shoulders than Tony had expected, and they make it impossible to lay the Angel on his back. He ends up having to use one tentacle to wrap around the bottoms of the wings to keep them together with the Angel facedown on his chest, Tony’s arms loosely wrapped around him.
Steve couldn’t make himself believe it, though. And he didn’t know what to think about it, that Stark would do something like that for him, because no matter how often he tried to justify Stark’s actions with the Avengers’ Initiative, it didn’t make sense that Stark would put his life on hold.
“Nick showed me Project Insight, and he said that you’d upgraded the helicarriers. He didn’t say you knew about the project itself, but the way he mentioned it, I just assumed …” He trailed off, looking down, ashamed but unwilling to tell Tony anything but the absolute truth. He should know the complete list of Steve’s sins.
just be trying to distract Tony with agreeableness while he came up with some other, diabolical scheme that was just going to end in tears. It wasn’t like Tony would be able to tell one way or the other until it was too late, however, so he finally just said, “Well . . . alright then,” all the wind knocked out of his sails.
