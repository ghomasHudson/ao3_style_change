“They won’t come,” Tony murmurs. “I’m unimportant and they’ve got what they need from you.”
Tony grins sharply and without humour. In the darkness, his eyes and his teeth shine brightly and for a disorienting second it’s all that Steve can see, as if he’s in conversation with the Cheshire Cat, or a shark, and whichever it is it’s about to bite Steve’s head off.
Thor, from a whole alien realm where people wear amour and talk like Shakespeare, seems to have a better handle on Tony’s sense of humour than Steve’s managed yet. He laughs and pats Tony on the shoulder as he leaps to his feet, and he grabs the bag of popcorn, exclaiming, “For Jane!”
Tony grins. “It’s not my fault, they followed me home.”
“I – had a girl – woman -
well with the populace.”
The first touch to the miniature Iron Man helmet turns it red; the second, bright white, and then the – the cell phone? Steve supposes – in Tony’s hand starts to beep, the picture of his shield flashing red on it.
“Fastforward 15%,” Tony mutters, leaning back to watch the workshop zip by while Butterfingers move into position at the far end. The camera swings around to face Steve and the other Tony, the two of them moving back and forth in the middle of the workshop, mouths moving too fast to understand.
“Paper?” Tony says. “Really?”
“Yes,” she says. “But it’s Clint knife.”
“Could be.”
“My friend,” Thor says, “I fear you may need larger seating arrangements.”
Tony snorts and, down the phone line, Steve too begins to chuckle.
As people start to move forward, glass crunching underfoot and chairs scraping as they’re moved aside, Steve leans in closer to Barton.
“Only the swords of my slain enemies, to bring them the shame of an improper burial,” Thor says. He catches the bottle of vodka Tony tosses him with barely the blink of an eye. “But now Asgard is a realm of peace and it is
He flexes his fingers. His wrist is tingling.
“Sorry, I, uh, what was it? I save my glories of knowledge for after breakfast.” Tony crams half a doughnut into his mouth and adds, thickly, “And I don’t have breakfast before eleven am.”
“Well, would you look at that?” the dream man says, and then he looks down at Steve and begins to laugh, until Steve, feverish and offended, begins to cry.
“’m sorry. ‘m tryin’.” Tony sighs. His fingers curl around the microphone again. “Sorry, Pep.”
“You’re an eternal disappointment, Brucie,” Tony says, patting Bruce on the side of the face. “Be good, eat your vegetables, if the other boys say mean things step on them.”
He stares down at his hands. “Some people went dancing. Not like -
Tony’s hand is very, very warm on Steve’s arm.
“Then don’t. Nothing changes. We just have to keep doing what we always do, okay?
He’s already been in the twenty-first century long enough that he’s picked up on the cultural echoes of the eighties without studying it, without even really meaning to. The little he’s seen already feels like enough: everything seems to become so artificial, so materialistic and money-hungry. So driven in a way that exhausts Steve just thinking about it. He’s met many driven people in his two lifetimes, but mostly – even now – it’s been the drive for
Barton straightens up sharply, snapping to attention. “Sir, yessir. Moonlighting, sir.”
“You – right. Well, they’re great. Great prototypes. I’m sure they’ll be amazing when they’re done.”
Romanoff slips out the door first, Steve close behind her. There’s a moment of silence, as if everyone is holding their breath while they wait for the sounds of violence, but nothing comes. Clint takes up his post by the doors, one side propped open just enough that he can look down the corridor. He too has his gun drawn and ready. Tony lets out his breath. He claps his hands together.
? Are you okay?”
“A few lights blew out.”
“You’re in a flying metal suit.”
“Spare rooms,” Tony says, still staring up at him, still holding the empty glass.
The wires crawl up and down his body, attached to sensors, branching out from the arc reactor at the centre of it all. He can feel them tingle against his skin in time with his magnetic pulse. Metal veins for a metal heart.
“Okay,” Steve says warily.
It’s a serious gap in the greeting card market.”
“The suit works,” the other adds. “Quit it, Dummy, I’ve got this one. You’ll see.”
Steve wakes suddenly and for a moment he doesn’t know why. The sun is bright against his eyelids; he keeps them closed, keeps breathing slowly and holding still while his ears do the work, the sound of familiar voices filtering through.
All your superhot friends are on your cell and they saw my freaking bedhead!”
“That was a damn good tiger.”
Clint jogs over and nudges it with the end of his bow.
“You’re getting ice cream on your suit,” he says.
“Of course, sir.”
Romanoff nods. She glances at Barton, who nods as well. With a strained smile at them both, Hill flips open the top folder and pulls out a stack of documents.
Steve coughs. He clasps his hands behind his back. “I’ll try. Pepper. “
“I will get away with this. You won’t.” Steve cracks his knuckles. “Now, leave.”
Steve turns and walks numbly back to the monitors. The screens come back to life in a wave as he watches them, starting in the top left corner and then spreading out, the images flickering back and forth until they settle on a channel; until finally, all of the screens are lit and humming. It’s Central Park, Steve realises, from dozens of different angles. He scans them all, searching for whatever it is the computer is trying to show him, but there’s nothing.
“It didn’t.” He touches her hand. “Come on, it takes more than that to stop me. I survived an alien invasion. Loki threw me through a window. And then there’s the palladium poisoning, and Hammer, and
with towels this big? – and gathers up his pile of damp, cold clothes. And hesitates.
“Sure. Look, for a beginner, this is probably the easiest...” Tony beckons and Steve begins to step forward before he realises the hologram has moved too, sailing in the direction of Tony’s gesture and disappearing as smoothly as if it just stepped off camera. A new set of blueprints slide into place.
“This looks like the arc reactor,” Obie says, checking the other’s pulse. “Miniaturised. I never saw Howard come up with anything like this.”
Sure enough, up in that same, familiar guest room with the terrific view, there are a few spare sets of clothes in Steve’s size. He carefully unbuttons his shirt and leaves it draped over the back of the desk chair, and he pulls a soft, grey sweatshirt on over his undershirt. Then he just sits down on the edge of the bed and stares out the windows. Tony sure knew what he was doing when he put him in a room with a view like this.
“So,” Yinsen says. “You are a man who has everything and nothing but time.”
“Steve
Clint rubs his hands together with glee. “I wanna see how much we have to spend for Stark to actually notice – or not,” he adds, lowering his hands and straightening up as he takes in Steve and Bruce’s serious expressions. His face shifts into the man who shot an arrow at a demigod, rather than the man who wants to spend large amounts of a billionaire’s money on what – Steve suspects – would be very small portions of food.
“You don’t...”
“It’s
“Right, mail can be intercepted.”
“Jesus,” he groans, flopping back onto his pillow. He kicks the sheets off the bed and onto the floor. Belatedly, he rolls over to check Pepper is already up and gone, which she is.
“Hey,” Clint says, “Hulk should balance it on his head, see if Cap can knock it off with his shield-”
“I’m... trying out some new things.”
Tony grins across at him and, continuing his stroll along the table, pats Thor on the shoulder.
gave me away and that’s it. That’s it, Steve. Game over.”
“Pragmatic, I like it.”
He pulls file y-cam-001 up and drags it to the adjacent screen.
She stares up at him with her face pale and her eyes wide and anxious, gaze darting back and forth between him and the glimpses of Steve organising the crowd in the background.
Down on the street below, tourists are starting to look up at the disturbance, pointing and raising their cameras. Steve smiles at them, waving awkwardly.
“You’re okay? And Barton?”
“Aye, let us be merry!” Thor proclaims around his pastry. “And then tomorrow we shall rise early from our beds and seek the glories of knowledge with my dear Jane and her comrades!”
He holds out his hand, opening and closing his fingers impatiently while Clint jogs back with the communicator. Clint throws it at him, but Tony catches it. He runs his fingers over the crack.
When Tony is four, Howard Stark looks dead into the centre of a camera lens.
“Captain,” Stark says. “
“And it all really-”
He gives it one last sniff and he pulls a face, shakes his head, nose crinkling in irritation at whatever’s eluding him. Ducking his head down, he licks the side of the gun.
“I can understand that,” Steve says slowly. “Needing a reason to still be here. For it to be worth it.”
“Um... Mr Jarvis?”
“Nat’s fine. We’re both fine. Physically, anyway,” Clint adds, darkly.
“No,” Steve breathes. “What
in the eye,” Barton mutters.
“It worked, then?” Steve says when Tony pauses for breath.
“Really? You sure? ‘Cause we’re gonna get invited to dinner at the White House sooner or later and I know a place that does a great chilli and chocolate.”
wasn’t invited to the alien invasion party either. Consultation only. By pure coincidence the invasion came via my rooftop garden.”
No shoes here, you waste of circuitry, so go away before I put you on the scrapheap – okay, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that, you’re great. Greatly annoying. Don’t know why I thought I needed cleaner shoes, anyway.”
Hands full, Steve jerks his chin towards Iron Man, flying low and visible and better than any street sign.
Cap’s costume?”
“We helped save the world. I think that counts.”
He wipes a hand through the condensation, leaving a thick, curving stripe of mirror behind, his eyes and half his face staring out at him through it. With his thumb, Steve adds more lines – which become legs, a tail, pricked up ears – until he’s drawn a cat in the mirror, sprawled as if it’s basking in front of the fire. There’s a secretive look in its eyes, already melting away.
Clint makes a noise of profound disgust. He stalks away, drawing an arrow from his quiver as he goes and firing it straight into the target without a hitch in his step. And then, and again, a whole row of bull’s-eyes forming. The Hulk lumbers after him and swats at the arrows in the air, until Clint turns and starts firing them for him to catch – and to crush.
Still looking at the napkin, Tony says, “You know, the one time in my life I really was in the right place at the right time was because it was the time and place my oldest friend had arranged for terrorists to kill me.”
He lifts a metal box out of the breadbox and slides it across the work surface towards Steve. It hits up against his fingers, so he lifts his hands and tugs it in front of him. There doesn’t seem to be any kind of lock or catch, just a smooth, black panel on the top of the box. Tony leans against the cabinets and watches him study it, hip cocked, ankles crossed.
Bruce begins to laugh softly, helplessly, shaking his head.  “I still can’t believe this is all happening. Consulting with aliens about parallel dimensions. The world’s gone crazy.”
He watches her go until she’s disappeared up a sweeping staircase, and then he kneels down and sets about removing his boots. It’s a tough job, with cold fingers and wet knots and leather sticking to denim. Once he’s pulled one off, he looks up to meet Agent Romanoff’s watchful gaze.
Natasha puts her cereal bowl down and folds her arms on the worktop, looking at Steve. “Chile?”
“How’s the suit in next Thursday?” he calls from the driver’s seat.
There’s a note of bitterness in his voice, Steve notices. There often is, with this Tony. Steve shrugs, rolling his shoulders – he’s practically back to normal now; no lasting side effects from the ice – and they lapse into silence for the remainder of the elevator ride. At the top, Steve steps out into the gallery ready to breathe a sigh of relief at the sight and feel of something familiar, but the place is empty and too, too silent. The air hangs heavy with dust and what few pictures and artefacts there are out on display have been covered by dust sheets. It feels dead.
“All I’m saying is, I’ve never seen your arc reactor punch a, a – giant snake from space in the head and win.”
“I’m working on it.”
from?”
“What’s the schedule on the reconstruction?”
“They come in boxes,” Tony says. “Good with milk, better dry. Traditionally eaten with spoons. I mean, what, what do you want from me here? A research proposal?”
“Well, Tony, you never call, you never write, you sure as hell never invited me to fight aliens with you.”
“Experiencing technical difficulties,” Tony grits out. He’s cradling his hand awkwardly to his chest, holding his whole arm stiffly. There’s no Iron Man gauntlet or contraption or device; only Tony’s bare hand from which he somehow shot a repulsor blast.
“Definitely not,” Steve says.
“That kind of thing’s happened before.”
"Interesting how?"
“Yes sir.”
Tony finishes his explanation; meets Steve’s eyes as if he’s fearing the worst.
Note/Edit: this chapter has been edited as of June 23, 2019. It's a really minor change, just fixing up something I forgot, but just thought to let y'all know.
The first strains of piano drifts out of the TV speakers and Natasha whirls around with glee.
old, dear God-”
It’s still dark outside; Steve can see the beginning vestiges of light against the horizon through the living room windows.
Thanks to all of you guys for being so patient with me while I try to navigate writing lol. You guys are great. Stay awesome! :)
Steve gets closer to Pepper, Morgan, Happy and Rhodey inevitably, because you can’t live through those terrible days together, leaning on each other, healing slowly, without feeling a kinship. He knows them now, truly knows them like he hadn’t before, and tries to help out where he can, tries to heal.
Steve jumps when a scanner suddenly activates, sweeping blue light across him before he can react.
“Pepper?” He asks hesitantly when he remains rooted to the spot and she leans forward to tug on his arm. She looks at him with a sad smile and tilts her chin towards the doorway. The meaning is clear, so Steve obediently follows them inside.
He opens the door to his room, his still numb hands barely registering the texture, and walks calmly down the hall, not expecting it when he's grabbed from behind and whirled around to face the man, who's now looking irate. His hands on his arm are warm, warmer than anything he's felt for a long time, and Steve jolts as his skin tingles with it, comes alive underneath the man's touch.
. I was just worried and confused about why you left because from only my point of view, nothing unusual had happened, and so my mind just went there, but I wasn’t trying to - Pepper didn’t mean anything bad either by the way, she kinda just understood what I meant and so I didn’t actually say all of what I was thinking out loud, I mean, you only heard a bit of what I said to Pepper and you just -”
In the quinjet ride back, Steve watches from his seat as Peter leans a bit on Wanda, tired and worn out, with her arm around his shoulder, Wanda stroking his hair with a sisterly frown on her face. Peter’s young face looks haggard and exhausted and Steve finds that he’s tense and angry, at himself mostly, as he watches them and he reviews the battle in his head, thinks about what they could have done differently.
When Tara posts the video she had recorded of Tony a week later, it goes viral.
Tony laughs as Morgan sticks out her tongue, running the rest of the way to Peter.
“Good to know, Mr. Stark.”
And...there’s of course always the possibility that it wasn't Steve at all, that it was a glitch, a system error, and he shifts uncomfortably as he thinks about it. The very idea of something going wrong with Tony fills him with outright...fear. Because none of them really know how to help him, not even Bruce because he’s not technically an engineer, genius as he is, and yeah Shuri, but what if she doesn’t arrive in time or isn’t available, just…
“SHHHH.” Everyone replies.
“It was a done deal afterwards though. When you seemed to unthaw, and I saw more of who you were before. I fell so fast it was fucking ridiculous.”
So he trains with Peter, Harley and Wanda, and anyone else who wishes for a few pointers here and there, and he goes for runs in the morning with Sam, who also frowns at him worriedly, and he checks in on Bruce to make sure he eats food when he’s working in the lab.
Steve brushes the dust off his hand, and squints at the plans because that can’t be right can it? He’s almost entirely sure he’s reading it wrong, that looks like a-
He promises himself that he’s going to ask later, since Tony’s wearing that familiar pinched expression that says he would not respond well to inquiries at the moment, and goes back to helping around, tries to put the incident out of his mind for now.
"Papa, I'm countant!" Morgan yells right on cue, Elle bursting into giggles instead of saying anything. Tony sighs.
why would he make an AI that looks so much like him, it just hurts all the more, the fact that Steve is reminded of Tony in all his forms, alive, happy, snarking at him, angry, righteous, heartbroken, but
The scene starts with Tony sitting in front of the mike wearing a gigantic pair of headphones. He’s shuffling through sheet music, apparently not noticing the camera is on.
watch-”
I don't know what I was even-" and Steve is choking, vision blurring in front of him, and he squeezes his eyes shut desperately to find words, to explain, apologize.
It changes though one day, when Steve finds Tony asleep beside the dias after he sends the last of his audiences away. No way around it, Steve picks Tony up, gasping as warmth floods his arms and chest from where he’s cradling Tony’s figure. It’s startling and a bit painful after the numbness, so Steve darts quickly down the halls, hurriedly depositing Tony on the pile of blankets near the fire and throwing the covers over him before Tony can freeze more.
allowed to die, not like this, not when I haven’t even told you to your face that I love you yet, you
“Theoretically? Um. Two seconds?”
It takes all his willpower not to walk forward, to stay here in 2012, before everything had gone to shit, and
to search up every cultural reference in this century? Weak.”
Eventually everyone had quieted down, and Pepper had sighed, small and a bit broken. “What I wouldn’t give for them to be here with us.” and Happy put his arm around her shoulders sadly.
“That son of a bitch.” he breathes and she raises an eyebrow at him. “That
This chapter is a little bit longer than the last because I had to stop it at a point that makes sense lol. Chapter had finally somewhat lived up to the Mature rating for some not really PG-13 thoughts ;)
Steve had seen first hand - battered veterans during the war, flinching at noises that echo of gunshots, the way an errant tool around the house could make Pepper break down crying even months after the final battle. How sometimes all it took was a vague reminder - even now - a certain shade of red that reminds him abruptly of Natasha's fiery hair, the battered flip phone that Steve keeps tucked away in a box so he won't have to look at it. It doesn't take much to be the straw that breaks a back.
“Nanites again,” Tony supplies. “They hold the cave up, they hold my innards in. One day I’ll train them to cook and clean and then I’ll be sitting pretty.”
Feeling suddenly foolish, Steve scrubs the cat away. He ties the towel around his waist, so big it’s practically a ball gown even on him – what does Tony
He says it so quietly that Tony doesn’t know if he’s meant to have heard it or not, but he looks around anyway.
“No, no buts. Eat your ice cream, my god, you’re going to miss another seventy years if you keep going at this rate.”
“Stay,” Tony whispers when the feeling comes back into his fingers.
“So.” Steve clears his throat. “Pepper’s on vacation?”
us where we are.”
have got all the time in the world.”
When Steve turns around, Tony is already moving away again, back towards the bar to pour himself another drink.
“Good to see you too, buddy,” Steve says, massaging the feeling back into his fingers. “What tradition? Micro-waving?”
, Tony finds himself thinking,
“And anchovies. Have you tried anchovies yet?”
Steve hesitates.
“What?”
It’s the sound of voices that draws him out of his uneasy sleep, jumbled and disoriented. He’s in the ice. He’s in the manor. He’s in the New Avengers’ hide out in the middle of the Civil War. He’s in a cold, dark cave in an alternate universe. Steve rubs his eyes, sitting up. It’s night time, probably, as the lights are out and twenty feet away the wall of surveillance monitors has cast an eerie glow on Tony’s face.
“But,” Steve mutters, “you’re not going to.”
Tony pauses, and they both turn to watch the line of people handing back their grabbed-up dollars. Not everyone will give it back, Steve knows, and maybe not even most will, but maybe it’ll be enough to make a difference.
The basement workshop is absolutely pitch black and silent, but as they step inside the first set of lights click on and hum over their heads, triggering the next set and then the next in a domino effect all the way down to the far side. With the Hulk inside, the workshop had seemed merely big; without, the place is cavernous.
Steve smiles sideways at him. For a moment Tony’s damn sure he’s going to say something like ‘you can do it’ or ‘I believe in you’, to which Tony would respond with something sarcastic, but Steve’s jaw shifts and he swallows and his mouth stays closed, the smile fading until he’s just looking at Tony out of the corner of his eye.
Steve frowns across at Tony – Tony, who is leaning back with his elbows on the handrail, his ankles crossed, his shades on the end of his nose, holding his ice cream cone up high to lick melted ice cream from the juncture between finger and thumb. He’s so casual you could almost forget he’s wearing a red and gold robot suit.
“Sure. It’d be swell, thank you.”
“Screw you all,” Tony declares.
Tony kicks the door shut behind him. Shoving his hands into his pockets, ruining the line of his $5000 dollar suit, he follows Steve down the corridor, taking 1.2 steps for each one of Steve’s. Steve glances sideways at him four times, but doesn’t say a word. Tony pretends he isn’t counting.
“This is New York,” Steve says, before he can stop himself, and adds, ruefully, “Reference, right?”
She trails off and lifts her hand away. They look at each other in silence in the dark. The arc reactor light shines in her eyes.
“I’ve got three PhDs, you know,” Tony says, emerging from the bar at last. He’s got a bottle of vodka in one hand and the box of doughnuts in the other. “I don’t like to brag-”
He hums Memphis Minnie during the ride up in the elevator and something catchy he heard on the wireless as the doors slide open and he steps out into the familiar sight of the living room. The place seems empty at first glance, but when Steve walks further inside he spots Ms Potts sitting in the corner, at a desk covered in paperwork. She looks tired, and as she lifts her head to look at him without enthusiasm, Steve feels the spring fall out of his step.
“Atta boy,” Tony says. “The code’s practically the same. Navigation, basic decision making, programming it to seek out whole humans instead of distinguishing between body parts was practically a downgrade. 360 degree cameras, smoke bombs in the rim – teaching it to recognise threats was a fun weekend, let me tell you, you really missed out on that one.”
He spreads his palm over the miniature reactor. He can cover it with his whole hand. His fingers curl under the rim, digging in.
“Reed and Sue were arrested, four, five years ago. Ben’s gone so far underground he’s probably dug all the way to China by now. I hear Johnny’s fine, though.”
Tony grins at Steve, wide enough and bright enough that Steve wouldn’t be surprised to find a picture of him licking a jet in his mail tomorrow. Steve sighs, propping his elbows up on the railing, and he smiles out at the Hudson. It’s only when mint choc chip drips onto his fingers that he remembers to lick his own cone.
“Great. Give me your hand. Other hand, shield hand. That’s it.” He tugs Steve closer, the chair’s castor wheels rolling obligingly, until Steve’s hand is practically in his lap. He spreads the tape measure from the top of his wrist to the tip of his index fingers, then whistles as he notes down the measurement. “Big hands. You know what they say about
He tugs his communicator out of his pocket, activates it with his thumb and then, as the pictograms light up across the screen, swipes his palm across it. The pictures disappear, leaving the screen blank except for the Iron Man helmet in the corner.
“It looks like a gun built by an idiot,” he says. “An idiot who’d never seen a gun before and was going off descriptions given by a different,
impressive in the future. You got any friends from the nineteenth century? Cavemen, any cavemen? I could probably convince cavemen I’m a god...”
Thirty years later, Howard thinks of it.
“Hands free for the terrible twins,” Tony declares. At Steve’s quizzical look, he makes a complex gesture and the exploded parts pull back together into the shape of something a bit like Steve’s ear piece, but a lot more complicated. “For Bruce and his roomie. Putting things in people’s ears, easy. Getting things to stay in while people turn into angry green giants – well, also easy. For me. I’m a genius. But slightly
“Yeah.” Steve smiles under Tony’s fingers. “But I got Mr Berenbaum’s wallet back.”
The Hulk growls, “
She pauses and frowns. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve can see Tony, tense, watching her as closely as he is.
Tony nods, looking back down at his cell, which has stopped ringing. “Let me just...”
For a while, the baby, the hospital and Maria’s sickness consume everything, but when Howard comes back to himself, he’s holding his son in his arms. His greatest creation. Howard looks down into Anthony Edward’s eyes and knows with absolute certainty that he has seen these eyes before.
Tony thrusts it at Steve and lets go. Steve catches it automatically. He turns it over and over in his hands, grinning as he presses his thumb to the corner and watches the blank screen come to life again.
“Remember, try to be careful,” she murmurs, smoothing the collar down and moving on to straighten his tie. “Don’t do anything reckless or... get in arguments with reporters, or give anyone any kind of ammunition against the business or your team, or-”
“This doesn’t mean you’re on the team, Stark. Consulting only.”
“That...” Tony trails off, staring, then snaps back into motion to nudge Steve in the ribs. “Pay attention now, Cap, I’m teaching you a vital twenty-first century phrase here – that shit ain’t right.”
Steve is staring at him with something in his eyes that Tony can’t read. At Tony’s question, he shakes his head and looks away.
“I know you’re watching, you bastard,” he says, simply.
“Damn,” he says. He lets his hand drop. “Still, at least now we know what we’ve got to look forward to. If you can really make the arc reactor viable, Tony, there’ll be no stopping the company.”
Steve clenches his fists and draws in a breath, but whatever he’s going to say is drowned out by that first great roll of thunder, that incoming storm.
Rhodey rolls his eyes.
Steve sighs. Ignoring all the cameras that turn to flash in his direction the second he moves, he jumps down onto the Hulk’s shoulder and from there springs to the ground. Someone cheers, but Steve straightens up and rests his hands on his hips, and he frowns. At the on-lookers, and the Hulk and Clint, and at the men cowering at Clint’s feet.
,” Tony snaps. Then he scrubs a hand across his face and his voice softens. “I was. For, I don’t know, five years, I was Iron Man. But I was drinking too much and trying to lead the Avengers at the same time and I
“I got in a fist fight with a spy up here,” Clint says, around a mouthful of his own ice cream sandwich. He smiles fondly, ice cream in the cracks between his teeth, and points into the nearby bushes. “Right there. About ten years ago, when the place was a dump. Bit his ear.”
Tony looks between them, then looks down at his Avengers communicator. Nothing happens when he thumbs the corner. Cursing, he tugs his cell out of his pocket and stares down at that too; it’s dark and unresponsive, a useless little rectangle of plastic.
“You’re playing in the big league now. Don’t screw it up.” Fury turns and strides away down the corridor, long coat flapping out behind him, pausing mid-step to throw back over his shoulder, “I scratch your back, you scratch mine.”
Tony lets out a breath, dragging his hands down his face.
Steve feels – doesn’t hear; even without these ear defenders he wouldn’t be able to hear it over the great rushing movement – Tony tense up and suck in a sharp breath, stepping back until his shoulders hit Steve’s chest and he has to stop, gun still held out high in front of him, shining in the light still shooting out of it.
Leaning over Tony’s shoulder, Bruce lifts his safety goggles up to rest on his hair and he unfolds his glasses from his shirt pocket, slipping them on to peer at his data. He keeps pens in his shirt pocket, too. He has a
. This is a voyage into the unknown, here. We’re not ready to reminisce about the good old days yet.”
Steve doesn’t know what that is, but he smiles. He swipes his finger across a row – a geometric shape he knows from Black Widow’s belt buckle; a stylised ‘A’ he doesn’t recognise – and watches the pictograms turn red. A second touch turns them silver and at once every communicator in the box, and the one in Tony’s hand, starts to beep and vibrate furiously, the box shaking with the force of it.
them showing off. Kinda. JARVIS, record this conversation. Not for my jerk-off material,” he adds to the room at large. “I’m calling the others. We might need a record of it for later.”
“You ever dream, JARVIS?” he says.
“Agent Carter,” Steve says, expression softening. “Peggy. But you know I didn’t meet her until after you were… gone. I loved her one hell of a lot. If I’d had a chance to go on that date with her…”
“What?”  Tony says. “That’s
He heads back to Steve and shrugs, waving a hand at the view.
“No, it doesn’t, but thank you for pretending. And call me Pepper,” she adds. “I mean it. Ms Potts sounds like someone’s maiden aunt, and god knows I’m neither of those things.”
There’s a moment of silence, measured in the throb of Steve’s bruises, in time with Steve’s heart.
“You’re right, I’m sorry, I’ll make JARVIS scan the cocktails next time.”
is the one with his back to a wall, deciding whether to run or fight.
Tony raises an eyebrow at him. “Obviously. No more stupid questions, pay attention – this bit’s important. New feature.”
Steve stands. “You too, ma’am.”
“You’re a computer?”
“But you’re okay?” Ms Potts says.
He hears her laugh and say, “You, too.”
“I’m waiting for my orders.”
- he pushes forwards for a better view.
“JARVIS, add it to the agenda. Item one: couch,” Tony says.
Romanoff presses her lips together, shaking her head again slowly.
“Goodbye,” he says, only a little unsteadily. “That was a – goodbye, then, I guess.”
“What?” Tony snaps.
“How do you mean?”
“I’m the genius whose tower you’re living in,” Tony says. “And I’ve got a supercomputer that’s trained to kill, so watch yourself.”
He went to see a Colonel Pete Jeffries last week, who had been barely eighteen when Steve knew him. Now Pete’s in his eighties and deaf in one ear, with shrapnel in his knee; and Steve’s older than him, technically. He’d told Steve that he’d barely touched a computer in his life. Didn’t understand how his TV worked. Had a grandson, a good kid, who set it all up for him and showed him twice a week how to change the channels. It never stuck. It’s perfectly possible, he’d told Steve, to get by in 2012 without really understanding it and to still be happy. You don’t need to know everything.
“That’s a new one,” Steve says.
“Our floor was hit hardest,” he says. “Everywhere else just... experienced some technical difficulties.”
“Some might call that insufficient data, sir.”
Tony whistles between his teeth as soon as he’s outside. He dumps the box of doughnuts on the low wall and props his elbows on either side of it, hands loosely clasped over the thousand foot drop, and he shakes his head.
“Okay,” Steve breathes. “Okay.”
- but he can’t find himself beneath his fingers. He can’t find his fingers.
“Now would be a
Steve does, running his hand down Tony’s forearm. There are no discernible edges, or changes in texture, or
“D’you think the magnetism makes it travel with me?” he asks.
“Okay,” Steve says, with a nod and a sigh. He lowers himself back down onto the couch.
Barton watches her departing back, then glances at Tony. He nods towards the crack in the doors, nudging it open a little further with his boot, and through the gap they watch a group of SHIELD agents and paramedics pass by with an innocuous-looking man out cold on a gurney. He’s young and weedy. He looks like the sort of unassuming guy who works in tech support and spends his life instructing little old ladies to turn it off and then on again.
“Guess so,” Steve says, glancing sideways at him. He props his chin on his hand and smiles, first at Tony, and then out at the sky through the window. Tony’s driving fast and the neighbourhoods are rushing past, but there’s the sky, as blue as it has ever been, unmoving.
Steve’s lips flicker with the brief hint of a smile. He claps Tony on the shoulder – his fingers are very warm – and then he turns to Bruce.
Tony says something too soft for Steve to make out, but Pepper responds to it with a noise of pure frustration. He can picture her hands thrown up into the air at the sound of it.
“Great. Okay, increasing altitude. Let’s see what this baby can do.”
“Tony?”
The click of a case opening.
He darts to the windows that line the side of the room and peers down at the street below, craning his neck back and forth to take in as much of the view as possible. Everything is normal: traffic moving at a crawl but not immobile; street lights flashing; everyone talking on their cell phones and lights on in the windows across the street.
“It’s okay. Dad solved -
Tony grins at her, pulling his communicator out of his pocket. “Something else. Just – give me – a second.”
vacation,” Clint insists. “Nat got stabbed because she got made. Turns out it’s hard to be a spy once you’re a world famous, alien-ass-kicking hero. Sooner or later, someone puts two and two together and gets stabby. So we’re both benched while SHIELD figures out what to do with us.”
calendar, don’t you? What are the pictures of? Apple pies? Eagles?
“Doesn’t take a Stark level IQ to work it out,” Steve says easily, playing along despite himself. Tony hadn’t slept at all.
“You’re not in costume. Honestly, I gotta say, that hat of yours wasn’t hiding anything. What was that hat? It had wings painted on. If you were trying to mask your identity with that, then it wasn’t working, but I guess the rest of the suit was so spangly people weren’t looking at your face.”
“Yes. I’m sorry.” Standing suddenly, Tony spreads his arms and raises his voice, eyes scanning the cave walls until his gaze fixes on one point, before quickly drifting away again. “I hadn’t anticipated an attack like this.”
He walks through into the bright, blue light of a fully-body scan. He holds himself still until it’s scanned him from head to toe, and then he swats the lingering beams of light away.
“Come over here,” Tony repeats, looking away. “I need you to hold my arm down.”
“Hey,” he says reaching out a hand.
“I’ve found that people rarely do,” Yinsen says, looking up and meeting Tony’s eyes; he doesn’t look surprised, but then even death came as no surprise to Yinsen. He nods infinitesimally and Tony digs his fingers into the wall.
“I mean, I know you think I’m a – a boy scout, and maybe my values seem a little old-fashioned now, but...” Steve shrugs, spreading his hands helplessly. He can see Tony’s eyes following the movement, Tony’s own hands twitching.  “During the war, people were twice as brave as me every day, without the benefit of any lab experiment. I’m nothing special. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
“My apologies, Tony. Oft I forget how fragile these Midgardian trinkets are, despite the great power they contain.”
catch you.”
Pepper makes a noncommittal noise that Tony feels through the hitch of her shoulders against his chin, through his own shoulder where it’s pressed against her back. He touches her arm.
Tony runs his tongue along his gums, sucking thoughtfully on his teeth with his head tilted to the side, as though tasting a fine wine. He smacks his lips.
“Okay,” he says. “I’m done.”
Next to him, Tony snorts. Steve keeps his eyes closed, fuzzy and content, and feels Tony take hold of chin and turn his face into the light.
She shoots Tony a pointed look. Tony grins at her. She’s going to get a huge Christmas bonus.
Tony shrugs. “Tried it, fired it, basement remains one hundred per cent portal free. Sure, they’ve got the tech, but they haven’t got it working yet.”
He stands, because he always thinks better, talks better, when he’s moving. Pacing along the edge of the room, he raps his knuckles on the back of each chair he passes. Fury’s gaze follows him.
“Mr Stark,” she says briskly, “if I’m going to keep doing this for your team, I want a raise. And Captain America’s autograph for my son.”
, and I’d be building a whole lot quicker if
Tony unravels Steve’s sweatshirts, laying the gun bare on the desktop, and a bright beam of light shoots down from the ceiling to the desk. Steve watches it zip back and forth over the gun,  weaving a 3D framework of light over the top of it, until movement catches his attention – things on wheels are rolling out from under one of the larger desks, their necks unfolding like strange metal birds.
“Dirt,” Steve says helpfully.
The smile drops from Thor’s face. He sits down on a stool and rests his chin on his hand, cape pooling on the ground around his feet. He looks, for a moment, as grave and as ancient as a statue. After a pause, and a heavy sigh, he says, “Nay, he is not well, he is troubled. There is a darkness to his thoughts and a shadow in his eyes. He has become blind to how his family loves him and that cage, I fear, is stronger even than the prison we must keep him in.”
feel bad about Loki. Christ, we need some vodka and some – doughnuts, I know I have doughnuts somewhere.”
“And that’s saying something, coming from you.”
“How did you—” Steve begins, but when Natasha lifts her head, it’s Tony she looks at.
Patting Steve on the head with his free hand – Steve’s knees buckle – he stamps away to the end of the crocodile Clint has arranged. Up ahead, Steve can see Iron Man drifting over everyone’s heads, shouting, “Make way, make way, crime-fighting in progress! Superheroes coming through!”
“I don’t think I could have imagined that.” Steve smiles wryly. “But I couldn’t have imagined the internet or reality TV either.”
The movie ends in a bloodbath, of course, and the morning is cold and bright and too damn early. They walk home; or to, Steve can’t help but darkly think, whatever is left of home.
“Results inconclusive. Immediate readings suggest it is not giving off anything harmful. Materials, unknown. Energy source, unknown. Origin, unknown. Shall I alert Mr Fury?”
“Asgard is well, then?” Steve asks, and when Thor beams and nods, he adds, slowly, “And how’s... your brother?”
“How do you people eat so much?”
They all nod shakily, although none of them look particularly fit for a daring escape. Satisfied, Steve turns to the Hulk.
Bruce nods. He looks off to the side and the picture on the screen goes shaky as he lowers his arm. There’s the rustling of a map before his face reappears. “It’s about an hour to the nearest airport. I’ll need to catch a flight to a bigger city if I want to get a flight to New York, but I’ll probably make it back by tonight.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Let me see, how to explain it in forties-speak? Well golly gee, Cap, stopping the time-travel was just a dandy side-effect of the super swell temporary paralysis. Gee whiz.”
“Hey, it worked again,” he says. “That probably means it’s…”
JARVIS seems to hesitate, while Steve clenches his jaw and holds his breath, and then, “Captain Rogers is present, sir.”
“I’ve had plenty of bad ideas,” he says, once the silence had stretched uncomfortably long. “But I always tried to point them at the bad guys instead of at my own home.”
“Obie,” he gasps.
“Of course, sir.”
Tony’s hand clenches. “Steve…”
“Goodnight, Tony.”
“On my world, Tony Stark might be a fascist asshole, but he never hides.”
There’s a soft knock on the door. It opens a crack and Sofia peeks through, looking unruffled. Over her shoulder, the front row of press is barely visible, craning their necks like schoolchildren while they try to catch a glimpse of the team.
Romanoff tilts her head in contemplation, dipping her spoon back into the bowl to chase the final dregs of milk and cereal. Metal scrapes against china.
Tony can’t see a damn thing.
“Top of the morning to ya,” Clint declares as they enter, lifting up his coffee mug in greeting. He’s sitting on the edge of the island work surface, his feet up on a stool.
Sofia beams at him brightly. She slips back out the door to ready the press, looking about the happiest Tony has ever seen her. He watches Thor heave Bruce to his feet one-handed, Barton clapping Bruce on the shoulder and saying, “Picture them naked and crying, man,” and then he turns and nudges Steve in the side.
going on – it was all ripped out, and just a couple weeks ago, judging by the dust build-up.”
Tony breathes out.
“Pepper,” he mumbles. “I’m trying.”
It’s a normal sight for him, since the Chitauri invasion and the extremely public return of Captain America. At the time, he would have been perfectly content to just give out his address to any gal or fella who wanted to take the time to write him, but Fury had loudly say no to that. His apartment is a secret, leased with a false name, and all Steve’s mail goes through SHIELD to be checked and checked again before he ever sets eyes on it.
And there'll be kissing too, I promise.
if I could avoid it, but...” Steve shrugs. “Some of the fellas I knew woulda probably shocked and offended
for your arc reactor tech to appear. But you-”
“Agents,” she says.
“And the same to you,” Steve says, leaning forwards as he speaks to the screens. He’s peripherally aware ofTony sitting down next to him, leaning back. “Bruce, Thor – and you two as well,” he adds, with a glance at Clint and Natasha. “You’ll want to hear this, too. Have either of you ever seen something like this before? You especially, Thor - do you think this could be from your realm?”
“We’re very sorry,” says one of the men kneeling before Clint and Clint’s bow and arrow, “and we won’t do it again.”
second chance, right? Everything else was just... just practice runs, 1.5 chances. Nothing seems – What do I do? How do you move on from your own freaking self-sacrificial death?”
“Stamp on a foot, then? Right hook? Use your imagination.”
“What are you-? Tony!” Steve shouts, running after him. The wind drags him forwards. Papers are blowing in the air, screwdrivers rolling across the floor, the light is twenty feet away and ten feet across – six – three – one foot – an inch –
There’s a soft click and then the ground sinks in on itself, the tarmac rattling and clicking as it folds into a flight of stairs, descending under the alley into darkness. With a faint smile, Tony draws his hand out of his pocket to reveal his car keys, his thumb still pressed over one of the buttons on the key chain.
him,” Clint says. “I just didn’t fight the giant, angry mutant’s decision to put a gun in his mouth and chew.”
“Wait,” Tony says, his voice muffled in his hands. “I need a sample of your DNA. For the shield. Don’t worry, I’m not going to extract the serum,” he adds. He lifts his head and eyes Steve plaintively. “I’ve learned that particular lesson. This does the opposite. I code the shield so it responds only to you. If it ever falls into Osborne’s hands, all it’d be good for is a paperweight.”
“Didn’t they have Sesame Street in the forties? No, I guess not, and anyway, what am I talking about? You weren’t watching kid’s TV in the forties, you were busy growing muscles and punching Hitler. The twenties, then. Good God, grandpa, when were you born?”
i'm back ?? with an update ??? Decided to have fun with these characters again because I love them and they deserve support from each other. Maybe I was thinking of another mcu movie that got out exactly a year ago and missed an opportunity to show Thor surrounded by friends and loved ones, supporting him in trying times ? Who knows !
-Be rational here, Clint, I know you're not used to use your brain but listen. Steve and I... We're just dating. He'll just.... He wouldn't marry someone like me, he's probably just waiting for someone to walk around the corner, you know. Someone like Peggy Carrter, for example.
Tony is four and tip-toeing, in his matching bathrobe and slippers, past the door of his father’s study, when a ghost appears at the end of the corridor – a boy who looks a lot like Tony, except he’s pale and naked and covering his mouth with his hands like Tony does when he’s trying not to cry.
“You know what the worst part is?” Tony laughs, a little too brightly. “I wouldn’t put it past them. Tell me they’re building a computer out of the skulls of kittens and I’d probably believe you.”
internet famous, I mean. Bigger than kittens level of famous.”
“You miss her?”
“Okay,” Steve says, standing up straight. He speaks low and fast. “We need to get out there and see what’s going on. Widow, with me. Hawkeye, I want you at the main doors, keeping watch. What other exits we got?”
R.Y. Steve nods, squeezing Tony’s hand.
“Thanks,” Bruce says, taking it. He pauses, frowns and reaches into his mouth to a pull a bit of twisted metal out from between his teeth. “I can’t believe you let him eat a gun.”
Howard remains frozen, remains absolutely frozen with his cigar still burning down to his fingers, until Maria grabs hold of his elbow and begins to cry.
“Hill,” Romanoff murmurs, nodding back.
“Tony,” Steve says. “The ice.”
, who’s sitting a few feet away and staring at him with his mouth. He looks different, somehow, and Steve’s vision is too blurry to make out their surroundings but he knows, is certain, it’s somewhere he’s never been before.
interesting,” and hangs up.
“Making something expand when pressure decreases is simple. I’m talking clicky pen simple, here. Even you aren’t impressed by clicky pens, right?”
Rhodey heaves the last bolt of fabric onto the desk and, lifting his faceplate says, “This had better be good. I’m a pilot, not a courier.”
“They’re not pirate boots,” Steve protests.
Tony stares after them, his back to Steve. Now that the action is over, the park seems suddenly and impossibly still. Steve listens for a shout or a fight or the wail of a siren, but there’s nothing. The leaves shiver. When he concentrates, he can hear Tony’s shallow breaths. Steve stares at his back, taking in the rumpled shirt he worked in all day and then slept in; and the way he holds himself so tensely, as if he’s ready and waiting for another fight to break out or for the stock market to crash. Back home, Tony stands this way as well. In all the possible universes, all the Tony Starks must stand this way.
“Mr Stark.”
“Yeah,” Tony says. “Maybe.”
Tony is so engrossed in the code for JARVIS’ birthday upgrades, he barely notices his cell is ringing until Barton throws a pen at him and JARVIS says, levelly,
Pepper nods. She kisses him again quickly and pulls away, retrieving her cell phone and the threads of her conversation from Sofia and glancing back once over her shoulder as she goes. Tony watches until the doors have closed behind her, then he turns in the nearly empty lobby and heads back to the team.
“Excuse me?”
Tony glances over at Barton, who nods without surprise. Not so classified, then. Hill’s determined pace slows to a halt and she lowers her voice.
“He’s still on his robotics kick,” Ms Potts says mournfully to Natasha, as if picking up the thread of some conversation they had before Steve arrived. She’s on her fifth mojito. “It’s not that I mind the new robots. Some of them are quite useful. And goodness knows without JARVIS, Tony would probably have died in a horrible, self-inflicted accident by now.”
He clears his throat.
“On Friday, yeah, yeah. They only nag me because they’re embarrassed, you know. The board. When we stopped making weapons they were all weeping in the showers, defecting to Hammer, preparing for ritual suicide. Obviously we’re more successful than ever now. I think I’ve given them all complexes.”
Shaking his head, Tony sidesteps Steve. The air in the workshop is cold and still and Tony moves quickly through it, removing the sensors and hissing when they pinch at his skin. He unplugs the wires and undoes the fastenings and slowly, slowly, sheds it like a skin, dropping it all piece-by-piece onto the floor behind him. He feels raw, pink and new underneath. He pulls a change of clothes from a desk drawer and tugs them on.
“Maybe not, but from what I’ve heard, you’re more like the kind of guy to embrace them.”
He goes soft again, saying, “And I chose to kiss you, didn’t I? I know, I know, how could have I, if you hadn’t
Tony glances up at him but Steve is staring down at Tony’s wrists. Tony takes a deep breath. Nineteen twenty-four. He presses the button on the side of his watch. He closes his eyes.
“Sir?”
“Hard work and good luck?” Steve says, running his hands over the box.
The other Tony begins to lift his head, but Tony can already feel his body reacting, fading, running away –
“Uh... which?”
“Where’s Cap?”  Tony mouths at him.
“Certainly, sir. And shall I alert Mr Fury to recent developments?”
“I apologise,” Thor says, “for my hasty actions. I should have not leapt without looking, and nor should I have abandoned my team in a moment of strife. My actions were driven not by selfishness but by surprise.”
It’s dark and cold and quiet, beneath the pounding rhythm of the rain; the kind of quiet that comes from even the most hardened criminals taking a look outside and deciding to stay in for the night. Steve sprays water in an arching wave as he pulls over in front of Stark Tower. Through the haze of rain, he can see Mr Coulson dashing down the steps with a giant, red umbrella. They share a grim nod, and Steve passes him the keys to his bike wordlessly and trudges through the door into, at last, a little moment of warmth and of peace.
“Something like that.”
Lodged inside his own ribcage, beating in tandem with his own shaky heart, and Steve
He thrashes, and thrashes, and then he is gone.
It’s Tony. Just out of reach.
He supposes some poor new recruit, signed up to SHIELD for a life of espionage and intrigue, got stuck with the job of redelivering the safe mail to him. He doesn’t know for sure, as he’s never seen them. He’s rarely there. It’s not his home.
“Britney Spears, right?”
“It’s the American dream. JARVIS, hold all current projects, keep the homefires burning, try not to pine for us while we’re gone.”
“That’s not what I was getting at.”
this?”
“Touch the top left corner,” Tony says. He’s grinning.
Steve stares down at the back of his head. Tony is barefoot, although Steve finds his socks tossed on the floor at the foot of the bed. One of Tony’s arms dangles over the edge, the other draped across his stomach, wrapped around one of his flat computers. Steve eases it out from under his arm. Moving around to the other side of the bed, he places it on the nightstand next to Tony and leaves his socks folded on top. He looks at Tony again.
“You old sentimentalist.”
Tony is forty-two when he takes a little boy by the hand at last, turning him gently away.
“Or Barton?” Tony smirks. “Probably less high risk, knowing him. And knowing
The silvery liquid seems to come alive in the light, swirling agitatedly with an incandescent glow as Tony pulls the circuit board out of the gap in his arm. His hand goes suddenly, startlingly limp in the circuitry’s absence and Steve tries to ignore the feel of it beneath his grip, and he tries to ignore the glimpses – beneath the revealed panel of metal and the miniscule golden wiring – of Tony’s bare muscle.
“It’s Modigliani, actually.”
“Is that all that matters to you?” Steve asks softly. “Is that really all you’re ever going to do? Just keep hiding underground where it’s safe and you can
The descent is just a brief one. The elevator beeps again when it reaches the bottom, the floor settling into place. Tony taps in the final exit code on the black console panel. It ripples into green one last time before the colour seeps away entirely, the panel blending seamlessly into its white surroundings, and a crack forms down the middle of the wall; a pair of automatic doors that glide open before him.
“You want Breezy Point, we’ll do Breezy Point. I’ll buy Breezy Point.”
She nods at Steve again, then turns and continues on her way – up the stairs, not down into the elevator, Steve notes, watching her red hair swinging a little longer than it had been the last time he saw her. Even in slippers, her footsteps are as steady and precise as a dancer’s.
“Hm,” Tony says.
“Theoretically world champion.”
“That,” Barton mutters, “I’d pay to see.”
Steve’s smile shifts slightly, not quite dimming, and he says, “Well, it’s been a surprise. But it sure is interesting. I thought there’d be more flying cards by now, for starters.”
. Now spread your fingers as wide as you can.”
“Noted, sir.”
“Three minutes is a long damn time to spend with a nuclear missile. I was ready for it. Hell, I was kinda
“You can’t go out in towels. You’ll get arrested, public indecency, even in the depraved future. Or you’ll get wet. Whichever is your least favourite, that’s what’ll happen.”
Tony takes the hummus with him back to the table and he drops down next to Steve into Pepper’s vacated seat, leaving the seat next to Romanoff empty. She glances up at him, with her eyebrows raised and her mouth full of muesli, and then her gaze drifts past him. Tony turns to look too and sees Steve staring at the open door; the last, faint sounds of Pepper’s heels are still drifting through.
“It’s fine,” Steve breathes. “Go back to sleep. Everything’s fine.”
He stares expectantly until Steve swings his feet over the side of the bed, standing up and picking his discarded bag up from the floor in one smooth motion. He carries it over to the desk as he speaks over his shoulder, hearing Tony bound after him.
“I got in a lot of fights.”
“Troubled? Oh yeah, sure, he started an alien invasion. That’s troubled, alright.”
Tony passes him a pair of ear defenders, with that same bright look in his eyes, and he says, “Of course it’s dangerous. That’s what we’re here for, right?”
“Go back to sleep, Tony,” she says again.
Clint waves a hand and mutter something that might be, “Tab my ass,” as he goes, jogging to keep up with the Hulk. Tony turns to Steve.
“I don’t want to be the kind of fella,” he says, slowly, shaping his words with extra care around his clumsy tongue, “that chooses to stand by and do nothing.”
“Sirs, there is a half a box of doughnuts in the living room work station, where Mr Stark left it, and Dr Foster requests use of the private elevator.”
His jaw clenching shut, he thrusts the piece of paper back at Tony, so Tony takes it. He folds it in half lengthways. Running his fingernails up and down the crease, he clears his throat.
They speak over each other, then stare at each other. Tony grins. He pushes his hands into his pockets and rocks back and forth on his heels. Steve does nothing but smile – but he doesn’t leave.
“You couldn’t have,” Tony says to the wall. “Trust me, you couldn’t have changed a thing. It doesn’t work like that.”
“Excuse me?”
“What?” No,” Steve says, holding up his hand as Tony takes a deep breath. “I don’t want to know.”
He cuts himself off, swallowing quickly, before he adds, “Maybe if she’d just had someone fighting for her.”
“Oh,” Steve breathes.
“Got in a fight.”
“Oh, come
He beckons with both hands impatiently, while Bruce makes his way down the staircase. He grabs Bruce’s bag from him as soon as he’s within reach, and balances it on the back of the couch, propped against his hip, so he can tug the zipper open. “You all packed already? What have you got in here?”
It takes Tony – half-asleep, out of practice,
“Be careful,” Steve warns as he begins to pick his way through the mess. “Looks like it could all collapse any second. Tony?” He glances back. Tony hasn’t moved from his place in the doorway.

“I shall endeavour, sir, though I might not succeed.”
“She enquires after your wellbeing.”
He watches. When the clip ends, he zooms in further, dragging the image until the screen is filled with light.
“You’re on the list, Captain,” the doorman says. “A valet will take your motorcycle to Mr Stark’s private garage if you’d like to head right up?”
“I’ve got it,” Tony whispers the moment Steve is close enough to hear. “Swapped samples last night. Probably enough enhancements in my blood to fool them for a while.”
“Of course, even the fortune of our host pales in comparison to the wealth of fair Asgard, where the streets are paved with gold and mead runs like water. But what he lacks in riches, he makes up for in Midgardian sorcery. Behold!” Beaming magnanimously, Thor presses a button on the microwave and, as the door springs open, pulls out a bag of fresh popcorn. “See how the grains have ‘popped’ and yet the magic box contains no flame!”
The man is choking, coughing out water and clawing at the strange glowing thing in his chest, but as he coughs he rolls over in the wreckage and looks Howard straight in the eye and he croaks, “Dad?”
“I’m not going anywhere until Rogers is taken out in chains.”
He didn’t think Steve would.  He thought Steve was gone.  Just like his father.  Just like his mother.
“I tried,” she said. “I got to a hundred.” She gazed up at him, and he knew what was coming. He knew. “Can I sleep with you?”
Tony sighed in defeat, and took Steve’s hand. He brought it to his mouth and kissed his fingers, making Steve smile even more. “Sometimes I wish I could stay mad at you for longer than three seconds,” he said.
Once in the bedroom, Steve grasped the end of Tony’s tie as he backed him toward the bed. “You’re still wearing this.”
“I’m sorry, baby,” Tony went on. “I’m so sorry if I made you feel like that. I wasn’t thinking that at all. All I was thinking was that I hated his fucking guts and couldn’t stand to listen to him anymore.”
Four soldiers hauled him to his feet.  There was blood on his face, running down his cheek.  The gash in his forehead had reopened.  His sparkling eyes found Tony’s and he grinned.  “We’re having fun now, huh, Tony?”
Her lip began to tremble and a bright sliver of self-hatred slipped into his heart.
“Hey, don’t get too serious, ‘kay?  Don’t get lost.  I need you.”
Steve moved on to the nail of Tony’s ring finger. Painted it with easy, precise strokes. “Then, I’m there.”
He was young, but sturdily built, and the hand holding his own weapon was firm, solid as a rock.  “Drop your weapon.”
“And your alcohol consumption has gone up, too.”
to come over. I wanted to see you. See both of you. And I really am okay now.” He hoped it was true. He could usually work through these things in a day or two, but sometimes they intensified. Sometimes they got worse before they got better.
“It was just kid stuff.”
“Oh,” Steve said. “Tony. Hey.”
“Do you want me to call-”
Steve nodded against the pillows. “Yes,” he said, and shuddered as Tony opened his jeans and pulled them down his legs.
“Oh, I like the sound of that.”
“What are you going to do?”
“I’m a bad-ass, Steve,” Tony said, all the while thanking every god that ever was for Steve Rogers and praying that he’d be able to find him the help he needed.  Rhodey was right--he couldn’t be his shrink, but he could find him the best one.  “You don’t even know how much of a bad-ass I am.”
Tony took a few steps away. He rubbed his face with his hands, and Steve could see how tired he looked. How close he was to breaking. “I heard you with her in there,” Tony said, nodding his head toward the door. “Earlier.”
When he got back to the apartment, he showered, shaved, checked his e-mails and messages again, then ate breakfast. Eggs and whole-grain toast Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays. Hot cereal and fruit Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. He changed it up on Sundays. Sometimes he had toaster waffles. Sometimes Pop-Tarts. Sometimes, he’d throw caution completely to the wind and have a bowl of Apple Jacks or Cocoa Pebbles. Once, a couple weeks in, he poked around in the freezer and found a Red Baron pizza and cooked that. It was weird. Eating pizza for breakfast was
He could hear voices.
He could see her face, her little pink lips. They curved upward. “Yes, Daddy.”
“I need something.”
“Steve.”
Steve ran a hand through his hair. “
Steve wanted to tell him he loved him. Right then and right there. Standing in the doorway, holding each other in a bright bar of sunlight, but he didn’t. It had only been a few weeks. A few precious weeks.
It still took a long time to get there, but it was time well spent. Steve sat beside him, looking out the window, holding his hand. He ran his thumb across Tony’s knuckles ceaselessly, and when they stopped at a market for a drink, he held his hand the whole time they were inside.
Tony flipped the dish towel he was holding over his shoulder and came around the kitchen island.  Steve sat down onto a stool and hooked his finger through the belt loop of Tony’s jeans.
“Look,” Steve said softly.  “Maybe I

He was three days past a week-long bender.  Or so.  He wasn’t one hundred percent sure anymore.  He wasn’t one hundred percent sure about anything anymore.  Except that it was easier to stay drunk here because no one came around.  He was alone.  And being alone here was better than being alone in the Tower for another reason too:  Steve had never been here, so he couldn’t miss Steve while he was here.  No, this place was completely and utterly Steve-free.  No thoughts of him lounging by the pool.  Or cooking in the kitchen.  Or running on the beach.  Or lying there on the couch, the sky ablaze in the window behind him, sunset painting his bare skin in alternating stripes of red and orange, his head thrown back, long lashes against his cheeks, whispering love-words while Tony lay between his thighs doing things to him that no one had ever been allowed to do before because Steve was
“Mostly because she’d kick my ass.”
“Nothing,” Tony answered.  He was holding a pair of pliers and was using them to hold a piece of metal.  It looked like steel.  Not as strong as vibranium, but strong enough.  A blowtorch sat next to his right hand.  “Just you.  You know, in general.”
Steve turned back, smiling a little. “Really?”
“713-B, huh?” Steve said.  He suddenly felt very light, as if even a puff of breeze could blow him away.
Steve relaxed into the sofa, boneless and sated. He tugged weakly at Tony’s t-shirt. “Want you. Want you to-”
“Yeah,” Steve said. “In July. When we come up in July. Right?”
There was a pause, and Tony was afraid he would say no.  Afraid he would lose his chance.  He was ready now.  It had to be now.  If he didn’t take this opportunity right now, he never would.  He would let it go by, and they would maybe live together for a little longer, but soon, Steve would leave.  He’d just leave.  Tony would wake up one morning, and that old ruck-sack would be gone from its place next to the door, his leather jacket would be gone from the back of the couch where he always left it, and he would be gone.  He might not even leave a note this time.
Steve sat silently, just looking at him, then leaned abruptly forward over his clasped hands.”Mr. Stark,” he said, and his voice was both soft and cold, “we’re here because we want to be. We wouldn’t let her come alone. Not even if she wanted to. Luck has
not sorry.”
“Are you going to be good?”
“It was...different,” Tony said, after a long pause.”
“It’s not secret,” Steve said. “Just slow. We’re taking it slow.”
Tony shrugged.  He was standing against the counter, bare feet crossed at the ankle, wearing sweats and a black tank top.  His hair was clean and smooth.  He’d put on a little weight since he’d come back.  He looked almost the same as he had before the snap.  Before Siberia.  He was eating a bowl of cereal, and it was all so familiar, so Tony, it was infuriating.
“Well, hello, Mr. Stark,” Steve drawled.
“No, Steven, my objection to you is not your masculinity. It’s your mediocrity.”
, was he? Willie was, and he got 660. And did you see that catch he made in the ‘54 Series? Come on. We all know you did.”
Tony felt the tension run out of his shoulders immediately, telling himself that it wasn’t
Steve swallowed and he shuddered out a breath.  Tony didn’t want him to be upset, didn’t want him to hurt, but these were things he wanted to say.  He wanted Steve to know.  In case he hadn’t before.

Steve.
Tony kissed the underside of his jaw, nuzzled into his chest.  “Yeah.  I’m good.  Just need my human blanket.  Go back to sleep.”
That's the end of this story...almost the end of the series!  One more little story left, but its really just a tiny little coda to this.  There's nothing really substantial about it, just something short and sweet, because after all the absolute shit I have put my poor guys through, I thought they deserved a gentle little denouement.  I will save my effusive thanks for the end of that story, but I will give you a quick thanks now for reading and for being there!!  See you in a day or so!!
to think about it. Deep down, he knew if--when--he finally did think about it, it would become apparent just how much he should
Steve glanced up.  His face was still lost in shadow, but Tony could hear the smile in his voice.  “Fuck you.”
Steve tore a long strip from the corner of his napkin.  “I don’t know.  We haven’t always been on the best terms.”
Tony reached for him and Steve stepped out of his reach.  “No.  No touching, remember?”
The guy was late. The
Tony slid his hands along Steve’s back. His skin was starting to dry, but it still felt gloriously smooth beneath his palms. Gloriously soft, and he thought he could get used to that too. More--addicted to it. “Well, we got that right, then. That’s what tonight was supposed to be about, right?” he asked, stroking him complacently. “Talking?”
“You lost weight.”
Tony huffed a sigh. “Steve,” he said firmly. “Seriously. My fault.”
Coffee and...friend...stuff. And cue the angst.
Steve’s tongue stole out and touched his bottom lip--
Tony couldn’t sit anymore.  He leapt to his feet and turned his back.  Every word they said was like a branding iron in his mind.  He knew those words, oh god, yes, he knew them.  He had heard them in his own nightmares for months.  Heard them and felt the crush of Steve’s hands around his throat, choking him, choking the life out of him, felt the razor slice through the thin skin of his cheek, seen the glint of light on the blade as Steve raised it to his own throat.
Strange sipped his coffee.  “I understand that.”
“It’s what I was trained for.”
Steve shoved his hands in his pockets. “You’re not rushing to answer my question either,” he mumbled.
“I’m not gonna leave you.  I’m never gonna leave you.”
“What’s wrong?” Tony asked as soon as he picked up.
Tony slid closer. He was working against Steve’s steadying hands, but it wasn’t really that difficult. “Mmm. Forest fire. Yeah. Yeah. I want that. Let’s do that instead.”

Natasha laughed.  Right out loud.  The couple in the next booth looked at her, annoyed.  They were wearing black arm-bands.  People on a pilgrimage.  There were a lot of them in town for the vigil and the reception.
“I’m not really in a laughing mood.”
Steve delivered a sharp kick to his ankle, and Bucky laughed. “He
Tony looked away, his face working.  One tear fell and he wiped his cheek brusquely against his shoulder.
“Thinking long thoughts?”
Tony shook his head. "This isn't about
A wave of gratitude crashed over him.  He put his head on Rhodey’s shoulder.  “When are you going to give in and marry me, James?  You know we belong together.”
“About what?”
the words “I love you”. Even if he felt them more and more every day, he didn’t say them because it was too soon and he didn’t want to scare Tony away. He didn’t
“I’m counting on you,” he said, and squeezed Wanda’s hands.  His mouth quirked down in a disapproving but affectionate frown.  “You have to be the one in control, okay?
“Five.”
“You have no idea,” Tony whispered, and Steve circled his arms around Tony’s waist, crushing him against his chest and kissed him intently, deeply, like that first night, the first time back at the Tower.
“Maybe you’re right.”
pleasure. Especially with Steve. Especially since he had never had anyone interested in giving to him before. It still boggled Tony’s mind. That anyone---
“Wrong about what?”
“Do you?”
Steve. Sitting so peaceful there in the sun. Tony smiled a little. “Yeah. It would be,” he said gently.
Steve nodded. His hands rested on Tony’s thighs and slid along them, the denim smooth under his palms. “I know, Tony. Me too.”
. He just couldn’t seem to help himself. He’d been in New York for six months. Morgan came at Christmas and was staying through the rest of the school year. That was what they’d decided, he and Pepper. School years with Tony in New York, summers with Pep in L.A. Every other weekend and alternating holidays--Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter--and video calls whenever Morgan wanted. It seemed like the best situation, and Tony was ecstatic that he was getting the better end of the deal since he got her for more months out of the year.
“Strange?  Isn’t it bad enough those poor people lost their homes and livelihoods?  Now they’ve got to put up with that guy?  What’s the world coming to?”
Steve smiled a sad little smile.  “He always says no.”
“That was a low blow,” she panted.
Really.”
Tony rolled his eyes affectionately.  “No, you don’t

been feeling a little sad since coming back here. A little lonely. “How ‘bout you? Are you sad?”
Tony drove fast too.
“After we got back from Sokovia, I had FRIDAY set a protocol to alert me if you were in distress during the night,” he said.
“Yeah.  They said to tell you good-bye.  We didn’t want to wake you.”
“Are you sure?”
Steve grinned, looking like a kid again, the way he’d looked when he was seventeen and Tony had jumped up onto his back and had him carry him up the rest of the stairs. They’d said ‘I love you’ that day. But they’d fought first. Fought over Howard.
Steve grinned and yanked Tony toward him and into his arms.  Tony melted against him, holding on tightly.  “I meant Strange,” he whispered, and Steve laughed in his ear, then kissed him.
“Will you be back for school next year?”
Steve Rogers saw red, and for a little while, the only thing he knew, was that Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross was going to die.
“No. It’s okay. It doesn’t matter. Are you okay?”
“Yes, Ma’am.”
"What if I just gave you the money?  I could write a check for the whole thing."
“We’re getting ready to begin our descent, boss.  If you’ve got anything out, stow it.”
He nodded, almost without thinking. “Okay.”
It was getting harder.
“Tell Steve good-bye for me.  Like Nat said, eighteen hours.”
“You do?”
Tony laughed a little. “Nah,” he said. Even though...he
“I know,” Steve said, leaning forward to affix the tourniquet to the stump of Bucky’s upper arm. Bucky shrieked again as he pulled it tight, cutting off the flow of blood, then slumped on the ground, silent at last. Steve checked his pulse. It was thready but there. “ETA on the medevac?”
And Tony kinda wanted to see it.
“Really?”
Tony didn’t say anything. He couldn’t. It was everything he wanted to hear. Everything he had always needed. Everything he’d always wanted, and nothing he could ever have, so he didn’t say anything. He just came closer, slipped his arms tighter around Steve’s waist, burrowed his head deeper into his chest, silent, just holding him, just listening.
“Really?”
That warm feeling--that
“What was it?”
Both of them felt hurt--almost betrayed. Neither of them knew what to do about it.
Part Two of chapter five. Just a hit of fluff...with a hit of angst. Because you can't have one without the other! At least not in one of my stories 😉
This time the laugh was softer, muffled by Steve’s chest as Tony snuggled deeper into him. “Just my feelings a little,” he said. “I’ll heal.”
“Come on, Doc, don’t be that way.”  He cocked his head, thinking of Natasha.  “We’re all on the same side here.”
“Shh,” Tony said.  “It’s okay, baby, I’m here.”
“Shut up.”  Then, to Steve, “I said drop your weapon, sir, and nobody else has to get hurt, okay?”
“What if I just ask you yes or no questions?  Will that work?  You don’t even have to talk.  Just blink once for yes, twice for no.”
Tony sat back in his chair and ran a hand through his hair, his brilliant mind weighing his options. It wasn’t really the answer he’d expected, and he didn’t want to hurt Steve by just saying
He laughed lazily and kissed him again. “You can’t have changed that much.”
Tony glanced at Steve. He was looking at Natasha again, listening to her talk, but Tony could still see that pink tinge to his cheeks. “Of course, he likes me,” he said lightly. “I’m extraordinarily likeable.”
One or the other of them--or both; Steve prayed it was both--must have realized that, because they turned to each other almost simultaneously. “Did I hear you say you were taking physics?” Tony asked.
“Yes.”  She patted his chest, unsure if he was even entirely there.
you coming tonight?”
Steve frowned.  “What do you mean, she doesn’t like you?”
“No.”
“Everything has.”
“He called Nat ‘Peggy’,” Sam said.
“I’m sorry,” Tony snapped a little more sharply than even he wanted to, “how is this any of your business?”
Steve dropped his paperwork in his room and changed.  It was getting late, and he knew he should try and rest, but he was too wired to sleep yet.  He didn’t know if that was because of the coming battle, the serum, or the residual aftershocks of touching Stormbreaker, but whatever the reason, he knew he’d never sleep now.
The tears broke free.  The tears he'd been holding onto all day, and he collapsed against her, into her embrace, letting her hold him up, letting her support him and comfort him.  Letting her hands, and her voice, and her
Steve leaned back against the headboard again, watching Tony give Ross’ money away.
“I guess one of us has got to remember it, huh?”
Tony looked up at him.  His Tony.  “It’s not,” he said, and then he kissed him.
She’d told him that, growing up.  It had been one of her mottos, and it was still a good one.  One he believed in.
“Okay.”
“I guess. It just seems like the more syllables, the shadier the person.”
Steve was smiling sadly at him when he turned back.
“Yeah, he didn’t enter into it much.”
"Just outside.  I need some air."
“Not to mention various other...costumes of a rather less functional nature.”
Tony tossed him aside and he and Natasha rolled to the ground, playfully tussling.  Bruce sidled closer to Sam who just folded his arms, watching them wrestle.
“Go.”
“That’s a little harsh, isn’t it?  I thought you guys were all about the saluting.”
“Since you’re here, you already know they do.”
“I’ve always been on Team Steve,” Tony said. “I just couldn’t always act on it.”
. I-I want-”
Tony fell silent next to him, scratching his short nails lightly over Steve’s sides, his stomach.  He hadn’t really meant Peggy when he’d asked, and although Steve had made it worth his while, answering the way he had--Tony’s mind was actively turning it into a bumper sticker--he still needed to know the actual answer.  He didn’t think it made a difference, but after the other night, he needed to know.  For his own peace of mind.
Sam nodded.  “That’s what I thought.”
," he went on, now trailing his mouth over the tie. "Bound up like this." He bent and pressed Steve's wrist against the mahogany headboard. Steve moaned, his eyes half-lidded. "Do
"I can't.  I've got state inspections at the shelter this week, then the fundraising dinner and auction next week."
“I like you, too,” Tony said, then smiled, thinking of Clint. “
Behind him, Wanda gave him a not-so-subtle nudge, and he nodded again.
, they were still together.  He hoped Steve would keep that in mind while he was locked away.  Like a tiger in a cage.

Jarvis, is dead. ‘ JARVIS’ is dead.  Vision, too.  I drove Pepper away a dozen times, and I finally managed to make one stick.  I have failed at every single relationship I’ve ever had.”  Tony looked down at his hands.  Those clever, brilliant hands.  “A year ago today, the love of my life--the one I thought would last forever--tried to kill me, then slit his own throat while I stood there and watched.  Then they carted him away to an asylum.  Exactly like he told me they would do.  The one thing that I promised him I would
They lay like that together for a while, breathing in each other’s scent and existing inside the heat they made together, the afterglow only marred by the fact that Tony was not technically free, and Steve was keeping something from him.
he whispered to himself.
He’d practiced on his bed in the hospital room in Wakanda, getting in and out by himself with as much ease and grace as a person could muster.  He’d practiced everything and had gotten very good at all of it.  The chair didn’t impede him much when he didn’t think about it, but here, in this new situation, after the arguments and the hurt feelings and this extremely tenuous truce between them, Tony could see the confidence draining out of his face as he moved up alongside and set the brake.
“Not yet.”
Steve smiled. “Don’t tell anyone,” he said, leaning in close like he was telling Tony a grave secret, “but I already scooped a bunch out into another bowl for you. I snuck it down to the fridge in the lab.”
“I love you, Mom.”
“Acknowledged.”
“Yeah.  I’m sure.”
Bruce adjusted his glasses.  “But she did, Nat.  She did it to all of us.”
Steve laughed again. Tony laughed too. Steve didn’t seem to notice it sounded a little forced.
“Pleeease?” Steve said, drawing it out, hoping Tony could be swayed by a little bit of shameless charm. Teenage-Tony would have been. Hopefully Adult-Tony hadn’t grown out of that.
because you guys don’t belong to me.  You belong to each other.  You belong to the

“I’ll call you tonight, okay?” Tony said.
Steve fell back.  “You’re afraid of me,” he said, weakly.  “I never wanted you to be afraid of me.”
do...it was worth it. If this was truly happening, if this was
Tony’s mouth dropped open.  His heart dropped.  For one of the few instances in his life, he was rendered utterly speechless.
“Oh my Christ, Steve,” Tony said. “It’s October.”
His breath in and out in tight, measured gasps.  Nat’s hand on him, soothing him.  Fury’s tight and commanding.
Steve hoisted his bag up onto his shoulder.  “So, do you have a car here, or am I hitching a ride?”
Tony paid the kid what he’d agreed over the phone then tucked an extra fifty into the kid’s pocket and laid a finger to his own lips.  “This can stay between us, ‘kay?” he said, and the boy’s smile grew impossibly wider.
“Okay,” Tony said, and Steve was glad to hear he still sounded okay. A little down, but not too bad. That was good. He didn’t like the thought of being the cause of a sad Tony. He didn’t think he could stand it. And that was fucked up for many reasons. Many, many reasons. “Another time.”
“I thought I was.”
He felt an arm slide through his, and he tore his eyes away long enough to look down at Sarah. She smiled up at him, then looked into the living room. Sam and Wanda curled peacefully in the chair, Dodger snoozing on the floor, Steve and Morgan swapping crayons back and forth while Howard watched. Tony tipped his head against the doorjamb. He felt weak. Weak with love and happiness.
“No,” Tony said, and went to him.  “No, baby.  No.  I’m sorry.  This is all me.”  He put his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed his cheek.  Steve sat still, not moving, a troubled look on his face.  Tony kissed him again.  “I’m sorry.”  Again.  “Forgive me, ‘kay?”  Again.  Again.  “Please, baby?  Please forgive me?” He kissed him again and again, covering his face and necks with kisses until Steve finally smiled.
Steve kissed his hand again. He was blushing a little, and couldn’t seem to stop smiling. “Alright,” he said. “You get your pumpkin. I’m getting apple, though.”
“I’ve been sitting here for two hours waiting for you.”
Tony narrowed his eyes.  “
come and pull him away, but that other part, that other little part that had been waiting for him, rejoiced.
“Why?”
That wasn’t so long.
She left and Steve said, “Where was I?”
“I couldn’t even kiss you,” Steve said. “I remember.” He breathed out, pressed his mouth to Tony’s shoulder and held it there. “It
Clint rolled his eyes. “Whatever you say, Tony.”
a smile. “I’ve never ignored you for a second in my whole life,” he said. “You were always on my mind. The only thing on my mind.”
He rolled his eyes.  “Not interested.  It’s my fault it happened in the first place.  I should have stopped it.  I tried.  He was just too strong.”
Steve hit the wall where Tony had been, and Tony lashed out with his feet again, planting both in Steve’s side.  He felt a rib break under his heel, and Steve collapsed onto his left side, the razor still held tight in his fist.
“See?” Steve said, and while he was talking to Josh, his eyes were on Tony’s. They were locked, and even though they were in a crowded room, with Tony’s boyfriend right there with his arm around him, it was just the two of them again. Steve and Tony. Tony and Steve. One unit. Just like they’d always been. “He’s good,” Steve went on, talking to Tony by way of Josh. “Special. I hope you know how special he is. How perfect.” Steve turned his head then, turned his blazing eyes on Josh full force, and he took a step back. “You’d better be treating him like he is,” he said.
Steve was paler too.  His face held the pallor of someone who had been locked under the ocean for a year, only able to see the sky for an hour a week.  His hair had lost some of its golden luster.  It was darker now, dull.
“It has to be no-questions-asked.  Okay?”
He sighed.  “Come on, Steve,” he said softly.  “You do look tired.  And you can have the bed, ‘kay?  I’ll sleep on the couch.”
“Will-will you think about me sometimes? You know...when I’m-”
had gone by, but they didn't have to.  They both knew. They knew what the other meant when it happened.  They knew that they were "celebrating". Maybe it was never on the same day, or even the same time of year, but what did that matter?  It wasn't the day that deserved celebration--it was what it meant. They were together. They were in love. And that was worth celebrating more than once a year.
“I will.”
“It was good. Quiet.”
Steve eased himself fully on top of Tony’s prone body.  He was crushing him, but Tony savored the feeling.  The weight of his body was like the weight of their words.  Their promises to each other made physical.  And Steve’s lips on his neck and his shoulder made it easier.
Steve nodded without opening his eyes. “‘Kay. Good.”
Charmed. Fuck.
When they were lit--or as lit as possible--they all sang “Happy Birthday”. Except Tony. He stayed in the shadows while they did. He felt like shit. Especially when he saw how happy Steve looked. How comfortable he was with everybody else. Why didn’t Steve look over here? Why didn’t he look for Tony like he always did?
Steve shook his head. “Nothing.”
“Yes, sir,” Tony muttered.  His eyes shot dull, teenage-style daggers at his friend.
douchebag.”
“Me too, baby.”
Tony shifted, moving until he was lying partly on top of Steve, his legs on either side of Steve’s right thigh, Tony’s own within easy distance of Steve’s center.   If he just bent his knee a little… “You broke in here,” he pointed out, experimentally rolling his hips.  Pleasure burst through him at the contact.  “That makes us even.”
“‘Anywhere’s fine’.  You said that.”
Steve cocked an eyebrow at him. There was a little smile playing around his lips. He loved it when Tony got excited over weird little things. It made him happy to see him so happy. “Yeah?”
Steve pressed his mouth to Tony’s softly.  “You don’t have to be,” he said.  “We’re in this together, right?  I’m here.  I’m always gonna be here.  If something’s scary, you just tell me, okay?  We’ll fix it.  We’ll take care of it.”
Jack didn’t live far, he said. Just a couple of blocks. Steve didn’t even consider taking him back to his hotel room. He didn’t want anyone else there. He didn’t want anyone in his space. Especially someone he didn’t know. There wasn’t much privacy back in the desert. He’d gotten fiercely protective of what little he had. He wasn’t sure if the other guys felt that way, or if he was the anomaly, and he didn’t really care. All he knew was that he felt that way. Maybe if it had been Sam here with him, or his mother, or- But it wasn’t. It was Jack. Just some anonymous guy he’d picked up in some anonymous bar in some anonymous city. He’d never see him again after tonight. This wasn’t some kind of romantic encounter that would lead to breakfast, then lunch, then movie dates, and hand-holding, and sweet declarations of love spoken while lying in each other’s arms in a warm, early-morning bed.
Tony closed the distance between them immediately. “Of course,” he said, wrapping Steve up in his arms again, and holding him tight. “God. Yes, baby. Of course.”
“I’m leaving now. Thanks, Sam.”
Steve was on him in a second.  Outside, the rain had begun to taper off, but in here, the storm was still raging.  Steve climbed on top of him, his hair falling over his brow, his eyes dark.  His breath came in short pulls, almost panting, chest rising and falling fast.
Well, not a third thought, anyway.
“Do you remember your dates from when you were that age?”
And after a moment, he lifted his own hand and grasped hers.
“Happy now?”
"I know."
“New York.”
She nodded again, fresh tears coursing down the soft curve of her cheeks.  “Okay,” she mouthed, not knowing if he heard her or not.  His eyes closed again.  His chest rose and fell, rose and fell, but it wouldn’t go on much longer.  He was fading.
“We really are just friends, though,” Steve pressed.  He wanted Tony to understand that, if nothing else.  He needed him to.  “I had a bad night.  She was just making sure I was okay.”
Squeezed.
Steve took Tony’s hand and laced their fingers together.  “Tony?”
She did. She was still just a baby--a round-faced, smiling baby--but she had the same dark hair, the same dark eyes. He could see Tony in those eyes. Like there was something going on behind them. Something either far too sophisticated, or far too funny for normal people to understand. Looking at it, seeing it in someone else, a child,
the one Rogers really cares for, isn’t he?  The one he’d die for?  The one he’d choose?”
“Yeah.  Me neither.”
“This seems like a ‘but’ moment.”
.  Easily.  But I don’t want to.”  She smiled down at him with sympathy, petting his hair.  It was fine.  Blonde.  Insubstantial.  Running her fingers through it after Bruce’s coarse, thick locks felt like a travesty, but she did it anyway.  He was calming a little under her touch.  Almost in spite of himself.  That was her power.
“Checking,” Tony said.
He closed his eyes and clenched his fists.  His breath was slow, methodical, and when he looked at her, his eyes were haunted.  “Nothing ever really changes,” he said hollowly.
“Like heaven.”  He kissed Tony’s ear.  His neck.  His shoulder.  “Is it okay?” he asked.  “Is it...enough?”
“Of course.”
Sam laughed.  “You crack me up.”
didn’t know.  Okay?”
She planted a firm kiss to his mouth.  “Come on.  We’re going to be late for Bruce.”
home so much he could barely breathe sometimes, but if he was going to let Sergeant Rogers take over, he’d have to take that part of him too, because Sergeant Rogers did feel like this was home. Or close enough, anyway.
Steve laughed. He couldn’t help it. He missed Sam like fire, but having Bucky around helped. It wasn’t the same. It would never be the same, and he couldn’t wait until he and Sam could see each other again, but Bucky was a great friend. A great guy. He made Steve laugh, and he needed that sometimes. Like a drug, he needed that. Sam had gotten that. Bucky got it. Tony used to get it too. It looked like Tony was getting a lot of other stuff instead these days.
And Natasha.
“We don’t need a truce, Steve,” she said.  “I’m on your side.  I’m always on your side.”
He gestured toward Steve, and then the room at large. “
They were sitting in Bruce’s apartment.  It was old and worn, but comfortable, with shelves of books and soft places to sit.  An old, battered turntable sat on a low side-board surrounded by records.  Miles Davis was on it now.
of other words.
He still exuded authority, though. Still gave off that potent energy. Those vibrations that said power, and wealth, and control.
Wanda took it immediately.  Steve smiled at her gratefully, and gave her his other hand, as well.  “What’s it gonna feel like, red?” he asked softly.
“You’re cooking?” Steve asked. He was leaning against the doorway leading into the diner’s kitchen. He’d felt a little strange when he first told Tony about his job--it seemed a bit too close to what Howard had predicted for him as a teenager for comfort--but Tony had just told him that sounded great. That he loved diners. Loved diner-food. Loved any kind of food really. He needed food. He required it. Did this mean Steve would bring him food? He was very open to the idea of Steve being his personal food-cooker-slash-bringer.
“Did you call me because he’s in the hospital?” Pepper asked as he walked her to her car.  Happy was still her driver/bodyguard, but she’d given him the afternoon off.  Word was, he had a lady-friend.  Pepper encouraged him.  Everyone deserved something good after what they’d been through.
Something flashed through his mind.  A memory?  Maybe he hadn’t hit rock-bottom, after all.  He raised a hand to his temples and rubbed them, trying to coax it out.  “Wait, didn’t you say something about hurricane clean-up?”
“I’m sorry, what?”
Steve blushed, ducking his head.  “Sorry.  I know I’m being annoying.”
Natasha sat up, concern printed immediately on her face.  “Steve?  Honey, are you alright?”
Steve cocked an eyebrow at him.  It was amused, and it pissed Tony off.  “Are you telling me you’ve never smoked before, Stark?”
"Tony.
He flushed deep red, and nodded. “Sorry, Mom.”
. It's about
Tony made that retching noise again in his throat.
“What happened?”
Steve sunk into him, and every thought, even the ones of Tony, disappeared. “Not yet. But it’s been two hours. They said it should only take three.”
“Tony-”
“Yeah?”
“Do you ever think we should get a pet?”
“No.  He wanted to go home.”
“You hurt your hands,” Tony said, and ran one finger over the knuckles of Steve’s right hand.  “They didn’t really need a bandage, but I kinda just wanted to touch you.  I never really had before, and I was curious.”
blankets--and just laid there, trying not to think until the sky outside the window began to lighten.
“Yes. I want to.”
Steve sighed. He was lonely too. Sure, he had spent the evening with his best friend, and then came home to his mother and his dog, but he was still lonely. That wasn’t anything new--he’d always been lonely--but he’d felt it more keenly over the last couple weeks. Ever since seeing Tony again. When he wasn't with him, he felt the loneliness more. “I’m...tempted,” Steve said, closing his eyes. “I’ve been thinking about you all night.”
“Keep thinking about it.”
She put her hand against his cheek and held it there. He didn’t know how much she knew about his and Tony’s relationship. He hadn’t told her anything. If she knew anything, it came from Tony himself. And from mother’s intuition and her own eyes. Because they were searching his face now, probing out his secrets, making him feel raw and exposed, like a live wire.
Sarah kissed the top of his head and curled her arm around him, holding him just the way she had when he was a little boy. And maybe he should have felt strange letting her do that, but he didn’t. He loved that too. “Yes,” she said simply. “I had my man,” she said. “
“You’re such a dork,” Steve said.  “I can’t believe I just said you talk better than anybody.  You really know how to prove me wrong, don’t you?”
Steve grinned. “Nope.”
“He heard the rest of the story.  He asked Bruce a question.”
, and I just fucking froze.”
Steve’s laugh was small and surprised, but genuine.  “I think your ego could take it.”
“Still sulking?”
Tony snorted laughter through his nose. He couldn’t help it. He didn’t want to laugh, but
He went back to work, back to the stuff that made him feel older. That wasn’t such a bad thing. He didn’t have
They made him laugh.
Tony kissed his neck, relief and happiness rolling over him. “Yeah. I’d
Steve squeezed him tight and lowered his mouth to his. He brushed their lips together once, slowly and deliberately, then dropped his arms and stepped away. Tony huffed in protest and tried to grab onto him again. Steve evaded him and held his hand up. “Nope,” he said. “Not tonight.”
, I might be able to swing it, but-” he threw a hand out in Howard’s direction, gesturing at him sarcastically, “-well, I mean, come on. Look at you.”
. But he couldn’t help but think how much better it would be when Steve was here to share it with them. How much he could not wait to have them do that stuff together.
He was wearing old, faded jeans that hung dangerously low on his hips, and a t-shirt splattered with tiny droplets of paint. He was barefoot, of course, his toes curling a little on the drop-cloth he’d thrown on the floor. His hair fell over his brow. He had a brush stuck behind his ear. Tony had seen him concentrate before. Of course, he had. But never to this degree. His eyes bored like lasers into the canvas, his jaw clenched, his hands, steady and firm, not shaking, not quivering, barely even moving, just enough to add a touch of red here, the faintest blush of yellow there.
“I promise.”
Steve looked at his hands.  “Yeah.”
“Do we?”
!--but he felt too good.  Lazy and satisfied.  He’d finished himself off with Steve’s eyes, hot and intense, on him, and when it was over, he’d pulled Tony into his arms and kissed him deeply.  It had been quick and efficient and good, made better by the weight of Steve’s regard, and he still felt too mellow to fight.
“I knew you’d hate it,” Steve said, then shrugged.  “Nat likes it.”
“Do you agree?”
believe in Hell, and wasn’t suicide, to Catholics, right up there with murder and blasphemy?  To the religious, wasn’t it a combination of both?  If people were made in God’s image, wasn’t suicide like murdering God’s own form?
“Hey, there you are,” he said, his face brightening when he saw Tony.  “We were getting worried, right, cat?”
Tony gestured to him. “Come here,” he said, and Steve came to him. Tony took his hand. “Short and sweet,” he said easily. But he kept his sunglasses on. “Play nice with the other kids. Be in before dark. Early to bed, early to rise. All that shit.”
Tony cocked his head.  “I should probably kiss you now, shouldn’t I?”
“Good.”
Tony’s face grew harder. The mirror image grew clearer. “What, you won’t pay for it if I don’t stop seeing Steve? Is that what you’re saying?”
An almost insurmountable need to see her washed over him, but he fought it off.  Clint’s entire family was gone.  Nat was all he had left in this world.  Even if it hurt him, Steve understood.  His own loneliness was nothing new anyway.  It was like his shadow, dark, insubstantial, and constant.  He’d learned to live with it long ago.
Righteous anger bloomed in Tony’s chest.  “Don’t you dare talk to me about unethical.  You people are using a fucking parlor trick as treatment, and when you don’t have him performing like a show pony for all your doctor pals, you’re keeping him chained up like a goddamn rabid pit-bull.”
Steve didn’t come to the party.
“Yeah. That was okay.” He touched Tony’s bottom lip with one finger. “What do
Tony sighed and tugged his sleeve again. “It doesn’t mean anything to
“And you got your ego stroked.  It was an even trade.”
“It’s
“Promise you’ll be careful?” he asked.
Tony closed the front door gently and ran to the bedroom.  He scrounged a pair of jeans from the closet, then grabbed a t-shirt from the drawer.  Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Steve folded all Tony’s t-shirts so the design faced up.  Had he ever even noticed that until now?  God, he was amazing.  Tony found one shoe, but not the other.  He’d been a little frustrated the night before, and had no idea where he’d thrown the other one.
“Oh.”
“The Compound.”
“You’re not losing me,” Steve whispered. “I do love you.” He turned his head at Thad’s insistent urging, and kissed his mouth. Thad licked into him with a firm tongue, claiming him. Steve pulled back. “Do you love me?”
“Huh-uh.”
His hand was still clutching Steve’s. Steve turned it, lifted it to his lips and kissed it. “That’s a first.”
Tony ducked his head, rubbing his temples with the fingers of one hand.  It was ridiculous, thinking like that.  He knew it.  Whatever answers there were to those questions meant nothing now.
“You keep saying that.  But, damn, Steve, you’ve been here for years.  You’re not that different anymore.”
Steve smiled.  It was enigmatic, that smile, unlike any Tony had ever seen on his face.  “Was he?” he asked.
Howard frowned. “I’m sorry?”
America
Steve came closer and put his hand on Pietro’s hip. Pietro didn’t push him away, but he didn’t soften either. “I never wanted to hurt you,” Steve whispered. “That’s the last thing I wanted.”
“And five pairs of Jimmy Choos.”
When the door popped open, they walked inside.  At the reception desk, Wanda put the moves on the guard sitting there, a red, misty glow coming from her fingertips.  The guy barely had time to turn around before his eyes clouded and he slumped in his seat.
“I won’t let that happen.”
feeling--course through him again, fully and completely.
There was a weight on him now.  It wasn't much, just a little thing--a hand in his hair?--but it was there, and it was warm.  Good. So very, very good.
A brief image popped into his head.  He and Steve lying on a blanket outside.  Steve kissing him while Tony stroked him lazily, and all the while Bucky’s body lay decomposing under six inches of dirt behind the warehouse.
Steve put his hand over Tony’s mouth. “Okay, okay. I think I get the picture.”
Tony held the phone out to Sam again. “Are you sure you won’t…?”
“Fair enough,” Nat said and slipped her other arm around him, holding him protectively against her.
“Ross!” he shouted over them, and this time, they all turned.
“Maybe you should…” she began tentatively, but he shook his head.
Steve chuckled.  “I wish.”

"Then come with me," Tony said, but Steve shook his head.
The kid--Tony--laughed, taking the cuff link from Stane’s unresisting hand. “Whatever you say, Obie,” he said, and casually took Stane’s arm to fasten it in place himself. “You’re the boss.”
Steve tossed the shirt onto the foot of the bed then laid back down.  He reached for Tony.  His eyes were lit with a tiny smoldering ember deep down inside each one.  “Come here, Tony,” he said, and his voice was deeper, rougher with need.
“Umm...thank you…?”
“Call and regale us with Doctor Strange’s victorious use of

“Three o’clock, baby,” he said.  “Just like last time.”
Tenderness tugged at him again.  “Yeah.  We’re going home.”
Steve laughed again. “She said the same thing about you.”
Fuck you, Steve Rogers.
“I still kind of want to give you something.”
“Did you

“Thank you.”
Steve looked around.  Thor stood above him looking at Peggy over his shoulder.  “This is the one I’ve heard of, the woman you loved?”
“The bus broke down.”
“Mm-hmm.”
“Good for you, Stark.  Still got something going on upstairs.”
“Huh?”
Tony let his fingers wander back up Steve’s chest to touch the knot at his throat again. “Guess you better go.”
“Oh, sweetheart,” she said, and dropped her bag to take him into her arms.

"You just brought me flowers."
And that was when the world blew up.
showed up.”
Steve rolled his eyes heavenward, that grin getting even more sappy. Verging on dopey. “Tony.”
The chill night air enveloped him as he stepped out the door. He zipped his jacket up against it, and walked down the street a little ways. He wouldn’t go far. He didn’t want to walk out on Bucky without at least telling him first, but he needed air. And a cigarette. It had been too hot in there, especially after talking to Tony, then watching him dance with
One year.
Tony took his keys out of his pocket and seated it in the lock.  Steve stood beside him.  Tony could feel his eyes on him, the weight of them hot and heavy.  He turned the key, and the door opened.  A rush of warm air eddied around them, beckoning them inside.
“Yeah,” Steve answered. “I guess.”
Steve came last and hesitated outside the door, looking in.  His heart expanded at the sight of everyone inside and grieved for all those who should be here and were not.  That was mostly on him.  He’d known it since the moment the burner-cell vibrated in his pocket and Bruce’s scared voice spilled out the story of Thanos and what it meant for all of them.  He took a lot of the responsibility for the chasm that existed between one half of the team and the other.  He had been their leader, the one they looked to for a cool head and a clear-cut plan.  He had failed them.  He had failed them all.
“Nothing wrong with enjoying the scenery.”
Steve flushed red. As red as the tie that was coiled around his fist. Instead of throwing it aside when he stripped it from around Tony’s neck, it had ended up here. Tony wasn’t sure if Steve had done it on purpose, or if it had just been something that had happened in the heat of the moment while Steve writhed beneath him, lost in the sensation of Tony’s mouth on him, but either way, it had given him something to hold on to. And seeing it now, Tony felt a divine spike of covetous lust.

“It’s not your fault, honey.”
“That had to’ve been scary for you,” Steve said softly.
“You’re tired,” Tony insisted.  “Your hand could slip.”
“Hey, Stark,” Clint said as Tony came into the kitchen. Tony didn’t say anything--Steve was looking at him, smiling, preventing him from taking in any new breath. He couldn’t have said anything if he’d wanted to--but he squeezed Clint’s shoulder as he passed, earning him a raised eyebrow and a shake of his head. “Yeah,” Clint chuckled. “Good morning to you too.”
“When, during the war?  You went to France, didn’t you?”
. You’ll be okay.”
It was time. He was ready. By unspoken agreement, Steve had claimed the one by the bandstand. Nat’s eyes were trained on the other one by the window.

. We’re gross. Everybody hates us.”
Fury’s blazing eye softened.  Just a little, and he put a hand on the back of Steve’s neck.  Steve smiled his half-smile.  Fury turned back to Ross.
“It was pretty bad the other night,” Steve answered into Sam’s ear. “But Mrs. Perkins came up to sit with Mom and I went to a meeting. I’m okay.”
Steve sighed and looked at Tony.  “Back me up here.”
“I don’t doubt your Starkiness,” she said, “just your snarkiness.”
“Yup.”
seeing anyone.  You know, anyone special.”
Steve drew in a breath and tightened his own grip on Tony’s hand. “I want you to stay,” he said carefully. “I just don’t know how to ask without it sounding like I’m asking you to cheat on your wife.”

were okay, but he didn’t.
Tony kissed him.  Kissed his ear, his neck, tongued the divot at the base of his throat.  “Really,” he said between kisses.  “We’ll just start slow, okay?  See what you like.” He kissed his collarbone, first one side, then the other.
“You’re home,” he said between kisses. “You’re home, you’re home, you’re home.”
Steve took a stumbling step backward. “No,” he muttered. “No. Sorry. No. I’m okay.” He fumbled with the doorknob and opened the door. “I’m sorry, Ton-Jack.
He shrugged. “Don’t care. I’m staying.”
“Fair enough.”
Tony waved his hand dismissively. “Spare me the history lesson. Watch.”
There was a chair on the other side of the coffee table, and Tony perched on the edge. He watched Steve swirl his whiskey in his glass, the ice cubes chattering against each other. “Aren’t you going to ask me what I’m doing here?” he asked.
Tony nodded.  “I know.”
Steve shook his head slowly. “I-I can’t, Tony. I can’t do it that way.”
Tony smiled, but shook his head. “It’ll be okay,” he said. “It won’t be for long.”

“Sam-”
The screen on his tablet had gone dark.  Tony swiped it awake and searched his contacts.  He had Ross’ private email.  He had a lot of people’s private emails.  He’d told Steve once a long time ago, he was nosy and he liked to know things that were none of his business.  That trait came in handy sometimes.
,” Tony said.  He pushed past Wanda and opened the door.  Nat stood outside.  He pulled her into the room.  “Nat,” he babbled, “Nat, please talk some fucking sense into these people.”
“I’ve got just the thing,” Tony said.
She mounted the steps, her eyes never leaving his face, and knelt before him.  It seemed almost ecclesiastical, as though she were one of the pious seeking a god’s benediction.  She touched his hand, brought her fingertips to his cheek.
“Okay.”
Tony plucked it out of his lap and looked.  It was a sketch of the lake and their little scrap of beach, a suggestion of the trees and meadow.  The Bentley was off to the side, just beginning to take shape under Steve’s talented fingers.
Tony went to the side of the bed.  The right side, where he usually slept, then stopped.  What if Steve slept on the right side?  He should know this by now.
“Why would I sign something that stripped away so many of my rights?  Rights that
Natasha put her hand on his chest, feeling the racing tattoo of his heart beneath her palm.  His eyes were hard, his mouth a trembling bow.  She hadn’t seen him like this in a long time.  Not since Thanos and Japan.
Steve shrugged. “I just thought it was funny.”
“Hypnosis and light therapy,” she said.  “Interesting.  And this drug...oh wow.  Three years, you were developing that?"  She shook her head.  Her hair had gotten longer and she’d let the color grow out.  Blonde mixed with bright red.  Bruce liked it.  Liked the duality of the colors.  He said it reminded him of himself--Banner and the Hulk.  She’d slapped his arm and called him a sap.  But she hadn’t changed it.  “That’s crazy,” she murmured.
Tony jumped to his feet and left the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. A thing.”
Strange said nothing.
Tony clapped him on the shoulder.  “Relax, Steve, I was kidding.  I just love your righteous indignation.  It’s hot.”
“Jesus,” Tony muttered.
Bringing out the bold-type again...
“‘Nothing much’?” Tony repeated. “You’re so convincing. What’s going on?”
“Hey,” Clint said.  “You guys ready?  They’re waiting on you.  Well, us, I guess.”
Steve leaned his head back against Tony’s.  He
It was entirely different from his reunion with Natasha.  With her, it had been like he was falling into her, letting her catch him, letting her hold him and heal him.  The way he was with Wanda was nothing like that.  In Tony’s arms just now, Steve had been soft and pliant, taking comfort and care, but when he put his arms around the girl beside him, he seemed almost to swell.  He became larger, even to Tony’s eyes, harder, a protective barrier between her and the world.  Natasha had said Steve was like a father to Wanda, and Tony saw it now in full force.  The way he held her against his chest, letting her tuck her head under his chin, his jaw firm and strong, his eyes soft.  Tony had never experienced a fatherly hug, but this was one.  This was the epitome of one, and the slight jealousy he felt paled in comparison to the utter awe and pride he felt in Steve.
“It’s okay,” Steve said. “I’m glad you’re happy.”
He was still tall. Wearing a wool navy overcoat that hit him mid-thigh and just skimmed a body that was still well-muscled, but maybe a little thinner. The hair that used to be golden blonde was a little darker now, a little longer than Tony had ever seen it, touching the collar of his coat. He’d kept the beard, and even now, even in this cold, dreary, rainy afternoon, Tony longed to touch it. Longed to run his fingers over it.
He picked up a pennant from a Yankee game he’d went to with Tony.  Steve had been nervous to go because he’d thought somehow it would be different from before when he’d gone with his mom or Bucky.  Tony talked him into it.  He said he had to go because Tony didn’t want to go by himself and both Pepper and Rhodey were busy.
“Your call, soldier.”
Steve swallowed.  Sighed.  “You’re right.  I should have waited.”
Steve shifted the bag he was holding and lifted up a black cane.  “Well,
Sam nodded toward Steve. “You. Him. Before you guys got together he was always staring at you. I saw you looking at him too, but he was
. He felt it overwhelming him every second of every day, and double that amount whenever he was in Tony’s arms, and if Tony felt even a fraction of that, then Steve would count himself the luckiest man in the entire universe.
Strange let out a breath.  It didn’t seem as angry as Tony would have thought.  Maybe the idea of Steve up on his feet was just too good for all of them.
bitch."
The guy flapped a hand at the window. “Aw, New York’s full of ghosts.”
Steve looked at the ground, then back up at Tony. “You want me to live with you? For real?”
“Sam?”
Steve laughed again. “Okay.”
said. “Fuck you.”
Deep down, he was glad Steve had said that.  Deep down, he didn’t want that either.  He beckoned him forward.  “Come on.”
Bruce nodded.  “That’s right.”
That little smile again.  There and gone.  It reminded him achingly of Steve’s, and Tony thought of how the two of them mirrored each other’s habits now.  Steve and Bucky must have done the same.  He wondered which one that little half-smile had originally come from.
Tony had laughed bitterly, pressing his cheek into her shoulder and clutching her tightly. “Yeah. He’s stubborn, all right. But he’s nothing compared to my dad, Mrs. Rogers. Nothing. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. If he hadn’t met me...if we’d never…”
Tony let himself get pulled inside the door.  He was still speechless.  A thousand thoughts and questions whirled in his head.  He couldn’t pick one.  They all seemed just beyond his grasp.
“No.  I remember.”
Tony skimmed his hands down Steve’s torso, then back up again, smoothing along his shirt. His fingers worked one button open. He kissed the skin he’d uncovered. Flicked it with his tongue. “Well, I’m a pretty needy
Tony could hear movement in the bathroom now.  The water in the sink turning on and off.  The soft scrub of Steve’s toothbrush against his teeth.  The water again.  After that, it was quiet for a long time.  Tony thought he was probably shaving.  The police had taken his old straight razor as evidence that night so long ago now, and all that was in there was a disposable Bic he had picked up at the pharmacy during that all-too-brief month he had spent here between The Raft and the prison.  Tony had wondered if he would buy another straight razor.  He was better with it.  He’d used one for his whole life, but he’d made no attempt to get one in spite of the nicks he always ended up with when using the Bic.
“I’m sorry.”
Steve nodded. “Good,” he sighed, relieved. “That’s good. I was a little nervous about that. You know. ‘Cause...me and him.” He shrugged.
“But, yeah,” Tony went on.  “I’ll bet they do.  I
“What position would that be?”
Tony nodded.  "Sure.”
“Yeah.”
She frowned, but she did it. He knew she would. She was the best kid in the universe, after all.
Steve nodded.  He forgot about the gray hairs when Tony set a steady rhythm with his hand.  He forgot even more when Tony kissed every inch of his neck, his chest, when he sunk his teeth into Steve's right nipple, then sucked lightly.  "Yeah," Steve breathed. The situation was getting urgent again. He was glad. "Yeah, Tony, that's okay."
Tony's hand was wrapped around his own cock, stroking it, but not too fast.  He wanted this to go on for awhile. For as long as they could both hold out.  His eyes were closed, his teeth were closed as well, biting into his lower lip.  He was concentrating only on this, only on the mounting pleasure, the mounting heat between them.
“And I know what you mean,” he went on.  “Doctors.  Hospitals.  Asylums.  That’s what you do with crazy people, isn’t it?  First, you have them ‘talk to someone’, then you ‘put them somewhere’, then you forget them.  I’d rather die.”
that. Loved that Steve remembered his line.
“Not if I have anything to say about it,” he said softly, and squeezed his arm.
“I am.”
“Right. Who’s the other one? With the flag in the movie?”
“I don’t think so.” He touched the smooth surface of his skin, loving the broad expanse of his back. “
Both he and Rhodey looked at Steve.  He looked blandly back and shrugged.  “You heard him.”
“No,” Tony scoffed.  “I never brought anybody home, guy or girl, but she knew.  She didn’t care.”
“Yes,” John said, relaxing into his seat. “I do.”

. We’re your priority. Everything else comes after that. What we need comes first. We always come first.”
Steve came.
“You can help her.”  He glanced up, his tears still falling.  “Will you please help her?”
Tony looked at him, puzzled.  “You asked me to stay.”
“I’m just-” he began, then shook his head.
That alert feeling intensified, and Steve would not have been surprised to discover he was now standing at attention. His eyes dark, mouth firm, jaw clenching rhythmically. “What do you mean? He’s here. He has to be someone’s cargo.”

Vague.  Hazy.  Indistinct.
Steve nodded solemnly.  “Right.”
Steve shrugged, but it was far from casual. It seemed more like a jumpy tic of the shoulders, a jerk up and down. “I don’t know. I guess we should.”
“If you’d rather wait until I’m better, I’d understand.  I’ve slept on way worse than that couch.”
“That’s not true.”
“That doesn’t make it any easier,” Tony said, squeezing his hand. “Does it?”
He walked up to the door and touched the handle.  It was sun-warm and smooth in his hand.  He was certain when he pulled, the door would not open, but it did.  He crossed the lobby and stopped in front of the private elevator.  There were people around, but no one talked to him.  No one stopped him.
Thad looked at him, pierced him with his eyes. He was good at that. He had been from the beginning. It had been his eyes that first caught
Steve began to close the distance even more.  “And as per our agreement,” he said dangerously, “you are to stay away from Tony Stark.”
Steve’s eyes rolled heavenward, and he bit his lip.  His hands clenched into tight fists against his thighs.  It was a
Morgan smiled again. And Tony wiped his eyes again. She remembered. God. For some reason, he’d convinced himself she wouldn’t--because why would she? But she did. She did.
Tony's eyes widened slightly as the full weight of that statement sunk in. Three am.
“Oh my god, Steve.”
He answered the letters with ones of his own. Long, tortured, impassioned letters filled with the words and promises Tony had asked him for while they lay in his bed. Steve was no poet. The words came out in a jumble, with little regard for punctuation or sentence structure, but he knew Tony wouldn’t care. It didn’t matter. The words were what mattered. The feelings behind them were what mattered. For Tony and for himself. It just felt good to write them down. To give voice to the desperation in his heart.
Tony sighed. “She does.”
If I get inspired to write anything else in this verse, it will be as a separate story, so I don't leave you all hanging with a question-mark chapter count LOL! Thank you again for everything. I love you all!
He chuckled and the slight rift between them mended seamlessly. He found himself leaning a little closer to her side. Tony and Pepper were dancing now, and being with Nat soothed whatever pang of what?--jealousy? hurt?--that he felt almost completely.
“We can do it tomorrow.”
,” he sputtered.
Steve exhaled long and slow. “Fuck,” he muttered under his breath.
have to be diplomatic?” Steve purred into his ear. “Or can I just agree with you?”
His breath was hot in his throat.  That other voice had fallen silent.  The quiet in his head was bliss.  “What if I die first?” he asked, his voice cracking.
“Oh yeah,” Tony sighed.  “I do.”
“Would she have minded?  That I’m...that we…?”
“He’s in the bedroom.”  Then, in a tone that sounded slightly accusatory, “He seems upset.”
“Are you serious?” she asked, tears still falling rapidly. “You
“Goodnight, soldier.”
, he thought.
Jack put his hand in Steve’s hair, holding him in place. “That feels so good, baby,” he said softly.
“Our people?” Tony said, bitterly.  “Don’t you mean you’ll do whatever it takes to get
“Yes, you are.  You are good.  You’re the only good thing.”
“Morning,” he said, going to Tony’s side and kissing his shoulder.
“They’re nice.”
Steve saw something flit over Howard’s face, something he couldn’t quite name, but he didn’t look angry. “Perhaps I could entertain you,” he said, and Steve frowned deeper.
Tony put his glasses on and leaned closer.  “What the hell is this, Bruce?” he said.
Tony closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the cabinets.  Jeff had never met Steve, but he knew who he was.  Everyone in their little community knew who he was.  Not only had he once been Captain America, but he was Tony Stark’s lover.  That was news.  Especially in a town that small.
Rhodey’s eyes flicked between the two of them.  “This is weird.  What the hell’s going on?”
well, Tony,” he said.
“You were the one rubbing up against me,
“Jesus.  Just get out.”
Tony shrugged.  “Didn’t want to.”
And then she was sobbing into the phone. Steve held it to his ear, head in his hand, listening to her grief and fear, thinking if he had been doing his job and paying attention--leading his men instead of day-dreaming away in the distance like some fucking punk kid--he wouldn’t be making this call. No one would have to make this call. And if they had, it would have been
He climbed the stairs slowly. He wanted to sprint up them, but he was too tired. Three weeks of busting ass from dawn until dusk coupled with the last five hours of mind-numbing frustration had sapped the last of his strength. He smiled a little at that. The fact that he wasn’t a kid anymore. The fact that he was well on his way to middle-age. He was okay with that. In fact, he was kind of looking forward to it.
time sleeping. He let Steve sleep. It wasn’t very soundly, though. His muscles jumped beneath his skin. His brow contracted into a frown. He moaned. Muttered words Tony couldn’t quite understand. Tony put his lips against Steve’s ear and whispered, “Shh. It’s okay. It’s okay. I’m here,” and that seemed to soothe him a little. But not completely. His face never did lose that worried frown. His muscles never did stop twitching.
Nat arched her brow at both of them. “Somebody owes somebody an apology.”
“Good,” Tony said. He brushed Steve’s shoulder one more time. “Have fun with the ladies,” he said, then he picked up his coffee and left.
Steve held him tighter. “Where are you going?”
There was a soft thud, a whisper, then silence.
“I can’t,” he whispered.  “But, I’m gonna miss you.  Both of you.  Don’t forget me, okay?”
Ross laughed politely.  “I was thinking five years.”
So, he washed. He washed, and sometimes afterward, he would go outside and stand on the fire escape for a little while. He watched the people moving around below him, listened to the traffic and the sirens. And sometimes he wished he was down there. He
“Yeah.”
"Even when you're wrong."
Steve held him closer.  He had taken a lot of comfort from Tony, but he repaid it during moments like this.  Steve was thinner now, but no less warm, no less strong and protective, and for Tony, his arms meant safety.  His arms meant security.  His arms were the place where Tony felt most vulnerable, and yet they were also the place in which he felt the need to shower Steve with warmth and peace and gratitude of his own.  Was that the essence of true love?  That wanting to take and take, yet needing to give?  Greediness and generosity all rolled into one.  Tony had certainly  never felt anything like it with anyone else.  Never wanted to feel it with anyone else.  Never.
“Did I say something?”
Tony didn’t know how long he kept him there like that. He knew he got close to the edge a few times, and then Steve would back away, silently nuzzling his thighs or his stomach until Tony got himself under control before drawing him slowly back into his mouth. At some point, he heard the faint but distinct sound of the cap on the bottle of lube being opened, and then a cool finger against him, circling softly before slipping inside, and Tony cried out, unable to help himself, and not really wanting to because he had never been able to do that before. Not with Steve. Not with Mrs. Perkins always in the apartment below them listening with her no-doubt keen ears.
He tried to beg off on the sex.  Gina was insistent.  He said he was coming down with something.  She said she was going down on something.  He said he’d feel better tomorrow.  She said he certainly would, it was her personal guarantee.  He said, no, really, he wasn’t up for it.  She said he would be, all he had to do was let her…
Tony snorted laughter.  “You mean the guy-thing?”
--was here right now. The part that would always be a six-year-old kid, waking up scared from a nightmare, wanting to go and climb up into his daddy’s bed and lie beside him all night, where he would feel protected. Safe. That part of him loved this. That part of him wanted to believe this was real.
At last, it was just Steve and Clint left.  Clint fiddled with the saltshaker, spilling a few grains onto the table.  He traced a finger through them.
.” He slipped his hand further up Steve’s arm, pulling him closer. “I didn’t really try that hard.” He brushed his lips lightly against Steve’s jaw. “Not once that
Tony came closer. “Talk to me.”
, Tony,” he said. “Of course it matters with you. You’re different. This...
“Shh.”
“‘Kay. Gotta pee?”
And as if to prove that, Tony’s hand was back in Steve’s hair, petting it with tender little strokes. Steve moved his head, trying to nuzzle into the cup of his palm. Tony indulged him for a moment, allowing Steve to rub his cheek against his fingers, kiss the slight indent of his heart and life lines.
them,” he emphasized. “I didn’t say I used them.” Steve finished his drink and put the glass on the table. He didn’t refill it. He just leaned back again, stretching his arms along the back of the couch. His sweater pulled taut against the outline of his chest, and Tony felt his stomach do a little flip-flop in his gut. Funny. It hadn’t done that in a long time. He’d almost thought he was too old for that sort of thing. Guess not.
“Stay close, peanut,” he said, and she yelled back a loud, “‘Kay!” then went back to chasing sunbeams.
FRIDAY had commandeered Ross’ security systems, and now used them to project Doctor Baxter’s files up in the air.  She scrolled through them, letting the words move.  Tony watched Ross’ face, watched his peculiar brand of non-reaction.
They went to the movies. Just like they did almost every Sunday. Steve bought his customary popcorn and frozen Junior Mints. Tony, also customarily, insisted he didn’t want anything, then proceeded to decimate all of Steve’s snacks by the end of the coming attractions. Halfway through, Steve went back out to the lobby and bought another round. Again, that was customary. Once, he had tried buying two boxes first thing and just hanging onto one of them until the first run out, but Tony was pissed. They were no longer frozen, and who the
“And you’re supposed to be brave,”  Tony said softly.  “Aren’t you?  Isn’t that part of the whole super-soldier thing?  Bravery?”  He was teasing again, his voice said so, but underneath it, Steve sensed a deadly seriousness.  He’d seen this behavior before during missions, but to have it directed at him now when it was just the two of them alone in a room locked against any intruders took Steve’s breath away.  He was nervous, but he had never been more aware of his own physicality.  The fact that he was both bigger and stronger than Tony, the fact that he could do whatever he wanted to him, was very much on his mind, but Tony wanted control.  That was obvious.  Steve let him have it.  For the moment, at least, Steve let him have it.
ill.  He shook his head.  “I don’t want to kill you.”
“Morning, Mom.”
See? I warned you about the cheese-factor! XD  Oh well. I like cheese.
. He’d ran through all the scenarios in his mind, rolling them over and over for hours. Even Steve had noticed how preoccupied he’d been. He’d asked him if he was feeling alright when he didn’t make a third cup of coffee that morning.
She sighed and squeezed his hand.  “I know.”
He hadn’t seen him yet, Tony was sure, and he used the opportunity to look him over while his eyes were closed.  He was thinner.  Even through the old leather jacket--
“Don’t get shy on me now, Steve,” Tony said, and closed the distance between them, draping himself over Steve’s chest, throwing his leg over Steve’s leg.  “Better?”
“I’ll take care of it.”
But, if he didn’t, it was okay. He really was tired. They could do it another night.
He hugged her, smiling into her shoulder. “I always knew I had the best mom.”
“Hey!  Mr. Stark, Mr. Stark!”
Something flashed in Ross’ eyes, and he eased the gun from under his pillow.
“No,” Tony said immediately, putting his hand on Steve’s arm.  “No.  Stay.”
Steve shook his head. Not saying no, just shaking his head. He looked down at his hands, then back up at Bucky. “Yeah,” he said. “I think so, anyway.” He shrugged and smiled. “I’d better be, ‘cause I’m doing it.”
The work helped. It usually did.
“I honestly don’t know why I bother with you at all, sometimes.”
Tony sat down at the small table and looked around the room.  Most of the tables were occupied, the prisoners conspicuous in their tan khaki prison jump-suits, blotches of boring against their visitors’ more colorful attire.  Tony hadn’t been sure what to wear, and had settled on jeans and a plain black Henley.  He’d been forced to strip off his watch--a Rolex Daytona that had set him back $75,000--and leave it, his keys to the ‘Cuda, and his wallet at the guard station.  They had then searched him, and asked intimate, probing questions about the arc reactor for twenty minutes before they finally decided it was alright and he could go in.  That made him late.  Thirty damn minutes late.  Tony prayed they had told Steve.  That he didn’t just think Tony had been late on purpose, or worse, that he’d decided not to show.  He couldn’t stand the thought of that.  Of the look on Steve’s face while he waited and waited and no one came.  Tony vowed to write a strongly-worded letter to the prison commissioner about the efficacy of their visitors’ policies.
He lay back, panting, exhaustion etched on his face.  “I’m not going to make it, am I?”
“Uh--”
Sam rolled his eyes. “‘A little’, Steve? God.” He shook his head, and gestured down the hallway. “Go to the art room sometime,” he said to Tony. “Ms. Carter has his stuff plastered all over the walls. He’s like a superhero down there.”
She smiled, her red lips curving in a way that always made him a little weak.  “They’re honoring you,” she said.
Steve looked at the floor, scuffed it with the toe of his shoe.
“Yeah.  I knew it when I signed.  I just thought I’d have time to figure it out.  Fix it before it became an issue.”
“Then go. I’ll handle this.”
“What if I can’t be sorted?  What if it just gets worse?”
He checked his messages, and this time, he listened to them. One was the standard update he received every morning, but the other was all about this current situation. This situation with the kid. With Tony.
“I’m sorry,” he muttered, his head down, voice cracking with a storm of useless emotion.  “Tony, I’m sorry, I--fuck, I can’t, I’m sorry.”
“Your friend--Carol, is it?--let me in,” he said, coming across the patio toward Tony. He was wearing a suit. Of course he was. Even on a warm California night, Howard Stark would wear a three-piece suit. He’d probably wear one when he was dancing with the devil or playing poker with the angels in heaven.
Steve shrugged. “Pretty sure he does. He was right there.”
“Fine.  Have it your way.  As usual.”
Tony shook his head. “Nothing. Just thinking about Mrs. Perkins.”
Tony stood at the top of that grassy little hill where he’d knelt with Steve’s head in his lap so long ago now.
Clint stood up, “Wanna go get this over with?”
“I don’t want to say its name.”
He got a cab, and gave the driver his address. All through the drive, he found himself mumbling a prayer to St. Christopher--one he was certain he had forgotten up until that very moment--for safe travels. About halfway home, the driver, an older woman with short, iron-gray hair, met his eyes in the rearview mirror and joined in. Steve blushed a little, but spoke louder, and they prayed together the rest of the way. He was shocked and almost embarrassed by how much it helped calm him down.
Tony would never say something that was not the truth. Especially when they were like this. Alone together like this. Here there were no lies. Here they were immune to anything like that. Anything that might harm them. Here--alone, just the two of them--was their safe space. Their sanctuary. That was what Steve believed, anyway, and he prayed Tony felt the same way.
They did it in September, nine months after Bucky lost his arm.
, for god’s sake.  Where were the callouses?  Where was the menthol scent of cheap shaving lotion?  Where were the ocean blue eyes that should be looking at him from under sooty lashes set into pale-as-cream skin?
“Hello, Mr. Stark.”
I wouldn’t!”
worried about it?”
“You do?  Really?”
“Yeah,” Tony called back.  “I said…” His mind whirled like a dervish, trying witty answers and discarding them like a Las Vegas dealer shuffling a poker deck.  “Double-fuck.”
She looked up into a blameless blue sky that was no match for Steve’s eyes, looking for Tony, begging him to hurry, all the while wondering if it might be better--easier--if he was too late.  She hated herself for it, but couldn’t help it.
“I’m clean,” Tony said, watching Steve yank his own jeans off. “I got tested again a couple weeks ago, but-”
“I thought you were great,” Steve said suddenly.
What could happen in that short amount of time?
He wasn’t shouting. He wasn’t. He knew he wasn’t. But, in his head, it sort of
“I won’t care then, either.”
Tony would run, but he didn’t know, and he didn’t want to take the chance of losing him just when things were getting so good.
“No,” Steve said.  It seemed very loud in the quiet lab.  Tony looked at him, surprised.  Steve looked back.  “No, FRIDAY, don’t,” he went on.  “Please.  Keep it as Tony.”
There was a beat of silence where they just looked at each other, and then Tony’s eyes grew wide, filled with a wild intensity, and he threw an arm around Steve’s neck and yanked him roughly down on top of him. “Jesus,” he said, hugging him dangerously tight. “Jesus Christ. Steve. What the fuck? When did you get here?”
Steve watched him go. Watched him walk to the car, watched him climb inside, watched through the window--even though he couldn’t see through the tint--watched as the taillights flared, then watched as the car pulled away, down the street, dragging its shadow behind it. He watched. He watched until it was gone, then he wiped his eyes, thinking of the feeling of Tony’s lips pressed against his. The feel of Tony’s fingers entwined with his. Thinking of how good that had felt. Thinking that he wished he could have done it again before he left.
He nodded.  “For real.”
Steve hesitated. He didn’t want to go. That was painfully obvious. He wanted to stay here. He wanted to be the one in that big bed with Tony. He wanted to be the one Tony snuggled up with tonight. It was as plain on his face as anything Tony had ever seen in his entire life, and Tony felt the beginnings of worry, of uncertainty rise up in his chest.
name him anything.  He named himself.  As soon as I saw him, I knew what his name was.  And number two:  Sir Purrari Stark-Rogers is the most awesome name in the history of names.”
Steve nodded. “Yeah,” he breathed, and his lips brushed the skin of Tony’s throat. “Yeah. We do.
man. He isn’t your match.” She touched his cheek. “He never was, honey.”
fix it.”
Steve stayed silent, but shook his head the tiniest bit.
“Pennsylvania.”
“Damn. You’re getting pretty possessive, Stark.”
Unable to contain himself anymore, he had said, “Well?”
Tony sighed.  “Oh yeah, I remember that guy,” he said.  “He was brutally hot.”  Steve looked back at him.  Tony shrugged.  “But he was kind of a dick.”
“Hey, you.”
“Baby,” Tony whispered, and rubbed his cheek against his own shoulder to wipe away the tear that had escaped his lashes.
Which one had comforted him when he had nightmares?  Which one had made his tea with lemon and sugar instead of honey because I-don’t-like-honey-Tony-I’ve-told-you-a-hundred-times?  Which one did he lie on the deck with and watch the stars, listening with a faraway expression while they explained the constellations to him?  Did he take their hand and raise it to his lips like he’d done with Tony?  Did he put his head in their lap while they watched tv?  Did he breathe their name in the cool watches of the night as they made love?
One more.
Steve laughed again.  “I thought you would have cancelled that.”
“You’re a dick, Thad.”
Steve lifted his head and Tony kissed him.  “You take such good care of me,” Steve whispered.  “I don’t know how I got so lucky.”
Just Tony.
They had, actually, that morning.  Pepper wanted Tony to go on a two-week business trip to London.  Tony didn't want to go. Steve told him he should.
Steve looked at him, those eyes so dangerous, so innocent, the juxtaposition between the two making him dizzy with mad desire and a wild need to protect him.
“But, Daddy…”
“Did I interrupt you?” Tony nodded at Steve’s pocket where he’d stowed his phone. “That wasn’t your girlfriend, was it?”
Tony squeezed his hand. “Hey.”
"Do you?  'Cause some of the things I say…" he paused, shook his head without lifting it, "I'm a real dick sometimes."
Tony listened patiently while the guy threw up excuses.  “Yeah,” he said, “I know it’s far away, I timed it to the minute.”  A pause while the guy spoke, then Tony again, placating and warm, “I’ll pay for the gas.”  Pause.  “Cold pizza never hurt anybody.”
"Whose idea was this bridal-carry over the threshold, anyway?"
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Clint told you he liked your beard,” Tony went on.  “Are you going to hook up with him, too?”
“Yes,” Tony said. He raised one hand and knotted it gently in Steve’s hair. “But I want to hear it from you. I like your voice better.”
blood.  And that’s worth a hell of a lot more than five million dollars.”
still asleep.  “Yeah.  Look, go around to the garage, okay?  I’ll just slip into something a little less comfortable, and I’ll be right there.”
He did. Or, at least his brain did. “Am I?”
“I know, baby.  Me neither.”
Not just any suit. One that Tony had helped him pick out then had tailored to fit him with perfect, graceful ease. Steve had tried to tell him he didn’t need a suit, but Tony had insisted. He’d only seen him wear it once, to a luncheon with the Governor, and seeing him in it now was just the extra punch to the heart he needed. If he hadn’t been head-over-heels in disastrous love with Steve Rogers before, he certainly was now. Especially when he glanced at the counter next to Steve and saw his own chipped mug filled to the brim with steaming coffee next to Steve’s glass of orange juice.
And it was fine.  Not perfect, maybe, not hot and sweet and passionate, but fine.  Had it always just been fine, or was it just because his mind was cross-referencing now?  Before, he had actively tried to not make comparisons, but now, suddenly, he was thinking that her hands were too soft.  Her hair smelled like coconuts.  Her eyes were hazel.
Tony leaned forward and touched his face.  It was impossibly smooth, impossibly soft.  “There’s my man,” he murmured.  “I missed that face.”
Tony took him by the hand and led him there. They lay together for a long time before Steve fell asleep again. In fact, lying with Tony curled up on his chest, the radio on, breeze coming through the open window, it was a wonder he stayed awake as long as he did.
Steve kissed the back of Tony’s neck. “Still worried.”
"Yeah," Steve said, and turned the key in the lock.  The door opened, and he stepped over the threshold, his whole life resting in his arms.  "Yeah, I do."
Why did the last one seem the most plausible?
Tony’s fingers stopped moving.
much.  "Yeah," he said with great patience, "but what
Steve got to his feet, and now he could see what had happened. Sergeant Rogers could see what had happened. He could see where the IED had been, could see with his battlefield eye that someone--Jonathon, my god was that
Tony grinned.  “Bold of you to doubt a Stark.”
“He came to me,
Tony grinned. “Oh. Right. Fuck the breadcrumbs then. Just get some neon spray-paint.”
It took an hour to get there.  If Steve had been feigning sleep when they first started out, he wasn’t pretending anymore.  Despite his nap on the plane, Steve was once again deeply asleep as Tony pulled into the driveway.  He hadn’t been able to help himself, and on one particularly lonely stretch of the road, had let her run just a little.  He punched the gas, Steve sleeping peacefully beside him, and let her out until the red needle stood at 100 MPH.  She didn’t even shudder.  Tony brought her back down.  He didn’t know the road, it was dark, and Captain Stubborn wasn’t buckled in.  But the exilheration stayed.  He adored flying in the suit, but there really was nothing like driving a beautiful car.  You could get drunk off that.  He looked at Steve, the way his head was tipped to the side, exposing his neck.  You could get drunk off
“I don’t know.  I’ve seen jealous-face before.  This looks like that.”
Tony arched his back, increasing the pressure, and dug his fingers into Steve’s back.  “I want to feel you, baby,” he said.  “Come on.  Please.”
“He’s not the jealous type.”
“That’s right.”
,” Steve said. “‘Everyone should have a cell phone.’ You didn’t put a date-stamp on it. You said everyone.”
Tony knew a command when he heard it.  Especially when it came from that mouth.  He’d heard enough of them over the years.  And if he was being honest with himself, it sounded almost good.  Like old times.  Iron Man and Captain America instead of Tony and Steve.  It was almost nostalgic.  Like hearing a song on the radio that took him back to a different time  A time when he was a different person.  He didn’t want to go back there, but it was nice to remember what it was like, if only for a moment.  What they had been like.  It made him appreciate today all the more.
, he thought.
Steve knew what he needed to do.
Steve smiled a little.  “I kinda like this jealous side of you.”
“I’m okay, Mom.”
Steve shrugged and brought a hand up to his own cheek, brushing it across his beard uncertainly.
“I don’t know,” he answered, openly stroking his cheek now.  Tony’s fingers traced from just under Steve’s ear, down his cheek to his chin, then switched to the other side and let them follow the same path.  “Seems like someone promised they’d do something tonight.”
“Nothing,” Steve answered, and he smiled when he saw that Tony understood what he meant. Not actually nothing.
“Hi,” Steve said. His hands were on Tony’s ass now, openly groping him and not giving one single fuck. He trailed hot kisses down his neck, then back up to his mouth, finding Tony’s tongue with his own, and letting them move together in that familiar, hungry way they had done for years.
“Yeah,” he said softly. “I’m good. Better than good.”
Steve closed his eyes and leaned his head back against Tony’s stomach.  “Then why do I have to write this?”
Ross held his hand out over the table.
Steve rolled his head until his lips found the soft skin of Tony’s neck.  He kissed him once--or twice.  “Don’t worry,” he said.
“Might as well.  But I'll start going out more, too.  In the daylight.”
Tony shook his head. He could wait for Steve to tell him. He'd be there if and when he was. Tony was sure he could coax it out of him, but that would make him no better than the other people who simply took instead of waiting to be given. He wouldn’t do that. He would never do that. Steve deserved so much better than that. So much.
Howard shook his head. “He doesn’t know.”
get pictures?” Tony asked, and Steve laughed again. That lightness he’d felt while Tony was inside him was still there. Stronger. And god, it just made him feel so good. So
After Happy got his revenge, Tony climbed out of the pool and fell, dripping and exhausted, onto a lounge chair. It was starting to get calmer, everybody either pairing off or sitting in groups chatting quietly. The sun had gone down and the party lanterns cast multi-hued lights onto the mirror surface of the water. It was beautiful. Like looking at a candle through a crystal or existing inside a prism.
“Tony,” Steve whispered urgently.
“What did you want me to do?” Steve asked.  “I wasn’t going to ask Shuri.  She’s just a kid!”
“I don’t want to go,” Steve whispered.
“Are you?”
“Getting ready,” Tony snapped. “God, if I’d known this was how this call was going to go down, I would have put on something a little sexier than Batman pajama bottoms and an old t-shirt.”
“Oh,” Tony laughed, “yes, you do.  And they’re lethal, baby, let me tell you.”
And so what, if that kid looked pretty good? Even from this high up?
them. And not entirely out of selfish reasons. Although he would be lying if he said it didn’t make it easier for Steve to try and let himself be happy, knowing they were too.
“Fine.  Tomorrow I’ll go kiss her myself.”
Steve thought of that night on Clint’s farm with Tony.  He thought of Tony telling him Erskine and Howard were dead.  He thought of the little surge of freedom he’d felt at the thought.  He thought of the words Tony had said, the words that had both absolved Steve and made him fall in love.  He said them to Natasha now.
“He went through a phase of painting refracted light,” Sam said, and they all fell naturally into step again. Steve in the middle, Sam and Tony to either side. “Those are my favorites.”
He breathed in then out, forcing himself to relax.  “I’m trying.”
he was seeing Pepper here in gray sweat pants and an ill-fitting t-shirt with no make-up and her red hair in a simple ponytail just to fuck with him.  Strange would do something like that.  Of course, he would.
Tony disentangled himself from Peter again.  “Happy?  What the hell?”
Steve flushed at that and dropped his head into his hand.  His long fingers rubbed at his temples.  “That’s not what I meant,” he said gruffly.
The image of Peter sitting on the old leather sofa talking about sugarplums was half-formed in the back of his mind when he saw someone there, standing at the window, hands shoved deep in his pockets, looking down at the city.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve fell back a step. It almost felt like Tony had punched him in the face. “Oh,” he muttered. “Oh. Okay. Okay. Sorry.” He blinked, kept his head down, then shrugged past Tony and down the hall.
“I came to bring you home.”
“Always with the wit,” he said, and it was as if Steve had spoken through him.  Tony closed his eyes and swallowed.  There seemed to be another lump in his throat.
“What is it about him that you hate so much?” Tony threw back, thinking of Steve, thinking of when he’d asked Tony that question himself.
At four a.m., Steve slipped out of the bed.  Tony stirred, then was still again.  Steve limped into the bathroom, the clothing Tony had helped him shed held in his arms.  He turned the shower on and washed his hair, washed his hands, washed the residue of their release off his stomach, then just stood under that familiar spray.  He’d stood in here a thousand times while he’d lived here.  Once, twice, sometimes, when he was sad, up to five times a day, just standing there with the lights off, letting the warm wetness wash over him.  It was safe in here.  Calming.  At the time, it had been the safest place in the world.
He came up out of sleep a few hours later.  He squinted his eyes and looked at his watch.  12:01.  Christmas was over.  That was a relief, too.
Steve swallowed. “She’s sick.” His lip started to tremble, and when he looked at Tony at last, large tears over-spilled his lashes. “Tony,” he whispered miserably. “Tony, she’s sick.”
“You couldn’t have come to my office?”
So, nothing, really.
time. A lot had happened since then. A lot had changed. But not Mrs. Perkins’s door. That was the same. Her doormat still outside.
Tony’s fingers caressed his lips, and he opened them eagerly to welcome them inside. Tony laughed indulgently under his breath while Steve suckled his fingers with a greedy intensity. “Mmm. This is nice,” Tony mused. “Maybe this is enough, huh, baby?” His other hand stole into Steve’s blond hair and stroked it gently. “Maybe I don’t need anything else. Maybe-”
Steve looked up and everything else fell away, relief and happiness compounded on his face the second Tony was in front of him. “Hey. There you are.”
Tony held out the bouquet of flowers he’d run out and bought after his nap. “For you,” he said, and it sounded silly in his head, but Steve’s happy smile settled him even further.
“God,” Tony groaned, dragging the word out until it felt like three or four syllabels instead of one.  “You’re lucky this chair is comfortable.”
“Do you wanna go in?” he asked. “Or just sit out here for a little while?”
Tony thought.
Steve let out a breath and smiled. It was small and tired, but Tony wouldn’t trade it for anything in the entire world. Steve nodded.
, Tony thought.
“Sure, we do,” Clint said. “All in favor of adding a pool?”
“You’re welcome.”
“It won’t be long.  Just hold on, okay?  I know it’s hard.  I wish I could make it easier, but just hold on.”

Howard raised an eyebrow, and Tony’s stomach clenched. That look was too familiar. He had seen it too many times. Including in the mirror. “You’d better shut your mouth, son. Right now. You’re skating on thin ice.”
it. “If you don’t want to, it’s okay. We don’t know each other at all. I get it. I could just be some freak. We’ve all gotta be careful. But,” Steve started to move his thumb against Jack’s waist. It still felt weird. Almost like he was
Steve shook his head, embarrassed.  “It’s nothing.  Just a doodle.”
“Boss?”

Not tonight. The moment was gone.
“That you only had him for a few months.”
“Are you
He scowled, though, trying to look mad and failing miserably. “Real funny, guys. Thanks for your support.”
“Thanks. We’ll be up when he’s ready.”
Tony had wondered if Strange would dress down or be in full Sorcerer Supreme regalia, Cloak and all, but he was just wearing jeans and another hoodie.  He loved his hoodies, did Doctor Strange.  Tony thought, knowing him, the effect was more pretentious than casual, but he supposed to the basic passer-by, he would appear just a normal guy doing normal-guy things.  Tony wondered if it was Strange’s attempt at a disguise.
The air in the car felt very heavy, that funny
She lay on her back, his forearm pressed firmly against her throat, pinning her in place.  She tapped his shoulder twice, quick and light, and he let up immediately.  He stood and held out his hand.  She took it and let him pull her to her feet.
They came into the kitchen in singles and pairs and took their places around the room.  Thor got there first with Bruce and Rocket.  They did not have a fatted calf, but they cooked a mound of eggs, a mountain of bacon, and dozens of pancakes.  Bruce brewed tea, and Rocket started coffee, a chore he had become very good at, much to Tony’s delight.
“I remember,” Tony said.
Steve slid into him with long, slow thrusts, that were agonizingly good, hitting his prostate with unerring accuracy.  He was sweating, his skin golden and shimmery in the lamp-light.
"Let me see.”
Steve sighed.  “Hi, cat.”
“I’ve got everything,” Tony coaxed.
break down and give him a treat. He couldn’t bear the sad eyes Dodger kept giving him over the empty bowl.
“For a change,” Tony said, the words out of his mouth before he could stop them, barely before they were formed in his head.
do it.  I’ll take it in the morning on my way to work.”
Tony shrugged, all feigned nonchalance.  “Stick around.  I’ll take you.”
Tony reached over and took Steve’s arm.  “Wake up, soldier,” he said, and this time, Steve roused almost immediately.
“Are you sure?” Tony asked.  “And if you say ‘It’s okay’ again I’m going to strangle you.”
As if only waiting for the command, Steve bent his head, capturing Tony’s mouth with his own. He worked the knot with dexterous ease and slid the tie from around Tony’s neck just as they reached the bed and tumbled down onto it. Steve punched out a breath as Tony fell on top of him, but it was okay because Tony’s mouth was there. Tony was breathing into him, giving him his own breath even while stealing more, a delicious give and take that grew more heated as Tony rolled his hips against Steve’s.
Steve heated up his dinner in the microwave--meatloaf and mashed potatoes--and scarfed it down while standing over the sink. His mom wouldn’t have liked that, would have wanted him to at least sit down at the table, but she wasn’t here, and what she didn’t know wouldn’t hurt her. Besides, this way, he didn’t have to wipe down the table again. All he had to do was give his plate a quick wash, rinse the crumbs down the drain, and he was done. Easy as pie.
“Well,” Tony drawled, “you may have said that other word, that ‘s’ word, but I knew what you meant.”
“Oh. That’s...too bad.”
“Tahiti, Tony?  Really?  This is Steve we’re talking about, not Ben Affleck.”
Tony offered to buy the new ones Ray wanted and Jeff said a hard “No”.  He said Tony spent too much on them already.  Ray agreed with that, and thought they could have some kind of fundraiser for the new ones.  Tony thought that might be kind of fun.
“Thanks, Mrs. Rogers,” Tony said. She held him at arms’ length, then drew him close and kissed his cheek.
something.”
He looked up, and even though he was trying to keep his anger in check, he could feel it bubbling under the surface like lava, getting ready to explode.  “And I’m not exactly thrilled to hear my best friend and my boyfriend have been talking about me behind my back.  That smacks of betrayal, Steve.”
The thought was a nice one.  A picnic lunch in the middle of nowhere.  Complete isolation.  They could even have sex out here.  The chance of anyone coming upon them was pretty small, and the thought of Steve sliding into him out here was pretty good.  But there was this to get through first.  This secret meeting in the shadows with a ghost.
“Oh no, baby, I
Steve looked at him for a moment longer, then shook his head. “You don’t owe me anything, Tony.”
It's the last night before the end...
He nodded.  “Okay.  You don’t disgust me”
kids, too.”
Steve let himself think about that for a few seconds. Tony beneath him. Or maybe on top of him. Riding his cock, biting at his lips, sucking his tongue, skin hot and slick, moaning in the back of his throat like he did when it was really,
--but I wanted to show you I’m trying. Especially now.”
Rhodey stared hard at Steve.  “You’re looking a little flushed, Cap.”
“Stark.  Anthony, Edward.  Access Code 111-A.  Complete deactivation sequence.”
“Yeah.  Of course, I have.”
“Coming right up.”
Steve rolled his eyes again and opened the paper.
Steve sat back in his seat. The frown stayed on his face. Of all the things that he had expected to come out of Howard Stark’s mouth during this little chat, this had not even cracked the top one hundred. “Um. Okay,” he said. And that was all. His mouth would not cooperate with his brain. He remembered the feeling. He’d had it before, his brain and his body being incommunicado, and here it was again.
know. For sure. He’d thought of that face, that smile, that olive skin, those dark, dark eyes at least once a week--once a day--for the last six years.
“Well?” he asked.  “Do I pass muster, Sarge?”
in love. Since they’d broken each other’s hearts.
“He didn’t fall.  He slid out onto the ground.”
“I don’t have any magazine subscriptions.”
call you sir?”
Nick answered on the first ring. “Are you okay?”
Tony was in awe of him, pride bursting out of every pore.  Six weeks.  Six fucking weeks.  He’d been almost literally torn in two, organs rearranged and ruptured, spine a litter of bone fragments.  He’d died,
Tony watched him coming now. There was no jog in his step, though. Just a head-down trudge, like he was on his way to the executioner’s chair instead of school, and he never saw Tony at all. Never saw the way his eyes followed him, eyes filled with longing and sadness. Steve kept his own eyes on his shoes, just putting one foot in front of the other, his bag slung over his shoulder. He made his way over to one of the benches, tossed his bag down, took out a book, and started to read. His hair glinted gold in the morning sun. Tony could see it from here. See the way it lit it up, making it glow from the inside like a secret fire. He wanted to run his fingers through it. He knew what it felt like, how soft and silky it was, and he wished with everything he had that he could just go do it again right this very second.
It happens entirely by accident.
Steve’s already noted, throughout the course of the recounts, how easy everyone appears to be with each other, body language relaxed and trusting.
, why is he so angry over the idea that the AI tampered with it, is using it, he's not Tony but he's as close to Tony as it gets-
The voice is close now, whispering in a panicked way as gentle fingers smooth his brow, and he tries his best to follow instructions, tries not to shift again.
Steve sighs, and looks up at the ceiling. “None of this is coming out correctly.”
” Steve continues exasperatedly. “and I was
They stare at the TV for a while in silence before Clint continues quietly.
Well. Maybe...an absence of cold.
Morgan gasps in that overly dramatic way that five year olds do. “Am not!” she yells, bouncing a bit from where she’s situated in Steve’s arms. He quickly puts a hand on her back so he doesn’t drop her. “I’m the tiniest person there is, so you can carry me forever and ever and ever and ever!”
“Oh here.” Peter says, as he finally stops on a page of questions. “The homework sections said to do 8.3 to 8.6…”
Steve laughs and rolls his eyes, deciding it’s best not to mention that he purposely stepped into her trajectory to shield Wanda and Scott.
“Yeah, totally. I won’t try to convince you to make more because that’s 100% your call, but yeah, you did amazing. You have a beautiful voice Tony, and the emotions you showed in that video were spot on. I almost believed you were Aaron Burr for a second.”
Bucky and Sam’s aren’t too far away from Natasha, and he manages to speak to Bucky’s statue a bit this time, once he gets over the shock of it, voice hoarse. He talks to Sam as well, doubles back to Natasha to talk to her too, because if she had still been here, still been warm and speaking, she would’ve kicked his ass if he had ignored her.
Steve's sure he's imagining it, but he gets colder with each step he takes away from him.

There’s a sharp crack of sound, Steve registers it distantly as he swims in and out of consciousness and he’s still falling and then quite unexpectedly-
Plus things are. Kinda awkward now.
Steve flinches, anguished even though it's just a suit, and turns away.
“He probably just forgot to change it,” Steve mutters to himself quietly. Clint snorts.
“No.” Tony responds automatically, tapping away at his tablet.
qualified person to ask, especially in his current frazzled state of mind, but he frowns a bit anyways, thinking.
“Close the windows, I’m gonna do some night gardening.” She says and Tony and Steve burst into laugh-laced protests with Tony darting forward and clinging to Natasha’s left arm with loud declarations that she doesn’t love them, and Steve grabbing onto her right arm and tugging her back from the door. Between the two of them, they finally managing to drag her back to the couch, where they end up having a movie marathon with popcorn and hot chocolate.
You can probably tell from my spelling of armour that I'm just very very Canadian, so please just ignore it and enjoy the story :)))
Steve sat there in silence, stunned. Clint gives him a sad look, and pats Steve on the arm.
Steve nods in agreement, watching the now boiling pavement, but then notices a movement in the sky.
"Yes." Steve says, turning away. "Nothing."
, Steve the armour’s not ready yet, it can’t carry two people-”
,” Tony huffs, rolling his eyes. “Not your fault that is. Just believe me you stubborn ass, it’s not
The kid, and Tony is fairly certain this so called villain is no older than 19 at most, even with the mask he's wearing, is currently dramatically gesturing as he monologues about his brilliant invention, destruction of New York, enslavement of humanity blah blah blah.
“Tony?” Nat says tentatively, squeezing his shoulder. “We don’t have to do this today if you’re not ready yet. It took me a bit before I could bring myself to look.”
“Wow, seems like a party in here,” Steve looks up from making funny faces at Morgan to see Clint poking his head in, his joking tone belied by the worry in his eyes. “And I wasn’t invited? I think I’m a little offended.”
to care. "Why do you always just...jump to the worst conclusion, I-”
“I know,” Pepper says in a long suffering but fond tone. “You tell me every two seconds, I’d be an idiot if I didn’t remember.” Steve laughs as Pepper huffs. “I just wanted to make sure you guys weren’t in the middle of a mission or something.”
“We should celebrate.” He says instead, and that’s all it takes for Tony’s mood to flip.
“Ok.” he says on a sigh, “I should probably go apologize.”
Tony, thankfully, doesn't seem to need sustenance to survive either, which further cements Steve's idle thought that Tony is not
He notices when Steve stares down at his hands on his arm, and drops them. There's an acute sense of loss, as the numbness streams back in.
“Are you free at the moment?”
“Damn you.” Tony sighs, finally taking the coffee and sits down on one of his lab benches.
Tony smiles at her. “You got me tech? Aww you shouldn’t have.” Natasha snorts in response and walks off, her steps quick and efficient, carrying three heavy pieces of equipment as if it’s nothing. Steve follows her, giving Tony a grin as he passes, and Tony falls into step beside Steve.
“Everyone loves people who aren't professionally in the music industry yet can play music.” Agent Jin raises her hands in a what-can-you-do gesture. “Trust me. The minute you can sing? You’ve won their hearts, game, set and match.”
“You look at me like that, and I kind of wish I could give you a hug.” Tony says eventually, sadly, waving his hand through Steve’s arm gently, the pixels dissolving as his fingers pass through. Steve looks down at his hands, unable to really feel anything of course, but still touched to the core just from the sentiment, his arm tingling a bit just from the knowledge of Tony’s caress.
uncultured. Now, go sit before I Frodo that coffee.”
People all over are holding memorials for him, and the channels are all broadcasting the various ceremonies. All in honour of Tony.

Steve doesn’t get it. If following him around makes him unhappy, Steve doesn’t understand why he doesn’t just leave. Steve
“Well it sure didn’t look it.” Tony responds. The background systems monitor the compound 24/7, so if you had any qualms about an AI looking after the place, shouldn’t have decided to stay here Captain Judgemental.”

Steve goes to protest, thinking about the past, not being able to let go is kind of what got him into this mess in the first place, but Tony shakes his head sharply.

“Alright then." Steve whirls his staff, sending another person flying. "It’s your call Shellhead. Join the Avengers comms, I want your input on this entire mission and as for the other thing...whenever you’re ready.”
Tony sighs and walks away from a still cackling Steve. “All I ever get is abuse. ABUSE.”
But then again, Tony has paused in his tracks at this point and isn’t flickering out, so Steve doesn’t bother to correct himself and keeps going. “No seriously. What the

Tony gives her a confused look. “Screen?”
He finds himself walking forward to stand in front of the lab doors. The place is probably dark and empty now, locked.

Natasha snorts from beside him, and nudges Steve’s shoulder gently, to which he responds with very maturely sticking his tongue out at her. Tony laughs.
It’s been five minutes, and he’s still trying to wrap his head around the vision in front of him. Steve kind of feels like his brain has shut down if he’s gonna be entirely honest, and a rather worrying numbness has set in where usually the panic or grief would have been.
After everyone had arrived back at the cabin, (Pepper and Happy had apparently cleaned up the cups beforehand, thankfully otherwise that would have made for some questions from the Avengers seeing that they had not in fact been the ones doing the pranking) Nat had stayed for an hour before she had taken one last look around at everyone and smiled, nodding in a satisfied manner before citing that she wanted to return early to work on the garden a bit more.
An overuse of italics. :)
“Natasha, heeeelp, Steve’s trying to murder me!” Tony yells at the house. Steve laughs at that and spins him around once before setting him down again, planting a kiss on his cheek for good measure. Tony definitely does not blush. Or squeak. Not at all.
“Why are you doing this to meee” he whines.
This is his domain, and it's scary how easily he draws it to himself, up his arm, and shudders desperately as the cold swirls up in a palpable wave, and it hurts, why does it
Steve writes down every last detail he can think of; average height and build, brown hair, blue eyes, flight, strength…
“Y’know. Skedaddle? Don’t tell me you don’t know what that means, I’m not
The day of the funeral dawns bright and gorgeous. Despite the general belief that funerals should be nothing but somber, Steve can’t help but think it’s fitting for Tony’s send off to be on a beautiful morning like this.
“You’re here literally everyday,” Steve points out with a chuckle, kind of suspecting that they’re just here to keep him company, and sits down beside Harley on the bed. “At this point, I’m not entirely sure you two
Steve has to leave so he can hack up some more flower petals.
“Right back at you Tony.” Natasha waves over her shoulder. “Not you Steve, you I like.”

Pepper chases Happy with a foamy sponge, Wanda keeps making silverware levitate, Morgan is declared the Greatest Dish Dryer in the Universe™, Tony keeps shutting off the high-tech faucet at random times just to be annoying, and Bruce breaks one of the plates because he was laughing so hard at a joke Rhodey told that he forgets he’s holding one and accidentally lets go.
“If you thought watching them was bad,” Steve starts, raising an eyebrow at them, “try
Tony doesn’t mean to, really he doesn’t, he’s just trying to find the bathroom, and really why the hell does this bodily function still exist here in the afterlife, it’s completely illogical, but he overhears a bit of their conversation on the way back downstairs.
“Wait. What?” The kid tilts his head sideways in confusion, which Tony admits is frankly kind of adorable. He looks like a puppy. A confused, evil puppy.
Tony looks confused when he wakes up the next morning, clearly not expecting to wake up in his makeshift bed. Steve shrugs when he asks, and after that, something seems to thaw in Tony’s eyes, and he never seems to shut up, still following him around, but chattering all the while at Steve even if he doesn’t know how to respond.
“Hop to it Rogers, left right left, come on.” and Steve gets up with a sheepish smile, and follows Pepper and Morgan inside.
“No shush. You’re going to listen because I can’t believe you’re trying to
“That’s it. He’s gone insane.” Tony sighed. “Someone notify Agent, his boss has lost his marbles.”
Steve wonders if he’ll go where they’ve gone when he dies, or if they’re just trapped, forever in ice. He wonders if there was ever any hope of saving his people from this fate.
, you hear me? ‘Take it from a guy who’s been frozen for 65 years, the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules’” Bucky quotes easily and Steve gapes. “Steve has never followed a rule in his
“I asked her how Director Fury lost his eye.” she says, taking another sip of her coffee casually and Steve freezes.
“Nothing wrong with having hang-ups.” Steve reminds him again; Tony gives him a grin that Steve returns hesitantly.
Then they leave together, Tony talking cheerfully, and Steve occasionally interjecting with a question or a comment here or there. Tony seems to find Steve’s confusion at his references funny, gives sighs of frustration though when Steve doesn’t laugh at his jokes.
Steve is numbly glad somehow, to see it, even if the sight of his friend in despair is painful. Something is better than nothing, and soon, he knows, there won’t even be that much.

of the years Steve had dealt with them, not even calling them heartless for declining to show up in public. Instead they had seemed to respect their choice, left them alone to mourn in peace. It’s thoroughly decent, and it says something about Steve’s life, that out of everything that has happened in the last two years, the press leaving them alone is the thing he finds weird.
