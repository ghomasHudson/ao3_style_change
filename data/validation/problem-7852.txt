Steve nodded and approached Tony. He took him by the waist, and they arrived at the house FRIDAY had scanned and found a family inside. When they landed, Tony broke the door and saw the family under several tables. He did not expect there would be so many. There were three adults, three children and an older person.
Tony stepped back looking at him puzzled, he touched his reactor again and this time the suit covered his face. Through the mask he could see Steve who looked as serene as he felt inside. Tony activated his thrusters and flew out of the compound.
"I will, thanks, buddy," Tony replied.
"I'm calling Bruce," Natasha said looking at Steve.
"OK. I'm on my way," Tony told him firmly.
"How many civilians can be there?" Natasha asked.
Tony could not help that warm feeling growing in his chest. "You visit her often, right?" He said to Steve trying to change the subject.
"Whatever you want to eat," Tony said kindly.
, he said to himself. Now other steps were heard, and Tony felt a strange emptiness when those caresses and the closeness of whoever was there was gone. He tried opening his eyes again, and now they responded. Everything was so blurred, and he could not distinguish his surrounding. He could only see a blurred figure coming out the door of a room he did not recognize either.
At Tony's eyes the concern began to show. In his face Steve could see the way in which that bright mind was waking up and really understanding where he was and what they had lived.
In a few minutes, he was reaching the city where the hurricane would soon arrive. Tony had to dodge all kinds of objects while approaching land. The winds were impossibly strong, but he was glad he had spent so much time improving his suit. When he landed in the city, he immediately set about helping the people he found running for refuge. Schools and shelters were still open receiving those coming. Tony started helping the families and all people he found on the streets, but he could feel Steve's closeness.
They spent the rest of the morning discussing Tony's projects, and Steve offered to help him in whatever way he could. Tony liked being able to share with Steve that way. It felt good to know they were truly friends. He could feel like a storm had been very close to him, but now it seemed to slowly move away.
"Friday?," Tony spoke this time with a little more despair.
for a last time and he would be very careful. Also, he already returned the stones. The mission was accomplished, then maybe this could be an opportunity, just one more time. It would not be an encounter, of course; it could be from a distance.
. He heard Steve's voice in his head. Tony moved away from the screen.
Wong's words wrapped his heart in a peace he could somehow recognized. Tony felt his words spoke of an absolute truth. In such a little time for him, the universe had become so large that it allowed the expression of everything one could conceive. It was no longer enough just to believe in what could be proven. He recognized in his soul that life was truly inexplicable, which made it extremely powerful.
Steve laughed and turned to look for Natasha. He hadn't seen her yet, but he knew she was there. Soon he realized she was alone on a balcony. He took the beer, told Rhodey he would go to say hello and headed to where she was.
Tony tossed himself down onto one of the couches, head landing on Bruce’s lap. Bruce grunted, but didn’t complain.
“It’s turning out to just be some kind of game at this point,” Clint snorted. “I’m going to get a selfie with Gail and send it to him.”
“By the way,” Darcy piped up, suddenly brightening up. “Since it’s Christmas, what’re you gonna do about your little monthly project for junior-ette?”
“Of course, sir,” JARVIS replied promptly.
Phil glared at the back of Tony’s head and Steve gave him an apologetic look, all the while trying not to put his hands over his ears. Tony was no doubt going to take a picture just to embarrass him.
“Thanks, Phil. You’re a lifesaver.” Steve sighed. “I know Pepper and Happy are going to be around and Tony can keep SI under control, but I don’t want to be too far from Julia, for now at least, not as much as I can help it.”
Gail broke out laughing, while Tony scrambled onto the couch, looking incredibly giddy himself and cheering them on.
“I know. Papa’s got good taste, right?” Tony cooed as he slowly dressed her up in the onesie. “Oh, you look adorable, baby girl. Just perfect. We should thank Uncle Rhodey for this and send him pictures to make him jealous. And show it off to the bots too. They are going to get a kick out of this.” He slowly fitted the cap over Juliana’s head and she smiled gummily at him. Tony couldn’t resist smothering her with more kisses.
“You’re Deadpool!” Both Peter and Ned suddenly squeaked, apparently unable to help themselves.
“Of course I do.” Pepper cleared her throat and stood up, straightening her skirt. “Will that be all then, Mister Stark?”
under there, you can strip that off in the workshop. And honestly, I really need to get started on that undersuit I’d been planning to make for you. I keep putting it off whenever Julia does something adorable, which is every single hour. We can retake your measurements now–”
“By the way,” Tony snapped his fingers as he remembered something, “It’s your turn.”
The bots chirped softly, watching her. U moved the camera over their heads but not closer.
Da scoffed. “Fine. Later, losers.”
Steve just laughed and Tony smiled, kissing him and turning serious.
Juliana wailed. Her curls were bouncing, her face was red, and tears were leaking down her chubby cheeks.
“Well, we couldn’t resist. She’s a beauty,” Steve said, lifting her up a little so the bots and JARVIS could see more of her.
Steve wiped some spilled milk from Juliana’s chin as he spoke. “You know that monthly photo book we’ve been making for Julia? We want you to take a photo with her for her third month.”
“Such an ungrateful brat,” Da said as he stood up. “Just for that, your Pops and I are going. Come along, honey bunch, we still have all of the Plaka to see and all those kitschy tourist shops and artisan shops you love looking through.” He scoffed, but looked far too fondly at Pops.
“My finest moment.” Darcy grinned, while Steve just chuckled. “And hey! Now I got confirmation that I’m going to get a photo!”
“Man of Iron, you are a friend like no other,” Thor boomed. “I shall call my Lady Jane. Then I will be back with much haste and we shall partake in this movie of the sea, its shape changing demigods, and singing crustaceans for your offspring.” He smacked a kiss on Tony’s cheek. “Thank you.”
"Mary." Tony heaved himself up, Rhodey helping him. "Obidiah's got Peter, Rhodey, he has him." Rhodey's eyes widened and he let Tony guide him over to the assembly station. "I've got to get over there." The floor started to move and Rhodey took a step back, the suit starting to assemble around him.
“I di’ it! I di’ it!” She exclaimed, (not quite sounding out the ‘T’), and bounced on her feet, excited. Steve couldn’t help it as his grin got wider and bigger.
"I need to figure this out, I need-"
"A nuclear deterrent," Tony said breathlessly. He had heard the same argument for years. He had been one of the many people who tried to come up with that solution. "'Cause that always calms everything right down."
Coulson blew the whistle and Jamie let out a delighted squeal. Tony smirked, leaning back in his seat. Mary leaned over his shoulder. “Do you really think they’re going to win after that?”
"The altitude record for fixed wing flight is eighty-five thousand feet, sir," Jarvis told him, showing him the information on the screen as well.
The toddler wrapped his arms around Tony's neck. "Hi, Daddy."
"I'm afraid not, Sir," Jarvis answered, sounding like he was sorry. "I'm finishing the link-up with the SI satellites." Tony sighed a little, but nodded. The elevator opened on the med bay level and the three walked out. "Shall I place a call to Dr Duff?"
"They sent me with some AIM scientists, when they were first setting up the lab with some of Stark's notes." Steve raised an eyebrow. "Howard Stark. They were important, and there was a possibility that SHIELD would have seen their movement. I was there to make sure that nothing happened." Bucky was resolutely trying to ignore the inquisitive look he was getting from Jamie. "I was there when they set those animal experiments lose, watched your team fighting. After you put a kink in their plan, they decided to keep me stationed with AIM, to protect their work."
"Do you often talk this fast?" Steve couldn't help the question that blurted out when Tony actually took a breath after talking. He swore he saw a little glare, but a little bit of a smirk on his face. "I'm sorry, but I just felt out of breath as you were talking." They both looked over as Peter made a little noise while talking to Mary, then went back to looking at each other. "I don't work with Mary at the office, no," Steve told him, watching Tony's eyebrow raise just a tiny bit, "but I do know her from SHIELD, yes." Tony hummed a little, nodding.
As per usual, unbeat'd, and Marvel owns lots of stuff in this story.
"Doesn't seem like the first panic attack that you've encountered." Steve took Mary's jacket, putting in the closet for her as she put the tablet down by the couch.
“Jarvis is already screening all my calls, texts, and emails,” Steve admitted. “And Pepper is making good on that promise to get us our own PR team.”
“Except all of it, because I know that Steve would have told you everything.”
It was one of Steve's drawings, this one in just pencil. There was no denying Steve's talent with this piece. He had managed to catch one of the times that Tony had fallen asleep on the couch with Peter. Tony's head was resting on the arm of the couch, Peter on his chest, hand resting over the arc reactor, a blanket pooled around Tony's legs. Steve even managed to show the glow of the reactor against Peter's hand, and the softness in his face as he slept. Tony's arm was wrapped around Peter's waist, fingers curled around his side.
"New element?" Steve asked. He had noticed black lines on Tony's neck on his first visit to the lab that he and Dr Banner had been working. If he thought back on it, the project that he saw on the table, the one that he thought that Tony had been working on because he was bored, it was blue, much like the glowing reactor in his chest. Tony hadn't brought up a personal pet project, he was working on a new reactor. "Why did Tony need a new reactor, Jarvis?"
The printer suddenly jumped to life, and Tony rolled over in the chair, grabbing it before Pepper could. The two women in the room watched him eagerly, both awaiting the results, and Tony looked at the paper, at the words and comparisons of the DNA. He of course had been thinking about what would happen with either result. If the results were negative, nothing would change, except that Pepper would probably put a couple more security black suits on him. This was the third paternity claim this year alone, and he could practically feel her glare when Mary had first walked in. And maybe this one they could keep Obie finding out about it, keep it from the tabloids this time so they wouldn't have to pay to have it not run.
"He didn't seem like it the first time I saw him," she said. Tony jolted up, hissing and pressing a hand to his ribs at the movement, and Steve stopped in his tracks.
"Sure thing," Tony nodded a little, even if the little boy couldn't see it. "As soon as I get back home, I'll come over. Did your Mom tell you where I was going?"
"Let me know if there's anything I can do to help," Steve told him, and Tony just nodded, walking down the hall a little, towards one of the windows. The sun was starting to set and Steve sighed internally. He went over to the door next to what Tony had said was his room, and slowly opened the door. He could automatically hear the soft sounds of hospital equipment, a heart monitor, and stepped inside.
“Friends!” Thor greeted jovially as he walked out of the elevator. Steve followed at a more sedate pace with Tony in his arms.
He was exhausted, had been for several days. He never usually complained about it, being used to it for most of his life. At first it had been constant exhaustion from being sick all the time, from taking all the meds that his Ma had been able to get for him from the hospital, then from his time in the war and hunting down Hydra. Now, it seemed that it still didn’t stop. Tony was there to help, and he would never be able to thank the man enough for that. He had allowed Steve to be a part of his son’s life, and then there was Jamie. Steve loved the kids, and would do anything for them, of that he was certain, but he was tired. Jamie was nearly a year old, but still needed constant attention, and then there were the art lessons and Peter, and the self defense classes with both Peter and Wade. He wasn’t complaining, really he wasn’t, but sometimes he just needed a little break.
"Shall I send him the video, Sir?"
"I can't deal with you!" Tony threw his hands up, turning to leave the room. Steve caught up with him quickly, walking next to him back down the hallway. "The Twenty-First Century has corrupted you Steven Rogers."
Peter perked up in Tony’s arms. “Blueberry pancakes!!” Tony laughed kissed his head.
Because I had so much fun with this chapter, Birthday part 2 might be posted on Thursday, or Wednesday. It's super fun what I have planned, and they deserve it!
"Let her in, for the love of science!" Tony exclaimed, trying to push all the batter from the counter into the bowl.
"I'm glad he's having a good birthday. Steve, that is," Mary said. "And Tony looks a hell of a lot more relaxed than the last time I saw him. I thought for sure that what I saw from the Helicarrier footage would be the norm for them." Phil rubbed her shoulder a little. "But, I know that Tony, and probably Steve, is still keeping a few things from me."
"So, do I have to act as your PA for now?" Mary asked, unaware that Tony was narrowing his eyes at the older scientist as Banner smirked. "Not that Jarvis doesn't already share your calendar with me."
The two men eventually fell into a comfortable silence, both checking their phones for updates every so often. Tony glanced up when William walked back out with Peter. "We're going to go down to the cafeteria," he announced.
“Stark,” Bucky growled out.
The building started to rumble again, floor to ceiling, all shaking. The energy was building too much, too fast. She needed to get out. With a shout of pain she pushed herself up, running for the trucks. She could hear crackling behind her, cement starting to break up. There was one sedan, started, but the agent heading for the car had been caught in the crossfire of Barton and Hill. She slid in, gasping, and slammed the car into gear and raced down the tunnel.
Until she heard the shouting from behind, footsteps running. She turned and her eyes widened as the same time she resigned herself to this being her luck. There was a very awake, very determined, and startled, looking Steve Rogers running across the lobby. Mary had told them that the 1940's room wasn't going to work, and it seemed she had been right as a small mass of Agents ran after him. The last thing he remembered was fighting Hydra, and SHIELD was still the SSR, and it was also 65 years ago.
“Sugar!” Wade proclaimed, jumping to his feet. Peter followed him, both look expectantly at Tony.
"Says the man who helped with an alien invasion," the woman bit back. "Alright, short version, I'm in Baltimore bringing the twins to see their paternal grandparents- Long story, I'll explain later. And I knew that Steve was still in DC, and he told me a couple days ago that I should stop by, and we'd have lunch, and he could see how big their getting, not the point. Point is, I called to let him know I was in town, that the twins were secure for a few hours. He picked up, but didn't say anything, and the line went dead. He calls my back phone three times, not letting it ring enough for me to pick it up though."
"I will talk to the school." Mary stopped him. "It'll be all over the news if even one of those secretaries recognizes you."
Tony rubbed the spot of his nose between his eyes, pushing his new glasses up out of the way, and groaned a little. He was rapidly remembering why he preferred contacts to glasses, even if he had only been wearing them for less than a day. Or perhaps it was because he had been staring for too long at holographic screens and tablets. He was going to blame the glasses.
"I don't want to worry them until we have more facts," Tony said, putting Jamie's back to his chest, letting her take most of the weight of the body in her hands.
"That is a horrible nickname," she breathed out, catching her breath as she pushed through the crowd. "I have had worse though, so it can't be as bad as-" She was cut off by screams, and the sound of two pops. Gunshots.
"How long have you been here?" Steve asked him after a moment. Jamie had turned her head to look at Bucky, two sets of the same blue eyes looking at him now.
Steve blinked a little as he followed Peter to the kitchen. His thoughts about Tony possibly being gay were put aside when he saw the state of the kitchen. It was obvious that Tony didn't do a lot of cooking, with too many dishes out, burned cupcakes on the stove, and different frosting tubes out. Steve was pretty sure he could salvage this. Even when he was small and sickly, he could still cook while his Mother worked.
"Very well, Sir," Jarvis confirmed. "She woke up two times, but quickly went back to sleep on her own." Tony pursed his lips a bit, but nodded. "Dr Banner is still in his lab, and I have informed him that the two of you are awake. He awaits your arrival at your convenience."
"Tony," she paused, gathering her bearings, and Tony didn't like that. "You know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again."
He let out a soft snort, letting her hug him. "You weren't supposed, too," he said quietly.
"Yeah, go ahead," Tony said, nodding. His eyes were closed and he was rubbed between his eyes. He needed to get to the workshop first. He forced his eyes open, keeping close to the wall and headed down the hall. The workshop was close tot he garage, so he had been heading in the right direction.
The first thing Steve had done after Mary left was search the apartment for bugs, or any type of listening device, or camera. When he didn't find anything, although he found a lot of stuff that he was going to ask Mary about, he felt a little better. He looked inside the icebox to see that it was actually empty, and decided that he would have to make a list of groceries. He found some paper and a pen in the study, and took it out to the dining room table, wanting to be closer to the front door. Steve pulled out a separate piece of paper to write out questions that he had as well, such as if groceries were still rationed out with stamps. It was clear that there was a freedom with money again, judging by the car that Mary drove; it seemed very luxurious.
“You stay up here, I’m going to go and get Steve and Bruce.” Tony let out a sigh as Mary left the bedroom. His head dropped back and he fought back giving out an audible groan.
"Nah," she shook her head, shrugging a little, taking a couple steps towards the front entrance. "I was just gonna order something to go, honestly."
A couple notes to go over. Good news, Bad news, really on this first one. This story is coming to an end. It's either going to the be next chapter, or the chapter after that, but then, that's it. *sniff sniff* That's the Bad news. Good news! The sequel will come out within the week of it ending! Like, seriously, I have years planned for our boys. All the way up to Peter's High School years. (And a couple more Marvel movies to put in here. Not. Civil War. My emotions can't handle the trailers, or any interviews, so nope. All aboard the Nopetrain to Nopeville in the heart of Nope City!) The next chapter will have the title of the new fic, so you'll know what to look for.
Dinner was a hit, and Tony made a mental note to keep the catering company in mind for the future. He was becoming more and more surprised at how everything was coming together, and flowing like he and Pepper had planned. Mary and Coulson were able to literally just enjoy their wedding, not having to worry about any of the details or anything that might go wrong.
Tony made a whining noise. “I was afraid you were going to say that. I need to keep working on stuff, need to keep creating.”
“I trust your team,” Steve told him. “If I have questions though, I’ll be sure to bring them to you.”
“Flare?” She got up to follow him, wanting to stick close to him.
Steve was at the front of the table in the meeting room they sometimes used when they needed to debrief after a mission. Tony was casually sprawled in a chair at the other end, Clint and Natasha on the other side. They had handed Steve a folder with some information to look through, and they were just waiting on Bruce. Coulson sat with a chair between him and Tony, watching Steve. No doubt he had already seen this information, being both Barton and Romanoff's Handler.
“From what he told me, it was both their ideas, so I don’t think there was much ‘roping in’ involved,” Bucky defended, himself mostly.
“-but it would appear that things are happening that I have been unable to explain,” Tony continued, trying to ignore Strange’s comment. His hands came back out of his pockets, and he rubbed them together, a bit nervously. Strange took a couple steps closer, head tilted as he observed Tony.
"You, sir, will like it when I come back from this visit," She smiled at him as they stood up, Coulson grabbing her jacket and handing it to her. "I love it when my man gets along with my son." Coulson smirked and she laughed as they left her office.
"You need to get some sleep, Tony," Steve interrupted. "You've been with Hydra for five days."
"Let's take a couple scans, and we'll go from there." Tony hopped up on one of the beds, pulling over a screen. For a second it looked like Steve was going to try and pull Peter away, take him somewhere else so he didn't have to watch, but Peter was faster, pulling himself up on the bed next to Tony. He took the screen from Tony's arm and held it over his injured arm. "Thanks, Petey." He looked at Steve and tried to give him a reassuring look. That's when he saw that some of Steve's uniform was torn, scratches from claws. "Hey, after you get the scan saved, why don't you help Cap clean up his scratches. I'm sure he's got some on his back that he can't reach."
"I'm just hoping that he won't be there hovering over my face anymore," Tony commented before reaching over to steal one of Steve's fries.
Steve destresses Tony, in the best way possible.
"They're pretty much inseparable." Tony smirked a little happily, watching them. They watched as Wade moved to the swing next to Peter, pushing the empty seat until he got it to flip over the bars several times, making the swing higher up. He was taller than Peter by at least four inches. He hopped up on the swing, Peter watching him while he pumped his legs, keeping his own momentum. Wade worked his legs, too, getting higher and higher, until he started to slide back on the seat. He suddenly flipped upside down, wrapping his legs around the chains, and using his arms to keep up the momentum. He grinned over at Peter, and Peter laughed loudly.
"It's nice to see you both again," Tony said, giving them a smile.
"Tony, don't go down that path."
Possible triggers for anxiety attacks/PTSD.
Sorry for the delay! I wrote an update on Tumblr, (it's like my own status log), and I wasn't done with the chapter because I was making this bone achingly sweet. I mean, I wanted to get this Perfect. I had a crazy weekend, and my buffer of chapters had ended sooner than I though, but this needed some fine tuning. Also, PART OF MY TOOTH FELL OFF inside my mouth. Like, it just broke away, so like, half of my tooth is missing, while the other part is just hanging out in my mouth, all jagged edges and what not. That'll throw a kink in your day.
“She doesn’t like big sweeping movements right now,” Steve explained to him, leaning forward to grab another sandwich to hand it to Tony, then grabbed a container and a small spoon. “It just started yesterday, that I noticed. Hey, can Papa feed you come applesauce?”
Steve’s hand reached up, fingers gently ruffling through the short hairs on Tony’s neck. Tony hummed a little, resting more against Steve, taking in his warmth. “I think that there are two pints of ice cream in the kitchen that are calling our names.”
“Yeah, I’ll be nice for once,” Tony nodded, heading for the door. “I want to check on certain lab results, and then I have to go collect my boys for a haircut.”
Tony let out a soft breath, giving her a smile. She did a little spin, and the knee length, lace covered, dress flowed out a bit. "Agent is a lucky man, that's for sure."
"Either way, nothing comforting," Clint threw in.
Tony had been right, Peter hadn't slept at all. He stayed attached to Tony's side, keeping his Daddy in sight at all time. Tony didn't mind so much, they both needed the comfort. Peter had eventually stopped crying, but Tony had assured him that he still felt he needed too, that it would be alright. He had been fighting off the pure fear that he didn't know how to be the primary parent by reading all the files that Coulson had given him. He knew that Peter was reading everything that on the screen, but the boy didn't react too much, so he didn't see the harm in letting him watch him. Tony didn't want to hide anything if he didn't have to from Peter. And if Peter understood any of Selvig's notes, then Tony would have to reconsider having Peter skip some grades. Several of them.
"Yeah, I think it is," Steve corrected.
"I have a present for you." Peter beamed up at him as the elevator doors closed and started to move. "So does Daddy," Peter whispered to him. "But I didn't tell you that!" Steve snorted, and nodded with a smile.
“You’re not wrong,” Steve said, smirking.
Bucky had his hands behind his head, legs stretched out on the bed, watching the stars light up on the ceiling. Jamie was on his chest, pointing every so often at one that blinked a little brighter than another. When Bucky didn’t say anything, she turned her head and patted his chest with her hand, pointing up again. “Yeah, I see it. I don’t know what it’s called though. Your Daddy would probably know though.” She seemed satisfied with his answer and turned her head back around.
"So what happens now?" Meg asked, walking in from the kitchen, handing a bottle to Tony to give to Jamie. "I mean, you have to tell them."
"Fuck! Mary, holy fuck!" He moved closer to her, hands hovering but not touching yet. "Shit, uh, how's your breathing? Are you in pain? Should I move? Uh-"
"And I've got a backup that I know Tony will get," Meg continued, trying to wipe her laughter. Another song started that they all knew, thanks to Peter. "
"You coming alone, or bringing a guest, Cap?" Tony asked, glancing back down at the tablet.
"Stuff that you'll find out in a couple of years, I'm sure," Tony told him with a smile. He held out one arm to Peter, patting his leg with the other, and the boy ran over to him, hopping up in his lap. Tony wrapped his arm around Peter. "Nothing to worry about, Petey-Pie." Tony bit back a laugh when he saw Wade open the bathroom door, pushing Steve's shoes and socks inside, hearing a surprise yelp from Steve. "You're usually supposed to knock first, Wade."
"Yeah," Peter nodded, taking a biscuit from the plate that Tony put in front of him. "Daddy took Wade and me to the park, then he let us get ice cream."
He pushed the blanket off and got up, heading for the hallway of bedrooms. The door to Peter's room was partially open, and when he peeked his head inside he saw that Peter and Wade were both asleep on the bed, looking much more peaceful than earlier that morning. He let out a little breath of relief at seeing them there. He moved to go check in Tony's bedroom, and saw that Mary's door was open a little. There was a voice talking inside, low and quiet.
"No way!" Wade made a face and shook his head. "Not all Dark Side are Sith."
"Then someone isn't treating you right." He rolled his eyes, heading over to the pants section. His closet was generously big, and stocked, thanks to Tony. "Seriously, Steve. This is overboard. And you told Mary!"
"This may seem weird, or forward, but can I interest you in having lunch with me?" Steve asked, trying to sound confident, but pretty sure that he came off as awkward. "I mean, then we could continue talking about music? Maybe you could add to my playlist, give some suggestions."
Tony closed his eyes again, moving his head slightly when Steve’s soft lips were against his neck. “You already know what I thought my life was going to be like,” Steve told him. “And I got you now, and I got Peter and Jamie, and hell, I even got Bucky back. I’m not letting you go, and I will do everything in my power to keep you. To keep this family.” Tony pushed his face into Steve’s neck. “I’m going to smother you with happiness.”
Tony sprinted forward, past Rachel, trusting Steve to get Rachel. He was right when he heard Rachel huff and protest, more quietly, to Steve. Tony stopped in the middle of the walkway, not letting George move any further. "She has a point. What are you doing here?"
As usual, Unbeta'd, Marvel owns stuff, music/movies own stuff, you know the drill.
Tony flew back to the attacked floor and saw Steve standing closer to the window, looking like he was inspecting something, his shield on his back. Tony flew a bit closer then frowned. “Hey, Cap, are you-“
Steve put the rake against the closest tree and went over to help Mary, taking a load of bags from her hands. Mary gave him a smile then wrapped his arms around Peter's middle and pulled him out of the trunk, a box of fruit snacks in his hands. "Looking good, Pete," Steve said when he saw the little boy with the smug look, his treasure in his hands. He had a new haircut, the shaggy curls gone, and now sporting a shorter, spikier look.
They found the office to Dr D. Cavanaugh and walked in, Steve pulling out the initial paperwork that Tony had pre-filled out, handing it the receptionist. They were told that it would be a few minutes, so Steve led Tony towards a loveseat. “You should give me your phone.” Tony raised an eyebrow at Steve at the suggestion. “You won’t be able to use it as a distraction, and you know that I will come in if there’s an emergency.”
“I told you before, I don’t care. I’m not ashamed of being Bi, and I’m not ashamed to be seen dating you.” Steve turned his attention to Tony, holding onto his hand. “They can say whatever they want about me, because I know how I feel, and as long I know that you’re happy, then I’m happy. Whatever they print about us, we know the truth of how we feel, of our family, and we’ll work with the kids on the press as they grow older.” Tony let out a little sigh, nodding his head, and Steve brought his hand up to kiss his knuckles. “I love you.”
Steve reached over the back of the couch, tapping Tony's head with his finger, drawing him back from his thoughts. Tony shot Steve a little smile, a movie lighting up the TV screen in the living room. It didn't take long until the boys had finished their hot cocoa, and it had the desired effects that Tony had expected. Barely half way through the movie and they had fallen asleep, Peter leaning into Tony, and Wade leaning into Steve.
"I don't have enough legs to be a spider." Peter giggled a little. Tony wrapped an arm around Peter's waist, tickling his sides as he pulled him down into his lap. Peter giggled, kicking his feet a little as he left the bed. He snuggled into Tony's chest, laying on his side in Tony's lap. Tony's arms wrapped around his son and kissed the top of his head. He wasn't paying attention to how Mary's parents were watching him, or the soft smile on William's face.
"Lord knows that Tony had them make too much!" Tony started to push Mary's back towards the front door. Todd offered a salute and Tony got Mary walking again.
“They’re not,” Steve confirmed, drawing a semi-annoyed hum from Tony. “Let’s get them out, and get back upstairs. I’ve gotta talk to Julie, and, unfortunately, we’ve got to talk to Wade about what happened before I got there.”
Tony had stopped for a bout a millisecond when he heard Steve say 'we', but then remembered that he had agreed to help with the rebuild. "The way Peter's going, I might have to redesign the entire thing."
"Yeah, not exactly, but it'll be an easy stitch up," Steve told him. "What did this man look like?"
"You're gonna ignore me, cause she can't do anything," Peter huffed out, and Tony could see a little scowl forming on Peter's face. Tony ran his hands through Peter's hair. "Mr Steve won't be able to give me art lessons anymore because of her."
Bruce glanced at Tony, then looked back at Steve, and pulled his glasses off. "I've been able to confirm, that from the sample that was found, it's human DNA." That had a hard look from everyone in the room. Tony had looked back down at the tablet, still trying to process that what he was looking at was actually in the process of happening. "They're experimenting with cloning, and they've moved on to humans."
“You’ll need to move, to stretch out. And I wasn’t joking about giving you a massage later.” Tony turned his head, seeing Wade laying over Steve’s legs now, shooting a smile at him. Steve leaned over, pressing a kiss to Tony’s cheek, then wrapped his arms around Jamie. She made little whine, then settled in Steve’s arm, against his chest.
“It really is you,” she breathed, sitting up a little more. “I had seen the news, but I wasn’t sure….” Steve gave her a soft smile before walking over, the two wrapping their arms around each other. “Oh, Steve, it’s really you.”
"I think I caught sight of our assassin," Tony said quietly and Steve frowned. His hands tightened around Tony's. "Not in New York. Following you." That wasn't what Steve had been expecting to hear. Tony slid one of his hands away to grab his phone from his pocket, tapping the screen twice and a hologram was projected. Steve looked at them, and he saw traffic cams pictures of him walking with Meg down the street yesterday When Tony moved his hand, multiple images appeared, and he saw the same person following them, dark clothes, black ball cap.
"Keep talking like that, and the universe it going to think that you can handle more than two kids, Steve." Steve shot a warning look at Bruce who just smirked. "That's some heavy-duty parent talk you're throwing around."
"That's a horrible come-on," he said and she smirked. "I used more cliché lines to better effect."
"I've got to go get my son, soon," Mary said and Steve turned to face her now. "I want you to have all the time you need to process-"
"Nope!"
"Are you trying to take my Peter from me?" Tony tugged back, making Peter giggle.
"I did," he said quickly. How was he supposed to explain to her that it had been a while without saying, 'I was frozen in the ice and lost lots of time'? "I listened to a lot of Forties music."
"It's a better honorarium than my PhD's," Tony said easily. "What exactly are you making there, pooh bear?"
"You need ten floors for that?" Steve asked, with genuine curiosity.
"Mr Stark," Mary's father greeted as he shook his hand. He hadn't warmed up to Tony, per se, but he had acknowledged that Tony was at least taking care of Peter, and wasn't a horrible father. Tony had preened a little at the half compliment.
“A little context would be helpful,” Strange piped up. Tony turned his glare towards the doctor now. He had been harboring the Asgardian, and hadn’t said a word. “This is taking a physical toll on him.”
"A boy and a girl?" She nodded again. "Sounds lovely. If you don't mind, what are their names? Ages? Unless they're twins, then who's the oldest? What school do they go to? Oh, does your husband work, or are you the main bread winner? Does he get more time with the kids, so that they resent you for not spending enough time at home? Or are they both numb to the fact that both parents work, and they're left with a sitter, or day-care all day?"
"Why not?" Someone shouted from the back.
"I think I'll take this." Clint had stolen the little boy, holding him up over his arms, and took off running to the other side of the large dining table. Peter squealed in delight, putting his arms out like a bird. Clint put him down in a chair and turned a grin over to Tony and Steve. "He's like a little bird."
"You guys are already dealing with a lot though," she said. "Where did your socks go?"
This chapter took a little longer, because as of late I've been going through my own anxiety attacks, so I had to write parts of this chapter in a way that didn't remind me of my own, so sorry for the wait, and sorry if any of it was a bit unrealistic.
“I would question how you came to Svartlheim after I remove the Aether,” Thor told him, and Tony frowned. He opened his mouth to ask what Thor even meant, but found himself gasping again, this time with a shout of pain. The red liquid was being pulled, ripped, from his body, and it wasn’t happy about it. His body jerked forward, then fell to his knees just as suddenly. A large hand landed on his shoulder and he lifted his head up a little to see Thor kneeling in front of him. He had various cuts all over his face, some still sluggishly oozing blood, but he had a faint smile, and there was a red glow coming from the now lidded box. Tony thought Thor was talking, but the words washed over him as he let his head drop against Thor’s arm, closing his eyes and letting himself pass out.
"A what?" Tony frowned. They were doing what to him?
"Fury's dead." The words left Steve's mouth, and Tony felt his stomach drop. "The Winter Soldier." Tony heard Mary draw in a breath and Tony frowned.
Tony tore himself away from Mary's room, checked in on Peter and Wade to make sure they were still sleeping, then went back downstairs. He slipped into the underground garage where he had moved most of the cars, and set up a space that he was sure would contain Loki. Thor had assured him that shackles around his wrist dampened his magic to a point where he couldn't use it, so he just had to create something that would keep Loki in one place. Tony had gone the route of an electric fence, like a bad dog that couldn't stay in its own yard.
“That’s because you bribe him,” Tony fired back at her, getting a grin in return.
After a minute Steve gently moved Tony to rest on the bed, moving to go meet Mary outside of the room. As he closed the door to the bedroom, he saw Mary making her way down the hallway. She gave him a smile until she actually saw his face, and her lips tipped back down.
"Tony? Peter?" Tony turned his head and saw Steve burst through the doors from the stairs, helmet pulled off, shield still in hand. He spotted them and jogged over, taking a knee next to them. "Are you two alright?"
“We only need the one,” the man said, not looking at Tony. The agent at the door stumbled back with a growl, arms up to defend his head. Tony smirked a little. “What’s taking so long! They’re kids!”
"Thanks, for that, by the way," Tony said softly. He ran his free hand over his face. "Guess I was setting myself up for this, probably went too long without sleep."
“It was fun,” Steve admitted, smiling almost shyly when Pepper rolled her eyes. The eye roll seemed to scream that she was used to dealing with this kind of stuff with Tony,
"I should have done another sweep. There were too many targets out at once."
"Peter Richard Parker," Tony answered, a small smile on his face. He carefully reached into his pocket, pulling out his phone, pulling up the picture that Mary had texted him a couple days before he had left for Afghanistan. Peter was wearing a blue Captain America hoodie that Tony had gotten him, a little pair of jeans, and a red shirt, grinning up at the camera with frosting all over his face. "He's a little ham, that's for sure."
The screen stuttered a little as Tony typed in more commands. “Run calculations,” he murmured out as he looked at a second screen, with yet another third screen running through numbers and letters, spitting out results faster than most people could track. “Stop.”
"Meg and I can finally get back to watching Buffy," Tony announced happily. "Seriously, I've been missing Buffy and Supernatural, I need my fix." Tony started pushing on Steve legs with his feet, getting him to move off of the couch. Meg was pushing on Bucky's back at the same time. "And don't come back here without someone either shedding some tears, or getting a black eye."
"We're making a valitine dinner for my friend," Peter told him, turning a little shy. "He gave me a valitine at school, and I wanted to give him one back. Mama said that Daddy could help me this weekend, cause he likes boys, too"
"He's an expert in Gamma rays, that's how Fury wants to track the cube," Coulson explained. "We'd like you to help."
“I found what room I want!” Peter called from the other end of the suit and Tony was suddenly turning on his feet and hurrying down the hall.
Tony walked over, sitting on the other side of Peter, and saw that Peter was explaining how to use icons on the desktop, and moving them to the task bar for shortcuts. The neighbor didn't know how to use a computer? As soon as Tony sat down though, Peter's hopeful brown eyes turned to him.
Tony let out a little sigh, smiling, and nodding. "Alright, but when you spend the night at my place-"
"She was being attacked, and perceived a threat to her kids," Steve gave them a hard look. "She's not wrong though, you didn't read all of the report."
“As per usual, you beat all odds, Stark,” Bucky fired back playfully. Tony grinned, almost preening, and Bucky rolled his eyes. “This one, it had to be this one, Stevie?”
“It’s not like we leave them unprotected,” Steve said to him. “We’ve always got an eye on them in some way. I’m not saying that it’s a bad idea, but-“
Peter was smiling at Tony, the pushed one of the Captain America cupcakes over to Steve, then over to Tony, the third still in front of him. "My Daddy's the best." Tony picked up the cupcake, and a genuine smile spread over his face as he looked at Peter. Okay, so, maybe he could put up with Steve sitting next to his son for a few more minutes.
"Not with furniture needing to be moved, and there's still boxes coming in, and I know everything is labeled-" Steve cut off Tony's rambling with a quick kiss.
“Tony.” A familiar voice sounded nearby. “Tony, it’s nearly three in the morning, it’s June first, and you’re in Malibu, you’re in your mansion by the water. We just got back from Disneyland, Jamie is sleeping next door with Jarvis monitoring her, and Peter is just across the hall. They’re both safe and asleep.”
Tony growled and Steve picked up Tony enough so that his feet left the ground and he was able to drag him away from Loki. "I think it's time to leave," Steve mumbled and turned Tony so he was facing away from the dark haired alien before setting him back down on his feet. "You told Peter that you would sit next to him at dinner," Steve reminded the inventor. "You both had a great day today, and you can at least make sure that he has a great night as well."
"Someone came prepared," Tony teased. "What did the good Doctor have to say?" He asked and started to lead him down the sidewalk to their first store.
"Not now-"
Tony hummed and he and Steve started walking again, towards the dining room. "I don't know, I saw this really big bunny just now, hopping down the hall, not a boy."
"He was tailing you, but he's seen her as well," Tony said with a frown. "Also, that house was not suitable for one person, much less three." He tapped his phone again the holograms disappeared. "That's why we're picking a home for her tonight, and I'm getting a crew there as soon as possible to install SI security tech." Tony had made the mistake once of letting someone use a loved one against him, he wasn't going to give this assassin the chance to do that against Steve.
Tony tapped a stylus against his arc reactor as he stared at the screens that Jarvis had pulled up for him. Had Tony just been looking for information on any of the three adults in this search, he would have come up with a frustrating lack of information. But he had Meg’s information to go off of, and the information that they were all linked to Hydra. He used the stuff that Natasha had dumped onto the net from SHIELD, and it he was able to connect a few more dots.
“Also, I want you to think very hard about who’s influencing our kids sleeping habits very hard.” Tony lifted his head enough so that one eye peeked above Steve’s cheek. “You are curled around me, our heads are upside down in relation to each other, and neither one of us is laying the correct way in the bed.”
Tony reached over to take Steve’s hand with one of his. “I’m sorry, Steve. If you want, we’ll get the lawyers-“
"He shouldn't choose to be with someone like me. I've got anxiety attacks, and nightmares, and so many Daddy issues it's not funny," Tony moaned a little. "I'm already a father, and sure my son likes him, but that doesn't mean he's ready to be a dad-"
Tony snorted, taking a couple steps back. "He was an idiot." Steve frowned a little, but didn't say anything. Tony was angry, and he couldn't blame him. "For taking on Loki alone."
“Thanks, James.” Tony raised an eyebrow at him over his shoulder at the level of familiarity between the two. “What? He gave me the shovel talk when he finally found out we were dating. Now we talk.”
"Yeah, hi," Banner said, a little unsure, maybe a little skittish. "They told me you would be here."
Steve glanced to the side when he caught movement and saw Tony walking towards him. He put a finger to his lips and nodded towards Peter and Jamie. Tony saw them and tried to move silently. They saw Jamie wiggling around, moving her legs, never looking away from Peter. Tony tiled his head curiously and Steve just shrugged.
"The strange man shot Daddy," Peter said instantly. Tony shot him a look before Steve was looking for the wound. He hissed in pain when Steve's hand brushed over his arm.
"You're going to be so sore if you sleep with him in your arms, like that," Mary told him as she got up to put her mug in the sink. "You can sleep in my room with him, I'll sleep out here."
"J, bring up the plans for the Mark IV suit," Tony said, spinning a bit on the stool. "Let's start putting him through baby's first steps." Tony had some time to kill before it was time to get the boys from school, he could work on the suits.
"Caught two Hydra Agents," Clint said, arrow dangerously aimed at Bucky's head. There was already an arrow in the wall a couple feet away from Bucky and Meg. "Didn't even look like they were trying to hide." Steve's jaw dropped a little.
"Thanks, Tony," he smiled. "Thanks for an amazing birthday."
"Jarvis asked me this morning for stuff for the birth certificate," Steve said quietly, continuing to feed her. "I don't know what to put for a birthday."
Leaning down in front of Peter, he gave the boy a big, sincere, smile. "Thank you so much, Peter. Before we see the fireworks, do you wanna hear about my best friend, Bucky?" Peter's eyes got big. "I'll tell you all the stories. Bucky was my best friend, like Wade is your best friend."
"Mary had to talk you down to only making a real time projection on his ceiling at night."
"Sometimes I don't notice the right things," Tony said under his breath. "Back to the talking point, you're doing a great job so far. Better than I did when Peter was her age. You've kind of handled this whole surprise Dad situation better than a lot of people would have."
"How do you think Peter's going to react?" Steve asked when he caught where his sight was.
"So, the idea to move Meg...?"
"She's never thought you were good enough for Mary and Peter," William corrected. "To be fair, no one will be good enough in her eyes, so don't take everything so personally."
"I am working diligently, Sir," Jarvis assured him.
"Had a nightmare," the blonde said. "Couldn't get back to sleep, and it was too early for a run."
Wade shook his head. “No, and he won’t, not again. He got too close to me, didn’t even have me tied up.” He now looked up, looking at someone for the first time, expression surprisingly determined. “He hit me his gun, but he didn’t think that I would actually fight back, and I surprised him and he dropped the gun. I grabbed it to keep it away from him, then he was running at me, and I had to stop him.” He paused. “So I did.”
"He's not a stranger?" Peter asked, looking at his mom, then back at Steve.
Tony finally nodded and they both slipped out of the car. He pushed his glasses further up his nose, tapping the button on the side to turn them into sunglasses, and let out a little calming breath when he felt Steve take his hand again. He shifted his hand a little, locking their fingers together, and took the first step towards the office building. Tony liked that it was a bigger building, where he could hop in the elevator, and no one would know right away that he was headed to a psychologists office. He looked at all of the names on the plaque just inside the main lobby, and noted that most of the name had PhD’s attached at the end. Maybe he should have taken a better look at the building itself.
"Good choice. What can you tell us about the threat?"
"They would have taken them, trained them to be killers," he growled. He was about to say more, but his head moved just enough, and Steve heard what he did. Footsteps coming. Bucky grabbed Steve's shirt and threw him into the bathroom, stepped in with him and closed the door silently as the nurse walked into the room.
"It doesn't Matter." Tony turned to look at her, then at Obie, his voice riding in volume. "We own the controlling interest in the company!" He could afford to have the stocks dip, and he could bring it right back up if they had, too.
"I've had relationships before," he tried to argue.
"Apparently, my former boyfriend, the father of my children before he died, used to be one of his former Handler's." Steve looked back to the front of the bed. "That's why he was following me before your visit in January. I didn't know anything about it."
“Please, do not continue that sentence,” Rhodey begged. “You don’t need to ruin Captain America’s image even more.” He laughed when Tony groaned.
"She's been talking to him?! Is she crazy??" Tony hissed, remembering that there were a couple people sleeping past the kitchen.
As Steve was finishing lacing his shoes, tying them, there was a knock on the door. He unlocked the door and pulled it open, and saw Mary standing there, a little boy next to her leg. When he looked up and saw Steve, who was much taller than his mother, his hugged Mary's leg.
"Go to Peter," he said, kissing his temple. Tony looked at him, eyes glancing to a steadily sleepier looking Jamie. "I'm not going anywhere, and you always feel better when you've got Peter with you. And he'll feel a little better when he sees that you're alright." Tony leaned up to gently kiss him.
Not beta'd, me not owning stuff, Marvel owning stuff, blah blah, usual disclaimer.
"I'm going to have to talk to Steve about this, about you," he said quietly. "And I'm not going to like it, so that means he's not going to like it. I hate having serious conversations, specially ones that involved feelings." Her blues eyes looked back to his brown ones. "You didn't know that yet, so, I won't hold it against you. Not like you asked to be, well, here," he finished lamely. "But listen up," he levered himself up a bit with his elbows, making sure that she didn't slide or roll off of him. "That guy in there, he's taken on this big mantle, one even bigger than Captain America. He's become Dad, or you know, whatever you end up calling him as you learn to talk. I still think he's just a baby himself, but I'm old."
"Don't call me that."
"But, what if I really wanted pancakes?" Tony asked the little boy, reaching his arms on either side of Peter to cut the waffles that Bruce had made. Steve went over to Bruce, nodding to him. Bruce motioned to a stack of waffles already made, various toppings sitting in smaller bowls.
"I'm not having this conversation with you," Tony said, slumping back down into the chair.
"I don't know why and Agent didn't try to recruit your mom into SHIELD," Tony said to Mary.
"You have an anti-possession tattoo," Tony gasped out like a little kid.
Tony licked his lips. "Well, I got some ice cream upstairs, leftover dinner, and nearly every movie known to man. I know I'll feel better being on the same floor as my son, and I think you're not getting any sleep either, so let's be crazy insomniacs in the same place."
“You’d do a better job at it,” Steve said right back. His hand settled on Tony’s back, warm and secure. “Tony, how many suits do you have?”
Tony nodded a little to him, biting the inside of his lip discreetly. "Thanks, Cap," he murmured. He wouldn't admit out loud that he was thankful for the offer. Tony was afraid that if he fell asleep with Peter nearby, he might not know that he was there right away, like he had when Rachel had tried to wake him up. He didn't want to hurt Peter, he would never want that to happen.
“You said you would take him to Disneyland?” Tony hissed the next morning in the bathroom. “He just got back from Disneyworld, and you said you would take him to Disneyland?”
Tony adjusted his sunglasses a little, waiting on the tarmac by the car as the jet landed. It had been a while since he had seen Mary's parents, and her mother still gave him the evil eyes, but he could not appear to be nervous in front of them. Only the Fitzpatrick's could make him forget that he was the great Tony Stark. To them, he was just the man that had made their daughter pregnant, and had a hand in Peter's life. Mary's Dad kind of liked him though.
“That’s it,” Bucky said, watching Rowan crawl to the other side of the little table, trying to help her brother push the blocks around. “I’m going to teach her to say Wade’s name first now,” Bucky said and Tony’s head whipped back around to look at him. “Oh no, you know what, I’ll get her to say Fury’s name first.”
"What's so important that you wanted to talk in person?" Mary put a glass of water in front of Tony, with her own glass in front of her.
"What is going on Tony?" Pepper's voice assaulted Steve's ears almost immediately. "I can't control the press as it is, but who is this clown? Did he not sign an NDA?"
"Even with after years of drug and alcohol abuse?" Bruce asked, but he still moved to get a needle and some vials. "And the arc reactor?"
Tony holds true that he wouldn't have been on time for dinner. He would have been dressed for it, too, had it not been for the Avengers alarm, as Tony was starting to call it, going off as soon as he stepped foot inside of the building. He sighed as he went straight for the workshop to get the Mark IX suit, then meeting Steve up on the roof.
"Rogers is on his way from DC, but you're closer."
“Oh, so the kids won’t be too much for next year then, got it,” Tony said with a nod, slipping on his sunglasses. “We’ll have to start planning earlier next year.”
The HUD flickered to life and Tony saw the footage in the corner, a flight plan to Baltimore next to it. "Tony?" She whispered. "You're still there, right?" He was able to match up the banging on the video feed to the banging over the phone. There were two females standing outside of the bathroom door of the store she was in, and Jarvis was able to identify one weapon.
Peter grinned and pat Tony's knees. "Right here."
“Your Mama would usually call me by my last name when she didn’t like what I was doing,” Tony explained, divvying out the plates. “Which was, a decent amount of the time.” Peter and Wade both got an elephant ear covered in cinnamon sugar, and funnel cake plate with fruit covered with whip cream, and powdered sugar. Peter had requested strawberries, while Wade had gotten raspberries. Two cups of lemonade were set in front of them as well. Most of the food was set in front Tony and Steve, and Steve knew that he would eat most of it, followed up by a late night gym visit. Three elephant ears were in front of them, two funnel cakes with just blueberries, and one funnel cake with strawberries. Tony had also gotten a plate of at least half a dozen corn dogs, setting that one in the middle of the table.
Tony nodded to Coulson, who walked over to him. He took the forceps from Tony's fingers, looking at his arm. "Looks like you guys had some fun."
"Captain Rogers and Young Lady Jamie are enjoying a snack up in the Penthouse, Sir. I would recommend that perhaps Mr Fitzgerald take Young Master Peter while you step outside."
Tony went with Clint, and Thor to make sure that Loki would be secure, and Steve went with Natasha to watch the doctors check over Coulson. The conferred with everything that Tony had said on the ride back, took some mobile xrays, and what they told Steve was a mobile CAT scan machine, but it just looked like the oddest thing he had ever seen. Steve also wondered where Tony kept all this stuff.
"That's what he told me," she told the Super Soldier. "I dated him for five months, Steve," she said quietly, almost imploring him to not think that she was a spy, or something else. "He was abroad most of the time, I didn't know what he was doing, or who he was working for." Steve pursed his lips, arms crossed over his chest.
"What-"
"It was a General that discharged him," Tony said, lifting his head back up to lean back against the couch. "General Ross, who is one of the doucheist Generals around." Tony glanced at Bucky, sighed, then made a motion with his hands. "For pity's sake, Barnes, she's not contagious. Give her here." Bucky stepped forward quickly to hand off Jamie to someone who would hold her properly. "Wilson couldn't be the one giving the order, then it would tie the man back to him."
"The scary man put that stick to Daddy's head," Peter sobbed out. "Daddy was trying to save me, and now he won't wake up! Help him Mr Steve, please help him!"
"If it were true what you're implying, we wouldn't be having this conversation." Mary had that spark of optimism that Tony envied sometimes. "You would have blown Peter and I off as nothing more than a dirty secret to be kept in the closet, paid off with lots of money."
Tony brushed his shirt a little, trying to smooth it out a bit, before heading out into the hall. "Pancakes!" He heard Peter shout excitedly. Tony pulled out his phone, pulling up the recording option. "But it's not Saturday!"
"Not October," Tony looked at him. "Definitely not October, not if we want Peter to ever continue speaking with us."
“Not nearly enough,” he said as he reached for the coffee carafe to refill his cup.
"Flares!" Tony shouted, and smoke and light filled their visions, giving him the opportunity to get away.
Tony's foot started to tap in the air and he started to snap his fingers. "Bruce is following a lead about those scientists from the Fall, a biological lead after Clint and Natasha dropped off a couple of files, and lab samples."
"I'm feeling better," she nodded. "I'm glad to see you up and moving though. I know I wasn't the only one shot."
"If you don't get me to a bed right now, this is gonna be a short show," Tony forced out. He could hear the buzzing of equipment in his workshop, the movement of gears, and the release of pressure from valves from inside the walls. The only thing he wanted to hear was their breath, their words, the movement that they made. Tony was already lost in everything about Steve Rogers at that moment, and he was sure to look into it later, but right now, that's all he wanted, that was all he needed.
“Unfortunately, no,” Strange told him. “I will only be able to throw a shield of sorts over his mind, to hide him, but not to sever the connection.”
"Panties?" Steve raised an eyebrow at him. "You think I wear briefs?"
"Sir, Captain Rogers has added a new song to the playlist.
"Ah, that would explain why I'm seeing you on the night shift." The guard nodded.
"I need you to make sure that Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out." This pulled a frown from Hill.
"Good thing you have such a good friend, huh?" Tony smiled softly at Peter, running his hand through his hair. "How about the four of us go to the kitchen, have a late night snack of some hot chocolate? Then we can all watch a movie."
"I know, I have it framed." Mary grinned and Tony couldn't help but laugh. "Is Steve prepared for this?" She motioned towards the table that was starting to fill up with food.
"For that project you were working on, right?" Seemed Steve had a good memory. That or Peter kept talking about it; could be either honestly.
"That would be a positive. I can still use samples from the bodies." Tony couldn't see Captain America killing a dog or cat though.
Tony's phone buzzed on the table with an alert. Had anyone been paying attention to the groom, they would have seen the wink and nod to the hidden camera Steve had set up a few seconds earlier. A new song had been added to Steve's playlist. '
"I'm sorry, but Sir cut communications." The accented voice answered Mary and Steve looked at her again. "He seems to be much better, his heart rate is back to normal, and his brain activity has settled considerably. I thank you Miss Parker, and...."
"I'm assigning you and Barton to making sure the guests make their way to their seats," Tony told Natasha. She shot him a glare, but Tony didn't seem to notice. "We're keeping this wedding low-key, and I think putting myself or Steve up at the front will draw attention from those that did not receive invitations. Also, you're like a bodyguard and beautiful greeter all in one." Tony flashed her a smile and she rolled her eyes a little.
“What did you do Pepper?” Tony kept talking, staring at her.
Steve made a noise as he shifted, a blanket falling away from his shoulders. He opened his eyes, realizing that he had fallen asleep, and there was light streaming in through the windows now. He had fallen asleep on the couch. Looking around he noted that Tony, Peter, and Wade were gone, but someone had placed a blanket over him.
Secondly, I've posted a one-shot featuring Mary and Steve. It's in the series, and it's set between Chapter 6 & 7 of this fic. It's totally fun, all comedy and fluff. Steve is dancing, Mary is dancing, there's Justin Timberlake, and My Best Friend's Wedding references. (All you really need to know about that movie, is the last scene between Jules and George.) There'll be a few more one-shots coming, as well, and then a few multi-chapter fics that are much shorter than this one, and the next.
Natasha had done all the talking, and Clint looked about as ready to murder someone as Tony was feeling. They had no idea that the man was still alive, either. They would go with the excuse of picking up Loki and Thor, not wanting to transport them in a mere vehicle, in case someone got a little too curious, and the people of New York decided to take justice into their own hands. It was true though, a riot was not needed in the still rebuilding streets of New York.
"Christine," she corrected, not surprised that he didn't remember her name.
“Jarvis,” Tony called out, rubbing his eyes with his palm. “Run names of passports entering the US within the last eight months, look for facial recognition on Hilda Mueller.” He saw another screen pop up, code flying across the screen as Jarvis accessed the TSA’s servers. “Also, just on a hunch, run facial on those entering into Germany in the last eight months.” What were the odds that she would return home?
"Lying in a bed for that long probably didn't help either." Tony made sure that there were more pillows in her reach when she finally stopped moving. "I'll hit the light on the way-" he glanced back as her hand grabbed onto his wrist.
“I can wait to meet the mini-Cap,” Rhodey said. “Specially if Peter and Wade had finally taken a liking to her.”
"I love it when you take charge," Tony said with an exaggerated growl. Steve rolled his eyes with a little smile. Tony made a clawing motion with one hand, and this time Steve reached out to push Tony's forehead.
"You're a businessman," Wade said matter-of-factly.
"I know for a fact that there's plenty of space here for you to stay, Captain," Coulson threw in.
“Steve!” Bucky shouted. “Are we gonna let them beat us??”
"You didn't even bother to close the gym door," she retorted, leaning against the door frame. "Do you regret it?"
Phil slipped the ring on her finger, then glanced over at Steve as he sat back on the bed, arm around Mary. “Don’t propose with paperwork, Rogers. You wouldn’t be able to pull it off.” Mary cackled with laughter, burying herself in Phil’s side.
"Mr Stark." Oh good, the man knew who he was already. One more notch in the things that Tony was going to bitch at Fury about.
"I'm sure she'll be much happier once she has her children in her sights," William predicted as the doors opened to his and Rachel's floor. "Good luck, Tony."
Tony shuffled into the building, Ruby by his side. It was late, he was tired, and he wanted to dive into his bed and have his girls smother him. The worst part of traveling was that he was unable to sleep on a plane, and he had gotten onto a plane after the last business meeting, meaning he had been up for more 24 hours. What Tony hadn’t been expecting was the giant fluff of an Arcanine, and the streamlined sleeping version of a Braviary in his living room.
“Papa!” She whined out. “’addy!” Steve couldn’t take it and he took big steps into the hallway, moving with a purpose to his daughter. “Papa!” Her arms went out when she saw him, and he obediently scooped her up, bringing her up to his chest.
"No offense, Tony, but I don't think that the Tower is of national importance," Steve told him.
"But they changed it." Tony started rolling his hands, and turned back to the formula on Bruce's computer. "Yours was the base, with the base we can do anything. And here, we have their modifications. We don't even have to reverse engineer this!"
“I told him that he could come talk to either one of us.”
"You're making it really hard to not follow you into the shower," Tony muttered. Steve laughed as he walked in, closing the door. As the water started, Tony gently fell onto his back, bring the baby down with him, resting her on his chest. She was still as she laid on top of him, looking at him, then looking around the room, her attention span never long focused long enough to stay with one thing. Tony gently moved the soft hair around on her head, letting out a sigh.
“I like when I figure stuff out,” he said with a smile. “Also, since we’ve trapped them here by keeping the babies in a natural sleep like state in a crib, it will now force you and Sergeant Mopey to talk about feelings!” Meg snorted and covered her mouth as Bucky tried to actually murder Tony with his eyes.
She knelt down in front of Vee. “Evelyn, would you like to go for a ride with me? I have a great surprise for you.” She had never done anything wrong to Vee, and she didn’t sense any ill intentions this time, so she followed next to her outside to the waiting towncar. Happy Hogan smiled at them both, holding the door open, and Pepper helped her up onto the seat in the back before sliding in with her.
"No!" He shouted and both women started to cackle.
“Yeah, but I got used to not wearing anything,” He pushed himself up and grabbed the pair of pants that Steve threw at him from the doorway. Tony smiled at him, then pulled the pants on and stood up to grab a shirt. He snagged Steve’s arm and pulled him in for a quick kiss. “It’ll be nice to be by the kids again, though.”
Steve's eyes widened.
"Did you make him mad at you?" Mary asked as she threw down a couple of cards.
"But I can't multi-task talking on the phone and doing something else, that would be seen as rude. You want me to appear to be a rude person?" Tony put a hand on his chest, eyes wide. “Bruce, I thought you liked me! Why are you trying to turn me into a horrible person??" Tony tried not to smile when he heard the soft giggles from Peter. Even his son was used to his exaggerated dramatics. The difference between his reaction, and the look that Bruce was giving him, was that Peter still found his Daddy amusing. Bruce wasn't falling for it.
"You’re supposed to be locating the tesseract," Fury continued. Like his tone was going to stop Tony from hacking.
The comm unit beeped twice in his ear, the reboot sequence complete. "-to the Tower." He had never been happier to hear Natasha's voice.
"Does Wade live far away?" Peter shook his head when Tony asked, and Tony hummed, nodding. "How about we make something for Wade to eat? We'll them dinner, and then make Wade something sweet, like, maybe cupcakes?" Peter's eyes lit up and he smiled, nodding. "Yeah? You like that idea?"
"Let me get her out of here." Tony would never admit it, but his voice may have taken a pleading edge. Pietro looked to his sister, ready to grab Tony, to stop him from walking out the door. She shook her head to him once, he frowned, but he stepped away from the door. Tony didn't wait for what came next.
He turned his head, stumbling in the sand, the sound of blades in the air coming closer. Helicopters! Tony started to wave his arm, shouting, something welling up in his chest. They had been looking for him, they had come, they had actually come!
“Vee?” She trilled gently as she made her way to her usual spot on the table.
"What exactly am I supposed to do?" She looked between Steve and Tony.
Steve lifted the shield up half a second before he was hit with the blast. He peered over the shield and once again saw Tony's blue eyes, looking at him, not brown. Tony lifted the scepter again and Steve lifted the shield again, making a face, knowing he had to try and stop Tony. Hopefully Romanoff's technique on Barton would work.
The kids were cheering behind them, towels wrapped around them again, and they had drawn the attention of the others kids, and their parents. Tony raised one hand and Steve lifted the shield, deflecting the water, then leaned out with his own hose, Tony jumping to the side to avoid it. Tony rolled forward and shot one hose upwards towards Steve's face, and the other down towards Steve's knees. His shield was only able to deflect one shot, but Steve had been ready and shot Tony in the back with water.
"Safe travels," he said before they hung up. Tony listened as the music picked up in volume, and he got up, heading for the hallway. Tony was pretty sure he recognized the song, something that was released earlier in the year. Not a slow song, but it was easy listening, something that would probably be on Tony's guilty pleasures playlist. He stepped out and saw Steve standing there, waiting for him. Tony's mouth dropped a little he heard that it was Steve singing with the music.
Tony glanced over when he saw Mary move from her chair, an ugly phone pressed to her ear, looking around. He thought he heard Steve talking at the table next to them. "Has God heard your little prayer? Will Cinderella dance again?" Tony looked over, watching Steve in his chair, smiling, looking over at Mary. Why did those lines sound familiar?
"I didn't have my own 'Wade' when I was in school." Wade looked up at him with big eyes. "It was just me. But, I went to several different schools, so it was okay. I wouldn't want to make a really good friend only to leave them a few months later."
Steve had been the one to go and explain to the couple who were caring for the twins what had happened, in disguise of course. He was going to have a talk with her later about the elderly couple, but they had agreed to keep the babies with them until she was discharged. He had had to convince them to do it.
“Oh, I still freak out every time I hold him,” Tony slipped in. “I’m just able to hide if better. And he’s older, so he can land on his feet if I accidentally drop him. Like a cat. But, he’s not a cat.” Mary snorted softly. “I can’t believe that anyone, especially you, trusts me with a tiny human.”
Mary had brought a cake for everyone, knowing that Tony had liked the one that she had baked for Peter's birthdays, and that had caused an inquisitive look from Pepper. He knew that he was going to have to have a long talk with Pepper later. Now though, everyone had left, except for Mary and Peter, and Peter was bringing over Tony's present. Tony was sitting on the edge of the couch, waiting for him to come over.
"Just a little sore, nothing I can't deal with," Tony said with a shrug. "What about-"
"Yeah?" Rhodey put down a glass of sparkling apple juice for Tony, who wrinkled his nose a little, but accepted it. It was about as close to alcohol as he was going to get until Mary picked him up the next day. "How do you feel about that?" It had only been four days since Tony had come back home, and while he had had the arc reactor for longer than that, it had only been four days that he had had any time to come to terms with what happened over in the desert.
Tony wasn’t sure how long he had been there, but it had felt like it had been too long. He knew that time was always different when he was sleeping, when he was pulled into what he thought were just nightmares. Now, he had to think differently about it. At the moment, his brain was just a little too muddled to process it.
"Like you're any better!" Steve shot back at Tony with a smile. "He said he liked the stars and you wanted to build a Planetarium on the roof of the Tower."
On board, Tony took off his helmet, glaring daggers at Loki. He could feel Captain America beside him, but the man never took his cowl off, hiding his face. "I don't like it," the man said suddenly.
"No, not at all," Steve said with a shake of his head. He grabbed his own plate from the tray. "He was more worried about you, but he agreed to go out with William and Rachel, so he still had fun. I think Wade had a lot to do with that, too."
“Barton, I’m going to need you calm down,” Steve said turning towards the two. He was pulling out the Captain America voice, spreading his feet a little to take on the stance.
"With all due-" Rachel started, but Steve leveled her with a look that only Captain America can use, and she stopped suddenly.
"This is completely unfair," Tony uttered, putting his hands up in defense. "Your numbers are starting to increase, and it's not fair to the boys in the Tower." The three women looked at him, and he gulped a little. "It's like being hunted by velociraptors," he whispered to himself. "Oh look! A car!" He breathed out when he saw a car pulling up to the curb. It was one of the company cars, so it seemed that Meg had probably talked to Jarvis so she could leave as soon as possible to get back.
"He was in all black, even a black mask. He was wearing it like the color was about to disappear from existence," Tony started rambling out. "He also did a lot of staring, like talking was overrated. And then he, you know, shot me."
“No thanks necessary,” Steve told him seriously. “I should be thanking you, actually. Yours woke me up before mine could really get started.” Tony pulled back a little to look at him. “Don’t know what it would have been this time, but when I woke up I had a familiar heavy feeling in my chest.” He ran his hand through Tony’s hair. “Helping each other, part of this whole, being together thing.”
“So, I’m judging by the lack of nightmares that you’ve done whatever you set out to do?” The engineer asked as he continued to move around the kitchen. He might as well get this over with, and do it while he was marginally more relaxed than last time.
"Yeah, I uh, I guess I did." Tony took a long gulp of his mug. "I mean, yes, I did that, and I'm not taking it back or anything-"
"Kate," Tony said, pointing to one of the ladies in the front. She was from the same station that had interviewed George.
"I kind of had a plan for the next time," Steve said and shuffled his foot on the ground. The elevator stopped at the Penthouse and they walked out, still holding hands.
"I told you, I'm not involved that anything that might have to do with you, unless you're directly involved as well. It just doesn't seem right." He heard Mary give a little sigh and he nodded. "I'll see what I can do."
“Peter, let me get some plates and forks!” Steve cried out in the kitchen and Pepper shot a look at Tony, who was trying not to giggle.
“Mission details confirmed,” the Soldier said, turning to go.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I think the point of a surprise is that they don't tell you what's going to happen. Peter, don't you even think about it." Tony smirked a little. Whatever Peter was about to do, he was all Tony. Mary never failed to remind him of that.
Steve blinked a little. "Is that a good thing?"
"I could not agree more," Tony said, practically flying down the stairs with Steve at his heels.
"Only in the broadest of senses," Tony told him. "I can never remember if I've mentioned this, but I was just that guy who shows up for the first two years of Peter's life. I maybe saw him a grand total of thirty-five times a year. A Year, Steve." He poured in some fresh coffee ground, and grabbed the pot to get water. "I missed out on a lot, and I didn't really learn the basics that well. The most I did was a change a diaper, but I can literally count the number of times I've done that on both hands." He sighed a little and started to coffee maker. "Mary keeps telling me that I'm not allowed to say this to myself anymore, but I really wasn't a great father. But, I stepped up. Took a really shitty reason, but I did it, and I wish I could have kicked my younger self in the ass for wasting those first two years. I'm never getting those back."
“She’s very soft,” Tony said shyly, glancing down at Vee. She bounced a little on her front legs, seeming to smile at him. “I like her, I just wanted to help.”
"Alright, let's all just
"I'm not, but I thought you wanted to try and keep Peter and I out of the press?" Mary asked, knowing that Coulson was watching as they danced.
If I'm going to be late, I'll usually post something up on my tumblr (
"Rogers, we gathered everything related to the tesseract," Fury started to try and explain. Steve narrowed his eyes a little. "This does not mean that we're-"
"Cause I'm special," Peter preened a little, a look of mischief on his face. That look was pure Stark.
"Maybe wait and see what subjects he'll be best at during school," Tony thought out loud, heading back over towards the Mark II armor. "Let's continue with the mobility tests today, J."
"You're not alone, Tony," Mary said from behind him, following him down the hall. Tony turned his head to look at her, then stopped where the hall opened up into the floor, looking at Steve. He could still feel it, still see their bodies, lifeless on that rock. How cold Steve was, watching the light die in his eyes, watching him die. "You don't have to do this alone."
"I do not believe for a second that you've learned all your lessons, and you're suddenly a good little boy," Tony said with a glare directed at the dark haired man. "And what exactly is an Arbiter?"
He threw himself to the ground, crawled over and pulled out his phone. Yes, it was late in the States, but all his mind wanted to do was call Mary, to talk to Peter. He started pressing buttons, stupid country codes, international calling, all the- -thunk-
"Yeah, figured as much," he said with a shrug. "I'm thinking, what, three to five years?"
"The same that you have," Bruce clarified. "That was expected though, as she was created with your blood."
"SHIELD has the scepter now," Steve said quietly. "It's locked up, and the tesseract and Loki are far away."
"Tony, Tony," Obie tried to soothe him like an upset child. "You can't afford to be this naive."
“No, I imagine you don’t. I don’t think the Colonel was in a very good mood when I dropped off his son with him.” Steve was up, pushing the chair back with how fast he moved. “There was a chance that this plan wouldn’t actually work, I was prepared for that. Don’t worry, Captain, we’ll meet again.”
"I'm, looking for something." Tony stopped and closed the drawer he was looking through, fingers coming up to tap out a rhythm on his arc reactor. What was he looking for? "It's too hot in here, too hot." He tried to take a deep breath, but it felt like his lungs weren't expanding enough.
"When do you leave?" Tony asked when he was close enough, the music dropping down just enough to be heard, but he didn't look at Steve.
"I don't mean to make judgments," Steve quickly said, not wanting to make her upset, or offend her.
Peter turned and hugged Mary’s waist tightly and she bent down to kiss his cheeks. “You be good, don’t go wandering off, you know, all the rules I gave you with your grandparents. And remember, you still have to listen to Steve because he’s Captain America, but Captain America still listens to me.”
"You'll find me." Tony nodded, kissing him one more time before pulling away to head down to his workshop. Steve ran a hand through his hair, taking a minute to just breathe.
“Really, Pep?” Tony looked at her and she smiled, bring Jamie back down, holding onto her. “Like she won’t become a big ‘ole nerd like the rest of us.”
"Mary?" Steve thought that maybe he could put a voice to this mysterious Tony, but the voice that he heard was shaken, sounding vulnerable.
"It seems a little big, Sir," Jarvis intoned.
Bucky was waiting on the roof as the quinjet landed, shoulder leaning against the wall. He ignored the looks he got from Clint and Natasha as they walked past him and into doors that led to one of floors designated for the Avengers, and for Coulson and Mary’s work in rebuilding new SHIELD. Steve stepped off the jet and raised an eyebrow when he saw Bucky, pulling his cowl off and rubbing his hair with his hand, shield on his back.
"I felt the Universe move," Tony heard himself whisper, and that only seemed to make Steve smile a little wider.
"Just a little scared when the bad man took me," Peter said quietly, and Tony hugged him a little tighter in his arm. "But, he didn't really hurt me. Then Daddy came, then you came, and you both kept me safe, with Jarvis' help."
"I'm not a Winchester." Obviously. "Plus, if I started doing that I'd have to accept that magic is an actual thing, and that it works under a certain set of rules, and I believe too much in science to do that."
"Why's that, bud?" Steve asked as he held the door open for the him and Mary.
“I am glad to see that there is one who cares for the Man of Iron so well,” Thor said to Steve, moving forward to hold the door open for them. “I think that your stubbornness is good match for him as well. You will probably need to draw from it, as he needs to rest for at least a day after his encounter.”
"You are cruel to me," Tony muttered, as he straightened back out into an adult, and finished his coffee.
"Hey, Pete." William smiled as he took Peter from Tony's arms. "Wanna go back and see Granma now?"
"Fine, but you said silent. So, give me the food and get in here." Steve's smile got a little bigger and he handed over the plate and mug before sliding in before Tony could change his mind. He grumbled a little, but the food was smelling very good. Steve walked to the side, sliding onto the ratty couch that Tony kept down there. Steve picked up a Starkpad by the couch and started scrolling through it, probably looking through the movies.
This Tony, where he didn't feel he had to hide completely, this was who Steve felt drawn, too. Steve knew why they had clashed on the Helicarrier, because they were thrown together in a situation where both hadn't trusted each other, and were both angry about what they had been hiding. Honestly, Steve had been willing to just leave after they had won the battle. He would have helped with the cleanup of the city, then gone back to his apartment, and keep the distance that he and Tony had. Steve was very glad that hadn't work out like that. He figured that he and Tony would clash still, like they had on their second date, but Tony was one to push back when he didn't agree with something. Steve liked the challenge.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, pulling him into his chest, feeling him press back against Steve. "Then talk to me, Tony," Steve whispered back to him. "Just please, talk to someone, I can't watch you go through this much pain, not when I know what it feels like." Tony gripped Steve's shirt in his hands tightly and he let out a shuttered breath. Steve's hand moved up and down his spine, his arms tucking him into Steve's warm body.
Mary laughed as she spun back in to him, taking his other hand. "You said you couldn't dance!" She accused.
"Mama," the little boy whispered. "Mama, he's tall, but he looks nice."
Tony and Meg were watching with rapt attention. “It wasn’t like I wasn’t getting bullied-“
Tony let the man go, taking several steps back, looking at him. If he was anyone else, he'd say that he was looking at Captain America, in the flesh. But this was Tony Stark, and he knew that Captain America had been lost in the War. But that was the vibranium shield that his father had made, there was no question about that, Jarvis' sensors had already analyzed it. The cowl on the man hid any identifying features and Tony was getting mad. Who would dare try to imitate the hero or World War II?
We've come to the end! This is the last chapter to this story, but worry not fine readers, the sequel (Proof of Concept) will follow up quickly, by the weekend. I would like to thank everyone who's read this, who's left kudos and likes, and comments, and followed along on this crazy ride. This is by far one of the longest stories I've written, and it's not done, probably not close. At first this took me out of my regular comfort zone, but I quickly fell in a groove, and everyone responded incredibly. My plans changed several times through out this story, and you guys kept Mary Parker alive. That's right, she was originally not going to survived the first couple chapters of this story, but now, I can't imagine this story without her. Expect more one-shots, more extra fics, and if there is anything that anyone would like to see let me hear about it! (megaranoelle.tumblr.com) I know of one thing coming soon. :D
Footsteps coming down the hall brought Tony's from his thoughts and he saw the three SHIELD Agents coming towards him. Barton was looking better than he had seen him during the battle, but he looked more troubled. Vaguely Tony remembered that Barton had been the one to shoot Mary in her leg. Steve directed Romanoff and Barton to Mary's door. Romanoff gave the archer a look, both having a conversation in seconds, before he went in the room alone.
“You’re wearing glasses,” Steve observed as he set the tray down on a clear (enough) table. Tony leaned in for a quick kiss, then planted a kiss on Jamie’s nose. “When did you get glasses?”
Tony raised both his eyebrows. "Okay, yes, I'm totally down for this game." Tony grinned then motioned with his free hand for Steve to turn in a circle. "Come on, Mr America, turn for me. I need to get a good look before I make my final judgement. And don't spin too fast, I need a good look."
"Three more empty buildings?" Steve asked with a frown, looking over the file.
Steve sneered at him. "Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?"
Tony had to wonder if when normal people said they had 'plans' on Friday, were 'plans' for villains attacking a city? Just after dinner, him and Peter putting the dishes in the dishwasher, Tony was starting to think so when Jarvis sounded an alarm.
Tony turned to face Peter, smiling, then put on a blue ball cap, and some aviator sunglasses. He then reached over, put on some smaller sunglasses on Peter, and a smaller blue ball cap. Peter giggled and smiled. "We match now!"
Mary dropped her bag and coat and flung herself into his path at the last second, putting her hands on his chest when he grabbed her, picking her up instead of trampling her, catching him by surprise. "Captain Rogers, stop!" She called out in the most authoritative, and mom sounding, voice she had. His feet halted on military instinct and he looked at her, setting her back on her feet, ready to bolt again. Mary signaled for the other Agents to stop where they were, never taking her eyes off of Steve Rogers.
“I’ll let Jarvis doing the aiming,” he bit back. The faceplate slid over his head. “Go.” Tony turned towards where Steve was fighting, letting Jarvis take a lot of the controls. “Run scan, J,” he said quietly as the suit landed on two of the AIM agents. Steve glanced over at him, and Tony motioned back towards the car Natasha was running back too. He nodded before he threw the shield again, ricocheting it off of two pillars in the parking garage.
Tony stumbled, almost falling to his face, when the water suddenly disappeared, leaving him standing in the sand of the desert. He covered his eyes from the sun and looked around, then saw two figures a few hundred feet away. "Daddy!" Peter, he was over there.
"I have no record of an invitation, Sir."
Bucky nodded, giving Wade’s shoulder a little squeeze. “The point of the lessons are in hopes that you never have to use it, but so that you’re always prepared.” That’s what Steve had told the kids, and Bucky liked that a hell of a lot better than what he had learned with Hydra. “I’m glad you had the training.”
“Miss Potts approached me last week,” Mary started to explain to Tony. “She had put the pieces together, and well, there really was no point in hiding anything anymore, and we could always use more allies after your Profound four word statement.” Tony was never going to live down coming out as Iron Man. And he had indeed stuck with the name; it was better than Gold Titanium Alloy Man. Although….
“Okay, so, just so I’m getting this right,” Tony said, leaning in towards Peter and Wade again. “We’ve got, Ewan McGregor Kenobi,” he pointed at Peter, “Boba Fett with a lightsaber,” he pointed at Wade, “a time traveling young Luke,” he pointed at Steve, “and the coolest pilot around, Han Solo,” he pointed at himself. At Peter and Wade’s eager nods, and grins, Tony grinned himself. “Bad-ass.”
“Not in the least bit possible,” Tony said and crossed his arms over his chest. “Specially when it comes to a beloved form of entertainment.” Mary let out a little sigh, and added one more pancake to the stack.
"Ah," Mary said, a little wrinkle between her eyes. "I don't think there's any hiding it anymore, not that he was trying to in the first place." Mary grabbed her towel and wiped her forehead, and faced Steve. "Tony is jealous."
Tony turned and grabbed at the man with the shield, arm wrapping around his waist quickly and shooting up, out of the gardens. "Jarvis, where's Pepper?!"
"You hear me?" Tony grunted a little, trying to get up. "You have a missile headed straight for the city."
Tony fidgeted a little, but couldn’t bring himself to look away from her. “I passed out on the workshop couch last week sometime,” he admitted quietly.
"Steve made those, I just iced them," Tony told her. "I can't bake worth a damn. Or cook anything that's not Italian....."
"You should know better than to tempt me like that, Rogers." Tony walked towards his bedroom, schematics of Steve's apartment. "I could easily shift the washers downstairs to make room for a gym. It wouldn't exactly be amazing, but it would have a treadmill."
"And the adults will talk when all little boys go down to sleep," she said with a soft smile. "We live with him for pity's sake!"
"This isn't a typical press conference," Kate shouted above the voices.
Pulling back the covers, Tony gently pulled Peter off of him, laying him down in the middle of the bed. Tony took off his jacket, and shoes, then slid in the bed beside him, pulling the comforter over them, and Peter instantly cuddled back up to Tony, his little hand now over the arc reactor, snuggling against Tony's chest. Tony kissed the top of Peter's head, and wrapped an arm around him. He had no intentions of going anywhere, of leaving Peter ever again.
It was something that Tony had seen when he had jumped out of the plane in the Iron Man armor, as he was flying over the Expo. Even with all the people there, but the lights, the lights made it all make sense. He could barely make it back to the Manor fast enough.
A couple hours later, as he held onto Tony as he slept, he let the smile slowly slip away, mind slipping away into thoughts that he tried to keep buried in the back of his mind. If that’s what Tony really saw, and felt, what was happening? He and Tony were both technically human, no unnatural mutations, at least nothing that the Serum could have caused. So why was Tony literally seeing the universe? It didn’t sit right with Steve. He kissed Tony’s head again, closing his eyes.
Steve looked at Pepper when Tony rattled off words to her. "Non-executive employees fall under an eight step pay grade," Pepper told him quietly, inputting information into her tablet. "Eight is the lowest, and working all the way up to one." Steve blinked. Tony was going to set someone up starting at three steps up?
"You're up front about it, too," Steve said with a chuckle. Tony leaned up a little, trying to catch Steve's lips, but he pulled back just a fraction. "I'll reward you for watching two episodes of this with me."
"I was told to make sure that you were comfortable," Steve said like it should have been obvious. "And I wanted to make sure that you were alright, so it just made sense to bring you here."
"He did that because he wanted to, and because my mother scares him a little." Mary smirked a little. "He let them stay at his place so he could get time with peter as well. It was nice, because it let Phil and I go out on an actual date without interruptions." Mary's phone went off with a text, and she grabbed it form her pocket. "And speaking of dates, I've got one I need to get ready for. Any other questions you have about Tony, are going to be things that you're going to have to ask him about."
“You’re here to do the little paperwork stuff until Dr Cavanaugh comes?” The woman looked up at him, putting on a pleasant smile. She folded her hands over her knee. “Is he not coming? Because a friendly call from the office would have been nice.”
“Why?”
Steve let out a little sigh, knowing he had been defeated by a baby, not even a toddler yet. “Alright, let’s go.” He slipped his hand in with Tony’s, threading their fingers together. He needed this right now.
"I actually like to think of myself as human." Steve brought over Tony's meds and a glass of water for him. He sat down next to Tony, leaning over to kiss him again after he had taken the pills. Tony leaned into the kiss, resting his forehead against Steve's even after their lips broke apart. "How are you feeling?" Steve asked in a soft voice.
A couple days later, Tony saw the impossible.
He took a breath and looked back at Tony. “Doesn’t help that everyone knows we’re together now, almost like projecting our weaknesses.” Steve crossed his arms over his chest. “I’m sorry for putting Peter in possible danger,” he said quietly.
"Save the rest for the turn, J," Tony said quietly. "Steve," Tony let out a breath. "Take care of him."
"I don't like that we haven't heard anything else from the assassin, but I'm going to take no news as good news at this point," Steve said to him, looking back at him. "We're still on guard, and combing through street footage. And I know that they're tracking down the fake company names, so we should have a lead on them, hopefully, soon." He ducked his head down a little, trying to catch Tony's eyes. "There's something else on your mind. You usually wouldn't fret over things like that."
They stepped out of the small room, seeing people scramble about, treating as many people as they could, taking overflow from hospitals, who were only taking seriously injured patients at the moment. Tony saw Steve standing as a doctor left his side. He was only in the blue pants and red boots, a white t-shirt on, and the shield by his feet.
"I'm not overly found of what follows," Loki responded, and both Tony and Steve raised their eyebrows a little. A loud thump, and the quinjet actually lurched. Tony grabbed his helmet and Steve went for his shield. Tony reached up to open the bay doors and Steve frowned, until a man landed on the edge.
"We'll see you soon." Steve nodded at him, and Tony made himself walk away first, heading back over to Bruce and the car.
Steve had been thinking about Bruce's words from breakfast, and it was something that Mary had said months ago as well. He needed to talk to Tony, and it would have been better if he had done it before the battle, before the Hellicarrier even, but he hadn't. Now, Steve had to try and talk to him before the aftermath of the battle happened, before debriefs and the press, and hope that it wouldn't be extremely awkward.
“Is it the same groove that you danced to Justin Timberlake too?” Steve’s face dropped and Tony started to cackle softly. “I so wish that Mary had gotten video of that.”
Tony started to rub his finger in circles under her jaw. "Peter used to think it was a game to not let go of the silverware, too. I started letting go of it and then he'd just let it drop out of his mouth. I had too many sets of kid utensils than was necessary."
“Yup, reminded, now what the hell was that!” Tony growled out a little as he flew lower to see where the metal ball had disappeared too. It hadn’t landed on the ground, there were no screaming bystanders, no smoke, or horns honking outside of regular traffic, and no metal ball. There was another impact above him, and another vibration, and when he looked out he saw another ball, but this was bigger. Tony shot out of the way as it fell past him, barely missing hitting him dead on.
"Nope," Peter shook his head, getting down from Tony's lap, though. "He said he's going to be here all weekend."
"Unofficially," Meg corrected. "I do it under duress."
"Both times involving Wade?" Steve guessed, and Mary nodded.
"Engage Heads Up Display," Tony said, watching the blue lights appear in his vision, the camera coming online to give him a full view of the garage, instead of only what he could see through the eye holes. "Import all preferences from home interface." Jarvis confirmed as Tony looked around, taking his first few steps on the ground. "Alright, what do you say?"
"Hi," the boy said a little shyly. "My name is Peter, it's nice to meet you."
"I assume there's information?" Steve glanced at the watch on his wrist. He'd only been asleep for about three hours.
“No it’s nooooot,” Peter said. His growling stomach proved otherwise, and Peter only giggled as Tony rolled his eyes with a smile. “It’s gonna eat everyone!”
"He's going to up looking like Tony's little twin in no time," Mary said as she put Peter down on his feet, slipping the box of snacks from his hands. Peter looked up at her with a pout, until he noticed that Mary was opening the box, pulling out one little pouch and handing it to him. He beamed a grin at her, giving the expected 'Thank You', before ripping into it. "Tony has a business function tonight, and apparently he remembered me saying that Peter needed a haircut soon, so he picked him up on the way."
"I'm actually kind of wishing that I had brought that drink over here with me," Tony mumbled, then turned to face Mary. She slipped from sitting on the arm of the couch to sitting on the other end of the couch from him. Tony didn't like that.
“I can handle Peter and Wade, together, at the same time, in Disneyland,” Tony said. “I think that handling three babies, that are so close to nap time, won’t be much of a problem.”
"Not a bodyguard," Steve quickly amended. "I talked to Natasha, Clint, and Bruce, and we all decided that someone should go with you, to represent the Avengers."
“I thought that she would never tell anyone else that story,” Steve muttered.
"There is so much going on, you're right," Tony retaliated. "There is another child involved in this, and you stepped up to take up the mantle!"
"I like it when you're here, Mr Steve," Peter said, looking at him from on top of Tony's chest. Tony shot Steve a knowing smirk.
"So, deadly force is not ruled out," Black Widow stated more than asked.
"Why are you looking at me? I'm no one's Handler," she hissed at Steve. "I just had the bad taste in men."
Steve frowned but held up his phone again, pressing Tony’s phone between his ear and his shoulder. He opened up the first app in the social media folder that Tony showed him. It was also set up to show any alerts regarding the Avengers, Tony, and himself.
“Currently teaching Jamie the importance of blueberry pancakes,” Steve threw in. “Wade is helping, by eating the demonstration ones.”
“You were given an option.” Tony tried to squirm, needing to pull away, to get away from the familiar voice. He could feel The Other behind him, then felt the grip of its hand closing around the side of his neck. “Now, we will take what we want.” His arms were pushed down on whatever he was lying on, palms facing up. He frowned when he felt something sharp just pressing against his skin, at the base of his palms. “You should be so lucky,” the voice hissed down by his ear. “He’s going to enhance you, again.”
He looked up, back in space, but now, someone was walking towards him. Tony's feet started to push himself backwards against the ground, hands still chained, unable to get up in time. It wasn't a who, it was a thing, covered in golden armor, a dark hood pulled over its grotesque face. It moved faster than Tony, and a grey hand with one too many fingers reached down and grabbed onto Tony's shirt, hauling him to his feet.
“I’m saying that you didn’t try that hard. I’m saying that you might be responsible for the passing of two of Steve’s beloved companions.”
"That means you're a smart man, Rogers." Tony twirled the tablet in his hands a little. "Listen, since you've trapped me here and asked me to spill why things make me uncomfortable, you gotta do me a favor now." Steve raised an amused eyebrow. "Peter is no doubt going to want to go swimming with Wade at some point. It may not be today, may not be tomorrow, but it's going to happen." Steve nodded. The boys had wanted to go to the beach or the pool a lot last summer. "So, you get to take them swimming."
“Plan on it,” Tony nodded. “You’re an angel, Pep. But I’m going to get back to three of my favorite people now….. Because Peter decides to buy the entire Lego store.”
"Nuh uhn," Peter said, shaking his head, and Tony glanced down at him. "You have to have imagination to think of what you want that to look like. You made up the Tower on your own." Tony gave Peter a small smile and kissed his cheek.
"Yes, that's exactly what I want you to do!" Mary said over Peter's laughing. "See, now it's not stuck to your leg anymore."
“Please, Mr Steve??” Peter turned large puppy brown eyes up at the man. Tony knew he was doomed.
"He's still just a baby, Bruce," Tony whined a little. "He went into the war at drinking age, for fucks sake, and then he never really, left the war. He fell in the ship, and he came out here, and I'm sure Mary did what she could, and then he was suddenly Captain America again when Loki came, and he's never been able to grow up."
"I don't know Tony, and I'm not going to start accepting things from him just because you tell him about me. He's your boyfriend, and he'll do anything for you."
"Never said I was going too," Steve replied. "I'm expecting you to help me out with that," he gave him a smile. Bucky's eyes widened a little. "That means, you're going to have to learn how to hold a baby. I know where there are two that you can practice with, I'm pretty sure you live with them."
"Can Mr Steve come, too?" Peter asked and Tony blinked.
Mary held onto Peter as they sat in the back of the limo, running her hands through his hair as they watched the little TV of the press conference. Tony had been whisked away by more agents, SHIELD as they had come up with now, and poor Peter hadn't even been able to speak to him. They had both barely gotten any sleep, but Coulson had assured them that Tony was awake now, and doing fine.
"Mary did warn me that I would probably be buying a lot of clothes," Steve said. Tony was resting his arms on the bar of a flatbed, and he blinked, not even aware that Tony had gone off to acquire one.
Hello lovely people! This chapter was finished about five minutes before it was posted, because all the characters in here decided to hijack it and turn it into nothing that I had planned. Good news is the name of this chapter though!
Tony chuckled and smiled at him. "I don't think that Daddy knows why that's so important," Mary said as she helped Peter cut his pancakes. "Why don't you tell him?"
“You have put a lot of work into this.” Tony smiled at him, pushing the tablet on the couch, and wrapped an arm around Steve’s neck. “I like when you’re prepared.”
"But he works for SHIELD," Steve said, picking up a folder from the coffee table. Romanoff had gotten him a copy of Tony Stark's file from the SHIELD database. When he looked at the picture inside, he couldn't believe that it had taken him this long to figure it out. He should have been paying more attention.
“There’s a chance,” Tony said with a nod. “Since Bruce is very familiar with what they’re using, we’re working on a counter-active agent.” Tony could stop right there, and not continue. If it wasn’t for Bruce’s fire like gaze digging into the back of his skull. Honestly, he had been trying to ignore the test results that he had been given a few days ago by Bruce. “You should totally let us get some blood samples from you, Cap, so we can work on that.”
“You do this often, don’t you?” Bucky asked the ten-year-old. “You seem like the type who likes to throw himself into stupid situations.”
"It's counts, because we could have had food before we fell asleep," Steve countered, handing an empty plate to Tony, before started to load up his own. The food did smell delicious, and he could see a bit of Tony's Italian side in the food, as well as Marcello's own influence, and Pierre's in the desserts.
"Andes mints, kicking babies, and video games." She nodded. "Did Steve mention that I have a nephew? Because I have a nephew, and my brother-in-law tells me how to tame the wild four-year-old. So I have a little bit of an advantage here."
When he slipped out of Peter's room, leaving the door open a little, nightlights in the hall and the bedroom, he saw Rhodey there, leaning against the wall. They headed down the hall, towards the living room. "Your Doctor got out, alright." Tony had called one of his personal physicians, offered him half a million dollars if he could get to Tony's place in the next fifteen minutes to help with Peter. "He okay?" Rhodey asked his friend. He had seen him shaken up, probably more shaken than Peter had been.
"I don't remember it being that easy," he replied. "This guy packs a wallop."
"You think Fury's hiding something?" Steve asked. He shouldn't be surprised that this was what Tony was saying.
Tony tumbled to the ground, fighting back the dizziness in his head, and tried to push himself back up. A hand gripped his arm and hauled him to his feet, making his head spin. “Mr Stark, we have need of you.” He looked towards the voice, the person holding him up, and nothing could stop the yellow color even through his double vision. Wade and Peter were shouting from the car as another AIM agent was opening the back door.
"Sorry, I just, Peter," Tony breathed before letting go of Steve and running for the exit. He was aware that Steve was following behind him, and a little bit of warmth lit up in his chest. Tony opened the door and saw that Wade was sitting up in the bed, arms wrapped around Peter, who was lightly crying into the older boys shirt. Big brown eyes looked up at Tony as he and Steve slid into Peter's room and Tony was already moving to sit on the edge of the bed.
"Give Peter our love," her dad said as he hugged her. "Have a good day, Mr Stark." Tony smiled at her parents, giving them a nod as they left, Mary closing the door, letting out a little sigh.
Unbeta'd as usual, and Marvel owns more than me. Songs and TV shows/Movies referenced don't belong to me either.
Steve walked over and turned Jamie then set her down on her feet in front of Peter, holding onto her hands to keep her up. She tilted her head up to look at Peter and grinned. Jamie tried to pull her hands away from Steve to make grabby hands at Peter. That pulled an
Tony looked at him, before narrowing his eyes a bit. "How did you make that connection?"
Mary blinked and looked at Steve. "It was Howards' son, I didn't stay on the channel."
"Are you attached to this city?" Tony asked suddenly. "Anything particularly keeping you here? Anyplace you've ever thought about living in before?"
"Even villains take the days off on Sundays, so I'm thinking the 25th," Coulson continued, highlighting the day.
"Does his mother not want you around?" Yinsen asked he moved the marble pieces, handing the cup and dice over to Tony and taking his own water mug.
“Um, do you think that maybe I could call him something like that, too?” Tony’s brain stalled when Peter asked his next question. “Because, he’s really nice, and you love him, kind of like how Mama and Phil love each other, and he’s always looking out for me, and helping me, just like you. And you two are going to stay together for a long time, because you love each other, and it doesn’t matter if you get married right away-”
Loki sounded very put-upon, burdened.
"Because dating is loose and free," Mary said matter-of-factly. "You know, like I do, that dating someone can end easily. More easily than a marriage can." Tony snorted softly. "Usually marriage means that someones serious about something."
"I've always been on Team Steve," Natasha said. "I've worked with him before, and I only spied on you." Tony gave her a little sneer. "But, with what I know about both of you, you'd work well together. You two would never be bored, that's for sure." She looked at him and shrugged a little, before turning on her heal and walking out. Tony sighed and looked back at Mary.
'Tony Stark's Lover Speaks Out On Heroic Act'
“James, apparently, since he’s denouncing his nickname.” Steve’s foot kicked into Bucky’s. “He was here to get the boys while I took my fella on a surprise get-a-way.” Izzie hummed a little, smiling at Bucky, who just quirked his eyebrow a little.
"Hydra was sending people to watch anyone you had contact with." Steve looked over when Bucky started talking again. "I," Bucky paused for a second. "I remembered her.
“I’m already aware of that, it’s okay,” Steve assured him.
"How'd it go?" He glanced at Obie, then saw the pizza sitting on the table. "It went that bad, huh?"
“I’m taking this as support for the Army,” Bucky said, grabbing his own bottle of water.
“Shit,” Tony raced for a tablet, finding one just by the couch, and started typing on the screen. “This was planned, and it was so underhanded that even I didn’t see it. I at least didn’t anticipate something for another day or two.”
“Whoever got into my systems planted one nasty virus, tailored just for J, and about a dozen data mining bugs.” Steve frowned a little as he kept down and paced the wall, finding a spot, then easily vaulted over.
"I don't know, I'm assuming the arc reactor technology." Tony shrugged. He hated spies being spies, never just saying what they were thinking. "I haven't been able to pull anything from his notebooks, though, nothing that I didn't already know."
"Can't say that I won't be glad to have them around," Tony nodded. "Now we're just missing our favorite Demi-God and it'll be a full reunion."
“Aside from the fact that I had already seen her through the hundreds of photos and videos on Sir’s phone, I can see her perfectly well. Thank you, Captain,” JARVIS answered primly, but Tony could almost hear the appreciation in his English voice.
Hovering over a few more tabs, Steve noticed that there was a gap in the pictures and the next that followed were from the age of twenty-one years onwards, the time Tony became Stark Industries CEO. He didn’t have to look closer to see that they were outlandish, scandalous even, some scribbled with ‘Merry Christmas from Tony Stark’ with a gaudy kiss mark at the end. He’d seen those before. They usually came up every slow season or so when journalists were in the mood to dig up Tony’s explosive and controversial bachelor days.
“HA!” Bucky exclaimed instead and stopped at that. And honestly, only Steve, Thor and him had room to talk regarding height in the team and Natasha would probably kill them if they said something unflattering.
Steve explained. “Gail heard Tony over the phone when he was cursing his engineers and she didn’t take it lightly, ripped him a new one. He’s trying to be more… creative and family-friendly.”
Steve chuckled. “JARVIS is right. You’ll all get a turn soon, okay?”
The Tower had been decorated from basement to penthouse in all manners of yuletide décor, and employees could be seen in costumes, ugly sweaters, and Santa hats. There was even a Tower-wide Secret Santa for the employees, while hot chocolate, hot apple cider, and candy canes were made available in all the breakrooms and lobbies.
Clint was rarely rendered speechless and flushed. Everybody laughed. He punched Bucky on the arm, but Bucky just kissed his shoulder with a grin.
“MOVE!” The man shouted.
“He’s fine, DUM-E,” Steve said, shifting the bottle. “She’s just too little so we have to be careful not to let the bottle press on her. See?”
Through the doorway, Steve could see Bruce’s side profile. He was standing in front of Julia’s photo wall and holding one of Julia’s toys, a Hulk plush toy that was part of an Avengers toy series Tony had SI make exclusively for Julia. Bruce was looking at the wall where Tony had put up the latest photo the minute they all got home from the parade.
“Surprisingly, no,” Da stressed, rolling his eyes at Peter. “We rarely get time off, so now we’re actually on our honeymoon!”
“Tony, I don’t want to spend the next few months with this weird tension,” Steve argued. “And maybe they’d have ideas for their photos. We won’t get away with just taking candids of everyone. Honestly, Natasha might probably pick or plan her photo anyway.”
Because Tony had that really telling hitch in his voice when he said the word surprises, with an –s.
“Is it something gross?” Clint groaned, covering his eyes. “You two are so gross.” He ended up with toast thrown at his forehead courtesy of Tony.
“Oh, yeah!” Peter perked up. “Da, you added the new VR console to the exhibit! The one we made!”
“Email,” Bruce said simply.
“I’m doing okay, thought I’d say hi,” Wade spoke through the face mask. His bright blue eyes were smiling behind his glasses. “And to thank you both again for all your help with the sponsorship and the scholarship.”
Tony shrugged, waving his phone in front of Julia so she stopped concentrating on tummy time. “Yeah, Rhodey knows. He doesn’t mind. He gets it.”
Clint made a stink face at them. “Like I said, keep all that ickyness where you won’t nauseate the masses.” He tossed a handful of pretzels into his mouth.
Dr. Pius was at the reception area when they arrived. He was as old as ever and Tony thought it was so weird that the old man could soothe babies as well as he did, much less carry them.
“Yep,” Tony turned to Steve and Steve just had to kiss him on the cheek in encouragement, “And Steve and I agreed that not only are you getting the first picture in our baby book, you are going to get the first picture
“You’re telling me,” Tony grumbled.  “I planned it to the last detail, and what do you people do? Thor and Jane suddenly decide on a romantic getaway and you’re only available this weekend and won’t be able to spend Christmas here. You people suck.”
There was a fine trembling in Tony’s form and he looked down, fingers of one hand hooking against the collar of Steve’s shirt. He was silent for a long while, but Steve was patient and pressed a kiss to his temple every once in a while.
For now, Steve was thankful and content.
“Yep, it was Tony’s idea.”
Pops nodded, eyes still trained on the dangerous man. “Good job, Peter. We’ll take it from here.”
“Your doctor’s appointment is today, right?” Phil asked.
SHIELD received a tipoff about shady activity in Norilsk, Russia and decided the information was sound enough to warrant sending out a team. It required undercover work and fluency in Russian, which was why Bucky and Natasha went up to bat. Phil went along as their handler since he had pretty passable Russian and was the only SHIELD agent Bucky willingly worked with.
“Shut up. Sleep,” Tony mumbled. “Love you.”
Steve looked down, both surprised and not when he saw a tiny figure by his feet. Julia had recently started crawling and she was learning fast. All the Avengers knew to be cautious in case they suddenly found a baby underfoot.
“Don’t exaggerate,” Tony scoffed, trying not to melt against his husband in a mush of love. “It’s not that many.”
Tony gasped loudly. “Did she just– Was she– Did she just ooh in awe at Rhodey?”
“Her tears are very unsettling,” Thor added in agreement. “I find most children’s tears to be the case, but hers are most troubling to hear.”
[Image 3: Gail and Juliana are curled up in bed with Gail reading a sleepy Julia her bedtime story. Juliana’s mobile is seen hanging over their heads.]
Steve rolled his eyes, “For your information, the first phone I ever got was from SHIELD before Tony gave me a Starkphone, and the first person I ever called was Phil.” He grinned. “The first text message I ever got was from Tony though.” He turned to Tony. “I still have it.”
Peter beat a hasty retreat, thanking his lucky stars that Pops was in the room to distract Da. He waited in the hall for the elevator, shifting on his bare feet and picking at the hem of his t-shirt nervously.
In reply, the three started moving even more frantically. But they still kept their distance.
“There you go, baby. All done.” Dr. Pius put on the last band-aid and leaned back. “Go on pick her up. She's done.”
“Do you have one, Tony?”
“Come here, you.” Steve leaned down and swooped his daughter in his arms, peppering kisses all over her chubby cheeks. She screeched and giggled wildly.
Darcy slapped him on the head. “Don’t be mean. And when Thor gets depressed, it’s like trying to hug a jellyfish, squishy but sends my hair standing.” She turned to Steve. “And second point, Cap, you and Iron Dad aren’t planning on inducting junior-ette into the family business?”
“Next time – though god forbid there would be a next time – I would appreciate a text or a call. I was really worried, you know.”
“I… I guess that’s fine,” Tony finally murmured, still so disbelieving.
But it was true. JARVIS talked to their baby sometimes, and Julia heard his voice a lot, especially when she was with Tony. JARVIS also talked to Juliana whenever she had those crying episodes and Steve was too hoarse to keep reading to her and Tony kind of wanted to cry himself. Tony called those Juliana’s crazy time. Bruce and all the paediatricians in the world called it colic. Steve just wanted Tony to stop calling their baby crazy.
Steve shrugged, diverting. “You were good-looking even as a kid.”
Julia was dressed in a long-sleeved bodysuit designed to look like a penguin costume, complete with flipper feet and a black hoodie with pompom hair. She looked far too cute for words. Her playpen was a few feet away in front of the couch and she couldn’t have gotten out on her own if it wasn’t for the curly-haired man hiding behind the couch, peering from a distance.
As if in reply, Juliana let out a raspberry.
“Can’t help it.” Steve smiled. “You’re so good with her.”
Tony met his eye and then glanced away. “I just invited your best friend. Why you getting so sappy? Jeez.” The fingers of one hand wrapped around Steve’s wrist. “…Love you too.”
Steve smiled. “She has a favorite napping spot now, and that’s on Dada or Poppa’s chest. Two minutes in and she was out like a light. Come in.” He grabbed a clean rag and tried wiping as much charcoal from his fingers.
“So this is some seize the opportunity thing,” Bucky asked, listening in.
Now that he was caught, Tony tried to save his own skin.
“There you go, my love,” Tony cooed as he settled Julia on a nursing pillow in the space between them. The grass was soft under the blanket and while the weather was pleasantly sunny, they were settled under a tree to give Julia some shade.
“Oh, did the agents get the Thank You cards Tony and I sent for all the presents?” Steve asked, reading through the files on hand. “Sitwell? Klein? Hill? Fury?”
Tony seemed fine with that, or he was sleeping with his eyes awake… again.
of their child, so she knew her body better than anyone and no one was going to get her to change her mind.
“Yes, marshmallow?”
Bucky hummed under his breath. “Ah, I get it. Guess that’s why you and Tony can relate.”
Bucky held her in his arms on instinct, swiftly switching her to his flesh and blood arm instead of the cool metal one. Steve could remember how stiff and scared Bucky was the first time Steve made him carry her, protesting that his metal arm was cold and could hurt her or pinch her. Now it was like second nature.
Julia erupted into giggles and blew a loud raspberry at her face, making Gail laugh.
Tony snapped his fingers. “Hey! Hey! Hey! Hello! I’m talking here!”
Bruce just looked amused. “Yes, Tony? Do you need something?”
Steve perked up, the question almost tripping over his tongue, but after almost a year of beating around the bush, two years of dating, and then two years of being married to him, Steve was practically an expert on Tony-speak. Tony kept fiddling with the contraption, but by the way he was moving, he was obviously tinkering with it just for something to do.
Bruce had fashioned the body of the mobile, made of slim dark green metal with sprockets on the ends to symbolize machinery and had made sure that each hanging item was secure and there would be no potential choking hazards. Everybody else contributed small charms and trinkets to hang from it. Natasha, who turned out to be good at calligraphy, wrote a Russian verse on a piece of framed glass– Каждый кузнец своего счастья. Bucky built in a few little tinkling bells. Clint poked fun at the project, but he ended up working hard on his – taking the parts of a broken hearing aid, painting it yellow, and sticking it into a plastic coin that was painted like a starry sky. Phil knitted a little secret agent out of soft yarn and wool. Rhodey had airplane charms on his, while Pepper and Happy brought a colorful pair of baby screwdriver and baby wrench.
“Pepper? Pepper, it’s Steve.” Steve glared again at Tony, who was pushing at Steve’s legs and rearranging them to who knows what.
“Wooh!” Juliana exclaimed again, pursing her lips cutely.
Steve bid the mother-daughter good night and took his husband to their room. After completing their nighttime routines, he and Tony got into bed, facing one another and Tony snuggling against Steve’s broad chest.
“Don’t let it get to your head. I’m pretty sure even then, you knew just how good-looking you were,” Steve said, handing DUM-E back his photo. “Me at seventeen was,” he waved a hand, laughing a little, “short, skinny, couldn’t even walk without tripping or breathe without coughing afterwards, and definitely not the kind of ladies’ man in high school compared to how you were in college.”
“What’s what?” Steve asked.
[Video: Tony shouting at DUM-E to stop running around and around in excitement. Tony shouting at U when he bowled over the party hats. Tony shouting at Butterfingers to stop moving the podium around. In the background, the holographs were turning on and off.
“Okay. Who gets to hold her first?” she asked.
“Welcome back, guys,” Steve said, as Jane let out her own greetings and Tony gave a lazy wave.
“Oh my g– TONY!”
Bucky didn’t even acknowledge that, but Steve had the utmost confidence Bucky would be careful.
And if Tony also secretly cuddled with his daughter and that soft,
As expected, Thor ended up engaging in a massive, thunderous sulk at finding out he had missed Gail… for the umpteenth time.
Steve chuckled a little wetly and a lot overwhelmed. He could see a peek of dark hair on the little head resting against Gail’s chest and he was so excited. But he and Tony had talked about this and Tony already had his phone in hand. He put away the bouquet on a nearby vase. He had to resist reaching for the bundle in Gail’s arms, because once he did, he wasn’t letting go.
Then the screaming suddenly started.
In Pops’ words, goddammit.
“It’s been pretty quiet, but we both know it’s not going to stay that way,” Phil said gently.
“Everything's okay, baby,” Steve said, face buried in her hair and holding onto her fist. Tony grabbed the other flailing one and rubbed it.
Steve walked over so Tony didn’t have to sit up. He took it with a murmur of thanks and sat by Tony’s hip as he opened it. Steve tugged the twine away and unwrapped the package. Once he saw the present, he paused, breath catching in his throat.
Pepper smiled a bit bashfully, a rare sight for her. “So I thought I wanted something hanging up on that photo wall of yours in the nursery. I sent JARVIS copies and took the liberty of having this one framed the same way you framed the ones already in Julia’s room. You’re welcome.” She squared her shoulders, as if she was thinking they’d decline. As if they would.
And honestly, he liked the energy this event had compared to all those stiff galas and dinners he and Tony had to attend for Stark Industries. People here were friendly and passionate and so excitable. Plus, he didn’t have to wear a suit, unlike some of the announcers and the reporters. He was comfortable in a dark blue t-shirt with Captain America’s shield on it, and a really spiffy and comfortable black jean jacket with jeans and boots.
Tony scoffed, affecting an air of incredulity. Yet Steve could see the shake in his shoulders. “Brothers? Um, cupcake, honey bunch, husband of mine, we only have one child, unless you’re hiding some tyke from me. And while I lived the fast and furious lifestyle in my youth, I have been intensely lucky enough not to sire any offspring.” He waved a hand at Steve. “Unless you’re referring to Barton and Barnes in all their childishness, then okay, yeah, we can call them Julia’s brothers.”
“I’m being a good role model,” Tony sniffed, glaring when Clint snorted.
“I’m okay now,” Steve said, leaning forward until he could press a soft kiss to Tony’s lips.
So yes Tony was nervous, because this was a tiny,
(In the privacy of their room, Tony admitted to Steve that he was relieved Loki didn’t touch the thing. Steve secretly agreed with him. Last they heard, the magic that had seemed to ensnare and corrupt Loki into attacking Earth had been purged from him, but magic did not grow strong without intent, so he was still kept under heavy guard in Asgard.)
“Yes, my darling breadstick, because, and here comes point number three,” Tony held up three fingers, “Pepper is more likely to tell you the truth than tell me, because three point one, you’re Captain America. Three point two, you’re Steven Rogers. And three point three, you cannot lie to save yourself, you really can’t, peppermint.”
Peter ignored Wade, who didn’t seem to be following after him. At least someone he cared about was safe.
“–Oooooor?” Tony grinned teasingly. Steve hid a smile behind his hand. Tony was like a spoiled kid in the candy store, knowing he’d get his way soon enough.
[Image: Bruce is cradling a large, silver metal pot. Juliana is inside the pot, dressed in a Thanksgiving themed tutu and a crochet turkey cap. Julia is looking up at Bruce with a big smile, one hand clutching Bruce’s glasses. Bruce is laughing so hard, pink-cheeked and teary-eyed.]
“I know, and I love them and they’re great. They’re just…” he sighed. “They can be embarrassing sometimes.”
And yes, they were even considering their daughter doing some interplanetary meet-and-greets. This was the kind of life they had now.
Clint.’ Phil is munching and popcorn beside Natasha, who is trying to kick Clint from the other seat, while Darcy is pouting and is taking a marker to the last three words. Thor, Jane, and Bruce are on the other couch, watching the TV off view of the camera, with Thor eating a four-pizza-sandwich and Bruce explaining something to Jane about what they were watching.]
“Yep!” Tony patted Bruce’s cheek. “There are a bunch of us so good thing we have about eight more months to go. That’s about a thousand more pictures to take. Pep hijacked her own thing and Steve had to take a candid of dinosaur Barnes over there because he’s allergic to cameras–”
DUM-E clicked his claws and U waved the camera. Tony patted them on the strut distractedly, answering in automatic.
“Uh-oh.” Steve mumbled. He turned to see Phil rubbing his temples, obviously already anticipating a headache.
Steve pulled out a pair of red briefs with gold trim and then hastily put it away, red staining his cheeks. Yeah, that one was particularly memorable.
“Fine. Fine. You got me all dirty already anyway, and I guess I can waste a little time on you.”
They cheered at that.
Natasha thought about it. “Their eyes,” she said simply without any explanations.
Wade being there was also a bonus. He was fun, smart and he was actually very personable. Peter knew Wade struggled a lot with his appearance and how people acted around him, but the other SI scholars were good people and they weren’t put off by his looks.
“Considering that this is a social visit, the Air Force might start making noise if he stays here for too long,” Phil mused, frowning. “Maybe I should check–”
The stall behind Peter suddenly exploded and he cried out when he felt his back burn.
“I find, Captain Rogers, that children are usually so much stronger than their parents.” Dr. Pius laid the syringes and band-aids down the table in a line. Tony was a little amused to see they were purple with yellow stars on them.
“If you noticed, I was busy with our baby.” Steve flicked him lightly on the shoulder at that. “And I’m just processing it. You mean you want Bucky for Julia’s third month baby photo?”
Tony snorted, and before he could say something self-deprecating, Steve leaned over and kissed him on the mouth. Oh, but Tony tried, he did, the stubborn man murmuring something against Steve’s lips. He relented eventually and kissed back lazily.
Tony beamed. “Of course I did, kiddo. I’m super proud of the work you did on that. Plus your grades were all topnotch this sem, of course I was gonna add it in.” He smacked a kiss to Peter’s forehead, who flushed and then tried to kick MJ on the shin for getting that on video.
Wade shrugged. “I figured your dads got you out of there immediately. And I saw the news, but I didn’t expect those.” He motioned to the wounds.
There was a soft cry and their little bubble was broken when Juliana started fussing even more.
“Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool – he’s a gamer, honey, a really good one too,” Tony explained as Pepper did the introductions. “Stark EG scouted him three years ago and he's one of their sponsored gamers competing in this year’s e-sports tournament. He’s actually pretty popular and,” his voice lowered, “Petey-pie’s a fan.”
“Knock, knock.” She smiled and then lowered her voice at the sight on the couch. “Oh, I didn’t know the little darling was asleep.”
They got out some of the donuts, and Peter grabbed them some soda from the fridge before they started talking.
It was Bruce who had first noticed the magazine, snatching it up and bringing it to the dining area where everyone was gathered for breakfast. Natasha had teased him about it, but had looked a few times over his shoulder at the pages.
“Rhodey’s not taking off the armor,” Natasha said, gun still at the ready.
Steve sighed as Natasha’s lip quirked and Phil rolled his eyes.
Peter came running through the doors in full force, Ned and MJ at his heels and VIP passes swinging from their necks. He was in a red and white sports jacket, a black shirt which looked like one of Tony’s band shirts, skinny jeans, and white sneakers with plaint splatters on it that Steve decorated and gave him for getting all As last semester. That was part of his and Tony’s condition to allow him and his friends to come to this event.
Tony blinked. “Er. That was supposed to be a surprise. Dammit.”
Tony turned to Julia, wiping her drool-covered hand and face with a bib.
Juliana let out a small smile and Tony couldn’t help smiling back. He’d been doing that a lot the past few weeks, months even. These days, all the nosy journalists or the fans could capture were pictures of his smiling face. It was glorious.
“Okay, okay,” Tony said, waving his hands at them. “Come on and meet the new addition to the family.”
Steve snorted. “Gee, thanks, honey.”
So Peter resolved to enjoy the other male’s company as much as possible. Peter was going back to school in a few weeks and Wade had college to think about, so they weren’t going to be seeing much of one another after this.
Natasha sat down on the couch, shoving Tony’s feet aside. Phil collapsed on the loveseat close to Jane. Bucky immediately splayed out on the floor. Steve took a moment to check him over, but there were no injuries as far as he could see.
“Tony, Steve, what’s that?”
“What the hell?” Wade jolted.
Now here they were.
Before they could even start another round of fighting and decision-making though (cue groaning and growling from the Avengers), they found the perfect baby. Or rather, their baby found them.
Phil groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I am going to make some calls.” He glared at the Tony. “And I’m going to call Pepper first.”
Once he saw it, Tony grinned, wobbly and sweet. “I told you so. Told you Hap and Pep are using our kid for a trial run.” Pepper rolled her eyes at that, smiling.
Immediately, all three bots wheeled back, claws clicking and beeping in low volume. Butterfingers had dropped the edge of the blanket in his claws and kept waving his arm.
“Can’t blame her. You look like a horror show,” Clint said, poking Tony on the forehead. Far too drowsy, Tony lolled back, but was saved from falling over thanks to Bruce tugging him forward.
“Thanks, Phil. I appreciate this.” Steve looked up. “How about that request…”
Tony took out the green bottle in his jacket pocket. It was part of a set of the most adorable colorful newborn baby bottles from Rhodey – one among Juliana’s many, many, many presents from her many, many, many godparents, aunts, uncles, and admirers. The bottles were small and carried only a few ounces of milk, perfect for small tummies. Each one came with a cap and a long, stretchy cord because Rhodey knew Tony was probably going to lose them unless they were attached to his person.
For now, he had a hungry, fussy baby and an even hungrier supersoldier to feed.
First Time Tag.
“Ooh!”
“Um…” Wade glanced over at Peter. “If Peter wants?”
“Are you going by Mom, Mama, or Mommy?” Steve asked, twitching a little when he noticed a tiny hand and even tinier fingers moving. Beside him, Tony seemed to be just as twitchy and transfixed.
“Your paternity leave is coming to a close soon,” Phil said. “You’ll be going to SHIELD HQ regularly, which is a good thing let me tell you.” He grinned. “Some of the agents have been asking after you, Tony, and Juliana, while the new recruits that came in over the past months were disappointed to hear that Captain America and Iron Man weren’t dropping by headquarters due to paternity leave.”
Steve sighed.
“Juliana, baby, Julia, how could you do this?” Tony whined. “How could you betray me like this, my love?”
“Of course I did,” Tony huffed. He tossed a handful over Phil’s head. “Confetti goes well with surprises.”
Bruce just looked amused. “Yes, Tony? Do you need something?”
So honestly, there was no other choice for Steve.
“I think she wants you,” Steve said, when Julia’s cries weren’t soothed.
Steve noticed the mischief in Tony’s eyes, and kissed his cheek, shushing him. Tony huffed and pouted.
“Of course you can,” Steve said, and he was looking at Tony, with a lot of love and a lot of understanding and Tony averted his eyes, not because he wanted to hide it from Steve. God knows Steve knew more about him and his issues than any person in the entire world. He just didn’t want to get emotional right now. Their baby was already crying. If Steve started getting all misty-eyed, Tony was going to cry, Dr. Pius was going to bring it up at every appointment, and the Avengers would
“Hey, watch it,” Rhodey said, though the edge of his lip twitched.
The project was still in its infant stages – ha, made a pun! – but Tony already had a few designs laid out. He and Pepper wanted a complete line out by Juliana’s first birthday. For now though, Juliana got dibs, like the car seat Tony had personally designed and made.
Two days later and the happening in Greece was still on the news. Peter was relieved that the mess was so sudden and surprising that there weren’t any cameras around to catch him in action – though he had a feeling Da, JARVIS, and SHIELD might have also had something to do about that. Only the intervention of Iron Man and Captain America made the news.
Darcy turned to Steve, ruby red lips pouting. “Okay, first of all, you know Thunderbae’s going to freak that he and Gail managed to miss each other… for the gajillionth time.”
“That’s so good, baby girl!” Steve reached for her, always so proud of whatever his baby did.
listen to his gut.
Juliana was babbling cutely, one hand pressed to her mouth and drooling on it and the other waving at Tony imperiously.
Steve grinned and walked away, whistling. Today was going to be a good day.
Steve smiled. He placed the toy chest to the side. He could put that away later. Bruce probably knew he was there, but Steve thought it was a good idea to give the man some space and privacy.
Peter’s eyes darted around and, with quick calculations and a prayer on his lips, he fired a web and dug his heels in. The web caught an already crumbling wall ahead of the attacker, and Peter tugged as hard as he could, sending it toppling over the man’s head. He jogged forward, trying to find the man and see if he was incapacitated, maybe take the weaponized gauntlet off. He was only a handful of feet away when multiple electric rounds suddenly erupted from the rubble, sending rocks and electricity everywhere.
reasons he loved the man. Because Steve never thought of Tony’s bots as mere machines or as JARVIS as just an AI. They were part of Tony – practically Tony’s children, which was kind of ironic at this point in time – and Steve knew that and treated the bots with care.
“How’s the pixel density and the distortion in the new system?” Wade asked Peter as they walked off. “It gets so distracting when everything looks so heavy, really takes away from the experience.”
“One, because I have learned my lesson in questioning anything Pepper does, ever, in her life, in my life, and with my own company. If Pepper wants to do something, she’ll do it. She does it to my life, to my company, and now apparently she’ll do it to my baby too.”
“Like hell I will.” MJ scoffed. She had her phone out and trained at them. “I’ll get a hundred more followers after this.”
Steve was shaking and he had to hold on to Tony’s hand to stop it. He had a small bouquet of flowers in his other hand with a card for Gail. The others would come in and bring in more presents for her later once she was resting and had settled nicely into her private room.
Natasha nodded. She cradled Juliana against her chest. Juliana looked up at her, fist in her mouth.
Dr. Pius then asked them a few questions about Juliana’s diet and sleeping patterns, and before Tony could mentally prepare himself, it was time for his baby’s shots.
Tony looked back and saw the amusement and sheer joy on Steve’s face. And was once again reminded of the many, many,
Bruce turned to Steve, but Steve raised a hand to stop him.
“Aww, see, there’s that beautiful face,” Steve said. She was still red, scrunchy-faced, and grumpy, but they loved her. “Dada made it better, didn’t he?”
Peter deflated, feeling the wind go out from his sails. “You guys have honeymoons whenever you want. You had one just three months ago.”
Gail was surveying the baby mobile that hung over Julia’s bed.
“Uh-oh,” Steve pressed a soft kiss to her cheek, “you got her bottle, babe?”
“No knives, Barnes,” Tony called out, slurred really.
Finally, the man sighed and let himself plop down on the workshop floor on his butt, leaning back on his hands. He kept his gaze on his lap.
The first one was the one of the Colonel and Julia, which was fine, but Steve’s eyes widened at the second photo.
Steve turned around, but Tony was already hoofing it to the elevator.
Tony followed his little family to the elevator, his heart and stomach warming at the sight of them. His other family was left in the workshop, but he had JARVIS keeping them all connected, so that was enough. Besides, Steve was right. They could have the bots come up when Juliana was ready.
Plus, he and Tony and the others had been pretty obvious about it. Rhodey crashed into the Tower last month, Pepper had the photo on her office desk, and DUM-E, U and Butterfingers still occasionally showed off their copies of the photos to any visitors to Tony’s workshop.
Tony grinned. He hefted Julia into his arms, supporting her against his chest easily. He had taken to wearing soft and slightly thicker clothes to make sure his baby didn’t feel the too-cold, too-hard edges of the arc reactor. He looked up and Steve was watching them, eyes bright and smile dopey.
But Gail had a mind of her own. She wanted to stay at her apartment and continue her work at Stark Industries for as long as possible. She lived alone and she liked that, so no bodyguards, no SHIELD, and no robots. They soon realized that she was her own person and that she was the
“Of course you are,” Steve said. “You and Jane are family too.”
(Yet. Yet! Because Steve knew, had said it himself even, that he knew the bots would end up playing with the baby anyway.)
“That was around the time your Mom died, right?” Tony asked gently.
And every night it made something warm grow inside Steve whenever he and Tony would curl up in bed, Juliana asleep on a nearby bassinet, with her holographic calendar projected over their heads, reading and looking at the pictures of just about every single wonderful thing their baby had done. There were stuff like: first day at the Avengers Tower, first time meeting the Avengers, first time sleeping in her bassinet, first time Julia touched Dada’s beard, first time Julia slept on Poppa’s chest, Poppa’s first drawing of Julia, Dada’s first selfie with Julia, among many, many others. Steve had actually heard Tony and JARVIS talking about giving primary user status to Juliana and about building a separate secure memory bank for all her files from now until when she grew up.
“Oh, your monthly photo book?” she asked casually.
“Me too,” Rhodey said and he definitely looked a bit more relaxed compared to when he arrived. He turned to the couch. “Come here, you. Stop pouting. You look so pathetic.”
“Da! Pops! Stop kissing in public!” Peter piped up, waving his hands at them. “And MJ, stop that!”
bothering
“They have been informed of your arrival, Sir, and that you and the Captain have brought a delicate package with you. They’re excited to see you both, and I have warned them to be careful.”
Pops walked up, running a hand through Peter’s curls. Peter didn’t have the heart to shake his Pops off. He’d get that sad puppy look and then Da would get snippy.
Wade shook his head, looking more amused than anything. “It’s fine. I’m just glad to see you’re okay, even though I had to ask Miss Potts for an update.”
“Wade!” Pepper grinned him warmly. “How are you, dear?”
“But your kid and my kid are one and the same.” That made a smile appear on Steve’s face. That was a good thought, a good thing, the best thing, to have a child with the love of his life.
“Oh, Julia, it’s okay,” Steve shushed her, frowning at her red face and angry demeanour.
“We know, son, but good thing we were,” Pops said as Da threw him a flying kiss. “SHIELD’s European Branch is three minutes out. Find shelter.”
isn’t that cool?”
(And had to endure everyone’s dirty looks at having pestered them all only to make a different decision. At least Bruce didn’t mind. He filed the paperwork away, saying they might need it when the desire for another kid came calling.)
“Your third month picture with Julia for her baby book,” Steve said. “We know you’re not much for posing, so we took a few candids and chose the best one.”
Tony glared at the ceiling. “Rude. My CEO is rude.”
Steve rubbed his fingers against the window before him, resisting the urge to hunker down on the window seat with his thick, warm blanket. He reminded himself that he was inside, in the tower, warm and well-fed, and that his lungs were in no danger of suddenly seizing up.
“Helps me gauge if Pepper’s going to kill me that day or not,” Tony mumbled around his mouthful.
sweetheart between them.
Steve poked him on the side, making Tony yelp against his mouth. He knew all of this was just a sign that Tony was worried about Julia, but probably didn’t want to sound like he didn’t trust Pepper.
“Thank you, Phil. I appreciate this, and I know Tony will to.” He reached over to place a hand on Phil’s shoulder, taking care not to crease his suit too badly. Phil hated that. “I know Tony grew up with a nanny, but before we decided on starting a family we both agreed that we didn’t want anybody else raising our child. But I guess we haven’t really ironed out the kinks completely.”
“Julia hasn’t eaten yet, because she was crying hard enough to just spill milk everywhere, but we have bottles ready,” Steve said. He motioned to the diaper bag already waiting on the coffee table. “She takes a nap four or five times a day, six if she’s feeling up to it, and drinks about seven bottles depending on how many times she decides she wants a nap more than her bottle. We have extra bottles, diapers, and clothes in her bag. She doesn’t like bright lights and loud sounds and the sound of frogs, and don’t…”
Just in time – or maybe JARVIS had been kind enough to wait, Steve didn’t really notice – the elevator doors opened with a soft ding.
“Infants lose heat faster than adults, Steve, and the younger they are, the less they can cope with the cold. Small babies can’t shiver yet and they don't have as much body fat to keep warm," he had said, as if Steve actually needed that much convincing.
“It’s okay, my darling. It’s okay,” Steve said. “I know it hurts, baby. It’ll be done soon.”
Dr. Pius glanced at her. “Don't look at me, baby. Look at your Dads.”
“And you, Juliana, my dear, this is going to hurt, but not for long, and it will help you grow big and strong.” Dr. Pius never talked to children with a baby voice, always so soothing, quiet, and calm. “I find that parents usually fret so much more than their children. It’s frankly such an embarrassment, and I’m not going to hold back my judgement or laughter just because your parents are superheroes.”
“You’re a jackass, Stark,” Bucky snarled, his gun disappearing somewhere in his person. “I was fucking sleeping.”
“Ooh, she’s here! I’ll get that.” Tony smacked a kiss against the side of Steve’s head. “Be back in a jiff, minions.” He wiggled out of the blanket and ambled off, pausing only to kiss the top of Julia’s head. “Later, chicklet. Gotta get your Momma.”
Steve managed to put away the last of the shirts. He slid the drawer closed and turned to Tony. “So, if we want to know what Pepper is going to do to our baby, I’ve got to be the one to ask her.”
“Come on, then.” Dr. Axel waved them over to the exam room. “Let’s see how she is.”
“You’re just going to cop a feel, pervert,” Rhodey countered.
As if hearing her Dada, Julia immediately smiled up at Steve.
The first set were pictures of Tony and his family from the day he was born – one of newborn Tony in a blanket, a family picture, and then one each of his parents with newborn Tony in their arms. Steve chose not to comment or linger on the happy smiles on the Stark parents’ faces, especially the rare one on Howard. The next sets were more the same, taken on Tony’s birthdays, Howard’s birthdays, Maria’s birthdays, a family picture, and then the same family picture but printed to have the words ‘Merry Christmas from the Stark Family’ written on the front. All of them were stiff, formal… severe.
have, but now you’re curious aren’t you? Tony grinned, waggling an eyebrow teasingly.
“PETER!”
“The other… you mean Bucky?”
Steve slid his plate of bacon closer. Tony was quick to be snippy when tired. He then answered, “I usually ask about the weather. Tony checks the stock market.”
“Jay, make a note of this on the calendar, would you?” Tony said.
“Love you,” Steve whispered.
Pepper sighed.
“JARVIS, open the door,” Tony said. “We don’t want Rhodey breaking the glass.”
So everyone was as prepared as they were going to get, and Tony decided not to delay the inevitable.
As Tony always said, he married the perfect man.
