so they did the dirty, and now tony's officially going to give the mate bond a chance with steve, who really does seem to love him. how cute.
"Can I be a bridesmaid?" Natasha asks from her seat at the table beside Bucky, and her thin eyebrow is raised in a teasing manner as it shoots over in Steve's direction.
too well.
"Sir?" JARVIS asks, in a call for his attention, "I took the liberty of preparing the backup briefcase suit for your withdrawal."
Steves jaw twitches again, and his eyes flicker away from Tony in what might be embarrassment, "No. That was a first for me. I never had time to date in the past. It just felt right."
But hearing it in his head just makes him sound like a jealous brat, so he aborts the idea of wanting to say it out loud at all. He grabs for his clothes again, ducking his head so he can pass Steve out the door.
Steve releases a breath, raising a hand to pinch the bridge of his nose. There's so much he wants to say in rebuttal. They're soldiers, their only role is to take care of the threat. Then there was the fact that Tony never actually explained the Accords and just expected everyone to follow his lead when their freedom was in question.
That. Now that is suspicious.
Steve frowns like it should be obvious, then raises his shoulder in a shrug, "You're home earlier than you usually are."
"That's not yours!" Tony hollers, and Steve hadn't actually realized he'd picked it up until that moment. A gauntlet wraps around Tony's wrist and he fires a shot immediately, the anger blazing in his eyes.
Then, Tony closes the distance between himself and Bucky and raises a hand, awkwardly patting Bucky's shoulder, "I'm hoping that means we're past the time I blasted your arm off."
Of course he was. Tony laughs, and it's a hollow, bitter sound. So, Howard had sent Steve and his pack after him under the guise of a lapse of judgement. Or maybe it was Obadiah that had convinced him of that. Either way, Tony feels appalled at the information shared.
"Is that bad?" Steve asks, his forehead creased in worry as he takes in Tony's change of demeanor.
Steve has one of those dimmer light switches, and Tony slowly raises the light. It's just enough to see what's going on; but when the light is on, Tony finds that no one had broken into the apartment. Instead, Steve is curled into a ball on the long couch and he's too far into his nightmare to realize it's not reality.
"At ease, soldier," Rhodey eases, even going as far as to clapping a hand lightly onto Steve's shoulder. His gaze doesn't remain on the alpha for long, instead turning back to Tony with the brightest expression Tony's ever remembered seeing.
The car pulls up right in front of him, and the front windshield is clear enough for Tony to see Steve's face through it. He's in the front passenger seat, looking tired but surprised like he can't tell why Tony's still there and looking at them. He sees Natasha, too, sitting behind in the driver's seat with her lips curled into a smirk. Of course she'd be amused by this.
James chuckles, a hollow sound, and finally raises his head again. The redness of his eyes is confirmation that he did just cry a little bit, and Steve's heart feels heavy. It's proof of how much James loves Tony; and if the roles were reversed, he would be inconsolable if anything happened to Bucky.
"Who still uses flip phones?" Tony muses to himself, but feeling the technology makes his whole body shudder in what might be relief. He hasn't had a phone in years.
"Steve?"
Tony sighs and turns away, walking over to a workbench. He'd left a tool kit on the surface earlier, and now was the best time to start working on his car, he decides. He can't be in the same space as Steve when he's jealous and guilty. Especially when he's got no right to be.
The fight is intense; because while the team is trying to subdue Wanda without hurting her, Wanda's focus is entirely on Tony, and Tony's got it out for all of them.
”We had orders.” Natasha argues, her tone soft and unsure as she dips her head, “Shoot on sight; to bring Steve, Bucky, and Sam’s bodies back.”
"Stay for dinner, Bucky?" Tony asks; and by asks, he means tells. He can be as stubborn as Steve when he wants to be, and both of the super soldiers know that.
That catches Tony's attention. It's blackmail, plain and simple. If Howard finds him, there's no telling what he'll do. He's not entirely sure why Howard hasn't come looking for him personally, yet, but he's sure it has something to do with how Tony hasn't been designing weapons.
"I want you, inside me." Tony grits out between heavy pants, and that does cause Steve to still instantly.
They hold each other for a little while longer, and then they go to the couch and turn on a random movie. Tony sees the title, knows the movie well enough that he can tune it out, then turns his head to glance at Steve. The blond is perfectly still, almost forced, as they sit side by side. They're not touching, and there's a bowl of popcorn on the table in front of them that they've been ignoring.
They share everything else. They share mugs, clothes (Tony likes being wrapped up in Steve's large sweaters), and an apartment, but they can't manage to share a bed. Tony wonders if there's a part of Steve that regrets being tied down to someone like Tony Stark after all.
"What do you mean?" Steve asks, and his gaze flickers in the direction that the pair had disappeared off to for the briefest of seconds.
Pepper answers, and the irritation in her tone is apparent as her voice raises, "
"What do you mean, Tony?" Wanda asks, her soft voice full of worry as she lifts a small hand and presses it onto his shoulder. Her touch is as gentle as her voice; like even a dusting her fingers will cause him to break like the mug.
Thor looks a little lost, like he doesn't know what just happened; and his hand wavers in the air as if he's trying to decide on whether or not his touch will be welcomed again. Before he can actually get to it, Wanda slides across the room and wraps her hand around his. She looks apologetic and her smile is gentle as she turns the broad-shouldered blond in the opposite direction.
"And uh - what are your thoughts on the matter?" Tony asks, because just because they decided to get married on a drunken whim doesn't mean either of them were happy with it.
"Already working on it, sir." JARVIS answers, and his tone is a little exasperated like he can't understand why Tony is asking. Sometimes he wonders where his AI had learned his personality from.
"No chatter on the comms." Captain America calls into the comm link, and Tony's glad no one can see his face because he's rolling his eyes as soon as he hears it.
Natasha turns and walks back out of the room, and both Steve and Bucky realize it means they're supposed to follow. They do, walking side by side the same way they always had, having each other's backs in a world they felt out of place in.
"What are you doing?" Steve demands, and he can hear the panic in his voice as he tries to tighten his grip around the brunet. Serum or not, the man was just stabbed for crying out loud.
"I wasn't going to let SHIELD or HYDRA get their grubby paws on it." A voice replies from behind them; and Steve curses himself inwardly for having forgotten where they were even momentarily.
"Yes, sir?" JARVIS's voice calls from the phone tucked into his pocket.
"Tony Stark, my hero." Steve says, his tone dry but still fond. If he notices Tony tensing, he doesn't say anything. Instead, he brings his own hand up and pulls Tony's head to his chest.
you were with me- the media knows it, too. If I show up there with all of you, you become accomplices."
Tony asks, because he's not one for false pleasantries.
"He's going to kill Pepper." Natasha realizes with a soft gasp, like the very idea of it is absurd.
, but Obadiah was the one who gave me the idea to run. He practically begged me."
He's stepping closer without even really being aware of it until he's just beside Tony, on his knees with his arms wrapped tightly around the metal armor. Sure, they had a falling out and sure, there's a lot to be said before any of them can heal properly; but as it turns out, Tony had spent the past year wallowing in his grief and Steve just
"Before any of that," Natasha cuts in, her tone patient but her fingers clenched on the hard surface of the dining table, "What do you know about the situation?"
The growing want pools in Tony's lower stomach as his arms wrap tightly around Steve's shoulders. His nails are blunt as they drag acoss the broad shoulders, but Steve doesn't seem to mind so much. In fact, he's moaning even louder with the faintest pressure Tony's adding.
Tony falters, but just slightly, and his eyes fall over to where Clint is like he's strange and out of place.
Thats news to them, for certain.
The alien, ugly ass creature as it was, shoots some green looking ray at the Winter Soldier. Captain America tosses his shield just in time, and the soldier uses it to protect himself from the blast.
"Hail HYDRA."
"So what's the plan?" Steve asks, directing his question to Vision. He knows how hard it must be to have to take out someone he loves; and while he and Tony had gotten close to it in the past, there's no way it can hold a candle to how torn up the situation makes the android feel.
"You... never had time to date?" Tony can't help but be suspicious, really, "You look like you're in your twenties."
The tension is growing in the room. Both stubborn and unyielding, Tony and Steve just stare at each other. In a normal situation, Tony would find Steve's stubbornness a turn-on; but in this type of situation, Tony finds himself standing up and striding over so that he's chest to chest with the blond alpha. In fact, in any other type of situation, Tony would be moved by how much Steve just wants to be beside him; but why can't the man just listen and understand him instead of putting up a fight?
First it was Bucky, and then it was Wanda. And that's just of who he's aware of choosing over Tony, even though those weren't his intentions. Who knew how many people he'd betrayed Tony over.
"Enough." Stephen says, all of a sudden, and he's flanked by a dozen monks who have their hands out and ready to cast what Steve assumes are spells.
pack safe, but you should know us better by now. We're not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. No one's going to take me away from you; not Obadiah, not weapons, not even
"And if that doesn't work out, you can always find something to watch on Disney," Tony offers in an attempt to rile some of them up. It works, according to the several unamused pairs of eyes turning to him. Feeling like he's intruding where he's no longer wanted, Tony gets back up and grins, "Anyway, I have some work to do, so I'll leave you to it. If you run out of food, town's only a short drive away."
There's no context. There's no explanation. There's nothing but those three ominous words that cause bile to rise in his throat.
Well, here's hoping Steve never finds out who he is.
"I thought I'd never see you again." Steve breathes, and he shakes his head like the very idea of it is too painful, "Even if you're Iron Man, Tony; you're human. You should've
"The Accords, for one." Sam answers easily, and his disposition is calm as he continues, "There was a lot going on back then. A lot of what happened could have ended differently if we'd just done this; sat and talked it out without picking up our weapons."
day as long as he's in town, "I see the look in your eyes so I'm guessing you're the mate. No worries. Tony started at M.I.T when he was 15, and I promise you, there's no bigger boner crusher than having to have watched the kid get through
The roads are backed up, but he gets back to Steve's little apartment in Brooklyn with relative ease. He knows Steve works for clean up; and though a part of him thinks he should go out looking for his husband, knowing he helped take care of a threat eased him.
"We needed oversight. We needed to be held accountable." Tony disagrees, his hand slapping against the dining table, "Ive been held accountable for years over my weapons designs and my actions as Iron Man, but none of you wanted to be responsible for your actions. None of you wanted to clean up after New York. None of you helped with the fallout of Sokovia. Instead, you got mad when the government said you needed to answer to the destruction of Lagos. The world was going to take us down whether or not we agreed to it.
"Don't make it harder than it has to be." She says to him, and he takes the words for what they really are, a threat.
He moves slow at first, soothing Tony with kisses as he pushes in until he's completely sheathed. He lets Tony set the pace to what he's comfortable with, and it doesn't take long for Tony's slow, tentative hip rolls to get faster. Steve is steady, easily able to keep up with him, but Tony can tell he's holding back. So bracing his legs, he pulls Steve in roughly.
"Wanda." Sam barks out, and there's a warning somewhere in his tone that everyone seems to still at after hearing.
Both Steve and Bucky's phones chirp, and Tony stares at them as they get off the couch almost as if on auto pilot.
James just stares at him for a moment, searching for something in his expression; and like a switch was flipped, he throws his head back and laughs until he has to wipe tears off of his face. Steve can't help but notice the way Bucky's face turns just the slightest shade of red as they watch the newcomer; like he's never heard anything more beauti- oh god. It hits Steve like a brick to the face. His mate's best friend turns out to be his best friend's mate. Isn't fate funny sometimes?
Stephen only looks amused as he steps back, "She's gained her powers from an Infinity Stone. Trust me when I say there would've been no way to keep her here."
about Howard, and why exactly Steve had decided to pack up and follow him around the country. He knows they need to talk about Bucky, because he can't tell if whatever was between them was gone or not. But for now, standing in the garage with Steve's hand pressing gently against his cheek and those blue eyes peering down at him with so much love, everything else just faded from his mind.
Tony just stares up at him for a long moment, his lower lip trembling and his hands coming up to clench at the front of Steve's chest. He pushes, but it's a lot weaker than it could be even without the enhanced strength of the Extremis floating in his system.
He stops by the workshop at the basement level of Stark Industries first, removing his armor and assessing the damage done to it even before he stops to take a look at himself. Like he said earlier, it was just a leg; and his leg was decidedly worth less than the armor he donned to protect civilians.
He goes into the closet in the bedroom he shares with Steve, crouching down to move boxes that are carefully concealing the Iron Man armor that was carefully designed into a briefcase. It doesn't have the same firepower as some of his other suits, but it'll do in a pinch and he refuses to go anywhere without at least one armor on hand.
"Well what do you know." The Black Widow drawls as she saunters closer to the alien, "I can take it from here, boys."
"Just a leg. Good thing I've got two." Tony answers in a joking manner. He's always had an issue with staying serious and that's always been part of him. Unfortunately, it doesn't sit well with the Captain.
Steve throws his shirt onto the floor behind him, and he looks like a lion stalking towards its prey. His eyes are blown wide, dark; and it takes him entirely too long to reach the bed.
"James Rhodes." Black Widow answers, and her tone just has a hint of irritation.
Tony answers with a laugh, one that's full of disbelief as he tilts his head back and stares at the ceiling that had just threatened to crush them all, "That's the
She in turn tells him about her relationship with Happy. Happy had once been Tony's bodyguard, and the two of them met after Tony's disappearance. Happy needed to hide from Harold just for a few minutes. Pepper had a lot of steam she needed to let off. It's not really much of a surprise that they had gotten together after all.
"As Tony's best friend and someone who thinks of him as a brother, it looks like I'm up for giving the shovel talk," he says it with a wide grin, and yet, his eyes are colder now, "so I'll keep this short and simple. I've seen too many people get away with using and hurting him and I won't sit back and let it happen again. If I get even an inkling of the feeling that Tony isn't safe with you, I
"Platypus?" He tries, with a pleading tilt in his voice.
And Tony just freezes. There's no other explanation as to why he can't think or move or even breathe. All at once, it hits him. Howard's known where he was all this time. Obadiah knows, too, and he's pretending to offer his silence by blackmailing Tony into designing weapons for them; and it really would be so easy for Howard and Obadiah to destroy Steve and his pack. It would be all his fault, and simply for letting them get close to him.
Steve chuckles again, and his fingers fall away from Tony's ass. He's hit with melancholy, missing the presence of Steve in him, but Steve adjusts quickly, leaning back on the bed and hooking Tony's thighs around his waist.
Stephen's gaze flickers from Steve to Wanda, and with a flicker of his eyes, something wraps over her hands over the table and quells her powers. They startle, grabbing for their weapons because that's an act of hostility if they've ever known one.
Tony pauses for a long beat, then reaches down for his briefcase, "It's still Mr. Rogers, unless this is it for Steve. I'll see you later, Miss Potts."
Of course, Steve is the exception. He stays behind for a few minutes to talk to his pack, but then he's sprinting and on Tony's heels. Tony himself is calm, or about as calm as anyone whose just bared their souls out to strangers could be as he heads to his old bedroom. Tony doesn't even realize he's sprinting himself until he nears a corner and sees his old room and thinks there's no way he can make it before he's caught. Steve's a lot more athletic than him, anyway.
"I'm being manipulated? Shocker." Tony strides forward in a much calmer walk, his eyebrow raised and his hands tucked into his pockets as he squares off in front of Wanda.
"Tony spent so much of his life being made to feel unimportant that somewhere along the way, he started to believe it." James explains, and it's the truth, "But if someone he cares about is involved, nothing else matters. Obadiah is going to keep using you as leverage, because he knows that; and Tony is going to keep building weapons, because that's the only thing he can do."
"You've already given up a lot because of me, Steve." Tony says, and though there's the slightest flicker of rage in Steve's eyes, Tony continues, "I don't want you to get hurt because of me, too."
get it annulled the media will be all over you."
about it went after his teammate. The same teammate who retired and gave up his spot in a building he had built for her comfort. At that moment in time, Steve hated the very idea of Captain America.
Steve shoots him a look, full of amusement and reproach as he stands up and holds Tony's pants out to him, "I'm not you, Tony. I've already taken care of it."
Something in Tony's heart snaps. Or maybe just his entire heart just snaps. Tony can't really tell. He's trying to catch his breath, and Steve's words sound so lost and heartbroken. Steve doesn't deserve this from him, and maybe Tony really had been unfair, hadn't he?
"I didn't come looking for you because of what Strange said." Steve shoots back, his tone certain and leaving no room for disagreement, "I was scared, Tony. I was scared and that's why I didn't come looking for you back then but - but the moment you came into that compound - the moment I thought I lost you for good? God. That angry, hateful
Tony waits a beat, but finds himself floored when no one speaks up in his defense, "You're just going to
"What now, Rogers?" And while there's that bitterness and that irritation in his tone, he looks almost resigned as the distance between them is shortened.
. The scent of honey and musk, now that he's closer to it, smooth lips working against his own chapped ones, Steve's hips pressing against him with a thigh between his legs, one hand resting against the back of Tony's nape to direct his head and the other holding his waist firmly. Steve's tongue is in his mouth, having used the gasp as an opportunity. His tongue is hot and smooth as it caresses the insides of Tony's cheeks and battles for dominance with Tony's tongue. Steve wins, not that Tony was really going to put up much of a fight.
"Would he really revive Ultron?" Clint asks, and the horror is seeping into his tone. That was a chapter in their team story that everyone desperately wanted to forget.
Blue eyes stare right back at him, challenging him.
He yelps (because how else is he supposed to react?), and wraps his arms around Steve's shoulders just on instinct alone. He's not heavy but thinks Steve's showing off just a little unnecessarily. He tries not to stare too hard, but the man knows just what he's doing, lips curled into a smug grin as he ducks his head close.
Steve and Bucky? Why the hell were they at a veteran's support group?
"Welcome home, honey." Tony says instead, and he strides over to take some of the bags from Steve, leaning up on his toes to press a kiss to the corner of Steve's mouth.
Bucky chuckles, and Steve just stares at his best friend. There's truth in his words, of course. But -- was it as simple as that? His broken -- whatever it is -- with Tony, was it really just because he couldn't help himself from protecting his best friend? No. It was always more than that. He'd always chosen to protect someone else and leave Tony to protect himself.
When it comes down to it, though, they knew each other too well. They knew each other's fighting styles. Their personal weaknesses and strengths. Steve can still remember just how many cups of coffee Tony needed in the morning before a business meeting. He knew Clint's favorite crawl spaces for when he wanted to be alone after a rough night. He remembered what tea Natasha wanted after dinner.
Tony nods, still feeling a little uneasy; and he just watches as Steve drops his hand and heads over to grab himself a plate of food and a mug of coffee. Obviously, the interaction hadn't gone unnoticed. Natasha's giving him a look with an eyebrow raised. Wanda looks almost sympathetic. Bucky glances from Tony to Steve like he's not sure if he's missed something. Sam isn't actually looking at him; but at Clint, whose got the expression of a kicked puppy as he pokes at the scrambled eggs on his plate. Bruce and Thor are talking quietly in front of the coffee machine, though it's obvious by their body language it's about Tony.
"I love you too." He answers, and he really, really does.
"Anthony, you do not look so well," Thor cuts in, and Tony wonders when the last time was that he let himself look so vulnerable, "Perhaps you should-"
His lips are part, just slightly and curled in what seems to be amusement. Tony decides he loathes the Adonis for it.
But Tony had never pointed a finger in anyone's direction and decided if they were worth saving or killing. He never intentionally hurt anyone.
It seemed too good to be true, and that's because it was. Not even a full day later, the Avengers are back at the compound  Upstate, New York. The building was a hollow reminder of what they lost: abandoned, dusty, lifeless.
Sam clears his throat, raising a hand and waving it in Tony's direction, "I feel like I've been too hard on you."
, Steve. Not just your body, but you." Tony can't help the way his voice cracks, and Steve takes a shuddering breath as he turns his head back to look at him, "When I told you I didn't want to be someone that hurt you, I meant it, Steve. I don't want to hurt you anymore."
His faceplate snaps up, and he meets directly with Steve's widened eyes. There's that glimmer of realization in his face that tells him that it should've been more obvious to Steve, too.
Stephen had vaguely told them that Thanos would be coming for the Infinity Stones; most of which were on Asgard being guarded by Thor, thankfully. Of the two that remained on earth, however, one was guarded safely while on Stephen's person. The mind stone would be safe in Wakanda, now that Wanda couldn't get to it.
His lips continue their trail downward, his hands moving ahead of him to undo Tony's pants and slide them down. The cold air hits him just for a second when Steve sits back again to look him over. Whether it was for bruises or just because he couldn't get away, Tony wasn't sure.
Tony knocks his hand away, stepping closer so that he and Captain America are chest to chest. They've been at ends with each other since their first meeting on the hellicarrier, but there's no reason for the man to treat him like a child.
She falls to the floor in a crumpled mess, heaving. The rest of the team creeps forward slowly, and with a wave of his hand, Stephen does something that undoes the damage Wanda had caused the Sanctum.
And then, Tony feels like cracking a joke.
Tony looks up at him through his eyelashes, and the guilt returns as he sees the earnest hurt on the blond's face. Really, the way they met might have been all wrong, and Tony still hates the idea of fate, but Steve really was such a good man.
"I like y'all but please don't start making out in the middle of the movie," Sam says with a low groan as Steve adjusts them; and while the recliner isn't typically big enough for both of them, Tony is squeezed into Steve's side with their legs tangled and his head resting on Steve's chest.
Sleeping in the luxurious bed provided for him in the Avengers Tower was but a distant memory that he found himself longing for desperately.
to bait him on national television?"
"Top drawer of the nightstand." Tony replies, and Steve pulls away to get it.
"I'm saying -" Tony takes a deep breath to steel himself, "I don't want to go back home, not just yet, but I want to stay with you, Steve."
He almost wishes he missed that, because all that his brain thinks about is that man Steve had looked so torn up about. All he can think for a moment is that he just had to go and talk to his friend about whatever happened. He had no right to be, and he knew it; but still, Tony knew what jealousy felt like. It wasn't pleasant, and especially when coupled with the guilt in his chest.
at him already, "I told you I wouldn't ask you to come home. I told you I was fine with just watching from a distance. I told you I didn't want to pressure you. But now -- if you reject me now, after all of this, I
"Thanks for the assist." Captain America breathes, and Tony loosens his grip. The Captain tumbles out of his grip, returning to the ground with a tumble. Damn super soldiers and their impervious bodies, really.
Steve doesn't look hurt at all, his eyes glimmering in understanding as he ducks his head and presses another kiss to the corner of Tony's mouth, "We can wait, Tony. I don't mind."
But like Steve can read his mind, which often feels like the case, blue eyes shoot open. There's no warning aside from that; but if Tony were more alert, he would've seen it coming when Steve shifted and rolled himself ontop of the brunet. His lips are curled back into a proud smirk; and at times like these, Tony really wants to punch him in his pretty teeth. Instead, he does the daring thing and bucks his hip against Steve's; and the growl of warning falls empty.
Until he's naked, that is; where praise makes his entire body flush in a way that makes Steve grateful he's the only one who can see it like such.
"The guy with the metal arm. You were a thing, weren't you?" Tony asks, and as soon as the words are out, he hates his lack of a filter. He doesn't know any of them well enough to be asking, and he doesn't want Steve thinking he's jealous, even though he is.
He's not entirely sure. There are many people that hate Howard as much as Obadiah does; it's just not that many people have the motive. His father's business partner was always getting the shorter end of the stick, figuratively speaking. Back when he was still playing the ruse of acting like the perfect father for Tony, he had confessed many times that he felt like he was running the business and had nothing to show for it. The man had copies to every weapon design. He could sneak in and out of Howard's mansion; hell, he had enough money to make sure someone else took the blame for it.
"Steve." He calls, his voice breaking off in a moan. Steve pauses to show that he's listening, but his nose is still brushing along the column of Tony's neck, "Kiss me?"
Bruce and Thor, who choose to walk into the kitchen at that percise moment, and Thor's cheerful voice is a little too much in the morning. He's not the only one who thinks so, seeing the slightest twitch of Natasha's normally blank face.
?" Bruce asks with his eyebrows raised, and he's turning red with excitement, "It took
"How did she pass?" Thor asks, and its an innocent question. Tony knows it, but he can't help the way he curls in on himself defensively. It's not really the kind of thing to talk about at dinner with strangers.
"It's here." He finds himself saying, and for whatever reason, seeing it causes his heart to flutter. Maybe it's because of what it symbolized in the past, or because the metal had been worked over so all the scrapes from the last battle he'd fought with it was hidden.
"Before we get to that," Sam cuts in, and the entire team seems to be bracing itself for another brawl. Sam looks weary as he turns his head in Tony's direction, "I also owe you an apology. I wanted to send you to Steve as a friend, but when the Accords hit and you were so adamant in having our abilities restricted, I couldn't trust you. I didn't want Steve to be lulled into a false sense of security by trusting you, either."
a killer, Tony. It would've destroyed you."
That is a powerful, dreadful kind of statement, if Steve’s ever heard one. Thanos, the mad Titan that they keep hearing about, seems to be a powerful foe; and if Tony’s involvement is what’s needed to stop him at the end of the day, there’s nothing else to it.
"Steve..." Tony begins, the protests building on the tip of his tongue.
They take a moment to process this, though Steve never moves his eyes from Tony's expression. There's so much he seems to be holding back with the rest of the group there, but the blond's disappointment is radiating in waves. Tony doesn't want to disappoint him, but are there really other options?
In the end, he takes a seat on the same couch as Bucky and waits for him to continue at his own pace.
Obadiah finally says, with a heavy sigh; and he acts put upon, but they both know Obadiah relies on Tony's genius more than Howard's.
"Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes," Rhodey says, and his shit eating grin tells Tony that it's going to be a
A mere second later, Steve's arms snap forward. One hand lands on the back of Tony's head, fingers curled tightly into the hair on his nape and pulling Tony's head to angle him closer. The other hand is pressed to the small of Tony's back, pulling him impossibly closer like they're supposed to be one person rather than two.
For Tony to deny himself of the one person he had wanted for
So he closes his eyes and thumbs along the arrows on the phone. He flips back and forth, counting to ten and hoping for the best. He hopes to god whoever he's calling isn't actually asleep. That would seriously suck for all parties.
He's asking between pants, and Bucky's in a similar shape. Tony is, too, but he looks so gleeful as he fights them like this is all he's wanted for so long.
- too just make a little sense of it, but nothing comes out.
"Goddammit, Tony, I never wanted to kill you and I'd never want you dead." His words are heavy with emotion as he pinches the bridge of his nose. Tears are building, stinging the back of his eyes; but he won't cry. He would never cry in front of a team that expects him to be strong on their behalf.
Steve is silent for a moment, and then he shifts. Tony thinks he's gotten the hint and will go back to bed, but that would be underestimating the blond's stubbornness. He ducks into the garage and makes his way over to Tony. Tony doesn't look away, but Steve still approaches slowly like he's trying not to spook the brunet. And then, Steve's crouched before him, with Tony's hands in his and pretending to ignore the bruises and the blood as his thumbs draw circles into Tony's skin.
would care enough to stop him, "Steve could have walked away at any time, but the dude packed up the little he had and followed you across the country. The rest of us are losers without him so we followed him, but he saw something in you that he didn't want to give up on. Don't belittle him and his earnestness with thoughts like that."
Tony's heart shatters, then, because he hadn't even thought about it like that. He hates himself for hurting Steve as much as he does. Marking each other, having sex -- they were bonded now, and it was because Tony urged him that he went through with it. After all, it was Tony who was taking advantage of Steve, not the other way around.
"Ever since the goddamn Avengers Initiative took off the ground, you've all taken from me; my home, my weapons, my money, my resources. I let you, because we were a team," and his voice is as empty as the look in his eyes, "but you lied to me, judged me, accused me of stabbing you in the back while leaving me alone to clean up your messes after you became international fugitives, and you took my best friend away from me."
Nearly.
hi so yes this is my second chapter update today so if you haven't read in a while, please read the chapter before this first. thank you for your time and attention.
supposed to mean?" Sam asks now, and he only sounds a little confused as to whether or not he should be offended.
"Can we uh - talk about the elephant in the room?" Sam asks, and despite the uncertainty in his tone, his expression is firm as he glances in Wanda's direction. She's not looking at him, though. Her eyes have never turned away from Tony.
And there it is, Tony thinks.
type isn't you, Tony. It never was. I know you said I did it to you, and I'd do anything to take what I did back. But you - god, Tony, I -"
had them?" Tony hears himself echo, if only so he could force it to sink into his head faster, "That makes no sense. I mean, yeah, neither of them were supportive when I said I was
"Did we miss something?" Natasha asks, and her eyebrow is raised pointedly, her apparent mood betraying that they better not have missed something. She turns to Scott when both Sam and Clint turn away from each other and refuse to explain their behavior, "Do you have an explanation for this?"
Everyone's eyebrows raise in unison like they're waiting for him to clarify that point. He stares down at his briefcase, feeling awfully nervous now. Showing Steve is one thing, but showing Captain America and his team of
It does explain some things, including the looks of horror on both of their faces when Tony described the Jericho missile to them.
It's at that moment that Sam gets up to get a refill of his coffee, so Tony nudges the stool beside him with his foot and slides his plate of breakfast over in front of it, "Come. Join us, Honeybear. Tell us all about your latest assignment."
Not that he'd ever had a bedtime growing up.
"I need full transparency, here," he manages to bite out, his teeth grit almost painfully. They look at each other, and then back to him, like he's grown another head and they don't know exactly what he's on about, and Tony uses that as fuel to keep going, "What, exactly, did Howard tell you about me leaving New York?"
"Sorry but I ain't got patience like the punk over here," Bucky replies, and his voice is just a little hard, "I can't follow you for years hoping you'll give me a chance. So I'm going to need it now; will you accept me or reject me?"
"Wanda. Tony. Please, we don't want to fight." Natasha grits out, a pleading edge in her tone as she pulls two guns out of the holsters on each side of her hip and aim one in either direction.
Careful not to jostle the blond too much, Tony moves his hand from where it's trapped between Steve's hip and underarm and brings it up to trace his fingertips across the blond's features. Even asleep, there's so much love and warmth radiating off of the alpha that it feels like Tony is swimming in it.
Finally, Wanda stands up and slams her hands onto the dining table, causing several plates and cups to clatter at the pressure, "If you want to give your lives and freedom up to a man who the world is better off without, you will do so without me. Vision, let's go."
?" Clint squeaks, and he runs after the bot that is chirping as he rolls away, "No! That stuff is dangerous! Hey! Can you hear me?"
Wow, that got out of hand real quick. Tony bursts into laughter, though it's mostly to cover his growing embarrassment. He and Steve had only just gotten together, and yet, everyone was talking about marriage like it was a serious topic.
The simplicity of which she uses in that question causes Steve's stomach to churn. Just take him down?
And come at him, he does. There's an ugly battle in the Malibu house, but he's the only one who was there to begin with; and as he's falling into the sea with the rest of his Malibu mansion crumbling and following him in, all he can do is think of Steve and why he let pride get in his way when he wanted nothing more than to be in Steve's steady arms.
hanging over his head.
While he has a good relationship with Hawkeye, he can never stand Captain Uptight's self-righteous bullshit.
"It's not about you using me, Steve." Tony insists, raising his hands to cup Steve's perfectly chiseled face in his hands and stroke at the pale cheeks using his thumbs, "We're married now, and I want to take care of you like you take care of me. I know you've got this whole idea in your head of being the sole provider, but honey, I'm a multi-billionaire. If we don't use my money, no one will."
"Just lift your hips and enjoy this." Tony responds, and after a heartbeat, Steve lifts his hips. Tony makes quick work of tugging the sweatpants down, and he swallows heavily at the size of Steve's dick. Feeling it in his hand was one thing, but imagining it in his mouth is another.
"Don't remind me." Tony grunts as he turns to pour himself yet another mug of coffee, "I haven't been building in years. I'm getting sloppy in my older years."
made and it hurts. What am I supposed to do, Steve? I don't want to hurt you, and I don't like the idea of anything I make hurting you, but there's nothing else I can do -- and Obadiah is just going to keep making demands and I have no choice but to keep fulfilling his demands because otherwise he might hurt you and-"
"You don't get it, do you?" Tony asks; and his voice is cold and frustrated as he shifts his gaze back to the group, "If Obadiah knows you were with me -Howard
Tony really wants to scoff at that, because Steve could be lying and playing him. The government, and especially that damned Fury, has been after him as soon as Tony had come home from Afghanistan. They had no idea about him being Iron Man, as far as he could tell, but of course they wanted him to make weapons like the Iron Man suit so they could use it for their own agendas.
Tony tells her over the line, and while he registers that it's early in the day and they had just seen each other the night before, he just
He hates it when she's right. Bracing himself, hands curling into his pocket like they're his lifelines, he turns and strides right over to where Steve is sitting. He's not alone, of course. Alphas are rarely alone in public. Tony doesn't care about the rest, though. He only sees Steve and his self-confident grin like he's known this would happen.
They try not to use it because of the reminder, but sometimes it just can't be helped.
Tony nips once, playfully; and then again, putting a little more pressure against the skin. His arms wind around Steve's torso, and the blond seems to deflate into his vice-like grip, little shudders of pleasure racking his body as his head ducks onto the crook of Tony's neck. Steve seems to get the message then, and he returns the favor with little kisses of his own to Tony's mark. There are no words exchanged as they hold each other; just basking in each other's warmth and giving each other what they need for reassurance.
The sound of glass breaking has Tony turning his head in Thor's direction. Thor is positively livid, and doesn't even seem to realize that there's blood dripping from his palms from where he'd been gripping onto a beer bottle.
And all Steve can think of while he climbs to his feet is that while Tony can't consider any place without Rhodey around as home, Steve can't think of any place without Tony as home.
As far as peace offerings go, this is the best he can imagine getting. Indeed, Sam is still his favorite of the pack.
"It's cold." Steve mutters, and he won't even look Tony in the eye, like just looking at the brunet is too much for him right now.
able to escape, I blew the whole place down. It was gratifying, to say the least. Rhodey found me in the desert a few days later and brought me home. Howard and Obadiah kept it widely under wraps, forced me to have surgery to have my entire chest reconstructed. They couldn't let the public see me with a glowing blue disk on my chest.
Tony raises his hands, wanting to cup Steve's face in them to reassure the blond that he's
"Man you got it
He settles himself onto the bed beside the brunet, reaching a hand out to gently cradle the side of Tony's head, and leans forward to brush their lips together. The kiss is salty due to Tony's tears, and Steve won't pretend he hasn't shed a few of his own. Tony doesn't seem to mind that he's crying, though, so there's no need to dwell onit. Tony responds into the kiss, pressing forward and allowing all of his anguish to flow through their entangled lips. There's a lot being said in the kiss that Tony can never seem to get out in person; the apologies for shutting him out, the fear of watching him get hurt, the love that makes him want to stay in Steve's arms forever.
as furious as he seems.
God. He was supposed to be the team leader, yet he was so slow to react when someone so bitter and
"I want my hands on you all the time." Steve conceded his point, and he straddles Tony's hips easily, his head tipping down to press teasing kisses along the side of Tony's neck.
"Hey, Stevie, I-" he's called out of his musings when Bucky himself joins him in the kitchen. Tony is perplexed at how he's been confused for Steve until he remembers that they spent the last night marking each other and officially bonding. Guilt churns in his stomach as he remembers the past between Steve and Bucky, and again, he feels like nothing but an outsider.
"What do you say, Stark?" Stephen questions, raising a hand like he's about to summon a portal, "Keep it here or do you want me to send it somewhere else?"
Tony hangs up the phone without answering, and when he checks his phone, it's about 8 PM, and he remembers that the pack is about to watch a movie together. He hopes there's enough time for him to pull Steve aside to talk to him about Obadiah, but when he gets to the entertainment room, he's lost. Everyones lounging on the long sofas and on the floor, and there are cases of beer and glasses of wine, and several bowls of popcorn. Steve himself is sitting on the only reclining chair in the room, and his eyes find Tony as soon as the genius walks in.
"I'm just the idiot who thought we'd be able to work it out as a team."
A voice barges into his thoughts, but his eyes are staring at the design and the longer he looks at it, the less he can force himself to breathe.
The act causes for Steve to groan, his skin on fire from the lingering touch, and he finds himself thinking that this is just too good to be true. That's proven true when Tony, having realized what he did, pushes at Steve's chest until he's released and throws himself off of the bed to establish some space between them.
Nope, not going there. Tony lets himself unravel in Steve's arms to block the thoughts from his mind. He just told his goddamn mate that he
The brunet pauses for a beat, then turns his gaze in Bucky's direction, "But back then, he's all you thought about. It didn't matter that the world was waiting on us because the only person you were waiting on was Barnes."
Again, the rest of the room seems to be in silent agreement, but Steve remains silent, contemplative, as he ducks his head. His voice is just a whisper, seeing as there are others around, and Tony has to bite his lip to hold back the shiver that comes along with Steve's breath on his ear, "Is something going on?"
"When Howard called up to say you left town, Steve looked devastated." Sam answers, and it manages to have Tony sober up instantly, too, "After nearly losing you once to your stupid drunk driving incident, he decided he had to follow you. Bucky wouldn't leave him behind, and I decided that wherever those two go, I would follow."
"I'll get the coffee started," Bruce murmurs; and though he's trying to be helpful, they all know that what the genius needs is sleep and not caffeine.
"J?" Tony asks his AI, and he replaces Hawkeye onto a rooftop so he can get back to playing Robin Hood.
"In the entertainment room, there's a small closet behind the flat screen," Tony says instead, because a change of subject is in order if he doesn't want to break down at the thoughts of his mother and childhood, "You should go and check it out when you've got a chance."
As soon as he wraps his hand around the mug, however, the little flip phone Steve had once given him buzzes in his pocket. He frowns and tugs it out, flipping it over to see that he had a new message. He thinks its Rhodey, since Steve had mentioned something about a case that Rhodey and Pepper are compiling. There are two texts, actually, and one of the texts is from
"I know we're already married so this is more of a formality than anything, but when we got married we'd decided on keeping us a secret and I -- I want the world to know that Tony Stark is mine."
"You know I'd never." Steve cuts in, his head snapping up so quick he's grateful towards the serum in his veins so he doesn't give himself whiplash.
A life on the run is a life that isn't easy. Anthony Edward Stark, otherwise known as Tony, knows this better than anyone. It's something that's had to be learned quickly -desperately- after two years on the run. Granted, running is a lot easier for him than it would be most people, seeing as he started out with over 2 million dollars in cash and then picked up odd jobs throughout his travels to keep living his chosen lifestyle. Still, with the lack of a home or family and long drives that could take days at a time with cheap gas station coffee, the luster of adventure has faded away completely.
Hawkeye continues to look dismayed, and Black Widow looks over at Steve for just a moment before clearing her throat and standing.
"Can I be a part of the planning for my own wedding?" Steve asks the group, and everyone looks at him for a moment and shake their heads. It's like a silent agreement had passed through them. Tony laughs harder than he should, and ends up with a hand pressed onto his stomach as he folds forward. Steve looks beyond betrayed, but seems to give up on defending himself.
But right now, the only thing that's swimming in his head is the desire to save Tony - to bring back the futurist who loved his bots, drank coffee like it was a youth elixir, took care of them, and tried his best to protect the world despite his insecurities.
The tips of his ears are red, though, and Tony knows he's not much better. The rest of the pack doesn't seem to mind, save for Sam's groan and Clint's inappropriate comments; but Tony just manages to keep his mouth shut as Steve drops him down onto the countertop. If this is what being part of a pack is like, even in the midst of rough times, he was really missing out on a lot.
When he's composed, looking up at the group that seems too bewildered by his reaction to actually react themselves, he has to bite on his cheek to stop himself from doing it all over again. Just like that, some of the tension that's come with being home again is gone. He reaches a hand out anyway, and Dum-E whirls over to him for affection.
Steve is quiet for a long beat, his neutral expression unnerving Tony to no end. How the hell was he supposed to react when a man like this so casually enters his life?
But as they say, beggars couldn’t be choosers.
"I-" He's not about to reject Steve, of course. He's just about to agree, and to tell Steve that he's having trouble understanding his thoughts, but his voice is swallowed up whole when Steve surges forward.
"What brings you down to my lair, bird brain?" Tony asks, an eyebrow quirked as he tried not to make his ogling obvious.
Unfortunately, though, Tony's not too good with silence.
Tony doesn't move for a moment, and Steve wishes that he'd flip his faceplate back so he could at least see whatever expression the brunet was making.
He takes his time in the bathroom, rolling his shoulder to ensure that it's just scraped and not broken. Thankfully, it was only a surface wound, and the bleeding had already stopped hours ago. The grease in his hair is cleaned off easily enough, and he feels like a brand new person when he finally steps out of the shower.
There's no verbal answer that comes from the suit. He doesn't need one, anyway. Words come and go but it's actions that mean anything. And this time, Steve would do anything to ensure that Tony never feels like he's on his own again.
Finally, Tony pulls back, and his hands rest onto Steve's shoulders as he looks the blond square in the eye. It's still early in their relationship and he knows it. There's still so much that can go wrong; and so many ways they can hurt each other. But Steve took a chance on him years ago, and even though he knew his body would claim otherwise, Steve was content with just watching from a distance to ensure his safety. If anyone's going to be Tony's mate, there was no one better for the role than Steve Rogers.
Steve's eyebrows fly upwards as he hears it. A metal plate in his chest? It doesn't make Steve feel any better to know about it; it just makes him that much more aware of Tony's fragility. When he had heard about Tony's trip to Afghanistan, he was rightfully horrified. He met Tony because the brunet almost lost his life, and Steve was merely lucky enough to be there at the right time to get him out of the water. He wasn't there for Afghanistan. It was during the time he had been working for Howard in Washington D.C., and when he and Bucky met Sam for the first time. To know he could've lost his mate was heartbreaking; especially considering Tony had never met him before then.
The blond isn't smiling, exactly, but Tony can see the flicker of amusement in his gaze. He's entirely too smug about the whole thing, Tony thinks, and Tony should really stop staring now.
could it be?
"I left you dinner on the desk." Steve supplies; and in the darkness, Tony can't see the expression he's making. His shirt is too thick for the glow of the reactor to cast a shadow, too. Despite that, he knows Steve is frowning as the blond leans in and presses the most delicate of kisses to his temple, "I'll be better about it. I promise. Don't starve yourself because of me."
"Anthony Edward Stark," A shrill voice calls out from behind him. He's slightly mortified that he was so wrapped up in watching the pack and their reactions to his workshop that he didn't notice the elevator's ping.
"Okay. Okay, Tones. I have a feeling my arms are going to get ripped off if we don't get the show started." Rhodey groans out, and it's not because Tony's got a grip on him. From the look on his friend's face and the heated stare that's pointed at his back, he'd say it's time to introduce the pack and his mate.
That's not true, of course. There's still the matter of --
"Still, it's good to have you as backup, Iron Man." Captain America tells him, and his tone even sounds a little relieved, "We could use the air support. Can you spot any weaknesses?"
"I'll order pizza while you're in there." Steve calls out, his voice a little rough and hazy. Tony's stomach growls at the mention of food, and the rest of their night is peaceful.
Even if that meant giving up his phone, his custom-built home in Malibu, his only two friends, and all the expensive liquor he could ever want, this was the life he preferred over the one
Tony closes his eyes, taking a deep breath, then turns around and opens the door.
"Calm down, man. I'm not trying to spook you." The hint of amusement is back, and Sam is raising a hand into the air as a means to placate him, "I finished a degree in clinical psychology, you know? I spent a lot of time talking to vets, and after what I saw over there, I know it's not as easy to pretend none of this bothers you."
The humor is lost on them. Really, Tony needed a lesson on tactfulness. That's going to have to wait, though. Within minutes, he's in his car and ready to go. The vibranium is in his trunk, though it still needs to be shaped into something, and the particle accelerator sits on it like a weight.
"We weren't there for the call," Steve explains with just the slightest shake of his head, "Tony came back and joined us looking hurt and uncomfortable. When he finally brought it up, he said Obadiah was using
. There was history there, and he knew it, but just thinking about it made his stomach churn in discomfort. He runs his fingers through his hair, grunting as he tosses his head back. As hard as he squeezes his eyes shut, he can still see the way Steve had looked after the other man. Even with the fact that Tony was the man that Steve was fated to be with, that kind of
He can't say he minds, though.
. He'd just gotten away from this life, he can't come crawling back because of this gorgeous, sexy blond haired alpha. But he also can't help but
Rhodey shifts, releasing his grip on Bucky so that he can move over to where Tony is sitting. He waves a hand into the designs, knocking them away, and then takes a seat beside Tony. It doesn't exactly regain the brunet's attention, but it's all his patience will allow him to do, "Tones. I know you hate the guy. I hate the bastard, too; but as of right now, you're a suspect too. You know what'll happen if you don't show tonight."
Steve reaches down between them and grips both of their cocks in one hand, and he pumps them together. Tony writhes at the pleasure, his head thrown back as he pants. Steve takes the opportunity to duck down, his teeth nipping once more at the mark he'd left behind.
The other two cars are packed and ready, Tony realizes as soon as he drives his own out of the garage; but Steve's not in either of them. Steve throws the door open to the passenger side of his vehicle and climbs in with his lips pressed together and his face downcast. For such an expressive guy, Tony's suddenly having such a hard time of reading the alpha. Sighing with the thought that they were going to be silent for a little too long throughout the trip, Tony shifts into drive.
"Hey man. You got food in there, right?" The other man, who Tony pointedly decides he likes best of the entire group, asks. He doesn't look like he's really expecting an answer, either, but Tony shrugs and points a finger in the direction of the door.
Then, Steve hooks an arm around his shoulders and another under his knees, and Tony pretends his following yelp is even the slightest bit masculine as he's lifted off the ground. His arms fly to wrap around Steve's shoulders in response, and Steve draws back just a little to look him in the eye.
They have a little party using Tony's penthouse. It serves a duel purpose; both to welcome the Avengers to their new home and to celebrate their marriage officially with friends.
Stephen stands as they approach, an eyebrow quirked ever so slightly as if he's judging them.
Its Steve's turn to stare at Tony, mimicking his position, "We were always on the same side, Tony."
Stephen takes a long breath as if to steady himself, and they watch as cloak that was tied to his shoulders undoes itself and floats away like it wants to be as far from the conversation as it possibly can. Steve can definitely relate to that feeling.
"Does that mean you don't hate me, then?" Tony asks, just to be sure.
." Sam snorts, and he has the tone of a kid who's about to tattle on another.
"You were supposed to lay back and enjoy the blow, Steve." Tony says, amused and also so equally turned on by the quick turnaround.
Tony's so caught off guard by the question that he manages to miss his mouth, and coffee spills down the front of his shirt. He jerks to find a rag, feeling the nervous laughter bubbling in his chest.
Bucky scoffs in his amusement, and Steve just stares at them like this is bizarre; but one look between Tony and Bucky is enough for both brunets to keep their conversation a secret.
Just like that, the strength that was keeping him up fades away, and Tony sinks into the loveseat, his briefcase armor clutched tight. Of course he married Captain America. He stayed as far from the man as he could when it turned out his father's pet project had been found; but Steve Rogers was a common name and - fuck, for a genius, he's so fucking stupid.
"Don't pretend you didn't want an excuse to get your hands on me." Tony responds, his voice low and husky; and he's definitely trying to get a rise out of Steve.
"Into the garage." Is all he says; and while Bucky grumbles about not being Tony's personal chauffeur, he pulls into the garage along a line of well-maintained classic cars.
That's horrible, Tony decides. Steve is a masochist and needs some sort of psychiatric help. That's really all there is to it. Diving into the water to save someone you don't even know? Learning that you're fated to be with him so you follow him for two years even though he's made it clear he wants nothing to do with you?
this chapter is rated rated. i know the whole story is technically rated but this one includes smut. fun times, fun times. as always, i hope you enjoy this one. skip to the end for the note if you're uncomfortable reading smut.
There's a small spot on the neck where mates can claim each other. It leaves a small mark that when healed, looks like a birthmark. It carries the mate's scent and in rare cases, allows a telepathic bond to form. Tony's not sure of all that, but he does know he wants to be closer to Steve in every way he's ever been afraid of being in the past.
He knows Tony's a genius, so that part's not a surprise. But how would anyone feel if they found out their father figure was out to kill them? And then the same man turned around and convinced him to run away? It was possible Obadiah was only acting in his best interest to try and build his support and consider other avenues in ridding himself of competition.
"Don't look at me like that, Steve," Tony murmurs, and he tilts his head, pressing a kiss to the center of Steve's forehead.
"Tony." And it's the third time just that day that he's had to call for the brunet's attention; and he doesn't even realize he's stepping closer until Tony squares his shoulders and narrows his eyes. He won't step away, though; and Steve's counting on the memory of Tony challenging him time and time again.
But when Tony draws back, Steve wraps an arm securely around his waist and pulls him back, effectively drawing the breath that Tony releases in a gasp with his lips. They fit perfectly the second time around, and for the length of their kiss, the entire world is silent; and then Tony's hands start moving. One hand moves to Steve's hair, fingers curling into the soft strands like a lifeline, and the second drops down to Steve's waist, slipping underneath the hem and teasing across his skin.
Vision closes his eyes, drawing in a deep breath before he shakes his head. His smile is sad and twisted, "I do believe it best if you remain unaware of my plan, Captain."
Steve hears the plea in his tone and doesn't delay. He presses his lips against Tony's tongue gentle as it licks its way into Tony's mouth. He takes his time to explore the cavern that is Tony's mouth; and all the while, his hips roll against Tony's in an act that shows how desperate he is to see Tony come undone.
sleep. He wants to say it's because he spent the early morning having a passionate round of sex with his mate; but really, it's because while Steve slowly drifts off, Tony is too caught up between thoughts of the blond and thoughs of the weapon he's supposed to be building to even close his eyes for longer than a minute at a time.
"What happened that day is on all of us, Tony." Natasha eases in, and she's on the other side of Tony and holding onto his shoulder even though she can't feel him through the armor.
The mug in his hand tumbles to the floor and shatters; and that's the sound that startles Tony out of his thoughts.
That hurts more than it should.
Steve stills, and he knows the blond is thinking back to their argument before Tony left for Malibu. There were a few days in between in which they could've reached out.
Did he look like he wasn't okay? Did he really make it that obvious?
"All of you were dead." Tony answers, finally, and then his eyes drift to Steve, "Except you. You were just barely alive, and you told me I could've done more to stop it. Ultron - he was supposed to blanket the planet and add security. The mind stone was too powerful and took over the programming."
. Like Tony's some sort of puzzle. As an engineer, he's not entirely sure how he feels about it.
Steve takes a little
"Steve?" Sam asks, turning in his direction, "You have something to add?"
There, on the screen is a picture of a very familiar man;
Pepper chides, but her voice is full of adoration as she does so, "
The following
When they pull back again, Steve looks in the direction of the couch with his lips pressed into a firm line. He looks like he doesn't want to spend the rest of the night alone. Tony can't blame him for that. He, too, hates sleeping alone after a nightmare.
"You didn't need me in Siberia." Tony's not growling anymore; but his tone takes a pleading edge to it.
Tony can't help the chuckle that ensues, feeling the relief flooding his body, "
Steve's eyes snap up in his direction instantly, and his lips curl back in a snarl. For the first time since they've met, Steve is
"If you pay attention to the movie, that won't be a problem." Steve quips back easily, and wow, he really can be such a little shit. Someone throws popcorn at him and when Tony shifts to see who it was, it's Bucky, who seems more amused than annoyed.
"You... want to go out? Or stay in and watch a movie here?" Tony responds carefully. He's known to be a public figure, sure, but he prefers to spend most of his days at home in private. There's also the issue of paparazzi and wanting to respect Steve's privacy.
Steve gasps, and his words come out in a fast, hurried pant, "Then why are you trying so hard to run from me, Tony?"
"Should we move the..." Scott trails off, pointing just a finger at the discarded Iron Patriot armor.
"Tony, that's not fair." Natasha tries, her expression stern but her voice cracking ever so slightly because she had only ever wanted to keep the one family she's ever known together.
Despite the situation, the words cause Tony's chest to feel warm, and when his eyes roam, he finds that everyone's looking at him with soft gazes. There's trust in their eyes, mixed with gratefulness and acceptance, and it very nearly makes Tony choke.
The blond's breath hitches, but just slightly, "Not when I'm home. They feel restrictive."
He gets up and leaves before Tony can get a word in edgewise. That night, Tony eats dinner alone in a house that doesn't feel like home with a husband that is so close yet so far away.
Bucky's there, again, and the two of them are cooking together and working with so much ease that they're practically the married couple. Tony's heard thuds, viciously, but he just mumbles his hello and steps in the direction of the bathroom. He's covered in grease and motor oil, and there's a cut on his shoulder, accompanied with a bruise, he hadn't taken care of; so he'll let them goof around until he's done taking care of himself.
Sam makes a protesting sound in the background, and Wanda placates him by scooting over in his stool so they can share the seat. It's not much, but it seems to do the trick as Sam glowers in Tony's direction. Rhodey, seeing the interaction, manages to raise an eyebrow and takes the offered seat.
The rest of the occupants still, glancing between each other and then turning back to Tony. Steve should say something. He knows he should. After all, he was just as guilty about the whole incident as Tony was.
for Tony to turn around and give up. Tony's never given him enough reassurance to think otherwise, and that's on him, but he just hates how the one step Steve takes away from him makes it feel like there's an ocean of space between them.
"Do you really believe that, Tony?" Steve asks, and there's a hint of desperation in his question that he can't entirely help.
And then his phone rings, and Tony is confused as he picks up the flip phone. Steve was just with him, so it made no sense for him to call when he can just pop in at any time, and he'd just spoken to Pepper recently. He hasn't spoken to Rhodey yet, but that's more out of respect because Rhodey was usually run ragged by the Air Force, anyway. Forget Howard, too, because Tony would never be the one to break the stalemate between them. The number's not saved in his contacts, but Tony knows who it belongs to the moment he glances at it. His eyebrows furrow, because it makes very little sense, seeing how he and Howard haven't spoken in years, but he sighs in resignation and hits the answer button anyway.
"I didn't make it easy on him, or any of the rest of you, and that's on me." Tony concedes, both arms up on the table and holding onto the mug in his hands with an iron grip, "I got so tired and fed up watching my mom and Howard growing up that the entire idea of mates and settling down with someone that could very easily kill me by just walking
"I don't think there's anything to discuss." Natasha speaks up, her voice a little strained with emotion. She knows the right call, but even for her, choosing one teammate over another is difficult, "Steve spent most of his life taking down HYDRA. We can't just let her off the hook knowing she's aligned herself with the supremist Nazi group."
Tony turns back to him slowly, and as soon as he notices the way Steve's body is vibrating with tension, he reaches forward. Steve flinches but doesn't move, so Tony takes that as permission and brings a hand to the back of Steve's head, pulling the blond forward so his head can be buried into the crook of his neck.
"Tony?" Steve asks, and his head snaps in Tony's direction as the brunet shuffles past. He ignores Bucky, for all intents and purposes, dropping the spatula he had in his hand to follow Tony into the bedroom.
Steve's about to retort to that, but Clint beats him, "You make it sound so easy now that it's done with; but Stark, you never called. You never explained. You just expected everyone to fall in line."
fate had had chosen for him.
to touch. Steve groans into his mouth, appreciative of Tony's touch, his own hands dropping to Tony's waist and tugging at the hem of the brunet's shirt.
"I've always needed you." Steve tries, his voice soft and his eyes threatening to flutter shut so he can just absorb Tony's scent and bask in his presence.
"No one's manipulating anyone!" Steve objects, his jaw set and his hands clenched into tight fists. Dammit but he hates it when Tony acts nonchalant, "We all have done stuff badly and we all need to sit down and talk things out but all of us need each other. Because we're all we've got."
"Will you be staying for the rest of the day?" Steve asks to James. It's a good thing that Bucky goes by his nickname because having two Jameses would be a little difficult.
So he takes it, and Tony is more than willing to give it. Their movements are graceful but hurried; and in the end, when they lay beside each other once more with Steve curled up around Tony protectively and Tony's quiet snoring filling the air, Steve thinks back to his conversation with Bucky. When he had first decided to follow Tony, he was content with just watching from the distance. He didn't want to rush anything, and he didn't want to spook Tony when the brunet made his thoughts clear. Something shifted along the way, starting from that night at the diner. One kiss was all it took; and while Tony had at first only wanted to meet up occasionally, they were now sharing a house, a bed, and a family.
Comes Pepper's response, full of love and concern, and then the call drops.
The tears are uncalled for and so sudden that he doesn't realize he's crying until Steve's fondly rubbing the tears away.
grow up?"
"You couldn't have used the front door?" Clint scoffs, and he turns back to his cooking like he doesn't care. He does, though, if the trembling of his body is any indication.
With that, Tony pushes himself off the counter and drags his feet in the direction of his room. Steve watches with furrowed eyebrows, unsure of whether or not he's supposed to follow or just keep giving him space. It's hard to know with Tony, he thinks to himself. He looks at the rest of the pack, wondering if he can read any kind of clue on their faces as to what he should do. Bruce mutters something excitedly about checking out the accelerator and practically dashes out of the kitchen. It's the fastest Steve's ever seen him more outside of his bouts of rage; and Thor follows him because they're pretty close and Thor likes seeing the excitement on Bruce's otherwise peaceful demeanor. Natasha and Wanda just look at each other, shrug, and exclaim loudly that they're going to bed. Sam decides to do the same thing; and when Clint whines and says he wants to watch movies instead, Sam hooks a hand in his elbow and drags him off. Steve's left in the kitchen with Bucky.
And it hits him like a punch to the gut.
He turns just enough to angle his body in Tony's direction, "And then we dealt with the Chitauri and met you in a bar. I knew I waited too long the second he started laughing with you. I can't really blame him. You
"My workshop at the compound." Tony decides, and everyone turns to stare at him with varying levels of surprise.
"I won't pressure you into joining us," Steve promises as he pulls back, and he stands in a graceful motion, gathering the plate and empty glass, "but you're not intruding, Tony. They're your pack, too, now."
Damn that Howard. Damn Obadiah, too. Just when he's starting to get comfortable, they spring this shit up again.
Sam looks at him, silent. It's not the same as the look Natasha gave him the other day that made him feel stupid; and it's not like Bucky's questioning gaze. Sam just
Steve looks around at the group, seeing puzzled expressions on the rest of his team aside from the singular raised eyebrow Natasha's given in response, and they collectively take their seats again.
"As of last night, yes." Tony replies, and he's always been aware of his lack of tactfulness.
"Ste-" Tony tries to get in words, tries to tell Steve that it's been too long since either of them had slept and can this wait until they've at least had a nap?
Home. It's a peculiar thought, and one that amuses him. The Stark tower, sitting in the middle of the bustling city, was once created to be a beacon showing the family's strength and wealth. To Tony, it was nothing but empty promises that pierced the clouds.
Steve's quiet moans and the roll of his hips to meet his mouth give him a hazy kind of pleasure. He can do this all day, just tasting Steve and letting the blond fill his senses. But oh the other hand, when Steve seems to be getting closer to his release, his fingers are flexing in his hair.
When he turns, cautious but expectant, the flicker of hope is squashed instantly when Steve holds a jacket out for him.
"I beat you to it this time." Steve says, and their foreheads are pressed together and Tony can feel Steve's breath fanning his face. "I'll try not to put too much pressure on you, Tony. I don't want you to fear me." He leans forward one more time, pressing another chaste kiss onto Tony's lips, "But I promised to get off your trail, and I intend to do that at least for the night." Tony tries to understand what he means, but his brain is seriously short circuiting right now. He's entranced by the scent of honey, the lingering feeling of Steve's hands tracing his skin, the shadow of the bites pressed into his lips that are causing it to swell.
"I'm afraid that she's too far out of our reach even if we were to help her." And there's a deep sadness in his voice that causes Steve's heart to clench in sad understanding.
"War Machine." Tony responds easily, "Iron Patriot, going by his Army call sign."
for his old man. That's the truth of the situation.
It's all he needs to say, really, going by the downright
When he comes out of the bathroom, Steve and Bucky are having dinner. Tony doesn't join them, even though there's a third plate waiting there for him, and even though Steve is looking in his direction in a silent plea. Tony doesn't eat much anyway, and that's what he tells himself when he turns and walks back into the bedroom instead.
Actually, those might be the exact words. He's not exactly sure; he's still in shock.
He's always hated being vulnerable; and always prided himself on being able to hide it from anyone, including Rhodey and Pepper. Even if they were starting to feel more like his own pack than he had expected, he hates to think of himself as a liability and wonders how much they'll mock him for it.
Bucky raises an eyebrow, "Wouldn't recommend doing it again, but sure. We're past it."
"God, this is the most melodramatic fight I've ever been in." Tony mutters, but it's loud enough that everyone can hear him and his tone is filled with hollow laughter, "It's like we're in a Spanish soap opera."
When he opens them again, not a second later, Steve snaps into motion. It's like he was in a daze, and now that he's moving, he won't stop. He pulls Tony forward with enough strength that the brunet falls haphazardly onto his lap, and their lips connect in a slow kiss. They've kissed before, several times; but the magic isn't lost no matter how many times they kiss. Steve is gentle as he licks his way into Tony's mouth; and Tony's not so subtle when he grinds against Steve. It's different now -- it feels more open, like there's nothing hidden between them.
i'm as bad at writing about emotional vulnerability as Tony is at feeling it. i hope this one doesn't make you cringe like it made me cringe. i love angst but -- wow, it's a lot. on another note, i was supposed to bring rhodey into the story as an actual character rather than an implied one, but i kept forgetting about him. hopefully, i can rectify this with the next chapter.
"Come home with us."
"Dude, if you didn't look like you were going to kill us with that glass, that would've been so impressive." Clint snorts, but it's void of amusement, and Tony can't bother to fake a laugh.
Steve's affectionate with him but doesn't want to kiss him. They're married and share an apartment and a bedroom yet Tony sleeps alone on the bed when Steve takes up the couch.
And up until that moment, Tony hadn't realized how badly he was shaking.
"You're all liars, manipulators, self-righteous
"I like you." James declares, and it's the third time he's share his approval with Steve. Even so; the blond alpha doesn't mind hearing it again. He turns in Bucky's direction again, and there's a certain softness that edges onto his expression, "Sorry I can't stay too long. If you give me a few days, maybe we can get to know each other then?"
Steve stares at him for a moment, the argument burning his mouth. Steve seems to hate that Tony comes from money and openly refused every offer that Tony had made for him earlier. Steve, who was working on a government salary, wouldn't even take a dollar from him on rent, groceries, or anything else. It kind of made him feel pathetic.
"I thought you were dead, Tony." Steve says in a low growl; but while his tone is rough and his kiss is firm, his hands are still so gentle as his hands trace up and down Tony's sides and arms.
"Do you remember slamming your shield down on my chest, Steve?" Tony asks, eyebrow twitching and one hand trailing down to his chest to rub it like there's still something pressed against it, "I was lucky that the arc reactor wasn't keeping me alive because you
They knew this already, but it still hurt to hear. Tony had only come to Berlin to try and get them to come back; to find a solution to their problem without having any unnecessary blood shed. Unfortunately, Steve had a lot to lose during that fight and couldn’t be dissuaded from it; and in the end, it was Rhodey who paid the price with his life.
Tony leans forward to the dashboard, pressing a little button on it and causing both of the gentlemen in the front seat to look at him in confusion. He can't blame them; it's not their for them to know he added a garage sensor to every car he'd borrowed.
Tony is floored by the command. One, he is not some frail damsel in distress and he doesn't need protection, thank you. Two, it's kind of hot that Steve would issue a command like that to his team, knowing they would follow his orders whatever they were.
He waits for his words to sink in, and there's an air of resignation. Despite their anger and their discomfort in Tony's plan, it's the only one they've got right now.
Yeah, okay, the movie is a fond memory; but the talk afterwards isn't.
"Ultron couldn't be controlled in the past." Wanda reminds them, "He would be a fool to try again now."
"Tony." Steve's voice is calling to him, and when Tony turns his head, Steve's still right there at the table. He's not even sure how he knows it's Steve's voice, just knows that it is.
So he hops back into his car and scours for an open fast-food joint. There are none. Where the hell did he end up if there were no McDonalds or Wendys to be found? He's dismayed, and gumbles under his breath as he pulls up to what is probably the most crowded diner he's ever seen. For fuck's sake, it's almost midnight and people have chosen a diner of all places to be?
He can go and ask, of course, but he can also do what he's been doing for years and just run again. He turns back to the entrance, his hunger be damned.
Steve is there, sitting in his favorite arm chair, staring back at him with eyes that screamed exhaustion and his mouth agape like he can't believe his eyes. It clears quickly, after he's taken the chance to look Tony up and down, and his jaw clenches in tension.
"Yeah," Tony concedes, and he forces himself to forget the conversation he'd just had with Obadiah. He can think about it later; he could use the distraction.
Feeling admonished, Tony just manages to stare at the blond's back in shock as he sets about to do what he'd suggested. The second plate of food placed in front of him looks about as appetizing as the first had, but Steve gives him a daring look over his shoulder as a jerky Bucky follows after him. Rhodey is silent for a second longer than Tony would have expected from the man, his eyes doing another sweep of the room before it lands on Steve across from them.
And then the voices from inside stop all together, and a moment later, James strolls out. He looks as confident as he had earlier, his uniform straightened and looking completely put together as he smirks at the crowd and slips past them. Bucky, on the other hand, trails after him with swollen lips and his shirt hitched up. Steve doesn't want to know what they had been up to.
to eat.
"Steve?" He asks, his voice uncertain and his hand moving to cup the blond's jaw, "Can I kiss you?"
Steve pulls out and Tony winces as he allows his sore legs to hit the bed again. The blond disappears in all his naked glory, coming back with a wet towel and lovingly cleaning Tony off like he's a priceless work of art.
held onto Tony like he was made of glass. The first sob racks through his entire body, a loud and painful sound that sounds foreign in his ears. The following sob progresses, and they continue to progress until his voice goes horse and then no more sounds are let out at all. Steve just holds onto him, and when Tony finds himself slipping onto the floor, Steve follows him down and holds him steadily against his chest. In all of his entire life, Tony has never felt more damn treasured.
It looks a little bit like Natasha's colors, Steve thinks to himself.
At first, he has all the control. Steve answers his kiss with an aching slowness, seemingly content with their progress or lack thereof. Tony, thinking that to be his cue to pull back so he doesn't show just how desperate he is, breaks their kiss and pulls back. When his eyelids flutter open, Steve's staring back at him, mouth slightly agape and cheeks flush.
Steve stares at him like he's lost his mind, his jaw clenching as he steps closer and effectively boxing Tony against the counter, "What does my working for the government have to do with you?"
He tries not to let the disappointment build, biting back an involuntary response that makes him want to tell Steve to stay, if only to keep him company. The alpha's got an entire pack, and all of them love spending time with him. Tony's just an outsider, he can't keep expecting for all of Steve's attention. He grabs a rag from the little setup he's situated nearby the car, using it to wipe his hands down. He'll need to take a shower at some point, but this will have to do for the moment.
When Tony Stark wakes up, he can't hold back the quiet groan that's building in his throat. It's not unexpected, considering just how much alcohol he'd consumed the night before. It was a big day, after all.
"Call me Tony." Is his only reply.
James snorts, and Steve slowly steps back, shooting looks across the room and hoping everyone understands his silent command. As crass as the group is, this isn't really something they should weigh in on. They probably should've left sooner, Steve thinks. They're still standing outside th kitchen and pretending not to listen in, but it's at least
Tony stares at him, baffled. He's never felt so precious in all his life; but Steve can turn his brain into mush with just his gaze alone. Did he even
"Then you'll wait until you're dead, Rogers." Tony spits out, and he doesn't realize how angry the situation is making him until he slaps a hand onto the table.
in his gaze that Tony almost feels like he's choking. Steve isn't alone, of course. Natasha and Clint are right behind him, and Sam walks in from the other side of the kitchen; and the energy of the conversation from the previous night's dinner returns full force.
The blond lifts his head slowly, looking up at him with soft eyes flooded with concern and love. Tony feels like he's choking under the weight of his gaze.
Tony doesn't have the heart to answer, so he just manages a weak smile.
Steve looks off in their direction, and his smile is amused despite the situation as he turns to Tony, "Are you jealous? Did you marry the wrong person?"
eventually convince Tony he's part of, and Tony's friends, supporting them from behind.
Even though that suit is empty...
"Please." Steve confirms, and a portal opens up just before them with the two of them stepping through to wherever it is Stephen's taking them to. He can't ask her to help stop and save Tony if she's not willing to do it; and if they do want her help, Vision's the only one who can get through to her.
Rhodey grimaces, and Tony mirrors it; and suddenly, the room is too quiet.
"No kidding. We got a long drive ahead and I'd like to get some sleep before it." Clint agrees with a snicker, and the rest of the room seems to snort in agreement.
"I don't think this is something we need to debate." Steve says, deliberate and thoughtful as he sweeps his gaze over his sullen teammates, "Wanda's betrayed us. Sure, she's younger and needs more guidance than us; but it's time we trust Tony and try to earn back his trust in us."
And then, Happy ends up in a hospital, and the Mandarin taunts and threatens him. Tony gives away the address to the Malibu house on the news and challenges the fucker who thinks he'll run and hide to
"I don't need to remind you of what happened over there when you lived it, man." Sam says with a shake of his head, and for whatever reason, it does make Tony feel that much more relaxed about the conversation, "But I can see it in your eyes. You still get nightmares. You still feel trapped. I'm just trying to tell you that, as a pack, we're here for you. This ain't something you've gotta brush aside because you're afraid of getting close."
"Be safe out there?" Tony asks, his voice coming out small and uncertain. He doesn't know what Steve's actual job is, but if he's out there in the middle of an alien attack, there's a very high chance Steve might not come back.
"Here is the problem." Stephen explains as he gets up from the chair, "If we are to save Tony Stark, we will lose Wanda Maximoff in the process. If we are to save Wanda Maximoff, we lose Tony Stark and the universe."
A moment of silence passes between them, and then Steve turns in his direction and his jaw is set in determination, "It might be old fashioned of me but I don't believe in divorce."
Hes baiting them for whatever reason; but like always, Steve can never step down from a challenge if he's up against Tony. They were each other's greatest rivals for a reason. And so starts their song and dance routine; and while they don't have Steve's shield, their teamwork isn't missing anything.
He tries not to hear it as rejection. Even now, with desire hanging in the air between them and Steve thrusting into his hand, he's worried they're going too fast for Tony. Tony just stares up at him, feeling like he's getting lost in those blue orbs. He knows why he spent years running away from this, but would things have been the same if he had known Steve back then? But he doesn't really want to think about anything else. His mind is hazy with pleasure and his senses are filled with
The anger flies out of Tony immediately, and the brunet is left resigned as he covers his face with his hands. He's been years older than Steve even when they first met; but looking at him right then and now, Tony looks so old and tired.
had a birthday celebrated with his family. His only friends were little bots that he created himself. He got so used to being alone that he made it his life's purpose to stay alone."
"I'm going to get him to bed," Steve interrupts, like he can read Tony's thoughts and wants to verbally disapprove of them before they become more coherent.
He bends down to brush a kiss against Tony's temple; and after just another moment to make sure it's not a ruse and Tony's about to wake up again, Steve leaves the bedroom. As much as he'd love to join in for a nap and hold the brunet close to his chest, he's still the leader of a pack and he needs to be around to assure them that everything will be alright; even if he's not so sure of that himself.
Tony scoffs, knocks his hand off, and that's enough to give him the resolve to walk away. He doesn't look back even once, and Steve doesn't even bother stopping him.
"Tony, you haven't eaten anything since lunch," Steve admonishes from behind him, and when Tony turns around to see the rest of the group has stood up, he can see the questions dancing in Steve's eyes, "Are you sure you should drink on an empty stomach?"
"Is that a threat?" Clint asks, and he's reacting worse than Steve is.
"Off you go, Avengers." Stephen muses, and he doesn't look like he's in any way interested in fighting alongside them, "For the sake of the universe, I hope your optimism doesn't fail."
"Once every few days or so, we call Howard to let him know what's going on with you. He asked us to keep an eye out on whether or not you looked like you were ready to go home." Steve is the one that answers, and the tips of his ears are flushed in embarrassment. The blond looks apologetic and guilty and the sight of it makes Tony's heart constrict.
"We didn't. The boys just eat a lot of food." Natasha answers with a shrug to match.
"It felt good to sleep in a bed. I'm sure it was the same for you." Tony replies, matching her knowing look with one of his own.
Still, and even though it's not a completely appropriate time to do so, Steve chuckles.
"I got all my work done." Tony explains quietly; and while they're the only two in the apartment and don't need to be speaking in whispers, there's something almost fragile in the air between them, "Figured I'd come home and see you."
"You're telling us that losing his friend is what it took for Stark to decide he wants to take over the world?" Clint asks with an eyebrow raised; and Steve can't help but agree with the sentiment.
"Are you offering me therapy? Is that what this is coming down to?" Tony asks, more cautious than suspicious.
He gets into the garage easily enough, the door lifted off the ground just enough for him to crouch on his way in. It's only when he's inside the garage that his composed façade falls, and Tony drops onto a stool beside his car. He'd been wanting to work on his latest car, an older model that was hard to hard to get his hands on, but it really wasn't much more of an excuse. He just needed to get away from Steve and from his fate. His heart had been hammering in his chest from the moment his eyes locked onto Steve's, and his body wanted nothing more than to just reach out and grasp onto those blond strands.
Steve looks the most beautiful when he's asleep; with his eyebrows relaxed and a peaceful smile decorating his handsome face. Tony knows there are a million and one things he has to get done. Okay, no, just the one; but it's daunting enough to have the same effect as a million things. He knows he has to get it done, though; but when he compares his responsibility to wanting to be selfishly wrapped in Steve's love for just a little longer, Steve's love wins out in a landslide.
"Sorry. Pepper would want to see this." Rhodey explains, and he's not sorry at all, the mother-
"The Avengers have been fine without me since the start. I was only pretending to be a hero, remember?" Tony growls, but some of the heat in his tone is forced, like he's confused by their intentions.
"See? I knew we should've just tossed him in the trunk and dragged him home." The guy pressed to the wall tosses a look at Steve and Natasha, who pointedly ignore him.
There's a knock on the door then, and Natasha's poking her head into the room, "You do know that's Clint's bed? Right?"
"Have I recently told you I love you, J?" Tony muses, and he steps back to let his bots take the pieces of his armor away for repairs, "Because I do. I really do."
"You know our story. How we got separated, how Captain America came looking for me as soon as he woke up from the ice." Bucky continues, and his gaze is as far away as his voice, "And the first thing I thought when I saw him again is that I loved him with all my heart and wanted to do anything to make him smile again. He felt so out of place in this time, and even me being here did nothing to settle his demons."
Tony stares at his disappearing back, feeling like he's really missed something important. The bumping against his shoulder wasn't rough enough to be considered aggressive, but part of him couldn't help but wonder if there was some animosity directed towards him in that exchange. When he drags his eyes from the metal-armed man to Steve with his eyebrows drawn, Steve isn't even looking in his direction. Steve's looking in the direction of the front door, where the other man had gone through, and he looks
"I realized the only reason you two bested me last time was because of my weakness, of how human I am," Tony grins, his eyes flickering from his healing hand up to Steve and Bucky's matching horrified expressions. The others are slowly coming to, and they seem to be just as horrified at the display; including Natasha, who's being hoisted in through the window by Sam. They hadn't even realized Sam had gone after her until he'd come back with her.
It’s the next day, and having spent the night in an uncomfortable room in what Stephen Strange calls ‘The Sanctum,’ Steve’s body is sore and rigid from having slept on the floor. He’d done it for years during his time in the army and yet he’d never get used to it.
Tony doesn't waste any time. He's nervous but he just needs to hear that voice again. So he thumbs back over the contacts and clicks on Steve's name. Unlike Pepper, when their call connects, there's silence on the other end. Tony wants to wait and see if Steve will end the stalemate between them, but he remembers Steve's text.
"And here I thought I'd be watching wrestling with my breakfast," complains Clint, and he huffs a little as he drowns his waffle in syrup. The rest of the pack ignores him pointedly, but Rhodey's eyes glint over.
That gives Tony another reason to pause, and before Steve gets too far out of his reach, he cups the blond's face and pulls him in for a kiss. Tony hopes Steve can read the
Obadiah now only has one thing between him and running the
"Where's the stone now?" Steve asks him, and while he wants to be more sympathetic, its best to get this out of the way before anything else.
, "I'm such a goddamn idiot. I'm didn't even realize - I - fucking love you and I didn't even know it until now."
"Is there something going on that I don't know about?" Tony asks, raising an eyebrow in question because he just needs to know what, exactly, he's done wrong.
"That-" Bruce begins, but he seems to be the only one who recognizes the voice, because the rest are just staring at him warily.
"There is only one person in this world who Tony Stark believes he still has on his side." Stephen answers, "She continues to attempt to placate him over the death of James Rhodes, and in two days time, when she tells him he is only human and it is his right to grieve over someone he's lost, he will allow the Extremis in his veins to take over and remove every last trace of his humanity."
”Do you forget that he went to Siberia in order to kill Steve and James?” Wanda counters, but Steve just stares at her.
"Everyone down!" Steve shouts, and his voice carries over the shattering of the glass. The team follows suit, but only for a short moment until they gather themselves.
"I know we have our differences, Steve, but you usually at least
and the
When he steps into Tony's room, the brunet is shirtless and sitting on the edge of the bed. One hand is pressed firmly against his chest, and his face is twisted into a pained grimace. All of Steve's former frustration melts away as he hurries over, kneeling before Tony to look up into the brunet's eyes.
"After years spent on the run from your father, your past, and a mate bond you weren't sure of wanting, Tony, you finally got yourself to take a break." Steve tells him, and it's a mix of scolding and gentle reassurance, "Do you want to run again now?
"Why do you speak of it in such a way?" Thor asks, and he beats Steve to it by just a hair.
in actually, was everyone expecting from him?
"You've never needed me, Steve." Tony answers with a shake of his head.
"I don't know who you are but it looks like you've saved us." Steve tells the man, his lips curling upward despite himself.
"Because I fucking love you." The words come out before he can even register them, and he's stunned by his confession. Sure, there's always been this surge of attraction between them, charged and hidden beneath the harshest of arguments -- but did he...?
"He's been opening up more." Sam says from the countertop. He had given up on the unofficial group huddle, deciding that he could still hear and be a part of everything without being squished between Thor and Bruce. Sam had spent a little while with Tony; he actually threw the idea at Steve before Steve could go find the genius. Steve was surprised, of course, but remembering how he Bucky and met Sam, it made sense.
i want to say we're drawing close to the climax but honestly? there's still so much i want to do with the plot. i feel like i need to bring the actual wolf part up, so that's probably coming in the next chapter or so -- and there's howard. and obadiah. and -- wow. i'm not entirely sure how i'll manage to pack all the shit i'm thinking about into this story.
, but Steve doesn't let him. His own hands pin Tony's down, the pressure a little too firm for him to pull away; and yet, if he really wanted to be released, he knew Steve would let him go.
"Now I'm going to pretend you're being a good host, Tones, and take that coffee off your hands." Rhodey really is such a little shit, and Tony's admittedly a little too distracted to be able to stop the man from taking his coffee mug out of his hands.
Tony hears a story somewhere in there, but Clint looks like he's about to be swallowed by the syrup and Tony just hasn't had enough sleep for the blond's dry humor.
It's a joke and accompanied by a laugh that's entirely too forced. He turns to Steve, noting the vulnerability Steve's always trying so hard to hold back.
Tony turns his head back to the television, his lips curled into a grimace. Well, he did once tell himself he'd never go back while his dad were still alive. At least he upheld that end of his bargain. His eyes turn back to where Steve is, then; and he feels the anguish and grief radiating off of the blond. It reminds him of how Steve had told him he was once friends with the old man. As much as Tony couldn't stand Howard, Steve was still allowed to grieve over him.
"Steve." Tony calls, his voice coming out soft and followed by a choked sob; because as scared as Steve must be for him, he is for Steve. He works for the government, cleaning up after alien invasions and the Avengers. If anyone's at risk, it's him.
And then, on the other hand, "What did you
"But I did. Howard said you'd never want me closer; so he sent me to D.C. and gave me a job, promising he'd find a way to get you to open up to the idea of a mate," Steve explains, and he drops his head. Tony's workboots are untied, so he carefully lifts one of the brunet's feet to ease the shoe off of him, "And I know -- I know, Tony, that it's hard for you to open up. I get that you're so used to doing everything on your own because people keep letting you down; but it
Theres a collective gasp, though Steve isn't part of it. Sam is, though; because Rhodey's death was something he would never be able to forget. For Tony to be throwing it around so easily and heartlessly? What the hell had happened to the bright futurist Steve had once been so fond of?
Steve represses the sigh that desperately wants to be released, taking his seat once more without even looking at the rest of the team, "It's about time we decide what we do regarding Wanda."
"I mean we gotta move," Tony decides, and he spins on his heel in the direction of the garage. He'd have to take all the vibranium he'd managed to synthesize earlier -- and the particle accelerator. No one else moves for a moment, but the blood rushing in Tony's ears leaves him no time for a debate, "He wanted those missiles enough to threaten me, but something must have changed. Something spooked him enough to take Howard out--"
A sharp gasp is heard, and Tony's head turns automatically in Sam's direction. The former army man's face is filled with pain, and Tony honestly had no idea he was part of the army when his weapons were used for it. Everyone else looks between Sam and Tony, their concern increasing as Sam started to shake visibly.
"Tony." Steve calls out, and he sees Tony's head snap in his direction with that same withering look on him.
Could one life really outweigh another?
"And if he continues to lay in it you'll all be laying in your graves by the end of the week." Stephen answers with a shrug of his shoulder, like her outburst has no impact on him.
, Steve? What can you possibly say? What is there to say?"
friends, too, Wanda. You don't want to hurt anyone."
They don't
"Steve-" Tony says softly, attmpting to cut him off in case it was too painful for him for him to describe.
Steve takes in another deep breath and turns in Tony's direction. Whatever relationship he and Tony have right now is fragile. It's always been fragile, because they've never been able to see eye-to-eye in the past and it's been a problem for them since they met on the Hellicarrier.
Wanda just stares at him for a beat longer, her smirk widening as she pokes her tongue around her mouth and bites down hard on a familiar capsule that leaves the rest of her mouth blue and foaming,
The AI program with a mind of its own and the desire to eliminate mankind all together.
"Tony!" Steve finds himself shouting; and while he's flinging himself to get closer to the brunet, his teammates are trying to stave Wanda off.
Tony chuckles around his length, and takes advantage of the shudder that racks through Steve's body from the vibrations to take as much of Steve's dick into his mouth. He works his head, feeling the tip hit the back of his throat and causing a few tears to pool in his eyes. Way back when, when he did this type of thing regularly, Tony didn't have much of a gag reflex. It's something he'll have to recondition his body with, that's for sure.
Steve doesn't say a word as he climbs out, but he returns to Tony's side with his palm splayed out against the small of the brunet's back. Tony wants to say the touch is unnecessary, but knowing Steve's there grounds him in a way he never thought someone else's presence would. They wait as the two other cars pull into the driveway; and with the exception of Natasha, who had once worked for Tony's company, everyone seems as impressed and possibly intimidated as Bucky. Steve, too, seems to be fidgeting in place like he'd never thought he'd be at a place like this.
They catch up on everything they've missed about each other. Tony tells her about his travels; about the new places and people he's seen and all the odd jobs he's taken up to afford his current lifestyle. She offers to send him some money, but he just pretends not to have heard it at all.
"Trust me, with this kid in your life -" he nudges Tony with his shoulder, ignoring the incredulous look he's being given, "- it'll be like you never left the circus."
The only thing Steve can think about in his head is that Tony would really hate this guy.
Steve follows him in, wrapping one arm securely around his waist and pulling him back into a searing kiss. Tired and a little lightheaded from the activity, Tony leans all of his weight onto Steve and allows the blond to lick his way into Tony's mouth. Steve, the cheeky bastard, pulls back arter a rough nip on his lower nip.
, neither Steve nor Bucky could have the happiness they wanted to have with each other. Steve had met him, and the pull of fate had him following Tony across the country and dragging the metal-armed man along.
"In every other reality, there were slight changes; and still, the team would have been reparable. There's only one difference in this reality from all the others. Do you want to take a wild guess?"
He loses himself to his thoughts. Images of a young Steve fighting overseas causes tears to sting at the corners of his eyes, but he finds himself grateful for the fact that Steve wasn't harmed by Tony's weaponry. It filled him with warmth to know that despite everything, Steve was still such a good man and surrounded by people who seemed to have the same strand of thought. Tony's been alone for most of his life, but Steve could attract a crowd just with his eyes and goofy grin.
"Tony, I need you."
And despite all the reasons things can go wrong between them and all the reasons he's telling himself to let go because someone as beautiful and kindhearted as Steve doesn't deserve to be roped into Tony Stark's life, his heart proceeds to skip another beat.
"I second that." Bucky snorts, but his tone is void of amusement.
Tony is frozen in place, his suit still covering his frame and his gaze locked on Bucky, whose just as frozen and staring back at him like he's not sure of what to say or do. Unfortunately, Steve is in the same boat.
Pepper's soft voice calls out from over the phone, and he can just imagine her face crinkled in worry, "
Steve. So when Steve reaches to palm against Tony's clothed erection, Tony closes his hand around Steve's and shifts up to press a kiss onto the blond's forehead.
Tony's breath hitches at the thought of it, and he's struck speechless. Steve flashes him another gentle smile and then makes his way out of the garage, and Tony watches his back fade. Steve's an honest type of guy, so Tony knows he means it, but can that really be right? The rest of them really only followed Steve's lead when the blond chased after Tony, why would they want Tony to be a part of their pack? He turns his attention back to the car, but even though his hands are moving and the motor oil is back to coating his skin, he finds that he's unable to focus on the car foor too long.
"God. She's just a kid." Clint groans, tilting his head back in contemplation, "We got her out of that HYDRA base hoping she'd make more of herself and she just turned around and rejoined them? What did we do wrong with her? Where did we
Bucky smiles, but it's a little, uncertain thing. He's not too crazy about Bucky, but he's grateful to know the truth.
He might be imagining the way Steve's voice cracks. He might not. But while some might find Steve's words to be creepy, Tony can't help how his heart is yearning for the blond haired alpha.
They lapse into silence as they finish their sandwiches, and they share the glass of juice between them without even thinking twice about it. It's a comfortable silence, and Tony's unable to stop thinking about how
And Tony?
Which means, they knew all along; or at least, Obadiah and Howard did. They were keeping their distance, for whatever reason, and all the running Tony was doing wasn't actually doing him any good. He was only making things harder for himself, and for the pack that really had nothing to do with him.
Bucky whistles but doesn't comment, and his eyes dart over to Steve with a silent observation he doesn't bother sharing with either of them. By the look on his face, though, it's obvious how James Rhodes is basically Tony's Bucky.
It doesn't take too long from there, and Steve thrusts into his face with desperation. Tony can feel it when Steve's about to release, and Steve tugs at his hair to try and pry him off. Determined and greedy enough to want the taste of Steve to coat his tongue, Tony brings his hand down to fondle at Steve's balls. Just a brush of his knuckles or two later, and Steve grunts as he releases into Tony's mouth.
"You don't have to." Steve tells him, soft and unconvincing.
He gets off his knees slowly, keeping eye contact with Tony as he shifts forward. If words aren't enough to convince the genius, actions will be. He knows that Tony reacts better with touch and affection than he does verbal affirmation. And if that's what Tony needs for reassurance, Steve would give him that.
"That doesn't change the fact you created a monster!" Wanda shoots back, her patience fading spectacularly as she stands from her chair.
Steve sighs in resignation, and he turns around to leave Tony's room, but Tony manages to shoot out of bed and grasp for his arm. Steve freezes at the touch, but he doesn't pull away as Tony's hand slides down to intertwine their fingers.
Bucky doesn't even take a moment to hesitate, "I can't do that, Stark. You're going down a dark road and we don't want to watch you go down it."
"Are you really going to just sit back and let them blackmail you?" Steve asks, and Tony finds himself hating, once more, that Steve's anger is directed towards him.
"I think Clint wants to try one of your smoothies." He tells the bot with a small grin, patting him once on the head, "You know? The one with the motor oil."
"Because in every reality, when Thanos comes to destroy the universe, it's only Tony Stark that stands before him and success."
Stepping into the sanctum with Tony in tow is another feeling all together. It might be the experiences that are added together for Steve, but when the person you're facing decides to step back (Loki), it just feels too good to be true.
"The movie starts at 8, Stark." Natasha's voice quips from the other end of the room, and Tony falters for a moment as his eyes turn to the redhead.
"Are you normally this petulant?" Stephen asks in mild amusement, like her outburst is one of childish nature.
"So tell me again why we can't take him out." Clint says, his tone dark and his lips curled into a grin that has no mirth.
Before he can register it and give Rhodey a dirty look of his own, another mug is placed down in front of him. Steve bends just enough to kiss him on the temple, "I'll grab you another plate and then goo eat at the table so you can get reaquainted. Be good."
"-heart?"
Tony asks, and he feels the dread pool deep in his gut. There's only one kind of favor Obadiah would be asking of him.
"You're telling me I won't have to smell Clint's sweaty feet in a confined space for the next four days?" Sam asks him, and though Tony doesn't turn in his direction, he can just feel the relief in the air, "I don't know what changed but holy hell, I'll take it."
Steve offers a weak smile, and the emotions dancing in his eyes are too much for him to discern right now. He brings his hands up to Steve's face, watching with a shiver of delight when Steve leans forward into his touch. Tony's initiated a few touches since their first meeting, but this feels so intimate that he's stunned at the thought of being able to do it at all.
Tony sits on the couch that the pair abandoned, heart in his throat as he continues to watch the news coverage. The Black Widow is on the scene, and judging by the arrows that are being shot at the alien, so is Hawkeye. Captain America and the Winter Soldier are late to the party but are quick to join the fray, going hand to hand with the alien. Thor is nowhere to be seen, and neither is Hulk. They're down two heavy hitters, if that's the case.
"Ultron." Steve, Natasha, and Tony answer immediately. That's when their secrets had nearly destroyed them, and that's when Steve had decided Tony couldn't be trusted when his emotions were involved.
Unknowingly, he follows the fragrance all the way into the kitchen, where the world's smallest and ugliest coffee maker is dripping away. There's an empty mug just sitting on the counter, and Tony gravitates towards it without so much as a thought. In three seconds flat, he has the mug filled and brought to his lips to take a deep gulp of the miracle water
She doesn't say anything, but her posture screams rage and a beam of metal gets shot out of her hand. It's in the shape of a dagger; and of course it wouldn't be that easy to get Tony back onto their side.
And just like that, every notion of going back to work flies out of Tony's head. The deadline can wait. Tony needs Steve, and
"What?" Steve asks, bewildered. Stephen is implying that - Tony would kill them?
, and fucking
"You look tired." Natasha quips easily, and Tony's eyes flicker from her, to Steve, and then the man sitting beside him and angling so far away that he's practically part of the wall.
Breakfast consists of lukewarm tea that really doesn’t taste like tea and toast with superficially tasting strawberry jam. Compared to the pancakes they would’ve had the day before, it was sorely lacking. Steve now realizes just how much he’d taken advantage of Stark’s kindness over the years. Back then, the pantry was always stocked and the coffee was always piping hot and fresh.
No, He really doesn't mean it, but he wants to. He's only just met Steve and he knows it, and yet, he doesn't want to lose his mate. But he doesn't want to be selfish, either, and he hates that Steve and his
Tony's eyebrows fly upward, and for a moment, he waits for Steve to rescind the invitation. After all, it's Steve's pack, not his, and they don't all seem overly fond of him. That's not even including Bucky, who Tony is actually very wary of himself.
"You are mine, and you are so beautiful."
"No." He says, flat and leaving no room for a disagreement. But like with most other things, Rhodey ignores him entirely and walks away.
"Maybe you should get some sleep," Natasha suggests, and the rest of the pack look to each other and away because she's the only one who can get away with calling him out.
"You think Obadiah orchestrated Afghanistan?" Steve asks, and there's rage building in his chest.
Tony Stark. You should've seen the look on that guy's face when he talked about you. Dude lit up like the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Centre."
"Strange." Tony answers, and he bends down to place the Iron Patriot onto the ground. He's gentle with the battle armor, treating it like it's the most fragile thing in the universe.
"Is there
"Don't give me that look, Steve." Tony sighs, and he's no longer fidgeting with the toolkit at all. His hands are pressed onto the surface of the workbench, and his fingers are shaking.
"I'm good," Tony answers, albeit reluctantly, and no one misses the wheezing as he struggles to catch his breath.
have killed me. You have a lot of pretty words, Steve; but in the end you're just like all the people that tried to kill me because
But while Tony's had every right to be angry with them and still chose to show them mercy, hear them out, and work with them, Wanda's had a singular focus on Tony. Tony, whose name was on the missile that took her family away from him, despite how he hadn't sent that missile at her directly.
Tony shifts and walks away towards the Iron Patriot armor, his fingers caressing the metal components with the reverence of a lover, "I know all about Wakanda and what you've been up to. Why do you think you weren't hunted down like the fugitives you were?"
Tony closes his eyes like he's trying to snap a picture, ingraining this image of Steve into his memories and finding himself immensely grateful at finally knowing what words to say to make himself feel like he's not bringing disappointment to the alpha.
He really should've taken care of it while he was at the tower. Now he's never going to hear the end of it.
person for me." Tony reassures him, and then he drops his hand to take Steve's in it and nods his head in the direction of the elevator, "Let's go home?"
Steve smiles ruefully, his eyes opening again and his head turning back in Tony's direction, "I can't afford that. I work for the government, and they use me for covert operations. I can't let anyone know about me."
Her smile widens a fraction as she lifts a mug of what seems to be tea to her lips, "It feels good not to be cooped up in a car with Bruce and Thor, I'll admit that much."
hi so i'm on a roll with double-updates, so there's the slightest chance you might have missed chapter five. if you haven't, sorry for the confusion. enjoy the chapter!
hide his frustration.
"Sorry. I, uh, don't do too well with emotional vulnerability," he muses, and there's a nervous smile on his face that causes Sam to chuckle in response.
"Tony, you sat back and allowed a world government decide whether or not we'd continue saving the world. You gathered your own allies, including a
And like nothing else, that cuts deep. He's not using his famous cold tone and his cool eyes, but the hurt is so deep and his tone is so small that it nearly shatters Steve's heart. He doesn't look at Natasha, but knows that to her, his words would also strike a chord.
Steve spits out, and the rage on his face is expected. He's not the only one who is furious, either.
Well, that just won't do. Not one bit.
And then, his eyes fall upon Steve's mark. It's faded, ever so slightly, but it's turning a slightly darker shade to leave a permanent imprint on Steve's skin. Tony rightfully feels a little proud of himself as he sees it. He leans forward the rest of the way, allowing his lips to brush over the mark, and Steve's breath hitches.
And then, Steve's body crumbles forward, and all of his weight lands on Tony. He's not squished, per se, but this isn't the most comfortable position in the world. He ignores it, though, bringing his hands down to Steve's shoulders and squeezing the blond against him.
It's been a few weeks since he'd come home following the Mandarin; and in that time, Tony's been preoccupied. Between working at his company, moving all of things out of his penthouse and opening it up to the Avengers for their base of operations, and training to be a part of their team if only to reassure Steve that he'll no longer make reckless decisions on his own, this little reprieve is overwhelming at best.
"What am I supposed to do with that, Steve?" Tony asks, and despite his composed expression, there's this miserable, lonely undercurrent in his tone, "I can't trust you. You can't trust me. We're only here together right now because Strange told you you need me."
A whole day passes without a sign of the genius, who actually shuts and locks the garage door so he won't be disturbed as he designs -- whatever it is he's designing. Steve's concerened and hurt, of course, but there really isn't much he can do about it. He calls James, grateful that Bucky had managed to get the soldier's number, and is only told with fond exasperation that Tony does this whenever he has an idea; that it's best for all of them and their collective sanity that they just give him some space until he's ready to come out on his own.
"Let's go eat." He says, casual and sure of himself.
Yeah, what happened in Siberia was rough and could've gone a lot better. In hindsight, if he'd known that they'd end up fighting to the death on the side of a mountain, he'd have told Tony the truth ahead of time.
Tony hates how he's being commanded by a guy who doesn't know him. He hates the perfect teeth that are showing as Steve's lips curl into an easy grin. He hates knowing no matter how far and how fast he runs, he'll never be able to outrun his fate.
A second later, after shaking his head like he feels as though he made a mistake, Steve turns around and whirls back in the direction of the garage. Maybe it's to get some air, but maybe it's just because he's also tired of Tony's shit. The brunet isn't sure, but he watches the alpha walk away and is silently grateful that Bucky and Sam follow him out. At least they'll keep him company until he simmers down.
"Compromise?" Steve blinks, but the fact that Tony isn't denying him outright seems to be giving him some comfort.
"Didn't take you for the sentimental type, Iron Man." The Winter Soldier grins, and Tony can never understand why that mask just doesn't sit right on his face.
A moment later, he's being hauled out of his seat, tossed over Steve's shoulders in a fireman's carry in the direction of the bedroom. He can't see the state of the bed from over Steve's shoulder; but when he's thrown down onto the mattress it's obvious that Steve hasn't been in his bed in at least a few days. The sheets are tucked in under the mattress in Steve's typical hospital style.
"We were both wrecks when it happened. I left town, trying to find my mate wherever I could. Steve left town when he was 18 to try and help me find them." The smile on Bucky's face is almost bittersweet as he takes another sip of his coffee, "Along the way, we ended up making our own little pack. We're like a band of misfits and losers, without land of our own and just letting adventure guide us. We were in New York; just passing through, really, when he found you. It was like a smack in the face when he realized who you were to him. I was right there when he dove into the water for you, and while I know the kid who got into trouble for smaller things, the way he held you made everything so perfectly clear to me. Steve and I, now that I think about it, we would've never lasted as a romantic couple with how close we are. He's like the kid brother I never had growing up. It was just hard in that moment to realize that not only was he not my mate, but that he managed to find his one and only when he wasn't even looking."
"How do we stop him from doing that?" Steve asks, and this time, his voice is firm and unwavering. It didn't matter how much Tony wanted him dead. He would gladly give up his own life if it meant Tony wouldn't go down the path where he couldn't return from.
The drive to New York is silent, tense, and full of doubtful glances; though, it's not like it's not welcomed. Although Tony feels stronger than ever before by just knowing Steve was sitting beside him, it did little to change what was happening in his life. Howard, albeit reluctantly, his father - dead. Obadiah, even through deceit, a father he would have rather had instead of his own - a possible traitor that wanted him dead. A pack, given to him through nothing but a coincidence - a group of innocents that were going to become colateral damage in something they didn't even fully understand.
"We got a lock on a weakness." Tony tells the team, and he aims another blast at the alien's chest, "Headshot straight through. Nothing else can take it down."
. He mills every last drop out of Steve, swirling his tongue around the head just one more time to clean him up fully, and releases Steve's now flaccid dick. He's going to bring the back of his hand up to wipe his mouth, but Steve still has his hands pressed against Tony's head.
Steve's erection continues to swell from beneath his own crotch, and they're painfully rubbing against one another at this point, and Tony watches the way Steve's Adam's apple bobs. He drags his eyes upward and sees the adoration clearly in Steve's blue eyes.
"Not a chance," Steve quips, and Tony turns his head to see the mischief clear on Steve's face, "'Tasha's told me my face can get an entire army to follow my orders. I know how to work it."
"You're the one on the run, Stark. Who do you think will look worse?" Natasha dares right back, and the slightest glimmer of amusement hits her eyes.
"I hope you drink it black because I don't believe in desecrating the holiness of coffee." Tony places the two mugs down on the counter and takes a seat opposite from Bucky, knowing that at least talking to the man might do something about the many concerns he had about Steve.
(See the end of the chapter for
The anxiety leaves the room immediately, and though some of them still look at him in concern, Tony just ignores it and crosses the room in Steve's direction. He's planning to sit down on the ground, leaning his side against the recliner because at least sitting beside Steve would help appease his thoughts, but the blond manages to grasp out just before he can pass and pulls him down. Tony's not nearly as graceful as he thinks he is, and now he wonders just how he managed to forget to clean off the motor oil.
"They met when Tony went to M.I.T at fifteen." Natasha explains, short and precise and entirely too factual considering they're talking about a teammate and friend.
And then, after another beat,
"We can get it annulled?" Tony asks then, trying to be helpful while his brain is decidedly not. Marriage is one thing, but if the press catches wind on his annulment he'll be the biggest news since Kim Kardashian's wedding a few years back.
"I dreamt about you." Steve admits as he pulls away from their kiss. His eyes are still blown wide in pleasure, his face red and his lips swollen from the intensity of their kiss. His hips have stilled, but he refuses to move away, "I dreamt that you went out in an alien invasion and I couldn't get to you in time."
The ceiling of the sanctum crumbles overhead, and they're only moments away from being crushed by it.
He feels a little better about it when his body is turned, because at least he's not staring at the blueprints anymore, and through his tears he can make out the blurry outlines of Steve's handsome face. He gasps for air, trying to say something -
Steve closes the distance between them, bringing both hands up to gently cup Tony's face between them. It's a surprise that Tony's even let him get this close; and judging by the weight of stares pressing into the back of his head, his team's got questions.
"How do I help a man who does his best to shut me out?" Steve asks, frustrated as he runs a shaky hand through his hair. He's good at reading people, usually; and for the most part, he's good at reading Tony. But for something like this? Tony chose to shut him out. Tony chose to brave this on his own. How was Steve supposed to be able to protect someone who didn't want his protection?
Rhodey's name comes up a few times, too, as they reminisce over the past. She can't tell him much about his other best friend, because while Rhodey is Stark Industries' government liason, he's still employed by the United States Air Force. He's spread out as far as a sheet of paper. Tony just hopes he hasn't forgotten to take care of himself despite all of that.
"Bro, you flew a nuclear warhead into space." Sam guffaws, his tone full of disbelief as he points a finger up in the sky, "If you were pretending to be a hero then you ought to be nominated for an Oscar."
”But?” Bucky asks, and it’s obvious that there’s a disagreement in Stephen’s statement.
Tony shuts the door behind him before even turning in Steve's direction, and his expression is both resigned and bemused, "Trust me. I do want to punch your perfect, white teeth; but I don't think your friends would appreciate that."
"Are we good here?" Bucky asks, raising an eyebrow just slightly.
James takes a moment to drag a hand over his face, and then he sighs deeply. His eyes focus on Bucky's again; Bucky, who hasn't said a single word and this really isn't expected. There's something meaningful in the glance they share, and Steve almost feels like he's intruding on a moment between them.
Tony shifts forward in his seat, his jaw clenched and his eyes dark, "This better be some kind of joke, Wilson."
"Everything happened because of this man that all of you keep forgiving without any consequence!" Wanda continues, nearly bellowing in her anger.
Clint is pressed against the wall, acting like he's some sort of spy and he can listen in through it. Sam is hiding a nasty grin with his hand, even though they all know he's going to be teasing Bucky the moment he steps out of the kitchen. Thor looks as joyfully lost as he usually does, but Steve knows better; while Thor seems unassuming, he's actually a fierce warrior and a brilliant tactican in his own right. Bruce doesn't seem as interested as the rest, but he follows the crowd purely out of boredom. Natasha turns away from the commotion, but it's simply a ruse because she can easily get Bucky to vent to her later, and Wanda is just giggling along because she loves the 'true love' 'one and only' trope.
