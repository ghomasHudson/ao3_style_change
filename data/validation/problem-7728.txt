“I just asked Heimdall to show me where my hammer landed,” Thor suddenly spoke up. And boy, did he sound mad. “It’s at our communal level, and so are two AIM scientists and our friend, Tony.”
They turned left and entered the room in the medical unit. Thor and Clint were seated on the visitors’ chairs. Clint stood up once he saw the others enter.
She froze. She was just looking at Tony, as if he said something crazier than what he usually says. “What?” she managed to ask.
I promise this is the last battle chapter!
“Tony, you’re a genius. Don’t ever let Howard’s words get to you,” Steve’s firm voice was heard.
“Thanks.” He smiled at her. He really needed one, actually.
Something crashed on top. “Shit!” Bruce shouted as he ran down the stairs. His towel was strapped around his waist, which he was clutching and he wasn’t wearing a shirt. He was still wet from the shower, there was water dripping down from his hair. He came to a complete halt when he saw the gang seated on the sofa. He totally forgot to consider the possibilities of the gang coming face-to-face with him. None of his teammates had seen him in this state before, maybe except Natasha.
He flew up to where the situation room was, past the wall of fame. That was Tony’s idea, to hang photos of the team taken years earlier. All of them at least have a light smile on their faces. Oh, those good times...
“It took you this long to realize that, Clint,” Steve raised an eyebrow at him.
Tony felt his tears welling up, an effect of pushing his thoughts and feelings away too quickly. But he even managed to suppress that, because, let’s face it, some of the people he loved were gathered in the room with him. They made him so happy and he felt loved with them around. He’d rather laugh with them right now, than cry.
“Banner!” Thor called out. He entered the garden. “What are you doing? I told you to get to the Bifrost!”
Happy reading!
Natasha waited for the pan to get slightly warm. “So, how’s things with you and Tony?”
Tony’s face was covered with tears. When he realized that, he immediately wiped his face using the sleeves of his sweatshirt. Bucky’s eyes had tears too. He stepped forward.
I hope you guys are pumped to see what will happen in part 3 to Tony and to all the characters. All I can say is, part 3 is gonna be epic!!
Or so they thought.
“Jarbis, is everyone asleep?” he asked.
“But I don’t remember touching the stone. So how did I de-age?” Bucky asked.
Linda was filming this whole thing silently. Soon, she was filming Tony walking around the house like a big boss, his milk bottle on his left hand and cake on the other, which he fed to the other baby Avengers. Kayla had to wipe off cream from every baby's face. When Tony fed Steve, he tripped on a toy and nearly fell down. Steve was quick to hold him. But there was cream from his mouth to all the way down his shirt, near his abdomen. He chuckled at that. Tony looked slightly frightened.
Steve took out another pan and spread butter on it. Once it got warm enough, he dipped a slice of bread into the egg mixture he did and placed it onto the pan. “So that’s where you’ve been. I always thought you went for dance practice.”
“Kid me had a lot of weird stuff,” Tony said, while thinking about the washed-out photograph.
Once he entered the elevator, he sighed and slumped down against the smooth brown wall. “Friday, I’m the worst, aren’t I?”
Jarvis placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder. Steve wiped his tears and let out a shaky sigh.
Steve nodded his head. Both of them silently walked out of the lab.
“Alright guys,” Tony yawned. “Let’s go for lunch. It’s just that down there, near the seaside, a nice burger place.”
“Sam, please tell me the girls are staying here,” Bruce said. He was looking at the toys he had once played with.
They land at the Tower first.
“Gosh it smells good here,” Ana cooed as she walked in behind the boys. “You guys make great chefs!”
“Hey don’t panic,” Steve gave him an amused look. “Okay, do you have a plan?”
Tony looked at the little boy. He ruffled the boy’s hair and tried to ignore the ache that was growing in his chest area. He then moved his hands, so that his big and warm palms were holding Peter’s little ones. He gave the boy a smile. “I’ll try.”
Tony almost laughed at his words. But he pushed that feeling away. “Look Steve, that video was just an experiment of lying and telling the truth. It’s nothing more.”
“How are you guys?” Kayla asked the others.
Sam jogged to the
“Come friend Tony!” Thor shouted. “Let us merrily walk into the water!”
“Tony, you were with the heavy hitters and gave us information on where the cybernauts were going. Good work there. But that stunt you pulled at us by crashing right into the plane filled with cybernauts… that was bad and please don’t do it again,” Steve put it nicely.
“What do you mean escaped?!” Fury suddenly raised his voice, causing the Avengers to snap their attention back to the present situation. He had been talking to an agent using his walkie talkie.
Thank you for your support, guys.
“Bleeding should be stopping soon. Other than that, I think he’s mad at you for going up,” Bruce replied.
After desert was done, the six of them sat back and hoped they wouldn’t be consumed by food coma. They had no heart to stand up, but they all did, not wanting to be chased out by the maître d.
Steve shrugged. “I’m okay. Just worried about Clint.”
They started with level 1. It was just the living room and an open kitchen. Then the door to the basement and the back door. They went to the back first. Bruce followed them for the tour. It was his second time looking around the house. He figured he could walk around with the team. Outside, he was looking at the ground. He was planning to bury the stone deep just a meter away from the back door. Tony kind of knew what Bruce might have been thinking. While the whole team walked around the small backyard, which had a 4-seat swing set and a mini mahogany table with matching chairs, Tony walked to Bruce.
“You need the other stone for that.”
“See you Sam and Scott,” Steve sighed. Wanda and Bucky gave them a nod.
“But do you think there was someone else who could have… instigated the leader to make him get the stones?” Bruce asked.
“The Hulk came out,” Tony smiled. His eyes were still watery, and that smile he had made Bruce’s heart melt.
The rest of them agreed. They all were determined to find their friend, whatever it was going to take. They got their bag and quickly went to their car.
Clint was just too curious. Plus we see part of what the stone can do.
“Hey Pep, how can I help you?” Tony sat on the side of his bed.
He jogged to the elevator, praying that it would still be here. He kept pushing the elevator button. Tony hoped that Steve was still in the lab and not coming out to talk to him.
And Tony couldn’t help it but smile at that. The man must have seen Tony’s face, looking really worried when he was still in the car.
“So you and Barton,” Bruce started. “How did you guys get to know one another?”
Before Steve and Tony could step out, the machine buzzed wildly and both of them vanished. There was smoke coming out of the cube and after a few seconds, the ceiling of the cube crashed.
Steve was about to disagree. But he knew he couldn’t. The girls and the babies had to be safe here. They have to wait for Thor to come back with the cure. The stone being here only posed further danger for the occupants of the house. The Frost Giants could come any time and it’s all too risky. Doctor Strange was right; Steve needed his help and he had come at the right time.
“Yeah. Thanks Tony.” Sam was about to walk back. But he stopped and bent down slightly. “I’m sorry about what happened.”
send them back!” Steve ordered.
Tony went up to the reception desk.
“I’ll see you two and Chippy soon,” Sam smiled. He gave the dog a little pat on his head. “Thank you, Lindy and Kay-Kay. Take care for now. I need to speed this back to Manhattan!”
“Tony, your shirt’s not right!” she shouted. She started to run, not being able to stand a fashion disaster.
“Good to know.” Tony stretched.
Steve kneeled down beside him. He slowly lifted Tony’s head and placed him on his lap. The rest of them stood around him.
We need them. Now that the other half is going to Earth, these beasts may go there just to retrieve it. And we need each other. I will come once the time is right.” Bruce nodded. Thor gave a sad smile. He was very devastated when he heard about the rift between his friends.
“Do any of them need a diaper change?” Kayla asked as she entered the house with several plastic bags. “Oh and how’s the stone?”
“Bruce.” Natasha touched his arm. “You did what you thought was right. That’s all any of us can do at a given situation.”
“Go!” one of the men shouted. All the AIM scientists lined up in front of him started to charge at him. They seemed to forget that they were going after a little boy.
“Master Stark no!” Jarvis cried. He then held Tony, and stopped him from giving Howard’s abdomen area a nice kick.
leader. They should be together.” Iron Man flew past Steve and the team. He gave them a thumbs up before flying higher. Thor joined his side after a few seconds.
“This is good!” Bucky smiled.
“Nights guys,” Bruce yawned. “See you all tomorrow.”
The others were looking at the car, not knowing what to say. They’ve been here for only over a day and they already felt like they were soaked into the rich life.
“Jarvis, get me my suit from the Tower,” Tony ordered his AI.
“Thanks, and we do,” Steve sighed. “Reed and Sue, I need you two to push back with us. Sue, create shields for anyone in danger, you can join Wanda there. Johnny, we need firepower. I need you to direct your flames into the portal. And Ben, join the Hulk. It’s clobberin time.”
Within seconds, Scott said, “Oh Tony, I have an instant regret on this decision.”
Avengers access to. Tony keyed in his codes and the lab doors opened with a “hiss”.
“The food is good today, Jarvis,” Howard commented. “Who made this?”
“I wouldn’t classify it as one,” Bruce explained. “It’s too weak to be one. It’s more like you eating bad food that’s given you a stomach upset. It’ll eventually wear off, but will leave you weaker.”
Tony smiled as he saw Dum-E stretching out a smoothie at him. Tony took it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He is, boss. He is speeding here in his Harley. ETA in about 4 minutes,” the AI replied.
The tense atmosphere in the kitchen melted away right after that. Tony released his grip from Steve’s hand, and simply looked at his food.
Natasha on the other hand, fired her widow bites at any scientist who dared to go near Tony. Clint shot an explosive arrow at the ceiling above him. It ticked off, and the ceiling blasted off, making a few AIM scientists hiding in there fall down. There were three of them, and all groaned in pain.
“Don’t worry, Clint,” Tony smiled. “All the main events start from tomorrow.”
Hi guys! Sorry for my absence. I've been really busy with internship and school stuff and had no time to upload the chapters. But thank you for sticking with me and here's a new chapter! I hope you guys enjoy it. Thank you so much for your support so far, guys! I really appreciate it. :)
It took all of Tony’s willpower to not let the tears reach the surface of his eye. He nodded his head and gave Jarvis a weak smile.
“But Clint’s stuff is still undone and I have that Bible project with Reed!” Tony countered back.
“Oh no!” Scott suddenly said. “Tony look out!”
“Did someone say
“Yeah,” Tony tried to calm himself down. “Yeah, just… just take us to the Tower.”
“So why not… talk to him?” Clint asked. “Find the time and just talk it all out.”
“Please do make yourselves at home!” Jarvis smiled. He was looking at the kids from level 2. “Please do sit down and I’ll get something for you all to eat and drink!”
Scott ran out of the alley and changed his size back to normal.
After the show ended, both of them spoke about ice-cream, flying cars and the Avengers. Somehow, their conversation topic changed to Steve.
Howard stopped dead on his tracks. He immediately turned back and walked towards Tony, making him regret his words.
Within the next five minutes, the Limo pulled up outside the steakhouse. There were couples walking in, looking as good as the six of them did. Thor was the first one to open the door. He held it for the others to get out. What they didn’t expect was paparazzi to gather around them immediately. Natasha got out next, with Thor helping her out, and she didn’t appreciate the flashes being pushed right into her face. The guys slowly poured out next, and didn’t know whether to smile for the cameras or walk away. The last one was Tony, who had an experience with the paparazzi.
“Go away big boo!” Bucky stuck his tongue out at the bird doll. Sam chuckled at that.
“Gentlemen,” a smooth male voice came from the front door. “Please, at ease.”
A soldier tried firing at them, but Steve used his shield to push him away.
It was 10pm. The team was sitting around the couch, trying to figure out which TV channel to watch. Well, that was half of the team, who were Natasha, Clint, Steve and Sam. The other half, Tony, Bruce, Wanda and Bucky wanted movies. Tony and Wanda were browsing through the girls’ CD collection to pick a movie. They all wanted a relaxed night before they fly back to New York to face the possible threat from the Frost Giants.
Tony rolled over. He looked like he was in pain. “Yeah, right Chippy.” He hissed.
They all nodded. The house tour ended, leaving all of them feeling exhausted.
“Come quick. It’s boring without my science buddy.” Bruce pouted, acting like he was sad.
All Steve told him was:
Steve yanked a gun from a soldier, before kicking him into the East River. He tossed it aside before running to them.
Tony turned to look at him. “He is fine. Recovering. I mean, the exoskeleton is helping him a lot. He is at the Tower with Vision now.”
“Push it forward and then back,” Johnny suggested and pushed the controls forward.
“It’s fun punching the bag!” Bucky laughed.
Steve finally stood up. He stretched pretty loudly. This caught Tony’s attention. He turned to look at Steve, who let out a sigh and turned towards the pilot seat. They both made eye contact, just staring into each other’s soul.
He recognized the figure. It was Captain America! Slipping between consciousness and unconsciousness, Tony saw a particular memory floating around him.
Tony turned back to his papers. Steve continued to look at Tony. He was wishing he could say everything he wanted to.
None of the AIs were responding, and Steve knew this was a recipe for disaster. He quickly slipped into a pair of track pants and a shirt, and took his shield.
“Almost?” Thor surveyed the area around them, now littered with debris and glass shards.
Tony let Clint go once he felt him relax. Both of them stood back up, straightening themselves.
Everyone in the house were staring at a man, with a long red cloak and a beard that resembled somewhat of the adult Tony Stark’s.
“Right, so you both are more than willing to throw me out of the Tower,” Sam laughed.
“Peter, where were you all night? I was panicking! I called Ned and he said you weren’t with him either!” she pulled him for a very tight hug.
“I only booked one table,” Tony blurted out, still staring into Steve’s blue eyes. “And… it’s okay Steve. It’s my pleasure.” Tony surely felt his cheeks going warm.
Tony sighed in frustration. He tossed his phone to the side and kept driving. He wanted to go home and crash onto his bed with his friends. But his mind wasn’t giving up on thinking about Obadiah, the company and his father’s accusation.
The elevator had already arrived. Both of them got into it.
“You fucking bastard!” Tony shouted. Rage filled his every nerve, and fueled his movements.
Steve’s eyes snapped open. “Oh my God Jarvis…” he nearly fell onto the floor as realization crashed onto him. “I know where Tony is!!”
He then went to look at his mother, who was sitting by the window side in her room, crying too. Howard had given her shoulder a squeeze.
“As sad as that pun would be,” Natasha rolled her eyes.
Tony smiled back. He quickly entered Steve’s room.
Thor threw the soft remnants of the stone at the portal. He then raised his hammer up to get some lightning. Tony fired his unibeam straight into the middle of the portal while Thor poured lightning into it with full power.
“Friend Steve, you are supposed to be encouraging,” Thor pursed his lips and crossed his arms.
“So, I was scared. I did all the research I could, prepared myself as best as I could and here I am, experiencing the real thing,” he continued. “I gotta thank Professor Williams for many engaging lessons and for all of you for being such amazing peers, honestly, maybe this was a good choice after all!”
hungry.
“My burger didn’t have much salt anyways,” Bruce shrugged.
Jarvis decreased the shades in Tony’s room, letting the morning sunlight cascade on the floor. The light slapped Tony in his face, as if he needed more pain in his life. He jerked awake, wondering how he got to his room when the last thing he remembered was crying in his lab.
“No way, no it didn’t,” Tony couldn’t help but laugh. “It didn’t cleanse me. It just made life worse for me. And if you do that to a group of people, you’re going to destroy the very foundation that is holding this society together.”
“Tony, good morning!” Maria Stark said. She pulled her son towards her. “It’s good to see you up this early.” She ruffled his hair and realized Tony didn’t even smile at her comment. “What’s up Tony?”
“Aurora, like Sleeping Beauty,” Tony smiled.
Clint let out a cry and buried his face into Natasha’s lap, who then proceeded to laugh and brush back Clint’s hair.
“I remember vaguely, you apologized to me in Boston.”
The hallway in the helicarrier which led to Tony’s room, was absolutely quiet. The only sounds that could be heard were the footsteps of Steve, Bruce and Natasha.
“I’m calming you down. Now relax into my hug, doctor!”
Clint and Natasha were doing their own work while looking up at the session at random times. Bruce and Steve were the only ones watching the session without any distraction.
Natasha smiled. “Oh Bruce, it goes a long time back.” She reminisced. “My parents died in Russia due to a fire. But I was safe. I was able to get to my mother’s friend’s house in Idaho. I saw her as my aunt, and called her that. So, I was five and went to the States and it was only a couple of years since the Cold War had ended. I had other kids bullying me because of my accent and because I was from Russia. My aunt’s son, even he called me all sorts of names and wanted me out of the house.”
“Clint! Stop it!” Tony tried to get Clint back. “Stop this shit, man! Look at me!”
Memories of the ice and cold came rushing back to Steve. He managed to suppress a shudder. “I don’t know, Tony. But all I know is that I’m here now, and you’re here too.”
“Good job,” Natasha smiled at him.
A little information about Wilson Fisk and how he got to know about our dear Natasha Romanoff!
“Yes,” Bruce replied. “It’s the cure, Tony.”
Tony moved closer, and snuggled onto Steve. Steve curled an arm around Tony, and the other arm brushed back his hair. Tony relished the warmth Steve’s body provided him with. He sighed in content.
Tony looked very different whenever he was thinking. The pen held between his index and middle finger, with the clicker placed exactly on the middle of his lower lip, Steve never failed to notice how unique this was. This reminded him of the nights the team spent in the Tower together. Tony was always in his lab, while the rest of the team argued about whether to have a movie night or not. Steve was the one who often went down to check on Tony. He always seemed to be trying to improve his suits. Whenever he was considering a design, the pen would be held in this unique way. Steve always smiled at that.
happening inside Stark. But oh well… he could have some help searching for evidence. After that, they would not get involved in any shit related to SI.
“Well,” the doctor started. She checked the heart monitors and the IV drip. And she wrote something down on her notepad. “You’re in the S.H.I.E.L.D helicarrier, which is currently flying up high above the States. So, I guess, it’s white outside because of the clouds.”
Thank you so much for your support!! Please do leave feedback if you want to!
The others gathered below looked up. Tony and Scott were looking down at how Thor was wrestling the Frost Giant. Bucky began to shoot but it had little effect.
“You know, it’s just ankle sprains. I can walk soon!” Tony huffed.
T’Challa stepped forward next and placed his bouquet on the coffee table. “I hope we cross paths again.” Both he and Tony shook hands.
There was a little giggle from one of the cots. Steve immediately turned and saw baby Tony watching them. He was biting the cot’s frame and was drooling onto them. He was hugging his Captain America plush and his face had an adorable smile plastered across. Or more of a smirk with a tinge of jealousy. Steve blinked several times, thinking he was seeing things.
He stopped once he saw the tears in Kayla’s eyes. He placed his mug on the coffee table and came to sit beside her.
“I use that to call lightning and cast it onto the bad people,” Thor replied. “If I swing it fast and right, I can also achieve the state of flight.”
Tony grinned. “You sure know me!” he took his Captain America and Iron Man teddy bears and walked out of the room, with Jarvis showing the way.
Tony walked across the gym and stopped at the edge. He looked down and saw four figures jumping around the seashore. Tony swore to God that he heard Clint’s girly screams and Thor’s laughter.
"We so have to tell Jane about this!" Bruce suggested.
Tony turned the car to the right, out of the road and stepped on the brakes, hard. He activated the hazard lights while Steve rushed out of the car. He slid down and ended up on the sandy ground. Tony too, got out of the car.
Tony nearly threw the frames at Steve, who was leaning against the wall near the door, thinking it was an intruder. And then, his little eyes widened.
Thank you for reading this story so far! I mean, it's 19 chapters over a span of a few weeks. Also, thank you for your support so far! It always keeps me going.
“General Ross,” Rhodey greeted curtly. “How can I help you?”
Steve stopped abruptly, causing his nose to bump on Tony’s. He squeezed his eyes shut before moving away. Tony immediately turned away to his blanket.
Tony is me when it comes to brain-to-mouth filter.
“Wow, you’re kidding right?” Clint laughed. “Because I heard, when the first time you two met once you grew older, you two fought with each other.”
With Natasha and Clint there, the press people couldn’t get a clear shot of little Tony’s face. They all huffed in frustration.
The man gave him a mock salute, before sitting back down on his chair. Tony placed the box on the seat beside him and sped off back home.
“I don’t know if I continue to want to get hurt,” Steve sat down on the bench and tied his shoelaces. “Whatever I say, Stark has a counter and it hurts… I don’t know if I want to try anymore, guys.”
he thought to himself. However, he got up and joined both Wanda and Clint outside.
“They’re in my house. Let them deal with it,” Tony scoffed while taking a sip from his smoothie.
“Have I entered at the wrong time?” All of a sudden, Vision’s voice was heard.
“Right here,” Thor said in an assuring tone. Beside him, the Hulk roared, ready to attack.
“Ok, what do you want, little princess.” He thought to himself aloud.
“It’s being synthesized a few labs away. It’ll be ready by tomorrow morning.”
Will the Avengers be prepared enough?
“Do you like the toast?” Linda asked Clint while running down the stairs.
“I’m fine,” Tony smiled. He rested his head on her shoulder, feeling the chiffon material of her dress and smelling her Victoria’s Secret perfume.
Before Tony could say anything, Steve closed the gap and caught Tony’s lips in a kiss. His lips were cool, probably because of the ice cream, but they were so comforting and soft. Tony felt elevated and giddy as he Steve held him closer. He was losing himself into Steve’s kiss, not that it was a bad thing, it’s just… no one else had made him feel this way before. So protected, safe and loved.
“I don’t know about fun, really. It melts the stress away. It’s like you are punching your problems away.” Natasha made some hand maneuvers, which kind of impressed Bucky.
“We have been waiting for about 3 minutes,” he smiled smugly. “But the short cut was horrible. So much of bumps and a fucking bee nearly stung me.”
“We do.” Tony finally spoke. This was the fourth time he was listening to Bruce speaking about the stone. Hence Tony had nothing much to say.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up. He wasn’t even aware of being in the helicarrier. He thought he was in some hospital, on the ground.
“This…,” she showed him the torn papers. “They uh… they are from my professors. For my internship, to join the Donald Blake Medical Group. Actually… DB is having a little course during the next break, and I want to show them the letters and tell them I’m interested… So… Anyway, someone bumped into me and I fell down and they fell into a puddle and someone stepped on them…”
Tony crossed his arms across his chest, giving her the
Rhodey had goosebumps all over him.
Something in Tony snapped.
When Rhodey saw Sam approach him after the quinjet left, he was surprised. He didn’t have any grudge against him. Sam dodged Vision’s power because, that’s what anyone would have done to defend themselves. Plus Vision was distracted.
“Where…” Tony groaned as he pushed himself up on his couch.
By now, Tony knew was in the future, his adult-self became a super hero, his good friends’ names were Ceen Bartton, Nataasha aka Nat, Stee Rogers, Buce Banner aka Doctor Banner and Thor, an actual demi-God, and that his company actually did manage to make flying cars, but were not for sale, yet.
Fear. If anyone asked any one of the AIM scientists that managed to break into Avengers Tower that night how they felt when they were facing Tony, fear was the word they would use to describe it.
With anger blinding him, he went straight to the Frost Giant and socked him in his jaw. The assailant wasn’t expecting this. His grin vanished.
“Bucky, thank you for encouraging me. Even as a toddler, you kept me going, pal.”
“Just get us there faster,” Clint cried out. “Thor’s bear hugs are getting unbearable!”
Tony’s jaw dropped, and his mouth formed the shape of a perfect o.
“Lunch is downstairs. I hope,” Tony smiled.
“Then get them back,” Steve sighed. The battle was going nowhere and Steve knew all teams were tired already.
Happy reading, guys!
“I had good reasons to do that,” Rhodey smiled. “We just didn’t want to talk to irritating idiots.” He made eye contact with Natasha, nodding his head. She immediately knew what the matter was.
Bucky pulled Tony for a hug. He hugged him tightly, assuring him that he was forgiven and that he was fine. Tony returned the hug. He buried his face into Bucky’s shoulders. Bucky was patting Tony’s back slowly. After a while, they let go. Both men were wiping their tears.
“Oh my God…” both of them whispered in utter shock.
He walked all the way to the entrance of the Engineering school and stood there, waiting for Steve. He prayed he wouldn’t have to run into Tiberius or Whitney today. He was in a good mood and didn’t want it to be ruined.
“Welcome back, Cap,” Clint said. There was a hint of gratefulness in his tone.
“Holy fuck…” Clint whispered, looking at little Tony easily knocking off a few AIM personnel using Thor’s hammer.
Tony took the box full of strawberries, and the others followed him. “We’re driving a couple of meters down.”
For now, Tony was recovering well. Doctors said he could be waking up after a few hours if everything goes well.
“Of course Nat!” Clint grinned. “Hey everything between us is settled right?”
“Look,” Tony said. “I’m really sorry for the damage. I’ll pay for the costs, which is gonna be so much. I feel it. And then, we need to renovate the communal level and-”
“I’ll miss you, Cap.”
She walked up the stairs. She let out a long yawn before opening the door to the kids’ room. She was not prepared to look at the scene in front of her.
“This is my first time in a freaking Limousine!” Clint nearly screamed out in excitement.
Steve cleared his throat. “Sam, you are looking at the Avengers.”
Upon entering the kitchen, they saw Steve and Tony hugging and Ana and Jarvis working side by side at the dining table. They could also feel the atmosphere in the kitchen, and knew something was wrong.
“Is he…” Clint started. But he couldn’t bring himself to say it.
was the first thought he had.
“Adagio Eats Cafe. The best dish according to employee surveys is their meatball Parmesan sandwich ,” he replied.
He stopped moving the arm. He slowly turned to look at Tony with a serious expression settled on his face. “Why?” He nodded at his new arm. Plus he couldn’t help but ask.
“Oh spoilsport!” Linda scoffed.
Tony dropped his shovel and ran into the house. Steve and Wanda did the same. The girls, along with Bruce, were bringing the 3 babies from the basement to the living room. Tony’s eyes widened with shock.
Tony was so confused and surprised to see Steve Rogers staring back at him like a deer caught in headlights. He was torn between asking Reed, “why didn’t you tell me Steve was invited?” and “Steve himself is here?”
“So, can we start again?” Steve asked with a soft smile.
“Boundaries, Clint,” Bruce’s calm voice answered Clint’s query.
“You both are… well, more than friends,” Natasha said. She was curling Tony’s hair using her finger.
Everyone is going back to what they were doing and Tony recovers.
“Thor, can you get an aerial view and see where the Frost Giant leader is?” Tony requested. He went back into his armor. “Give me full control.” He instructed his AI.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It fucking hurts, J,” Tony groaned. “And Steve, gosh the colossal idiot who just went up to talk to dad. What if dad had hit him?”
“I know, my kick was pretty light-hearted too,” Natasha smirked and helped Clint up, whose face was red like the strawberry he was eating.
Everyone agreed on the plan and ran off to change up. Tony wanted to argue but Steve’s plan sounded pretty fine. Plus, Tony would love to have a day where he didn’t debate with Steve about anything. Hopefully, today could be that day.
Please feel free to leave a comment about how you find the story! I promise I won't bite! :D
Bruce pressed his level and the door shut buttons. Little Tony enthusiastically waved at him, and Bruce did wave back with a grin.
“When the hell are you going to ask him out officially, Rogers?” Natasha got straight to her point. She placed the first few bacon strips on the pan and it began to sizzle.
“Friend Tony, that was good!” Thor grinned. “I can see that you're nervous but… don't be! The world is your stage, and you are a confident performer. Believe in yourself and you're already halfway there.”
“I see him,” Clint said. “He’s taking off in the Quinjet.”
“Oh man,” Rhodey was panting. He was leaning against the dining table.
“We will,” Steve smiled.
“I missed you so much,” she whispered.
?” Clint was astounded.
He then did a little ballet move, followed by a series of body shakes that had Steve laughing till his belly began to hurt.
“Tony,” Thor said firmly. “You have extreme powers. Friend, stop this. We need him alive.”
“Oh my god, you’re not wearing shoes,” Jan’s eyes widened.
“Is that what I think it is?” Tony pointed at the bottle.
Scott was looking up at the skies. The night sky was slowly turning pinkish-orange, which meant dawn was settling. A shiver ran down his spine, he was only wearing shorts and a top. He wrapped his arms around himself.
“Buce?” Tony asked softly, looking at him.
Bruce nodded his head. The AIM scientist, who was the leader, handed over a vial which had a pink liquid bobbing around in it. Bruce took it.
“Formula milk, some books, some toys, clothes, baby soap, powder, shampoo, baby food, towels, wipes and whatever we see as useful when we’re looking around,” Kayla listed down. Tony was just overwhelmed.
Mjolnir was picking up speed.
Once the Doctor released Tony from his lap, he and Clint toddled to where Clint’s toy telephone was.
“Sorry Steve…” Clint sighed. “I always forget the most important details.” He chided himself.
“Maybe.”
“Team 1, at the first portal behind me; Bucky try to take them out using your capabilities. Hulk, keep smashing them into the portal. Wanda, use your powers to push them back or rip them apart. If you see any of us in danger, create shields. Iron Fist, join us here. Clint, you join the others there. Spidey, wrap the Giants together and swing them back. Nat, you stay with me. We take down any Frost Giant who crosses that Spanish café,” Captain America just fired orders. There were movements among the two teams.
“I did?” Tony said, in awe. “So is he doing his job well?”
Happy reading!
Kayla turned towards him, her laughter dying. Natasha stopped coloring and turned to look at Steve. His tone changed the atmosphere in the house.
Beside him, Carson Wyche snorted. “Tell me about it.”
Tony didn’t say anything. He quickly got out of the armor and flung his arms around Steve’s neck. “Dad found you!” he squealed in joy.
! I saw the blueprints already.”
At Business School, Clint was walking down the concourse briskly, looking absolutely pissed. He was looking at every single study table for either Fisk or Wesley. He was breathing in and out heavily, not focusing on where he was. Just needed to see either face and punch it inwards was what Clint was hoping to do.
Tony had a very light smirk. “You tell
Steve was looking away too, at the yacht that was just stupidly bobbing about. It seemed that Captain America himself was tongue-tied.
Natasha laughed. “Gosh you boys are more innocent than you look.”
Antman was also helping by kicking two Frost Giants back when he was reverting back to his normal size. That sent them back. He pushed one of them to, Bucky who helped by punching him using his new adamantium arm. That Frost Giant flew in.
“I think they do,” Steve sighed. He was staring at the news anchor sharing Twitter posts about the ordeal.
That night. When Tony had thrown up on Steve’s uniform. It was a great night.
“How does Fury know we’re here?” Tony asked.
“I have trapped him in another dimension. Not to worry for now. Thor will be here in 2 days,” Doctor Strange assured Steve.
Tony came hard, for the second time. His seed spurted out onto Steve’s chest and abdomen area. Steve felt Tony’s ass clench and unclench on his cock. And that intense feeling made him come hard. He released his come into Tony, again, filling him up for good. Both of them shouted out their names. They were a panting and sweaty mess by the end of the session.
“I’m sure your dad will be happy,” he said.
Home indeed, Bruce.
"Jarvis did a scan on you both when we were talking," Natasha started to explain. "He picked up some teleportation residue from you and no way were you two hiding behind a fake skin to attack us. So, welcome to our universe."
“Cap, we got Nightshade,” Sam spoke up.
Tony turned behind to have one last look at Steve. Steve waved at him for as long as he could. But he was forced to focus on the battle. He continued to push back, along with Natasha.
“So I’ve been told.” Kayla smiled. “Come here.”
“Okay guys,” Tony said. “Rides first or stalls first?”
“Someone bumped into you?” Tony asked, frowning. He went back to her and sat back. He threw an arm around her shoulder to calm her down.  She rested her head on his shoulder, letting her tears rise back up to the surface again.
“I know,” Tony said. “I saw the photos on Cap’s bedside table.”
“Uh, F.R.I.D.A.Y,” Tony frowned at the tablet. “Why were the sprinklers in the kitchen on four days ago?”
Bruce heaved out a huge sigh. His worst fear was the stone having more cracks than what it already had. He knew that he was lucky enough not to turn into his younger self when he came to earth from Asgard. Definitely the ride back must have taken a toll on the stone, there
“Dammit!” Clint swore. He wiped a sweat bead rolling down his forehead. “I was this close to winning!”
“Funny, that’s exactly what Pepper said,” Tony turned to him, contemplating on whether he should eat his lunch later. But he had more to do with Pepper so this was the only best timing to eat.
“How do you know him, Tony?” Rhodey asked, nodding towards Peter.
For a few seconds, everything was silent. The dust was slowly settling down. Doctor Strange’s knees gave out and he dropped down to rest on the road. The rest of them slowly began to rise up. Ben helped Doctor Strange up once he could stand well.
His first course of business was to throw away the almost full bag of vomit. He washed his hands using the water bottle, before chugging down the remaining water. Once he tossed it into the bin, he took in a deep breath.
“Wow,” Tony whispered.
“No,” Tony said firmly. “Thor, it’s yours. I… I can’t do it. I’ve made weapons in the past that killed others… I can’t. Maybe if I need to I will but now, I’ll let Mjolnir be with you.”
They were on their way to Boston, Massachusetts.
“Why didn’t you?” Natasha was still talking with her voice raised. She chucked her two slices of strawberry jam toasts into her Tupperware box.
With that, he dropped baby Wanda. She landed on the couch, chest flat. A very scared Linda immediately scurried to get that baby girl. She hugged her and tried to calm her. She checked for any injuries. There was nothing, but Linda made sure Wanda was breathing properly. And she was.
Both the little boys’ eyes widened.
He gave one of the bags a kick. STUPID FUCKING MISTAKE!! It hurt like a bitch and he felt his toes throbbing. Fuck.
“He flew in here earlier,” Bruce managed. He pointed at the ceiling, denoting that Tony was already up in the Tower.
“Oh yeah? I could give two shits about you presenting here,” Whitney stood up. “I’m gonna ruin you, Tony. I’m gonna take you down and you’ll regret putting this module as a choice. You make a shit actor and I will make sure you fail!”
Sam pulled the car door shut. He sighed as he placed the key in the ignition. It was going to be a long night ahead of him. He made a U-turn at the end of the street before speeding by the girls again. Linda and Kayla watched him go in silence while Chippy barked at the car till it disappeared after making a left turn.
The others who were there, ran to the opposite side of the street. Luke, Jessica and Doctor Strange sent the last of the Frost Giants into the portal before leaving the area.
Pepper’s jaws had dropped. She looked like she had seen Tony with three heads, which he wouldn’t mind. Things were unconventional today, actually had been for the past few days, thanks to Hydra.
“Hey Jenny,” he smiled at her. “How’s everything?”
“Not really,” Steve said. He looked like he was reminiscing a fond incident.
“The hideout?” Steve asked, wiping the tears from his eyes.
“Well you…” Clint breathed in and out. He looked into Tony’s blue eyes and felt goosebumps form on his skin. “Are worthy…”
“Hey, hey Tony,” Steve smiled a sad smile. “You’ll be fine. Medics will be here soon, we’ll get you out of this mess, I promise.”
“Alone?” Steve looked at them. “As in, no parents?”
Tony leaned forward and planted a kiss on Steve’s cheek. He then giggled, making Steve laugh.
Tony’s eyes welled up as he thought about it. “Do you remember, mom? Once you and me cooked dad breakfast and he tossed the plate away and made us throw away everything we did?”
“No worries, we can always start again.” Tony smiled.
Please do drop any feedback you have. I'd be more than happy to read it and reply! :)
“What is it, Friday?” Tony sighed, wiping his grease coated hands on his grey sweatpants, staining it. His olive-green tank top was sweat coated, from the long hours of hard work he was doing in his lab.
Right after he said that, Tony jumped up his bed and dashed to the washroom to vomit.
“Have I told you how much I love the beach?” Clint’s cheerful voice was heard. The others were entering the house after an enjoyable day out.
“Did you two manage to sell all the items?” Tony asked. There was another call coming from General Ross, but Tony cancelled it. He decided to take all the heat later on.
“Come on girl, I have seen you look at him whenever he speaks!” Linda shrieked with excitement.
Bruce joined them after a while. “I figured out what the formula is. That pink liquid isn’t a drink. It’s to be placed in some sort of a machine and it’ll then turn to gas. After that, little Tony will be transported back to his time period and we’ll get our Tony back.”
“I hope you didn’t mind,” Kayla said. “I felt like, you needed a hug.”
“Alright kids, lunch will be ready soon. Ana’s cooking is the best and I’m sure you all will enjoy yourselves here. Jarvis will take good care of you all,” Maria said once she let go of Natasha.
Doctor Strange nodded at Sue and Wanda. They both conjured their strongest shields, followed by the Doctor himself. Wanda was already falling onto the road and so was Sue. But their sheer determination kept their shields up.
“Steve, learn how to multitask! It’s bad but it’s good!!” Tony threw his hands in the air and said.
Tony activated his Communicard again. “Where are you all?”
Happy reading!!
“Go and talk to her, Bruce.” Tony was watching both of them. “Don’t lose her.” He looked up the bright blue sky. It was very difficult for Tony to digest the fact that Pepper left him. But he decided to get over with it, even though it was difficult to, and just be professional about it. So they were still talking, but as friends. He didn’t want to blame anyone, although his deep conscience was pointing fingers at one person.
“Consider him mission control for this,” Tony said, bitterly as he landed.
But after about 20 minutes, Tony still hadn’t come back to bed. So, Steve went up to check if Tony was alright. However, the bathroom lights were switched off, with the door slightly ajar. Steve’s heart was thumping against his rib cage. Perhaps Tony went to the lab or the mini gym and fell asleep there?
He wasn’t aware of the elevator doors sliding open, and Clint and Thor staring at Tony with eyes as wide as saucers.
“What?” he asked.
He tried grabbing the crepe away from her. Bruce moved away; he didn’t want to argue with them anymore. Thor joined Clint. He tried to pry the crepe away from Natasha’s hand. Clint managed to pin down her hands and Thor was tearing the crepe away from her. They were laughing loudly, completely forgetting they were in another person’s house.
“You did sound genuine,” Steve commented. “I felt your passion.”
“My ass?” Tony replied. “Yeah… still sore, Steve. I still feel you ramming into me.”
Steve let out a small gasp. But he recovered. “I love you too, Tony.”
“Coffee runs my soul!” Tony made his point dramatically, raising his arms.
The only difference was that this little boy was now wielding Thor’s mighty hammer and none of them actually have the chance to escape that.
Tony chuckled. “I have two more puzzles left.”
Hey everyone! Thank you so much for your support for this story! Sorry it took me this long to post this. I hope you enjoy this next chapter!!
“I got you,” he said, still half asleep. He rolled out of bed and landed on the floor. He scrambled back up to get Tony a cup of water, still in his disoriented state.
Tony nodded his head. He started the engines. After a slow rumble, the engines came to life. The jet slowly lifted off. Within a few seconds, they were on their way to the States.
When he could finally see the blue skies, he realized he was thrown across the skies and was plunging towards the bridge, towards the road on the bridge to be more exact.
“I’ll take some later,” Howard said. After rinsing his glass, he wiped it with the cloth that was on the kitchen counter. He was still holding onto the glass when he was walking towards the exit. “Oh and Tony?”
“Hop on, Clint,” Reed said. He stretched out his arm all the way up 6 floors, to where Clint was perched on. Clint settled down on the palm.
There will be a part 3, which I'll upload pretty soon. I'll try to keep my chapter updates regular, because I'm busy with my internship now :")
Tony couldn’t help but laugh at that. He got out of the car, taking his wallet out. “I’ll take one home.”
“You guys are assholes,” Clint huffed.
"Exactly!" Ben said before running to where the Hulk was.
“Makes sense,” Scott said.
“Hey, I’m right here, and I dealt with it just fine,” Tony sat up and raised an eyebrow. “Anyway, he could have but I did distract him with a potential invention of mine. But really, Nat, you couldn’t find a thing?”
“But I have one question, though,” Scott said. “Why did the Frost Giants attack at a very odd timing? Like, night. Why?”
“Yes, solar panels but it’s my idea to modify the solar cells, so that their efficiency is increased, to minimize heat wastage,” Tony briefly explained while pulling out his blueprint.
“Tony, remember to bring me home okay?” Peter asked innocently. “And uh, hi.”
Sam was contented. In fact, he was glad he had this friendship.
They waited in silence as the elevator ascended towards the penthouse. Steve’s hand was on Tony’s shoulder, squeezing it every once in a while, to assure him that everything was fine. Soon, the elevator door opened. Steve pushed the wheelchair out. They could hear several voices speaking at once as they neared the penthouse.
Thor frowned at that statement.
“Tony…” Bruce said softly. “What…”
“Yeah but… I don’t want to feel that way, Tony. I’ve been trying to change myself.” Clint leaned against the wall and shrugged.
“Whatever you are going through, boy,” the seller called out after him. “It will be okay. Don’t overthink it. Just smile!”
“Master Stark,” Jarvis dashed to Tony’s side. “Oh no, not again.”
“I swear on your mother’s life, I will destroy you and your friends today,” the leader growled.
“Oh boy,” Tony whispered as he flew upwards and instead of towards the bank. “Cap, I can’t come in. You gotta trust me on this one.”
Steve Rogers slammed open the stairway door. When he saw what was going on inside, his jaws dropped.
She sat beside him. Steve could feel her eyes on him, but he didn’t want to look at her. All he wanted to do was curl up into a ball and never see anyone again.
“Pleasure was ours, Defenders.” Natasha smiled. She walked them to the elevator.
“Clint and I can handle the Helicarrier,” Tony said.
“Hi, I’m Kayla and this is Linda. We live here.” Kayla introduced herself, her voice as soft yet firm as ever.
Tony entered the room, immediately being assaulted by eye contacts from his teammates.
I hope you're having a good weekend! Here's the next update and I hope you enjoy this. Thank you so much for your support so far!
Steve smiled. “Sure, just tell me what it is.”
Kayla now had enough strength to get up. She crawled, in pain, and picked up little Natasha, who was crying as she had hit her head lightly on the dining table when she fell. She then moved towards Clint and Tony. She pulled them closer to her. She was holding onto all the 3 babies. The Doctor saw that Tony was in better hands, so he got up, already feeling frustrated because of the Frost Giant’s actions.
Tony gave her a thumbs up and started his engine. Bruce put on his seatbelt, as he was right beside the driver’s seat, while Clint was chilling at the back.
“No.” Banner replied. “He couldn’t give an exact time. When he sent me to the Bifrost, Asgard was under massive attack from the Frost Giants. They were looking for this stone.” He pointed at it.
“No I don’t,” Steve stood up. He ended up doubling over as another vomit rocked its way out of him.
“Friday come on!” Tony shouted as he felt himself being tossed around the wreckage. The orange glow around him became black all of a sudden, and he had zero visibility.
“I’m sure we will,” Steve nodded his head.
“Tony, do you have any idea how heavy my jeans can get once it’s wet?” Steve asked, looking at Tony with eyes that begged him to understand where he was coming from.
“Oh yes we were,” Sam smiled cheekily.
“Drive safely,” Linda smiled.
Tony turned back at Steve looking at him. He smiled at Steve, still wincing in pain. He surely must be looking like he was having a constipation but was forced to smile in the midst of it. Sometimes for a genius, he could be pretty fucking stupid.
“Mother of God,” Clint whispered.
He didn’t stay behind to see Steve getting the cure from Bruce. He ran to the eatery he barged into earlier. It was so quiet inside, an almost apocalyptic scene as there were plates of food and glasses of drinks abandoned on the tables. He hid under a table as he waited for his suit to arrive and for the cure to work.
Little Tony slowly looked up, eyes red with tears threatening to fall. “I’m… I’m… sorry, Cap,” he whispered.
“Uh...” Tony was about to say something but Rhodey stopped him.
Bruce felt his heart warm at that. He also loved Tony’s answer because deep down, he knew that was what adult Tony would have said.
“Okay, I’m not leaving you here alone with that,” Tony pointed at the soldiers now lined up. “Their guns look like they’re holding liquid, not lead.”
Tony and Rhodey were seated on the couch where Rhodey was sharing with his best friend about the condition of his legs. Sam was seated beside Rhodey, listening to him. Steve was standing behind the couch with Scott, chatting with him.
Tony’s eyes widened as he almost choked on his food, but he went along with the hug. A hug from Thor was always a comfort.
Tony ran with Mjolnir raised high up, and the Hulk too, ran towards the man.
Before Tony could answer, Steve pulled him to their bed and tossed him onto it. Tony couldn’t even register the impact because of how aroused he was. Steve was on top, still stroking his boyfriend’s hard cock, wanting to see him come.
Steve was running down the road. He looked up and saw a figure running on the roof, jumping onto the next building. Steve saw Thor starting to get airborne and knew it wouldn’t be long till they captured Nightshade.
Pepper was more than happy when she saw Tony in the office again with Steve. She would be spending the rest of time teasing them about how hers and Natasha’s plan worked like a charm. Tony would let her have that satisfaction anyway.
“Don’t mention it, Ms. Romanoff. Just stay low and take care of them,” T’Challa said. “Especially Bucky.”
“Come on Rogers!” Tony panted.
Outside the room, Natasha was wiping away her tears of laughter.
Tony sighed. Part of him wanted to and part of him didn’t want to, because what if Obadiah was really doing something illegal?
The Avengers Quinjet breezed by the Helicarrier, before landing in the parking lot. Tony sprinted to it as fast as he could.
Tony pouted while resting his chin on Steve’s shoulder. It was such a cool technology, a robot that could fly! But dad didn’t build it so that was not a Stark tech. Tony turned away, curling his arms around Steve’s sweaty and warm neck.
He carried Tony. While passing by Kayla, Tony giggled at her. Steve’s face was hot. The adult Tony would have made a million jokes about the incident. She shut the door once they left.
“I’ll join you in a while, Tony,” Steve smiled. He gave Tony’s forehead a soft kiss, before allowing him to peel away from him.
Clint froze. He then turned away and walked to where Natasha was.
“Tony? Just wait for us, dear,” Steve said as he caught his shield.
guy was. “Sure ma’am. I’ll try to find him and give him uh… a firm lecture.” He turned to look at Peter, giving him the are-you-serious look.
“I agree with Dan,” Matthew spoke up. “We’ll meet again later I guess.”
“Because…” Tony willed his tears not to rise. “Because Steve deserves someone better, Clint. He’s a good guy. He needs someone who is not a major fuck up, someone who can be there for him and someone who is… I guess on the same level as Steve.”
Tony frowned. “Why are you apologizing again?”
“Shorter labels next time then,” Tony chuckled to himself. He opened the box he had taken and found some items from his past. There was even a small photograph that looked pretty much washed-out. He managed to see Steve’s face, that looked like he was grinning. He smiled, and placed the photo in the box. He took out two dolls that were caked in dust. One was a Captain America doll. But Tony couldn’t really recognize the other one, that looked like a teddy bear.
It might have sounded like a question or it might not have been one. F.R.I.D.A.Y cleverly didn’t make it clear. Steve felt his cheeks getting hot while Bucky kept staring at the ceiling.
As the dust cleared, Steve saw that there was no movement at all. No army came out of the portal and the heroes were either sitting or lying down on the road. Hulk and Luke Cage were pretty much the only ones still standing. Plus it was eerily quiet.
Steve really liked the basement. His face lit up when he saw all the fitness equipment available. He could come here whenever he felt stressed. But he also took into consideration that the lab was right opposite the mini gym.
Happy reading!
“Sure, we’ll keep in touch.” Bruce and Reed exchanged a handshake first, followed by Bruce and Strange. “I’ll walk with you, come on.”
He immediately proceeded to open his face plate up and threw up all over Strucker’s face.
“Can’t we overtake them, friend Natasha?!” Thor screamed in excitement.
Sam sat down on the floor instead, in front of the three kids. “So, how are you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve sighed. He knew Tony wasn’t going to like what he was going to say next. “Tony, I um, keep the shield. I’m probably mission control on this one.”
Thank you so much to all of you who have been reading the stories in this AU and part 3! It's gonna be worth it!
“Oh come on man!” Natasha sighed. “Bruce and I are fucking bored watching the both of you dance to Bollywood stuff to Gangnam Style again and again!”
“We need to go,” Thor smiled at them. “Doctor Strange, it’s up to you.”
The Hulk roared as he blasted into the bank, ripping the cybernauts apart.
“And what?” he asked. He cleared his throat and continued. “And destroy our world?”
“Oh hi.” A more soft but firm voice came. “Do come in, Avengers.”
“Oh no, that’s okay. I’ve got this,” Tony assured Professor Williams before turning to Whitney. “I’m not sucking up. Also, you do that way better than me.”
There was a slight turbulence, which made Thor jolt awake. He looked very disoriented and was staring at Steve like he was a stranger. But after everything clicked into place, Thor grinned at Steve.
Tony on the other hand looked very down. Whatever excitement he had was long gone. “I don’t want to leave you, Cap.”
Bruce smiled at her and gave her shoulder a pat. “That’s really sweet. I mean… yeah, that’s nice to hear. I’m so glad Barton decided to help you instead of bully you. That’s something.”
“We had the same question for you too,” Jarvis replied. He was cleaning the stove. “You simply vanished from the kitchen, and Master Rogers, your beloved, was really worried.”
“Better not to,” Bruce looked away.
Heimdall activated the Bifrost and Bruce was transported to this suburb within seconds. He was still holding on to the stone when he landed.
Their last round came and both of them were eager to play to their maximum capabilities. After the three second countdown, both of them swung their arms. Clint’s remote control flew out of his hand and crashed onto the wall, while Thor managed to strike, making him the overall winner of the game.
Bruce rolled his eyes, while Natasha and Clint ran to their rooms to get some stuff.
“Kayla and Linda!” Steve waved at them. They waved back at him.
Professor Yinsen didn’t comment on the date being a guy.
“Honestly? I think I’ll do this bit by myself,” Tony said, finishing up his first taco. He reached out across the bench and took his second taco. “I don’t want to put you guys in any trouble.”
Happy reading!
Jarvis ruffled his hair and gave him a knowing smile.
He walked and sat beside Tony. He held Tony’s right hand. “We can start over.” He went even more closer and placed his forehead on Tony’s. They both closed their eyes, feeling each other’s warmth.
“Let me just stop you here,” Tony said, interrupting his dad. “You came all the way here to ruin my fun and talk to me about
The clothes looked like it was on top of something. And that
The attic door was wide open. And sprawled on the floor, were Tony, Wanda and Chippy. Steve heaved a huge sigh of relief. He walked in and sat down in front of them. He saw that Tony and Wanda were quietly doing a puzzle together. They were doing this while lying down beside one another. There were tools scattered around them too. But that looked like it was long abandoned.
Tony and Steve enter a whole new Universe together.
“You might not get it, Tony,” Steve started. He was not giving any of them eye contact. “I… It’s just that, the decisions I made in Siberia… it’s not something Captain America would have made. I don’t think I’m right for this anymore. I chose to bring Bucky away and go into hiding, as Steve Rogers. I dropped the shield and walked away. I… I think I will help out via comms.”
The team wants a bit of a relaxed night before they go back to New York but looks like the Frost Giants are going to ruin it.
“2, actually,” Tony grinned.
“Yeah.” Steve nodded. “Things happened. But it’s over and better now. I hope.” He made his way to the door.
“I will.” Jarvis replied firmly.
Clint was more of a play-alone child. But he welcomed anyone who wanted to join him. This cool morning, Tony had joined him. They were busy painting out clouds and skies on an empty piece of paper, kindly given by Kayla from her drawing block. Tony had a habit of standing back every minute, to take a look at their handiwork. If he was pleased, he would giggle. If he wasn’t, he amended the details himself. One detail Tony created was to add a smiley face to the sun they both painted out. Baby Clint loved it.
He landed in an alley, pushing down several trash cans and scaring a couple of cats and rats away. The people walking past them started to panic, running away in different directions. Wanda helped a young girl up, who had fallen down due to the chaos. She brushed off the little girl’s dress and made sure her knees were okay. Wanda also made sure the little girl was completely out of harm’s way.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Some things don’t change. Bastard.” He mumbled to himself.
“Look at you,” Tony laughed at Steve.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up this time, reaching a new height.
“I will miss them Sam,” Steve’s voice was shaky. “I really will.”
“We did it!” Linda squealed. In her excitement, she gave Steve a hug, more of a squeeze. Steve didn’t mind. He chuckled and hugged back, the tip of his ears turned red. “Oh my God!” Linda suddenly said.
What do you think is the state of 6-40?
“If you want the clothes pressed neatly, give them to me. Ana and I will do it,” Jarvis told them.
“We might,” Steve said.
“I think most of us haven’t,” Steve smiled. “Thanks Tony.”
Tony let out a breath.
He carried both the babies up. Linda saw that. Her laughter just vanished, like it got drained out of her face. Steve gave her the babies. He then collapsed onto the sofa, beside baby Bucky. Steve cupped his face using his hands. It was getting overwhelming for him. He sighed heavily. That was when Bucky’s little hands held him. Bucky was on his knees on the sofa, both his hands on Steve’s arms. Steve lowered his palms so that he can get a good view of Bucky. The little one now snuggled up near him.
Tony saw Butterfingers preparing another smoothie carefully. He grinned as the bots have finally mastered preparing a smoothie without creating a mess. Who was he kidding? The last time something spilled was only last night. But Tony was too fond of his bots to care about their mistakes.
The others nodded. They could already see the New York City lights from the cockpit windows. Tony had started to put the jet on descent mode and slowed it down. They were flying over the streets within seconds.
Steve felt that that was enough. He let out a growl before lunging onto Tony. He slammed him against the wall, and crashed his lips onto Tony’s. He rubbed his hard cock against Tony, and that earned a moan from him. Tony felt his eyes rolling, and his hips jerked up. Steve’s hands were all over him. Tony was trying to register all the sudden movements, but Steve’s hard kiss made it impossible to.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Jarbis?” Tony called out. “I love you Jarbis.”
“It reminds me of winter, which is associated with my parents’ death,” Steve sighed shakily. “My dad died when I was four. My ma worked and worked to keep us afloat. There was once, during winter, I was walking down the street to get my ma a newspaper. A few other boys threw cold water at me and mocked me when I screamed. From that day on, I hated the cold. I just…. I can’t… breathe….”
Realization hit Sam like a runaway train. “You are going to miss the kids.”
“You’ve got something for him?” she asked him. His answer did not satisfy her.
“How do the kids find the crepes?” a female voice came from behind Jarvis.
When he reached up there, he wasn’t expecting to see Jarvis walking around the gym area.
“Oh Tony,” Pepper looked at him with a soft look.
“Is everything alright?” Kayla asked from below. She looked like she was still half asleep.
After a sigh, Tony spoke. “So uh, you okay?”
“You know Tony,” Howard hissed, stepping into Tony’s personal space. “You are one of my biggest mistakes. I would bother to erase you if I only I had a fucking eraser. But life doesn’t work that way. I wish you would get my message across your thick skull because right now, you’re just being a prick. Tony, I am warning you about your future. And this is how lightly you’re taking it? All the best. You’re gonna be the biggest failure there is in this world.”
“You were adamant about keeping those two, Tony,” Steve chuckled when he saw Tony examining the two plushies.
“How do we go back without the boy?” another scientist asked. “We will die!”
“Wow. Pleased to meet you,” she stretched out her hand. Peter took this opportunity to press the elevator’s button. He was squeezing his Spiderman suit into his bag, to make sure it doesn't just pop out suddenly. “So, you’re from?”
“I read some reports on the Hulk and about the experiment,” Tony slowly started. “How did that much of gamma energy not kill you?”
Clint snorted. “Nah. He’s a good friend and it was just a game, I guess.”
Hi guys! Thank you for your support for this story so far! I was really busy and that's why the update was quite late, so for that, I'm really sorry.
After a long time did Tony turn back. He nodded at them then turned back.
So the six of them spent the next five minutes deciding what they wanted to eat. After telling the waiter their orders, they waited for their food to arrive. Two waiters came and poured red wine into all their glasses. Each of them took small sips.
“My men are going to purify you with a Hydra invention that will never make you lie ever again,” Strucker continued.
“What’s the prob?” Tony asked Clint.
Rhodey considered this. “Then you should get going. I have Vision. I can practice walking with him.”
“You know Steve, I really don’t see why you needed to fold up your jeans,” Clint was smirking. And a smirking Clint was
Speaking of mornings, where was this investor? Pepper had given him a name, a Mr. Grant. And it was 10.08am.
Tony sat back in awe. “Did you just make a joke?”
“And when will that be?”
“On the elevator with a man called… Happy,” Linda said, pointing at the hallway.
Tony smirked at her and went closer. Jane, for a moment, thought Tony was being serious.
“And who has the other half?” Natasha inquired.
Clint snorted. Steve rolled his eyes at that before running down to assist the others.
“Never mind,” Tony said. Just then, Reed’s face popped up on his computer screen.
He walked backwards, eyes still watching Clint walk away with sadness, and stepped on someone’s foot, hard.
“Why are there two? We can probably share one, if we put Clint on one of our laps,” Natasha chuckled.
“Let Thor go and we’ll talk this out,” Tony went straight to the point. His eyes were turning red in anger and he was glaring at both the Frost Giants.
Thor was alright. In fact he had opened his eyes just in time to witness Mjolnir flying towards Tony. He smiled weakly at that.
“It’s legit, Cap,” Coulson nodded his head.
Iron Man was doing one last reconnaissance in the air, ensuring no clowns dressed in an ugly yellow suit was prancing around the street. Once done, he landed beside Steve, who was checking on Clint’s elbow. Natasha was also checking on Clint, making sure he was fine.
Suddenly, the Hulk let out a grunt. He fell to his knees, still holding onto Tony. Thor attempted to grab Tony away, in case something was to happen to him. But he stopped because the Hulk was changing into Bruce and he was still cradling Tony.
“Friday, you’re right. I do throw tantrums,” Tony said, looking at the elevator buttons.
“Anyway, please check on Doctor Jane Foster here, she fell down today and scraped her knee!” Tony shrugged as he backed out of 6-40.
“Mark 8 inbound.”
He was top in his cohort? Was the end of the world here or something? Tony knew he was good, okay. But he didn’t know he was too good till he was his cohort’s topper. Well, what’s new? He’s too good in what he does anyway.
Steve straightened. “What is it?”
Steve sighed. He looked very unhinged. “Bruce,” he began. “This is Tony. I found him in the lab just a few moments ago.”
What should Steve do?
“Team 2, Daredevil, inform us if you hear anything out of the ordinary. Luke and Jessica, keep pushing them back. Clint, use your explosive arrows. Try your electro-arrows at the portal too! Doctor Strange, try to push them back and create shields if needed. Vision, try and melt them. To push them back, increase your density. Black Panther, your highness, I need you to work with Daredevil to take out any Frost Giant who crosses that Vietnamese restaurant.” Cap quickly called out.
And suddenly, Tony pointed at the sky and said, “Woah, look at that.”
“Tony,” Steve called. His eyes widened in panic. “Tony look at me. Open your eyes!!”
“Hey Jarbis, before I go to Cap’s room, I’ll go to the kitchen. I need water!” Tony said. Jarvis continued to guide little Tony, now to the communal level kitchen.
“What the fuck happened while we were out?” Clint asked.
Behind her, the Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange were ready to leave too.
It was 6pm and the song Mr. Blue Sky was being blasted in the room Steve and Tony shared.
Her suit took most of the impact, even though she was bleeding slightly because of that ice attack. But giving up was never in her mindset. So she used the skills she knew.
“I agree,” Thor said. His grip on Mjolnir tightened.
“Do we have a plan?” Steve questioned.
“We’ll light it up once Linda comes down.” Steve placed Bruce down with the others.
Once Steve left the communal level, Natasha took her phone from her jeans pocket as it buzzed. She read the message, which had come from Phil Coulson.
Steve pretended to look like he was thinking. And then, he turned to the others. “You know what’s the biggest joke?”
Clint shuddered. He knew what Jarvis was going to do because he had experienced that last semester, thanks to Ross.
In this story, Clint is not married. He is single and loves food and coffee, like in the comics and cartoon.
“You mean you didn’t get it?” Tony was laughing hard. The others were laughing too.
“I can get the armor going,” Thor grinned as he chased after Tony.
"Even worse," Reed started. "What if he got de-aged and is buried underneath!?"
“What was I looking at?” Natasha thought aloud. “They have weapons, two portals opened near buildings. It’s like they want a war with us.”
“Yes indeed,” Sam whispered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where am I?” a boy’s voice was heard. The boy was crying. “Baba! I’m scared! Baba!!”
“Sorry, the summer is just so warm,” Tony laughed when he saw Steve’s face.
Doctor Strange adjusted baby Tony on his lap. He checked his injury. Tony’s right cheek was bright red, but it was getting better. He had stopped crying  and was toying with the Cloak of Levitation. The Cloak was willingly playing with him, which made Tony squeal with joy. Clint was standing right beside Tony, looking out for him. He was pouting the entire time.
Steve knew who Sam was talking about within seconds even though the topic change was too fast. “No. With the accords and the fight, I didn’t have the chance. I mean I had opportunities before, but I kinda let them pass. I’m planning to tell him after this whole ordeal is over.”
Steve dropped the shovel and ran past Linda. He knew who it was. And he was more than glad that he could make it to Boston on such short notice.
Let me know your thoughts in the comments! Thank you! :)
“Steve,” Linda’s voice came out. “There is some man here. He said you called him?”
I have time and I'm so glad I can update this story today!
“Yeah,” Steve said softly, walking slowly towards Tony. Both of their cocks were getting harder.
“You know,” Tony turned back to face Steve, who was pushing the wheelchair out. “I really want to know what Parker has for me. He’s this brilliant kid!”
“Good work, jolly green!” Ben smiled. He raised his fist to the Hulk.
“Course is all set, boss.” The AI answered.
He placed back all the stuff inside and box and lifted it, deciding to keep them. Clint helped lift another box that was all sealed up. They both walked to Steve’s room together.
“It was bad. What happened at the airport and at Siberia.” Tony’s eyes were filled with tears. They were threatening to fall if he made any swift eye movement. “Rhodey is paralyzed. And you lost your arm because of me. He left his shield. I was all alone, in the cold shelter, with just thoughts of realizing my parents’ died because someone killed them and I destroyed the relationship I treasured the most…”
“Let-tim go!” a little voice shouted at the Frost Giant. It was baby Clint. He was scowling at the big figure, strangling the super soldier. He gave the Frost Giant’s right shin a kick. “You don hurr our Steeb!”
In the evening, after 6, Clint and Thor were engaged in a fierce battle, which was a Wii dance game. They took turns dancing for over an hour, trying to make one another lose.
to be strong.”
Both Clint and Natasha looked at each other. They nodded at each other, realizing how smart Tony really was.
“F.R.I.D.A.Y,” Rhodey sighed. “If he calls back again just don’t notify, please.”
“Friend Tony, say aaaaaa,” Thor said.
Steve looked at him. Perhaps he saw the tears so he was concerned. “I’m alright Tony. You?”
“Soon,” Tony sighed. “I’ll see you later.”
“I’m chasing Nightshade! I- ouch!” Sam cried out. “She shot at me! I uh, backup, anyone?”
“Of course.” Natasha exited the kitchen. Wanda and Tony exchanged a smirk.
“Bruce,” Steve called after feeding Tony. “Bruce wake up.”
“Belt, Clint,” Tony narrowed his eyes. Clint sighed and buckled it.
Sam loves playing with the kids and Steve might not really be anticipating Thor's arrival.
“This is the weirdest landing I ever had,” he observed. Reed was smiling at him.
Tony didn’t expect that. He was just talking in a non-aggressive manner, and was actually about to open the door and walk out of that stupid office. But before he could even turn the handle, a clenched fist came flying out of nowhere, and hit him hard, on his nose. Tony vaguely registered his dad giving his leg a kick. Everything else was swirling in the room. Tears started to blur his vision, and he felt liquid running down his nose. He immediately cupped his hand over his nose, and tried to protect his head in case his father was going to strike it with another blow.
“So much for being weak,” Clint muttered.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “You know, I’m not gonna judge because point number one, you’re my friend and number two, nearly everyone takes things seriously and likes to win.”
“Don’t be down,” Bruce offered. “I’m sure you’re going to be okay.”
Jarvis broke the hug. He quickly wiped his tears. “No, no. She is at home. She is preparing your favorite cappuccino coffee cake.” Jarvis smiled.
And Tony went ‘eeee’.
After one last look, the five of them exited his office. Thor slammed shut the door on his way out.
Will Steve change his mind?
(See the end of the chapter for
“You know if you have something to say…” Tony started. He was giving his temples a massage. “You can just spill it.”
He looked up at the ceiling, contemplating on what he should do tomorrow. Perhaps after securing that investor, he should go back to the Tower and have a chat with Steve. Yeah, that sounded like a plan.
“All in all, it doesn’t sound like me,” Tony summed it up.
The sun rays shone through the window. It hit Steve’s face. He stirred at the sudden brightness. He also felt like people were staring at him. So he opened his eyes slowly. He realized he couldn’t adjust himself because he was surrounded by babies. He froze in position when he saw an Asgardian armor nearer to him and two slimmer figures standing.
“Pack your stuff man, you’re gonna enjoy Boston.” Rhodey grinned.
“We should get milkshakes!” Steve suggested.
Tony internally cringed. So now, Steve knew about what kind of a big Cap fan he was. Even Coulson would be surprised.
After a solid two seconds of silence, both Clint and Thor answered in unison, “Bowling!!”
“For?” Steve asked.
Bucky slowly walked away from them. He sat on the couch, right beside Sam.
“Yes,” Steve blushed a little. “A little old-fashioned but… let’s go come on!!”
“The stone,” Steve started. He was standing now while carrying Bucky. Bucky’s little arms were draped around his neck. “Didn’t go so well.” Kayla didn’t understand. Not until Linda came down with Bruce and Wanda on each arm.
“Ms. Romanoff, is that your child?” a man asked.
“A board meeting in twenty minutes, security briefing and press releases about the Hydra incident,” Jarvis listed.
“What’s up, Tony?” Steve looked serious.
“Master Rogers, I need you to promise me one thing,” Jarvis said. He took in a deep breath before continuing. “I need you to promise me that you will never hurt Tony the way Whitney Frost did. That you’ll always be there for him and will never let him go despite how difficult it can get to handle him.”
“Right,” Obadiah turned his attention back to the blueprint. He cleared his throat. “You cooked this up in 4 hours?”
And this time, he reached out for Mjolnir and grabbed it. A streak of lightning hit the hammer, powering it up.
Steve started to look at the control systems. All the buttons and switches looked very intricate. He touched one of the buttons. “It looks very complex.” Steve said softly. He actually said it to himself but it was loud enough for Tony to hear.
“How do you spell i-cup,” Thor was grinning.
Natasha turned to Tony. She too did not know about the location yet. Tony felt the stare. He cleared his throat. “East Somerville, Boston.”
“No I’m not,” Bruce grumbled while getting a towel from the rack. He strolled back to the edge of the pool and sat beside Steve.
“I’ll see you soon. And also Mr. Stark,” Peter said. Steve nodded his head at him.
“The leader of the Frost Giants,” Bruce said. He was looking at the stone.
“C… come on.” Thor gritted his teeth. Hulk then gave Thor’s stomach a punch using his free hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony takes the stage for his presentation and attempts to dazzle everyone.
“I’ll see you tonight for practice, Natasha,” Fisk smiled at her. He gave her shoulder a pat.
He walked to Tony’s cot. Tony’s back was facing up. Steve couldn’t help but smile at that. There were the Iron Man and Captain America plushies, which Bruce ordered online, tucked under his arm. Initially the Captain America plush was bought for Bucky. But Tony was so adamant that he wanted both of them. So he got both. Bucky got a baby bear doll instead, which he fell in love with, first sight. Wanda was sleeping beside him. She was drooling onto her pillow. Steve gently wiped the drool. Once he lifted his hand off, she turned. Bruce was at the end. He was hugging his bolster. He let out a soft whimper, which Steve heard. He patted Bruce on the head until he was sure that he was alright.
“Nah,” Tony said.
“I handled it like an idiot,” he said, feeling his voice fade away. He cleared his throat. “I should have asked him professionally. Instead I jumped in and chased him away.”
There was a couple of seconds of silence as Tony prepared his answer.
Tony slowly turned to look at her. “You felt it, didn’t you?”
for the amusement park,” Jarvis looked at them coolly. He started to laugh when he saw all of them run towards him; especially Clint waddling right after jumping up from the pool.
“It’s a reminder.” Bruce switched off the alarm. He placed his phone away and cupped his hands on his face.
“Great, can’t wait to read it, Joseph,” Tony sounded excited.
“Uh Tony?” Steve asked in a voice that was barely above a whisper. “Could you… do something about the wind? Like, d…drive slower or something.
“Tony wait!” Scott said. “I’m already halfway through.”
He stayed awake for the next few minutes, looking out for Tony and for signs of him waking up.
Once he reached his elevator, he sighed.
How will Clint and Natasha handle the break?
“Nat?” Tony called out softly. “Can you tell Thor I said thanks? I never really had any soft toys. I really love the bears.”
Tony pulled his phone out of his pocket when he felt a presence beside him.
Tony gave him the thumbs up.
Bucky saw this. In a rush, he picked up Thor’s hammer, ran to the edge of the roof and tossed it to him. Thor saw this. He had no time to react. Hence he grabbed the hammer and called for lighting. Upon landing, Thor didn’t think twice about frying the Frost Giant.
Tony rolled his eyes. He also knew the others were watching him and listening to the conversation. So he did the one thing he liked doing. Especially to this man. “Please hold.”
Bruce had just walked over to Nick Fury. This mission didn’t need the Hulk; Bruce was required to examine the device and write a full analysis report on his findings. Hence jolly green didn’t come out for battle today.
“I’m here because you’re a walking fashion disaster!” Janet glared at Tony light-heartedly. “Your shirt is in and out and you’re wearing it on the wrong side!”
“Fantastic,” Clint commented.
He threw up into the vomit filled sick bag again.
“He’s wrong,” Steve said firmly. “You’re one of the best people I’ve ever been with. You’re also a genius, Tony. You’ve made some pretty good inventions.”
“She already left the house for some meeting,” Ana replied.
“We didn’t really know about you and cold, plus, we forgot this thing called boundary,” Clint said. “Sorry buddy.”
“What is the update, Iron Man?” Steve immediately went to point.
“Yeah, that jerk is so into science, it’s almost as if he’s cheating on me with science!” Jan declared, much to the amusement of Tony.
Tony ran to the entrance, his breakfast and an extra dose of coffee giving him full energy. The others jogged behind him, and their jaws dropped once they reached the entrance.
“How about a cup of coffee from the Science café?” Tony asked her with a cheeky smile.
**Do take note there'll be a bit of a nightmare sequence and Tony's PTSD here.**
Steve felt a pang of sadness hit him. There were a lot of things adult Tony haven’t told him. Like, how close he was to his butler and to what extent Howard had abused him, in any form. He’s now learning them, bit by bit, and he wished he could talk to adult Tony about it.
All the heroes gasped. Bruce was beginning to turn green. The others were already taking out their weapons and were getting ready to attack.
“Howard,” Maria glared at him. “Just stop it. Cut the bullshit! Stop abusing my son!”
“What do you mean?” Sam asked him.
Happy Reading!! :)
“Of course not!” Steve said. “I mean, I gotta bring him out once we get back to Boston. I gotta research on the places I can bring him there.”
“Bucky,” he started. “If you don’t say sorry, I will not bring you to the night walk.”
The armor closed up and stood on guard.
“We’re doing it Steve!” Linda sighed. “Ok, now to the hole.”
Both Clint and Thor had stopped eating. In fact, they were rooted to their seats as they watched Tony get real.
This means there will be a younger Tony and Cap interaction!
“Oh Cap,” Spidey turned to him after a few seconds. “I’m uh, okay. How about you?”
What do you think Christine is going to write about?
Excitement was like a bright light that was lit on all of their faces. Some ran into the house to get their clothes, while Natasha and Clint stayed behind to wipe themselves first.
Everyone turned to look at him, not expecting Bruce to speak with a strong language. Bruce gave them all a light smile and shrugged.
“We’re already nearing, master Stark,” Jarvis said.
After a few seconds, Peter asked in a quiet voice, “Tony, will you bring me back home to Uncle Ben and Aunt May?”
“And soon, you’ll get here,” Steve said. He leaned forward and pressed a soft kiss on Tony’s forehead.
“Can’t wait to eat,” Steve stretched.
“I mean, I have an idea to make a circuit board, hoping it can impress him. It’s so difficult to impress my dad,” little Tony sighed shakily. Tears fell out of his eyes.
“Wow the quinjet is big,” Scott Lang was marveling at it. Wanda smiled at that.
---END---
It was Natasha, seated by his bedside and brushing back his hair.
Then Asgard had an attack from the Frost Giants, which Thor described as ‘ruthless’. The Frost Giants were there for the special stones, which could de-age any living being without affecting the time. So anyone could turn from 20 to 10 and still live in the present time. The special stones were split into two. They should not have cracks as the crack was the one that de-aged anyone who touched it. So the stones were supposed to be smooth. The Frost Giants had obtained one half of it. They were looking for the other half. The combination of both stones will make the owner powerful .
Steve smiled an innocent smile and Tony hugged him. Steve rested his head on his boyfriend’s shoulder and sighed contentedly. Tony gave Steve’s forehead a kiss and helped him up. After settling down, they drove back to the mansion in peace.
“I’m not a spineless prick!” Tony shouted back. “Crediting a person’s idea or work is part of good ethics, which you don’t have! I saw you and Obi grinning like fools for the stupid camera!”
“The food, you bozo,” Steve said, unusually calm. But his cheeks felt hot and he adjusted himself on the seat.
What does Tony have for both Steve and Bucky?
“Okay they’re here!” Clint grinned at Steve who was pushing Tony’s wheelchair in. “F.R.I.D.A.Y, roll the movie!”
“Boston is fantastic!” Wanda replied with so much of enthusiasm, it amused Linda. “Your neighborhood is very quiet. It’s peaceful and I love it.”
“Spidey!” Luke shouted in panic.
“I’m okay,” he replied. He smiled at Steve.
“Last thing I remember was my Spidey senses tingling,” Peter replied.
“I knew a battle was going on. Steve and I could hear it!” Tony grinned. He and his boyfriend strolled in casually.
“Noooo,” Tony cried out. “We tried but… but well, she was not into that idea. So we both were just lying down naked. Nope, we didn’t.”
“Alright you two, are you ready?” Steve asked with excitement oozing out of him.
“Why?” Bruce asked.
“ETA 5 minutes, sir,” Jarvis informed him.
He came out, and shut the door. He pushed his friends down the steakhouse’s red carpet, as they were standing there not knowing what to do. He gave his best fake smile to the cameras and walked in. There were many of them shouting Tony’s name, asking him if he was in a relationship, about his dad’s company about him nearly crashing his car at a convenience store a while back. Tony sighed internally and walked down the red carpet with his friends.
A normal day in New York City was so underrated.
“Tony?” Maria Stark called. She entered the kitchen and went straight to her son. “Look, that man is locked in his office. Just let him be, okay?” she then turned to Steve. “I’m so sorry you had to go through that.” She apologized, and tears formed in her eyes.
“How’s the new house looking like?” Tony asked.
Bruce’s little fingers held the handle and without any effort, he lifted the hammer. He didn’t fall back or even stumble. He was swinging it around. Sam’s eyes widened. He motioned at Thor to look at the surprising scene unfolding in front of their eyes. Thor turned and gaped at what he saw.
“The doctor says he’s pretty much ready to go back home,” Clint said. “But they won’t release him till early afternoon, some safety thing was the reason they gave. And oh, he might have to use a wheelchair.”
Indeed, the leader and his right-hand Frost Giant were standing in the alley, planning to de-age or even wipe some of the heroes out of existence. What they didn’t know was that Ant Man had managed to get on the leader, and was halfway cutting the chain loose.
Hi guys! Here's the next chapter for this story. I promise the next few chapters will kick start the action!
“It’s closing,” Thor said.
Within minutes, both of them were standing side by side, looking at the water. Tony quickly texted Steve saying he went to the washroom, knowing full well if he mentioned about Howard’s presence, Steve will get real mad.
Tony sighed.
Fury quickly gave them an overview of the situation, and Tony simply rolled his eyes. Apparently, A.I.M had developed some secret weapon and were testing it out in the streets of New York, which also happened to be a few blocks away from Avengers Tower. It’s as if they had no test facilities at their stupid secret lair. It was a device that shot out pinkish-purple beams and the organization
In fact, that was the last thing Tony said before a wave of purple hit him. Scott had returned to his normal size but he was hit by the wave too. Both the armor and Scott came crashing down onto the middle of the road. The armor had quickly grabbed Scott, so he didn’t have much of an injury.
“You have news, doc?”
“F.R.I.D.A.Y take charge and blast that bastard,” he ordered. “Divert full power to the chest.”
“Wow,” Bucky whispered.
“Looks can be deceiving,” Bucky pointed out.
It looked like stalemate just a second ago. But one second was a long time. Because the next thing the heroes know, the armies of Frost Giants walked out of the portal.
At the communal level, Clint was sitting down with a bowl of Bruce’s special baked rice. He was eating while watching another round of Parks and Recs.
Steve didn’t bother knocking the office door. He slammed it open, startling Tony’s father, slightly. Howard looked up with a little glare.
“He always makes that joke,” Clint said softly to Thor, and both of them were laughing.
“Tony,” she said softly. She looked worried. “Did you let him know you’re here?”
“Where are we running to?” Linda panted.
Tony stared at Bruce blankly. Of course he was fine, or at least that’s what he always told anyone who asked him if he was ok. “I am. I think, I am really interested to look at where I’ll be sleeping.”
“I’m on it,” Sam assured him.
“Alcohol, Master Stark,” Jarvis replied, with a somber tone. “It does things to people and changes them, despite them thinking it’s a way out of their stress and sorrows.”
All of them picked up their bags and made their way out of the terminal, with Natasha pushing the trolley. There was excitement on Tony’s face. He was literally bouncing beside Steve. The others looked tired and were just walking in the direction Tony was walking.
Wesley was glaring at Clint. But Fisk pulled him away; both of them walked to their lecture theater.
Sam and Rhodey weren’t laughing. They were embarrassed and didn’t even want to make eye contact with anyone. They wanted the moment to end. Steve gave Sam’s back a pat with a straight face, before losing it again.
“Nat,” Tony started. They were walking up to their rooms. “Bruce will share the room with you.”
“Tony! Scott!” Steve shouted in panic. “F.R.I.D.A.Y, take control of his armor and fly them to the convenience store. Nat, take care here for just a second.”
Steve chuckled to himself.
Professor Williams motioned for Tony to take the stage. The rest of the students, except for Whitney, gave him a round of applause.
“I have eyes and senses, sweet pea,” Tony deadpanned.
Tony now walked briskly towards the leader, who looked slightly intimidated. Without hesitating, he grabbed the leader’s neck and strangled him. He easily lifted the leader up.
“Then you guys would have thrown a great party and a funeral, I wrote it down somewhere anyway,” Tony shrugged, about to walk out of the room.
“Gosh I’m starving. Have a breakfast set?” Clint asked.
Steve wiped his tears and looked around him. Everyone were bleeding and looked like a mess. All of them needed rest too. He sighed.
“Seriously, thank you for your help,” Fury said. “I’m sorry Strucker almost made a mess here.”
“No way!” Tony panted. His face was red from all the coughing. “We’re going with that Ass Kick movie they picked!” Steve snorted at that.
He went to the kitchen where Natasha was laughing about something with Steve.
Clint is thinking if he should reconnect with his brother Barney Barton. Also, he and Natasha make a heartbreaking decision.
“No… It is too risky. These beasts might attack Earth just for the stone. And I can’t let that happen.” Thor was about to drag Bruce out.
“Rhodey… I wanted to visit you.”
“Were the questions in the video random?”
“Sam, flamethrowers!” Tony called when the portal took too long to close.
“Alright doc,” Tony grinned. “I’ll leave this in your capable hands.”
Scott’s eyes widened at this. But Tony frowned.
“I uh… sorry for suddenly vanishing,” Tony said and smiled sheepishly.
“Ah fuck,” Tony swore, feeling the rise of his orgasm.
Tony ran out of the room, leaving Steve to stand there, dazed. Steve realized he was going to have a boner no matter what. He walked quickly to the little dressing table they had, and adjusted himself.
Jane laughed. She forgot all about her worries and sorrows and laughed out loud, much to the glee of Tony. “Are you gonna cheat on Steve with me?” she asked him sarcastically.
“This is exactly what is breaking us apart!” Natasha exploded. Clint and Tony flinched. “You being this emotional, like come on, Clint! Keep your shit together and maybe, just maybe, you’ll see what you’re destroying.”
A few seconds later, he reached the area with rows of grey colored lockers. The people he was looking for were chatting in front of one. Clint felt himself burn with rage when he saw Fisk and Wesley laughing over a joke.
He handed the puzzle over to Steve. Steve took it. It was an Avengers jigsaw puzzle which had over 40 pieces. The missing part was the piece with Iron Man’s arc reactor, near Tony’s heart. Steve might not know where the piece of puzzle went to, but he definitely knew where Tony’s heart was.
When Steve heard this, he knew Tony was going to do something stupid. “Tony… we are going to come up with a new plan to get Nightshade-”
Steve turned to look at his boyfriend with a soft smile. He was eating a corndog. And he didn’t know what to tell Tony, who was looking at the open ocean with a peaceful look on his face. Steve didn’t want to disturb Tony’s moment of peace with himself, which was a rare occurrence. So he decided not to say anything.
Steve hugged back. But he let out a huge sigh. He extended his arms to Scott, who was looking down. Scott smiled before snuggling closer to Captain America. “Both of you are safe with me.” He assured them. “Look kids, I hate to say this but we’re in the middle of a huge battle-“
“I’m gonna be late,” Clint told Tony, sounding lifeless. “Thanks for stopping me.”
“It’s a damn door, Obi, why don’t you open it with some noise?” Tony pretended to look slightly amused and annoyed. He took a kleenex from the box beside him and wiped the area.  “Anyway, I’m dropping an idea, Obi.” Tony managed it smoothly.
“Sounds good,” Steve said.
“Sam!” Steve nearly screamed in relief. He gave a surprised Sam Wilson a tight hug. “I’m so glad you came here.”
A weird looking tall man, wearing just short bottoms, with red eyes and weird patterns on the skin, was strangling Kayla’s neck with his right hand and strangling Wanda using his left. Wanda was held very high up, but she was right above the sofa. Kayla’s face was red and she was gasping for air. Baby Wanda was screaming, tears streaming down her face.
“It is,” Tony agreed. He was still staring at his calculations. Steve turned to look at him.
On the last room, both Thor and Bruce were already unpacking. Thor nearly let out a scream when he saw the size of the room. He ran around for a while and only stopped once he stubbed his pinky toe on the side of the bed. Bruce was shifting their clothes to the walk-in closet. He was still quite stupefied by his surroundings, as he has never had a walk-in closet, let alone a big grand mansion.
They all went down the hallway, with Vision and Wanda holding hands, wondering the same thing.
“TV channel!” Clint shouted.
When they turned to enter the house, Steve realized that the front door was open. It was very odd because the girls would never leave their front door wide open even during the day. He started to brisk walk, dragging Bucky slightly. Once he heard the babies crying, he ran up the porch step. Bucky tripped on the stair, but Steve carried Bucky with one hand. Once inside the house, Steve’s eyes widened at what was happening.
“Really? Name one instance I suck up to people?” she asked with a smug smile.
“Yeah,” Bruce nodded. “I need to brief the team about this before anyone touches and becomes young.”
Tony let out a laugh that sounded bitter. “Of course, you don’t really trust anyone. Not even mum!”
Bruce and Thor agreed with him. The five of them were standing there in a single file, glowering at Howard; all those glowers should have set Howard’s office on fire.
Clint swam away to where Steve was while Natasha moved to the side. Thor landed in, hard. A big chunk of water splashed onto Bruce, and some of them went into his glass of lemonade. Bruce stood up and glared at Thor.
“On it!” Clint ran from them, screaming at the top of his lungs to get the people moving.
“There is still more food being prepared for you all,” Ana announced excitedly.
“Hey,” Tony said.
“I’m driving, because I can follow the speed limits,” Natasha volunteered.
The summer breeze continued to brush past them. Tony had closed his eyes and had his head on Steve’s chest. And at this moment, a question from the past came creeping back up on Steve’s mind.
“Come in, we were expecting you,” Clint smiled as he patted the chair next to him. Case in point. A Clint that sounded this friendly meant Steve had some words to scold Tony with right before he had gotten here.
Natasha smiled at him. She knew that this Bruce was vulnerable and prone to blaming himself for every bad thing happening around the globe. She squeezed his arm. “You didn’t want it to land on the wrong hands. Maybe it was meant for you to bring it here.”
“Oh God,” Tony wiped his tears. “My girl, rewind… rewind to the part where they both screamed!”
“Why am I wearing a dress?” kid Tony raised an eyebrow. “Whose big t-shirt is this?”
Tony let go of Natasha. He wiped the tears. “Yeah, noticed. We are landing at the Avengers Tower.”
“Steve,” Tony adjusted himself. “I gotta go back down to sort out the reservation stuff. And also to pick out a good suit.”
“Hey, meet my awesome housemates. I told you about them over the phone!” Tony announced excitedly. “Jarvis, meet Steve Rogers, Thor Odinson, Bruce Banner, Clint Barton and Natasha Romanoff. Guys, meet my butler Jarvis.”
Tony felt adrenaline pumping around his body, because of the speed at which he was traveling at. He let out a shout and looked down. There was a car parked below and it was beginning to look like a toy car.
Jarvis smiled at Steve’s words. He gave Steve’s shoulder a firm squeeze, already knowing Tony was in good hands.
After a few seconds of silence, Tony slammed his foot on the break hard and stopped at the edge of the cliff, near the strawberry seller.
And time started to fly by.
“Ha, you are right! Worthy!” Thor said excitedly. Sam was laughing at this.
She was staring at his back for a long time. She was feeling utter sadness. It was as if she was breaking down, like how she did for Pietro’s death. It was pain. And the pain was growing in her chest, making it difficult for her to breathe. She let out a loud sob. When she realized what she just did, she covered her mouth.
Doctor Strange opened the portal back to Iceland for both of them. Thor and Iron Man flew right in.
“Uh… Jarbis?” Tony called out, fear creeping back onto him.
Tony laughed.
“Guys,” Clint said, looking at the men gathering.
“You’re nuts,” Steve sighed. He moved closer to Tony and gave his cheek a kiss. He grinned when he saw Tony blush.
The interior of the Limo was beautiful. Once Tony shut the door, the lights inside turned to a cooler shade of purple. The seats were made of leather, and they all could smell luxury in the air. The air conditioning was like heaven, compared to the warm weather outside. There was a champagne corner in the car, and the six of them helped themselves.
Baby Clint then took his paint work and toddled towards Tony.
call me Legolas, again,” Clint warned him.
“Thank you. I know it was awkward and difficult for you two to suddenly have me and the others to come over. But you two were great help and I hope we will meet again. Do come to New York,” Bruce smiled.
“Focus up, people,” Steve spoke. “Try to locate Nightshade, and her cybernauts.”
“Sure,” Tony smiled, before jogging away to join the others.
Hi everyone! Here's the next chapter update!
He put on his seatbelt and leaned back. Tony sighed contentedly. He turned to look at Steve, who was sleeping beside him. The sunlight was dancing gracefully on Steve’s face. Tony took some time to admire Steve’s blonde eyelashes, glowing under the light. His messy blonde hair did all sorts of funny things in the pit of Tony’s stomach. He also saw the little drool on the corner on Steve’s lips, which made Tony smile.
“Do call the Panther when needed.” T’Challa stepped back.
“I will kiss my fiance once we’re out of here,” the cashier gave Tony a thumbs-up sign.
“Sweet Christmas,” Luke said out loud.
“Tony…” Clint said. “You think he’s in danger?”
“Do you uh, do you have the photos and videos of us when we were de-aged?”
“You should watch out for that!” Thor said.
“Clint!” Tony replied while taking out his tank top he had fallen asleep on. “Gotta go, honey!”
Tony sighed. Bruce and Thor had already told him pretty much the same thing earlier, when he was on the way up to the communal level. Talk about awkward elevator conversations.
The sun was rising in Boston as Thor knocked on the door. After a while, the door opened.
“They need your help,” he said softly. Steve nodded his head.
“Alright, I’ll speak to Ana for a while and leave. I’ve got somewhere I need to be,” she smiled.
Tony sighed and sat back. He knew it was going to be a wild ride with his housemates at his place. Only the higher power knew what was installed for them.
And within a matter of seconds, they were on the highway.
Whatever romantic moment they had was long gone. Steve was now in his full on Captain America mode, analyzing the enemy forces. Tony silently obeyed and ran out of there.
And then, the Avengers Assemble alarm rang. At freaking 9am!!
Clint wanted to make a comment about what he saw. But he didn’t, because of how Tony’s face was. He was smiling a very genuine smile, and was also trying not to look like he was going to cry. Clint realized, that this Peter guy must have tugged at Tony’s heartstrings.
“What the…” Kayla thought out aloud.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony was lying down at the top of the stairs, probably the
He slowly got up and settled Tony onto his hip.
“They all look so good,” Ana squealed. She walked them to where the Limousine driver was waiting for them.
Steve sighed, before saying, “This boy is a son of one of our PR people. He was found in the street we were fighting in just now. No more comments.”
Steve was wiping the sweat dripping down his forehead when he realized something.
“Yeah yeah guys. Laugh at my misery,” Clint managed to get up in one piece. “The bed
“What you have a good joke then?” Bruce laughed.
“What is it Fury?” he asked.
“For?”
For now, happy reading!
“You two fuckers!” Clint shouted. He ran and slammed Wesley against the locker, rattling the entire row.
The Wii set was located at the same level, at the end of the hallway, right beside Thor’s and Bruce’s room. Clint and Natasha were using it first after Jarvis helped them set up. They were playing bowling and then had a dance match.
“Mjolnir smashed my door and took flight!” Thor exclaimed. “I have an eerie feeling. I am not so sure where Mjolnir landed.”
Tony stared at her for a brief moment. Then he turned back to the shrubs and trees. “I uh, I’d like to amend things.”
Back at the Tower, the Hulk had grabbed Thor. Mjolnir and Tony were already headed towards the broken window.
Both Tony and Steve stopped digging. They looked at each other and then at Wanda.
“I saw him!” Jan said. “We were in the elevator… What happened?”
“See you later!” Tony called out.
Tony was brisk-walking beside Janet, panting loudly . “No, I’m going after Clint because he’s pissed. And I don’t want him to do anything stupid.”
“Tony!” an enthusiastic female voice came from level two.
“Come on Steve!” Tony placed a hand on his shoulder. “Clint’s tough! He’ll recover.”
“Damn,” Tony whispered. “Whatever it was, should have been in the server. Obi’s transactions and stuff…”
“This is the drill, Master Rogers,” Jarvis sighed.
“Who escaped?” Bruce frowned, when everyone saw one of the scientists, in his tight yellow suit, pointing the device towards the Avengers.
Bucky was in the kitchen eating Chinese takeout with Linda and Kayla. Steve on the other hand, was worried as they had no strategy planned out. But he was more than glad the team was able to make it back. He sat back on the couch and was watching them bickering over TV channels and movies.
Thor squeezed Tony’s shoulder in a reassuring manner. “As long as you trust him, as long as you know Obi, and trust your gut, we will back you up.”
“Why do you need us in your lab, Tony?” Steve asked. He was looking at Tony’s side profile.
His eyes welled up slightly, because that was enough for Steve, for now.
And Tony went ‘aaaaa’.
“So you were guilty,” Kayla broke the silence.
Clint was looking at the front door, digesting the fact that the pair results have been manipulated by someone. He walked to the dining table with his coffee and sat down, trying to think about who it could have been.
He slowly got out of bed and went to the closet to get his clothes out.
Tony felt his heart crush at what he was hearing. He moved closer to Steve, to give him comfort but also gave him a bit of space to recover.
Everything is linked, in the end!
“I like you, have been for a long time. I never found the courage to tell you because I was afraid of what you might say.”
“He’s here?!” Tony asked, excitement pouring out of him.
It took Tony a total of 2 seconds to realize that he was staring right into Steve’s soul in the kitchen. Natasha had left a long time ago.
“That wasn’t light-hearted,” Steve whispered to himself.
“Alright. We’ll bring the kids up. Their clothes?” Steve asked as he stood up. He was carrying both Bucky and Tony. Wanda and Natasha stood up with Bruce and Clint respectively.
“In that case, don’t play the footage!” Sam quickly said.
“Then,” the Frost Giant started, “I want the stone.”
Jarvis turned sharply to look at Tony. “Master Stark, do I look like an asshole to you?” he spat.
“Drink some water, Steve,” Ana offered. Steve took a small sip, still shaky from the tight slap he had just received.
At this point, Scott sat back and was watching Tony and Peter interact. He was ready to get back to his normal size to console the boy; he had a daughter after all. But he was afraid his sudden appearance would scare the already shaken boy.
“Sam get back!” Tony ordered.
“Well, she texted me asking for the level. So I guess she is here.”
Before he could do anything, a wave of purple hit him. A very young boy, about 4 years old, was screaming now. He didn’t know how to control his flight, thus he ended up diving straight to the ground.
“Boss, I’m not allowed to share that information with you,” she replied with a hint of amusement in her tone.
Thank you so much for your support and feedback for this story! I really appreciate it!! I love you all so much!!
“I’m sorry, Boss. But you were too tired so I didn’t want to wake you up!” Friday quipped.
She nodded her head, before taking her handbag and coat. Tony saw her off as she took the elevator. After the doors closed, Tony heaved out a huge sigh.
“Pleasure is ours, Bruce,” Kayla smiled.
“You alright?” Sam asked Bucky, who looked tired. Bucky managed to nod his head. Sam smiled at that.
Steve turned to look at the others. Bruce, who was beside Steve, was hugging his blanket and still had his eyes closed. At the left side, Thor was also sleeping with his head hanging low. His right leg was stretched out all the way to the aisle. Natasha and Clint were cuddling each other and were looking out of the window.
The three men ran out of the portal and back to New York. Scott was running with Tony, to get his suit back on.
Before Tony could finish his sentence, Steve ran to him, shut his mouth and tackled him. They were both on the floor. At this time, Bucky came out of the bathroom.
Jane nodded her head, allowing tears to fall from her eyes. “The help… Can you… try to get the words back together? It’s gone, but… but you can… right? Plus, this is a special paper only the professors have and use for testimonials… you think you can… get it back?”
“Let’s see,” Tony muttered to himself. He then took a sip of milkshake.
Before walking out of the room, Sam gave Rhodey a fist bump. He patted Vision on the back, which made the android smile.
Steve felt relaxed. In fact he even dozed off after some time Kayla came up to check on them. He woke up to Tony’s and Wanda’s little voices calling him and a warm object getting into contact with his cheek. He woke up to find two proud kids showing him their hard work and a dog licking his cheek enthusiastically. Steve chuckled while getting up. He patted Chippy's head while taking the puzzle from Tony.
"I only can do so much, Jess." Luke was panting.
“That’s what you think I am, fuck face?” Clint spat. “Natasha should have been with me!”
“Okay kid, let’s find your parents,” Tony said.
“You’re welcome,” Tony sighed.
“It’s working!” Doctor Strange shouted. He created a strong shield around the rest of the heroes, who were behind him.
This is it for this week. More will be coming up in the following weeks!
, as Tony had so fondly put it.
Ben groaned before getting back up. “Why not?” he rolled his eyes before jogging to where the rest of them there were running to; to where Doctor Strange was preparing to conjure his shield.
A sudden memory rocked Tony from the inside out. He silently slipped out of the kitchen, managing to keep his tears at bay.
He breathed in and out, trying to calm himself down. Today was a Saturday. What was Obadiah doing inside Stark Industries’ West Branch building…? Tony knew that Obadiah and Howard had decided to work at home on the weekends, so that they could get rest. The only time they went back to the office on a weekend was when they had a press or PR problem.
“Heavy-hitters to the bank,” Steve said before getting back up. He took his shield out. “Alright, what’s your deal?”
Clint gave a thumbs up. He was already dozing off. Tony’s phone rang and he picked it up.
“You done?” Steve asked.
Tony gave Steve a shit-eating grin, and started to eat his rainbow cake.
“How did this happen?” Natasha sighed. She picked up baby Clint. He was hugging his big bird doll. He gave Natasha a little grin.
company?”
“Okay, you do this babe. And I'll watch,” Steve assured Tony once he regained his damn composure.
“I am the God of Thunder and Lightning. With this hammer of mine, I can command them,” Thor said. “I might not be able to read minds, Tony.”
Clint then took one of his arrows from his quiver and activated it. He placed it on the guy’s head and gave him a kick. The arrow electrocuted the AIM guy.
“I just… I just need to be away from the Tower and Steve, importantly.”
A week later, Tony decided to clean his room. He also took that opportunity to move some of his stuff to Steve’s room permanently, so that he wouldn’t have to run up and down when looking for his stuff.
Tony raised an eyebrow. This was potentially a disciplinary issue work, that was if he chose to do it the other way. “Uh… I’ll see what I can do. Why don’t you ask your professors to redo this for you? I mean, it seems a valid reason.”
Things get sorted out between Bruce and Natasha. Most importantly, between Steve, Bucky and Tony.
The Hulk gave him a grin before returning back the fist bump. The force used by him, sent Ben flying towards the trash cans at the side.
Tony gulped. He must have seen Steve hugging Tony at the rooftop. Of course, there were security cameras installed everywhere. And how long would it take for Howard to access one of them and look at what his son was up to?
“I was really tired,” Tony said quietly.
“Let me go!” Clint screamed in rage, not knowing who or what had stopped him.
“There is a supermarket just a few meters down.” Kayla was gasping for air while trying to catch up with Tony. They were all walking at a fast pace.
“You know, I still don’t know why there are so many people gathered to visit me,” Tony smiled.
This is just a short chapter about things from Fisk's perspective. There are more to come!
Kayla immediately sprang into action. She started by lifting Tony first. Sam took Clint. Thor placed his hammer on the floor and took Bruce. He couldn’t stop grinning at the little ones. Slowly, they shifted all the babies back to the cots. Steve got up and sighed.
“I’ll bring you. It’s at our basement,” Kayla smiled. She opened the door next to the kitchen and brought Tony down.
“Rhod… Cap, Steve!” Tony cried out. “You’re looking all pumped up and angry! Good! We need you here to lead both sides so that Thor and I can get the stones! Cap, we need you. It’s getting harder to beat them as the hour passes.” Tony’s voice cracked at the end. He closed his eyes for a second and opened them. The screen faded out.
He got up from the couch, rubbing his eyes. “Is that Bucky?” he asked Steve, who was patting the baby’s back.
“You know what, I don’t have time for this,” Tony said sharply. He hurled the shield to the side of the lab. The shield ricocheted off the wall and flew towards one of Tony’s monitors. There was a loud crack and a crash. Steve and Bucky flinched at sound while Tony was standing in front of Steve’s face, looking unfazed. “You’re abandoning your team, Rogers. That’s what you’re doing now. If I die in this battle, don’t come and look for my body.”
“Rides!” Thor and Bruce grinned.
He and a few other workers had started to take the luggage out of the back of the car and move it to the allocated rooms. Tony and his friends walked into the house. Clint and Thor outright gaped at the interior design. The walls were cream colored, the hardwood floor they were walking on was smooth and looked polished, there was a weird looking statue on their left and further down at the ceiling was a small opening which allowed sunlight to come in.
“Hey, I didn’t know we had a pest problem,” Clint laughed. He fired another arrow, that casted a net on the three of them. “And you and your buddies are not welcome here!” he gritted his teeth.
Kayla flushed.
“Guys,” Coulson said firmly. “I think we have an even more important matter at hand. And that’s the safety of Tony, who is 4 years old as of now. S.H.I.E.L.D will lock the AIM scientists up and Damage Control will oversee the clean-up. We’ll leave Dr. Banner with the cure, with the help of the leader.”
“With myself yes,” Steve replied. “With anyone else? No.”
“Let’s take a step back,” Sam said. The three of them along with Chippy moved to the road.
“Well… Whitney why don’t you go first since you’re excited to see Tony present?”
“And delayed,” Steve added.
“F.R.I.D.A.Y, set course to East Somerville,” Tony spoke. He clicked on some buttons and adjusted some switches.
“Agent Coulson is here with a mission, boss,” the AI replied promptly. “The team is gathering at the situation room now.”
Thor was standing up. When the flight attendant asked him to sit, he pouted at her. He sat back down, with Clint patting his back and whispering reassurances.
He ran down the stairs and entered the basement. The lights near the lab was switched on but there was no sign of Tony. Steve sighed. He wanted to wake Bruce up. So, he turned to go back up. But his eyes caught a very subtle movement behind the lab table.
“Then… reinforcements and the team comes in,” Coulson smiled. “For now, go down as civilians, and be on comms. Cap?”
“It’s fine. Not so pain,” Tony replied, still feeling the pain shooting up his leg.
Both Steve’s and Tony’s eyes snapped open. They quickly moved away from each other, wondering why they hadn’t heard the door open, when they realized Vision had actually walked through the wall.
Steve snorted.
At the level itself, Thor was focusing so hard on getting Mjolnir
Tony fights the AIM personnel with the Avengers and later, adult Tony returns back.
“I’m afraid, I did. I used my capabilities, which are my strengths and also at times weaknesses, to win the race between us,” Vision explained, causing Wanda to raise an eyebrow at him.
The big quinjet landed in Wakanda, near T’Challa’s lab. The rear door opened wide. Bright light filled the interior of the jet. Tony was seated on the pilot’s seat. He was looking outside. There were many shrubs and trees. It looked serene. The sounds of birds chirping could be heard too.
“J? How did I get here?” he asked, voice croaking.
“Guys, driver’s here, let’s get going,” Tony calmly said.
“How’s life?” Tony asked. He leaned against the elevator wall.
“Yeah, wanted to drop something in the server before I leave tomorrow.” Tony gave her his charming smile and walked up the stairs, to his dad’s and Obadiah’s shared office.
“Thor is here.” She shut the door.
“Boss, the army is gaining the upper hand in Bleecker Street,” F.R.I.D.A.Y suddenly said. The men broke the hug.
“Nah, he’ll be up after a few hours.”
“It is,” Thor said, as if in a daze. “I really do miss home.”
“Great work,” Steve said. “Okay listen up. I need a team here to deal with the Hydra soldiers who are incoming. I need another team to deal with whatever is happening in the Helicarrier. Someone from that team will need to secure Strucker. Is that clear?”
“Why me.” He rubbed his hands on his face, dropping back onto his bed.
Happy reading!
“I got this,” Bruce told Tony. “I just need Steve to get here.”
“It was pretty bad,” Steve said.
Steve exhaled sharply.
“Thank you, professor Yinsen,” Tony smiled wholeheartedly. He could feel his heartbeat thumping loudly against his rib cage.
“Actually thinking about it, he’s been through a lot worse. I’m sure he’ll recover.”
“Fine,” Tony rolled his eyes. “We should really get going. I bet Clint already caused two arguments with the others about the movies. Oh, and we should give the two girls, Scott and T’Challa a room to stay in.”
Tony couldn’t wait to introduce them too. He also couldn’t wait to look at his new home situated at the edge of a cliff. He was having a hard time, containing his excitement. Moreover, they could go to the seaside any time to have fun or to simply bask in the sunlight.
“Jokes huh.” Sam scooped baby Wanda into his arms. He flung her around, which made her scream excitedly, and placed her down.
Then, he brought Wanda’s and Natasha’s little girl dolls and named them both Claire and Carol respectively. They were the owners of the two animals. They tried to shoo the big bird away, but it wouldn’t leave.
“Steve,” Tony grabbed Steve’s arm.
“That I agree with, because lying is bad,” Tony said. “But Strucker, you can’t force an entire City of people to see what is right and what is wrong. That realization needs to come from every person, from deep down. It’s not your call to make sure they know it’s wrong, but you can always help them see the errors in their ways. I learned this the hard way, Strucker, well, so are you.”
“My butler Jarbis is gone too, isn’t he?” Tony asked Steve, with an innocent look on his face. “That’s why I made him and named him after Jarbis.”
Steve pulled Tony for a hug this time. That was when Tony completely lost it. He was shaking under Steve’s arms while trying to hold back the sounds he could make while crying. Steve was really trying to be strong. He patted the back of Tony’s head while hugging him, tightly. That was all this man, a little boy at heart, needed; a hug and a few words of assurance.
“Thank you. Today, I want to share about how I felt about taking up this module,” he started off strong, making sure his eye contact penetrated every soul sitting in front of him. He had a casual smile, his stance was relaxed and his hands were moving with purpose. “I felt anxious. I mean, I’m all about engineering and math, arts is something I never associated myself with. Also, this module was like my third choice.”
Now that was new. Usually he tried to spend time in the lab, completing project after project. But after a day’s worth of work and Hydra’s serum making him puke, all he wanted to do was sleep it off.
All of a sudden, a Frost Giant launched himself at Thor.
“I’m done,” Kayla said from the kitchen. “Just the candle left.”
“Not a problem. I want the thrill!” Clint bounced up.
“I’m gonna watch some stuff on the TV,” Clint was telling Natasha while entering the mansion. After Tony was done paying the driver, all of them jogged up the stairs. They entered their rooms, ready to get out of their professional clothes.
“He has a couple of scratches,” Clint sighed. “First-aid kind.”
“Oh,” Tony realized.
“We’ll get you new clothes,” Natasha assured the little boy, who was looking at her with a curious look. “And those belong to a friend.”
“How about you share the master bedroom with Nat?” Tony whispered.
Peter gulped. He reluctantly nodded his head because he really didn’t have any other choice.
Both of them held each other’s hands and started walking down the bridge, into the beautiful urban wilderness that was Central Park.
“Guys,” Natasha frowned. “It’s weird. But Tony’s GPS says he’s actually here. But… it doesn’t specifically pinpoint where.”
. He let me help them with F.R.I.D.A.Y and with this tablet. I would be more than willing to go out and help them, though.” He placed an arm on Steve’s shoulder. “I know you’re having your inner arguments. But your team, New York, world, people, everyone needs you. It’s not about the government and accords right now. It’s about the people and your friends. They need their capable leader, Steve. Push in your inner arguments and go. Do you want to look at what is happening there? I’ll show you the videos from security cameras available there.”
“Oh Tonee,” Clint sounded disappointed. Steve and Sam turned to look at Tony.
The car now turned into an isolated stretch of road. It wasn’t long before they stopped in front of a turning. Jarvis honked three times. The others who were asleep jerked awake.
Steve walked away before Tony could say another word. He walked past Bruce and didn’t bother picking up his milkshake.
“Are we racing again?” Thor asked.
After about half-an-hour, they reached Santa Monica Pier. Tony parked the car and all of them poured out of it. He activated the retractable hard top, and it covered the car within seconds.
“Oh Tony,” Professor Williams laughed. “Thank you for that. I think we can move on to the next person.”
Everyone were impressed with what they saw. The Doctor was looking down at the fallen Giant, feeling pleased.
“Right,” Tony rubbed his face. “I’m really sorry if my kid-self did anything stupid or behaved in a weird manner.”
Steve trudged to his cupboard and tossed some random clothes out. He didn’t realize how long he had slept in his room. In fact, all he remembered was crashing onto his bed at 8 last night, after walking down the hallway and reminiscing. He didn’t bother removing his clothes.
“What do the both of you think you’re good at?” Steve asked.
“You have done this before, haven’t you?” Tony asked while Steve was opening him up.
Both of them went on for another minute.
“This is gonna go down in flames!” Clint screamed and served. Jarvis scurried out of their way.
“Yes, just wait for me to stop them,” Tony said and flew straight into the jet, which was quite near the Brooklyn Bridge. Tony made sure all external audio was switched off because that explosion was deafening. He was engulfed in an orange glow as he tried to find a way out of this mess he had gotten himself into. Tony groaned in pain, and realized Friday had gone offline.
“Sure, we might watch a horror movie,” Tony shrugged. “If that’s enjoyment then sure.”
“From your unusually attractive Aunt huh,” Tony was examining the bouquet. Tony looked up to find the others raising an eyebrow at him. Steve cleared his throat to show is disapproval.
“Guys move away! Flamethrowers coming through!” Sam said.
Natasha, Bucky and Clint nodded. Bruce and Wanda left the basement. They were preparing to bury the stone. They were glad that this won’t be a problem they needed to constantly worry about anymore. After burying the stone, all that would be left to do was to wait for the arrival of Thor Odinson.
“What do you mean unidentified? I live here, Vision. Open up!” Tony raised his voice. “I swear to God, Vision, I’m gonna use Clint’s explosive arrow on his face if you don’t open up.”
If you've got any feedback, you can drop it at the comments below! :)
“Yeah,” Clint had a smug smile. “It’s your dance, right?”
“Yes you idiot,” Tony rolled his eyes.
“Boss, it’s the General,” F.R.I.D.A.Y said.
He walked back to Tony’s cot. After a long sigh, he started to speak to the baby’s little back.
He had a chance to talk to Steve, but he ran away again. Perhaps he did need more time. Or, he was convinced Steve was going to reject him.
It took all of Tony’s willpower to not roll his eyes. “I don’t bite.”
He smiled at the padlock before standing up. It was nice to see a declaration of love early in the morning. It felt refreshing, actually.
He sighed. And this time, he went for it. He shut out his inner conflict.
Tony nodded. “Sorry Wanda. I just wanted to protect you, but I ended up overdoing it. And uh, I really hope things are alright between you and Vision.”
“It really stinks and looks disgusting,” Scott grimaced.
Thor turned to him, his smile slowly turning into a smirk.
Maybe telling the truth wasn’t so bad after all.
He wheeled himself away from them, speeding towards the lab doors. They whooshed open for him and he breezed away from them.
Wanda nodded. He seemed to be telling the truth.
“The movements are based on how you want it to move. Like programmed by your mind. You can try it,” Tony smiled. He moved back to look at the work he created.
“I saved Brooklyn,” Tony said while narrowing his eyes and looking at Steve like he should know better. “You’re so welcome for that by the way. I was pretty much the only one who could have reached there on time and stopped the crash.”
She took the glasses of lemonade to the sofa. She was giving each of them their drinks. Everyone looked thirsty, hungry and very tired.
I hope you hang in there!
“Guys, I’m closing in on Strucker,” Tony informed his team. “Jarvis, I’m going to breach the Quinjet at full speed. Divert power to shields.”
“Don’t you dare!” Steve jumped up. “I’m getting the wheelchair. Wanda, come on out.”
“You’re a good guy, Tony. No one tells you that directly. Gosh Tony, why did you even apologize that day? It’s not your fault. It damn well wasn’t. I messed up and I understand why you reacted the way you did. I wish we can change back some things. You’re so brave, and here I am, talking to your back. You need to know something, Tony. You must know, that you have a heart.” The tears fell on Tony’s arms. Steve wiped them and recovered.
“I already secured my flight deck,” Fury said. “SHIELD is almost done apprehending the rest of the soldiers here. We can’t find Strucker.”
“Oh Tony,” Howard shook his head. “I thought your love life was over after what happened with Whitney.”
“Uh, Tony and Steve, step out of the machine now!” Sue instructed them, sounding panicked. Tony, without thinking, grabbed Steve’s arm and started to brisk-walk out. Steve looked at Tony’s hand on his and also at the events that was happening outside; Reed and Johnny having trouble at the controls.
Tony walked to where his bag was. On his way to it, he gave Carson a high-five. Tony looked for his phone. Once he found it, he texted Pepper, telling her that she and Happy were right. He had to focus on himself and maybe he could deal with whatever his past was about to throw at him. He smiled in relief, believing that he would emerge out of this stronger than before.
He immediately flew down to the boardwalk, where everyone was wrapping up the fight with the Hydra soldiers. Clint and Fury were standing there.
Tony goes home, and hopefully, he's content there.
“What’s the plan for tomorrow anyway?” Clint asked. “And are we visiting the Santa Monica pier?”
“Can I have it?” Bucky asked. He had a sad smile on his face.
“Oh sweet!” Maria grinned. Instead of shaking her hand, she pulled Natasha for a hug.
He gently placed Tony on the edge of his bed. Both of them spent some time adjusting themselves and wiping their tears away.
Steve let out a chuckle. He ruffled Tony’s hair and looked at him fondly.
No one said a thing for a few seconds. They were just looking at him, with not much of an expression written on their faces. The only sound was the occasional passing of the cars and the wind blowing past them.
“Mr. Magic came here?” Tony asked.
Sorry, I had to upload this a day late because I was so busy.
Just then, Tony came out of his room. He was shaking his head in disappointment as he had heard parts of their conversation, especially when they spoke with their voices raised.
Behind them, Clint was looking at the stone. He really had a temptation to touch it. He wanted to know what it felt like. The thick grey color was drawing his attention. He had seen the cracks too. But the urge was so strong. He stuck out his right hand, slowly, towards the stone. But he stopped.
“You smell like freedom!” Tony stated, with a mischievous glint in his eyes, after being lifted up by Steve’s strong arms!!
“It’s so sad I can’t even touch it for an experiment,” Tony muttered.
“Are you serious?” she asked while being on the phone. She sounded panicky.
“So you’re awake, young man!” Steve said softly. Tony looked like he wasn’t going to sleep back any time. “Let’s go down.”
“Great,” Clint mumbled.
They reach their destination. Their safe house looks pretty cozy.
Everyone else at the sink quickly finished their job there, and were just about to leave the kitchen.
Obadiah turned to face the younger boy with his lips pursed. “Really, you haven’t forgotten about that?”
“Tony?” Clint looked at him. Tony was literally on top of Clint, holding him down with all the strength he had.
Before he could reply, Tony jumped up from the couch and ran past him. He squeezed Ana in the name of giving her a hug.
“Love you too, Tony.” Steve replied.
“They will go wherever the stone is. I am only buying you time.” The Doctor now stood up. “Show me.”
“Yeah, you and him are best friends,” Natasha laughed.
“Isn’t it your doing?” a lady with her toddler son asked, looking irritated.
“Hi Pepper,” she said as she stood up. “I think we both have something to plan.”
Tony immediately threw the magnifying glass he was holding onto the table. He raised both his hands up and looked at Bruce. Then he started to laugh. Kayla left the basement, chuckling.
“What are you?” Peter sobbed at Iron Man. “Where is Uncle Ben? Aunt May?” Tony sighed before putting down Peter.
Tony relished in the warmth provided by Steve’s body. He placed his head on Steve’s chest, and looked up. Some AIM scientists were slowly getting up, after gaining back their energy and strength.
Carson Wyche appears in the 2008 Invincible Iron Man comic series as an employee in Tony Stark's company, Resilient. He's one of Tony's good friends in the comics and I love their dynamics, which was why I brought him into this AU.
Tony turned to look at the bobbing water and finally let his tears fall. It was true. He was going to be a big failure.
“Yes. Ana, meet Steve, Bruce, Natasha, Clint and Thor,” Tony introduced them. “Guys, meet Ana.”
“Kid-self didn… didn’t get much praises at that age…” Tony was beginning to whisper now. “He would’ve appr… appreciated your words.”
For a moment, the only thing visible in the communal level was a bright light. Clint flew back. Once he landed hardly on the floor, he frantically searched for his bow, and his hearing aids that had fallen off. He quickly found his hearing aids that were right beside him and secured them. He also saw where he had landed. He was inches away from the broken long paneled window, also, inches away from falling to his death.
“I’ll take mine later. One for you, Steve, and one for me.”
“But we need to be united,” Thor spoke up. “We need each other to face bigger threats that may come our way.”
“Got a date today, Tony?” Professor Yinsen asked while walking with him.
“Are you sure Bruce picked
Carson’s face brightened up. “That’s a great idea!”
He was already standing up. She was clawing up his chest, adjusting herself on Tony’s strong arms. She let out a small whine, before kicking Tony, again, on the hip. Tony sighed. He tried adjusting her in various positions, but she seemed uncomfortable. So he tried to put her down, but she screamed and nearly burst out crying, much to the chagrin of Tony. But he didn’t show it. He smiled before hoisting her up again.
Tony was standing at the Gapstow Bridge in Central Park, leaning against the rocky surfaced railing while looking at the Pond. He smiled as he saw the calm waters, almost sparkling under the bright late morning sun. He was dressed casually, in jeans and a white t-shirt.
Tony opened his suit and stepped out of it. His head had a little scratch, and it was coated with blood. Of course, there was a little pain. But it’s not to such a great degree. “I’m fine. You’re okay right?” Tony asked. All of them began walking to where Fury was standing, near a S.H.I.E.L.D van, which was a few meters away from them.
Steve pulled away because he realized Kayla had been on her toes for a very long time. She let go.
They walked to an empty bench that was overlooking the East River. Steve bought a bottle of water from a hot dog cart vendor who was nearby. He opened the bottle and gave it to Tony, who took a few gulps.
“To be with you forever,” Steve whispered.
“You put theatre studies as one of your choices?!” Clint laughed.
He turned to look at baby Bruce, who was on the couch. Bruce was staring at him, eyes wide. He looked like he was about to kick Clint very hard. But his gaze softened slightly when he saw Clint’s eyes filled with tears.
Wanda settled beside Natasha. She too got angry upon hearing how her teammates were attacked and on how she was strangled. She was ruffling Bruce’s hair.
“It’s called Legacy Park, Thor,” Tony corrected him, looking amused. “Yeah, we’ll go there before going back home.”
And soon, she snapped. The redness around her hands completely disappeared. The stone was falling. And instinctively, Wanda reached out for it, forgetting about the repercussions. She could try again. She could try to focus more on getting the stone to stay within her powers and get it to the backyard.
,” the AI deadpanned. Tony sighed.
He helped Rhodey up. While walking to the couch to help make Rhodey sit, Steve said in a dangerously low voice, “F.R.I.D.A.Y, open up the garage. I’m taking the Harley.”
“Hey Tony,” Bruce smiles. “Yes. I already came up with the cure. There’s anti-emetic elements in it to stop the vomiting and a few other components I added to completely remove Strucker’s liquid.”
“Wait, you are feeling odd?” Sam asked. “For Thor coming tomorrow?”
“Cool,” he turned to Pepper. “I’m staying with you till the end of the day so… shall we start off?”
After a few minutes of looking through the menus, Steve went to order and was coming back with Tony’s and his food. Tony decided to order a cup of latte and a slice of rainbow cake, and Steve decided to order apple pie and a cup of orange juice. Really Steve? Orange juice?
“Tony, what makes you think I’ll reject you?” Steve asked after sitting down.
“Please tell me you’re alright there, Diana,” Kayla sounded like she was about to cry. There was a loud scream on the other end of the line, which everyone in the house heard. Kayla flinched. She threw her phone down, accidentally clicking the loudspeaker button and stumbled backwards. Steve caught her before she fell.
The others shook their heads.
What is Natasha's plan?
The new armor which was fully assembled, landed in front of Tony. The little girl gasped when she saw the suit open up.
“Are you okay?” Bucky asked with his eyebrows raised.
There was a flight of stairs. Kayla helped switch on the lights once they reached down. The basement was huge. Just one-third of the basement had the makeshift lab, courtesy of Bruce Banner.
“Next time,” Clint muttered. “Good work, Thor.”
Clint was checking on a cut Tony’s forearm had. He looked up at Tony and then at Steve.
Both of them took out their pants to free their manhood. Tony sighed once he took off his pants. His eyes widened when he saw Steve’s. “Damn, you’re big.”
“What are you doing?” she asked him.
All the noise stopped. Not even the sound of cutlery clanging onto the plates was heard. The pleasant atmosphere simply died.
“Great! So the stone now went to New York?” Bruce asked incredulously.
“Cap?” he said with awe. “Dad found you?”
And here we are, at the end. I salute all of you who have reached here! :)
The Hulk’s fists and Thor’s hammer came into contact.
“Anyway,” Reed clapped his hands, hoping that would remove all tensions from the room. “Both of you can enter the machine and I’ll explain what it does from the outside.”
“Okay Cap,” Tony nodded his head.
Steve looked more at ease now. He continued eating his pie. “So, you made a friend?” he nodded at the cashier, who was attending to another customer.
“It’s hard to push them back. They’re really tall and the portals are strong,” Luke added.
To make things worse, the bank’s alarms had been set off at that very moment.
“So you suspect Obi has been dealing with Roxxon under the table?” Clint asked nonchalantly.
“I think I’ll get her,” Bethany pointed at the door.
“Someone’s demanding,” Steve smirked from his bed.
“I’m damn impressed,” Tony said enthusiastically. “Who recommended this guy to join us?”
“Wanda is right,” Thor nodded. “He has that stone stored in a pendant. He wears it around his neck.” Steve raised an eyebrow upon hearing that information.
Bruce had called him down to his lab. Tony could only hope he had good news updates. He couldn’t wait to stop vomiting. Of course, telling the truth was great but he was getting weaker, Tony could feel it. Which was why he needed the cure soon.
“Anyway, this gas has the capability to tear through the fabric of space and time when placed in the machine. AIM developed something smart but didn’t know how to use it well.”
“Good God!” Bucky’s voice was heard too.
“You’ve been through worse, Tony,” he told himself. “Trust me when I say that getting rejected by Steve isn’t gonna be the most painful thing ever.”
“Sorry to interrupt but I need to borrow the love of your life for a while,” Clint said.
“Welcome to the Avengers Tower!” Tony said.
(For those of you who read my university series and is wondering where is the next update for part 3, it's coming soon! :) )
“You dare!” the Frost Giant shouted. He pushed Steve to where Kayla was and Steve had to make sure he didn’t land on the girl. She was watching the entire incident. She felt weak but was slowly getting up. She really wanted to pull Clint to her.
Rhodey frowned. “But you’re usually with Cap… You… Wait, why are you here?”
“Toe knee”
Bucky thought he heard him wrongly. He was about to ask what Tony made when he saw the “project”.
“Alright everyone,” Jarvis walked out of the kitchen carrying a tray. He carefully placed it on the coffee table in front of Tony and his friends. “Ana, my wife, made crepes for you all. So, these are basic ones, the Nutella ones and strawberry ones.” There must have been at least 21 crepes laid out beautifully on the plates.
“Hey, one day I might find Tony and Thor in Hollywood!” Clint grinned. He shut his laptop and went to his room to put it back.
“It’s five, so you guys go ahead,” Tony said. “I’ve been on one similar, so I know how it feels.”
“He wants to pee pee,” Clint replied. He looked pretty tired.
“Yeah, to try the cure out on him,” Clint stepped in. He winked at Bobbi and earned an eye roll from her.
Tony also saw another photo frame. This one had only his older version and Steve. And in this photo, Tony was kissing Steve, and Steve was smiling.
“Jarvis, come in,” he said. “Jarvis?” he called out even firmly. “Friday, you there?”
“These are really fresh, friend Tony,” Thor licked his lips. “And that vendor seemed quite nice.”
“Not a problem, Mr. Stark,” Spiderman gave him a salute.
“It’s a she,” Natasha corrected him. “She’s doing a real good job. She’s currently overseas.”
At the seaside, Clint couldn’t understand why Steve and Tony were already going home. He and Thor really wanted to enjoy themselves under the sun, but they couldn’t. They decided to come back another day. And Bruce chose this opportunity to give Clint a lecture about personal space.
“He’s my son,” Howard said as a matter-of-factly. “I do whatever I want with him.”
“Don’t believe everything you hear, sweetheart,” Natasha carded his hair and walked past him. The rest of them were snickering, much to the displeasure of Clint.
“And what will that be?” Bruce chuckled.
Steve pursed his lips. “Just use the wheelchair till you fully recover.”
Pepper laughed out loud. “Look, I promised an old friend of mine that I’ll meet her for lunch today. So I have to go now. But… are you sure you don’t wanna go back to the Tower? I’m sure Doctor Banner whipped up something-”
For now, happy reading!
Thor served this time around, with his tongue sticking out slightly. Clint was still going on enthusiastically. He hit the shuttlecock hard, sending back to Thor. Thor was also used to receiving the shuttlecock through the opponent’s forehand smash technique. So it wasn’t difficult for him, but for Clint, well, he absolutely hated that technique.
Steve walked closer to Tony. “You know Tony, I should have done this a long time ago.”
“Okay camera is here!” Clint grinned.
“Thank you very much,” the father said.
When Natasha pulled Clint away, they both fell back near Steve’s legs. Steve was giving them a skeptical look now.
He greeted Tony politely, before Happy stepped in to do his job. He gave Tony a look, motioning for him to save his job.
“Time to make an entrance.”
“I have work to do too, Tony,” Steve deadpanned.
“I was what, about 17?” Linda asked Kayla. “Wow, it has been 7 years since I moved in here!” Linda clapped her hands. Her face was lit up with the joy of that sudden friendly realization.
“You have Hawkeye’s arrows to look into and are supposed to work with Captain Rogers on battle strategy,” Jarvis said.
In a few minutes, Professor Williams gathered the students together.
An awkward silence filled the area, with the only sound heard being the splashes Clint and Natasha were creating.
“Lube’s in the drawer,” Tony said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, I am hungy!” Natasha declared.
“Yes oh god!” Clint let out a laugh and pushed Tony away.
Bruce was observing Clint. He could see that Clint wanted to touch the stone so bad. But was controlling himself.
“I was only joking you know,” Sam managed to stop laughing. “Right, so if I take one of his cars-“
Tony was sitting down on the floor, near the window. Steve was seated opposite him. Bucky was relatively quiet during the feeding session, so was Clint. But Natasha was trying to wriggle her way out of Tony’s grip. She managed to slide onto the floor. Tony sighed before placing her back onto his lap. She giggled before Tony began to feed her.
“It’s ok,” Steve whispered. That was when the tears formed in his eyes. “You don’t have to take the blame for everything. You don’t have to bear the weight of this whole world, alone. And you’re
“Yeah it is,” Clint smiled.
The Doctor went up the porch.
“I’m just glad things are settled. I don’t want another fight or war again,” Clint sighed.
“You let out a dirty joke, and I will sock you in the jaw,” Tony warned Clint, who then proceeded to shut his mouth. He gave a shit eating grin to Tony.
The cube that transports them is something I came up with. I have also added the Avengers' counterparts in Earth 3490, which you can see in the upcoming chapters. Nightshade and the cybernauts in this story is inspired by the comics (to be exact, Power Man and Iron Fist from the 1970s comic).
“I’ll show you the polaroid with took with you!” Clint grinned, hoping that could cheer him up.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No birdy, I was putting on my pants. Get in quick, I’m late!” Tony rolled his eyes.
How was the story? Feedback is welcomed and deeply appreciated. If you have anything to say, please leave a comment below. I'd be very happy to read them and reply! :)
The engines came to live as the back entrance slowly closed up. Within seconds, the jet lifted off the field. They watched from below, as the jet soared high into the night skies.
“Watch thy language, Clint!” Tony snorted. Thor was grinning at this. “But your arm, we’re gonna get it checked thoroughly, okay?”
The holographic screen got cut off and the kitchen light flickered off.
Natasha and Bruce had already left the bed side, leaving Steve there. Steve was going closer to Tony, not sure about his own actions. Tony was thinking if this was real, and moved forward too. He wasn’t sure what he was doing, either. And it wasn’t even him who initiated the move. So they went closer to each other, to see what each of them were going to do.
“Morning,” Clint suddenly spoke.
“Alright then, tomorrow morning it is.”
“It’s all my dad’s and her parents’ stuff, taped up,” Kayla explained.
“It’s a she. Nightshade is responsible for this,” Coulson pointed out. “She created a bunch of cybernauts, which are essentially humanoids, and they are helping her out with the robbery.”
“Me too,” Thor added. He looked like a kicked puppy, as he walked into the room.
Tony had goosebumps when he heard the determination in his boyfriend’s voice. He turned away and looked out of the glass panels. The sun was high above them and he could feel the heat radiating from the panels. Tony felt Steve’s hands curl around his hips.
.” She mimicked him. The others were slowly recovering from crying out of laughing.
Rhodey was in his room, reading a novel. Sam was reluctant at first, but he entered it.
They both entered the elevator.
“Is the tip-off legit?” Steve asked.
Tony and his close friends huddled together on his bed as the opening of a Thai horror movie started to play on the big TV screen.
Will Tony be completely fine?
Tony couldn’t believe what he had just heard because in which world, was Tony worthy enough to lift Thor’s hammer?
“We need to get Chinese!” Clint declared, leaning against Bruce. The rest of them stopped walking, and stood around. “It’s been too long, okay! And Tony, you had fish and chips only yesterday!”
The rest of them started to focus on the battle. The flamethrowers have already run out of fuel and the Frost Giants weren’t giving up. They slowly started to make their way towards them.
“Fifteen?!” Whitney Frost huffed in irritation.
Tony saw the sink, and it was pretty high. So he pushed a chair towards it after placing his two teddy bears on the floor, side by side. He took a glass and climbed onto the chair. He filled it with tap water, and gulped it down immediately. He wiped away his sweat and sighed, feeling slightly better.
“Wow, you’re not lying,” Pepper had a cheeky smile now.
“Yeah,” Bruce responded. “So even if portals are opened using this one piece, it’ll be a weak one. The Frost Giants
Satisfied that the press people had bought their story, the team walked into the elevator. Once the doors shut, they sighed a huge sigh of relief.
“When you put it that way, Friday, it does sound funny.”
“Was juice the only drink Bruce has asked so far?” Clint smirked.
“Access denied,” Jarvis replied smoothly. Tony was completely taken aback, hearing Jarvis’ voice.  “Voice recognition failed. Proceed to thumbprint access.”
Clint, who heard his name suddenly being said, quickly turned his attention to them. He was examining his injury. “But black coffee wakes you the fuck up!” Clint argued back, with a soft voice.
“Yeah, thanks Nat and Bruce,” Steve smiled.
Tony’s eyes slowly fluttered open. The light was too bright for his sensitive eyes. So he shut it back immediately, but opened them again. His frown deepened. He had no recollection or whatsoever of getting to wherever he was right now. So he tried to analyze his surroundings.
“Knowing Tony, I don’t think he’s gonna sit on the wheelchair for long.” Natasha shook her head.
“Fine,” Tony said. “My dad’s words just now, just… I know it was a compliment to you guys, but, I just… got reminded of an old memory. We made breakfast, dad hated it, and threw it all away. I was only… ten when that happened.”
What do you think Tony wants to tell Steve?
“We love you too you know,” she said softly. “Not just because of the numerous tech upgrades you give us. We love you for who you are, for giving us a home, for giving us a family. Most of us never really had one of those. Tony, thank you for all those.”
“We came here to join you for lunch,” Clint said as he sat down beside Tony.
“You know,” Kayla stopped him. “You don’t have to be tough. If you have feelings, it’s better for you to show them. Never suppress them.” She held his elbow.
“Cap?” Tony started, eyes welling up. “Is this how it feels like to grow up? Everyone you love going away?”
Steve had joined them after a good shower. When Tony, saw him, he abandoned the crayons and ran to Steve.
If Happy approved of him, then he had nothing to worry about.
“Communication is key, Tony,” Natasha leaned forward and said. “You can tell us, only if you choose to. We won’t judge you!”
“Everyone,” Bruce announced. “I will be in my lab, trying to get a cure. I’ll also examine this weapon AIM had. Anything, just buzz my intercom. Also, tell me if Tony needs his bandages changed or anything.”
“The pillows and flowers are for you,” Reed smiled. “I know they aren’t as fancy as math equations but hey, we hope you like them.”
“Knowing Clint
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, my companion Iron Man is coming to the rescue,” Tony smiled at her.
That sent Tony howling with laughter. Steve and the others were doubled up with laughter. Even Thor was chortling at that. For a moment, they all had forgotten their troubles and were just chuckling and giggling.
“You sound like you’re blaming me for what happened with Whitney,” Tony said, crossing his arms.
Steve wasn’t looking at Tony or didn’t attempt to have any conversation. He kept looking at the cliffs they were driving past, while hugging himself tightly. The wind was beating past him and he was drying quickly, but he didn’t look happy. If anything, he looked really miserable.
If you have anything to say, you can comment and I'd be more than willing to read and reply! :)
He raised both his hands, which had two air horns. His face scrunched up and he blew it. The noise was deafening; it even made Steve jump despite him knowing what was about to happen.
“Who is Nightshade?” Bruce asked at the same as Steve.
“Were you that traumatized?” she asked. “By the… you know.”
The guests are revealed and the team unite for one last night. Steve and Tony made it up to one another too.
Tony kept looking into the horizon. He spoke after a few seconds. “It’s something my dad did when I was younger. I don’t remember much. But I know it gave me a fear of deep water. I can stand shallow ones, shower is alright. But I can’t do bathtub and deep water. I lose it there and then.”
“That has to be salty,” Steve observed.
“Is okay!” Tony said. Clint and Tony begin to pick up the pieces from the puzzle.
Steve gave Tony’s cheek a kiss, a very firm kiss. Tony smiled at that. His little hands wiped Steve’s tears away. “You shouldn cry, Cap.” He smiled.
Right now, he wanted to see his best friend and this prank was only making him frustrated.
Everyone turned to look at little Tony, who cleverly turned away to avoid their eye contacts. He didn’t really want to look at them. He knew they wanted his adult self-back, but, he felt a pang of sadness that he wasn’t wanted here. Tony crossed his arms and kept looking at the Hydrogen Peroxide solution that was at the end of the table.
“Incoming!” Steve warned Tony. “Tony watch out for that bastard!”
Once Tony was inside, he sighed in relief. Bruce’s cure was already working well. He felt fresher and a little more energetic.
“I... I couldn’t sleep. So I was reading a book.” He shut the book and placed it on the table beside him. “Look.” Bruce started.
“No!” Steve rolled his eyes. “But good attempt.”
“No friend Clint, I say this is mine!” Thor declared loudly.
Bucky was jumping up and down while Tony grinned. Steve scooped both of them up. He nodded at the girls and was out of the door. Kayla was smiling at that.
“Yeah,” Steve said. “Go back to bed guys. Things are fine.” He went back in and shut the door.
“This would have been new for Bucky,” Steve laughed. “But honestly, thank you Tony. I don’t know why you’re doing this for me, for us. A few years ago, I wouldn’t have thought I would meet you and have a chance to dine with the person I love a lot. I gotta thank you for that.”
But all those shakes didn’t stop Tony from descending further.
“Nah, I think I’ll eat whatever Ana has for us,” Bruce said. “I saw you got uncomfortable when they spoke about water. I came to your defense and yeah, that happened.”
“He said
Natasha gave Wanda a small pat. She then walked towards Tony.
“A bunch of kids, I swear to God,” Natasha was laughing at them.
The kids clapped their hands as Sam stood up to bow in front of them. He looked proud of himself. Steve was laughing at this.
“I’ll do the diapers and clothes for all of them.” Kayla said while running up the stairs with the plastic bags.
Natasha reached the road side shop after a few more minutes. She stopped the car and killed the engine. The three of them got out and were startled when they heard Clint’s voice.
It was about 5 in the morning. It was still dark. The babies were sleeping peacefully upstairs with Kayla. Linda had wanted to take the master bedroom. Steve sat up on the couch. He couldn’t sleep much. Something had been bothering him. And it had been waking him up from his peaceful slumber abruptly.
Christmas is in 2 days! I hope you all are doing well during this awesome season. Merry Christmas!!
Here's the next chapter and I hope you guys will love it! Once again, thank you.
“How did I make it this far?” Tony asked softly.
“Ah fuck fuck!!” he cursed and ran back to his room. “Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me!”
“That you do, boss,” Friday sassed him again.
Talking it all out seemed like a great idea on paper, but to execute it was a nightmare scenario to think about. Tony knew his anxiety would shoot off the roof just waiting for Steve to tell him if he liked him back or not.
Tony turned to him and raised his eyebrows. “Uh, thanks?”
Tony looked down at himself. He touched the shirt label that was in front and closed his eyes, trying to get his patience back together.
Tony looked at her for some time. He knew he had to help a friend out. But if any higher level people found out about this, he might not continue to be the top in his cohort. Argh, screw being the top in his course. When his friends needed help, he was damn well there for them. “Fine, give them to me.”
He went to the back of his lab. Steve heard a metal clanking against another metal. He heard Tony grunting and finally pulling out something metallic.
“Hey!” Tony grinned, relieved to see Steve there.
Behind her, Bucky was running too to help Clint out as Tony hadn’t elaborated on what Clint was going through.
“No…” Natasha said. “All the files are really clean. They don’t point to any sinister activities Obi might be up to. I think your dad recently did look at all those files because they were messed up and not in order. So, nope.”
“So, we still go back to hiding?” Bucky asked. He was standing with Wanda and Vision near the couch.
“So, want to assemble that 8-piece jigsaw puzzle?” Steve asked excitedly after placing the card in his pocket. He turned on the hall lights. Tony turned to Steve. His little hands were on Steve’s face. They went across his cheeks and eyes, as if wiping away tears. After that, Tony hugged Steve.
“You brought yourself up here, sir, claiming that you wanted to be and I quote,
“Tony you there?” Bruce’s voice came out. “Where are you guys?”
Steve gave Tony’s head another soft kiss, and Tony already felt safe in his arms.
He saw Steve adjusting his hair in front of the mirror. And he felt butterflies in his stomach. Steve looked so good in professional clothes. And Tony couldn’t help but feel himself getting hard the more he looked at Steve. He brushed that thought off, because his pants was just right, and a hard-on now will make everything tighter.
“And… the AIM guys had the cure, so that’s why they wanted to kidnap Tony Stark?” Bobbi asked for confirmation.
“It looks nice!” Linda commented. She was still looking around, with awe.
Steve sensed this. He broke the kiss, and both of them started to pant. That was when Tony saw the tears in Steve’s eyes. Without another word, Steve lifted Tony up, so that he was carrying him in a bridal style. He tilted his head forward and kissed Tony again.
Hi guys! How are you all? Thank God the weekend is here.
“Linda!” A voice came from the landing on level 2. “Where is Tony Stark?”
By the time Tony returned back home to the Tower, it was 8pm. He had taken a well needed shower. Once he changed into shorts and t-shirt, was Tony able to sigh a sigh of relief. He couldn’t wait to go to bed.
“Hey Jan,” Tony smiled. “Hank problems again huh.”
“And who are you?” he slowly asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
They exchanged greetings while Bruce went on to explain to the four of them about what the girls had done for them.
“You fuckers are in for a fight because buddies, I’m pissed with you two and I’m pissed with you, Fisk, for taking my dance partner away from me,” Clint said angrily.
“Morning sleepyhead,” he gave his boyfriend’s forehead a kiss. “Didn’t want to wake you up. You were really tired, plus, you were snoring.”
Steve and Tony stepped in and kept a safe distance between one another. On the left side of the machine, Steve was looking at the controls and buttons, all sort of alien language for him. On the right side, Tony was also looking at the controls and buttons and could understand what each button would do if activated.
“What do you think
Thor then decided to break the awkward silence by climbing out of the pool and jumping back in. He stretched himself, muscles revealing, and took in a breath. “Watch me friends!” he shouted before jumping back into the water.
“We will,” Wanda said before going to the master bedroom.
“Steve!” Wanda shouted in shock.
Thor pointed his hammer at the portal, and the lightning shot through like no one’s business. The other heroes were looking up at the different types of light dancing around them.
Thor had sat upright within seconds while Clint was taking his time. The bed couldn’t take it. It tipped to the left, sending Thor falling down and Clint rolling towards the floor. The bed ended up landing on Clint.
“Yes, and how did I end up upstairs? I was at the base… We have babies in the house now?” Wanda asked. She couldn’t help but smile at them.
The Frost Giant seemed entranced by it. He stepped into it without a word. Doctor Strange then closed the portal. The fiery sparks disappeared. Steve was staring at that in disbelief.
“Welcome to the new Stark mansion,” Jarvis winked at all of them. “A few boys and I will have your luggage moved to your rooms, which is at level 3. Oh and the plan is for two of you to share each room.”
Sam was on full alert. He stood up to look at the God of Thunder, who was grinning at him.
“Sam,” Steve started. His eyes were slightly red from controlling his tears. “Once Thor comes, the kids will return to their normal age.”
The heavy hitters were standing outside the bank, with Tony looking for more cybernauts that could be hidden amidst the civilian population gathered outside. Right, civilians.
“The stone,” Wanda breathed. “Clint touched it. And…”
“Tony,” Rhodey said in a low voice, warning him to not go deeper into that point.
“Tony, you okay?” Steve asked.
For all those who waited for this, I'm so sorry it took me so long! And thank you for reading my work and for supporting me. It means a lot to me :)
“And then I was telling Hank, hey why don’t we eat at the café for lunch?” Jan was saying, angrily.
“Do you have more in the Tower?” Tony turned to Bruce.
Steve snorted at that. “Try harder.” His reply earned him a glare from her.
“But did you go up to his office to tell him a hi?” she asked.
Steve snorted and spat out some of his orange juice into the cup. The cashier smiled.
“So what are we waiting for?” Thor asked.
“You okay?” he asked once he stood beside Spidey.
At this time, Tony and Clint went beside Sam. “Stee!” Tony called.
Clint’s hand was just a few inches away from the stone. He knew he shouldn’t do it. But what if he touched it and nothing happened? Or what if something happened?
“Trust me, you wouldn’t want to.” Bruce snickered.
“Oh Kay Kay what is it?” Sam asked. He was rubbing his eyes.
“It’s the one with 3 floors, the third being an attic,” Tony answered. The lot of them started to walk while dragging their luggage, Tony taking the lead. “Plus they all don’t look the same. They all have structural differences. Like the house we’re going to has a semi-circle window for the attic. The house right beside it has a square shaped window.” Tony pointed out. Steve had a very small smile on his face. This was the typical Tony.
Everyone else agreed with this gladly. They couldn’t wait to explore the park. Moreover, they couldn’t wait to search for evidence at the Stark mansion.
“As if,” Tony scoffed.
Everyone turned to him.
Once he took his towel, he went to the washroom, silently, thinking about how possessive Steve could get. And how much he had loved it.
“Nope,” Steve sighed. He didn’t give Tony that much of an eye contact. “But you were sleepwalking. I was trying to stop you from going down the stairs but you being you, took one step and fell down.”
Tony looked at the machine Reed had
“What was he drawing?” Tony asked. He rinsed the glass and placed it back on the rack. He then slowly climbed down the chair.
And then, everyone walked away, leaving Steve with Tony.
Tony sighed. He looked out at the sky too, while saying, “Your knee bleeding slightly, mud all over your legs and skirt, the torn papers in your hand and red eyes say otherwise.”
“Carbonara, mushroom soup and cake,” Jarvis briefly answered.
“I’m gonna… gonna..,” Tony couldn’t even complete his sentence.
Steve turned back to walk to the penthouse. He recalled the entire conversation that had just taken place and started to laugh.
Steve lubed his fingers up and turned his full attention to Tony. He widened Tony’s thighs and began to open him up slowly, while using his free hand to support Tony’s back.
“Sorry to break the little moment but, I think it’s time for the little one to sleep,” Clint pointed at the time, that read, 10pm.
“But Bucky fell off a train. How did he not die? Bucky, Bucky, you there?” Tony said, with energy bouncing in him.
“Okay, everyone’s accounted for,” Coulson started. “We just got a tip-off about a bank robbery that’s about to happen, just a few blocks away.”
“Tony, you’re not leaving me. It’s just your adult-self coming back,” Steve tried to assure him. “Don’t be down, young man. You’re not going anywhere and neither am I.”
Clint shut the walk-in closet door and sat down. “I think I’m so scarred. I heard them scream and moan…” Clint blushed.
“The stone,” Steve sighed.
Bucky sighed. “Sometimes. If you call running around a city changing apartments a workout, then I do workout,” Bucky said. That made Natasha sigh.
Tony smiled and found himself running on the path to school. He involuntarily crashed into Janet Van Dyne.
“All personnel, target the kid using your taser guns!” one of the scientists, the leader of this group, ordered.
Clint sighed, while resting his head on Bruce’s shoulder.
“So, Strucker is planning something,” he told them.
Tony couldn’t help but smile. After so long did he see his other teammates gathered together and looking peaceful. He thought of sleeping back again, to wake up after everyone did. So he relaxed, taking in the absolute silence settling in the room, occasionally disrupted by Thor’s soft snores.
He snatched the bouquet from Luke. “I get it, we’ll place it here.” When Luke threw him an incredulous look, he said, “What?! I just did what I felt right.”
“Of course I did,” Tony grinned.
Tony got up and went towards the hammer. He gave it a long look before holding the handle. For a moment, he felt confident. He felt like he could lift it. He tightened his grip and felt the energy coursing through him. Thor turned to look at Tony. He saw Tony’s brown eyes slowly turning blue. He totally forgot he was dissolving the stone because he was that mesmerized at the little boy’s effort; which was paying off because the hammer moved. Maybe he was worthy after all.
And then, the Hulk lifted Tony. He carefully brought him closer, not wanting to squash the little one. Tony threw his little arms around the Hulk’s neck, embracing him. He placed his head on his shoulder and closed his eyes, feeling the Hulk cradling him. The Hulk closed his eyes and rocked his body side-to-side, as if he were trying to get Tony to sleep.
“Iceland sounds like a beautiful place,” Clint smiled.
All six of them got up. Natasha and Thor had to help Clint up, as his legs were shaking. Steve helped Tony up and they all slowly walked to the cars.
And most importantly, is Natasha going to be okay? :(
Steve felt himself relax, and sighed a huge sigh of relief. That doubt has been creeping up ever since he saw Tony naked in his room, in the apartment. But he never really asked because firstly, he didn’t want to bring up the memory of Sunset and secondly, he was scared. Okay to be fair, a little scared.
“I disagree,” Jarvis smiled. He walked to Tony and placed an arm on his shoulder. “I think you look like someone who is going to be so successful, Tony. Forget Mr. Stark’s words. I think you have potential to be someone better than him.”
“So I see you’ve realized,” Steve sighed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now, go eeee, and smile and exaggerate it,” Thor instructed.
“Um,” Steve’s mouth went dry. And he felt his blood rush to the south region of his body. “You look perfect.”
“Oh my God Nat,” Clint said, eyes wide. “I thought Thor was joking.”
“Boss, the stone with the leader is being activated,” his AI warned him.
“You should join us, friend Steve!” Thor winked and left the room.
I hope you guys enjoy this chapter.
He carried the little girl and made sure she was secured before lifting off into the skies.
“Are you leaving?” Tony asked.
He opened the door and was relieved to find no one in there. It was a weekend and Obadiah and Howard had no business in here.
Steve forgot how to breathe for one second.
“Well, then I just shouldn’t lie and I’ll be fine,” Tony said. He swung himself out of his bed, stretching.
“I feel like this is a terrible idea,” Clint suddenly said. “I mean… Nightshade’s smart. How long do you think it’ll take for her to figure our plan out and find us?”
“Where are the heavy hitters?” Clint asked while running down the hallway, looking for any other civilians.
Once at the lab, Steve placed little Tony on Bruce’s table. Natasha, Clint and Thor were also there.
“We bring them back.” Thor stood up. “We start with the ladies first.”
Tony looked around to see if anyone had heard that.
And thank you so much for your support for this story and series. It means so much to me, and I'm very grateful for you all!
Steve was curiously flipping switches and saw the numberings change from 1610-U, 9810-U, 3490-U and 616-U. He left the switch and looked at the other controls. Tony was playing with the speed button. He placed the option at maximum launch speed.
The Frost Giant contemplated for a moment. He turned to look at the babies and realized that he might as well follow this strange man’s instructions as he seemed to know what he was saying.
There were more scientists running from the right end of the hallway. Tony swung the hammer ferociously, hitting some of the scientists right onto their abdomen area. He also electrocuted some of them.
If you've got feedback you can leave it at the comments below. I'd be more than glad to read and reply! :)
“With jeans?” Steve scoffed. “No way.”
“You missed the view so much?” Tony laughed.
“You're still mad at me?” Natasha frowned.
Speaking of which, the genius was really tired. He had been up all night upgrading his own suit, and also tweaking a few things on Black Widow’s bites. He only managed to fall asleep at 4am, and was woken up by the love of his life, Steve Rogers, at 7am.
Tony entered his company with a flood of his employees, all wearing monochrome colored work attire. He shook his head in disapproval. Perhaps he should prepare a proposal for Stark HR about work attire, to let office workers wear whatever they want to. Of course, nothing revealing. Work appropriate but with more colors! Stark Industries should not be just another corporate entity where his employees came to work like a robot. It had to be filled with life and smiles.
“Yeah.” Linda entered the conversation. “My parents, they died in a car accident.” Tony stiffened. “Just by the highway outside this neighborhood. You guys must have passed it; aerial view.” She pointed up.
“Bufay”
“I don’t know man,” Tony said.
“Is he awake?” Natasha entered the room. “Finally! Tony, what’s the plan?”
“We can see, friend Clint,” Thor said loudly.
There was a moment of silence. And then, “That was the joke?” Steve deadpanned.
Coulson pinched his forehead while nodding his head. Beside him, an agent, Bobbi Morse, was taking down notes.
After calling down enough lightning, Tony jumped up. His jet boots powered up, sending him higher. He then started to descend. He aimed directly at the stone, not caring about what it could do to him. He used the powerful Mjolnir and hit the stone with all his might.
