step in the right direction. “So, you know, from my point of view, it wouldn’t be a bad thing if we actually did it…”
interesting conversation about it. And now Tony found himself desperately hoping that he’d shown enough polite interest in the idea.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked carefully, that little hint of anxiety creeping into his tone. Tony looked up at him, fixing him with as serious an expression as he could manage in his current blissed out state.
“Brooding in the dark at four in the morning?” Bucky questioned, with faux innocence. Steve sighed grumpily.
Steve, he’d known him for seven years – and the only thing about him that had never made sense was the thing Tony had made up. The only confusion that Tony had ever felt was trying to reconcile Steve as he found him, with the facts Tony had decided
“Okay, why is Rhodey here?” Pepper demanded – and, again, Tony ignored her. He just waited until Rhodey strode into the kitchen, already brandishing his phone in a,
And suddenly, there it all was – all the complicated history between he and Steve, laid out in his mind. Every fight, every meaningful look, every shared moment and every betrayal… and all the different issues that ran through it all. All the irrelevant bits cut out, all the important points in order, just like that.
And now for the personal introspection 😂 But please be aware, that both Steve and Tony are still working things out, and while some of these thoughts are things they really believe and stand by - others may be revisited at a later date...
“Oh Tony please,” Steve panted, that tantalising hint of the stretch that he needed melting away from him, as his body relaxed to let Tony in. The same teasing hint that flared up and burned itself out, as Tony slid a second finger into him, and
Tony could see the blood rushing up his neck, the way his cheeks flushed, the way his whole body tensed, tight and poised and to the point of breaking…
the commitment I’m making when I do this. I’m promising to love you and take care of you for the rest of your life. And I
Steve visibly wilted away from that image, closing his eyes and throwing his head back, tears streaming down his face now… And, yeah, that’s what he would’ve done, in a fantasy. It still didn’t occur to Tony that this meant Steve
The brief fire of his interest seemed to burn out, his words melting back into that warm, sleepy tone as he settled back against the wall.
Steve thrust into him again, sharp and shallow, twisting his fingers as he ran the flat of his tongue over the length of him. Tony’s pleading was immediately swallowed by a low, feral moan, his hands tugging at Steve’s hair. And all the while that pressure pulsed in Steve’s hips, wrenching painfully with every move Tony made-
Tony was just overwhelmed with love for him. It was like there was an orchestral flourish in his head, like a shimmering spotlight had just appeared on Steve’s glorious form. Such an intense and genuine affection that Tony couldn’t
“Don’t see how.” Steve sighed, “And I don’t think she can be pissed at me for… failing to save her family, or whatever, seeing as I’m pretty sure she’d never even heard of me. Well. I think.”
But on nights like tonight… It just hurt. Tonight, Tony was too weary to analyse it, too melancholy to examine it. Nights like tonight the sadness was just
“Look, Anni-Vara is a wonderful place, so much better than that hell hole you’re from, and it always has been – but it
...He knew they had water heaters now that worked much quicker. That he could, if he wanted, install a specific tap that dispensed boiling water in an instant. And he
Steve smiled, and set aside the page of notes he’d been looking at - knowing full well that this question might have nothing to do with what they were just talking about.
And, in a weird way, it was exactly what Tony had been expecting Steve to say… until he said it. Until Tony heard the genuine, naked remorse in Steve’s voice and realised just how
I possibly just wasted the last twenty years of my life by fucking the whole plan at the last minute. And,
Going back to that moment had always been one of Steve’s three magic wishes - the sort of thing that wasn’t even a dream, it was so far outside the realms of reality. He’d asked himself how this would feel, entirely hypothetically, so many times-
And he didn’t see the man he’d been yelling at for the last eight months, or even the man he’d cried over… Tony saw Steve the way he used to, back when he first fell in love with him. He saw all those heroic qualities and human frailties and endearing little elements unique to Steve, and without that filter of doubt or regret.
“Your room is the nicest.” He answered, already looking over Tony’s shoulder to the door, expecting Tony to just turn and lead the way.
“I did my absolute utmost to be honest with people – even in a world where no one knew me and it was so hard to be vulnerable and I had no idea what things I was supposed to say and which I was supposed to keep to myself. That’s not ‘who I am’, though. No, I
Steve hearing that news, and not freaking out. He could imagine Steve listening, calmly, and kindly… he could believe that Steve would still look at him the same way afterwards.
“Okay, so, as I said, it’ll take a few moments for the effects of the atmosphere to settle in” Janine explained-
“Honestly, I don’t know yet. I know I have to start with thinking it all through, and coming up with a list of questions… When I know what it is I’m trying to work out, maybe… But right now I think it means trying to remember a bunch of creepy monologues from Obie, and trying to hunt down more of those creepy medieval vampire diaries,” and then, before Steve could intervene with another anguished clarification, Tony pointedly added, “which is
Steve knew his comfort on that one should have been how well he’d prepared for it. The fact that he’d bothered to write instructions and mailing lists for all the right people, that he’d plotted all their next moves for them. That he’d already written back up plans for his back up plans, if anyone dropped the ball. That he already knew exactly what sort of system he was going to build in the next few months, regardless of what happened right now.
He let his head fall into Steve’s lap, a dreamy smile washing over his face as Steve stroked a tender hand over the back of his neck. For a few moments, there was nothing but this perfect, simple happiness, and this complete, unquestioned safely…
the things he’d done today seemed so much more anxious and uncertain and complicated than they were at the time-
Instead of which, he walked over to the cabinet and retrieved his favourite mug, and then started making a fresh pot of coffee - resolving to let his thoughts to drift wherever they wanted.
It was only when Tony heard himself ask that last question that he realised how hurt he was that Steve had kept this from him. And not only because it might’ve made so much difference if he’d known all of this, not just because he felt he had a right to know… Mostly, it was because he thought that he and Steve were closer than that.
it was so… ordinary? Well, no, obviously that wasn’t the right word, but… Lying there with Tony, watching the evening slowly melt into night, letting Tony play with his hair while they talked about absolutely nothing… At the time, it felt so familiar and natural, like they did this every day. Steve hadn’t felt anxious about it ending, he’d not felt especially overwhelmed that it was happening at last, he’d not thought about what he was
“Come here,” Tony smiled, snaking an arm under Steve’s back and pulling him onto his knees. Steve threw his arms around him, pulling Tony hard against his chest and breathing him in.
, when he fell open like this. The slippery luxury of the sheets against his skin, the way his muscles shifted under Tony’s touch, the way the air expanded in his lungs…
He gritted his teeth as he arrived, already braced for the flood of awkward questions he’d spent the last few days holding back
“Oh, uh, those are a failed attempt at a responsive chemical defensive system,” Tony breathed a laugh. “The whole theory was flawed, as it turned out – but I liked them, so I kept them,” he shrugged, and Steve grinned.
His shoulders tensed, and he reflexively tapped his watch to make sure that he could arm it quickly - but he wasn’t especially perturbed. In fact, this was probably as calm as Tony could be outside of an Avengers facility. He had been staying in this hotel for over twenty years. He trusted his security checks. There was nothing especially controversial about this particular conference, or any of the people speaking at it-
Trying not to remember the way SHIELD had treated him, and how much that had hurt him, and how unfair it all was.
And found that they now had their arms wrapped tight around each other while Bucky kissed Sam’s neck.
But he knew that was only because he’d chosen the points that suited him. Chosen to avoid the points that didn’t… one point in particular…
“So, you are primarily concerned that you haven’t explained this impulse to Captain Rogers?” JARVIS clarified. “You are not primarily concerned with the impulse itself…?”
He started listing mundane details as they walked into the building, through a large reception room and down a long, ridiculously wide corridor - noting the different colours and materials he could see, profiling the few people they walked past, trying to place the sounds he could hear echoing in the distance…
Steve heard Tony snort a laugh – so, apparently he’d heard it too. When he glanced up at Steve, he looked undeniably
going to ask Steve if he was alright, so there wasn’t really any point in getting all tied up over it.
to put his head in his hands, to curl up in a ball and just disappear, but he could only drop his head and bring his knees up and just
he opened the door. Maybe then he could have built up a defence. Reminded himself of all the things he’d spent years working out.
Ordinarily, that was the sort of thing that might vaguely annoy Steve. He’d always been slightly defensive about people taking it upon themselves to help him, especially if they managed to do it without him knowing. There always seemed to be something presumptive in things like that, something that nagged at a particular vulnerability. However grateful he told himself to be, however well-intentioned the other person was, there was always a part of Steve that felt caught out, or trapped, or something. The effects of his perilous childhood, or a by-product of his natural stubbornness, probably.
that he knew exactly where this was going, before he bothered processing all these new ideas… and he just knew it was going to be depressing, or infuriating, or both-
,” Steve keened, all but thrashing against the mattress now. Tony responded by pulling back enough to twist his knuckles against his rim, dragging another low, grinding pleasure through him-
“Did you ever talk to anyone?” Tony asked, cautiously. There was a rising feeling of discomfort in him… an anxiety about what he was about to find out. “When you came out of the ice, or, since then, I don’t know… I mean, did you ever speak to a therapist, or-” But Steve had physically flinched at the sound of the word, shocking Tony to a stop.
“I meant everything I said, Steve,” he assured. “It’s just the other stuff. The things that make the stuff I did say… more complicated, in real life…”
Steve had no idea how long he floated there, flooded through with this pleasure, completely balanced and content and…
“Well, no, you don’t – have to…” Tony cut in just a bit too quickly, faltering when Steve’s gaze snapped to meet his. “…It’s an interesting concept, I mean. And, uh, I think you’re right, for what it’s worth…” He trailed off, awkwardly.
in that sense, but…” he trailed to an awkward stop, visibly struggling with the task of putting this into words.
Tony inched his way down the centre of Steve’s body, trailing slow, soft, kisses down towards his stomach. The pleading note in Steve’s breathing pulled into a high-pitched whine - and then snapped, setting free a wave of babbled desperation,
But now that he was frantically searching for a response, he was hit with all sorts of reasons that he couldn’t speak.
“But I’m going to work to earn it anyway. I know this is just a start, too. I know I have to put as much work in… to this, and… to me, probably. There probably
He was furious at everyone who’d helped bring this nightmare back into the world. He was aghast and outraged at the thousands of people who’d accepted and defended this project. He thought of all the people who had worked on the Tesseract,
as his fingers flexed against Tony’s skin. Having already let go of every ounce of need and tension in his body, Tony’s reaction was now more reverential than desperate, his heart swelling with an amazed admiration as he took in all the beautiful details of him.
“We need to get up to the third floor.” Tony explained fluidly – pointing in the other direction entirely. “Well, actually, we need to get up to the fourth floor, but, you know, third floor first.”
“Even though neither of us knows what’s going to happen?” Steve pressed, in a pleading tone. “Even if it means you end up changing, or if I’m immortal-”
“I’ve known you long enough to know when not to push it,” Bucky clarified, with a soft smile. “But, you know – that means I also have to know when it

wanted to touch Steve, just to… and he couldn’t decide whether it was okay to want that for a moment, and go with it, or whether it was bitterly fucking typical, and he should just go ahead and hate himself for that too.
“You know, to begin with - none of last night was your fault. You were amazing last night - I mean, even before…” And he had to pause while Tony snorted a surprised little giggle “...But I mean it, I don’t know what I would’ve done without you to deal with… everything… last night…”
Steve had no doubt this was exactly the sort of response that would have bothered him, twenty four hours ago. He
Perhaps, when he got to thinking about it, Tony would judge Steve for this, or decide that he wasn’t a very nice person because of it… But he would never take it personally.
intending to at least pay attention to where they were going. If there was nothing else he could do, he could gather some intelligence - which was really just an attempt to control of his rapidly escalating temper-
“Like what?” Tony asked, kindly. And Steve found himself taking a little breath before he answered… because it

could be a glorious daydream of a better future, being stronger, having Steve be a part of his life… Or, it could be an ominous nightmare of watching Steve throw his life away, having Steve come back to him again and again long after he wanted out, because Tony
If it seemed like Steve was at all hesitant, it was only because his legs were trembling. There wasn’t any resistance left in him…not for Tony. He realised, with an unexpected swell of calm, that he really
But then, just as his thumb was hovering over the call button, a sterner internal voice managed to get his attention.
. For anything.” He yelled, throwing his arms out now in an expression of frustration. Adam flinched, and Steve ignored him. “Rhodey has
And he looked at Tony – and Tony realised that he wasn’t breathing. His throat was suddenly tight. And then he saw Steve recognise that he said all of that out loud.
And he thought of all the people he’d been fighting with, before these epiphanies… the fact that they would’ve just been in the compound for the last few days, unaware of any of this…
I thought, you know, I would try to…undo that, by not doing that again… but I didn’t really know what to do instead, so…”
The good news is that I expect things to get back to normal at work thereafter - but, as it happens, I have a two week holiday coming up after that, so I don't really care 😆
All those nights on the run… He’d relived that fight in the conference room as many times as he had that fight in the bunker - always trying to change the ending. Never being able to.
getting closer… Or, I don’t know, I thought maybe we were…” his voice trailed into a shy mutter, before he cleared his throat and forced himself on, “and… being with you made me feel safe, and happy, and I just didn’t want to ruin it. And I hated myself every time you mentioned your parents, and every time I had to lie to you, but every time I thought about coming clean I just…  I just hoped you’d never find out,” he surrendered, and then hurriedly added, “or, that I’d at least be able to find Bucky first, and figure out exactly what happened before I told you, or, you know, maybe it would turn out that it wasn’t him, or that maybe it wasn’t even true… Which I never really thought would happen, but I still hoped…” He exhaled slowly, dropping his head into his hand and rubbing his eyes. “I’m sorry, this more annoying than the letter-”

His phone screen went dark, and instinctively Steve swiped it awake again. Every time he did that, he reminded himself that it was pointless. That he’d see the text either way. That he couldn’t make it arrive any quicker by being more prepared for it.
“Well, assuming you’ve not forgotten where that Siberian Bunker is,” Tony answered him anyway, reluctantly raising his head-
– and they get a round of applause for getting out of bed ever again. Good for them, look at what they’ve been through, what more can you expect – I tell you what more you can expect. You can expect them to go right out there and risk their lives for the world again, and they should be polite and understanding and reasonable throughout, mind stone or otherwise. They should be able to get through the downfall of their whole
“Well, when you figure it out, can you at least give me a heads up if it’s gonna get me shot?” Bucky surrendered, rolling his eyes.
“So, walk away,” Bucky suggested, shuffling forward himself – obviously thinking the same thing that Steve was. “No offence, but no one is going to bother going after the doctor. They’re going to want the guy running this place – unless you kill Captain America. If you do that, it’s the end for you. You know it.”
“Fuck,” he muttered, rubbing his eyes with his free hand, the other still hovering gingerly over his pocket. He looked up at the house, wondering if it would be better to have this personal crisis out of view…
“Oh God yes, please yes, please,” Steve answered immediately, still grinding back against his fingers. He bit back a shout as Tony moved his hand away, that same desperate entreaty repeating over and over in his head,
Without any further prompting, Steve sat up enough to pull his own shirt over his head and toss it aside. And then, before Tony could grab for him, his hands were unfastening Tony’s belt, his fingers curling over Tony’s waistband.
Out of habit, Steve braced for that uncomfortable clench in his back, or that dip in the pit of his stomach…
And even then, Steve could barely take those details in - he was still so overwhelmed by what he was holding.
“Please baby, I want you to fuck me,” Tony promised as he scrambled to retrieve the lube from his pocket, hastily pouring a generous amount over his hand as he continued to stroke the length of him.
himself if it might be okay? No longer even considering cutting ties with the beautiful, deluded boy who’d just asked to be bitten… like those kids in Florence…
Without thinking, Tony curled his palm around the length of Steve’s cock, never breaking his rhythm. Steve cried out, only managing a stream of fragmented sounds before it dissolved into a wordless, sobbing plea. Tony felt that pressure reach a tipping point, the unmistakable escalation of wave after wave of pleasure crashing before the last had chance to ebb away.
Every inch of his body clenched in panicked urgency, his hands grabbing for Tony’s shoulders in a physical, almost frightened impulse to
“Yeah, I’d love to,” he beamed, casting a final glance over the workshop before he gestured towards the elevator,
“You just aren’t sure about all this, huh.” Tony smiled, deliberately keeping his voice friendly. And Steve winced a little smile back at him – like he’d been caught out. Clearly, one night of kinky sex and drug fucked conversation hadn’t completely cured that deep-rooted anxiety of his…
you love him. You’re scared of letting him get to know you because you love him, you kept that secret because you love him. You pick at him and second guess him because you’re scared to death of him getting hurt and
And then Tony felt someone look at him, and turned to see a man in a navy blue suit, smiling at the two of them.
“What are they?” Someone asked for him, as Steve turned the flower under the light of the sun, entirely distracted by the shine on the petals…
“Okay,” Tony decided, after a few deep trembling breaths. “Okay-” Was cut off by another smirk, and a heroic attempt to swallow it down. “
Tony had started out by gesturing towards the couches, and even made a token attempt at sitting down - but, of course, he could never stay still when he was explaining something.
And then the screen flashed, and Tony’s smile widened – and when Steve looked over his shoulder, he could see the message on the monitor:
“So what do you want from us?” Steve asked, robotically, his chest aching all over again - his fear of losing Tony back on the table, along with everything else. And he looked over at Tony.
“And why does Pepper think you’re missing your own party?” Steve asked, knowingly. Tony frowned for a second before he realised why Steve was asking.
Steve was lying on his back, with Tony curled up on his chest, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder. Steve had one arm wrapped around Tony’s waist, and the other hand – for the moment – playing idly with his hair. They’d been lying like this for maybe half an hour, quietly, while Steve let his fingers trace over Tony’s arms, touched his face, kissed his forehead… And Tony sighed happily, and snuggled closer to him, and pressed soft, slow kisses to his neck…
turn around to have this conversation with him – because they’d actually just pulled into the parking space in front of his house.
But, just as Tony was about to completely commit to the comfort of that assertion, he glanced up at the workshop again.
to want to bite him. Tony ‘going along with this’, or pushing past some personal discomfort to indulge Steve, or simply thinking he should… wasn’t even close to what Steve wanted. It wouldn’t be any sort of compromise, there would be no upside for Steve to take from it, no ‘well, at least he did it’. If Tony did it like
that defensive impulse, the way it concentrated all of Steve’s strength, the way it responded so viciously to every breath Wesley took.
“You’re going to make us forget that slavery is objectionable?” Steve asked, a growing unease at the idea that… no, that was even
Actually, at the moment, he was mostly worrying about the revelation that – on top of everything else – Tony was trying to survive on a basic ration of diseased blood-
fuck me, I wonder what that’s like. You know, I would have the most sympathetic story of any world ending super villain you ever met – but I didn’t even decide to just be a regular, slave owning corporate villain. I didn’t
sent a perfect apology along with that phone… Sure, that might’ve helped matters. Maybe Tony would’ve called the phone, then. Maybe they’d have got to a conversation sooner. But it would still have left all of Tony’s insecurities and neurosis and anger under the surface, if he’d not been pushed to letting them all go like that. It would have left all of
“The Eden – strongest drink they do” Tony told him with a salesman’s grin. Steve took a cautious sip… actually, it wasn’t too bad. Sweet, and sugary. “I told anyone who’d listen that you have an impossible tolerance. As loud as I could.” As Tony was talking, Steve was deliberately draining one of the glasses – mainly because he didn’t want to have to hold two of them. Tony waited until he’d finished, and set the empty glass aside, to tell him, “Well, the barman is definitely looking at you”-
“You don’t know how many times I’ve daydreamed about being held against this chest,” Tony sighed. “You have no idea what it’s like, being wrapped up in your arms. How safe I feel. How happy you make me…”
“Just as long as you know better than to try and keep me out of danger, or stop me doing stupid stuff, or to try being all protective of me.”
“That’s not really the point either,” Tony smiled. “I mean, if I’d driven into a stop sign at a hundred and ten miles per hour, all four of us would be dead, wouldn’t we?”
Looking at him, sprawled out on the couch, frowning up at the ceiling as he considered ideas at random, Steve could see the Tony that he’d only gotten glimpses of, during the brief time they were actually friends. It felt more like looking at Tony in his natural state, the resting position he was always being pulled away from-
He grabbed Steve by the hand, and tugged him through the door, purposely striding into the middle of the room in a desperate attempt to distance them both from the hallway.
And then he looked up at Tony... in time to see his features fall in such innocent, open sadness that it hurt Steve’s heart to look at it…
Tony’s breath hitched, as Steve’s hands reached his waist and worked their way under his shirt. The thrill of his touch on Tony’s bare skin was so intense it almost burned, like all of Tony’s blood was rushing to meet Steve’s palms. His cock throbbed petulantly, tugging a low ache from low in his groin - but the urge to lift his arms was greater. The impulse to help Steve undress him, to feel Steve’s body pressed against him, drove Tony to lift his shoulders rather than his hips… That compulsive ache coiling the whole time, like a panicked reminder to hurry.
“I don’t think that’s how dead works, Cap.  I think when you’re dead, you’re dead.” He observed. “But I still know you’d be dead for me, and that’s still a big thing. So, you know, I do believe you”
He had the strangest feeling of deja vu, and wondered if this was one of the many things Pepper had tried to explain to him back when he was in a different haze.
And, at the same time, the now familiar flush of heat, that compulsive, craving feeling - that odd sense of pride…
As much as I like to build suspense towards the end of every chapter, I also appreciate that MCD is a major tag for a reason, and a topic that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. So, rather than having anyone being anxious that I've woefully mistagged or something, I'd rather just let you know in advance - none of the major characters die.
Steve let go of a trembling breath, his face flushing with a happy tearfulness as he whispered back,
that Pepper would give him every minute of her time, ride out every spike of his emotions, give him every assistance in a plan she thought was sensible-

outside of Steve’s frame of reference. He could package that whole thing up as something he didn’t understand, something he could simply assume worked in a reality different to his own - he could take as a given that Quill’s father knew what he was, and that it probably made sense to him, and that it had nothing to do with the world as Steve knew it.
Steve was just glad he made it until the doors closed before his legs gave out completely, and he was forced to fall back against the wall to steady himself.
, is he actually like, a serial killer the government has under house arrest?” Nat clarified, unaffected. “Or has he literally replaced all his limbs with robot parts – you know, the
And now he found himself standing on his own doorstep, feeling dizzy and headachey and uncomfortably out of sync with the world -
“But I don’t think that now, is my point. I did listen, when you were saying what a huge catalogue of mistakes that lie led to, and the fact that it

“Hm?” He squeaked. Tony responded with that same soft laugh, and Steve was faced with the unique discomfort of melting and tensing at the same time.
didn’t really know what it meant. But Nick would at least understand if he saw a bloodstain on the coffee table, or a medical bag in the trash…
And he couldn’t think what advantage Pierce would be seeking, in referencing that very obvious fact… It was more likely that he was just trying to be considerate, and that Steve was being paranoid about it…
sure it isn’t a Hydra base yet,” Tony replied, apologetically. “I did think about that base in New Jersey you told me about, where that… Zola, had his brain stored on digital tape…” But then he saw the little flash of hope in Steve’s eyes, and felt compelled to temper it, “but I mean, I already have three very big questions just about that fucking sentence, and there’s all sorts of reasons that might be… a whole other thing, so, I don’t know, that’s still a maybe. And, anyway, we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Still on the list,” he reminded Steve, pointing at the hologram.
After all the medical checks and the mission reports and the trying-to-be subtle enquiries from the team, when Steve had gone back to his room to shower and change. He’d been grinning as he closed his bedroom door. Possibly humming to himself as he pulled his bloodstained shirt over his head, happily lost in shapeless ideas of just how good everything was…
the things that are true, there is the fact that I did hold you to a different standard over it, over everything really, and
“Greetings, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS welcomed him after the fact. But Steve was still staring at the unguarded entrance to Tony’s lab.
But there was that creeping feeling, the one that had been growing ever since Tony had snapped at him about hurt feelings – as Steve became increasingly sure that he’d been doing this all wrong the whole time. Now, he thought back to his original ‘plan’, his hopes that Tony might just…
Tony sat up and gasped for air, a wave of dizziness crashing over him along with the rush of oxygen. For a few moments he felt entirely weightless, his head quiet save for the rapid beating of his heart. When he regained enough awareness to think of it, Tony began to fill his lungs more deliberately, focusing only on catching his breath.
It would mean being alone forever. Tony already knew that. Whether Steve was a part of his life or not, Tony knew that he’d never be able to give his heart to anyone else for as long as Steve was out there somewhere.... He’d never get over him.
hurt to think of Tony being with anyone else. It wouldn’t have, a few months ago – even though Steve was already in love with him by then. It might not have hurt last week. But since the night they’d spent together, and everything Steve had worked out afterwards… yeah, the thought of Tony kissing someone else made Steve’s heart clench, now.
Adam’s eyes widen in alarm, at whatever the announcement had been. He saw him glance, forlornly, at the smartphone he didn’t dare lunge for-
Of course it was shallow and disrespectful to be meandering around the palace with a vague sense of interest. It was self-centred to have forgotten all about it, even for a moment…
“...Uh, well yes actually - or, rather, the Teo Torriatte family as a whole is responsible for most of the pollen that’s in the atmosphere in the city.” Dr Arden explained.
Until Steve coyly mentioned that he might actually like to go to a Varian party – and then the specific appeal was immediately, viscerally apparent.
As it turned out, it wasn’t only Steve who’d had his entire persona altered by fate this afternoon. While he had been laying the foundation stone of a nervous, sad and stoic identity, Nat had narrowly avoided a different foundation - entirely by chance.
And then his eyes happened to catch on the tray, sitting ominously at the very corner of his vision. It occurred to him that he really didn’t know what any of those drinks were – and that that was
And then it was like that little light inside him just died. Like cool water thrown over glowing embers,

personal version of hell. A conversation without objective purpose, in which he had no pre-agreed stand and there was no obvious right answer… a potentially complicated, confusing, political conversation with Tony. And yet, he absolutely meant it when he said,
He heard the soft hum of approval from Steve, like a balm on his skin. An immediately soothing sound that managed to settle the trembling.

was an entirely understandable reaction. This was just because Tony was so impossibly beautiful, because Steve
Oh, well, that probably explained the subtle way Natasha checked at least three different concealed comms devices, before she plastered an actress's smile on her face and let herself into Tony’s house…
“And, if I may, one of the best ways of dealing with that initial stage is with the right supplementary substances…” Dev added, gesturing cautiously back to his screen. And Tony nodded automatically,
get its head kicked in to prove his point. That he had no right to dismiss anyone else's suffering, just because everyone seemed quite happy to dismiss his.
“Which made it sound like he had his own little euphemism for the telephone,” Steve muttered, and Tony laughed.
He realised he was kneeling on the floor of a large empty room, walled on all sides by flawless glass, not unlike the expensive offices at the tops of skyscrapers… And he was up high. Not as high as his room in the Tower, maybe… But at least fifty stories. High enough to make out the shape of a sky line, to be looking down on the rooftops of surrounding buildings and blur the details on the ground below...
… whole thing…” he said, gesturing vaguely towards Steve, and then to himself, and then more pointedly at Steve again, “
This wasn’t about the impossible, inhuman things that Steve could do… It was about all the wonderfully human things that Captain America was. It was suddenly
Steve’s heart seized, his breath lodging at the top of his lungs like a solid mass, his entire body pulled upright by the sudden tension in his shoulders-
. Better than anyone. And, a lot of what you’re talking about, it’s… It’s not you, it’s him. It’s just the way he reacts to things. He’s just… like that…”
“...And one of those things was sending the Winter Soldier to kill your parents, and make it look like a car crash.”
. He’d never once thought about a life with Bucky in it, never asked himself what Bucky would do if he were there, never looked forward to a time when Bucky could help him…
His first attempts to say something were completely swallowed up by a grief-stricken, heart-felt sob, his shoulders shaking with the effort of it, his whole body pressed down under the weight of it…
And Tony did a literal double take, and stopped what he was doing, and just looked at Steve for a second.
control of him. Moments when all authority and responsibility shifted onto Tony’s shoulders, moments when Steve’s burdens were just taken from him… This natural process, this physical and neurological reaction that they both seemed to have, whenever Steve really needed it – and
Steve was already smiling when he opened the door - a smile that softened somewhat, when he saw the state Tony was in.
“It’s okay Steve, everything’s okay,” Tony promised, sitting himself upright. He felt Bucky slip away from him, as he took his own weight-
actually the best possible use of the time they had. He knew there was still so much left to talk about, but none of it felt as important as just being with Steve…
Tony threw his head back and let out a soundless scream, stars exploding behind his eyes as that visceral heat flooded up his back. He felt as though he was being split open, the sensation tearing through the core of him, every cell in his body searing as he was stretched to his very limit.
“Ah, well Torriatte flowers are one of the most common inebriants used in your universe - although, not on your home planet, I gather?” She raised her eyebrows, and Steve shook his head obligingly. “Well, they have a number of different applications, depending on the variety. Some are used to treat mental trauma, or to prepare people for surgery. Some milder strains are treated as food products for social events. Some are purely recreational,” her smile warmed a little at that.
“Sorry,” Tony smiled, turning to address Bucky directly. “This has nothing to do with what you’re here for.”
defensively. And then he heard the shower being turned off, and gestured to Zan, one moment. He stood up, and walked just a little closer to the bathroom door before he called out.
“Buck?” He slurred, finding that his jaw was heavier than he’d been expecting. He heard a familiar voice huff softly beside him, and turned his head to see Bucky slumped on a wooden chair, his wrists bound behind him, his torso and legs tied with additional lengths of rope.
“Get out of the building,” Steve confirmed, only slightly breathless. “Contact the team – well, if they aren’t already here,” he commented, glancing at the guards. “We don’t know why the cameras went out.”
Tony’s body jarred to a stop, the air collecting in the top of his lungs. He looked back at Nat, questioningly.
mark the first decision Steve had made purely for himself in nearly a hundred years. Modest though it may have been, it was the first choice that was made on the strength of his own emotions, rather than in blind defiance of them.
Steve felt a little frisson of excitement run through him; he warned himself, in vain, not to get his hopes up…
“Well, today, yes. And, honestly, most likely every day for another week. I’m following the instructions of the top experts in this stuff, and according to them, this is the best way to begin treatment… Which is the best way to make sure you recover quickest,” Tony explains, speaking slowly and carefully, his eyes softened with concern. “...But, if you really hate the idea, I can do a bit of reading up tonight, and speak to Steve, and we can talk about it again tomorrow, when everyone’s here…”
have been much more angry if Steve had chosen to keep any of that from him - he didn’t need the advantage of time travel to know that was true.
“Hey man, you okay?” Bucky asked, casually, as Tony fought his way through those last few feet to him.
But, for the longest time, he’d thought that there was as much about these ideas that he actively didn’t like. Somewhere along the line he’d gotten it into his head that being dominant meant being cold, or degrading, or even cruel. That being submissive would naturally mean accepting humiliation and pain.
Steve pressed his thumbs into the sensitive flesh just below Tony’s hipbones, the sudden jolt of it running along his spine. And then Steve’s hand’s stroking over the curve of Tony’s hips, over his thighs, matching the slow, firm movement of his mouth. Tony moaned, rocking up to meet him, letting that pleasure roll up his back, growing, building,
“No, Tony-” Steve interrupted, sounding almost tearful. “God, I’m so sorry Tony…” But then he shut his mouth and shook his head,
And with that there was a sudden conflict between two very fundamental parts of Tony. The part of him that was so completely devoted to Steve, that crawled towards him in spite of everything else, that already depended on Steve to make everything right and whole again… And the part of him that wanted to make Steve happy.
Tony paused with Bucky’s sandwich still suspended an inch above the plate, an amazed smile growing on his face as Bucky finally broke into an all-out laugh.
Except that Steve didn’t let his hand go, when they got into the corridor…So… Tony didn’t either… And he wasn’t leading Steve up the corridor, or helping keep him upright… They were just… walking, holding hands…
Steve pulled up at Tony’s house just after nine that evening. He cut the engine and turned off his phone, exactly the same as he had the first time they came here. And then he let go of a long, slow breath.
He looked up at the poolside, tears still sparkling on his eyelashes, to see Bucky striding purposefully towards them. He was still grinning when knelt down at the edge of the pool and reached out for Steve’s hand.
“Well, you don’t have to,” Steve tells him, placing a gentle palm on his forearm. “I know that’s not really how it works… But I promise, you’re safe here. And everything
That Steve would have to make choices now, choices that he wasn’t prepared for - choices he would never be able to take back…

“Oh God, I’m close, so close, please,” Tony panted, gripping Steve’s shoulder hard enough to bruise.
As Tony was talking he was walking back towards the door, and Steve just followed him like a puppy. And then Tony took his position, about a foot to the left of the door frame, and gestured to Steve,
Because, yes, the very thought of returning to that bunker was enough to turn his stomach to slime - and that was before he considered actually taking

“You want to go out for dinner?” Tony suggested… And, even in the midst of his own crisis, Steve picked up in the fact that Tony sounded… Nervous? Distracted, maybe? “Or, we could order in, if you like?” Tony added, hurriedly.

the Avengers have an Iron Man suit? I mean, wouldn’t it be better if you and Black Widow and Hawkeye could all fly and fire missiles and stuff?”
“Thank you for agreeing to see us,” his voice was unsettlingly familiar, coming from a total stranger.
Steve swallowed, and let his arms fall to his sides. Oh, he wished he’d had more time to process this. He
“Hey, guys.” Rhodey’s voice snapped them both out of what might’ve been a bottomless moment. They just had time to catch the stoic nod that came from the Varian adults, before they turned to face him. “How’re you feeling? You ready to go?”
...So, maybe Tony would just have to be a grown up and accept that ‘getting over Steve’ wasn’t going to mean that his feelings changed overnight, or any of his hopeless desires disappeared in a puff of smoke.
“So, it’s a privileged, socialite youth I should be picturing, then?” Steve teased, resisting the temptation to stir the rice – Mrs Ken had always been quite adamant that you shouldn’t do that.
He considered the fact that he was always going to care about Steve… which slowly became an acceptance that he might always love Steve. It wasn’t as though Steve had stopped being any of the things that Tony fell in love with in the first place…
Steve was slouched in the corner of one of the couches, his head resting heavily on his fist, his eyes lost somewhere in the middle distance. Not the professional and dignified demeanour he usually tried to maintain, while he was out on company business-

“Tony,” Steve gasped, a pleading edge on his voice, his breathing coming in time with his increasingly frantic movements. Tony could feel the friction of it throbbing through his thighs, the pressure of it building steadily in his hips-
“Oh, lots of reasons,” Tony answered sadly. “There’s a list, actually. I know there is – there was the list from the nights I was mad at you, and the list from the nights I was mad at me. And I really wish I could remember
him that he should be a vampire… Even when Tony was contemplating the consequences of it, or lamenting the unfairness of it, or living with the hatred he still undeniably felt because of it, Tony still didn’t think back to the source of it.
And I’d think about the context, about what you’d be feeling, I’d… try to put myself in your position, rather than just trying to make you see mine. So, I know that’s just… it’s just one thing. I know there’s other stuff we’re going to have to talk about, but
Apparently, it’d been asking too much to just hope he could walk away from this thing. The thing he wanted so badly, that everyone else got to have-
But Tony pulled his arm back anyway, in respect to all those safeguards and assumptions he’d spent two decades building.
Especially as his brief lapse in concentration had been every bit as disastrous as he’d always feared it would be.
“And I’m annoyed at you, as the self appointed head of a team that called me a back stabber, that said you could never trust a Stark, that rolled their eyes at me when I went there to
There was an endless, bottomless moment, in which Tony was just holding onto Steve’s wrist – and Steve was just
, for a start-” Steve stammered, finding it almost impossible to concentrate over the noise in his own brain.
Panting now, Tony managed to shrug his way out of his shirt, clumsily tossing it to the side of the room. And, seeing as he’d apparently remembered how his arms worked, he took the opportunity to snatch frantically at Steve’s T-shirt, clawing it up along his back with far less grace and gentleness than Steve commanded-
He was vaguely aware of Tony breathing a good natured laugh, as he lowered Steve down onto the sheets. He felt Tony pull out of him, and the cool feeling of the air against his thighs. And then… he might’ve lost a second or two, there… before he slowly became aware that the duvet was sticking to his stomach, and his tongue was sticking to the roof of his mouth. That his hair was uncomfortably hot and damp, and his hands were shaking, and face was wet with tears-
And, with that, Tony actually sprang up from the bed, leaping to his feet and instantly beginning to pace-
, is the Royal Airedale Hotel, Westchester,” Nick announced, gesturing to an image that was projected on the back wall. What appeared to be a perfectly ordinary, glass panelled building, with the obligatory row of national flags over the entrance, and no other discerning features at all. “Right now, a double room in this fine establishment will cost you sixteen hundred dollars a night – if you can get one.”
Tony pushed himself up again so that he could move down Steve’s body, peppering urgent little kisses over his chest and stomach, grinning at the frenetic way Steve grabbed at him. He unfastened Steve’s belt, and tugged his pants down over his hips, Steve arching and writhing and doing everything he could to wriggle free of them.
They looked at one another a moment longer, Steve still trying to work out what his next question should be, the Stonekeeper looking as though he was listening politely to Steve’s every thought. And then the Red Skull tilted his head, his lips pursing with sad amusement before he said, “So. How?”
” Bucky called out, his own voice warm with amusement. “It’s good job the Red Skull didn’t have a fucking ball pit, isn’t it-”
He’d have been too scared of what might happen if he put it out there, the unintended consequences it would cause.
“Yeah, sorry - it’s just been a rough couple of days, that’s all,” she sighed, and managed an appeasing smile for him-
had seemed gripped by the overwhelming physical terror that had paralysed Wesley, from the second he regained consciousness…
Steve was so used to enduring these events with a sense of loss and longing and inadequacy. Watching Tony shine so brightly, torn by the conflict of loving Tony so much but hating how that made him feel. Simply taking for granted that he couldn’t have any part of him. Never sure if he longed to be close to Tony, or if he wanted to run from the pain of never being close enough.
“…Hi Tony,” Steve managed eventually. Tony felt an inch of relief as he noted that Steve didn’t sound panicked or injured – that there probably wasn’t an imminent catastrophe for him to deal with.

So, amazingly, there is *still* no smut yet - I know, I'm an unbearable tease (if it helps... there is A LOT of smut in the NEXT update... and thereafter...) HOWEVER, there are some less-than-subtle parallels drawn, so just to be on the safe side, I'm including some more details in the end notes. If you have any triggers, squicks or concerns regarding non-con, or sub/dom, you might want to check that before you read. An excess of caution probably, but better that than too little care.
“No, I’m fine,” Tony hissed, once he’d checked that he hadn’t knocked the Bunsen burner over in his panic.
“Come here,” Tony smiled, curling an arm around Steve’s waist and all but lifting him, so that he could lie Steve out on his back. A delighted giggle bubbled over Steve’s lips, as his weight sank into the softness of the blankets. He spread his arms out, letting his head fall back, enjoying the simple novelty of being sprawled out on the floor like this. He could hear Tony standing, and moving over to the cabinet, a distant background noise to the happy mindlessness he’d fallen into. He let his eyes slip shut, and focused on the pleasant pulsing in the small of his back…
Followed immediately by Peter, who was soaked from his head to his waist, a playful look of determination fixed on his face…
that was the right thing to say. Maybe it fed into that low current of competition and conflict that ran beneath
you help me…” And Steve paused, just to gather his thoughts, still wanting to make sure he said this right even though he wasn’t scared of saying it wrong, anymore…
Arg. He knew he shouldn’t have bothered with this. That Tony would’ve asked for these details, if they’d mattered at all-
“You know, even if we had, I’d still love you. And, if you’d lost your temper and said something you didn’t mean, I wouldn’t hold that against you or let it change how I saw you… not anymore, anyway. And if you really do want to be with me after this, then it probably won’t be perfect all the time – but that’s okay, Steve. You don’t have to live in fear of the next time you make a mistake, or the day I find out that your ideology isn’t absolute, or any of that. Not anymore.”
And, as he took Tony’s hand and led them both from this room, him half dressed and Tony still giggling and both of them just a little unsteady on their feet, Steve began to appreciate what it was not to care.
“C’mere’” Steve murmured, curling his hands over Tony’s hips and pulling him up into his lap. Tony gave a delighted yelp of surprise, that simmered down into a playful giggle as he locked his legs around Steve’s thighs. He exhaled slowly, as he let his back settle against Steve’s chest.
“They’ll find you,” Steve shouted, desperately – already knowing it wouldn’t work. That Stape couldn’t even hear him anymore.
– that Tony hated vampire fetishists, that he didn’t want to make this an ‘intimate thing’, that he’d hate to think of Steve sexualising it like this…
NGL, I'm both excited and nervous about this chapter - partly, because I know this scene was very important to my bidder, and I'm just really hoping I've done it justice for them 🤞🤞🤞
A thousand sparks of white hot pleasure ran over his skin, every muscle tightening towards that sensation, his head suddenly swimming from the abundance of contact-
“...And I don’t know how long I’m supposed to live for,” Steve added, even quieter. “No one knows how long
Siberia, when he’d dreamed about telling Tony the truth, and everything coming out wrong, and Tony hating him for it.
Which wasn’t the same as believing it was true… But, up until now, Tony couldn’t think of a way someone
of a hardship for me, and maybe the blood I could donate would be better… But I can’t use to help like that. So, couldn’t I use it to help you?”
Steve looked at that beautiful face, and realised that he’d never be able to describe it to anyone. Even if he could find words for those perfect golden eyes, if he could have named the thousands of colours in Tony’s hair…  He’d never be able to explain the joy and wit and courage that there was in every expression. He’d never be able to describe the soft warmth that melted in his chest whenever Tony looked at him…
conversation was complicated, really. It was hard to find the words for, and a bit awkward in places… but still, it was nice. He wasn’t uncomfortable, talking like this…
Whether it was fair or not, even if it didn’t fit with any social or moral structure Tony had ever known, no matter how impossible it seemed… The choice in front of him was still the choice in front of him.
He wondered where Steve was right now… The cabin was booked up until the end of the following week, but Tony really couldn’t remember if he’d mentioned that in his letter. He’d
And that sharp, bodily reaction when he realised Steve was in pain… Which part was that? Was it the vampire in him that could
“Up,” he commanded, simply. Steve’s shoulders tensed instantly, his arms scrambling to comply before he’d translated the word. Tony snaked one arm beneath him, lifting into a sitting position in one strong motion. Steve’s stomach dipped, like he was at the crest of a rollercoaster. He was still righting himself when he felt Tony hand curl over his arm, secure and protective-
As embarrassed as he was that he cared, and as anxious as he was that Tony would see that he cared, Steve simply couldn’t ignore his burning need to know. It was as close as he could bring himself to outright asking – and his desperate hope that Tony would answer him was so much greater than his fear that Tony would guess why he was saying this.
“No, that wasn’t the apology Steve – that’s just the headline. I’m not done,” he frowned, almost teasingly… “If ‘I’m sorry for what I did’ was good enough, I
“Varians” He whispered to Tony, gesturing to two small, blue-skinned men in white coats, walking away from them, over to one of the computers… where three more, similarly professional looking Varians were already standing…
This was an old man, his hair cut in a style that hadn’t existed in the forties, his features worn and somehow crueller...
“Sorry,” Bucky muttered, when he caught the questioning look in Tony’s eyes, “I just keep expecting you to laugh maniacally and yell,
“I want you,” Steve breathed, just because he was thinking it. And Tony’s eyes lit up, in a way that excited every nerve in Steve’s body-
And then came the second wave; an awed sense of enlightenment that rolled through him, washing every other thought from his head as he realised…
But, if it was going to get him out of bed, if it was going to get him through this whole thing, he could cut that scene for a minute.
Tony wanted to smile at that. He felt like Bucky deserved a smile for that… But he couldn’t manage it. So, instead, he just nodded,
He didn't think about it. If he'd thought about it, it would've become complicated and confusing - like everything else in his head. He'd have flinched away from it.
obliged to prove himself to the world like that – as unsettling and embarrassing as he found it, in the immediate… Maybe thinking of himself as good enough, for just a moment, had helped him see this.
When he first found out that SHIELD had been infiltrated by Hydra, that his bosses and colleagues and
The first was a tall, broad-shouldered man in a sequined silver jumpsuit and a dazzling red satin cape. His hair was so white it glowed under the light, and swept up into an elaborate style that either reminded Tony of the Court of Versailles or a Mardi Gras float - he couldn’t decide. The man’s skin was pale, and, when Tony looked closely, tinted mint-green
But Tony did just about remember their cover story, as the guide turned around to face them again. He hoped he’d arranged his face into something other than abject horror.
“It’s okay baby,” he reassured, dropping his head to press a tender kiss to Steve’s forehead. “Relax. Let me take care of you.”
obstacles, to even the most mundane or beneficial of projects,” and he even looked quite apologetic when he added, “I know everyone here would have preferred not to have to do things this way. We believe in our work, and if we could’ve gotten the information we needed any other way, we would have. But the fact that we’ve had to resort to… these extremes, doesn’t mean that our goals are sinister.”
His entire body had entered a sort of sensory tunnel vision. Now, he could hear every echo and footfall and electric whirr in that building – and nothing else. He froze, like a tiger watching its prey, cataloguing every minuscule detail before he pounced.
“I can announce your arrival, if you would prefer,” JARVIS suggested amiably, “but your name has been added to the entry list. You no longer require specific permission to enter.”
…Yeah, Steve felt pretty guilty now. He actually stopped pacing and sank into the couch under the weight of it, as he listed all the arguments Tony had made and all the pain Steve had caused him and all the things he hadn’t thought of at the time. It was all pretty awful…

had said it. He’d told Tony exactly why he liked him, and how, and since when… And Tony hadn’t said it back. Tony just said,
, to get your attention in the first place – but when I was working on your arm, that’s really what I was doing. And I really was trying my best to fix the bug, and I really am… basically as qualified as I said I was, to do that – and there really wasn’t a nefarious, alternative plan I was working on, or anything…” he trailed off, crossing his arms awkwardly.
He didn’t even know where that particular thought had come from, other than maybe it was just one of those things he was never allowed to think, taking its turn to stretch its legs along with all the other ugly human impulses.
accurate, purely on his own strength of feelings… he knew he’d not worded it all that well. But, just like his first breakdown, there was truth at the heart of it.
why they must be hurt? What right did he have to demand or expect forgiveness? He’d been taught, from a very early age, to accept and amend his failings stoically, and silently. Like a man.
That first kiss was soft, and chaste – like it really might’ve been a simple New Year’s kiss. Tony felt the same little flutter of excitement in his stomach as he’d always felt whenever Steve touched him. A pure, almost innocent joy in the
“The Master of Ceremonies himself,” The officer replied with professional detachment. “He’s here to collect you.”
And he noticed the fact that Tony was still sitting stiffly. That he was looking slightly downwards, only intermittently meeting his eye…
Then he dropped his head to kiss Steve, softly and sweetly, resisting Steve’s efforts to lean up and kiss him deeper…
“Right, let’s give ourselves as much lead time as we can” Steve started, and took a brief tally of all the other guests in the lobby, and then glanced at the girl at the bottom of the stairs again. “How’re you at pretending to be drunk?”
And then the sudden sensation of air against his skin, and the soft weight of fabric settling against his chest.
of them sparkle,” Tony corrected lightly, moving to look over Steve’s shoulder as he mashed the tomatoes and corned beef together in one of the pans. “Those are the ones with the metallic filings in them – that was theory one…” he trailed off, as he became more and more distracted by the mush Steve was creating. Steve glanced down at it and laughed.
He thought of the first time he made Tony laugh, and the first time Tony kissed him, and the first time Tony drank his blood… Steve thought of all the hopes and fear he’d felt in those moments.
Tony moaned, wrapped his legs tight around him, twisting a fistful of Steve’s hair in a brutal grip as he rocked up into him-
things even, and… My point is, Vodka’s not a truth serum either. I think it just makes you a bit more talkative, like that…”
you for the details?” Steve huffed, trying not to grit his teeth - faintly aware that he was finding it harder than usual to maintain his professional demeanor, but simply putting it down to the mood he was in.
He took his time, kissing all the way along the column of Steve’s throat, from the back of his ear down to the curve of his shoulder. Steve moaned and whined, clawing at him and grinding against him, adding a low roll of friction to all the sensations flooding through him.
? Because I… literally can’t remember if I knew that homosexuality wasn’t a crime by then – I think that’s about as much as I’d worked out. And you had a girlfriend, and I didn’t think you liked men, and I certainly didn’t think you liked
He’d smiled when he walked in, and traded a bit of casual small talk, much more relaxed than he had been just a few weeks earlier… but Tony still felt like there was something. Something Steve wasn’t saying, some other train of thought that he was trying to ignore….
And – although, suddenly, it made Tony slightly uncomfortable to analyse this – when he did, he found that he
“Thank you,” he said again, with forced politeness. At last the agent managed a shy smile, blushing as he nodded a goodbye. And then he shuffled off, awkwardly - already feeling for his phone in his pocket, planning the ‘I met Captain America’ group text that he was going to send.
“Oh, fuck Steve, yes,” Tony moaned, letting his head fall forward as he tried to push back against Steve’s hand.
needed to hear it from me, and you’re right. I know the reason you didn’t think I cared is because you didn’t think I was sorry – and, in fairness, that isn’t the most stupid thing you could think, seeing as I didn’t know how to say it. And I know that, if I’d just said
It didn’t matter anyway. Even if this entirely theoretical bond existed, even if it was something like the random image he’d created from nothing… It was created by the act of
“Your party is here from Terra, I understand? Or, Earth, I should say?” Freddie confirmed, in a softer tone.
you all start another pissing contest, maybe we could talk a little bit about the mission specifics?” Nick suggested, irritably.
Belatedly, he recognised how kind Tony had been to him all evening. How calm and in control he’d been, throughout the whole ordeal. How gently he’d responded to all of Steve’s strange behaviour…

“You’re welcome,” the agent mumbled, as Steve took the case and set it down at his feet. “I, uh, need to ask you to sign for it…” he gestured with the clipboard, like he was waiting for permission.
to feel, something a better person would feel. It allowed him to be a little bit kinder in his assessment of his crime. To acknowledge that, yes, Natasha deserved for him to grieve for her… but to also acknowledge that he wasn’t being cruel or dismissive when he didn’t.
Steve’s resolved flickered, and he hesitated just long enough for Sam to attempt another intervention.

that he related. Hoping that Tony was describing the same things that he was feeling… That Tony was confused but still certain, in the way he was.
A fizzing confusion began to rub through the fog in Steve’s mind. He began actively searching for some sense in what Bucky was saying, trying to form the questions that would help him work out what the hell Bucky was getting at-
“Oh, uh, yeah, thank you,” he nodded… Mainly because he knew that meant that Tony would come back with it…
He felt the twist of hurt, and panic, and anger – the temptation to throw in a dig, the physical resistance to talking about it.
Irritably, he forced himself up from the couch, his neck twinging in protest. His legs felt watery and weak, but that was only because he’d been sitting in the same position since he grew weary of pacing, somewhere around midnight.
was that Tony was miserable. It was the obvious answer to Bucky’s question. The only answer to his question. The trouble was, Steve couldn’t possibly hope to explain it to Bucky without sharing the details of Tony’s trauma… and Steve didn’t feel like he had the permission or the right to do that.

“...No,” he eventually accepted. “No… I mean, if I’m reading this right, it would mean that most of the power is being used by the city…”
My sincere apologies that this update is late - after 20 weeks of making the update schedule, I can't tell you how annoyed I was to have missed this deadline. The honest answer is that, as well as it being Steve's birthday, it was also my birthday - and my family couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery. I lost four days to trying to arrange the one small meet up, and as a result ended up somewhat behind.
. He didn’t want to admit that the fight between them was finished, because if he did then he had to accept everything that he’d lost. He didn’t want to let go of his hurt, because if he did it would be as though it never existed, like it never mattered… Like
“Did you pick this house because of this bed?” Steve wondered aloud, thinking that it would have been a very touching attention to detail-
He’d never been able to do that with ‘the Steve thing’, because that alone had seemed just too ominous. Shapeless. It had simply been ‘a fear’ for his entire life, something he could never find the beginning of, something that had always been just out of the corner of his eye. Something it had been easy enough to put out of mind, for as long as Steve Rogers had been a figure from the past.
And then he saw something snag Steve’s attention, and only then did Tony recognise the noise outside – the crescendo of cheers and whistles and car horns, and the collective shout discernible above the increasing roar-
“Well, even before I knew SHIELD were Hydra, I always knew they were jerks - but it never occurred to me that their jobs shouldn’t exist,” Tony explained, calmly. “And, to be honest, the idea of there being
“So, you know, I’ll have another go at all that when I’m not… recently shot, and everything…” he joked, as a way of winding it up.
And then at last Tony reappeared, slightly flushed and just a little breathless, like he’d taken the stairs at a run.
“So, you want to cultivate these plants on planet Earth, so that people on Earth stop worrying about material things, and are just… happy?” Tony clarified, carefully. And Adam chuckled, warmly.
“I don’t really mean that.” Steve mused. “I mean… When I look at people like Adam, I have that rant in my head – because it’s true, of those people.
“Maybe” Tony shrugged, lowering his eyes as he walked past Steve. “One couple mentioned a sort of, daily catch up thing they have every evening… might be worth going to…”
“Yeah, I keep thinking back to that.” Tony admitted. “And, you know, there are a lot of bigger projects this could potentially lead to.”

“Aw, well, I’m pleased for you both… And, kind of scared for you both…” He pulled off a mock-concerned expression, to take the edge off the sweetness. Tony did his best to frown at him.
” Tony begged, trying to wriggle lower as Steve worked two fingers deeper into him, trying to chase that low, aching pleasure that was starting to roll through him – so good, but, oh, not enough- “Please, please-
“Jesus Steve,” Tony gasped, as Steve jerked into his grip. Tony felt that painful throbbing ease into something more comfortable, and then compulsive, as he ran his hand over Steve. Feeling the weight of him, the
And he thought of Tony’s hands. Tony’s beautiful, clever hands stroking him like this, his eyes locked on Steve’s, his lips full and slightly parted.
So, instead, he tried to quiet his mind entirely, focusing on the rhythmic clanging in the radiators as he drained his mug…
seemed far more relaxed about this – about all of it – since they’d started working with Tony. Steve was quite sure that, if Bucky was still as anxious about sedation as he used to be,
“So, what’s going on?” He asked, when he couldn’t bear the tension any longer. Tony breathed a self-deprecating laugh.
And then he was pulling Tony into him, his lips covering Tony’s, his fingertips pressing into his back-
He knew that he was every bit as nervous of seeing Steve as he was desperate for it. There had been just as many nightmare scenarios as fantasy reunions, in amongst his conflicting thoughts. There was still the anxious, wordless fear of fucking it up, if he
most adorable little double take, his initial shock blooming into a deeper, more astounded look of total disbelief…
“You think I’m mad” Adam observed, casually. “But, really, the only reason you think that is because what I’m telling you falls so far outside of what you already know. You know, human beings invented a communication network that allowed the disenfranchised masses to share their ideas directly, without having to get passed a gatekeeper. Sell their labour directly, without having to impress a corporation or know a network of rich investors. And they fret, in case it ends the bricks and mortar store, and the printed press. Never mind that a system of physical stores and millionaire owned media has, for generations, maintained a system of privilege and patriarchy and capitalism. We
And Steve had to really concentrate, to think what they had scheduled for tomorrow. He only made the effort because he thought it might be
sweet, and a completely different texture to anything he’d ever drunk before. He bit down before he could stop himself, and a sudden burst of it filled his mouth. A low, feral moan escaped him, from deep in his chest, his fingers digging harder into the bag. He swallowed in sharp, almost painful gulps-
idea of what to expect on the other side of the door… who would be there, or what events were about to take place, or even what the general atmosphere might be-
Steve wanted to be a part of Tony’s life. To help him and support him, to learn from him and experience things with him and build something
“I love you, only you,” just fell over Tony’s lips. He didn’t even notice as all of his defensive walls simply...disappeared. He felt so far removed from the person he was yesterday, so completely sure of this instinct - it never once occurred to him to pause. “I’m
part was when Mrs Ames - who was 67 years old, remember - came out from the back and chased the three of them off with a broom.”
“Well, I know you’ve already been given the contact details of our various support staff…” And then he had to stop and swallow hard, visibly gathering himself before he could carry on, “and if there’s ever anything… specific… that you need help with, that you’re not able to talk to most people about-”
thinking of it as ‘the future,’ or panicked over the fact that he’d started thinking of the supplements as ‘blood,’ or at least cringed at himself for critiquing the taste of it…
It was like he’d been halfway through drowning and suddenly worked out that he could float. The physical relief and feeling of revelation, the realisation that everything made sense the second he stopped thrashing against it.
Partly, of course, it was his personal habit of running headfirst into any perceived threat. The very fact that he was nervous irritated him, made him want to
...But, there again, he couldn’t work out why he would be afraid of anything, and he was sure that he usually was.
Tony’s body simmered down immediately, his thighs relaxing and his shoulders falling loose - like they were following Steve’s commands directly. But that need still burned beneath his skin, building at an impossible rate-
And he looked so lost and hopeless and scared that Tony could’ve forgotten everything else entirely, and simply thrown his arms around him-
And Steve still thought Tony had been wrong to blame Bucky, that he was wrong to exclude Bucky – Steve
“I didn’t… know if you wanted – if I…could…” Steve stammered, the tips of his ears actually burning by now, his heart beating so hard that his ribs hurt.
He sat himself up abruptly, and pressed the elevator call button again. The doors slid open immediately.
If Tony had been home, Steve would’ve been drawn to him hours ago. By now, he would’ve been quietly basking in Tony’s company while Tony worked, or holding Tony close against his chest while he played with his hair, or teasing those increasingly frantic whimpers from him as he trailed kisses along the inside of his thighs…
thinking about how not to hurt you, how to keep you out of it, how to protect you from the consequences of it, how to make sure I had everything together when I – I know I made all the wrong choices, and it’s so obvious now and I feel ridiculous saying any of this, and I don’t expect you to believe me, I just…”
The rain clouds had slowly darkened over the course of the day. By the time Steve made it back to his room the horizon had started to flicker with the first warnings of the approaching thunderstorm-
“You’re beautiful,” Steve purred close against his skin, and then sucked another bruising kiss to the curve of Tony’s neck, his hands already sliding up under Tony’s shirt. “You are the most beautiful thing I have ever laid eyes on, perfect, beyond perfect…”
tried to think of everything. And I’ve worked with you for long enough that I should’ve given you that credit. And, it’s not like every safety feature in that suit isn’t there because of a time I
“I promise you, I am yours forever,” Steve said, in a different voice. A lower voice, laden with that unnamed power. Tony could feel it. “I promise that I will make you happy, whatever that takes. That I will keep you safe. That I will love you every minute of every day of the rest of my life…”
Hey all - I'm still unsure if this is the correct fandom etiquette (and do feel free to let me know, if that's the case) But I'm told that subscribers to this fic wouldn't necessarily get a notification if it became a series, and another fic was added...
He’d actually invited Sam over to the house, not once but twice, and had a nice evening on both occasions.
ripped something. But he definitely heard a distinct tear as Tony pulled his own shirt open in one perfunctory tug, sitting up and dropping his shoulders so that Steve could finally push it back over his arms. And then Steve leant up, desperate to kiss Tony again, to feel his skin pressed close against him-
Up until that point, he’d been lying in a state of dazed happiness, his mind completely silent and his limbs still throbbing with satisfaction. Tony was lying against his chest, sighing softly as Steve played with his hair, a constant source of amazement and comfort that Steve didn’t have to think to name. It was simply everything, and it was good…
There was a strangely compelling curl of interest in Steve gut. The sort of discomfort you wanted to pick at rather than avoid…
it all, now - all those butterflies he’d been ignoring, that rosy affection that coloured everything he was looking at, the swell of security and comfort that was simply being with him…
And, he pointed to one of the data points, and the strange, half-hieroglyphic-half-recognisable-chemical-formula label written next to it…
The end of the first Avengers Christmas Party, when Tony had thrown himself into the couch next to Steve and made some self-deprecating joke… That watery feeling that spread through Steve’s stomach as he recognised how unguarded Tony was in that moment - that it was probably the first easy moment between them…
Steve had the same posture, he held the knife the same way, he’d inflicted the exact same wound on himself.
Bulsara - when you see what this festival has to offer - you’ll understand that it’s an opportunity you would never have declined. No one would.”
And the hardest part about it was having to put enough distance between them to get their clothes off in the first place-
And then there was the separate part of him that belonged in the real world, growing ever more aware of the problems on the horizon - the part of him that only knew sensible, human coping mechanisms. The part that warned him to brace, temper his expectations, start planning for the fall out…

But he forced himself to do a quick scan of the room – which was, as Zan had promised, very dark. It took his eyes a few seconds to adjust, enough to make out a large, rectangular room, with a grand marble bar running all the way around it. The staff behind it were all distorted into shadows by the very faint light that seemed to come from the floor beneath them. The rest of the room was dotted with various over-sized couches and semi-concealed booths, each with little side tables, on which a tiny lamp glowed very softly… and, in most cases, stacks of glasses stood next to a collection of sex toys, or tubes of lube…
” Steve murmured, like he was talking to himself. Still, Tony felt it curl in the pit of his stomach, his cock pulsing sharply under the power of it-
He was so scared of what might be on the other side of that door, so sure he already knew … for a second it seemed obvious that he should try to avoid that pain. A basic survival instinct, almost.
“Yeah, my bad – Tony called the office for you yesterday, and it’s very important you call him back,” Bucky winced. And Steve actually broke into a grin for just a fraction of a second – and he was beyond caring if anyone had seen it.
That had been a distant hypothetical, up until now. A vague warning of what could happen if he didn’t fix this thing – something he’d flinched away from, because he’d been so determined to avoid it.
He saw Steve take a sharp breath, a nervous excitement flashing up in his eyes. Tony caressed his palm up along Steve’s neck, until he was cradling the side of his face. He could feel the anticipation building in Steve’s shoulders…
“Yeah, me too,” Steve soothed, pulling Tony close again so that he could kiss his forehead. His stomach dipped pleasantly when he heard Tony hum a smile in response - but, of course, it couldn’t last. That cool discomfort began to gather again, even before he could ask, “so, why on earth would you want to say yes to that?”
He stepped aside, and in strolled a handsome blonde man with broad shoulders and piercing blue eyes. He was wearing a fitted waistcoat over his tastefully sheer black shirt, and pants that probably weren’t considered too tight, on Bulsara….
Steve stopped, watching anxiously as the punching bag rocked violently against its restraints, feeling strangely distant from the pounding of his heart or the burning in his lungs. For a few seconds, the only thought in his head was,
It was different to thinking he knew it, a few minutes earlier. This wasn’t the slightly anxious awareness of a power imbalance; this was how it
“Okay, then… We need to start with everything you know about that bunker, and those super soldiers… And…” The focused expression flickered briefly, his bottom lip pulling between his teeth as he considered his next question. “And we’re going to have to work out what we’re going to do about them. I mean, if we’re going to try to arrest them, or…”
, even when I was so angry at you and so hurt and so confused, I always knew I loved you. That I was still
Suddenly, all the big, existential questions just crumbled into irrelevance. Tony was immediately overwhelmed by the very simple, very
“You know what, let’s dispense with all the cute metaphors and the role playing, shall we?” Steve suggested, darkening his voice as he stepped forward to tower over Nick. His blood flashed hot when he saw the instinctive way Nick curled in on himself.
“I love you too,” Tony smiled. His hand fell back into Steve’s hair, resuming that soothing caress as Steve’s breathing slowed. “Did you have a good birthday?”
Steve liking it… Not because Tony was a vampire, or in spite of Tony being a vampire… Just liking it…
, like that. I mean, I know that doesn’t excuse the ‘rattling around the mansion’ line, or whatever it was – honestly, I wrote so many versions of that letter I can’t remember what stayed in-”
But he was pretty sure he couldn’t say that. So he scrambled for the first thought he could put into words-
“No, but I… I shouldn’t have… That was… really selfish, I’m sorry…” Tony muttered, looking down. “And you are…just…
It pushed him to suck weakly against Steve’s skin, to swallow that little mouthful despite the pain in his throat…
at 27, if he was forced to spend anytime with him - but he stopped himself before he could conclude that obviously he wouldn’t.
His stomach twisted painfully. His mouth watered. His vision seemed to cloud at the edges and focus on the colour in front of him.
he’d been that he’d held Steve to a different standard to everyone else, that Steve hadn’t deserved such harsh treatment simply because Tony had fallen in love with him.
, while under the influence of an infinity stone, and a super villain who went on to be your best friend, while panicking about the need for a defence that I was totally right we needed, by the way – for that day, I’d kept that from you, and I felt terrible. And I apologised, and I apologised – and you stood there and let me. You lectured me about keeping secrets and not being a team player –
And there was that growing, giddy excitement at the idea that Steve was literally pretending to be his boyfriend right now, that they were supposed to be-
understand the hurt he’d caused Tony. Maybe Tony just had to be honest, and vulnerable, and set aside those hard-learned defences, before Steve could do the same. Maybe Steve had just needed that guidance, whatever form it came in…
He was so overwhelmed that he forgot all about the poor hotel employee, still standing in polite silence, eyes lowered, awaiting some sort of instruction. Tony was too focused on the idea that, maybe, somehow, while on the run and off the grid, Steve had managed to send him flowers for his birthday…
“Good luck,” Bruce whispered, as the three of them strolled towards the entrance of the marquee, faking as much nonchalance as they could.
For the first time, he tries to make sense of his surroundings, looking around him and trying to find names for things…
he should probably go and investigate that, at least. He could at least make himself read some labels, in the name of the mission…
Bucky still had only the vaguest grasp of what Steve and Tony did all day - although, from the aggressive phone calls they made in the evenings, and the sorts of appointments they made, Bucky got the impression that it was something very important. To be honest, he’d only recently gathered enough capacity to be curious about it, and even then, only in a distant sort of way…
Tony had to physically swallow the emotion that rose up in him then. Excitement and delight and just… a flood of
All that analysis and consideration and literal bending of the time space continuum, all so he could end up hiding away in the shower with his anxieties.
And then he pressed a tender kiss to Steve’s neck, the tip of his tongue tracing over the vein before he let his teeth rest against Steve’s skin. Steve felt the blood surge to meet him, a heat flooding up through his chest, an ache building as his heart pumped faster than his body could contain it-
Suddenly, the crisis that had just been so all consuming faded entirely. Steve completely forgot about the kit he was holding – it was total fluke that it didn’t fall from his hand.
“...And maybe it’ll feel better when I get used to it,” he carried on, over the top of another elated roar from the crowd. “...Maybe I should just avoid him completely for a while, move out of the compound again-”
He was delighted, maybe even a little bit relieved, to be able to have such a natural and diverting conversation with
And then, begrudgingly, he kicked his brain into gear. Resolving to deal with this catastrophe, like someone rolling their sleeves up in anticipation of a new day at the office…
There had been a nagging temptation to look for Tony on his trip to Camp Lehigh, which Steve had just flat-out refused to think about. He suspected that there would be a similar stirring when it came time to replace the Soul Stone, and when he went back to 2012.
He hated that Tony was right about all of that. He still hated anything that slipped away from his control - as hard as he was trying to get over it. The very idea of having to rework the plan from that far back was nauseating before he even bothered to think about it.
, at least…” And he held Tony’s eye for a second, just to remove any shred of doubt that they were talking about Steve. “So, the thing is, it really doesn’t matter if you’re right, and they’re going to be at all sorts of risks because of you – they already are. The only question is whether you can make it any easier on them. If that’s what you’re really thinking of doing, when you push them away…”
“I’m sure, for some of my employers, it has,” Stape sighed. “I work in medicine; I accept that reality. Every aids researcher and cancer specialist is backed by someone who wants to get rich off of their discoveries. Every drug company is made up of medical men and marketing men. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t pure motives in there. And it doesn’t mean that the discoveries aren’t worth making, just because
Steve considered simply ignoring her - he was long past any feeling of sympathy or connection to her, and, honestly, he quite liked the thought of it…
make him feel better. That it might not mean anything to Steve, or between the two of them – but that it might help Tony get this out of his system. Let him stop doing it in front of the mirror, or in his own head when he was trying to get to sleep… that it might in some way help him to let go, move on. That this might be one step towards the sad compromise he’d only just recognised, and bitterly accepted…
So, the only way Steve could play this now was to do exactly that, and hope to God that it was the ‘right’ answer.
. The tension melted from his back in an instant, as though he’d been drugged. The frightening thoughts he’d tried so hard to silence suddenly just… weren’t there. And then Tony smiled at him, warm and kind – and
He could tell from the way the CEOs eyes had widened, the way the politico was glancing around for an excuse to shuffle away-
What if Steve Rogers at forty, having lived through these particular events, had nothing in common with a twenty seven year old Natasha Romonoff, who hadn’t?
So, Tony had just waved him off, and finally started to tidy the workshop – purely for the sake of something to do with his hands while his mind ran away from him.
Which was on top of the fizzing, electric sensitivity, running all the way to the tips of his fingers now-
end up wanting to stay a little longer, you should ask them – they actually really like people to stay. They’re like, super-proud.”
Or he’d think back being swept up in Steve’s arms, Steve whispering that everything was okay, that Tony wasn’t a monster – that he knew Tony had a soul. Tony would feel that sense of assurance and validation all over again… and then feel it stretch even further, melting ever deeper into all his anxieties, as he remembered everything that had happened since…
“Okay,” Tony surrendered, “get as far away as you can before you start yelling,” and then he turned his attention to Bucky, “when we hear him shout, we go for it.”
started to soften. Her entire affect was just a little less sure, as though maybe her fury was finally burning out-
him. If Tony judged Steve by the same criteria as he did anyone else, then he could clearly accept an apology and lessons learned as enough for Steve to be welcomed onto the team again, for Tony to move on from what happened. The fact that Steve loved him, and the fact that Tony knew it now, didn’t
He’d taken three of them down before Tony had a chance to move - still radiating that cold authority, so certain and deliberate in his movements…
kind of thought that faithfulness was a question of intention rather than action. That the point was finding someone who didn’t
...And Steve wasn’t any of the people he was really angry at, or afraid of. He was just the person who had told Tony about them…
An impulse he mistook for ‘remembering what Captain America would do’… That was a mistake Steve had been making for years now. Crediting a brand image with all the better qualities in himself, all the choices it cost him so much to make, all the things he’d known since long before he took the serum.
Steve Rogers was a different man to the one that left 2023 - or even the one who arrived here six months ago.
don’t get to tell me to handle my pain better, or get over it quicker. You became a serial killer when the people you loved died, so you can shut up about this not being okay. Like losing my temper at a BBQ is beneath my dignity -
But there was no denying he was greatly reassured by all of that - which was probably the first positive thought that had crossed his mind since Steve left.
with the world. I always thought there would be people who were okay with the vampire thing. You know I did. And even if it only makes you rethink that much… Seriously, I think it’d be worth the sleepless night.”
He sighed, and straightened the items on his desk for the third time. He felt himself blushing, all alone at his desk, as he acknowledged the adrenaline that had been flooding through him since this time last week. The abundance of energy that he just
“No, I don’t,” he corrected, with such heartfelt confidence. “All I am right now is worried about you.”
So, there is smut in this chapter, I swear - you just have to read through like 9k of introspection and character examination to get to it. ahem. BUT, when we get there, the standard warnings apply - there is a drug being pumped into the air in this place, and their interactions are perhaps a bit more intense and emotional because of that, so there is arguably that dub-con element. HOWEVER, i really don't think any further end notes apply on this one... but, if anyone would like further details, or would like to make suggestions for further warnings, please just let me know
“It’s not-” Steve had to cut him off. And then he sighed. “It’s not that. It’s not me struggling to deal with the 21st Century or some side effect of being frozen, or me not coping with what’s happened to me…”
have access to all those resources,” Steve added, like he was playing along, “so it won’t matter nearly as much if we take down SHIELD before the aliens arrive. We won’t need them to help us.”
… Like he was looking at a well-known scene and the light had shifted. Something that seemed to change everything even though he had no idea what had changed…
Invariable number one - he loved Steve, and he wanted to be with Steve, and he wanted to make Steve happy. Tony was, for whatever reason, entirely sure that all of that was genuine, and reasonable, and real. And, okay, he didn’t know if he could actually

… thing, more like the relationship between a Doctor and a patient? Something that was fine, in and of itself, and could even possibly be friendly… But couldn’t involve sex, or romance, or personal bonds of trust…
Steve could still recall the stranger impulses with alarming clarity - but he didn’t actually feel them any more. However intense and tumultuous his feelings right now, they were undeniably different to whatever happened to him last night. This was, as Tony might say, Steve’s regular brain working in the real world…
And Tony realised that, more than anything he’d wanted from Steve – and, okay, there were a lot of things he’d wanted from Steve, over the years… But more than anything, he’d just wanted this. A moment that wasn’t ‘about’ anything, that wasn’t compromised by, or effected by, or intended to rectify, any of their issues. A moment that he didn’t have to make the most of, or put into context, or try not to get carried away with. A moment when Steve would just hold him, and kiss him, because Tony was his and because he wanted to and because they
“Um, I don’t know – Cherry, probably” He shrugged, pulling the answer from nowhere. Belle smiled, and raised a finger –
“No, nothing like that,” Steve assured him. “It’s just… I had to meet with the legal people today, about the Maximoff twins. And it was deeply irritating. That’s all.”

PLEASE BE AWARE that there is an element of the unreliable narrator, especially with regards to the final scene. What really happened there, and what it really means, will all be explored later on I promise!
All at once, Steve was angry over everything that had happened to him, all over again. He found himself reliving that bitter sense of injustice that he should be so alone and lost and miserable-
Steve felt that giddiness in his stomach break out into full on butterflies, as he tilted his head as carefully as he could-
Of course, they both took the friendly hint, and went over to their now-familiar places by Tony’s examination table. And, by the time Tony had picked up his tools, Steve’s mind had drifted back to his now-familiar train of thought.
rather than slow, inching his way down along Steve’s body, running the flat of his tongue roughly over every inch of Steve’s skin, teasing over the sensitive spots with soft kisses, tracing the tip of his tongue over the fault lines between his muscles-
Steve groaned softly, and let his head fall back… His neck ached in a muted protest, and he realised he’d been sitting in the same position for far too long. He decided he would take a break before he began an entirely new mental challenge. He’d go and get something to eat before he confronted his strange new obsession with Stark.
as that trembling was threatening to break through Steve’s control, Tony sat up and pulled Steve hard against his chest, so that he could whisper close,

...And it had grown with every little detail Tony found to like about Steve, every pleasant moment they’d shared together, every small kindness they’d traded - all the things that Tony was quite sure he loved about Steve, vampire-mind-powers or no. He was
For it not to mean the end of a bitter feud, or the resolution of a deep personal issue, or the moment a dream came true… it almost meant as much, for this to mean nothing more than this.
“Oh God Steve, I love you, you are… Jesus Christ, that was…” Tony panted, his head still bowed under the weight of his relief.
But Steve could tell from the way that Tony’s shoulders slumped, it was going to be a little while longer at least.
feeling… now that Tony thought about it, this was the feeling that had soaked into him as he’d taken Steve into his arms
And that, of course, was an appalling choice of words. But heaven help him, it was the best he could do. And Tony just nodded, stoically, and looked away.
He strolled out of the room, looking exactly as casual as someone trying to look casual. He saw Steve take a steadying little breath, the same as he might’ve walking into a battle, and Tony still wasn’t sure whether he sympathised with Steve’s situation or resented being treated like a challenge to be overcome…
Just the feeling of Tony moving inside him, the friction under his skin, the glorious contentment of it – just that.
“Yeah, sure,” Steve shrugged, still beaming at the prospect. And then he glanced towards the kitchen, “I mean, uh, I’ve been trying to lie low, so I don’t have much in-”
“Do you think there’s any way this goes better if we report it back right now?” Steve was the one to say it.
In the instant, Asgard just felt less daunting - and, with no one else to answer to, Steve decided to go with that.
“Yeah, sounds exhilarating.” Steve replied sarcastically. And then he glanced down at his shirt. “Although I should probably shower and change first… I’ve been wearing this a really long time…”
And that both he and Steve had been slowly stepping forward. That, if he wanted to, Tony could reach out now and put his hands on Steve’s arms… maybe take that last step and-
“Thank you,” Steve whispered again, subconsciously gathering the robe against his chest. When he glanced up, he saw Tony beaming with a selfless joy at how much Steve liked his gift - and he loved him for it.
And, obviously, the letters contained no objective information about what it meant to be bonded – it didn’t neatly outline the criteria or describe any sort of ceremony or explain how that arrangement was met between them, or anything
long for some sort of comfort, any kind of reprieve, and maybe even resented the fact that he never got to have it... sometimes… just a little…
sorry, and I hope you make your peace with it and everything, but… You can’t use me to do that. You can’t say all of those things to
And that was before any of the other, day-to-day anxieties fully hit him. Steve had only just realised that they’d not even talked about… what happened, yet-
“And then a few years later I was an enhanced super soldier with PTSD, in the year 2011 – so then I pretty much
“So, who’s my SHIELD allocated love interest going to be?” Tony challenged with mock joviality, his eyes firmly locked on Nick. Steve cast a furtive glance in Natasha’s direction, an unclean feeling already gathering on his skin.
“Well, that’s mostly luck,” Tony huffed. “I’m not really sure what the hell I’m talking about, right now.”
He was on the top floor of the Tower, which, at least for the time being, was still his suite. He had all the papers drawn up to put the building on the market – some of which he’d even gotten as far as signing, before the whole thing became too fucking tragic for him. Maybe next week he’d finally give it up and hand them over to Pepper. New year, new start, and all that…
Steve glanced over his shoulder to see Tony strolling away from the villa, a glass in each hand. Steve’s contented smile broke into a broad grin, as he ran his eyes over Tony’s body…
It lingered longer, this time. Without an immediate task to push ahead to, Steve found himself getting snagged on those particular memories. There was finally room for a few actual thoughts to speak up-
Steve’s breathing took on a pleading tone, his hips rocking down against Tony’s mouth again - rutting up into nothing.
“So, if you need anything else at all, just ask any member of our team” She concluded cheerfully from the doorway. “Just to remind you, we don’t tolerate the use of any drugs that weren’t dispensed by Facility staff. But you’ll find a wide range of substances available from the bars and kiosks, and we’ll be happy to advise you on their use and side effects.”
Belatedly, Steve recognised that Tony was trying to undress him. The very last of his cognitive powers made a truly valiant attempt to pull together at this point, waving for Steve’s attention through the haze of lust-
“Give it a minute,” Figaro assured him. “Take a step back, clear your mind, have a good look at the flowers - you’ll see.”
that Rhodey was innocent of a crime, and thought he had no hope of a fair hearing… If Steve had gone after Rhodey in that sort of temper…
“I love you,” Tony smiled back, his voice warm and rich and kind… And soft… growing softer… “It’s okay baby. Close your eyes.”
He broke the kiss with a soft gasp, his arms suddenly throwing themselves around Steve’s neck with no input whatsoever from his head.
means I should probably finish up with the plans for the Cryo Chamber, if we don’t want to be waiting on that…” He gestured towards the living room. Steve gave a resigned nod.
“I think your rice is ready,” Tony muttered. Steve snapped to look at it – he’d completely forgotten he was cooking for a moment there, and it was total fluke that nothing had caught fire. Thankfully it looked as though he’d been reminded at the right moment, and Steve could pretend to be cool about taking it off the heat, and subtly testing the gently bubbling sauce…
Even as his cock began to weep sharply against the sheets, even as his entire body began to ache, still, Steve enjoyed enduring this-
Tony’s cock throbbed petulantly – but he ignored it. Instead, he reached up and grabbed the bottle of lube that was waiting on the bedside table. He was already undressed, wrapped in the thick black bathrobe that Steve had bought for him because he’d once casually mentioned that he preferred the feel of cotton to silk. Tony let his legs fall apart as he wet his fingers, thinking of Steve’s hands braced hard against his thighs, spreading him open…
” Steve saw the way Tony’s attention kept catching on the collar, he could feel the intention coiled in Tony’s muscles as he writhed against him-
“Other side of the paper” He explained, gesturing to whatever he could see on the back it. Tony flipped the page.
I sincerely promise not to keep adding chapters of extras to this fic - if there is any more artwork etc to be added later, I'll edit this final chapter to include it.
He swallowed, and glanced away. And then, purely to take the edge off, he added, “no, the letter was
...Not to think about the fact that Tony had never shared that detail with him, in the first timeline.
brave, and kind, and loving, and possessed of an innate desire to do good, to do better – a desire that had been there even before he was Iron Man. Tony Stark had always been that person, or else the ordeal he’d been through in Afghanistan would’ve broken him. Open heart surgery in a cave can’t bring out qualities that weren’t in there anyway. That creativity. That determination. That indomitability.
when actually what I wanted to say was sorry… And yeah, I’m starting to think that might not be as fun as it sounds…”
Well, if there was, then it was going to take Steve more than a few minutes to figure it out - and Tony was waiting for an answer now.
“It’s just… I never saw him scream, or cry, or act out when we were kids,” Steve started, not even sure where the words were coming from. “He was just one of those… Brave kids, you know, and-”
that every one of those seemingly small operations had ramifications for the wider plan, that every interaction was a potential benefit or a chance to get caught out - that’s why he hadn’t thought about it. Because he’d been concentrating on getting those things done… Because he’d trusted the plan he walked in with.
“I’m glad you didn’t kill him,” Tony began, attempting a light tone of voice. Steve blinked in confusion, and Tony rushed to explain, “Bucky seemed to think you were going to murder him, the last time he was here...”
There was a distinctly defiant edge on Tony’s brow now, like he wasn’t waiting for an answer so much as challenging Steve to find one.
And he would’ve turned and stormed out of the workshop there and then, without so much as a backwards glance…
Steve would’ve preferred it if Tony had said that he loved him, or said that he wanted it to happen again, or even that he’d like to keep seeing Steve, just see how it went.
Steve swung around as he said it - turning just in time to see Tony’s carefree expression freeze in shock at Steve’s outburst.
“Well, honestly, it’s all just good news,” Tony announced with a tempered sort of optimism, as he waved a hologram into life. “All of the results so far put you way ahead of where you were the last time around.”
Unfortunately, Tony could already feel his phone vibrating in his pocket, so he knew he wouldn’t have time to process exactly why that was so fucking annoying-
“Oh-God-yes-please-yes,” Steve babbled, one hand flying to the back of Tony’s head, stroking in time with Tony’s short, sharp motions. Tony let both palms slide up along Steve’s legs, indulging himself in the dense muscle of Steve’s thighs as he sucked him, roughly. He could feel Steve’s cock throb fuller and thicker against his lips, the bitter taste of pre-come coating Tony’s tongue. “Jesus, Tony,
“I’m calling from the Stark Industries Security Board, Clearance Code 13354, Reporting directly to Miss Potts, colour of the day is Indigo,” he rattled off impatiently, “We need to know the location of Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes – the internal system just has them down as attending an ‘external comms meeting’”
” Tony barked, digging his fingers into Steve’s shoulder, burying his hips into him, his voice breaking down into an animal roar as he came.
Which meant he should probably plan some sort of deflection, for when one of them made a sober attempt to bring this up later-
is a human construct, meaningless here. Consider – none of the substances you take here are harmful, in anyway. You can’t overdose, you won’t have flashbacks, there won’t be long term damage to your heart or lungs. No one has ever had a bad trip. You won’t
And he paused to look at Rhodey, and waited for Rhodey to nod a reluctant acknowledgment. Tony didn’t like to think about how many people had targeted Rhodey, spied on Rhodey, attempted to blackmail or bribe or intimidate Rhodey, all because they wanted to get access to
Really, this should be the easy part. After twenty pages of dry research data, this section of the folder at least had
He almost felt obliged to be happy in this relationship, rather than be that person. Which was also ridiculous, he knew. But he couldn’t help thinking he
… okay, so, you remember he was talking about the drugs we could take if we wanted to combat the natural effect of the atmosphere?”
“And then I kissed you back,” Steve reminded him, bringing one hand to the side of Tony’s face, gently tilting his head up-
That he really shouldn’t give an opinion yet - no matter how strongly he believed in it, no matter how deeply he
But he’d not fixed this thing, and he couldn’t fix this thing now – Steve was going to call him, and say everything was done, and if Tony hadn’t been able to tell him no before, he was never going to manage it after-
Because right now he knew that Steve needed him in this room. Steve needed him to take control of a situation that Tony had needed Steve to make safe.
how it felt to be high. He noted that possibility. But he just couldn’t unsee this – he couldn’t fathom how’d he’d
Whatever this was, Tony actually felt a physical urge to flinch from it – the same primal reaction people have to spiders and wounds. He very nearly threw his hands up, the words ‘
Until now, he’d never considered that he might want both things in his life. Or that he was even allowed to want both things in life.
Steve came with a wordless shout, pulling Tony’s hair into a fist as his hips snapped up against his mouth. Tony swallowed hungrily, sucking against Steve’s skin as the aftershocks shuddered through him, dragging that sensation up from the bottom of Steve’s spine.
Steve felt a stab of hurt as soon as he saw that Tony wasn’t going to speak immediately – a cold ache that grew so quickly, in the few seconds of silence.
Steve’s chest seized as he opened the text, every muscle tensing in general preparation - and then he read the message.
The shift in Tony’s level of awareness was so sudden and so intense that it was physically disorienting, like snapping out of a trance. Out of nowhere, his previously sleepy body was tingling with panic, and his once calm mind was alive with hysterical thoughts-
night of his life, and he’d still been confused and uncomfortable at times, but, on balance, he’d had a pretty good night. Certainly better than he would have brooding quietly in his room.
clearly scared of the Avengers - and Steve especially - Wesley was still obviously reluctant to answer their questions. He wasn’t eagerly offering any scrap of information, which would be the natural reaction if Wesley was just trying to get the two of them out of his house.
of the moment; not defined by the past, or obliged to fret about the future, or fundamentally separate from everyone around him.
And then he got to draining the last drops, his hand closing into a fist as he swallowed that final mouthful. And then he finally let the bag drop to his side, his head falling heavily in front of him
Steve, those flawless blue eyes wide and shining, looking at Tony with such intensity – such naked, unashamed desire. Tony could feel the desperation coiling in Steve’s muscles, he could see every tiny little movement that Steve was struggling so valiantly to contain.
feel the same, if Tony still wanted to be with other people, it wouldn’t change what Steve had just discovered.
“Anyway, I should probably let you get to your meeting,” he announced more forcefully, looking away. Steve swallowed, and tried to hide the way he deflated.
Steve clenched his jaw. He knew it would only add to this violent, painful fury, if he had to sit here and listen to this…
When he watched Tony work, Steve wasn’t looking for mistakes or oversights. He was just watching Tony’s hands. Beautiful hands, fast and delicate…like an artist…
“I always had trouble with that. I don’t know if it’s… A forties thing, or a Captain America thing, or… I just always found myself asking,
I mean – do The Accords have anything about this? I don’t remember anything that would even remotely relate to this –
“Uh, well, one has a really advanced environmental analysis system, but the actual ergonomics are shot. One has an almost fully functioning bio-interface – but nothing below the waist.” Tony summarised, feeling a warmth surge through him when Steve laughed.
“Somewhere to lock them up, some way to get them off the planet entirely – some way to knock them out safely, and somewhere to leave them, if there’s nothing else.” Steve suggested.
“I don’t need to have a drink to think you’re beautiful,” Steve assured. “I need to have a drink before I think your Star Wars theories are interesting-”
“You’ve suddenly gone really red,” Steve replied in a worried tone of voice, taking a few steps closer, like he was trying to get a better look.
just leave now. They had the information they’d gone undercover to find; they knew what The Facility was, now. They could just report this back – to the Avengers, to the global authorities, to a separate team like the one they had in Wakanda… any number of people who would help them bring this place down. At least if they did that, he and Steve would be at less risk. Arguably, a whole team or Avengers had more chance of stopping ‘Adam’ than just the two of them. And of course, there was the argument of transparency and accountability – their responsibility to follow the protocols, which almost certainly demanded they report something like this back…
As Steve stood there and let it run through his head one last time, he realised - he hadn’t paused because he was unsure, or frightened, or because he’d needed to think it all through. He’d stopped for a moment to
a way to upload the virus from there… and another part of me thinks we’ll just end up getting caught, and for no reason, when it turns out that base isn’t connected to the system anyway.” Tony shrugged.
And then, at last, he finished soldering the final panel back into place. He put down his tools and looked over at Bucky’s monitor, checking all of his vital signs. And, as Tony satisfied himself that everything was correct and complete and as it should be, he felt that tension running up his back again…
The fact that so many of the people who went to The Facility were never seen again – but never reported missing.
He clawed his way into Steve’s embrace, his fingertips bunching the material of his shirt as he pulled closer, kissing him back every bit as hungrily-

this Tony Stark thing had gone beyond being boring for Bucky and well into being embarrassing for him. He even knew what Bucky was going to say back. But… it was driving him mad. Steve didn’t know
“Beautiful…” Tony murmured, sliding his fingers under the waistband of Steve’s boxers and peeling them down over his hips, somewhat begrudgingly leaning further away so that he could push them over Steve’s thighs. Steve gasped, arcing his back and writhing further up the bed, his fingers flexing impatiently against the sheets. Tony smiled, appreciatively.
that we can buy art direct from the creators, without having to pay a company to introduce us. In case a handful of privileged pop stars will no longer get to become millionaires, while their record company rakes in billions. We lament the fact that we no longer cut down trees to print physical books, which can’t be read by anyone with a vision impairment or a learning difficulty. We aim to preserve that past, because otherwise,
by him, he noted. A few of the administrative staff had seemed slightly nervous of his mood, but only in a perfectly normal way. Nat hadn’t been remotely frightened of him.
“Tony, I can’t – that’s my line” Steve snapped, looking away again. “And, if it’s your line too, then fine, we can just go, and think of something else. But I just can’t… take that responsibility, I don’t… I don’t know, I can do it the other way around, and I still want to do this, I still know that it’s important, but… I mean, I

“Yeah, sure,” Steve nodded, “thanks.” He was glad when Tony turned away again to pour it. It gave him a moment to shuffle awkwardly to the couch and to
And then Steve broke into that sweet, sincere smile that Tony would know anywhere - but still, he could hardly
Steve knew he should’ve spent more time interrogating Bucky over it. That he should have made more effort to prise from him the actual words, the real meaning – the response from Tony. Instead of which, he’d settled for telling Bucky that he
But Tony took a step closer to him. He met Steve’s eye with as focussed an expression as he could manage, and he asked.
“...Why?” Rhodey asked. Tony just shrugged. And then Rhodey threw a casual glance around the rest of the room, “hey.”
Bucky had said it as though he was cautiously optimistic that the answer might be yes. And, beyond that underlying frisson of hope, he’d seemed quite casual about the question-
know – which is that Tony thinks of us both as friends, and that he’d be quite happy to see either of us, without it having anything to do with his ‘lifestyle’.”
“The initial biological scans have completed, sir,” JARVIS informed him, “If you would like to initiate the neurological scans.”
And Tony thought he’d have known Steve was lying right now – at the very least, he’d have known he was uncomfortable saying this. But Zan didn’t. Unless Zan was a better actor than even Natasha, Zan believed him… Which, Tony realised, didn’t really have anything to do with how good a liar Steve was… As long as he was basically
Tony frowned, and pushed the idea away. There were far too many thoughts competing for his attention at the moment, without letting himself get carried away with silly notions like that.

him to do it, Tony had said no. And, strange and confusing though his impulse had been at the time, Tony was sure that a desire to protect Steve was at the heart of it. An understanding that Steve wasn’t ready, that it wouldn’t be good for him… and that was all that mattered.
“I can, but a basic search of those keywords has returned over seventeen million results. You may wish to refine your search, or define a way to prioritise the results,” JARVIS suggested - although Tony had already worked out that he’d need to be more specific…
“You think you know what it might be?” Steve’s voice broke Tony out of his thoughts. There was such a sweet sincerity in his tone, a softness that Tony responded to before he could stop himself. He
