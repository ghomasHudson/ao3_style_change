“I'll, uh, I'll call you tomorrow, okay? I promise it won't be ages before we do the whole date thing.”
Peter shrugs. Steve suppresses a sigh (he really should’ve expected that a four-year-old probably wouldn’t know their dietary restrictions) and sends a text to Tony; the reply text merely has a bee emoji. That’s it, nothing else. Just an emoji. Steve chuckles before grabbing a delivery menu and moving to sit beside Peter.
… … … …
“You stop, and I’ll kick your ass.”
“Don't know what you're talking about. Nobody to talk to, nothing to talk about.”
“Tony, wake up.
“Tony,
“How the Hell am I supposed to ask Thor for something like this?” he sighs. “Can’t you do it for me, J?”
“Yeah, you’re right.”
He barely sees when Tony holds the door open, beckons him inside, or when the maître d’ greets them. It's only because of Tony's hand on his lower back that Steve even moves in the right direction; the warm pressure through his shirts is reassuring, comforting, and his breathing slowly becomes less restricted. Steve smiles at Tony, a small thing, but Tony understands, his fingers pressing slightly harder in response. Steve turns back toward the table that they're guided to and immediately bursts out into surprised laughter.
“Where’s Steve?”
“You wanted to actually carry,” supplies Nat, cutting to the point with ease immediately – as usual.
“I wish you'd told me sooner, Tony. I wish I'd seen how much my relationship with Delilah was hurting you. I never meant to cause you any kind of pain.”
“Oh, c’mon, Steve. It’s been a very, very,
It's far more than Steve ever expected for his life. It's had its ups and downs, far too many downs, that he never dared dream for a family beyond what he used to have. But he'll always have his Ma and Peggy and the Commandos, and he's gotten Bucky back ー or as close to Bucky as he'll ever be again, and it's enough, it
The room is wrong. The nurse’s hair is wrong, and while Steve may not have had a whole lotta luck with the dames, he has no doubt that her brassiere is wrong, as well. His shock at being alive blinks out of existence at the swell of anger that someone is trying to placate him by
“Let’s get outta here. News vans and NYPD are starting to show up.”
“Those are completely different places,” chuckles Steve. “Why the workshop?”
“Steve, no, don’t do this to yourself.”
“Okay, Stephanie, you’re almost there, all right? Just take a few deep breaths, try to relax.”
“We’ll stay near, Steve.” Natasha glances at T'Challa. “You sure you can be here? I know Ross is desperate for everyone to believe Barnes did this, and if he finds out you're here on a rescue mission instead of for vengeance…”
… … … …
“The re… Oh! Yeah, that’s happening, too.”
“You look like you're constipated,” crows Tony, doubling over and cackling into his knees, but a coffeemaker is on the floor in front of them, plugged in and ready to go.
“Rough.”
He allows her to pull him in for a tight hug. “Is it so wrong of me?”
was bat-shit crazy, but I turned out pretty okay.’” An inelegant snort breaks up the quiet. “Pretty okay, my ass. He’s a
ー is whisking eggs in a large bowl, the sound of metal against plastic slightly grating but still so familiar, the muscles in his shoulder and back rippling underneath the shirt he's wearing, and he's got his face turned to the right, smiling a soft, little smile that's melted on the edges with every positive emotion he could possibly be feeling right now, smiling that smile that Tony would kill to see but instead it's, it's aimed at…
The elevator comes to a stop on the workshop floor, and Tony enters the room with little trepidation. No matter what damage the bot has done, Tony knows he can fix DUM-E's mistakes. Tony feels a weight on his shoulders lessen at the whirring of wheels on concrete, and he turns to see DUM-E heading straight for the blender. A smile splits his face as he heads for the workbench.
Steve falls asleep to the sound of Applejack working herself to the bone to harvest the orchard.
Tony hesitates, staring down at his child, before glancing over his shoulder at Steve. Steve shrugs with a small smile, waves his hand in a motion to mean
The little boy’s dark eyes are wide as he stands right outside the door, staring up at Steve. Steve stares back.
“Might I offer my congratulations and best wishes, as well, Captain?”
“They have made use of the guest quarters near my own. At the risk of being too forward, I allowed them passage the moment Clint drew his bow.”
“Ya know, Peggy said something to me after… After. I always manage to forget it.”
A bottle of whiskey is pressed into Pepper’s hand; Tony doesn’t even ask where Natasha had gotten it from or where she kept it hidden. He merely grins at the usually-unflappable facade Pepper usually exudes being utterly torn apart, holds her tightly, and comforts her as she and Natasha drink the liquor silently in the glow of the city lights.
“Thor and his guests are in his quarters.”
about Loki today?” Tony asks from the bathroom where he’s brushing his teeth. “And I don’t mean typical Loki-odd. I mean… different than Loki-odd.”
In the nights that follow, Steve winds up in the workshop when he can’t sleep. The time there goes about the same as that first night ー they chat idly as Tony works and Steve watches. It isn’t long before Steve sneaks a drawing pad and pencils into the workshop with him; Tony doesn’t seem to notice that Steve spends the time sketching instead of responding to Tony’s technobabble.
Tony doesn’t know how to explain his hesitance, especially when he knows Steve is right; this isn’t Tony’s first business trip during their relationship. “Yeah, but you’re pregnant this time.”
“You fucked up. You know that, right?”
“I honestly completely forgot he used magic. I was too busy hating him for trying to take over the world using our favourite bird-brain.” Tony’s fingers tap out a rapid rhythm against the table. “I guess I can talk to Thor about it, see if he knows anything.”
have to? I mean, I thought we were doing just fine."
ー needs to be said, because he has nothing to do with this, he's innocent. We will go about our lives as if we've never been more than neighbours who occasionally cross paths.”
Peter manages to eat three and a half hot dogs, two handfuls of potato chips, and one-third of a large slice of cake before he starts looking a little nauseous. Steve takes the plate away from the child, handing him his cup of Sprite, and finishes off the chocolate dessert as Peter stares petulantly. Tony keeps his focus on Sam as they talk, even as Tony reaches for Steve's fork and steals the last bite of cake. The action causes Peter to giggle; he climbs out of the chair and rounds the table, clambers up onto Steve's lap. His eyes are dropping as he leans into Steve, and Steve runs his fingers through dark, sweat-damp curls, gently untangling the knots that have formed after hours of running around. It's almost anticlimactic the way Peter falls asleep with his cheek pressed against Steve's chest, mouth dropped open slightly. His soft snores catch his father's attention, and Tony stops speaking mid-sentence. Steve waves Tony's concern off, murmuring a quick assurance that he can handle this. And he can, and he does, but he's still thankful when Tony starts saying goodbye after another twenty minutes. Steve passes Peter off to Tony and stands, heading for the bathroom. Once he's done his business and washed his hands, he finds Tony standing by the door. The expression on his face as he rests his cheek on Peter's hair, eyes closed and his face relaxed, makes Steve's heart clench in his chest. He realises he's in far too deep to ever consider backing out now. Snapping a quick photo with his phone, he comes to a stop at Tony's side and lays a hand against Tony's lower back.
“Go on, then, don’t keep him waitin’.”
Steve glances over to see Craig leaning forward, eavesdropping. “Ma'am, would it be all right if we spoke in privacy?”
By the time the van comes to a stop, Steve has pretended to be unconscious for the better part of an hour, and they are far from the city. He keeps his body limp as he’s carried from the vehicle. The cot he is set down on is stiff, uncomfortable; Steve resists the urge to squirm.
“You do this for a living?” asks the other man as he sits on the bench across the table.
“Why are you even up now? It’s barely seven.”
“You’re right, Pep. She’s identical to Steve, I mean, minus the muscles.”
“They really are,” chuckles Tony, unable to stop the smile from taking residence on his face. “It’s actually kinda terrifying.”
Coulson stares at Tony, everyone stares at Tony, and Steve waits with bated breath for someone, anyone, to speak. Ms Potts remains silent, her lips thin in her face; Rhodes rolls his eyes but claps a hand to Tony's shoulder; Tony seems to wilt just a little under the apparent approval, and just like that, the others announce their agreement, even if it's a bit reluctant. Coulson nods once succinctly before looking down to make a note on the legal pad. Tony calls out for JARVIS to show the list of the compromises that will make up the Accords. The holoscreen hovers in the air above the table, and Steve reads over the points, a heady warmth growing in his gut at the final bullet:
“Together?” Tony asks with a raised brow, but it doesn't sound as sarcastic as Steve would have anticipated.
Steve storms from the table, anger and frustration roiling in his belly. They had finally reached an agreement on the oversight of the Avengers: They won't go to other countries to help unless specifically asked for, which makes sense. No country wants a foreign group barging in and trying to fix things but ultimately only screwing everything up even more. But then Bucky ー The Winter Soldier ー had come up, and the discussion had fallen apart. Coulson had said that SHIELD would want custody of the Soldier for the foreseeable future, Rhodes, Wanda, and Natasha had agreed. Sam, Clint, and, shockingly, even Tony had disagreed with that. Steve was in the “vehemently against” category, but he was biased, or so everyone said. Bruce doesn't feel comfortable making a decision like that; he said he's firmly in neutral territory, since he knows what it feels like to be hounded and hunted and threatened with imprisonment, but there needs to be something protecting everyone from the Winter Soldier and the danger he presents.
“And I'm glad to hear that.”
The god merely smiles, a bright smile that never seems out of place on his face, and disappears down the corridor.
. He struggles to sit up before either of them can react. Unfortunately, Don gets his bearings rather quickly, shoving Steve back onto the cot.
Steve’s just sat down at the table between Coulson and Sam when JARVIS announces the presence of two police officers in the lobby. After exchanging a questioning look with Phil, Steve tells the AI to let them up. The elevator dings a moment later, and the cops step out. Their faces are solemn, but he can see the way they keep glancing around the living room, awed by the size and opulence. Loki rises from his seat at the end of the dining table, suddenly Captain America in civilian clothes. He crosses the kitchen with his hand extended.
Steve absorbs the information, nods when he’s ready. Natasha’s right: Shaving his legs is very different than shaving his face. By the time he
“Can you please be serious? You got injured, and I’m not there.”
“Gonna run away again?”
warm.
After an hour of worshiping Steve's body, relishing the tastes and swallowing Steve's moans and sighs as he reaches orgasm two, three times before Tony even pushes inside, Tony curls his body around his lover's and strokes his fingers gently through Steve's damp hair. He knows Steve is keeping something from him, but he doesn't push. Waiting has never been his greatest skill, but for Steve, Tony would do anything, no matter how impossible it seems.
, to say that isn't reminiscent of a pop-punk song by a woman from Canada. Honestly, “I don't like your girlfriend” just sounds so petty and immature, and Tony is completely mature. So his brain races to latch onto words, and Steve is staring down at him with that pinched look around his eyes, his lips a thin line on his face, and Tony can't say anything.
“Next time, J, give me an escape route,” Tony grouses as he leans against the wall of the elevator.
”. And under other circumstances, it would’ve been true, but Natasha is the one who’s spent so much time with him lately, has kept him sane through all of Steve’s hormone-induced mood swings and his own panicking that he’s not ready to be a father. Tony’s never had such a terrifying best friend before; not even Pepper reaches the same level as Nat.
Steve sighs, willing the burning flush in his cheeks to recede, and leans against the counter. The spacious room is much too quiet without Tony, without his soft gasps and whispered encouragements, his choked-off moans as his thighs trembled and his fingers twisted in the blond locks. With a steadying exhale, Steve pushes the latest memory aside and busies himself with making breakfast.
“Guys, we gotta go. Ross is on-site. He's rallying up support, claiming Barnes is behind this.”
"This," replies Tony with a grin, the sight of which makes Steve release a relieved breath that the change of subject was the right thing to do, "is the place to go for the best damn pancakes and coffee in the world." Tony grabs a menu, holding it out across the table; his brow is furrowed again as if he's confused about something. "A friend brought me here when I was younger, and I never forgot it. I'd come back a few times a month, even without Rhodey."
“He doesn't want to disturb Miss Sarah,” she replies softly, as if she knew what he was going to say before the words could fully form.
“Good morning, gentlemen. What brings you by?”
“God, you're perfect.”
“Sorry, dude.”
“You look great.”
“I wish you’d told me this earlier. Any of us, actually.” Steve sighs, pulls his hand away. “I’m sorry.”
The sound of Billie Holiday singing pulls him from the world of Frodo and Gandalf. Steve sets the book aside, reaching for his phone. Tony smiles sleepily on the screen, a picture that Steve snapped in the early hours a month into their dating. Steve grins, thumb tapping the Accept button.
“Is Tony back yet?”
“Genius, remember?”
“So? I’m pretty sure Coulson asked Clint how it was.”
“I thought that was supposed to be me.”
“Yeah, guess it does.”
Steve rolls over in bed and stares at Tony lying next to him; light from the street lamp filters through the blinds, illuminates his face, still and relaxed in sleep, in thin bars of soft orange glow. The heat kicks on, blowing warm air through the room, and Steve shivers at the contrast on his bare skin. He lifts his arm when Tony shuffles closer, presses a kiss to the other man's forehead, and grins tiredly at the snuffling sound that Tony makes. Pulling the blankets up further over their bodies, he shifts until he's more comfortable with Tony tight against him and falls asleep to the gentle breaths puffing against his chest and the solid heat of his partner.
“What are you working on?”
Steve jerks awake to the sound of the occasional car passing on the street outside, dogs barking down the block, the air conditioning unit rattling in the window; the room is dark save for the bars of orange-yellow that filter through the blinds, and the blanket he usually keeps on the back of the couch for Peter is draped over his curled-up body. He pushes himself to a sitting position, wiping sleep from his eyes, and reaches for his cell phone. The clock reads 03:59, and the notification light blinks up at him. He unlocks the device and opens the message.
“Sherri’s getting her. Please tell me you’ve eaten dinner.”
“Main office.”
, and he pulls the door open. The wall directly across the entry is plastered with dozens of drawings; he gives them a cursory look before turning toward the office. A slim brunette sits behind the large desk, and Steve feels like he’s getting an X-ray as she looks him over. His smile in response is shaky, but he still steps up to the desk.
“The sunshine song.”
. What brought this thinking about? You’ve never talked about having kids before.”
“I–I won’t. I think this last talk kinda opened our eyes to how bad things can get if there’s no actual conversation.”
“I've… I've been dreaming about Tony since I was five years old. Like, not just dreaming about him, I mean, he's in my dreams, but we're able to communicate. My ma always said it was my overactive imagination, but I don't think it was. There's no way my brain would ever have come up with someone like Tony on its own. I'm not nearly smart enough or creative enough to be able to have ever heard the kinds of things he's talked about. I'm not dumb, but… Tony's way smarter than I am, and I couldn't ever come up with an explanation as to why artificial intelligence isn't as scary as people think or the solutions to green energy like he's been telling me for the past year or two.
“Have…have you thought about it before?”
“Yeah, it's… It's a good place.”
“Yeah, he really did. It’s amazing.”
“But… She
It takes nearly a month of daily three hour-long training sessions before the team is convinced of Loki’s ability to take Steve’s place effectively. To everyone’s surprise, it isn’t Clint or Natasha who is hardest to assure that the demigod is capable, but Sam and Thor. Sam, who’d been told of the plan shortly after the spies, whose response had been “Not my business, man, just as long as you’re happy,” maintains that his hesitance was due to the fact that Loki is a completely new character in his life, and seeing Tony and Steve getting hurt or screwed over is the last thing Sam wants; Thor claims he has always had faith in his brother but wants to leave nothing to chance. Loki, to his credit,
“We can do this,” Sam repeats confidently, reassuringly.
One more brush of their lips, and Tony's heading back into his apartment, closing the door behind him softly. Steve stares at the wood for a moment before making a decision. He yanks on his shoes, locks his door, and makes his way down the stairs, dialling a number as he goes. The air outside is humid, promises a rainy night. Steve spares a thought that he should have brought an umbrella, just in case, but he presses forward instead of turning back to get his from the living room closet. The man behind the counter waves when Steve steps into the diner three blocks away; he heard about this place after Sam and Natasha's first date. Natasha had merely said “It was decent”, which, for her, is extolling praises.
“Oh, um, hi. Tony didn’t… Well, he didn’t tell me how to close out of the, uh, the programs on this phone?”
need to hear, for the fiftieth time, that I create a ‘hostile work environment’ for people who aren’t a robot like –”
“Hi. You must be Tony. Stevie's told me lots 'bout ya.”
Tony chokes out a laugh but doesn't say anything in response. Steve hesitates then slowly reaches over, grasps Tony's hand gently in his own. A soft smile plays on his lips when Tony merely holds tighter.
The first night in the new flat is sleepless; it’s too quiet without squeaky pipes, neighbours blaring music at all hours of the night, or cops speeding by on the street. Steve lies in bed with his hands tucked under his head and stares at the ceiling. His mind travels idly, thoughts switching from topic to topic. By the time the clock reads just after four in the morning, he’s long given up on attempting to sleep.
“I don’t know. I feel bad. The only reason he asked me, of all people, is because he was in a rush because of some emergency. Besides, it’s not like Peter’s a bad kid. It’s like being paid for doing basically nothing. And I told him not to pay me. So he shouldn’t have tried.”
Steve smiles tiredly at Tony once he reaches the landing, allowing the transfer of child to father. “Hey. He was good.”
“Can’t sleep?”
Peter finally looks up, just a quick flick of his eyes from his stuffed animal to Steve’s face. “I’m Peter. I’m five in three months.”
“No problem. Us girls gotta stick together, ya know. Oh, watch your step. Where ya going?”
“No,” Steve whispers, closes his eyes against the guilt welling up. “I'm sorry. I shouldn’ be makin’ you feel bad. I know you're busy, you always are.”
"Don't be. Sam's right. It needed to be done."
Tony's eyes flutter shut, and he grits his teeth to keep from shouting. “Steve, please, I, I don't think I have it in me to keep going through this. I'll be fine, I promise, I'll be fine once I get over this, and I will. I'm Tony Stark. I get over everything. Nothing ever matters enough for me
“No problem.”
“Sounds like an amazing best friend. Hey, I’m Steve, by the way.”
“Let’s get out of here. You wanna get out of here? Let’s go.”
“Yeah?”
Tony laughs quietly. “Relax, Steve, I’ll take care of you.” He sobers up, pinning Steve with a serious look. “If you don’t like something, tell me. I don’t care what it is. I need you to be honest with me.”
“Five things you need to approve and sign or reject and sign. Either way, I’m leaving with five signatures. The plant manager of the London branch is waiting for a video chat on the tablet; he says he has some questions about the most recent memo and won’t take my word on anything, wants to hear it from the ‘man in charge who knows what he’s talking about’, as if I don’t know this company and its memos as well as, if not better than, you do. Also, I brought something for Steve. Where is he?”
on the front and makes his way out to the living room. Tony glances up from the tablet in his hands, smiling.
Keeping the secret has been harder than Steve initially thought it would be. He finds himself almost blurting it out at every turn. Clint helps keep most of the focus off of Steve, especially on Team-Bonding Nights when everyone settles in with their alcohol of choice as they watch movies or play board games (Thor is surprisingly skilled at Operation; Coulson is unpredictably the worst). It hasn’t even been a week since the positive test result, and already, Steve is struggling.
Both men fall silent, and Steve’s skin starts feeling a little tighter. As surreptitiously as he can, he wipes his suddenly-clammy palms on his jeans under the table. All he wants to do right now is get up, walk out of this diner, and go back to bed. The waitress comes by at that moment, so Steve orders a water, more to have something to do with his hands and less with being thirsty. Tony asks for a burger (“Greasiest one you’ve got”) and coffee. Once she’s gone, Tony folds his hands on the table in front of him and sighs.
“Really?”
to satisfy Preggo’s sex drive!”
Tony laughs, quiet and bright in the dim glow filtering through the glass. “You’ve made your point, Steven, Pepper gets a break from me.”
“It's dumb,” repeats Steve as he pours a cup of coffee. “Sorry I stole your car.”
“We wanted it to be a surprise, kiddo.”
“You mean –?”
Her lips tremble, and she lets Steve pull her in for a close embrace. He only holds her for a moment, then he releases her and motions toward the door. Pepper nods and sniffles; Steve makes his way to the door, stopping only to squeeze Peter's shoulder. He follows the path of dainty yellow petals spread on the floor, takes care not to crush them under his dress shoe. The seats lined up outside are filling quickly, family and friends greeting each other and smiling in the sea-salt breeze. An enormous canopy, gauzy and flowing, has already been set up at the front, and Steve quickly finds his seat. Steve had been surprised when Pepper had asked him to sit on her side of the aisle, but she laughed and told him that he should have expected it, he will always be her family now.
“You did,” murmurs Steve as he pulls Tony into a tight embrace, holding him close.
“Okay, that's fine. Just thought I'd extend the invitation.”
Steve disappears into the bathroom before Tony can respond.
“What's there to talk about? God, the déjà vu, I swear. Look, Steve, I never should've said something, really, I know this. I know you're with her, and… As much as it hurts, even I can admit you guys are a good-looking couple. I really should have kept this to myself, not made this awkward. I ー”
The silence is damning: Tony tenses up, his chest completely still as he stops breathing for a moment. Neither of them speak, and, while Steve makes jokes about Tony’s overwhelming inability to be quiet, he would do anything,
Tony lets a finger brush over the skin of Steve's hand. A bee drifts lazily closer, and Steve watches as it hovers near his face before bumbling away to a bunch of wildflowers. A warm hand wraps around his; Steve smiles slightly. Tony has never initiated the hand-holding. He rarely shies away from the touching, except for when he's in those dark moods, but he's always waited for Steve to make the first move. Steve flips his hand over so that their palms are pressed together, interlacing their fingers. Tony's lips quirk in a small grin before he presses a kiss, tender and quick, to the back of Steve's hand.
According to Officer Sanchez, the interviewer from the charity event was found in the middle of the night outside the emergency room. Security tapes show a taxi dropping his unconscious body off on the forecourt; when interrogated, the driver admitted to doing the ‘drop-and-drive’ after receiving a call. He’d arrived at the designated spot to find the man lying on a bench with a fifty-dollar bill and a note to keep the change in the breast pocket of his shirt.
Steve shrugs at Tony's words. “Yeah, fine. Just... overwhelmed.”
Pepper’s brownstone is blissfully dark and cool; Tony sheds the armour and falls face-first onto her couch. He’s asleep within moments.
… … … …
“If you will please step back, Stark, give me some room to work.”
“I don't think that's a good idea.”
Chocolate milk.
“Not here, unless you want to add an indecent exposure charge to that criminal record of yours.”
“Uh-huh.”
“I understand. I do. But maybe you should either accept that you’ll probably fight over this, or accept the fact that you won’t ever have children because you didn’t want to rock the boat.”
) but carefully peeled back the tape until the drawing, safe in a frame, was exposed. Steve struggled against his nervousness, and his palms grew sweatier the longer Tony stayed quiet. Finally, his dark eyes shifted from the art, pinning Steve with an intense, thoughtful look.
“You'll hear it from Peter first.”
Happy jumps out of the driver’s seat, pulls open the back door; Clint is the first to emerge, wearing a deep purple button-down and a blazer with his best pair of jeans. Sam follows in a fitted suit, turning back to help Natasha out. Bulbs flash brightly, rapidly, at the sight of her gown, all burnished gold clinging to her curves and ending in a gentle flare at the bottom. Thor and Jane are next. Even standing by a literal god, Jane is strikingly beautiful in a pale blue dress, more demure than Nat’s but no less stunning. Steve feels a stab of sympathy for her, knowing how uncomfortable and way out of her comfort zone she is. Tony finally steps out, and Steve’s breath catches. The tux he’s in fits Tony like a second skin. His Press Smile is already firmly on his face, and he waves and ducks back down to give Pepper a hand. Steve can practically see the headlines for tomorrow’s gossip columns, words screaming of Tony and Pepper being in a relationship again.
“I get it. It’s a lot to risk. You don’t have to agree if you don’t want to, Tony, nobody’s gonna force you,” Steve reassures him with a low voice.
“Which is exactly why I’m telling you to stay out of trouble. Would that be all, Mr Stark?”
Sam sets his bowl and spoon in the sink, letting his fingers brush the back of Natasha’s arm as he passes. She sends him a sweet smile before turning back to the stove. Clint mimes gagging, and Sam flips him off with a grin. He claps Steve on the shoulder and makes his way to the elevator.
Steve inhales shakily, exhales slowly. “We can do this.”
“Good. He’s my best friend, closer and dearer to me than pretty much anyone else in my life, and I’ll always love him, but he can sometimes lose himself in that giant brain of his.”
“Of course.”
“I’m not gonna win this argument, am I?” asks Tony after a long pause.
Tony sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face. “Steve wants children. With me.”
This story leads into a few others, all about the antics he and Bucky got up to as kids and teenagers, before Bucky shipped off to the Army and Steve did the same the year after. Steve falls silent when he finishes the retelling of the final hours of laughter and jokes before the Incident ー the one that cost them Rollins and Hodge, and came too close to taking Bucky, too. He manages to swallow down the bile that creeps up his throat at the thought of not having his best friend in his life any more.
beside her. Thor is on the right, watches the genius, and Bruce stares into a microscope, pencil in hand and poised over a pad of paper. Clint perches toward the top left with his bow drawn and aimed at nothing in particular. Faint grey lines between the figures give borders to the shape and brilliance of the arc reactor.
, and then he tentatively pushes closer. That seems to be what Steve was waiting for, if the way the kiss turns harder and more insistent is any indication. He slides one hand up Tony's arm to cradle his jaw, tilts his head to slot their mouths more firmly together, and Tony’s lips part on a soft sigh. There are no fireworks behind his closed eyelids, the world doesn't flip upside down, and his foot doesn't pop up from the ground, but Tony doesn't care.
“Yeah, we'll need them.”
“Mommy, you look
“You are no fun, Captain Wet-Blanket. Do you wanna practise anyway?”
happy to see the man, but… he wishes it was Tony instead. Happy grins, as much as he ever had in the time Steve has known him.
“No. Sir has gone to bed per Ms Potts’s orders. Would you like me to wake him?”
Tony stares at Steve, brows furrowed. “What?”
“You owe way more than I do, so don't try that,” responds Steve. His footsteps echo slightly as he crosses the room and sits on the stool next to Tony. “I think we need to talk about this.”
“Yeah, my day sucked, too. I mean, I talked to Thor, so he and his mother are back on Asgard now. Just gotta wait for them to come back.”
“I’m listening,” mutters Steve even as he ceases his assault on the punching bag.
“Tony –”
The threat only serves to cause Sam to laugh loudly. The ghost of a smile flickers across Clint's face, and Natasha rolls her eyes in the way that means she's secretly amused. Tony steps closer to Loki, darting a glance at Steve who fidgets uncomfortably at the entire situation but doesn't say a word. This time, nobody interrupts as the two men gradually get closer. Kissing Loki in Steve's form isn't bad - it's a lot like kissing Steve, but it also isn't.
“Oh, no,” groans Steve; his stomach churns, the motion having nothing to do with the acrobatic baby in his womb, and Tony sighs down the line.
She finished by pressing her hand gently to his lower torso; her voice took on an otherworldly quality, echoing faintly in the silence of the room. The golden wisps surrounded Steve fully, and he closed his eyes against the brightness. The light faded slowly, gave way to the flickering candle flames. He sought out Tony in the dimness, and his partner smiled, a sweet curve of his lips. Loki helped Steve to his feet. The blond closed his robe as Tony stripped. Frigga repeated the process on Tony’s nude body, and Steve found it nearly impossible to tear his gaze away from the sight before him. At the queen’s signal, Tony stood, dressed, and Loki stepped forward and handed her a bag. She thanked her son and tugged gently on the drawstring. Steve felt his face flooding with heat when he saw what she pulled from the depths of silk.
you. He would
Steve heads to his desk, shoves his earbuds into his ears, and drowns the others out with the RENT soundtrack. But he can’t stop repeating Bucky and Natasha’s words in his head. With a heavy sigh, he pulls his phone out from his pocket and opens the thread with Tony. The last text was sent two days ago, a mass of random letters and symbols ー either Peter got a hold of Tony’s phone, or Tony was mind-numbingly bored at a meeting; both of those options are equally possible, and neither of them would surprise Steve in the least. He takes a steadying breath, starts typing out a message only to delete everything before he can get the courage to press Send. This repeats five times before his phone is suddenly ripped from his hand, and a soft whoosh sounds as Natasha lets his phone drop back to his desk. He sends a glare in her direction, but she merely smiles and ambles through the room to go back to the Photography section.
“Thor? Please, please, explain why he’s standing in the middle of the living room.”
Steve doesn’t immediately make his way to the living room; instead, he heads to the workshop. The lack of loud music is enough to make his chest seize up, and he lowers himself onto the couch, wiping away tears. Dum-E rolls over from his charging station with an inquisitive beep, and Steve smiles sadly, brings one hand up to rest on top of the bot’s arm. Letting out a whine that sounds absolutely mournful, Dum-E lowers his claw until it lays on Steve’s belly, barely there but a steady presence nonetheless. Steve sniffs and blinks rapidly, but more tears come.
“You are rambling, Tony.” Thankfully, there’s a smile on the Asgardian’s face, so Tony nods in apology, and Thor’s expression turns serious, thoughtful. He crosses his arms across his broad chest, levelling Tony with a steady gaze. “You said that
A week later, Steve stands by Tony’s side in front of the UN, the rest of the team close enough for Steve to feel the brush of their clothes each time they shift. The past seven days have been filled with hours together, going over every bullet point in the Accords to hammer out the details and get rid of any loopholes that can be exploited by more political agendas, conference calls and meetings with legal teams; Coulson had finally told Fury what was going on, leaving out the shared dream, after it became clear on the fourth day that the Avengers-drafted Accords were more than likely to be made into law. Tony’s fingers are wrapped tightly around Steve’s wrist, hidden from view by Clint and Natasha behind them and the table in front of them. It's not a new thing, not really, but it still sends a thrill through Steve to know that Tony trusts him to be the support, the rock on which they all, but especially Tony, can lean.
“I'm sorry, I really am. I just… There's a lot going on out there, and sleeping, well, sleep isn't my best friend at the moment. I should've thought about how you felt when I didn't show, but I'm selfish by nature, Steve, and I am so sorry for that. I promise I'll try to do better.”
“All right, J-man, start the runthrough.”
; he decides to push his luck, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. To his immense surprise, she allows it, even leans into his side. They sit in silence like that, staring down at the city and its inhabitants.
“Captain Rogers is in the penthouse, sir.”
“Right, I'm sure you are. But I have a Widow's Bite here that needs some work. Can I come down?”
“This isn’t working,” he announces after the trio has eaten and are preparing to head out. Natasha gives him a long, measuring look, and Sam glances at Steve, down at his bag, and back at Steve. Steve sighs. “We’re always ten steps behind, and you two don’t deserve to be dragged all over the continent like this.”
“Sorry, it's… It's a souvenir of my past.”
Steve sighs, scrubbing a hand across his face. “My neighbour. Before Friday, all I’d ever see of him was him coming home late every night or when he was dumping trash into his recycle bin, which was always full of empty liquor bottles. Hell, we never talked until Friday, when he just showed up, told me to watch his kid and not kill him, and left. What kind of idiot trusts a complete stranger to watch his four-year-old?”
Steve leans up and swallows down Tony’s soft laugh, putting as much emotion behind the kiss as he possibly can. Tony’s fingers dig into his waist, but Steve can’t complain, he just presses closer. He grimaces and pulls away slightly when something presses, hard and cold, into his breastbone. Tony understands immediately, sighs heavily.
“Eh, kinda. Wanna just talk tomorrow?”
By the time the car comes to a stop, they've driven for nearly forty-five minutes, Peter has begun entertaining himself with a hidden object book, and Steve has started feeling like an idiot for not being able to think of acceptable conversation starters. Tony hasn't seemed to feel uncomfortable by the silence, however, so Steve doesn't bring it to his attention. Peter immediately latches onto Steve's hand once he's out of the car, and Steve darts a glance in Tony's direction. All the brunet does is smile and wrap his fingers around his son's free hand.
Steve feels his cheeks flaming, but he doesn't give her the dignity of a response. He merely unloads his work, grabs his pen, and gets busy. Her laughter is silent, unlike everyone else's comments and taunting. She runs her fingers over his hair before hopping off his desk and sauntering away. He ignores the others as he gets busy plotting out the next page in his comic, a task made much more difficult by thoughts of Tony.
Clint is perched on the island, watching Natasha cook (and most likely pestering her) when Steve enters the kitchen. Tony’s already left for SI, and Sam is finishing off a bowl of oatmeal. Bruce and Jane are at a convention of sorts – between the two of them excitedly rambling nonstop about it, Steve had gotten confused rather quickly, especially since neither of them were ever inclined to actually finish a sentence before starting a new one. Thor, Havardr, and Loki argue quietly in the living room.
He sits on the couch in the living room, pencil in hand as his sketchbook rests on his knee. He scratches idly at his chin and stares down at the lines that cover the page. His brain fills in the colouring automatically ー the piercing grey-blue of Bucky’s eyes; the purple of the arrow on his left wrist; the vivid sharp red of Peggy’s lips twisted into a knowing smirk as she gazes up at him over her shoulder where the pale yellow and deep green of the masks peek out from the hem of her blouse, pulled down to expose her soulmark; the electric white-blue of the circle that rests above his heart almost dead-centre of his thin chest.
“Clint, Sam, me. Maybe Loki, if he deigns to join.”
Bruce hands Steve a plate with French toast piled high. “Do you think – Well, won’t Fury be pissed about the deception?”
Steve sighs heavily but doesn’t drag his attention away from the page he’s reading. “Why?”
“He is in Thor’s quarters.”
Tony relents, nods, but Steve doesn't look away from the stretch of white in front of him. The pair sits in silence for a while, until Steve lets out a shaky breath.
“Yeah, I, uh, I got somethin’ to do. So can I have the keys or not?”
“Okay, Peter, you ready?”
s and
“Because you're drunk. I-I won't take advantage of you like this. You can say you want it now, but you could wake up and realise it wasn't what you wanted. I won't do that to you.”
“Sorry to disappoint, Cap, but I actively avoid conversations that I know are going to be painful.”
“Sedative, that’s all,” he slurs. “They didn’t get her, though.”
Steve laughs. “I’d be happy with a cardboard box by the river as long I’m with you.”
Frigga dips her head in acknowledgment of Tony’s refusal, not looking even slightly surprised. “Your dislike of Loki is understandable, and I lay no blame on you for your feelings. He has done irrevocable wrong, caused so much grievous harm to this world and its people, all in the name of a childhood slight and jealousy. With you I mourn all of the losses Midgard has suffered at his hands. However, I have spoken at length with him. I believe he has seen the error in his judgment.” A derisive snort sounds from Steve’s right, and the queen pins Tony with an intense look. “He has been imprisoned without contact since Thor bought him home. He will be glad,
"It's against the law to keep secrets from your dad, Pete, so 'fess up."
“Tony, he's sixteen.”
Tony glances at Natasha. “Then let's find Barnes before they do.”
“Tell me you don’t want this,” murmurs Tony as he brushes his lips against Steve’s, and Steve can’t deny Tony, not after wanting this for literal years, ever since he was sixteen and lounging with Tony on the beach and realised that Tony looked really good in the setting sun. “Tell me to stop, and I will.”
Tony shrugs jerkily, and Steve feels his heart fall even further. Howard had said
Tony's eyes seem to glaze over at the mention of a shower, but the expression is gone almost instantly. “Of course. Go on. I'll make sure Peter knows you say goodbye and you'll see him in two weeks.”
His mailbox is full when he checks it, and Steve rifles through the stack as he walks up the stairs. He comes to a stop when he reaches the top. Tony is sitting on the welcome mat outside Steve’s door, his attention on the phone in his hands. Steve watches him, soaks in the sight for a moment, before he clears his throat. Tony jolts, his phone clattering to the floor, and when he realises it's just Steve, he sends a flat, unamused look before climbing to his feet.
can afford all of this in one go is Pepper freaking Potts and Tony freaking Stark. You. Are friends. With Tony Stark.”
, in fact, Captain Rogers. Yeah, don’t think too hard on it. Magic.”
It takes four hours of arguing and planning, compromising and standing firm, before things get out of hand. Their voices are rising in volume, overlapping, and nobody is listening to anybody except for what they want to hear. Finally, Tony slams his hands on the table, and the forgotten dishes rattle with the impact.
“That’s good, though. Keeps you on your toes. And the, uh, request?”
Unfortunately, masturbating doesn’t have quite the same effect as actual intercourse. Steve is still on edge, still cranky, no matter how many times he locks himself in his room. He’s slightly less liable to snap at the others for very minor annoyances, but this only means he’s keeping the complaints to himself.
“Of course he was. He takes after his mom like that.” Tony glances away from his son's face, his teeth biting down on his lower lip in an effort to stifle a laugh. “Mm, kid drool, it's the latest fashion.”
. In true Tony-fashion, Tony grins, a shit-eating grin that Steve doesn’t trust a bit.
“A plan?”
“Goodnight, Peter.”
“You mean to tell me you never got sick?”
“That’s…that’s good. He’s usually well-behaved, but he also usually has more than five minutes’ warning about a sudden shift in schedule.”
“Fuck, I need a drink.”
Steve chokes on air, coughing until he can breathe properly again. Heart still racing in his chest, he asks, “Why's that?”
, fast enough after the Chitauri. That’s not even considering the way we were at each other’s throats before that.”
The hour passes slowly; though neither man talks, Steve knows Tony is still awake. His own mind is racing, so he can imagine how much of a shock this must be for the genius. He hadn’t meant to just blurt it out like that, but between the way the words have fought their way to the surface in the past few months and the overwhelming urge to be a father, he had no chance of keeping it to himself any longer. He almost wishes Tony would shout at him, antagonise him, pick a damn fight with him, anything but silently allow Steve to hold him tightly like this. Steve presses a gentle kiss to his lover’s hair, letting his fingers dance softly up Tony’s spine.
Happy wears an uncharacteristically sombre expression, doesn’t greet Tony beyond a succinct “Boss” as he opens the rear door to Pepper’s favourite town–car.  The drive back to the tower is quiet with the partition up and Clint refusing to speak; Tony sees the hearing aids resting on the seat. So he dry-swallows a couple ibuprofen, sits back, and tries not to freak out in the time it takes for the car to finally park in the underground garage.
“Not a problem. Poor kid doesn’t deserve this.”
This dream is set in an enormous studio apartment, one that Steve had drawn after seeing it in a magazine ー roomy with large, floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook an ocean and let in so much sunlight, it’s like there are no roofs or walls to block out the outdoors. There’s no furniture beyond an oversized bean-bag chair, but that’s okay, they don’t need it. Tony has his mechanics books, and Steve is content with sketching the scenery with the warmth of Tony by his side. They’ve spent so much time together the past nine years, they rarely need to speak any more. Instead, they just know what the other is feeling. Most of the time. Sometimes, Tony's a closed book, the scenery around them changing rapidly and his expression blank even as Steve tries his damnedest to get Tony to open up. Other times, Steve is lost in himself, stuck in freezing rain with Tony shivering next to him, but he can't stop the thoughts swirling around in his brain, he can't force them to a new location ー somewhere bright and warm, away from storm clouds and grey skies and a bone-deep cold that lingers even after Steve wakes. But here, in this apartment, it feels more like home than anywhere else Steve has ever been, inside and out of the dreams.
Tony comes to a stop just inside the kitchen, staring around at the scene in front of him. Bruce is standing at the island counter and dicing up bell peppers; Natasha sits at the table with a book and a mug of tea, ignoring everyone as she reads, though how she's ignoring Clint's yelps of pain when Bruce smacks his hand with the flat of his knife is...it's a miraculous feat. Maybe she's just used to it, Tony doesn't know, but it's plausible considering how long the two SHIELD agents have known each other and just how easily and often Clint manages to do something dumb to injure himself. Sam leans tiredly against the refrigerator, and Tony bites back the urge to scold the man for drinking straight from the gallon of orange juice. Who even does that, who drinks right out of the bottle that’s meant to be shared? Steve ー
“Hey, kiddo, I've missed you.”
“My day was great, thanks for askin’.”
“Okay,” agrees Tony, clapping his hands once. “So. Lunch with Louisa.”
“I thought you were dead. JARVIS said he couldn’t reach you, and you wouldn’t answer on the comms, and I was so scared.”
“He's right,” comes Clint's voice from the ventilation shafts, and Steve sighs as a clattering echoes through the corridor and suddenly the man himself drops down to stand slightly behind Tony. “The kid can fight as it is, but without proper training, he's gonna get very overwhelmed very fast.”
“Nat and JARVIS told me about it. Am I not supposed to know?”
“You're going to have to calm down, Thor. This ー” he motions to the brewing storm. “ー is going to make people ask questions.”
“Were you going to tell me?” Tony's gaze is sharp, pinning Steve to his place, and Steve has to nod, he can't speak. “When?”
He half expects the faceplate to pop open but isn’t surprised when it doesn’t. The brilliant blue-white of the eyes and arc reactor is achingly familiar. Steve’s fingers burn with the desire to draw them. He keeps himself from running his fingertips over the glossy paint of the suit, though it takes much more effort than he would have ever anticipated. Finally, Tony speaks, voice even and made mechanical by the suit.
“I… it must have been hard, suddenly stopping weapons production and going in different directions.”
“Were you guys planning on locking yourselves inside the entire time Steve’s pregnant? Because if you go out on a date with Steve any time in the next year, without a plan in place, you’ll cause the tabloids to go insane. The headlines will read ‘Iron Man Steps Out on Captain America’, and it will be big news for the foreseeable and unforeseeable future. And that’s not even including the arrival of the baby.” Pepper shrugs. “We have to think of a plan, a cover story, for the sudden appearance of a strange woman in your life.”
you not to say it," groans Tony, head dropping to hard metal. "Do we
or have a surrogate like every other rich, gay couple? But now, I'm okay with that asshole sticking around, because two of my best friends are getting what they want, and if anyone deserves to have their heart's desires coming true, if anyone deserves to have the chance to create a family, it's Steve. Not so sure about
“Fine, fine,” Steve concedes with a laugh, unable as ever to resist doing everything in his power to make Tony keep smiling like that.
At Natasha’s shrug, Tony gives JARVIS the go-ahead then goes back to eating his Chinese food and mocking the inaccuracies in the newest action flick. Pepper raises an eyebrow at them as she steps through the door; she toes off her heels, collapses into a chaise, and sighs heavily. Tony passes over the lo mein and a pair of chopsticks, smiling at the way her stomach growls at the smell.
Clint grins, completely unashamed, and slides off the counter. “Oh, yeah. That one was fun.”
Thor is, indeed, standing at the head of the sleek black table; his arms are crossed over his chest, and Mjølnir hangs from the hook Tony installed so the god would stop placing the hammer on top of potentially-important files. Tony is already seated in the chair closest to the door, tapping away at the screen of his phone. Steve brushes his fingers against the back of Tony’s neck before examining the remaining people gathered.
“Okay, first off, it’s not a date, and even if I was going on a date, why would your mind immediately jump to my neighbour?”
“Tony?”
“I had to go ー”
"Nah, don't worry about it. Unless it's
Tony sighs and forces a smile as he clambers off the bed. “You, uh, you’re still welcome at the tower when you’re done. Both, both of you.”
“They're sweeter and softer that way.” Tony brushes a hand over Peter's hair. “Thanks, Steve. He...he really wanted to spend time with you today.”
will make you pay. Stop letting your issues and lack of self-confidence get in your way of good sense. You have a child to think about now.”
“Yeah. I know.”
“Missed you, too.” Tony stretches up for a kiss, one that Steve willingly gives. “Sorry, Pep wanted us to be able to spend time with Pete after being gone for so long without either her or me having to wait.”
me, Ma!”
Steve looks up to see the nurse standing in the doorway to the room, her dark eyes gentle and full of compassion, and he can't let go. His fingers won't release Ma's hand. He can't. He hasn't held her hand in nearly thirteen years, not since he was ten, and he can't remember why he ever stopped. He can't recall when her hand started feeling so small in his, so frail and breakable, and he hates that he's let so many years go by without taking comfort in the feeling of her hand wrapping around his.
“Doesn’t mean he didn’t do it,” snaps Tony.
Tony lets out a heavy sigh, leans down to nudge at Steve's jaw with his nose, and there's no denying he's just as affected by these events as Steve is. The kiss they share now is soft, chaste, and Tony's gone off of Steve's lap before Steve can push for more. He grins at Steve like he knows what Steve is thinking.
“Hey, need help?” he asks in an undertone.
Working with the STRIKE team is nothing like working with the Commandos ー or the Avengers. With the Commandos, it was all about survival, relying on the kind of friendship and trust that only a warzone can create to carry them through and keep each other alive. The fact that they were all just a bunch of scared men playing a deadly game that they wouldn’t ー couldn’t bear to ー lose gave them the tools needed to forge connections with each other that made them into a seamless machine, well-oiled by camaraderie and jokes because if they didn’t laugh, they’d cry. With the Avengers, it had taken the loss of Agent Coulson to force them to direct their anger and fight at the Chitauri instead of their teammates. They made it through with the same sort of quips and teamwork Steve hadn’t seen since the 40s. It was enough for a moment, but then everyone went their separate ways. Rumlow tries to be friendly with Steve, and Steve is courteous in return, but he isn’t sure he can handle another friendship that fails. Natasha is the only one that he lets relatively close, if only to take a small amount of comfort in the way her eyes light up just a little at his attempts. They both ignore the way the others mutter amongst themselves, and they do their jobs.
“So… What the hell was that?”
“I expect nothing less from our family.”
Natasha pulls open her door before Steve can even knock. She gestures him inside; he follows her through the living room and into her bedroom. The large bed is covered in shopping bags and clothing boxes; a tall mirror leans against the wall by the closet door. She gives him a mischievous smile before ordering him to strip. When he balks at the command, Natasha rolls her eyes, reminding him that they now have the same body parts. This doesn’t assure him as much as he thinks she’s hoping, but he doesn’t say anything, just does as instructed. She rifles through the bags, and Steve takes advantage of her distraction and checks out his reflection in the mirror.
“Bringing him to the tower. No, don't roll your eyes, Katniss, you know if I want to keep someone out, I can. No, look, I can set up an area on the residential floors, block off all technology and access to weapons, sensitive information, what have you, take everything away that can be used in any potential way, leave only JARVIS still attached, still monitoring. That way everyone is safe from any potential threat from Barnes, but Barnes is also not stuck in some isolated room, cut off from everyone except whatever head doctors SHIELD can scrounge up in the aftermath of the info dump.” Tony sighs, leans forward. “I can find people who can help, really, JARVIS is so much better at digging for information about people than anyone in your organisation is, which, by the way, Fury was supposed to dismantle SHIELD, but you're still operating, which means HYDRA has plenty of chance to infiltrate again.”
. The corner of Tony’s mouth twitches, quirks upwards, but he focuses on Peter once more.
And Tony looks so sad, like he's hurting just as much as Steve, so Steve resists the urge to argue. He lets his fingers wrap around Tony's hand and kisses Tony's cheek softly.
“Okay. Steve, call the meeting. We have two very angry, very deadly assassins to deal with.”
“Fine. You’re no fun.”
Tony chuckles. “I feel like there’s a ‘yet’ at the end of that sentence.”
“You look happy, Stevie,” Ma says over lunch, and Steve ducks his head.
“Of course.” Steve pauses. “Petey-bug, ya gotta get off me if you want me to get your berry cereal.”
, manages to twist and pull at the right time. He winces when the screen door slams against its frame behind him but ignores the echoing bang as he lets his body collapse until he’s sitting on the edge of the sidewalk.
“They're with me to keep others off your back. Please, Buck, believe me.
“That was beautiful, darling, absolutely fucking gorgeous.”
“Yeah, Ma?”
“Oh! Thanks a lot, JARVIS.”
“Hey, how are you feeling?”
? And I could just see, so clearly, him putting a stop to squabbles between a mini-him and a little blonde girl with pigtails. And I
“You are an asshole, and I don’t know why I’m friends with you.”
Pepper sighs, thumbs pressing circles into her forehead. “I can’t argue with your reasoning, but please explain why you didn’t give me a heads up?”
“I’ve noticed you’re a workaholic, judging by the fact you usually leave before the sun’s even fully up and you rarely get home before eight at night, unless you have Peter. Then your days are significantly shorter, and I’m talking maybe five-hours-long shorter. You don’t offer a whole of information about yourself, and I have a feeling it’s always been that way. You’re snarky, you’re confident, but that’s really just a mask, isn’t it?” Tony doesn’t respond to Steve’s question, not that Steve actually expected one, so he continues, “You seemed very concerned with what Ben thought of how Peter was doing when we went to breakfast at
Tony stays still, eyes locked on Steve’s, and Steve forces a small smile. Finally, his partner backs up; Loki advances until he’s less than a foot away.
“I’m with Tony on this,” Steve says.
“To want a family with the man you love? I don’t think so. But does he even want children?”
“Why?” whispers Tony, and Steve bites back a smile.
big dumb blond.”
“Well, obviously, I didn’t. What do you mean, am I scared?”
comes back almost immediately, and Steve barks out a laugh at that. He knows it's a blatant lie ー even without witnessing him around children at the hospitals and homeless shelters they volunteer at, Tony still has that kid in Tennessee that he keeps in contact with. It had been hilarious at first to see Tony wearing a beat-up Dora watch then heartwarming when Tony explained the story behind how he got it from Harley, who'd been an enormous help (“and pain in the ass, let's not forget that”) when the suit was down.
written in pencil to know who that spot is reserved for.
as Tony, he’d accepted that she would never be able to wrap her mind around the odd relationship that her son had with someone she assumed was a figment of his imagination.
Steve doesn’t respond beyond a jerky nod, his thoughts having gone haywire. Why would Tony offer up a living space for them ー for
“That's bullshit, and you know it.”
As these things usually do, the tentative and still somewhat awkward friendship they’ve struck up spills out of the workshop and into other communal floors. Tony will sit at the dining table and tap away at his tablet while Steve cooks, or Steve leans against the counter and talks about what he’s learned from reading engineering books as Tony makes coffee. The other members of the team had given them inquisitive looks, cracked jokes, in the beginning but eventually, those stopped and have been replaced with acceptance. Clint is the one who starts up team movie nights; he announced that Steve having never seen
“I agree completely. Babies are wonderful additions to your life – at least, if being a parent is what you want. If not… Well, we strive to help people make the best choices for their lives.”
“I don’t wanna make him even more uncomfortable by being in his living space. Can’t he come here?”
“Stop having your AI lie to me, Stark,” Natasha’s voice says over the speakers.
“I’m eleven days late, and I took a test half an hour ago. I’m pregnant, Tony.”
“I think so.” Steve pauses. “Where’s the baby?”
“Fantastic!”
“I'm fine, stop worrying about me.”
Even the subtle touches and shared jokes come more easily.
“Why? Why can't we meet? It's been twenty, uh, twenty-six years since these dreams started, and I just, I want more. Tony, you're...you're it for me, ever since we were kids. I don't want to hafta stick to only havin’ you when we're both asleep. I wanna be where you are,
“Yeah, Iー I think so.”
“I… don’t know what to say.”
“Eira and Havardr are right here. Pepper and Rhodey are on their way to you guys.”
“Burn this candle the next time you take each other to bed."
“You will find Captain Rogers in the penthouse, sir.”
The sharp scent of motor oil and electrical wires filters through the awful haze in his head, and Tony gulps down air and avoids thinking about the roiling, churning of his stomach. He drops down to sit on the couch in the corner, stares blankly at the floor. After a moment of struggling to get his bearings, he fumbles for his phone, the screen lighting up under his thumb and scanning, unlocking with a quiet click.
Bucky claps a hand to Steve's shoulder and ambles out of the comic section, darting forward to kiss Clint's cheek as they pass each other. A low, long whistle pierces the air, and Steve pivots to see Kate nearing.
He unfolds the paper.
“Fury’s always pissed about something. It’s literally in his name.”
Steve clung to Tony's biceps as his hips snapped forward, pushing himself as deep into Steve as he could possibly go. Steve stopped caring so much about the staring penis-shaped candle after that, though Tony kept muttering about how creepy it was.
“Sarah Maria Stark-Rogers,” replies Steve proudly, and their family makes approving noises.
Another hours passes with more arguing, until Tony’s phone vibrates in his pocket. He ignores it in favour of attempting to sway the overseer’s decision, but he’s cut off by another bout of vibrating. He pulls his phone out and immediately feels his heart drop.
The AI helpfully brings the lights up as Steve heads out of his room. True to JARVIS’s word, the others are in the living room within five minutes. All of them wear expressions that resemble exactly how Steve feels ー except for Natasha, but even she looks slightly shaken. She leans against Sam from their spot on the couch, with Clint resting his head on her lap; Wanda sits on the floor against the couch, her head bowed and Clint's fingers brushing lightly over her hair. Thor stretches out along the other sofa, and Bruce is curled up in an armchair, his hunched form making him look smaller than usual. Only Tony remains standing, after Steve takes a seat on the ottoman. Nobody speaks, but Steve can feel the confusion and fear roiling off of them in waves. Tony catches his eye, jerks his head toward the kitchen. Steve follows.
“What’s that?”
“Where are you going?” questions Tony, sounding slightly hysterical.
“Yeah, um, I’m Steve Rogers. I’m here to pick up someone.”
“Steve –”
“Tony?”
in his tone that gives Steve pause.
“What is it?”
“Of course I am. Why wouldn’t I be after being reminded of how completely unprepared I am for this baby, and it’s not even
“Tony, thank –”
“I’m not going to–to scold you,
Tony walks away before anyone says anything else. Hell, he’s not sure the message has fully sunk into their thick skulls, but he has said his piece. It’s up to the idiots to make heads or tails of it. The drive to SI is filled with clips of his impromptu speech and the radio-show hosts debating whether he had the right to say what he did.
Steve sighs. “I’m… I’m not happy, exactly, that you drank the way you did, but you’re a grown adult, you can make your own decisions about your health. But you just disappearing like that made me wonder if I’m going to be doing this all on my own, whether this was a – a mistake. It’s, well, it’s a terrible feeling, and I don’t want to feel it again. I can’t keep dealing with the uncertainty of if and when you’ll start resenting me for this. Yes, I’m the one who brought up the discussion and the idea of a child, but you agreed. This is
“This is Steve.”
When he finishes (and Natasha has eaten half of what was on his plate, so no one realised how little he
“As would you, but let's not do that. Poor Darcy doesn't need to be scarred for life.”
Steve’s lips twitch into a small smile. “It’s only right for the godmother to hold her first.”
“You okay, sweetie? Men can be real scumbags sometimes, right?”
“Oh, that's wonderful. Oh! You're the Steve Rogers who wrote the
“I'm glad you had him, Ma. Tell me how you met again.”
“Do you want to?”
“Thanks.”
Tony dips his head in a nod, but Steve knows he doesn't understand fully, he
better. That’s when the first thought came, ya know? The whole ‘What would it be like, to actually be married to you?’”
Steve spends most of his time during the next two weeks in the near-abandoned gym in SHIELD’s lower levels. He’s well aware that he is constantly being watched, no matter what he does. His skin prickles under the scrutiny of the agents monitoring the video feeds as he makes his way through the gigantic building ー from room to gym to canteen to Records and back again. He’s left mostly alone; the only conversations he gets are from the staff who give him his meals and the agents who give him files and books on the seven decades he’s missed out on, and he doesn’t really consider “Burger, please and thank you” to be stimulating conversation.
Tony is out of bed before the sun peeks over the horizon the next morning, heading out the door with a quick apology for not being able to stay talk to Thor’s mother. Steve selfishly monopolises more of his time in the communal kitchen before his partner can fully leave. Unfortunately, JARVIS can prevent people from walking into the occupied room, but the AI can’t stop Pepper Potts from calling Tony’s phone while his cock is buried in Steve’s mouth. Steve finds himself hating the fact the woman has the override codes, even as he finishes swallowing and wipes at his lips and chin to remove any evidence. Tony gives him an apologetic smile, lingering kiss, and fervent
Steve stands in the doorway to Peter's room, watching as Peter slowly drifts off; once the child lets out a shaky breath, Steve steps out of the room, pulling the door closed slightly behind him, and makes his way to the living room. Peter's toys are strewn all over the floor; Steve really should have asked Peter to clean up before bed. It's too late now, so he sighs and gets to work. The toys go in the basket by the hallway, books back on the shelves, and colouring supplies in the drawer of the entertainment centre. After everything is cleaned up, including the few dishes from dinner, Steve sprawls out on the couch.
Steve starts, glancing around at the other diners; nobody pays any attention to them. “Uh, yeah, he did.”
“Of course you can. You’re still you inside, where it counts. The packaging’s just different, is all. Don’t worry. Tony knows it’s you, he’ll love no matter what form you’re in.”
“What’s a ‘mergency?”
“A new suit, mostly, but got a few other toys I wanna get into production.”
“I ー”
“‘Cause I have three daddies.”
“Next time Steve starts having a nightmare and I’m not here, alert me. I don’t care what I’m doing. He’s… He’ll always come first.” He flails then, a knee-jerk reaction to being surprised. “Wait, go back.”
“Thank you.”
“Seeing him.”
“Tony… it'll be fine, I promise. I'm gonna go get changed. Anything special I should wear?”
“Hey. He’s asleep, so if you wanna grab his stuff, I can carry him over for you.”
“How can you be so sure?”
It isn’t a question, not really, but Natasha nods solemnly and averts her gaze back to the HYDRA base. They stand together, silently surveying the destruction that Bucky left behind. Steve has a suspicion that catching up to Bucky won’t be as difficult as he previously thought ー it’ll be much harder. After a couple more minutes, Redwing exits the building among another small cloud of smoke, and Sam joins them. There’s nothing else they can do.
“Of course you do, it’s amazing. Just like the rest of me.”
And now it's been four days, and there's a fidgeting, nervous-looking teenager sitting in one of the chairs in the conference room. Steve watches the kid spin from side to side in the chair, foot tapping against the floor. Tony breezes past where Steve stands in the doorway and tosses a manilla envelope onto the table so that it slides across the surface to stop in front of the kid.
Steve nods, swallowing past the lump in his throat. “Yeah, we are.”
Steve is still here, off to the side, talking to… someone. Someone important, Tony guesses, judging by the way he's maintaining eye contact and hasn't taken a sip of champagne in over a minute. Natasha taught Steve that method ー take a sip of his drink anytime his conversation partner smiles or laughs, and they'll start to associate the happy feeling with Steve and they're more likely to give over money or do what Steve is asking of them. It's a simple con, but one that's worked for as long as humanity has had the desire to con for what they want. But the discussion Steve is having now is serious, and he's not going to try to diminish that seriousness with neuro-linguistic tricks.
“And Thor?”
He kisses her head, and Steve wants to protest Tony’s “rule”, but he’s interrupted by a jaw-cracking yawn. Tony smiles, reaches for his hand, and tells him to rest. For once, Steve doesn’t argue. He falls asleep staring at his little family.
“Only a couple months. I figured it out when Coulson gave me files to go over, help me acclimate to what the world has gone through,what the

“Oh, thank – What the

“No, no, we can't, oh god, Peter's just in the other room, we can't.”
ing noise and nudges at Steve’s hand when it becomes clear that Steve is too far lost in thought. Steve huffs out a laugh and continues wiping the metal clean. With a sigh, Steve glances at the door, an odd sense of being watched washing over him before he shrugs it off as the presence of JARVIS’s cameras.
“Do I hafta eat the veg'ables?”
happy, Ma. Tony is...amazing, and he really makes me happier than I ever thought I could be.” He pauses. “Is this how you felt with Pop?”
“Why here?”
Steve hangs up but not before hearing the tell-tale sound of skin slapping skin – hard – and a husky voice crying out at the impact. With a full-body shudder, Steve plugs his phone on the charger and shuffles down the hall to the bathroom for a quick shower. He dries off swiftly and dresses in a pair of boxers and sweats. It’s too quiet in his room once he stretches out on his mattress, so he reaches for the clock-radio on his bedside table and scrolls through the stations in search of anything besides commercials or talk shows. Sighing in frustration at his lack of success, he pushes the switch to the off position, rolls onto his back, and resigns himself to a night of incredibly terrible sleep.
“Oh, darling, I’m not making fun of you. But Steve, calm down. It’s a child, not a bomb bringing about the end of the world. Just feed the kid if he’s hungry, turn on cartoons or give him a pen and paper if he’s bored. Treat him nice, and if you’re really this uncomfortable about it, tell the father you can’t do it again. Steve?”
Pepper cocks her head, staring between the two men across from her. To her credit, she doesn’t act on the curiosity in her eyes, instead steering the conversation back to Peter. “What did you tell him?”
“I do apologise, sir, but –”
“Daddy's in the bathroom. He was s'posed to make me brek-fist, but he's been in the shower a
“Howard would
“Did you mean it?”
“I didn’t know Pepper called you until after I came home. I remember standing in my office and feeling like I’d forgotten something important. JARVIS told me I’d missed the sonogram, and I kinda… zoned out, I guess, so he might’ve told me you’d been informed of the disaster, but I didn’t hear him. I originally intended on having only a couple drinks, just enough to calm down, then coming home and groveling until you forgave me. But the more I drank, the more I convinced myself you were going to break up with me, move out, and only allow me to see the baby on the weekends. Then I didn’t want to come home drunk, so I slept it off at Pepper’s.”
“Night, Tony. Sleep tight.”
“Where are you going?” asks Tony as Steve puts the journal in the nightstand drawer.
thing: They agreed not to tell anyone else until Steve was past the first trimester.
“I, I think we did that, yes,” Steve replies a bit breathlessly, and Tony starts laughing immediately.
of the latch deafening in the otherwise silent apartment, and when Tony turns back around, he has one hand in his hair, and he's chewing on his lower lip.
“Okay. Come inside, take a left.”
Tony knocks on the door, waiting a moment before opening it. Steve looks away from the television, smiles when he sees Tony. A plush recliner has been placed by the bed; Tony crosses the room and sits down. He immediately reaches for Steve’s hand.
Tony tells him, his words halting and full of pain, about the three and a half months they spent without seeing each other ー the demo his company had planned in Afghanistan, the abduction, the barest bit of the torture he'd endured. When he finishes speaking, he hesitates but reaches for the buttons on his shirt. Steve stops him.
“We’re gonna have a baby.”
Inside are ten fifty-dollar bills and five hundreds. Steve marches toward the door, ignoring his best friend calling after him, and cross the halls. Tony answers Steve’s knocks almost immediately; Steve is momentarily stunned by the other man’s appearance, which is much less put-together than any other time they’ve crossed paths: Tony’s tie is draped around his neck, unknotted, and half of the front of his shirt is untucked from his slacks. Even his hair isn’t as neatly styled as usual. Steve quickly gets his focus back, pushing the envelope against Tony’s chest.
“What I’m about to teach you isn’t a necessity, but it’s something that is best to learn to do in case you decide you want to at a later time. Or never at all.” She shrugs and shakes the can; it takes far too much of Steve’s brainpower to avoid watching the way her breasts bounce beautifully in the thin cups of her bra. “Even if you don’t shave at all during all of this, at least you’ll know how so you can teach your daughter, if you have one.”
“The board doesn’t like what you make?”
“What are we supposed to do if we get a call to go out and fight crazy people intent on destroying or taking over the world? Say, ‘No, thanks, we can’t today, since our dear old Captain America is knocked up’?” Clint drains his beer and begins picking at the label. “I just, I have to ask. Did you even think this through?”
His head rolls on his neck at the quiet echo of her feet on concrete. Her toenails are pale purple, nearly white, and he isn't sure why he notices that but he does, he fixates on the soft splash of colour on her pale feet. Those lilac splotches near, and he still can't drag his gaze away. Natasha stops in front of him; he finally jerks his focus away from her toes to see her standing there, her head tilted, red curls falling around her face. Her green eyes are big, Disney-like, and there's something unreadable in their depths. Her lips thin as she holds her hand out, showing him a Bite that's broken around the edges. She doesn't try to hand it to him, thank gods, Tony doesn't think he can bear having to take it from her, not with the way he's feeling already.
“What, don't think a pillow can help in a fight?” he snarks at Steve's questioning look.
“Thanks, J,” Tony responds, smiling, as he undoes his cufflinks with a flick of deft fingers. “Any problems while Daddy was gone?”
No one seems to notice, really, when the newlyweds, Tony, and Steve disappear from the reception; Phil and Steve stay a couple steps behind the parents as they head toward the suites Tony is paying for as yet another wedding gift to Pepper and Phil. Steve rests his shoulder against the doorframe of Peter’s room and watches as Pepper brushes a stray curl from her son’s face. Peter stirs a bit, his eyes fluttering open. Steve’s heart clenches tightly in his chest, a pleasant warmth spreading outwards, at the small smile that makes its way onto the kid’s face.
He presses the voicemail icon and brings the phone up to his ear.
Sam returns five minutes later with their drinks and fruit-and-cream-cheese danishes. They sit quietly, eating without speaking; a few people stop, ask Sam for autographs and pictures. No one pays attention to the pregnant blonde with him, and Steve is thankful for that. He normally doesn’t mind conversations, but he’s exhausted. He hadn’t even really wanted to come out today – staying home and napping sounded like a better plan – but he'd let himself be convinced that going out was a good idea, even with his swelling ankles and sudden inability to cope with the humidity of summer in New York. So here he is, sitting in the July heat with one of his best friends as they attempt to spend time together in peace.
. This feels like nothing Tony has ever had before, not even with Pepper, and he'd thought he'd loved her more than anything or anyone, though he was so wrong. This is everything Tony has never known he wanted, dreams he had never had coming true in the slow slide of their lips.
She levels him with an unimpressed glare, though it gets ruined completely by the smile she can’t smother in time, and heads down the hallway toward the bathroom. Tony breezes through the chat with Byron, reminds the manager that Ms Potts is CEO of Stark Industries for a reason – and it isn’t because of her looks; reads through the proposals, accepting only one and rejecting the others, signing each packet with a larger signature than necessary (but it’s only because he doesn’t want Pepper to not see that he actually did as requested, that’s all; it has nothing to do with being a smartass); finishes his coffee; and makes his way to the bedroom.
“Captain Rogers, as you are not in the tower, I am unable to get a reading of your vitals. Please confirm that you are no longer feeling symptoms of an ongoing anxiety episode.”
“Do I – okay, yes, I have to, jeez. Enough with the eyes.” He steps into the armour, hisses when his wrist bangs against the metal. “
Pepper clears her throat quietly, and  Coulson's head swivels toward her instinctively. “You two...know each other, then?”
It’s been two months since his desire to have a child with Tony hit him like a runaway freight train, and it’s just grown stronger every day. There have been a handful of times, just in the last few weeks alone, where Steve has nearly blurted it out; only his much stronger desire to not fight with - or worse, lose - Tony has stopped the words from slipping past his teeth. He’s forced himself to ignore his wants and go about the days like normal.
“I’m going to sleep at Natasha’s tonight. Goodnight, Tony.”
After all, it means he’s
Steve pulls his phone away from his ear to check the time; Tony’s right. “Oh. Well…you can still go. We’ve got this, I promise.”
“Hey, Tony? Shut up.”
“It wasn’t Clint and Sam. At least, not alone. He was involved.”
. They part in the hallway, sharing a soft kiss over Peter's head, and Steve watches as Tony disappears behind his door before going into his own flat. He doesn't bother turning on lights, just toes out of his shoes and makes his way down the dark hall, flopping onto his cold sheets. He can't fight the smile that forces its way onto his face, so he doesn't even try. He just falls asleep feeling warm down to his bones.
“Am I drunk? I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol in damn near a year, and you think I’d suddenly get drunk because what? I was bored or something?”
Steve doesn’t realise he’s spoken aloud until JARVIS replies.
Steve forces a grin in response, nodding succinctly though he doesn’t believe Sam’s words; the other man catches Natasha’s eye, his gaze dropping quickly to her lips before darting back up, and he opens his mouth as if to say something. Natasha responds by pushing gently, playfully, on his forehead until he’s no longer leaning into the car. Her teeth are biting at her lower lip in an attempt to stop her smile, but Steve sees it anyway. Sam pats the car with a hand, steps back so Steve can pull away from the curb. Natasha doesn’t speak for the four and a half hours it takes to get to the Tower, just stares out the window as the vents blow out warm air. Her hair is pulled back into a messy bun, stray strands of vivid red dancing in the slight breeze, and Steve glances at her as she gathers up the bag of trash from the drive.
“I, uh, also told Coulson.”
“Okay.”
“What?”
“You love him, and I love him, and he loves us, and you said you’d only ever want to get married if someone loves me ‘nuff and Steve
funny – there are a lot of people who agree with the anti-LGBT+ stance – but it never fails to amuse him when his past antics are used as a weapon against him. He’s had far too many years to accept the mistakes he made in his personal life and the consequences caused, and besides, all the parties, booze and cocaine, random one-night stands… They all led to him being in the best relationship of his entire life, with a baby on the way. So he can’t find it in himself to regret those years too much.
His skin is tight, too tight, and frustration simmers along his every nerve. He’s breathing heavily; a video plays on the holoscreen at the foot of the bed, but even the recording of the filthiest sex he and Tony’s had isn’t helping. Tears burn in his eyes. With an embarrassingly loud groan, Steve turns off the vibrator, tossing it to the side, and waves a hand. The video disappears, and the room is thrown into silence.
Steve sees Clint and Kate's heads pop up, their faces turning in his direction, but he's focused solely on the way Sharon's not speaking, the silence dragging on a beat too long.
Happy closes the door quietly after Steve backs away. Steve shifts his weight between his feet, awkward all of a sudden, then steps back further. Happy rounds the car, stops by the driver's side door, and stares at Steve with an unreadable expression, before nodding once succinctly. He slides into the seat and starts up the car, driving away almost immediately. Steve sighs and makes his way back to his apartment.
“You haven't asked that since you were a wee one, Stevie.”
“I shall belay the order until you two have come to an agreement as to whether I should or should not.”
“Yeah? I’m twenty-nine.”
“Did…did I do something wrong? Because you’re acting weird, and if I somehow managed to fuck up despite not even being within a block of the tower all day, tell me now so I can fix it.”
, he sends to Tony.
“Yeah, yes, that's perfect. Thank you, Miss Hill.”
, he’ll be doing this anyway just, just on his own and without us for backup. I give him a month until he runs into something bigger than him, and it could very well kill him. And I can't, I can't have that on my conscience.”
“Tonight’s bath night.”
“Good morning, Steve. Want some breakfast?”
The team slips out of the room around nine, promising to come back the next day. Sarah has been fed and changed, and now she’s sleeping in Steve’s arms again. Tony’s phone lights up from where it lays on the table, but he ignores it in favour of curling his body around Steve. His fingers stroke across their daughter’s delicate features, and his heart feels overly full. There’s something that’s nagging at his brain, however. He sighs.
, lets himself feel the overwhelming torrent of emotions that he’s kept locked up in the name of doing his duty.
“Yeah,” answers Steve after a pregnant pause. There's no reason to ask Tony for clarification, there's only one thing he could be wanting to know.
“He demanded a bath, didn’t he?” asks Tony after a short pause, but he makes his way down the hall anyway; Steve goes with him so he can answer Tony’s question without yelling.
Steve stares down at the sonogram in his hands, blinking against the heat in his eyes. He slides it into an elegant envelope, re-reads the letter.
Steve sighs and stares at the slowly-filling coffeepot. “Yeah. Just… Not enough sleep.”
“Can we think about this?” Tony asks, much more quietly than Steve would have expected in such a tense conversation. “Cap and I just need to talk this all over.”
“Yes, because an hour between visits is too long.” Coulson grins. “It's great to see you, too, Tony.”
Steve is roused from his slump on the sofa late the next afternoon by his front door opening. He turns his gaze away from the television set, and Tony grins as he closes the door behind him. Steve feels his lips move, twist, form into a smile on their own; he opens his arms, letting Tony collapse onto the couch next to him, and pulls the other man close. Neither man speaks for a few minutes. Steve is content enough to bask in the solid warmth that Tony provides.
, you're friends with
. If you’d have been against this…”
“Don’t open it yet. I’ll distract Tony once you get back to the penthouse. Also, Steve? Use condoms when you guys have sex.”
“Just… try, try to figure out whatever is going through that damn head of yours and talk to him.”
Tony laughs when Gary shrugs, says a goodbye, and heads toward the elevators. He’ll never admit that he stuffs himself into a nearly full car at the last minute just to prolong the inevitable. Twelve stops later, he steps into the lobby outside the CEO’s office. Her receptionist gestures for him to go in, so he pushes the door open with his usual flair. Pepper is already glaring at him; he sheds the cockiness, closes the door behind him. At least she waits for him to sit before she launches into her tirade.
“Holy shit, you feel amazing, oh my God, Steve.”
“What's wrong with Coulson?” Bucky asks as he pulls open the cupboard.
Steve rolls onto his back with an ease and speed that Tony doesn’t anticipate. “Really?”
“He ー”
“That's...an odd and very specific profession, not gonna lie, and it's kinda creeping me out, so let's not ever mention that particular career ever again.”
Tony rolls his eyes at JARVIS’s announcement. “Of course the brat won’t listen to his infinitely smarter brother. Dum-E, this beautiful woman beside me
“Fifteen minutes, then we will.”
“It is my pleasure, Captain Rogers.”
The man looks confused and disgusted. "What kind of job makes you work on a Saturday?"
Peter is already completely naked by the time Steve turns around. Steve hesitates but ultimately merely steps aside for the kid to clamber into the tub. Peter immediately drops to sit on his knees, hands wiggling under the water. Steve decides to let him play a bit since he seems to be having fun, and all that he’s heard about kids is they either hate being in the water and scream the entire time, or they absolutely love being in the water and scream when it’s time to get out. After a few minutes, he grabs the cup from the counter and sits on the edge of the tub.
The small diner they walk into is unlike any other diner Steve's ever seen. The walls are a sunny yellow, decorated with pictures of the past; dark tables have actual place-mats ringing a basket of condiments and tidy menus in the centre. Tony leads them to a booth toward the middle of the far wall. Peter lets go of Steve, clambers onto the seat, and sits on his knees. Tony slides in beside him, and Steve takes the other side. He stares at the photograph on the wall - the man in it looks vaguely familiar.
“It’s worth it if it makes you happy,” replies Tony on a soft whisper, with a kiss pressed tenderly to Steve’s shoulder, and he knows it’s a cliché but it’s also so fucking true. “I promise I won’t resent you for this decision. I’ll be able to handle having to deal with him until we’ve got our – our baby, oh fuck, our
“Is that –?”
“Buck?”
“Barring any unforeseen surprises in the blood sample, we’ll want you to come back in about four weeks. Does the sixteenth of next month, at 10:45 a.m., work for you?” At Steve’s nod, she jots a note down on the calendar. “Okay. Oh, and Ms Crawford?”
Steve tugs him down and wraps him in a tight embrace. Tony allows it, nuzzles his face into the crook of his lover’s neck (and Jesus, when did he become a damn cat?); he stays quiet, letting Steve process everything. The whole ‘analysing everything before making a decision, at least when it counts’ is what made Tony accept the fact that Steve has never been just a teammate.
It’s been a month since the news was broken, and Tony can’t go a day without hearing at least five things baby– or pregnancy-related. Natasha and Steve have gone shopping a handful of times, but she’s refused to give Tony any clue as to what they’ve bought. Tony doesn’t really mind – Steve’s over the moon, Nat’s not threatening to kill anyone (who doesn’t deserve it), and Tony’s been able to focus on work a little easier, so it’s all a win in his eyes.
Steve rolls his eyes and sets the phone on the nightstand. He noticed Tony didn’t mention them talking once Steve is done with his plans, but he understands why. He stretches himself out on the bed and rests his head on one arm. He isn’t sure how much sleep he’ll get tonight, but he has to at least try. A small part of him wishes he’d stayed at the tower ー there, he never had to worry about waking the neighbours if he woke up screaming for Bucky. He knows, though, that remaining in New York hasn’t been an option since the moment he found out his best friend is alive.
“I really, really love you, too.”
“He has been there for nearly two hours.”
“I will, I will! Holy guac'moly, is that Miss Wanda?”
Steve tightens his grip on Tony, thinking hard about the words he wants to use. It’s been almost two years since Tony slammed into his life with the grace of a runaway freight train, and whatever Steve says now
It's almost a reprieve, the way the team is called to assemble five days after Fate’s visit due to a sudden appearance of Doombots taking over Long Island. The committee doesn't hesitate to call for the Avengers, and the Avengers don't hesitate to suit up and answer the call. Spiderman assists, his technique still his own but more practiced, more refined. He fits in quite well with the team, as his constant commentary is very similar to Clint's and is oddly endearing to Natasha and Sam. The bots are dismantled in record time, cleanup is left to SHIELD, and the team heads home within a couple of hours. Tony has JARVIS order enough Chinese food to feed a small army before disappearing to the workshop; Clint, Wanda, and Sam head off to their rooms to clean up, while Natasha helps Bruce to his lab so he can decompress after having been Hulk and being shot at. Thor makes his way to the kitchen to prepare for the delivery of food, pulling plates from cabinets and silverware from drawers, placing them on the table. Steve rushes through a shower, changes into a pair of boxers and worn sweatpants. He's just pulled a t-shirt on over his head when there's a knock on the bedroom door.
“I… I don't know. Did, did you ー?”
“Steve, the doctor needs to talk to you.”
When Peter starts swaying on Steve's shoulders twenty minutes later, Steve sets his bag on a ledge, shifts Peter into his arms and rests the child on his hip, and heads toward the exit. He's gotten enough, and Peter is nearly asleep. He decides against hailing a taxi; they aren't too far from the apartment, anyway. At least he was sure they weren't, but halfway back, Steve starts reassessing that assumption. The trip home seems to take four times as long as the walk to the market. Then again, he hadn't had a sleeping child on his hip that time.
“I still say you could walk into a meeting in a trash bag and still be able to scare the shit out of the idiots on the board,” remarks Tony, causing both Pepper and Steve to startle. “And you, my beautiful blond love, look fantastic. What’s the occasion?”
“Really, Cap?
. His eyes burn with unshed tears as Tony fills him over and over and over again, and he can’t stop the noises that fall from his open mouth. Tony drapes over his back, one hand wrapping around Steve’s shoulder, the other coming to rest over Steve’s heart, and Steve cries out at the change of angle, at the way Tony’s cock slides across his prostate repeatedly, at the way their soulmarks seem to vibrate and sing with the contact. He brings a hand up to grab on tightly to Tony’s wrist, holds him close.
Steve isn’t sure when one finger becomes two, he’s so caught up on the buzz of heady want, but he can’t ignore the sting and stretch of three fingers opening him up. His breath catches, and Tony’s hand is soothing along the side of his ass. His hips grind down into the blanket, he’s searching for release and desperate for it, by the time Tony pulls his hand away. There’s the sound of the wrapper opening, and Steve reaches back blindly. The condom is slippery when Steve takes it in hand, and he’s grateful when Tony moves closer so Steve can roll the condom on. Tony’s moan sends Steve’s blood singing. He wonders what Tony tastes like, but he doesn’t get the chance to voice his desire before Tony is pushing his arm away with a gentle smile. Steve rests his weight on his forearms, stares at the floor, as Tony settles in behind him. The head of his cock pushes slowly into Steve, and Steve instinctively holds his breath and tenses until Tony reminds him to
“Because of your past?”
“I promise, Cap, you won't have to lie to her.”
Steve stumbles toward the bed and sits down roughly. He has no idea what to do now. He knows finding Bucky is important, it’s why he left New York in the first place, but Tony is just as important, at least now that Steve knows that Tony knows. He’s torn on which path he should follow: Hunt for his best friend or go after his soulmate. Steve cradles his head in his hands, gripping his hair tightly in his fingers, then scratches at the back of his neck. Something on the nightstand catches his attention when he reaches over to shut off the lamp.
“Hey, sweetheart.”
Steve walks away before Natasha can say anything else. His mind wanders as he boards the elevator and waits until it stops rising. When the doors open, he’s shocked to see he’s looking out onto the corridor on Natasha’s floor and she’s standing just beyond the lift. He raises an eyebrow; she beckons him into her apartment with a soft smile.
“Thank you, Pepper.”
She perches on the edge of his desk. “Seriously, you're too old to use emojis like that.”
it already happened.”
just throw a straw wrapper at me? Wow, you
“It’s nothing. Go to sleep. You have a board meeting in the morning.”
“It's been twenty-five years, did you know, since we first met.”
“Hey.”
"Did you enjoy it?"
Steve finishes the minute detail he’s working on, closes the sketchbook, and sets it in a drawer. Tony stops him with a gentle hand on his bicep; Steve dips his head and presses a kiss to his lover’s lips. He knows that Tony’s worried but trying hard to hide it. Though they’ve been together so long, he still has difficulty expressing anything that can be used against him. Steve knows it’s because of how Howard raised him, but it doesn’t make it any easier to deal with. In fact, he always wishes there was a working time machine so he could go back and punch the Stark patriarch in the face for how he treated his son.
“Easiest choice I’ve ever had to make. Sure, the process up to making the decision wasn’t so easy, but hey, whatever works.” Tony’s shoulder tightens, and a soft tapping noise fills the air. “Howard was pissed. When he saw my mark, I mean. I knew it had something to do with you ー I mean, how could I not, when I had a fucking shield on my wrist when everyone was aware of Captain America and his sacrifice ー but we knew you were dead, so it was just another way I’d somehow managed to fuck up without even trying. And lemme tell you, Howard made sure I was aware of how royally messed up I was. It was his favourite phrase: ‘You’re such a screw-up, fate let your soulmate die just so he’d never be stuck with you.’ Get in trouble at school or with the law, which was… far too often, I admit? I heard it. When he was drunk or in a foul mood because of some bullshit with the company or my existence? I heard it. And believe me, he was drunk a lot. It was the only way he could tolerate me, I guess. So yeah, I heard it a lot. And after a while, you start believing that shit. And…”
“Okay, you’ve done that. You gonna go now?”
Gentle fingers caressing his scalp are the only warning he gets that Natasha has arrived. She lets him have his internal freak-out in silence for a few minutes then tugs softly on his hair. He follows her into the bathroom, watches as she opens a drawer and pulls out a box. She steps out of the room with a kind smile, closing the door quietly behind her. Steve takes a deep breath and slides a shaking finger under the flap; quickly, he reads and follows the instructions. He washes his hands, leaves the bathroom to sit by Nat on the bed. He’s grateful for the fact that she allows him to cling to her hand while they wait. When the time is up, he turns to her with pleading eyes, and she gives him an amused smile but doesn’t comment as she goes into the bathroom to check the result.
“Sir, I must advise against the use of the Iron Man suit in such an intoxicated state.”
“Of course I don’t,” Mal, the woman from earlier, snaps.
He offered her his arm, helped her to sit on a plush pillow at the head of table. He then poured her a cup of fragrant tea and handed her a china plate bearing a flaky pastry; even in the dim light of a dozen flickering candles, Steve can see it's clearly the most beautiful of the treats, perfectly golden and fluffy. Once everyone had a pastry and cup of tea, the group ate in silence, only speaking to ask for something to be passed. Eira cleared away the dishes, and Havardr placed the pork in the centre of the table and handed Steve a carving knife. Thankfully, Tony wrapped his hand over Steve’s around the handle and helped him to cut off a decent-sized chunk of meat. Frigga dipped her head in appreciation when the plate is set in front of her. Steve barely tasted what he ate, too nervous about the impending events.
Steve swipes a hand over his face and is shocked to feel tears on his cheeks. “Sorry. I’m sorry.”
The chuckle slips out against Tony’s will, but he does as he’s oh-so-politely instructed. He keeps his movements cautious, gently rocks his hips, shallow push-pulls, until Steve’s babbling, a steady stream of “please, Tony, faster, harder, oh God, yes.” He kisses Steve once more and snaps his hips forward. Steve clenches around his cock; Tony moans, moves faster, thrusts harder. The sound of skin against skin is obscene, drowning out the man singing
One particularly bad night prevents Steve from being able to stay peacefully in bed. He spends four hours tossing and turning before giving up with a frustrated sigh. He throws back his blankets, clambers out of bed, and pulls on a pair of sleep-pants. He walks slowly through the corridors of the residential floors, staring at each of the symbols on the doors ー a small black spider on a red circular background, a purple bow against black, a lightning bolt behind a realistic etching of Mjolnir… His lips twitch at the green squared fist, a beaker with three tiny circles on the knuckles, on Bruce’s door. Steve isn’t paying much attention to where his feet are taking him, so he stumbles to a stop, confused and surprised to see that he’s standing outside the dark glass walls of the workshop.
A knock sounds on Steve's door later that evening, once Bucky is in his section of the rooms, locked down and away from others; the rest of the team is watching movies, celebrating the win by being together. Steve sets his charcoal down, brushes his hands on a scrap piece of cloth, and crosses the room. Tony stands on the other side of the door.
“Yeah, that might work,” the man concedes through an enormous yawn.
“You better, punk. And I better get my car back in one piece.”
“Isn’t as important to me as you are.”
Steve doesn’t wait for Tony to comply, just grabs his wrist and places his hand. Tony feels nothing but the movements of Steve’s breathing. He sighs, closes his eyes again; he is nearly asleep again when his brain registers the new sensation against his palm. His head pops up, and he stares at Steve’s belly. The small rippling motion happens once more a moment later. He drags his gaze to his partner’s face.
“I feel like I’m seeing more of Stark than I should.”
The light blue cotton panties are snug but comfortable. Steve doesn’t know why, but he’s surprised that they fit so perfectly. Nat has to help him with the bra; he’s never been good with the clasps. She barely gets it done up before she’s pulling it back off, replacing it with a different one. The second doesn’t dig into his skin; it’s still uncomfortable, though. The rest of the dressing process is a study in trial and error: The jeans she passes over are the correct size, but the first shirt he pulls on is both too tight and too low-cut. Thankfully, she agrees that it shows off too much cleavage and gives him another. He slides his (now smaller) feet into a pair of shoes she calls “flats” and inspects his reflection. He has to admit – he looks decent, even with the lost expression on his face.

“We did. This is new, so new, in fact, that I found out five minutes ago on accident.”
Steve stares at him intently; Tony resists the urge to squirm under the scrutiny. Finally, Steve’s expression softens, and he smiles that sweet, understanding smile that Tony loves so much.
Tony stares at Steve, his expression unchanging, but then he slowly exhales and nods succinctly. “Okay. That, that's something I'll learn to deal with. Hey, maybe I’ll even go to therapy, Pepper's been hounding me about that for a long time now. Anyway. What should we do?”
Tony stops by Steve’s art studio one evening, fully expecting the pregnant blond to still be there like his text message said. Instead, all Tony finds is an empty room. He examines the latest bit of work on the easel, smiles at the obvious shape of the arc reactor, and asks JARVIS to locate Steve. The AI takes a moment before answering.
His harsh gasp breaks the silence of the early morning as Steve sits up abruptly in his bed. The sheets tangle around his legs, tearing when he jerks his way out of them. He stares down at the scraps, near-shadows in the dim lighting coming from the windows. His heart pounds in his chest, and his blood rushes in his ears. He barely manages to hear JARVIS inquiring about his status over the chaos in his brain.
“I’m sorry, but can you please watch Peter for a bit? There’s an e-m-e-r-g-e-n-c-y, and I can’t take him with me, I’ll explain later, thanks. Hurt my kid, and I’ll kill you.”
“So why are you hiding out in here instead of being in bed with your pregnant boyfriend?” inquires Pepper after she’s swallowed her first bite.
“Hush, it's fine. We just saw each other a few days ago.” Steve crosses the room, sits on the edge of the desk; his feet don't touch the ground when he gets comfortable. “I just… I missed you. I'm okay. Got another gallery opening on Friday night. You could, uh, you could come if you want.”
Tony sounds exhausted, but there’s a smile in his voice. Steve shifts to get more comfortable.
“Because,” the child sobs into his father’s neck, “I shouldn’t’a told you about the pizza, and you wouldn’t be fighting with Steve!”
“You okay, Cap?”
“Steve ー”
Well, this is it - the final chapter. I've enjoyed writing this fic so much, and I hope you've enjoyed reading it. There
“You should ask him out,” announces Natasha, and Steve chokes on his coffee at the non-sequitur, considering the conversation had firmly been on the drama that comes from a project affiliated with Alexander Pierce.
… … … …
… … … …
“Uh, what?”
Tony sends back a peace sign emoji, and Steve sets his phone down. It’s nearing five o’clock, which is just as well, since he can no longer concentrate on his comic. He packs up, waves goodbye to his coworkers, and heads out. As he walks down the sidewalk, he scrolls through his contacts until he gets to his ma’s number.
“You.”
Somehow, Peter finds out about the cookout and is beyond excited. Steve thinks that maybe Pepper was told by Tony ー they are still close, after all ー and let it slip to their child, and his suspicions are confirmed when she and Happy drop Peter off that Friday. As soon as Tony has his son in the other room, Pepper gives Steve a smile, moves around the kitchen like it’s not unusual for her to rummage around her ex’s apartment. She manages to find a box of tea in the back of a cupboard, sniffing surreptitiously at it before turning it over to check the Best By date; deeming it acceptable, she fills a mug with hot water from the tap and sets a bag in the cup.
“I want to have a kid with you,” Steve rushes out before he can stop himself.
“So far, there haven’t been any leads, no eyewitnesses. But you, ma’am, are the last person he was in contact with, who would have had any reason to attack him. Can you tell us where you were between midnight and one o’clock this morning?”
“I–I think so. Uh, Tony?”
Tony is unable to remember a time he’s ever been this happy. It certainly never happened when he was a child, and as an adult, the only ‘happiness’ he found was fabricated with drugs, alcohol, and the revolving door of never-ending bed partners. Falling in love had never been in the plans, especially not falling in love with
“What, marriage with you?”
“Can I, Cap?” he grits out shakily, but his arms are steady.
A pale, slender hand places a glass of chocolate milk on the coffee table. Steve gives Loki a thankful smile before turning his attention back to the television. Dozens of celebrities are stepping out of their vehicles, smiling and posing for pictures, answering questions that are being shouted at them. Steve has been waiting (im)patiently for half an hour for a specific limo to appear on the screen. Once the guy who looks like Steve (if Steve had dark hair and a beard) disappears inside, cameras turn until the next vehicle is in focus.
“Don’t thank me yet. We still don’t know if this will even work. Just…please, keep it in mind that it may end up being a case where we adopt.”
Tony smiles and puts his phone down. Unfortunately, within minutes, his brain is wandering away from the board meeting and toward new designs for the armour, weapons systems for the War Machine, upgrades to make the holographic interfaces even faster and easier to use. The meeting ends, thankfully without Tony dying of boredom; he waits until the last board member leaves the room before turning to Pepper. She has a contemplative, appraising expression on her face and a soft smile on her red lips.
“You might need bail money set aside.”
The words are said nonchalantly, but he has the air of a man both uncomfortable and uneasy with whatever answer he might receive. The four-year-old, however, stares up at Steve with wide, pleading eyes. Steve finds he cannot say no; he drags his gaze from Peter's hopeful face to his father's.
Steve laughs softly. “As tempting as that is, I’m gonna have to veto that option. Just – just finish up there, then come home. Any idea how long it’ll take?”
“What's going on, Thor?” When he receives no answer, Steve turns to the other two. “Guys, can you clear out?”
He comes back to reality and blinks until there’s only one Steve standing beside him. “Sorry, thinking.”
“Of course. Mister Sitwell has a ten a.m. block open, if that would work?”
“Petey-bug, I am always going to love you, even if I don't marry your daddy. Always.”
The door closes with a quiet click, and Steve thanks JARVIS when the lights come up to a moderate level. His body aches from the long drive, and he’s honestly physically exhausted. He drops his duffel bag to the floor, makes his way to the kitchen to get some food. The expiry dates on the food in the fridge are different, he notices and pulls out the carton of eggs. After eating in the echoing silence, he checks the time; it’s almost two in the morning, so Steve knows he should go to bed. But he can’t. He ends up sprawled across the sofa, watching some awful “reality” television shows, as the hours tick past.
on the casing, and the rhythm is sporadic, inharmonious, and the motions aren't as soothing or comforting as they were before. He watches Steve closely, focuses on the tightness around his eyes, the way his lips purse just that much more, the way his chest rises and falls with rapid breaths.
“If you’ll excuse me, gentlemen. As much as I
“I – Look, Steve, I needed an unbiased opinion. You’re dead-set on following through with this, and I, I get it. I get
“Ma, how do you give a child a bath?”
Tony watches Steve’s shoulders slump under the redhead’s hand. She leans into his side, rests her head against his bicep.
There’s no indication that the lift has stopped except for the doors sliding open smoothly. Steve follows Miss Potts out of the elevator and down a short hallway, her heels clicking with a measured rhythm on the dark marble. The living room she leads him into is empty and quiet, almost eerily so, but Steve pays attention as she gives him a tour of the communal areas. His head is spinning; he’s been here once before, when they apprehended Loki, but that was up in the penthouse which certainly hadn’t come across as this homey. He realises belatedly that Miss Potts has continued on and hurries to catch up with her on the staircase.
. The sound of a rapid heartbeat begin to play, and Steve leans against Tony, feeling at peace for the first time in days. They stare at the sonogram without speaking for a few minutes.
) but Steve can’t find it in him to deny the bots anything. Clint calls it good practise for when the baby arrives.
The pointed look she gives him speaks volumes; Steve nods dumbly, slowly stepping back until he bumps into Sam. Clint latches a hand into the shoulder plate of the armour, and though his tugging has no physical effect, Tony does as he's asked after making sure Sharon and the other SHIELD agents are arresting Zemo.
“There was less to assist with on Asgard than I was led to believe.”
“Good thing I wasn’t talking about money.”
“Yes, duh, the text, did you mean it?”
Steve gasps into the kiss at the searing hot that skitters across his flesh, emanating from the centre of his chest, and his head falls back at the dizzying emotions he’s feeling ー not all his, no, but he can’t make heads nor tails of where
A soft knock sounds at the door, and Natasha’s voice comes through, gentle and non-confrontational like he is a wounded animal she doesn’t want to startle.
It isn’t much, but it’s enough for Steve. His mark pulsates with the desire he feels, the need for the connection and touch and Tony. Tony shifts, and Steve lets the other man push him until he’s lying flat on his back. Tony’s fingers are cool, feather-light, when he slips them under the hem of Steve’s shirt. Steve bites down on his tongue hard to prevent himself from laughing; Tony seems to understand why Steve is struggling to keep his amusement locked up, because he wiggles his fingers along Steve’s skin. Steve can’t fight it any more. He bursts into laughter and tries to squirm away from Tony’s tickling, but Tony doesn’t allow him to escape, rapidly moving so that he’s straddling Steve’s hips. Steve reaches up with one hand, tugging Tony down so Steve can brush their lips together. Tony exhales sharply, and Steve takes it as permission. He wraps his hand around the back of Tony’s neck, the other hand cupping his ass. Tony’s hips jerk forward as his mouth opens for Steve.
“Yeah, uh, about that…”
right
Steve swipes at his cheeks, a watery laugh escaping when U rolls over with a box of tissues in his claw. “Thanks, U. Um, tell her I’ll be there in a moment, please, JARVIS.”
“I'm going to assume you don't have liquor, so water's fine.”
It isn't until an incessant beeping sounds in the room, louder than
“Yeah, had a double-date with Peter's mom and her boyfriend last night. Didn't get home until about eleven-thirty.”
“It needs more.”
“What about Delilah?” he whispers when they finally part for air, regardless of the fact he wants nothing less than to ask about her.
“Hey, let her go.” A woman, not much older than Tony, steps up to Steve's side, glaring at the other man. “No one has the right to grab another person without permission. Now scram.”
until Steve starts to drift off to sleep as he leaned into Tony’s side.
before disappearing into the elevator.
“'kay?”
“No, you don’t.”
acquiesces, lets Tony set the pace - unless he's pissed off about something. Loki, on the other hand, pushes back, he initiates deepening the kiss, and his tongue tangles with Tony's forcefully. The plushness of his lips, the shape of his teeth, the taste are all Steve, but the style is anything but.
“Can I ask who it's from?”
“What the Hell do you think you are doing?”
called for a spacious room. This is the opposite of spacious. Guess I’m just glad I’m not claustrophobic.”
He’s just spent the last twenty minutes being cornered by Natasha, being questioned about what Pepper knows. He managed to escape by promising extra sparring lessons if he’s lying. Thankfully, he knows he isn’t, so there’s no risk of him getting his ass kicked more than necessary. If he didn’t know better, he’d think she didn’t trust him.
Steve inhales deeply and holds it until he feels less shaky. He lets the breath out at a controlled pace, decides on a course of action. “Okay. Can you send me the list again but this time organised by category?”
“Allow me, since you're my date. This time.”
“Sorry I’m late, peaches. Pepper waylaid me. Apparently I forgot to sign some pretty important papers.”
Steve smiles and cups Tony's jaw with a hand, guiding his head until their lips meet again, this time sweeter and less hurried, soft drags of their lips; he chuckles quietly at the muffled moan Tony makes low in his throat. “Hi.”
“I usually am. Now, c’mon. We have successfully prevented a potentially fatal catastrophe. We should definitely celebrate, preferably by being naked in our bed for the next, oh, six to seven hours.”
Bucky is rooting through the cabinets when Steve enters the kitchen. A crisp white envelope sits in the middle of the table, Steve’s name written in an unfamiliar scrawl; it’s thick, full, and Steve has a good idea that he knows who it’s from and what’s in it.
It's a sign of how accustomed Steve is to Tony's personality that he doesn't question the change in subject, doesn't take the inquiry as a slight against his choice of location. He concentrates, and two steaming cups of coffee appear before them. Tony cackles delightedly, takes one.
“He has something he wishes to discuss with you.”
when you’re in the workshop.
“Internet, man. Hard not to know when it’s all anybody can talk about.” Sam shrugs, taking a bite of his apple. "They think it 'cause out of nowhere, you two disappear from the public eye for months, and when you come back, there's suddenly this new person who's there each and every time."
Bucky laughs, claps Steve on the shoulder, and leads the blond to the door. “Call me later, okay?”
“The coldest.” Tony burrows closer. “I swear he was asleep when I got in.”
Tony relaxes minutely, though his shoulders don’t completely fall to a natural position. "I'll find someone who can do it."
Tony pokes his head out of the bathroom, toothbrush dangling from his mouth. “Wha?”
That conversation in the workshop seems to act as a catalyst: Tony allows Steve to come to the workshop whenever he wants, no matter if Tony is there or not. There’s even a portion of the workshop ー small and out of the way ー that Tony has set up for Steve to work on art if he wants. The time spent there is usually quiet, peaceful, and Steve appreciates being able to be there if Tony needs help with heavy lifting. There is even one holoscreen devoted specifically to tracking Bucky’s movements; Steve doesn’t try to go after him, as much as he wants to. He knows Bucky will just keep running and Steve will just keep falling behind. But to be able to see tiny white dots show up on the map of where he’s been is almost comforting. Steve finds himself getting distracted from what he’s doing whenever Tony is around, too intent on listening to the man ramble or too busy staring at the way his eyes light up when he’s excited, darken when he’s upset. Often, Steve has to force himself to ignore the urge, the desire, to cup Tony’s cheek in his hand and kiss him speechless. His nightmares have given way to dreams of what could be but never will.
The rest of the day passes without event. The officers call shortly before dinner, relaying the news that Mr Greene is refusing to discuss what happened and will not be pressing charges. Natasha looks relieved, even though she really had nothing to do with the attack. Sam and Thor make a delicious roast chicken (or five, judging by the fact the platter doesn’t seem to empty) that’s devoured in record time; the team, including the Asgardians, watch reruns of
“But it's staring, it's watching me do this –” Tony thrust hard, causing Steve's breath to hitch. “– and this –” Here, he folded himself enough to latch onto the sensitive skin below Steve's jaw. “– and this.”
The lock disengages with a soft
when a small dot appears in the centre of the room. It's tiny, unobtrusive, and it doesn't catch anyone's attention at first. Not until it grows in diameter, becoming less of a black circle and more of a blinding, gaping chasm in the air. Clint yelps, falls backwards off the counter that he's perched on, and Tony's suddenly on his feet, his watch expanding to become a gauntlet over his hand, and he aims the gleaming repulsor at the hole. Natasha crouches with twin blades in hand, and Bruce hurtles out of the room so that he doesn't Hulk out before he's needed. Mjølnir flies across the room and into Thor's outstretched hand. Steve stands side by side with Tony; he doesn't have his shield, doesn't have any weapons, but he's proficient enough with hand-to-hand combat, could probably assist with taking down whatever is about to come through. Sam has a knife in one hand, a throw pillow in the other.
“Wait. How do you know about the Raft?”
Steve laughs and stands. “I hate to run, but I gotta get back to work. Am I picking Peter up?”
“Yes,” laughs Steve, “yes, they did. Never thought I'd see the day.”
, Stark, a magnet for trouble, even when he’s locked in medical. He has zero self-preservation skills. He was shot by Coulson after he landed on SHIELD’s radar. I damn near slit his throat when, instead of killing me as ordered, he decided to try to recruit me, to get me out of the Red Room. He falls out of buildings without having any sort of backup plan. What would make him think any of that is him turning out ‘pretty okay’? What would make him think I’d find that comforting
The portal appears with a wave of her hand, and between one blink and the next, she's gone, and there is no evidence of her presence. Steve's cheeks are hot, her words echoing in his mind; he avoids looking to his left to see if Tony's as gobsmacked as he is, but judging by everyone else's expressions, he's definitely not the only one reeling. The silence stretches, breaking only when someone clears their throat from behind the couch.
Steve shrugs, hunches in on himself. “Couldn’t sleep.”
is here, sitting as far away from the archer's bare feet as possible on the sofa. Steve remains in the doorway. His arms are crossed over his torso. The only one not in the room to witness Tony making a fool of himself is Bruce (he declined Sam's excited invitation by claiming he has a time-sensitive experiment, the lucky bastard).
“I don’t want to do something you’re not comfortable with.”
Clint sighs and drops his head against the backrest of the couch. “I still hate him.”
Tablet in hand, Tony makes his way to the sunroom, an enclosed balcony that was refurbished with heating and cooling, comfortable patio furniture, and everything else anyone might want or need. He’s just spent the last hour with Steve in his arms, reassuring his partner that he isn’t going anywhere. Every time Tony was sure Steve was asleep and tried to slip out of the bed, Steve would wake up panicking. Thankfully, the last attempt was successful. Tony has work to do for SI before Pepper gets on his ass for missing a deadline.
Thor has tried quite a few times to speak to Steve; none of the attempts have been exactly successful. Every time he sees the god, Steve is reminded of that damn candle and makes a hasty escape before the awkward embarrassment can overwhelm him. Loki wears a knowing smile on his lips whenever these interactions occur.
“What the –?”
“We need to make sure thisー this dream or vision or whatever, doesn't actually happen,” Steve announces, and the others nod or murmur their agreement. “I think we need to draft a version of the, what were they called?, Accords that we can live with.”
“Yes, well, having the same fear of screwing up the baby’s life tends to bring people closer together.” Natasha shrugs nonchalantly, though Tony can see how much the admission pains her. “Between how I was trained and his childhood…”
Tony grips Steve’s hand as the door swings shut. “You’re doing great, darling.”
"Can't tell you, Daddy, it's our secret!"
“It's okay. You're here now.”
“Going up?”
They stop in the doorway to the kitchen. Tony's shoulders start shaking, his breath wheezing out through tightly-pressed lips, and Steve gapes at the sight of a fully-costumed Spiderman crawling across the ceiling. In the blink of an eye, Peter drops down, his web holding securely to the ceiling, and steals the last wonton and spring roll off of Natasha's plate. She moves far more slowly than Steve knows she's capable of, feigns that she is going to stab Peter’s hand with a chopstick, but she's laughing the rare, real laugh that she only lets loose when she's comfortable, feeling safe. Everyone is talking, arguing good-naturedly, eating and sharing the food, and Steve's chest burns with the warmth of so much love for this insane, reckless, wonderful family he's made. Tony squeezes his hand, and Steve smiles widely back, pulling Tony along as he joins the group at the table.
“So it’s been an hour, and, really, I should be commended for the fact that I haven’t blown up your phone in my panic, because Steve? I’m panicking really fucking bad right now. Just… please call me? I really, really don’t want to have fucked this all up. Please tell me this isn’t over.”
Tony shrugs uncomfortably. He knew Steve would question the decision, but he hadn’t counted on feeling so awkward and clumsy when it came to explaining. He keeps his gaze on Sarah as he speaks.
He doesn’t reply to Tony, instead rolling over and climbing off the bed. His legs tremble slightly but are steady enough to carry him to the bathroom where he wets a washcloth. Tony hasn’t moved except to throw an arm over his eyes by the time Steve comes back. He wipes Tony’s abdomen and groin clean of drying come. Not bothering to waste more energy, he tosses the rag onto the nightstand and curls around Tony’s body.
The steady
“I hate you so much,” Steve announces, laughing as he locks his phone screen and sets the device on his desk. “What's up?”
, because where you are is, it's home for me. I ain't got much, not since Ma died, but I thought I had you.”
"It is wonderful to see you both again."
“I'm here to pick up Peter.”
“It’s all right, I promise.”
“Why are you all here?”
Steve is in his studio when Tony finally finds him later that night. His canvas is empty, though his fingers cradle a paintbrush. Tony steps up behind him, wrapping his around Steve's slender shoulders, pressing his nose to the long silky locks.
… … … …
Steve hands him a champagne glass. “Hey, sweetheart.”
“I’m a master at hiding it. But seriously, did you really expect me to be upset? You’ve left on business trips before.”
I’m pissed, Tony! I’ve spent the last god knows how many hours searching for you everywhere while trying to keep the company running smoothly, not letting anyone know you were nowhere to be found, and oh, that’s right – trying to comfort your boyfriend, who is understandably upset because we couldn’t find you and JARVIS wasn’t giving us any answers, so we thought maybe he was malfunctioning or hacked, which seemed more than likely when my override code, nor James’s, didn’t work. And all this time, all I had to do was
, intensifies, and his legs give out from under him.
“I know, I’m so proud,” Tony sighs, pretends to wipe a tear from his eye. “What’d you tell Thor?”
“I said it’s fine. If anyone says that I look uncomfortable, I’m sure Louisa can spin it as I’m just incredibly nervous or something.”
“Pepper called me,” says Phil as soon as the door is closed behind Steve. “Is he okay?”
“You look amazing,” he breathes out before darting forward to press a soft kiss to Steve's lips. “Damn, Iー I had something to say, but you made me dumb, with you looking like that, anyway, hi, sorry I'm late.”
“Sure, what’s up?”
“Tony, we’re having lunch with Louisa today.”
The person swears loudly as the back of their head slams into the edge of the fridge; Steve winces at the sight ー there’s no way that doesn’t hurt. He can feel heat rushing into his cheeks when the person turns around. Tony raises a brow and pops a cube of cheddar into his mouth, chewing slowly.
“What's wrong, embarrassed that he caught me coming out of your room?”
“Um, no, I don't, but trust me, he'll want to see me.”
He looks away to give her some semblance of privacy as she swipes at her eyes. The smile she gives him is small and watery, but it’s
His fingers shaking, Steve slides the lock out of its place, pulls the door open slowly, and hesitatingly glances at the device. Tony's face is on the screen, tired and pinched with tension, but his eyes hold a glimmer of humour.
Loki clasps his hands behind his back, gives Steve a small smile, and falls silent. Steve kneads at his forehead with one hand and pulls his phone from his pocket with the other.
“It’s necessary. Ajax, the Abomination, Vanko… No ordinary prison would hold them. The world needs the Raft to keep them contained.”
“No. I can’t.”
“No, he is not, but you are more than welcome to go into the workshop if you would like. I assure you that you are allowed in there and that everything confidential or proprietary is locked away and cannot be accessed by anyone other than Sir.”
staring at you. Now, stop – stop focusing on the candle!”
Steve laughs softly as he presses his thumbs into a particularly knotted muscle in Tony's back. “I won't, promise. And Petey-bug will get better soon, this won't last forever.”
“Steve?”
would be the product of our family going a bit overboard at the news.”
Tony. Steve keeps the scenery as ones he knows Tony has always loved ー the beach where they first met, the garden, a spacious field of freshly-mowed grass under a navy sky full of fireworks and dotted with stars. Tony doesn't show, though. So Steve starts leaving the scenes as places he himself knows, that bring him comfort. It never feels right, not without Tony, but Steve keeps the door open for the other man. Just in case.
Steve nods without hesitation, and Tony presses a kiss to his forehead before sitting back on his heels. The position affords Steve the opportunity to stare openly at the man, the sharp lines of his body smoothed out by muscle and some fat, the brilliance of the arc reactor illuminating the angles of his jaw. Steve can’t believe he’s this lucky; he stretches out an arm to drag a finger along the side of Tony’s thigh, the skin smooth and hair soft under his touch. Tony glances over at him, smiles, and resumes digging through the basket. He comes up with a bottle and a square packet. When he’s done, he turns to Steve and holds out a throw pillow.
“You have no self-preservation skills,” she retorts with a soft laugh. “But no, I meant, are you scared of being a father? Of raising a child?”
He ends the call, hurries upstairs to the penthouse. The sound of whimpering forces him even faster, and he nearly runs into the closed door in his rush. Tony flings the door open, catching sight of the bed within seconds.
"Babe, what happened?"
“I saw the universe,” Tony whispers just as softly. “I saw galaxies and nebulas and other worlds. I saw…
“Yeah, I think I figured that out somewhere between Pepper giving me a very delicate wake-up call, JARVIS being such a chatterbox, and now this so relaxing and peaceful workout.”
A knock startles Steve around six o'clock, and he checks that Peter is still resting before he crosses the living room and peeks through the peephole. An unfamiliar man stands on the other side of the door. Steve hesitates before opening the door a crack, using his body as a barricade.
Steve lays back, closing his eyes, breathing in deeply and exhaling slowly. The urgency fades away, the frustration loses its edge, as he consciously relaxes each of his muscles; when he feels less like he’s being turned inside out, he calls out for JARVIS to play just the audio. His gut clenches hotly at the first sound of Tony’s breathless moan. Steve slides a hand between his legs, forces himself to focus on the sensations rather than the end goal.
Noon finds Steve walking out the door of SHIELD, pacing the parking lot two, three, four times before he makes up his mind. He's grateful that it isn't too hot outside as he makes his way down the sidewalk; he doesn't want to arrive sweaty, red-faced, and stinking.
“Is that…?”
Thankfully, Tony is laughing even as he reaches for a napkin from the dispenser at the end of the table. Steve swiftly pushes it further away from Tony’s grasping fingers. They calm a bit after a few minutes, and that’s only because the waitress is back with Tony’s plate in hand, and Steve watches the other diners as Tony takes a bite of his burger. There’s the low hum of appliances, the hiss of the percolator on the counter, the buzz of soft conversation, and it’s relaxing. When Tony sets his burger back on his plate, he swallows and sighs heavily.
“Tony told him about magic.”
“I don’t. I mean it. It was amazing.”
s, and the smell of their sweat. Steve wraps a hand around his own cock, stroking in time to Tony’s movements, being pushed forward into his hand and pushing back onto Tony’s cock. Four, five more strokes, and Steve comes again, spilling over his hand and onto the blanket beneath him. His arms tremble from the release, and it takes all he has not to collapse right then and there, not while Tony is still moving inside of him. Tony’s thrusts become erratic, less rhythmic, and he leans forward, bites down on Steve’s shoulder, and muffles his shout into Steve’s skin; his hips push forward once, twice, and finally still as they’re pressed tightly against Steve’s ass.
“You saw me this morning, you freak,” replies Tony, even as he stretches up to tug Steve back down into another kiss. “I missed you, too.”
Steve follows, laughing. His heart is thumping wildly in his chest, and he feels almost giddy with ecstasy as they leave the office. Workers do double-takes when Steve and Tony pass, but Tony’s attention is far from them. His hand finds Steve’s, and Steve allows him to lead the way.
Steve goes to bed!” Tony calls out over the cheers and laughter from their friends – their
Now, after hours of trying to figure out what to do with Rhodey as a sounding board, Tony is still as confused as before. His best friend had been no help (“I don’t like the fact this requires that psychotic asshole, but Tones, you wanna make Steve happy more than anything, which means nothing I say is gonna make a damn bit of difference”); sure, he should talk to Steve about this, as Rhodey was so kind to point out, but when Steve is involved, Tony isn’t logical. Pepper may be right: Tony tends to fixate on the object of his desires. She claims that, with all of his abandonment and daddy issues, he’s a therapist’s wet dream. He knows the description is accurate – for the most part.
Steve carefully lays a sleeping Peter on the couch and walks quietly into the kitchen for a kid-sized cup of water; once that's done, he detours to the small backpack on the floor by the door, grabbing the orange, stuffed pig from its depths. He sets the cup on the coffee table and tucks Piggly under Peter's arm. He waits a moment, debating, then decides he needs to get medicine into Peter to lower his fever. He keeps his door and Tony's open as he hurriedly searches for a thermometer and children's ibuprofen in the drawers. Medication and thermometer in hand, he rushes back to his own apartment, taking a second to make sure Tony's apartment is locked up again.
“Where’s Natasha?”
He sends back
“Neither was I! He completely blindsided me with it.”
“Excuse me, Mr Wilson, but I would do no such thing.”
“Speaking of Stark, have you talked to him about what you want?”
"I only open my date's doors, sorry."
“Legs?”
“Don’t get your hopes up.”
“He, uh, she's his guardian. And I don't think he wants her knowing what's going on.”
“Have

“Not a problem. Tell Peter we hope he feels better soon.”
Thor, Loki, two members of Frigga’s court, and Dum-E stand in the middle of the workshop. True to Tony’s word, the bot is holding the bright red canister, nozzle aimed at the dark-haired demigod. Loki, surprisingly, doesn’t look a bit worried at the prospect of being coated with the mixture. Steve stifles a laugh, nods to the pair of unfamiliar Asgardians, and turns his focus to the brothers.
Clint puts on an innocent expression, turns wide eyes in Phil’s direction. “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about, Sir.”
“Uh, yeah?”
“I dunno, seems like everyone has a ‘but’ when they say something like that.”

“Well, yeah.”

Pepper kisses his cheek and dabs at her eyes with a tissue. Natasha’s embrace is quick but warm, full of unspoken emotions. He squeezes her hand gently then turns to head back to the room. His body feels lighter than it has in years; he can’t stop smiling. He stops outside the nursery window, searches for his baby. She’s asleep in the plastic bassinet, swaddled in the blankets the hospital provided.
