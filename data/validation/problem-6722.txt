Steve trails behind, reluctant to leave Tony alone despite his earlier warning. He feels hollowed out, like last night had carved him open and left his skin on wrong. He wishes, desperately, that Tony would let him touch him. That he could talk to him. He wants to talk about what happened. He wants to ask Tony if that was only because he was intoxicated, or if all this time, he could have reached out and touched-
Steve takes the offered device, glancing between it and her. Pepper doesn’t wait for an answer, instead moving to throw open the double wide doors and step through into the conference room.
“But don’t you think the accusations of personal bias are valid, considering Ambassador McCoy’s ties to Doctor Charles Xavier and the so-called X-Men?”
Steve in this series. I was trying to show that this whole time Steve is trying really hard to correct his own false assumptions, but Tony is wholly in denial about being Sight Bonded and who Steve is because he doesn’t
“You took a lot of samples. Blood, gland swabs, pheromone readings. You’re welcome to do all the tests you want and publish a paper when I’m dead,” Tony offered, and Steve turned to scowl at him.
Tony swallows, taps his fingers on the arc reactor. “Doesn’t seem like anybody’s giving me much credit these days,” he sneers. He’s not bitter about it. He’s not.
Steve clears his throat and glances around. Tony, thankfully, is not in any sort of compromising position. His shirt’s off. He’s standing at the sink, his torso twisted around as he tries to see the back of his own neck. He touches the skin there, frowning, and Steve reaches out to try and meet his fingers, to touch the place where his hand was. This time, his hand pushes straight through, fingers dipping under Tony’s skin.
“Mr. Odinson is off premises. Agent Barton is working on a backlog of mission reports, as Agent Hill threatened to break his compound bow if he didn’t file them by the end of the week. Agent Romanov is reading in her quarters. Doctor Banner is eating his first meal of the day, having only risen two hours prior. He did not go to sleep until late last night.”
Tony pauses with his hand on the knob, eyes fixed on the small crack between the frame and the door. He takes a breath, measuring his next words. “You know, as a pretty good liar myself, I know any good lie has a grain of truth in it. I think your problem is that you’ve forgotten how to measure your own bullshite.”
Tony doesn’t know how long he sits numbly, abandoned and alone, on an ash-stained lounge chair on his broken balcony. He manages not to fall apart, but instead it seems that the only other alternative is numbness. He doesn’t know where to go from here. He couldn’t have imagined this outcome: that he would open up to Steve, and Steve would reject him so thoroughly. He’d thought Steve would have at least been polite about it.
“Tony wanted me to talk to you about options for counselling,” she says, suddenly all business. “I didn’t want to interrupt your down-time, after the trauma you’ve been through. Of course, SHIELD has excellent counselling services, and you can see any of the professionals we have on staff. I can give you their files and their CV’s. They are, of course, all sworn and legally bound to discretion.”
Tony swallows as a wave of indescribable emotion rises up, smothers him under the undeniable knowledge of how much this impossible man loves him. “Yeah. Okay.”
“I was up late chasing Croc through the sewers,” Peter continues, in typical Peter fashion, without really waiting for a response. “The suit smells like ass. Didn’t wanna go home. So I came here for decon. Want a waffle?”
“Yeah, did you have a plan for that?” Steve asks, raising an eyebrow at him. Tony wets his lips, tapping his fingers against the reactor casing. It’s a terrible nervous habit, but he can’t help himself. It’s been a long couple of weeks.
Steve blinked, tilting his head up to look at Tony, and his face was all joy and brightness. “Marry me, Anthony Edward Stark,” he said, and his voice was firm, loud, filled with laughter. “Marry me, and make me impossibly happier than you already do.”
Steve kisses him, and Tony’s brain races, churning faster and faster until it sparks out entirely. His brain becomes white noise. Steve kisses him, and kisses him, and kisses him again; lush, drugging kisses that leave Tony breathless. He’s got a hand tangled tight in Steve’s collar, and Steve is sobbing into the kiss, and when he buries his face into the crook of Tony’s neck he’s shaking, his entire body feeling like it’s coming apart under Tony’s hands. Tony blinks into the dancing light of the flaming machinery, noting that his legs are around Steve’s waist. He releases his iron grip on Steve’s wrist to pat him on the back, confused and out of his depth.
Steve groans, and Tony tips him up so that the camera can see the fast-fading bruises marching all across his chest through the reflection in mirror. He reaches around and pinches one, revelling in the dazed, desperate look that Steve’s wearing. God, but he’s beautiful.
“Can I tell you a secret?” Steve asks him. He’s adorable, really, in a way that makes Tony wonder if it’s calculated. Steve is a masterful tactician, and Tony knows that he can’t possibly be as smooth as he acts half the time. The real Steve is such a dork. He suspects, actually, that much of Steve’s flirting is planned, but even if it is, he doesn’t mind at all. It’s flattering that Steve would try so hard.
Steve thinks. He doesn’t know what. Anything, to bridge the gap between them. He doesn’t think he could quite stomach an apology, but something, anything to smooth over the sharp edges of the horrible things he and Stark snarled at each other on the helicarrier. Before Stark flew a nuke into a wormhole and Steve thought,
The thing is, Tony’s heats are usually quite mild, likely as a result of his hormone imbalance. He’s not quite an omega, certainly not an alpha. He’s intersex, and so his heats have always been weak. It’s a blessing, really. Tony has always pitied the omegas who were stuck in bed for a week, unable to work. But for the past few days, all he’d be able to think about was how nice it would have been to spend the week being waited on hand and foot by a certain broad-shouldered, blue-eyed alpha with soft hands.
“I’m probably still in shock,” Tony admits. He settles into the bed, considering his hard-on. He’d kind of implied that he’d be touching himself while Steve was in the shower. Steve would most certainly be wanking while he was in there, but it feels vulgar doing it in his bed whilst the object of his desire is in the en suite. “
Tony grins. He’s always right. “Might kill you,” he murmurs into the silence of the helmet, and Loki smiles wickedly.
“Tony,” Steve said helplessly, and he could feel Tony’s smug, rumbling laugh against him. A warm kiss was pressed to the back of his neck, and then Tony pulled back, slow enough to give Steve a few moments to collect himself.
“Doctor Banner is sleeping. Protocols dictate I am only to wake him when it is absolutely necessary.”
“A young whippersnapper, huh?” Steve quips, and Jim snorts. “I was hoping you could tell me where Tony is.” Steve just comes right out and says it. He and Rhodes are, in some ways, the same kind of animal. He knows this is the best tactic to getting his help, and so he puts on his best gee-golly-shucks expression and rubs the back of his neck, saying, “I think he’s avoiding me.”
Steve moaned encouragingly, and it was now or never. Soon, Tony’s knot would swell to the point where Steve wouldn’t be able to pull off without either dislocating his jaw or severely injuring a part of Tony that he had no interest in damaging. Not that he ever wanted Tony hurt, no, but he was particularly fond of his cock in particular. God, how he wanted this.
“Clean, sir. He left of his own volition, and I cannot find anything remiss on the city’s security feeds.”
“Morning, beautiful,” he said, pouring out a cup of coffee. Tony offered him a sleepy smile, leaning in for a kiss that mostly missed Steve’s mouth. He took the mug from Steve’s hands with a low hum of pleasure.
It’s the smell of ozone that makes him pull away. Tony’s lips are red and swollen, his eyes half-lidded and slightly distant. He swipes the back of one hand over his mouth, and Steve watches the way it distorts his skin, a sharp shock of pleasure breaking through his easy haze and shooting straight down to his groin in a lightning bolt of physical awareness. He can feel all the places where Tony was sweetly vicious with his teeth, and he wishes for the first time that he could bruise, just a little. The thought of wearing a mark where someone could see, where other people could know he’d spent the afternoon necking on the roof like a kid, settles something warm and possessive in stomach. It kneads at the muscles there like little cat’s paws.
“Of whatever this thing you’re doing with Loki is,” Bruce clarifies, fixing him with a knowing look. Tony must look guilty, because Bruce furrows his brows. “Oh. He has something to be jealous of.”
“I’ll finish up here with SHIELD, help clear the last of the stragglers out,” Steve said, but Natasha was already shaking her head.
"He wants to negotiate the terms of his surrender," Tony says. The whole room turns to stare at him. "He came to visit me. I was eating an apple. We had some words."
Loki chuckles, low and patronising. “Tell me, Stark. Did you think I expected anything different? You and your Captain were circling each other like lions in heat long before I made a place for myself in your bed. I did not require the gift of sight to predict this outcome.” Which is just about what Tony had told Steve last night, but still. It’s a relief to hear it.
“You have no idea how many times I’ve thought about this,” Steve says, burying his face into the crease of Tony’s thigh. His breath tickles and tantalises all at once. “You- God, your
Steve sits in the empty common room for a long while after she’s gone. The sun is starting to sink in the sky, painting the landscape in hues of orange and gold, and Steve stares lazily out the window and watches it weave behind skyscrapers, disappearing and reappearing as it floats towards the horizon. When his mind flashes to Tony falling, it’s not even a surprise. He knows what it is to have combat exhaustion at this point in his life.
Tony would react to that, if he wasn’t completely paralysed by the pain that bursts open in his chest like a blooming flower. Tony has left his body. Tony isn’t even here.
“Think about it. She’s the best of us at espionage. We wouldn’t suspect her, doubly because of heteronormativity. Hell, triply, because we all know she’s never had a positive female influence in her entire life. She’s too good a spy, Steve.”
“I do not like to admit limitations to my programming, Captain, but I think you already know I am not the unbiased party my original programming might suggest me to be in this matter.”
"Come here, Tones." Steve didn't bother looking away from Fury as he addressed Tony, waiting for his best friend to come stand behind him.
If there was one word Tony could be associated with, without a doubt, it would have to be affectionate.
"Why for didst thou bring-eth this child, Lord Stark?" Clint mocked with a smirk, taking a sip of his coffee.
. I didn't think you would approve of anything like that." Tony finished explaining and hoped he hadn't fucked anything up between them with his stupid excuses, even if they were for good reasons.
Nat smirked at them and shook her head. The stack she'd brought was a new mission file for Steve to go over. SHIELD wanted him and Natasha to do a small recon mission to gather information, but seeing as how they would be in enemy territory it was always a good idea to bring Captain America along for back-up. It was considered high profile, critical need for extra support, hence the call for Steve to go as well.
Doom roared in anger, reaching into his armor to pull out a small device. Before Tony or any one else could react fast enough, Doom tossed the device right at the Ironman armor, creating a shock that traveled through the metal.
"Tones?" he hesitated, slowly reaching to remove the face mask of the armor. As he was fighting with the latch, Steve suddenly heard Tony's muffled voice from inside the armor, clearly irritated.
That said, the one thing he desperately wanted to change was his relationship with his genius. It was no secret that Captain America and Ironman were an item, it was all over the front page tabloids for months. Tony had always laughed it off, claiming Captain America was quite the catch. Nothing was ever actually said, but it was obvious they were together...they had a child for God's sake...
"And that's my cue to sign off because I have a lunch date with my Captain. Give 'em Hell, work hard, make me proud!" Tony smiled innocently at Pepper, blowing a kiss at her before signing off on the call.
"I can't help it!" Tony wailed. "Though if I'm being honest I only watch it for Benedict Cumberbatch."
Smiling at his two little geniuses, Steve gently covered them both with blankets from the back of the couch, settling in for the night.
"We should get back and inform SHIELD that Sandman is taken care of and in need of containment," Nat spoke up, checking her phone. "SHIELD already has a clean-up crew heading our way."
Tony pulled against the arms holding him back, "You try that and I'll drop the fucking Helicarrier into the Atlantic,
"It's good to be home..." he sighed quietly, running his fingers through Tony's dark locks. He wasn't sure he could do these type of missions anymore, not when he had a family waiting for him at home. The team was still his family, that would never change, but he had Peter to think about too. It was bad enough that Pete was a super hero in his own right, but at least he wasn't interest in becoming a hero full-time like his parents. Even then, at least Steve was a super human, where as Tony was not. All his genius had was a suit of armor...and even the Ironman armor was not indestructible. Steve constantly worried about his Shellhead and their son.
meeting with Fury at SHIELD, the team had returned home for the evening. In typical Tony fashion, the billionaire had disappeared down to his lab once they got home. He claimed that he had important data to gather up and wouldn't be available for awhile.
"Doesn't mean I want you to leave," Tony sulked while crossing his arms. He knew he looked childish but he couldn't help it. It hated being left alone like this. It was bad enough that Fury refused to give them intel on the mission specs, but he blatantly refused to allow Tony to accompany Steve and Natasha.
sing was because of a moment like this one, he'd walked into the lab one time and caught Tony singing while he worked.
Thor took the offered treat and studied it for a moment, hesitantly tasting it before smiling in delight.
Peter hesitantly reached forward to shake Cap's hand, keeping his grip loose and trying not to seem too starry eyed.
"Feel better?" Bruce asked lightly, smirking as Tony quickly poured himself a gross amount of caffeine.
Literally, they had a kid together. Tony had finalized the adoption for Peter months ago that officially stated Steven Grant Rogers and Anthony Edward Stark were parents.
Me: I don't know, because it's the headquarters for the UN? Plus, our story wouldn't make much progress if Doom went somewhere else...and how many people actually know the other main offices for the United Nations are in Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna and The Hague, anyway?
Steve fought back the blush threatening to rise in his cheeks. He was used to Tony's name-calling, but that was long before he'd come to realize his feelings of desire for the dark haired billionaire. He smiled softly at the genius and walked over to the fridge to grab the ingredients he needed.
"Loki, you must try this sweet food," Thor handed Loki one of the doughnuts covered in bright pink icing and multicolored sprinkles. His brother looked at the strange treat skeptically.
Clint and Tony had always had a strange flirtation-ship thing between them. Tony would blow kisses to Clint and the archer would pretend to grab them out of the air. It was childish, yes, but it was their thing.
"I'm starving," Clint groaned, rubbing his shoulder. "I seriously think you broke something in me, Cap, which is not cool. I need my shoulder. I'm an archer, you know!"
Steve had basically given up working missions for SHIELD because he didn't want to be away from his family for so long. The Avengers would always be a team, even with new blood on the rise, but Captain America was no longer an asset to SHIELD.
"Fury makes us wait forever and a day and can't even be bothered to provide decent coffee. Who the fuck does he think he is?" Tony growled in annoyance, glaring at the Styrofoam cup beside him.
Thor was Asgardian, though he had claimed the Earth to be under his protection. Any human dumb enough to tell the God of thunder what to do would be turned into toast.
"Nat thinks it'll take at least a week, but we're planning for two weeks just in case," Steve explained quietly, trying to smile encouragingly at Tony. "Don't worry, Tones. It'll fly by before you know it."
As Peter and Steve neared the lab doors, they could hear the sound of music coming from inside and a very familiar voice singing aloud. JARVIS opened the doors for them silently, letting them in to see Tony standing at his computer screens working.
No, Tony reserved his sweet kisses for those closest to him, at heart. Of course, it wasn't until the Avengers moved into the tower that this became known.
"To what measure would you define them to be beneath me?" Loki taunted back, always enjoying his verbal quarrels with the Latverian ruler. "I find your logic to be flawed."
"Out of my way, maggots!" Sandman howled, sending a wave of sand out to bowl the police cars out of his path. Police officers dove for cover, covered in sand as they scrambled for safety. Cars went flying in every direction and Tony looked on in alarm, dread filling him as he watched one cruiser fly through the air...straight through the front window of Crispey Creamy...
As the exited the elevator to head up, they were surprised to see a frazzled Tony coming down the hallway towards them with his arms flying every which way, struggling to get his jacket on in a hurry.
"Doom's deployment against the city notwithstanding, can anyone explain how Doom managed to get his hands on this kind of technology?" Fury asked shortly, his annoyance clear. "It's raising too many questions."
"It's nothing, forget I asked anything," Steve started while backing up towards the door, wishing he'd just kept his mouth shut, "Let's go eat, I'll take you to the diner over on 23rd?" Steve went to reach for the door but Tony stopped him.
"It's a-an honor to actually meet you, Sir, I m-mean, Captain--Mr. Rogers America, Sir." He could have kicked himself for stammering so much.
We see some more family fluff and a healthy portion of protective Cap, as well as Thor. I will admit that there is some Fury bashing, not that I am not a fan of the character it just works for this fic. Apologies! And we get our first look into Spiderman!
"I'm sorry, did he just say we're gonna spray this guy with water?" Clint asked over the comms. "How is that gonna stop him?"
"Pop's makin' waffles," Peter said cheekily as he climbed up Tony's back to wrap himself around the genius, smirking at Tony's flailing arms trying to steady them both.
Reigning in the burst of annoyance, and the sudden urge to break the agents face against his shield, Steve took a steadying breath before turning his full attention to the halfwit agent.
By lunch time, Steve was dressed and ready to go. He had the keys to his motorcycle in his pocket, knowing he wouldn't have to talk Tones into riding the bike since his genius loved the motorcycle.
long weeks, Steve and Natasha finally returned to the tower after fulfilling their mission for SHIELD.
They all stopped and a tense silence filled the room before Tony groaned loudly and slapped his forehead.
"Irritating insect!" Doom growled, firing another blast at Spiderman who was attempting to web the villain up.
SHIELD had not only discovered video footage of Hydra's secret experiments, but they also found evidence of an unsolved case.  A case Fury was familiar with, one that he didn't believe was true.
." Tony scowled down at the steaming cup in his hand, pursing his lips in disgust. Who the fuck buys decaf coffee? It's sacrilege to buy anything other than pure 100% caffeinated coffee!
Steve and Clint watched Tony rush into the elevator like the Devil was at his heels. It wasn't uncommon for the billionaire to leave in a rush like that, whether it was for personal reasons or business, they'd simply gotten used to it.
Tony fired up his blasters to take out as many bots as he could from the air. On the ground, Steve to the bots on hand-to-hand, working better in close quarters.
Peter thought in amazement, watching the breath taking God smirk at Doom's anger with thinly veiled contempt.
"Mission report," Fury said simply, grabbing his folder and opening it to show surveillance photos of the teams last battle against Doom. "I want to know what happened last week with Doom, what went wrong, and can someone please explain to me how that maniac managed to vanish into thin air?"
Tony, Bruce and Steve were sitting in the living room after dinner, enjoying the peace and quiet. Tony was mindlessly working on a new upgrade blueprint for his repulsors while Steve worked on one of his crossword puzzles. Bruce was watching a documentary about penguins while munching on a bowl of popcorn, tossing kernels at Tony when the genius wasn't looking.
Steve smiled softly as he leaned against the doorway. It was such a rare occasion to actually hear Tony sing out loud. The genius had kept that secret safe from everyone. He had a beautiful voice, but he wouldn't let anyone hear him.
"Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! You didn't tell me you had robots that make smoothies! JARVIS showed me the fiber laser for the suits and you didn't say you were
Steve rolled his eyes and stood up, already reaching for his wallet. "Do you have enough money for food, son?"
"Like...three or four--" Tony tried counting his fingers, glancing up in confusion. "What day is it?"
"Strawberry is Tony's favorite and you two have had plenty," Nat said firmly, setting the box beside her.
Smiling, he silently prayed for this mission to end as quickly as possible so he could come back home...
Peter collided with the training mat once again, groaning loudly as he rolled to his side, his Aunt Nat smiling above him like a sadistic mama spider!
"Stark...are you telling me you already figured out the device Doom used?" Fury asked darkly, glaring at the smiling genius.
"Our little spiderling is getting better and better every day," Natasha smiled as she helped Peter up off the mat. "We've come a long way this week."
Tony ticked off on his fingers. "Fuels the brain into functioning correctly, 3 heartbeats for the price of 1 and more than 900 mg of caffeine in a 12 hour period gives you the ability to talk to electricity."
Once Steve had Tony safely moved to the jet for medical help, he returned to the battle to confront Doom and possibly rearrange the villains insides after the stunt Doom pulled.
"He's 14, Cap," Tony stated, giving Peter an amused glower. "Now, any clue where the rest of our team is? I want them to meet Peter."
"Thank you, beloved..." Tony mumbled, grabbing his tablet from the table to work while Steve cooked.
Tony jumped and may have shrieked when Peter came up behind him, glaring at Steve who started laughing at him.
Giving one last soft brush of lips against the genius' head, Steve turned and boarded the jet. He tried to breath easy, taking his seat beside Natasha at the front, securing himself in. From the front window he watched Tony move to stand in the doorway of the tower, watching them take off. The dusk of sunrise cast a dim glow over the roof of the tower, a lovely morning had it not been for the unwanted circumstances.
"This whole Spiderman jibber-jabber has me concerned. Why is SHIELD suddenly so interested in him? JARVIS is 98% sure that Spiderman is, in fact, male, by the way," Tony explained quietly, scanning his eyes over the tablet in his hands.
"Gotcha! I'll be down in a minute, JARVIS." Tony closed his laptop down and quickly began to gather up his things.
"I didn't mean anything, Captain," The agent stammered, lowering his eyes abashed. He was clearly uncomfortable with being on Captain America's bad side.
"You'll love these," Thor stated as he picked out another doughnut. "These are called long johns and they have a cream filled center. The top is dark chocolate."
He'd only made it a block before his phone started ringing in his pocket. Pulling it out, he saw that it was a private number calling him. Shrugging, he slid the green bar and answered.
While Steve tried to come up with a plan to defeat Sandman, one that didn't involve lethal force, he failed to notice a certain webbed hero land behind him. A timid tap on the shoulder had Steve turning around swiftly, surprise filling him when he looked down to find the famed Spiderman waving at him.
It was also times like this when Steve felt guilty over his own childhood antics, knowing this was exactly how Buck must have felt watching Steve's skinny, 5 foot nothin' asthmatic ass rush off head first into a fight.
By the time the day had ended and the sun began to set along the horizon, Loki informed his young admirer that he had to go, much to Peter's disappointment. The teen had asked probably one thousand questions to the God, and Loki answered each and every one of them. It was obvious that the trickster enjoyed Peter's company.
Antonia turned around to face her guest, who had scurried to the middle of the room, gaze firmly affixed onto the floor – whether she had taken notice of the bandages discarded on the floor, Antonia did not know, as the girl didn’t make show of suspicion – but the maiden didn’t appear to be any calmer in the privacy of Antonia’s chambers, instead shaking even more so than she had before.
Steve himself found his own heart growing fonder and fonder of Tony, as he had taken to calling him, the two of them becoming closer with each passing day. They were often seen together around the castle, whether sparring, walking through the gardens, or discussing battle plans and poetry books alike, one always by the other’s side. Word spread through the land of the king and his knight, brought together by destiny, two souls fated to connect.
“I see no reason for a private audience, Lady Deborah. The only people present in this room are you, myself, my guards, and my trusted advisor,” he pointed out, sharing a worried glance with Sam, his Chief General. “I have nothing to hide from them.”
“A king is often busy, my lady, and can rarely find the time for personal pleasures,” he replied, begrudgingly giving her a fake smile.
Antonia stripped down to her undergarments and began to work on removing the bandages which were compressing her chest: they were the worst part of her disguise, far more painful – after a day of wearing them – than any other injury she usually sustained in sparring, but they were also necessary to hide her true identity, especially when she was not wearing her armor.
The child, to whom was given the name Antonia, grew day by day more lovely: her beauty was beyond compare, her character bright and colorful, and her mind sharper than any other in the land.
“Now, young lady, hurry back to the servant’s quarters, and do not vex your mind with worries: this… incident shall remain between us, understood?”
Tony was a busy man, and between being a superhero, leading a multi-billion company and designing new gear for his teammates it wasn’t unusual for him to overwork himself until his body couldn’t keep up and he fell asleep on the spot.
Her weapons and armor were of much higher quality than those forged by any other hand in Steve’s kingdom, an advantage which, coupled with her fine abilities, made her a dangerous foe for any opponent and allowed her to partake in many adventures to quench her thirst for knowledge and honor.
By endeavoring to send Antonio on an errand of this sort, the cunning Lady Deborah had hoped to be the cause of Antonio's demise.
“Ah,” said the satyr, a grin twisting his face, “I fear that I am too tired to answer any more of your questions now, but come back tomorrow, and then I will answer you and tell you what you so wish to know.”
Steve only had eyes for Tony, and Tony for him. Without a word, Steve took him by the arm and led him to his chambers.
Once again, Antonio went on. “And finally, I ask you this: I beg you to tell me why it was that, when we reached the palace, you laughed longer and louder than ever?'
From then on, the good king, with his beloved wife Maria, lived righteously in peace and comfort. But after a few years had passed, the queen, of whom the king expected no further offspring, became pregnant for a fourth time.
“In that case, my lord, I have come to you concerning a matter of honor. My trusted maiden,” she said, gesturing at the girl behind her, “has been… violated, inside this very castle, last night.”
Poor Steve had looked absolutely devastated at the prospect of losing his Tony. The thought made something warm settle inside of Antonia’s chest, as though the proof of her king’s devotion were a physical force behind her breastbone, but the sentiment was soured by the unfortunate situation that had warranted it.
“Never with anyone. I have never… I’ve never had the chance of knowing such pleasures in my youth, and afterwards-”
But when Antonia came to a marriageable age, her father, finding that he had now neither the land nor the gold required to secure a marriage with someone equal to her status, despaired that his daughter would not be able to marry.
to break word with Lady Deborah. Many interesting things have transpired from the satyr’s mouth, and I would give my entire kingdom for the pleasure of seeing her face once we recount the creature’s word.”
Ever since he'd left the tower, Steve had been a bit edgy. He wasn't used to being alone anymore. His morning should start with a quick work out run, making coffee for his grumpy genius and making breakfast for his kid before school. Waking up on the uncomfortable bunk in the jet was
Things finally come to a head one day in the lab, and looking back Steve knows it was stupid, but it had only been a matter of time before he snapped...
"Tones, you know they can't touch him." Steve tried to be reassuring, he knew that the genius was close to having a panic attack.
Tony, predictably, doesn’t hear him. Instead he crawls up the bed, curling into a ball in the middle, crying like a child. It’s maybe the worst thing Steve’s seen, and Steve has seen a lot of horrible things in his day. Tony’s shaking, sobbing body paints a shattering picture of abject misery, and Steve is sick and tired of being helpless.
Steve is surprised to hear this question from Peter. From some of the newer, less familiar heroes, sure. But Peter knows it’s not like that-
There’s a letter sitting on top of the freshly painted metal, “Cap” printed on the front in Tony’s blocky engineering print, neat and square and perfect. He picks it up between hesitant fingers like it’s fragile, holding it for a moment before sliding his finger beneath the flap. It pulls away clean with the slightest cracking noise, and the paper inside is fine, heavy, cotton based. There’s a sticky note attached to the front of it.
“One for the road,” he said, leaning down, and Steve gave him a searing kiss, fingers reaching up to press over Tony’s bondmark.
to fight fascism, and you saw how he responded to the last government threat to American freedom. Don’t make me say it.”
Tony Stark doesn’t know why Steve Rogers loves him. All he knows is what he has: a broken heart patched up with bomb scraps and a crystal pane of glass; a team who calls them mom and dad, who thinks he’s clever and kind and worthwhile; and a man, chopped up and jumbled into a mess of memory and action, something torn out of him and dropped back in the wrong place. He has Steve, fuckall he’s supposed to do with that. Maybe the infatuation was Amora, too.
“All these years, all I’ve ever wanted to do is take care of you,” Steve had admitted, a beatific smile on his face. “And now I can just…do exactly what I like, and you seem to have a good time, every time.”
“Huh, yep, there’s Senator Gillibrand with Godwin’s Law. Although not unwarranted. Fuck.” He swallows another spoonful of yoghurt. “Okay. Coulson can’t be on board with this shit. Buuut, he’s lost all jurisdiction. Fuckin’ Cap, this is all his fault. Being morally righteous is awesome when you don’t have to think about the consequences, huh?”
Tony raised his eyebrows. “Really?” he asked. Steve swallowed, so embarrassed he felt a little lightheaded with it. “I…didn’t expect that from you.”
“So, Pepper knows what he said,” Bruce says, and Tony pauses, gesturing at him with what’s left of his slice.
“Then build one,” Tony says, not looking away from Coulson. “I’ll even help with designs. For my usual fee, of course.”
“What are you doing?” he asks himself, staring at his phone where, yup, he’s just sent Steve a text asking him to choose between pizza and Sichuan. “Why the hell did I do that?”
Bruce tuts at him. He works his way up Tony’s spine, slowly, digging his big, calloused hands into Tony’s latissimus dorsi like a pro.
Steve was the urban dictionary definition of a service top. All he wanted was to give Tony exactly what would make him come apart, mindless with pleasure. So Tony had learned, with the delight of unwrapping a brand new toy, that on the days when Tony was feeling more aggressive Steve was more than happy to roll over and take it.
“Talk,” Tony says, sipping his drink once more. Loki pouts up at him, and Tony smirks and bends down for another lazy kiss, Loki’s tongue sliding against his to taste the remnants of alcohol redolent in his mouth. Loki tastes of sweet, cool water, the usual bitter pine. Today he feels particularly sharp, and Tony shifts his hips a little without intent, simply enjoying having a beautiful body spread out under him, his to indulge in as he pleases. When Tony pulls away, he’s more breathless than he’d expected to be. Loki’s eyes are half-lidded, smug and happy in an uncomplicated way that leaves Tony feeling off-kilter. His pulse thunders through his chest.
Y O U I N V I T E D M E, Steve protests, and his whole face feels hot. He feels like he’s going to float away. For weeks Tony refused to talk about it, and this is not at all how he’d imagined this conversation going. He wishes he had a better way to communicate, but there’s no way they can get Franklin to be their intermediary for this one.
Steve stiffened, saved by the arrival of the elevator. He stepped inside, resigned to his fate when Tony slid in next to him. He looked down at his sock-clad feet while Tony pressed the button for the penthouse.
“Don’t pull a Houdini on me,” Tony bids quietly. “I know you want to, this is embarrassing, you want to be alone with your- uh, whatever that was, but turnabout is fair play, right? My turn to make you breathe slow and hug you until you feel like your skin is on right again. So come on.” He takes one of Loki’s hands, braces it over his heart. “That’s it.”
Tony nods. Swallows. “Okay. Well, I don’t know where this is going, but if you’re trying to endear yourself to me-”
Reed reaches out, one large hand closing over Tony’s forearm. He pulls him around to face him, his eyes darting over Tony’s face. Steve knows what he sees there: the gauntness of him, the way the skin under his eyes looks permanently bruised.
“You’re still here,” Ms. Bliss says from the doorway, pointed, and Steve shakes himself and stands. He glances over at Ms. Bliss’s pinched expression, one of her hands fussing with the pin holding back her sweep of steel-grey curls. “It’s almost my lunch break. If you don’t mind?”
?” Loki skirls, and then Thor slips neatly between them, executing a complicated move that gathers both of Loki’s wrists in one hand with a single, fluid motion. His free hand flies towards Loki’s face to forestall whatever curse might fly forth next, his first two fingers curling right into Loki’s mouth and hooking into the tender skin at the back of his palate. Loki makes a violent, furious sound, but in the end only thrashes about like a hooked fish. Steve finds himself able to move again, and he stumbles forward, an embarrassing half-gasp tumbling out of his mouth.
“I know the rest of the tower is safe,” Steve said, face smashed against Tony’s stomach as they lay on the couch. “I know that. I know.”
Steve doesn’t know how long he stares at his computer screen without looking at it, but whatever the answer is, it’s too long.
Tony sighs. He kicks off from the pavement and rises into the sky, higher, higher. He looks down at Manhattan below him and tries not to remember the glow of the portal, the endless gleaming dark of space.
He pulls on a pair of cotton sleep pants and an old Judas Priest shirt, then goes to the bathroom and checks to see the damage. Almost all of the marks Loki left can be covered with a collared shirt, and they’d washed up after the messier bits. He tries to fix his hair back with a wet comb and mostly fails.
Tony manages to get back to his room, shower again, and change in time for lunch. He looks at himself in the mirror—sagging skin below his eyes, crow’s feet, laugh lines—and wonders what the fuck about him is supposed to be compatible with the peak of human perfection.
“Steve wasn’t particularly interested in honours. His conviction—that he was right, damn it, no matter whether he was giving me hell over which show to put on the television or about the intricacies of government policy—did not come from arrogance. Although it wasn’t always easy for me to remember that when we were arguing.” The audience titters, and Tony quirks a small, sad smile. His hand comes up to grip the podium, white-knuckled.
We're almost done here, but the final chapter is...really long, tbh. Debating if I should split it into two? Let me know your thoughts on that. >___>''
“Sounds like you’d best get, then,” Miss Jones said, offering Tony a shrewd eye, and Tony bit back a sigh. He supposed Miss Jones had considered the same things he had and come up with an answer she didn’t particularly like. Cage had always been the soft-hearted of the two of them.
“So you came upstairs, where the good cheese is,” Tony observed, grinning, and Steve flushed at the accusation.
“You make the same damned stew every time, Sheriff,” Tony said gruffly, turning to hang his apron on the hook by the forge.
Steve waves a hand in the air, brushing off JARVIS’ unspoken apology for deactivating his alarms. The motion aches a little, and he rotates his neck in place a few times, then the rest of his body, testing his aches and pains.
“Listen to you,” Tony says, and he can’t stop himself now. He’s drunk on power, and his orgasm is so far off—a freight train still climbing a mountain in the distance. For once, he’s the one who could go all day. “Begging so loud and shameless. Can you hear yourself?”
The thing the beta majority and the alpha assholes in power didn’t want to acknowledge about omegas was that in many ways, they were far stronger than their alpha counterparts. Steve knew intimately what the propaganda said. It was the reason he’d been branded as an alpha, taken the heavy-duty suppressants calibrated for someone of his size and metabolism by Stark and Erskine before his death, applied two drops of synthetic pheromones to his scent glands every morning after washing up like clockwork. Omegas had been banned from the military, because omegas were weak and meant for childbirth. They were hyperfertile, with an 89% rate of conception after a heat with an alpha, compared to the 38% rate that betas had even when tracking and having sex during a beta female’s oestrus. What else could they be good for?
To his credit, it’s a little funny. Tony’s mouth quirks up, and for a moment, Strange’s face softens. Despite what Tony likes to say about how much he hates magic, they’re friends, almost. Steve thinks they must be, anyhow. There is an unusual kind of respect that they hold for each other as experts in their respective fields. Strange was a talented enough doctor, back before he became Sorcerer Supreme. He’s smart, in the way that Tony likes the people he surrounds himself with to be. In some ways, Steve had always been the one exception to that rule. Rhodes, Reed, the Hanks—most everyone Tony loved was brilliant in some way or another. Steve’s a skilled tactician, but he’s no genius.
know you. I know who you are, and I could be good for you. I could be so good for you if you let me. I know I could. Just let me try again-”
Finally, a shameless plug: if you are interested in angsty slow-burn Stony (with some bonus FrostIron),
Tony shifted, his body straightening up to rock his hips more forcefully, grinding his knot in as deep as he could get it as Steve tensed, blind and gasping, his senses narrowed down to Tony inside him, his thumb slick over Steve’s slit, back and forth, a maddening swipe that made Steve whimper and squirm with oversensitivity, thighs tensing and releasing against Tony’s hips as aftershocks skittered through him. He could feel Tony coming, could feel his knot pulsing inside him, and when he finally had the strength to open his eyes Tony was staring down at him with rapacious intensity, his hips still moving. His brow was slick with sweat, moisture leaving glistening trails down the tendons of his throat, his chest. His mouth was red and used, and Steve loved him so much it ached.
“Fuck,” Tony snarls, throwing his phone across the bed so that it bounces, landing face up on the other side. He scrubs his hands over his face. “No word from Strange yet?”
Tony’s chest tightens a little as he stares at her. Natasha’s expression is a flat mirror, something he knows from experience is her way of being honest. Any emotions that might betray her are reduced to micro-expressions, but they’re still there. It’s different from the emotionless mask The Black Widow wears, more open in its emptiness. For what feels like the hundredth time in these past colourful and maddening years, Tony wishes he could have fallen in love with her instead. In some universe, he thinks, they would fit beautifully; two liars, drinking to drown their consciences, playing at ruthlessness because it was what they were trained to be.
He’d ducked out with an apology and waited in the bedroom, and when Tony came out everything was fine between them. Tony seemed to feel that Steve had chosen to respect his body and his wishes, and damn if that didn’t make Steve feel like the lowest piece of shit when he thought about it now. Tony always thought he was so much better than he was. He had no idea how no one had seen what a conniving, sarcastic, shithead he could be. Bucky had known, and that’s what Steve missed more than anything, he thought now. He missed that feeling of someone knowing exactly what he was, down to his bones, and loving everything: the grit, and the shit, and the nasty bits. Tony loved him for what he could be, for the best parts of him, for how they fit together to make a better whole. Bucky had loved the vindictive, violent bits of him just as much as his kindness. Tony made him a better man. Steve knew that, believed that as much as any religious edict he’d ever learned. But sometimes, Steve wished he could have both.
Steve frowns. “That’s it?” he asks, because that seems awfully easy, but the priest just goes on talking.
“A second, if you don’t mind,” he says as the window rolls up. He keeps his eyes fixed on the black wall between them and the front of the car, then taps his hand on the door armrest once, twice. “Is there something you wanna tell me?”
“You probably knew he and Sharon set up their little Halfway House for Second Chances, but I guess you didn’t know I got called in somewhat regularly to help Bucky out with his arm.” Tony sobers, reaching out blind until he catches a hand on Steve’s thigh. He rests it there, swiping his thumb back and forth. “I used to joke he’d get banged up just so I’d come out and see to it. But now, looking back, maybe there was a little truth in that. They were so isolated. And we all loved you, in our own ways.”
"Ah." Tony stands, then gestures for her to leave first. "He's fine for me to have sex with but not for you to sleep in the same building as, huh?"
“Good morning, Bruce,” Steve tries, valiantly unflinching in the face of Bruce’s emanating disapproval. He looks pointedly at Tony’s face, then back at Steve.
If he thinks about it, now, that whole period of his life feels strangely illuminated. He’d given Pepper his company, and Rhodey a suit. He’d written out his will. Most of his personal assets were going to charity; scholarships for gifted students, outreach programs for young poc scientists, initiatives for women in STEM. He’d always been hurt, remembering the words Fury had read to him, but he also always knew that it was a crock of shit. For a while, he’d thought that Natasha had misjudged him. He’d intentionally inflated his own persona in those days, in the hopes that it would hurt everyone less when he’d died. Of course, he knew from experience that hating someone for their own assholery didn’t necessarily make their death easier. Still, he never thought it was particularly fair to judge him too harshly for his actions then. What was it that JARVIS had said? He’d performed admirably under duress?
“After your rest, you might go into Sir’s workshop and take the blanket from the couch there. It should smell heavily of him. And then, if you went to see him, you’d have a strong scent to ground you. It might help the bond-sickness. Miss Potts has already ensured that the Tank was outfitted with some of your clothes.”
“I was angry because the words were forced,” he says, turning so he can speak low and rumbling against the hinge of Steve’s jaw, “and I wanted to gift my submission to you freely.”
Seeing Tony had helped, some, but his whole body still ached. It felt like what he remembered the flu had been like, pain seeping into every crevice of his body, tainting his every movement. He wanted Tony to have him, yes, but mostly he wanted to touch him. He wanted him in his hands, not for sex, but for the sheer desperation of holding him in his arms and feeling him close. Safe.
"Which means you're here for me," Tony says, taking a sip himself. Loki's green eyes are bright with enjoyment. "Widow was out because of Clint, and the Hulk scares you shitless. Captain America isn't a grey area kind of guy, and none of us would trust Thor’s judgement. That leaves me. And you like me. Why?"
There’s an awkward silence as the priest waits for Steve to confess his sins, but Steve doesn’t really know where to begin. He opens his mouth, but he can’t stop thinking of Tony falling from the portal, dead weight. He doesn’t know how to say
“I have suspicions,” Natasha allowed, and Tony sighed, draining the rest of his coffee. Steve reached over the island and took hold of it, fingers brushing reassuringly against the back of Tony’s hand before he turned to refill the cup. “Steve and I have arguably been made intersex. Bruce is a beta who shares a body with the personification of alpha rage. There’s no space on this team for us to judge you for doing something to your body that you wanted. Especially if it makes you happy.” She smiled, kind and calm in the face of Tony’s visible agitation. “Your happiness is ours, alpha. That’s what it means, to be pack.”
“Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker,” Bruce says, sparing Loki a glance. “Remember when Loki reappeared, he blew through a Hydra compound in Sokovia? We couldn’t figure out why. This is the guy who was running it.”
Steve can understand that quite well. He can imagine it easily, three of his favourite people holed up in a safehouse somewhere, chatting over beer and greasy takeout while Tony works on Bucky’s arm. The thought warms him, and he reaches out and squeezes Tony’s arm. He leans down, precarious, and presses his face to Tony’s temple. He smudges a kiss against his handsome cheek.
Pepper shakes her head. “Look, the fact of the matter is your position is incredibly tenuous right now, Tony. The media – for the most part – likes you. The president likes you. General opinion polls are good. But what if the situation had been worse in Lagos? The international community is where you’re weakest right now. There hasn’t been war on American soil in a long time; it’s easy for the American public to forgive us for our past. But you can be sure other countries remember the Stark legacy better.”
“Got too exciting for Bruce, huh?” Steve asked, already knowing the answer. Bruce was a sore loser, and Mario Kart was a bit too high-energy for his tastes.
“Widow, be advised we have unknown enhanced in the field, I repeat, unknown enhanced. Shots fired. Iron Man’s suit has already sustained damage from a single shot, requesting backup. Do you copy?”
DUM-E whirred gently at him, and Steve smiled and patted the bot’s strut again. Then he made his way towards the elevator, and pressed the button for the Tank.
“We figured, what with Doctor Strange trailing our float,” Joyce deadpans, and Tony flashes a grin at her.
“I didn’t ask you to do that,” Tony says. He sounds…not good. Steve shuffles a little closer. “And I know this wasn’t your idea, Goldilocks, so don’t even try covering for him.”
Tony claps his hands together. “Great. Now we’re gonna run some tests. Steve, come stand here.” He taps his foot on a marker on the workshop floor, then holds out a hand.
"Bruce found me a therapist here, Dr. Ingram. I like her. She doesn't let me get away with anything." He tilts his head, eyes gleaming. "Did you find someone, like you said? If not, Bruce has a recommendation for a doctor in LA, a friend of his. He does talk therapy and can also prescribe medication. You should call him."
Clint had raised his eyebrows at him, then grinned a little bashfully, flicking a green marshmallow hat to bounce between Tony’s eyes. Steve didn’t understand why all of Clint’s cereal tasted like dessert, but Tony had picked the little marshmallow up off the table and eaten it, and that had been the end of that.
Now, obviously not all trans folks are traumatised, and plenty of them have very happy transition stories. However, that’s not true of all people. I know plenty of queer people who feel that their gender/sexual identity is tied to, say, assault or CSA. Now, if you asked me outright, of course it doesn’t matter if, for example, a woman is a lesbian because she’s a survivor and she’s terrified of men. We should respect her identity regardless. It’s harder, however, when you’re looking at it from the inside, and these are the questions that Tony is grappling with here. It took me a while to decide that it was okay if I felt certain ways about my sexuality and my body because of trauma, and a lot of guidance from older queers. Community is everything, yo.
“If you look like shite up here, you’ve gotta look sharp elsewhere. Sharks in the water, you know how the game runs.” His expression sours, some remembered battle taking hold of him. Steve watches him shake it off with guilt burrowing pain into his gut. “Beth, babe, you here somewhere?”
Tony blinks. “What?” And then, “oh, no. No, no, no. You want me to be your field commander? Are you crazy? Are you sure Xavier cleared you? Documentation or it didn’t happen- J, check my email, tell me-”
Steve draws back, then tosses the bloody hand towel into the sink to deal with later. It’s unusually thoughtless of him. Leaving blood untreated on the fine white cloth may stain, which is the kind of thing Tony wouldn’t think twice about but would typically bother Steve immensely. But instead he gathers Tony up again and presses his face into side of his neck, breathing in great, slow breaths that seem to suck everything from Tony and leave him winded.
“I can tell him that Doctor Banner would like him to bring his bow and the arrows he used in the Lagos battle to his lab for testing.”
There is a Rembrandt in the foyer. Looking at it, he knows immediately that Pepper put it there, that neither of the Stark men had really had an eye for classical paintings. He wonders what will become of all this after Tony… well, after Tony. And then he curses himself, for even daring to think such a thing.
“It counts,” Steve said firmly, and the last of the tension fled Tony’s body. Steve petted his chest gently, smoothing his fingers over Tony’s scars. “I don’t have to marry with you to stay with you. Or bond. I want you to know. I’ll stay no matter what.”
Steve moaned again, the only answer he could provide as Tony held his mouth open like this. He was fucking slowly in and out with his fingers now, saliva pooling under Steve’s tongue and dripping over his chin, his jaw. Then Tony pressed his cock to Steve’s lips, his fingers still inside, and Steve let out a soft cry at the thought of it.
Loki looks tired, which Tony didn’t expect. He quirks one side of his mouth at Tony in greeting. Steve staggers to the side, clearly nauseated, and Tony steps out of the armour and puts a hand on his shoulder, feeling useless as he watches Steve struggle against the urge, pressing a fist against his mouth. The armour takes off under JARVIS’ care, heading for the machining level for repairs.
Turning to Tony, Steve wrapped his arms around him in a tight hug, trying to ignore the ache in his chest when Tony quietly sniffed.
Steve felt both relieved and a little hurt by Tony's lack of faith in him. It wasn't unfounded, but Steve had thought they were making great strides in knowing things like this about each other. He was not homophobic by any means. He would often get into fights with those who were when he was younger, defending both men and women who couldn't stand up for themselves.
Steve nodded. He swallowed. He turned to face Natasha and Clint. Then he picked up his shield, and jogged into the woods.
“Shuri?” Tony prompts, and Bruce grins down at him. It’s the first smile he’s seen since he woke up in this strange new world.
Steve nods. He loosens his grip slightly, but the wild expression that overtakes Tony’s face draws him back in. He takes another unsteady breath. “Okay. So…”
“They find him,” Bruce said, shrugging. He flipped back to the paper trail he was following. “They find us, really. The broken ones, the weird ones, the ones that get left behind, or beaten up, or bullied. They see themselves in Tony. Sometimes me, but mostly Tony.” Bruce laughed, a self-deprecating kind of thing, but there was fondness there, too. “He’s…human, in a way the rest of us aren’t. He’s fucked up in public since he was a kid. They’ve seen him awkward, and pissed, and throwing up in strangers’ bushes. Kids get him, in a way they don’t get a flawlessly gorgeous Russian super-spy, or a nerd who turns into a 1400lb green monster. Tony’s real.”
They sit in silence for a long time. Before them, the sun inches over the horizon, creeping slowly. From up here, there are no buildings tall enough to block it quite yet. It’s too early in the day. Instead, Tony hums a few bars, swinging his legs in the air. He watches Steve finish his drawing: Tony, mouth bruised, eyes glittering with an expression that Tony can’t quite read, himself. Fear, maybe, or fury.
Steve wails. There isn’t a better word for it. His jaw slackens, slumped entirely into Tony’s arms, and now Tony’s getting ideas. This is his deepest, darkest fantasy: Steve, drunk on pleasure and at his mercy, too tired to do anything but take it. This is how he loves it, giving and receiving. This is the most precious gift he could have ever gotten.
He thinks of Tony loving him while Steve tossed him aside, put his fist through the wall of a dingy motel in his anger, left him there alone and shaking. He thinks of Tony nearly freezing to death from cold, and remembering the angry words that passed between them. The thought of it makes his non-existent stomach roil with guilty nausea.
“I love you,” he said, and Tony blinked at him. “And there isn’t an alpha in the world who could love me half as well as you do.”
“Sir, yessir,” Tony says easily, saluting the air. Clint tosses a pinch of flour at him, and Tony ducks. “Hey!”
Steve to be good. He wants Howard to have been wrong about Steve, because (falsely) deep down he thinks that if Howard was right about Steve being great, then Howard must have been right about him being a disappointment. Tony has an epiphany, in this fic, that Steve is desperately trying to make their relationship work in an almost monomaniac way, and that that dynamic isn’t healthy for him. So I actually think they had a breakthrough here, even if it ended in tears. You will see some of the results of them actually talking TO each other instead of AT each other in the next instalment. But I hope that some of that growth I was trying to portray came across in this fic. Would love to hear thoughts!!! As always, I love discussing this stuff with you all. <3
The man shoots Tony between the eyes. Blood splatters all up and down Steve’s neck and shoulder, blood and tissue speckled across his skin. He’s screaming Tony’s name, but he can’t move. He can’t feel anything.
Tony turns around, the coffee maker rumbling pleasantly. Then he leans over the counter and pokes Loki in the nose, his hand passing right through him. "Huh." Definitely not awake enough.
“I was about to go in!” he yelled back, trying to be heard over the howl of the wind. “Kinda cold for me!”
“I’ll hold you to that,” Rogers said, and it sounded like maybe he meant something else. Tony didn’t have the wherewithal to think about what that might be. Instead, he focussed on the feeling of Rogers under his hands, the sounds he made when Tony pressed open-mouthed kisses to his neck, the look of him in the fading autumn light. This time, Tony had oil, and they were able to go much slower. He took his time, feeling Rogers flex under his hands, watching his chest rise and fall with each gasping breath. He waited until the sheriff had his pleasure before he took his own, sweet, sleepy kisses pressed to his mouth as Rogers came down from his own climax and Tony found his own.
Steve opens his mouth, then closes it again. There are so many things he wants to say, most of them angry, but he also knows that none of them are fair. He’s trying to be more careful of the things he says, after seeing what his one thoughtless comment had done to Tony. Sure, he could tell Xavier about all the horrible things he saw, but he’s right; that’s not in conflict with his point at all.
,” Steve tells him. His hand hovers over Tony’s shoulder, desperate and ineffectual. “I’m here, Tony. I’m right here.”
“You’re the alpha leader of a company that’s been the foremost defence contractor in the world for decades,” she continued, and Stark frowned.
“Tell me,” Tony says. He slides his free hand over Steve’s flank and around, drags his short nails up over his abs. The sound Steve makes is delicious.
“You know,” Bruce said, hesitant now, and Steve turned back to look at him. “We gave over about forty Hydra agents to SHIELD.”
“I lived through the AIDS crisis,” Tony says bluntly. “The stakes were higher even just a few years ago. Steve likes women well enough. He wanted a family. It’s easier, for some men, to pretend like that’s all there is. Especially when you’re a public figure.”
Steve can’t bring himself to say anything in return. This whole thing feels very surreal, and the idea of touching Tony’s skin when he’s this keyed up seems…dangerous. It seems like a bad, completely inadvisable idea.
“He never said what he wanted. I mean, he said he wanted to negotiate the terms of his surrender, but I was the one who suggested he wanted information exchange and his help in exchange for freedom. He never asked for anything, or said what he wanted, or why he wanted it.” Tony raises his eyebrows and closes his eyes, rubbing absently at his brow. “He swore he did not intend to cause harm, and wasn’t plotting our demise. It wasn’t much, but it was all I could drag out of him.”
A cookie for anyone who noticed the chapter naming rules before this one, which I think is really obvious and sort of ruins the game. Did anyone notice it? I don’t think anyone’s noticed it yet. Thank you so much to everyone who has bookmarked or commented or kudos-ed this story! I really do love feedback, which is why I reply to all the comments I get. Fic is kind of a sandbox for me to train my writing muscles and also work out Big Questions I have about canon all at once, so it’s really delightful when other people vibe with what’s going on in my head. I like to hear what people think about what I’m trying to do with the characters and the world, so please continue to share your thoughts with me. I appreciate it.
“And yet, your opinions often tend to be those of your party, don’t they, Senator?” Hill replies evenly. Durbin glances across the table at Cochran, then back at Hill.
“You know me, baby, I can make anything work,” Tony says. He considers how long the retrofit will take, then shrugs; probably under an hour. He pushes off the workbench again, spinning around to survey the workshop. “Hold down the fort, boys. I’m gonna shower. Have the helmet ready for retrofit when I get back.” He glances down at himself, then scratches the back of his neck. His fingers come away flaked with dried blood, as expected. “Loki may have healed me, but he didn’t clean off the side effects.”
“He says to tell you he’s fine, but-” There was a crackle of static, then silence, and Steve sighed and ran a hand over his face. The speakers flared to life, whined loud enough that Steve clapped a hand over his ear, then settled again. “Are you sure you guys are adults? Jeez. He’s definitely got some busted up ribs. I think the rest is superficial, but I don’t know. He won’t tell me.”
“Are you saying she bewitched Steve with her tits?” Clint snickers, stepping out of the elevator. “Also, since when is Loki protecting Tony’s shiny metal ass?”
“Stark,” Rogers slurred, leaning back into Tony’s chest. Tony let out a huffing breath, allowing himself to press his nose to Rogers’ cold temple. The man didn’t even have a damn coat on.
“Being intimate with you could never be a punishment,” Steve tells him seriously, and Tony grins at him.
Tony hadn’t really imagined Loki wanting any kind of permanence, in the beginning. He was just a tool. They were using each other. Now, he thinks about the way Loki had arched under him, trusting, the way he’d called him
. He never fucking listens. “Actually, I…Fury and Romanov have been bugging me about taking more missions with the STRIKE team while Barton is on leave.”
“Ouch,” Steve says, good-natured about it. A wry smile breaks over his face. “But I’m clear, right?”
“Being a poor, disabled, Irish Catholic in the early 1900’s shaped your political beliefs and moral principles,” Tony says. “Just like becoming able-bodied after the serum did. Waking up in the future and suddenly finding yourself the epitome of ‘privilege’ by every measure—white, ostensibly straight, tall, blonde haired, blue eyed, financially stable, educated, well-connected, Christian, alpha—in the future is affecting you now. Everyone’s affected by their identity. What does being an alpha mean to you?”
Loki disappears, and Tony blinks at the dark living room beyond the kitchen island before shaking his head a little. "Right." He fills his coffee mug and sticks the apple in his mouth, then heads down to the workshop in the dark.
“Tell him it’s his fault for stripping naked in Cambridge in the middle of winter and letting Hydra cart him away like a mail-order bride,” Steve huffed.
Tony swallows. Steve’s eyes are so, so bright when he cries. The rims of his eyelids are puffy and pink, astonishing on his classically handsome face. He’s unbelievably beautiful, but he was never Tony’s. Not really.
“Noted,” JARVIS says, amused, and Tony sticks his tongue out at the nearest security camera. “Your feedback is noted, Sir.”
“Why not?” Natasha pouts. “You’ve put me in jail, and we can’t even gossip? Cruel and unusual, Stark.”
He breathes out, carefully, and goes back to his crossword, but the letters blur on the page in front of him. His hands are shaking, he realises, and he closes his eyes and takes a slow breath, counting to ten.
“Steve?” there’s the tell-tale pad of footsteps across the mats, then the transition of Tony’s feet stepping onto the rubber floors. Tony’s head appears around the open doorway to the gym. “What are you doing?”
Tony was in the common room, exactly where JARVIS had said he’d be. Steve could hear him as soon as he stepped out of the elevator, a long stream of profanities overlaid with Clint’s, and Thor’s usual tirade of insults that none of the Avengers knew how to parse. They were shouting over each other, yelling invectives back and forth, and Steve walked out and folded his arms over his chest to find the three of them and Natasha playing Mario Kart. Tony was in the lead, but only by a hair.
Steve nodded, letting the water run over his face. This was exactly the kind of thing Tony had been worried about, when Steve had first brought up the idea of bonding. Being bonded meant that your individual well-being was inextricably tied to someone else. Being separated from Tony this week had left him off-kilter, his hormones unsteady. He knew after all this Tony would blame himself, but he’d been right that morning; Steve could have gone down to the workshop and pestered him more if he’d really needed it. The truth was, he’d gotten lazy. They hadn’t had a mission in two weeks, and Steve had been concentrating on his own things this week. He’d even taken the bike down to spend a day with Sam, finally getting to see that exhibit at the Smithsonian on “Gods and Heroes” by a Salish artist that he’d been trying to get to for a month. While Tony had gone on an engineering binge, pumping out a prototype for near-silent chopper blades for the army and trying to finish a new suit build, Steve had been catching up on his own stuff. Sure, he’d missed Tony, but it was rare for them to get downtime like this. He’d been enjoying it while it lasted.
Tony swipes over to video. He presses record, then pulls out entirely and films Steve’s desperately winking hole. He wriggles his tentacle for effect, then rests the very tip at Steve’s entrance.
Tony has been fiddling with a vast array of sensors for the past few days, trying to find what it is that’s projecting Steve into Tony’s brain.
He can taste, for a moment, how badly he will want to kiss him under those bright blooms, the scent of spring and the happiness bubbling up under his chest. It’s the wrong time, he knows, so soon after his misstep in the elevator. They’re unsteady.
,” Natasha coos, “you two look cozy.” She resettles again in her chair, sliding her legs off the table and leaning forward. Her eyes are bright and mirthful in her face, her shoulders relaxed. She looks like Natasha, and Tony can feel himself reacting positively regardless of what logic tells him he ought to do. He knows this woman. He loves her, even. “Did you fuck him?”
“Oh, yeah, that’ll go over well with Silicon Valley. Do you really want to force a tech exodus and lose even more billions of dollars to Japan and China? I know you’re scared; it’s a big, brand new world, full of aliens and gods and enhanced humans. I’ve been living in it. But think big picture, boys. Not myself, or Romanov, or Barton, or Rhodes are enhanced. Hell, based on DNA at birth, neither is Captain America, or Doctor Banner, and Thor isn’t even from Earth so registration is a moot point there. If you wanna put restrictions on the Avengers, then let’s talk sanctions. But there’s no way you’re coming down on millions of enhanced Americans.”
“Next time,” Tony says, shakily. He’s tempted. He’s definitely, 100% tempted. “Not right now. Please.”
Cool fear trickles over him, a roaring building in his ears as he listens to Stephen’s words, echoing over and over again. He wonders if the thundering he hears is the flap of the moth’s wings, or perhaps his own heart trying to beat itself out of his chest.
She does not say if that’s what she’s done, but then again, Tony wasn’t expecting her to. Natasha would never claim innocence. She wouldn’t believe it’s something that could apply to someone like her. Instead, she looks him over, her green eyes assessing, and Tony obligingly retracts the faceplate. She glances over his face, then his chest, eyes lingering on the reactor. Her shoulders slump, ever so slightly.
Steve rumbles: a low, contented animal sound. He presses his nose more firmly into Tony’s hair, breathes again. The feel of it sends prickles migrating down Tony’s spine in shivering waves.
Pls leave a comment if you enjoyed! I don’t write just straight filth v often (I think this is my second ever PWP type fic, although I didn’t tag it as such because it’s a little too plotty for that) so lmk what you thought. I really like the idea of continuing this series, so if that interests y'all maybe instead of me just pulling prompts off the kinkmeme and continuing in this vein, people can also comment w/ things they’d like to see Steve/Tony subjected to? This is a v fun stress reliever.
“Green,” Steve says, immediately. “Neon, flashing green. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, Tony, can’t you tell-
Steve loosed a skirling whine, hips rocking forward without his consent, and Tony growled straight into his mouth.
And now Tony’s remembering Loki, lithe and pale and beautiful beneath him. He remembers how he’d looked spread out and trussed up. Steve’s muscled Adonis physique is so different, but the image of them both in his mind is enough to make him bite his lip. He may whimper. Maybe. No one could prove it.
alphas who can’t control themselves more than anything else. He’d made that abundantly clear. And Steve had just…made a complete and total fool of himself in front of Tony. God, he’s always been
Steve startles, stumbling back a little. His face is poleaxed and defensive in equal measure, and Tony crowds him back towards the doorway, abusing the height advantage of the armour with extreme prejudice. Natasha slips inside without prompting, and Tony does a brief camera check to confirm Clint scrambling down from the top of the tower, where he must have been watching with his bow the whole time.
Steve laughs, low and frustrated. He scrubs a hand roughly through his wet hair. He’s so soft like this. Beautiful, even in his anger. “Why can’t you just say what you mean?”
“Fine,” Tony said, caught somewhere between amusement and sheer, all-encompassing confusion. He glanced over Rogers: his clenching hands, his tight jaw, the awkward shift of his feet. “Alright, Sheriff.” He smiled, reaching back to untie his apron. He hung it on its hook, then turned, running a hand over the back of his neck. “How about a drink?”
Let me repeat that: ALL EXPERIENCES ARE VALID. If someone does not think they’ve experienced trauma, and they don’t have PTSD or any sort of trauma response to an event I would consider traumatic, it doesn’t matter what I think about it, and vice versa. It matters what the survivor (or not, if they don’t feel that word applies to them) feels.
“What the hell are we gonna do?” Rhodey demands, brow furrowed. He looks at Tony. “He’s right. One hit could kill you, Tones.”
“Your so-called ‘Spidey Senses’ are an imperfect tool. They do not tell you what you are sensing, just that you are sensing
What was startling was Tony’s reaction. His brain scans hadn’t betrayed any abnormalities. By all measures, Tony is processing information as normally as possible for someone of Tony Stark’s calibre. But the discovery that there is nothing to suggest that Tony has been hallucinating was not enough to soothe Tony’s frayed nerves. If anything, it sent him into overdrive. More than once Jim has come into the workshop to find Tony strung out on too much coffee and too little sleep, his hands shaking. He is a master of soothing Tony’s tattered nerves, of gentling him into rest. A small, bitter part of Steve knows that this is something Jim has seen and done many more times than he can know, and it makes him jealous enough to want to dig his fingers into Tony’s hips, his wrists, and leave his mark there.
His phone’s ringing. Bruce, probably, but he doesn’t want to talk to Bruce. He closes his eyes, lets his head tip back against the back of the lounger. If he closes his eyes, all that matters is the sun and the sound of the ocean.
“I will tell you as soon as I hear anything from or about him,” JARVIS says, for what feels like the millionth time. “Sir, I strongly suggest that you seek the help of another magic-user. Mr. Odinson, at the very least-”
His head snaps back, twisting around as the other side cracks into the side of the elevator. Someone shouts, and there’s the sound of guns being drawn and people rushing towards them, the chatter of a crowd. When he stands up, six of Stark Industries’ finest are pointing guns at Steve from out of arm’s reach, flanked by a group of startled R&D employees. None of them even waver, brave motherfuckers. Steve looks horrified at himself, completely open, and Tony pulls himself up with the elevator rail in time to see Pepper clacking towards them, entire form blazing with righteous glory.
They walked in companionable silence for a few moments, peeking into the open windows of their neighbours to see set tables, small gifts, candles.
“You haven’t answered my question,” Steve whispered, leaning in towards the glass. He wanted so badly to touch Tony.
“Cap!” Tony shouts, to no avail. He sends the legionnaire after him, some use that’ll do. He can’t see anything, and he can’t get close. “Fucking Christ on a pogo stick, Cap, just get your ass back out here-”
“You just don’t like that I hired an old fling,” Tony says, raising an eyebrow. “Beth and I go back. She’s good people, and I needed a new head of security after I gave all the job perks to Pepper. Along with, y’know, the job.”
“You don’t have much of one even with the coffee,” Steve drawls, amused. He sits up, pulling his hand back. “You’re uncomfortable.”
“Any magic performed on my colleagues will be taken as an act of aggression,” Tony says mildly, stepping between them. Amora’s sneers, raising a hand, then flinches at whatever she encounters.
Tony’s expression shifts, undecipherable for a breath, before his brows furrow. His mouth quirks, dry as bone, and Steve realises he’s been standing in the elevator gaping at Tony’s abs for a solid ten seconds. Like a brute. Like he’s twelve and stupid with lust because he’s just discovered what his knot is for.
Tony melts underneath his ministrations. His breathing deepens, and he presses his face into Steve’s skin, eyes closed. There’s a tension to him that won’t leak out: a small sliver of it, in his shoulders and fingers, like he’s holding on to something. Steve pets him along his spine and waits. He knows Tony has never been afraid to speak his mind. He will say what he wants to say when he’s ready to say it.
“A repeat, huh?” Happy asks, and Tony tips his head back and closes his eyes. He remembers Lacey’s perfect French manicure gently resting against the arc reactor, soft brown eyes gleaming up at him from beneath thick eyelashes.
Alarmingly, Tony seems to know exactly what he’s thinking, because his head turns towards Steve. Amusement and shock war on his face before he seems to settle on amusement, and Steve remembers with a dizzying rush of embarrassment what Tony had said about sometimes being able to feel strong emotion. He reaches out and takes Tony’s closest hand into his lap.
The sound of frustration Steve lets out at that approaches a scream. “Please, I’ll come again, as many times as you want, you know I can-”
“I’m fine, mom,” Clint says, wrinkling his nose at him. Tash snickers from where she’s pulling out a tumbler, a trio of shot glasses, and a fat snifter from Tony’s well-stocked cabinets. She drops an ice ball into the tumbler. “Dr. Cho patched me up good as new.” He pulls the edge of his t-shirt up to reveal a patch of raw, pink skin. All other evidence of the burn he’d seen on Tony’s footage is gone. Clint pulls his shirt back down, and Steve stares at the front of it with a small frown. There’s some sort of shelled green monster on it, with a purple eye mask and a bō staff.
We’re getting to the good stuff soon, y’all. I’ve had a good few chapters written of the resolution to some of these ridiculous plotlines I’ve been running for a long time now. I’m so excited to get to them, because those initial little plot bunnies are the reason I started this story in the first place.
“What thing?” she snaps, and Tony closes his eyes and tries to get it together. “I’m trying to get to a very important meeting with the EPA, Tony-”
He curls himself around Tony’s body, shaking like a leaf, and Tony leans into him with a wrecked sound that Steve feels in his very bones. But he can feel it, is the thing. He can feel Tony’s hands fumbling along his cheekbones, tracing his jaw, his nose, his gasping mouth.
Steve considers this. He holds it up to the proverbial light, turning it, weighing the pros and cons. “Tony won’t much like being forced into something like that,” he murmurs, considering. “But it might be good for him, actually. To know that’s what the team wants, and to hear why. I’d get to be in the field, watch his back, provide support without being in charge. And for all that we fight, Tony will listen to me on tactical decisions. He might not agree, but he’ll listen. We tend to do a lot of that together, anyway.” He chances a glance at Xavier’s inscrutable face. “You’re a dangerous man, Professor.”
Oh, Tony knows he’s going to pay for that favour later. He stands up, ignoring the clamour that ignites, and fixes Coulson with a look. “Get your house in order, Agent.”
“I can’t,” Tony says, because they’ve had this conversation before. They’re trying to undo everything that Thanos did, and that means the hope that Pepper and Peter and Happy and everyone can come back. “I…we were talking about
Tony’s showered and re-applied his blockers, of course, but he’s sure Steve can smell him. He’d forgotten what it was like to have an effect on someone that way. It’s been so long since he lived with someone new; his inner circle is mostly used to his scent by now. He’d thought Steve was used to him, too, but he supposes that isn’t necessarily fair. His scent is a hundred times more potent right now. And in Steve’s mind, he keeps reminding himself, they’re already Bonded. Of course Tony’s pheromones hit him like a brick.
“What?” he says, voice barely above a whisper, and Tony smiles and presses a kiss to the corner of his mouth.
“Fuck,” Tony said, and Steve chuckled low. Sometimes, he thought this just might be his favourite thing in the world; Tony, weak and panting under him, that beautiful brain of his focussed on Steve and what he could do with his tongue, his lips, his fingers. “I-…”
“Can I talk to you for a second?” Steve says, and then he’s taking Tony by the elbow and dragging him off, and that’s just-
“It’s like dating a teenager,” Tony said, but he was laughing. He hooked an arm around Steve’s and dragged him towards the gym showers. “Come on, pretty boy.”
Beth shoves Tony under the spray, not waiting for the water to get warm. Tony yelps, but he doesn’t shout at her or even really protest. Instead he just stands there morosely under the spray. Beth fetches up against the sink counter, her arms folded across her chest, and watches Tony through the frosted glass of the shower. Her expression is resolutely pitiless.
“You’ll see,” Tony says, happy crow's feet at the corners of his eyes, and Steve reaches a hand out without thinking, brushing a thumb against his cheekbone. Tony’s eyes widen, and Steve coughs and pulls his hand away.
“You think I am being controlled,” she says, slowly. She’s barely even breathing heavily. The only sign of fatigue is the way she’s holding her body; slightly to the left, from where Cap had caught her ribs. Then, strangely, she steps back once, twice, and falls into a kind of parade rest. Steve and Clint freeze, watching her with narrowed eyes. “JARVIS, is that true?”
“Ok, I’ll bite,” he says, when it’s clear Bruce isn’t going to say anything. “How can we be Pack Bonded without a Pack leader?”
“The Parker boy did something to May’s stove. Think you could have a looksee, figure out what’s what?”
I ever met a ghost?” He shrugs, waving his waffle. “Don’t think so? But hey, I’m sure somebody has. The soul stone exists. Have you asked Strange?”
After spending a week with Tony, his body had readjusted to its usual schedule. Tony needed the healing sleep though, and Steve knew that as soon as he let him, he’d be burying himself in the workshop for days to catch up on everything he’d missed. As it was, it was difficult to pry him away from his office. He’d mostly only managed it through sex, and while Tony was too smart to not know what Steve was doing, he could also count the number of times that Tony had said no to sex on one hand.
“Sorry,” Tony said, halfway through. He grinned at Steve, a little bashful. “It’s been a while since we did this. I’m talking your ear off.”
Tony sits up with a startled shout, his hands coming up automatically in repulsor position even as his brain registers the voice he’s hearing. The Æsir himself––
Steve flinched. He knew that, rationally. The arc’s metal casing broke the skin around Tony’s sternum, had replaced it in some places, and it made him more vulnerable to disease. He’d read the files. He knew.
“I invited him to brunch! What more do you want from me,” Tony says, and Steve doesn’t need his eyes to read the disbelieving quality of Bruce’s silence.
Tony closes his eyes and tries to remember his position in the air, the distance to the ground, the angle of the shot. “Do it,” he says, and when JARVIS’ handling shuts off he lets himself drop.
“Bless you, J,” Tony whispers gratefully. Then he lets JARVIS lever him to standing, the motions slightly less graceful than they might be if he was piloting the suit himself. “Fuck.”
Thor tilted his head, considering. “Is it not necessary for me to go to Tony? He is the alpha. He may be able to overpower any of the rest of the team with presence alone, if he is distressed or angry enough. Midgardians are fierce when their mates are threatened. We have long known this in Asgard. The brutality that can be birthed from the primal need to protect is where the tales of berserkers originate.”
Loki: Or, you could do that again. That’s cool. That’s fine. I’m not shouldering the entire burden of preparing for Thanos’ army or anything because I literally don’t have anyone who trusts me.
“Riri,” Natasha called, and Steve startled. He hadn’t even heard her approach. “Is there a reason you can’t come out and join us, even if Tony can’t? Are you boxed in?”
“No,” he said, but he didn’t sound sure, even to himself. Tony studied him, an inscrutable frown on his face. "I don't know. Not...not consciously."
When he was finally able to make it to the Google homepage, he still didn’t know if he was making the right choice. He shouldn’t have gone looking in the cabinet. It was none of his business what Tony was taking, and why, if it wasn’t integral to his overall health.
Natasha is probably the person on the team he’s trusted most to take this burden from him. If she’s been a double agent since Amora first showed up, he has no idea what the hell they’re going to do. Natasha has been his confessor, his left hand, and his last resort. He cannot abide by the idea that all this time, she’s been compromised.
“I understand,” Steve says. He may not like it, but he gets it. “I think I should maybe talk to him, too.”
He regretted the choice later, but not for the reasons he’d thought. He’d been brought to tears, nearly, by how much of Tony he’d seen in the book. They’d still been rough, then. They hadn’t been quite back to speaking terms yet. And he’d stopped, at this little passage, just the smallest thing: “and I am still this / machine.” Two simple lines, but enough to make him take a moment and swallow. He’d taken a break, drank half his coffee. Then he’d opened the book back up. And then, again, in “Hangover”: “It’s all been so beastly / lovely / this mad river, / this gouging / plundering / madness / that I would wish upon / nobody / but myself, / amen.” After “Bluebird” he hadn’t been able to keep going. He’d put the book down and sat with his head in his hands in Tompkins Square Park, all around him dogs barking and little old folks taking their daily walks, and he’d thought: so this is it. This will be the thing I regret most for the rest of my life.
Tony knows him far too well. He didn’t need the added advantage of a psychic connection to read him. He didn’t even need to see his face.
Steve could hear the emphasis on the words, the way the weight hung there, waiting for Steve to catch it. He could remember the exact shape of his mark on Tony, the silvery sheen of it against his skin, the sore redness of it when he’d refreshed it after a cycle spent together. He knew every imprint of every tooth that he’d left on Tony’s skin.
“No, no,” Tony tells him. He gets it. Steve wants cuddles after a near-death scare. “Come on in. Water’s tepid.”
“Anything,” Tony promises recklessly. “Let me shower, and you can have me however you want. As many times as you want. Steve-!”
“You are a menace, Steven,” Tony tells him. Then, belying his words, he leans in and kisses one corner of Steve’s unrepentant grin. “I love you more than all of the tentacles in the multiverse.”
Steve’s chair scrapes against the tile, and Tony glances across the table to see that he’s stood up. His blue eyes are wide. He’s looking at Tony like he’s never seen him before.
. Invasive, stupid questions that were more likely than not to offend Tony, or worse, hurt his feelings. Thinking back, he’d realised that this is what Tony meant when he’d apologised to Steve about not wearing blockers. He’d said that he knew his scent was weird, that he should have warned him. He’d been surprised by the idea of Steve liking his scent. He must have thought that Steve was acting like some kind of bigot. Like always. He’d hurt Tony, again, without even knowing it, because he couldn’t control his own stupid knot. It’s no wonder that Tony had been nervous to bring up the idea of his heat. He’d probably thought Steve was going to act like every ruthless alpha stereotype from the pictures. Based on previous experiences, Steve isn’t so sure that he wouldn’t. He just can’t seem to control himself around Tony. All he wants to do is touch him. Everywhere. He wants to put his mouth all over him. He wants-
“Right. Tony, I…” He stops, takes a breath. That familiar, stubborn bravery Tony loves and hates in equal measure takes over him, and then his chin comes up. His hand tightens around Tony’s thigh, and it’s delicious enough that Tony’s eyes flutter shut for just the barest half of a second.
“I’m staking my claim, remember?” Steve panted. He dipped his head, sucking a brutal, visible mark high enough on Tony’s neck that he’d have to cover it with makeup to prevent it from being seen. He’d probably regret that later, but for now Tony sighed like a song and curled up into him like he’d never felt anything better, and that alone was enough to bring him to the edge. He pulled back, eyes fighting to stay open as he bit his lip and stared down at Tony, working his cock and sweeping a possessive gaze over miles of lovely, tanned olive skin.
“Relax, Capsicle,” he says, and Steve frowns instinctively at the name. “You don’t have to pretend you didn’t know him.”
“I’m not,” he promises. He wipes at his eyes with his thumb, then reaches out to touch Steve’s hand. Steve sucks in a breath, then immediately turns his wrist over. He clutches Tony’s hand like he’s going to fly away. “I know I’m- I mean, I know this isn’t what you wanted. But you’re actually the real fucking deal, aren’t you?”
He says it easily, considering it’s the first time he’s said as much to anyone since his run in with Strange. But his relationship with Reed has always been mystifying to Steve. Reed understands parts of Tony that no one else on Earth ever will.
“There’s been no answer from the Sanctum, and my algorithms have found no footage of him more recent than that of six days past. I suspect he is off world.”
“Will you marry me?” Steve recited dutifully, kissing Tony’s brow, his crinkled eyes, the corner of his mouth and everyone was watching and cheering and nothing was better than this.
“You scared the hell outta us, Iron-Man,” he watches himself say, and says, and both ache like a stone’s lodged in his throat. But Tony had just winked at him, even as weariness was writ into his bones, even as Steve can now see in retrospect that he was gearing up for a fight, for Steve to chastise him, to defend himself.
“I don’t want you to feel pressured,” he tried, but he really wanted to spend his next heat with Tony. He wanted the bite. He wanted to try.
Tony’s expression shutters. It’s not what he meant to say, and Steve winces, cursing his own cowardice. He opens his mouth, but finds himself at a loss for words.
"No fucking way!" Clint says, slamming his hand down on the table. Bruce turns to look at him, and he shrinks back into his chair. "Sorry."
“So, first off,” Tony said, voice amplified over the speaker system, “sorry about the heteronormativity. Gentleman, you all know I’m more than happy to entertain you as well.”
“Okay,” Tony murmurs. He leans in and rests his face in the soft curve of Steve’s neck. His stomach grumbles loudly, and Steve laughs.
“Yes,” JARVIS says, sounding impossibly tired. It’s moments like this when Steve understands why Tony treats JARVIS like he’s a real person.
By the time Tony’s bundled into the car with Happy—after, of course, leaving a hefty tip for both Taesha and the overly-polite porter who’d taken him downstairs—he’s about ready to take a horse pill. His head feels like it’s going to burst.
“How long have you been doing this?” Tony asks him, and Steve sets the remote down with the kind of deliberate care that means he’s trying not to break it. Tony’s seen him do it before, with objects or people, when he doesn’t trust himself to control his own strength.
“Captain,” JARVIS said, and Steve’s vision swum clear, until he found himself stalled at the heat room door.
He throws himself over Tony just as the glass shatters, the car flipping over against the barrier and tumbling, hitting an oncoming SUV and spinning wildly on its back like a beetle before a second car hits it back into the concrete barrier, flipping it over again. He should have blacked out in the pinball, he knows, but instead he watches with numb horror as the car stops moving, Tony as lifeless as a ragdoll under his hands. There’s blood dripping from Tony’s temple where he cracked his head on the window, and Steve reaches for him, weakly, disoriented.
JARVIS’ silence felt judgemental, but maybe he was just projecting. Steve didn’t have the emotional energy to feel much more than a twinge of guilt for being so tetchy. DUM-E helped him over to the couch, and Steve fell more than sat down on it. The couch, at least, smelled equally of him and Tony. He spent enough time down here that he was kind of surprised there wasn’t a dip in the couch. He knew for certain that if anyone took a blacklight to it, they’d probably have to throw the old thing out on principle. Tony had fucked him over it so many times it probably qualified as a biohazard.
Guilt crawled up out of his stomach like a monster, clogging his throat with a sudden swell of tears. He couldn’t cry, with the mask on, so he fought them back as hard as he could, blinking rapidly to clear the moisture away. He patted Bruce awkwardly on the back until the man let him go, looking a little abashed but mostly determined.
“Why are you asking me stupid questions?” Tony says tiredly. “Look, I have a lot of work I need to catch up on, so-”
“No, Steve’s convictions came from a deep and abiding purity of thought. He believed—wholly and uncompromisingly—in things that most people left by the wayside. That I have left by the wayside, more times than I care to confess. Things we so often discard as plebeian or naïve: truth, justice, compassion-”
“No!” Tony shouts, and Steve flinches back at the force of it. “No one can see me like this. I’m- I’m fucking, I’m going crazy. I’m losing my mind. I just need to sleep.”
. Steve’s vision whited out, his back arching as he came apart. He felt like he’d been electrocuted, every muscle in its body realigning itself to where it had been meant to be. His skin was on fire. The feel of Tony’s teeth in his bondmark was everything he’d been wanting for weeks, and when Tony’s tongue and teeth slid over him he came, his orgasm hitting him so suddenly that he stopped breathing entirely, his whole body tight with the shock. There was nothing but Tony’s hands, his mouth, his scent and his skin and his voice careening through Steve’s blood like a song.
“Gotcha. Thanks, J.” Tony strides towards the door to the landing platform, waving it open and walking out with his hands spread wide. “I wasn’t expecting visitors, or I would have put together a spread. You’re ruining my epic host rep.”
Tony takes a photo with the sound on. The artificial shutter sound makes Steve shudder. He pulls out, until just the very tip of him is breaching Steve’s body, then takes another photo.
Tony yawns, then swings his legs over the side of the bed. “Library,” he decides. “I don’t want to be overheard.”
“We’ll play it by ear,” Tony said, and that wasn’t a no. Steve was willing to take what he could get.
“Alright,” Steve says. It sounds less like acceptance than a ceasefire, but that’s how it is between them. It’s what Tony expects, more than anything else. “Wanna get cleaned up, or sleep?”
Steve shook his head, hands clenching at his sides. That little speech had taken all the bravery he had, and now he just felt small and stupid and wrong. Omegas weren’t supposed to be the ones to propose a bonding, or push for one, or ask someone to marry them for god’s sake. He was fucking everything up, as always.
Steve nods, then sits, resting the bouquet on the edge of Pepper’s impeccably clean desk. “Tony and I had a talk, worked some things out. So I thought I should come by, and settle things between us, if I could.”
Tony’s bare legs were spread into a wide isosceles in the photo, his hands deep in the pockets. The black leather was bunched up in front between his open thighs in a swaggering kind of tease, and Steve’s eyes lingered there for far too long, his pulse pounding so hard he could feel it in his throat. There was an beguiling gender duality to it. Tony was young and nubile, bare-faced, but still strikingly handsome rather than pretty or soft. The way he held himself was confident, alpha, but the spread legs dusted with dark hair suggested something else. Behind him a long, lonely white beach broken only by tall grass and a short, broken fence made of strips of narrow sun-bleached wood and twisted wires stretched out for miles. There was a tousled, dirty-sexy kind of greaser look about him that Steve recognised from some of the films he’d watched, and it fit who Tony was precisely. Golden hour brought out the shine in his curls, and he looked up at the camera from under thick eyelashes. It was perhaps the most compelling photo Steve had ever seen. Darkly beautiful and wild, Tony looked exactly as he was: undefinable, and defiant, and proud. The sidebar said it all; STARK TRUTH: The Future is Anti-Dynamicism. The person who’d posted it had captioned it: Tony Stark’s historic shoot with Pamela Hanson for
“We don’t control the U.S. government, Ms. Hill,” Senator Durbin says mildly. He’d been mostly quiet throughout the proceedings, but Tony knew that wasn’t unusual. As the Democratic whip, most of his work was done in the shadows. If anything, he was surprised that Cochran had been as open has he had; likely a result of their personal relationship.
He comes for a long time, and when he’s done, he slumps forward entirely into Tony’s hold, boneless. He’s still shaking, shivers all over his body, and he whines and squirms at the realisation that Tony is still deep inside of him, thrusting slow and languid.
The silence that stretches between them is interminable. Tony breathes shallow and slow, desperately controlled. Steve himself is shaking in place, his fingers clearly fighting fists, and he’s blocking the exit to the bar. Tony’s trapped, and he can’t get out, and Steve has already hit him once and he isn’t wearing his cuffs and he’s compromised. Amora has clearly compromised him. God, is he even Steve? Loki can turn into other people, who knew if this was even Steve-
“If he was there for a while, his personality began to show. A smile. The choice to humiliate me is all Barnes, by Steve’s stories. It’s the kind of thing I could imagine Steve doing to a cocky recruit, if he was still in the service.” Natasha shakes her head, her eyes clouded. “They put these memories inside of my head. I don’t know which ones are mine, and which ones belong to other Widows. The scent of a favourite perfume, when the perfume hasn’t been produced since the 40’s. I took ballet lessons, but I also have memories of dancing as a prima ballerina for the Bolshoi, and I’ve checked the records. That never happened. I was never a ballerina, and yet I can dance
He turned to Fury, who was watching them all with an unreadable expression. “You were going to say something.”
JARVIS helpfully zeroes in on a few problem areas. Then Steve shifts on the sofa, making the leather creak. Tony restrains the urge to toss him out.
“You should probably sit down,” he says, and gestures to the couch. “JARVIS, let us know if Widow’s on the move.”
-” Tony snaps, hyperaware of Steve’s presence behind him, but he’s never been able to stop Natasha Romanov from doing anything she wanted.
“That man knows far too much about our sex life already,” Steve complains, and Tony snorts and shakes his head, blinking the world into focus. Steve is utterly, truly filthy. He’s got come splattered on the bottom of his chin, over his chest, and also on the edge of the tub and onto the bath mat. He’s bruised everywhere, little magenta and violet circles from Tony’s mouth and suckers. There’s a handful of red scrapes from Tony’s nails across his chest and stomach. His lips are bitten red.
“Just fun,” Tony repeats, and Happy hmms noncommittally. “Cap and I aren’t fully bonded, yet, anyway.” He tilts his neck to the side to show his unmarked boding gland. “No bite.”
“You broke three ribs last time a building fell on you. One of your lungs collapsed before Thor was finally able to pull you out,” Pepper says, sounding exhausted.
“Riri,” Natasha asked, quiet now as she headed towards the entrance. “If Steve can’t hear Tony, how come Tony can hear Steve?”
In that way, Loki was an easy choice. There was no worry about living up to anything Loki had done or was. Loki had been beautiful and willing. Dangerous and complicated, to be sure, but that had never stopped Tony from doing anything. He genuinely doesn’t remember a time when he didn’t know how to disassemble a firearm. Servicing a beautiful weapon had always been where a Stark was most at home. There is nothing else he loves more than breaking something open and putting it back together again better than before.
If he finishes the rest of his sentence, Tony doesn’t understand it through his spluttering. It’s child’s play to manipulate Steve under the water, pulling him flat and then collapsing on top of him for good measure. Water sloshes over the side of the tub as Steve rears up, roaring with outrage and laughter. His eyes are shining with mirth, muscles taut as they grapple, and Tony can’t stop laughing. He loses the fight quickly by virtue of his own helpless wheezing, the kind of laughter so deep and long that it makes his sides ache.
,” he cried, and oh, that was embarrassing. His voice broke horrifically over the words, thickness building in his throat. “I was willing to wait, but I would have been fine if you’d never told me. It was your choice. I was forced into playing alpha, but you-”
“I’m glad I could give you some pleasure,” Steve teases, warmly amused, and Tony can feel his face get hot. He’s always so thankful his Italian skin can’t betray his embarrassment. “Can I borrow your shower?”
,” Steve says. He’s crying, and it’s his own damn funeral, and he’s right here. He’s less than twenty feet from Tony’s untouchable, tear-tracked face. “Tony, you stupid, beautiful bastard.”
“Wet leaves in autumn,” Steve said, because he knew Tony’s scent now as well as he knew how to hold his shield. “Metal. Electricity. Something sharp, tangy, a little musky that I don’t have names for. Good.”
“You’re such a brat,” Tony said, but he was laughing, and Steve could feel it move through him like thunder. “Jesus. You’re all a bunch of absolute maniacs.”
“Impatient,” Tony chides, and Steve groans, struggling against the coils around his thighs. He scratches his fingernails over Tony’s scalp, squirming deliciously as he tries to get more friction. “Do you even know how octopodes mate?”
Tony leans down and takes a kiss, this one deeper than the others. He slips his tongue into Steve’s mouth, slow and sexy and a little filthy, and Steve takes it. He closes his eyes and lets Tony take whatever he wants from him. He bunches his fingers in Tony’s shirt to keep him close, traces his fingers over the muscles in his back.
“After three weeks of not knowing if your mate was alive and healthy, you’re lucky you’re even standing,” Clint continued, stubborn. “The only thing that’s keeping you up is the serum and stubbornness.”
“Right…” Steve scratches at his head. He glances over at Hulk. “Okay. First thing’s first, you’re hungry, right? Why don’t we get some food in you, and then we can figure out the next step.”
“No, it hasn’t,” JARVIS agrees ruefully, helpfully opening the doors for him before he even has to call for the car. Tony flashes a grin and steps inside.
“You chose to stay down here for over 24 hours and not eat. You can wait two minutes to wash your hands properly.”
“Sorry,” Steve murmurs, taking Tony’s face between his hands. He presses their foreheads together. “I’m sorry.”
“I know, baby, I’m sorry.” Tony mouthed over his bondmark again, running his teeth gently over it and clutching hard at Steve’s waist when his knees buckled. A soft whine tumbled out of his throat, and Tony snarled and did it again.
People kept saying that, but Steve didn’t think it felt true anymore. He wasn’t sure if it ever had, because of all the things that he knew Tony was after coming back from Afghanistan, ‘fine’ wasn’t one of them. Traumatised, angry, desperate to keep his secrets, and thirsting for revenge, certainly, but fine? Well. Steve didn’t know that Tony had ever been ‘fine’ in his whole damn life.
“You’re just upset Ben and Jerry’s gave me a flavour and not you,” Tony teased, but he fed Steve another spoonful.
“As opposed to my other organs?” Tony says, wiggling his eyebrows at Steve through the glass reflection. Steve bites down on the inside of his lip. “You don’t like Beth.”
Tony blinks at him. “I don’t understand,” he admits, and Steve frowns at him. Then his expression shifts, something dark and pained taking over him.
Loki grins, following Tony back into the bedroom and watching him pull on his socks. He floats the towels back into the bathroom with a wave of his hand, and Tony tries not to think about how domestic this all is while he laces his sneakers.
One of the government rats clears his throat, and Tony spears the entire table with a flat glare, eyes narrowed as he searches for answers. He’s always hated these clandestine emergency meetings with defence higher-ups. They always end up being full of major fuckups that need fixing, and somehow he’s always the one they want to fix it. Today, it seems, is no different.
“That’s not...” Steve huffs, frustrated. He’s not explaining this right. He thinks of that moment on the balcony, where Tony put his wrists behind Steve’s ears and he felt like he could breathe for the first time he woke up from the ice. He thinks about Tony’s scent going sour and pained and not understanding what he’d done to cause it. “I try. And he tries too, I know he does. It’s just, no matter how hard we try we can’t get it right.”
“I had my things with me when they took me,” Tony said, a wry smile taking over his face. “I always carry a month’s worth of medication on me, just in case. They didn’t read English, so when they were emptying my pockets, Yinsen convinced them it was medically necessary medication. We stretched the injections out to every two weeks to slow the process, at first, but-” Tony swallowed, pausing, and Steve held out a hand.
And well, Tony doesn’t have anything to say to that, so he keeps his mouth shut. He sits down at the table, taking the bowl Thor presses into his hands and watching him settle back at the end of the table across from Tony.
He glances down at the skirt of tentacles that currently make up the lower half of his body, and a frisson of heat shimmers up his spine. They’re a beautiful, deep carnelian red. Tiny chromatophores of darker bloody scarlet and brilliant, bio-luminescent gold dot the landscape of slick skin like freckles, able to shift in pattern and shade if he tries hard enough. Bone white suckers line the underside in perfect rows, gleaming and thickly muscled, bluish in the shadows of their folds.
“No, you aren’t,” Bruce retorts, but he straightens enough to pull out of Tony’s grasp. “This is going to end so badly.”
He wants to ask. Then again, considering how he’s handling Loki, he probably doesn’t want to know. “Why’s that?”
“Of course she is,” JARVIS agrees, unabashed. “Why do you think Mx. Tan now handles all your publicity appointments?”
“I’ve smelled blood.” His voice was rough, his accent skittering in long before this, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop. “Blood smells like iron, Tony, but iron doesn’t smell like blood. You smell like metal. Warm metal, and power.”
Pepper laughs shortly, shaking her head and spreading her hands on the desk. Steve gapes at her, opens his mouth, but no words come out. It’s for the best, because it seems she isn’t done yet.
When he came to, his head was pillowed on Tony’s shoulder, his whole body slumped forward into his arms. Tony was laughing, a little vicious, definitely smug. His eyes were bright and feral when Steve draw back to see them, and Steve whimpered, knees spreading without his permission.
When Tony arrives back at the penthouse, he finds Loki curled up in the corner of his couch. It’s later than he’d wanted it to be, but admittedly not more than he’d expected. Anytime he was on the hill it was a free for all. JARVIS and Pepper conspired to sign him up for every possible meeting and dinner and handshake they could wrestle from his exhausted body, and while he usually fought such things tooth and nail, this time he’d played perfect. The situation, unfortunately, warranted it.
“I think the American public would like to know what kinds of people they’re living next to, sending their children to school with.”
Tony rubs a hand over his face. “You’re being incredibly manipulative while I’m vulnerable and exhausted,” he complains.
“Oh, boy.” Steve scrubs a hand over his face. “We had a good talk, about…secrets. Boundaries. I think we’ve crossed a bridge.”
“Do you know what you’re doing?” Bruce asks, not looking up from where he’s pouring Tony another cup of coffee.
“And I don’t want to box you in again,” Steve continues. He has the grace to look sheepish, at the very least. “I don’t…I’m sorry I didn’t notice. You never told me. I know, with- I mean. It makes sense. We’ve both read each other’s files. But. I’m sorry. I only figured that out recently.”
“They need him,” Tony muses, considering. He rolls the ice around the walls of the glass, watching the amber liquid swirl in oil-slick patterns with the ice-melt. “They didn’t want him transferred here. You would have wanted him here, with you, and this place is a fucking fortress. They couldn’t reach him here, which means they needed him somewhere they could fetch him later. Because they need him. What do they need him for?”
When he steps out onto the landing pad, Steve is sitting on the edge of the roof. He’s paying absolutely no mind to the precipitous drop below him. In his lap is a sketchbook: familiar terrain. His hands move over the page in confident lines, smooth arches. Every part of him is carefully controlled, and Tony knows from experience that this is Steve trying to pour himself onto the page. He hasn’t quite figured out what the trick is to knowing when Steve will turn to the gym or the studio. They seem to soothe different hurts in him. If pressed, Tony might say that Steve turned to art when his feelings were too complex to excise through short bursts of violence. Anger, frustration, sex: these were things that Steve could translate into physical motion, could transmute into energy and push through his skin as sweat. It was things like saudade or bewilderment that perfused into Steve’s blood and settled there like a lead weight, poisoning him from the inside.
Tony snorts. “Don’t think I don’t know you were aiming for three all along. You’re not a good negotiator.”
Steve is interested in who killed him, of course, but presently he’s got two more pressing things on his mind: first, he’s worried about the fact that Tony’s clearly driving himself crazy with guilt and grief, and second, he hasn’t been able to touch Tony again since that first time. He’s tried a handful more times to get as far away from Tony as possible, but Tony’s too preoccupied with piecing together CCTV footage and trying to gather data from the tissue they’d scraped from Steve’s wounds to notice the tug. He’s constantly on the phone with the Hanks, T’Challa, even finally calling Stephen, which is how Steve knows he’s desperate. Tony hates to rely on magic for anything.
Widow tilts her head to the side, and then her brow furrows. Natasha slips out from behind the mask, bemused. She stops moving, her fists flexing open, then closed again.
Steve glances up at Tony from over his shoulder. His eyes are crinkled at the corners. “Of course,” he says, mouth twitching.
Tony lifted his glass, a wry grin spreading over his mouth. “I recall something about water into wine, wine into blood being a part of the good Lord’s word. Am I wrong?”
Pepper shakes her head, glancing at the gathered crowd, and Tony exhales. Right. He’s still leaning an elbow on Dr. Chandrakar. Awkward. He pulls away, swaying slightly, then stands up on his own. “You can’t kick Captain America out of The Avengers. It was an argument. Forget about it.”
“Most of the team is prepped and ready to move,” she says, handing him his coffee. “Hawkeye is putting some finishing touches on his arrows, something Banner gave him. I’m not sure I want to know.”
“Because our only lead is in Tampa, FL. If I want to run a non-Avengers recon mission under such thin pretences, I need to fill out an annoying amount of paperwork.”
A visible shudder moves through Steve’s body in a wave. His eyes snap shut, his whole body shaking in Tony’s grasp. The sound he makes is close to a whimper. “
“You’re not sure a relationship with me is what’s best for Tony.” And then, after a slight pause, “Oh. No. You don’t think a relationship with me would be good for Tony at all.”
“Oh, God,” Tony says. His whole body trembles, one hand reaching up to cover his mouth. He looks like he might go down, and Steve smiles at him and comes close and gathers him into his arms. He presses Tony’s face into his neck, buries his own face there, into the gap between jaw and shoulder. He inhales as deep as he can, until he’s dizzy with it: sweat, and metal, and that woodsy, herbal scent that Tony likes so much. Cedar, maybe, and oranges. “Oh, God, Steve.”
He pushes past Bruce without speaking, stumbling a little. Bruce makes an aborted sound, tries to catch at Tony’s arm, but Tony’s better at hand-to-hand combat than Bruce is. Bruce is a scientist, and the Hulk has always gotten by through brute force. He doesn’t know anything about how to use his soft, human body to hold someone who is trying to evade his grasp.
“Christ,” Steve whispered, wiping a hand over his face. Too late, he remembered he’d been working with pastels, the viscous oil smearing down the side of his face. “Damn.”
Steve blinked, baffled at the bait-and-switch. “I don’t understand,” he said, again. He pressed a gentle hand to the glass, wanting so desperately to touch Tony, to provide and receive comfort from his mate. He settled for Tony crouching down to meet him, pressing his forehead to the place where Steve’s hand was.
“You’re not gonna like it,” he admits, because he might as well give it up now. Natasha always gets what she wants. Clint raises an eyebrow at him. “I feel stupid for getting caught in the first place.” Clint’s mouth is open, ready to argue, but Steve holds up a hand. He stares down at the table, at the amber liquid in his glass. “I know what you’re going to say. But you wanted to know how I feel, so. That’s how I feel. Tony got me these tickets to the Botanical Gardens as a peace offering and I took my sketchbook to see the sakura festival and I don’t know what happened to it and I’m…pretty upset about it, honestly. I had some drawings in there I’m pretty sore about losing. And it was stupid, because I was completely unarmed and I left without telling anybody, but I just wanted some time to be myself. To be Steve Rogers, the artist, who-…”
Anyway, I looked kind of desperately for that really cute page of Tony and Reed singing along to the radio and driving together but I couldn't find it, so if someone wants to hit me in the comments w/ a link that would be great. The true comics #ScienceBros (for those of us who like to forget about Hank Pym on account of him being an abusive husband in Ults and a crappy one in 616 lol.) [/rant]
He hops up and down a little in the elevator, shaking his arms out. But when the doors open, a familiar low laugh curls into him like caramel. In his heightened state, Tony’s laughter is like a straight shot to his core. He can feel himself blushing, but he can’t stop and turn back.
Loki pulls back, clearly startled by this, and Tony laughs, pulling a tray of oysters on ice towards himself and poking at the shells.
Anyway, that’s my author meta. Hope you enjoy it. This is my first ever foray into FrostIron, so bear with me. (And don’t get me started on the Hydra reveal.)
“I can’t knot you,” Tony hissed, sounding frustrated as hell, and Steve whimpered, begged “no, alpha, please,” but Tony just shook his head. “I have a meeting, sweetness. There’s not enough time.”
It’s a little ink caricature of Tony. He’s standing in the middle of the workshop surrounded by his bots and holoscreens, brows furrowed, and there’s a little censored speech bubble emanating from his mouth. DUM-E is drooping in shame, and Tony can’t help but chuckle just a little at the image.
He disappears before Steve can dredge up a response to that. Tony has the decency to look sheepish, and Steve rubs at the back of his neck in the ensuing silence. Tony stands up, draining his glass and putting it in the dishwasher.
-” Tony growled, scrabbling at him, and Steve let himself be tugged. He was grinning, he knew, smug and happy, and when Tony kissed him it was rough and claiming and so good, lush, drugging kisses until Steve melted against him, unable to keep himself from plastering the whole of his body to Tony’s. He was wearing entirely too much clothing, but he couldn’t bear the idea of pulling away now. Instead, he pressed his face into Tony’s neck and breathed in the scent of him, still a little bit breathless and shivery.
“I have no other that might be considered a past love,” Thor protests, and Tony waves a hand at one of his displays.
is a good one. There was a major cultural revolution happening in Berlin right before the rise of the Reich. A bunch of prominent leftist thinkers, openly gay poets and theologians. Of course, then the Nazis showed up and murdered every single one of them, so.”
Steve closes the fridge to make it stop, and when he opens it up again a flash of hot pink catches his eye. A clear plastic container on the top shelf has “Steve” written on a sticky note in Natasha’s neat cursive. The name had been crossed out with a different pen, and “Ped Pa Lo 4 Rip Van Winkle” had been wedged in underneath in Tony’s blocky draftman’s hand. It was the only thing in the fridge that looked full.
“You not asking me about why I left him in Lagos doesn’t make any sense!” Steve says, throwing up his hands, but Tony is shaking his head because he’s sure, now.
“Hey! This is totally a Harry Potter moment,” Tony said, holding his hands up. “I did not put my name into the Goblet of Fire. On my honour.”
“The real Buck wouldn’t say that,” he tries, but it sounds hollow even to him. Metal flashes behind him in the shaving mirror, a streak of red on steel.
“Tell me what to do,” Tony said, but in his mouth the command turned dirty. Rogers laughed outright, but he gestured to the cast iron, then the cupboard with his uninjured hand.
Fifteen minutes later, Steve’s lying on the floor next to his cryochamber, shivering and feeling deeply disturbed. So it’s quite a shock when Tony walks into the room in the armour, the faceplate and gauntlets retracted.
“That’s not it,” he tries, but Steve isn’t having any of that. He rolls them with a quick movement, until Tony is pinned underneath him. He presses a soft kiss to Tony’s ear.
Steve shrugs. He glances across the street at the basketball court tucked into the corner, then sighs, because of course he doesn’t have…
“I’m sure you are,” Cabe says, insinuation dripping from a filthy purr, and Steve tries desperately to reign in the jealousy that flushes through him. Tony’s car salesman grin doesn’t help the situation, and Steve takes a breath and presses the button to close the privacy window.
Steve breathes for a second longer. Two. Tony can’t open his eyes. He doesn’t know if he can handle Steve looking at him. He’s trying so hard to hold himself together. Eventually, the soft hiss of background noise cuts out. He opens his eyes.
“Excuse me,” he says, reaching a hand out to a young woman passing by. “I’m looking for Doctor Charles Xavier?”
––is leaning insouciantly against the bedroom door, a sadistic kind of glee in his eyes, and Tony can immediately feel his hard-on beginning to soften as terror and embarrassment take him over in turns. He glances towards the bathroom door with panic building in his chest.
Tony smiles at him, leaning back against the counter and crossing his arms. He doesn’t have his bracelets, but he knows JARVIS is listening. “And why would you do that? I’m a big boy.”
Steve’d read the files. He knew that Natasha’s bonding gland had been rendered unusable by the Red Room, although he wasn’t sure exactly how that was possible. The idea of someone violating another human’s body that way made his blood curdle every time he thought about it. It made her scent much fainter than that of any other alpha, and it disappeared to nothing when she was on suppressants, which was almost always. Her lack of scent was probably a lot of why she hadn’t set Steve off entirely.
It was a little past noon the next day before anyone saw Tony return from the lab. Steve was in the kitchen pouring himself some juice while he read a news article on his tablet when he heard the elevator doors ring.
That said...there were times when he unexpectedly joined the team during fights that were getting a little hectic.
It was only a few minutes before Peter fell asleep, snoring quietly. Tony didn't last very long either, mumbling along to the movie with his eyes shut. Before long, the genius slumped down and face-planted against Steve's legs. There was no telling how long Tony had been awake, but it was clear that he was beyond exhausted.
Peter knew that it was high praise coming from Tony Stark. It was still difficult to believe he was even talking to the man, let alone watching him cook dinner.
Clint and Nat soon joined them as well. They introduced themselves to Spiderman and thanked him for his help, offering their companionship to the young hero. It was pretty obvious that Spiderman was still amazed that he had fought beside the Avengers, voicing his admiration towards his heroes.
It didn't take long for his team to arrive in the kitchen. For whatever reason, Hulk was the first to arrive with his large, lumbering frame filling the doorway.
So, Tony brought the kid home to meet the team and officially introduce their newest honorary member.
"That may be true but what if some young gun studly soldier gets the better of you, huh? What then? He could take out your legs because your shield is no bigger than a dinner plate!"
For the longest time, Steve kept his emotions in check and tried to ignore the envious feelings rising within him every time he had to watch someone receive Tony's affections. It was just something he got used to after awhile. It was easier to ignore the ache in his chest rather than confront Tony about it and risk destroying their friendship, something Steve knew he wouldn't be able to live without.
Also, the 'You're like a koala with cerebral palsy' line? My husband actually said that to me one time when he helped me down one day and for some reason it has stuck with me and is still funny.
. The rest of the team tease them about it and joke that Tony and Steve already adopted Peter and just don't want to tell anyone. Tony embraces it though, calling Peter his kid. Steve comes to see Peter as his own as well.
Peter stopped short, tripping over his own feet and slamming into the wall when he saw Tony Stark sitting on the sofa with May. The billionaire was chatting happily with May like they were old friends, sitting on the couch as if it were normal, sipping on a glass of tea.
The billionaire was practically vibrating from lack of sleep and an apparent overload of caffeine while Peter was hanging from the ceiling, upside down, writing notes in a notebook, looking just as strung out as Tony.
accounted for was a certain super soldier lounging about in his office, waiting for him. As it turns out, Steve had been waiting for Tony's return after the genius had left for S.I that morning, hanging out with the bots in the lab and drawing to pass the time.
"It's a carbon fiber that reacts on contact with air and forms into a tough, flexible fiber with adhesive properties."
During a press conference yesterday afternoon, Tony had represented the Avengers as always with Doctor Strange and Doctor Reed. It was to cover not only a battle that had happened earlier in the week but also to state S.I's new plans for reconstruction on developments that had been damaged by heroes, villains and SHIELD. Doctor Strange had proclaimed his alliance with the Avengers, once again giving Tony a small flirtatious smile and a wink on camera.
"You know I'd rather have you with me," Steve acknowledged. He grabbed the coffee pot and filled both his own mug and Tony's, reaching for the sugar container.
"I mean, really, he couldn't have come up with something more original?" Clint complained, firing another exploding arrow at the maniac terrorizing Brooklyn.
Tony continued his string of insults even as they began dragging him backwards. He wouldn't go down without a fight and he would give these fuckboys a run for their money.
Bruce felt his own heart drop when he heard that, knowing Fury must have done something to Peter. The Hulk started screaming inside his head. Before he could question Tony further, the billionaire was already running out the door with his phone in hand.
"Are we just gonna keep letting this guy break things or what?" Tony asked from above, flying past the jet as it hovered above the street. So far, Sandman had succeeded in smashing 10 city blocks in ways that put the Hulk to shame. His rampage had devastated apartment buildings, a police station, multiple businesses too. The team couldn't find a way of containing Sandman without using lethal force, and they were running out of time. If Sandman continued on like he was, the unknown death toll would only skyrocket.
“No,” Thor says, simply. “You are our friend, and it is the task of friends to care for one another as best they are able.”
Tony knows this, perhaps better than anyone. He rubs at his chest, self-conscious, and ignores Pepper’s steady gaze. “If I push that angle, I can get Ross to look un-American. Like he’s bowing to pressure from outside influence,” Tony hedges, but Pepper shakes her head again.
“I guess I’ll try to sleep and see what the situation is when I wake up,” he said, drying his hands in the dishtowel hanging from the oven handle. “But that’s a good idea, the workshop blanket. I’ve pulled out everything I could find from the laundry.”
He sucks in a deep breath, and the lack of burn in his throat more than anything is what pulls him from it. Once again, he is back in his body, his own mind.
“I can’t hear you,” Tony gasps, and Steve leans down and presses their foreheads together. “Your chest-”
But he can’t seem to stop, now. Tony shakes, the force of his sobs taking him harder than the pleasure had. He curls into a ball, into Steve’s chest, his whole body shaking with the force of it. It’s not the quiet crying Steve’s seen before: this is loud, and broken, unlike anything Steve’s ever seen from him. Tony’s fingers scrabble at his chest, up to his neck, feel there for a pulse that he knows means nothing.
He pushes the doors open, nodding to Pepper’s secretary. Steve had never particularly liked the woman, chiefly because she always seemed to be sneering at everyone. Her name always seemed a particular irony in light of how unhappy the woman always looked. “Ms. Bliss?”
Tony shudders. There’s fear in his face. Steve knows it well. It’s perhaps the least favourite of the expressions he’s familiar with. But he doesn’t push Steve away, and he doesn’t say anything else. He just subsides into hiccoughing breaths, pressing his forehead as firmly as he can to Steve’s. He tangles his fingers in Steve’s hair.
He hurtles into Doom instead. They go down in a rousing clatter, all metal on metal and cape, and in his ear Tony hears an all too familiar snicker as he tries to untangle himself from the mess. Doom's unconscious, and his comm is still offline.
“Like Cap’s best friend,” Beth says quietly. It is simultaneously the kindest and cruellest thing she could have possibly said, and Steve is so shocked at her words that he almost misses the blinding, beautiful smile that Tony looses in response. For that single, shining second he looks incandescently happy. His eyes crinkle at the corners. His teeth sparkle, white and straight and smooth.
“And we know Tony’s at least gonna have to be quarantined a few days, so it’s not necessary,” Steve filled in. He nodded, considering, then shrugged the sweatshirt on. It was too small, tight around the shoulders, but he immediately felt safer. Held.
“Please stop,” Tony begs him, and Steve sucks in a shaky breath. He tightens his hold on Tony’s hand.
“Please, can we not do this right now?” He points at Stephen. “How the hell was I gonna bring that up?”
and began pulling off her clothes, changing them out for an embroidered silk robe. “I didn’t use to get these before I had you, you know.”
“I’m fine,” Steve snaps, but he lets Tony take his hand and guide it to his neck, the other pressed to his chest beside the arc reactor so he can feel his heartbeat, his breathing.
Natasha was sitting cross-legged on the mats when he walked into the gym. Her expression was serene, and Steve smiled ruefully at her. He was nothing if not predictable.
“Well, this seems to be a pattern,” a familiar voice says, and Tony closes his eyes and tilts his head back to rest against cold metal, huffing a breath. “Perhaps you should keep more civilised company.”
Peggy dies, grey and beautiful and without knowing who he is, and Steve carries her coffin through wet London streets.
Steve nods, and stays quiet. He can sense that Jim is working up to a shovel talk, and he has the strange thought that maybe this is how other people feel when they talk to him. It makes an inappropriate burst of laughter nearly creep out from inside, but he stifles it down sternly. No one’s ever given Steve a shovel talk before. He doesn’t think it’s ever been warranted, but this one is. As always, Tony is special.
“Oh,” Steve said, and it felt like his entire face had been lit aflame. He’d never seen Tony blush, but he looked just as embarrassed, his throat moving in a swallow. “
Natasha pilots the quinjet, focussed on her task. Rhodey sits up front with her, and Tony can’t imagine what they’re saying right now. He knows Rhodey is probably giving her a debrief, explaining exactly what it is he saw. Tony has no idea what step to take here, so instead he just sits in silence, hoping that Loki makes contact soon, hoping that they get some intel on Steve from him. He can’t imagine that show was for any other purpose. He wonders if he was mad to trust Loki even the small amount that he did.
It’s the first thing Steve says when Tony picks up the phone. Or JARVIS, more accurately. Tony’s doing his best impression of a noodle on the workshop couch, his arm flung over his eyes. He feels like something curled up in his throat and died.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Bruce piped in, words weighted in a way that Steve knew was referring to Tony’s specific biological circumstances. Steve squeezed his eyes shut, cursed quietly. “I think I’ll have to do it. As Bruce, I mean. As a beta, I’ll be the least likely to be…affected.”
“And you’ve met Logan, and Scott, and Rogue,” Xavier counters, a bright smile on his face, and Steve laughs because, yeah. Yeah, he has.
“Thank you,” Tony breathes, sitting down on the toilet lid. He rubs at his forehead with his free hand.
It’s been less than a month. He’d forgotten that, until now. He and Loki had been dancing around each other, flirting, for months, but from the time they’d first slept together to now had been less than a month.
“Moi?” Tony presses a hand to his chest, then offers her a wink. “I’m a genius, Maria. I could never.”
Every day, it was something else. “Hey, Tony, wanna go a few rounds? You need to work on your hand-to-hand.” or “Hey, wanna play a few games of basketball with me?” or “I brought you some food. I know you didn’t eat yet today.” or “It’s so hot. Let’s get some ice cream.” The worst part was the surprise that would break over Tony’s face, followed swiftly by a quiet kind of joy, a wide grin. He always agreed, was the problem, and Steve knew that he was taking advantage. He knew that Tony had been kind of lonely before The Avengers moved in. He had a better understanding of Tony’s complicated relationship with the myth of Captain America now, how he’d been Tony’s hero when he was a kid. He knew it was preying on that, in many ways, that he was using Tony, and still. Still, he couldn’t stop doing it.
Tony spares her a glance. She’s still on the floor, mostly motionless except for the occasional twitch. Tony limps around to get a better look at the machines.
“We need to talk about this if we want to fix it, Tony. I messed up, you lashed out, I should have known-”
“The first one,” Tony said, sounding abashed about it, but Steve only smiled and kissed his chest gently again before taking his nipple in his mouth. “Ah.”
, Steve had said, and the truth of that hurt. It ached all the way to his bones, made his sternum feel like it was bare to the world.
“Would you just stop?” he demands, and Steve’s lip curls. It’s a sure sign that this fight is about to get nasty, and Tony holds up a hand in placation. “Look, this isn’t about you, either. I’ve had a lot going on, in case you forgot. I didn’t have time to babysit your weird relationship with your brainwashed evil brother, okay, just. Just let me
Tony laughs and throws open the door, ready to face the scowling Natasha, the cadre of supervillains, an injured Steve.
“Sheriff,” Tony said, but it was the wrong thing to say. Rogers’ face closed up like a safe door. “Aw, hell, don’t be like that.”
“And knowing what drink to order is more impressive than overtaking a Hydra base,” Steve had deadpanned. But of course, as was often the case with the Starks, Howard had been right.
“Yeah?” Steve says, caught halfway between bashfulness and what is clearly smug, alpha-male posturing. He settles for a smirk paired with a raging hot blush, one that disappears under his neckline.
“The doctor will be with you soon,” Thor put in on the coms, and Steve swallowed. “Are you well, Captain?”
“Who’s Bruce talking to?” Tony asks, sighing. He moves to test the water, unabashedly naked, and ignores Loki’s half-lidded eyes on him. Mostly.
“Tony,” Steve panted, and he could feel it building now, tension ratcheting up from his hips all the way down to his curling toes. It was too good, too much, too soon. “
“There are enhanced whose powers amount to nothing more than an increased lung capacity, or a healing factor,” Secretary Mattis points out, shaking his head. “I agree, some of these men and women are dangerous, but-”
At first, it was insignificant, physical things. He loved the way Tony’s eyes crinkled when he smiled, the way they glittered like gems in the light when he was happy and laughing and Steve managed to get him to leave the workshop. Tony’s precise facial hair made Steve want to mess him up a little, thinking about what he’d look like with Steve’s slick smeared through it, the way it would feel against his skin. His hands were graceful, fluttering as they moved through workshop holo-screens. Tony was a handsome man, and that was no secret. There was no shame in it, and Steve was only human. He’d been attracted to alphas before, and he’d told himself it would pass. Tony was off-limits. Tony was his friend.
Loki: Hey I made a huge dramatic declaration of loyalty so maybe could you talk to your workwife about the government trying to ruin your livelihoods? Or like, any of your friends and adoptive family? Which you still have, unlike some of us? Is that chill? It’s literally the only thing I’ve asked of you this whole time?
“Too soon,” he gasped, and Tony pulled away immediately, whispering apologies and kissing along his collarbone, his throat, his bondmark. “
“You probably can’t touch me,” Steve says sadly. For all that Reed’s absent-minded, he’s clearly done so right by his kids. Steve’s never been close to Reed the way Tony is, but he considers himself pretty good friends with Sue. He thinks after this is over he’s going to owe the Richards a debt that can never be repaid. “But when I’m better, I’d love a hug.”
“I should be there,” Steve snapped, mostly angry at himself. “I’ll bet good money they’re ditching the cars. Maybe heading down in the tunnels. Check to see what the subway’s like over there. Maintenance hatches, something.”
Steve’s teeth are perfect under his tongue. It’s a strange thought to have, one that’s distinctly unsexy, but it’s the thought that bubbles to the surface as he slicks the tip over the ridge of Steve’s incisors, shivering as Steve’s slides underneath his, testing the thin membrane there. He makes a sound, surprise maybe, and Steve tips forward into him, cupping one big hand over Tony’s jaw, pulling him just that barest bit closer.
“I don’t know if I can,” Tony says. He’s overwhelmed. Happiness is a dangerous thing, on Tony. He doesn’t know what to do with it. It spills out of him like light.
Steve startles awake with a shout, his fingers reaching up to touch his own neck. Of course, he can’t really feel his own skin that well. He can’t touch anything like this.
And, fuck, that’s a command. “Uh,” Tony says, mind scrambling. “I don’t-” Nope. “Are you-… I’ve…” Steve shifts, and Tony lets out a low moan, suddenly aware he’s painfully hard between them. “Fuck, it’s…kind of hard to think when you’re blowing my mind with how fucking hot you are, Cap.”
Later, after Tony had someone bring them some fatty, carb-filled takeout, after he’d given Steve yet another set of orgasms, after they’d laid together in the jacuzzi and spoke quietly to each other about the future, Tony finally suggested they leave the heat room.
The light comes first, and then the sound and the concussive wave, exploding outwards with enough force to throw Tony backwards for the second time. The entire field is bathed in smoke, billowing out from where Loki had been standing in thick black and grey clouds. Amora hasn’t stopped screaming, her voice high and awful in the ringing silence, the Hulk roaring onto the scene as The Winter Soldier opens fire. The Hulk brings a hand down towards him, and he tumbles sideways, loosing another round of shots. The other woman blasts The Hulk backwards. There’s blood on Amora’s face, thick and viscous. It isn’t hers, and Tony has a moment to be worried that he’s done the wrong thing before Amora vanishes in a flash of green, the rest of her allies disappearing with her.
“Are you ever not going to fall for that?” Loki asks, lounging over Tony’s shoulders, and Tony rolls his eyes heavenward.
After, Pepper gathers up all her things and folds Tony into her arms like he is something small and precious. She presses a gentle kiss to his forehead.
“Good,” Pepper says, sounding vicious, and Tony bares his teeth at the empty room. “Italian, from that little place you like near Central Park West, and some cannoli’s.”
“Anytime,” the priest says, a smile audible in his voice. “Don’t wait so long for confession next time. Come back and tell me how it goes, hm? I’m rooting for you.”
Hulk shrugs again, and Steve walks over and puts down his duffel bag. He rests his shield on it, as this is pretty clearly not a combat situation, and slumps into one end of the closest couch.
The girl turns to look at him, then tilts her head to the side. Her entire body is covered in a thin layer of brown fur. “Captain America, huh? He says he’s coming, give him a sec.”
“You took Keisha, an omega woman from web development, back to the Malibu house after handling the imminent crisis with the StarkPhone 7. She spent the first day of your heat with you. In July of the following year she bonded to an alpha and transferred to the Chicago office.”
“And then I had a life-ruining crush on you,” Tony said, grinning, and Steve flushed. “I wasn’t about to jeopardise my chances with the hottest omega in the world.”
Tony had dressed in one of his beautiful suits for their night out. Something like sharkskin, with a gentle gleam that made Steve want to brush his fingers over the fabric. Then he remembers that he can, and he slings an arm around Tony’s shoulders. When Tony leans into him, his blood sings.
Steve pulls open the stairwell door and pushes Tony ahead of him, letting the door slam shut behind them even as he’s crowding Tony up against the wall.
“In my defence, that really wasn’t the main goal that day,” Steve begins, used to this fight with Tony, but the professor just chuckles. “Are you saying I have PTSD?”
Tony works until his hands ache. On bad days, he’s sometimes come out of an engineering fog to find blood smudged dark and flaking against his abraded hands, the casual injuries of working piled up without him even noticing the pain. But Tony was used to that, he supposed; pushing past the pain, pushing it down until it was just another part of him. The tightness in his chest never goes away. The pain in his sternum at a cough or a hiccough, the aching bones in the winter from all of the places that he had broken them; these were his own kind of medals, the stars and stripes marking his penance. Certainly, he had a lot to make up for.
“You heard me,” Steve says. He’s gaining confidence, in that way he does sometimes—a freight train picking up speed. Each small success buoys his confidence until he’s unstoppable, smug and avaricious. “I worried a lot before, about your reputation. How many people you’d gone with. I thought maybe I’d be too boring for you.”
“Tony,” Rogers began, then sighed. The uncommon shock of his given name outside of the secret intimacy of their beds startled Tony, and he turned to blink at Rogers’ hangdog expression. “I wish you wouldn’t punish yourself so.”
JARVIS turns the television on and cues up the movie. As the opening flashes of names and companies begins, Steve is blindsided by how glad he is to be home, and then, surprise that the tower truly feels like home now. He hadn’t been taken care of in so long, but he supposes that’s what Tony’s good at. He sneaks up on you, and by the time you notice it he’s too close to easily shut out.
“Look,” he says, and Steve turns his attention back to the screen. “J, skip to where Cap orders me to let him take care of me.”
Tony squeezes his eyes shut. “Right.” He sucks in a breath, scrubbing his face over before he straightens. He shakes his arms out, rolls his head on his neck. “Right. Okay. Any word on Loki or Thor?”
The tension was broken by the beeping of the fridge, and Steve turned to finish putting the butter away.
Steve rubbed a hand over his mouth, taking a deep breath. He stood up, got a glass of water, sat back down at the table again.
“Sir…” JARVIS begins, reticent, “I understand the phrase ‘opposites attract’ from a linguistic and metaphoric standpoint, but in practise I’m not sure you and the captain are compatible. You have several significant ideological differences. And Mr. Laufeyson is certainly not ‘boyfriend material’, so I think perhaps my opinions on this matter leave something to be desired.”
“Yess,” Loki hisses, and slides to the floor, and then he’s pulling Tony out of his pants and his briefs and his mouth is there, hot and wet and slick as sin. He pulls at Tony’s hips, swallowing him all the way down, and Tony knows exactly what it is he wants. He pushes the hair out of Loki’s eyes and shifts his hips up, at first tentative, then a little harder when Loki moans so loud Tony’ can feel the reverberation all the way through his chest, down to his toes, in his fingertips. He cradles Loki’s head in his hands, presses one thumb to the corner of that beautiful sharp jaw and rolls his hips, the other hand resting on the side of Loki’s throat to feel it work, to feel the rolling, tensing, the swallowing both under his fingers and all around him.
He thinks of his conversation with Xavier, of what he knows of how poorly things went between him and Magneto. He doesn’t know if they were ever lovers, although there have always been rumours. But he knows that once they were best friends, as close as anything. Somewhere along the way, things got broken.
There were a few scattered laughs, more confused than truly amused. A spate of whispers broke out anew.
“Mine,” he said, reaching out, and Tony leaned down to meet him, pressing soft, adoring kisses all over Steve’s jaw, his neck, against his panting mouth. “Alpha.”
"You think there’s a max on intelligence, why does that not surprise me,” Tony sneers, and Steve studies him.
"Thor tells me you can't break a vow. Some sort of gods' thing, especially true for mages." Loki stills, and turns back to look at him. Tony rests his elbows on the bar. "We both want to manipulate each other. So let's put a little insurance in, shall we?"
“Best of ten!” Clint yelled, jumping up and getting in Tony’s face. Tony growled at him, but he was clearly joking, and so Clint ignored this entirely. “You cheat!”
“Steve,” Tony groans, and Steve laughs, wicked and low against his skin. He traces his fingers over Tony’s hips, his hands moving over his body like his clothes aren’t even there. He hadn’t tried to touch him like this when Tony was fully clothed. All the other times Tony had undressed himself, had placed his handsome naked body into Steve’s care with all the reticence of a frightened animal. So he’s never noticed that before, that he can’t feel Tony’s clothing when he touches him. Only his skin, warm and smooth and alive.
After almost a decade of careful political relationships, always carefully treading on the right side of social norms, Steve was finally faced with Deborah’s true nature, rearing its ugly head. He had no doubt of Tony’s innocence, but such accusations held enough weight to not be easily dismissed. She knew that, of course, and Steve could see that there was yet more that she had planned.
A nod, and one of the soldiers ran off to find the knight. Steve didn’t speak again, and neither did Deborah, the two of them staring at the other in a manner not unlike that of two caged beasts.
And after all these things had been carried out, the result of his endeavor proved to be exactly as he had wished: Virginia was wedded to Harold, King of California; Natalia was wedded to James, King of the Winterlands; Darcy was wedded to Ian, King of Albia; and to each one of them was assigned a third of their father's kingdom.
You would have found, my dearest readers, that Antonia had not been long up in the tree before the satyrs, who had smelt the scent of the fragrant wine, began to draw near the buckets, and having come close to them, each one rejoiced and drank a good bellyful of wine, greedier than hungry wolves. And after they had filled their stomachs and taken enough, they laid down to sleep, and so sound and deep was their drunken slumber that all the noise in the world would not have roused them.
Thus the noble Antonia, in recompense for her loyalty and her valor, became a queen and lived long with Steve her husband. Forever one by the other’s side.
“Ah,” the AI said, suddenly understanding, “it is the first time Sir has done this since your relationship has started. I apologize for not realizing sooner, as I have been used to it my entire life.”
Steve and Natasha shared a look as they stood up and headed to the elevator, curious to see what JARVIS meant.
“I found her after the deed, and demanded to know what had happened. The poor girl told me, and I made promise to her of bringing her justice. I stand before you on this day to denounce the perpetrator of such deplorable acts.”
The woman had woven such an intricate trap for the king that even spiders with their finest webs would be put to shame.
Steve slumped against the wall of the elevator, feeling as though every muscle in his body was aching.
“That’s– of course, Lady Deborah. I would gladly help you.” Steve stumbled over his words, thrown off balance by the turn of events. There was a heavy feeling in his stomach, the sour taste of incoming danger that had been so often useful in the field of battle: he dismissed it, thinking it was naught but the horror he felt at this newfound discovery.
When they found her parents to still be alive, they greatly rejoiced, and quickly dispatched ambassadors to King Howard and to Maria his wife, and to the three sisters of Antonia, to tell them how she was now the wife of a king.
“Those are bold and careless words to come out of a caged beast’s mouth,” Steve replied, his mouth curved in a bitter arch. “Your kind has for years depredated my kingdom’s villages, bringing destruction upon countless of my people, and yet you demand liberation?”
“I desire nothing else, Your Highness. I would love nothing more than to serve under you, and be granted the privilege of calling you my lord.”
Antonia hesitated, cautious, but the girl didn’t appear to be armed: she was trembling slightly, and looked quite pale in the candlelight.
“I just-” Tony hesitated, biting his lips as he avoided Steve’s gaze. “I’ve seen the recordings, and you look so happy whenever I’m asleep and you carry me to bed. Why?”
Steve didn’t hesitate as he opened the door, leading the way towards the banquet that was awaiting them.
Hearing this, the satyr began laughing once again, a mischievous smile on his face. “Oh, my foolish knight! I laughed for a reason which you ought to understand better than I.”
“Good,” Deborah said, pleased. “Now go, I have no need for you until morning. And stop crying, will you? It is
Therefore, without wasting any more time over the matter, she rose to face her father and answered him truthfully.
Instead, he held his silence, gathered his wits, straightened up to his full height, and nodded at the newcomer.
The mission was supposed to be simple: get in, grab the data, get out. But once inside, Steve had found himself alone and outnumbered, and, for once, Hydra had put up a good fight.
“Yes, my knight. Lady Deborah von Schmidt has just accused you of raping the maiden which stands behind her. Now tell me, Sir Antonio, does she speak the truth?”
Tony was blushing harder than Steve had ever seen him, and frankly it was both adorable and heartbreaking.
Upon entering the city, she couldn’t help but admire its beauty: the superb buildings, the straight and wide avenues, the aqueduct providing the city with running water, the colorful markets, and the flow of people along the road. Rarely in her travels had she stumbled upon such a beautiful city. Moving through the streets, paying little heed to the stares and whispers that followed in her wake, she suddenly found herself in the city square. Raising her eyes, she was met with the sight of the king’s palace, a tall, imposing building, adorned with columns of the finest marble, shining like a jewel over the crowd standing in its shadow.
“You called, my liege?” Antonio asked, after a quick bow to both Steve and the lady, his movements faltering when he caught sight of the girl.
“I wanted to talk to you, Sir Anthony, in hopes of discovering if your fame has merit. And now, looking at your fair face and hearing such warm and passionate words, I can’t help but rejoice in the knowledge that the rumors were true.” Deborah softly placed a hand on his arm, giving it just the barest hint of a squeeze in a poorly disguised attempt to feel the hardness of his muscles.
“Yes, my liege,” Tony said, and hoped not to regret following his heart’s desire as Steve dragged them to his rooms.
But as it often happens, by the workings of divine providence and supreme justice, the one wishing for another’s destruction was cast under the feet of the one she wished to destroy.
When Steve was informed of Sir Antonio’s return, he rudely dismissed the council which was presently being held and rushed to the throne room to meet his knight, paying little heed to protocol or appearance as his thoughts rapidly condensed into a string of “Tony, Tony, Tony” repeating in his mind.
She washed herself methodically, eyes gazing into nothingness, the now cold water offering little help in calming her thoughts.
All subjects brought forward by the most learned masters would be readily apprehended by her in turn. By the time Antonia was twelve years of age, she had already learned to sing, to dance, to play the piano, and to perform every one of those accomplishments which are proper for a princess, and in which her own mother excelled.  But, not content with these graces, Antonia gave herself also to the study of the sciences, her father’s most favored subject, which proved to be a great source of delight for her, so much so that she would often spend over her experiments not merely the day, but the night as well.
“I am but asking you, my love, to spend the night inside my bed, with promise that I shall never try to take more than what you wish to share with me, as being able to hold you in my arms, even if only for a day, would be the sweetest gift of all.”
Steve stared at her, kneeling and begging at his feet, for a long time. There was a painful wound inside his soul, the place where his trust in his beloved Tony used to reside, and which now had been left torn open and empty. He wanted to be angry, to scream, to cry. He wanted to get up and leave Antonia there, begging and desperate on the floor, just to let her feel the same pain he was feeling... but he could not.
Antonia heaved a shaking breath, trying to control her panicked thoughts. She locked the door with unsteady hands and went to undress again.
“My lord, I was well pleased to hear that you trusted me with the captured satyr, and I have tried my best to pry the words out of his mouth; it is to great shame that I must inform you that I have found him to be mute, as he won’t offer answer to my questioning. If you would so desire, Your Highness, I am sure that you would be able to make him speak. I beg your forgiveness for my shortcomings, my lord.”
Not long set out upon her journey, she became aware of the perils that laid in wait along the path of a young maiden travelling alone. The first time a man tried to put his hands upon her while she slept, her knife ended up embedded in his chest. The second time, three men met their death at the end of her sword, but the fourth one managed to escape with part of her gold. When she almost lost her horse, after two thieves tried to ambush her, she knew that continuing her journey as she was presented far too great a risk.
“Yes, milady.” And with a quick bow, the servant girl scurried away, her shoulders still shaking with quiet sobs.
He asked himself if knowing that his beloved Antonio was in truth a woman changed the way his heart longed for her: it didn’t. He asked himself if he could blame her: he couldn’t. Looking into her eyes, and seeing the desperation which burned underneath them, he asked himself if he believed in her love for him: he did.
Shaking herself from such thoughts, Antonia continued her journey towards the wood in which the satyrs dwelled. She had read much on the subject of those creatures in her youth, and she knew what their weakest points would be, if all went according to plan.
Fate truly had a funny way of weaving men’s destiny, she mused. She ran from her kingdom to escape being bound to a man only to willingly give herself to another, and now her honor was at risk of being lost because of a devious lie.
After the sun had finally set, in the privacy of her own quarters Antonia set to the task of removing her clothes. The servants had heated a basin of water at her request, leaving it inside her bedchamber, and she was eager to put it to use before it lost all its warmth, already enjoying the mere idea of scrubbing away all the grime staining her skin and of finding relief from the soreness of her tired muscles. The life of a knight was not one without hard work, she supposed, and she
Steve’s eyes are bright with unshed tears. He’s got a smear of blood branching out from the corner of his mouth up towards his right ear, like he took a hard punch to the mouth and split his lip. Whatever the injury was, it’s already healed, and Tony offers him an unsteady smile as he checks him over. Aside from the expected state of post-battle dishevelment, he looks alright.
“Good,” Tony says, opening his hands. He holds out an earbud, which Steve picks out of his fingers warily. He pushes it into his ear with a furrowed brow. “If I get back in the suit it’s gonna make this worse, isn’t it?”
“I believe anyone can be a hero,” Steve says stubbornly. “I’ve fought alongside men and women without any enhancements, and they’re just as brave as any so-called superhero. I think the idea that superheroes are special is dangerous.”
“I have something for you,” he says, instead. He loves in quiet, hand-hewn ways. “Here, let me show you some new toys.”
Loki’s mouth twists. “The colonel must remain unprotected. She has fought him, after my supposed demise. And she will be suspicious if your newest compatriot is also sporting protection, when she knows he does not work with you regularly. And I certainly cannot protect Thor.” He frowns, looking at his folded arms. “She will be suspicious regardless.”
