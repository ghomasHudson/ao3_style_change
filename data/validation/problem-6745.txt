"You didn't," Mary said back to him. Tony had come over to her apartment, and saw some boxes in the living room. This was new.
“They’re not,” Steve confirmed, drawing a semi-annoyed hum from Tony. “Let’s get them out, and get back upstairs. I’ve gotta talk to Julie, and, unfortunately, we’ve got to talk to Wade about what happened before I got there.”
“They came in this morning,” Tony told him, attempting to take Jamie from him. Steve moved to the side a little and motioned down to the plate that had a several sandwiches on it, and a couple of containers with some side dishes. “Sadly, my poor excuse of a non-activated serum does not give me perfect vision.” Steve tilted his head a little, slowly eyeing him. Tony raised an eyebrow. “I was never a huge fan of frames, and it was easier to just wear contacts for all the SI public events. It was never a good look when glasses got covered in dust and dirt after a weapons display.” He grabbed half of a sandwich and flopped down onto the couch, pushing his glasses up on the top of his head. “I’ve been wearing contacts for almost two decades.”
“Okay,” Wade said with a nod. There was an air of casualness to it, like Steve had just confirmed something for him. Like reminding him that fish needed water to live.
A deep sonic pulse traveled through the air, and Tony gasped as it passed through him. His hands shot to his chest, the red liquid seeping through his shirt, trying to merge with his arc reactor. It was too much, it was power, it was weak and yet strong, and it needed a place, needed a body, needed a
"Just parts of the reception," Tony answered. "It's no secret that Starks know how to throw a party."
Tony pulled on the sleeves of his jacket as he got out of the car. He'd been to this house dozens of times before, there was no reason he should be feeling nervous now. The door was already opening before he could knock, and Julie Wilson had a look of relief on her face. "You look good for a missing man."
“Sorry gummy-bear, I’m not taking sides on this one.” Tony let off little giggles as he came down from his laughing high, holding onto Steve’s arm. “I’m not risking the future of my sex life, my social life, or my actual life, on this game. Not worth it.”
Steve glanced back at his phone. Of course she would have figured out his identity if she saw the pictures. Meg knew what his bike looked like, and she would know who he was since he always wore the same jacket when he was riding.
"Trying to be me is not a good look on you, Rogers." He kissed Steve's nose. "I know that things went well between you and your bestie in the kitchen. You even sent them back down with leftovers." Steve nodded a little. "And we're both fairly confident that our friend was being manipulated by her family, and we're all fairly safe from that threat." Another nod. "So, I'm thinking that it has to be a combination of something that's been on your mind for a little bit, or a while, and it was unintentionally touched upon in kitchen conversation?"
“I suppose I now know why there’s so much sliced meat,” Tony said, offering a plate to Steve when he walked in. “It’s kind of hard for me to mess this up.”
"You missed the ceremony?" Mary asked as Tony worked on his hot rod in the workshop. "Your best friend went to give you an award, and-"
Then the red and white balls caught his attention. Moving the files over to the side her saw a brown leather belt and pulled it up. There was the typical pouch for empty Pokeballs like he had seen others wearing, and there were three Pokeballs attached to the belt itself. Bringing it closer he saw that two of the balls were dark and frowned sadly. Balls were only dark for two reasons; if they were empty, or if they were corrupt and the Pokemon inside were no longer inside. If the balls were as old as he thought, and they hadn’t been opened, then they would have probably just faded away, specially if they were as heartbroken as Tony thought they would be. It was no secret that the man that Captain America was had loved his Pokemon whole-heartedly, and they would have been devastated at his loss.
"You don't have to say it back, not right away," Steve told him, and Tony tried not to wince, guilt pooling in his chest. "It kind of just fell out of my mouth, but I've been thinking about it a lot-"
Steve watched Tony walk in, like he owned the place, glance over at him and Steve frowned. He had to have recognized him, right? Why did Steve care? Tony was self-absorbed, cared about no one other than himself. He had certainly proved that today. Steve really frowned when Tony walked over to Bruce, not even bothering to introduce himself to the man.
"It was lots of fun," Peter grinned at his grandparents as they told the story. Tony smiled to himself as he ate, listening to the boys. Today had been one of the most normal days, which made it a very not normal day for Tony Stark. He had worn his hat and sunglasses, and he was pretty sure that he hadn't had his picture taken at the park, so there was another plus. Tony thought that he would give up all the fame, the traveling, the big fancy mansions and towers, if he could spend every day with his son like today. He'd want to keep some of the money though, so he could support Peter, indulge all his curiosities in learning new subjects and hobbies.
Tony smirked at Meg, hands sliding into his pockets. "Oh, that's what you have to look forward, too."
“This is a rare treat,” Bruce said on Sam’s other side. “He’s able to relax completely, and he’s able to enjoy some of his nerdier features with his son, and Wade.”
"No we don't," he said, tensing his jaw. It wasn't Bruce's fault his father was such a dick, no need to take it out on him. "You and Steve know, and that's all that needs to know. The history changes nothing." He could feel Bruce staring at him, before he finally nodded and walked over to Tony. "Use my blood samples as test subjects," he said more calmly. "We already know that Howard had figured out that my DNA would be stable enough. Next best thing next to the Captain himself."
“Yes dear?” He watched Cap roll his eyes a little, the cowl that was up let him see that clear as day.
Tony's eyes widened a little and he looked back at Peter who was reaching out to grab one of his toys on the floor again. "His first steps?? And they were to me?" Tony blinked, thinking about what had just happened.
"You should go through it after you take Peter to go see Rachel," Steve suggested. Tony looked over at him. "Start off the day with something good," he shrugged a little.
“Because I don’t want to have to write up a report saying that we lost Iron Man inside of a grocery store.”
"You're bringing Banner in on this?" He looked back through the files again, dropping the image of the tesseract.
Steve leaned next to Tony, head tilted up to watch the sky. "This is one of the best views I've ever had," Steve said to the man. Tony glanced at him, then back up in the sky. "You did a good job, Tony."
"I would have taken Peter," Tony grumped a little, knowing that he had probably missed his chance, and that Peter was already over at the new neighbor's place; Steve. He hadn't met Steve, but he heard about him all the time from Peter. Something about that just didn't sit right with Tony. He of course knew what it was, but he would rather take a repulsor to the gut before he named the feeling for what it was; Jealousy.
"You tried to stab an assassin," Tony said, dabbing lightly at his nose, trying not to put too much pressure on it; it already hurt, he didn't care if it bled a little.
"You're not answering his texts," she deadpanned. "You're holding a grudge. Stop that, you two deserve each other. Your stubborn matches his stubborn."
"I found a tickle spot," Steve said, pressing his lips to the side of her neck and blowing a raspberry. She squealed and kicked her legs, and now Steve was laughing with her. "Look at that face!" He leaned in to do it again, but her hands were pushing at his face, still giggling though. Tony was holding his phone up, recording now. "You don't want that?" He blew a little raspberry on her hand and she was pulling them back with renewed laughter.
The bathroom door opened enough for Meg to stick her head out the door, peering at Steve. "Cherries?"
It didn't take long for Tony to lose himself, his brain only able to focus on touch, feel, and sound. The way he and Steve was constantly touching, in contact, moving against each other, he wasn't sure when one began and the other ended. The sounds coming from both of them were just obscene; moans and whimpers, pleas and names, Tony felt it all, every sound and every word, almost as much as he felt their bodies against each other, almost as much as he felt Steve moving inside of him.
"It's a stabilizing agent." Tony glanced at the group and noticed that Captain America wasn't- Oh, holy hell. Tony really hoped he didn't just visibly flinch. Steve. The fucking Neighbor. Was sitting there, in Captain America armor. Tony was already three hundred percent done.
"Then consider this one of the important lessons of being a parent," Mary replied instantly. She wasn't going to coddle his emotions right now. "If you're having a bad day, if you don't fell like doing, life, you don't get to take a day off." Tony wasn't aware until he was already doing it, but he was sitting down as Mary gave him what for. "You don't get to go to your child, and say "I'm sorry, but today I just can't handle being an adult right, please understand that I'm going to put something else ahead of you."
He whistled a bit as William walked over to Tony. "Looks like quite the haul," Tony said with a nod to the trunk.
"He's going to be living upstairs now?" Peter asked and Tony nodded. "In one of the other bedrooms?"
Meg gasped and whipped around to look at him. “Are you bad-mouthing Supernatural?” Tony turned wide eyes on Bucky. Steve kept an arm wrapped around his waist, smirking a bit at Bucky from behind Tony. “Do you understand the severity of the episode you just badmouthed??”
He walked over and pulled up a chair next to Steve, sitting down as he watched Jamie trying to take the spoon from Steve. "I think she's going to cut a couple more teeth soon," Steve told him, managing to get her to eat some of the baby food. And then not release the spoon from her mouth.
Tony saw the gas leaking from the car that his body, and head, had just become intimately familiar with, and saw the man moving closer int he broken mirror. He had a shot. Those whips were conducting electricity, and they were making sparks as they dragged across the ground. Tony saw the chest piece, something that looked frighteningly familiar, and he was already working out how the set-up worked. He had to time this just right.
“You’re optimistic.” Bucky grunted, unwrapping the mint to pop it in his mouth. His eyebrows went up at the taste, and Meg smirked.
"Ouch Kate," Tony put a hand to his chest. "Jumping from the gate on this one, aren't we? What happened to lobbing me a couple of easy ones?"
"Our son shall be a nerd, and it shall be glorious." Tony put his mug on the table and held out his arms. "Petey, come to your fabulous Daddy." Peter smiled and ran over, jumping up into Tony's lap. Tony smiled, arm wrapped around Peter's waist. "By the way, we have assigned seating," he said looking at Clint.
“I’m afraid that he’s in some sort of denial,” Steve said gravely. “There’s nothing more I can do. But, I still accept him as he is.”
“Currently teaching Jamie the importance of blueberry pancakes,” Steve threw in. “Wade is helping, by eating the demonstration ones.”
"Alright, I'll make you a deal, Petey-boy," Tony said, and all three occupants on the bed looked at him. "I'll let you and Wade stay here to catch up with Agent, and I'll put away your stuff, but you both have to help put dishes in the dishwater for dinner, okay?"
"I sent her to take a nap," Mary smiled at him. "I think she's earned it. But, maybe I'm re-thinking that now. She would have loved to have seen this."
"A lot of things are always on my mind." He peeked his eyes open to see the very unamused look Tony was giving him.
Peter looked at Mary, his little jaw wobbling with tears, and fear. He didn't want to leave her, he didn't want anything else to happen, but when he looked back up into the sky, he knew that his Daddy would need help.
Obie put his arm around Tony's shoulders, leaning in so only they could hear. "Tony, who do you think locked you out? I was the one who filed the injunction again you." Tony thought that his face had gone pale, the blood rushing from his face at the words. "It was the only way I could protect you."
"Guess I'd better make it fun for you then," Steve called back, shooting him a little smile as he stepped into the elevator. Tony licked his lips when the doors closed, then looked down at the floor. Steve had kissed just outside of the gym, leaving Tony toeing the separation of the floors.
"You know I'm not replacing Peter, right?" Tony asked Wade, a little more seriously. Wade looked at him then nodded, before running back over to Peter, who was busy going along with Coulson behind him to each chair, probably assigning seating again.
"We've spent about two years together, Tony," Mary countered. "I think that's plenty of time to get to know you." Tony snorted a little. "Did something happen?"
"I'm upset that I didn't have a direct hand in it!" Tony turned them to head back towards the front of the mansion. He wanted to get down to his workshop now, to see if Jarvis had finished production on those punching bags. "You are so not like what my Dad described-" Tony stopped abruptly. That was a train of thought that he did not need to go down, especially with the man walking next to him.
“I’ll help you out, just this once.” He was sure that Steve was attempting to give him a deadpan expression, but Jamie was too busy playing with his face. “Rachel raised a little girl, and Meg is raising a little girl almost the same age as Jamie. I’m confident in your abilities.” Steve gave him an annoyed hum, then moved his head to push his lips against Jamie’s hands.
Tony reached over, poking his cheek as they drove away from the damage, eyes still on the road. "You sense of duty is speaking," he said, "and it's loud." Tony glanced over at him real quick. "I know you want to help, but we just gotta lay low right now. We saved the world, I think that we're allowed to take a little break."
“You know where we’ll be,” Steve offered, like it was automatic. He’d always be there for his friends and family, always offer the help.
"All night is a relative thought," Tony said as he stretched his arms above his head. His hips felt a little funky, having fallen asleep with his jeans still on, and sleeping properly. "I mean, I came in a little after one in the morning, and it's almost six now. That's not even the recommended amount of sleep a normal adult should get-"
"Bruce is working in his lab, and he's in that super intensive mode." Tony sat up on the couch, before deciding to start moving towards his room, Jarvis making sure the call followed him. "And I'm not sure if the wonder twins managed to make it here before the snow storm hit."
"I'm not going to say anything to that." Mary shook her head and Tony grabbed the bottle. She stood up as Tony walked over, and in one motion she took the bottle in one hand and slid her shoulder into Tony's. His arm came up in reflex and she slid Peter into it, staying close to make sure he didn't drop the infant.
“Don’t I get points for handling this with grace?” Steve asked. “I mean, I’m the one that has to deal with the paparazzi trying to hound me and figure out who I am, and probably trying to get pictures of Jamie.”
Strange and Wanda had moved to settle on either side of Tony, red light starting to dance around her fingers. “Loki, I could use you over here,” Strange spoke up, attempting to ignore what was happened between the men. “Ms Maximoff is going to go back into his mind, find what we now know to be the weak link between Stark and the being. I will need you, Loki, to confirm that is what we’re dealing with, and I shall isolate it.” Loki stepped closer, nodding.
"You will until we can track him down," Steve shot right back at her. "It's not just you that's in danger! And he knows it, or else he wouldn't have stopped that cart. If you weren't pregnant, you probably could have gotten away with a couple of bruises. He knew I was coming up here, and if you would have been hurt then I probably would have canceled and told you to get some rest." She wrinkled her nose, but did deny his words. "We don't know if he was trying to get Tony alone at the Tower again, or if he would have attacked me to draw Tony out. He's unpredictable and that makes him even more dangerous."
"A higher form?" Steve frowned. What had SHIELD been doing right under his nose? Was Mary or Coulson involved in this as well?
"You're restless," Steve murmured, turning his head to look at Tony, looking sleepy, but just the right amount of awake.
Tony could feel the grin on his face, threatening to split as he spun, moving up and down, going higher to his own whim. He was flying! "Handles like a dream!" He grinned. He led the suit over the water, and saw the lights of a carnival nearby. "Jarvis, did Mary say what carnival her parents were taking Peter to, tonight?" He asked suddenly.
The girl, Wanda Maximoff, had stumbled on the part of him that had been affected by Loki's scepter, and apparently it was like an exposed nerve. She hadn't seen what he had, dealing with the Other, but she had seen a weakness to exploit, and now instead of blue eyes, he had red eyes as he was forced to work on Hydra's Serum.
Tony chew on his bottom lip a little with his canines. "Uh, wanna talk about it?" Steve looked at him a little surprised.
"Restrain him," the first spoke, coming closer to Tony. "We'll take him to Strucker for now. Pierce should have the Captain and Widow." Tony took a deep breath and tried to pull away from the two men holding him. He let out a shout, his whole body tensing as another shock went through his body, then he went limp. Tony could hear, but he couldn't follow the faces of the men who were talking.
"We'll tackle it," Steve told him, smiling that smile that made Tony feel a little fuzzy inside. "Like couples do."
“Re-run, actually,” she said, wiping a fake tear from her eyes. Both she and Tony dropped their heads in a moment of silence. “RIP Bobby.” Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair.
“Glaceon is Topaz, Leafeon is Emerald. Espeon will be Amethyst, Umbreon will be Jet, and Slyveon is Morganite.” Vee churred happily, gracefully leaping down to the table now.
Steve rubbed Wade's arm as he slept, the movie still going, but his mind was on Tony. He wasn't sure what had come over him, why he had stepped to Tony like he did, but he didn't regret it. When he touched Tony, and saw him practically cry at the touch, he felt something tight in his chest. Tony hadn't been the first man that he had kissed, there had been an Allied soldier in France on one of their missions, but he hadn't kissed like Tony had.
"The whole damn city," Tony commented, hand resting on Peter's back, who was napping lightly on Tony's chest. "I figure everyone deserves a little excitement today, so I set up all the fireworks displays for New York City."
“Not in the least bit possible,” Tony said and crossed his arms over his chest. “Specially when it comes to a beloved form of entertainment.” Mary let out a little sigh, and added one more pancake to the stack.
"Captain Rogers and Young Lady Jamie are enjoying a snack up in the Penthouse, Sir. I would recommend that perhaps Mr Fitzgerald take Young Master Peter while you step outside."
"No, I said I don't swim, not that I don't know how." Tony corrected him. He looked passed Steve for a second. "Alright, you two can get in now," he called, the two boys jumped into the water. Jarvis had put up a floating barrier that let the boys know where not to go, where it would be far too deep for them. "The changing room is right over that way." Tony motioned with both of his arms like Vanna White showing off a prize, giving a wide, cheesy, grin to go with it. "I have to watch the boys until you get back."
Tony looked at Steve, letting out a breath through his nose. They seemed to share the same thought; It could have gone worse.
Instead, Tony went down to Bruce's lab, to check if any of the other information on the thumb drive had helped in his experiments.
"You are an evil man, you know that, right?" Meg told him, sounding amused. "You'd better not take too long on that mission, because this conversation is not over."
She looked over at Steve, then down at his own socked feet that she could see from his crossed-leg position. She pointed with one hand, making a noise. "My feet?" He asked and unfolded his legs, extending them so his legs were on either side of her. He twisted his ankles a bit so his feet curled around her, rubbing little circles on her back. Steve smiled when she giggled softly.
"Hi Mom," Wade grinned over at his mom. "Did you see how I stood up there, and stayed quiet, and didn't even fidget that much!"
Peter wiggled a little in Tony's lap, burrowing a bit between Tony's arm and his side as his hand sought out the arc reactor. Tony was able to stop a shiver anytime that Peter touched it. Peter was the only one who could get away with touching it whenever they wanted. Tony waited patiently, noting that it usually didn't take his son this long to come out with what was on his mind.
Perhaps the past few months, all the avoiding that Steve had done to Tony, was trying to tell him something. Maybe it was like when little kids had a crush, and they would pull hair, and kick toys, instead of being nice. Maybe Tony was his schoolyard crush, and his mind, and body, was trying to tell him now that maybe it was something else.
"I'm afraid that I can't comply with that, Sir." Tony turned a glare towards the ceiling, the direction where he knew the cameras were. "I am to protect Young Master Peter, and the death of a parent would violate that."
“And you get to talk around all day like that,” Tony told him, standing up and watching Peter jump to his feet from the bed. “Alright, I gotta get dressed, and I have to try and get Mr Steve to get dressed. Go grab some breakfast, but be careful.” Peter ran out the room and Tony went back to the bedroom he shared with Steve.
Pepper waited until they were out of eyesight, then look over at Tony with a raised eyebrow. “Is there something I should know?”
“That’s because Vee and I are geniuses!” Tony proclaimed proudly. He leaned in when they heard the first crack of an egg. “Look,” he said in a hushed voice, pointing at the yellow egg. “It looks like Jolteon is going to show up first.”
Tony stood by the newly installed glass (glad that he could finally take down the plastic after having to wait over the weekend), a glass in his hand, staring outside as the night lights of the city started to go out, the sun giving enough light to wake up the city in full force. He tensed for a second when he heard a footstep behind him, but relaxed again when Mary came up next to him.
"Tony, to Tony," the engineer quickly corrected. He could practically hear Mary rolling her eyes. After nearly two years, she was still trying to get him to accept the 'Dad' word. There was a little shuffle as the phone was probably being pressed to Peter's ear. "Hey, Petey."
Stane gave one finally pull, and Tony thought his heart had just stopped. It might as well have as Obidiah disconnected the arc reactor from his body. His body filled with ice, movement slowly starting to come back, but not enough to stop Stane. He watched the man he had once looked up to, look at his arc reactor, like it was his own invention.
“You said you felt the Universe move once,” Steve started to say, lips moving against his skin. Tony hummed as he nodded. “Do you know-“
And it did start to make some sense. Did Tony think that he was trying to take Peter from him? Peter talked about Tony all the time, though, he adored his father. Steve didn't have much time with his father, and his mother for that matter, but these were different times.
“Oh, I know all about that, too,” Mary said with a nod. Then she hit Tony’s leg as hard as she could at the time. “We were supposed to talk about what would happen when you announced Peter to the Press.” Tony opened his mouth to protest, then blinked with wide eyes when her hand reached up to tug him down, giving him a peck on the lips. “But, I’m proud of you at the same time. Mom and Dad played the press conference for me. Peter was beaming as he watched it again.” Tony could feel his cheeks warming. “You are a proud father, Tony, and it isn’t hard to see. Such a change from the man that first held his son, eyes wide, freaking out.”
"Not angry, no." Tony felt the 'but' brush up against him, become a good friend. "Just trying to tell myself that there must be a reason for you to keep it all locked up so tight."
Tony woke with a gasp, head whipping back, and his eyes shot open. He groaned in pain when he tried to move, and found that he couldn't actually move that much. There was a slight buzzing in the back of his head, but he swallowed and willed himself to look around. A cell, because of course it was. Tony felt like his life really couldn't get more cliche. In fact it looked almost medieval, complete with old bricks and stones for the floor and walls. Except for the very high tech glass wall that served as the entrance.
"Wow," Mary smirked at him. "That almost sounds like jealousy." Tony scowled at her. "I said almost. Maybe you need to find your own guy." Tony sputtered a little and Mary's smirk turned shark-like. "Oh, please, I've slept with you, and I raise a child with you. I know you aren't shy about your sexuality."
"I don't know," Tony answered honestly. He had no idea who that man even was. He was no one that any of them had run into, at least yet. Maybe it was time to take a look in SHIELD's files. Peter scrunched up his nose and buried his face into Tony's shoulder. Tony couldn't help but feel guilty, being unable to stop Peter from being a part of the danger that he was constantly getting in to.
"She was being attacked, and perceived a threat to her kids," Steve gave them a hard look. "She's not wrong though, you didn't read all of the report."
"Hi Mama! Hi Granma!" Peter greeted happily, running over. Rachel turned to hug Peter, smiling, moving out of the way a little and Mary got up. "Whoa. You look really pretty, Mama."
"I don't run the company anymore," Tony corrected. "That's all Pepper now, being CEO." Steve just crossed his arms over his chest, looking at Tony. He wasn't going to be pushed off topic this time. The two men stared at each other for a few moments before Tony's shoulders slumped a little, giving in. "It's a long story, but I don't like the action of people handing things to me, of hands and arms coming towards me. It drove Pepper nuts for years, until finally just the repetition of her trying and doing it broke through. Pepper and Peter are the only ones who can hand stuff to me."
"Hi, Pepper." He always felt a little weird about calling her Pepper, because he hadn't had nearly as much interaction with her, but she had insisted. "Tony's with Peter."
"I wanna show him!" Peter exclaimed happily. Tony rolled his eyes fondly, and turned to press his hand to the scanner, and put in the code to the door. The door unlocked and Tony pushed it open, letting Peter pull Steve inside first. The room was fairly plain, a few chairs and one couch in there, acting as a private room. There was door that led to a small bathroom, but other than that just wood paneled walls. Steve did notice that there was something small, wrapped in birthday wrapping paper, sitting on the chair though, and he saw his name on it. He walked over and grabbed it, turning it in his hands.
“-but, we seriously don’t have to go all out,” Tony continued, ignoring Steve’s words. “I would be fine with staying home with you. Specially after we just had that long weekend in Malibu. You’re going to spoil me, even though I will never stop you from doing that.”
Steve's belt was next, and Tony was even started to push his pants down with his feet in the need to get rid of their clothes. He was glad that Steve shared the sentiment when mere moments later all clothes were left carelessly on the floor, and Tony's hands were exploring the carefully maintained body of a super soldier.
"-Tony Stark's third annual benefit for the Firefighters Family Fund has become the place to be for LA's high society." Tony raised an eyebrow.
"Thinking that you didn't get there in time?" Rachel asked with a little smirk. "Missed your chance Stark?"
"'Sa mean leff hook," Tony slurred slightly, eyes opening at half mast. Steve left out a breath seeing them brown again. He was sure that the light feeling in his chest was just because he had gotten Peter's father back, yeah, that's what that was. Tony gripped Steve's wrist with his right hand, making Steve blink, before he realized that Tony was trying to sit up. He pulled him upright, watching him carefully.
"I wanna tell Granma and Granpa we're back!" Peter said, but he stopped in his tracks, Wade right behind him.
"I think I've heard some disgruntled stories about him." Julie had a small smile on her face. "Wade's told me about how he's foiled their plans to get into trouble about the Tower."
“Old fashioned diner, all casual, no cameras,” Tony said, one hand on the wheel, the other looping around Steve’s arm and shoulders as well. “Just us, and some good food.” Steve leaned over and kissed Tony’s cheek. Tony preened a little as he managed to catch a stretch of road that put some air through their hair. “Watch out, you might feed my ego.” Tony leaned over at a stop light, kissing Steve properly this time. “Happy Birthday, babe.”
“Anthony!” A voice shouted. Tony painfully moved his eyes to see someone running towards him. The red cap was unmistakable. “Anthony, what-“ Thor stopped when he saw what was surrounding him. “Do not move.”
Tony pulled himself out of the chest of the Mark IV suit, took the welding goggles off and wiped his brow. "Run the tests, J," Tony said as he dropped the welder in its case, and stood up and stretched his arms. A couples of pops from his shoulders and back told him that he should probably actually be in bed. He rolled his neck a few times as he heard the machinery take up the suit to reconnect it with the rest.
Slowly pushing himself up, he dragged himself towards the back towards the bathroom. A shower would be good, and it would wake him up a bit more. He already had enough in production anyway; Marks X, XI, XII, and lucky number XIII, were in fabrication. It was time to take a break. A familiar ping from his phone had him reaching into his pocket as he walked into the bathroom. Tony really needed to trim his beard.
Tony hurried down to the door that would lead to his workshop, Jarvis letting the door swing open for him. The workshop was safe, it was familiar. As he stepped inside, his robots rolled over to him, being careful when they saw that he was holding Peter still. He motioned to the couch that sat in the back, and the robots rolled over, pulling the blankets off with claws, trying to rearrange pillows for him. This was safe, this was familiar.
“You know it’s way past your bedtime little squirt.” He told her, his fingers coming up to tap along her back. She made a little squeak, then whined and tried to push his hand away. “Oh no, Stevie trusted me with you, and you need to sleep.”
“It’s not like we leave them unprotected,” Steve said to him. “We’ve always got an eye on them in some way. I’m not saying that it’s a bad idea, but-“
"We moved date nights up there," Steve explained. "Most of the time we get interrupted for one reason or another, and we'll just sit and watch Supernatural." Sam's eyebrow was up again. "Tony says that it's depressingly domestic, but he's hooked on the show, I can tell." He shrugged a little. "We watch it up there, because we have more warning if Peter's gonna be coming out to the media room."
The firework were about to start, and he was not going to spend the rest of his birthday thinking about Howard Stark's son. He had to find a place to hang the drawing that Peter had made for him, and he would break into the movie kit that Mary had put together for him. She had given him a plastic bowl that was supposed to be for popcorn, showed him microwave popcorn, ("No it is not cheating, Steven Rogers, it's just faster than the old fashioned way on the stove, get used to it."), and then had given him several movies that were on his list to watch. When Peter wasn't looking she had put a pack of beer in his fridge, some different local homebrews she told him, and a bottle of wine. She regularly kept his freezer stocked with ice cream, and warned him that a couple of movies might have him getting in touch with his inner woman, and he could probably demolish a pint of ice cream easily. Steve just raised a skeptical eyebrow at her.
You're all beautiful people, amazing, and I adore you all. Seriously your comments and reviews are amazing, and I have every intention of still responding to everyone. Your support keeps me going.
"You were right," Steve whispered to him. "It was Wilson." Tony looked at him then nodded. Steve opened the door to Julie's apartment, and they walked inside. "Wade is in his room, trying to get some sleep."
"No they're not!" Steve had too many things to deal with that actually concerned Hydra, but he didn't think that he'd be getting this violent opposition from his teammates. "There's a lot that we're looking into about this particular situation right now, but this is not the threat that we need to deal with. Right now, they aren't a threat!" Steve didn't doubt a word that he was saying. "We need to look for Strucker and Loki's scepter, and be on the lookout for Enhanced. Those are the main objectives, that's what I need you two focused on. Are we clear?"
Tony seemed to collapse back onto the bed, shock overpowering his body now. He vaguely heard Bruce excusing himself, and Steve was on the bed next to him, holding his hand in one of his, the other running through Tony's hair.
"That's in Queens," Tony shot back. "That's in New York, which is actually on the complete other side of the country." Tony frowned when he saw some of Peter's stuff already packed as well.
He examined the outfit that Mary had given to him, then looked at the little girl propped up in a sitting position with a pillow behind her. "It's got a lot of ruffles on it," he said, holding up the little blue dress. "Baby clothes didn't have nearly as much going on where I'm from." He sat down on the bed in front of her, and put the dress down in front of her.
“Do you have any kind of news?” Steve asked. He wanted to reach out to hold onto Tony, but wasn’t sure if it was safe. He was still suspended in the air.
"-I know that he would love the space as well. I was also thinking that we're going to have to convert some rooms up in the Penthouse. I'll make the Penthouse two stories, complete with a spiral staircase, because we'll need more bedrooms, and at least another bathroom."
"You can keep him safe," the voice whispered next to Tony's ear, causing the man to close his eyes and shiver. "Do you want to keep him safe?"
"It's just extortion, thank you very much," George said, like he was actually offended. "I don't do blackmail."
“I’m not allowed in the kitchen at all,” Steve told him, leaning back against one of the pillows on the loveseat.
"I think that I'm going to have to be blunt," Mary started and Tony bit back a groan. "Tony, are you okay with the fact that I got married?" Tony blinked a couple of times at her, almost too shocked to answer at first.
"I don't know," Tony said, not turning his head to look at the man, wanting to appear indifferent. "Put a fire under Cap's ass, and you reap what you sow."
"I'm not overly found of what follows," Loki responded, and both Tony and Steve raised their eyebrows a little. A loud thump, and the quinjet actually lurched. Tony grabbed his helmet and Steve went for his shield. Tony reached up to open the bay doors and Steve frowned, until a man landed on the edge.
"The most reliable one, Grandparents." The older man smiled as he leaned in to pick up Peter, the boy's head flopping onto William's shoulder as he held him. "Has he gained like thirty pounds since yesterday??"
“But since he doesn’t know our magical signatures, he won’t be able to follow that.” Stephen shot Tony a look, but had continued like he hadn’t been interrupted. His cloak flapped a little in annoyance. “I had no other choice but to bring her to help, after I was able to figure out just what we were up against. She had been inside of your mind, so she would know any shortcuts we could use.”
“Nope, putting a shirt on.” He started to shake his head, but Jamie put a hand on his face, making him stop. She didn’t appreciate that her warm vehicle was moving and disrupting her comfort.
The HUD was still flickering, but he was able to get an analysis. This man had built an arc reactor. Tony crushed it in his hand, looking over towards Mary. He was about to enter a shit storm, again.
"Look at you thinking all logically." Tony and Steve watched the show on the TV, the lights dimmed, but not off all the way. "I will admit, that the older brother has a nice choice in cars, and good taste in music."
"You also have two missed calls from Miss Parker," Jarvis told him after Tony had started a blood sample into the system. "She informed that nothing was wrong Young Master," his AI quickly continued before Tony could panic. "She had been called into work unexpectedly."
"Yeah," Peter said with a smile. That was one thing Tony never had to worry about coming between him and his son, and that had been such a load off his mind. "Even my art lessons got more fun!" Tony smiled, running his hand through Peter's hair a bit.
"Have a good nap?" Tony asked, leaning back against the pillows, letting Peter rest on his chest, still looking kind of sleepy.
“I attempted to help Anthony with a problem, and I ran into a few complications,” Strange kept talking, not noticing what was happening just behind him. “On a promise to Rogers, I gathered my resources to bring him back, and I needed the help of others, including Loki.”
"You know," the two men jumped at the new voice in the hallway, but they didn't let go of each other completely. Sam Wilson was leaning against the wall, his arms crossed over his chest. "That's the song you have to pick for the first dance at your wedding." Steve chuckled, kissing the top of Tony's head, before dropping his cheek on his hair.
Peter nodded and moved so Tony could pick him up with one arm, biting back the groan as he muscles and joints protested. He needed to rest himself, his body was trying to tell him that, but that could wait for a couple more hours.
Steve's own phone buzzed and he pulled it up seeing a text message from Natasha. Fury was apparently on the war path, thanks to the World Security Council, and she and Clint were looking to get out. Steve wiggled his nose a little, kind of wanting the rest of the team to come here, but this was Tony's house, and he didn't know if he would like, or want, that. He wanted to check in with Thor as well, they needed to make some decisions about what was going to happen with Loki, and the tesseract.
"No, not at all," Steve said with a shake of his head. He grabbed his own plate from the tray. "He was more worried about you, but he agreed to go out with William and Rachel, so he still had fun. I think Wade had a lot to do with that, too."
"You're a genius, too, welcome to the club." Tony leaned his elbows on the computer desk. "Please, Bruce?" He asked quietly. "I got,...." He paused, taking a slow breath. "I got people I don't want to leave behind, and I've been working on this for six months."
There was still no word from Fury about seeing Coulson, so Tony decided to access the little bug still hidden in SHIELD's system. If Fury wouldn't tell him where the man was, then Tony would find out. He owed the man much.
Sitting right at the security station. Tony frowned a bit as he walked out, and over to the man. "I thought you were going to be sleeping in today," Tony said as he walked over. The man looked a bit tired, but seemed to have a second wind going.
"Daddy!" Peter spotted Tony and grinned, hopping down to the ground and running towards Tony. Tony reached down and grabbed Peter, swinging him around once, then hugging him tightly. "Hi, Daddy," he giggled, hugging him back. "You missed breakfast."
And then suddenly, Tony saw everything. He saw every color, every movement, he saw stars, and planets, and something pulsed against his being. It was only for a second, but it felt like an eternity.
Steve had been looking at his lack of clean clothes after showering off from the pool. "Yeah, sure," he nodded. "When were you thinking of heading out?"
“No, sorry,” Tony shook his head, answering honestly. “Someone’s pelting the Tower with, well, I don’t know what, but it’s annoying.” That caught the attention of the others as well. “Jarvis is tracking it- Whoa!” He jerked back when something larger was sudden in the video feed, bringing his attention back to the HUD. “Jarvis, what the hell was that?”
“Peter might need glasses in a year or so,” he told him, finishing the food then leaning over and stealing Jamie from him, successfully this time. He set her down in his lap, holding onto her hands. “I know that kids can get weird about needing glasses, so I’m trying to head off the possibility of a big negative reaction.”
Tony had went into Mary's room after putting the boys to bed, drawing a blanket up and over Steve. He had sat there in silence for hours, watching Mary sleep, thinking about what needed to be done, (he would be checking in with SHIELD today about Phil again), and of course, Steve. "What do I do, Mary?" He asked quietly. "He's Steve Rogers, saintly Captain America, and I'm the definition of debauchery. It's not cool to develop a crush on your childhood hero, and then to act on it, especially when said hero is also your own child's hero. This is all sorts of messed up."
Tony watched Steve feeding Jamie in the kitchen, pushing his phone back into his pocket. He had talked to Happy, now in charge of SI's Security, and still over in California, and was setting up a security detail for Julie and Wade. He called Todd personally and told him what was going on. He had promised the man a long vacation, and he felt bad for calling him, telling him that he needed him. Tony told him to still take a long weekend off, that no one was going to be leaving the Tower unless they were an Avenger, and he'd make it up to him.
"Your place or not, can't let kids get ignored. Specially not so young." Steve hummed almost inaudibly. "Security's doing another sweep, powering off for five."
“Are you getting jealous?” Steve asked, tone quirking up in amusement. Tony looked at him for a few seconds, then let go Steve’s shirt. “Come on,” Steve said, trying not to let out a laugh at Tony’s expression.
"You- bu- wha?" Tony felt like his brain had shut down. "I just talked for like, five minutes, probably without taking a breath."
"That's a bit of an understatement, ma'am," he said, manners still intact as a gentleman and an Officer. "Is New York still part of the United States?"
"I have let someone know, though," Tony admitted and Mary raised an eyebrow. "He's my best friend, Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, or Rhodey. He, uh, he didn't stop until he found me over there," Tony finished quietly. "I know that he can keep a secret. But, he could also help us when I can't show up in person." Mary wondered how long Tony had been thinking about this. "I want to be more involved in life, I want to be there, to do things with him, and for him. I want to have a room in my home just for him to sleep in, a room that's just his."
Tony rubbed his eyes, and set the soldering gun back in its holder. The workshop was still in black out mode, and the last time Jarvis had informed him of the time he had already spent thirty-six hours down there. Tony wasn't actually sure how long ago that was.
"We're currently going through the expanded universe," Tony told him. "So," he turned his attention back to Peter and Wade, "we've decided that he's New Hope Luke, but with Return's lightsaber." Both boys nodded. "Alright, fair game."
“He says as the family walks through the theme park dressed professionally,” Steve quipped, sounding extremely put out. He snorted out a laugh when Tony landed a smack on his arm with the back of his hand. “I’ll admit, it’s a lot more fun than I thought it would be.”
"No way," Bruce shook his head. "You have been doing all the heavy lifting, literally, you made that Tower. You've done nothing but go on about it, and you have a concept for the energy, and it Works, Tony."
"We need your help," Coulson said, holding out a SHIELD tablet to him. Tony looked at him, then took it.
"No way, you're in danger, too, Tony. You need to get Meg somewhere safe, maybe the Tower," Steve argued.
"Oooo, someone was using logic, I see," Tony said, pointing at Wade. "Next time, knock though. How's he looking in there, though?"
That bad feeling in Tony's guts rumbled around a little more. "Well, we've been able to figure out the formula that they've been using for the knock-off Serum." Tony held up his hand before Steve could get too excited. "It's the one that Bruce developed with Howard. They have some of Howard's journals."
Stane put something heavy over the top of his reactor. "But, you see," Tony felt the device start to heat up, gears working on something, "it was just fate that you survived that." Tony gasped at the slight pop, the feeling of the arc reactor being shifted until something had grabbed onto the edges. No, not the arc reactor. He couldn't save Peter if Stane took that from him. Stane twisted the device gently, and slowly pulled out the arc reactor from his chest. "You had one last golden egg to give."
Tony spotted the boy and he got down to one knee, looking right at Wade. He stopped less than a foot away from the older man, and Steve had a feeling that he had just found out that he had been played by Tony Stark.
Tony's mansion had been far enough away to escape the attack from the aliens, but took nearly an hour to get too with the cleanup effort going on. Tony wanted to keep Peter from seeing as much of the destruction as he could, away from prying eyes; he had already been through so much in his few years already.
“Uh oh,” Meg’s voice sounded as she walked into the living room, putting her own babies in Bucky’s lap. “Here, you can get your baby fix twice as fast now.” She glanced back at Steve. “What did you do?”
"I'll admit, that I really don't have the first idea of what to do, but while you were down with Bruce- Uncle Bruce?- I was asking for Jarvis to send me stuff to my phone." Even though Steve knew that she couldn't understand a word of what he was saying, it felt better saying it. He and Tony hadn't exactly had a lot of time to do all the talking that needed be done the night before, and he'd talk to him later, but Steve felt the need to get some of it off his chest. And a lot of what he was thinking was for Jamie.
“That would be the room,” he muttered under his breath as they got closer. He glanced inside the other bedroom and saw that it had two full size beds inside, along with a dresser that no doubt held the TV, and a closet. “That’ll probably be Peter’s room, if Daddy can get him to give up the master bedroom.” Jamie let out a little urgent grunt, wanting to see the action in the room just in front of her, and Steve couldn’t help but obey, walking in the doorway for her to see Tony and Peter on the bed, pillows armed in hands, just as Steve predicted. Steve let out a sigh as Jamie let out a surprised gasp, then a giggle as Tony and Peter resumed hitting each other with said pillows.
"We're doomed, all doomed." Tony leaned in to kiss his nose. "Okay, we should make a plan for tomorrow. I have an early morning meeting that I can't put off, and then we should-"
“I understand, if you’re hard up for cash,” Steve teased. Tony elbowed his side and he couldn’t help but laugh a little. He pulled Tony closer to his side, arm wrapped around his waist, as they walked down the sidewalk. With their jackets on, the sky darkening as the sun set, they both had the pleasure of going mostly unnoticed, and unrecognized, in the crowds on the sidewalk.
Tony hummed, looking at some of the pictures people had taken. There were a couple of Tony and Steve stealing kisses, waiting in line at some of the rides, another of Tony’s hand on Steve’s back, and one of Steve feeding Tony a piece of his pretzel. He gasped when he saw one picture, face melting with the sheer amount of cuteness being thrown at him. “Pepper! I want some of these saved, printed, framed. There’s one of Steve with Jamie, and I might die from it.” Jamie’s face was caught in a state of shock, eyes wide, mouth open in a partial gasp as Steve had been feeding her cotton candy for the first time. The way it dissolved on her tongue had been the most fascinating thing in the world. Even Peter had smiled at the squeal she had made, her arms flailing around as she tried to get more. “Although, try to suppress those that include Jamie. I knew some not so kindly people that will recognize her, and we don’t need that kind of trouble right now.”
"Did you have him tested yet? He'll be five in October, and I think he should at least be in Kindergarten, if not First grade." Tony worked with Peter all the time on stuff like his numbers, and the alphabet. He was already learning how to write, and knew how to read. They were working on three syllable words at the moment. Peter had Tony's natural learning ability.
"Someone who doesn't know how to dance, Meg," Steve said with a chuckle. He grabbed his boots and sat on the edge of his bed to slip them on.
When they parked, Steve grabbed the bags, making a motion with his head to take the boys up to see Phil. Peter and Wade ran up the stairs, Peter's intent to probably find his grandparents now to ask them to live with them as well. Even after sleeping, Peter hadn't let go of the idea. Tony couldn't say that he was against it, he did have the room still, but if this was something that was going to happen, he really needed to get the Tower back up and renovated. They would start to get crowded, even in the mansion, with at least a dozen people living there full time. If everyone said yes, that was. Something to focus on later.
“She’s really good with spoons,” Steve corrected. “Knives are still a mystery, specially when she just rip things up with her fingers. We’re still working on the stabbing motion of forks, and I’m not looking forward to when she tries to eat spaghetti. I’m predicting sauce everywhere.”
"Everyone looks stupid doing this dance, that's the beauty of it!" Tony laughed, pulling Steve over towards Mary and Coulson. They all needed a front row to Steve Rogers, Captain America, doing the Time Warp.
"He looks more Mary," Tony countered. "And he needs a haircut, it's starting to get shaggy, and no son of mine will start to look like a hippie."
"Oh my god, Tony," Mary breathed before moving over on the couch and pulling him into her arms. "Tony, I didn't know."
Tony blinked at the song title, then shook his head. "I don't have time for this, Rogers." He picked up the razor again. A couple minutes later, another ping.
Steve reached into his pocket and pulled out another phone, a bigger one, then tossed it over to Coulson who caught it without looking.
Tony frowned. "You know what? I was naive before, when they said, 'Here's the line, we don't cross it. This is how we do business.'" Tony looked at him, really not wanting to believe what was happening. "If we're double-dealing under the table...." He paused, looking for any reaction from the man that was like his father. "Are we?"
"Do you know who killed the ex?" Rachel asked as Mary scrolled through some of the info, still reading it. "The one who it looks like would have tried to recruit her?"
"I can't stop." Tony turned to look at Steve. "I can't stop, or more bad things will happen. These things, they happen because of me! Who's going to be next?? If I can figure out why-" Tony covered his face with one of his hands. "I can't sleep! I don't have time, and-"
"Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam," Tony jumped in. No one talked to his friend like that.
"I keep snapping them in half," Steve said, a little embarrassed. "They weren't exactly meant for a super soldier, so I eventually just got my own box."
"I was told to make sure that you were comfortable," Steve said like it should have been obvious. "And I wanted to make sure that you were alright, so it just made sense to bring you here."
Steve rubbed the back of his neck a little. "I've had a lot on my mind today, and I couldn't get to sleep."
"Scared that he might lose you," Mary cut him off. Tony opened his mouth, then closed it. "In another universe, maybe he doesn't take the chance. Maybe he doesn't get unthawed from the ice and he loses you before he even gets a chance, or maybe you don't figure out the palladium and he watches you die."
"I can't come to see the hero of the hour?" George gave him an obviously fake smile, well aware that the paparazzi could see them. Tony knew the smile well, he had perfected it at age eight. "We used to have something."
“I don’t need a master pianist,” Steve murmured as he rested his cheek against Tony’s. “I like the engineer hands that I’ve got just fine. They seem to be able to play the piano just fine.”
"Don't exhaust your vocabulary," Tony said, eyebrow raised. Steve blinked and realized that he must have been lost in thought, making Tony wait.
"Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage." He held a second glass up to Loki in question. "Plus, you've got the blue glow stick of destiny. Oh," Tony took a sip from his glass, "I won't need my armor to take you down."
"You, sir, will like it when I come back from this visit," She smiled at him as they stood up, Coulson grabbing her jacket and handing it to her. "I love it when my man gets along with my son." Coulson smirked and she laughed as they left her office.
"'Cause I was referring to your company's involvement in the this latest atrocity," she continued, going on a righteous anger now.
Steve leaned back a little in the seat, watching Mary. There wasn't a breathing tube down her throat, but she did have an oxygen mask over her face. Probably to help her breathing in case the broken ribs impeded that. He opened his mouth to say something when he heard a voice echo from the hallway. It sounded female and Steve frowned. There was no one else here that he knew about, or that Tony had mentioned. Steve stepped out into the hall and saw Tony holding onto the phone, and he could hear a female on the phone, her voice raised.
“Strain on your eyes will make that headache worse.” Steve put the tray down on the end of the bed, hands on his hips. “You already pushed it by using the suit.”
“There’s never enough to learn in the kitchen, Tony,” Steve argued, taking a bite of his food. Tony rolled his eyes with a smile.
Obidiah clapped his shoulder before moving down the stairs, his bodyguards following. He was done for the night. He left Tony standing on the stairs, staring after him. Christine walked away after a moment, and he could vaguely hear Mary telling him to move, before heading back into the event as well. Tony had a lot of thinking to do.
Julie was already there, with Mary and Agent, on the communal floor usually only saw action when there were Avengers meetings. This time there were two tables pushed together to make a square, and the table was already set with dinnerware. Tony was directing some Tower staff on where to take the larger pieces they had bought, and was no doubt taking the bags himself. He had sent Steve off with the diaper bag, an outfit for Jamie, and Jamie herself.
"No!" Tony shouted, glaring at the blonde. "It's not going to happen!" He stepped to the side to get past Steve.
He knocked on the door where she was staying, and a couple minutes later, Wade was standing in the doorway. Tony blinked a couple of time. "Hey Wade."
The Ten Rings fell before him like bugs, their bullets bouncing off the suit. The door they tried to block him with, child's play to knock down. The first sign of distress he noticed was when he swung his arm too hard, getting it stuck in the rock wall. This was a part of his life that he was going to end. Never again would something he created be used to kill, to destroy, to torture. This was not the legacy that he wanted to leave for Peter, for his son to grow up seeing.
He saw Tony turn his head to look at him, but Peter was the one who asked. "Who's coming over?" Peter then tried to sneak a couple of chocolate chips from the bag on the counter.
"Feeling a hell of a lot better than I was last week." Tony watched the boys run inside the building, knowing that Todd would walk them to the private elevator. The two men walked over, Mary and Tony helping grab the extra bags. Rachel smiled at Tony, rubbing his elbow a little. Tony was a little shocked, but he returned the smile easily. "They didn't find out, right? Peter had fun the whole week, right?"
Tony sighed and ran his hand through his hair. Letting out a longer sigh, he turned to face Steve. “Alright. We have to face the music. There’s no changing this, no getting around it. We made our bed, now we have to sleep in it, and hope that no one throws the dirt on us just yet.”
Steve slowly, smugly, turned his head to look at Bucky. “No, this isn’t my boyfriend, you know that, Izzie.” Bucky would have turned a murderous glare on him, if he weren’t being stared at so intensely. He wanted to be able to come back to get the boys without the police tailing him. “This is my best friend, B-“
"Where was he??" Mary looked at the nearly unthawed body of Steven Rogers, Captain America, still in his World War II suit. There were only little bits of ice, and she was sure that it would only take a couple of more days to disappear.
"No one can get their hands on it," Tony told him, voice tight and angry. He wished he had had enough time to destroy the entire lab, to take the research out with it, but he was only able to wrap the vials in the fabric that covered the little girl.
"You know how you wanted to get back to your apartment?" Tony asked Steve, leaning the doorway to his bedroom. "Well, wanna head on over to Queens with me and the boys?"
"Just looking a little too eager there, Tony," Steve called back, putting his shield on his back. His cowl was still up, and he looked like he had to be pretty hot in the suit. Before Tony could reply a small gaggle of kids came out from the pool room, wrapped in towels, the lifeguards following them.
Peter and Wade had stayed back at the mansion with Coulson, so less of a chance of Peter appearing in the papers when people finally realized who was walking into the park, and what was happening.
Tony wiggled his body slightly and closed his eyes, but he started to hum at first before singing softly. “So, here we are. That’s pretty far, when you think of where we’ve been.” Steve rubbed Tony’s cheek with his thumb. “No going back, I’m fading out all that has faded me within. You’re by my side,” Tony opened his eyes to give him a smile, “now everything’s fine. I can’t believe-“
"Petey, get over here, kid," Tony said, trying to turn Peter down the hall towards the bedrooms. "Help me check on something real quick."
Tony made his way back to the master bedroom and saw Jamie in her playpen, the bathroom door open with Steve at the sink rinsing his mouth from toothpaste. “You are the master of the quick shower,” Tony called out to him as he leaned down to kiss the top of Jamie’s head. She had pulled herself up to her feet, holding onto the edges of the playpen. She was smelling of baby shampoo, and in a new outfit.
Tony groaned, and Steve winced a little when there was a burst of, short lived, feedback from the comm. “It looked like she was going to get Meg to get her hands on Jamie again. I should be surprised, but I’m more than annoyed. Were you able to at least figure out what her play was by taking Wade? Julie said she recognized Hilda as a sitter that her ex-husband had hired, but she barely ever talked to her.”
Of course they would have to figure out what to do with Strucker's Enhanced, and what it mean that they had let Tony go. Were they still with the man who was at the top of Hydra command? And was Strucker even the top? Jarvis had collected as much information from the SHIELD/Hydra dump as he could, and he knew that Coulson and Mary had been doing as much as they could to piece together what they could of the organization.
“Look at you, jumping into a whole new war.” Tony let out a sigh. “Alright, but when you’re done, you’d better get back here and cuddle with me. That’s my demand for being hurt, and my demand for making me go out furniture shopping.”
"It sounds weird coming from you," Sam said as he nodded. "So you usually shack up in his place, then."
"Not all the time," Mary told him, running a hand through his hair, trying not to smirk at Tony. "They have sensitive stomachs, and your Daddy moved her too fast. It's like a really fast roller-coaster ride."
“The rainbow bridge he’s always talking about?” Tony asked with a frown. “What did his girl call it? Einstein something, uh, Einstein-Rosen bridge. Is it like that?”
"Mr Steve??" Tears were falling down his cheeks and he suddenly threw himself at Steve, into his arms. "Phil is hurt! Daddy won't wake up!" He started to cry into Steve's chest, the super soldier wrapping his free arm around Peter, still watching Tony.
As Tony got closer Jarvis scanned the missile. Nuclear, of course. What in the hell was Tony going to do with this? It was timed and there was no where remote enough that he could put it in less than two minutes. If there was- "I can close it. Can anybody copy? I can shut the portal down."
"Cool." Wade was wiggling then, moving from Tony's arms, but he kept his back to Tony. "You know, it's nice spending time here. You and Mr Steve, you're real cool, and it's kind of awesome having you act like my Dads' sometimes." He then turned back around to look at Tony. "Maybe, if you ask my Mom when she gets back from the hospital to come live here again, she'll say yes." Wade's eyes looked so hopeful. "I told her about Peter's grandparents living here now, and that I was always over here anyway, and I think I'm making progress."
“With one big difference,” Tony said looking at him. “What changed when she went Black Widow on Black Widow?”
“I want to know that anything that I’m going to sit on is going to feel good, or that I’m not going to slip off of it, or even break it,” Steve argued. “Also we’ll need rugs, lots of rugs. With Jamie probably days away from walking on her own, there are bound to be a lot of stumbling, or falling, and I don’t want the stone and tile hurting. Also, Peter and Wade.”
“Yeah?” Steve asked, letting out a little chuckle. “Guess we’ll see if you’re right, huh?” He lifted the bags a little, then turned to head for the stairs. “I’m putting these in the room, maybe you can make us something for lunch?”
“He was hurting me, and it wasn’t the first time he had done it,” Wade blurted out after a moment of silence. “I mean, that’s why Mom wanted a divorce from him. He beat us both. I tried to stop him from hitting her. He said that if I could do that, then I was man enough to take my beatings.” Wade shrugged a little. Steve once again had that rare feeling of murderous rage go through his body, the exact feeling he told Wade that he’d never act on. In a perfect world.
"I just thought that I would have to set up a phone charging system for you after telling him that all flights had been canceled," she said, following behind him on the cleared path. She tucked her hands under her arms and huffed out a breath.
“You’re supposed to be waking her up, not giving her a new place to sleep.” Tony murmured, his arm wrapping a little tighter around Peter.
“We’re going to be watching that movie soon, aren’t we?” Tony and Peter nodded with big grins. “I would not wear the Hercules outfit though, if that’s what you’re angling towards for Halloween. I’m not that keen to show off so much leg.”
Bruce hummed and nodded. "There's a floor for each Avenger," he said casually. "He's working on a gym, and a communal floor for everyone. I'm by the private R&D floor that holds his workshop, and my own lab." Bruce took something out of the oven, placed on the counter to cool, then turned to face Steve. "He set them up so that they could crash here whenever they wanted, like after missions, or in Thor's case, whenever he's on Earth. If he comes back that is, but we think he will."
"What was that? I couldn't hear you, I was too busy eating my birthday breakfast." Tony started 'eating' him again, a new wave of laughs coming from the boy.
As the elevator stopped he was sprinting out and down the hall towards the Wilson apartment. He stopped and back-tracked when he saw that it was Meg's door that was wide open, and there was some yelling from inside.
There was a light knock on the door and both of the rooms occupants looked over to see Coulson standing there, holding onto a file. “Captain, good to have you back.”
"I think she's going to be an athlete of some kind," Tony said as Steve leaned over his hip to get closer to the baby girl. "Peter was a quick learner, but he wasn't this active of a crawler. Hey, J? You recording this?"
"Captain Rogers," Jarvis called out and Steve opened his eyes again. "Miss Potts is calling for Sir, but I felt that it would be an inopportune time to bother him." Steve smiled a little at the AI. "Would you be willing to take the call?"
Tony dared a look back at the man next to him, trying not to smile at the bewildered look on the mans face. "My son, he's turning two tomorrow, and I'll never be able to make it to the store to get his gift without being seen."
"Are you here to see Mama, too?" Peter asked, and Tony's shoulders tensed a little. Peter had fallen asleep before they had gotten back, and he wasn't sure how the little boy would take it seeing Mary.
Once inside the doors, Peter was looking up and around, mouth handing open a little. He had never been inside of a museum, (Tony wanted to make sure that Peter was old enough to remember his first museum visit), and he was absolutely entranced already. Tony guided the little boy towards the spot he wanted to go, and waited for Peter to notice the new banners. It didn't take long.
“No!” Tony shot up in the bed, trying to suck in a breath. The air was too hot, the room too warm. He felt wet, and his chest hurt. His hand shot up to check for the arc reactor, to make sure it was still there. A hand was trying to take one of his and he shouted, pushing himself back, and then he was falling, landing heavily on the floor. Tony brought up his arms to cover his chest.
“Uh, well, there’s no crisis.” Steve slipped on some sweats then went into the bathroom to at least wash his face. He would just take a shower in the morning, usually with Tony. “He came talking to me about the possibility of talking to a Counselor.” Tony perked up a little. “Sounds like Julie is still a little worried about what happened with her Ex.”
Tony licked his lips. He was trying to focus on the conversation, he really was, but his mind kept thinking back to what woke him up. He wished everything had-
“Go Uncle Rhodey!” Peter cheered from the sides, jumping up and down as the four men played basketball.
“Come on, Bucky,” Steve asked, and Bucky sent him a little glare. “We can totally do this, it would be nothing with your metal arm!”
"Lots of positive attention," Tony agreed. "And now he's something that takes some of that away," he said with a little scrunch to his features. "It's either going to go surprisingly well, or be a tremendous disaster, and I'm hoping for something in the middle." Tony caught Steve's look. "He's an extraordinary kid, well behaved, but he can have an epic tantrum if he wants. I've only seen it a couple of times, but I'd rather it not happen at all. Maybe I spoiled him with too much? Bringing his family and friends here?"
“And it’ll never leave this room,” Tony replied, smile going a little wider and Steve couldn’t help but give a little chuckle. “The kids are around, too.” Steve could read everything that Tony wanted to add after that. The kids were around, and he didn’t want them to ever think that he didn’t love them, didn’t want them to think that he wouldn’t do everything for them. He wanted to be the parent that he never had, to make sure that they felt comfortable, and never doubted if Tony was being sincere with them or not. Especially since Peter, and Wade, were becoming old enough now that they might see Tony doing interviews, or some of his older stuff, and they would be able to tell right away that Tony’s public persona was not how he acted at home.
A little hand reached out to touch his nose again, and Tony couldn't help but kiss the tiny palm when it came back down. "This might be tough for him at first, so try not to hold that against him. He didn't have time to prepare for this, and now he's being given another full time job. He won't regret, I know him, so try to go easy on him if he starts to look tired, or something." She made a soft sound and started to smile. Tony moaned a little. "Of course you're going to have his smile, I can see it already." Tony took a breath and licked his lips. "I care a lot about him, I mean, so much that I can't even comprehend the level of what I'm feeling, so I'll be there at his side. All the time. And that means that I'll be there if you ever need anything, too. I'm going to protect you." Tony brought his hand, thumb brushing over one of her round cheeks. "He won't let you down," he whispered.
"Had about eighteen months to get used to something that wasn't sleeping on a cot when I got out of the ice," Steve replied. "Thanks for the concern, though." Tony couldn't help but note that Steve was still holding onto his other hand. His hand was released when they made it to the elevator. "When was the last time that you got any sleep?"
Mary turned her head to look at Coulson, who was practically bouncing on his feet now, and they went up to the window. Looking inside the room she could then see that the something on the table, was actually a person. She sucked in a breath and put her hand over her mouth. She easily recognized the mans face.
Tony bit his bottom lip a little, looking over her shoulder to Howard, then back to his Aunt Peggy. She was always nice to him. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to go into the case, but I was just so curious. You and Dad always talk about Captain America, and I wanted to know more about him. I saw the brown belt, then I saw the empty balls, and then the other three. I’ve never been able to hold a pokeball before, and these ones actually belonged to Him, Aunt Peggy!” He wiggled a little, getting excited as he got lost in his story. “I pulled up the belt, and I saw that two of them were dark, and I wanted to cry for them. They were his friends, and he wasn’t around. They must have been so sad. And Vee’s ball, it wasn’t dark, but it was dim. I just,” Tony let out a little breath, looking down again before Peggy lifted his head back up. “Well, I wanted to help. I didn’t know who was in the ball, but I thought that maybe I could cheer them up a little, try and stop them from disappearing forever.”
“You found me,” Steve joined with Tony this time, “when no one else was looking. How did you know just where I would be?” Tony let one of his hands trail down Steve’s cheek to rub his ear lobe. “You broke through all of my confusion. The ups and the downs, and you still didn’t leave. I guess that you saw what nobody could see. You found me.”
"She's been here two days, Peter." His finger tapped Peter's back lightly. "We're not going to ignore you, Petey-pie."
Peter pushed his arms forward and backward, Jamie’s arms moving with him, and she let out another high pitched sound, that was one of her giggles. Peter grinned at her and moved his arms a little faster, making Jamie lean into him. Tony was leaning back on one arm as he watched the kids, his other hand gently carding through Peter’s hair as he played with his sister. Warm, but tired, brown eyes glanced up to the door to look at Steve. He gave him a soft smile.
So, this had to be the longest time between updates, and I'm sorry for that. Just been taking care of big changes for some health issues with immediate family. And then getting attacked with a horridly fever inducing flu.
"Chimichangas?" Tony guessed, and Peter nodded. Tony sat up quickly, throwing Peter off balance, and chuckled when he caught Peter with his legs making the little boy laugh. "Alright, let's ask Jarvis for a grocery list, some recipes, and get started! Do you have Wade's home phone number? I'll call his Mama, tell her not to make dinner, and to keep it a secret from Wade."
The phone rang and he jumped a little to grab it, shoulders slumping when he saw that it was in fact, said babysitter. "Jarvis tells me that you're in your workshop," she said as way of greeting.
“Grab the clone, I don’t care what you do to get it!” A second agent joined the first and they went back in towards the door. “We did all the work, and Hydra stole it from us,” the man was turning his attention back to Tony. Tony grunted when the man slipped something around his wrist, then the other. A faint whine of something powering up and Tony’s wrists were locked together in cuffs. “But, you also perfected the formula. We’ll take you, and the clone back, and you can help us recover what we lost.”
“Come on guys, I wanna eat these pancakes,” Bucky whined. “I’ve never known the pleasure of birthday pancakes, and the kids said it’s important.”
,” Tony persisted. Suddenly he looked down to the side, then back up, lips pursed, eyes half closed, eyebrows pointed. Steve pressed his lips together and sucked them in, holding back his gut instinct as long as he could, before he let a deep, loud, full bodied laugh. Tony tried to look put out before he was joining in the laugh. “Ego boosting, babe.”
Tony wasn’t sure how long he had been there, but it had felt like it had been too long. He knew that time was always different when he was sleeping, when he was pulled into what he thought were just nightmares. Now, he had to think differently about it. At the moment, his brain was just a little too muddled to process it.
“Okay, so, just so I’m getting this right,” Tony said, leaning in towards Peter and Wade again. “We’ve got, Ewan McGregor Kenobi,” he pointed at Peter, “Boba Fett with a lightsaber,” he pointed at Wade, “a time traveling young Luke,” he pointed at Steve, “and the coolest pilot around, Han Solo,” he pointed at himself. At Peter and Wade’s eager nods, and grins, Tony grinned himself. “Bad-ass.”
"Hi, Mr Steve!" Peter smiled up at him, short enough to avoid the view of the peephole, and the little mischief maker knew it.
"That just seems like it be counter-intuitive," Tony said, crossing his arms across his chest a little.
Tony walked into Bruce’s lap, seeing the man himself casually looking at some information, a cup of tea next to his hand. “Hey, Brucie-bear,” Tony called out.
“Nope!” Tony called out, attempting to keep a couple steps in front of Steve. “Taking the long week, straight into the weekend, which starts as soon as the kids get out of school.” Tony called the elevator, then turned to put a hand on Steve’s chest to keep him back. He could see the tiny lift of Tony’s lips, and knew that this was the start of a long game. “Hey J?” Tony started to back into the elevator, Steve following him. “Where’s my precious second child?”
"Peter Richard Parker," Tony answered, a small smile on his face. He carefully reached into his pocket, pulling out his phone, pulling up the picture that Mary had texted him a couple days before he had left for Afghanistan. Peter was wearing a blue Captain America hoodie that Tony had gotten him, a little pair of jeans, and a red shirt, grinning up at the camera with frosting all over his face. "He's a little ham, that's for sure."
“You obviously want something though,” Tony said as he took off his sunglasses. “Or else you won’t have come to see me at all.”
"What if you need to work on more than one project at a time?" Tony now looked confused. His workshop was bigger than this house, easily.
“Yeah, later,” Tony said quietly, biting back a groan when Steve managed to slide Wade off of him. “Oh, oh that hurts now. I can’t move, Steve, I think my body has actually locked up.”
“I’m not exactly sure yet,” Strange murmured, taking a couple steps back. “When we’ve all gotten more rest, I can relay what happened, but know that things have been handled at this point.” Steve watched the older man move, and then Loki was there. When he looked at the sorcerer he could see that even he looked winded, and spent.
Tony turned and grabbed at the man with the shield, arm wrapping around his waist quickly and shooting up, out of the gardens. "Jarvis, where's Pepper?!"
"I talked to Mary, and she said that she had to work late tonight, and that Peter had been spending a lot of nights at his grandparents place-"
“I like the way she thinks,” Tony said, looking over at Steve and Bucky, pointing towards Meg. “I knew there was a reason that I let you talk your way into my Tower.”
"Sorry, Stark," Steve muttered before he swung his left arm up, shield clutched tightly, beaning Tony with the flat of the shield in the side of the head. Tony stopped, mouth opening a little before crumpling to the ground the next second. Steve took a breath and leaned down, shield still clutched tightly, but gently moved Tony's head. His chest was still moving, eyelids fluttering as his eyes moved underneath.
"Nope," Peter shook his head, getting down from Tony's lap, though. "He said he's going to be here all weekend."
He lifted his eyes when he heard the slide of the elevator doors opening, and Julie was out like a shot. “Wade!” The brunette’s head popped up and he extracted himself from Steve’s arms to run over to his mom.
"Your baby?" Before they could continue their argument they heard the jets of the approaching drones, already settling down on the ground. The face plates flipped down and Tony sighed.
"Depends on what game you're playing," he told the women, moving the chair so he couldn't see either of their hands.
"Is a great deal," Tony finished. "I mean, free electricity, the building generates its own. And I've got enough business and companies subletting the bottom floors to render rent from anyone nearly obsolete. In reality, I have these living spaces that are just wasting away because no one's there to live in them. You'd be doing me a favor." He leaned on the kitchen table, pushing his sunglasses up. "I know you've had to change a lot of things around here, it’s been getting harder for you to keep a full-time work schedule, I know." He watched her lean back in her chair, holding her warm close to her hands. "You're under pretty intensive treatments."
“We’re just that good,” Steve said with a chuckle. “Also, most visits are done while you and Peter are in class, or otherwise occupied. I’ve brought Jamie with us before.”
"Figures that you would like the sneaky, snarky, demon." Steve grabbed an olive and pushed it into Tony's mouth before he could talk again, smirking. "Please tell me that you're not going to start searching for Hunters, or supernatural occurrences."
"I'm right here, Tony," Steve told him, lips moving against his skin. "I'm right here, with you. I'm not going anywhere."
It had taken Tony nearly a week to work up the courage, and he just kind of threw the invitation out to Steve as a random comment down in the workshop. "You know, there are still a bunch of holiday movies that you've gotta catch up on, and Jarvis insists on keeping the holiday spirit alive by taking over the TV. If you've got some free time, you can stop by anytime."
"I don't think that you do it on purpose," Mary told him. "It's not like you put out an invitation for people to come after you."
"If anyone can do it, it's you, Tony." Mary said, then pulled Peter's homework up to read over it. "But you can't hand over the Expo to Pepper? Or the construction part of this tower to her? It has to be CEO?"
"Tony!" Tony looked up to see the man in black swinging past Steve again, headed straight for him. The metal arm was pulled back for a hit, and Tony was pushed back into the snow, the arm just missing him. Suddenly there was a spark and the man was shouting in pain, a butterfly knife sticking out of the elbow joint, locking it in position.
“That’s what you’re used to, isn’t it?” She asked. “In business, you always need to start working on the next best thing before your competitor. You can’t fall behind.”
"He gives Natasha and Clint a run for their money in the stealth department, that's for sure," Steve muttered. "Speaking of, they're on their way back here. Should be here tomorrow night or the next morning."
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said waving his hand, unable to talk without his hands even over the phone. "Shoot me a call once you're all settled, or if you run into any trouble. I'll get that little spitfire of a kid over to see you after that." She thanked him again and the line disconnected.
"Well, that's what a serial killer would say to get me off my guard." She picked a booth for them to sit at, putting one of the menus in front of him.
Tony blinked slightly. "Barton is in charge of living creatures?" Coulson nodded. "That's almost as absurd as me being allowed to be a father." Coulson smirked, but didn't deny it.
“Probably not the bad news your thinking,” Tony commented. She raised an eyebrow at him. “Steve filled me in on what happened, and Jarvis gave me a little show, so I’m all caught up. I’m not gonna kick you out, but I’m gonna want all the information you know about your Aunt.”
Inside Julie’s apartment, the lights were dim, and the two men could make out the top of her head on the cough, wrapped around her son. Wade was no longer crying, but he didn’t look like he was going to be letting go of his mom anytime soon. Tony knocked just loud enough to be heard before they walked in. They walked around the couch to take a seat on the love seat, and Wade’s eyes sought out Steve’s.
Tony Stark leaned back in his chair, looking up at the ceiling through his sunglasses, waiting for the printer to spit out the results that three, maybe four, people were eager to see. He wasn't even supposed to be in the office today, he had called a personal day for himself, nursing a hangover from the night before that he had been hoping to not encounter by still drinking in the privacy of his own home.
“That’s a very vague statement,” Steve said as he opened a drawer to grab a shirt to wear. “You’ll eat a lot.”
“I do. Also, I don’t do it because I can,” Steve told him. “The people that we usually go against are those without morals, or their convictions are misplaced, and it ends up hurting innocents, bystanders, those that have no reason to be hurt. Those people have to be stopped, and if we can accomplish that without having to choose lethal options, that would be preferable.”
"You boys may wanna step inside soon," Natasha said to them. "It's gonna get a little hard to breathe." Engines started to come to life when she finished her sentence, and Dr Banner's eyes widened a little. They both walked to the edge, craning their head over to look down.
"Don't worry about it, Tony," the older man chuckled. "Just enjoy the rest of today." Tony nodded and smiled at them. He couldn't wait for Peter to find out.
“You haven’t told Tony that, have you?” Steve asked as he stepped over the bench, and Bucky pushed himself up to walk next to Steve. Bucky didn’t answer right away and Steve let out an involuntary snort of laughter. “You did, and you realize your mistake. He’s going to attempt to do copious amounts of Public displays of affection now in front of you. Thanks a lot, Buck. Now, it’s not only you who suffers.”
"She's not wrong. Where the hell are you??" Tony asked right away. He wanted to know why the hell he didn't give him a heads up that shit was going down, but now wasn't the time.
Steve smiled brightly at him, and Tony felt his insides melt a little at the sparkling of his blue eyes alone.
He gasped when his body suddenly jerked, a bright blue light flashing in front of his eyes. Then red. Then green. Something was in his head. “No,” he whispered, starting to shake his head. “No, no, no.” It was this long, this long being hidden away, he couldn’t go back, not when he was this vulnerable. “Help, please.”
"No! Leave him alone!" Tony could hear shouting, then a single gunshot and he felt the anger building up inside of him. He was rolled onto his back, shadows moving in front of the eye slits of the mask, and he readied himself. One face passed through and Tony grit his teeth. He had seen the man in the SHIELD office last month. There was no way that there were working with SHIELD. If Hydra really had infiltrated SHIELD then it wouldn't take them long to find the emergency releases of his suit, and Tony would be ready.
"Couldn't agree more," Tony said, putting his helmet on. "I'll meet you all there, I'm gonna get a head start on those readings."
Also, I've been thinking about it for a bit, but it's always good to tell other people than myself: I've been thinking about making a Patreon, for writing. I do a lot of original stuff as well, and I dabble in lots of other fanfic subjects as well. I'm mulling the idea around in my head, and getting around to posting my original stuff, probably on Wattpad. There'll be a link soon. :D
"Touché." He took a drink of the coffee, then reached over to add a little bit of sugar to it. "Also, I promised Wade I would ask you something a few months ago." Julie raised an eyebrow at her. "And, he kind of made his case quite elegantly."
There was a soft click behind Tony, and he turned away from the pool, expecting to see Steve coming in. A bright flash of blue light and his eyes widened at the large shadow of a figure. Tony was suddenly falling and the air felt thick and it was hard to move. He was no longer in the pool room, and he looked around, recognizing the streets of New York, seeing the Tower behind him. Tony's feet didn't touch the ground, but everything was frozen. Cars were in mid-motion in the street, and there was a black town car parked in front of the Tower.
"Seems all the decisions have been made," he muttered, before pushing out his chair. "If you'll excuse me-"
"I'm know, I'm sorry, Petey." Tony sat down on the couch, holding Peter close to his body, never wanting to let go. "But everything's okay now, I'm right here." Peter practically curled up into a ball in Tony's lap. "I'm not going anywhere, bud." He dropped a kiss on the top of Peter's head. Tony moved to put his feet up on the couch, back leaning against the arm, pulled his knees up and just let Peter use his body as a seat, cuddling the boy. Peter's hand was covering Tony's arc reactor through the shirt and Tony let out a little breath.
He stepped into Mary's room, seeing William sitting there, reading the morning paper. He nodded to Tony, folded up the paper, and got up, stepping out. Tony idly wondered if Jarvis had warned him, or maybe there was some kind of parent things going on there. Stepping up to the bed, Tony sat on the edge of the bed, glancing at Mary, looking peaceful.
She gasped, ducking when the glass suddenly broke, showering the ground. "Mary!" She looked up at Tony's shout.
Tony glanced at Bruce, and he could feel Coulson just behind him. He sighed, closing his eyes a bit. "He was working for Hydra. He and Zola were the ones that got Hydra started inside SHIELD." Tony opened his eyes to see Bruce's wide eyes. "Everything he had you doing, everything he was doing to me, it was for Hydra. Willingly." Bruce was about to say something and Tony shook his head. "Not the thing to focus on right now, gotta keep them from getting Jamie." Tony also hadn't had enough time to go through the rest of Howard's journal.
. Suddenly Tony was there, pressing a thumb to the bottom of the display case, then slowly opened the glass. Steve looked at the man, and he nodded down towards the tags.
"Well, then I wouldn't be in the same class as Wade," Peter said first, and Mary and Steve rolled their eyes a little. Peter and Wade were nigh inseparable, specially during the summer. Steve was shocked that neither of them had gotten hurt when they played together. "And Daddy was still a teenager when he went to college." Steve raised an eyebrow. "I like school, I don't wanna go through that much."
"Ooh," Mary said, making her mouth a little 'o'. "Peter's dad works for Stark Industries, so he would be down there, too. While his boss deals with that, Tony is getting the rest of his project off the ground." She felt a little bad lying to Steve, but she really didn't know how Steve would react to Tony being the same Anthony Stark, and she didn't want Tony or Peter knowing that Steve was Captain America. Steve was doing really well, and he hadn't decided on if he wanted to get back into any kind of field work or not yet. He was going to decide when they got back from Monaco.
"That's my boy," Tony said, kissing his cheek. He set Peter down, then ruffled Wade's hair, chuckled when the boy tried to wiggle away from the hand. "And did you eat all your breakfast, Wade?"
"They're from the same group, so you might not be far off, Cap," Natasha said, handing him a tablet. Tony leaned in to get a look at the information as well. "At least it's not giant animals this time."
Tony hummed. "No, they just don't always do things the right way, and so they make people upset. Like me. And other people. This will make more sense when you're older." Tony stopped by the bedroom door, opening it slowly. "Okay, I need your expert opinion on this one Petey." As the door opened, Tony peeked around, just to see what was going on in the room, and saw that Phil was already sitting up in the bed, awake.
"A boy and a girl?" She nodded again. "Sounds lovely. If you don't mind, what are their names? Ages? Unless they're twins, then who's the oldest? What school do they go to? Oh, does your husband work, or are you the main bread winner? Does he get more time with the kids, so that they resent you for not spending enough time at home? Or are they both numb to the fact that both parents work, and they're left with a sitter, or day-care all day?"
Tony stared blankly as Steve let go of him and started walking down the hall. "I'm pretty sure I was the target of an assassin today!" Tony shouted after him. "Shouldn't that change things?"
Tony blinked and looked at them. "You have an amazing eye for detail," Steve said to him. "Those are some of the best frosted cupcakes I've ever seen."
I do not own anything that Marvel/Disney own. I only own the ideas of plot, and the original characters of Jamie and Danielle.
"You've got the satellite phone, so you can call whenever, talk to Wade, keeps us updated," Tony said. The woman went to hand Tony the backpack, but Tony didn't take his hands from his pockets. Steve noted this, and the short look of discomfort, and Steve instantly reached over to take the bag. Mrs Wilson smiled at them, then went over to hug Wade, saying goodbye to him.
"I believe that is correct, Sir," Jarvis agreed. "I do not believe that it would be wise for the suit to cross into over the energy field."
"We'll talk about it after dinner," Steve said quietly to them, noting that Wade was stalking over towards them, eyes pinched and staring in Tony's direction. "Head's up, Tony."
Mary looked at Tony, blinked a couple times, taking in all the information. She didn't have much time to digest it all before the door opened, and there was a loud, little, gasp. "Mama!!" Peter saw that Mary was awake, eyes open, and sitting up, and he ran over to the bed. He was about to take a running leap, feet leaving the floor, and Tony reached over, grabbing him from the air, and settled in his lap. Peter wrapped his arms around Mary's neck, and Mary wrapped her arms around him, pulling him against her chest.
Peter just nodded and continued eating happily. Steve met Tony’s eyes for a second, before they went back to their own food.
"My son is cute, so I compare him to cute animals." Tony smiled, making deliberate eye motions of checking him out. "You look good with a baby in your arms." Steve kissed him softly.
"My mom is sick." Steve was pulled from his thoughts by the sounds of Wade's voice. The boy was young, he had just turned 9, barely over two years older than Peter, but he spoke with a confidence in his voice that Steve expected to hear from teenagers. Peter was leaning against Wade's side, looking at Steve, too. "She has bad cancer."
Steve glanced up, and saw the back of a man with brown hair, looking at the people behind him, ignoring the Senators who were trying to get his attention. The headline at the bottom of the screen said "Anthony Stark - Former CEO Stark Industries", and Steve could see the similarities already to Howard. That was Howards' son alright, even the cockiness that rolled off of him. Steve rolled his eyes a little, grabbed the remote and changed the channel before the man turned around. It was obvious that the man would make a circus of the hearing.
“For turning me into a sap,” Tony continued. “I was never like this before. Paying attention to anniversaries, looking forward to dates, actually going on dates. Thank science that your birthday is so memorable.”
“You’re already strong,” Steve assured him. “But that doesn’t mean that you can’t ask for help, or even for a hug. I do, from Tony. I even cry in front of Tony, too.” Any other time, Steve might not have admitted that to Wade, but he knew that it was something that Wade needed to hear. Judging by the surprised expression he aimed at Steve, he was right. “Yeah, I do it. And he won’t say anything, just give me a hug, try and make me feel better. Sometimes we talk about stuff, cause even I get troubled by stuff. It’s a human thing, but it doesn’t mean we’re weak. Makes us better, because we can try and make things better, to change the bad into good.”
Tony nodded. “Pretty much since MIT. Had this place built after I took over SI. Didn’t really have a desire to stay out on the East Coast any longer.” Steve kissed his cheek, walking into the middle of the living room, then slowly turning around to take in everything he could see.
