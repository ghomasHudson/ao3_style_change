"Nothing…" Steve whispered after the broke the kiss, looking at the Alpha with adoring eyes. "Just thinking about how much I love you." Steve said which made the Alpha's eyes sparkle in happiness.
"Do you want to?" Tony shot back, sending Steve a harsh studying look, making Steve try hard to stop the grin that wants to break on his face.
"W-who is the owner of the threat? Your or Aunt Peggy?" Tony asked nervously as he twisted his hands together making Steven give a terrifying smile.
"At least I am not peeping on poor helpless Omega who is doing nothing but enjoy their bath." The queen stated before collecting his hair and start squeezing it to get rid of access water, his words only get an eye roll from Anton who grumbled under his breath.
I hope I was able to explain as much as I can if you have some other questions for me please don't hastate to ask. For all the people who comment and liked the story, thank you very much, it made me happy to see many people liking my story.
Hearing his pup say that made Tony swallow tears start gathering in his eyes. "Captain… I can explain… I..." Tony couldn't continue words sticking in his throat, fear starts rising inside Tony about the possibility of the Alpha hurting his pup because of that misunderstanding.
Tony was frozen in his place, heart hammering in his chest, he wanted to go to his pup and pull him back into his arms, taking him far away from everyone and anyone, protecting him, the gentle grip on his arm made him turn to his mother who was giving him an understanding look as she steers him out of the room and toward his therapy.
Reaching a secluded spot, Steve turned around to gaze at the people occupying the garden with him at this time of day. A few families with their kids were in the gardens, visiting their sick spouses or one of their family members, nurses and even some doctors were making their rounds in the gardens, checking on their patients and talking to their family. What Steve couldn't take his eyes away from, were the children, running around freely as they laughed, playing and enjoying themselves, even some of the kids that wore the hospital clothes attract his eyes, causing a painful tug in his heart.
"What… happened?" Tony finally dared to ask, afraid to know what the answer was, but needing it in case Rogers was under someone's control, Steve shuffled in his place before giving a happy smile, but Tony wasn't fooled, he was used to reading the subtle movement, and he can sense that Rogers was far more uncomfortable than he showed on.
Singing creepy songs as Serpentine passed the halls looking for her new victim; Serpentine stopped in her place when she noticed a doll like no other in this mansion, a cursed doll. The doll in question looked like little Bucky Barnes, with the Shield and all, sitting on the floor with a dejected aura around him, sadness dripping from him like waves… and oh, my! Was that the cutest sight ever?! "Hello there, Bucky-bear!" Serpentine called out as she floats toward the doll, grinning when her suspicion was confirmed when the doll raised his head and let out delighted noises when he spotted her floating around.
"Well, that's awkward…" Bucky muttered making Tony hum and pull his hand away from the Alpha. "Look I'm sorry for my Ma's pushiness; can we just pretend this never happened again? I will be grateful if we do." Bucky said making Tony blink a little at that.
the only reason I asked your hand in marriage was that I love and admire you!" Rogers, the bastard he was, butt in, and Tony shivered at the murderous looks he was at the end of, but when Rogers words made sense to him he froze in his place until he felt Rogers taking his right hand in his and start kissing it like no tomorrow. By then Tony shrieked and pulled his hand away, already planning to wash it with holy water lest something happened to him and he caught Rogers's germs.
So what do you think?
"I see Captain Rogers, what will you like me to call you? I am sure being called Captain Rogers will confuse everyone." Jarvis said after he collected himself which made Steven smile at that, the man was just like his AI counterpart or Vision, straight to the point with a legendary patient and self-control.
That was the only thing Steve could say, everyone from all around the world came to say goodbye to the hero, Steve saw all of his friends, and to his surprise, even Thor and the guardians came to the funeral, but what made him seethe in hate was that Morgan and Pepper didn't even come to say goodbye to the man who still considered them his family, Steve never hated someone as much as he hated them. As for Steve he was still refusing to believe that his husband was dead, he was too tired and too drained, he spent the days before and after the funeral crying in Tony's lab surrounded by Iron Man's suits holding into the glasses Tony gave him not letting it go hearing the message Tony left for him in Edith's database, that Edith replayed for him over and over again at Steve's request, Dummy was there with him peeping sadly and touching the suits before wheeling himself toward Steve with a water bottle in his claw, sometimes with tissues, he was thankful for both Dummy and Friday, who refused anyone access to the lab, letting Steve grieve in peace.
Steve opened the front door, smiling a little when Peter grumbles to him about the mask being itchy, trying to take it off, but stopped every time Steve sends him a look. After closing the front door and locking it, Steve stilled when he saw Tony waiting for the two of them leaning on a black sports car behind him, it made Steve purse his lips, especially when Peter noticed the older Alpha and squeal in delight, running toward the Alpha which made Tony smile and swiped the boy into a hug, which caused the pup to giggle a little, and start chatting the Alpha's ear like no tomorrow.
"Let's get you to bed, Howard…" said Steve raising Howard and carried him bridal style. Steve walked toward his room, he heard the old man hum a song while moving his head a little…
"Bye, Ma." Steve said his goodbyes just like the sunrise, making Steve glare at the sun, blaming it for cutting his session with his mother sooner than he wanted. Steve then stood up and head to the mansion. He had a lot of things to think over, and one of them was how to win Tony's heart without changing…
They both said at the same time making Clint hightail it out of the bathroom, he runs downstairs in hope that he will be able to get outside of the mansion if he just reached the front door he will survive… suddenly Clint stopped, he blinks slowly as he heard an angelic voice laugh, the voice then starts to sing in a beautiful melody, it was so beautiful, so, so… hunted. Clint felt his body walked to one of the rooms without his consent, but he didn't care, as long as he heard that sound sing to him once more…
The spent the last hour together chatting and laughing; Pepper and Rhodey promised to stay in touch more, now that Howard and Obadiah stopped sending detectives and spies to their apartment, it was all thank to Rhodey threatening to expose Howard and Obadiah's treatment of Tony, which would have caused a lash at Howard and the company's stocks.
Making his mind, Steve went to Bucky and stood beside him, giving the man a small smile when the Alpha blinked at him in surprise. "There are people from the security company as well as the cops milling around, be careful or they will swipe you away." Bucky offered helpfully, which caused Steve to smile at the man and thank him; Bucky was helpful enough to point everything out to him, unlike his husband who was snapping orders left and right, making Steve wince.
Tony shifted in his place and pasted a smile on his face, trying (And hard at that) to ignore the glares and the killing intent that was directed at him… a killing intent that came from everyone in the hall. OK, so even Tony can admit Steve was hot and handsome; Tony wouldn't even mind going more than a few rounds with the man and enjoy themselves… but for everyone in the hall to glare at him like they wanted to kill him because Steve enthralled them in his curse of love? That's a little too much even for Tony who tried to hide the disgust on his face when he saw General Ross checking Steve out, like EEEEEEEWWWWW! What the hell?
Just like Tony predicts, he was going to regret turning Steve back to the Addams way, and he did regret it, big time. Steve now, is more persistent than ever; and that was a nightmare that keeps one and one, especially after him waking up from sleep one night to see that he covered in red and many roses' steams and dead petals surrounding him… he still refuses to remember that awful day, nor did he search what that red substance was… Other than Steve causing him a heart attack and make him curse the day his heart decided to sympathy with him; Steve was a lot nicer and considerate than he was before, if Tony told him to quit something that will destroy his mansion more than it already was, the man will listen. Even if it meant that he will go out and do it in the gardens and getting half of his land burned; but what can Tony say, beggars, can't be choosers.
So, they are now in their fifth month. Steve had been shocked and a little surprised at the idea of another child at first, not that much because of the recent events. But Tony and Peter had squealed and danced around their house for days, the scent of happiness and joy making even Howard scrunches his nose to stop a twitch of his lips. As it happens, now Steve is getting what he wanted and wished for the right for a long time and he couldn't be happier about that.
(See the end of the chapter for
"J.A.R.V.I.S. you have one minute to find them or else…" Tony hissed, his fingers twitching madly to have something in it, either to swing it and break something (Preferably someone's skull) or to throw it at Steve for being an asshole and hiding something like this from him. "Tell me, Rogers, did the deal you made with them include hiding the truth from me?" Tony asked/hissed wanting to know the answer because surely, there must be something in the deal that prevents his parents from coming in contact with him, especially after Afghanistan, the Iron Man fiasco, and New York.
"That is a big accusation, do you not think so…
…" Steve purred before leaning down to kiss Tony's cheek, an action that made Tony flush pink and for the people around them to grind their teeth so hard Tony can hear it loud and clear. It was when Steve was out of sight that Tony relaxed, trying to cool down the flush on his face as he remembered Steve's soft lips on his cheek.
"It's so pretty if I didn't know better I will think that da Vinci draws it!" Tony said as he looked at the stick figures with an amused smile on his face. "We are going to hang it in our bedroom as soon as we get back home, what do you think?" Tony asked which made the pup squeal in happiness and hug Tony tightly which made the Omega let a happy hum and breath in the pup's scent calming himself down.
"Shut up, I do help you know, I usually do odd-jobs around and fix everything that nobody can fix or have no time to, old man Dum-Dum told me I can work with him in the garage if I want, I'm thinking about taking the job when the baby is born and old enough to come with me, maybe can teach her a thing or two." Tony explained which got him knowing looks and smiles from both Rhodey and Pepper.
"Yeah… overprotective… you sure you didn't notice how the man has been trying to get in your pants since you came here?" Tony asks spitefully, not caring about jeopardizing Bucky's chance with Rogers, still a little bit angry for the mean things the man said to him.
"The Winter Soldier… who is he?" Peggy finally asked which made Steven give a small and pained smile which made the woman's eyes widen a little then returned to their size as her theory was confirm by Steven, even if it was not verbally. "You want a press conference, right? How big?" Peggy asked already planning a counter-attack if anything unpleasant happens.
Tonton was so different from Anton; it was like day and night, where Anton was born in Greece when it marked the height of Greek civilization in all of its aspects. Tonton was the next chieftain to his tribe, he was smart that much was true, but he was a hunter, he lived from the earth he walked on, he knows what nature wants and what he wants from it, he was not that much of an inventor or philosopher, his only concern was his tribe and family and providing enough food and protection to them.
"Tony! I'm home!" Peter called out happily as he entered the house, which made the Omega's heart nearly stop at that but he steeled himself and stood up from his place on the couch, walking toward where the pup was standing putting his back bag and jacket in the closet.
"Am I finally dead?" A hoarse voice asked making Steve straighten in his chair looking at the Omega who was looking at him tiredly, too tired to care if he was dead or not.
Angie on the other hand… was a firecracker, emotional. She would always fight with Peggy, about how they should find
"Yes, Peter, you are a hero." That made the pup smile happily; Steve kissed his forehead and put the shopping bag he brought with him on the bed. "I didn't know what to bring him, so I thought a blanket and a teddy bear would be a safe bet," Steve said looking at Tony who wiped his eyes and gives Steve a small smile. "This is for you, little Peter," Steve said getting a red, white, and blue blanket, Peter raised his small hands to touch the blanket.
That more than ever made the creature's interest and curiosity rise, for this was the first time he was near a human that didn't wake up and scream at him. the creature looked around the place, making sure that no one arrived to his land without him noticing; when he saw that no one was near, the creature gave a chirp swimming to the other side of the boat and rise himself until he was on the boat, making sure not to rock the piece of wood violently last it flip over sending both the creature and the sleeping boy into the cold water. The water was freezing this time of the year, even the creature couldn't stand it sometimes, and knowing how weak the sleeping boy was, the creature was careful in getting on the boat.
"He is nice and all, but I already have a girlfriend, Ma," Bucky said only to be answered by an angry growl, which made him wince.
"J, I give up, tell me where is Peter." Tony grunts as he leans on the couch behind him, having returned from searching the whole communal floor not a minute ago. You will think that for a loud and energetic kid like Peter, finding him will be easy; no Sir, no one can find Peter when he doesn't want to be found, even when Natasha gets involved, which was scary as hell if Tony has anything to say. Though lately, the only one who seemed to be able to find the smaller boy was no one other than Steve who took Peter under his wings.
Sorry for the short chapter, but this is the only thing my time allows me to write at this moment…
"I love you too." Tony whispered back, and the words roll off his tongue easily, causing Steve to smile, his heart thumping like there should be something even more to say. But there isn't, Steve knows that at least it won't be with words. "Let me show you, Steve." Tony asked gently causing Steve's breath to hitch.
"Oh, baby no, I will talk with your Papa, don't worry love everything is going to be fine." The Omega said cooing to the boy, rocking him in hope that he will calm down, Tony didn't know how much time has passed since then, but it was enough it seems for the pup to fall asleep.
About Bucky:
(See the end of the chapter for
!" A Beta woman with brown hair and red lips ran to them, pulling the small pup away and hid him behind her back as she gave Fury a dark glare hiding the fear in her eyes as she tried to protect the boy. "
"You learn fast…" Loki murmured with a sarcastic smile on his face. "It would have been easier to say that the mad was sane at that time, but it would be a lie if he was even considered sane. Every day, the mad got madder and madder by the second every time he saw the bright one looking at their love interest and exploring the worlds. In the end, the mad was able to capture them… let's call them the love interest, shall we?" Loki said as he leaned on his seat looking at Steven straight in the eyes. "Now the bright one was smart, they knew what the mad wanted, to break the rule, which defined his universe, but the thing was it was either them or their love interest, so the bright ended up making a deal with the mad, one-touch, one lifetime." Loki raise a finger at that, he could already feel the fear that rose in his mother's eyes, the suspicious in Odin's eyes as he gazes at Loki and Steven, and Loki had to contain his laugh at the confusion that colored every other face in the room. "But as I told you the bright was smart, for they know that there were other universes and that they can switch the places with another counterpart, thus that one promised lifetime will never take a place." Loki's grin widens as the realization crosses Steven's face. "Though the fates have a strange way of playing their cards, because here you are once again, back to the place you run away from… and Thanos felt it, he knew you are finally here and he is searching." That gets sharp inhales and gasps from the Avengers who finally made a connection to the story.
"We are finished." Margaret said after taking a deep breath, to help calming herself down, and to stop her laughter at the queen's dark look while he was wearing the dress. The queen by no mean was a small Omega like the rest of the Omegas in the palace, unlike any Omega out there, the queen has the figure of a warrior, a look that stayed with him even after years, a look that made the king rage, especially when the queen was taller and muscular than the king himself, it always ended up with the king raging and raising his hand at the queen, but the queen was a warrior, if the king hit, he will hit back, never standstill… that was until the younger prince was brought up.
After a long time of silence, Zemo hummed a nasty smile taking over his face which made Tony tense unconsciously. "As you wish, Mr. Stark… to cut this short, you are going to help me get all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s data and information, oh, and let's not forget about the nuclear codes that I know you can hack for me." These words made Tony pause before he started laughing hard, his actions causing the man to frown.
"Is he now?" Tony asked getting a happy nod from his pup, which made Tony kiss his son on the forehead. "Yeah, Papa saved us, didn't he?" Tony asked getting a happy nod from his baby. It was the first time Tony saw his son this happy, it made his heart pound in his chest with happiness, Tony couldn't remember if he gave his baby's name to his family, but he guess not, he was too out of it. The sound of the door being knocked on made Tony look at the door, he could feel his baby tense and hide his face in Tony's chest as he starts shaking a little, which made Tony shush his baby gently and turn to the door. "Enter," Tony called out hugging his baby tightly hoping that the calming pheromones he was releasing would make his baby calm down.
Just as Steve expected, Natasha throws a storm when she heard about what happened, shrieking and screaming until Steve's ears rang because of her loud voice. Steve doesn't even think it was funny when the woman threat to hire a bodyguard to tail him for the rest of his life (He knows that Natasha doesn't say anything she doesn't mean). In the end, it ended with Natasha promising him that she was going to look into it and find the stalker only to break both of his legs and dick; to be honest it was a little scary, and Steve sower that Natasha's hair was floating around because of her dark aura. Needless to say, Steve was scared for life; thankfully, he wasn't Natasha's target this time.
In the end, Anthony agreed, his heart was pounding in his chest when he returned that day when he told Steve, the Omega had looked at him with a shock then a small smile taking over his beautiful face, the Omega had hugged him and kissed him, telling him how proud of him he was, how he could do it, Anthony's heart flutter in his chest.
The room became silent after that, Maria was trying hard to hold into her tears at what she was told; how she was so blind that she didn't notice what took a place in her son's life? Peggy was looking on the floor, going over the possibility of succession if she sends her spies to find the Omega, looking at Bucky who was glaring at the ground clenching his fists, she knows how this Omega was important to him, after all when she went to recruit the Alpha and thanking him for saving her nephew, the Alpha made sure to inform her that the only reason he accepts her offer was because of him searching for his best friend who disappeared mysteriously eleven years ago…
"Let's go, they are waiting in Tony's room," Howard said tiredly, making Steve follow his friend, keeping his eyes on him, last his legs give on him like they threaten to do.
You will think that taking a vacation would have made Tony spend more time with Steve, now that he was always home; you couldn't be farther from the truth. Steve could only count the times he saw his husband on one hand and there will still be some fingers left. It seemed that his husband had either made it his mission to disappear from sight, or he was angry at Steve and doesn't want to be seen with him; which confused Steve greatly because he doesn't even know what he did wrong.
Stupid Anton, stupid foolish Alpha who refused to move on and mate one of the Omegas that Fury sent his way; the stupid foolish boy who continued to torture himself even after years and years with his stupid hope. Fury couldn't help that a part of him admired the young Alpha for staying faithful to a ghost that's long since left. Another part of Fury was angry at the hope Anton held, even after years had passed and the proof had been given that the person he was waiting for was dead.
?!' that no doubt deafened everyone in this room if Pepper and Rhodey's reaction when they just came in was anything to go by. "They are alive? How the hell are they alive? I saw their bodies!" Tony shrieked, his hands twitching to throw something at the wall and break it to pieces.
The more Tony read the sicker he became and the more horrified he felt when he realized what this meant. All this time, Tony was living in a home where someone innocent was brutally murdered; all this time Peggy and Bucky talked about their best friend 'Stevie' as if he was away on a vacation and would be back when in truth he was dead for thirty years. All this time Bucky would shake his head and would tell him stories about
"You will see." Steve said with a grin as he wore the mask and Tony had to stop himself from squealing loudly as his eyes widened not believing what he was seeing. As soon as Steve wore the mask, his face changed, instead of the clean-shaved face he saw a few second ago, a bearded man was standing in front of him, his facial hair was dark brown and he had a sky blue eyes, not the sapphire blue Steve had a second ago, his hair also changed color, instead of the blond it was, now a dark brown hair greeted him. Steve looked so different! There were some similarities, but if Tony didn't know any better he would have thought the man was stranger.
"What?" Tony shrieked as he pulled away from Steve's embrace, being thankful that they were flying in the Stark's private plane or there would have been a lot of people shushing Tony at his sudden outburst. "What do you mean they forgot our son in the supermarket? How the fuck dare they forget our son? Goddammit, Steve! Why didn't you tell me?" Tony hissed, trying to pull away from his husband, planning on calling his father and give him a piece of his mind; poor Peter, he was probably scared and alone in the supermarket wondering when will his idiotic grandparents return, and how was he going to call his parents who were in another country across the oceans.
Howard and Sarah still didn't see eye to eye; Sarah because she was still doubtful of the new Alpha she hasn't seen a hide or hair from in the past few years since she has known Tony. And Howard because he doesn't trust Sarah around Tony; that and maybe because Howard did some spying and God knows what and discovered how Sarah oppose the wedding at first, which mean stopping Tony's happiness, which meant that Sarah was on Howard's enemy list until proven wrong. Tony hoped that the two of them had figured things out and were at least soft of friends that they won't kill each other now.
Something in Steve snapped at that sight and before he knew it, he pushed one of the paramedics away and took the child in his arms, holding him close to his chest, which made the pup calm down and start crying holding into Steve tightly. "Sir, please, we need to do our jobs." The Beta said looking at Steve with an understanding look, it made Steve swallow at that and look at the pup, who tried to hide his face in Steve's neck.
Steve heard the voice getting fainter, so Steve kneel and took the glove off his right hand and touch along the ground until he felt a gust of wind, it made him gasp and take his Shield from his back, he raised his Shield high and give a hard hit, after a hit, after a hit, until he broke the wooden floor under him… the scent he smelled made him gag…
Finally, we knew Steve's real name! Who knew that Fury was such a softie?
A month of living in the Stark tower's penthouse with his father and family before Tony stopped flinching at the sight of different shadows, a month before his kids stopped jumping at every noise and rush to sneak into Steve and Tony's bed in the middle of the night; a month before Steve managing to stop growling at anyone coming near Tony or the kids in fear of them being the enemy. A month of Tony dreaming about Peggy Carter opening the closet door and shooting him, and Steve being late to save him and their baby; a nightmare that cause Tony to hold his screams every night as he tried to overcome the terror he felt.
Tony hummed and looked at the pup running his hand through the pup's soft hair sighing through his nose at the scent of content and sleepy pup, all the while wondering where is the pup's scary father. "Darling, where is your father?" Tony asked as he looked around at the watch that was hanging sighing as he saw that half an hour passed and he was still here.
"He is sleeping…" The king offered, finally letting go of Steven, his hand falling to his side as many different emotions played over his face. "He is with Petrus, the two fell asleep in Petrus's room after you have fallen into an exhausted sleep." The king stated, and deep down, Steven was grateful that the king didn't make a mockery of his terrified reaction not a moment ago, in fact, the king was acting like nothing strange happened, which was bliss in disguise.
Tony couldn't help but choke on a hysterical laugh that wanted to leave him as he realized how severe the situation was… was this why Clint came with a gun and shooed Carter away? A gun… a gun, Tony doesn't have because he doesn't believe in violence and doesn't want his kids to get familiar with the lives-stealing weapons… if only Tony had a gun now, at least he wouldn't be shaking in the corner of the closet like a helpless child hiding from the monsters under his bed. Hell! If only J.A.R.V.I.S. was on, then the police would have arrived and arrest Carter a long time ago.
A BAMF Steve! And I was tired from all of the angst so a little bit of fluff won't hurt!
A shadow from the corner of his eyes made the blond man blink at that tiredly and turn toward what he thought was a person, only to be stumped when he noticed that he has walked unconsciously into an abandoned part of their huge house… it was not as abandoned as Steve always complained to Tony about, but it was a place for the guests that will come to visit him and his husband, and most of the time Steven never came here unless he has something to do.
Steve stalked toward the place he thought he heard Bucky's voice coming from a growl nearly leaving his throat. "What the fuck is wrong with you! It wasn't enough that you destroyed my life with Steve now you want to destroy my son's?" Tony's screams of rage were heard as Steve reached the door the shouting was coming from, Tony's words made Steve pause, but only for a second because he thrust the door open hard making it slam on the wall behind, which made everyone jump and look at him. "Steve…" Tony breathed out as Steve stalked in the room his eyes on Howard Stark who was sitting on his chair behind the desk with a glass of whiskey in his hand.
"You mean the fruit bowl?" Anton asked with a tilt of his head, wondering what his son would want of a strange metal sheet that did nothing for protection. What made Anton's day though was the splutter James let out, the betrayal look in his eyes, how his face turned red, the curses he throw at Anton, made the Alpha snort and hold into his laughter, wondering why the kid would get this worked up for a sheet of metal that refused to be melted or shaped. "Kid, this Shield does not offer protection against arrows or swords, it is too smooth to be of use, and the metal refused to be shaped, this is not a Shield as it is a hindrance to whoever uses it," Anton explained as he stood up, getting the Shield from the bile of unwanted metal and offered the Shield/bowl to the kids, ignoring how James glared at him like he was the stupidest person to ever grace the earth with his present… yeah, Anton can see how much James take after his mother, they make the same faces.
One sob followed by another, and another, and another; Tony ended finding himself clutching Steve's hand and leaning on the bed, sobbing his heart out as he held tightly to Steve. Begging his love to not leave him, begging him to hang on, begging him to stay with him and Peter; Tony's body shuddered, breath ragged as he tried to get himself together, but saying that was easier than doing it.
Part of Steve was skeptical about what Tony just told him, he was in doubt, did his husband really leave his life goal for Steve, or was it just empty words that Tony was forcing down his throat. But this… this might be Steve's chance to get Tony back, to leave this place and salvage what he can of his family; this might be his only chance for saving his marriage and giving his daughter her father back, Steve would be an idiot if he wastes this chance. "Can we… can we go to couple therapy? I want us to be back to how we were before… and these past months… I don't know what to do anymore Tony... I think it would help us…" Steve whispered, fearing that Tony would refuse him and leave Steve hanging.
"I… Tony… we… why didn't you say anything?" Peggy finally managed to gather herself enough to ask Tony the question that no doubt was running through both of the couple's minds; a question that had been running through Tony's mind ever since he held Morgan in his arms, ever since he accepted that his baby died and the girl that was put in his arms the day he woke up was her replacement.
The sound of chocked whimper made Tony stop and look at the pup that was shaking, looking at Tony with fear and sadness, and Tony had to swallow and stand on his shaky legs, walking toward the pup and ignoring the groaning man, and the people that tried to drag him away from the pup, but no one really touched him, they were scared, a protective Omega can be worse than a feral Alpha. Tony kneeled near the pup his heartbreaking a little as he heard the hitched breath and saw the pup took a step back away from Tony.
Tony sat in the hard plastic chair thinking, as soon as he got the life-changing news from those sticks, he made sure to make an appointment with the Omegas' clinic near him, mainly in hope that the sticks are wrong and he was baby-free, but if he was… Tony swallows at that and clenches his shaking hands into fists. For a week now, Tony had been thinking about his options, about the baby, and about what he was going to do.
When Steve woke up, he woke up to a kind doctor, he was old, and his name was Erskine, the man had sat him gently and inform him that he was pregnant, that he was in his third month and that, they thankfully were able to save the baby because his neighbor was able to call the ambulance on time. That his health was weak, and he had to stay in the hospital for a little while to regain a little bit of health.
"…The queen gave me this amulet for protection…" Anton said, causing a hushed whisper to go around as everyone gazed at the amulet and the king, wondering why the queen would give the king something like this when the two of them couldn't even stand one another when they were forced to stay near each other for a small amount of time. "The queen informed me that taking the oathbreaker with us will bring nothing but misfortune and death…" At that everyone turned to Tyber, their faces darken as they saw the Beta finally get out of his hidden place behind one of the trees.
Steve froze in his place, blinking his eyes once, before narrowing them, a growl leaving his lips causing Bruce to shiver at the dark look in the Addams' eyes that promised death. "Who dared to hurt my bride? Answer me!" Steve hissed causing Bruce to shiver, clamping his mouth shut, shaking his head no, causing Steve to growl darkly. "Fine! We have a deal, now tell me!" Steve snarled, causing Bruce to let out a relieved sigh and turn to the notebook behind him, going through it.
"She is adorable!" Sarah said as she came to stand beside Tony, her smile is wide as she gazed at her granddaughter with happiness shining clearly in her eyes. A chuckle left Tony's lips as he saw the older woman coo at Morgan, purring happily when the baby took Sarah's finger in her tiny fist after letting go of Peter who was looking at his finger like it held all the secret of the universe.
And the tension is rising!
Jamti let out a breath as he followed his dear friend when Anton left his workshop, grumbling many insults under his breath, making Jamti's lips twitch in amusement when Anton cursed every elder by the name. Jamti paused in his place when he saw Anton's sight turning to gaze at his son; his son who was grinning mischievously and running around with the queen's babe, laughing freely and playing like any child his age should. Jamti couldn't help but bite his lips, happiness fills his heart; finally, Petrus was finally making friends and acting like someone's his age should.
They stayed for a little time talking and hugging, it was a few minutes before Natasha cleared her throat and raised her brow, pointed to the car, ordering them silently to get in, the plan was for them to have dinner at Angie’s and then go to Tony’s house, were Pepper and Rhodey were to stay with Tony for the duration of their stay.
Sorry for the late update!
"That's supposed to be my line, so unfair of you to steal it," Tony replied before turning to kiss Steve, too impatient to wait for Steve that he took the matter into his own hands. Steve could only hum as he kissed Tony again and again rolling the two of them around until Steve was on top of Tony.
"Because I know that deep down you think of Rogers as nothing but the monster that would kill you and Morgan the first chance he gets," Natasha stated, her words making Tony pause in his place, wondering how Natasha came to that conclusion even if it was right. "Rogers is not the monster in this story, Tony, if there is someone to blame then it is us… we were the ones who held back the truth, not telling you about Rogers and endangering your life. We are the ones who forced you to stay in this house even when Rogers doesn't want anyone living near him or living in his family house… Rogers is the victim in this story, just like you were. But you must understand Tony, what we did; we did it to protect Rogers." Natasha pleads, her words causing Tony to bite the inside of his cheek hard.
Though the man didn't do anything of that sort, he didn't attack Steve nor did he flinch when he felt Steve's hand on his shoulder, and when James raised his head, his eyes weren't glossed over, lost in a painful world of violence and pain and explosions, no, the Alpha's eyes were clear, but they were clouded with pain like he was hurting physically, and the brunt closed his eyes and tighten the hold on his head which made realization painted the Omega face. Steve rushed quietly toward the curtains and closed them heading to the lights next, trying to make the room as dark as it can get, the Omega had never had any migraine before, but his mother did, so he knows what to do, though his mother's migraine never acted this badly as to make her cry on the floor as she held her head begging for mercy.
"Then I guess that explains this…" Fury muttered to himself as he played the next video and everyone saw how Barnes' face turned from the dreamy side to the horrifying side in zero seconds, which made everyone turn to the screen, and for the second time that day, Tony's jaw fell on the floor.
"It was Tony Stark, wasn't it?" Steve asked after he saw Bucky calm down, his words getting a confused noise, which made Steve shudder as he finally gathered himself to ask the question that had been running through his mind since he woke up from his daze. "It was Tony Stark who slammed into our car when we were going home, wasn't he?" Steve continued, noticing how Bucky stilled before looking away, a pained look taking over the man's face before hope bloomed in his tired eyes.
"W-well, y-you see… I…" Tony stuttered, his eyes glancing around wildly as he tried to find a way out of this; oh my God, he was going to die, he was going to die by the hands of his friends just because he had the unwanted affection of a crazy Addams, oh why God? Why?!
In the end, Tony didn't count on his baby calming down as soon as the two of them were outside. The silence that greeted Tony when he left his house made him raise his eyebrow and gaze at his baby, fearing that something happened, with how quiet she had become. Instead of finding his baby looking fearful of sleepy, he found his girl cooing and looking around the place in what looked like wonder, which made Tony a little baffled.
Steven couldn't help but smile at the way Tony's face split into a grin at something Jarvis said, all the while Peggy looked at Steven who was playing with his wedding ring and looking at Tony with sad but gentle eyes when the realization hit her, she had to use all of her spy training not to let her jaw fall at that…
Steve's hands were shaking; they didn't stop shaking ever since all this madness took a place. Steve wondered in the back of his mind, he wondered what would have happened to him if he overslept or if he wasn't fast enough to hide in the bathroom. The answers Steve kept getting did nothing but made his heart stop for a few seconds in terror before the dark fate of his baby came to mind. Steve was lucky this time, but who said he would be the next time something like this happened once more?
"Yes, it was true, but at that time, he had an off and on relationship, I did confess though, but something happened, something big, that made us separate… we married when he was fifty-seven, by that time, I didn't care that much about having sex, and I know that my husband couldn't keep up with me even when he wanted to and because of that he always got frustrated by not being able to do so, but I never cared for that, I loved my husband enough that I forsake any sexual pleasure for his comfort and happiness… if Rogers really loves you as you say, then he will understand, and he won't touch you until you think that you are ready for it, and not doing it just because he wanted it." Steven said while looking at Tony in the eyes wanting the Omega to understand how important it was.
“I… I… planned for you to find out… in a more romantic kind of sitting.” Steve winced, crossing his arms and shifted restlessly, Tony thumped the box in thought, before he couldn’t take it anymore and let out a snicker that turned into a full laugh, ignoring how red Steve’s face became.
"Listen? Listen?! Listen to what? Ever since I became pregnant you were absent all the time, you are never there when I need you, and when I complain about it all you do is blame me for being too clingy or go on about how you are finally going to be the CEO and me ruining your chances! I should have known it all alone that it was because you had a fucking mistress around!" Steve snapped, unable to contain all the pain and hurt anymore, wondering how his husband could have done something like that after seven years of being together; Steve thought that the two of them were finally getting alone as they should have been, and now, Steve is being informed about his husband's infidelity by a fucking stalker who wants him for nefarious reasons!.
"But you were married for decades! How is that even possible?" Tony asked with wide eyes not believing the man, wondering how a relationship can be healthy if there wasn't even a sexual contact in it.
His little babe seemed to share the same thought like him, for the small boy kept glaring at everyone they pass with a dark look on his face, probably promising them a punishment of some kind; not that Steven would let James do that because he will pull the boy's ears off if he does something as stupid as this. Something that his babe no doubt knew, especially after the many risky plans he nearly did in the Hydra household.
"I… I… fuck this, I am out!" The raccoon shrieked trying to turn around planning on running away, not that Steve gave the raccoon a chance because as soon as the rodent's back was to him, Steve made sure to pick him up by his jacket before he managed to run away. "Let me go! Let me go you crazy motherfucker!" The rodent snapped which caused Steve's anger to increase, especially when the raccoon continued to cuss in front of Peter.
"You forget that this Tony is in love with your Steve… besides, I have lived my life with my husband, and was happy… I want Tony to be happy, and me asking him out will mean that he will have to abandon his happiness with Steve, just to be with me out of obligation." Steven said which made Peggy sigh through her nose and bite her bottom lip.
Margaret squeaked at Steven, which made Steve get rid of the top of the dress and look at Margaret only wearing his pants and pendant which made everyone squeak in embarrassment as they turn around to give him privacy, only Margaret who spent that time looking at him, having looked at Steven while he was naked numerous of times.
"What the fuck are you doing here?!" Steve's harsh voice made everyone flinch, and the reporter was about to flee, but he was stopped by two Shield agents who took hold of him. Tony made sure to cover Peter's head and coo to him as he was pulled away gently by his mother's caring arms.
In the past hours, ever since she learned about Tony and his Omega… she wondered what if she paid attention? What if Maria noticed that Tony was in a relationship? What if the younger Alpha told her about his mate-to-be? But deep down she knew that Howard destroyed every trust Tony had in them, what if Howard just let Tony be? Would their son be happier? He sure would have, just from the small clip she saw from the video she noticed that the Omega cared deeply for her son, she wondered what Tony would be like as a father, and she knows that the Alpha would have been amazing, she wondered what it was like for her to have a grandson, a small little boy or girl who would look just like her bambino, full of life and hope… what if, what if, what if… Maria doesn't know who to blame anymore.
"So… you are going to let a defenseless pregnant Omega walking in the streets of Manhattan alone?" Steve asked in a small voice, his lips trembled as he gazed at Bucky with wide shocked eyes. Steve didn't even need to count to three to see how Bucky's eyes widen with panic and shock; Steve thank his mother silently for signing him up for acting classes when he was young.
Anger course through Steven as he walked as far as he can, trying to put as much distance between him and the foolish king who accused him of something unforgivable. Fury still took hold of Steven every time he was forced to remember that the uncultured and brute king accused him of being a prostitute just because the queen decided to be friendly with him, accepting his friendship and rewarding it with a gift. Steven should have known though, all Alphas were the same; brutes, arrogant, so full of themselves. Steven thought that the king was different, for the Alpha seemed to see that Steven was not a delicate Omega in need of protection and shelter. Steven was even hopeful that the man would be a true friend and ally against the Stone family; what a disappointment, the Alpha finally showed his true color, and on one of the happy days that Steven experienced since a long time ago.
And lastly, there was him… he who spent nearly all of his time in Tony's room, who spent his time cleaning it and make it livable for the owner that would never return, he who enters this room for its calmness, not to draw, no, for every time he draws...
"Baby…" Steve sighed as he held the Omega tightly, pulling him away from the room, away from the place that seems to break his Omega's spirit every time he walked inside, he made sure to close the door behind them and lock it, not wanting the Omega to return to the room later, he hid the key in his pocket. "I can't tell you how to move on, I can't tell you what to do, you can't really recover unless you take the first step for that." Steve explained to the Omega gently which got him a growl in return.
"I know, bambino, I know, and I'm so, so sorry for not showing up yesterday when I promised I would, but something came up and I couldn't leave the team no matter how much I wanted." Tony said as he let go of his son, taking a few tissues from the nightstand and wiping the boy's face clean, taking another site of clean tissues and making the boy blow his nose when the Alpha nodded his head for him to do it.
"Don't be an idiot Rogers, you cut one head, two shall take its place, you get out of this door, and you will alert Hydra, they have people in high places, which can have you behind the bars before you even took a step outside. So get your head out of your ass and stand down." Steven said which made Peggy come and pull Steve away making the Alpha growl at the brown-haired woman.
The doctor sighed at that taking his glasses off, that display made Steve's heart nearly stop, but the doctor starts talking. "The pup had a severe case of Pneumonia, but he as getting the medics he needs." That made Steve sigh in relief and he took a deep breath to calm himself. "Vaccines are usually administered to prevent infection by viruses and bacteria, but considering that the pup was born into captivity…" The doctor swallowed, he couldn't even finish his sentence. "Did anyone of you held the pup for a long period of time?" The doctor asked changing the subject, making the group fall silent at that.
It ends up with Anthony lying in the bed one day after talking to Steve, he imagines the Omega lying by his side, talking with Anthony about something that happened to him today, it ends up with him imagining the Omega turning to him and smiling gently at him, heart pounding in his chest, Anthony imagine sitting up and lowing himself to kiss the Omega's full lips. It ends up with Anthony falling from his bed with a flushed face and the realization that he not only lust after the Omega but he wanted his love…
"Greeting, lady Frigga, my name is Steven Rogers, I am sure you already know about that." Steven's words got a smile from Frigga as she nodded her head at his words, waving for the team urging them to follow her, as she starts walking, away, which made everyone rush to follow her last they lost her, and Thor wasn't with them, having been kicked out by Steven who couldn't handle his childish whining (Even if there was a good cause for it).
As much as the Alpha wanted to introduce himself, he couldn't, not when the small pup in the Omega's arms called for the woman with a happy smile, not when the queen's eyes soften as he held the woman as she starts crying on his shoulder, and he thinks that the Omega wouldn't take kindly to him staying, not after what he informed the queen of…
A month, a month had passed since the supermarket terrorist attack (That's what the media took to calling it) a month passed with Steve being jumpy, scared, and suffering from survivor's guilt (Or so Bucky and later his therapist liked to say) a month of Tony refusing to leave Steve's side, staying beside Steve and refuse to let Steve out of his side for a second.
"I… I failed… 'im… ya know?" Howard slurred then shook his head and blink once again like only now he was seeing Steve… "He like ya… alw… always runnin' after Peg to hear you-r storiesss…" Howard sniffed and hiccupped. "Used to tell 'er new story about ya, so she can tell 'im… I wonder… would he be 'ere iff I follow Peg's plan? Would he, cap?" Howard asked pointing at the room, making Steve look at the door then sigh…
The shouting of the servants as they called for him, telling him that they were alive, made something tight in Steven's chest loose and for relief to take hold of him.
So after Tony gathered his courage, he went outside to Sarah's backyard, he mingled for a little bit with everyone, smiling happily when he saw Pepper and her family and Carol with her baby, Rhodey was back to the base and hopefully will return next week, after mingling for an hour with everyone Tony finally said fuck it and stand beside the fence too tired and drain to mingle anymore, and he was thankful when everyone left him alone, probably they realized he needed a little time to himself, though on the downside, it seems like Sarah's son was a little late, something about work running longer than he anticipated.
"That I did not, you were just slow, right Peter?" Steve asked when he turned to the pup and Peggy who was standing in the gym with a smile of her face, Tony turned his face to the pup and had to smile as he saw the pup's face is one of awe, as he looks at Tony and Steve with wide eyes.
"Thank you…" Tony choked out as he looked at Jarvis with a happy look on his face causing the Beta to smile and then return to his duty of giving everyone their breakfast, it was stupid of him to cry over a pancake, Tony knows that, but the Omega couldn't help it, because this was a proof, a proof that the Omega was finally home with his family once again… and secretly the Omega couldn't believe it, that he was celebrating his twenty-two birthday with his family, he raised his head to see everyone looking at him, not touching their breakfast, which made the Omega give a weak chuckle and raise his fork cutting into his pancakes and taking a bite, a smile taking over his face at the taste, mirrored by everyone as they start eating their breakfast.
(See the end of the chapter for
A pained whisper from a month ago echoed back with the same whisper two months ago. What about the creature though? The creature too has nowhere to go, no family to go to, no friends unless you counted the humans living in the town for years and years, but were they really his friends when the only things they did was sticking their noses in everything he does and disapprove of his ways of dealing with things?
As Tony was saying, what Tony doesn't accept was his friends trying to off him, why? Well, ever since the news of his engagement came out (With photos) everything had gone down, literally and figuratively. When the words got out because of those crazy women, who tried to seduce Steve, the hall went crazy, trying to corner Tony and threat him to leave Steve (Hell, even General Ross glared at him with a subtle threat, EEEWWW!) all in all, by the end of that night everyone in New York, no! In all of America, knew about Tony being engaged to Steven Grant Rogers the original Captain America and one of the four heirs to the Addams fortune.
"You are not a Stark, so is your mother, so I highly suggest that you escort yourself out of the HQ or we are going to do the honor," Steve said coldly making Morgan look at him with a scowl.
"I'm going to kill you…" Tony hissed when he returned his gaze to Zemo, ignoring the scuff the foolish man gave him, and with one last roar, he was able to thrust his hand through the bearer and take hold of the front of Zemo's armor who was standing near the bearer and he pulled the man, ignoring how his suit was sizzling and how Zemo was shrieking in pain as Tony slammed his face into the bearer.
"What happened?" Steve asked gently hoping that he wouldn't throw the older man into a raging fit with that question…
Suddenly memories start assaulting Steven, causing him to hold into his gasp and close his eyes tightly, trying to hold in the scream of pain that bubbled inside of him, as he tried to ignore the emptiness that seemed to crush him, the emptiness that only now Steven was able to notice, after his memories were back, and for a second, Steven wished he was dead.
"Do you act with this kind of familiarity with every Alpha you meet?" Anton growled the words before he can even stop himself, which did nothing but make his eyes wide from how stupid he was to say them out loud; by the blank look, Steven sends his way and the way the Omega's hands froze mid-air, Anton was informed that he had made a huge and unforgivable mistake. Steven let go of the amulet, taking a step back as his lips curled down in disgust, the dark blue eyes, became darker as the Omega shook his head in disappointment and disgust.
So what do you think?
So sorry for the late update!
Starkad gazed at the men that were forced to kneel in front of him with a dark look in his eyes; his scent spoke of rage and anger, sending terror down everyone's spine when they were able to catch his scent. Everyone was present to see the trial, and most of them were staying far away from him and the men; news had traveled fast, especially when it was known that the king's son was attacked and hurt by Hamar and his followers, everyone knows that if you touched the king's things no matter what they were, you are going to receive a harsh punishment; his people were already terrified as it is, not only was Hamar stupid enough to hurt the king's son, but he had also hurt one of his slaves. The slave part wasn't that much important, for a lot of people treated their slaves like dirt, but not everyone in the village knew about the runes decorating the Omega's arm but if they knew it will cause chaos, not only that, but it seems that a few of his people realized that the Omega was pregnant when he went into a shock, and that was another crime by itself, attacking a pregnant Omega, no matter who they were was forbidden.
Until his father jumps and let go to call the nurses, he couldn't… wouldn't, believe it, Tony refused to believe that his baby was dead, no his baby was alive…
"Mama…" The pup whine at that, but he didn't scream as Steve returned him to the paramedics, so Steve considered that as a win, Steve felt a hand touch his arm, and he turned to see the Beta from before giving him a sad but knowing smile, they gave the pup a few shots, and the pup closed his eyes, it made Steve nearly jump in fear, thinking that something happened to the pup, but the soft breath of the child calmed him down, the paramedics took the boy and rushed out, with Steve following them closely from behind.
The roar coming from the room made everyone winces, struggling to ignore the curses and snarls coming from inside the room.
That got a smile from Steve, he was feeling lighter than before talking with his Ma. She always knew how to cheer him, and he was so grateful for his mother. "Thanks, Ma, I needed to hear that." Steve smiled when he heard his mother give a happy giggle, he relaxed slightly and frown when he saw that the sun about to rise, which meant he will be about to lose connection with his mother soon.
Tony repositioned himself slightly and with every thrust, he hit Steve's prostate, dead on. The omega knew he wouldn't be able to last much longer, but he refused to come without Tony's knot buried inside of him. Steve knew just what to do to make that happen.
"He is away Tony; he is never going to hurt you and your pup ever again." Steve left it at that, making Tony look at his hands that were clenched into fists.
So what do you think?
Wanda and Vision were still out there exploring the world, Dr. Strange took it on himself to teach Wanda how to control her powers before she ends up doing something she will regret, so now she and Vision were in Kamar-Taj training new sorcerers in the ways of mystic arts.
"And I appreciated, little pup, but that doesn't mean that you need to scare your parents like this, wondering like this is dangerous, especially for young pups." Tony said gently which made the pup look at him and then nod his head once before looking at the floor with the flushed face before running behind his father to pull a back bag, Tony watch with interest as the pup fumbled toward him and get a sheet of paper out of the bag. "For you…" The pup looked down shyly on the ground the piece of paper in his outstretched hand and his bag in the other.
It took weeks for Tony to wrap his mind around the scary mess that was his pregnancy and his scared mind, it took him the countless conversations with Steve and even an emergency visit to Betty to calm down a little bit. Steve told him that it was his decision and that he would support him in whatever choice he was going to take; but the thing was if Steve left a decision like this to Tony, he would never get an answer that wasn't half-hearted or disastrous in some way.
"From today, this will be your room." The king stated, leading him to a bedroom on the first floor; the action made Steven blink his eyes trying not to look confused, he knows that the rooms on the first floor were that of the king of his son, so it gave the king no reason to give him such a room.
Why did he let his body die? Remembering seeing Bucky and hearing the heart-monitor, that made him pause, but it also explains everything he needed to know, the feeling of Bucky's warm hand holding into him tightly, begging him to stay and not leave, it meant that he had survived the missile, barely, but he did, and now with his body died, it meant that no matter what happened, Steven was stuck in this parallel universe with no way out, but then why did he leave? A shiver went down his spine at remembering Tony and Peter… remembering that with every tear Tony let, with every cry and plea he utter… millions upon millions followed his… millions upon millions screamed as death surrounded them… millions upon millions that didn't survive… Steven looked at his friends but at the same time they were not his real friends, and he couldn't help but wonder what was going to happen to this universe if he had chosen to return to his home and leave them, the Ancient One was waiting for Steven to explain, and the man didn't know what to say to the woman who seemed to know everything, but he was told that every dream has its meaning, you just have to look underneath the underneath. "Death…" Steven ends up saying looking at his hands trying to get his thoughts together. "Death and nothing but death…" Steven could only repeat those words which made everyone around him look at each other with fear and confusion.
The years after that start running one after the other, and Steven was so tired, after the heir to Asgard was born, a lot of things changed in the nine realms, but it was now known among the stars, that he 'Steven' had rejected Thor son of Odin as his king by refusing to look at his birth, news like this travel fast, especially in the magical realms, so now Steven was called crazy, his sisters and brothers refused to be seen dead with him, after all, why would a sane star look at Midgard the land of pitiful mortals, when they have Asgard the Realm of Gods?
"Still, thank you, for being so brave." Steven leaned down, kissing Petrus' forehead, causing the small boy to gasp. "Petrus?" Steven asked in concern when he saw the small boy's blue eyes got filled with tears; with a choked whine, the small boy ended up throwing himself at Steven, hiding his face in Steven's lap as he continued to let out whines and sobs, crying himself on Steven's lap. "Oh…" Was the only thing Steven could let out as he gazed at the small child in his lap; Steven let out a sigh, and he laid his right hand on Petrus' head, running his hand through the boy's soft hair.
"How could you do that? How could you? I was happy, I was finally happy! I was going to be a father, but you destroyed it all, destroyed everything like the plague that you are!" Tony screamed, the words made the room become quiet, Maria lowered her hands and took a step back her mouth opening and closing not knowing what to say, Pepper, let out a choked gasp as she nearly fell off if it wasn't for Bruce helping her keep steady, as for the rest of the team they kept silent not knowing what to say
These words cause Peggy to growl and step toward the pair of glasses that were lying on the bench, scowling at it with deadly eyes, "And why not? Steven is out there. If we don't act now, he could be harmed or worse! Isn't your primary protocol to care for him?" Peggy snapped at the A.I. standing over the still glasses, if it was any other time, Tony would have thought the whole ordeal was extremely ridiculous, with his aunt giving a pair of glasses her 'I'm disappointed with you!' stare.
So what do you think?
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, a little bit of violence, Tony can't helping but being a little shit, Steve will scream his head off, while Thor will have a heart attack! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Don't worry, Steve, Peter will help, won't you baby?" Tony asked getting a happy cheer from Peter who then rushed toward Steve, pulling him toward the TV so that they will choose, and knowing his son, they will end up watching a Disney movie tonight. The pained groans coming from Clint and Bucky confirmed Tony's theory.
The Alpha looked at the runes decorating the Omega's bicep, rubbing them harshly trying to see if the Omega engraved them himself to pass as one of them, but the mark was real, that much the Alpha can say, and it was old… too old, maybe a decade and a half since the Omega was marked with those runes. "How did you gain these runes?" The Alpha finally asked letting the Omega's arm go, which made the Omega pull his arm away from the Alpha's grip and glared at him.
“Well, I don’t know about getting Fury to approve their visit, that one is all on Mrs. Carter, you may not know it yet, but if you wanted something to be done, ask Mrs. Carter and her husband, they are responsible for the town, she is kinda the mayor.” Natasha pointed out, leading Tony’s eyes to widen, which caused Natasha to laugh in delight. “Don’t worry I can offer to bring them here with me, I have to go to the next town in a few days with Clint, to visit his sister Laura.” Tony grin joyfully, feeling excited at being able to see his best friends sooner than he expected; it ended with him bringing Natasha in a tight hug, causing her to squeal in embarrassment.
"A kiss, you say?" Steve hissed through gritted teeth, trying to count to ten and stop himself from turning around and punching Tony in the nose; Steve needed to calm down, he needed to calm down, or else he will do something that he would regret. "A kiss, you say? How should I know if I could trust you when it turned out that you were cheating on me?!" Steve shouted, pulling his hand out of Tony's grip and walked away from the bedroom, needing to cool his head down or he would strangle his husband possibly ex-husband on the spot.
Steve swallowed, trying to look around for an escape, only to find nothing, there are no windows other than a small one that won't even fit Steve's head, there are no other doors, no place to hide other than the tube, the only escape path Steve have is the same door he used to lock himself in the bathroom, a sturdy door that won't break easily. "Why are you doing this?" Steve asked, wondering if he made the man talk, time would pass and the police and Bucky would arrive and save him.
A tick appeared on Steve's forehead and Steve nearly started a fight here and now, but he stopped himself least he did something stupid and Bucky return to beat up the Beta before dragging Steve away from the supermarket and give him an earful. "Believe it or not, Sir, I can handle everything just fine," Steve stated through gritted teeth, hoping that the man would leave him alone before Steve punch him, pregnant or not.
Whispered the voice, getting broken every now and then, chanting the word '
Tony on the other hand, just gave the woman a soft smile, taking her hand in his and giving it a gentle squeeze. "Would you believe me if I say you are not dreaming?" Tony asked with a soft smile, causing Sarah to let out a shuddered breath and nod her head, wanting desperately to believe that this was real. "Come, I have someone who would be overjoyed to see you," Tony whispered gently, pulling Sarah with him closer and closer to the room filled with childish giggles and laughter. Going inside Sarah could only gaze at the sight in front of her with shock and longing, her tears finally sliding down her face when the man holding the child raised his head and their eyes met… if this was real…
It's a medieval story with Viking Tony! You don't see a lot of those, only Steve being the Viking….
"Steve!" Someone called his name, causing Steve to let out a choked noise of terror when he saw the person who called him was no other than Bucky himself, standing near Steve with a joyful look on his face and flowers in his hands. "Thank God, sweetheart, thank God you finally woke up…" Bucky smiled happily as he took a step toward Steve, causing the Omega to flinch away.
"Stevie, please, just calm down and…" Bucky was cut off by Steve turning his enraged eyes on him and snarl at the big Alpha which made the Alpha jump and back away slowly fearing that Steve will jump him and rip his eyes out, which was not that far from the truth with the way Steve was acting around them.
" That was Bucky, who gave Tony a nod before going to Steve's car, letting Tony handle guiding Steve to his car, sitting in the backseat with Steve as he let Happy, drive them home.
"Mr. Wilson." Tony acknowledge the man with a nod, it took Sam Wilson only a few seconds to snap out of his shock and return the greeting before turning to scold the children that cower behind Tony when Sam Wilson gave them the 'I'm so disappointed in you' look; which to be honest wasn't as bad as the look Steve has because his Alpha (God bless him) has perfected that look to another level.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve opened his eyes then, looking around the room to confirm that he was alone before springing into action; thankfully, his wheelchair was beside his bed, so slipping into it was easy. In a matter of a few minutes, Steve was ready, and already wheeling himself away from his room, taking many different paths and making sure to avoid his usual nurses and doctors so he would manage to slip.
"I see…" Steven hummed tilting his head to the side before letting out a sigh, following the Alpha until he stood in front of Anton, the Alpha narrowed his eyes when he noticed a wooden amulet in one of the Omega's hands, the questioning look on his face made Steven hum and answer his unvoiced question. "It is
"His name is Anthony Carbonell." The small pup said which brought Maria's attention to the pup, heart dropping at the last name Anthony choose because she wondered if the pup will ever consider Tony as his father when the pup looked at the picture in her hands with happiness and pride. "Mommy said he is the best inventor in the world, Mommy said he is even smarter than Tony Stark himself!" The pup said making Maria take a deep breath at that, it seems that her fear was true in the end, the pup will never recognize his father 'Tony Stark' as anything but a celebrity on the news. "Mommy also said that Wakanda, a place in South Africa asked for his help, so he is there right now he will return home after he is done working there." The small child chattered happily, making Maria clench the frame a little tight in her hands, but she smiled at the pup who was talking animatedly with all of his body just like Tony when he was excited, something she hasn't seen for over a decade now… she cursed Howard to hell and back even as she held her tears and sobs by sheer will so to not scare the pup who was talking happily about his father and the stories the pup's mother told him… she wondered if Tony can really undo the damage that Howard has done…
And it must be a dream, because even if this person was his Steve, his love and mate; he was so different; this Steve was… he was healthy, that was the best Tony can say without being lost in his gentle eyes and soft aura. This Steve was flushed pink, health and happiness on his face, no dark bags under his eyes, no pale face scrunched in pain because of the poison and many illnesses holding him back. This Steve was sitting straight, while his Steve always sits hunching down on himself because of his scoliosis. This Steve wasn't the twig his mate was, no, he was flush with health and a body that was the picture of perfect Omega, even his arms has lean muscle in them, his ribs didn't show like they use to. This Steve… this Steve was the Steve that Tony dreamed of when he thought about his mate without the illnesses that weight him down.
“Where is Peter?” Tony asked, uncaring of the question that Steve asked, or maybe not being able to hear it from all the chaos buzzing in his mind, how do people treat feral Alphas other than locking them up until they can go through them? How do they even treat a superhero Alpha on the verge of becoming feral? And what caused his Alpha to turn into this? Steve hoped it wasn’t what he was thinking of.
Steve always wondered about Fury, the two of them, believe it or not, become best friends after 'The End', most people call the final battle 'The End', but for some, they joked about being the 'Endgame', it made Steve shake his head at that because it was not the end, villains are still out there hurting people, coming either from space or from the same earth they walk on, there was no end to their fight, as much as people wanted one. Steve always wondered how Fury was able to live this long without aging a day; it always made him suspicious, after all, Steve was sure he saw a glimpse of him once or twice in World War Two and not his father as the older man liked to say.
"Mama! Look at dis!" Tony watched as his pup pointed at the orange cat that sashays its way toward them, and Tony had to blink his eyes and look back because he knows that his Mom hates pets of any kind, but here he was watching a cat, walk around the place like she/he own it, to be true to himself, Tony always wanted a pet, and he wondered if his parents brought the cat for him. "What's dis, Mama?" Peter asked with a delighted squeal as he starts petting the cat, which made all the adults shriek and cries in alarm, everyone but Captain America of course.
If he looked at Tyber now, Anton will probably see how pale and sick the Beta looked, no wonder, especially when facing a person who you thought will have no power in pointing out your deception. "I am sorry but do I know you fair Omega?" Tyber tried to say in what he thought was a smooth voice, but Anton could only close his eyes and wince… Tyber should have stayed silent; it would have given him an extra few minutes to live.
Gasping for breath, Tony flinched when the door to Morgan's room was slammed, causing Tony's heart to leap in his throat at the thought of Howard managing to break the door. Morgan's whimper was all Tony need to escape his terrifyied mindset for a second, making him run away to the hidden playroom; desperately, Tony hoped that his baby would stay quiet long enough for him to direct Howard's attention to the other way.
The police's sirens got louder and louder, causing Steve to let out a sob, shaking in Bucky's arms, wondering what was happening inside the supermarket with all the gunshots that were heard every few minutes. "Shhhh, it's OK, Stevie; it's OK, I got you, I got you," Bucky whispered in Steve's ear, causing Steve to take a shuddering breathes, trying to calm himself down before he passed out.
The Irish accented voice answered making Steve give a wobbly smile at that and knock on the door, he opened it a little while later to look at the man sitting near the window in his wheelchair talking with Dummy. "Steve? Oh, you are back! How was your mission?" The older man asked with twinkling eyes after he saw Steve enter the room and walk toward him. "Oh, for me?" Tony asked happily taking the roses out of Steve's hands.
It shocked him, after all, why would a star love a mortal, a mortal that was going to die between now and his next breath, a mortal who was nothing but a speck of dust in his long life. Loving a human, a mortal, it was hard, because days and years passed by, and Anton grow older and older, until his black hair as night turned white, until his blue as ocean eyes became dull, until his pale lovely skin became wrinkled… and he… he was a star, he didn't age, he will live billions of years, while Anton may have a year or two left in him, and then he will pass to Helheim or Valhalla while he will still be here, alone... shining.
Steve heard a groan, which made both him and Jarvis rushed to Tony who was waking up, Steve could feel the anticipation on every faces in the room, but when Tony Opened his eyes and look around the room, he paled when his eyes fell on everyone, that made Steve's heart drop and he rushed to the Omega, just as he let an ear-piercing scream when Maria got close to him. Steve held Tony's hands last he hurt himself by pulling the IV, that made the Omega paused and look at him frozen in place. "Anthony," Steve called out a couple of times breaking Tony from his shock and mutters something under his breath. "What..?" Steve stuttered, hoping that he heard everything wrong, but Tony just looked at him with a glare.
I'm so, so sorry for not updating this story for the past few months.
"No!" Betty suddenly snapped growling as she took in Tony who wasn't going to back an inch. "Do you even realize what you are saying or did all rational thoughts left that overthinking brain of yours?" Betty stood nearly nose to nose with Tony ordering him to back down, tough luck though, he wasn't. "Adopting? You married last month and you are thinking about adoption? Seriously?! Look I didn't say a thing when you and Steve rushed everything and married because I can obviously see that you two are in love, but adoption? You are out of your mind, this is not something you decide alone Tony, you are married for God's sake, you already have a child taking all of your time, a child I might say not by your choice but because he is your husband's son; Harley doesn't need to be mixed with this, he needed to be someone's first priority, he needed a stable home!" Betty lost it then, shouting as she tried to make Tony understand how rash his decision was.
"You got furious… and you changed, nearly destroying your world, and broke your Shield… how did you snap out of that state?" Loki asked with wonder, wanting to know how someone who claimed to be savage and mindless was able to snap out of his angry state, it made Loki think in different possibility, mainly to stop Steven if the man ever becomes as angry as he claimed one day.
To say the truth Tony didn't know what happen, one second the cat in his arms was a normal cat, the next second a huge asses tentacles shoot out of her mouth to surround the table near Tony and in a few second, it swallows the whole table like it was a bite-size kibble, Tony could feel his mouth fell in shock as he looked at the… alien?... who turned to Tony and start purring in his arms. "Damn Steve! That's the fifth table your cat ate in this month, do something!" Tony heard his father's screams and his son squeals in delight, and the Omega blinks his eyes in shock. That day he was told that aliens were real and that Goose was a Flerken, an extinct alien spices that Goose may be the last survivor of, and that she was Captain America's beloved pet who refused to leave his side and took the job of protecting Steve's home which was the mansion, Tony nearly starts jumping in triumph from his seat…
"Yes, Rhodey-bear?" Tony paste a smile on his face as he gave the bottle of warm milk to Pepper; his friend already had Morgan in her arms and was making silly faces trying to make his daughter laugh. Tony hummed as he turned toward the stove, platting the eggs, pancake, and sausages, and putting the dishes in front of his friends.
"Excellent, so you know about me, Commander Rogers." The man asked as he floated a little off the ground which made Steven blink, and wonder what's with sorcerers and floating off of the ground. "But I can't help but notice, that you seemed disappointed." The man said as he commanded his Doombots to attack which made the Avengers rushes to attack the bots and save as many people as they can.
But on another note, a vacation sounds great, maybe they could go to Malibu, Tony was sure that Peter and Steve will love spending a little time near the beach and enjoying themselves, and Tony can't lie to himself about wanting to see Steve in swimming trunks with all of his muscles on display, a thought always made Tony fan himself, being a soldier did wonder on Steve's physics.
"Papa!" The pup… Peter squeaked happily as he let go of Tony's hand to run behind the Omega when Tony turn around he saw a huge Alpha behind him that was hugging the child and throwing Tony suspicious looks, so much for the Alpha being big, that man could easily break him into two with his bare hands, he was huge and scary!
The sound of small feet made the Alpha tense and looks at the stairs to see Petrus looking at him, and the Alpha didn't know what to do when the small boy looked at him with such an innocent look on his face, painted by shock and disbelief. "Petrus…" The Alpha called out gentle, which seemed to snap the small pup, and the babe turned around and start running downstairs leaving the Alpha frozen in his place…
"Tony… do you think that your father and Mrs. Carter are like Stane?" The Beta asked which made the Omega shake his head 'No' and wiped his glassy eyes hoping that no tear was going to fall. "Then tell me, will your family allow you to go near any Alpha that will wish you harm, even if it was their close friend?" That also got a head shake which made the woman smile. "Another question, do you believe that Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, one of the active figures that always fights for Omegas' rights, who spent his life fighting bullies, will ever hurt an Omega, and an Omega that is close to him?" Tony paused at her question and start thinking about the answer; he then looked at her and shook his head which made her give a small smile. "It's OK to be afraid; Tony… it's nothing to be ashamed of. No one is forcing you to be with someone who you don't like, you are the one who chooses what's going to happen in your life… sometimes, it's better to take a step back and observe…" Dr. Ross's words made Tony bite his lip in deep thoughts.
"I hope you know what you are doing, mother." Loki said before he nodded his goodbyes to the woman and left, leaving the woman gazing at the pair with a thoughtful look and pained eyes, as vision after vision of what to come assaulted her…
What's going to happen now?
"OK that's it, please, give me your phone." Tony said after Steve finished talking nearly throwing his phone away and breaking it, the Alpha paused a little before giving up when the Omega outstretched both of his hands, the Omega gives a little cheer when the Alpha end up giving him the phone, entering his number in the Alpha's contacts, and sending a text to his phone. "There, now you have my number, you can call me whenever you liked to check on Peter." The Omega said which made the Alpha nearly protest but was stopped by the Omega waving his finger at the Alpha. "Because you are new here I will forgive you for not knowing, but I am the glorified babysitter of this neighborhood, everyone knows that and I also have Friday's off so everyone drop their brats in my house today, besides Peter wouldn't be alone, Clint's pups are coming in today." Tony said which made Steve pause and look at the Omega, a grateful smile appear on his lips at that.
Nattalegg walked from the cellar to the deck, mind going overload at what she saw and heard from the Omega, trying to make a head or tail of what she witnessed, humming to herself as she saw her fellow brothers and sisters loading their ships with gold and goods they took from the Hydra kingdom before burning it to the ground, taking a dark pleasure when she saw the smoke that resulted from the burning castle rising to the sky.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute! Tell me why Stevie went and destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D. with his Ma; they will never do something like that!" Bucky, poor, poor Bucky stood up from his place with shock on his face; if only that poor, poor bastard knew what his precious Addams were capable of, Tony wondered what would Bucky think of them if he was stuck for an hour and a half in a massacre ground full of bodies and screaming agents that turned into cursed dolls.
The scrubby grass stretching from the shoreline to the cabin was torn up and ragged, with deep gouges in the damp earth; Mrs. Carter looked around the place humming to herself. "There's a boathouse around the side. I am pretty sure there's still a boat inside, after all, it's rare that someone comes here, a quiet place for relaxation though." Mrs. Carter then headed to the porch with Tony following behind her, and Tony was grateful for the woman because Tony could swear that when he stared at the lake, it stared right back at him… maybe it was the autumn air? "The last owners were the Rogers family, they left the place thirty years ago, and they didn't take the furniture with them so you can help yourself with it." The woman hummed as she goes up the small flight of stairs before talking once more. "On the first floor you got a living room, a kitchen, plus a bathroom and a bedroom, the second floor contains two bedrooms and a bathroom, you also have an attic of a sort." The woman unlocked the door and push it opened grumbling at the rusted hangings. "There's a fireplace in the living room, so make sure you've got plenty of fuel stored for winter and… Dear lord!" The woman gasped out in horror which made Tony sidestep the woman to look at what caused that reaction.
" Tony stated, he was probably grinning by the tone of his voice, making Steve's lips twitch up.
That was the last Steve heard before the person on the other end hung the phone, leaving Steve and Tony in a suffocating silence; Steve opened and closed his mouth a few times, not knowing what to say before he finally gathered himself enough to gaze at Tony. Tony, who looked pale like he saw a ghost in front of him; Tony who was clutching Steve's phone tightly in his hand, like he was about to break it, Tony who... "What does he mean, Tony? Tony, what does he mean?" Steve's voice cracked as he asked the question, wanting to know but at the same time, he doesn't want to know the answer least his heart broke more than it already did hearing what the stalker implied.
"That's me, why don't we go inside so you can tell me about why you are here?" Sam said as he offered his hand toward Tony who took it with a tired smile, after that the Beta direct Tony inside, making Tony hum at the desks he passed and give a little pause at the missing children's posters on the board they passed.
This is just to help anyone who is confused about everyone's ages and the timeline.
' even when no one really knew when the Omega would leave that lab or if there was something wrong. Three days of everyone being sick and tired, wondering how Stane had managed to get out of the Death penalty when he should have been six feet under for months now…
It was only when Tony saw his children putting their feet on the ground; he started pulling the rope before hiding it under the bed, rushing toward the walk-in closet, trying to control his heart at the harsh footsteps that thud on the wooden floor. Whoever was outside, they wanted their presence to be known, which made Tony swallow and hide behind some toy boxes and clothes, controlling his breath as he continued to hear the stumping outside before everything became quiet.
"Sorry I am late everyone, the mission took longer than expected…" Steve froze as he heard a familiar voice coming from the door, he turns toward the door and his breath left him as he saw… himself… he saw himself standing near the door, that… that couldn't be right, he was here, how could he be there? It doesn't make sense!
"No, Mama… don't go!" Peter said as tears start running down his face which made Tony tear up and that and pull the pup into his embrace and cooed to him, which made the pup sniff at that and hide his face in Tony's neck.
Steven looked at his younger self with a cold and unimpressed look, which made everyone flinch at how much coldness in his eyes. "That's what they wanted you to believe." Steven said which made Peggy let out a chocked sound, what does he meant by that? Hydra was gone; Peggy had made sure to destroy everything with the Howling Commandos before they start searching for Steve.
"I always notice you, Tony. I always recognize your work; I just don't understand why you refused to tell me things like this." Said Howard as he took hold of Tony's hand, but the teen pulled his hand away, making Howard look at his son, with a broken look.
A gentle voice whispered causing Tony to let out a hitched breath, gazing around the place trying to locate where that gentle voice was. The voice soothed Tony's frazzled nerves after what he endured not a few moments ago. "Please…" Tony plea feeling the tears hot in his eyes, feeling vulnerable and small in a way he didn't feel ever since he was six.
"Of course, sweetie, why don't you start drawing while I bring the Shield?" Steve questioned gently as he steered the boy toward the coffee table that had sketch pads and coloring pencils, leaving the boy as he went to his room to get the Shield. He wondered what he was going to do if the situation continued to head south, wondering if he should try knocking on the lab's door once again and check on Tony, maybe plead with him to come out for Peter's sake.
"Mr. Stark?" The nurse called them out, making Steve raise his hand and stand up with Bucky in tow; excitement was already fluttering in his chest at the thought of him finally knowing the gender of his baby. The appointment thankfully went without a hitch, informing Steve that his baby was as healthy as five months baby should be.
"Is he bothering you again?" The blond Alpha, which Tony told him named 'Steve', came into the kitchen, a big gentle smile on his face as he took in the sight of Tony and the small boy attached to him. they made a happy picture, a picture that Howard had a long time ago but waste it away because he listens to the delusion of a mad man. "Good morning, Tony." That was a murmured breath between the Alpha and his son; the Alpha stood near Tony and the small boy, a whispered of something shared between them before the Alpha kissed Tony the cheek causing his son to chuckle happily.
It was past eight and Steve and Tony chatting about this and that, Tony was pleased that Steve told him a little bit about himself, which the Omega did the same, sharing with the Alpha a few stories about his adventures in the neighbor and Winnie's attempts at matchmaking, which ended up making the Alpha laugh like it was no tomorrow. "Please tell me Winnie didn't try and set you up with Bucky." Steve pleas with a smile, face flushed from laughing.
Thor's voice was heard in the background, and Steve didn't have to turn around to see Nebula holding him off, preventing Thor from coming too close to Steve and Tony. "Steve…" Tony whispered, his voice full of pain and hurt, and Steve couldn't help but blame himself, this was all on him, Tony was hurt because of him…
He refused all the invitation from his friends, from the Coulsons, the Banners, The Barnes, from his friends, he refused them all, he never get out of the house unless he has too, or was dragged out by force, always spending time with Dummy and Jarvis, always trying to close the hole in his heart…
When Tony put his paper away, the lights start flickering, causing him to raise his eyebrow wondering what's going on; it was after the winds start howling inside of his tight closed office that Tony realized… Steve was here. "For God's sake Rogers, stop it!" Tony snaps, putting weight on the papers last they were swiped away by the winds.
"You talk like you have the right to decide your fate." The king said as his eyes gazed at the Omega with an amused look in them which made the Omega growl and hiss at the Alpha, causing the Alpha to smirks darkly. "You amuse me Omega, especially with the way you think, what will you even do when you are behind the bars?" The king asked as he took a step toward the Omega, a laugh leaving him when the Omega snarled and thrust his hand through the bars hoping to catch the Alpha and choke him to death but the man was fast to avoid the raging Omega.
It was a shock, him hearing these words after more than twenty-two years; it made him think, and it made his heart ache, and not for the first time, the Alpha cursed the foolish queen for always doing this to him. When was the last time he thought of the sweet Omega who stole his breath away? The Omega who became his first and only friend until he was eleven springs old, the pretty Omega who jump in to defend him from the village's bullies, the beauty who wiped his tears away when both of his parents would have sneered at him for being a week Alpha, not like the rest, not strong enough, not smart enough, never enough…
"Oh God, please don't remind me, I had to endure Winnie pleading with me to throw the flowers in Natasha's direction, it was a nightmare, especially with her threatening Bucky with death in the same breath." Tony whined as he throws another invitation in the 'No' section. "You know I'm so tempted to just take you and Peter and run away from America, I heard that Italy is beautiful this time of the year." Tony grumbled, his pout getting bigger and bigger until his eyes finally catch something interesting.
"My husband used to say that a lot." Steven stated, causing Tony to smile a little. "Your husband sounds wise, who was he? You never told me who the lucky fella was." Tony asked, flushing when he realized that Steven was gazing at him with soft eyes full of love. "I think you might know him…" Steven stated with a smile before standing up and helping Tony, unaware of how red Tony's face was.
"Is he going to be OK, doctor?" Steve asked Dr. Anna, trying to stop the yawn from tiredness and sleep deprivation that wanted to leave. It has been a week since Peter was admitted to the hospital, a week of high fever and hallucination, and Steve trying to do everything he can day and night, catching sleep here and there which equals three hours a day. He was tired, so, so tired, but Steve has to hold on, for his pup, he has to hold on; he held on for two years, what a few more days?
Gone the grey roof and tiles, and in its place were blue tiles, a calm color that made her smile, the creamy walls of the house were painted white while the door was a dark shade of brown that almost looked black, the house also seemed…. Bigger, like the person living there decided to extend it and add more rooms to it until it reached the deck. The gardens, the once barren garden that was foul with only grass, was now filled with roses, flowers, vegetables, and fruit trees of all kinds, making the her tired blue eyes sparkle. The woman wondered about the person who turned the once deserted place into a lovely home; causing tears to cloud her eyes as she looked around the place.
"What are you doing?" Speaking of the devil, Tony blinked his eyes and turned his head slightly to see Steve standing behind him, looking at the screen that displayed the codes with wide eyes and dropped jaw. Now with a look like that on anyone else, Tony would have taken it as a look of awe and amazement, but coming from Steve who saw science more advanced than the one on earth it made Tony a little bit concern. "Tony, what are you doing?" Steve took a step toward Tony tiling his head as he gazed at the screen before him with furrow brows. "Why… why did you make the Space Stone the source of the power?" Steve asked and Tony really shouldn't be surprised that Steve was able to understand perfectly what was going on here.
Fury could only blink his one good eye, before letting out a sigh, grumbling to him as he leaned on his chair and cross his arms over his chest. "I thought you would have already gone to Carter and Barnes to get this information, they knew about Steve more than anyone else in the town." Fury stated, irritation coloring his tone, making Tony twitch and glare at the man.
"And why did you decide to become normal all of a sudden?" Tony asked his words slowly, looking behind Steve, wondering if this was a prank he was unaware of, it was a shitty prank if it was making Steve look like he wanted to burn himself just to feel like himself… well, that was the vibes Tony was getting, anyway. Tony was sure that no Addams in his right mind will want to turn out to be normal least of all Steve, unless… "Please tell me you didn't do that so I would date you…" Tony's eyes fell on the roses in Rogers' hands, the shift Rogers did make Tony's eyes wide in surprise.
"Hello young Master, my name is Jarvis." The man said which made Peter smile at that and touch the hand the man extends holding it with fascination at how big it was, it wasn't big like his Papa, but it was bigger than his.
P.S: So some of you lovely readers asked me some questions about the story that seemed to get some of you confused, I hope my answer will help you all in the long run…
"As long as those two are not in the same house as me or the queen, everything will be bearable… you did prepare a house for those two on the other side of the village, right?" Anton asked, will... he plead, but he will deny he did for the end of time, but he pleads that Magna found a vacant house for those two serpents. Anton can't have those two near his son or the queen; those two did enough poisoning that Anton fears what they will do when they have the chance to be alone with the still grieving queen.
Steve's breath left him as he looked at his fiancé's picture on the card, followed by the name Anthony E. Stark… Steve looked at the older man who was smiling in amusement at the confused. "As you see, my son… he has grown tired of you, so he told me to escort you out of his apartment, but don't worry Mr. Rogers, I will make sure to pay you for your time, that of course if you kept your mouth shut." The Alpha stated as he gets a checkbook out of his pocket.
. He never ever wanted Tony to change, he was just tired and in pain and he wanted to let his anger and pain and hurt loose, and Tony; Tony was the victim of that, the first one Steve saw after the heartbreaking news he received. Steve has long since stopped looking up to the future, afraid that if he let his son slip from his sight just for a second that will be it, and Steve was going to lose him; but Tony, Tony always looked up to the future, he always gave him hope. If Tony stopped looking to the future, then who will give Steve the strength to move on?
"Papa! I wanna Papa." His son sobbed into his chest making Tony close his eyes tightly at that. "Papa protect Mama, wanna Papa…" Tony let his son sob to sleep, he was too tired to tell his son what dead meant…
If you can, please go check it when it will be posted!
"Mr. Steve saved me from that mean woman! You should have seen him, Daddy! He hit her with a chair! Just like those wrestlers on TV!" Peter said, his eyes wide with awe, and a huge grin taking over his face. When Peter's words made sense, Tony let go and gaze at Steve with wide eyes, taking how haggled and tired he looked like.
Tony looked at the stranger that was standing near the door with suspicious eyes, pulling his baby tightly toward his chest after Peggy and Angie let go of the boy, he glanced at Steve who was smiling gently at the Alpha, who was she? It seemed that Peggy noticed his look and smiled gently at him. "She is my daughter…" Peggy said which made Tony's jaw fall a little for as long as he knew Peggy knew that she and her mate couldn't have children unless… unless the woman was adopted, the realization painted Tony's eyes and he turns to the female near the door and nods his head in greeting, which seemed to give the Alpha the courage she needs to step inside the room and wave toward the Omega and the pup.
"Way to go Steve!" Peter cheered happily, which caused Steve's lips to twitch up into a smile before he smoothed it down; of course, Peter would be like that, if he wasn't then he wouldn't have been Tony's son, like father like son it seems.
and Steve
"How?" Peggy whispered, letting go of Bucky, the shock turning her limbs into a liquid that can barely hold her up. "Erskine disappeared years ago with the secret to making the serum; no one can replicate the serum, Howard, not even you, so how?" Peggy nearly starts shouting, it was by a miracle she didn't; not that Tony wouldn't have started shouting any minute now, the only person was stopping him was his mate who was holding his hand tightly like a lifeline.
It started like any normal day, Steven going on his morning run around the mansion after calling goodbye to Peggy who was still glaring at Rogers, enjoying the nature he saw and thanking Tony for the mansion being far away from the bustling city, it wasn't the Avengers compound, but it was better, homer in a way. It all started when Steven returned from his morning run, intending to go and cook some breakfast, wondering who was awaken at this time other than Rogers and Peggy, humming to himself as he went to the kitchen.
Steve gave a sad smile at that as he walked toward his and Tony's room he paused a little in front of the door with a bouquet of roses in his hands. "He is with us, Friday?" Steve asked softly, waiting for the robotic female to answer, his heart pounding in his chest, this was their secret code when it comes to Tony these days.
When the three of them returned back to the mansion, Tony couldn't help from glancing at Steve every five seconds, a blush taking over his face as he remembered today's events, and he was thankful for the mask for not showing his (By now) red face. Steve, on the other hand, has this huge smile taking over his face, especially when he smelled the scent of a happy and sleepy pup, and the scent of content Omega inside of the car.
"He was scary." Pepper said as she walked inside of the room with Matt, Matt was called because Tony wanted his lawyer to charge Howard for the idiotic decision he made when he talked his lawyers into giving him a way to make the Omega gave his pup to him and giving the Omega a restraining order to prevent him from seeing his pup. "He rushed toward the lift we were in without a care for the security behind him, and start mouthing off the second I told him that the elevator was not for workers or public, his order even overridden mine." Pepper said with a sigh as she looked at Howard with a scrunched nose in distaste as the Alpha was finally able to sit on the ground when Jarvis finally sat his nose.
Steven snarled which only caused the Alpha king to give a dark smile and take a hold of his left wrist, tightly, making Steven flinch at that, trying to continue his glaring at the Alpha hoping he will back down, but it only caused the Alpha to hold tightly into his arm tugging him toward him making the Omega nearly stumble.
"No, Carter, you were the one who made the mistake; I warned you to never get near my husband and children or there would be consequences." Steve's voice got closer to the closet, and Tony couldn't help the flinch when a gentle knock on the closet's door was heard. "Sweetheart, you can come out now, everything is under control." Steve's gentle voice caused Tony to shake before he crawl toward the closet and opened the door, his legs not supporting him from how shaky he was.
"Did you have fun today,
Sarah is getting a little better, and Howard is here!
When Steven found Tony, he found the Omega packing his bags in a rush, which made the older man, let out a tired sigh at that and knock on the door, which made the Omega jump and whirl around to look at Steven like he was a dear caught in a headlight, and it pained Steven that Tony has an expression like this. "Oh, hey, what are you doing here?" Tony asked nervously which made Steven smile despite his heart hurting.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony did end up going to his therapy season, two weeks after he returned home, and it wasn't for his lack of trying to dodge the therapy seasons either. But beggars can't be choosers; he was relieved when he made his mother reduce the seasons from four times a week to thrice a week. And apparently, Steve was coming with them because he was a volunteer in the Omegas' clinic they were going to, Tony didn't know what to think, as he took his place in Steve's car, which was a nice black sports car, which made Tony flush because he always wanted to ride in a car like this, but it was mainly because he wanted to take the car apart and look at what's inside of it, and maybe even build a better engine, but Tony's stopped that thought before it can grow, the Omega didn't dare to touch a screwdriver since he was saved.
When Steve returned home, he has to blink when he saw Tony sitting on the stairs that led to the house's front door, gazing at the distance without seeming to see anything, which made the Alpha walk and sit beside the Omega, waiting for the younger male to talk, to do something, anything.
"He is a bright one, isn't he?" The sound of the queen of Asgard made Steve turn to the woman who was following his trail and gaze at Tony who was chattering happily with some scientist/magician that worked in the palace. The queen's question made the Alpha frown and then shrugs, not knowing what to say to the older woman. "You should move on, being hung on the dead will bring you nothing but pain and misery." Frigga advised gently which made the Alpha tense and gaze at her.
Tonight though, just for the night, Tony was going to dream, even for if it was for a little time, he will imagine what it will be like if Steve was going to stay with them, be a part of their family for good, and not just temporarily until they defeat Thanos and end everything for good. Tony took a shaky breath as he pulled back, gazing at Steve, taking in the soft blue eyes that seemed to sparkle like a thousand stars were shining in those blue orbs, it was ironic, considering that Steve was a real star. "I destroyed Ultron…" Tony murmured gazing at Steve's whose eyes widen at his confession. "I thought about what you said, and you were right, the risk with Ultron was great, but I still went on and tried to take that risk… thank you for stopping me before something bad happened." Tony cleared his throat, looking to the side trying to ignore how his face felt hot at the admission.
It made Steve's lips twitch up a little, but the smile fell as his son whine in fear and throw himself at his father when a female Omega walked near them, Steve looked at his shaken son and sighed to himself as he stood up with his son in his arms, it shocked Steve deeply when he found his son holding that Omega's arm without him screaming and throwing a fit like he always does when an Omega tried to talk to him. "Do you want to go to grandma's house today? Bucky would be there, and you can bother him all you want." Steve said as he starts walking, he heard Peter hum in thought then nod his head a, yes, holding into the bear in his hand tightly. Steve sigh at that and throw one last look behind him in wonder, that was the first Omega his son stood near and didn't scream his head off, that made Steve shook his head…
"Hey… what is it Handsome? Can't stay away from me the whole day?" Tony cheekily responded which caused the Alpha to let out a hearty laugh, a voice that nearly made the Omega melt as he let out a sigh and gaze at the man who was looking at him like he hung the moon.
"Why don't you look at that? I would have never imagined The Tony Stark in such place." A familiar gritty voice said, caused Tony to raise his shades once more, a grimace itching into his face as he saw the person he tried to avoid since he was 19 and successful in doing so for nearly twenty years.
But the thing is, Natasha knew she had competition, and her biggest threat yet, was Barnes. After all, the man was Rogers' best friend since childhood, and if she wanted to have Rogers to herself, then she needed to get rid of Barnes… or maybe she needed to lay a spell on Rogers so that he will fall in love with her, after all, she did hear the man say that he admires Enchantress for trying to trap Thor in her sexual spell the other day… maybe she will get in contact with one of her old buddies from her dark days…
Tony let out a sigh burrowing deep into his scarf as he walked toward his destination, mind racing with all the possible directions his day could head into. A year pass since his father dropped the breaking news to him, a year pass since he got his heart broken by his father, a year pass since hope start blossoming in his chest at the possibility of his son being alive out there waiting for him somewhere, a year pass since he told his friends who decided to help him in any way they can, a year pass since he started his search… a year pass… and nothing had changed…
The sound of his name being called made the trickster turn to Steven's eyes widen a little before be put the book in his hand down. "Traveler…" Loki said slowly looking at Steven when the man entered his room after Loki gave him permission, which made the trickster look at him with an unreadable expression.
It was six months later, and Tony lost hope. That day he stayed in his lab drinking, and drinking, hoping to die from alcohol then the poisoning, it was the first time Tony touched the alcohol since he was back from Afghanistan, his therapist made sure to forbid him, not like it was a loss anyway considering that Tony drank because of the pain not because of the enjoyment of the act as his father.
In front of them was a small
Tony flipped through the album, letting out a laugh when his eyes fell on the picture of Steve holding the small pup in his arms, looking so panicked, like he was afraid of hurting the baby, and it was so funny to see how a huge Alpha like Steve, was carrying the small (too small) baby in his arms, carefully, like he was going to break him any moment now.
A few hours later Tony couldn't help but chuckle at the laughter he heard coming from the living room, the kids were having the time of their lives it seemed, especially with all the movies Peter was trying to make Harley watch,
Steven coughed as he spat the foul taste in his mouth, having retched not a few minutes ago, making Steven frown at that thinking that he may be falling ill, which was not a good sign at all especially with the Iron King watching him for any misstep like a hawk watching his prey. It happened when Steven was tending to the garden, the dizziness that was followed by nausea, and then Steven was running to the woods behind the house, hiding behind a tree as he retched, groaning in disgust and pain, leaning on the tree behind him after he was done, burying the evidence of his sickness with a few layers of dirt.
In the end, Steve couldn't go, he couldn't because parks only open in the morning, noon, afternoon, and Steve only wakes up after the sunset. It made Steve a little angry and hurt; especially when he can perfectly hear what's going around him. Steve was never truly unconscious when he sleeps; he can still hear and understand what is going on around him, Steve only lacks the will over his own body to react, which wasn't fair at all.
I may even be late to update any of my stories in the next months... sigh...
Five months after that day at the clinic, Steve and Tony texted and called each other as much as they could even went to Central Park snd a few cafes and restaurants, and Tony was happy to say that they reached the stage when they can call each other a friend
"Who is she?" Steve asked with a dangerous smile on his lips, which did nothing but gain a smirk out of Tony… ah! How he loves when his husband gets all possessive and protective, it was even better to watch him go on a rampage to protect his virtue and honor.
"What… is a b-bear?" Peter asked touching that thing in his Papa's hand, it was soft and warm, made Peter want to hold and nuzzle it, he was feeling a little sleepy but his Papa's hugs and kisses made him keep his eyes open a little more, he wanted to stay with Papa and Mama a little more before Mama says it is a nap time.
"Come on, baby, everything is fine now, Sh." Steve shushed the little pup after the nurses were done, rocking the sobbing boy for a few more minutes before he leaned back a little to clean the pup's face with tissues from snot, tears, and spite, which caused the boy to whine at that and push Steve's hands away from him.
"Tony, wait!" Pepper called out as she rushed after him, no doubt planning on checking him for injuries or try to force him to sign a few papers for the company or something. Tony could only put his hands on his ears and shout out 'Nope!' as he rushed toward his room, not wanting anyone near him at this moment other than his hot tube and his fluffy bathrobe that were waiting to seduce him into their embrace.
Ohhhhh, Tony is finally pulled to the dark side! Nice!
So what do you think?
Finally Tony and Steve finally talked!
"But sweetie… he is… um. I…" Maria closes her mouth looking at Howard who was looking at his son like he sports seven heads and starts talking in a strange language. Tony wondered what they would do if he laughed his ass off right now, probably nothing good.
Margaret finally manage to gather herself to say, and Steven's heart hurts at the idea that his babe was forced into the life of servitude, but looking at his babe, the small Alpha just gave Steven a smile, and the Omega couldn't help but mirror that beautiful smile… his baby was so grown-up for his age…
To this day Tony swore to himself, that as soon as he said those words, the star shined brightly than it ever did, it chased away the coldness and hurt and pain Tony was feeling, causing a smile to take over his bruised face. He remembered walking, and walking, following the star that seemed to guide his path, he remembered spending all night talking to it, telling it what he was planning to do as soon as he was back home, how he will stop the weapon manufacturing and will finally do something that he loves for once, he remembered telling it about the robots he planned to build and the gadgets that will help people instead of the guns and bombs.
…" The king hummed behind him, his right hand ran on Steven's left arm, taking a hold of the sleeve's top and pulls it harshly ripping it gazing at the sleeve as it flutters until it falls on the ground, showing Steven's bicep, the harsh and shocked exclaims coming from the Vikings made the servants shiver and look at the queen whose face became dark. "I see, so you are nothing but a stolen relic." The king said as he circled Steven once more and gazing at his arms frowning at the bruises he saw and the traces of shackles on the Omega's wrist, but his eyes didn't stay long, his eyes found what they searched for, the rune that was engraved in the Omega's bicep.
Oh, no, Peter!
Tony bit his lips and tapped his foot, waiting for his turn to be called, getting a little nervous by the minute. Today was the day that he will finally learn his baby's gender, and Tony was equally nervous equally excited, he was very grateful that his friends were waiting with him. The last week was heaven for Tony, he spent every day with his friends after a long time of nothing, the three of them joking and laughing and working around the house, Rhodey and him with installing his A.I. in the house, Pepper helping him decorating the baby's room, nagging him about learning the baby's gender.
Go check them out and tell me what you think ^-^
"Thor…" Steve called out before the prince of Asgard called Heimdall to open the Bifrost. Thor turns his gaze to Steve, confusion, and a little bit of fear in the prince's eyes, and it made Steve hate himself for the way he treated the prince when he first met him. "I know this is a little late but… Thor son of Odin, Prince of Asgard; you are worthy and I acknowledge you as my king." Steve raised his head as he said these words, his eyes not straying away from Thor's even when the prince's eyes were filled with tears. "I presume you are going to be late if you stayed here, will you not?" Steve tilted his head to the side causing the prince to let out a happy laugh.
"Tony…?" Pepper asked him with concern but Tony ignored her as he was finally able to open the letter, shaking all the while it took him to read and reread the letter…
Tony's answer made Steve pause and smile happily a glen shining in his eyes. "I bow for thee, you won this battle but not the war." Steve said which made the Omega puff his chest in pride and wink at the giggling pup behind him…
"Wait!" Starkad narrow his eyes when he heard a voice ordering him to stop, which made him gaze around the place to see who dared to interrupt him. Only for his eyes to fall on James, the queen's pup, who was glaring at them with red-rimmed eyes as he was panting like he ran all the way here; in one of his small hands, the boy was holding a dagger, as he glared at anyone who dared to look in his way. "You took your justice, now it is my turn to take mine." James hissed, glaring at Starkad in the eyes, which made amusement shine on the older Alpha's face, and secretly Starkad wondered what the small boy will do with the dagger.
"His name, please!" Tony begged voice cracking as he did, he have a son, a small boy that would look like his Stevie, a little artist or scientist who will be too smart for his own good, making Tony worry about him six-ways to Sunday, troublemaker like his mate who doesn't like bullies.
But it seemed that he remembered something else, a nightmare of another night similar to this one. Every person Tony questioned, asked him who was Ty, even Angie the one she told him who the bastard's name is was. It was crazy; this was making Tony feel crazy, especially when everyone starts looking at him with concern.
"The queen spoke the truth…" Jamti whispered his eyes were wide as they refused to move away from the amulet Anton was wearing. "That means the chain of misfortune has started…" Everyone froze at the admission of Jamti, gazing at Tyber with horror at the misfortune the Stone clan brought to their village… Anton though, couldn't help but gaze at the bear, like it held the answers to his questions…
"Your… eyes…" Howard muttered scared to the bones, this was the first time he saw eyes like this, the only time he saw something like this was in the war when few Alphas went feral and start ripping each other apart.
"OK, Mr.…" The woman looked at him making the teen flush in embarrassment and mumbles his name to the lady, making her hum and look through her computer once again. "My name is Peggy Carter-Barnes, but you can call me Mrs. Carter." The woman said after she throws him another glance and returned to her work, only to frown after five minutes and swallow, throwing him glances now and then as her eyes returned to the computer. "OK, Mr. Carbonell, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that yes, there is a house available, a mile north from here outside of the town, a beautiful two-story lake house, with its own boathouse, and a few acres of lands, with a cheap price too." Mrs. Carter said making Tony's heart flutter with happiness at that, the chance to start all over again. "The bad news, the place is abandoned, meaning you have your work cut for you repairing the place, but don't worry, I will have my husband handle it, you just have to wait for a few months before the house is complete." Peggy said as she showed Tony the pictures of the house, making Tony's eyes widen at the rooms and furniture, and Tony nearly shouted out 'No' at the woman, after all, he won't waste his chance, even if the house was nothing but a box of scraps, Tony will buy it and modify it to his heart content.
Waddling fast, Steve ignored Bucky as he slammed his fists on the door, ordering Steve to get back and open the door for him. Finally, Steve managed to reach his car, getting in there fast as he started the car, hoping that he will manage to escape before Bucky catch up to him. Steve's tears couldn't stop falling down his face, blurred his vision, and causing Steve to blink faster and faster to stop the blurriness; his mind was still in shock, refusing to believe what happened not a few minutes ago. Desperately, Steve turned his eyes toward his phone, deciding to call Tony in hope of his Alpha coming to save him from this madness. "Come on, Tony pick up!" Steve snarled to no one in particular when his phone rang for the third time with no one picking it up, his heart pounding in his chest in fear, the thought of Bucky managing to catch up to him was making his heart skip beats in his chest.
P.P.S: So a lot of you dear readers asked that I put the translation beside the words in hope of being able to follow the plot closely without interruption… Buuut I got a better idea I hope that you will like. Considering that this story is going to take a place in Iceland and everyone other than the servants working in the Hydra palace knew Icelandic, I made an easy solution.
"We are talking to you Omega; you can't just walk around after your mate destroyed our home!" Someone pulled his arm which made the Omega snarl at that and pull his arm before punching the person who touched him in the face, hard, which caused the man's nose to break and for him to shout as he backed away, which made the Omega tense and prepare himself for a fight that will happen.
Steve had to smile when he was done, with cleaning, his smile widen even more at the thought of making a good first impression, maybe Tony's brother wouldn't be like Howard and Maria with their 'Higher-than-thou' attitude and ruin Steve's good mood (And hopes) though he was sure that the man is going to be great, after all, Tony wouldn't praise his little brother if he wasn't a good man.
Turning to Bucky; Steve had to laugh at the dear in a headlight look the Alpha sported as he gazed at the machine in front of him with wonder, blinking his eyes a few times as he gazed at Steve's stomach and the screen over and over. "Wow… a girl…" Bucky said speechlessly, and Steve couldn't have said it better, not when the joy and happiness coursed inside of him; Steve was grateful that he wasn't alone at this important moment of his life, he wouldn't have known what he would have done if he was, but he was happy that Bucky was there with him.
"What do you know about Hydra?" Tony asked with mischief which caused the boy's eyes to widen like plates if that was possible, and he let out a gasp at that, looking at Tony like the Alpha told him Christmas came early.
Steve ran all the way to the hospital, heart pounding in his throat from fear, tears stinging his eyes, he still couldn't believe what Cassie had told him, he just saw Tony this morning, laughing and joking with him, they were even going to Cassie's to meet her boyfriend and parents, how did this happen? Thought Steve as he thrust the glass doors open, making everyone look at him, he saw Cassie crying in the corner so he rushed toward her, he didn't remember what he said or screamed, but it ends with the doctors rushing toward him, trying to calm him down.
Any other person who even dared to act the way Braes did would have met their end by Starkad's hands, but as it was, the Beta had been Starkad's friend for over a decade and a half. "A brawl is taking a place on the main road, Hamar and his followers are terrorizing the queen when he was heading to his people, the young prince tried to stop them and…" Any other word Braes tried to tell him went over his head, and he starts running as fast as he can to the main road, his heart was pounding in his throat at the thought of his son being in the middle of a brawl, especially a brawl that had Hamar in it, for the man always played dirty, and always tried to take away his most prized possessions.
Waiting… it was the most hated thing he was forced to do. Just sit here in his chair and wait… wait for a bunch of stupid sticks to decided his life forever, wait for it to tell him how much he messed up, how he was such an idiot and destroyed his life. He swallows and closes his eyes tightly praying to God that it wasn't what he thought of. It was just a stupid mistake, just a stupid party he went to because it would be the last time he will see his best friend before he left for God knows how long, his problem? He drank too much, he clouded his judgment, and end up sleeping with someone without protection. It would have been fine, after all, he wasn't in heat, and it should have been fine… it should…
"Greetings traveler, my name is Heimdall, it is an honor to finally meet you." The huge man said as he gave a little bow toward Steven. "If you will please follow me, I will take you toward the AllFather." The man took his sword off from the golden stage and start walking toward Asgard, which made everyone, follow him with Steven leading them.
"You got it all wrong Tony." It was Peggy, who said these words, taking a step toward Tony and pushing Bucky behind her sending him a dark look when Bucky dared to open his mouth. "Everything until now, we did everything we could to protect you, we know that the only place you would be safe is near the lake," Peggy stated in a calm voice as she took a step toward Tony which gained her nothing but a dark growled.
"Fuck you!" Steve hissed, growling as he walked away from Tony ignoring how the two Alphas followed him, Tony with wide eyes and Bucky with an uncomfortable look. "I am going to stay at Natasha, don't call me, don't talk to me, don't even come and visit unless you are ready to go to couple therapy or it's about divorce." Steve snapped, finally finding his car's keys and leaving the house, ignoring how he was leaving the house with nothing on his back other than his pajamas. Fuck Tony, fuck Howard, fuck Pepper Potts, fuck the stalker and everyone out there, and most importantly, fuck Steve for being an idiot who always gets betrayed and cheated by the people he thought loved him and were his family.

/Warning/: This Chapter contains, Fluffiest fluffs, a little bit of sadness, cuteness, smut, and finally the wedding is here! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
"I don't know Buck." Steve said after he paused, and that by itself made Bucky look at the Omega from the corner of his eye, years ago, a question like this would have had Steve spitting out a 'Fine' but know, now with a son and a house Steve seem different, tired, it made Bucky worried. "It's hard… Peter is sick, very sick, cancer." That made Bucky inhales the memory of Sarah Rogers flashing before his eyes. "And after the alien's attack… it is funny I really wanted to laugh every time I say this, but after the attack, the hospital was destroyed, the one that treated Peter, and I have to find a new hospital, and I have to pay double the amount, and… and I am so tired, Bucky." The last part was said in a whisper but Bucky catches it anyway.
"Oh? I never thought I will see the day that Steven will finally admit defeat. Oh well, there is no shame in admitting your weakness without even trying to overcome it." Peggy stated as she gazed at her nails with a thoughtful hum. Steve knew he should walk away, he knows that Peggy was trying to edge him, that she was trying to raise his competitive streak… unfortunately if a challenge presents itself Steve didn't back down without a fight. Steve stopped in his way, cursing himself for how stupid he was for rising to the challenge, before turning around and march toward Bucky, ignoring the man's squeak as he tried to back away from Steve, who had the look of someone who was planning to march to war.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, darkness, horror elements, creepiness, a little bit of violence, sadness, puppy Steve who tries hard to win Tony's love, and we meet a lot of surprising characters! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated... A big thank you for the amazing 'Publisher021'! You are a gem!
"Did I ask you to correct me, foolish mortal?" Steve snapped, finally getting feed up and throw the raccoon at the man, causing him to falter to catch the raccoon who was too shocked to do anything. "Now, I am the one who is going to ask the questions here, and I advise you to answer them; it won't be smart gaining the ire of a star after invading their territory." Steve hissed his brightness and shining increased the angrier he became, which made the guardians shuffled before nodding their heads in fear…
"As a matter of fact, I do!" Steven said sarcastically as he sat up and looked at that metal thing, which made it tilt its head waiting. "You see there, that dark sky?" Steven said as he pointed to the sky. "He was floating in space wanting to return to his own body after a decade of refusing to be in it, but this…" Steven said taking the necklace with the glowing blue stone that refused to be taken off no matter how much Steven tugged. "Slammed into him, cutting him from 'His brooding hour' as you put it and made him fall into this wasteland with a creature made of metal, breaking his leg in the process!" Steven snarled which made the creature take a step back away from him, which made Steven take a sick pleasure in that.
"Tony, darling, there is no one by the name Ty living here." Peggy said taking a seat near him and pulling him into her embrace which caused Tony to let out a choked sob, hiding his face in Peggy's neck as he tried to stop his shaking.
"What are you thinking of, sweetheart?" Steve's voice snapped Tony out of his daze, causing the Omega to blink his eyes and turn to the Alpha with a smile when he saw Steve coming with their breakfast. It was a few more seconds before Steve was sitting with him on the bed, the tray loaded with their delicious breakfast balance carefully on his lab, as he started feeding Tony, making the Omega purr and lean on his Alpha's side.
Pale white form, pale blond hair that almost looked white, tall and muscled body, so different from the photo Tony saw of Steven Rogers, the thin and short boy who was ninety-pound soaked wet. What made Tony freeze in his place though were the dark blue eyes when they finally fell on him, causing Tony's body to tense as the fight or flight instincts start warring inside him; demanding that Tony is to run.
"Always the trouble maker aren't you?" Peggy asked which got her a soft smile from Steven, making the woman feel a little warm on the inside… she wished that Steve will be able to smile like that one day, because ever since Barnes' death or what looked like his death, the Alpha was a few short steps from being called mentally unstable, she wondered what he will do when he learn about Bucky being alive, and she wondered why Steven didn't tell him. "Why didn't you tell Steve that…?" Peggy wasn't able to continue because she was cut by Steven's tired sight.
"Surprisingly, no one; the King was fortunate to react fast and kill the bear." The woman offered which cause Nicolaus to let out a relieved sigh, and even Steven managed to hide the relieved smile nearly taking over his face; for once the king was smart and managed to stop the inevitable. "I heard that Tyber pushed The King toward the bear…" Nattalegg whispered in a low voice as she came to stand near Nicolaus, her words gained nothing but a harsh frown from the Alpha.
"So what, you are telling me that he can see the future? A lot of people can see the future, he is not a special snow flack, Thor, he is just a normal, crazy bastard like all other people out there." Tony walked to Steven, frowning when his eyes fell on the man's face that was scrunched with pain.
… a strong grip for a body that was failing its owner, the Omega looked at him for a little while then blinked… "Please… save h-him…" Before Steve was able to reassure the Omega, the grip on his suit slack and Omega passed out, Steve could hear the screams from outside of the cell, but if Steve tilts his head to the side… there was no singing... for the first time in six years…
"What the fuck is your problem?" Screamed Tony as he turns to Howard, making the man growl at him.
"I was pregnant…" Angie whispered, her words freezing Tony, causing his breath to hitch. "One day, one day he took it too far that no painkillers could do the trick. I was bleeding heavily and when he finally took me to the hospital, I was informed that I had a miscarriage… I didn't even know I was pregnant, you know?" Angie took a shuddered breath and Tony, couldn't help but tighten his arms around his sleeping baby, his mind couldn't help but give him the horrifying image of him losing his baby the day his father beat him black and blue. "It was then that I decided that enough was enough and ran away, I don't know how, but I ended up here one day. Let me tell you something though, the town's people were still as foolish as they were back then, never telling anyone about Steven Rogers unless they had to; unlike you though, back then I didn't have it in me to play around and fool everyone while doing my research behind their backs, I went straight to Peggy and called her on her bullshit when Rogers killed my husband when he found me…" Angie stood in front of him, causing Tony to swallow as he tried to make sense of what Angie just told him. "You know, maybe –this is my theory- the town's people just wanted to forget that Rogers ever exist; I think they felt guilty for being the reason of his death as many didn't believe him when he accused Pierce of killing Peggy's sister, it was only after his death that people realized the grave mistake they made, and for them, protecting Rogers's existence is their way of asking for his forgiveness." These words made Tony swallow and look at Angie who turned around and start making tea.
Tony couldn't help but whimper at the soft lips and gentle hands that set to take him apart, claiming him with every gentle kiss and soft caress. "Please, don't leave me waiting anymore…" Tony whimpered, deepen his voice a little as he tried to intimate Steve, who was still worshiping his body without stopping, even after taking his suit off, leaving him in nothing.
"Thank you, Buck; then I will be in my room if you needed me…" Steve said, trying to give Bucky a cheerful smile and hoping it wasn't a grimace like Steve felt it was. It was pointless to get mad at Bucky when the poor man wasn't the reason for Steve's anger; it was also pointless to be angry at Tony for trying to make sure they are going to be alright after yesterday… Steve just miss Tony, he missed his husband so much, it wasn't fair that Tony was absent at the most important time of their life, it wasn't fair; Tony did tell him though, SI came before everything, but Steve didn't believe that SI will come before his own family and unborn child.
"What the fuck is that Tony?" Barnes squeaked as he eyed the room with disbelieving eyes, turning to the short man with a murderous look on his face. "How could you do this? It's horrible! It's bloody! And no decent human can even live here! It's… it's…" Barnes lost his ability to talk but the glare on his face promised Tony death, and maybe Tony shouldn't have tempted fate, especially when it was going against Captain America.
"Tony…" Bruce's tired voice made Tony jump from his chair, rushing to his friend hoping that he will have good news that will be a cold palm to him already broken heart; Tony wanted to scream and shout, and order Bruce to tell him what happened, why did they take so long when a stab wound can be treated faster than this?
"Why… how… what… how did you get inside of the labs? J why is he inside?" Tony growled gazing at the ceiling with a dark look on his face, daring his A.I. to try and lie to him, giving him a half assist excuse as to why the person he doesn't want to see for the unforeseeable future is in his workshop, looking at him with a bored look on his face.
"I am sorry…" Tony heard those words after he arranged Peter on the small cot he had in his workshop, the words made him stumble for a second but he regains himself and turns his sight toward Steven who was crossing his arms, looking away from Tony and Peter with an uncomfortable look on his face.
"Friend Steven... uh, right…?" Thor asked which made Steve turn toward the thunder God and give him a small confused smile, did Thor died after Steve? Steve wasn't sure, but if he remembered right Thor's sister was the God who ruled the dead. "What business you have in this realm, my friend?" Thor asked as he took a step toward Steve but stopped not knowing if he should advance or stop where he was.
"Do you even have any idea what you did?" Tony hissed, gazing at Steve who was nodding his head like a happy puppy, which caused Tony to groan; it seems like he forgets who he was talking to. A crazy Addams who get turn on by terrorizing people. "Why do you always do this? What can I give you for you to stop terrorizing me?" Tony whined, growling as he went to the huge bed in the middle of the room; ignoring the scream coming from under the bed when he threw himself at it. He didn't even flinch at the moaning he hears coming from under the bed nor he was startled when the bed moved up and down trying to throw him overboard; it seems that it is official, he got used to the crazy Addams that he wasn't startled by his creepy self anymore.
Tony hummed to himself as he finally finished tidying the living room, and the doorbell ringing made him jump and rush toward the door, he pauses a little to tidy himself and ruffle his hair a little, then he stopped when he noticed what he was doing, which made him grumble with a flushed face and look throw the peephole, smiling when he saw that it was Steve and Peter, which caused him to open the door the smile still painted his face. "Good morning, Steve, bambino…" Tony said as he opened the door, getting a small smile from Steve and wave from Peter who was carried in his father's arms, yawning a little as he hides his face in his father's neck.
The cruel smile that took over the king's face made everyone's breath hitch, even Loki and Thor, the fierce warriors became as quiet as mice as they waited for the punishment that will befall Hamar. "A slave you say?" The humor in the Alpha's voice, scared even the strongest warrior there was, one thing was known in every place in their world, the Iron King was a volatile entity, one second he could be your best friend, smiling, joking, showering you with gifts, the next he will turn into your worst nightmare as he stabs you in the heart; he wasn't called the Merchant of Death for nothing. "Then do tell, Hamar, did you see the marks of a slave on the Omega?" Starkad cooed, his words made everyone still as their eyes widen even more if that was possible, even the advisors and the king's friends, they weren't immune to the shock.
After a year, Howard showed his face in SI, Steve saw Stane's face for the last time… a face full of hate and want for revenge… it made Steve uneasy… that night someone attacked Angie, she was able to escape thanks to Peggy teaching her self-defense, though she got half of her hair cut? and injured her arm, everyone was glad she was fine, her complaining about her beautiful hair being all gone made them laugh in disbelieve, but happiness at the same time.
Clint was finally reunited with his family, and he was the happiest person Steve saw, he and his wife ends up having another child, a little girl they named Natasha, to honor their dead friend that sacrificed herself, Clint still live in the farm, with his children and grandchildren visiting him, Laura (God rest her soul in peace) had passed away ten years ago. Steve has never been as proud as when Clint told him he was opening an orphanage to help children with superpowers abilities. Sometimes Steve will drop for a little chat now and then, these days they mostly talk about the past, Steve never mentioned to his friend how tired he looked, how old he looked day after day if Steve was right, his friend was going to be ninety in few months.
Even when his baby's first birthday comes and goes, and the only thing Tony could give was a name, a kiss on the forehead and silly stories of Captain America… a hero that long since died, a hero that he hoped his son will be like when he grows up… if he grows up… his baby was a genius, so smart and bright, he doesn't deserve to be locked down here like an animal. That night he put his baby in the bathroom he told him to close his eyes and put his hands on his ears or the monster will come… he did.
The reason Tony finally gathering the courage to return to his home was the fact that Peggy Carter was thrown into an asylum for being mentally unstable and insane. After the woman was locked behind the bars, Tony gained the courage to return to his beloved home and see how his place fared in the loving hands of his friends and family.
Finally, the second chapter is here!
"No answer? Is that it? Are you going to pretend that you are not here, Mr. Stark? Well then, that suits me just fine…" Carter stated and Tony had to hold into his screams when he heard a few gunshots from the other side of the door. The gunshot wasn't that loud to warrant someone outside the house to come and investigate the noise, especially not with a suppressor, but to Tony, they were so loud that part of him wondered how his heart continued to beat without it failing him.

Steve hummed as he saw the Bifrost open and pull Thor to Asgard, leaving Steve behind in the presence of the Avengers. "What a strange goodbye…" Natasha asked with a sly smile, her smile not reaching her eyes that were watching him like a hawk watching its prey.
Tony shook his head with a smile, waving to the too before he stopped by the lake, and against his better judgment he stared out at the still waters and the insects skimming over the surface. "I'm not going anywhere…" Tony called out to the silent depths. "I got no place else to go." Tony felt foolish, talking to the lake like it was a person, but Bucky's warning still rang in his head making him square his shoulders, Tony shoved his hands into his pockets, kicking his heels against the deck.
" Steven asked, tilting his head to the side when Tony let out a small chuckle, a frown taking over his face.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluff, a little bit of violence, ghosts, horror elements, poor Tony! All reviews are appreciated...
The voice was gentle when he said that making Sam hum a little. "The worse…" He muttered tiredly after he went inside his office to close the door behind him.
"Baby, Mama really need to go, I promise I will be back in a little while, Papa will be with you all the time, he won't let anything bad happen." Tony whispered gently which made the pup sniffle at that and whimper. "Please baby, can you be a little hero and stay strong for me?" Tony said as he leans back to look at Peter's face, the pup was sniffing and tearing up, but he nodded his head clutching his toy tightly when Tony gave it to the pup. "That's my strong baby." Tony whispered after wiping the tears away causing Peter to sniff at that. Tony stood up then and raised his son in his arms, entering the room that has toys scattered on the floor, drawings pinned to the walls, and small chairs and rounded desks around the place, it made Tony hold his pup a little bit tighter as he reached Steve who instructs all the pups to sit down, so they will start drawing and coloring. "Rogers." Tony said which made the Alpha turn to Tony who was glaring at him. "Take care of Peter, and if anything happens to him it's your head." The Omega hissed in the Alpha's ear, after putting the pup down which made Steve nod his head and gently steer Peter to introduce him to the other children.
Some days Steve and Tony were content with going around the village the villa located in, taking the locals' life and enjoying their time. Steve thought, the art lunatic he was, planned on going to every museum in Italy before their honeymoon was over, it was thankful for Tony and his vast 'efforts' that the Alpha spent his time home resting, doing important things… things like making Tony sings and moan until their breath left them; but details, details…
"F… Fuck you…" Steve hissed, finally managing to gather himself enough to knee Bucky in the crutch, ignoring the pained shout the man let as he untangled himself from the Alpha's arms; and as fast as he can with his pregnant belly, Steve rushed out of the room, snatching the room keys and locking the door behind him, hoping that he would manage to make enough time for his escape. They were on the second floor, and unless Bucky wanted to break the sturdy door, his only escape was to jump from the window and risk breaking his legs.
"Why don't we just stop running around the bush, OK?" Tony stated, putting his cup of coffee down and gaze at his friends who were sending him concerned looks, which made Tony hate himself a little. "You are thinking that my house is haunted by a ghost and wanted to take me and Morgan away from here, isn't it? I mean sure, everyone talked about the place being haunted, but until now, nothing happened." Nothing bad happened anyway, nothing that going to the lake hadn't fixed yet; maybe the monster was a little angry at Tony because the man ignored him the past month or so since he had Morgan? Maybe Tony should leave an offering to placate the monster? Maybe Tony and the monster can reach an agreement?
But never once in Tony's life, was he prepared for what he saw… where he was expecting to see bunches of rocks and stardust, there was a man who was passing out… a handsome man... but a man nonetheless, a man with blond hair and was wearing blue, red, and white robes like they were in some type of fairy tale and he was a king or a knight or something… most likely a knight prince, because damn! Did you see those biceps?
(See the end of the chapter for
One thing Sarah Rogers didn't believe she will ever see in her life was her grandson talking and interacting with Omegas without him screaming and crying out in fear, a problem that the cause of was the pup's insane mother, and Sarah being a nurse prepared herself for her son and grandson distrust of Omegas, one failed mating was enough to shatter her son's low self-esteem of himself while destroying his pup's mentality.
What nearly made Tony scramble out and run for it, was when he saw that Steve had taken him to the cemetery, which was a no-no zoon that Tony never entered since that terrifying night fourteen years ago when he nearly died on the spot when he witnessed what should have not happened. "Steve, let's go back home… please!" Tony squeaked and latched tightly into Steve's arm when a crow flew past him and gave a deafening in his ear.
"Please, go to your room…" Steve breathed out as he tried to calm himself, not wanted to do something that he will regret later and it seems that the pup understood how big the situation was, as he rushed out of the room, running toward his and slamming the door shut, leaving the adults alone in the ruined room.
"What can you tell me about the Infinity Stones in this universe?" Steven asked as he sat in the chair across from Loki's, it usually annoyed Steven that everyone always decided to tag with Steven when he wanted to talk with Loki, and he knows that the man himself was feeling annoyed too, today they were sitting in the tea room, because Loki wanted no one in his room, and he can't really fault the man, the last three times Steven was in the man's room, he ended up snapping at Thor and Clint who made a mess of the whole room.
The fight was about to turn into a brawl if the engine wasn't destroyed…it ends up with the team fighting the aliens in Manhattan, getting half of the city destroyed in their offer to stop the invasion. And they were about to succeed in closing the portal… that was until the missile was lunch on Manhattan, in the end, Tony decided to do it and direct the missile to the portal. "That's a one-way trip, Tony…" Aunt Peggy told him with a broken voice, it just made Tony bit his lips and told JARVIS to put the thrusters on 100% capacity.
"Hey, Tony…" Steve muttered shyly, a soft smile taking over his face as went inside the office closing the door behind him, taking in Tony who gave him a tired smile. God, it has been such a long time since the two of them were together in the same room. "I read the note you left for me… did you mean what you said?" Steve's voice trembled as he asked the question that had been running inside his mind since he found that letter; Steve know it was silly being hung up on a stupid pickup line, but it was their line.
It was calm, too calm; not that it mattered to the creature, for he was starting to get annoyed with the boat that dared to enter his water and disturb his calm, no one is welcomed to enter his water. Breaking the surface, the creature blinked his eyes, tilting his head to the side when he recognizes the person on the boat; the boy who dared and called him a bully.
Dun, dun, dun, DUN!
"You are giving up your freedom, for them?" The king asked slowly like he could not believe what his ears were hearing, and maybe he did not, after all, one of his people, was protecting the Hydra's, it made the king rage at that. "You are giving your freedom, for people who always call us barbarians, who attacked our people, killed our men and woman, raped our Omegas, and tortured our children before killing them,
Steve was silent as he took Tony in, almost making Tony shiver and run away, unfortunately, his legs refused to move; a few moments later Steve let out a sigh and stood up, walking toward Tony and helping him stand on his shaky legs. "I'm sorry,
But it seemed he was already late and that Steven had gone after Rogers in the end, because when he finally found them it was due to his aunt snapping at them both to stop fighting; when he finally arrived at the place the two of them seemed to have taken as their arena, he winced when he saw Steven pounding his fists into Rogers face who was growling and trying to dodge Steven, but it wasn't working, Steven was not only slightly bigger than Rogers, he was more experienced than him, and with the knowledge of fifty years of fighting and strategy.
"Oh, God…" Tony's voice cracked as he said those two words, hiding his face in the Alpha's chest, hiding the tears away from the man, and he was thankful that Steve didn't mention the wet spot that started growing on his shirt. He could already imagine how the four years old Peter might have been terrified, crying out and thrashing as he called out for Steve to save him.
The sound of the babe crying in pain made the Omega froze and turn around to see the small pup who stood for him cry on the floor as someone stepped on his hand, which made the Omega snarl and rushed at the man, all finesse in fight forgotten in the quest of getting that monster off the pup when he was able to push the man to the ground, the bastard had the gall to grin, something that would have made Steven snarl if it wasn't for the sudden pain that bloom in his stomach making Steven gasp and freeze.
Tony went over to the kitchen while Mrs. Carter circled the lounge, picking up pieces of furniture and looking despondent, the oven seemed to be working when Tony checked it and there are a couple of cabinets still standing; the ones that had been attached to the wall torn off, leaving screws and fragments of chipboard standing out sharply from the pine slats. The tall barstools that were arranged around the breakfast bar in the photos are lying on the floor; their hollow metal legs twisted up like paperclips, making Tony take a deep breath at that.
