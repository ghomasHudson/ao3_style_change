“No time,” Steve informs him, walking toward the desk drawer where he saw Tony deposit the invisibility cloak hours before. “Tell me where you’re at, and I’ll come get you. And, uh, Rhodey?”
Tony beckons to one of the baskets, and it floats closer to him. He plucks it from the air, and, rooting around in the breadsticks, he pulls out the purple unicorn.
“Everything’s fine,” he argues, sitting back down, seemingly done causing a ruckus after having embarrassed his son in front of all the surrounding tables. “Can we get some more pop and breadsticks already?
Steve takes a deep breath, and glances back at Tony, who is currently wearing a version of his Planning Face.
He racks his brain trying to think of someone, besides Tony, whom he can call that isn’t magical, that he can also trust. Someone who won’t be overwhelmed by the situation.
be one… But that didn’t stop him, you know? He found a way. I don’t know if that’s what it was like for you, really, but… he made me not want to quit, made me think I could make a real difference. He made me who I am. That’s why I’m doing this,” Tony cocks his head to the side, indicating the armor.
A cheer goes up in the viewing room. Dr. Prentiss, standing closest to the panel of transparent aluminum, releases a held breath and laughs softly. Even Dr. Nu'val, the researcher and designated cetacean interpreter standing next to her, cracks the tiniest of smirks—pretty much the Vulcan equivalent of punching the air.
“You’re… not a wizard,” Steve confirms. Steve has gone back and forth so many times trying to figure out whether Tony is a magic user or not that he feels a bit dizzy.
The man coughs and raises his hand a little higher; Steve suddenly realises he’s been staring, unmoving and silent, while the man has been waiting with his hand out in greeting.
The rush of excitement Steve feels reading Tony’s words—particularly the familiar greeting—is tempered by the nausea he feels at discovering the solution to the cipher.
Damn, Steve had been hoping to go on the biology tour. It would probably be all… oh, what are they called? Microorganisms? But at least it was something
badly to show Tony his world—to thank Tony for all that he’s shown Steve, and give Tony something special in return.
“Yes,” Steve says, trying to be calm, wondering what’s going to happen in a minute, and how much more ‘real’ the situation could possibly get.
“I have no idea,” Tony tells him, getting the general idea of Steve’s question, and apparently having no better answer. He shakes his head, baffled. “Uh.
Neither Steve nor Tony looks away from the mammoth creatures directly in front of them. But Tony reaches out two exploratory fingers in the general direction of Steve's hands. Steve clasps his whole hand in response.
Steve excuses himself as he pushes his way through the crowd, still hot on the figure's heels, following them to... the entrance of a soaring nomaj tower. A hotel, Steve thinks, as he shoves through the revolving door.
Tony knows maybe more than most about appreciating colossal things. (He chuckles silently to himself: he's not even making a dirty joke about Steve being, ahem, well-endowed for once.) Glimpsing a starship—
Steve lowers his mop over the landing pad, and hops down without breaking his stride. He throws the cleaning implement aside and draws his wand once more, pointing it at Tony's back as the roboticist—no, rogue wizard—makes his way into the lab. His scowl is all bravado; he hopes he looks far more confident than he his.
From their barnacled lower jaws to their scarred flanks, their striated underbellies to their swooping tails, the whales are completely unfamiliar to him. He would never, could never, design something like them. But their majesty is undeniable: the rocky contours of their fins like snowcapped mountains, the eponymous arcs of their backs like a rising sun. They are perfectly imperfect.
Before Steve can risk another painful laugh, the popping sound of wizards apparating fills the room, and suddenly, half of the Auror’s Bureau surrounds them.
There's a smattering of applause and a few whoops of joy, but most of the attendees, Tony and Steve among them, are quietly watching, eyes wide.
Steve uses his fingers to push the picture around. It can't be more than simple luck, he thinks, until he pans to the left and sees... Bucky.
Steve sighs and drags his eyes up from the plain white tablecloth to look at Tony. Tony, who probably thinks Steve is the biggest idiot he's ever met. Tony, who'll probably never speak to him apart from business details again. Tony, who...
"What's the little one's name?" Tony gestures at the massiveness of the ocean before them. "Little, relatively speaking."
Tony looks like he's biting the inside of his cheek so hard that it's causing him physical pain, probably in order to stifle another series of chuckles.
They're both kneeling facing the end of the bed, nestled together, Steve's front to Tony's back, as if spooning. Steve holds Tony upright, one hand curled possessively around Tony's hip, the other across Tony's chest. Tony's back arches in pleasure, his head lolling back onto Steve's shoulder now and then.
Steve's still caught up in his thoughts of the whales, it looks like. Good. Tony nods mildly and takes a deep breath. He's good at redirection. No need to bring the mood down. Not tonight.
They reach the intersection of Broadway and 44th, and Steve feels a tug on his sleeve; Tony stops walking, and, using Steve's own momentum, yanks Steve back to him, twirling Steve to face him.
The left corner of Tony’s mouth curls downward. “Bad name? Okay, okay, it’s a work in progress. But whatever we’re called, they’re…my friends. They’re all sort of magical outcasts. Like me.”
But what he says, leaning back against Steve even further, is: "Do you ever think about... uh... starting a... a 'pod'? You and me?"
Tony walks U over to his desk, and sets her down on a crumpled up sweatshirt. "Our, uh, groundskeeper in Scotland. I... may have fibbed before and said he was my uncle. The one who liked tea? He's a little... unusual."
The nightmares are all but gone now, and the therapist he started seeing last year has truly helped him more than he thought possible, but sometimes he still has to perform a little mental gymnastics to keep his mind eye's from winding through imaginary cave systems and seeing the glint of battery leads in the darkness. Especially at moments like this.
Grasping at the base of Tony's shaft and gently angling it away from his body, Steve fits the open end of the stroker just over the tip of Tony's cockhead... and stops. Tony gasps: the lube is cold, sending a chill up his spine, and the slick, tight contact is amazing, but not nearly enough. He supposes there's a single solution to both those problems. The engineering portion of his brain, if it were even remotely functional right now, would like the efficiency of that.
And it might be made of metal the same as Doom's armor, but that's about all the two have in common. Seeing the it now, Steve can't imagine how he had ever confused the two.
"TO ME, MY BREADSTICKS!" he calls, with enough volume and intensity for enough for their server to overhear. "ALA-KAZAM!"
Once they can move again, they clean up and then immediately house two replicated cheese plates and an order of actual earth grown grapes from a farm just inland, in San Joaquin Valley (Steve swears he can taste the difference; he probably can).
“You ready?” Steve twists awkwardly behind him, doing a final check with Rhodes before they make their way into Doom’s chamber.
“C’MON, STEVENS,” Tony yells from down the hall, “TIME WAITS FOR NO GOVERNMENT LACKEY, EVEN A VERY PRETTY ONE!”
Steve shuffles slightly. He hasn’t gotten the best sleep since his, uh, de-statue-fication, that’s true. “A bit.”
"Is this what you want?" Steve asks almost distantly, as if he wasn't pounding away at Tony's asshole.
Tony is wearing a more casual style of button down today, opened to reveal the heather gray A-shirt underneath; it hugs his lean body in a  completely different way than his carefully tailored business casual outfits usually do. Steve’s mouth goes dry, and he has to tear his eyes away from the hint of Tony’s bare arms peeping out from the shirt seam—he has to focus enough to get through the invitation first.
Dr. Prentiss calls to Steve over her shoulder, exclaiming that the pleasure was all hers, and jog-walks up to the podium that's been setup for her near one of the centermost observation panes.
was what DUM-E’s motion had reminded him of on the first day he met Tony. And presumably, that explained the movement he saw in Tony’s lab that he couldn’t account for—the occamy making an appearance, and then shrinking down to a size too small to be seen.
have trusted the recommendation he got from Dane Whitman in the Mounted Auror's Unit. Never, ever, ever. A guy with a winged horse could make anything sound cool, couldn't he? Had he been
And when Tony sums it all up with what he wants to use all that tech for—to change the world, to save lives, to make things better for everyone—Steve has to squash the impulse to rush over to Tony and kiss him every time.
The creature ruffles then refolds its wing. Its body is snakelike, and its face is that of a bird's. Both its scales and feathers have an absolutely beautiful iridescent gleam to them.
“G’night, Tony,” he mumbles, and the last thing he remembers before letting sleep embrace him is the pillow shaking with Steve’s laughter.
According to the notes, it happened the previous night in Highbridge. Not terribly far from Sam’s apartment. Steve considers stopping by in a few days; hopefully Sam will be feeling better and the initial official investigation will be over.
He finally looks away from the character's bright clothing to see his face. He's struck by how much it looks like, well,
Tony goes on about his friends, and Steve can barely process what he’s hearing. He had no idea Tony had been working on the investigation with other people. He doesn’t know why it surprises him so much, that Tony would have friends—other magical friends at that—but he can’t shake the surge of jealousy spiking within him. He thought what he had Tony had was special, unique.
"You've known me for all of three weeks. And I acted fishy—I admit, the flying breadsticks were probably a bit much. But I wanted to impress you," he admits. “Plus, hey—” he holds up the garment he was wearing before when he was flying. “Invisibility cloak. Not a normal nomaj thing.” He tucks it into a drawer carefully.
, I think my time in the military might have been a factor, too," Steve adds, hoping he can adlib around that topic more easily than his childhood.
Tony gives Steve a lopsided grin. “Maybe I am. But. Just in case I’m not with you every single second of the day, I wanted you to have something. I was working on a physical one.”
The acrid smell of Fluxweed and Knotgrass reaches Steve’s sensitive nose just after it hits Tony’s, and Steve realizes what he’s seeing.
“Steve,” Steve blurts out too quickly, forgetting his false name. He hangs on the single syllable, trying to recover. “...ens. Roger Stevens. But. Roger is fine.”
“You are perfectly positioned at the intersection of technology and magic, and possess a superior mind, capable of unlocking their combined power. Rogers and I may be from the same time, but he chooses to remain in the past, while I have always looked toward the future.”
. Tony's fucked this up. He's ruined the moment entirely. What an idiot he is, to spring this on Steve, right now of all times—fuck, why on earth did he
Steve checks the time on his phone—seven twenty-five; he’s still early—before swiping his brand new security card at the door to the robotics lab on the 118th floor.
Steve surveys the situation. Rhodey is still struggling to free Tony and Reed, U is badly hurt, and Sam is shaken and unarmed.
Another figure appears in the water, floating out from behind Gracie's immense form: Dr. Nu'val looks like some sort of sea nymph or other mythological being, her all white wet suit and pale skin contrasting the black of her swim fins and her chin length hair, which is currently bobbing in a halo around her face.
"A stone statue?" Scott offers. Bobbi scowls and swats at him. Her hand passes through him. "Sorry," Scott winces.
it, have you?” Tony needles him. “I’m doing this—forming the Avengers—with or without you. Are you going to report me? Am
Steve wraps the arm not holding the stroker tight across Tony’s chest. “I can oblige you, I think,” he husks out, breathing heavily in Tony’s ear, “if you finish first.” He nips at Tony’s neck, hard, then snaps in a quick thrust. “Come on my cock, Stark. Now. I want to feel it.”
Legs sore, cheeks wet, gasping for air, Tony fucks hard into the sleeve in Steve’s fist, once, twice—and oh god, Steve’s massaging one of the beads in the stroker under his head, just how he likes, oh god—and he comes like he’s leaving his body, like he’s leaving the bounds of time and space: warp thirteen, blinding and beautiful.
"I really did." The man's dimples should be outlawed, Tony thinks, then remembers that they actually are, along with the rest of him.
Then the gloves and boots give off that whirring noise again, and Tony bursts upward again, at an astonishing speed. Doing a graceful loop in the air, he sets off south and west, toward Central Park.
," he continues, "When they married, some of the more... old school members of the Wizarding community took it poorly."
He wants to order them both a Starthistle Sling at The Bar With No Doors—and then, after pointing out the picture of the Emerald Warlock above the bar,
The perp has him at a disadvantage; if they're a wizard—and they must be, really; who else would have an invisibility cloak?—they can just apparate away. Unless Steve can get in touching distance of them and follow along, he'll have no idea where they're going. Spells leave a trace, and Steve has the training to follow them, but there are obscuring countercharms; if the person he’s tracking is gone, they’re probably gone for good.
Perhaps, Steve considers, his hostility is more related to wands than the scanners, though—he’s still bitter about losing his bracers. The alder wand he’s been assigned works better than the one he’d had growing up, but it would never be the same—
“Look,” he barrels on, fidgeting with the sheets. “Three years ago, I’d have said anyone spreading rumors about me contemplating offspring was absolutely out of their mind, had had a little too much spring water on Psi 2000, you know? There was no way—
“So, you seemed a little distracted up there,” Tony comments as the elevator whisks them downward. “Tired?”
It's a suit of armor, but it's unlike anything Steve's ever seen. It may well have been inspired by the medieval knights' attire on display at Hogwarts, on some level, drawn from a memory from Tony's childhood. But it's so much sleeker than those must have been, the lines so much cleaner and more precise.
is immediate, enveloping the entire elevator car, and shooting it up to the top floor at an alarming speed.
"Captain Rogers and Commander—" Dr. Prentiss looks to Tony, like his name is on the tip of her tongue.
"He's not always what you'd call, ah, helpful. He can be prickly, unless he hits it off with someone..." Rhodes laughs and waves a hand. "I say that out of love. I don't know if you know this, Roger—I can call you Roger, right?— but I've known Tony for years. He's a friend as well as an employee. I’m glad to see you two are getting along."
Another metallic structure rises just in front of the contraption, a sort of console, or podium, Steve surmises. The pedestal at its top has a depression, a space for some kind of object to rest.
“Good morning, Mrs…” Sam’s eyes track across or desktop, spotting her name plate. “Arbogast. We’re from the—”
“What, bab—” Steve clears his throat, catches himself falling out of character. “What is it, Stark? What do you need?”
As Steve spied earlier, the man has not only metallic boots on, but also silvery grey metallic gauntlets, and a helmet to match, covering his face.
A sound suddenly cuts through the room. The notes of it—for a very loose definition of “notes”—arc and bend in pitch wildly, unmusical but somehow still beautiful. Long, low reverberant bass sounds, punctuated by high metallic squeaks and cries. The overall effect is alien, haunting.
A panel on the side wall of her stand slides back, revealing a hidden space full of merchandise not for nomaj eyes; the images on the front page of the paper move with a soothing familiarity.
“Who’s going on a date?” a new voice joins the conversation. Footsteps echo in the cafeteria, as a woman with bright green hair, wearing matching sunglasses and a black trenchrobe tied with a sash, crosses to their table.
Treading as cautiously as possible, Steve makes his way to the center of what was once a room. There are runes scratched in the concrete, just like the most recent report said.
Scars and burn marks bubble up on the skin of Reed's face as he and Doom simultaneously writhe in pain. Finally, they both go still.
The next few moments feel a little like coming back into the airlock after a space walk, like gravity's just returned.
Doom crosses to the corner where Sam is captured. Sam begins struggling anew, but he makes no progress.
Time slows down, almost like it did in the hydra cave all those years ago. But he won’t wake up this time in a world he doesn’t know, and that’s fine, he thinks. Tony wouldn’t be there in the future to greet him, so it’s okay if this is the end.
Oh, god, poor Sam. Steve has talked Sam’s ear off about everything Tony's told him. About the robots protecting nomajs from radiation poisoning in Japan; about farming machinery that’s powered by the energy of the sun; about computer programs that are smart enough to write other computer programs.
Tony nuzzles Steve back, then pulls away, just a few inches; his gaze dips, and his voice is quiet when he speaks again.
“You deny it, but you know it to be true,” Doom argues vehemently. He pauses, seemingly calming himself, easing his grip on Tony’s face, sliding his fingers down Tony’s chin. When he speaks again, his tone is lighter, almost seductive.
It’s vague, sure, but it seems to vindicate Steve suspicions: the killer is using obscurials, or something very like them—how else would you turn a wizard into a weapon?
Tony’s hand is warm—not too warm, as usual; just perfect—and his pulse is lively under Steve’s fingertips.
Opening his eyes, he comes face to face with the remains of a bombing—the signature silver starburst pattern is even more pronounced this time—it's even more beautiful and horrible than it had appeared in Stoner’s scans.
But whenever Steve catches Tony’s eye, he feels like they’re the only two people in the room—in the world, for that matter. And that, Steve realizes, is its own kind of magic.
Tony feels like he's learning something new about Steve every day they are together. How Steve's left eyebrow hitches up just a bit higher than his right when he's seated in the command chair on the bridge and something mission related hasn't gone to plan, but he doesn't want to jump to conclusions yet. How he takes his coffee (usually black, but occasionally with amounts of sugar that would stagger a normal human). The names of the old timey tunes he sometimes hums in the shower ("I'm Beginning to See the Light" by Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots is a particular favorite). What noises he makes when he's just about come. Tony's begun to memorize every morsel of information about Steve like... well, like Steve memorizes whale facts, and everything else.
An orange rope of light leaps from Steve’s wand, turning the blue metal of the orb neon yellow with a fiery red-orange corona, like a tiny sun. Doom screams and drops the molten metal, but not before it sears the flesh of his hand.
, big guy," Tony wriggles out of Steve's grasp, shoving him away. "Look," he says more calmly, holding up his hands.
He is, frankly, exceedingly lucky he didn’t get splinched on his way here. He wasn’t even sure where he was headed when he left Tony’s lab. He just knew he needed to get away—
Tony stretches out his hand in a curve before him, as if highlighting a newspaper headline. "STARK BOY IS A WUNDERKIND! Surely the next great wizard of our age!"
To his left are glass doors leading to the bar, the only feature on this level, according to the map. It’s currently empty, and several signs seem to indicate that it’s closed for renovations.
Steve sits straight up, trying to look more like one of the Bureau’s top aurors, and less like the nervous, depressed heap he feels like at the moment.
Already carrying a tray of fresh bread baskets, she winds her way toward them, rolling her eyes as she does.
They stop first at the twenty-seventh floor, where the head office for Magical Transit Authority is located, and the dog exits.
Tripping over his green cloak, Doom falls, landing flat on his back. Tony kneels down next to him, and presses a hand down firmly on the Doom’s chest plate.
The “neck” is comprised of different metal pieces, articulated with joints in several places, and it moves fluidly, like a dragon’s, or a crane’s, or even perhaps another creature that Steve can’t quite place at the moment. At the end is a claw attachment, which is currently spinning, as well as opening and closing. It looks like it’s… gesturing?
Tony emerges triumphantly, holding up… a broom. Not some push broom for sweeping the lab floor: a proper racing broom.
Doom is already stalking toward him, the orb held high in one hand, brandishing his wand in the other.
Tony can’t quite bring himself to finish that sentence; he waves his hands, as if to wave away the past. He feels a kiss pressed against his hair.
Steve? Tony's never struck Steve as the cruel type, but he doesn't understand Tony's reaction at all.
“One cold pumpkin juice,” she confirms, pressing a button on the countertop in front of her, “and one Daily Conjurer.”
,” Steve chides him softly, “You’re a flying knight in armor who wants to save the world. What does that sound like to you?”
"A non-magical person born to wizarding parents," Tony explains. "I know what the kids used to call it on the other side of the pond," he adds bitterly, mouth forming a flat line. "What they used to call
,” Tony tells him, snapping his fingers with a flourish—and for some reason, it takes Steve back to his childhood, to old Mr. McDonagh and his newspaper stand, back when magic was
Now the guests of honor are less than a mile out, and it's almost surreal, the idea that this thing that had grown in importance along with their relationship is actually happening.
Sam is doing a credible job not limping; Steve, as usual, doesn’t mention it, and hopes Sam is actually recovering, not just trying to hide his knee injury, which he received about a month ago in the line of duty, apprehending a wizard who had been enchanting billboards in Times Square to hypnotize nomaj tourists. The curse had been a particularly nasty one, leeching poison into the tendon’s of Sam’s left knee, and the weekly application of the countercharm was proving slow in reversing the spell’s effects.
Steve squints. "Sorry, who?" He thinks he met an auror by that name during a conference at the end of last year—a slim man with dark hair and oversized glasses—but Steve had just been turned back from stone a few weeks before, and he hadn’t paid particular attention at the time. "Should I know who that is?"
Did Tony believe he and Steve were so enamored of one another that he could win Steve over to his side? Tony was going to be sorely disappointed if that was the case. Nothing justified hurting other wizards outside of a combat situation—nothing.
Tony looks away toward the windows at the far end of the room. Orange light is creeping farther across the balcony, spilling into the lab as the sun climbs higher.
And then Steve sees it: while Doom is focusing on the containment chamber and starting whatever ritual he’s prepared, Tony looks precisely in Steve’s direction…and winks.
"Okay," Steve nods on a determined exhale, gripping the edge of the table, as if to steady himself. "Okay. Dinner."
“Not a one-of-those either, apparently.” Tony bites his lip. “I seem to be… something else. Maybe something
Tony lowers his head, murmuring, making a show of wrestling with the choice he’s been offered. “If.. if only…”
The room shakes again, and up from the ground a structure begins to rise. A circular metal platform surfaces first. From it, curved panes of glass ascend, reaching up to the room’s ceiling, creating a cylindrical holding cell of some kind. It looks like a fusion of technology and magic, and it crackles with energy, seemingly unstable.
Tony looks up at him searchingly, like he's trying to decide if he can trust Steve with his secrets. Steve had thought it would be the other way around, when the time came.
Tony rests his head against Steve's shoulder again, musing about how he'll have to write a script that leaves comments on all the videos taken of the incident, discrediting it as a hoax.
Rhodes employed hundreds of people, but there were only maybe a dozen he and Sam interacted with regularly. He should go back to RI, see if he could use his system access to get a list—
"Holographic schematic," Tony informs Steve, reaching for the image and physically spinning it around—Steve tries not to gasp as it turns; is this what nomajs are like when they see a spell for the first time?
When Steve was young, he didn't get to go to wizard school. Not everyone did, then—hardly anyone in his neighborhood could afford it. He dreamed of going to the Chicago School for Sorcery, and he knew a few people who went to that one school in Massachusetts, the one that had since been rededicated as the Center for Native Magical Studies.
“I don’t agree with Stoner much,” Sam says, watching their superior walk away, “But I have his back on that. You should have talked to me.” He puts a hand on a Steve’s shoulder, and Steve turns.
"I'm sorry," Tony sighs, not sounding the least bit sorry at all. "You just... you have no idea...how much I would have
The graceful contours of handle catch the light. It’s made of a polished mahogany, sturdy but with some flex, perfect for riding. Toward its end, the handle is wrapped a whiskey colored leather sleeve, perfect for gripping. The bristles are full, wrapped with care, and taper to a graceful elegant point.
“I was actually just going to ask if you would let me have a second chance at picking a better restaurant,” Steve explains, quickly adding, “But I
Thrusting his wand forward viscously, Doom lunges, shouting, sending a beam of sickly green light directly at Rhodes.
Tony lets out a deeply held breath and nods, not trusting himself to say anything in return. Steve leans in and kisses him, first on the forehead, and then fully on the mouth, lingering there.
“Not once. But Reed thinks the traumatic nature of the curse I was hit with might have triggered it. Stress causes mutation in a number of species—usually over the course of millennia. But magic is… you know… special. Maybe it just took that one hit.”
Steve bites his lip to keep from letting out a huge sigh of relief, especially when Tony seems so dissatisfied with that conclusion. Tony has a scientist’s mind; he always wants to dig deeper.
Before Steve can beg Tony’s forgiveness, Tony continues: “I get the sense it’s not your area of expertise, but we’re pretty proud of it. Or,
Steve pauses. He’s already here, and it doesn’t appear anyone else from the Bureau is around at the moment.
Tony feels it immediately: Steve's entire body tenses, wire taught. His mouth drops open, brushing Tony's ear again. He doesn't let Tony go, but he doesn't say anything right away either.
Bobbi shrugs nonchalantly. "So don't bring magic up. You don't have to tell him your life story on the first date. 'I was in a lake in Germany for 70 years' is a little much for anyone to handle, wizard or not. Just... have dinner. See if you click."
He raises his free hand in a fist, exultant, and takes a half step away from the orb, back in Tony’s direction.
"My lovely assistant, ladies and gentleman," Tony says in lieu of 'thank you.' "I'm going to pull a massive tip out of my hat for you later."
The underwater microphone catches some stray bubbles from the breather, but Dr. Nu'val's words are clear enough. "Gracie has indicated that they are all pleased to be here once again."
“HEY!” a familiar voices yells from inside the office door. Tony pops his head out of door frame, leaning out, clearing calling after Richards. Then he spots Steve, and his eyes light up.
He remembers explaining his own origin to disbelieving nomaj soldiers on that mission with Simonson, thinking there was no harm in telling the tale. It made everyone laugh, and boosted morale. The nomajs all had to be obliviated anyway, after the fighting stopped, so why hold back?
Tony points to the girl in red. “That’s Wanda. She is actually a witch. Her powers are unstable—she had a fairly traumatic childhood—but her hex abilities are amazing. That’s her brother, Pietro—and that’s Clint—Jan thinks we should be called the Avengers. Which is a pretty good second choice, I have to admit—"
There is a sea turtle passing by just then, but Tony is pretty sure that’s not what’s caught Steve’s attention. “Hey, what’s up?”
ID. Right. That rectangle of nomaj plastic with the stationary photo of himself printed on it to prove who he is. (As if that could stop someone who was transfigured to look like you.)
“I don’t do magic,” Tony continues, vitriol coming off him in waves, “so I don’t get the privilege of deciding who and who isn’t in your club—”
Steve moans low like he always does when he’s about to come. Tony bears down on him with everything he’s got.
Hell, he could have proposed marriage, and it would have been less surprising to him—to them both. Oh, it would have been dramatic and impromptu, perhaps, but that's not entirely out of character for Tony, if today is a day he's being honest with himself.
"Hmm, the words are still wrong," Tony muses, munching on his breadstick ‘wand.’ "Not the right... incantation, per se. But the effect was good, no?"
There's a stir behind them, and Dr. Nu'val, now outfitted with an underwater breather to go with her wetsuit, is heading upstairs, preparing for her dive and communication session with the whales.
“Yep, that’s it: time for some shut eye,” Steve confirms. He leaves Tony with one more peck on the lips before heading for the bathroom to brush his teeth, taking the lights in the bedroom down to five percent as he goes.
Tony clearly took the time to clean up before their date, and he looks breathtakingly handsome in a dark grey button down and tight-fitting indigo jeans. Steve wasn’t even sure people could look that good without using a glamor of some kind.
Tony spins toward Steve, and without warning, backs him up against the worktable. He pushes himself forward, positioning his body between Steve's legs. Tony leans in, grabbing Steve's jacket lapels, and nuzzles Steve's nose with his own fondly.
"Well, they've miraculously outlived everyone and everything they've known from their own time," he muses. "And you know someone who knows a little about what that feels like." The observation has a playfulness to it, the tone telegraphing to Tony that it's not meant in a melancholy way
"No," Steve protests, but words fail him mid sentence. He shuts his mouth, and draws himself up to his full height, neck and shoulder muscles tensing in anger.
Tony arranges the pillows into something a little more suitable for sleeping, and slides down into the bedding to get cozy, suddenly not even sure he’ll be able to stay awake long enough for Steve to return. Even a year ago, he’d have forced his eyes open to confirm he wouldn’t be sleeping alone. Now, he knows Steve will come back. He knows it.
was what he wanted to share with Tony. Amazing cuisine, a romantic atmosphere... a little piece of the dream of Italy he longed to see for himself.
He’s not sure what he’s supposed to be looking at, until behind the divider attached to the far edge of the desk, a long, snake-like neck rises up and into view.
Sam threatened that if he heard Steve say the word "processor" or "transistor" one more time, he was going set Redwing on him. (Redwing seemed to screech and flap his refusal of this notion, but nonetheless, Steve dialled back his enthusiasm some, thinking it better to be safe than shredded.)
“What the wizard said,” Tony agrees with Sam. “Reed, whatever you’re doing, whatever he’s offered you, it’s not worth it. We can still get out of here, all of us, just wake that guy up, and—”
Doom brings his wand around, and Steve looks him squarely in the eyes, seeing the pure hatred glowing in them.
But the speech isn't—at least, not one of the few words he learned from his mom. And it's not English, either.
As relieved as Steve is that he's not actually facing a hydra, it doesn't explain much of anything, least of all Tony's casual attitude. Doesn't he realize the seriousness of the situation?
A week ago, Doom had tried to kill Tony, and nearly scared the life out of Steve in the process. Tony has seemed completely fine since then, perhaps the first person to walk away from a killing curse since Potter (Steve has been doing some reading in the interim, and yes, he does know who that is now, thank you very much), except no one can seem to explain why it happened.
Doom waves a hand over the orb, it pulses with light; sparks dance over the contraption in response.
He had known an alchemist from Beauxbatons who was part of the French resistance, as well as a Russian broombomber who had gone to Durmstrang; she’d been one of the famous Night Witches.
Scott drifts down to the table, maneuvering into the seat next to Bobbi, a spectral cup of coffee appearing before him with ethereal steam rising from it. He's still wearing his auror's robes, just as he had been back in 1972, when he was killed on the job by a stray curse.
“You see, Tony?” Doom’s holds his hand aloft above the orb. “There’s no one whose skills are better suited to help me complete the extraction device, and no one more deserving of the reward. You’ve always wanted magic for yourself; it can be yours now.”
"Sure," Tony agrees, and the knot in his throat is releasing. He squeezes Steve's hands. "Sounds good."
From the newsstand, he’s off to the corner of Murray and Church, to stop at Englehart’s, which is probably the best nomaj-run bakery in the whole of Manhattan.
Tony holds the briefcase handle with hands, rocking back on his heels once, clearly as reluctant to leave as Steve. "Goodnight," he says finally, turning and heading toward the nearest street corner and hailing a cab.
In a night already full of huge smiles, Tony breaks into an even bigger one. His centuries old secretly illegal boyfriend is the cutest.
“Oh,” Tony chuckles softly. “D-U-M-dash-E. It’s his name.” He points at the shelf bot. “And that’s Tug.”
Tony turns to Steve a second time, and he's looking back now. Smiles of relief (and, okay, plain adoration) are mirrored on one another's faces.
The metal of Doom’s armor goes suddenly dull. His cape lays flat, enchantment nullified. Finally, the glamor dissolves from his face, his scarred countenance returning.
Steve sets the bag containing Sam’s soup on the curb and approaches the building’s facade. He closes his eyes and walks directly at the brick wall, hoping with all his might that he’s right, that this is a warding charm, and that he won’t simply bounce off, knocked back onto the pavement with nothing to show but a bruised forehead.
Tony turns back to Steve, blinking slowly. Finally coming back to himself, he takes in Steve’s condition, and darts to his side.
Steve hadn't actually considered that the person he was chasing was the one behind these explosions—involved perhaps, but probably not the mastermind behind these disturbances. Why would the perpetrator return to the scene of their own crime?
The whales. They're arriving. They're swimming straight toward the observation center, their pectoral fins gently wafting up and down in time with the propulsion of their tails. Even ten meters out, it's starting to become apparent just how massive they are. And yet, they're astonishingly graceful: they look like they're flying.
Through some agreement with Nu'val and Prentiss, the whales begin a slow circle around around the observation center, letting everyone there, no matter their spot in the room, get an up close lateral view of them, and, oh, it's stunning.
“Glad you asked,” Tony answers, eyes aglow. He punches a few more commands into the keyboard, pulling up some figures on the holoscreen next to the armor.
He barely sees U, still no bigger than a billywig, as she darts out of his pocket. Seconds later, he hears the
. It’s a brilliant bit of metafiction incorporating all kinds of Chicago history and traditions, and I highly encourage you to read the whole tag; it’s waaaay waaaay better than what J.K. hastily and largely insensitively threw together for her Wizarding World history in the US.
“No—I meant—” Steve makes a fist, feeling his stomach do a flip flop as he tries to explain himself.
“Oh, good, you’re here,” he greets Steve. He does a double-take, then, raising his eyebrows impossibly high. “Uh,
Tony had looked up from his worktable, shoving aside a hologram schematic to look at Steve head on. "You're really got an interest in these whales, huh?" He bit his lip, squinted. "I just wouldn't have expected it, I guess."
Steve see the muscles of Doom's neck tense. He throws his head back in pain, and as he does, Reed stirs, releasing an anguished cry. Tony twists back and forth helplessly, watching both of them howl.
Turning the orb to stone and shattering it wasn’t enough to render it powerless before. He has to destroy it as completely as possible.
Steve doesn’t really blame her for not remembering him; she’s fresh out of academy training and has met a lot of new people in the past few weeks. And it’s not as though he’s been particularly social as of late, either. Not to mention, not everyone has his unusually precise memory—half the soldiers in his old unit didn’t refer to him as the ‘walking pensieve’ for nothing.
It's Steve's turn to be taken aback. Why can't he believe Steve? It's a lot to take in, sure. But Tony grew up around magic. He has to know how powerful it is, how long lasting its effects can be. Anything is possible. Death is not always the end when it comes to spellcraft and those who wield it. Surely Tony has to know that.
Tony puts up a palm, holding it in front of him like a warning—Steve is reminded of when Tony used his gauntlets on Steve last night at the hotel, except Tony’s hands are bare now.
Steve’s heart skips a beat—has Tony forgiven him? He doesn’t deserve it, not yet—he really has to apologize first—but if Tony wanted to reach out to him first, he certainly wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to make amends.
"You tell me, sir," he demurs, averting his gaze in faux shyness. "You're the ranking officer on deck."
"Roger... listen. Legally, I have to preface this by saying this is not a 'shovel talk', and that I find that kind of a threat of violence morally repugnant, blah, blah, blah.
Doom sheathes his wand in the folds of his folds of his cloak, then extends his hand further into the fabric—it doesn’t so much as ripple as his hand disappears beneath it; perhaps he’s using an extension charm on the garment; Steve shudders to think of what else Doom might be hiding.
Before Steve can be offended, he notices that Tony's pivoted, directing his shout toward the lab door. The tea-making robot, apparently summoned from Tony’s office, rolls out onto the balcony.
He waves a thumb over his shoulder to the hallway leading to the building’s main foyer. “I should take off. Thanks for letting me bend your ear, Scott.”
And he has Tony, too, for that matter, right here in arms. He’s still the amazing, delightful man Steve had a crush on hours ago.
"His name was Howard, like I told you. Howard Stark." Tony lifts his chin the direction of Steve's jacket pocket. "Take out your Tee-Dub." He pulls a face for a moment. "You... have a Tee-Dub, don't you? They told you about those when they de-stone-ified you?"
Light shimmers over Steve as well, dressing Steve in a smart two-piece suit, but he barely notices the change. He can’t tear his eyes away from the business card until Sam begins speaking again.
Steve pulls back from the kiss and stares at Tony in surprise. Tony wears mischievous look, focused entirely on Steve, and then blinks a few times, breaking his concentration.
They approach the old passageway to the subway tunnel, sealed off with concrete by the nomajs decades ago. Steve checks in every direction: there’s no sign of Doom out here, or of anyone for that matter.
"You... what?!" A bark of laughter escapes Tony's open mouth before his hands fly, faster than owls, to cover it. "Seriously? You never heard of the Olive Garden, and you thought... that it was—and you picked the one in
Sam smirks as he opens the door to the meeting room where their morning briefing starts in five minutes.
“Dee-Oh-Dee,” she finishes for him with a smile. “Mister Samuels and Mister Stevens. I’ll let Mister Rhodes know you’ve arrived. If I could just see some ID, I’ll get your access cards and lanyards ready.”
Steve leaps in front of the nomaj, and counters Doom’s curse with a blue bolt of his own. The spell energies clash, each canceling the other out, locked in mid-air.
"No," Steve shakes his head, voice gone taut, expression entirely serious. "Tony, I fought in the war. World War II, I mean. I... I'm..." he shrugs. "I'm Captain America. I guess."
Steve and Tony both turn sharply at the outburst, coming from a balding, middle-aged man stands up at a table nearby. He seems to be railing at a young boy—his son?—whose head is cast downward, taking in the berating words silently with closed eyes.
"—Stark," he provides, pleased he's gotten to the point of remembering his name again. He extends a hand, settles into a smile. "But please, call me Tony."
He approaches to the door to Tony’s office, and is about to use his voice code to unlock the security panel, when the door swings open. Steve smiles, thinking he’ll see one of the bots, but a man with slicked back dark hair storms out, muttering to himself. Steve’s seen him in the hall with Sam a few times, the guy from the Biology department—
“Some urgent baked good-based research?” Steve teases, nodding at the briefcase—and its doughy contents.
Tony's armor is elegant, clearly designed for him and him only, the contours of Tony’s body reflected in the armor’s distinctly lean shape. The helmet, gloves and boots Tony wore earlier are all present, but they suddenly make so much more sense in the context of the full design. It was like having only read the words to a song on paper, and then suddenly hearing it sung aloud for the first time: the boots and gloves were poetry before, but the armor was symphonic.
Steve nearly drops the phone. He had fought against the idea that had been plaguing him since he woke up, but nonetheless, it seems to be true: he isn’t the only survivor from the cave-in.
"Oh," Tony glances upward in thought as the drone hovers back down to his outstretched hand. "No... I mean, I highly doubt it. That guy seemed more like a blowhard than anything. He was pretty embarrassed. I bet he'll mostly just want to forget that this ever happened." Tony pockets the drone and beams at Steve again.
He trails off into a huffing half laugh, like he's composing himself to keep from getting emotional. Steve starts to rise from his seat, and Tony waves a hand, telling him to stop.
It’s a massive effort to merely lift himself up enough to rest on his elbows; he tries to get his feet under him, and can’t quite do it without stumbling.
Tony sits back down, still grinning. "Earlier tonight, you thought I was a wizard pretending to be a muggle for nefarious reasons, using magic disguised as tech. And I thought that was breathtakingly hilarious, because for the first eleven years of my life, I did exactly the opposite. I made science look like magic. Same as with the flying bread tonight." He shrugs. "I think I always knew what I was. I knew I was never..."
An elevator car comes swooping down, and its doors part to reveal a massive bulldog with a sort of... tuning fork protruding from its forehead.
“Sir?” She frowns at the toy, and then at the son, who looks as though he’s trying not to cry. “Is everything okay? The other patrons are—”
“We moved back to the States, I changed my name, hoping maybe the press would lose interest—they did, eventually. Mom used some of her connections to get me into the best technology focused schools. I graduated early from M.I.T.—that’s sort of… Hogwarts for nerds, I guess. Then my folks died, and things got … bad for a while. That’s a story for another day, but… Not long after that, I found Cap. The comic books, I mean. It was just what I needed at the time. And it wasn’t
He’ll have to go on pretending to be Roger Stevens for now. Have to go on seeing Tony at RI, and texting Tony on his nomaj mobile phone, and being humiliated when he doesn’t know what restaurants to go to.
“Anytime,” Scott assures him, with a little wave. “It’s fun to to hear about love lives that aren’t DOA. Happy to be your Ghost Host.”
“I always just thought I was… non-magical. Lacking in magic,” he snaps his fingers, fidgeting, twitching with nervous energy. “But Reed thinks I might be…
He doesn’t see anyone on the lab floor or out on the balcony, and hopes he hasn’t gotten the date wrong—now that RI’s W.A.N.D.D. status has been approved, he doesn’t have to come to the office every day.
Steve half-jogs towards the door, trying to catch up, when he hears a squawk—a distinctly different sound than either of the bots made.
His plan for making the most of his brief time at Hogwarts had been ingenious for a child his age, in Steve’s opinion—which really only proved that Tony’s calling had been engineering all along: he clearly had a gift for planning.
“So, the armor,” Steve asks. “You’re using it in your investigations? What’ve you found so far, about the explosions?”
Steve checks the time on his phone (he’s actually getting sort of used to that motion now); 5:27pm. Hopefully Tony hasn’t left for the day.
When the cab is completely gone from view, Steve starts to meander away from the most populated areas of the square, away from theatregoers and costumed mascots.
his heart all at once. Three years, and the so-called "honeymoon period" of their relationship has showed no signs of stopping, or even slowing down.
It hits Steve, then: if he's the only full-blooded wizard in the Avengers lineup, what will they think of his fighting style? Will he be the odd one out? Or resent him?
Etched in the bottom of the mirror is a logo Steve had never paid much attention to, but focusing on it on it now, he can see what's printed there plainly.
Tony opens his mouth to protest, and yawns a second time, all his energy suddenly just gone. So many emotions, so close to the surface, that’d do the trick. That, and, as Steve said, ‘the other parts’; he’s not a new Academy grad anymore after all.
N-F-C stands for Near Field Communication, he's since learned, and more importantly, the nomaj device he was assigned is a mobile phone. It's a lot like a Two-Way Mirror, only with a battery and whole lot more tiny electronic bits inside, and together they let him get in touch with Tony at any time. He hasn't, of course, but just knowing that he could, just thinking about Tony picking up (why do nomajs say 'pick up'? You answer by pressing the button) and saying "hello?" all expectantly and sweetly sends a shiver up his spine.
“Cererra? You there?” Sam asks. His words echo from the opposite side of the room, about twenty feet from Steve’s location if he had to guess. He sounds half-dead. They’ll have to rush him to Hecate Medical as soon as possible, but he’s alive, and in the meantime all Steve can think is,
But now he wonders if this was what it was like to look in it and watch your dream come true, only to turn around to see nothing at all behind you, realizing the image in the mirror was only an illusion.
Steve understands Rhodey’s desire to get Tony out of here—god, does he ever. But they can’t sacrifice the element of surprise.
The obscurial caused damage on a massive scale, too, also without the tell-tale black smoke and dark scorches of a nomaj bomb.
He positions himself squarely in front the door, blocking the path of anyone that might come through.
Instead of Sam’s gait, Steve focuses on the flecks of stubble on his friend’s jaw, and the dark rings beneath his eyes.
Steve is half-relieved and half-disappointed. (Maybe more than half of the latter, if he’s being honest with himself.)
“We’re not going to cancel each other out and blow each other up, are we?” Steve asks, hoping he doesn’t sound like an idiot for even mentioning it.
“I think they’re experimenting,” Tony offers, flipping through projections of images from each site. “The readings change over time, so that means they aren’t able to replicate the effects consistently. The procedure—whatever it is they’re trying to do—isn’t successful yet. Or at least, not as successful as they would like.”
Redwing glides down, landing on a side table in the hallway adjacent Sam’s bedroom door, but continues to flap frantically. He seems as disturbed by Sam’s absence as Steve.
If you liked that, I'm thinking about writing an epilogue, so feel free to subscribe to the fic to get updates.
The spell goes wide, whizzing past the creature and impacting... Tony, who is holding up one of his gloves defensively. The spell ricochets away ineffectually.
A waiter wanders by, taking their empty glasses, and Tony cozies up to Steve, fitting a hand into the swoop of his lower back.
At the same time, Rhodes un-slings a massive firearm from his back. He settles it on his shoulder, peering through the sight, aiming, and launches a rocket at the dark wizard.
,” Sam responds defensively, reaching inside his coat to access his wand pocket. “Not the same thing. Also, I said you were gonna hate it, remember?”
Hurt as he is already is, Steve is the only one left. He can’t let that monster escape again. He’s going to finish this, here and now, but he needs to get the others to safety first.
at how well he and Tony work together. He leans in, giving Tony a quick, tender peck on the lips, and lets his cheek rest against Tony’s.
“Unfortunately, I still have no idea what caused it,” Tony sums up his findings glumly, banishing the pictures and other files from the holoscreen with a wave of his hand. “I’ve never seen this kind of magic before.”
But Steve was always good at tracking during the war. Maybe, if he could get some basic intel on the case, he could have a look for himself, see if he could help any.
The figure—a man of slight but muscular build, in a tight, black long-sleeved shirt and jeans, specifically—stops running. Both, Steve assumes, because he's been revealed, but also because he has nowhere to go, except perhaps several hundred feet down. He doesn’t have a broom or a wand as far as Steve can see, and if he was going to disapparate, he would have done it already.
,” Tony punches the name again, “is going to kick your sorry ass all the way back to the forties, even without a Time Turner—”
Steve tries to call out to them, to tell them to go, but can’t seem to get the air to his lungs fast enough; the pain is just too much. Rhodes is pulling Tony along already. They’re going to make it out;
Heading down the street, brown paper deli bag in hand, Steve prepares to disapparate, about to head home, when he catches a flicker of light out of the corner of his eye.
His lingering hurt and frustration from his argument with Tony is dissipating as seconds tick by in between his knock attempts.
Without looking away, Tony raises a hand and snaps his fingers with another stylish flair, and all the baskets fall to the floor at once.
“All my life I have pushed the conventional bounds of magic,” he boasts, voice crisp and clear, no longer hindered by the mask, “and have been shunned for it. We are outcasts, you and I. I, too, stand apart from rest of the so-called community. I respect your mind, your gifts. In fact, I want to offer you another one."
That meant someone knew who where he lived was responsible for his disappearance, had maybe even caused this sickness, had been drugging him.
"Sarah." Steve sips. "After Sarah Cooper. They kept the legendary comedians theme going, although twenty-first century this time."
Tony waggles his eyebrows, then slips his own hand under Steve's and retrieves the object, holding it up between their bodies.
“—you’re stuck with me, I’m afraid. So, I’m second choice, huh?” a voice asks playfully from behind Steve, and Steve turns to see whom he’s offended now.
He swipes back to to the Captain. The character has a shield, he notices now—it appears to be an actual object, though, unlike Steve's spellshield. It's completely opaque, and also painted in red, white, and blue—it’s a little much, Steve thinks, and would have made quite the target in combat—but that's definitely meant to be his shield.
“Tony!” he shouts, starting to stand all the way up. If there was more light in the room, their feet would be exposed.
. And, lastly, it’s volatile when it meets up with matter—they cancel each other out, and leave pure energy behind.
“Evening: Kyle, Kyle’s Loud Father,” Tony greets them pleasantly, just as Angela is bringing their requested soda and breadsticks.
His colleagues who were officially assigned to the case had cleaned up the previous sites straight away; the fact that they had left the crime scene, and the evidence contained therein, remain as-is was telling—were they having trouble finding additional leads?
Maybe it's better than Tony being embarrassed and storming out in a huff. Steve still wants to crawl under the table, apparate away, and never show his face in public again.
“But all that said, I still don’t think... I want to have kids.” He sighs for what feels like maybe the fiftieth time in five minutes, then gets mad at himself for sighing. “You make me feel like I could, like
Steve spares a momentary glance to his left. U is now over sixty feet long, her massive undulating body curling up around the containment chamber. She tightens her grasp, squeezing for all she’s worth.
If he learned anything from his seventy years as a stone statue, it’s that it’s not just himself it might get killed if he runs off half-cocked and without backup.
Before he can stop himself from reacting, Steve's cheerful expression falls away. He feels like he's been hit in the guts with a bludger.
Simonson was a nomaj private he'd fought alongside in France. Simonson would draw little doodles—he and Steve had an artistic bent in common—and Steve would bring both their sketches to life with simple spells.
Tony shakes his head again. "Not really. I mean, I read the Conjurer, I keep up with big events—especially stuff like this explosion business. But if you mean, do I hang out with people who remind me of what I can never be?" he sips his coffee. "No, not on the regular."
“I... don’t have the shield anymore. If that influences your decision at all,” Steve says, attempting a casual tone of voice.
Sam is still feeling ill, apparently, so Steve is left to wrangle RI staff on his own. He’s swarmed by Supplier Quality Engineers asking about specifications, as well as IT staff probing him with questions about network connections and data integrations. He tries his best to answer, following the scripts MACUSA provided him, and asks all the correct questions in return to confirm that RI can produce wand scanners and the other magi-tech they’re interested in.
Dr. Prentiss launches into an introductory speech, with some basic facts about the whales and how they came to be here.
Steve racks his brain as he sips his tea. He can't think of any important figures in the wizarding community with the last name Cerrera, either in wand manufacturing, or government services, or even entertainment for that matter. But then again, he hasn't been in the twenty-first century for very long. He was gathering moss at the bottom of a lake when Tony's dad was a young man, so it's not like Steve has the most extensive frame of reference.
If Tony was a wizard… Merlin’s beard, it would be everything Steve had ever dreamed of. He could be himself around Tony. They could even
Tony walks around to stand beside Steve as he inspects the image. "Yeah," he agrees. "You and he kinda look the same. I noticed that, too. I, uh," he crooks an eyebrow, hesitating. "I might have a type."
“I hated this job, anyway,” she tosses back over her shoulder, smiling as she makes her way to the other tables she’s serving, cards and cash tucked into her apron.
Laleh retrieves Steve's items with a smile and hands them to him; he pays in galleons, and she doesn’t comment on his penchant for the print version of the periodical, or his use of cash; they’ve had that conversation many times already.
They say nothing to each other, simply strolling quickly and holding hands, wearing matching expressions that resemble the kneazle who got the cream.
Steve cautiously steps into the room. There’s a desk, scattered with papers, hand tools, and a few models cars and other personal knick-knacks.
Steve inhales, buying himself some time. He’d thought quite a lot about how to tell Tony he was a wizard before their first date. But how can Steve break it to Rhodes? And without losing valuable time trying to convince Rhodes that everything he’s saying is real?
Tony looks pretty amazing himself. He’s clad in a black t-shirt that’s just a little too short for him, and tight jeans in dark indigo that cling to the lines of his body perfectly.
“STEVE!” Tony yells. He’s helping Sam limp away, while Rhodes carries Reed over his shoulder. He throws an arm out, reaching for Steve. Anguish is reflected in his eyes. “I’m
Steve manages to push himself away from the ground, and raise his wand arm just a few inches, barely enough to point it in Doom’s general direction. He can hardly see straight, but the orb glows brighter still, drawing his eye.
How can Tony not be a wizard? He's changed Steve's world so completely, lit him up from the inside, made him feel alive.
Squibs are unique. They grow up with magic, have a front row seat to see everything they'll never have. Some even continue to try learning magic later in life, convinced they're late bloomers. Those dreams almost never pan out.
Tony’s shape gets smaller and smaller as he rockets away from Steve, and suddenly his auror training kicks in; he can’t let a suspect escape, not when there’s a chance he could prevent Tony from—
Before Steve can even close his mouth, let alone run to the edge of the rooftop, there’s a strange whirring sound, and something rockets up above the edge of the balcony at a tremendous speed.
Steve is as astonished as everyone else, though his reasons are completely different. Tony is… a wizard?
“Listen,” Rhodes continues. “I told him not to get involved with you magic folks again—I sure as hell don’t want to. I didn’t even want to be in this W.A.N.D.D. thing he suggested we apply for.”
When they part and Steve opens his eyes again, he finally notices that the sun has completely set; the massive billboards all around them are shining all the brighter, streaming light down on them, casting a multicolored, dancing glow over both their faces.
U untangles herself from DUM-E and, making herself smaller still, ascends to drape herself around Tony's shoulders, like a living scarf.
. You think it's a weakness… But you're wrong. I don't measure people's lives... I save them.’ Do you know who said that, Steve?” Tony asks.
Tony finishes strolling around the lab, finally stopping in front of Steve, encircling Steve’s waist with his arms.
She swims closer to Gracie's head, just as the whale trio pauses a few meters out from the observation center windows, and places her hands about where Tony imagines a human's temple would be, a look of concentration spreading over her features.
“Nomajs wouldn’t understand,” Steve maintains, voice simmering with anger. “They’ve always tried to hurt us—they’re scared of us—”
Kyle’s father, on the other hand, is red-faced and furious at this intrusion, however spectacular it may be. He stands up and throws down his napkin, attempting to rush at Tony.
Steve doesn’t know, not for sure, but—he pictures a man who isn’t quite him, dressed in red, white and blue—he can make a pretty good guess.
"I'm trying some different color schemes," Tony says hesitantly, biting his lip and making another gesture. "What do you think of this?"
Elevators used to have goblin attendants, Steve remembers as they zoom past floor after floor in silence—well, silence except for the sound of Sam chewing.
The sound of someone clearing their throat steals focus suddenly, saving him from struggling through a full reboot of his brain to try to come up with a retort.
“Richards,” Sam pleads with their captor, probably not for the first time. “Have you lost your damn mind?”
“Flexible LCD film projecting live images recorded from intrapixel microcameras,” Tony says nonchalantly. “More reliable than demiguise fur—trust me.”
Steve turns the cloak over in his hands, until he finds a small black switch on its underside. He flicks it, and watches as his hands virtually disappear.
He raises an eyebrow, making the same expression he did the first day they met, when he was asking about coffee and tea, and thinking about his robots. Steve's starting to think of it as Tony's Planning Face, and it thrills and terrifies Steve in equal measure.
man of my dreams,” he says, voice all sweetness, “this is without a doubt the best first date I have ever been on. But shit, as the kids say, is about to get
"It's not?" Tony asks brightly, sounding relieved. "Thank god. That would have been awkward, dating someone named
Tony relinquishes Steve's hand and bends down in his seat, only to pop back up with something on his lap: a briefcase of some kind. Steve had noticed Tony carrying it in passing when they arrived, but had forgotten about while he was, well, drowning in shame.
For just a second, the atmosphere in the Point Blue Underwater Observation Center is electric: a moment of unadulterated joy.
Tony shakes his head. “No. Really? Gryffindor? You think? I always kind of thought—not that I’ve thought about it in years, mind you, but—I assumed if I was anything, it’d be Ravenclaw or Slytherin.”
"—go," Tony finishes, sheepishly. "Okay. Thank you again for the best time. I'll remember it as long as I live."
"I'll get you back, man," he promises around a mouthful of bagel, and Steve smiles. At least Sam has learned he shouldn't put up a fight regarding this topic; no one goes hungry on Steve's watch.
Tony huffs a tiny laugh and drops his chin in an expression of phony timidity. “Well—it’s hard to remember—it all seems like a blur now—”
“Oh, just a coincidence, then? That’s… weird.” Tony bites his lip, looking puzzled. “That was the name of this character in these nomaj comics I used to read. I think he was supposed to be for kids in the forties and fifties—kind of a war propaganda thing. Hang on a second.”
"I told myself it was just another way of being magical, but I think I knew that was a lie. I hid my talents—or lack thereof, depending on how you look at it—and made it look like I was just another young wizard on his way to greatness. Another magical Stark, ready to take on the world. I even made my
“No need to be scared, dummy,” Tony comforts the robot, making a coaxing gesture. “Come on out. And bring the cup.”
Tony grabs two glasses of sparkling grape juice from what is probably a scientific workstation of some kind, covered with a table cloth for the occasion, and pulls Steve closer to one of the nearly half-meter thick panels of transparent aluminum, taking their spots for the big arrival.
Steve just glances back at forth between the phone and Tony a few times, still stunned into silence.
Steve is fucking Tony from behind the way he does everything: thoroughly, with decisiveness and precision—and achieving amazing results.
It's almost unrecognizable as a building at first; there's hardly anything left of the structure. Most of the image is taken up by a crater, a wound in the surface of the earth. Part of a wall remains at the far edge of the visualization, and as Stoner adjusts the image, zooming out, bricks, rebar, and other debris can be seen.
“Here you go, gentlemen,” Mrs. Arbogast says at last, handing Steve and Sam two more squares of flat plastic—nomajs really, really like their plastic—on loops of fabric cord, like the ugliest amulets Steve has ever seen. Reluctantly, he slips his over his head.
Steve's hand, almost of its own accord, snakes down to his coat pocket where he keeps Tony's calling card. He's gotten into the habit of letting his fingers trace the curved edge when he's nervous, or bored, or thinking of Tony.
“Anyway...” Tony approaches his desk, gaze coasting over the work surface until it lights on a stack of flat plastic circles. He grabs one off the top, and then returns to Steve, handing it to him.
“Do you… want to have kids?” Steve’s eyes are kind—he’s always kind to Tony, probably even when he shouldn’t be—but his face isn’t giving anything away one way or another.
Tony knows what he means. As much as the subjects of his own studies tend to be decidedly unbiological—physics and chemistry, the minutiae of matter / anti-matter reactions—there is something magical about being here.
“Not yet.” Crap. That reminds him. Steve hasn’t heard from Sam in almost a full day. He really needs to call—
- Not dissimilar from Petter Pettigrew and his little finger, Bucky is definitely alive, sans arm; I wonder how a long term Imperio curse would affect someone’s mind, hm?…
Rhodes beams with pride. "Good! Good. I notice you've been spending a lot of time with Tony in particular."
The world waited seventy years for Steve to come back to life, and Tony waited three weeks for Steve to ask him out: Steve can wait a little bit longer.
Timidly, but bearing a promise of things to come, pink blossoms are beginning to reappear on the tree next to McDonagh’s newsstand at the corner of Broadway and Chambers.
Steve's eyes dart momentarily to the occamy, who is back to her normal size and once more snoring softly on Tony's sweatshirt, her odd name suddenly making a lot more sense.
Not-Actually-Reed turns, pacing back toward the center of the room, his true features revealing themselves as he does so. He stands with his back to Tony as his frame fills in, musculature heavier than Richards. His eyes shift to a darker brown, nearly black.
“Steve, god, are you okay?” Tony starts to reach for Steve’s injuries, the hesitates. His gaze darts around, he tries to find something to staunches the bleeding on Steve’s stomach and shoulder. “We’ll get you some help—hold on, okay?”
“No,” Tony denies, then blushes. “I mean, maybe for my birthday. And our anniversary. And special occasions. As a personal favor.”
Doom raises his free hand, and makes a fist, squeezing. Rhodey’s gun crumples, the twisted heap of unusable metal teetering off his shoulder and landing on the concrete.
"Are you undercover? If you are, it's not for FAB—I have clearance to access files for almost all our undercover agents, and you're not in there—"
“You said we were back in the field today,” he says, voice sounding thin and low, brittle with disappointment.
, building it all with his hands. And he wants to give it to everyone, wizards and nomajs alike. Or, he would, Steve is sure, if he knew wizards existed.
Steve softly catches one of Tony’s flailing hands, lightly squeezing his fingers, giving Tony a faint smile. “I’m holding.”
“Out flying laps around the building. It’s not like he can help us where we’re going today, anyway.”
Tony pulls back suddenly, regarding Steve with a contemplative expression—something like nervousness flits across his features.
He's wearing those funny little tight shorts, just like the Captain character, only Bucky’s are over loud red tights. But the double breasted uniform jacket and red gloves look
“You’d be saving your friends’ lives,” Doom beseeches Tony, sweetening the deal. “Help me adjust procedure, make it safer, and they can live on without their abilities. Think of what we could accomplish together!”
“...Other Reed?” Tony’s voice shifts up in pitch, as he stares in confusion. He blinks at both their kidnapper and his new fellow prisoner, one a mirror image of the other.
Steve looks around the room, not really seeing, trying to come up with a solution—when he glimpses Tony’s RI logo mug from before.
He talks a mile a minute about SLAM algorithms, ABSO data, and possible improvements in teach pendants, and Steve doesn't understand a word of it, but he's captivated nonetheless, finds himself getting lost in the rhythm of it. Computers and robots can do so much, Tony explained to him. They can cart supplies around hospitals, automate difficult tasks, harvest crops, keep people safe.
Progress on the negotiations was made, and in the end, while the Federation would need more time to consider the prospect of cloning whales or otherwise adjusting their natural breeding practices, George and Gracie settled on some basic terms: they and their progeny were free to do as they pleased, but would return on a yearly basis to let a new team, headed up by prestigious marine biologist Dr. Namorita Prentiss, collect genetic material and provide treatment as needed.
Steve shuts his eyes without a second thought, and pictures it: the peeling paint and ugly carpeting of the hallway of Sam’s apartment, rushes back into the void again, arriving momentarily at his friend’s door.
“What?” Steve appears backlit in the bathroom doorway for a moment, shaking his head, before taking the bathroom lights down as well and crossing back to the bed to join Tony.
He’s either beaten his prey to the top floor, or he’s guessed entirely wrong, because he’s alone in the hallway.
Tony straps on the boots and affixes the gauntlets as fast as he can, then makes a run for the door—pausing, of course, to grab Steve’s butt as he passes him.
Tony smiles fondly. "The same thing she always did. She just scooped me up in her arms, held me tight, and said, 'Hey,
Steve apparates directly back to Tony’s lab, pacing back and forth the second he’s fully corporeal again. He reads Doom’s message over and over, trying to think of what to do next.
His smile fades again. “I’m really sorry you lost your bracers, though—er, well, the orb. I know you loved your spellshield.”
Steve stands absolutely still for a moment, entirely in shock. He may as well be made of stone again.
The whole concept of a reunion started as part of an agreement worked out between Dr. Gillian Taylor, the 20th century marine biologist who travelled along with the humpbacks, a group of Federation officers, and the whales themselves shortly after their arrival in the 23rd century.
“No, that’s her name: Janet VanDyne. Her family has some fae heritage, as it turns out, but it took science to bring those attributes in her DNA out.”
“I was thinking the same thing, Cap,” Tony whispers in Steve’s ear, making his heart leap up at the use of his old nickname.
"Not exactly..." he begins. "My family was very conservative. Part of an... insular community, you might say. I'm not sure I want to talk about it—"
He sees images that are vaguely familiar, a shred of truth in each of them: a sickly young man being transformed into a superhuman fighting machine. But instead of Solstice, the project is called Rebirth, and the physician leading up the whole impossible procedure is named, fittingly, Erskine.
U shrieks and shrinks, making herself tiny again, floating down to safety in between the savagely sharp pieces. She’s spared the worst of the cuts, but doesn’t dare to grow again, seeming to fear injuring herself further. She slithers to a far corner of the room and tries to hide.
- Agent Brand has green hair in 616; she’s presented here as a Metamorphmagus like Tonks. I suspect her boyfriend, Agent McCoy, is one as well. ;)
“Yes!” Tony points enthusiastically at Steve in affirmation. “I was even thinking Wanda could enchant it, get it to be even more powerful, make it fly around, or bounce off walls or something.”
A completely separate elevator looks like it can be boarded from the rooftop bar, and taken down to street level; if Steve was trying to get away without having to double back through the main entrance, that would probably be the first thing he would try.
"I swear, Tony, I had no idea." He buries his face in his hands for long seconds, then parts them enough for his mouth to peep through. "I am so sorry."
Steve blasts off a "REVELIO!", but the figure moves too quickly, dodging his spell. They rush toward and through the faux wall, the cloak flapping around them as they go, a shimmer of light, disturbing the air.
Tony stopped Doom’s power just by touching him. If Tony is somehow… anti-magical… as Reed supposes, and Steve is a wizard...
,” Tony clears his throat rather emphatically, “Ah, personal calling cards. With my personal information. In case you, uh, think of something you want to ask me. Off-hours. Or. Whenever.”
It comes to him in a flash: he'll pick up some hot Eel’s eye stew from Hungry Hippogriff in Highbridge, and take it to Sam's apartment. It'll make Sam feel better, and Sam will harp on Steve if he talks about Tony too much, so Steve’ll be prevented from dwelling on his date. It's a perfect solution.
“Since this thing is technically RI property,” Rhodes whispers from behind Steve, both of them crouching beneath the draped film of the invisibility cloak, “I’m telling Tony he has to make the next one bigger.”
It—or she, Steve supposes—lowers her head into Tony's outstretched hands, and makes a cooing sound, closing her eyes in tender moment of trust.
He takes a few slow steps back from Steve, detaching from Steve's person completely. He looks Steve up and down, like he can't quite believe what he's seeing. "You don’t think I should get to tell anyone. I don't have skin in the game, so to speak."
Steve stands up along with her. “Bobbi—” He looks more pointedly at the folder in her hand. “You… You wouldn’t, ah—”
don’t let them take you out for rainbow bagels and unicorn frappuccinos. They don’t even have real unicorn in them.”
—a grabbing spell. He catches chairs and cocktail tables with the spell as he goes, narrowly missing the perp's cloak every time. Steve growls in frustration, flinging furniture to the side. There’s going to be a lot of cleanup enchantment, not to mention a ridiculous amount of paperwork, but he can’t think of that right now.
“I don't think so,” he says after a long pause. “Probably not. Definitely not.” He nods, then feels his mouth twist to the side. “Probably definitely.” He chuckles at himself, at the absurdity of those words together, and Steve smiles at him, still very carefully not looking either hopeful or disappointed, Tony notices. “But…” He scrubs his hands over his face and grumbles in frustration.
He wants to buy Tony a bouquet of night lilies—the ones that are the same dark blue as Tony’s eyes—at the Brooklyn Bizarre Bazaar, and then turn them into butterflies with a flick of his wand.
“And on that note, Cap, we’ve got 20 minutes before everyone else gets here, and we need to make the most of it.”
As they wind their way closer to Yankee Stadium, the landscape changes some—it's a more populated area, even at this late hour, and Steve doubles his concentration to keep the cloaked figure in his sights as they dart between nomajs.
Steve had always thought it was sad that his new compatriots would have to have their memories wiped so fully. He genuinely liked them. He knew, at the time, that some of the top brass would be allowed to keep their remembrances intact, contingent on the promise that they would keep the secrets they found out about. More recently, Steve learned that they were the ones who would go on to form W.A.N.D.D.
"Captain America wasn't even real," Tony scoffs, waving a hand. "And besides, you're way too young to have fought in World War II."
“Sorry about Richards; he’s been in a snit all week for some reason. Maybe he misses Samuels. He feeling any better?” Tony inquires.
Sam went home early from Rhodes yesterday, saying he felt ill. Steve hasn't heard from him since; maybe he's still resting.
Rhodes laughs. “Okay, Mister Samuels, I guess that’s you, then. Reed’ll be here shortly. And for the robotics tour, Mister Stevens—”
“You didn’t do a damn thing wrong,” Steve says, firm but kind. “You didn’t ‘slip up’, and even if you had, you’re allowed. You’re allowed to change your mind. You’re allowed to work it out over time.” He holds both of Tony’s hands in his own, like he’s holding something precious to him, something rare and breathtaking. “I want to be there for you as you do. And I want you to be there for me.” He cups Tony’s face in his hand, and damn Steve, he’s about to put tears in Tony’s eyes again, and it’s for much more terrifying reasons this time.
It’s... not ideal, that’s for certain, but it will have to do: from a janitor’s rolling bucket, he retrieves a rather disgusting looking floor mop. Not even stopping to wring the water out of it, Steve climbs aboard it and lifts off. Descending only momentarily to scoop up the invisibility cloak, he sails over the balcony’s edge and into the night.
“It’s gorgeous, Tony,” Steve says sincerely, running his fingers reverently along the handle. “Thank you.”
"Yeah," Tony says, tension simmering in the rough bass notes of his voice. "Now you're getting it. I'm not a murderer, or a bomber, or
Of course, two days later, when Steve determines he’s going to ask Tony out, he’s scheduled for meetings with everyone but his favorite roboticist.
“Tell them already,” she admonishes Steve, who sits across from her at one of the enormous tables in MACUSA’s expansive commissary.
“No,” Brand says grimly, frowning, as her hair turns a fiery red and orange color, clearly thinking of her own nomaj dating horror story. “But
He could go home. But it's too early for bed, and besides, Steve is far too keyed up for sleep. He can only think of Tony, and now he's thinking about bed, and Tony
Rhodes returns to smiling politely and munching on pasta for long seconds, before mumbling under his breath: "Besides. A guy like me? Whole military technology company at his disposal? I'd use something
Tony cards a hand through his hair and shakes his head before settling back down against Steve's chest. "All right, fine. Magic wrist bracers. I can work with that," he resolves.
Tony... was sickly as a child? Steve can certainly relate to that. As much as he wants to know more, though, it'd be hypocritical of him to press the issue. More importantly, this is the first time Steve's ever seen shame dashed across Tony's features, and he doesn't like it one bit.
"It was a spellshield," Steve says, a little sheepishly, afraid of disappointing Tony, dashing still more dreams about his childhood idol. "It only worked with a magical artifact—the Vambraces of Erskinus—and those were destroyed."
Tony, on the other hand, is shackled to an exposed pipe running up a wall to Steve’s right. The cuffs look mundane in nature, but no less formidable, constructed of heavy bands of silvery-grey metal, looped around the piping with a weighty chain.
. Crisp. Precise. The lines of his merlot-hued button down shirt and the pleats in his trousers;the part in his raven hair; the lines of jaw. Even his eyes—dark blue, with bright little teal flecks—dazzle him, recalling the sparks of light emitted from a wand as it casts some intricate charm.
"Well, sure," Tony reaches in and pushes on the screen, moving the focus to the title of the issue. "And Grindelwald was ultimately in charge of Hydra. But this was written by a nomaj, not a magi-historian."
- Re: steve’s wands, Sycamore wands are known for being fickle and becoming bored—probably a bad choice for a young wizard, in addition to all the problems one might have with a hand-me-down wand that didn’t “choose” them. Alder wands are well suited to wordless magic, which I feel might be the next best thing for Steve in lieu entirely wandless magic. Both Alder and Sycamore are native to Ireland.
Steve is clad in navy blue boxers and one of the hotel’s provided robes, sitting propped up against a small mountain of pillows. Tony’s head rests on one of Steve’s thighs. He is—not entirely surprisingly—still naked.
“This isn’t a panacea, you know,” Tony goes on, more seriously. “It’s… kind of the opposite. No more magical fixes to mundane injuries for me now. No healing potions, anapeo charms, skele-grow… None of it will work on me. We still have to be careful when we’re... avenging.”
Doom turns away from the pedestal, back to his favorite prisoner, overjoyed at this sudden change of heart.
That’s… mostly true. It’s 4:45am; the commissary hasn’t even opened yet for the day. Bobbi is grimacing through a magically reheated cup of yesterday’s coffee, and Steve had to conjure the tea.
And come to think of it, Tony had never tried to hurt Steve. He hadn't put up a fight at all, he just ran—and then flew—away. That didn’t seem like the behavior of a criminal desperate to keep an auror at bay.
It’s not something he likes doing, even on the job, let alone to a good friend, but right now it’s necessary. Steve takes a deep breath, and apparates directly inside Sam’s apartment.
Steve shudders at Tony’s choice of words, even though his hypothesis is sound. Who could think any of this was a ‘success’?
Tony hasn't considered it before. They haven't ever discussed the prospect of children. Surely Steve will bring it up at some point, even if it's just to say he's not interested in having them. Or does he want Tony to make the first move? Or if it's a no, then perhaps he thinks there's no point in the conversation. Maybe he thinks it wouldn't be healthy for Tony to have kids at all, an opinion Tony mostly agrees with. Maybe—
“You’re talking about breaking the International Statute of Secrecy!” Steve shouts, throwing his arms up.
Steve sets his cup down. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he tells her, affecting a fake calm, smile still not entirely banished from his face (dammit.) “Also, stop using your powers on me. ”
"I bet you say that to all the cute roboticists," Tony whispers in Steve's ear, sending shivers up Steve's spine... until it registers what Tony's just said.
" Steve stops, realizing how much he's raised his voice, and tries again, his tone more measured. "I thought... you were only supposed to tell someone who you were...
"I'm sure you're right. And to be fair," Tony lets his smile turn wolfish, "it's a pretty good mission they've got:
"I've never seen one before," Steve says quietly, radiating a childlike wonder. "Not in person. I saw a dolphin just off Coney Island once, but...this is something else."
Tony opens his eyes, his head now swiveled in Steve’s direction. For a moment, Steve thinks he sees a flicker of recognition in Tony’s eyes, but in the dim wandlight, it’s hard to say for sure.
Tony, seemingly pleased with that answer, smiles and leans in again, closing his eyes. Steve does the same, feeling a soft, warm breath, gentle on his lips just before they meet Tony's.
Steve looks pleadingly at the waitress, who shrugs, as if to say, “I don’t know what he’s doing either,” and walks away to serve her other tables.
Steve risks fluttering the front of the cloak just a bit. It’s Tony’s own tech: he’s got to be able to recognize it.
Slamming the briefcase shut, and setting it back at his feet, he raises his arms in the air, waving the remaining breadstick in his hand in a looping gesture, something not dissimilar from a Swish-and-Flick spell casting motion. It hits Steve, then, what he's seeing: Tony's using the breadstick as a pretend
James Rhodes’ turns just in time to catch Steve attempting to stifle a yawn. The CEO smirks pointedly.
“Gentlemen,” she says, grinning from ear to ear, more like she’s congratulating them than chastising them, “I’m afraid we’re going to have to ask you to leave.”
“God, Steve, I’m sorry.” Tony covers his face with his hands. “I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have said it—I just slipped up—”
, that was close—and closes around Steve’s muggle phone, which he extracts from Steve’s jacket before taking a half-step back.
Embroidered in white and navy, the logo for the “Chicago Flyers” is a little studebaker with wings on its side. The patch is attached with a few different colors of thread stitched around its edges, like it’s been sewn on more than once.
Steve's head snaps sharply in Tony's direction, eyes flashing, looking deeper, bluer than usual. His voice drops in both pitch and volume. "Are those official orders, Commander?"
But the instant their lips meet, Steve is hit with a wave of heat. Tony moans softly into Steve’s mouth, and Steve is sure Tony feels the same as he does.
Steve's pace is quick and unwavering, his thick, lube-soaked cock driving deep into Tony at steady intervals. With every thrust, Tony can feel his own cock bobbing in front of him, can feel his ass jiggling obscenely.
what you are, Tony,” Doom counters. “No one else seems to, though—certainly not that thick-headed auror paramour of yours.” He crouches just in front of Tony. The metal facsimile of a mouth he wears is fixed in a grimace, but his voice pitches upward, signalling a hidden smile.
He can’t think about… what he’s thinking about. Not right now, when he’s about to meet his new teammates.
He probably still will—to take Tony lunch, and see the bots and U, and walk Tony home, and, okay, fine, just to bask in Tony’s presence. But it’s not a requirement anymore, and he’s worried losing the rhythm of a daily assignment will throw off his schedule.
He pulls her back in, continuing to explain, while simultaneously fishing his wallet out of his back pocket. Steve can’t quite see the full amount he’s retrieving, and he’s not an expert on the relative costs of things in nomaj dollars, but the top bill says ‘100’ on it, and there’s definitely more than one in the stack he hands to her.
"Oh, yes." Because of course, Steve has read up on it, remembers it all, and can hold a coherent conversation about it. Which in turn allows Tony to regain his composure in peace, all while watching Steve dazzle one of the earth's foremost marine biologists, armed with quotes from her own paper on male humpback mating displays and his hyperwatt smile. (Okay, maybe 'evil' was a strong word choice.)
"What?" Tony looks back and forth between the hologram and Steve, until Steve's meaning dawns on him. "Oh, I hadn't even thought of that. I was going for sort of a... phoenix color scheme, you know?"
“Sir,” Steve tries again, unwilling to back down. “Let me visit the blast site. Maybe I could pick up some traces that were left after the repair charms—”
Doom’s jaw drops open, his arm frozen mid-spell, dumbstruck for a moment. Then the angry resolve returns to his face and he tries again.
Eventually the glass, even bolstered as it is by Doom’s spellcraft, cracks unders the strain, shattering into a million pieces. U shields Sam with her coils, allowing the shards to rain down, bouncing off her scales as they fall to the ground.
the various terms for non-magical children of wizards; none of them come close to describing how special Tony is.
Tony's stomach won't stop doing flip flops and something is balling up in his throat, that horrible tightness that usually only releases with tears. He gets some space between himself and Steve, starts to turn to face him.
Still dazed, acting entirely on instinct, Steve uses a binding charm on Doom, tying his wrists and ankles with magic, and then follows it up with a little shoving spell, pushing the madman further away from them, just to be safe.
.'" Tony's voice goes soft and warm when he says it, channeling a bit of his mom, trying to show Steve something of her kindness. "And I said 'hey,
Not even any cachet they wielded as decorated Starfleet officers (and, in Steve's case, a bonafide living legend) had netted them access to one of the most coveted tickets on the planet: an invitation to the underwater viewing areas that were part of Dr. Prentiss' Farallon Islands research facility on the first day of the whales' return.
Steve moves quickly and quietly through each room, alert, wand at the ready, but he finds nothing out of the ordinary—until he reaches Sam’s bedroom.
It lands in Steve’s palm with a satisfying smack, just a fraction of a second before Doom can reach for it. But that’s all the time Steve needs.
Tony is rising, standing up in front of Steve. Color is returning to his skin, the ashy pallor of death fading away.
Sam is the last to appear, Rhodey apparating along with him, sidecar style. Sam is still in rough shape, limping over to Steve’s reclining form, and Rhodey looks a little green around the gills from apparating twice in quick succession.
A garish three-story atrocity, marked with an abundance of green neon, packed wall-to-wall with tourists, including more crying nomaj children than Steve had
Sam points his wand at himself, and whispers a transfiguration incantation. A wave of light ripples over his brown trench coat, rumpled blue button down and khakis, transforming them into a smart grey business suit and clean, pressed white shirt with a black tie.
Tony quickly bends to grab his briefcase, and makes for the exit at a quick but graceful clip, with Steve hot on his heels. Before they’ve gotten halfway to the door, Steve hears the restaurant burst into a round of applause behind them.
"My dad wasn't exactly... a kind man, but he didn't tolerate anyone speaking to my mother that way, so he did what he thought he had to do: he quit MACUSA, left the day-to-day operations of Stark Enchantments to his brother, Edward Stark—with a clause that I had the right to inherit the business when I got older, of course—and moved us all to Europe right after I was born. He thought it would quiet the chatter about our family." Tony laughs. "I think it only made people more curious. One of the foremost magifacturers of the day just quits? How often does that happen? And to say people were curious about
A glimmer rolls over the silver armor hologram, and suddenly it's covered over in rich carnelian with amber accents, just like the back of Tony’s calling cards.
,” he says more softly, his pitch rising up and then dropping suggestively low on that last syllable, causing something warm to coil in Steve’s belly.
Tony pulls a metal stool away from one of the work benches and sits. Steve feels a nudge next to him, and sees that DUM-E has pushed up one for him as well.
But as luck would have it, the third year was the charm. Their number got pulled in the lottery for attendance to the Reunion Ceremony. Both Steve and Tony were ecstatic.
- Tony’s Captain America quote is from Avengers Vol 5, issue 34, i.e. Hickmanvengers. My first instinct was to use the “no, you move” speech, but I needed a break from that one, and I feel like this one gets more to the heart of what Tony’s trying to say, anyway. It’s… actually way less pretentious when Squib!Tony says it than when Cap does, IMO, hahaha.
“Promise me, Captain,” she points at him before slinging her bag over her shoulder and starting to head out. “Promise me you’ll ask him out.”
“You’ve said it yourself: you hate magic. But if I may offer a small amendment, I think what you actually hate is wizardkind. They’ve humiliated you, made it clear how
Steve rights himself as the footsteps tear off in the direction of the bar; he gives chase again without a moment’s hesitation, pushing through the glass doors and shooting off several rounds of
Steve grits his teeth through the pain, clutching his wounded arm; he forces his hand upward just enough to cast a flattening charm at the metal fragments winging through the air above his head; they lose their mass, all at once becoming thinner than paper. The shiny bits of foil flutter to the ground, shimmering and twisting in the air like confetti, strangely festive in the midst of the violence.
"YOU! STOP!" Tony glances backward at the beast, and as Steve's haze of panic recedes, he noticing the animal has a beak, not the lizard-like snout of a hydra at all.
He’s rocked with a second wave of pain as he thrown by the force of the spell; he lands in the corner of the room, feet from the pipe where Tony was being held moments ago. Ears ringing, he winces  and tries to shake off the tearing feeling in his joints. He looks up and to his left, and sees Tony.
U gives a little yawn before tucking in her beak and her single wing, forming a perfect little loop with her body, and preparing to nod off.
"Of course! Which is why you are definitely not thinking about dating Tony, and we definitely didn't have this talk."
Oh, no. Steve, who was bullied mercilessly growing up, understands exactly how mean children can be to one another. "Where did you go?"
“This ends with me wearing the Captain America outfit doesn’t it? With the… what did you call them? Booty shorts?”
They walk as fast as they can without running, for about a block, evading the green glow of the restaurant’s multiple neon signs, and the lingering gazes of the patrons through the glass windows.
Then Tony makes a gesture, and an image appears, projecting upward from the workbench surface in a flash, floating in midair. For what feels like the hundredth time in twelve hours, Steve has to remind himself that Tony isn't a wizard.
The Sorting Hat, Tony explained, is something of a final authority on squibs—no non-magical person has ever fooled it before, regardless of how extensive the trickery employed was. Some preternatural ability bestowed by the Hogwarts founders, Steve suggests, and Tony rolls his eyes at that, calling it a rather “hand-wavy explanation” (which strikes Steve as slightly odd; typically, spells were performed by waving your hands—wouldn’t “hand-wavy” mean ‘powerful’?)
going?” Rhodey asks with a hint of disdain in his voice, just as U pecks at his fingers. He probably deserved that.
But before Steve can get another word out, a massive, inhuman figure appears before him, seemingly out of nowhere.
They burst out laughing, heads thrown back, unable to contain themselves any longer. They laugh long and loud, and it leaves Steve breathless and teary with absolute joy for the first time since he woke up.
"What were we talking about?" Scott asks companionably, clearly excited to be involved in the gossip of the living.
Steve watches the yellow vehicle pull away with his hands in his coat pockets, sighing wistfully, thoughts of the last kiss they shared filling his head. Momentary confusion and disappointment aside, that was... a pretty perfect first date, all things considered.
He doesn’t have any kind of a wand that Steve can see, but that’s not necessarily a requirement for a talented wizard—Steve himself is living proof of that.
Reed was recovering slowly but steadily—the healers at HMC prescribed him bedrest, continual application of dittany to his scars, and plenty of chocolate. He has been having trouble with the first one; he is nearly as inquisitive as Tony, and upon arriving at a magimedical facility, he kept asking the healers on call questions about their work. Steve had heard they finally had to slip him a sleeping draught in his pumpkin juice to get him to calm down.
“But you’ve been around spells your whole life,” Steve considers. “You had to have been charmed before now. This never happened before?”
Steve examines the paper the bird retrieved; it’s a Daily Conjurer, the edition from two days ago. Sam hasn’t been here in days.
Tony stands up. Raising his arms over his head, he motions with his hands, and the baskets dance in a circle in the air.
He looks back at Steve, still conversing with Nita—just how much is there to say about humping humpbacks, exactly?—and he supposes Steve was probably a very mature child, too, though for very different reasons. Steve's explained how he grew up sickly, how he lost his parents at young age. Having to fend for himself in Manhattan in the 1930s must have been... Tony's not even sure he has the vocabulary to understand it fully, let alone describe it.
The explosions. The explosions weren't the goal, they were just a side effect, Steve realizes. All the ability of a fully grown witch of wizard—ten times more powerful than an obscurial, which could only be found in adolescents—drawn out of them, and released into the atmosphere. Of course it backfired. Of course it was deadly.
This is day one of the review. According to the procedures Steve had reviewed during the car ride over, it could take
He reaches for Tony’s face, trying to brush his gauntleted hand against Tony’s cheek. The blue glow throws Tony’s features into sharp relief; he looks nervous for the first time since Steve arrived down here.
Yeah, Steve thinks, licking his lips and putting his phone away. Nomaj casual wear is pretty much the best.
“No,” he says, voice gone low and dangerous, seemingly to no one in particular, and Steve starts to realize that Tony’s Planning Face is nothing compared to his Determined Face; Steve has no idea what’s about to happen, and there is no way anyone in this restaurant is going to be ready for it.
What does technology have to do with it? Not that Steve isn't impressed by that as well, but doesn't Tony want to talk about magic? After all the time they’ve spent hiding it from one another?
"Hm, what?" the ghost asks, floating over the table. "Oh, hey, Rogers, Morse. Didn't even see you there."
“Hi,” he says softly, his gaze locked on Steve’s face. “Tony Cerrera. Lead Engineer, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.”
Bobbi sits up, defensive. “I might be a Legilaffex, but I don’t need to read your emotions for this. It’s on your face, for Merlin’s sake.” She leans forward, imploring. “Come on, Steve. I think you’ll feel better if you tell me, and it’s not like there’s anyone else around to hear.”
Steve and Tony watch them in amazement as they pass, heads turning as the whales go, eyes locked onto them, until their tails are hidden behind the next lucky group of people waiting by the panel to their left.
As the light ascends, casting a wider glow over everything in the room, Steve can make out the man’s profile as he works.
Tony respects and trusts Reed’s intellect more than nearly anyone else’s, so if Tony thinks Reeds idea has merit, it’s probably a sound one.
Doom cries out in frustration as his work is destroyed before his eyes. He breaks the standoff with Steve, bringing his wand down hard, slicing his spell beam in an arc at Steve’s shoulder. The magic scorches through Steve’s uniform, tearing at his flesh, and he cries out in pain, falling to one knee.
to me growing up,” Tony goes on about Steve’s fictionalized counterpart. “Everything. I don't think you understand."
Steve lets the seemingly nonsensical order of the letters shift through his mind... and it sparks a memory.
"Pods are temporary social structures for humpbacks; compared to other whale pods, they're small and tend not to last long," Steve corrects. He then immediately ducks to take another swig of his grape juice, as if he's realized the combination of his excitement and eidetic memory have just made him look like the world's most athletic whale nerd.
“That’s your cue to disapparate,” Tony informs him coldly, not looking him in the eye. “See you Monday, Steve.”
But Steve is surprised at what he sees when he crosses the threshold of the illusory building. The figure is... running. Just running.
"Anyway, it's not like yours was an uncommon reaction. Glitches—squibs, whatever—" Tony winces, like even saying them himself, the words still hurt. "It's not like we get a lot of recognition in wizarding society. We’re mostly forgotten about. Everyone hopes it'll never happen to their kids." He shrugs. "Not everyone gets to do magic."
Tony hooks his fingers in his belt loops and shuffles in place, for once not offering a witty quip in response, seemingly unable to take in that Steve just implied that he was ‘brave at heart.’
"Aye, Scotland," Tony says, when Steve mentions what Tony had said earlier, performing a credible impression of that country's rhotic accent. "Beautiful place. My parents had a lovely house in the Highlands when I was born. But..." a shadow falls across his face as he speaks. "Our situation changed when I was getting into my teens, and we moved back to the States. I... fell ill," he confesses. "I... don't think I want to talk about that right now, either."
The man turns around—the helmet's faceplate is sleek, smooth, all clean lines. It bears an intimidating expression, but not one of cruelty like Doom's old armor. But that doesn't mean that, if it is indeed the same man, that he couldn't have upgraded in the intervening years.
He thinks he could, even without drawing his wand, push the man back down into his seat with a simple
A section of the glass retracts, and Doom shoves Sam forward, into the chamber. Before the dazed and bloodied wizard can react, the glass reseals itself, locking him in. The incarcerous charm that bound him falls away. He bangs on the glass, yelling, to no avail.
He finally looks back at Steve, holding his breath as he does; even after all this time together, there’s still some part of him that feels like he could ruin everything with Steve in the space of a moment. Like there’s a piece of him made of glass, liable to shatter at the slightest impact.
Oh. Kids at the Academy made him think of… yeah, Tony can see him making that connection. Damn. He thought he might get through the night scot-free, that he might not have to address the, uh, whale in the room, so to speak.
to access his magical stores. He’d do it with a flourish, whether it was his first time meeting a customer or his five-hundredth.
But he remembers something else from his calendar program: earlier today, Tony had his final physical after… the incident.
“Rough night last night?” Tony elbows him good-naturedly. “Or good one? It’s okay, I’ve been there, trust me. But you look like you could use a cup of coffee.”
From his jacket, he pulls out a little grey electronic device with a glowing screen, not unlike the one the one the Bureau equipped him and Sam with for this assignment, only Rhodes’ is smaller and sleeker. He thumbs it a few times and pockets it again.
Steve notices Tony doesn’t mention any of the Unforgivable Curses by name, and that’s fine with Steve. He has no desire to remember what it felt like to think he was going to lose Tony forever.
The dark wizard winds up his wand arm again, and Steve is trying to stand up—for Tony, to make Doom pay for what he did to Tony—
Leaning in the doorway to Rhodes’ office, grinning, casual as anything, is the most beautiful man Steve has ever seen.
Tony's eyes are closed, but the twisting shapes of light filtering in from the floor to ceiling windows of their underwater hotel suite dance over his eyelids. (They were on the waitlist for over a year for this place; If Tony was going to book them a sea-themed weekend, he was going to do it right. It's located just off the mainland, miles from Blue Point, but the effect is very much the same. Except, of course, with no other guests and no whales to peek in on them. Which is good, because what Steve's doing to Tony at the moment might, in fact, make even a whale blush.)
Tony slows and eventually stops, levitating in the air, twenty feet above where Steve is standing. Light radiates from his palms and the soles of his feet, as well as from the eye slits of the silver mask.
"Cut the nonsense, Tony. What wizarding organization? Or country, for that matter? Is it Russia? Somewhere in Eastern Europe?"
The line is longer than he would have expected at the Hungry Hippogriff, and they’re out of Eel eye stew, so Steve has to settle for a Flobberworm bisque, but he’s finally on his way, strolling out of the back alley that conceals the deli from nomaj passersby.
"No,” Tony reassures him, voice a little hoarse. “It wasn't—isn’t—like that with you. I figured you were a wizard—no offense, but you knew less about defense contracts than just about anyone I'd ever worked with at RI—and, ah, the Olive Garden thing kind of clinched it. But you never made me feel less-than. Maybe for a minute out there on the balcony, I guess—”
The gauntlets and the boots make a whirring sound; metal panels slide open, and Tony removes the gloves from his hands, handing them to DUM-E's waiting claw, and steps out of the boots. Finally, he pops a catch on the helmet and pulls it off of his head, tucking it neatly under his arm.
to do with the fact that the deli is around the corner from the latest explosion site, on the case he is absolutely not supposed to be working on. That... is mere coincidence.
- I daresay Wanda Maximoff and Ariana Dumbledore have a lot in common in this ‘verse. Could there be an incident involving “no more wizards” perhaps? W-day? :O
Steve feels his mind drift back into his past yet again—but not the war this time. There were magibombs used by both sides in the fighting, of course, but they were nothing like this.
Doom twirls his wand again, preparing another killing curse, and thrusts it closer to Tony’s face this time.
“That’s a pre-release,” Tony says, nodding at the broom. “The six-hundred series doesn’t come out until the fall. I got one of their sales witches a new Stark Equinox 7 tee-dub with an unlimited conjuring plan,” he explains, “And she got me one of those.”
“Now…” His hands fall still. He stares at them. “Do you remember what I said the day we met?” He stops himself before Steve can reply. “What am I talking about? I know you do.”
Tony... laughs. Laughs, and laughs. He folds at the waist, overcome by it. He has to wipe tears from his eyes.
As sentient creatures, George and Gracie had every right to make their way to the open ocean after their interaction with the Probe; their reason for being transported in the first place had been fulfilled.
His toes flex into the mattress and his fingers curl into the flesh of his thighs in desperation. Which Steve notices. Of course he does.
He could have kept quiet—the silence of being overcome with awe would've certainly been an appropriate reaction.
But regardless of the circumstances, Steve thought of Southern Italy often, dreaming of what it must have been like in summer, in peacetime. Olive groves covered most of the region; they were the crop the area was known for, and even after all these years, Steve dreamt up fantasies of the sun beating down on the olive trees growing up and down the hillsides of Campania.
Steve feels the muscles of his neck clench, and he makes a fist involuntarily. How could anyone be that cruel?
The waitress pauses a moment, like she’s deciding whether to press the issue, then begins to walk away, obviously disturbed by what she’s just seen.
Tony catches the wand in his hand. Green light pours off the wand… and is absorbed into Tony’s skin, seemingly inert.
It was one more reason that Steve, after his resurrection, hadn't bothered to look up what happened to anyone he knew during the war—most of them wouldn't remember him, anyway.
His rhythm is only broken for a moment as he reaches to the nightstand to his right to retrieve a cylindrical object, maybe 15 or so centimeters long, a handful of centimeters wide. It's made of a clear soft material, with metallic silver and black shapes suspended in it, glinting in the dim light: it's the pretty new stroker Steve had packed for them. Even as carefully as Steve is handling it, the rigor of their fucking jostles his grip on it, and lube dribbles out one end.
The creature shrieks again and spreads its wings—no, wing, singular—there's only one on the right side of its long, narrow body—
"I choose to take that as a compliment," Tony winks devilishly. "So. I've been loud and annoying enough for a while," he segues casually. “Your turn to talk. I want to hear how the hell it is that you’ve never heard of this fine establishment before. Did you grow up somewhere other than the United States? Serious question,” he clarifies, gesturing with the last bite of breadstick. “I grew up partly in Scotland and I’ve had my fair share of… culture shock, too.”
She looks at him skeptically at first, but bends down, allowing him to whisper several sentences in her ear.
"Stop," he commands. "Tony Cerrera, you are under arrest, on suspicion of first degree disintegration, destruction of public property, and possession of unregistered magical devices. You have the right to refuse to Legilimency, and to decline to provide your memories for inspection in a pensieve until such time as evidence is found that—"
"Feel what?" Bobbi asks. Scott, riveted, is leaning so far forward he's actually phasing part way through the table.
Joyful moments are like this are a bit less rare than maybe they once were, but there is still no one Tony would rather spend any of them with.
“Here,” he presents a colorful image on the screen. “Steve, meet Cap. I got ‘im in both physical and digital format. He’s… kinda my favorite.”
The name sounds strange to him. He hadn’t been particularly famous during the war—Project Solstice had been successful, yes, and he had been part of an elite fighting squadron, sure. But all the details has been classified. Besides, he was just doing his duty. And
Steve remembers the last time he saw an armored figure wearing a cloak. He suppresses a shudder as he tries to keep pace with the trespasser.
," Tony repeats even more forcefully. He paces, setting his coffee mug down on a workbench. "Captain America... He was transformed with science. He's an achievement of biology, okay? Erskine was a geneticist. And he took Steve Rogers, and he used the serum to make Steve as strong on the outside as he was good on the inside. That's how the story goes. That's the power of
"Friends," Dr. Prentiss announces over the mic, "I'd like to introduce you to Gracie, George, and their daughter Sarah!"
He's going to have to place Tony under arrest now. Tony will be put on trial, and imprisoned at the Raft—the underwater wizarding prison just off the coast, the last prison in the United States to still use Dementors as guards. He'll stay there for the rest of his life—that is, if he's not sentenced immediately to the Dementor’s Kiss.
Next year, Steve had said. They would come back again next year. Steve loved him, Tony thought, the sound of the faucet lulling him further toward sleep. Steve loved him, and there was no mission—or conversation—they couldn’t face together. There's going to be a next year.
He read all about how important it was as soon as he was revived, in fact. He can practically still see passages from
He shouldn’t pity Tony. He shouldn't. If he’s the one behind all this, that means he’s clearly a terrible person, incapable of remorse.
"I'm sorry," Tony backpedals immediately, obviously thinking he's triggered an awful memory of some kind.
There had been a code, Steve recalls, a cipher he and the others at the front had known... Nothing like what the cryptomancers used at Bletchley, of course. It was simple, just a letter transposition that they had sometimes used to pass messages around if they had to interact with an SOE contact, or thought maybe they were being scryed on. Each unit had a different number of letters to transpose—Steve had no idea what unit this man was a part of, though, or if that was even the cypher in question, but he could at least start working on some different combinations.
He strolls away from their table, pulling Steve along by the hand, and he realizes Tony is dragging him over to the table with the angry man and his son.
Steve scowls playfully and leans forward on his broom, preparing to give chase. Tony’s not going to get away from him that easily.
Tony jumps up to a sitting position on top of the nearest workbench. “Do you want to hear it?” he asks.
"...we're going not to go back to the old, bad days of having to obliviate anyone," Stoner continues, "so watch yourselves on this. Reconstruction charms have already been cast on the site, so we'll be working from wand scans.”
“I need to talk to you about the explosion,” Steve explains as Sam appears at his side, looking annoyed that Steve took off without him.
“—stabilized the spell, made it so you could summon more than one person, and prepared it for mass incantation,” Tony explained. “He was a natural born wizard. But even he knew he couldn’t have done it without the help of his W.A.N.D.D. colleagues. Yeah,” Tony nods at Steve’s surprised look. “The Tee-Dub was a military project at first. Back in the early eighties, there was a huge push to explore the scientific properties of magic—a real renaissance period. For a time, people actually wanted to understand what made magic
"Uhm," Steve's gaze is suddenly drawn down the tabletop, as if by rare-earth magnets, like the ones Tony showed him. "The first day I met him."
He pivots back to face Tony again. “The one he accused you of being?” he asks pointedly. “Yes, quite so.”
Tony follows Steve's lead and repeats the movement, again and again, rocking forward into the sleeve, then back onto Steve's cock. Tears begin to form in Tony's eyes as he builds to a steady cadence: it feels unbelievable.
Another woman in an embroidered Olive Garden uniform shirt approaches them—probably a supervisor of some kind?
Tony reaches across the table to stop Steve before he can cover his ruby-red face yet again, catching the fingers of Steve's right hand with his own.
He laughs again. "You probably won't believe this, but there was a little while there where I think people were more excited for Tony Stark to make his public debut than they were for Harry Potter."
Sliding his wand between the folds of the cloak, Steve casts a spell, and the concrete splits and begins to slide apart, shaking the earth beneath their feet as it moves.
Steve Rogers, auror, notes them briefly, squinting slightly at the bright spring sun, before asking Laleh at the stand for his usual.
Tony bares his teeth at Doom and yanks his arms forward, banging his cuffs against the pipe in a show of disgust.
want to… invite you over to, ah, spend some time…” He lets a hand coast over the back of his neck, which is also going hot as he struggles to finish the sentence.
“Hey, Ab,” Bobbi twists back in the seat, greeting her partner casually. “Steve is. Probably. If he gets the nerve up. You know any hot nomaj spots?”
The Andorian whispers to her again and she stills, staring out the window, attention focusing on the water just beyond them. Something about her energy makes her seem a little older than her age: a kid clearly willing to stay up past her usual bedtime for the sake of science. Tony had been like that, too, though he hasn't had occasion to think about that time in his life for years now: reading his PADD under the blankets until just before dawn.
He couldn’t see past his own prejudices, couldn’t let Tony in—can’t seem to let anyone in—Bobbi, Carol, Sam—
—and curls her neck around its long arm. The robot flexes its claw, seemingly happily, like this is a thing that happens often.
Steve hears a chirp and feels something warm brushing against his hand; DUM-E is handing him the mug of tea.
"I don't know what a 'Doom' is, at least not in the way you seem to mean it. And I don't have anything to do with the explosions. I was investigating them, the same as you."
James Rhodes seems like a really nice person. Steve isn’t on a first name basis with a lot of nomajs, but if Rhodes were a wizard, he seems like the sort of guy Steve could, to use a phrase, get a butterbeer with.
Stoner flicks his wand again and turns the entire image, and now visible in the foreground is a sign: LAYTON PREPARATORY ACADEMY.
Tony turns to the computer terminal one more time, and enters a passcode of some kind, and then motions again. The armor and the deciphering script disappear, revealing…
Steve’s shuddering climax ripples through Tony’s own body, a secondary wave of pleasure, almost too much to take in.
. I'd mix the right chemical compound, and suddenly it would glow! It was my special hobby, and I was
It's been three years since Fury lured him out to San Francisco to show him pretty pictures of oversized nacelles, and subsequently introduced to him to the man he'd idolized his whole life in two different ways. The man who would save his life, break his heart, then save his life
Hauling Sam behind him with one hand, he raises the other, drawing a sharp line from the floor to the ceiling with his wand.
Red bloomed in Steve's cheeks at being called out so directly. He paused a moment, then took a deep breath. "Well, it's just that... they're from out of time, too. They're from the twentieth century, and I—"
Feeling chilly and exposed, Tony sits up and covers himself with the comforter. Steve raises an arm in invitation. Tony crashes into the pile of pillows beside him, cozying up next to him, looking anywhere but at Steve’s face.
The report indicated that MACUSA was working under the assumption that the wizard responsible for the explosions had written the rune—but this was not the precision work of someone preparing a ritual.
Tony begins to turn, lifting both arms; he presents one palm in what Steve hopes in a peaceful gesture while the other goes to his head, presumably to pop the faceplate again.
"Tony," Steve says soothingly in his date's ear. "You're the most talented person I've ever met, but you can’t just replicate a thousand year old magical artifact in your lab in a week."
It's possible Tony was talking to the clawed robot, who follows dutifully behind him, but Steve has a feeling he probably wasn't.
He holds the sheets in front of his face momentarily, shielding himself as well as taking in a cursory few details.
The sensation fades, and Steve takes a deep breath, feeling what must be his power rushing back to him.
That, coupled with the flickering streetlight (often a side effect of a spell in use in a nearby area), tells Steve he’s looking at the effects of a warding charm: an imperfect illusion, meant to keep nomajs away.
Under what remains of the staircase, covered over by debris, there's something moving in the darkness; the air seems to ripple and glitter.
” he casts at Reed and Tony. A golden beam strikes their cuffs, and they fall to the floor. He turns, focusing on the far wall where he and Rhodey entered, and casts a
Even with the scaly winged member of their party shrunk down the the size of a weevil and hiding in Steve’s pocket, it’s an extremely tight fit for the two of them and their various supplies under Tony’s cloak.
“It’s not as elegant as yours, true,” Doom agrees with Tony’s assessment, while pulling Sam up to standing, yanking at the magical bonds. “But it protected me through the course of my experiments, so it has served me well.”
Doom’s armor takes most of the impact from both blasts, but he’s knocked back, momentarily stunned by his attackers.
He turns right abruptly and heads for the bank of elevators, stopping briefly to take in a map of the hotel’s layout near the call buttons.
Tony glances at his phone, checking the time, and, apparently spurred by what he sees there, jogs away from Steve toward the supply closet near the break room entrance.
He never dreamed they were magical devices in disguise, or that Tony would be using those same spells to make a getaway.
“I wasn’t even the one to tell him,” he clarifies. “His on-again-off-again girlfriend, who’s a witch, did. But thanks for jumping to that conclusion.”
They talk at length about the humpbacks, and what their favorite parts of the evening were. About how incredible it was, and how everyone back aboard the Avenger will be insanely jealous once their shore leave is over (Clint will pretend not to be impressed, they both agree, but he’ll actually be just as envious as the rest.)
(Distantly, Steve considers that he may need some new friends who have fewer dangerous pets in their homes.)
cast only with his hands. It’d be a small enough effect that the other diners probably wouldn’t even see—not that Steve wouldn’t risk exposure if he had to. Whatever it takes to keep Tony safe.
No, the image reminds him of something much older. Most people remembered the incident as the Great Obliviation of 1926, or possibly as the ordeal with Newt Scamander, who went on to become something of a celebrity in magizoology.
The first two years, they had simply stayed in town during the festivities, attended some parties, and tried to spot the whales from above on boat and low-flying hovercraft tours.
think I was a spellcaster. Jarvis was the only one who knew the truth, and bless his heart, he never told anyone... Until it all came out in public."

Tony hits the ground, his body going limp as the spell rolls over him covering him in a spider web of green light before it dissolves.
But he had never known anyone who went to the oldest, and maybe the best, wizarding school in existence. The school where Merlin himself was trained.
"Please," Tony grits out in response, his voice a little higher than he expected. He opens his eyes, but doesn't even try to focus on anything.
"No, I'd like to, eventually... Just maybe not tonight. But as far as being sheltered from... well," he points to the restaurant around them, "
And with that, he pops the faceplate back down, walks to the edge of the balcony overlooking the city, hops the railing... and steps off the edge.
