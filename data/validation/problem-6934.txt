Once he had Steve comfortably sitting on the plush, cushiony chair, Tony lifted his hand to press small, open-mouthed kisses to Steve’s knuckles. “I’m going to head back to the bathroom quickly. You just sit here and relax.” He gave a reassuring smile to his boyfriend before heading to the bathroom, leaving the door open.
The super soldier could feel his teammates’ eyes on him, mostly curious since none of them knew that had happened between him and Tony, not even Natasha. Taking up the envelope in hand, Steve could feel a weight to it. Something else was inside. Opening the envelope seal, Steve took the letter our, slowly unfolding the trifold sheet and revealing a small note.
“Mmm, I like hearing you say my name all desperate and flustered, babe,” Tony remarked, and the next Steve felt was the man’s mouth on his, almost crashing their lips together as he captured every one of Steve’s moans.
"What was so special about that statue," Tony inquired after a moment. Steve felt a bit of embarrassment waft over him again, but he quelled it as much as he could.
“Mmm,” Steve moaned as he licked into the genius’s mouth once more, reveling in the sweet taste on Tony’s tongue.
“Honestly, Nick, you called me here for an urgent matter and this is it?” Tony stood then, turning for the door.
“Ride me,” Tony said, his hands gripping Steve’s waist tight. “Want to watch you bouncing on me,” he added, guiding Steve back until his ass brushed Tony’s sensitive and dripping cock.
“Hello,” the dark-haired man cooed, his hands up as a form of neutrality; he must have sensed Steve’s uneasiness.  Steve saw the man’s one palm wrapped with white gauzy fibers; he must have had his wounds dressed from when he sliced his hand on Steve’s scales. “I mean you no harm,” he added, taking a few steps towards the merman. Steve didn’t stray his gaze, keeping his blue eyes pinned on the man’s deep brown ones. Steve’s shoulder’s relaxed some, the warm hues of the man’s eyes bringing a calmness to the merman.
Tony stilled his hands then after a few moments, laughing lightly as well before he smoothed his palms over the fabric on Steve’s firm tummy. He took that time to just gaze up at Steve, feeling incredibly lucky having the man just like that. He’d never thought he would ever know what it would feel like to have his best friend also be his boyfriend. But now, Tony couldn’t imagine it any other way.
“Well I’m good. Two fingers are plenty,” Steve said bluntly, shifting down and swirling his hips to feel Tony’s fingers still buried in him. His entrance was fluttering loose, the friction barely there. “I can take you just like this.”  Without a word Tony freed his fingers, grabbing the warming gel to coat his aching cock. When Steve went to turn on his back, Tony stilled him with a hand.
“After the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D last year, I became a member of the CIA, though I still am an ambassador of sorts for the new and improved S.H.I.E.L.D,” she said, giving him a close-lipped smile.
“That’s alright. Steve, look at me,” Tony said softly, cupping the blonde’s defined jaw and moving it up, making Steve look up at him. “It doesn’t bother me, you know.”
That night, Steve went to bed wearing a lingerie garment Tony had given him before he had left. It was a wonderful light grey nightie with a combed cotton, jersey knit bodice that molded over his chest perfectly. The skirt of the gown was a wonderful silky, soft pink that billowed voluminously down to the blonde’s upper knees. Not only did the lingerie look absolutely stunning on Steve, but it also was a friendly reminder to super solder to not get caught up with worry about Tony’s love for him. How could he even humor the idea that Tony had fallen out of love with him when he had given Steve such a wonderful gift.
"Y-yes," Steve replied, not expecting Tony to be so open to him suddenly. "I cannot say I have ever had such emotions and feelings for another man before."
“Well, I figured we needed a little education on it,” he defended. “For me at least.” Steve obviously knew how sex worked, he didn’t live under a rock back in the 40s. He just wanted to be up to speed with all the terminology and such.
“I love you, Steve Rogers,” he said a little louder than before. “And like you had said the other day; I have no clue how it happened. But you have found your way into every cell of my being. You have become all that my heart beats for,” Tony added. So Steve’s ears weren’t tricking him. Tony loved him back, had gotten him this studio as a gift, not to kick him out. “I know you wanted to be back in Brooklyn as much as possible. It isn’t too far from the Tower, either. So, I thought you could come here whenever to work or get away for a while.”
“Pretty sure I can assume that.” Tony thought about how Steve hadn’t really shown any interest in anybody. And anyone who knew just a smidgen of history on America’s first superhero knew about Steve and Agent Peggy Carter’s virtuous yet tragic love. Besides that, Steve was reserved when it came to his romantic interests, at least when he was with Tony.
“Do you like me this way, love?” Steve asked then, doing something he knew the other man loved…dirty talk. “Do you like me at your gracious mercy, Tony? Hungry for everything you do to me? Wishing you’d have your way with me as I just take it all?”
“My God,” Tony breathed, his heart leaping beneath his ribcage as he tried to stay calm. He blinked a few times, even rubbing at his eyes with the heel of his hand as if that would clear his vision, the creature in front of him simply a mirage. Yet, the merman was still there, water glistening on his skin, his body contorting away from the sailors who had an assortment of weapons aimed at him. Clearing his throat, the inventor refocused, the foggy confusion and surprise of the situation being set aside in his mind.
“Well, I always figured mythical creatures had to be influenced from some sort of truth,” Bruce admitted with a small shrug. “Still it does not seem real; it is rather shocking.”
“The woman the headliners captured with me,” Tony spoke, sitting on the side of the bed. “I’ve known her for a while. We’re friends, Steve,” he laughed lightly. Steve gave him a sheepish grin, scratching at the back of his neck, embarrassed. “But she works at a place, is a head designer at a huge enterprise,” the brunette went on. “I needed her expert opinion on something that was the most important thing to me.” Tony reached for something in his pocket, taking out a small, gold antique box.
It was only a few days after that, that Tony decided it would be best that he actually find a change of scenery, the lab looking more and more like a medieval dungeon with each passing day. He figured fresh air might do him some good.
Tony fell asleep one night, after three nights of insomnia to find himself in a vivid realm that seemed to be tangible and real.
Tony stayed quiet for a moment before he leaned in and cradled Steve’s cheek in his palm, his thumb wiping at his beloved’s tear.
They spent a while reeling in and casting out, talking quietly, as if speaking any louder would disturb the peace of nature. They shifted between different baits, sometimes putting on a worm or minnow, which Tony still felt bad about. Even though they weren’t catching anything, Tony couldn’t believe the overall calmness he felt by being out in such a tranquil atmosphere. He only itched for his phone a few times, to check in on matters, or to see if for some reason Pepper got in contact with him. She’d only reached out to him for business matters. And Tony wasn’t going to attempt to talk with her about personal life matters. He learned his lesson the last time he tried. He just liked knowing that she was alright. That was something that would never change, no matter what their relationship title was.
He heard Pepper’s words whisper in his brain before he quickly disregarded them. “Tony,” Steve started a bit tentatively, and Tony quickly waved a hand, taking a breath, composing himself. He didn’t want Steve to feel bad for him, he wanted to let Steve know why he acted the way he did…for him to understand.
Steve felt himself finally tire again, and he went inside, treading softly up the wooden staircase. He went to the couch, only to stare at it. Folding the blanket and laying it on the back of the sofa, Steve looked over to the bed then. Tony told him he could sleep in the bed too, that he didn’t mind sharing it with Steve. He really should just sleep on the couch and let that be the end of it. Steve knew himself well enough to know that he would be sorrowful when tomorrow rolled around, and he would never be able to sleep in the same bed as Tony again. But, the temptation of being so close to Tony was much more overpowering, and Steve relented.
“Fair enough,” Tony said before pulling Steve close, his chest against the super soldier’s back. Steve breathed lightly, feeling fully content.
“Don’t fight me on this, Stark,” Steve playfully warned, brushing his hand against the genius’s. “I can’t wait for you to be mine and I to be yours,” the blonde added, his voice laden with a heavy emotion that settled viscerally in Tony’s bell and heart.
As if reading Steve’s mind, or rather his body language, the brunette retracted his hands from Steve’s chest, only to then trail his fingers under the fabric of his boyfriend’s nightie. Steve felt like he was floating as Tony’s nimble fingers traced over the contoured muscle of his sides, along his chiseled back, and to the waistline of his satin, cheeky styled panties.
“Oh God, you gonna ride me, baby?” Tony asked, his toes curling into the comforter at the image of Steve bouncing on him.  Steve didn’t say anything, he just smiled before popping the lube cap open, squirting an excessive amount of lubricant onto his fingers. Wasting no time, Steve took Tony into his hand, stroking him quickly with lube. “Oh, shit,” Tony said, closing his eyes tight while he held Steve’s hips in a death grip. It all just felt so good.
The genius watched, unmoving and enthralled while he saw Steve spread his legs, knees bent and feet propped against the mattress. The blonde continued to open the bottle of lubricant and spilled a large amount over his fingers and into his palm.
“Hey,” he breathed, eyes heavy lidded and practically glistening as he gazed down at Steve. The super soldier stopped moving, eyes looking up at Tony, a curious expression on his face.
“Only one finger, Steve? It’s gonna be painful,” Tony said, not wanting to hurt his boyfriend from not being stretched enough. Steve must have ignored everything he said though, because the next thing Tony did was moan, gritting his teeth as Steve slowly lowered himself down onto his erection.
“It’s a rather calming hobby once you get the hang of it,” Bruce explained while opening a gift from Thor.
“I’m perfect,” he answered, bracing on his elbows and leaning in to kiss Tony. “You never make me feel like I’m anything less than perfect, Tony.” The brunette hummed at that, his dark eyes searching Steve’s calm blue ones. Steve needed to not get wrapped up in his head, even if his thoughts were about his love for Tony. He was here, presently with the sexiest, most handsome man in the universe! He needed to get it together.
“Yes. Ehn, right there, Tony,” Steve said breathlessly, Tony brushing that sweet spot deep inside him continuously. The large bed slammed against the wall from Tony’s force as he indulged the blonde with deep sensuous strokes. With the brunette’s name rolling off Steve’s tongue, he came for the second time that night, his release shooting up his torso, sprinkling upon his pecs and even his clavicle. The ecstasy that trickled to every fiber of his being left Steve floating, like his body had transcended. Slowly, through the foggy cloud of his orgasm, he felt things still, and Steve opened his eyes to see Tony breathing deep, his eyes closed in what seemed like concentration.
He could feel one of Tony’s hands slide around to his bum, his hand gripping a cheek and not letting go as Steve gasped and leaned forward to kiss the man while also sticking his rump out, an invitation for Tony to keep up what he was doing. Tony growled against Steve’s mouth, biting the blonde’s lips and squeezing hard on Steve’s gorgeous ass
Steve wanted to be defiant, to knock this evil man to the ground and figure out his escape. But Steve knew better than to act impulsively in this situation; he couldn’t do much with a wounded hip and revolver to his head. He also couldn’t risk his pod, or the mission he had set out on.
Steve opened the door to Tony’s room only to see a large, dark brown wicker basket sitting upon the man’s bed. The blonde rushed over to it excitedly, almost tripping over his own feet. Sitting on the enormous and plush bed, Steve put all the goodies that were in his hands into the basket before he explored what else was nestled inside. There were a few chocolate bunnies, some extra jelly beans and foil covered eggs, as well as a bottle of what looked like thick brown paint. That wasn’t all though. Tony had put green plastic hay in the basket, and when Steve moved it aside, he revealed a rolled up garment, gently tied with a silk blue ribbon. He knew it wasn’t any regular article of clothing though; it was lingerie. Steve noticed a piece of thick cream colored paper underneath the ribbon, carefully removing it and reading what Tony had written inside.
“Anytime, Steve. I don’t know where you two boys would be without me,” she smirked before turning on the TV. “Mind some company?” Steve just chuckled. She really did know him well.  He had the tendency to be a little cowardly with Tony sometimes. Not that he was intimidating. But Steve knew Tony needed his time alone once and while, especially if he was having a surge of genius down in his workshop. He didn’t want to seem needy by calling and texting. He was afraid he would end up pushing Tony away.
Once Tony quieted, his hips finally stilling did Steve pull off of the brunette’s spent penis, his lips making a faint ‘pop’ as he did so. The super soldier gently cleaned Tony’s softening length, any residue of precome wiped away with Steve’s pink tongue.
Tony pulled away, pressing kisses down Steve’s neck and shoulder before eyeing the man’s chest. Wrapping one hand around Steve’s erection through the silk, Tony stroked him teasingly, figuring the feel of silk rubbing on his cock would feel pretty fantastic. And by the sounds Steve made, he didn’t think he was wrong. The brunette brought his other hand up further to tweak one of his boyfriend’s nipples, circling the dark pink nub with his fingertips as he continued to stroke Steve. He still rocked into Steve shallowly, not wanting to come before he and Steve were face to face. He was using every ounce of self-control to refrain from pounding into his love. It was a fucking challenge.
“Leave it, we’ll work on it later,” he replied. “You can stay down here if you want to sketch or something.” With that, Tony headed up in the elevator, gently banging his head on the cool metal doors of the car, doing his best to ignore the heat that was building deep in his belly. This had to pass, it needed to pass. He needed things to go back to the way they were, where he wasn’t swooning over the super soldier.
A loud crash and frantic voices jarred Tony back to the present, and soon enough, the brunette was hurrying toward the ruckus on the stern of the ship.
It was hard for Steve to not look at anything but himself, having to close his eyes for a few moments and allow his heightened senses of touch to conjure up the image of Tony absolutely ravaging him. The man’s fingers were like that of a musician, and Steve was his instrument, making the blonde sing in pure ecstasy as he arched into Tony’s touch suddenly. He wanted more, needed Tony to continue caressing his body with his skillful hands.
“T-Tony,” Steve said loudly, his eyes opening then to look at them in the midst of their love making. He wanted this, God how he wanted it. He wanted to feel the genius, to let the man mark him and claim him. Steve secretly loved Tony’s dirty talk, always enhancing his vernacular when they were both close to release. Tony rolled Steve’s nipples between nimble fingers, circling the rosy peaks of flesh then. It felt so damn good, having Tony’s hands on him that way, paying attention to his sensitive spots. He pushed his chest out for more of the man’s touch, only to shove his ass back to meet Tony’s bucking hips. He wanted Tony to be buried deep within him, and take all that he wanted of Steve.
“What I can’t try my genius brain at something as simple as cooking? Tony countered, flipping the omelet in the pan, half of the light-yellow crescent of eggs naturally flopping off the side of the skillet, cheese oozing out and onto the stove top. Steve pursed his lips to stifle his laugh. “Don’t you say a word,” Tony warned, a shit eating grin plastered on his face. “At least you see the proof that I in fact made you breakfast,” the brunette laughed.
“Of course,” Tony heard Steve reply, smiling easily at the dark-haired man who then beamed, absolutely elated that Steve would allow himself to be bound. “Wanna see me writhing under you, baby?” Steve asked, licking his lip unconsciously while looking at Tony from beneath his thick lashes. “You like how I am submissive only to you?” Steve, with his tied wrists, took one of Tony’s hands and brought it to his lips, kissing the rough palm a moment. Tony hummed in sweet bliss as Steve kissed gently at his palm, only to hitch a breath when he saw Steve slide one of the genius’s fingers into the warm heat of his mouth. Tony, hypnotized by the naughty sight, watched as Steve swirled his tongue around the subjected digit, feeling the wetness and soft scrape of teeth as the blonde worked. Tony’s pants were excruciatingly tight and whimpered out a small groan. Steve, the damn tease that he was, knew just how to get to the brunette.
Moments later, the doors to the elevator that held Steve and Tony closed just before Clint and Natasha’s elevator car made it to the communal floor, and both men burst into a fit of laughter, relief washing over them.
“Oh my God,” Steve cried, his eyes shut tight as he felt everything out. Tony pulled off then, nibbling at the leaking tip before taking Steve in once more. He opened his eyes when he heard his love gag, and Tony stilled his hips with a strong grip. Steve had been so beside himself he hadn’t realized he had been thrusting into Tony’s wet heat.
Tony gulped down a cup of coffee before making it to Steve’s floor, knocking lightly on the door. He stood there a moment before knocking once more, his brows furrowed. Could Steve be out already? He checked the time on his watch which read 5:58am. Hey, he was early! Tony heard footsteps then, the door opening to reveal a sleepy-eyed soldier.
“Well you were distant this whole week, barely messaging me or texting me back. Then you decide you want to video chat, Steve. Doesn’t that sound a little peculiar to you? Don’t you think I would worry that you were upset with me or something?” Tony said, crossing his arms over his chest as he eyed the man staring back at him in the screen. Steve continued to stare at him for what seemed like twenty-seven years, mouth agape. Steve took a deep breath then, pinching the bridge of his nose between two fingers before meeting the genius’s chocolatey gaze.
It was with that thought, as they held each other with an undeniable love and protection that Steve’s orgasm crashed into him, his body lifting up enough so that the head of Tony’s cock caught on his sloppy rim. He slammed back down, his body clamping snug around his beloved, the brunette crying out as his orgasm hit him as well. Tony’s seed spilled within Steve, the warm white release coating his insides. Steve’s body was vibrating with sensitivity and exhaustion, but none of that mattered while he observed the genius’s beautiful face as an abundance of euphoric ecstasy spread through his entire body.
Steve was arriving that evening though, and the genius was excited to arrange this little treat for the man.
“Uhn,” Steve whimpered, his hands bunching at the nightie he wore, pulling it to the front of him to keep the fabric out of Tony’s way.
A few months after that, he and Pepper broke up. And Tony's mind continued to torture him as the little thoughts he had entertained about he and Pepper being soulmates fizzled out like suffocated ember. It wasn’t good for him to be in the mansion all alone, he knew that. He needed to just make the move to the new Avengers tower and get it all fixed up. The brunette kept dragging his feet though; he just wasn’t ready. There was a part of him that believed Pepper would come back, that they'd work things out.
Footsteps could be heard from outside Steve’s room then, and suddenly the door opened to reveal the man from the ship, the one that saved him! However, Steve was still cautious, sitting stock still, his body on alert in case he had to defend himself.
“Oh,” Tony smirked, the fingers of his one hands carding into the cropped hair at the back of Steve’s head. “Just thinking about how even with morning breath you’re still the most beautiful man I know.” Steve just gave him a playful glare, flicking Tony on the chest.
“Here, allow me,” Tony whispered, fully enthralled with his lover. The brunette slipped the hoodie off of Steve’s shoulders, letting the thick fabric fall away, exposing the upper lingerie garment Steve wore. “Do you like it?” Tony queried.
The genius rested his forehead on the nape of the blonde’s neck, breathing deeply as he focused on all the pleasures that took hold of him. He felt the tightness of Steve’s body as he penetrated him, the warm, damp skin of the super soldier’s muscular back flush against his chest. Tony took in the scent of the man he loved, an enticing aroma of sweat, spice and sandalwood. The lust of their intimate moments was always ethereal and unlike Tony had ever known… but the love they shared would always be the most sacred and cherished sentiment he and Steve could give each other.
“I-I don’t want to break the ribbon, though,” Steve finally said, falling back to the present then. “You wouldn’t really want that either, would you, baby?” Steve inquired with a smirk. “You want me at your mercy, desperate for release, for your touch. As I fight to hold off from breaking the restraint…to stay submissive.” Tony’s head was reeling at the intimate, sexual words Steve spoke, the image coming into focus behind his eyes as Tony groaned lowly, his pants tenting up instantly. Steve took that opportunity to cant his hips up, pressing his hardening erection against Tony’s, who couldn’t help but to buck forward, the friction overwhelming.
“Captain Rogers has arrived to his quarters, and it appears he has found the gift that you had placed on his bed,” J.A.R.V.I.S responded. “Shall I inform him of your whereabouts?”
“Thanks, Steve. I’m glad I could share this with you too.” With that, they nestled into their bed and couch, Steve shutting off the floor lamp next to him.
“That’s a bit of an understatement, don’t you think?” Tony smirked, helping Steve turn over to face him. The blonde was so beautiful, his fair hair in disarray, blue eyes bright, lips red and puffy from Tony’s own. Tony snuggled close to the super soldier, a hand slipping down Steve’s messy belly.
“Well, I guess that’s true. And I really appreciate the attempt,” Steve said, giggling lightly as he watched Tony work.
Extremely curious, Tony sifted through the white tissue paper in the box, revealing the gift beneath. A rubber strand with an assortment of beads ranging from teeny, to large rested in the box, a big ring attached to the one end of it. It took the genius a good moment to realize the intimate toy before he felt a heat flush his cheeks, and his eyes grow wide.
Steve nosed his way underneath Tony’s aching erection and licked at the engorged vein, gilding his tongue from root to tip over the elevated ridge. The brunette’s beautiful whimpers and sighs of desperation only spurred Steve on as he kissed and sucked at each of Tony’s testicles, enjoying the slightly textured skin. He then licked at the seam down the middle of the man’s sac before he felt them tighten under his mouth. The super soldier immediately took Tony’s cock in between his lips once more, letting the shaft fill his mouth until his nose was brushing against the genius’s dark, trimmed pubic hair.
“God, I’m getting old,” Tony said, stretching his back, which was aching now. Steve, still sitting on the bed, snaked his arms around Tony’s waist, peppering his back with open mouthed kisses.
he yelled to himself. Tony was fresh from a break up with the woman he thought he was going to marry. He needed to respect the man, not fantasize about them together. Quickly turning the water colder, Steve rinsed the soap from his body. Plus, Tony obviously didn’t have feelings for Steve. If he did, wouldn’t his playboy title fall into play now?
“You always have my heart Tony. I’ll always stick by you, don’t ever doubt that,” Steve cooed, tilting Tony’s chin so the man would look at him. When their gaze finally locked Steve smiled, leaning up to kiss him flush on the lips once more before drifting his hands to the belt of Tony’s pants. “Now I need to get you out of these.” Steve unlatched the buckle, only to undo the top button before lowering the zipper down and over the curve of Tony’s erection. Tony kicked out of his pants and boxer briefs, tossing them to the floor before gently nudging Steve to turn on his belly.
“Oh, well makes sense. Anyways, you’re about to have some company,” he sing-songed, eyeing the balcony that led to her apartment suite. She didn’t even have time to answer before he hovered over the platform of her balcony, plopping down on it with a metal thud.
Only when his fingers grazed one of Steve’s knuckles did he realized he was actually reaching for the man’s hand. Quickly, Tony grabbed one of those abandoned popcorn kernels on Steve’s leg, and popped it into his mouth. Steve moved his eyes away from the television then, looking quizzically at Tony when the brunette had touched him.
Laying back against the pillows, Steve pulled Tony on top of him, finding the brunette’s lips once again. The blonde’s hands roamed over every inch of his love’s body, holding onto Tony’s sinewy, muscular back, fingers digging into damp skin. Steve’s thighs clamped against the genius’s sides, knees bent and toes curled as Tony trailed wet, hot kisses along Steve’s neck and defined jaw.
“I know, but I really want you to come while I’m deep in you,” Tony admitted, kissing at the base of Steve’s neck.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Tony asked, his voice shrill. Steve didn’t answer him though, continuing to stare straight ahead. “God, you’re so fucking stubborn, Steve.”
The genius couldn’t get enough of watching Steve fuck himself on his length, the man’s muscular body roiling with heat. How the blonde moved so beautifully on him, his abdominal muscles stretching under sweaty, flushed skin, his thighs clenching each time he lifted his ass off of the brunette before slamming back down onto him. And Tony was in awe when Steve arched into his touch as he plucked and scraped a nail over that sensitive nipple. He would never tire from a such a sight.
“Why don’t you make yourself useful and start up a pot of coffee,” Natasha scolded, glaring at the man until he hurdled to his feet and got to work prepping the coffee.
Steve looked at the screen inquisitively, seeing his stretched entrance slick with lube, the gel seeping out and around the beads and onto his upper thighs and pillow. The blonde watched how his body resisted the last and largest bead before finally relenting and slipping within him at last.
“Uhn, Tony!” Steve said loudly, pressing his cheek against Tony’s and wishing the man would penetrate him already. He was panting hard, wrapping his arms around the brunette’s neck as he held on for dear life, trying his best not to orgasm.
Neither of them spoke, both riding the waves of pure bliss for as long as they could. “Damn,” Steve huffed out after minutes ticked by, his body floating down from his high.
“Ready for a mid-morning nap?” Steve joked, his one leg slipping between the brunette’s. he figured Tony was jet lagged and exhausted from traveling, as well as the trip itself.
“Will you lay on your stomach for me, babe?” The brunette cooed, his hands reaching slightly beneath the waistband of Steve’s panties, squeezing at the super soldier’s bum. The blonde abided, humming gleefully as he turned over, rump up in the air rather temptingly.
“Just a little longer,” Steve cooed, turning Tony around so that he faced the back of the couch. The super solider slid to the floor, spreading Tony’s knees so that he could have clear view of the man’s entrance. Steve watched as the man’s hole, dark pink and waiting, clenched in front of his eyes. Steve wanted to taste it.
And when they physically became one, their gaze meeting one another's, they united emotionally, mentally, and even spiritually, the feelings reflecting the others. Their love reached a metaphysical state, their heavy breathing and moans of euphoria a melody all their own.
Steve’s mind and body were drained, that third orgasm wringing all the energy that remained out of him. Clearly not thinking about anything in depth, the super soldier didn’t realize his love hadn’t come yet until Tony moved a little inside of him.
Steve wiggled beneath Tony’s fingertips, his breath mere pants as he felt his love’s lips slowly dip lower down his body. He carded his hands into Tony’s thick dark hair as the man sucked at his clavicle, his beard scraping against Steve’s skin. He looked down, his blue eyes just a sliver around his blown pupils, seeing how Tony’s lips left searing heat down his chest.
“No, not at all,” he teased, threading his fingers through his boyfriend’s damp hair. “I loved it,” he said quietly then. “I am so glad you feel safe and comfortable around me. So much so that you revealed this aspect of your life.” He tilted Steve’s chin up so that the man would look at him. “You can always be yourself with me, Steve. I love everything about you.” He placed a gentle kiss on the blonde’s forehead, sitting up to slip Steve’s lingerie off of him. “Also, I wasn’t lying when I said I would buy the entire male lingerie inventory. You just say the word.” Tony held up the pretty garment that was in desperate need of being dry cleaned.
At the front desk, an older man with a friendly smile was filling the minnow tank. He kindly showed both Steve and Tony how the fishing poles worked, probably judging them quietly for being so incompetent. Steve watched carefully how to tie the hooks and lures on, and listened intently when the man, who they learned was named Jerry, said what bait they should use depending on the fish they wanted to catch.
“Oh, nothing over the top,” Tony replied, trying to be casual. “Typical relationship gifts from the boyfriend,” he added. And when Bruce stared at him, waiting for him to explain what it was, Tony plainly remarked, “cuff links.”
Tony had eventually fallen asleep, his upper half bent in a rather uncomfortable position on the edge of the Steve's hospital bed. He was startled awake by something touching his hair, and as the distortion of sleep ebbed, Tony opened his eyes. He smiled gently, his heart fluttering alight as he realized Steve was combing a hand in his hair.
Tony took in a deep breath, sighing as he scrubbed a hand over his face, feeling the bristle of cropped facial hair on his palm. He looked around the ship before staring out at the beautiful, sparkling sea ahead, the sun radiating on the water and dancing upon the waves. How small and insignificant he felt in that moment.
When the brunette pulled away for Steve’s round, muscular pectorals, he nosed his way up to Steve’s mouth, kissing the super soldier quickly before his hands slithered back to where the corset ribbons were, and he let his fingers slip down each and every lacing that crisscrossed down Steve’s defined back. It still astounded Tony, to see such a strong, masculine man such as Steve look absolutely striking in delicate, feminine garments. It was the perfect balance though, the way the silks and lace molded over chiseled muscles and the defined contours of Steve’s frame. They were the perfect complement to each other.
“I’m just messing with you. Hey, this bed is super comfy. I’m not gonna lie, I’m glad you insisted on the couch,” Tony said, laying amongst the plush white comforter and pillows, stretching out on it like a cat.
“Tony, please,” Steve pleaded, his voice a whisper. He wanted Tony to penetrate him with tongue then, something Steve never thought he would ever want, or admit openly. But it was Tony, his boyfriend, the man that he loved fully.
"You were walking through the ancient era exhibit, turned white as a ghost and-" Natasha explained before Sam chimed in
“It is,” Steve replied shyly, finally looking to his boyfriend. “I do like when you take control,” Steve admitted. “I don’t know why, I just do.” Tony saw how his love looked ashamed. That, that wasn’t what Tony wanted to happen when having this conversation.
“Feels pretty good, huh?” Tony murmured as he listened to Steve’s blissful pants and sighs. “I can’t believe how snug you are, love,” he added, leaning back some to see how Steve’s rim hugged around his three fingers, excess lube seeping out.
“How obvious is it?” Tony said, checking a few emails on his phone before they went into the wilderness, where technology probably didn’t exist.
“Hey, handsome,” Steve greeted, taking off his gloves, coat and scarf before giving Tony a peck on the cheek.
“Here,” Tony cooed, guiding Steve into a new position. “Lay on your side for me?” The blonde did as he was asked, rolling onto his right side while Tony slicked more lube into his hand. Steve watched Tony sidle up behind him, pressing against the super soldier’s gorgeous back.
“He could say no and avoid me for the rest of his life,” Tony muttered, looking at some of the other guests in the restaurant. “I don’t want to ruin our close friendship by trying to make it something more. I just can’t risk that.”
“C’mere,’ Steve mumbled, exhaustion from their love making as well as jet lag hitting him tenfold then. He pulled the brunette against him, the two of them snuggling affectionately under the thin sheet. “I love you, Tony,” Steve kissed Tony’s hair, looking up at the white string of lights above them.
“Well I love you, even when you smell like you’ve been sweating for a week,” Steve laughed lightly, pressing another kiss to his love’s lips.
“Tony,” he said, leaning a hip against the wall next to Steve. The brunette folded his arms across his chest, glancing at the floor boards. “Tony Stark.” Steve nodded, remembering the name “Stark” on the side of the ship earlier.
The couple stayed quiet, their hands caressing sweaty, flushed skin, breathing the same air as they smiled sleepily. Tony eventually slipped himself free from his boyfriend, and Steve let out a small whimper, his hole winking, wanting to have something to clench around. The blonde reached for Tony’s hand, guiding it to his entrance. It took the genius a moment to understand what Steve wanted until his finger slipped inside his wet opening and the super soldier sighed sweetly, his muscles quivering around the lithe digit. Tony continued to stroke inside his love, feeling Steve melt against his chest. Tony was the one to find his voice first, petting Steve’s hair then with his free hand. “I’m never going to get over seeing you this way, Steve,” he breathed, massaging the blonde’s stretched, glistening rim.
“Mmmm, you’re the only one who does,” Steve said in a hushed tone, cheeks reddening by the second. He felt Tony lift the back of his slip so that he could play with his bum some more, only to stop when he felt the fabric of the panties.
“Hey yourself,” Tony replied, patting the couch cushion next to him as he sat down. “How are your art projects coming along?”
“You know I don’t like being called that,” the fair-haired woman remarked, a coy smile on her lips. Tony huffed a small laugh.
“You shouldn’t wipe down your chest, I like seeing you all dirty like that,” Tony said, winking at his boyfriend before pulling his boxers back up. He made a mental note to have housekeeping do some serious dry cleaning when he left.
Tony giggled excitedly, loving how desperate Steve was becoming. He knew exactly what the man wanted, and Tony would oblige, eventually. He nuzzled in against Steve’s opening once more, blowing on it teasingly, Steve moaning so beautifully for him as he did so. He watched as the man’s hole quivered as he blew on it once more, the tight pink skin wet from his tongue. “You liking me down here, eating your ass, Steve?” Tony asked huskily, rubbing his facial hair roughly along the insides of Steve’s’ lush ass cheeks.
Hours ticked by slowly. Tony never left however, only to use the bathroom. Natasha and Sam came in every now and then to check on he and Steve. Bruce brought the brunette a few big cups of coffee, which Tony was very grateful for.
Grabbing Steve up in his arms, he smiled mischievously. “Well maybe we should finish up our date now,” Tony offered. And before Steve could say anything about debriefing, Tony blasted off into the air, holding Steve securely as he flew.
Steve yearned for Tony to take him, roughly, lovingly and without haste, to make love to him until their intimacy had become the fabric of their cells, meshing together in an imprinting serenade. They’d be one, where there was no definite line of where one started and the other stopped.
Leaning up then, Steve licked and suckled at the chocolate that covered Tony’s lower back, his tongue caressing each bump and divot of the man’s spine. Tony sighed, fisting the cushion back as Steve got closer to his rump.
"Thanks," Steve said, drinking half the bottle in one long swallow. He wiped at the sweat on his bow and glanced around him. Natasha and Sam watched, both not saying anything as they waited for Steve to gain his bearings. The super soldier still felt ill, his head heavy, mind foggy, and all thought of was the dream, that vivid vision that seemed like a historical accurate glimpse of real people...people he knew. How could he know people who lived 2,500 years? Why did their soulmate origin matter?
“Oh.” Tony looked away then, pursing his lips together and pretending to be interested in the information on one of the cleaning solution boxes.
“Mhmm,” Steve said triumphantly, breathing a little hard, but smiling widely as he looked to Tony. The brunette felt his heart swell at the sight. Part of it was because he was able to give Steve a break from Avenger stuff. But the other part of it was because of how happy the man was. Seeing Steve smiling as he held up his fish, a few blonde strands falling over his forehead under that fishing hat as the sun set behind them brought forth a warmth within his chest.
Tony nodded. “As you’ve always been mine,” he replied in but a whisper. He dropped his hands to his side. “And you know you’re more than welcome to stay here with me. I’ve got that extra room in the penthouse,” Tony offered, his demeanor and emotions more collected. Pepper only smiled.
With bubbles billowing in the perfectly warm water, Steve and Tony settled inside it, Tony in front of Steve, his chest pressed to the smaller man’s back. He wrapped his arms around Tony’s middle, securing the man in his embrace.
“You seemed to have missed something,” Thor’s voice called, knocking Steve from his maudlin thinking. Steve looked back under the tree to see a cream envelope, his name scrawled out in Tony’s writing. He swallowed thickly, nerves heaping inside him. Steve was also shocked to think that the brunette had stationary laying around before wondering what the letter had read. Probably something along the lines of Tony wanting nothing to do with Steve.
“Wow, a cock that’s prettier than mine,” Tony commented, a finger tracing the underside of it, causing Steve’s hips to buck. He was overly sensitive at this point, wanting to come desperately.
“I feel good about it,” Steve huffed out, his arms wrapping tightly around the brunette. He opened his eyes to see Tony staring down at him, a faint curve of a smile on his lips. And Steve held his gaze, his blue eyes large, pupils blown.
“I liked that,” Steve bit out between sharp breaths, his orgasm right there waiting to push him over the edge. Tony pulled away from ravishing the blonde’s behind to catch his breath.
“I am beyond happy that you are home with me now,” Steve spoke after a brief silence, the streaks of sunlight shifting on the bed, the curtains swishing gently from the air conditioner kicking on.
He reminded himself once more that he would see Steve soon enough, when he got his shit together and stifled all of Pepper’s irrational words about his feelings towards the super soldier. Tony yawned then, carrying the plate and mug to a semi clean work station, neglecting that pesky formula for the moment. Biting into the sandwich, Tony groaned in delight at how good it was. Steve and his secret skills, like frying bacon to the perfect crispiness.
All he could do was tinker, to keep the panic attacks and nightmares away. As he worked, Tony unknowingly kept randomly touching his inner shoulder, where the soul mark was placed on the characters in his dream.
With everything seemingly in place, Tony fluffed up the pillows and lush blankets he’d spread out for him and Steve’s cuddling later. And if Steve was in the mood for more, Tony would most certainly not complain. He even brought a lube bottle up…it never hurt to be prepared.
Though he was also extremely sleepy, his body drained from all they’d done together, Steve couldn’t help but think how incredibly blessed he was. Never had he thought that he and Tony would be together this way, intimately holding one another and sharing a bed as boyfriends.
He looked at the white lights that twinkled in the reflection of the glass windows, observing how they twinkled amongst gold and red decorations. Steve laughed softly then, thinking of how something as simple as Iron Man colored decorations could bring his mind back to the brunette. He tried not to let it wear on him, thinking about who had caught Tony’s eye. It obviously wasn’t Steve’s business, and he should be happy for the man, finally trying to find love again after his heart wrenching break up with Ms. Potts. Tony was finally moving on, and Steve really needed to move on as well. His besotted feelings for Tony were never going to be more than that, a one-sided crush. Steve took a swig of his beer, enjoying the slight bitterness and yeasty mellow taste.
"It means I have a soulmate too. And I know who it is," Tony explained, pinching the bridge of his nose in frustration.
Cleaning up his brushes and painting area, Steve couldn’t help but smile to himself, thinking about spending alone time with his love. Since they began their relationship, they hadn’t had the chance to spend a lot of quality time together, their missions becoming more frequent. But Avenger responsibilities had died down a bit finally, so Steve and Tony decided to make up for lost time and cherish a quiet evening together.
Tony was beyond astounded, a creature of myth right before his very eyes. He was a scientist, a creator and logical man. And yet there was a mythical creature, a legend of fallacy and fantasy here now in the modern age of enlightenment and evolution. The brunette was both baffled and awed as he continued till the last bit of rope that tethered the merman’s arms fell heavily to the wooden deck.
“Love you too, baby. You’re perfect, Steve,” Tony whispered, hands lifting Steve’s pretty jaw so that he could look at Tony. He let his hands then roam over the blonde’s body, teasing the man’s hardened nipples and feeling every dip in his chiseled abs. “But, even if you were still the way you were before Project Rebirth, I would still love you fully,” Tony said, catching Steve’s eyes. “Cause of this,” he added, pressing a rough hand against Steve’s chest, feeling his strong heartbeat thrumming underneath. “I hope you know that.”
“I was,” Tony started, pressing a soft kiss to the back Steve’s neck. “But since it’s my company, I can basically do whatever I want, right?” he finished, resting his chin on Steve’s shoulder the best he could.
“You boys aren’t from around here are you?” Jerry asked, scooping up some minnows into a bucket for them.
Sucking at that muscle to loosen it just a moment longer, Tony trailed a hand between the blonde’s legs, pressing at Steve’s perineum with his forefinger, massaging at the prostate from outside. Steve immediately pressed his lower belly against the pillows, rutting and sprinkling flowing precome onto the cotton. Steve wasn’t going to last much longer, the brunette was sure and he took his other hand and placed it on the man’s hipbone, gently massaging the skin there as a reminder to Steve that Tony was right there with him.
,” he begged, his arms falling to his sides, hands grasping at the fabric, bunching it up in his fists as he pushed down on his love’s fingers, wanting to be consumed by the man. Tony tantalized him a little longer, swirling his fingers in circular motions, spreading them wide inside the blonde and eliciting sweet moans from him.
Grabbing Steve by the legs then, Tony slid off the bed, pulling his blonde boyfriend to the edge. “So, this is all about pleasing me today huh, Stevie?” Tony inquired, pressing his tongue and teeth at the inside of one of Steve’s muscular, yet soft thighs.
“Yes, Tony,” Steve responded, his voice breathy and slightly winded from his climax still. Steve smiled tiredly when he felt Tony shift above him, the genius’s lips finding their way to Steve’s damp hairline. The brunette kissed the super soldier’s temple, his hands slipping down Steve’s neck and to the slope of his shoulders. Even though Steve’s body felt heavy, the blonde managed to lift an arm and place his hand on his beloved’s.
“Yeah, sure sure, I’ll have my people call your people,” Tony remarked to the man who was still talking like his life depended on it. With that, Tony moved through the crowd of black suits and expensive gowns as he headed towards the blonde. He couldn’t help but smile as he neared the man, seeing Steve in a dapper uniform, wearing his medals as he sported his hair in an old-fashioned style was enough to make even Tony’s belly flop with nerves.
Steve created a plate of food for the genius, the lunch consisting of a BLT, cut apple slices and a cup of fresh black coffee. He’d done this friendly gesture many times before, when Tony had a genius streak down in his lab. But now since his feelings had progressed beyond platonic, he was afraid everything he did revealed his true feelings. Steve shook his head, sighing at his idiocy before regaining his composure and descending the elevator that would lead him to Tony’s workshop. Steve also had a backup plan. If things became too awkward between them, or more if Steve became awkward, he would tell Tony they should do some Avenger training with the team as soon as possible.
Tony could see the outline of Steve’s penis pressing beneath the fabric, and his eyes traveled up, over his boyfriend’s firmly defined abdomen and to his lace covered pectorals. The genius was practically drooling over his love. Steve was all his…as he was all Steve’s.
Beside himself with pleasure, Steve tried to level out his breathing as Tony worked his magic over him. Steve blindly stroked at Tony’s silky dark hair as he stared up at the warm lights above him, twinkling in the mesh net canopy over their bed. The moon shone big and brightly, and for a brief moment the super soldier feared someone would see them through the glass before remembering that his beloved was in fact a genius and ensured their privacy.
“Sir?” J.A.R.V.I.S suddenly spoke, disrupting their intimacy. Steve’s body was lax, his chest heaving with each breath as Tony growled in annoyance.
“Do it, baby,” Tony cooed, licking and suckling at the skin under Steve’s left ear, his beard tickling the blonde slightly. “Let go for me, let me see you fall apart in my arms.” Tony dropped the hand on his chest and wrapped it around Steve’s leaking erection, stroking it with a tight fist.
Steve thought he forgot to breathe, inhaling sharply when he heard approaching footsteps behind him. He turned abruptly, seeing Tony leaning in against the threshold of the doorway.
It wasn’t that they didn’t hardly see each other or anything, it was just hard having Tony away from him for almost a whole week.
Steve could barely think as he laid his head in the crook of Tony’s shoulder and neck, wanting to feel every part of the man as he pounded into his ravaged entrance.
The joy that hummed through the room as Thor, Clint, Natasha, and Bruce opened their gifts from each other was energizing. And though he was sad that Tony decided to not join in, Steve was truly elated. They were all rather surprised to find out that Bruce crocheted, each of them getting a warm blanket.
“Mhmm,” Steve mumbled, closing his eyes and pushing back into Tony’s hands, wanting more of that touch. Tony obliged only quickly, slipping his hands under the shorts to give each cheek a firm squeeze and place a kiss at the small of Steve’s back before standing up and moving away.
“W-what is...what may I call you, merman?” The man finally stammered out. Steve looked back up at him, gently laying a hand on his bandaged side before answering.
“You can,” Steve said, leaning down to lick a stripe up Tony’s belly and chest before finding his lips once more. “But I’m not done with you just yet,” Steve said, voice low, commanding as he suckled at Tony’s bottom lip while grinding his silk covered erection in against Tony’s, causing both of them to moan loudly.
So with Tony gone for almost a week on business, Steve was having a difficult time. He didn’t like waking up alone to a cold side of the bed where his handsome boyfriend was supposed to be. Didn’t like walking down to Tony’s lab only to see it dark inside. And he especially didn’t like how quiet the tower was without him, no snarky comments or obnoxious bickering between Tony and Clint.
“No, I don’t think so,” he said after a pause. “I only saw because you bent over. But do you normally wear lingerie under your uniform?”
Steve remembered his mother, with her arms wrapped around his delicate frame as they watched the stars glimmering in the sky. He remembered her tired eyes from double shifts at the hospital, her light hair braided over a shoulder. Still, she stayed up with him those nights till his asthma subsided or his fever broke, and he was able to sleep once more.
A gentle snow fell over Avengers Tower in the middle of December. The interior of the space was decorated with all the festive trimmings. Garland hung in thick green strands, and mistletoe was nestled over random doorways. And the Avengers team gathered around an enormous Christmas tree in the communal area, passing around a basket with each individual’s name inside it. The team had agreed on exchanging gifts as Secret Santas, and when the basket reached Steve, he eagerly stuck his hand inside, shuffling the papers around before plucking up one of the folded pieces. He couldn’t help but to chuckle lightly when he saw Tony’s name on the paper he picked. Quickly he put the paper in his pocket as the cogs in his mind turned, trying to figure out a gift idea for his boyfriend; he had already bought a few gifts for the genius.
“I’m totally gonna harp on you!” He yelled, the door closing. Steve just rolled his eyes, shifting his shield from one hand to the other.
“Hey you,” Tony breathed, wiggling closer to his boyfriend so that he could wrap an arm around Steve’s waist.
His boyfriend’s moans were muffled, and Steve lifted his head a brief moment to get a glimpse of Tony biting the cushion, his forehead pressed to the back of couch, eyes shut tight. Steve nibbled at Tony’s entrance a few more times, brushing his wet teeth along it before moving back and standing to his feet, legs shaky.
“Steve,” Tony said then, his voice resonating against him as he nibbled at the ring of loosening muscle. The blonde didn’t even say anything besides a sultry whimper. “I want you to jerk yourself off while I finish eating you out. Will you do that for me?” Tony asked, rubbing his facial hair over Steve’s bum. And the super soldier just hissed at the pleasurable scratch the man’s beard provided before shifting on the bed a bit, reaching a hand between his legs to stroke himself.
Slowly, the rest of the crew had found their way down, Bruce quietly helping make plates for everyone as Steve flipped the last few pancakes. Thor made up for Bruce’s soft nature with boisterous tales of battle while he poured coffee into mismatched mugs.
“Morning, Cap,” Tony began, smiling warmly at him, though his eyes were probably dull with tiredness as well. “Nothing’s wrong. I just wanted to swing by before you headed out for the day,” Tony added. Steve just looked at him, eyes squinted, his hair splayed every which way. He looked like an unimpressed kid, woken up early for school. He even had those plaid flannel pajamas, where the shirt buttoned up and had matching bottoms. How could a grown man look so boyish?
“The beast has been defeated,” Thor remarked, pointing with Mjolnir behind him, revealing the dead creature, its mouth open, its glossy black eyes lifeless. “If either of you care,” he mumbled. Natasha and Clint arrived shortly after, looking at the slain creature as well.
say anything for a minute, his mind and body slowly coming down from their high…It was as if they were on two different plains, the subconscious and heart lazily falling back into synchronization with each other.
“Well, considering there isn’t a scrap left on my dish,” I say you did extremely well,” Steve cooed, leaning over on his chair and giving his boyfriend a loving smooch. The brunette hummed in delight, smiling into the kiss and reaching a hand up to cradle one of the blonde’s sculpted cheeks.
“Merfolk know of you...humans I mean,” Steve explained, coughing a bit. Though he could breathe out of water, it was extremely uncomfortable after a while. His lungs and gills worked in unison, and when Steve felt that the cloths under his ribs were almost dry, he felt a panic surge through him.
Steve, who had his eyes closed for quite some time finally opened them, looking at Tony with complete trust and love. He tugged at his hole, hooking his fingers up and hitting his sweet spot while he brought his other hand down and stroked his weeping cock a few more times. With a sharp intake of breath and a strangled cry, Steve came hard, head falling back against the pillows, mouth parted beautifully. Thick ropes of white come shot up his abs and torso, a few droplets finding their way into the hollows of the man’s clavicle.
Now, as he laid there in the chambers of the vessel, Steve truly hoped he would see that man one more time. To thank him for his kindness, and maybe he would be able to help Steve get off the boat too somehow.
Tony felt himself nearing the edge. Steve was just too damn beautiful; he couldn’t take it. He saw Steve curl his fingers up, tugging at his rim while he moaned Tony’s name over and over. Adding a third finger inside him, Tony watched how the man’s hole hugged around his fingers tightly, lube squirting out between his fingers as Steve penetrated himself deeply. Tony wanted to lap it up with his tongue, feel Steve’s entrance clenching around him.
Tony crashed his lips against Steve’s without a moment’s notice and kissed his lover breathless. Tony’s hands roamed over Steve’s taut body, feeling the silk and chiffon of the super soldier’s nightie underneath his palms, Steve’s muscles shifting under the lingerie fluidically
I finally after a million years figured out how to embed an image! Here is a sketch request I had done by K-atnight on tumblr!
"Tony," Steve began to speak once more. "It's nice to meet you, but umm, why'd Fury send you here?" The super soldier asked, clearly confused. Tony turned to face him then, their gaze locking together. Strange as it was, Steve felt a peculiar sense of familiarity with the brunette... as if they met before. The blonde could only assume it was because Tony was so much like his dad.
“You owe me nothing, Steve,” the brunette replied, his voice sweet and his tone soft. With that, the man turned around, and headed out, closing the door behind him.
Steve was beside himself with pleasure, the head of his erection almost purple as it leaked a stream of precome onto his stomach. The way Tony’s mouth and tongue roamed over his entrance and perineum was indescribable, and Steve couldn’t help but whine and pant the entire time as he tried to hold off from tipping over the edge. It was then that he felt Tony’s tongue finally slip into his opening, the slick heat of it swirling in against his snug channel. Steve shut his eyes feeling all that Tony provided him, his mind wandering to the image of Tony’s face buried in his rump, his tongue skillfully licking his entrance, making the blonde a writhing mess. It was then, when Tony caressed his hole, his tongue hooking up into Steve’s body to loosen his rim that Steve’s orgasm hit him. Tony’s name tumbled from his lips as his seed spilled on his belly, tricking into his abdominals while Tony continued to lap at his hole.
“I’ve been wanting to ask you something, my love,” Tony started, laying a hand on one of Steve’s still clothed thighs. When Steve just looked at him, Tony continued. “When we have sex, I have noticed that you seem to take great pleasure when I act more, assertive…” Tony trailed off, trying to gage Steve’s expression. The blonde’s cheeks were pink, and his eyes looked down. “Is that something we can talk about?”
“I know, I know,” Tony said, quickly popping the cap of the lube and squeezing a good-sized amount on his fingers. He then wiggled his way between Steve’s spread legs and began massaging the blonde’s opening with a slick finger. The man wasn’t as tight as usual, and so the genius easily pressed the digit inside his boyfriend’s body. Tony wanted to prep Steve just a bit before he went ahead and inserted the first bead of the toy.
“What’re you up to?” The blonde asked, grinning. Tony responded by rolling to the side table, grabbing one of the many different lubricants that were harbored inside.
“Gorgeous, breathtaking,” Tony cooed, rubbing at the straining ring of muscle, creating a plethora of sensations within Steve’s body. The super solider bit his lip as he gazed at Tony’s fingers playing with him before he leaned his head back against the pillows, the image in the camera setting him on edge.
An alarm sounded then, and it was a high-risk Avenger blare. "Guess this'll have to wait," Tony said as they both left their personal matters behind and readied to depart for the threatened area.
Steve dipped his head back down to lap at the chocolate sauce that covered the man’s lower belly, only to then lick Tony’s upper thighs. Steve liked how the fine hair there tickled his tongue as he nipped at the chocolatey flesh. A few marks for the morning were alright, he figured, as Tony was writhed underneath him then, wanting Steve to quit teasing.
“Thank you, Tony, for all that you did back there...on the deck. You have been the only one to show me kindness. Well, I presume the doctor who patched me up must be quite considerate too,” Steve responded, eyes cast down a moment before they flicked up to the man’s own deep irises.
Closing his eyes, Tony allowed himself to be taken by the sensory of touch and sound, his and Steve’s moaning forming a tune unique to their love story.
The sun was setting, an orange glow muted by the tinted windows of the tower. Steve asked J.A.R.V.I.S to light the fire in the fireplace that was beneath the TV. The gas lit and the heated flames danced around, casting elongated shadows in the room.
“I can think of a few ways that I could assist you with that,” Steve said, pinning Tony between the elevator and his body, kissing him heatedly. He pulled away once the elevator dinged. “I’ll be here waiting for you when you get back. Maybe even wearing that silky slip you love so much,” Steve winked when Tony stepped into the elevator.
“Alright, lavender it is.” Slowly, Tony leaned forward, his lips exploring over Steve’s faintly, and the blonde pressed his forehead against his beloved’s.
Walking up to their room which was room number 4, Steve took in all the old woodwork, dark carpeting and multiple black and white photographs that peppered the wallpapered walls. It reminded him of Brooklyn, when he would go with Bucky to his grandma’s house. It was just like this, tastefully dated amongst an evolving culture.
He watched the blonde wipe down his torso with the shirt when excess oil had seeped through the fabric and onto his skin. Steve was talking, but Tony didn’t hear him, his eyes pinned on the man’s pectorals. Tony wondered how different they would feel from a female’s, the muscles firm under taut skin and so enticing to caress. Tony’s gaze lingered upon Steve’s nipples then. They were petal pink, and so perky. Tony had this roiling desire to pluck and toy with them with his fingers. He wondered how they’d feel, pebbled and hard as he touched them, wondered how fast they would redden from all his teasing…
“Whatever, I still have pillows and the mattress,” Tony replied, sitting up then and looking to the super soldier. “Steve?” He heard the brunette call him as he made up his bed on the couch.
“Well, no actually. We are both in here. There was a scheduling error,” Steve explained, swapping the camera view back to him.
One late morning, Steve awoke to Tony bringing him breakfast, the brunette smiling that pearly grin when he saw Steve awake.
The brunette flopped against him after the last spurt of his release filled Steve’s entrance. Tony was clearly spent from all of their play, as well as holding himself off till now. Steve unlaced his hands from his love’s to softly stroke Tony’s cheek and shoulder as he laid his head in the crook of Steve’s neck.
“That’s gotta be a steelhead, huh?” Tony questioned, eyeing up that gigantic fish. It was a beautiful one, its body filled with colorful lines of greens, pinks and blues.
As the last pancakes finished up, Steve turned off the burner, flipping the flapjacks onto his plate and taking up the rest of the eggs that were left in the pan. He went to grab the mug of coffee Thor left on the counter next to him when he sensed a presence behind him. Before he could turn around, he felt two strong arms wrap around his waist. Steve broke out into a toothy grin, placing his hands over the ones resting on his belly.
Then again, from what he’s found out about Tony’s past reputation, the man had only been with women. And he really couldn’t hold that against Tony, Steve hadn’t been drawn to a man before Tony came into his life. So, to say the least, Steve’s chances were greatly marginalized.
Taking a breath, he approached the clear glass doors, seeing Tony hunched over a table and writing formulas that appeared on a holographic screen in front of him. The typical, heavy bass of music vibrated slightly through the walls, and seeing Tony at work made Steve smile a little timidly, a blush tinting his cheeks. He did miss spending time with the man.
“God, I love you, Tony,” Steve whispered, brushing his cheek along Tony’s, Steve’s hint of golden stubble scratching against the genius’s own facial hair.
“Right,” Tony scoffed then, folding his arms across his chest. “It had nothing to do with you trying to prove something, to prove your worth.”
Steve couldn’t form words in response to Tony’s rather rhetorical question. Tony knew all too well what Steve liked and didn’t like, and nipple play was right up there with what the super soldier loved most.
Regulating his breathing, Steve quickly stripped out of his top, finding a white t-shirt to throw on. His heart was anxious, and he knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep for a while. So, quietly, Steve padded out of the room, down the stairs and out to the wrap around porch. He didn’t bother with finding a porch swing or a rocking chair to sit on. Steve simply took a seat on the steps, his elbows resting on his knees as he looked upward towards the sky. It was a cloudless night, and the stars were in abundance, much more than New York City. He had always found solace when he looked at the stars, a comfort settling within them then. The breeze was cold and crisp, the perfect combination for autumn. It presented an invigorating chill, pleasantly giving Steve goosebumps.
Merfolk from adjoining pods had spoken of mermaids and mermen being taken by humans nearby, being experimented on and tested. They all should have been more careful.
Steve ate the salty white come off Tony’s chest, his tongue coursing over a dark nipple, biting it teasingly before continuing on. A trickle of come was dripping down the side of Tony’s chest, and Steve made quick work of drinking it up before it found its way to the comforter below.
“You have seen this before, no?” Obadiah said, voice gruff, seeing the merman’s unnatural calm. “Saw your fellow fish friends get a bullet in their gut?” The man chuckled lightly, as did a few of the crew that still surrounded them.
is beyond me,” Tony said, taking a sip of his own drink. Steve could smell the booze. Bourbon, one of the genius’s favorites.
“I’m so glad you’re home,” Tony admitted, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder. the blonde leaned down, giving the brunette a loving kiss.
“I want you to be as comfortable as possible, baby,” Tony whispered, laying feathery touches along Steve’s sides as he spoke. “Let me hear your safeword one more time.”
in love with her” Steve whispered harshly, moving his arms animatedly and hitting a mop head in the process.
“Given your fancy sunglasses and your New Yorker accent, pretty obvious,” Jerry laughed lightly. “But you both look like those Avenger guys,” he added, looking to Tony, handing him and Steve their bags of goods.
“Oh God,” Tony bit out, his fingers digging into Steve’s hips as he fought for composure. Steve’s hands braced his solid chest, his own finger shadowing a slight amount of the light that emanated from the genius’s arc reactor. His thoughts were quaking, his body flooded with pent up need as well as being completely exhausted from all the two had done so far.
You wanna touch yourself, love?” Tony asked, winded as he replaced his tongue with two fingers, slowly entering them into Steve. He spread his fingers, stretching his lover out without force or urgency; Tony didn’t want to unintentionally hurt his love.
“I’ll never get over how beautiful you are, Steve…never,” the brunette remarked, kissing Steve on his forehead before guiding the man back until he was laying supine on the voluminous comforter, sheets and pillows. Steve watched him with half lidded eyes, blue irises illuminated in the warm lamplight. Tony moved over him, gazing at the super soldier fondly and skirting his calloused hands up and down Steve’s arms. He pressed into the muscle of his biceps, massaging them before trailing down to Steve’s bound wrists, loosely grasping them.
“I’m gonna be stressed out after this meeting, you know? Might need to find a way to relieve it,” Tony said, clicking the elevator control.
“Thank you, Obie,” he murmured. He had his doubts, but Tony just wanted to trust his advisor. He already had so much to consider with their business proposal. Everything else could be set in the back of his mind for now.
“I wasn’t contacting you a lot because I didn’t want to distract you from your priorities, which are your meetings,” Steve responded, his voice tight and irritated. “Didn’t want to be so attached that you would feel smothered and confined. That’s why I was giving you space, Tony.”
Steve felt his chest tighten, elated butterflies breaking forth and fluttering within his belly, so much so that he felt like he could not breathe. The blonde beamed, his smile so big and filled with joy as he held his hand out, offering his finger to his love before speaking.
Underneath Tony’s handwriting was the address, and Steve saw that that it was in Brooklyn. He tilted the envelope then, a bronze key falling into his palm. Studying it for only a moment, Steve looked up and saw the rest of his team quickly turn their gaze away, grabbing up their gifts and crumpling up the torn wrapping paper.
was cute? If it was anyone else, he’d think they were slobs. But not when it pertained to Steve of course.
Steve joined in, keeping quiet as they piled the paper, ribbon and tape into a black bag. The blonde mulled over Tony’s letter in his mind, finding it to be rather inconspicuous. It made him nervous, for he didn’t know what to expect when he met up with the man later that day.
“You bet I am. Figured we’d be getting to this part of our relationship soon enough. Might as well always be ready,” Tony remarked, nestling himself between the super soldier’s legs.
They showered together, both men taking turns washing each other’s hair and bodies. Tony quickly dressed in slacks, button down and blazer while Steve dressed in lounge sweats and a form fitted t-shirt. “You know, it isn’t fair that I have to go be responsible and meet with people while you get to stay here,” Tony pouted, walking toward the elevator.
“Yeah, you like this so much. Don’t you Steve?” Tony said, pulling away then to tease Steve’s entrance with two digits now. He watched the man’s hole quiver as he swirled his fingers against it, Steve sighing at the man’s touch. Tony dug the fingers of his other hand into the meat of Steve’s cheek, massaging it with quick motions as he dragged his thumb down the man’s beautiful hole, spreading it slightly.
“Dude, you’ve been acting so distracted lately. I know your breakup with Pepper was what, three, four months ago? But you gotta keep living life. You know she is.
“Ehn,” Steve moaned, pushing back against Tony’s finger, the brunette’s chest flushed with the super soldier’s back. Tony brought his other hand up to lay flat against the blonde’s torso, holding him in place as the genius swirled his finger deeply inside his entrance.
Tony thinking that he just needed time to get over his and Pepper’s break up was the biggest understatement of the year.
Sitting up, Steve thought a moment, though there was no further clarity to his predicament. So, the super soldier went to take a shower as the sun began to set, only to get into bed early. Maybe he needed to sleep; after the scene at the museum and with he reacted with Tony, the super Soldier figured he may need to just relax. The man sketched in his journal, random items at first before he listlessly moved to people. The scratch of the pencil on the slightly textured paper lulled him, the light music that played on his radio reminding him of the past.
Steve closed his eyes and smiled boyishly, nuzzling into his boyfriend’s touch. He could feel where their chests and hips pressed together, could feel their hardened lengths rubbing through their jeans.
Steve came a third time that night when Tony’s one hand massaged his rim while he rode him, his beloved’s other hand tugging at the meaty head of his weeping erection. Steve’s come spilled onto Tony, splattering up his chest and to his defined clavicle. Steve’s body was overly sensitive as Tony stroked him to completion. His body was on the ripe side of pain, his entrance and channel stretched and sloppy, his penis spent. Not to mention Steve’s muscles felt as if he’d gone through boot camp again before his super soldier serum.
“Oh, yes. I didn’t want anyone to see me as I made my way up here,” Steve explained, unzipping the hoodie he was wearing. He watched Tony watching him as he pulled the latch down, a deep navy garment slowly coming into view.
“Of course,” Steve assured him, sitting on the couch and unfolding the blanket. “It was nice getting out of the city and do something entirely new,” he said with a smile. Tony smiled too, looking down at his hands. Steve saw the glow of the arc reactor through his shirt, gently lighting his face in a soft, pale blue glow. “But you know what made it really great?” He added.
“Want you,” Steve said, his breathing heavy. The crown of his erection poked out from the top of his panties, pearly beads of white precome pooling at the slit. Steve could have multiple orgasms that evening, and the blonde had an inkling thst that’s exactly what Tony was planning.
Tony’s one hand that was wrapped around Steve’s back began its way down, till it rested upon the swell of the blonde’s luscious rump. “I would love nothing more than to take you, love,” Tony said, smiling sweetly, his hand massaging the skin of Steve’s behind, causing the super soldier to hum at the bliss of it. He had always liked when Tony gave his ass attention during their kissing spells in the past, and Tony knew just how much Steve liked it. The brunette always made Steve feel so wonderful and lovely, as if he was something sacred. Even when Steve’s self-doubt crept in, whether it was about Avengers matters or personal things, the man would give the insight Steve needed to find his inner peace.
But how they were now, having Tony comfortably warm against him, Steve could feel a need begin to blossom deep within his belly.
“Well, that’s true,” Tony admitted, slowly slipping himself free from his love. “I was able to smooth talk you, didn’t I?” He winked at Steve who only rolled his eyes.
“Wait,” Tony stopped him before the man put the fish back into the stream. Reaching for his phone in the pocket of his waders, Tony opened the camera. “Say cheese!” Steve did just that, holding the fish up and beaming a pearly smile. Tony snapped the shot, looking at it in approval before putting his phone away. “Told you, this one had to be one for the books.”
Tony never gave it much thought when it came to his and Steve’s love life. But the genius liked being in control just as much as Steve enjoyed being controlled. There was something thrilling, Tony thought, about the way he could have the blonde on the edge of ecstasy, waiting for the that last touch from the genius to send him over the edge. Tony loved being able to give all of that to his boyfriend as well, knowing it was one of the few places that Steve could be himself truly, to let down the Captain America persona and just be an artist from Brooklyn. When Tony thought about that, it humbled him.
Leaning in, Tony wrapped a hand around Steve’s leaking length, thumbing at the head teasingly while biting into the flesh of one of his cheeks. The blonde lurched forward, a loud gasp filling the room.
Leaning an arm against the clear glass windows, Tony looked across the multitude of skyscrapers that besieged the city. He felt so lost, his heart pinching when he thought about Steve cuddling close to him back at that Bed and Breakfast, how he thought about how much he would like waking up with Steve by his side every morning. It didn’t make sense to him then, and it didn’t really make sense to him now. But Tony had accepted his feelings for Steve, and it hurt him deeply, knowing that the man’s heart belonged to someone else.
So yeah, Tony had loved Captain America, but certainly not Steve. Especially when he turned out to be nothing like how his father described him. Then again, Tony had come to know Steve, where Howard only knew Captain America, his perfect experiment. He was grateful for that, though. Because though he at first hated Steve for being stubborn, and righteous and a stick in the mud, he had come to appreciate those qualities in him. Howard didn’t know the little things that made Steve who he was. He didn’t know that Steve hummed to himself while he sketched, or how the blush on Steve’s cheeks would flood down his neck when he was embarrassed or caught off guard. And he never knew how Steve’s eyes would light up every time he discovered something new. Howard never knew Steve the way Tony knew him, and Tony wouldn’t have it any other way.
The next morning, Steve was busy at the stove in the communal kitchen of the tower, Natasha cooking up a vat of scrambled eggs while he flipped pancakes in the skillet.  He was much chipper than he had been in the last few days. Tony would be home in just a couple days, and they had cleared the air between them. Steve felt that they could start off fresh as a couple.
“So close, Steve,” Tony said in a strangled voice, closing his eyes a moment. He could hear the slick wet noise of Steve’s fingers pumping inside himself, and when he opened his eyes once more, he saw the glistening lube shining on Steve’s loose pink rim.
“Hey, at least I had a fish interested in me,” Tony joked. “I bet I’ll get the most fish today,” he challenged, grinning deviously.
to it,” Tony said, only to laugh loudly at his own pun, his eye brows furrowing and eyes shutting tightly. Steve rolled his eyes, laughing too as he embraced the genius in his arms and squeezed him lovingly.
“I can’t take you anywhere. Can I, Steve?” Tony remarked, observing the dried release on the fabric as well as the giant tear right above it.
“Any second thoughts?” Tony asked him, the brunette’s hands wandering up and down the musculature of Steve’s broad back. Tony could see the blonde had been retracting into his thoughts. “We don’t have to-”
“Good, me neither,” Tony responded, his voice low, licking his bottom lip before leaning down and kissing Steve ravenously. Steve felt the other man’s hand tighten in his hair, and the super soldier let out a rushed breath, his hands securing around Tony’s waist. “We should take this to the bedroom, wouldn’t you say?” Tony said between voracious kisses as he started to grind down against Steve’s thigh. Steve merely whimpered in agreement, overwhelmed by feeling Tony’s body roll against him in languorous waves as he continued to kiss the blonde. Tony just felt so good, his lean, muscular body moving skillfully against Steve’s own.
But then something switched within them, their differences becoming a healthy balance. When they had become actual friends along with colleagues, Tony felt a sense of belonging. But that didn’t mean anything. Nor did the fact that he always made sure Steve had the best battle equipment and the safest uniform. So what if he enjoyed Steve visiting him down in his lab, the blonde working on art while he dabbled with formulas and gear. And it sure didn’t mean anything that he felt at home when he was with Steve.
“If you really don’t want this apartment, you don’t have to accept it,” Tony crooned. “But would you accept me, Steve? If our affections match, and you feel as strongly about me as I do you, do you think we could have this?” Tony asked, gesturing a hand between him and the blonde.
“Yeah, it is!” Steve replied, his expression concentrated as he fought the fish underneath. He reeled it in slowly, letting the fish tire from the fight before reeling a little more. Tony watched as the taut line moved in random patterns as the fish tried to swim away. He thought for a second that the pole was going to snap as it bent practically in half from the force of the fish. Steve truly was strong, his biceps straining against his flannel as he brought the fish closer, but that fish had put up a damn good fight. It was then that the fish’s tail splashed to the surface, its body wiggling about before Steve finally reeled it all the way in, holding it up as it wriggled around.
“S’good,” Steve managed to whimper, his hands grabbing at the pillow he held, twisting the poor fabric tightly, the seams pulled taut. The brunette could see all the tension in his lover’s body, the way his shoulders shook, how his thighs clenched and abdomen rolled against the cushions under his hips. Tony knew Steve was fully aroused once more.
They made it to the middle of the yard when a snowball flew out of nowhere, hitting Tony in the back of the head. “What the hell?” he said in surprise, touching the back of his head as small clumps of glistening snow fell from his dark hair.
“Oh, yeah. I didn’t even hear the bathroom door open,” Steve admitted, closing the sketchbook. His mind was too scattered to focus on art anyways. He swiveled the chair around, facing the brunette.
Steve chuckled too, walking over to the area as well. “You’re just gonna come and make use of the coffee maker,” Steve teased.
“Your generosity and kindness are much appreciated,” the sea creature said, gently placing his hand over his heart. “I am forever in your debt.” Steve truly meant that. The horrors he had known about humans, had been backed by the storied taught to him as a merbaby, and when Bucky was taken. But Tony was a ray of light that shown upon him and his belief on humanity. He brought warmth to Steve and the hope that one day merfolk and humans would be able to amicably coexist once more.
But the genius got older, and the soulmate legend was just that: a legend, something fooled children like Tony to believe in an idea that truly couldn’t exist. But now there was promising scientific evidence that such a thin existed and had been around since the dawn of time. The brunette continued to change the channel when the soulmate story ended, only to then watch an interview with an anthropologist in prehistoric history. She spoke of the historical aspect of prehistoric peoples, and the material culture that links these historical groups to their views of soulmates in their clan or tribe. Tony huffed a breath in almost disbelief.
“Thanks, Brayan,” Steve replied as he tried to calm down his racing heart. It shouldn’t have mattered that much to him, but it did. Time seemed to slow, the background chaos and noise sounding so distant as the two men stayed laying on the ground, Tony still hovering over Steve.
"A soulmark?" Bruce said in a mixture of awe and disbelief. "Tony, that's amazing. You know how rare that is anymore. Hell, it was seen as a myth until recently," Bruce continued moving closer to the other man.
He felt his boyfriend’s hands upon him once more, and Steve looked to see Tony lifting him slightly to put a pillow under his lower back. That was new.
It took a moment for Steve to come back to reality, his body limp, spent. Tony loved seeing the man like that. Steve could get uptight often. So when Tony could cause the captain to let go like this, it brought a sense of invincibility to the genius. He took his time licking Steve clean before he pressed open mouthed kisses up his contoured torso, dipping his tongue in each divot of his abs, pushing the fabric of the purple slip up as he went.
“Now now,” Tony cut him off, having his bandaged hand. I highly doubt you have had any intention to be harpooned in the hip and taken captive from your fellow merfolk,” Tony explained, giving the sea creature a shrug. “I just want to make sure you are healthy enough to swim back to your pod and not become victim to a hungry shark,” Tony smirked. “Or a leviathan,” he joked, referencing another folklore beast.  The inventor moved away from Steve then to walk around the small room.
“Don’t worry, Cap. I’ll be alright. Thanks for listening though,” Tony said. But then Steve was moving in closer to him and Tony felt his heart skip a beat, his nerves rising. Steve placed a hand on his shoulder, giving Tony one of those little smirks he so often fashioned.
“I- uh, well I went to this one museum with Natasha and Sam,” Steve said his stupid nerves causing him to blabber. Tony didn’t glare or seem annoyed, he just waited patiently as Bruce glanced at the other genius. “Anyways, I saw this and thought you would like it,” Steve rushed out, practically thrusting the gift bag in Tony’s hand. Steve felt himself sweating, chills running up his spine as his shoulder began to almost seer with pain.
Steve’s heart began to beat quickly as he went to work untying the pretty bow. Once it was off though, Steve unrolled the delicate fabric of the garment, holding it up so that he could see it fully. His breath caught when he saw what type of garment it was. The fabric was a thin silk, the color a dusty rose. The lingerie itself was a teddy romper, with a sweetheart neckline that had skinny white lace straps. On the bodice were two white chiffon panels that traveled down to wear one’s bellybutton would be. The fabric was sewn to a synched elastic waistband, connecting to a pair of flouncy shorts made from the same silky material. The bottom of the shorts was embellished with the white lace that the straps of the garment were made from.
About twenty minutes later, there was a knock on one of the window panels, and Tony could see Steve outside it, looking at the dome-like structure curiously.
“Then you will do right by complying and being a good little fish. No more fighting or I will blast you and your pod to high heaven. You hear me?” Obadiah pushed the gun further into Steve’s head, making the creature hiss at the cold hard metal pressing into his skull. “Answer me, I know you understand what I am saying to you,” Obadiah roared.
Once everyone was gone, Tony let out a long sigh, trudging back up to the communal area to await Pepper’s return. He sat on the couch, his body tired, his heart heavy. When he heard the elevator ping, he stood and turned to see Pepper in the same form fitting navy dress she had on earlier, her hair now a bit unkempt from her busy day of meeting after meeting. She was still the most beautiful woman he knew. He couldn’t help but to wrap his arms around her, to feel her petite form against him. Pepper hugged him back though, squeezing him tightly before giving him a peck on the lips. Tony asked how her meetings went, and she asked about how the party was. They both gave half-hearted remarks, knowing that they needed to get everything on the table.
Natasha was busying herself, obviously not wanting to be a part of whatever was happening between the two men suddenly. The pain in Steve's shoulder was searing, and the mark was obvious to see. Steve could swear that there was a rouge creeping up the genius's tawny skin. Tony turned on his heel then, ready to bolt it seemed only for him to stop.
“I’m okay,” Steve huffed, using a semi clean spot on the old rag he still held to wipe his cheek and lips before any oil found its way into his mouth.
For about three weeks the blonde was still rather bed ridden, the alien metal taking his toll on his body even with the super soldier serum. He could move around for short periods of time, but for the most part, he was resting. Tony made sure Steve was as comfortable as he could be, and by the six-week mark, Steve was making an almost full recovery. He still got tired frequently and had to take frequent naps, but, the wounds were healed, his breathing was easy and not a chore for the super soldier.
Back home in New York he was the highlight of galas and balls. Tony would savor those nights where he was encapsulated by the grandiose aristocracy and high society. The most notable names in progressive businesses fancied the chance to throw their beautiful daughters at him, hoping their elegant grace and impressively voluminous bustle dresses would catch Tony’s eye; being involved with the Stark family would be a wondrous success for any titled, high society family.
The super soldier continued to stroll down memory lane, popping his coat collar up when a frigid wind whipped around him. He passed through his old neighborhood, and he stopped in front of the apartment he had grown up in with his mother. It most certainly was worse for wears. But he could see passing shadows through the curtains of the windows. Steve hoped a happy family was inhabiting the space he once called home.
“Yeah, you like how I take control, don’t you, Steve?” Tony growled possessively, hands stroking up and down Steve’s clothed thighs. “Like how I touch you?” Tony started rocking up into Steve harder now, the blonde bouncing on him like he was on a pogo stick. Tony was going to fuck the man till he was sore for the rest of the day, which would be a challenge since the super solider had a healing rate unlike any other. Still, Tony was going to get an A for the effort. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, bringing the man down so that their chests were brushing against one another. Steve liked being manhandled, Tony knew that, and he found it to be hot as hell.
After the Attack on New York, Tony found himself constantly in his lab, anything to keep his mind from thinking about the aliens, gods and devastation that plagued him every moment of his life.
“I’m glad, otherwise I would have felt terrible about it,” Tony huffed, using both hands to spread Steve’s cheeks. Tony now suckled at his entrance, his lips kissing the wet and fluttering muscle there. Steve jerked at the touch, his body pulsing with need as Tony ravaged him in such a gloriously obscene way. The blonde could not retain his moans and pleasure-filled sighs while Tony flicked his ruby tongue into Steve’s body. The pure intimacy of it, with Tony’s tongue and lips at the most vulnerable and secret space of Steve, magnified the beautiful sensation of it all. Tony was the only one entitled to every inch of Steve. Nobody had been with Steve quite like this. Nor would anyone be in his future besides Tony.
“Steve,” Tony said, slowing his hips so that they were languorously rolling up and into his boyfriend gently, teasing the man’s opening with shallow thrusts. “Want you to come on my stomach,” Tony continued, cupping Steve’s jaw with a hand as he stared at him. “Wanna watch you lick it off me too.” He watched Steve’s expression, catching for any signs of discomfort. But when he felt the man’s hard arousal twitch between their bellies, and Steve’s eyes grow wide in interest, Tony knew he wanted it just as much. “Would you be okay with that?” Tony asked for reassurance.
The brunette’s body was tense, Steve’s warmth engulfing him in heavy heat. And the sounds the super solider made as he was stretched was driving Tony wild. The chocolate didn’t make for the best lube; Tony wasn’t gonna lie. But damn, he and Steve would have both been in pain if they hadn’t used it.
The elevator doors opened then, leading out into the living area of his penthouse. Tony didn’t have anywhere to go, or anything to do for that fact. He wandered through the room aimlessly, wondering about his life, the Avengers, and what Pepper was doing right now. He’d seen her only sparsely, for business matters mostly. Tony walked over to the window, the grey skies reflecting his destitute state.
Reminding himself to concentrate again, Tony leaned down and licked a stripe down Steve’s rump, biting and pulling at the firm, springy flesh with his teeth. Steve’s sudden gasps and sighs sounded so pure and sweet to the brunette. The genius pushed Steve’s thighs apart even more so, spreading him wider and revealing his entrance, the muscle clenching wantonly.
“Uh-uhn,” Steve rushed out in almost a whine, cupping a hand over his mouth immediately. He was pretty sure Nick heard him, though.
Tony couldn’t help but be apprehensive of this partnership with Arnim Zola and his superior, Johann Schmidt, whom was the founder of Hydra Energy. Something didn’t settle well with him. Why would an alternative energy company be interested in Stark weaponry and innovations?
It was Steve’s turn to moan, head falling back and eyes closing as Tony took what he wanted, marking Steve with hickeys and bruises. They’d be gone by afternoon, and yet Steve loved how Tony could mark him this way, claiming Steve as his.
Where Natasha's hand was, on the blonde's shoulder, a warmth began to gently pulse. Steve paid it no mind as he finally continued on in their museum visit.
Near Tony’s walk in closet was a wall length mirror panel, and it reflected everything with absolute clarity. Tony had Steve stand in front of it, wrapping an arm around his trim waist then. “I would really like to make love to you in front of this, Steve. I want you to see how gorgeous you are as I take you, to see how beautiful and desperate you become,” Tony explained, his hand lowering to caress the cut line of the blonde’s hip.
Steve lifted his head back up and looked at Tony, his cheeks so red, his nipples wonderfully pebbled and hard while he watched Tony fondle himself. Steve drifted the hand that was playing with his sac back up his belly to his chest, massaging a pectoral while he continued to tease his cock, precome bubbling at the head. Tony’s eyes were glued to the screen, his body leaning forward to get as clear a view as he could of his boyfriend. He teased his rim, feeling his hole try to clench around the pad of his middle finger while his cock slid in his fist, a raspy glide of skin on skin. He was panting, biting his lip to fight the orgasm that so readily wanted to come. He didn’t want to come yet, though. He wanted to come by watching his love climax, the image of pure ecstasy washing over Steve’s chiseled features.
“Like that, Steve?” Tony grunted, picking up his speed some as he rammed harder into his lover. “Like being fucked?” Tony said, voice gruff. Steve moaned at the man’s dirty words.
But by the fourth week of Tony relying on his feelings to go away, only to consider the idea that they in fact may not go away, Tony felt the panic rise within him once more.
Lacing his one hand with Tony’s, Steve placed an open mouthed kiss to the man’s knuckles. There was no smidge of doubt in his mind that Tony didn’t mean his words. Because Steve also knew his affection for the genius would never waver.
Thor had also introduced him to Sif and the Warriors Three, who were just as merry as Thor. When Steve met them, he went to shake their hands, only to be grabbed up into a giant group hug. It took him a few minutes to get his lungs functioning properly afterwards.
Steve had missed Tony with a longing he had not endured with anyone else before. They’d been apart not too long ago, when Steve was on Avenger business. But, how things have been lately between him and the genius, Steve could tell something was up. Tony, that gorgeous, cheeky man, seemed distant, and Steve of course assumed the worst.
“Would you come for me, Steve?” He whispered as his hand that was playing at his penis head wrapped around the thick heavy length, stroking it rhythmically as the anal beads slid out.
“I thought I’d leave that up to you. Since it was you I was being the asshole to,” Tony replied, grabbing up his coffee cup.
“O-oh, yes,” Tony whined out, eyes closing and head falling back as he allowed Steve to do what he pleased. Besides his full enjoyment of having his nipples played with and how Steve’s fingers plucked at the pert flesh, Tony loved watching his love’s one hundred percent focus and concentration on what he was doing. There was something amazing in the way the blonde explored and tried to make Tony fall apart beneath him. Of course, it never took Tony long to do just that. Within moments Tony was gasping louder and more quickly, the tingling in his nipples building with each tug from Steve’s hands.
Tony’s sweet words made Steve’s chest feel like butterflies had fluttered out of a net and flew in multiple directions beneath his sternum. The heat of their moment took pause as the tenderness of their love and affection swirled around them, everything truly peaceful.
Without a word, Tony took Steve in his arms and in one quick movement changed their position to where Tony was on his back, undoing his belt, and Steve between his legs helping the other man along. It was mere moments before Tony too was naked, his cock laying against his defined abdomen, ruddy and engorged, pearly beads of pre-release bubbling on the crown of it. Steve wanted to lick up every single drop.
Steve breathed quietly, eyes still closed as he felt his boyfriend’s lips and tongue caress his shoulder. He hummed happily, turning his neck the best he could to kiss Tony’s sweat laden temple. “That was nice,” Steve whispered, his voice gruff.
His brain was foggy, but Steve could detect his love’s hands on him, the brunette’s fingers tender over his skin. Tony removed Steve’s undies from where they stayed on the blonde’s upper thighs. That last bit of fabric gone left Steve beautifully naked on Tony’s bed.
Picking it up, Steve flipped to the picture he had been working on before he helped Tony with his car. It was just a rough image of Tony, leaning against the car, arms folded across his chest, his eyes cast down, a small smiled etched on his face. Steve felt his heart thrumming wildly. Damn, how was he supposed to get over this crush of his?
Steve came with a sharp intake of breath, an exhale following suit, his voice a desperate moan. Tony stroked him through it all, muttering sweet, encouraging words as Steve spilled his seed into the genius’s hand and onto the chiffon of his nightie.
The genius did his own research on the matter, he had a hunch of what the warm mark on his shoulder meant. He had J.A.R.V.I.S bring up the results for soulmarks and the first few articles confirmed his inkling: Scientific journals came up about them, how they are formed and why. Some of it was hypothetical, but the theory was basically the same across the board. The genius even looked at a few pictures of these soul marks, some were modern, and some were in old photographs. Though they were all varied in placement, there was that similar circular red spot that was just slightly raised.
"No thanks, Cap," Tony replied, checking his smart watch then. "Shit," the brunette cursed, grabbing for the door. Algorithms were going crazy at Stark Tower, and Tony needed to get there as soon as possible to try and straighten it out. "Gotta run, but if you need anything, give me a call," Tony said half way out the door. He took a card out of his jacket and handed it to the blonde before racing down the hall.
"Mhmm," Steve replied, almost drunkenly from pleasure. He arched against the other man however, wanting to feel all of Tony and explore his body anew. Steve curiously felt out the dips and curves of Tony's back, his shoulders, the ribbed muscle of his seratus anterior. "You're so beautiful Tony," Steve sighed, finding Tony's mouth once again, sucking the man's bottom lip between his teeth. Tony slipped his tongue in Steve's mouth, and the taste of the brunette sent a shiver down the blonde's spine.
“Steve,” Tony said, taking a few steps forward, only for the blonde to raise a hand, shushing the brunette and stilling him.
But as the morning turned to midday, and midday turned to evening, Tony stark was restless, unable to find respite in anything.  Even as he tinkered in his chambers of the ship, his thoughts and curiosities falling back to the merman, his azure eyes perfectly captured in his memory.
Steve landed on the mat with a thump, Natasha's knee quickly pressing against his neck. He looked up at her and she smirked.
“…Maybe…” Tony admitted, his eyes closing and mouth parting as his boyfriend moved his lips warmly up his jaw. “So glad to be back… with you,” Tony breathed, his hands gently pushing Steve back until he was on his back, and Tony straddled his lap, caressing the blonde’s shoulders before moving them over his biceps and down his forearms.
Looking into the bag, Tony saw a long item inside, and he pulled it out to see a bookmark. he assumed it was Steve’s, yet he observed the art piece, impressed with the figure's physique.
“Wa-wait. I was actually heading to your lab to go over some Avenger reports,” Steve rushed out, turning to follow Tony back into the elevator. Tony stopped him simply with a hand to Steve’s solid chest.
“I’m glad,” Tony replied, guiding Steve to a sitting position. “Can you stand up, alright?” Steve nodded, and did just that, standing on tired legs, his defined, muscular thighs straining a bit. Tony wrapped a hand around his waist and walked the beautiful soldier to an arm chair positioned near the windows. Tony had been sure to have J.A.R.V.I.S tint them so nobody could see inside.
Steve watched then as Tony’s hands found their way under the silky slip again, trailing feather light touches up his abdomen. His body was so sensitive, everything heightened to Tony’s touch. Steve was being consumed by Tony and it was the best feeling in the world, to be so loved and protected by someone.
Tony looked at him finally then, eyes an indiscernible mixture. “I’m just trying to keep you safe and comfortable, Steve,” Tony said, his voice soft yet assertive. “I know what you want, and I am giving that to you.” The genius took a breath. “You just need to be patient with me, Steve, and let me be over cautious,” he added. “Because if I wasn’t, and I ended up lost in the moment or hurt you somehow…” It was there Steve saw the fear cross Tony’s eyes, heard the emotion in his voice. Steve remained quiet, the sensuality of the toy and ribbon a distant thought as he saw Tony’s own glimpse of vulnerability. “I’d never be able to forgive myself if I put you in harm’s way due to my lack of responsibility or care for you,” the genius continued, taking his eyes off of the super soldier and staring at his own hands.
The blonde’s vision had briefly left him, his sight returning to see Tony standing, smiling proudly as he held Steve’s slumping frame up.
Each moan and sigh the blonde elicited brought a plethora of emotions to the genius. It made his heart flutter and his southern regions wish to come to attention. But more than that, it made Tony feel otherworldly, his love for Steve coursing through his veins like a river rushing through an uncharted wood. The super soldier made him feel alive. Knowing that a man like the Steve loved him just as much back, as well as confiding and trusting in Tony with his heart, mind and body, the genius would always be completely floored and grateful for it. Because a life without Steve wouldn’t be a life worth being a part of, he figured. It may be overly sentimental, but that was how much Steve meant to him.
“Do I really have a New York accent?” Steve asked as they drove their rental truck to a quiet stream.
“I will,” Steve responded causally, winking at the genius. “Patience is a virtue, ya know,” he added before finally reaching his wet hand down to palm at his sac and perineum before massaging at the entrance with the pads of his fingertips.
Tony had to admit, the man had charm. He wondered how he wasn’t scooped up yet by some lovely lady. It didn’t really matter, he supposed; Steve didn’t seem to be looking for anyone at the moment anyways.
Putting the Stark Pad aside then, Tony drifted his hand up Steve’s tight rim, up over his perineum and to his sac, feeling the textured seam there before teasing the underside of the blonde’s aching erection. He watched his beautiful boyfriend tense at his touch, the ribbons on his wrists doing their best not to shred apart.
Nick of course took it under consideration and agreed with Steve that their skill set were greatly desired and admired. After their meeting, Steve was heading down the hall, buttoning up his winter coat, only to stop when he saw a familiar face heading his way.
“Ready,” Tony asked, sounding winded as Steve felt the head of the genius’s arousal nudge against him.
“Yeah, everyone is good. Natasha is nursing a sprained ankle, but you know Doom would need a lot more than doombots to take her down,” Tony said, reaching up to brush some of Steve’s hair out of his face.
“Why make up for lost time when you get back, when we can make it up now?” Steve asked, the blush on his cheeks trailing down his neck. Tony could feel his own body reacting to Steve’s proposition. Steve doing something so out of his element, and kinky was arousing on so many levels. Steve pulled down his boxer-briefs then, kicking them off and leaving him completely nude. Tony could see everything, the blonde’s swelling erection laying beautifully on his sculpted abs, his pink hole gorgeously exposed, and all Tony wanted to do was touch and taste.
Steve smiled as he watched his fellow Avengers, his friends, as they made their way into the communal living room. He sighed in content, thinking how the only thing that could make him more blissful was having Tony here. Ah well, he would be back soon enough.
“Tony, “ Nick Fury called as the genius opened the door to the hallway. His voice was softer than usual, and Tony looked back, shocked at the man’s almost pleading tone. Fury took a breath, itching at his brow.
He giggled as he took a handful of the white suds and blew them at Tony, the bubbles softly hitting him in the face. Tony laughed too, wiping his face clean before plopping some bubbles on the end of Steve’s nose.
“And now you have the freedom to do that whenever you like,” Steve remarked, grinning at him lovingly.
On reflex, he shoved the lid back on so that nobody else could sneak a peek at the rather private item. Tony was pretty sure though, that Natasha caught a glimpse of it, her mouth curved to the side as she smirked knowingly at the brunette before turning back to Thor, whom was her Secret Santa.
“He goes for the gusto with everything he does,” Steve replied with a light laugh as he peered at his other friends across the room. He heard Tony hum in agreement watching the others as well.
After he was dressed, Steve exited the bathroom to allow the steam to escape. Grabbing the sketchbook in his suitcase, the super soldier headed to the desk to have a seat. He wanted to sketch the creek they were fishing at earlier. Tony got off the phone shortly after, not saying a word, hearing him enter the bathroom then. Maybe he did make the man upset when he walked out in his towel. Steve tried not to take it to heart or think about it too much, he’d done that enough over that month of Tony being distant. He focused on his sketch instead, starting with the beautiful oak and maple trees that lined the far side of the creek.
Tony thrusted deeply into his love’s warm mouth until there was nothing within him left to spill. Steve, the champ that he was, enjoyed the brunette’s wild bucking, loving the fact that he was the reason Tony was a writhing, hot mess above him.
"Nothing to thank me for, Steve," Tony replied softly, pulling away to look at Steve. The brunette cupped Steve's cheek, his thumb brushing at the man's cheekbone. Unbeknownst to Steve, he flickered his gaze to Tony's mouth, a swirling tightening in his chest as his longing for the man became almost unbearable. Tony must have had mirroring feelings, because soon enough the brunette eased the super soldier closer. Steve closed his eyes, felt the heat of Tony's breath ghost against his mouth and jaw, and then the brunette's lips met his. Steve sighed softly, every bit of his being becoming Tony's, the soulmark budding with both warmth and contentment, desire and security.
“I’m here,” he replied groggily, lifting his head and meeting Tony’s stare. He watched Steve remove his fingers from his bum, the excess lube working its way out of his winking hole. And though Tony had a monster orgasm, he was pretty sure his penis stirred at the sight of it. Steve too grabbed his night shirt and wiped his hands off on it.
“I think I am actually going to take a nap,” Steve said with a shit-eating grin. He really was tired, especially after that wonderful love making. Tony just glared at him, tossing on his sunglasses.
The genius’s body was drawn taut like a bow string, until all at one his muscles relaxed, and he flopped back against the mattress with an unceremonious
“That’s not the point, Stark. I have elites in the conference room waiting for you to show up.” Tony just looked down at Steve and rolled his eyes at Fury being such a drama queen.  Steve gave him a small smile, his hands wrapping around the genius’s back.
Steve looked toward the bed then, imagining Tony laying there with him, curled up in each other’s arms, just talking about things and perhaps giving an occasional kiss.
“You should really just give him a call, Steve,” Natasha said, her head resting against the back of the couch, eyes closed. Steve cocked a brow at her, taking in her relaxed appearance. They’d become close friends, working on missions for S.H.I.E.L.D. and training together often. He still was shocked by how perceptive she was. That, or he wore his heart on his sleeve more often than he thought.
“I guess so,” Tony replied. “We can have so much fun with that,” he added with a wink, and the blonde grinned at the prospect of what that could mean.
Whatever invisible barrier that had made Steve nervous dissipated then, the blonde hurrying to the door and maneuvering the baskets in his hands so that he could punch in his authorization code. When the door unlocked he pushed his way into the heavy drum bass of what would be now called classic rock. He made his way to his love, placing the baskets on a semi clean work table before hovering over Tony and peering his head down till it was blocking the man’s view of the suit piece. He, unintentionally, startled Tony who flinched and looked up at him, a charming smile breaking out on his face, his round, chocolatey eyes crinkling at the corners.
“Yes, Tony,” Steve said, setting the snuffbox on the nightstand, his voice hitching as emotions swayed and swirled in his mind and heart. “There is no one else I could see spending my life with, nor anyone I would want to with more than you. Tears swelled in the super soldier’s eyes as Tony slid that golden band onto Steve’s ring finger.
Steve imagined himself in the lingerie and immediately felt his body respond. He didn’t want to wear the garment without showering first, though; he did just run 10 miles. So, he headed to Tony’s bathroom and took a nice hot shower, scrubbing all the sweat and grime off until his body was bright pink, skin sensitive.
He went to put his phone back in his pocket before stopping himself. Tony instead decided to scroll through his camera roll, and found a picture of him and Steve, the blonde giving a childish smile and blushing while Tony pressed a kiss to the man’s cheek. It was a few weeks since they started dating, and he already was acting like a love struck teenager and taking selfies.
When he eventually gained some train of thought, Steve sat them both up before lifting Tony in his arms protectively, a hand under the man’s bum, the other around his defined shoulders. The brunette on instinct wrapped his legs around Steve’s small waist, his own arms securing around the back of the blonde’s neck before Tony leaned in to claim his love’s lips again. Steve had never wanted this so much in his life, he felt, wanting for him and Tony to consummate the love they had for each other.
“Should we have the rest of the team come too?” Steve asked, biting into the toast, crumbs falling onto that ridiculous plaid pajama shirt.
"I-" Steve was left speechless, not knowing what this would mean for them. He knew what he wanted...he wanted Tony. But he was afraid of what Tony would say in response. He may yearn for Steve, but that doesn't mean Tony would
Steve cleaned the man’s back before spreading Tony’s bum cheeks with his hands, the chocolate sauce on the taut flesh there, as well as his hole. Steve started by licking the chocolate drizzle on the inside of the genius’s cheeks, using a hint of teeth while Tony squirmed underneath his touch. Steve didn’t know how much he would enjoy this. The intimacy that it held between him and Tony was beautiful and filled with trust. To Steve, trust was one of the most important qualities to have in a relationship.
Tony eased Steve's shirt off, revealing his soulmark. The genius wasted no time kissing the warm skin, Steve's sigh spurring him on. He licked at it, even nibbled the mark, the pleasure Steve received flooding into Tony too. The knowledge that he could make Steve feel this way, filled with bliss was still hard to fathom. But Tony quieted his thoughts, focusing only on Steve.
“They’d fight back, and stand up, even when it seemed pointless. They’d protect and do what’s right, even when it was easy to just give in,” Steve replied. He felt Tony place a hand on the middle of his back, the warmth of his touch comforting in the cool night air.
He pulled away though, even when Steve sought after his lips, wanting more. “Let me see the rest of your present,” Tony encouraged, catching his breath then. “You in those sweatpants aren’t doing me any good,” he teased, grinning wildly at the super soldier.
"Well, you never had a soulmate before either so," Tony smirked, making Steve chuckle. "But, we have a choice, Steve. Regardless of biology, or the power of the cosmos or what have you. Do you know what you want to do?" Tony asked, his expression earnest.
“How is that fair?” Tony asked, his voice breathless as he rested his head against Steve’s chest, nuzzling close. Steve just chuckled, taking a deep breath as they laid there a moment, letting the roiling heat simmer down.
“Keep your eyes open, love,” Tony whispered, as he circled Steve’s pecs in wide strokes. Steve listened, opening his eyes as he watched his beloved’s hands caress his defined chest. He saw Tony brush the pads of two fingers underneath the curve of his pectorals, the light friction almost tickling Steve before the brunette used a hint of nail, causing Steve to bite his lip as he continued to look at his reflection.
“This, my love, is chocolate sauce,” Tony started, undoing the lid so that Steve could smell it. “Completely edible, made with exquisite rich chocolate. People use it to drizzle on their lover’s body and massage them with it or lick it off them.” He watched Steve’s expression, which was wide-eyed and mouth parted, fully interested. “What do you say to trying it out, baby?”
Tony thought about Rhodey’s opinion and advice. He of course was right, saying that some risks are worth taking. But Tony didn’t want to go in guns blazing, only to run away with his tail between his legs. He’d find a way to see if Steve was interested in anyone and then go from there. That would be a both risky and safe bet.
“Uhn,” Steve moaned slowly, his knees falling open even more, biting his lip as he felt Tony’s tongue explore his length. What the man could do to him always left Steve breathless. He looked down to see Tony’s head bob up and down around him, the warmth of his mouth so inviting for Steve to thrust up into. He wanted more of that heat, as greedy as it made him seem. Steve grasped a hand in Tony’s hair, disheveling it as he stroked his fingers through it. He could feel the coil building within his lower belly, his testicles drawing tight as he neared climax. When Tony began to fondle his sac, his tongue licking his penis from root to tip, Steve lost it, his body tensing, eyes drawn tight as he came into his love’s hot mouth. He felt Tony swallow, drinking the warm ropes of come down as Steve thrusted a little roughly into his mouth.
client, Tony. Stark Weaponry will be one of the first American businesses to branch from their isolationist views,” Obadiah stressed. He narrowed his steely blue gaze at the younger man, attempting to get his point even further across. “If your father was here, he would take this deal. He would seize the opportunity for this company, this company that he made from nothing.” Obadiah leaned back then, leering at Tony intimidatingly. “Wouldn’t want to disappoint him,” the balding man smirked, knowing he struck a nerve with the young inventor before walking away, Tony’s notes in hand.
They breathed together, their chests heaving against one another before Tony broke the kiss, collapsing his head into the meat of Steve’s shoulder. Steve wrapped his arms around him, nestling his nose into the brunette’s wet hair, inhaling the scent of shampoo, sweat and testosterone. He never felt more loved then when he was with this wonderful man that he had the privilege to call his boyfriend.
He made it to Tony’s floor a moment later, and when he opened the man’s bedroom door, Steve didn’t find Tony in his bed, nor did he hear the shower or faucet running. So, where was the genius?
“What?” he asked, eyes wide yet blurry with sleep. “Of course I’m happy with you. I love you, Pep.” Tony really did love her, but even he couldn’t deny the hollowness in his words. Pepper just gave him a sad, close-mouthed smile, her blue eyes slightly watery.
“Uhn, To-Tony,” Steve moaned, rocking down on his fingers as he stroked himself quickly, thumb pressing into the slit on the head. Steve’s fingers disappeared inside him while his other hand found a nipple once more. Tony never thought he saw anything more breathtaking in his life.
“You’re not wrong about that,” he agreed. “We’d end up not going anywhere. So, did you have anything in mind then?” Steve inquired.
They stayed like that briefly, Tony still in Steve’s lap, their arms warped around each other, relishing in their loving touches. Steve started things up again though, his hands finding their way down to the hem of Tony’s shirt, his fingers slipping underneath to trail light touches up Tony’s taut back. He pulled the fabric over the brunette’s head, leaving him bare chested as well, the cool glow of the arc reactor illuminating their frames.
When he had the strength to sit up once again, Steve did, though still with great effort. He fought the wooziness that swirled in his mind, focusing on his need to get out of there and back to his pod. He surveyed his surroundings, noticing metal objects that looked like tools of some sort. Two soaked rags were pressed on his gills, which were along the underside of his ribs. The water allowed his gills to filter water into his body so that he could breathe with ease. Steve could see then that there was a white cloth wrapped around his lower abdomen, dots of crimson blooming the fabric. He gently pulled the mesh from where it covered his wound to see stitching there. The black thread had sealed the cut, though blood still encrusted the area a bit.
“Nap?” Tony questioned with a chuckle, his head tipping up so he could look down at the other man. “I don’t think so…not yet anyways,” Tony answered then, tilting Steve’s own head up so that he could kiss him sweetly, his tongue finding its way into the super soldier’s mouth. How alluring and yet odd to taste himself on Steve’s own tongue.
“Oh, Fuck!” Tony shouted, everything in him dissolving into euphoria. It was those noises escaping Steve’s mouth and the clench of his opening around Tony’s shaft that pushed him to climax, one hand tight in Steve’s hair, his fingernails of the other almost breaking the skin on one of the blonde’s ass cheeks.
Tony inched closer then, lining up his cock with Steve’s opening as the blonde brought his knees up, splaying them open as they rested close to his chest.
“I’m happy here,” she said, leaning a hip against the counter as well. “I’m doing okay,” she reassured him. Tony nodded, taking a gulp of the hot liquid, burning his tongue some.
But that all came to a screeching halt when Pepper dropped the breaking-up bombshell on him. She told him that she hadn’t felt the romantic spark in their relationship for a while, and that she couldn’t keep pretending anymore. “It’s not that I think that you don’t care. I just don’t think you’re truly happy, Tony,” she said to him as she readied herself for a meeting that morning. Tony, who was still trying to wake up, felt his heart sink.
Steve watched Tony open the bottle and squirt a decent amount of the lubricant on his fingers. “Finally,” he said, his second erection of the night unbearably hard. He felt Tony’s finger stroke his opening, the lube, a warming gel Steve liked so much. He shifted himself a little, trying to get as comfortable as possible for Tony to stretch him. The brunette’s lithe finger worked its way into Steve’s tight channel, the heat of the lube sending waves of ecstasy through him. “Mmmm, feels so good,” Steve moaned out, pushing his bum down to take Tony’s finger further. Each drag of his finger left Steve keening and once Tony added a second finger, Steve started to rut against the comforter, he needed some friction.
“Mmmm,” Steve purred, the brunette already getting an idea of what his boyfriend was going to be doing momentarily.
“That’s the only acceptable piece of cake in my book,” Tony replied, smiling cheekily. “The more frosting and sugar, the better.”
“I guess so?” Steve said, searching Tony’s gaze. “Do you like being more dominant?” Steve asked then. “I don’t want you to feel pressured, or not enjoy it.”
Natasha and Sam were in different areas when Steve noticed a shadow pass above him as he was swimming, only to realize it was a ship. The merman’s heart raced at the realization, remembering what happened to his best friend the last time a ship passed by. The vessel slowed overhead, an anchor dropping to the sea floor, catching on a small reef. Colorful fish scattered from the intrusive metal object that wedged itself within their home, pieces of coral and rock breaking from the anchor’s impact. Steve wondered if that ship was the same one that took Bucky and were coming back to capture more of his pod.
Tony knew without a doubt, that everything that he needed in life was in that room. Just Steve, and the love that would carry them till the end of their days.
With a big sigh, Steve nuzzled against Tony’s pillows, the thoughts and smells eventually carrying him to sleep, white sheets draped around Steve’s muscular form.
Tony would keep it a secret for as long as he could, not wanting to admit his soulmark and who the universe deemed to be his soulmate.
“Do your worst to me,” Steve whispered, his body already responding to the brunette’s spellbinding gaze, his brown eyes like that of pure light and love. Steve would argue with anyone that Tony’s eyes held to key to life itself…as if Steve’s heart would cease to beat each the genius would close his eyes, only to be brought back to life when Tony opened his eyes again.
With a wing and a prayer, Tony leaned forward, tenderly laying his hand on Steve's chest, right above the bandage that protected his wound. He moved his fingers to the soulmark, he hissed at the sudden discomfort, emotions flooding his very being. Taking in Steve's pain, he tried to ease the super soldier with the comfort only he, the soulmate could give.
“I’m going to run to the bathroom, okay? Be right back.” With that, Tony hurried to the bathroom. Steve watched him, wondering what he was doing. Soon enough though, he saw Tony with a wet cloth in hand. “I know you like to get cleaned up after a mission. And I want you to feel your best tonight,” Tony explained, and Steve smiled. Tony knew him so well.
“Is this alright, babe?” Tony asked, realizing he probably should have asked Steve before he’d started altering his position.
