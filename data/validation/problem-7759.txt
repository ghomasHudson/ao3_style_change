Bruce gave a small smile. “Morning,” he greeted back.
The kid tapped an offbeat rhythm on the table and Clint found himself staring at it, before looking at the kid’s eyes that was darting everywhere.
Steve shuffled on his spot “Uh, yeah sure.”
Clint’s not stupid, but he could be in some situations.
The point is, if the college life in this story seem made up, that's because it is. I tried alright, I really tried asking and researching, but college here in my country runs really differently. For starters, Dorms aren't a big deal. Not one college here requires any first year students to take residency.
Steve glared at him, his jaw clicking, before pivoting around and barging his way towards the bathroom. Tony shrugged, suddenly not all that embarrassed that he never grew out from his Captain America phase. Maybe he won’t hate living in this place after all.
“So high school bathrooms slash grandma’s open toilet,” The man said. “Well, you discover something new every day.”
“We’re what?” he finally asked.
Peggy sighed. “You have got to stop doing that,” she said. “You know, I don’t get you sometimes, you’re not that awkward bloke that keeps to himself every class and tries to act small when it’s physically impossible,” She gestured at Steve and his massive frame. “Try reaching for other people, and not wait for them to reach for you—like what I did—and maybe you’ll find out that you’re not awkward,” she said. “or friendless,” she added.
Thor thought for a moment, of course, he was interested to befriend people, was that what she meant? “You can say that I’m interested in a lot of people.”
There was a pause that made Bruce look up. Natasha was staring at him with this look he can’t read. “Not enough, apparently,” she said.
Thor met his eyes and smiled at him gratefully.
Jane shrugged. “I don’t really know, but they say it works if you act like you’re not too desperate. Like, you know, talk to them, but make it quick and act like you’re just fine when you see them.”
“Hey, I volunteered making coffee so that I could skip a couple of minutes with you guys yapping about stuff,” Tony pointed out carrying a plate of mugs with coffee. It wasn’t the just the fact that Tony knew who owns which mug surprised Bruce, but also the fact that he actually knew what type of coffee the others would drink.
“Well,” She said, readjusting the stool she was sitting on and gestured at the painting. “It seemed frustrated as if it did something and it’s in,” She paused, thinking of the right word to say. “discomfort”
He snorted. “Maybe,” he said shrugging. “But it’s one of the reasons why I can fool people.”
“Are you trying to to reach out on everyone?” She replied cocking her head at the right.
“Oh, right, magic word,” Tony said when Steve had obviously failed to comply him. “Steve, would you please open the door and see who’s the asshole at the other side?”
he thought as he grabbed his ‘too small’ towel that was hanging at the back of his bedroom door.
And she didn’t like it when she doesn’t know anything.
The kid never respected him, always demanding things and that, he can’t even say thanks. And yet Clint would still feed him every other day, getting nothing in return. Just like back at the building. And he’s starting to wonder: when is he going to stop and realize that maybe this is enough. Maybe he already repaid Tony’s good deed.
“How, in all things holy, did you even reach college?”
Bruce woke up at the crack of dawn, he was sure even Tony was conked out, and made a beeline towards the bathroom. His barefoot padded across the cold tiled floor, only to stop when he heard the distinct sound of someone eating. He froze.
Tony crouched down in front of Bruce and smiled. “You seem like a man of science, why don’t we do some of that? And the day after, and the day after that and so on and so forth.” He said patting Bruce on the shoulder, Bruce only stared at him, startled by Tony’s actions. “How’s that sounds?”
until the guy finally emptied the box before putting it back inside the fridge.
“More commoners, how brilliant,” the kid drawled, earning him all of their attention again, with the addition of Steve.
“Hey, I
Again, he decided whether to confront the man that has been forbidding him to sleep, but thought that he’d rather blow off some steam with archery. And again, he debated whether to drink from Tony’s milk, but he’d rather want to have some good night sleep.
Clint glared at the note. He could have just used Tony already.
“Is hiding from everyone your solution to situations like this?” Clint asked.
“That’s the point, it’s how you see it, people doesn’t see the same thing as you do, so stop making assumptions to things you don’t even know,” Steve said as Bruce started to shrink from his seat.
He knew everyone had their own demons, but maybe he’s not the only one with the worse once. It’s not something to be happy about, in fact he’s not. But, knowing that you’re not alone means you can face it with someone, and do it vice versa.
Thor blinked, and looked genuinely confused rather than afraid. The knowledge of it doesn’t sit well on Natasha.
Once they reached the list flight, Bruce finally noticed, for the first time since he moved here, that Thor was panicking,
“Yes we know, you found yourself waiting by the ER—”
Steve bit his lip, suddenly wanting to end the conversation, as he threw one of the packets that he was holding on the cart. “In a small house,” he answered as he started pushing his cart.
It was simple, the painting was basically screaming what it means. And yet Steve stared dumbly at it.
He was still trying to process what the hell was happening, but Tony found himself replying nonetheless. “I’m not gonna spend my entire evening sitting next to you if it’s not Back To The Future.”
Loki raised his chin and narrowed his eyes on him, “And what good will it do if I tell you?”
“Yeah,” Steve said, remembering Bucky, “The last thing Bruce needs is being alone, especially after what he’d done to the mirror.”
“—And that is why we need a peephole in this place,” Clint declared after listing of reasons that were all taken from the film that they were watching.
“I think I fed you enough burgers and hotdogs to finally get a name,” he said when he didn’t received an answer.
Three, four seconds passed. “So what course are you taking?”
It’s not that she hates people, she just doesn’t care.
“Are we friends now?” Thor repeated.
“What’s wrong with pineapples?”
Then, add the thing that I'm a lazy highschool kid, and you have yourself a writer who decided not to write anything for the next few days.
Bruce exploded and Steve is back to Still Painting
“But what if they grew tired of it? Eating nothing but the same food could be tiresome.”
He was rummaging through his food—which was far less than usual—he was really getting tight with his budget when a hand landed on his shoulder.
A long time ago—maybe not that long—a few decades perhaps, a weird house was built near the intersection down the road, a few blocks away from the SHEILD University. It wasn’t technically a house per say, in fact it looks nowhere near a house, more like a heap of concrete with two stories.
“How fortunate it is to see you!” he boomed, causing for a few passing students to turn at them.
“Your advice! It worked!” Thor declared. “Not on just one person, but all of them! I owe you so much, Jane!”
The boy went through a lot of passageways that could probably lose typical civilians, or policemen, but if there’s one thing Clint’s good at when he still used to steal stuff, it was running away. Basically, the kid’s definition of escaping was child’s play. Honestly, Clint was only waiting for the kid to run out of fuel.
“I can’t” He uttered.
Steve snapped his head towards Peggy as she gestured at the two popcorn packets he was holding. “Oh, I was just trying to decide which one’s better.”
As soon as he got home—? He saw Clint’s post-it paper telling him to just place it on the counter. All expectation was immediately
It was Steve’s turn to blink, “Uh, what?”
Thor blinked again.
The image was simple, four rectangles that seem to represent a room with each residing a man. The first one was a man making a racket, the second was a man glaring at the wall of his room—directly at the man making the racket. While the last two rooms had the two men asleep.
Maybe he was trying to pay Tony back, but in a weird twisted way where he tries to recreate this amazing thing that asshole did to him— that amazing thing being his hearing aids— and tries to do it to someone else. That someone else being Thor, and this runaway kid who he found himself feeding, apparently.
He grabbed his notebook and ripped another page.
Huffing out a loud exhale, Steve placed the extra pie in a Tupperware and crammed it in the fridge.
Not that it wasn’t his fault, but Clint drank more than one carton of milk. And then suddenly, just because of one, Steve found himself on Tony’s bad side. These are one of the reasons why reasoning with a person you hardly know is useless.
“That’s exactly the problem, it’s the second, no one should settle on just the second best,” Tony fumed. “And also, the CEO’s son’s a dick.”
“Good, we’re good.” Then his eyes landed on Bruce’s bag, almost to quickly. “What’s with the bag? It’s a weekend.”
Her eyes followed Steve’s water supply, with each having his name labeled at the front. Then at Clint’s, slowly decreasing, food supply complete with his name and…
Heeeeeeeeey.... *fidgets*
“So, need any help?” He asked gesturing at the box on the table.
“At least I’m not
They haven’t had the chance to talk since most of the time they were too busy grunting and catching their breath, and sending a few boxes crashing down the stairs—Tony’s doing. But now that they were done, Tony realized a random passer-by wouldn’t just lend him a hand. That only happens in movies.
“You don’t have to answer,” she suddenly said and Thor turned to look at her. “But, whatever it is that you’re going through, you’ll get through it.”
Clint turned to look at Bruce. “Uh, yeah, sure, Back To The Future” his whole composure screams:
Anyway, I know the first part doesn't really hold any plot-and so does the next few chapters, but that doesn't mean this story would suck. The plot would probably start after a few chapters.
Thor enthusiastically took out a post-it paper, writing down a question of who owns the device before sticking it on the fridge. He intentionally kept the device so that he’ll have a chance to give it to the owner face-to-face. More likelihoods of making a friend. He’ll just hand whatever it is over and ask the person to be his new friend! What else could go wrong?
“And I specifically said that if we’re not watching Back To The Future, then I’m not watching at all,” Tony fumed.
Kudos and comment!
The bad side of being unable to hear is being unable to know if your pronunciation was correct. Sure, he’s not like the others, he was old enough when he lost his hearing, but he can’t really assume he said everything correct.
Clint turned and saw Bruce with his too big of a bag. “ls it weird that this feels normal?” Clint asked pointing at the door.
Natasha allowed herself to furrow her eyebrows. She didn’t like the situation, and that’s because she didn’t know what just happened. One minute they were all sitting awkwardly around each other, and now she could sense a banter between Hammer Tech and Stark Tech.
Natasha still likes to people watch, but she may be getting a little rusty with reading other people
“You know what, just order some pizza,” Peggy finally said, throwing the bag of chips back at the shelf with its family. “Pizza’s great, especially Hawaiian, I dunno why people hates it.”
Peggy snapped and pointed a finger at him. “See, even your childhood friend’s saying that. And you know I have other friends, right? Not that I don’t like hanging out with you, but—why are we stopping at the grocery store?”
He was too busy being embarrassed at the fact that everyone knew he used to be a thief that he forgot how Bruce would feel. The guy just broke a door.
The idea of giving the object back to the person who owns it excites him, this could be his chance.
Tony typed again.
“Hey, Thor,” she said. “Been a while, right?”
Jane was pretty sure she couldn’t flirt to save her life, but a compliment’s a compliment. “Okay, fine, forget it,” she said waving her hands. “So you’re asking me for tips, right?”
She stared at him, her eyebrows furrowed but she was smiling as if she was looking at him like he’s an interesting species. “You know, I thought you weren’t capable of smiling, with that look that you have moments ago,” she said shrugging as she turned straight ahead. “For a moment, I thought you were planning to get hit by a truck or an RV or something,” she paused. “Then get tasered by one of the people riding it.”
For someone else seeing his underwear sprawled around isn’t something new, the strangers that frequently spends the night in his dorm room back at MIT could vouch for that. Used or not used, okay maybe you’d think he’s a slob or something, but it’s college, you’re supposed to be a slob. The Captain America prints on the boxers, however, is a different story.
That’s when Clint realized he was only wearing his boxers and a very loose tank top in the middle of the road.
“Kid, trust me,” he said grabbing the kid by the collar before hoisting him up. Sure, Loki was taller, but he almost weigh nothing. “I know.”
Either he’s losing his ‘early-bird’ thing going on, or the people in that building decided that sleeping isn’t necessary when you can win over Steve’s cooking.
“No, shut up,” he immediately said, cutting Bruce off. “I’m not walking on eggshells or trying to act all heroic here, the reason why I’m not running for the hills is because I realized that you’re normal. You can say  that wrecking the bathroom mirror and the door had its perks.”
“Fuck if I know,” Clint shrugged. “The kid got some serious walls built around himself, you never know if he’s lying or not.”
Clint smiled and patted him on the shoulder. “How about just give that to some lady that you like,” he said, then he was gone.
“So…” He started as he nodded his head towards the living room, “Thor’s brother.” He should step out of his comfort zone a lot more.
Clint blinked at the second note, it did sound fair.
The man frowned. “Excuse me?”
Natasha narrowed her eyes but answered nonetheless. “There’s Tony, Clint, Thor, Bruce, and Steve who I think needs therapy sessions more than I do.”
God, he loves Pepper. That’s why even when they broke up, he couldn’t let her go.
she hung up.
Peggy’s mouth hung open. “It’s popcorn,” She said seriously. “You know what, how about just buy some crisps.”
“You know, there’s no one stopping you from using the bathroom,” Tony commented as the bigger guy continued to shuffle from his spot.
—which was Tony’s first assumption. Hence the getting eaten alive part.
“You… ordered pizza?” Bruce asked.
“Hold up, ran away from where exactly?” Tony asked, bringing Bruce back from his thoughts.
She crossed her legs and raised an eyebrow at him.
“Oh cut it out Pep,” He snapped, “Did you know about this?”
Bruce stared at the building in front of them, before turning to Loki who was was avoiding to look at everyone, instead he too was staring at the building. It was a rehab center.
“Oh!” She smiled, “Okay, but you know, no one really talks like that anymore.”
“Steve it’s a movie night, not a well-planned sleepover by elementary school girls.”
I don't know how College works XD.
“Jesus!” Bruce jumped as he whipped his head at the intruder.
“Lady Tasha!” Thor boomed as he caught sight of the redhead standing by the door. “Welcome back!”
But an annoying small part of herself wasn’t buying it.
Looking down, Tony remembered that he was wearing nothing but a very small towel.
She just stared at him.
Tony opened his mouth to retort, but all that came out was a strained sound. Biting back on her apple, Natasha wondered how long Tony could keep this Tony Smith act.
“Certainly,” Thor replied without a beat.
“See you around,” She said and left towards the opposite direction from where Clint had left.
Bruce gave a small smile. “It’s okay,” he paused. “Just… tell me, anything, anything at all, if you feel weird living with me. I don’t want to be a...” He trailed.
It was because of Clint.
“I can’t acquire my own,” the boy retorted back, as if Clint not buying him the hotdog doesn’t make any sense.
There was silence on the other end, but Thor couldn’t really bother, he was still feeling giddy and everything. He couldn’t wait to tell Loki, even if he would probably ignore it.
Maybe he should have called Rhodey instead.
“That should do it.”
“You don’t,” Tony said who took another bite from his toast, Steve raised an eyebrow. “I haven’t met any of them yet, though Bruce here’s lucky enough to see lady red tw—”
Clint is a weird bird.
Loki just stared at him.
Peggy rolled her eyes “Yeah sure, that’s why it’s been played over and over again for months after it got released last year,” she grunted as she skimmed the shelves. “The song went so viral, it got so annoying.”
But she was already walking away.
Loki stared, and for a long moment nothing could be heard but the loud wind and Loki’s heavy breathing. Any minute now, the others might come, but Loki being this worked isn’t a good way to start.
The brunette clambered on his feet, leaving Steve on the ground who was still registering what just happened. He didn’t bother reaching out his hand to help him up, which was fine, no really, it was fine, but it was still rude. Steve tried to ignore the glances that were given to the both of them from the passing students and helped the brunette with his stuff. The guy might be rude, but Steve isn’t.
There was a pause,
“Wait, so the flowers were—” Clint started but trailed off before laughing.
A few days passed and Clint found himself starting a new tradition—other than putting your name on your food. He didn’t mean it to stick though, it was just supposed to be a message.
“That was the disputation?” Thor asked. “I remember arriving with the two of you fighting about milk.”
“Did you just spent half an hour in your room covered in sweat without even showering?” In Tony’s defense, he couldn’t help but point it out.
Bruce blinked.
“I don’t read people,” Clint said. “I watch them, I got great eyesight, and you leeching on me was a bad move on your end.”
“If you had the balls to run away from your home, you also have the balls to go back.”
Pepper and Rhodey were the only people who knew about his inability to apologize, or to accept apologies. So, when Tony bugged Pepper at ass o’clock to grab him a pair of hearing aids because he couldn’t really stomach going back at the moment, she didn’t ask why and what for. She did throw a fit, but it was for the sake of making it seem normal, before telling him to wait for her after his last class.
The therapist sighed and moved on. “You mentioned something about this Steve needing more help.”
“Unhand me!’
Steve blinked at her before staring back at his painting. Tilting his head, he studied it.
Every heads turned to Steve as he stood awkwardly with both his hands holding the strap of his messenger bag. The healing black eye made the whole picture kinda weird, and Bruce couldn’t help but wince internally knowing that he was the cause of it. He apologized to Steve the minute he got the chance, but something went wrong in the middle of the conversation because for some reasons, the conversation ended with Steve apologizing as well.
Suddenly, there was a scream—how Steve made it sound so manly was forever a mystery—then the door to the bathroom flew open. Tony never thought that it would be possible, but he’s pretty sure Steve’s face was even redder than before as he slammed the door closed.
“Tony, just because—”
It keeps reminding him that he’s all alone, and it also keeps reminding him that it’s his fault he can’t really run back to anyone. And he hated it, he moved and left everything behind to forget, but the memory just keeps coming back.
She didn’t like it when she doesn’t know something, sure she doesn’t care why the others were even there, but this guy’s a Stark.
Steve was at the counter by that point, rummaging inside his bag. “Yeah, I mean I thought it was a good idea. I mean, the popcorn wasn’t that much so yeah, pizza,” he said without glancing up from his bag, as if he was purposely not trying to make eye contact. “Dang it, I can’t find my wallet.”
“What the fuck, Clint?” Tony exclaimed.
Anyway, Clint's chapter was basically just an introduction for Loki and I hope you like my characterization on him. So far, he had the most changes comparing to the others with their comic book counterparts. I had fun playing around with his character, but I've been really busy this last few weeks so I wasn't able to really give my best on this chapter. I got a Thesis paper, a Research paper, and an Investigatory project lined up this sem and I'm three seconds away from committing murder. Seriously, we have three papers to finish and I'm wondering if High School's in different countries also have that because I need to encourage myself that we're not the only ones suffering.
Thor never liked coffee, they were bitter and he needed tons of milk and sugar before he could even bear the bitter taste. That was why the coffee he was giving Bruce resembles more like milk with a few drops of chocolate milk.
“Is the door locked?”
Peggy stared at him, as if Steve was some sort of man out of time, or a Norse god that got sent down to Earth. Though, Steve guessed that none of the reactions fit for the two given situations were remotely similar to the look Peggy was giving him. “Sorry, but which part in Brooklyn did you mention you live again?”
He continued to scrub his palms even when the skin turned bright red.
Other would have taken this as a sign and ask themselves if they just gave their number to a lunatic, but not Jane. Jane just laughed. “I’m glad then,” she smiled then gestured for the two of them to continue walking. “So, how’s it been?”
“I’m guessing Tony already told you guys about me,”
Next to him, Natasha raised one eyebrow towards Clint. And no, she wasn’t confused, there would probably be a nuclear war first before Natasha gets confused in a situation.
Tony had been the first one to leave, stating that he still had a date with his creations. After that, everyone just started leaving one by one. Thor didn’t blame them, it was near one in the morning when Tony left and it was already two in the morning by the time Steve bid goodnight and trudged up to his room.
“Well I’m Russian,” Natasha supplied.
“I-I-I don’t get—”
Steve’s frown deepened, only it resembled more like a pout. “That’s not really helping.”
Tony shrugged, “It’s how I deal with everything.”
“I was about to leave an apple,” she said raising an eyebrow. “You think that’s a bad thing?”
Anything but fathers, unless it’s not obvious, he’s not really that interested with anything related with the word father, or dad, heck throw in Papa as well. His record and the broken furniture in the building says it all.
Bruce’s eyes widen, he’s whole posture freezing before snapping his attention toward Loki. “He’s—”
“Uh, Morning.”
For a moment she thought she just mistook Tony Smith as Anthony Stark. But she was never wrong, she knew he’s the same guy.
“No, I’m pretty sure you are.”
Thor shrugged.
Bruce looked up and came face too face with a pretty looking lady.
The next morning, Clint woke up with an angry bladder about to explode.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You have a friend?” Clint asked dubiously.
Shrugging, Bruce made himself some tea and decided to stop by a hotdog stand before going to class. It’s the first day and he’s not looking forward to being late.
“I knew the guy!” Clint protested. “I didn’t know he was going to rip me off.”
ONE MORE DAY AND IT'S HALLOWEEN YA'LL!!! *throws confetti* Even though we don't really celebrate it by trick or treating, instead we spend the whole day at our ancestor's graves, i still wanna celebrate because why not?
"He just moved in this morning,” Bruce answered.
“All I did was steal a wallet,” Loki mumbled irritably, arms crossed over his chest.
pissing her off.
But as soon as the Heir of Stark company started placing food with his name on the fridge, Natasha instantly knew it’ll be a thing around here.
Coming from a
Nodding, Natasha grabbed her wallet from her jeans. “Everyone, contribute four dollars.” Then she turned to Thor and called “Hey big guy, pay your part for the pizza, it’s four dollars.”
Steve looked affronted. “Excuse me?”
“You guys hang out now?” Was the first thing he said and just thinking about it, it sounded like he’s jealous. Steve wanted to slam his head on the table right then and there.
“I, ugh, only take tea,” Bruce said as he surveyed the coffee Thor had given him.
“Okay,” he said. “But are you okay?”
“I actually spent a few days with that asshole,” Clint supplied. “Before running away with my wallet.”
Tony shrugged and reached for his. “I’ll pay for Cap’s part, considering that his memories can rival my dads’, who couldn’t remember that he left me at the park,” (Natasha noted that bit of information, even when it seemed like a joke) he said before turning to Steve, “You can pay me later.”
Natasha really hates it when she’s wrong.
Then something clicked.
He would have called and asked Rhodey for help, but the guy was too busy off helping with the military.
As soon as the person at the other end of the call picked up, the man wasted no time. “Pepper what the hell!” he hissed.
Natasha slammed the door shut.
Whenever Steve shows up near Bruce, he would slowly retreat back towards his room and spend the rest of the day until Steve retreats back to his own room.
“I’m gonna need a mountain of Salonpas,” Clint announced, “And a body massage.”
It was probably three in the morning, he was sleeping on his bed when it actually started to vibrate. If there was one thing Clint hated about himself, it’s being a light sleeper, just like a bird.
With a groan, Clint placed his sandwich down. “He ran away, but not from home, get it Einstein?”
He pointed at the biggest box in the truck, it contained his bed, considering that the given bed in his room was pathetic. The man strolled beside Tony and visibly paled when he saw the size of the thing they were supposed to move.
It’s like watching a reality show, minus the T.V.
Both heads snapped up towards the entrance to see a tall well-built blonde male standing by the doorway, holding what could possibly be the heaviest looking box Bruce saw in his entire life. Strangely, something about this guy just screams ‘All Hail America’.
Along the way, he noticed Tony and Bruce also with Clint on the table.
It was odd, yet amusing, watching how each room slowly gets occupied by different people, and how each and every one of them had a weird way of arriving there. Except for the red-headed lady whose name he didn’t catch, he actually has no idea how or when she moved in, he just woke up one morning spotting her exit the bathroom.
“You paid for the—oh okay just tell me if you’re done,” He said as the other man whipped up his phone and proceeded to call someone. The owner massaged his temples and sighed, “Millennials.” Then he studied the young man again, “Celebrities,” he sighed again.
Tony snorted as if Steve had just said the most ridiculous thing a person could ask. “Walking’s for the weak,” he said. “Also, it helps me reach my classes, God I miss the time when Pepper wasn’t breathing down on my neck,” he added.
The realization startled him for a moment.
And because he doesn’t like to share his stuff with strangers (or strange people that only shows up in the bathroom) he started putting sticky notes on his foods inside the fridge.
“No, yeah, of course I know that.” This time Steve physically scratched his nape out of embarrassment. “W-why, I mean, walking on eggshells? Do you think I’m secretly trying to reach out on everyone?”
Thor jerked awake and the others snapped their heads towards the door, except for Natasha who was more interested at the fact that Thor was woken up by a knock. She was starting to think that even when World War III was raging on, he’ll just sleep right through it. Apparently she’s wrong, and she hates being wrong.
Shrugging, Tony took the box of pop tarts upstairs with him without saying anything in return.
Pepper looked at everyone. “Did I get the address wrong? I was half asleep back there.”
Staring back at the stupid kettle, Tony wondered if he’s living with a bunch of hermits. Then again, he could stay locked up in his workshop without realizing he’s been in there for a month.
Pepper clicked her tongue and nodded. “Sometimes I feel more like his secretary most of the time,” she said, but there was no anger behind it. She glanced at Clint’s ears, and recognition flashed across her face before smiling. “But I know there’s a reason behind it.”
Natasha raised a brow at the nickname. No one has the right to call her other than her real name, even Fury. And these people, calling her like they were something more than acquaintance, is…
“Shut up.”
“Was it a bad thing?” He asked. “Whatever it is you were about to do.”
It was funny how they all seem to come out when the other was there only a few minutes ago. How they were all so close to seeing each other, and yet not so much.
He must’ve read Steve’s facial expression as the man answered Steve’s question, “You start remembering someone when they keep making the same work.”
Steve turned and saw Peggy peering on his canvas. Steve furrowed his eyebrows and stared at his work. They were asked to paint anything that day, and Steve found himself making a simple piece: a man sitting crossed legged eating spaghetti while his whole surroundings were covered in different kinds of hotdogs (hotdog on a stick, mini hotdogs, footlongs, all kinds).
That threw Bruce off for a moment. “I’m pretty sure I’m far from normal, Tony.”
“What makes you think I’m making you CEO once I graduate?”
“You’re actually  telling me you didn’t ran away,” Clint said raising an eyebrow.
“She’s something else, isn’t she?” The owner said, a man in his late 40s who only acquired the building because the original owner—which was a relative he wasn’t even aware off, died way too early.
Thor’s eyes grew wide, how stupid of him not to say his name when there was a lot of opportunities. “I’m Thor,” he said, but it sounded more of a declaration of war.
Unlike Bruce, I used The movie version for Thor's story. Because frankly, i tend to avoid Thor's earlier comics. Not that it's bad, it just doesn't really work with me. But always expect comic references.
Tony raised one of his eyebrows again. “Yeah, sure that explains a lot.”
Thor opened his mouth to reply immediately, then paused. He never really thought about it, he was too eager to want to meet this other person it never occurred to him to wonder why he even owned a hearing aid in the first place. No wonder his brother calls him an idiot most of the time. “Yes, I guess,” Thor replied.
Bruce didn’t acknowledge him, he was too busy with his own thoughts. For a guy who started using sticky notes to claim property, he tends to ignore it.
The blue notebook flashed inside her head and shrugged. “I wasn’t looking for it, I just found it,” she said.
“Uhh,” Steve stuttered sitting on the passenger’s sit, completely red in the face, “You don’t have to do this,” He said gesturing to everything.
“Loki?”
“Dude, what the hell?” Clint exclaimed clutching his chest. “StarkAids are sensitive, you know that right?”
Natasha didn’t bother to answer the question. Should she remind him that it wasn’t just men that got her in this mess that was called her life? It was all of them. The reason why she needs to sit ones a week in some god awful room to talk about feelings weren’t caused by
“Well then there must be a reason why you’re angry then,” Natasha said nonchalantly adjusting on her sit.
Edit: okay, technically I didn't edit the chapter, because no matter how hard I try and correct wrong grammars or add missing words, they don't seem to disappear. So pardon for my grammatical errors.
“You said so yourself, this is a punishment, so do something about it. You never know, this punishment could be your second chance.”
Maybe the people she’s living with aren’t so bad.
Natasha shook her head. “No.”
“So, Stefan— ”
Natasha stared at the notes taped on the fridge then glanced down at the note she made, debating if she should tape it or not.
Peggy looked around, searching. “Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t know there were other Peggys.”
Leaning down on his elbows, he stared at him. “Did you ran away?”
“Yes Bruce, we’re not friends but we’re also not strangers,” she told Bruce, but the way she expresses it, it feels like the message was for everyone in this room. “We’re something in-between.”
And after that stupid attempt to get himself involved, he hadn’t bothered to try again.
He’s not really hiding per say, he’s basically just not part of their field of vision, just like a bird perched on top of an electrical wiring, you wouldn’t notice it unless you look up.
Then again he could buy, but Pop Tarts.
Loki ran away from rehab because he hated the place.
“A lady shouldn’t sit on the floor,” Natasha whispered as Bruce gave a jerky nod behind the book he was buried in. Natasha smirked before turning back to the two man-child fighting about the current TV situation. “Mind telling me the movie, considering that it’s been changed.”
She wanted to ask them why the surprised expressions, it was obvious that Steve, Bruce, and Tony were just too scared to tell them that they wanted to just head back to their rooms, rather than give this bonding thing another try when they don’t even know how to act around each other. Sure the previous experience was great, even Natasha admits that he found it fun and wanted to do it again, but it was obvious that everyone was walking on eggshells.
“No you’re not.”
“Shit,” she cursed. “I think I have a napkin somewhere,” she added opening her purse before rummaging inside it, successfully pulling out a blue cloth, she started dabbing lightly on Bruce’s bleeding nose. “Are you a friend of Thor’s?”
Tony yawned, not even bothered. “Can’t, I need sleep, and frankly I don’t know him.”
Natasha blinked. “Seriously?” she deadpan.
“We gave my brother some space and—”
The ball was already on Steve’s court, and he found himself internally panicking, what was he suppose to say? That he was hospitalized? That seams reasonable, but before he could open his mouth, Bruce had taken the ball from him and spoke in a deep emotionless voice, and having his face covered in blood while his fist looked beyond murdered, the hair on his back stood up.
It felt so strange that just months ago he was always the center of attention, but with just one (ok maybe a few) mistakes, everything was suddenly gone. It’s like you’re on top of the world then after one wrong step, you’re now barrelling down the mountain, hitting rock bottom.
“Okay, how about your roommates? Any progress”
The next morning Natasha blinked at the note on the fridge.
“But you—”
Clint nodded. “Works for me, Bruce, Nat?”
Clint frowned before glancing down on his phone. “I’m starting to think that anything about me is shit.”
“I wouldn’t say banished,” Steve said. “They still pay for your college don’t they?”
“More like, used your name as an expression.” Clint mumbled under his breath, but was left unheard by everyone.
Putting his fist down, Clint couldn’t help but notice that the other guy was studying him, then he realized it was technically the first time they saw each other.
Bruce stared at the closed duct taped door of the building before sighing. He’s never going to let go of that night, apparently. Slowly pushed the door open, only to see Thor pacing in the living room, his phone next to his ear. His long hair that used to be on a bun was a mess, as if he had been running his fingers through it for the past hours.
Well, Thor gave Bruce the mug, but he guessed that Bruce grabbing it from his hand counted. “Yes,” he moaned. Everything doesn’t seem to work. “But I told you, he had left immediately.”
“It’s a good view,” Bruce said, and he gotta have to give it to the kid, he didn’t even flinch.
The door opened and Thor found himself staring at a lady with red hair. She stared back at him then at Clint and Tony who was just staring at the TV, not bothering to greet her.
“Hey, where the hell are you going?” Tony hissed.
“You’ve never heard of it?”
He felt out of place (as always) not knowing something while everyone seemed to know everything.
Natasha glared at the notes, how she managed to sound like her therapist was not exactly a nice thing to realize.
“No I didn’t.”
The sudden change of emotion threw Bruce off for a bit, but he knew when and not to push. “Not good, but not as bad as Steve’s face.”
When the shaking finally stopped, his first class was about to start in an hour and he barely slept a wink. At first, Clint thought it was just a one-time thing. Ignoring the sudden urge to complain or two hang the man up the flagpole in nothing but boxers, he decided to just get started with his day.
Poking his head inside, the brunette found out that it was the bathroom. So no individual bathrooms, great. He thought grimly. It consists of a toilet, six bathroom stalls, and two sinks. His eyebrows practically disappeared, hiding somewhere near his hairline.
As soon as they entered the threshold, they immediately spotted Tony passed out on the sofa, the television still on.
“I’m Bruce,” he held out his hand.
Tony muttered something that sounded exactly like “still haven’t met the other one,” before downing his cup of coffee in one gulp.
“Taking a nice walk with this friend of yours,” Loki said. “I must say, the world is small.”
She was convinced she finally made her therapist confused because for once he wasn’t writing anything down, he was just waiting for her to say something.
Before he knew it, Steve was back at Building A and was opening the front door. He made a beeline towards the fridge and grabbed a bottle of water, finishing it off immediately. He was about to throw the now empty bottle only to find Natasha standing in front of him.
Jane opened her mouth, but Natasha stood up without so much as a thought. “I’ll help,” she said.
“I’m not,” Bruce immediately said.
From the moment he first met Steve, he was pretty sure he knew what kind of guy he was. Morals and all. Definitely not expecting to face the guy that he was currently conversing with. Tony decided that he liked it, finally, something fun around here.
Sitting on that couch with everyone, he realized that tomorrow morning they’ll go back to each other's own lives as if nothing had happened. And as Tony opened the shower knob, he realized that he preferred that. Maybe that small part of him didn’t want the monotonous routine anymore, but he can’t really see himself befriending any of these people.
It took three more minutes, maybe even more, before Bruce found the strength to continue with his morning routine. Not thinking, and not ignoring—absolutely not ignoring—the reason behind Natasha’s actions. Of course, he doesn’t think that it’s not a good thing, it’s just that he also believes that it could be a bad thing.
Steve snapped his mouth shut immediately.
Steve found himself looking at Tony, well with his one good eye considering that the eye that received Bruce’s mean punch started to swell. Maybe, they’re actually more people like him than he thought. “I’m not an asshole, stop looking at me like that,” Tony said when he caught Steve looking.
He scribbled something on his clipboard before pausing, then looked at her with concerned eyes. “I noticed that these are all men,” he said and Natasha had to fight down the urge to roll her eyes.
It wasn’t, he tried doing it—it didn’t turn out great.
“Bruce calm down,” Steve said, grunting. Bruce’s bloody fist managed to hit him on the stomach, and Steve was starting to wonder where he takes his energy from this kind of body.
It pissed him off, and not even the company of Jarvis would help his mood. But he took his ‘punishment’ like it was nothing, packed his bags and enrolled in SHIELD University. It was where Pepper was learning and it seemed like a good idea staying close to her, he just wasn’t expecting for her to meddle in. Then again, all her decisions have always saved his ass.
He jumped which Thor, bless the oblivious idiot, didn’t notice when the kid was obviously intimidated by him.
“Hey, Adonis, watch it!”
There was a loud crack and a bloodied fist went
“He’s my brother,” Thor said. “What if it’s your family—”
Clint blinked, before realizing what just happened. “Shit, no. I didn’t mean it that way,” Clint backtracked. “Oh and also, I don’t blame you with, you know” He gestured at the door. “This, and everything else, I swear.”
“You know, I spent two whole months in jail back when I was fourteen,” something flickered inside Loki’s eyes. “Rehab sucks, but at least your doing it for yourself.”
“I’ll open it!” He called.
Tony just stared at him, “You just raised a whole lot of questions.”
“Clint!”
“Why are you so against Hammer Tech?” Bruce asked, closing his book. “It’s the second leading brand in technology right?”
Even without his glasses, Bruce can still see pretty well, just not in the dark. He squinted at the large clump of darkness sitting on the dining table. He should be panicking, but he was practically half asleep, leaving him blinking at whatever it is he was looking at.
“Seriously?” Clint as in disbelief. “You’d rather sit this one out? The guy’s unstable.”
At this the therapist paused. “Clint? One of your housemates I’m guessing.”
“No, I—” Steve said, but faltered. “Nevermind.”
Thor turned and found himself staring at a small lady—well, everyone seemed smaller than him anyway, then glancing at the green light indicating that it was safe to cross the street. “Oh, of course,” he fumbled as he pockets his phone.
Natasha glanced at Thor who was out like a light, Steve who was half way there but was obviously trying his best to stay awake, Bruce who was eagerly watching the film with rapt attention, then at Tony and Clint who were still fighting, now over pointless things.
Clint took a deep breath. “Did you ran away from home?”
But nothing seems to be easy.
Bruce, having not said anything for the last five minutes, stared at Steve, his brows furrowed.
As soon as Steve sat his butt down on the chair, Clint immediately fished out his phone.  Tony peered at it and instantly frowned. “Really? Even your—”
Sure, Loki had some problems, but to Thor, he’s not a problem. Sometimes, maybe, but he would never be a burden. “It was just my brother, he wouldn’t talk to me.”
“Well that’s heartbreaking,” Tony really tried, really, really tried. But his mouth seems to have a mind of its own.
Thor nodded. “I see,” he said before staring at him. “You should laugh more, or perhaps smile. I believe it helps.”
“See, a prude,” Tony said smirking, completely forgetting the kettle on the stove.
Bruce took a few steps forward, studying Loki. “Back off the cliff and I’ll tell you.”
Clint leaned down on his chair, already immune with the kid’s ability to glare like he could kill. “Nothing’s free you know.”
… Also, he did asked for her help.
“Thor openly wants to reach out, unlike you guys who would still rather walk on eggshells.” She spoke as if giving a class presentation. “You should start with Thor, he’s more or less just like you.”
Tony snatched the bowl of popcorn from Clint and placed it on his lap. “No one cares,” he said. “And swallow before you start talking.” Tony added hissing.
“Hey, that looks nice.”
Tony went back to staring at the note Clint left on the fridge, when not a few moments after, Steve slowly walked out the bathroom, face redder than a tomato, glaring at Tony as if he somehow sung the national anthem wrong. Tony stared at Steve, now a little confused.
. The heavy atmosphere makes laughing seems so offensive.
And it was true, it’s been almost a week since the movie night and Clint has grown a rather unhealthy fixation about peepholes, he even got Thor convinced that it was a necessity. Natasha was never there to hear any of his complaints, but the notes on the fridge was enough.
Natasha's hobby is people-watching.
By the time Clint got home—which was a little later than when he usually prefers and was doing his routine that consists of consuming Tony’s milk supply, when he noticed four new papers taped on the fridge, all baring a message.
The kid shrugged. “I guess I could.”
“I was,” Tony replied as if the answer can’t be more obvious. “What do you think was I doing here minutes ago?”
Sighing, Steve turned and stared at the digital clock on his nightstand. He didn’t have any class that day, and he was feeling frustrated than ever. One thing he found rather calming when things like this happen, which happens a lot, was to cook.
“I was supposed to say ‘Even your games are shit’, but yeah  Hammer Tech’s shit so I guess that wins.”
But if he’s being honest. He couldn’t help but be a little bit relieved when he hardly sees anyone. In fact, he may have been avoiding them even if it wasn’t that obvious.
“How far back was this?”
And the words that came out next made absolutely no sense to Clint.
Steve blinked a few times, and Natasha was halfway from volunteering herself to show how much of a coward the men in this building where, when Thor bounded from his seat, suddenly fully awake, and ran towards the door.
Tony stared gobsmacked at his phone, a little betrayed that Pepper left him like that. But, then again, he knew better than to wake her up at ass o’clock when he perfectly knew she wasn’t a morning person.
Bruce must’ve said it out loud because the guy whipped his head and stared at Bruce.
, then go to your mom and ask her for pocket money,” Clint said, sitting back down on the bench. “And when you do that, go ask her some fashion advice, while that blouse is pretty, it doesn’t work for you.”
traditional household, then suddenly living in a two-story building with five other people was a huge step for Thor. It was weird and frustrating how different they do things, how they talk, eat, bathe, etc. It was like living in a new realm. He had so many questions about,
“Yes, go ahead and invite everyone,” Tony said dryly. “It’s not like I sat here to do anything,” he gestured at the table stacked with blueprint.
There was another wave of silence, and Thor looked like he was punched on the gut.
Bruce barely heard Tony muttering about his allowance getting wasted on someone he doesn’t know before finally noticing Bruce, his tea still half way to his lips
Bruce didn’t hesitate, with his injured hand, he punched the kid straight on the face. With his lanky body, Loki instantly fell down on the ground, clutching the middle of his face and eyes glaring murderously at the college student.
Bruce visibly gnawed at the inside of his cheek which led Tony to raise an eyebrow—he really needs to stop that habit. “I haven’t actually met the others yet.”
You know there’s something wrong with you when you’d rather be in jail or in some institution rather than the outside world.
Steve found himself furrowing his eyebrows before looking around, looking for anything that could have soured the brunette’s mood. “Did I do something?”
“Just because the damn university doesn’t require first years to live in the campus means I don’t have to, it doesn’t make sense why you’re sending me in this dump when there are perfectly good rooms in the campus dorms,” Tony complained. “I should know because I checked your dorm once—cute roommate by the way.”
“Whoa,” Clint said standing up, causing for the boy to take a step back. “That’s a bit of an attitude coming from a fourteen year old.”
“It was disgusting,” Steve snapped. “Unhygienic, there’s nothing about it that suggests being a prude.”
The thing is, He got drunk last night.
As if on cue, warm  liquid started to seep through his fingers, down his mouth, to his chin, before dripping down towards the ground. Bruce pulled his hand away from his noise and saw blood clinging on his fingers. He sighed, not really bothered, just a little annoyed that his injuries weren’t exactly reducing.
“Mother of—!” He exclaimed staggering back—almost loosing his balance— as both of his hands flew straight to his nose.
The painting in question was of six people, talking to each other as if they were friends since birth, gathered around a table, but with each of them wearing a blindfold.
“My life isn’t
Clint ignored her, which was fine, the redness of his neck was enough.
Natasha’s brows furrowed.
The young man frowned. “And yet you’re making people pay you to live in this weird place,” The older man winced again. “Grade A marketing by the way."
It was nearly four in the morning when he decided to give up trying to sleep and just start the day, maybe the archery range at the campus was already open.
“I-I don’t— What are you—” He stuttered.
The young man turned sharply and raised a brow—he’s been doing that a lot now that he noticed. “What makes you think I’m taking the room?”
“Uhhh… I’m sorry?”
Bruce’s plan on spending his whole weekend in bed was immediately put in flames when Steve called everyone to stay first before they could even retreat back to their rooms.
“Well I’m semi-disowned, so might as well join you.”
Peggy shrugged. “Well, yeah,” she said going back to her painting. “But it’s not empty anymore.”
“I feel like you already know the answer.”
The man turned to look at Tony and huffed out a laugh, “I actually hate this part when moving.”
Bruce adjusted his backpack as he reevaluated his last experiment and tries to determine where he went wrong. Then again, he was working under pressure considering that he was using the labs when it wasn’t even allowed to be used yet.
Bruce’s head twitched to the side, his eyes not meeting anyone, and his breathing was ragged. If the broken door wasn’t enough evidence, then the manic look Bruce was sporting was more than enough that the guy was definitely not having a good day. After seeing all Bucky after the incident, and not leaving his side every time he so much as twitch, Steve knows what an episode is when he sees one.
Loki’s underage, meaning dark alley’s are dangerous for him. The kid’s not that stupid to wander off on his own, that part is obvious considering how well he is on foreign words.
“I do not have time for your games, Loki!” Thor retorted. “What. Are. You. Doing here?”
“I am, by no means, a good person. I’ve destroyed lives, and this is my punishment. Banished from my own family.”
Apparently, his whole plan went wrong.
“I did, but no probing questions?” She said as she fiddled through his phone. “I could have just made a run for it with your phone.”
Thor stared at Tony as the brunette shrugged then proceeded to walk towards the two of them. He dropped his bag, and his…
As he started walking back home—? Thor remembered something as he paused and reached for his phone from his back pocket and long-pressed one. He stood there, at the side of the road, waiting for the other person to pick up. And like the hundred calls he made, he was sent straight to voicemail, it didn’t even ring. Thor sighed before trying again.
Clint glared at him and Natasha fought down the urge to leave and proceed to her room, she had just concluded that the four walls of it were better company. “We’re watching a horror film, I ain’t going to answer the damn door. They usually die first.”
“Why are you here?”
Steve turned to Tony with a glare. He studied him for a few seconds before hardening his glare. “You’re actually serious,” he said unamused.
“Is there something that I’ve said that you didn’t know?” Natasha questioned Bruce dead in the eye.
She was talking and she wasn’t even trying to leave him alone, Thor couldn’t help but feel giddy.
Tony stared at the bright screen of his phone as if staring at it long enough would make it stop flashing 6:47 a.m. and change it to 8:00 p.m. He was pretty sure it was still 8:00 p.m. five minutes ago, where the hell did all the time go?
There was a long pause.
“I see, a start of something new,” his professor repeated with a nod, and Steve was pretty sure there was a smile somewhere.
Clint groaned, but nonetheless, grabbed his wallet.
Pepper simply answered.
“Really?” Steve asked studying his half-finished painting. “I think it’s pretty childish.”
Bruce tuned them out, deciding to turn towards the group. They were all heaving breathes, even Natasha who always managed to look calm and collected… except for that time she first met Loki and Jane.
“Anything wrong?”
Bruce rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to—I thought you were a burglar,” he frowned then saw the mountain of boxes—though it was still a lot less than Tonys', sitting on the living room floor. “Are you the sixth tenant?” Bruce asked pointing at the stairs
Thor had this face that Natasha didn’t like, not one bit. She decided not to upset Thor in the future because she didn’t like the look on his face, at all.
“Yeah,” She smiled and was about to turn around when she suddenly paused before looking back at him. “I’m Jane.”
Natasha narrowed her eyes. “Cause I think so.”
Bruce was about to take another sip from his tea when he spotted Tony walking down the stairs wearing a sweatshirt and a pair of boxers, his hair was all over the place. Bruce’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline, Tony usually doesn’t wake up at this hour—even though class starts today it’s still too early. But then again there’s a bigger chance he hadn’t even slept at all.
“Yes, we know you were about to leave an apple.”
Steve looked away and stared at his work as he felt his face turn red. It still wasn’t enough, but when everyone keeps remembering your works, he guessed the professor’s bound to know him at some point.
“No,” the boy immediately said. “I seek to forget what’s no longer valuable.”
Everything felt so surreal Thor pinched himself.  Sure, they didn’t talk that much throughout the marathon, all the talking was mostly from him and Tony, but everyone was putting small remarks here and there. This was the very first big step that actually happened and Thor couldn’t stop smiling.
If only a certain heir of Stark Industries would learn how to keep quiet.
“Uh, are you—ow!”
“Fine,” Tony answered as he turned to look at Steve. “Steve, open the door and check the asshole knocking on the other side.”
There was an awkward silence as the two of them fidgeted at their spot, Thor at the couch, and Clint standing looking like he would really want to be in his room. Which might actually be true.
Hey guys!!! Happy 2019!!! It's hard to say Happy New Years instead because I'm almost a week late.
“No, no, no, Steve you’re an embarrassment, I take back my good deed, pay up, now. God, you’re worse than Clint.”
“That reminds me,” She reaches out her hand, “give me your phone.”
Then again, he just saw the red-haired girl yesterday morning. He woke up in an ungodly hour with an angry bladder and he saw her leaving the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel. She didn’t even acknowledge him, but Bruce was too busy holding it in to bother.
Okay, he admits that he may have been a little bit rude, but Tony was even worse. Who even leaves their dirty underwear lying around for everyone to see? And he wasn’t a prude, not even close.
Steve suddenly looked sheepish. “Sorry, I was just going to grab a few stuff. You can go home if you want to.”
The owner looked at him confused, “You uh, already paid for the whole year.”
There was silence at the other end of the line.
Another wave of silence enveloped the room, and finally, Bruce wasn’t angry, nor sad, he was just back to being Bruce. Something in Natasha’s message gave them something, hope? Possibility? No one really knew.
Bruce blinked, Tony said something about Loki being a liar, which Clint agreed, is this one of those moments? “What? Loki, what—”
Unlike the previous night, sitting with the others to watch the film Clint borrowed was as awkward as ever. And Natasha found herself looking at four men that would rather touch each other with a five-foot pole than sit on the same couch. The ridiculous space between them was an obvious indication.
Steve grinned as they entered the grocery store.
Steve watched as Tony unlocked Bruce. Steve watched as Clint called for a taxi to take Bruce at the hospital. Steve watched as Thor searches for the first aid kit. Steve watched as Natasha tries to cover Bruce’s bleeding hand. And Steve, Steve sat besides Bruce for comfort.
Tony snorted. “There are more than one shower stall in there.”
A few days passed and Bruce was starting to wonder if the place was jinxed, or if the gods had cursed this building and banned any form of socializing. The other two tenants were ghosts (Tony’s words), and Tony, on the other hand, would always shut himself inside his room creating loud noises that would put mechanics to shame—and also the cause of Bruce waking up at two in the morning and threatening Tony that if he doesn’t keep it down he’ll throw away his stash of coffee.
Thor turned and saw Clint standing by the door, obviously having just entered, who was looking at him. Well, he assumed it was Clint, given with the two purple hearing aids on each of his ears.
Groaning, Bruce fumbled for a bit before finding the switch to turn on the lights. “Turning on the light’s would’ve woken me up better,” he muttered yawning.
Steve stared at his painting long and hard. That day, they were asked to create a small painting outlining the happenings at night, and now Steve was staring at his painting as if it held the answer to life. He hadn’t realized what it is he had been painting not until he was halfway done. It was like the old days, painting without stressing himself over an idea, painting as if it was as easy as breathing.
Ignoring the unnecessary comment, the girl named Pepper clasped her hand and told them to enter the car, walking home this cold and early in the morning would be bad for the skin.
“The pasta you made was extraordinary!” Thor boomed again.
“Huh? Oh, Biochemistry and Nuclear Physics,” Bruce replied as he continued to rummage inside his bag.
Everyone frowned and turned to the door, and truth to be told, a pizza delivery boy was standing outside the door holding a two boxes of pizza.
Jane glanced at him and bit the inside of her cheeks. Thor looked like a kicked Golden Retriever and being able to look like that should be a crime against the law. “Well, I still have one last advice,” She said, “if it doesn’t work, I’m sorry.”
“Am I suppose to know something?” With that, she bit on her apple and left.
It had been a few days since they first met, and Thor found himself hoping to see Jane in the same place they last, and first, saw each other. But, he guessed he hoped too much, that was why seeing her again at the same spot was a miracle to him.
Clint’s eyes were wide with shock, but Natasha wanted to kick him straight on his jewels when he couldn’t keep his mouth shut. “Tony, I think Bruce solved the peephole problem.”
After that, Tony seem to see Steve everywhere he went. Heading for his next class, he would somehow see Steve standing by the gate with his messenger bag. Visiting the library, Steve would somehow end up talking to the librarian. And the funny thing was: Steve's not even following him.
“I know,” She replied, “But pulling you off the bed is entertaining,”
Steve blinked before looking down at the stuff he’s holding. “I, uh, got distracted,” he winced before registering Tony’s words. “It wasn’t half an hour.”
Bruce snapped up when the boiler suddenly shut off. After pulling the plug he pulled out his stack of tea and started placing one bag on each cup. “Tony was right, you know a lot,” he said jokingly.
Sighing, he placed the extra food on a Tupperware and left it in the fridge. It’s not milk, but its still food.
“Bruce,” Steve said tentatively as he slowly stood from the couch, everyone following suit. “You okay?”
“There’s this movie night that we’re trying, the place where I stay, and I thought that snacks wouldn’t hurt.” He didn’t really ‘thought’ of it, he actually planned it.
Steve snorted. “Contrary to popular belief, you’re not my only friend. How did you think I survived my childhood?”
Bruce was never the person to eavesdrop, but there’s always a first in everything.
When he got back, even later than yesterday after having another row with the Archery club president—something about stop using the archery range as a hotel (“I slept there ones! And that was just today!”), he found the fridge with exactly four more notes.
Jane fought off the relieved smile finding its way up her mouth, she had realized that this particular advice was too straightforward when they haven’t even done any normal conversations. Thank god it didn’t work.
Bruce nodded, then there was a pregnant pause. “Wait, what?”
And if Bruce had trusted his eyesight, he would have thought that Thor was smiling smugly at himself as he left the bathroom. But he doesn’t, therefore it took him until he was walking down the path to SHEILD when he realized that Thor couldn’t be that stupid not to know what he meant when he said Jesus.
“Hey, where’s Bruce?”
After successfully putting Bruce under the sink, Natasha immediately pulled out a handcuff and locked Bruce’s right hand on a metal pipe under the sink. Both Steve and Thor let go of Bruce and watched him trash on the floor, trying to free himself while he pulls on his wrist until it turns red.
Even though five of them already lives there, it still feels like one.
“I told you we need a peephole,” Clint hissed.
“I’m just saying how I seem ‘em, Cap,” Tony retorted back.
Nimble fingers slowly grabbed the flowers. “Any occasions why you’re giving this to me?” Jane asked.
Clint paused, then hesitantly raised his free hand to wave at the strange guy.
Bruce could have gotten used to it or had grown tired of rising from his bed just to shut Tony.
“Golly geez!” Steve exclaimed, dropping the bottle. “What are you standing there for?”
She made her way towards her class unaware of the small smile playing on her lips.
“Shoot,” he muttered.
She glared at Bruce and the still nameless girl, before fleeting her eyes at Thor and Clint.
… Actually, he lost count.
), growled.
Bruce squared his shoulders, trying to ignore the cold breeze. “I didn’t said anything remotely close to defending Thor.”
With a twist, the engine roared to life, “If having thirty-three messages and counting isn’t exaggeration, then I don’t know what is.” She replied while backing up the car and swiveling  a U-turn. “And besides, I’ll get new shoes out of this.”
He was trying really hard.
Jane laughed and gave him back his phone. “Of course not,” she said before gesturing back at the phone that was now currently on Thor’s hand. “I placed my number there, in case you want to talk sometime. I realized it was a little stupid that we didn’t exchange last time when you told me that we’ll see each other around. I’m guessing you also go to SHIELD?”
By the time Natasha had decided that staying for the film was not a bad idea, the argument between Tony and Clint had changed drastically.
Bruce shot one of his arms and took a hold of the kid’s…
Natasha raised an eyebrow and glared as she played with the casing of the CD. “Try me.”
No one has to talk, no one has to comment, everyone knew that this kind of silence was needed.
etched on his mind.
Steve almost dropped the brush he was holding and was mentally scolding himself for being so jumpy, before turning around to face Peggy as she stared at his half-finished canvas. Twisting his sore shoulder a bit, Steve placed the brush down and leaned away from his work, giving Peggy more access.
It said.
Before the others could even reach them, Bruce heard Loki whisper so low he almost didn’t heard it. “He’s not even my brother.”
“What are you doing here?” Thor bellowed, and Clint found himself taking a step back. He wasn’t expecting that, especially from Thor.
Bruce blinked, then blinked again, then decided that it wasn’t enough to prove what he’s seeing, he blinked some more before touching the note sticking on the fridge.
He thought it had been long enough, that maybe this time he could keep in together. It was only right to respect the dead after all, even if his father was a complete asshole. It’s been years anyway, sure the memory still haunts him, and some days are the worst, but again it’s been years.
Thor frowned, “Pardon?”
“Did you not ask for it?” Thor asked, confused.
Peggy furrowed her eyebrows. “I don’t think you’ve noticed it yet, but they’re currently seeds.” She glanced back at the two packets before looking back at Steve. “You have to cook it first.”
Jane said.
Bruce winced at the pain, but continued to let her. “Uh, yeah, I guess?” He said. “I live with him.” He then realized the multiple meaning behind that statement. “I mean, I’m uh, you know, like a housemate and—” But then he noticed the far off look she was sporting.
“Mind giving me the rules around here?” He asked glancing around. “I don’t actually have enough experience living with a lot of people”
With only a towel covering the lower part of his body, he placed his dirty clothes on the counter and proceeded to rummage the fridge. That is if he hadn’t stayed rooted at his spot as he stared at the note plastered on it.
Pepper snorted at the other end of the line.
As if on cue, a red-headed girl walked down from the stairs wearing a black tank top, ripped jeans and a baseball cap. She didn’t acknowledge any of them or even spared them a glance. She just went down the stairs and out towards the door as if three pairs of eyes weren't staring at her.
That  made the kid pause, then suddenly Clint found himself on the receiving end of the kid’s famous glare. “Owe you?”
“Shall I too hit you with a book?” The man asked, his voice loud and booming. It was a miracle no one heard him.
Bruce blinked for a few moments, studying Clint. He was never gonna be that type of person, the one who could sympathize or read people, he’d rather just keep to himself actually. But looking at Clint, he could see the same look he used to always see in front of the mirror.
Last month had been one hell of a month, I swear. I never knew school was capable with dumping us with a shit ton of school works. Just looking at it makes my head spin, and I never like doing anything so yeah, it was torture. Again, so sorry for the mega late update.
A sleep-deprived Tony, Captain America boxers, and what Tony believe as a new tradition brewing.
Steve just stared from his position next to his bag and blinked as Thor paid for the pizzas. Natasha hates it when she’s wrong, so she’s going to do something that she likes.
Bruce groaned and squinted against the darkness of his room, before recognizing the voice of his intruder. “Natasha?” he asked groggily.
“Steve?”
“Pep,” Tony warned.
Pepper made an audible frustrated sound that tells him that calling her was a bad idea.
It was a free period and Steve, having no idea what just happened, sighed his way out of the building. The professor from his Graphic Design was young, and he can’t seem to stop from using different references in any form of media. And he couldn’t do anything but sit there and act like he just understood everything.
Only it happened again the following night.
Tony snorted. “Can I call you Captain?” Both guys just stared at him, confused. There was another moment of silence before Tony furrowed his eyebrows. “Rogers,” He said as if it explained everything. “You know, ‘roger that captain’.” When no one laughed, Tony frowned. “It’s like I’m living with new-borns.”
Steve wondered if that was a compliment or an insult.
Steve shook his head and scrubbed at the painting from his palms until the paint was no longer visible.
Clint nearly dropped his hold on the box when he saw that it was the new model of Stark hearing aids. How Tony—or whoever this Pepper lady is, got their hands on a set was beyond him. He even got the right type of hearing aids that he needed. Then again, he technically told Thor to leave it on the counter for everyone to see.
“Bruce!” then followed by a bunch of rapid footsteps.
Okay, bottom line, if it seems made up, it's made up.
“Shut up,” Clint hissed, glaring at the door as if it killed his mother.
“I don’t think it is wise to leave friend Bruce alone” Thor said.
He never had any problem with drawing or painting before. But now, every time he stares at all of his recent artworks, he can’t help but notice that it holds nothing. Ever since that day, ever since he woke up, everything was just so empty.
“I didn’t mean about that.”
“—up, c’mon now.”
The only tenants that he was able to talk to was Bruce and Steve, and he was pretty sure none of them wears a hearing aid.
Bruce rubbed the back of his neck, seems like Tony’s not the only one with a habit. “I dunno, it’s just, I know they’re here, it’s just that I don’t see them a lot.”
Her note was juvenile as if she was trying her best to drag herself in the conversation.
Out of them, Tony and Clint were the hardest to read. And it’s not like she was even trying to read everyone, it was just one of the things she does automatically. She doesn’t understand the fact that Clint was trying so hard, he doesn’t seem so interested in the first few weeks. The sudden fixation threw her off.
“So when will I meet them?” Steve asked leaning one arm on his box.
“You’re not obligated to learn anything about me,” The boy said. “You just need to provide me food.”
Steve blinked at his work as his professor smiled beside him.
“You don’t understand.” Bruce’s voice was shaking. “This won’t just happen once.”
Thor found himself a little angsty, which was new and he had concluded that it is a very uncomfortable feeling, he doesn’t like it. He left Loki another message that morning, which wasn’t answered until now (nothing new), telling him about his newest task. But even with the absence of his brother’s voice at the other end of the line, he could hear him laughing at him.
Clint shrugged, going back to his game. “You missed a hell lot of things.”
In the end, he didn’t back out, which was all Tony needed to know what kind of person he was. The guy's gonna get eaten alive out here.
“Okay, let me rephrase that,” Clint said as he cleared his throat. “Bruce,
“You think you know me, don’t you?” the boy hissed. “You think you can read me?”
Bruce scratched the back of his head, not really knowing what to do. He usually distances himself from everyone, he completely forgot what to do in these situations. Even in a crowd, he has always been by himself.
“Shut up.” He gritted.
The guy continued to glare at Clint before moving his eyes to glare somewhere else with a scoff that sounded so much like “insufferable human beings.”
Rushing out of the building, he barely caught Tony.
Bruce must have noticed his sudden change of reaction, because he visibly tried to tone down and started taking deep long breathes. He closed his eyes and rubbed his temple. “I’m just, bathroom… yeah, bathroom.” He dropped his bag, and proceeded to go to the bathroom.
Natasha shrugged, finally glad that one of the thousand disagreement between Tony and Clint was put to a stop. “Problem solved,” she muttered, which every one still heard (except for Thor of course), before grabbing the bowl of pop corn from Tony.
The lady smiled, and together, they crossed the street.
“Something good must’ve happened then,” The professor gestured at the painting and left before proceeding to check the other students.
It had been weeks since he last moved, and yet he was still unsuccessful. Still alone in Lunch, and still feeling left out in each conversation with the notes. He had always been positive, but now, he could feel a twang of frustration settling on the pit of his stomach.
“If you say one more thing about Hammer tech, you’ll find an arrow shoved up your ass.” Clint threatened while clicking an icon that looks like a ball divided into a red and white color. “It’s the only thing I can buy, alright.”
“Isn’t it too early for classes?”
Clint blinked, then looked down at the flowers shoved on his chest, then slowly looked up at Thor. “Are you high?” He asked.
Steve shuffled a bit from where he was standing, holding the two popcorn packets awkwardly. “Ugh, yeah.”
Thor thrusts up the flowers he was holding, some were wilted and was crusting on the edges, but it still looked fine. Maybe he should have passed that old lady’s garden again, but he didn’t really want another hit on the head. Her cane can rival a baseball bat.
. His long blond hair was tied back in a man bun, and his sense of style rivals a ten-year-old.
They were told to create anything that day, and for some reasons, Steve was brought back to the note he read that morning. And now he ended up painting Clint—or what he thought looks like Clint, for some reasons.
“A pleasant morning Bruce!”
“Look, these stuff, i-i-it happens, usually way worse than this,” Bruce pleaded, as if explaining how messed up he is would let him move out, and by the looks of it, none of them where having it. “I-I’m— I-I-I’m not—”
But in all honesty, she didn’t know why she was frowning in the first place. She wasn’t angry, or sad, it’s more like she was trying to solve something. Which doesn’t make any sense, she thinks that whatever it is the others were doing was childish and she didn’t want to be a part of it, end of discussion. And yet here she was, thinking about it with no reason why it even crossed her mind.
“So, this Clint guy, is deaf?”
Bruce forced his eyes open and came face to face with a lanky teenager.
“That’s because the kid really
That must have caught their attention because the looks on their faces immediately slid off. The next moment, Natasha was staring at two blinking owls rather than the two housewives.
Jane’s words made him realize what he didn’t manage to notice, and when the words registered in his head, he realized that it didn’t sit well on the bottom of his stomach. “I need more advice.” Thor said gloomily “I have not made any improvements these past few days.”
“You still think I’m like you guys?” Bruce asked staring at Steve, but he knew the question was for all of them.
Steve didn’t like what he saw.
And just like that, Loki was snatched away from his grasped, the latter being crushed by Thor in a bone crushing hug.
Thor blinked, his place? Isn’t this their way to befriend someone?
Making a beeline towards the fridge, he was suppose to grab a bottle of water but froze on his spot when he noticed a sticky note attached on the fridge.
Tony paused with whatever it that he was doing and stared at Bruce before clicking his tongue. “Before you go there, I’m gonna stop you right now and tell you to shut up,” he said.
Clint kicked him awake.
“We’re what?” Bruce asked, snapping Clint out of his thoughts.
When it started to move, Bruce snapped up. Suddenly Tony’s claim of ghosts living in the building seemed pretty convincing now.
It was nearly five in the afternoon and Tony, having emerged from his room after unboxing most of his tools, made a beeline towards the kitchenette to make his afternoon breakfast (one toast and a mug of coffee). He found Bruce at the dining table drinking Oolong tea (
“I can’t be late for class if I don’t want Pep giving me an hour-long lecture about maturity,” Tony stated while grabbing a box of pop tarts on the counter. Bruce was about to ask who the hell Pep was but Tony, having noticed the sticky note with the name ‘THOR’ written in bold letters, was staring at Bruce waiting for an answer.
The kid continued to glare before dropping the burger on the table.
Thor pointed at the stairs. “I believe he’s annoying Clint as we speak,” he said not taking his eyes off his his phone.
Until Tony stood up, Clint was about to pull him down again but Tony took a closer step at Bruce, as if what had happened earlier didn’t scare him. Steve was surprised why Tony wasn’t scared of Bruce when everyone seems to be.
“It’s not my fault every nerd out there decided that watching Back to The Future at Friday night is an awesome thing to do,” Clint shot as he continued to fumble around the DVD player. “Hey, the manual here says red cord, all I can see is pink.”
There's Thor, and then there's Loki.
Bruce frowned, he wasn’t really expecting that the guy to still be in college, because he looks like his already in his mid-twenties. Then again, the owner did say that he was preferably taking in college students.
Bruce realized that it's not that bad
Just then, Bruce heard people shouting for his name. It was funny how for some reasons, everyone ended up coming at the same time. Talk about coincidence.
“Is that season one?”
Steve rolled his eyes—something people thought he couldn’t do or to act like a youth in general (“You’re a sixty-year-old man in a nineteen-year-old body” Bucky had once said), and went back to stare at his work. Only this time, he noticed what Peggy noticed.
“No need to state the obvious,” he replied. “And here I thought I wouldn’t be found.” He paused. “Did my brother sent you?”
Clint just stood there, staring at the big blonde in front of him.
“Oh, hey Stewart.”
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed. College professors don’t usually remember their students, considering that there’s a ton of them. Technically, they’re all strangers sharing a class.
Hiking her bag up her shoulder, Natasha left for class.
“That’s far from a threat,” Tony scoffed.
Pepper turned to face him, she smiled, “You’re right, I don’t, but Tony already bombarded me with enough messages and if he started calling me I might lose my shit.” Note; she was still smiling.
“The ghost actually followed her? I thought ghosts are supposed to stay at the placed they’re supposed to be haunting,” Clint asked from the floor as he shoved a fistful of popcorn to his mouth. “En shi dos’t ven lib der.”
As much as possible, I'm trying to make the characters here as normal college students as possible. So don't get confused when their characteristics are somewhat inaccurate.
“Could be other reasons.”
Tony had just sat down next to him when the front door opened.
There was a pause. “I did.”
He took the risk and spoke, “Am-am I? Uh.. Am I missing something?” When Natasha narrowed her eyes, Bruce thought that he should elaborate. Rubbing his nape he said, “I mean, ok, he’s Thor’s brother so, uh, he gets the attention but uhh…” he’s been using the ‘uh’ word a lot, smashing his head on the counter seems like a pretty good idea right now. “Why does everybody, uh, seem to— I don’t know,  feels like he’s going to explode at any second?”
Thor looked back at Tony, his face unreadable, before smiling a more genuine one.
Clint on the other hand just patted—though it looks more like slapping—the empty chair beside him. “You can sit with me.”
Tony asked one morning).
Honestly, his first choice was Natasha, after realizing that she wasn’t a ghost like how Tony seems to assume. But, he hasn’t seen her, or even caught just a glimpse of her yet. And he concluded that by the time he could give him the flowers, it’s already wilted up to its tips.
She was fine with restarting a new life, changing her name, forgetting everything she left behind. She already had a plan, get a job, any job would do, get a flat and spend the rest of her life without needing anybody. But her therapist—which name she never bothered to remember, insists that she needs to ‘explore the world’ as if she hasn’t explored it enough.
“So you’re still using that no-talking-until-my-forty-five-minute-session-is-up strategy?” Her therapist asked. “Fine, but you know, you’re uncle’s not going to be happy when he finds out.”
Thor had this idea that when he finally succeeded in befriending someone, befriending others would be easy, like opening a door. Apparently, he should have listened to Loki more, even if most of what he says is practically insults. That morning, he met none of his fellow borders, and he was sitting alone at lunch, like any other day.
“No, it’s—”
“Up, now.” She ordered as Bruce’s eyes adjusted to the darkness.
Thor blinked, and for moment, he smiled. “You have to admit, it was amusing,” he said, before looking down at his phone. His smile was instantly wiped from his face.
And the way he talks, as if he was really convinced with the idea, made Bruce snort. “So you’re saying you’re not normal because I’m normal?”
Bruce glanced at the door—the hole he created to be more specific—and closed his eyes, as if trying to block something. “I—I’m… sorry about the a—the a, the door. I’ll, I’ll fix—yeah, I’ll just fix it.”
“Well I gotta say something that’s not normal,” Tony explained. “That’s the whole point.”
Sure, he needs to take other classes that need brains—which he’s failing miserably at, but he can manage. There’s nothing he can’t manage apparently. And that’s exactly not a good thing.
Tony turned towards the unnamed man collapsed on the wall beside him. If he hadn’t known better, he would have thought the guy took a shower with his clothes on. But it’s not like he was one to talk, Tony was absolutely sure his white tee’s basically see-through from the amount of sweat he produced.
Thor waited, and it was the most excruciating thing he had ever done in his life. Jane had told him to be honest, and it seemed like a bad idea but he couldn’t really think of anything else. Did he mention that he was desperate?
I know there are stories that has longer chapter, but this is a slow build story.
Clint acquired himself a kid
“I did not understand it,” Thor said as Natasha gave him the combined dollars before adding his onto the pile.
Clint knew he was crossing a line, but the longer he puts it off, the longer it’ll nag him. Shouldn’t the kid be at home? Or in rehab? He shouldn’t bother, he knew it wasn’t any of his business, because really, he should just ignore it, or the the kid himself. But dammit, turns out he’s not done surpassing Tony’s act of kindness.
Steve basically lost the plot by this part, when did Thor became a subject of the conversation? Apparently just now. “Uhh what?”
When Bruce found himself standing in the empty park again, Bruce sighed and sat down on one of the benches. Massaging his sore feet and inspecting his bleeding palms, he sighed again. He had just taken off his stitches on his knuckles, and know there’s another addition to his collection of injuries.
Clearly it was Tony’s hand writing.
“Calm down?” He yelled, “You want me to calm down?” which was ironic considering that his voice doesn’t seem to waver by the second, Bruce thought, “I left my brother alone once—”
Everyone knew what he meant by that. Broken glasses were scattered across the floor, and if Bruce doesn’t seem to look like he’ll do suicide, self harm does.
Bruce felt Clint’s head snapped up. “You’re Pepper?” he exclaimed.
Okay, maybe she should have taken the earplugs, but at least she made her point.
“Hey Pep, how about a little hand? No Tony, I already found you a U-Haul. As if I can’t rent a freaking U-Haul for Christ sake! It’ll help you mature, she said. In what part of the universe will you mature in moving your—”
Having the maximum amount of two hours of sleep was nowhere near Clint’s to-do list, Tony would be the death of him if he continues this up. Maybe karma’s already paying him a visit, which is ridiculous because it’s just a box of milk... well, eight boxes of milk…
Then she realized something, “Point?”
“I swear to god I quit drugs months ago, ask Pepper,” was the words that instantly slipped out from Tony’s mouth, much to Bruce’s confusion.
“I have classes, idiot,” Clint retorted. “I can’t make time just to put a peephole on the front door. And besides, I’m not the carpenter in this building who keeps everyone awake building junk.”
Natasha’s really good at ignoring things.
Sadly he didn’t get any response,
Everyone in the table looked at Bruce, and that’s when he realized that he was the one that spoke up. Clearing his throat awkwardly, Bruce took a bite from his bagel before looking back at them again. “I just want to eat,” he said.
No one was expecting what happened next. In retrospect, it was kinda impossible to even think about it in the first place.
The Steve fidgeted under her gaze. “I, uh, thanks.” She raised one of her eyebrows. “About the notebook,” he elaborated.
There was silence at the other end of the line and Tony wondered if Pepper ended up sleeping on him.
“The kid tried to kill himself for crying our loud.”
. He could just take his hearing aids off and then problem solved.
Ever since that bathroom incident, Tony had leeched on Bruce. Not that he hadn’t leeched on Bruce before the incident, it just went up a notch after. Maybe Tony only stuck himself next him because they’re the only two people that could actually understand each other’s language, but he couldn’t help but notice that Tony’s been rather chummy lately. Which just looked awkward, you can perfectly see that comforting isn’t his strong suit.
Steve ran down the familiar path that he usually took every morning, thinking back towards the movie night that had last night. It went well, considering that Clint and Tony was there. Would have been better if the two wasn’t arguing about everything every five minutes. One of the reasons why he wasn’t even able to apologize.
When Bruce moved in, he was perched on the roof that he secretly climbs from his window. He actually had half a mind to help the guy but decided not to. It was amusing to watch him carry his boxes while he trips on non-existent rocks, how he searched for other occupants in the building while shouting ‘hello’, or how he got surprised seeing Clint’s sticky notes in the fridge.
Natasha just stared at him.
Thor’s eyebrows furrowed, but not in a way that one would think that he was angry, he looked more of a kicked puppy, a kicked golden retriever, a kicked golden retriever that towers most human beings. “I have been receiving similar comments from others, but I cannot help it. I was taught to speak your language this way.”
Shout out to
“Huh?” Jane asked as she blinked hard.
At first, he thought his life couldn’t get any shittier after losing his sense of hearing, but he realized that maybe the accident was a blessing in disguise. For one, he could just leave the other guy, Bruce, to handle Tony and his racket. Also, it’s a good perk when he’s talking to a very annoying acquaintance from campus. All he needed to do was nod and smile and no one will know he wasn’t actually listening.
Because if it’s not a question, then it’s the truth.
“Oh, potato chips!” Steve said.
Steve was apparently missing something.
The noise stopped and Tony’s door popped open, his head peeking out.
A bird.
Tony patted him on the shoulder. “Now you’re getting it,” he said. “And also because you’re a Hammer Tech user.”
Bruce blinked at Natasha, who was surveying the current event. Next to her was Tony, who was blinking way too much to be considered normal.
And again.
Steve’s jaw hardened. “At least I don’t own children’s underwear.”
Jane looked up at Thor. “How are you so sure about that?”
And like the sleep-deprived person that he is, Tony stared at
He thought moving in with other people would bring a little bit of inspiration when he’s painting, and maybe help him get a grip on everything. He wasn’t expecting to feel like he’s living alone in a big place. Granted, he was following his own schedule—the schedule he’s been following ever since it happened, and he wouldn’t expect anyone to adjust for him. But when you don’t see the people you live with for more than a week, that’s not a coincidence.
“Coffee?”
“Fine, Stephens then,—”
Starting up a new day, Thor kept thinking about that sweet woman, Jane, wondering if he would see her again today.
The pretty nameless girl glanced at Clint, then at Thor, before looking back at Clint. “You know each other?”
“Just to put it out there, I don’t prance around wearing just a towel.” Pretending like nothing was wrong was an easier way out, it never usully solves the problem, but it's still easier.
“Huh, what?”
“It’s some shit that got so popular last two years ago,then lost it’s popularity the same year because it’s literally shit. Even I can create something much cooler than that,” Tony explained before frowning. He stared at Steve with a pinched look. “Did you grow up without electricity, because it’s the only reason I can think off why you’re not aware with a lot of shit.”
Steve paused, deciding whether to answer honestly or not. “No.”
“Like a rehab?” Natasha stated flatly, the monotony of her voice started to seem normal to everyone.
“It’s Steve…” Steve muttered at no one in particular in the crowded hall. He was still wondering whether Tony was still angry with the milk situation—apparently he still was, with the conversation (does it even count as a conversation?) he just had with the other guy, when he suddenly registered Tony’s last words. “Pecan pie?”
Clint is basically a bird, minus the wings and the eating of worms. He tends to spend his time hanging on high places: rooftop, terraces, trees, vents (especially vents), and whatever he could reach and fit himself in while eating anything that’s edible. The feeling of staying hidden from others while you have the luxury to watch them gives Clint this strange satisfaction.
“I understand,” Steve suddenly voiced out, earning all eyes on him, he suddenly wants to shut up and hide but there was a nagging feeling that he needs to elaborate. “My friend, Bucky, he also  have episodes like this.”
Tony could practically see her wearing that shit-eating grin he’s all too aware of. “Why the hell would you do that? Pep, I don’t like this place and I’m sure there’s a ghost living in one of the rooms. There’s no way in hell would I be staying here, I told you I’ll give it a chance—hence the tour. But this place sucks, if I end up getting possessed, I’m blaming this on you.”
Natasha didn’t say anything, she just glared at the goatee-wearing millionaire.
Bruce gave it a thought and decided adding where he is before shutting down his phone to avoid future distraction. He needs to speak with Loki first, alone.
It’s three by the way, including the time he helped him move his stuff.
Bruce, on the other hand, sat rather stiffly from his spot before glancing at Tony then back at Natasha and then looking back at Tony. “So, uh, is this a thing now?”
“And I doubt there’ll be a hot girl about to enter through that door!” Tony exclaimed while pointing at the entrance with too much exaggeration.
The boy was quiet for a minute. “I don’t know,” he shrugged. “You tell me.”
“You can back out if you want,” Tony said.
He could have just written where he placed the hearing aid, or he could have just left it in the bathroom. But no, he just had to ask the whole building.
Everyone glanced at each other, then all eyes ended up on Natasha. She raised one of her eyebrows threateningly. “What?” She asked.
Thor frowned. Clint was,
was left unsaid.
“I was,” Steve countered. “You were just too busy complaining about ‘Still Art’.”
Thor thought for a moment, then shook his head. “Not really, but we used to be.”
There were a few seconds of silence before Tony found himself laughing. “Oh my god,” he managed in between laughs. “I’m living with a prude!”
“How are the living arrangements so far?”
Anyway, I am here to inform you that I might be updating at least twice a month until the end of 2018. *dodges rotten fruit*
Knowing that Pepper won’t be of much help anymore, he took his post-it notes before heading out the door of his room, maybe he’ll know the answer when the question’s staring at his face. As soon as he turned the knob and pushed open the door, he immediately saw Steve just heading back to his room, probably just getting back from his early morning run, which was weird because according to Tony’s numerous all-nighter, Steve should have been back half an hour ago.
After everything, she realized trust is something you can’t just give to anyone, same goes with attachment. They’re not here to stay, and the same goes for her. Like everyone else, people come and goes, they never stay. It wasn’t healthy to get attached. And right then, the thing she’s about to do is the exact step to getting attached.
Tony gestured at Clint, as if trying to make reason, “See? Even he says he ran away from home. And it’s Clint.”
The young man’s face scrunched. Giving your car, or any robots—especially robots, a gender is acceptable. A building, not so much, to him that’s just borderline weird.
Clint huffed out a laugh—Thor assumed it was a laugh. “Dude, chill, it’s fine. You don’t need to give me flowers, or whatever it is you do at your place to apologize.”
For the past month, I was nothing but a sack of potatoes doing nothing but sitting on the corner. I was feeling comfortable you know, I promised to update every month and all I can think was "I still had a whole month to update my story, it's fiiiiiiiiiine." Then one day I woke up and it's April fools already. A whole month went by with me writing nothing.
It also didn’t help that she was the only one bothered, or that she was the only one recognizing him.
“Sorry,” Steve said.
Silence.
Bruce had just finished drinking his tea when the front door opened. In came Steve in his jogging clothes, his hair sticking on his forehead.
The thought that Thor had experienced a similar occasion in both of their lives made Steve wonder that maybe: he’s not so faraway after all. That maybe: there’s people just as far as him.
Thor stared at Steve and nodded, with great effort they placed Bruce under the sink having their faces punched and ribs elbowed. He could hear Clint’s comment on how that’ll leave a mark in the morning and Tony’s audible unnecessary wince.
“This is, uh, Building A right?” He asked.
“It’s okay,” he paused. “Just… tell me, anything, anything at all, if you feel weird living with me. I don’t want to be a...” Bruce trailed off, not really bothering to finish the sentence.
He debated whether to drink Tony’s milk or not, but he decided that he’s been an asshole enough, and there’s nothing wrong with skipping a few days. Besides, maybe he’ll get a good night sleep tonight.
The kid paused mid chew and stared at him, blinking. He was still wearing the same blouse and slacks, but finally, about a week ago, he was  able to wear loafers. Clint decided to ignore the fact that it was probably stolen.
Clint is a bird.
Unlike Thor, he didn’t acknowledge Bruce, he just went straight towards the fridge, grabbing Tony’s milk carton—with an exaggerated amount of sticky notes with the word ‘Tony’s’ plastered all over it, and started drinking straight from the box. Bruce just stared at him,
Again, no reply.
A friend of his invited him to a party, who was he to decline? Only when he woke up the next morning, nursing a massive hangover, did he notice that there was only one hearing aid on his nightstand.
Clint laughed this time. “Asshole,” he said. “You’re a little shit aren’t you?” he said laughing.
Clint sat blankly on one of the park benches near campus as he chewed on a hotdog. It was getting harder and harder to get his hands on Steve’s homemade cooking when the whole building realized Steve’s cooking’s godsend. It was getting more and more annoying having to come down and see a note from Steve saying that he made extra again, only to see that someone else already took it.
This time he went back at glaring at Clint, and Clint would really want the kid to look back at his feet. The guy could fucking glare. “I didn’t ran away.”
Thor glanced around the empty table and shrugged before going back to his meal.
And a fucking thief.
And he was right.
Every one of them had their own issues.
“You haven’t bothered to tell me who these are, may I know?”
Peggy groaned as before scanning the shelves herself and grabbing a, to Steve’s opinion, better brand, and much more above Steve’s budget. “Why do I even hang out with you?”
Thor stared at Jane.
Frowning, he took the smallest one, a yellow sticky note with a handwriting as if it was screaming. It read:
“You must’ve done something to make him delete your number again and again.”
Steve took careful steps towards Bruce, who was starting to shake from head to toe. “You okay buddy?”
Thor was trying.
Tony snorted. “Oh don’t worry, I wasn’t forcing myself,” he said. “Humiliating someone’s actually part of my three o’clock schedule.”
“Because he tried to take his own life!”
She wanted to bathe at the fact that she finally made her therapist frown, but she was too busy thinking. “You were about to what exactly?” he asked.
Bruce was a panting mess and he’s pretty sure that he’s starting to loose some feeling on his legs funny when he found Loki sitting by the end of a cliff, the view was as always beautiful, with all the city light looking like a bunch of Christmas lights. Pulling out his phone, he opened their group chat and texted:
And because of Steve’s unbelievable schedule, Bruce found himself unable to start a conversation with him.
“So we’re acquaintances,” Clint whispered earning him an elbow to the ribs by Tony.
“I was so full of myself that I did not know what was going on,” Thor supplied which earned a couple of questionable faces because, this is Thor, the guy that had a hard time making friends was full of himself? Steve had a hard time believing it.
Clint raised one of his eyebrows at him.
Clint continued to click his tongue before leaning in and placing his elbows on the table. “Remember the time when I said something about superheroes.”
“You can have it,” he continued.
“Dude, stop that,” Clint groaned. “Did any of the information I said last night register inside your head? We’re—”
Natasha couldn’t hold off the smirk. “You’ve watched Mean Girls?”
Peggy laughed. “I never said I was,” she said before turning back to her own work.
Natasha sighed and stood up from her seat and walked towards the two bickering housewives. “Boys,” she said grabbing the CD on the counter. “Either fix your shit, or we’re watching without you two.”
“In case you’re not aware, I can hear you.”
Clint was two seconds away from punching the kid on the face. “Kid, can you hear yourself? You ran away but you didn’t ran away?” he asked not amused. “I’m this close in committing child mistreatment.”
much. Act interested, but not too interested, that’ll put them off, but not in a bad way.”
“Good thing I don’t care about them,” Tony said, this time his voice was laced with something Bruce can’t quite pinpoint, but something was there. “I have parents, not a family.” then he just left, muttering about unnecessary wake up calls.
Taking her eyes of Thor, she glanced around the living room and bit on her apple. “If you’re all going to sit like statues for the rest of the evening, I’m going to call it a night.”
He knew it was stupid, and he never should have done it. But Thor just looked so much like a kicked golden retriever that he couldn’t force his stupid mushy self to ignore Thor's obvious hard work in getting to know them. It just reminded him of the days he was in the circus, where no one would take a kid seriously. Next thing he knew he was asking people about the next movie-thing-whatsoever, tracking each one of them to get physically involved unlike his brother, Barney, who he spent most of the time imagining back then, and having to actually buy a DVD player that fits his budget.
Tony stared at him for a full minute before whipping up his phone. He typed something for a few seconds before shoving his phone in front of Clint.
Jane said, her voice groggy.
“Uhh, hey Thor, I think you should calm down, take a deep breath or something,” Clint said, it was probably the wrong word to say.
“I ought you to know,” he said, still looking at his feet. “I’m pretty good with fooling people.”
Thor just really want's to fit in.
Even sleep.
Clint’s commentary about the DVD player finally snapped Tony away from his glaring competition from the poor piece of tech. “Can we just throw that thing away?” he suddenly said, causing for the blond next to him to flinch. Natasha noted the awkward way Steve tried to move further away from Tony. “It’s outdated, and worst of all, it’s a Hammer tech.”
The boy’s green eyes, Clint noticed because he was too damn close, glared at the offending hotdog before looking back at Clint. “I demand you to buy me one of those.”
Bruce paused, suddenly wondering if Clint’s having a small breakdown and realized that he wouldn’t want to be living with a freak of nature such as himself. Sure he admitted to being a thief back then, but he never killed anyone, and nothing’s really wrong with living with the circus. No one can really chose the situation that they’re born into.
depressing,” Steve countered as he fished out a couple of bills to pay for their art supplies, “And I had friends, one even stayed with me until now, his name’s Bucky and—”
And he can’t just buy any other cheaper brand than Stark’s. Stark’s the only brand that can actually let him hear, not garbled sounds his old hearing aids used to supply. If he wants to graduate from college and avoid going back to his old life, he needs to hear.
“My first choice was lady Natasha, but I have not met her until now, and I have concluded that the flowers won’t stay pretty once I met her,” He said. “But you’re a lady, and I like you. So, do you like it?”
“If you like, we can proceed to the bedrooms?” The owner asked hopefully, gesturing towards the stairs.
“I’m Thor,” Bruce raised both of his eyebrows. Thor sighed. “I believe my parents were intoxicated when they named me and my brother.”
“He’s currently not in a great place, I know, ” she said as they both strolled out the shop. “The point is, if you don’t know me, then who would go shopping with you?” Peggy rambled, her hands flailing. “Let loose a little, try interacting with other people. You’re like an old man stuck in a younger body.”
He’s one of the greatest minds, built his own circuit board when he was four, graduated MIT when he was seventeen, the only heir to Stark Industries, and probably the most egotistical jerk to walk the planet. No human at his age had reached his accomplishments and yet here he was, going back to college when he already got himself a Ph.D.
Steve was still glaring, which was in no way Tony’s fault. Or to be more precise, it did not make sense whatsoever. It wasn’t
Tony turned towards the guy and concluded that he looked worse than him. “Something tells me you don’t do this kind of stuff.”
He wasn’t an art major because he was stupid, he’s just lacking knowledge after everything that has happened. It may not look like it but Steve really did like art.
There are no current pairings because I'm still deciding what pairing I should choose, I would like the story to progress a little more before deciding.
He’s famous, a person who grew up with people praising his every move, and yet here he was.
Splitting up was his idea, so he really can’t blame anyone but himself as he glared at his bruised knee and skinned palms. For all he knows, that additional step shouldn’t even exist.
But telling everyone that you bought a century old DVD player seemed so pathetic, unless he collects old shits that nobody wants. The things he do for… for, well, nothing. He just does it, and he couldn’t find the reason why.
Tony was barefooted, hair still dripping wet, dirty clothes thrown on the counter for the whole world to see, but all he did was stare at the note on the fridge.
It was Clint’s turn to scoff. “Yeah, right.”
He didn’t.
Her right hand slowly raised, torn between slinging off her bag from her shoulder and not.
“What do you want to watch next week?”
“God, shut up already,” Tony hissed. “If you want to put a peephole on the door, then put one.”
) before looking back at Thor. “She doesn’t like nicknames,” he supplied as the others greeted her, Bruce with a sheepish wave and Steve with simple “hey.” Tony seemed to be more interested at glaring at the DVD player.
Natasha didn’t answer.
“Does electricity exist in that house?” Peggy asked falling in step next to him. “How about internet connection? Or was the house situated at the top of a mountain because you could only be a hermit if you’ve never heard of this song.”
“No one cares, Barton” Tony said.
Tony stared at their hard work and wondered if he could persuade Pepper to buy him an apartment instead—it’s not that late to change minds right? He could barely drop a needle in the room without hitting anything.
