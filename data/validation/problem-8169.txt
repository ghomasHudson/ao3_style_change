Steve decided to reply to that with stubborn silence. Even if he did appreciate the sentiment, especially from Wanda, he had made his feelings on the matter clear enough; he didn’t need to elaborate further.
Surprised by her knowledge of what was happening, Steve turned to Natasha to gauge if she has been the one to spill the beans, but she only shook her head in amusement at his betrayed expression.
“This was probably the only agreement Pepper managed to force out of Rhodey.” replied Happy with simpathy in his eyes. “She did mention that he wasn’t exactly…
couldn’t repress a smile.
approval instead. Just the thought of it made him wince.
“But you have to remember that I was just angry and I didn’t really know you and it–” Tony started in a rush.
me into this!?”
Anthony’s fascination over his horses had significantly helped Steven's initial crush on the noble evolve beyond the unthinkable long time ago. Well, what felt like long ago only had been four years and counting.
“Are we talking about the article that says that your… Steve” he finished lamely “is cheating on you with what the media seems to think is a waitress?”
Steven grinded his teeth while efficiently saddled Mephisto, but when he went to prepare Vision for Anthony to ride, he was stopped by the very guy that he wanted to punch in the face more than anything right now.
For Tony, that was as close to an “
“Of course you thought that," With a frown taking place on his face, Tony pushed himself completely off the couch and started to put his pants on, completely forgoing his underwear that was nowhere to be found, “Because you’re Captain America and whatever you do is considered by your book as the right thing, isn’t it?”
“Hey,” Anthony whispered soothingly, petting his hair lovingly. “Nothing happened. You didn’t lose me; you saved me, as hard as it is for me to accept it,” a strangled chuckled against his neck tickled Anthony a little, so he smiled in response, “This won’t happen again.” The scoff made it clear how Anthony's last few words weren't believed the moment they left the noble’s lips. “Fine; I’ll try to make this happen as little as I’m able.”
Anthony didn’t have much time to reproach himself his weakness when a strong hand gripped his upper arm not-too-gently and pushed him to his feet in haste as if he weighed nothing. “Tony! Keep running towards the cabin! I’ll cover you!
"So?!" Janet asked the second the doors opened and pushed her way to the front, "What happened? Are you guys finally together?" she finished with an excited clap of her hands.
“No.” his alpha ordered firmly. Steven pulled him up towards the headboard until their lips were aligned. Sky blue eyes met deep ocean blue; both pairs of eyes dancing with mirth. “I know of a better way for you to make it up to me.” The blond said suggestively.
“Steve?” the familiar voice calling him from the doorframe of their room made him relax at least a little. “Are you okay?”
boyfriend in what could only be called a possessive grip, and the colonel seemed to be concentrating more on glaring at the super soldier in full hatred mode than embracing his friend.
“And you were doing so well,” Tony said with mock hurt. “Besides, it doesn’t matter, Rhodey, I’ll probably end up forgiving him even if he did kiss that woman.”
" a traitorous voice whispered inside Steve's head, but he quickly brushed it away.
“Well, yes. That’s what mature relationships are about, but you do realize that if you left it to Tony to fix your arguments, you’d have already broken up, right?”
“You are, and you are in horrible denial.”
, Steve decided,
true. Steve knew that Tony wasn’t as bad at relationships as most people would probably expect of him, given his reputation. Though, Steve was happy when he’d realized that if you put all of Tony’s insecurities and truly horrendous self-esteem issues behind, he was actually pretty good at it.
on us?” Tony asked incredulously and probably a little offended, "what is it today? The 'play-with-Tony's-life-and-decisions' day? What the actual fuck?!"
happened?”
“Gah!” Rhodey yelled in exasperation, “Stop! I told you I wasn’t doing your thing with Pepper.”
“Yeah, I already ate breakfast before I went jogging so I’m going to make sure he eats.” He lifted the tray full of food and started his way towards Tony’s workshop.
“I’m Tony’s best friend. I’ve been with him through it all, Captain; his loneliness, his drinking problems, his parents passing away, the fucking rapist–”
It couldn't get better than that.
“Come on, Tony,” Jessica Drew and Jessica Jones came to drag the genius up the stairs with Natasha leading the way. “Let’s prevent the weirdoes to get drunk before ten in the morning and give Steve some privacy to make himself presentable before he passes out or becomes red permanently.”
you have to tell me,” his lover demanded with clear indignation on his behalf and Steve thought that was adorable. “Did he call you?”
I made this at first with the intention of it being part of my series, but you know how this is. I am thinking about making a short epilogue, but let's see.
, so that he can stop denying it and we can, you know, have an honest conversation to end this nonsense.” He finished shyly.
She admitted shortly after his cuestion, but she now sounded a little amused
James Rhodes wasn't a news fan. It was too much drama and easy sway into believing anything the reporter was payed to say. Written words were better for him, easier to read between lines. He learned that a long time ago.
“Holy
“You do know that I only want what’s best for you, right?” Rhodey held his serious expression while asking this; he didn’t want to give Tony the chance to minimize his words with mocking or sarcasm. Not with this.
“Yes, she is scary like that…” Tony agreed with a shudder, “So let me add to what you just said that the fact that she includes you in her schemes of world domination is so unfair in
This time, Tony’s shock at his own honesty didn’t last long. His face went from astonished to confused to furious in no time. Steve let the shorter’s hands go so the genius could properly flutter them around to punctuate his righteous fury.
“Rogers! Stark!” Rhodey heard a little crash and a curse courtesy of his best friend as a response and couldn’t help but to smile a little at the mental image of Tony hitting his head as retribution for giving the colonel the worst day off ever. “Don’t you fucking dare! Get the hell out of my house, before I start shooting through the door!”
When the silence that followed his statement stretched, Steve gave himself the chance to close his eyes and take a calming breath. When he opened them again, Tony was already at the door ready to run away from him. Again.
“You haven’t been up there for a while now and I thought you could be hungry,” he explained simply, lifting the try so it could grab Tony’s attention to what's over it.
“We’re here.” Happy announced while he was pulling over in front of what looked like an extremely exclusive coffee shop. “This is Rhodey’s favorite coffee place.”
But they would never be even because Steve knew that Tony not only surpassed all his expectations, but he really
“I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried everything normal and not-so-normal and I had accomplished nothing to fix this. I need alternatives, options, and I don’t know anywhere else where I could go for an extraordinary solution but here.” Wanda kept an unresponsive silence as her way of letting him finish blurting information. “I need something to make someone tell the truth.”
I hope you enjoyed the story and that you leave your comments and constructive criticism. As always, I will appreciate it.
“For fuck’s sake, Steve! What the hell do you think I'm talking about? I'm obviously talking about everything that has happened in just this short hour! About the fact that you
It wasn’t long after the tragedy that Lord Obadiah, Anthony’s godfather, came to the castle to stay. Steve following his arrival a month later.
“Tony,” Rhodey called for him to further explain. When the genius didn’t seem about to open his mouth or at least look at him anymore, Rhodey decided to push it, "
He was so screwed.
And Steve’s mind went blank just for the voice alone. When he processed the words and stuttered for a response, Pepper had already hanged up on him.
This couldn't keep going and he wasn't about to give up on Tony. On
“Tony, for the last time, I swear to God! I was shocked and didn’t know how to pull back without physically hurting her.”
“Of course,” he conceded easily. “I feel like I own him a lot considering that looking after
off.” He tried to slam the door in his face, but the cheating bastard’s reflexes still were of a super-soldier and kept the door open.
, he realized.
Tony’s astonishment was so obvious that Steve had to stare a little. The super soldier knew that the genius couldn’t deny the truth of his words anymore. However, that was probably why the utter

“True,” Natasha confirmed simply, a pensive scowl on her face.
feel every time I watch you flirting with anyone, as you often do, let me add."
“I don’t want to end anything! I want you to apologise immediately, you ass! Tony raged at him. But then seemed aware of this own words and became even angrier. Judging by Tony’s furious expression, Steve knew that he was planning on saying something completely different and hurtful, but not honest enough to pass the Honesty Serum's test. Before Steve could apologise again as he was asked to do, Tony decided to keep their horrid tradition when he probably thought that it was enough honesty for the day and went for a hasty retreat, “If you’re not getting out, then
“Oh, I see…” Something in Steve's voice was strong enough for even Wanda to notice something was wrong with him and stopped working her potions to look at him more closely. The supersoldier probably wouldn’t have noticed the unexpected interest in her if she hadn’t approached him cautiously as if not to spook him. Steve decided to change topics before he made a fool of himself. “So, it’s been a while, how have you been? What have you been up to in here?”
mean I have forgiven you, sweetheart."
“I said to him that you’d insinuated that I was nothing but a spoiled brat who made himself an expensive toy in order to cure some of my boredom; that you told me that I just fought for myself and didn’t give a damn about anyone else and that I should stop acting like a hero because I was too selfish to ever become one.”
him-, the genius decided to cut the supersoldier some slack when he slowly closed the remaining distance between them. Willingly, no potion involved. Tony kept eye contact with Steve right until he dove for his lips the last millimetres, finally letting his lids drop. Steve didn’t dare to move nor breathe in fear that Tony would snap out of it as he did moments before to keep yelling at him. He hardly believed that he could be so lucky as it was.
“Well, if he’s such an asshole you should fucking ditch him and go find someone more suiting to your perfection!” Tony said in obvious frustration, yelling the last words. And now he was back to that nonsense. Sometimes Steve just wanted to punch some sense into him. Or simply just punch him. That was probably why he walked to the opposite wall from where Tony was yelling at him; he didn’t want to do something he would surely regret. “Believe me; he’s not worth the trouble, so why don’t you just leave him the hell alone!”
dawn, when the danger of the woods is at its minimal.”
It wasn’t long before Tony closed his eyes and responded with emotions of his own; fear, despair, sadness, insecurities and, under it all, love.
Before anything hit Peter, though, Bucky Barnes seemed to miraculously materialise in front of the kid, shielding them from the unavoidable bullets with his metal arm.
“True.” He teased with a smile. “So let’s get to the part that started all of this: What was the Colonel's response to
(See the end of the chapter for
“Keep your cheating mouth shut, Rogers, you’re making a scandal.” The colonel demanded. If Tony heard and confronted Rogers before he was calm and ready, it could only end bad. However, the second the words left his mouth, Rhodey knew he had fucked up. His insisting that Tony wasn't there just made itself an obvious lie for the simple detail that he owned the whole floor and no one would really be able to hear them even if they were screaming bloody murder and going for the guns.
” Steve stated without a pause. Tony’s shocked expression only served to fuel Steve’s rage. Just remembering Tony’s wrecked face when he’d been introducing him to a girl from the genius' office had made Steve want to take Tony right there and then in front of everyone to witness. So that everyone knew that they belonged to each other. That's why he had cornered Tony in the kitchen the moment they were alone in the first place before all this ridiculousness even started. Even now, the urge hadn’t gone away and the billionaire wasn’t making it easy to ignore. “Why is it so darn hard for you to believe it!?” he repeated in frustration.
Denying himself the human instinct to submit before the sudden fear that traveled through his veins, he kept the same rhythm as before, knowing that if he fell, the wolf would get an advantage that he couldn't afford, therefore he kept his eyes on the soil surrounding his steps, searching for any unwelcomed pieces of nature that stood over the ground and seemed determined to make him trip.
"Steve, I just don't think that–"
“Nothing, since Dr. Strange is not here. But it was really great to see you again, you should go to the Tower sometime, it would be nice for you to visit more often, I'm sure everyone would like to see you're doing well.”
Steve moved slowly, as if not to scare Tony any more than he already had. He felt his own heart breaking at the pain he was causing his love, but he had decided that there was no turning back. He took his beloved’s face between his hands again and forced him to look directly at his own. When his sky blue eyes met Tony's dark blue ones, the genius’ eyes turned glassy, imploring. A dry sob escaped his lips.
Tony could breathe again. This experience could leave the genius with significant heart and brain damage.
He needed to change tactics.
“Okay, okay, calm down, keep your panties up, I'll explain: we had a date, at that fucking restaurant,” he said pointing at the now shriveled newspaper as if it offended him, “I was working late, so I told him I’d see him there. Regardless of my best efforts I was 30 minutes late, but considering my record, he probably was expecting it; I was giving my keys to the Valet Parking and when I looked over for our usual table – in the corner and next to the window –, he was there, kissing that… woman. She had her arms around his neck and he had his hands over her hips. I freaked out. I snatched my keys back from the poor boy and decided to drive all night so my head could believe my eyes or whatever.” Then he looked over himself as if appraising his attire for the first time, "The shirt will have to be a story between drinks. Strong drinks." He finished with a fake smirk. “Then I came here and the rest is history.”
“Tony, stop changing the story-”
“So let’s call this
“No, I don’t,” Steve replied anyway with new found determination. “This is very important to Tony, even though he is denying it probably for the sake of not bothering me.” He explained, "But is not like I'm easily insulted and I'm far from easily defeated. I'm not that kind of person."
Then, perhaps they would be disrupted by a sound in the forest, usually a singing bird or a gentle push of the wind swaying the trees, and be reminded that they should get going, Steve always being the first to put his foot outside The Circle. The walk back would be bearable, amazing even, because they would hold hands on their way to the castle while talking about what had happened over the time they last saw the other freely like that.
“If that’s what it takes, then yes.” He accepted with determination, the words more for his sake than for the witch's.
"Hey, it's too early in the morning to start attempting to empty my alcohol cabinet!" Tony yelled after them. Then reflected his words and added, "At least leave something for me!"
Like Steven, Bucky was tall and had well-formed muscles that held the posture of a confident man. His blue eyes were more of a pale, almost grey, colour and his squared head held a strong jaw, but not as sharp as Steven's. His hair, in contrast with Steven’s blonde, was a mess of black waves that seemed untouched but for his fingers. Sometimes it reminded him of Anthony's dark hair, even if just for their mutual habit of combing it with his fingers when no one would actually force an actual comb on them.
"You know I hate it when you say stuff like that. Please stop, you are upset because you think one day I'll leave you for some girl." Rogers said. Even for Rhodey's ears, it sounded as if the mere thought was ridiculous for the blond. "I understand how you feel because that's exactly how
One rich beyond measure, the other forced to work for the day. But that was what made Steven different, no matter how poor he was, he was ambitious enough to not just think in living through the day; Steven was a planner, always trying to be better, to try harder to be useful to the ones he loved.
“A pleasure as always,” Hogan complimented politely, “And answering your question, Pepper didn’t exactly send me for the boss; she told me about your conversation last night over dinner and I thought it would be a good idea to contribute a little to the little assault you three seem to have going on now better than later so you can get this over with, if you don’t mind.”
Hank sighed and followed them for a second choose-the-movie fight of the day.
“I just want you to be happy!” Tony said defensively, matching his rise of tone and instantly crossing his arms in front of his chest.
just to
“Then maybe you should talk to him,” Jan suggested, putting a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Clear things up.”
“I agree,” Natasha backed her up with an almost identical look.
“Really?” Jan asked now bouncing in excitement, “When
“What is it?”
Steve always considered himself, overall, an honest man; not needing to resort to any form of foul play to get the job done and trying at all times to fulfil his goals in the most righteous way possible. He was a man who knew what he wanted but preferred to go to the moon and back to get it rather than to find shortcuts and get an innocent party hurt just so he could obtain anything the easy way. He was Captain America, after all.
Maybe Tony was a little oblivious sometimes, but really, the Colonel wasn't even pretending to like him, and Tony was a genius, after all.
“Because, even if we are both selfish in our own ways,” Steve explained patiently,
the best thing that’s ever happened to you.”
She clarified without cutting around the bush.
half of the gym’s equipment!), and the way you pulverized your unbreakable Starkphone, I can only assume that he didn’t like your conversation on the phone.”
In a blink, Steve’s disc had hit one of the thug’s head and the other one was being chocked by Black Widow’s tights. However, it was too late, the bullets were already flying and no dexterity could avoid so many bullets at such a close distance.
of time, frankly, but let it go for now.”
The plan was simple; he just needed to mix the potion with Tony’s morning coffee and he would either keep him in the workshop or, if he got difficult, he’d take him to an already rented hotel room by force and throw the key down the toilet.
Over the corner of his eye, Tony saw a couple of AIM soldiers aim at his son’s back. Tony recognised the look in Peter’s widened eyes as his spider-sense warned him, but one of the goons had a machine gun, “Peter!”
, you said that you worry, but you
“Anytime, Cap.” And before he could step on the gas, he added; “Sorry about the future harassment you have to endure, but I have my money on you, so good luck!"
He hung up on him.
“But you deserve better than that.” Rhodes was tempted to follow his sentence with a complete catalogue of despiteful adjectives that could describe the icon, but he knew it wasn’t the way to get through to Tony, the genius was loyal; the more he insulted fucking Rogers (he could insult him in his head), the more Tony would stand up for him. He was weird like that.
When it came to Tony, he wasn’t the perfect soldier everyone expected him to be. Tony, Pepper and Happy were all he had left outside of his military friends and he was willing to leave behind stoic professionalism and welcome raw emotion if it meant Tony would be safe and sound in consequence; even if that emotion often entitled him to knock some sense in the genius’ hard skull.
“Listen to yourself, man!” Rhodey said with exasperation, throwing his hands to the air to emphasize. “The man is a super soldier, for fuck’s sake!” he paused to calm his nerves a little before continuing, “Tones, you’re either being cheated on or you’re not. You can’t be both, so what
“Don’t push your luck, Rogers.” Steve turned back to offer a confident smile in response. Rhodes just shook his head as if regretting giving him a chance in the first place. When their eyes met again, the hostility was back on full power. “If you ever break, make unhappy or hurt him in any way, I’d recommend you to stay low for a long while, Captain, ‘cause all the Air Force will be tailing your ass to make sure you don’t show up your face on the surface of the Earth ever again, do you copy?”
“More nervous than when you were going to tell us?” asked Jan, bemused. Tony had almost passed out when she’d lecherously asked him, in the middle of a movie night when they were the only three present, about the Stark-sounding-moans coming from Steve’s room the night before. When Tony had refused to answer her, and Steve was a speechless, blushing mess, she’d told them she already knew they were together and that she had tons of proof to back her up, so they should probably stop trying to hide their relationship.
“I told him the truth, Rogers;” Tony was using the tone of voice that was clear for anyone that knew him that he was upset, “that I saw you kissing another woman before I arrived to
Jarvis. Steve hadn’t thought about Jarvis. Either of them.
It didn’t take a genius to know who it was, but it took a lot of Rhodes’ will and control not to simply grab one of perfectly hidden guns in the apartment and start shooting through the door. He was pretty sure he had a sniper rifle under his bed.
“Which I didn’t need to know–”
“No. We were just talking and he was just… We were just talking about-”
?! You provoked me a heart attack! I
And that's it for now. This is my first R rated fic ever and I blushed while writing every word so please do comment on my success/failure.
“It wasn’t nice from any of them, including the boss.” Happy agreed not taking his eyes from the road. “So imagine my surprise when the boss, out of nowhere, told me how
Pepper decided,
“Shall I prepare four horses, my lords?” Bucky asked, looking at Kahn in question.
“Well?” Lord Obadiah dared him to comment on his actions. And that’s when Steven realized something; the evil lord was talking insistently to the stable boy. Something completely unthinkable in the days before when the lord used to pretend he didn’t exist.
“No! Of course not!” Steve clarified in earnest. The single purpose of this whole thing was to be able to care for him the way Steve wanted to -the way they both wanted to, damn it- and to stop the horrible and torturous dance they kept doing. “I just want him to tell me the truth, just
"It's because they were doing it like rabbits," Logan clarified, adding to Steve and Tony's mortification, "I wasn't aware of how emotionally stunted they were."
"Yes, we are together." They blurted out and looked at each other; Tony with an accusing glare and Steve with an apologetic smile.
The way things were going, he was probably condemned to be threatened by Dummy as well. Now that he thought about it, the robot probably did try in his own way when he first met him. Thank God that he passed that test with flying colors if Dummy’s robotic affection was any indication.
“Lord von Doom wanted to show Anthony his impressive horse the moment I mentioned my godson’s love for the beasts,” Obadiah responded to the stable boys' surprise. He usually deigned himself too much to speak to the likes of them, but Steven realized that he wasn’t really speaking to them, it was more like an indirect reprimand to Anthony, “It is unbelievably thoughtful of him if you ask me, do you not think so as well, Anthony?”
Steve, being Captain America and all, wasn’t convinced that their conversation could realy mean the end of the whole situation. Things were never that easy no matter the finality in Tony’s voice. Instead, he gave Tony a well planted kiss and before it could turn into a passionate one, he pulled back and continued with the topic at hand.
“Yeah, it really is important to Tony,” Steve added, thoughtful. “He was really nervous when he told me he thought it was time for him to tell Rhodes about us.”
Steve took the opportunity and he grabbed Tony’s pushing hands from his chest and held them between his bigger ones, “Do you want me to?”
” Was the dry reply after just the first ring.
That made Tony jump out of his chair and spin around to look at him with surprised, nervous eyes. Steve could see now the deep circles around his blue eyes. The defence stance the genius took at the sight of the supersoldier, though, was somewhat insulting, but he had to fight the sudden desire to make sweet, slow, protective sex to him to show the genius he wouldn’t ever hurt him.
Maybe Tony wouldn’t be that pissed if he just dodged?
“Sir, what I was initially trying to tell you is that Captain Rogers is here.”
This time Steven had to be restrained physically by Bucky. There was an instant when he couldn't care less for the consequences;
“All night,” he confessed for the sake of having a little fun at his lover expense. “He wouldn’t take no for an answer.”
“Steve…” he tried to yell in surprise at what the presence of the shield represented without daring to take his eyes away from it. However, Anthony knew that it probably sounded more like a relieved sob that his alpha had arrived at last and was there for him. The brunette's pride could take a downfall for all that he cared at the moment; he would have time to regret his damsel in distress attitude when he was alive and safe between his saviour's arms.
“I want to ask him about his true feelings for me,” Steve answered truthfully, “I don’t want to keep asking his eyes or his body; I want to hear it from him so we can stop tormenting each other over this and actually start enjoying it as it’s supposed to be. Life as superheroes is short enough as it is and I'm done with us being on different pages because he wants to be a martyr. I won't give up on him.”
Making sure that Tony had no more demands, Steve's answer was simple: “I want that too, Tony,” he said with conviction, even the apologies were meant to last for all their lives and that was something Steve was willing to do for Tony. His genius finally let Steve close the distance between them enough for the supersoldier to put his hands over Tony's shoulders, “So what stops you to make it all happen? What's going on in that brilliant mind of yours?”
So he went looking for Doctor Stephen Strange.
“And you said
statement coming from the love of his life. A statement that meant that even with all the transgressions the Steve committed in order to be here, hexed like this, Tony could still build a wall separating them. But Steve had gone too far already and he couldn’t leave it like that. He refused to believe that they were going through all of this for nothing.
“Just a little longer?” He rests his head on Steve’s chest and lets himself float. “Want you to fuck me against the wall next time.”
“Yes. You’re in charge.” Tony tries to move against Steve but he’s held fast. “Please, sir. Please. Please. Please. I’m yours. All yours. Wanna feel you come.”
Pierce revels in boasting about how he was the one who cursed Steven in the first place. All because a wizard had come to Pierce with his own prophecy about how Steven would be his downfall. Steven stares at Pierce, all sorts of questions vying to be asked first. When he can't decide what to ask, and wanting to keep Pierce talking, he blurts out how he's curious how Pierce had managed to stay so young. A booming laugh is the response he gets and Pierce shows him the bottles of potions he uses to retain his youth. Inside each bottle is the youth of one of Pierce's people and Steven is absolutely disgusted. Pierce does not even notice, words spilling from his lips about how when the prophecy didn’t change, he provided Rumlow with another potion and sent him to wake Steven.
When Margaret wakes, she looks over and finds Sarah crocheting next to her. “How long?”
“This is where they came from. This one,” He points to the flower that resembles a pink daisy, but with a lot more petals. “Is a pink aster. Since it kind of looks like a daisy, I thought you might like it. And this one,” his fingers brush over the lush petals of the other flower, “is a peony. It’s one of my favorites. I’ve always liked how they kind of look like roses, but softer.”
Roth and Jarvis are waiting for them at the doors, both impatient to get them ready. The valets take one look at them and shake their heads, knowing exactly what they'd gotten up to. Roth takes Steve up to change while Jarvis pretends to do the same. As soon as Steve and Roth are out of sight, Jarvis straightens Tony's jacket and goes to visit his wife. Tony hurries to his forge to collect his gift. He checks the shield over one last time, even though he knows it's perfect. The metal itself is shining and bright and Tony gives one last yank on the leather straps to make sure he's attached them securely. Jarvis has also left him a shirt and waistcoat to change into and Tony could jump for joy.
“Yes.” Tony lifts his glass and toasts Steve. “To us.”
“Just on the top of my head.”
He can hear Steve praising him and he moans around Steve’s length. Just as he hoped, Steve’s hips jerk and Tony swallows around him.
Tony shivers as Steve moves behind him. “Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. I’m nervous. I like seeing you.”
Steve’s other hand moves to Tony’s hip and he squeezes gently as he moves. “So close, Tony.”
In the bedroom, Steve sets out a pair of blue silk sleep pants and nothing else. He knows Tony will come out and see them on the bed and smile because of the color choice. He changes himself into his own silk pants and holds Tony’s collar in his hand, thumb moving over the leather.
“It’s not a bad idea." Tony really is the perfect size to be carried. And he always fit so perfectly against Steve. "Could keep you close always.”
“You sure about that?”
On their return home, the king and queen call in the best doctors to soothe Steven and Sam’s minds that Bucky will be okay. Once Bucky has healed, both he and Sam are awarded titles and land. Steven smiles through the ceremonies as his two closest friends find themselves nobles. They deserve to be lauded like this and Steven is glad to see Bucky on the mend. During the celebrations, the queen notices how her son’s smiles don’t quite reach his eyes. She knows he is happy for his friends, but there is a sadness lingering over him.
“What?” Clint nudges Tony to sit up and cups his face in his hands. “Talk about burying the lead, Tones. When did this happen? What kind of kiss was it? Was it like this?” He kisses Tony’s forehead the same way Natasha likes to do. “Or like this?” He moves to kiss Tony’s temple. “Give me all the details.”
Margaret had been counting the days since the festivities had ended knowing the queen would call for her soon. She walked through the castle without being seen, her steps taking her straight to the nursery. It was no surprise to find Steven’s nursery was the room next to the one Sarah shared with Joseph. She’d waited so long for a child and would want him close. She could still remember the visit she’d received from a desperate Sarah a year prior asking why she was not able to have a child. Margaret had taken her hands and made her promise to not give up hope. She had hated being unable to give her queen a definite answer, but Margaret had known destiny had plans for Sarah and Joseph.
“Yes, sir! Please, sir.”
Tony sinks into the act of sucking Steve. It becomes a circle of endless pleasure as Steve continues to finger him, his other hand holding Tony’s head in place as he fucks up into his mouth
“Soon, baby. Soon. I’m so close. Want you to come with me.”
In the small kingdom of Brooklyn, a king and queen were celebrating the birth of their first child...
Steve smiles. “Good.” He leans in as if to kiss Tony on the cheek and when he realizes what he’s doing, he stops and adjusts to open the door for Tony. “Sleep well.”
Tony continues pacing, not noticing Natasha sitting in the window. His thoughts are quickly becoming consumed with the idea that he’s lost Steve’s friendship forever. “Steve won’t kick me out. He’s promised. He just might not,” Tony pauses, wrapping his arms around his middle. “He might not want to talk to me anymore.”
Rhodey laughs. “I’m happy for you. Though, couldn’t you have waited one more week? I had money on you two.”
“Newton, sir.”
He gives a short bow to Steve and smiles. “Your highness, Lord Stark has asked if you would please return to your rooms?”
Rating went up since Steve's thoughts get a bit adult
“Careful, sweetheart." Steve notices the way Tony's cheeks stain pink at the endearment and he loves it. "Can’t have you fallin’ on me.”
Coulson shoos him off with the promise of keeping everyone in line. Steve laughs. Keeping people in line is definitely not an issue for Coulson. It’s one of the reasons Steve promoted him to head of the guard. He’s fair, but tough and always makes sure the guard is up to whatever task is set in front of them. Steve's only hesitance is that he knows his mother will ask the same questions as everyone else, but she'll also know with one look if Steve is holding anything back. She'll have no problem digging deeper and having him tell her exactly what he is feeling.
“Handsome as ever, sir.” Taking a step back, Jarvis studies his charge. There is something about the outfit that is not sitting right with him. “Wait. Come here.”
Tony laughs and it’s a bright and happy sound. “Alright, alright, I will make sure I am at dinner. I’ll even meet you at the stairs and let you escort me in.”
“Yes! What do you need?”
Having Tony in his lap like this is everything Steve wants. He loves how close they are. How relaxed and content they both feel. He knows, after this, he’s going to take every opportunity he can to just hold Tony like this.
“Clint or Bucky might come and swipe it?”
The word yes almost came out of his mouth, and the moral compass finally squeezed out, "Someday. We will get there. We still have a lot of time." The bedroom remained unlit, and by the light from the window he could see Toni's flash of disappointment, not really sure if it was the so-called plot or the girl's real emotions.
Natasha reached around his neck, "I love you, I love only you, I won't leave you, but you can be gentle, I think I'm going to get poked through."
Steve looked up into her eyes and listened with pleasure to her giggle as he reached down and parted her legs for another round. Her pussy was indeed a little red and swollen from the intense rubbing, but fortunately it was still moist enough to keep Natasha from being hurt as he pounded into her.
Natasha cut him off, "I love him, of course I love him, I'll accept whatever he wants to do to me, besides it was just a little fling, go and forget about today." Still turning to the girl's departing back, the man added, "Come with me, I will cherish you and we can escape to where Hydra cannot find us!"
Stuttgart.
After that crazy night, Agent Toni Potts, who saved Captain Hydra's life, moved into Steve's room. Everyone said that the junior agent had been lucky enough to get the captain's attention after suffering only a minor injury. The Red Skull is more than happy to see Steve's newfound love, as the man has just been brainwashed and has had a new love, which might actually make the Avengers abandon their plans to rescue him.
Phanie froze, "I am indeed new ......" Those brown eyes seemed to have a magic that made her forget to question his words for a moment. The man took advantage of her daze, a dodge around the blade to seize her sword, and put the sword back into its scabbard before handing it to her, "I recently went on a trip with the Prince, no wonder you new here do not know me. I see that Jar ...... my father does like you, and this one was given to him by me ...... my Prince last year."
The 22-year-old Toni had been forced by Pepper to go to a charity dinner; Pepper had only meant for her to come out for a break, better open up and find someone she could rely on, or at least learn to start treating herself a little better. Toni, who hadn't fully recovered from her low point, left the event after a couple of drinks at the bar. Steve, 27, on the other hand, has had a great response to his first film as a leading role, which has given him many new job opportunities and some freedom to choose his scripts. He met a director before rushing off to this rare opportunity to meet a lot of famous actors and actresses.
Epilogue 3:
The moment Natasha Stark stepped on the plane to Afghanistan, she felt a warm patch of skin on her chest, and Rhodey told her that it was a sign that her soul mate's name would appeared.
He used to cherish her and rarely let her suck him off during the girl's fancy sex games. The only time he was ever deep-throated was when Iron Woman came back from a battlefield rampage and bruised herself, and Steve medicated and bandaged her and took her to the shower but wouldn't even talk to her. The girl crouched under the shower and took him deep, the man's resistance crushed her and she sat down on the bathroom floor and sobbed, "You won't talk to me this time, will you refuse to take me next time? I don't know how to keep you, maybe I'm not bad in bed with only these unimpressive skills, but you probably don't like them either."
It was as if Steve could feel every part on his long, thick dick branding his mark in the girl's body, and he would never be separated from her again. Natasha's long hair was loose and she hadn't even taken the time to tuck it behind her ears, and she was flushed with lust all over her body, giving him the illusion that she was really a siren come to seduce him. The self-control he had always prided himself was totally lost, almost driving him to pin the girl beneath him so that her legs wrapped around his waist and she would watch how he broke her with his cock so that she would be forever teary-eyed and moaning seductively because of him.
After kissing the girl all over again from the top of her hair to her back, leaving numerous red marks, Steve, as if remembering something, filled the already half-closed pussy with a thrust to stop the attempted flow he had left behind, before falling into a deep sleep with the girl in his arms, contentedly.
"No, don't be so hard on yourself, you were just brainwashed back then Steve, it wasn't you. And..." She nudged him twice on the lips, "I see that even brainwashed you weren't keen on destroying the world at all, the dark side of Captain America was just trying to lock up Iron Woman for himself to fuck from morning to night, that would have been the easiest way to save the world."
The man buried his face in the girl's chest, his voice muffled, "So which day did we get married? I can't even remember our anniversary right now." He felt the girl's hand, which was rubbing his short hair, stop for a moment, "Actually, we haven't gone and gotten married yet."
The name could be considered a killer for Steve, the first time the girl had called him that, it had ended with the two of them almost starting to mess around in the elevator and ending with a unanimous request from their teammates to climb the stairs for three days. It was only when he heard her being so provokative that Steve could really see the girl was ready.
"Your body is honest enough to suck really tight," he was in a good mood at the moment, not bothering that Natasha never opened her eyes to look at him, just giving her another peck on her already swollen lips, "you're so beautiful now baby, it's about time you open your eyes and take a good look at how  I am gonna fuck you." With that, he stripped himself naked and took Natasha's back and sat her up, patting her face to show her how hard he was.
He saves his hair for later, hoping that if he bats his eyelashes, Bruce will give it a good scrub. When he’s sure he’s gotten as clean as he can, he pulls the plug and watches the dirty water drain from the tub. The drains and pipes had been one of his first big projects, and one of his first successes, and every time they get used he feels a little thrill. He created something for his home to make things better and it had worked and Tony was proud.
“Very.” Bucky stands and drapes his arm over Steve’s shoulders. “How long have you felt it? And more importantly, why are you denying it? Tony isn’t Rumlow. Pretty sure they’re complete opposites. I mean, Tony does talk a lot, but not about himself. But about his projects and science and things he finds interesting. Which includes you by the way.”
When Tony still doesn’t answer, Steve stands and walks toward the easel. He finds Tony sitting with a book in his lap next to the shelf containing his paints and brushes and feels the blood drain from his face.
“Nat?" Tony lifts his head and hopes he's not crying. He swipes at his cheeks anyway, just in case. "When did you get here?”
Once the noise dies down a little, he looks out into the crowd and raises the shield above his head. “Thank you, everyone, for being here. The night is still young, so let the celebrations continue!”
Bucky pushes his way inside and picks up the glass of whiskey from the table where Steve left it. He takes a big swallow and turns his attention back to Steve. “You’re kidding right?”
“I’m looking forward to it. It’s been a while since I got to escort someone in.”
Sleeping Beauty wakes up, but all is not as it seems
Pushing his hair back from his face, Tony smiles and lets his fingers drift through the water, enjoying the little whirlpools the motion creates. “I know Steve hasn’t had to really fight in a long time, but the king of Wakanda gifted us this incredible metal and Steve said I could use some of it. Once I started working with it, I couldn’t stop picturing a shield on Steve’s arm. I had to make it. Just that little extra bit of protection should he ever need it. He protects us all, so I wanted to do my own protecting." Tony blushes. ”Okay, that doesn't really make sense, but you both know what I mean."
“I was.” Tony brushes his lips over Steve’s. “The project I’ve been working on. It was going to be my way of proposing.”
Steve’s smile brightens and Tony feels a familiar fluttering in his stomach. This smile is one of his favorites. Whenever Tony sees it, it’s as though Steve’s whole being seems to brighten and be lighter. The first time Steve smiled that way at Tony, he’d almost walked into a door.
Steve pops a cube of cheese into his own mouth and chews, watching Tony. It still amazes him how still Tony will become when he’s under. “I think something sweet now.” He takes a blueberry from the bowl and holds it to Tony’s lips. “Careful with this. It’s small and I don’t want you to choke.”
“I’m never going to forget that.” The quiet settles around them and Steve yawns. “How long until people come searching?”
“I know we need to get him used to sleeping in his crib, but yes, I want him in here with us, tonight.” Peter is a solid weight on his chest and something about holding him and having him so close settles something in Steve. “I like having him with us.”
Everything else is waiting in the living room and Steve takes a moment to take a deep breath in and let it out. “It’s going to be a good night. We’re ready for this.”
Steve takes Tony’s hand and brings it to his lips. “Mine too.”
“Every time I find out more about you Steve, I find myself more in-” He clamps his lips shut and swallows hard before continuing, “impressed, yes, more impressed. You went through so much and you took the place that was the cause of so much and turned it into something better. You turned it into a place that is just like you. Light and open and calm.” The words fade out when Tony spies an easel in the corner behind Steve and looks from it to him and back again. “Steve? Are you an artist?”
Face pressed into Bucky’s shoulder, Steve is still. He knows Bucky is right. Tony is not pushy about those sorts of things and he’s always been very open and honest when it comes to anything to do with sex or romance. Steve also knows that he is as much a novice as he is and won’t judge him for his own inexperience.
“Tones, this is unprecedented!” Clint pulls him into a fierce hug. “You definitely have to go and wait for him in his room! Play chess. Talk. Kiss. It doesn’t matter. Just get your time with Steve. You both deserve something like what Bucky, Nat, and I share.”
Together, they pack up the board, fingers brushing every so often as pieces get passed over. When they’re finished, Tony runs his hand over the board and looks up at Steve. He pulls his lower lip between his teeth and takes a step around the table. This close to Steve, he feels his heart begin to race, but he is determined to be brave.
“Where’d you go just now?”
Tony waits for Steve to get a hand in his hair, but first, he hears the pop of a cap and knows Steve’s fetched the lube. He’s eager and anxious to begin. He loves the combination of Steve’s fingers in his ass while his cock is in Tony’s mouth, but he’s curious what it’ll be like while he’s blindfolded.
They share a look and Steve begins setting the board up as Tony asks, “one more?”
Steve’s hand slides down Tony’s body to wrap around his cock, hard in his pants. “I know you do. Hard already for me. Just from my words.” He stands and pulls Tony with him. “I’m going to check in a lot, baby. I know this is new for us both and I want this to be good for us both.”
Steve was silent for a couple of seconds before he smiled again, "Is the Ferris wheel anything special?"
"Coffee ...... You said you invited me over for coffee." The short sentence shattered into several pieces between the two inseparable lips.
As they chatted until the shop was ready to close, Steve took out his wallet out of habit, only to receive a big blank stare from Toni, "Let me make sure you really know who I am, right?"
The girl was so exhausted from the crazy night that Steve had planned not to bathe her, to make sure she remembered the lesson. The scene that Natasha was covered in his fluids took his breath away and he pinned her against the bathroom wall without thinking. Natasha's legs seemed too weak to stand, so he lifted one of them over his shoulder so that she could only cling to him, and then slowly entered her.
Only then did Phanie take the sword and smile genuinely, "I'd like to."
After getting the result he wanted, Steve stopped forcing Natasha to stay in her room during the day, and the girl would go to the studio in the morning after she'd had enough sleep to continue her destructive work. Steve's constant stubbornness to occupy her disappeared and was replaced by his occasional giggle as he stared into the girl's soulful eyes, in which Natasha felt more and more like her innocent fiancé.
Iron Woman turned her head and looked into those blue eyes she had been thinking about for days, "Captain."
He sat up and gently propped the girl's cheek to try and get her to lift her head, "Hey Nat, I know you miss me, but you don't need to prove it by doing this to yourself so much."
When the crowd left, Steve helped Toni back to the top floor of the building. "Does your head hurt?"
By the time Steve got out of the shower and thought about how to ask Natasha to be his girlfriend, Natasha was already waiting for him.
Natasha's days of anxiety end with the visit of her period in a few days, and she is relieved to start playing the role of the favoured little agent, surreptitiously sabotaging Hydra's technical areas by day and delivering a blood sample every few days at Bruce's request by night. She also learns that the Red Skull rarely actually sends Steve into battle and that he still shows some resistance to killing, so the Red Skull is more interested in getting some secrets from deep within Captain America's consciousness that can also be used as his greatest leverage to fight the Avengers. This gives Natasha and Bruce a lot of confidence that the Captain's original will has not been broken, but is hiding somewhere waiting for them to come and bring him home. Everything is going well, except perhaps for Steve's never-ending nightly antics which are a little too much for her.
At Natasha's repeated pleas, Bruce, despite her disapproval, did as she said and hid the memories of the period of brainwashing in Steve's brain, which allowed Steve to sleep for a few more days, and by the time he woke up, Natasha was well and alive again.
She quickly put on another smirk, "Then the director announces that we're done for the day and this bed scene is unseen for the audience!" And then, without a word, she burrowed into Steve's arms and stopped moving as if she were really asleep. Steve, who had wanted to get up and find a place to spend the night, was stuck in bed, and kissed the girl's forehead sweetly, "Toni, good night."
He seemed to have noticed her unsuccessful dealings with the drivers, "Are you going to stand here all night?"
After a few moments the pain quickly receded and his mind failed to catch the flash of memory that had just occurred, he came to his senses and was met with the girl's undisguised concern.
She stopped several taxis in quick succession, but no one believed her. One of the drivers did think she resembled the SI CEO, who had been in the media, but decided that the famous Natasha Stark could never be in such a situation where she could not afford a ride, and finally decided she was a fraud. So she taunted the drivers with those harsh words before they took off. At the end of the day, she returned to a slightly sheltered spot in front of the station and thought about what she should do.
Steve wakes the next morning, sure everything that had happened the night before had been a wonderful dream. It’s only when he notices one lone chess piece, the black king, still sitting on the table, that he knows it was real. He lays back amongst the pillows and smiles. He feels like it should scare him more. For so long, he'd promised himself he'd keep his heart locked away. He'd thought that if he did that, he'd never have to feel the way he had when realized the depth of Rumlow's betrayal. But then he'd met Tony and as he'd come to know him better and form such a close bond, Steve had felt his heart tearing down the walls Steve had built. Even if there had been no pull to Tony, Steve knew they would still end up here.
“I want that.” Tony still isn’t sure how he and Natasha came to be so close. By all intents and purposes, they should not fit. Natasha is quiet and always watching whereas Tony tends to be louder and more frenetic. Yet, somehow they found one another and just worked. Tony could bring Natasha out of her shell and Natasha allowed Tony to enjoy the silence and quiet when he needed it but didn't know how to get it. “I want that with Steve.”
“Thank you for telling me, Steve. I know it wasn’t easy.” Sitting back a little, he rests his hands on Steve’s chest and thinks about what he wants to say next, as well as how he wants to say it. “And I need you to know, if all you ever wanted was cuddling like this and kisses on the cheek or forehead, I’d be happy. I get to be with you, and that is all I want. I love you because you're you. Not just for kisses and potential bedding.”
Tony passes Peter over to Steve who arranges him over his shoulder and begins patting his back. The first time he’d had to burp Peter, he’d been terrified he’d hurt their baby. It had been Tony who reassured him and stayed close, both laughing at the burp that came from the tiny person in Steve’s arms.
“I’ll be there. I promise,” he says again.
As they leave the castle grounds, Steve notices Tony looking around, trying to figure out where Steve is leading him. Usually, when they leave the castle, they take the main road into town. Tony doesn’t go out often, preferring to give a list of what he needs to whoever is venturing out so he can stay and continue working on whatever project he's got in the forge. His errands are usually just that, errands. When he does venture out for supplies, it's because he has a very specific thing in mind and wants to be sure he gets exactly what he needs. Occasionally Clint convinces him to join him on one adventure or another. And when they come back, it's with a story and a souvenir.
“Get it together, Stark. Focus on Steve. Focus on the plan.”
Pressing a kiss to Steven’s forehead, Sarah holds him close and notices the light finally beginning to dim from around Margaret. Moving quickly, she lays Steven back in his crib and helps Margaret into a chair before she collapses.
“Of course.”
When Steven’s 21st birthday was mere weeks away, both Joseph and Sarah began making preparations. They hoped that if they kept their son close by and surrounded by guards, maybe, just maybe the Darkness would not find him.
A hand sinks into his hair and he moans, pressing into the touch. “Steve. Sir.”
Jarvis lets Tony know when it’s time and when he gets upstairs, Steve is waiting for him dressed in jeans and a t-shirt that is still tight, but looser than what he usually wears.
“You’ve been so good tonight. You’re going to get on the couch. On your knees and you’re going to suck me while I get you nice and open for me. And then…” Steve lets his words trail off.
“Clint especially so,” Tony interjects.
Note safely in Rhodey's hands, Tony races off to the baths. He stops at the door, hands on his knees as he catches his breath. When he's able, he goes inside and looks around in shock. It is only on the rarest of occasions that the baths are this empty. He can't help but be a little pleased that he has the baths to himself. He can take as much time as he wants and not worry about hogging the soap. He washes his hair twice and really scrubs at the dirt and grime covering his body. Once again, there’s not much he can do about the still lingering dirt under his nails, but he remembers how Steve said he didn’t mind and smiles.
Steve has his face tipped up to the sun and is enjoying the warmth on his cheeks when he hears the tell-tale sound of Tony's steps. It's clear he's in a rush, even though he hasn't used all of his fifteen minutes. Tony comes close to barreling straight into him, but Steve is prepared. Pleased he’d had the forethought to set the picnic basket down, Steve reaches out and manages to grab Tony’s arm and pull him close.
Yes, we'll have plenty of time, maybe a lifetime, "I want the best for you."
Grant bought Natasha a ticket back to New York and watched her disappear. He turned back to the station entrance and waited for the agent Fury had sent to pick him up. There was a moment when he wanted to go back to the station and catch up with Natasha before the agent came, but what could he say if he did? That was all there was to say.
The man beside him finally couldn't listen any longer and opened his face mask to reveal the moustached president's face that had charmed countless people, "The truth is, I am Iron Man."
Just when she wanted to ask herself if this was what a crush felt like, the little maid who lived with her came to her in a hurry and said that old Butler Jarvis told her to hurry up and that the Prince wanted to see her.
"I'll go. I'll go undercover, get a sample of Steve's blood and send it out on a drone, then wait for Bruce to decipher the method, and once the decryption is confirmed to work, I'll kill Red Skull and bring Steve home."
The pain was so great that Natasha's mind went blank for a moment, she couldn't understand why Steve was doing this to her, the pain deep inside her from the sudden ramming without any follow-up, the pain in her wrists from the grinding, the lack of response and the girl's violent wriggling to get free was only met with a "don't move" warning.
His father also sounded curious, "General, tell me what is your crime of deceiving the king?"
It was only after an unknown amount of time that Bruce's voice came over the headphones confirming that everything had gone well that Natasha finally dropped back into his arms, relaxing the nerves she had been holding on to and soon falling into a dreamless sleep.
Even though Steve had already gently opened it for her, she winced twice when she tried to take it all in at this angle. The man tried to sit up and soothe the pain, but the girl just grabbed his hand and put it on her chest, squeezed it to show him to take care of the breasts, and stopped him from taking his hand off to hold it on her waist and back, and in this position, she galloped on him.
On the last day Steve took Toni to bungee jumping, Steve held on to Toni's hand as they leapt off the edge of a cliff.
In the evening, Steve then called the agent into the conference room to hear the new arrangements. The large conference room was just Natasha and the agent sitting face to face, Steve stood behind Natasha and spoke quietly, "Agent 15, tell us what recent technological advances S.H.I.E.L.D. has made?" But his hands were poking through the girl's collar and cupping her breasts, pushing up a bulge or two in her dress.
I have to say that since sitting down at the shop, Steve hasn't had to think about how to pick up Toni's lines, and apart from the slight effort to conceal his identity, everything with Toni is so natural and easy, and he can't help but be impressed by the way Toni talks to him about the inspiration for the new armour design, even though he doesn't understand it.
There was so much to catch up on from the past 70 years.
"The risk is still too great, and the Red Skull has left a message in the video that he has linked his life to the switch of the self-destruct program, and if the program does not detect his vitals every twelve hours, the self-destruct program will be activated instantly." The female agent grabbed Thor's hand to try and calm him down.
Tony rarely interfered with the chores of the house, leaving most of them to his trusted old butler and Pepper, who had grown up with him, and now Phanie. Phanie is able to do many things that Pepper cannot do, such as practising with Tony on his sword. Pepper was not a good fighter, and the soldiers in the house were afraid to use their best because of Tony's identity, but Phanie never let him down even if he was the Prince. When Tony invented many strange gadgets, it was only Phanie who tested them with him.
Tony turned off the screens with a wave of his hand and cupped his cheek, "How come you've learned to be such a kid as Morgan?" Instinct told him Steve had run into some trouble, "What's wrong?"
"What about you? Will you still look this good when you're old?"
Steve just smiled triumphantly, "It's because my Toni is so tempting that I don't want to leave your little hole for a second." Saying that without giving her another chance to say it back, he leaned down, his chest pressed against the girl's back, his hands gripping hers so she was holding on to the bed rail, "You're much better than a sex toy." The man got up again and lifted her up to prevent her from pressing against her stomach, and asked, as if in doubt, "How deep are you, baby? Why do I always feel like I can't get to the bottom?"
The man remained at the door before he dared to leave without permission, blushing as he listened to the whole thing, Natasha's shoulders deliberately exposed by the man covered in red marks and teeth marks, and some wet white marks on her face and hair. Satisfied and relieved, Steve leaves with a light "you'll be transferred to Europe from tomorrow" and carries the girl away.
The girl in the armour felt familiar and unfamiliar to Steve, a face he never seemed to have seen before, but those soulful eyes and the softness of her voice when she called his name, which was a little different from her usual voice, he was sure he couldn't find from anyone else but Toni. "Toni ......?" Steve was a little confused for a moment, was this really Toni? Had she been lying to him from the beginning to the end? Shock and anger and heartbreak came together and Natasha waited for the moment when he froze, she leapt up from the ground, kicked away Steve's unsteady shield and sticked the hidden tranquillizer needle into his neck.
"Oh dear, that's what you care about. Well, then, when we're both on holiday, I'll paint a new one to hang next to this one, with the two of us right next to each other."
The man kissed her eyes, "Why are you crying, tell me what it is you're hiding from me?" When she wouldn't talk, Steve had to change his tactics, he stopped taking care of the deepest part of her body every time and just rubbed shallowly at the entrance.
Steve could only sigh when he saw how drunk she was, "Do you still recognise who I am?"
A few loud slaps landed on the softness of her breasts, "Want to know how I found out? It's funny, I had prepared a surprise to hide this ring for you to find, but I didn't expect you to give me such a big surprise first." With that, he retrieved a ring from the pocket of his shirt and slipped it onto her hand without a word.
"I went to your workroom and spent the afternoon painting."
It was just getting dark when Steve came to visit Natasha, and it was already a little late in the evening when he took her back to bed. Natasha looked at his sleeping look, slightly dazed by the fact that Steve was not wearing his daytime Hydra uniform - nothing at all, to be precise - and his eyes were closed, no different from when he had slept next to her. It was as if he would wake up next time as her soft-eyed Captain America.
"Yeah, I'm just too tired today to do something we both love."
Bruce's forehead was faintly green, "How could you do this? Iron man was hurt on the battlefield yesterday!"
"Let me hold you for a while Tony, just don't push me away." Steve's voice was buried muffled behind him, and he lifted his head up, chin resting on his shoulder, his eyes catching a sharp glimpse of what was just like a document on his screen called Time Travel Theory. He suddenly understood what Wong meant by "when the time comes", and his heart, ready to spend a lifetime with the person in his arms, was snapped cold by the coming winter.
When Tony gets out of the shower, he dries himself quickly and walks into the bedroom. He swallows hard when he sees what Steve has left out for him.
Outside the door to his rooms, he stops and catches his breath. When he’d been running, it was easy to ignore any doubts or nerves, but now that he’s standing here, they all come rushing to the forefront of his mind. No. He can't let himself think like that. Tonight is going to be a good night. Whatever Tony has planned will be special and good and uniquely Tony, and Steve is ready for it.
Tony has to laugh at that. “You should have seen him in the baths when I told him.”
“How about this then? You can go and take a quick bath. While you do that, I will go and change. We will meet right here in say, fifteen minutes?”
“Little bit of both. It’s just,” he tries to find the right words and can’t. “It’s scary. I’m putting myself out there. What if Tony doesn’t feel the same?”
It is perfect. Steve gets his arm around Tony and is amazed by just how right this all feels. Tony fits in his arms like he’s made for him. Steve laughs and Tony looks up, confused. He tells him the trail his thoughts went down and Tony laughs too.
It’s on the tip of Steve’s tongue to sass Tony back, but the more he thinks on it, the more he realizes he really wouldn’t mind carrying Tony around. He kisses Tony’s temple and hugs him close. Tony's arms go around him and Steve would swear he feels him press a kiss to his chest.
“Careful. I can get you over my lap for a spanking real quick.” Steve takes a seat next to Tony and pinches a nipple between his finger. “Who’s in charge, sweetheart?”
They continue walking toward the castle, chatting a little, but mostly enjoying each other’s company. They separate when they reach the entrance to the baths. When Tony starts to pull away, Steve stops him and quickly presses a kiss to the top of his head.
“Not at first, no.” Gentle fingers card through Steve’s hair and she continues. “Ours was an arranged marriage. Advantageous for both our kingdoms. Your father was one of many suitors. Margaret and I had some say in who my parents chose, but they made the final choice. I am glad they chose him. He was a good man and asked for the chance to court me properly before we actually married. He wanted to show me himself without other suitors interfering. Our love still took some time to bloom, both of us unsure how we felt about having our lives arranged for us. As we courted, I watched him become the king he was meant to be and he stayed by my side as I learned what it meant to be queen.”
The next week starts with both Steve and Tony making their attempts at courting. Steve finds a note from Tony tucked into amongst the papers for his next meeting. The note is mostly silly. A one-sided conversation about how Tony’s day has been going and how he hopes Steve’s meetings aren’t too dull. It makes Steve laugh and he tucks it in his pocket for safekeeping. He’s also sure Tony will want to at least get another look at the sketch on the back since it’s clearly one of his inventions. What really interests him is how Tony managed to slip it in amongst the papers. On his way down to dinner, he stops in the kitchens and, with a little cajoling, convinces the cook to make some blueberry tarts and have them sent to Tony.
Since Steve is here, and he’s done what he can for the day, Tony decides he might as well get a head start on getting ready. He moves toward Steve and takes his arm. Steve is a little stiff at first, but once he realizes what Tony is doing, he relaxes and follows his lead.
Tony ducks under the water to rinse out the soap and one look at Bruce’s face and he knows it’s going to take another round of soap. Bruce’s fingers slide back into his hair, really working the soap into his scalp and Tony’s eyes close.
He doesn’t need to be told twice. He rushes out of the room and jogs to his own. Most just get out of the way, but the one or two who try and have a word get quick rushed apologies and promises to talk later as Steve runs by. He can’t stop now, He has to keep going. Has to get to Tony.
“Yes, Clint especially so. James was the more patient. He was very serious about courting. Flowers, a pretty dress, a few knives. I was not used to that. It is not how I was raised. We worked things out, though. With time, and now,” She brings her hand to her chest in a motion similar to Tony’s. “Now, my two best friends are my two great loves and I did not know I could be this happy. We are not perfect, but who is? We try our hardest every day.”
The bathing rooms are warm and humid as always and Tony's hair sticks to his forehead and he ventures deeper inside. He strips down and tosses his clothes in a nearby basket to be cleaned later. He knows they will never be truly clean, but they’re comfortable and worn in the best ways. After one unfortunate instance where one of Tony’s favorite shirts had been consigned to the rag bag, it had become a rule that Tony’s clothes were washed as best as they could be. It was only when his clothes were totally unsalvageable that they were disposed of. Tony had felt silly crying over a shirt, but it had been one of his most comfortable, and every patch Ana had sewn in had meant something to him.
“Eager.” Steve dips a slice of apple in some honey. “I like it. The next one is a little messy.”
Steve gathers a few toys he knows Tony loves, curious if Tony will want to try them, as well as his collar. Steve loves the collar just as much as Tony does. Made from a soft mahogany leather, burnished to a bright shine with a metal shield as the only sign of who Tony belongs to.
Tony can imagine it. They’d be in Steve’s studio that day. Tony there for Steve to pose as he wants and needs. “I’d…I’d like that.”
“In a romantic way.”
“Tony?”
“Alright, alright.” Tony kisses him as he gets off the bed and goes into the bathroom for a damp rag. When he comes back, he wipes the spit-up off Steve’s back and tosses the washcloth toward the hamper. “The bassinet is still in here, do you want to put him down in there?”
A glimpse into the harem and Tony's role in it.
When Steve does appear, a small gasp escapes Tony's lips and his heart starts to race. Steve’s clothes are not all that different from his usual dress, but the way his breeches are fitted to his legs, his boots enhance them even further and Tony swallows hard. His eyes travel upward and he holds back a groan when he sees Steve's jacket. He swears Steve’s shoulders look even broader and the sapphire color make his eyes shine a deeper blue.
“You’re lucky I love you, Spangles.” Tony turns his head so he can catch Steve’s lips with his own. Steve kisses him back, taking his time to taste and tease his husband. Steve moves his hips in a way that he knows drives Tony wild, and Tony’s eyes roll back. “Touch me, Steve. Please. It’s been so long.”
He studies the cufflinks in the bowl, taking a little time to try and compose himself. He knows he still won’t be able to fool Natasha, he's never been able to, but he still needs the moment. When he turns around, Natasha hasn't moved and she motions for him to lift his chin. Her fingers are nimble as she unties his cravat and Tony can't help but smile.
When they’d first married, the king and queen had thought it would be a simple matter to have children. They were in love and eager to start their family. Not only would a child ensure the kingdom and their people were taken care of, but they both wanted to have a little one to love and teach about the world. Sadly, years passed and they were still without a child. The few times Sarah thought she’d conceived had ended with bloody bedsheets and Joseph holding her as she cried.
There’s no doubting the truth to those words and Tony feels tears fill his eyes. He wants to throw his arms around Steve and not let go, but he still hesitates. Steve is so bright and clean and he is covered with two days of soot and grease and metal. He can still remember the scoldings he received from his parents for bringing filth into the house. The scoldings were also often followed by lectures about how Starks are meant to present themselves and behave. Tony had hated them and tried not to let their words sink in, but it’s clear they did.
Unable to say no to such an offer, Tony tucks himself against Clint’s side and rests his head on his shoulder. “Thanks, Clint.”
Tony climbs out of the bath and, after Clint joins him, they help each other dress. Clint is in his usual purple and he whistles when he sees the deep red of the shirt Tony has chosen. Steve has always liked Tony in red and Tony was happy to fill his wardrobe with every shade of the color.
It doesn’t take Tony long to provide Steve with plenty of flowers to finish the crown. Steve picks out the ones he thinks will look best, glancing up every so often to look at Tony. As he winds the last stem, he smiles, Tony is leaning back on his hands looking out into the field with a soft smile of his own. He's absolutely stunning like this. So relaxed and happy. When Steve drops the crown on his head, his hands go up to touch and his smile gets brighter.
“Fuck!”
“Did Steve send you?”
“Clint?”
Walking Tony to the couch and the pillow he’s set on the floor, Steve lifts his hand to his lips. “I know you will be. Kneel, Tony.”
“It was the moment I saw him.”
“You added the please, didn’t you, Jarvis?” Steve asks as he stands.
Steve laughs low and quiet. “I like when you ramble.”
“Yes!” Sitting forward, he rests his elbows on his thighs and groans. “After Rumlow, I swore to myself I wouldn’t risk my heart.”
Pulling up, Tony takes a breath. “A little. Wanted it to be easy for you”
Obie had also been stunned and quickly fell over himself trying to greet the prince and offer his hospitality. Steve had smiled and graciously accepted the offer. After that, the only words he’d spoken to Obie were to ask for some refreshments. As soon as Obie had gone to fetch someone, Steve had whisked Tony away to talk. Tony can still remember the look on Obie’s face when he realized Steve was leading him from the room. When the door closed behind them and they were away from Obie’s prying eyes, Tony hoped he would be asked to join the harem.
Steve passes Peter over, bottle and all, and digs into the stash of burping cloths they keep near the bed. “I wonder who he gets that from?”
Escaping Bucky’s gaze is impossible and Steve adds even more whiskey to his glass before speaking. “IfeelapullwithTony.”
“Gonna let me see my prize?” Steve’s eyes sparkle when he asks and bends down so he’s eye to eye with Tony. “Or are there more conditions?”
“Silly, silly papa.” He sings. “We love him, though, don’t we?” Peter blinks up at his dads, eyes locking on Steve. Tony looks over at Steve and snuggles closer. “Yeah, we love him so much, you and I. He’s just the best, isn’t he?”
Tony tilts his head and pouts because he thinks it’s pretty obvious. “Trick question?”
It only takes a few thrusts before Steve is spilling into Tony and Tony is coming over his fist.
With trembling hands, Steve manages to get the ring on Tony’s finger. The rubies suit him well and he can’t help but rub his thumb over them. When he lifts his head, he finds Tony smiling and Steve smiles back.
Tony moves with Steve, trusting that Steve won’t just let go or mess with him. He feels the tip of Steve’s cock against his lips and his mouth opens to let him in. The hand in his hair disappears and Tony whines around the head.
When the bottle is finally ready, he tests the temperature on his wrist and carries it to the nursery. Peeking over the edge of the crib, he can see Peter’s face is screwed up and red as he gets ready to let out another wail.
“Soon. First, that gorgeous mouth.”
Tony moves to meet Steve’s thrusts and pulls him down so he can kiss him again. “Come, Steve. Come for me. I want to feel it.”
“I can imagine.” She moves behind him and slides his jacket down his arms. “Now give me your arm and start talking, kotenok.”
“Hmm?”
“It’s me, Tony.” He takes in the dinner set for two and the chess set on a table near the fireplace. “What is all of this?”
“That’s it, sweetheart. You always open for me so well. Played with yourself in the shower a little didn’t you?”
Setting the razor down, Tony wipes his face and looks in the mirror. “He has feelings for you.” He tells his reflection. “He left you the daisies. He sent the tarts you found. He's sent just as many notes as you have. You are getting a happy ending.”
The brightness of the light caused Steven to begin to cry and Sarah did her best to soothe him, trying her best to ignore her own fears. “Who? Who would want to hurt my child?”
Used to the way Tony skips from subject to subject, Bruce cards his fingers through dark curls and smiles. “Clean enough.”
As soon as they’d arrived back in Brooklyn, it had been Steve himself who saw to getting Tony settled. After showing Tony his room, he asked a simple question, “what do you love doing?”
The laughter that bursts from Tony’s mouth is loud and happy. He leans forward, arms around his stomach. The idea of Bruce spilling a secret is hard to even imagine. He’s almost as good as Natasha. “Never. Bucky is almost as bad as Clint about keeping secrets. I wasn’t sure if he’d be able to hold it all in. But Bruce?” Tony mimes locking his lips. “He’s like a steel trap. He reveals nothing.”
Leaning back on the couch, Steve strokes himself through his pants. “You have been awfully well behaved.”
When Tony agrees to it, Steve is ecstatic. He always loves the way Tony submits for him. It’s absolutely gorgeous the way Tony puts that trust in him and lets Steve take control.
Tony’s eyes close and he presses his face into Steve’s chest. “No.” He groans and drops his arms. “Not yet. Can I wear one of yours later?”
Steve pushes in with two fingers and Tony presses back into them. “Steve!”
He brought up the blindfold, expecting Tony to say no, but he has everything already planned on the slight chance he gets a yes.
“Funnily enough, she just asked me when I wanted the tower gone.” They reach the top and Steve steps into the room first. “I was ready to give her a date, but then the words just disappeared and, instead, I asked to keep it up. Just a month to start.”
“Gorgeous.” He pulls Tony off his cock and gasps at just how red and swollen his lips are. “You beautiful man. Sucking my cock like a fucking champ. Feel my fingers in you?” He thrusts them in hard. “Holding you open for me. Keeping you ready for my cock.”
“We’re engaged, Tony. To be married.”
Far sooner than Steve expects, he’s standing in front of his door with no memory of actually making the trek there. This wasn’t the first time Steve had walked to his rooms without paying attention, but it was the first time for something like this. His gaze drops to the hand Tony had kissed. There's no evidence of the kiss, but Steve can still feel the gentle press of Tony's lips on his skin. It's all he can think about.
As they walk, Steve does most of the talking. He informs Tony of any obstacles and tells him how proud he is of Tony. How amazed he is at Tony’s trust and obedience.
Bucky laughs. “Nice to see you too, punk.” He pushes past Steve and goes to the window. “I’ve been sent to get all the details about last night. Clint is chomping at the bit to find out. Dashed out our room as soon as he was dressed. Pretty sure he’s pounced on Tony already.”
It’s scary how perceptive Bucky can be sometimes. His ability to see through bullshit is one of his greatest talents, even if it can be annoying when he cuts straight to the truth of what Steve is saying at times.
“Tony?”
In Steve’s arms, he burrows close and breathes in that scent that is so uniquely him. Tony doesn’t even know how to begin to describe it, but he settles when he’s close enough to smell it. “I’m nervous.“
He begins explaining how he’d never really experienced the same sorts of desires as everyone else, and once he starts, the words just keep coming. Tony listens closely, only interrupting now and then to ask questions so he can understand better. When Steve tells him how it wasn’t until recently that he began wanting more, he can’t help but blush.
The words that Tony had swallowed a few minutes earlier refuse to be held back any longer. He moves without thinking to straddle Steve’s lap. He smiles when Steve's arms come around him and breathes out the words, “I love you.”
“Good boy.” Steve pulls the blindfold from his pocket. “We’re going to try a blindfold tonight. And I picked this special just for you. Can you guess why?”
Ms. Carol Danvers had been one of the first people Steve made the offer to. At the time, she’d been the second daughter to a lord who didn’t know what to do with her or her desire to be a knight. Working with Steve, she created, and led, her own contingent of fierce warrior women. Captain Danvers's Marvels quickly become well known for all the good they did for the kingdom.
“I know you do, baby.” Steve manhandles Tony onto his lap. “Sit up for me.” Tony does and Steve angles his cock for Tony to sink down on. “Sit on my cock now.”
There’s a hand on his elbow guiding him down and Tony lets himself sink onto the pillow Steve has left for him. Once he’s comfortable, he bows his head and waits.
Steve has noticed and he knows his blush says it too. The way Tony’s whole being brightens when Steve praises him is an extra bonus. He makes Tony happy and he gets to see that smile that lights up a whole room, what isn’t there to love?
“The queen is awfully strict about all of that,” Tony admits. Steve is still holding his hand and he can feel the calluses Steve has from his sword. “I believe you. Promise.”
“It is.” It amuses Natasa that Tony felt the need to clarify who. “I was nervous at first. Two men wanted me, and not only were they my two closest friends, but they also wanted each other. I did not know that could work, but they were persistent.”
“He did, indeed, sir.”
Those three words fill Steve with a joy he could not even begin to describe. He rests his forehead against Tony’s and one hand comes up to cup his cheek. “I love you too, Tony.”
“Please, Steve. Please, sir. Want to come.”
It’s quiet for a minute and Steve worries something is wrong. He reaches for the doorknob when he hears Tony’s voice. “Steve? If that’s you, come in already.”
I know this Clint is essentially the furthest thing from MCU Clint and that is on purpose. I am very much pulling from Avengers Assemble Clint as well as comics Clint. He's one of my favorite overly competent disasters.
Reluctantly, Steve lets Tony go and takes his hand. “Not possible.”
Jarvis observes his young charge as he gets him dressed. Tony is usually pretty good at masking his emotions, but today they are all right on the surface for Jarvis to see. Instead of saying something, he admires the clothing Tony has chosen. “If I may say, sir, the prince will not be able to look away.”
“Yes. Thank you for reminding me.” He narrows his eyes at Clint but keeps smiling. “That wasn’t embarrassing at all.”
Twin spots of pink appear on Steve’s cheeks. “No. Why?”
Turning his head, Steve kisses Tony’s brow. “You are this beautiful. This is how you look to me, Tony.” He flips through the pages and finds a sketch of Tony in his forge. “You are stunning.”
Tony ignores Steve in favor of looking down at Peter. “Don't listen to your papa. He’s so silly. We just don’t want to miss anything.”
“Yes, yes. On the top of the head. I remember.” Bucky points a finger at Steve. “That wasn’t what I meant. And you know it. No one has ever made you feel the romantic stuff. The butterflies in your stomach. The uncertainty that comes from wondering if they feel the same for you. The stuff I feel for Clint and Nat. How sometimes, all it takes is hearing Clint laugh or catching Tasha in an unguarded moment for me to want to kiss them. Do you feel that with Tony?”
When his parents call for him later that evening, Steven finds he’s both curious and nervous. He does not know what solution his parents could have concocted. They bring him to the table and begin laying out their plan. In the weeks they’ve been awake, they noticed a new trend amongst their fellow rulers. The searches for suitable brides and grooms have led many to form harems for themselves and their children. This way there is a large pool of candidates to choose from. The king and queen hope that even if Steven does not feel the pull of invisible strings, he will find friendship and surround himself with people who care about him.
“Tony, you know better than to believe in the paparazzi.”
Rhodey,
Steve didn’t even try to stop the blush of utter embarrassment when he realized that he had said that out loud. Tony was rubbing more and more on him if he was starting to talk out loud without his own permission. Not a good sign. “Sorry.”
“Don’t be such a sore loser, Clint,” Coulson called evenly. He seemed little interested in the team's antics, but his efforts to appear nonchalant were unnecessary in front of the Avengers family, especially when his lips kept twisting in amusement like that, "We always knew that you weren't going to win this one."
meaningful.”
Steve was about to put himself together when Tony's lips left his own and whispered in a low, sexy tone, "This does
“Hey!” This got Clint and Jan's attention alright. In a second after they exchanged a challenging look with each other, they bolted upstairs as if it was a matter of life or death, “Flying is considered cheating, you cheating cheater!”
It's been a few years! Sorry about that! I did tell you that I posted the first chapter and the beginning of the second one as a one-shot because I don't like posting things that I haven't finished and this is a HUGE project.
He made his usual signal to Jarvis to request that he turned off the astoundingly loud noise that Tony called music when he saw the genius’s back folded over his main workbench working on something Steve couldn’t see. His body language clearly telling Steve how exhausted he was.
“If that’s the case, please call me Steve.” He replied politely.
“Love you this much?”
Steve knew that this was somewhat an empty threat considering the competent port that this man carried. He wouldn’t use his men for a personal matter, Steve was almost sure of it; if not for the words exchanged, then for Tony’s obvious admiration for his ‘Rhodey’. Even knowing this, Steve couldn’t stop the small shiver that traveled down his back.
“It would be lovely if we could all go riding through the castle grounds.” He replayed finally. “Unfortunately, it seems we have a large amount of issues we must attend to, so the queen and myself won’t be able to accompany you.” At Anthony’s crestfallen expression, the Crown Prince continued to speak “But I find it improper and dangerous enough for the two of you to wander alone, so I ask of Lord Obadiah to accompany you, Anthony, have fun and be back within the hour.”
“Wow, when you put it like that it’s even worse.” Steve affirmed while trying to suppress a flinch. “But there’s nothing I can do. Tony told me to give it up.”
“Seriously, Steve, let it go. So what if my best friend doesn’t like you? I love you and that’s what it’s important, right?” he finished his statement with a chaste kiss on Steve’s lips and a good grope of his ass to show his encouragement in his own way.
“Are you telling me that Steve
“And would that truth that you’re searching for is the same truth in which he believes in?” Wanda asked carefully while watching intently, “You mustn’t deceive yourself, Captain. I do not know yet what the truth you’re after is, but I do know that it may be the one that you’re most afraid of.”
“Well, maybe I saw wrong!”
“Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes” he politely greeted the moment he was at a decent hearing distance while extending his hand for a shake. He wasn’t surprised when his unwilling host didn’t take it.
That’s when Steven noted the new horses on the guest’s stalls. They probably arrived just after the sun came down while Steven had been running towards the edge of the woods. Steven’s heart sunk a little when he realized that it would have been his turn to tend to the twelve new gest horses but was too busy waiting at the cottage for Anthony at the time. Then a pang of guilt came through when nobody approached Steven to nag him about his last night’s whereabouts, proving that James Barnes, the other stable boy and Steven’s best friend, had covered for him on his free night.
the guy for insulting him and ‘hurting his feelings’. He would rather have another pleasant chat with the Colonel.
I hope you enjoyed it! I'm sure there are still a lot of mistakes (it will never be perfect) so if you find something to improve, please do tell me so I can fix it. Thanks a lot for the support! Now that my soul is more at peace, I can finally concentrate on finishing up 'The Royal Circle'.
"I hope you had a good time in
“Do you still think this was necessary?” Tony asked mockingly.
“Really?” James asked sceptical, “Enlighten me, then. I’ve always wondered why you call each other the way you do and not something cornier. Corny fits you, man.”
Rhodes was actually surprised by the defense. It wasn’t every day that Tony Stark, eccentric billionaire, made an obvious show of affection with people being witness of it. Maybe it was because it was Rogers and Tony was such a softie that he didn't even stop trusting him. Damn.
“Thanks for that, really, but I think I’m good.”
Yeah, he’d take those thoughts to the grave. Or at least nowhere near Charles Xavier… nor his creepy magnetic villain of a boyfriend. Just in case.
"I agree, that's why I need you to lea–"
Confession! I had this chapter written a long time ago, but I really wanted to get to 650 kudos before updating... BUT! That never happened and I got tired of waiting, so! I decided that no matter who liked the story or not, I had to finish updating this small part of the whole story if only for the people that already kudoed and commented on it! To those people, this is for you, thank you for the support!
As Rhodes finally relaxed the crushing hug in order to look at Tony at arm length, the deathly glare turned into a soft stare (Steve could bet it was a rare sight on Rhodes). If Steve hadn’t understood right at that moment that Rhodes cared and felt responsible for Tony, then what he said next made it perfectly clear.
! That's the way it is and the way that is better for everyone involved! I think it’s time for you to accept it and
“Rhodes, I know he’s here” The blond contradicted while putting his hands up as if saying he didn’t intend to fight the colonel. “This is important. I just need a few minutes to talk to him.”
“But?”
The answer he received was rather fast for Anthony to process fully as he suddenly found himself against the door, pinned by a gorgeous, muscular, tall, perfect, blond body and with a tongue in his mouth, stealing all the air he worked so hard to get back to his lungs. Not that Anthony was complaining.
“I care about Tony,” he stated with all the honesty that he could muster. This was something that Steve felt was completely necessary to get across the Colonel’s thick skull in order to proceed. “I care about him more than I should considering that I’m the leader of a superhero team whose main job is to keep the world safe and I should care equally for all my people, but I don’t, and that’s something I’ve come to terms with.”
Rogers, the sneaky bastard, seemed to have waited his opportunity to enter the apartment without engaging with physical contact with Rhodes. So when Rhodey moved back to grab the door, he gave the supersoldier the opportunity to side step him so he could enter his home with the same grace as he would dodge a supervillain attack. As unflattering as that thought may be.
The strawberry has stained Tony’s lips an even deeper red and he has to force himself to look away. His gaze lands back on the picnic basket and the small box he tucked into the corner. It’s not how he planned it, but he doesn’t want to wait anymore.
One of Rhodey’s hands comes up and ruffles Tony’s hair. “As if I’ve ever been able to stay mad at you.”
“Oh, sweetheart.” Steve pulls Tony into a tight embrace. “I like you in every way. Every single way.”
“It’s just,” Steve releases Tony’s hand and his fingers brush over a spot just under his ear. “Just here.”
“Aw, Steve. Have you missed me?”
“Tony, oh God, Tony! So good.” Steve groans, staring deep into Tony’s eyes. They both want this to last, but they are also very aware that their time is limited. Peter could, and if they’re honest, probably will wake up at any moment. When he does wake up, there will be tears and he will want both his fathers.
“Jarvis, lights at 15%.” When the lights dim, Steve starts sliding the blindfold off. “Close your eyes, baby. Don’t wanna blind you.”
“We are still courting, mama. We are still in the early stages."
“It’s okay, Tony.” He takes Tony’s face in his hands and kisses the tip of his nose. “I was going to tell you about the prophecy while we ate. I had a whole speech planned out,” Steve laughs nervously. “But the seer Margaret, she told me that one day I’d find the person who was meant to stand by my side. They would be the truest of partners. The person with who I was meant to spend my life and lead the kingdom with. She said I would know them because I would feel a pull as though we were connected by invisible strings.”
In a forge tucked away from the noise and bustle of the castle, a smith brings his hammer comes down in a steady, ringing rhythm on a red hot piece of metal. The metal begins to flatten out and the smith begins turning it after each strike of his hammer, working it into a circular shape. He doesn’t know how long he's been working for, but eventually, he gets it in the size and shape he wants. Pleased with his progress, he quenches the hot metal and brings it over to the table to check its hardness.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice is barely a whisper now and he’s afraid Tony is going to be scared off by what is in the book.
Steve studies Tony, taking in every little detail. Miles of skin for him to touch and enjoy, the collar with its shield, marking Tony as completely and totally his. “Beautiful, sweetheart. You’re all mine, aren’t you.”
“Haha, you’re just so funny, sleeping beauty.” Tony sets the board up and looks at the box containing the pieces. He pulls out one white pawn and one black pawn and holds them behind his back. “How about this. I’ll mix them up behind my back and let you choose. I don’t need to pick first to beat you.”
Quickly wiping his eyes, Steve smiles at Tony, touched by his actions. “Anyway,” he stands and offers Tony his hand. “Ready to continue on to our destination?”
“Steve? What is this? It’s beautiful, but I-”
“Exactly. So I’ll take this inside with me and meet you right back here.”
It hits Tony how long it’s been since he’s been this close to Steve. Even though there have been gifts and notes sent back and forth, Tony realizes they haven’t had the chance to share even a quick sideways hug over the past few weeks. He shifts so he can wrap his arms around Steve and burrows in close. Steve smells good. Tony's never sure what the scent is, but it reminds him of sunshine and warmth and comfort.
More cheers fill the room and Steve and Tony become aware that everyone is watching them. Tony laughs and hides his face in Steve’s chest. Steve’s cheeks turn hot and he wraps his arms around Tony, making sure to keep the shield out of the way.
“Of course we’re made for each other. Did you forget our little light show earlier?”
Steve and Tony take a walk and Steve tries to keep his surprise, a surprise.
“We've got a couple hours then.” Steve pulls Tony closer. “Let’s take a nap.”
“What?” Tony’s compliments are still ringing in his ears so he doesn’t notice where he’s looking at first. He turns his head and sees Tony looking at his easel. “Oh, that. Yes. I enjoy painting.”
“Yes. Good.” Tony turns his head to kiss Steve’s shoulder. “Help me stand? Not sure my legs are steady yet.”
Tony slides to his knees and looks up at Steve. “I’m ready, sir.” He can see his collar in Steve’s hand and he wants to feel it’s the weight on his neck. Feel the way he becomes  Steve’s when he wears it.
He doesn't know how long he lays there, but he decides it's enough. He sits up and runs a hand through his hair, trying to get it in place. He looks at the empty space next to him and finds himself wishing Tony was with him. Steve imagines how it would be to lean over and kiss him awake. How simple it would be to hold him close as they spend the morning talking. His mind drifts to the other things they could do in bed, but the thought of just basking in the closeness and intimacy is more than appealing to Steve.
Feeling braver, Tony told him about his passion for smithing and creating. Steve had smiled so brightly, his eyes seemed to sparkle and he’d very enthusiastically brought him the forge and told him to make it his own. His only request was that Tony be careful and that he take some time to meet the rest of the harem before becoming too engrossed in his work. Eager to earn more of those smiles, Tony had agreed and followed Steve back to the harem quarters. Afterward, Tony was glad Steve had him meet the others. They had taken him in and showed him around, and given Tony what he’d always wanted. A family.
“I am. Or at least,” Tony bounces a little on the balls of his feet and runs his fingers through his hair, “I’m making sure Steve is aware that I am courting him. And that I'm serious about it.”
“Ye-yes. Sir. Please. Oh god. Your fingers. Please, sir. I wanna come. Wanna come on your cock.”
“I did not!” He begins checking himself over, searching for whatever dirt he could have missed.
“Anthony.”
Sarah pokes her son in the side making him flinch and giggle, just as he did when he was a baby. “Don’t you ‘good afternoon’ me, young man. You know why I called you over here. Now talk. Shall I begin planning the wedding?”
Stroking Tony faster, Steve can feel he’s near the edge. “Turn your head, baby.” Tony does and Steve kisses him hard, not caring the angle is awkward. “Gonna come, Tony. Come with me.”
“Yes.”
“Oh god, sir. So good,” Tony pants.
“Of course, sir.” There’s a twinkle in Jarvis’s eyes and he cups Tony’s face in his hands. He presses a gentle kiss to his forehead and takes one last look. “I believe you are ready.”
Steve rubs Tony’s back and kisses the top of his head. "I am too, sweetheart. We’re going to take things slow tonight. And real easy. Gonna start simple too.”
Steve enters his room and wonders where his valet is before remembering he’d told him to take the rest of the night for himself. He begins undressing, fingers moving mechanically as his thoughts circle back to what had transpired earlier.
“You are very welcome,” Jarvis swallows, tears suddenly filling his eyes. Tony has always been the child he and Ana wanted but never had. “Go, dear one. Enjoy your picnic.”
This time, both Bruce and Bucky snort. Bruce pats Steve's arm. "You are patient about many things, Steve, but not Tony."
“I know that, Buck.” Steve grimaces at the sharpness in his voice. “Sorry.” He takes a deep breath and lifts his head to look Bucky in the eye. “There was still this moment, right when I first woke up.” The memory plays in his head and Steve hates that it still has such a prominent place in his mind. “I saw him and he smiled at me and I hoped maybe he was the one.”
“Are you here?" Steve calls again. "Clint said you’d shut yourself in here for the past two days.”
Bucky moves closer, trying to read Steve’s expression. “Talk to me, Stevie.”
Tony continues talking, going on about the different shapes and styles of arrowheads he wants to try. He mostly wants to know how they’ll affect Clint’s aim and the way the arrow flies, and since they have more than enough of their usual arrows, he thinks it’s worth it.  Before he’s even aware, a gentle hand is pushing him into his chair and Steve is taking the seat next to him.
“Good boy. Go ahead and eat.”
“Tony!”
Sinking back into his chair, Steve smiles. They have a plan. This is going to work. He has to believe that. Dwelling on what could happen otherwise is not an option. At least, not right now.
Helping Tony onto the couch, Steve is thankful for how big and plush it is. He strips off his own pants and looks at Tony on his knees just waiting. “Ready for me, baby?”
Lifting Tony’s chin, Steve pecks Tony on the lips. “I know. I’m so mean. But you’re going to eat for me aren’t you, baby. Take each little morsel from my fingers.”
“I will. I will.” Tony feels elated. If it's this big a deal to Clint, it means he's not reading too deep into it. He can do what Clint is suggesting, and who knows? Maybe there is a chance for something more with Steve. “Okay, enough about me." Tony's heart is racing and talking about something else will help. "New topic. How did the new arrows work for you?”
“You kissed Tony?”
Always happy to talk arrows, Clint begins describing how each of Tony’s newest creations had worked and what kinds of adjustments he feels need to be made. Tony listens, eager to hear what Clint has to say. While some of his descriptors are a little odd, Tony has known Clint long enough to be able to translate and make notes in his head on what Clint is telling him. He also asks his own questions here and there, making further notes about what he wants to try and accomplish the next day.
Steve looks into the boxes his mother pointed out and he can see why she thought they would suit Tony. Most of the pieces look unassuming and simple. It’s only when he looks closer, that he can see some of the intricate and delicate metalwork that has gone into each of the rings, necklaces, and bracelets.
Steve tilts his head, eyes narrowing at Bucky. “What?”
“Yes, yes. I know. It is very exciting. On that day, my Prince Charming gave me the most beautiful ring,” Tony holds up his hand for everyone to see and there are more cheers. “Truly the best day of my life.”
Laughing again, Bucky lets Steve go and gives him a little shove. “We are all aware, but he still considers what you have to say. Have you really not noticed the way he lights up when you praise his newest projects?”
Tony waits for Steve to stand and then slides the shield onto his arm. He tightens the leather straps and takes a step back to get the full picture. Steve looks fierce and proud. He holds the shield held near his chest and looks out into the room at their friends and family. The colors are those of the kingdom and the white star in the center is like the ones that adorn their flags.
“Good.” Tony gives a happy little shimmy and turns so he can lean back against the edge of the pool.
Tony rolls his eyes. “For all that snark I should give you whatever is in my other hand.”
Sarah takes his face in her hands and brings his head down for her to kiss. “I know, dearest. But as your mother, you will always be my little one. Your father would be so proud of the man you’ve become.”
“Hush, young sir. You and the prince are courting. Enticing him is part of that. I remember when Ana just so happened to ‘lose’ a stocking because of a small tear.” Tony’s cheeks are bright red and Jarvis just chuckles. “Do not fret, young sir. She only flashed a bit of ankle at me. It was not until later that-”
A beautiful prince is awakened from his cursed sleep by a bright, shining knight, named Rumlow.
“Good boy.” Steve’s hand slides from Tony’s shoulder to his hand. “We’re going to the couch. You’re going to kneel for me and I’ve got some tasty treats for you.”
“Tony?” Steve stares up at him, confused. What kind of announcement could Tony need to make?
“Good, baby.” Steve gets a hand on Tony’s cock and strokes him loosely in time with his thrusts. “Clench around me.” Tony does as he’s told and Steve tightens his grip a little.
“To cuddle?” Tony waits for Steve to lay down and then joins him, resting his head on Steve’s chest. “Then yes. This is perfect.”
Steven waits for his parents to finish their explanation before saying anything. He can see the hope in their eyes and, while he does not believe he will find the one, it would be nice to have a good group of people around him he can trust. He agrees to give it a try and while his parents will be writing letters to various lords and ladies, Steven decides to travel the kingdom to meet others and choose a few people of his own.
“I’ve been here since you got in. You just didn’t notice me.” She studies his face, taking in all the little tells that Tony gives away. “Now, tell me what happened.”
“Steve?”
Sam and Bucky share sly grins over Steve’s head, happy to have won. They listen as he tells them about the night before and they restrain themselves from cheering, but only just barely. Tony and Steve are on the right track and hopefully, it won’t be much longer before they take another step forward. Maybe even actual kisses, though Sam and Bucky don't hold their breaths.
He's reminded of the stories and fairytales his mother would read to him and Tony chuckles. As a child, he’d loved listening to her voice and would ask if he’d find his true love. Maria would hold him close and tell him she believed he would one day when he was all grown. Tony’s heart aches thinking of his mother and the carriage accident that took her from him.
“Steve, oh Steve.”
As it always does when they’re together, time seems to disappear. Their plates empty and they only pause in their conversation when a few footmen come up to clear away the leftover food and plates. Tony giggles when he sees Steve’s shocked face and decides to be bold. He asks Tony where the time went and did they really eat all that food? Tony laughs again, reaching for Steve’s hand and gives it a squeeze.
For everyday, Tony wears Steve’s dog tags on a slim chain under his shirt. For the most part, Tony forgets about them, but when he’s feeling stressed or annoyed, he can press his hand to them and think of Steve and take a moment to really breathe.
“S-Sure.”
It’s Steve who reaches out first. He presses his hand to Tony’s chest, laughing quietly as the strings flow around his palm. He can feel the way Tony’s heart is racing and his own is beating just as fast.
“Want me holding you down? Force you to take it a little?”
Tony giggles. “Steve, it’s okay. I felt it the first time I saw you. I’ve always thought it was just the shock from having the prince appear at the door. But, as time went on and I knew you more, the feeling only got stronger. I just never knew what it was.”
