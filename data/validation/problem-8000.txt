Tony is slipping, his vision is getting blurry and his body is so, so heavy, his arms and legs tingling, and he will never know if he hit his head on the bench on his way down, because before he could tip over completely, he goes out like a light.

Maybe once, Tony would have done anything he needed to for them, to appease their anger and resentment, he would have broken his own back to ensure the team would be brought together again – but not anymore. Because Tony has

“Has to be.” Tony agrees.
“They’ll be safe.” Natasha exhales, relieved. “They will all be safe.”
“Daniel!” She shouts in the general direction of the door, getting up in a haste to examine the wires, the power cord, the screen, everything she can get her hands on, her heart beating so loudly in her chest she feels like it might escape. “Give me a hand here!”
It’s one of the few people Tony misses without guilt.

Tony is not sure if he’s saying that to Natasha or Tony himself, but Tony is concerned enough to add, “Make sure the guy doesn’t fall and break his neck, please, we don’t have a medic on call.” He reminds them. “Do you have eyes on Bruce? That’s the most we can do.”
But it’s hard to feel insulted by it now.

before, when Tony simply assumes everything is his fault, and so does Steve, and Steve refuses to get help, and Tony refuses to not be allowed to help. It’s nothing new; They might be superheroes, but the position doesn’t come without some sort of trauma as pre-requisite. He knows that. And he knows, on some level, that Steve might just be going through some rough days that are completely personal and Tony should not interfere. If Steve wants to talk to him, he will.
(Like Tony warned them.)
It doesn’t matter. Steve had been so determined to make Tony see that he was right, that he

Tony had seen her drive a ship straight into Thanos’ head, to charge against him with electric batons and a raging scream, asking for her sister and bloodthirsty for revenge. Tony knows in his heart, in the very core of himself, that out of all of them, Nebula has been the one who has suffered by Thanos’ hands the longest – and she

like him.”
“What.”
, ripping through their lungs and throats with all their strength, some of them jolting and jumping like they’ve been electrocuted, only to drop everything and run, run into the night, pushing others and dashing between rubble and destruction, wild fear in their eyes, like they’re afraid they’re gonna get hurt.
Rocket and Nebula share a look, half disgruntled, half reluctant, and Tony sighs raggedly, pinching his nose as if he could somehow abate the stinging soreness in his eyes, before standing up straight and striding as confidently as he can into the workshop, steps loose and lazy, despite the fact that he pulls his worn hoodie closer to his body, the chill so intense not even the insulation of the building and the soft protection of his duvet could have kept it away.
Steve calls Clint and Wanda, and keeps them updated. They both sound very relieved when Steve tells them Bucky is fine, that they’re all fine, and soon they’ll be on the move again. He tells them Bucky won’t be joining them however, and he’s surprised to find himself not that hurt about that idea. He feels more understanding now, after seeing Bucky. After hearing the words directly from him. He’s not completely at ease, but then, he never is these days, so as far as he is concerned, everything went as well as he could expect. Clint tells him they’re glad, they’re also fine, and they’ll be waiting for them in Egypt until they return. And that’s the end of it.
That video is the only register of their final moments alive. The only thing, besides Tony’s memories.
His eyes are so pretty.
. And if it doesn’t, he just keeps doing it until it does. It doesn’t work as well with feelings at it does with machines. Tony knows how numbers behave, he knows their patterns and their strengths, so when a machine breaks, Tony knows exactly where to tweak to make it work again. But emotions are messy. They ever work that way. So when Tony tinkers, when Tony messes around with absurd options just so he can avoid the ones he doesn’t want to consider, when he does things other people would call madness, that’s his way of trying to find something that works. It’s him pushing the limits of the possibilities until he stumbles upon one that holds best.
Tony startles a bit, surprised that Steve saw that, and Steve can
In a way. They never reach the hospital, because the night falls upon them too soon, the clouds uncaring of their struggle, drowning the world in black before they are even halfway through the job. Not even a third into the job, even. The plane had been unsalvageable, all possible clues to indicate the identity of its passengers burnt to the ground in dark soot, and Tony had been trying too hard not to think about what exactly he was seeing or he was touching when he reached out and let his fingers graze across the wall of distorted metal, staining the gold and red of his suit with ash, to process it correctly.
“And what of the others you want to find?” Nebula reminds him firmly. “While you leave to save one, others might be

Tony walks away, pretending he’s not hyper aware of the sound of Rogers’ steps echoing behind him, twin beats against the floor, as they both follow Rhodey out and proceed to have the most awkward ride of their lives; The three of them dead silent in the enclosed space, pretending they’re not aching with the instincts to shift and move to try to dispel some of the suffocating stuffiness of the elevator.

“In a manner of speaking, yes.”
He’s a bit tired too. He doesn’t even know why.
But it is, isn’t it? Tony is the reason why this is happening the way it is, the reason why Steve refuses to talk about the things that hurt him the most, the reason why he might have pushed Natasha away for good now. After everything they have done together, ever since their first battle – her jumping on his shield, following him through a mission that would destroy everything she once thought she stood for, betraying others to go to him,
“Seems like he likes them.” Tony explains. “Apparently being Irish and living in the forties hasn’t destroyed his taste buds somehow. Lucky guy.”
But then—
“Follow me.” Nebula says, all business, and Lang has no choice but to skittishly tag along as both Nebula and Rocket leave the view of the camera, walking towards the elevator, before FRIDAY cuts off the feed.
“Once was
JARVIS would have pressed the point, even if only once – Vision never had. When Tony slowly came back, because he always did, Vision accepted his help and his company not eagerly, but accepting, almost a little shy. As if he didn’t know where to stand with Tony anymore.

(Again.)
“I have to do something first.” He says, only half deflecting the question. “Sam and the others are still on the Raft. Tony hasn’t let them out. I have to get them out of there, or else Ross will take the chance and do something terrible to them. Especially to Wanda.”
?” Thor suggests.
? Or any of you?”
It’s just a language barrier. Tony knows this. But Tony is stressed and now they actually might have something more concrete to work with, written in these books they cannot read, and the world is going dark again and Tony feels like it’s swallowing him whole.
There really wasn’t much else they could do. Knowing it doesn’t make him feel any less shitty.
That’s why it kills him. Because he wasn’t ready.
But then, Steve pushes.
T’Challa takes a very careful breath, turning his gaze towards the horizon, frowning lightly. Steve feels like T’Challa didn’t quite expect that answer, because something between them turns a little somber all of a sudden. Steve, half out of respect, half out of uneasiness, also turns his gaze to a distant point through the window.
Pepper snorts an unattractive laugh. “I don’t know if that’s true.”
And on the middle, a red splatter. Dark, dark red, almost black, staining the center where the star should be.
Tony raises a hand, motioning them to stop, and they do, though out of relief or fear he’s not sure; Because they don’t relax, but they also don’t act like they’ve just been scolded anymore. They just watch him warily, like he’s a wild animal they’re trying not to provoke into attacking. It makes him feel like shit in a very specific way. He has to take a few deep breaths before he can decide what to say, because he feels so goddamn short-winded and tired, and it takes genuine effort to make his voice light and non-threatening.
“Did you not hear Scott’s verdict a few minutes ago?” Clint points to the television, accusingly. “No Raft. So yeah, it’s cool. It’s getting
“Guess that makes us even, huh?”
“Oh God.” He hears Pepper’s voice, and the distant sound of repulsor boots activating and firing up, as she probably flies to join them.

So yeah. The world is ending, and Captain America answered the call. Perfectly normal. Tony understands that.
Thor has been gone looking for the Infinity Stones. He’s been gone for years, while they were down here, fighting over pieces of paper and wanted men, and when that realization drops hard on Tony’s head, he feels like the biggest asshole in the entire universe. Thor had been out there, and Tony had almost forgotten, had almost
“I’ll have FRIDAY send a signal to all government lines still functional.” Tony says, thinking out loud. “We’ll see if we can get some help from any nation that might not have completely collapsed yet. But we still need to find a way to reach people who have already lost their communication lines. We need to remind them to stay calm and organize into groups, preferably in the same place. No one should be isolated because if something happens, they might get stuck or be hurt, and with everything destroyed, rescue won’t be able to find them – so they need to stay together.”
All he wanted was to help.

Nebula’s siblings, and Tony is pretty sure he did not mistake the venom and disgust in her voice at the sight of them on FRIDAY’s camera feeds the first time around. She doesn’t like them. Maybe she hates them as much as she hates Thanos, but Tony can’t be sure. But – if he dares to assume, he doesn’t think Nebula could have had any kind feelings for her other siblings other than aversion, because those siblings are like

convenient.”
(Because what other reaction can you have when the entire universe has fallen apart?)
“We will not stop Mr. Lang from being a hero, if he wishes to continue to be one.” Vision innocently counters, as if Clint has just made a preposterous accusation. As if he – or anyone – would try to stop Scott from doing whatever he wants. Steve can’t help but question if this is actually true, if he can honestly believe this, that the Accords will not put Scott on a leash as they did to Wanda; or if this is just Vision’s innocence, his lack of understanding of the human nuances and deceits to be able to tell a lie from a truth. He thinks he is being unfair, but he cannot help it.
He can feel the weight of Natasha’s gaze, her laser sharp focus burning in his face, but he doesn’t raise his eyes to look at her. He can’t bring himself to do so.

It had been tentative, and, Tony knows now, not exactly what he thought it was, but it had its moments – and it’s startling, to realize that Thor, a god who literally has a weapon that has wounded Thanos before, is still
“It was a domestic thing. The Avengers were not supposed to be in Lagos, technically.” Rhodey explains. “If it’s aliens, no one has a problem with us stepping in and helping, because we have specialized equipment. But Steve and the others were hunting down this…
“Relax.” Clint says – and the drawl of the last vowel, the lazy tilt of his tone, it’s all so familiar that it’s hard to conciliate the idea that Tony hasn’t heard that in so long. “You know I never miss.”
“Both the axe and the hammer were made by the same person? The guy who made the Gauntlet?” Tony inquires, getting back on track – not very smoothly, but Thor doesn’t seem to mind it.
He’ll ask Nebula where she ran off to later. She’s probably listening in anyway, from the way she’s so wary of everyone. Tony doesn’t really care right now.

He can’t move, exactly. He tries to, he tries to talk or to do something, anything, like taking a step back or raising a hand or even blinking, but it’s like his brain isn’t sending down the right commands to his limbs because every single motion Tony makes, no matter how small, feels like it’s in slow motion. Like moving through molasses. He and Natasha stare at each other, both of them looking like deer in the headlights, and Tony can’t do

Tony swallows dry. “Yeah, I got that. So?”

“Take him with you. I would take him myself, but I’ll be away for the next months or so, catching up on some… personal business. Your home is not close to this area. As far as everyone knows, you lost contact with Howard Stark years ago. There is no connection that would allow anyone to reach you, not without being obvious. You will never be the first candidate on the list of people I might trust. He will be safe with you; and you can keep him company while I’m away.”
“I lied.” Nebula lies.
“As much as the Queen is willing to give. I just hope it’s a lot.” Tony gestures exasperatedly with his arms open, almost shrugging when he raises his shoulders defensively in such a quick move. “I know they’re not fans of outsiders, much less someone like me, but if we have Natasha and Rogers backing us up, this might go better than if it’s just two aliens, one of which is an overgrown Furby, and us begging for scraps through the phone.”
He wants to stop, and he doesn’t at the same time. He thought he was over this. He didn’t know he was capable of feeling this way, but apparently he is; and screaming it all out, yelling at Barton’s face – it made him feel better, but at the same time, it didn’t. So what else can he do?
Please.

Tony closes his eyes, with all his strength, until it hurts.
“He wasn’t really my friend, he was…” Thor tries to explain, but his words get lost in the space between them all, dissolving into nothingness, with just a faraway look in his mismatched eyes as proof that something inside him is holding a grief he cannot properly explain with words.
Tony has to fix that.
And it kills him to know that Pepper knows it too. That she knows what it might cost.

When they go back to the kitchen, they walk quietly. They are both lost in deep thoughts, concerns and doubts poorly concealed beneath the fronts of strength they put forward in favor of their mission; and maybe that’s why no one hears them coming closer, not until they are already back at the kitchen, and they halt right by the door, suddenly alert.

“Hey, you two.” He calls, “Why don’t you go down to the lab and grab me the toolbox? The blue one, you know which one it is. Bring it here. With all tools, Dum-E! No throwing the hammer at the wall again!” Tony is damn near screaming by the end of his sentence, because the bots just start running as soon as he mentions the lab, but it’s fine. It’s not like he was lying when he said they get restless when they stay still for far too long, because they do.
“You knew half of it.” Natasha muses, and Clint turns his head to look at her, curious, and they share a silent gaze that says more than entire conversations ever could, in less than a few seconds.

Nebula squeezes her jaw very shut, grinding her teeth.

“I retracted it, but it moved awkwardly.” Tony confesses. “It froze when the blade went through it. It shouldn’t have done that. It was also trying to rearrange itself because it was losing particles too fast and I had to keep shifting it so it wouldn’t leave me exposed. It’s toast. If I try to put it on, the particles inside me might shift and—”
He is a king. And he expects to be obeyed.
He tries to speak, but it comes out as a sob. He bites his lip, ashamed of the sound, and he almost breaks skin with how hard his teeth sink into it, nearly drawing blood. He wouldn’t stand to feel the coppery taste on his tongue again right now.
(Gone.)
Maybe sadder, even, how clearly Tony can recognize it as something he sees in the mirror, what he used to see the first few months after the Accords, what he sees now every time he wakes up, and remembers that the world is sentenced to death.

“What is it, Howard?” Maria asks, kind of breathless, the way she always sounds these days. It’s a strange kind of fatigue, that makes her weary down to her bones. “Shouldn’t you be in bed?”
“They might come back”, Rhodey warns them, and it’s true. In fact, they probably will. They can’t, in good conscience, leave them here. Tony tells them so.
“Not even if we go to his…
“Not if she’s already set some sort of plan in motion herself.” Rhodey counters. “Knowing those guys in Wakanda, they’re already doing what we’re doing, only three times faster. We insult them and we don’t get anything.”

Rhodey’s eyes flash dangerously focused, deep concern etched into his features.  “How long has it been since you last slept?”
They have very little belongings with them, but they grab it all as they leave, and they’re greeted by the sight of T’Challa’s personal guard, the Dora Milaje, all standing close to end of the platform, seemingly at ease. But even so, Steve does feel the kind of threat they impose, just by being present. He knows their presence is not something personal – they are the royal guard, and it’s perfectly logical that they should be present when a strange plane enters the palace territory – but even if he passes them with no hesitation, he can feel their analyzing and assessing as he does, and it does make him more alert, adrenaline pumping back into his veins, like his body is using whatever excuse it can get to make him feel distressed.
But the fight hadn’t started there, had it?
“It’s great seeing you, Steve.” He says.
“No. But now we’re on the same team, and I can’t pretend I didn’t try to hurt you once.”
“Yeah. Fine.” Tony exhales, a little too winded. Mercifully it just sounds like exhaustion, which is the most perfect excuse he could come up with at the moment.

dangerous, and the sheer amount of times he has put her in a bad situation just because he couldn’t let the suit go is more than enough proof of that. So it grates, a little. It stings, even though he doesn’t admit out loud.
After all, he always has.
And after a pat, his hand falls away, giving Steve one last look before turning on his heels and heading to his room, leaving Steve to his worst two enemies; the enemies that might, someday, be his downfall, even when the worst kind of villains couldn’t finish the job.
(And that’s so – that’s so weird, that Tony is so mushy over some stupid bots, even if they are

, somehow,
Let's go slow and take it from the top. Starting with a topic that has become a core issue for me - and I suspect to a lot of people as well, for a very good reason: Thanos' plan. We're all familiar with it. With a snap of his fingers, Thanos' intent is to wipe away half the population of the entire universe so he can achieve 'balance' - when he simply could have, you know, increased the resources, or eliminated the distribution problem, or chosen any other more educated option. Instead, he disrupted the entire social structure of the universe and called it a day. But what about populations he already helped diminish in his hunt for the stones? Do they get halved anyway - if they even survived being attacked? What about populations that don't consume resources like humankind - like Groot's race, that consists primarily of beings that produce their own sustenance, meaning there is no proper food chain that establishes a hierarchy of resources and consumers? How does the snap work on them? Because it does, as we all saw it. Is the lack of space left to occupy his main concern? So why not populate abandoned planets and use the gauntlet to make them habitable?
– as Clint calls it, while he squeezes a barely-reciprocating Natasha in his arms – with a hand carefully placed of her shoulder, and his face composed in a very careful blank mask.
And I will be even worse once you’re back. No more of this… secret dating schtick.”
A blur of red and blue passes through the screen, swinging fast and wild, and Tony’s eyes go to the floor immediately.
, and this… This division they were doing didn’t really mean anything.
There’s that word again.
“Okay.” Rogers agrees. “I will.”
to throw himself into the war and put himself in direct line of sight of the strongest enemy they’ve ever faced; That was still safer than face the possibility that Tony had already fallen in some other battlefield Steve couldn’t reach. Of all wounds, Steve could have taken anything, anything but such a strike to his heart at that moment.
In the end, none of them sleep for the first three days. They try, but they simply can’t.
to stick together.”
He does this because he knows there’s a chance he won’t have it later.
“Wong.” Tony greets, with an inexplicable feeling of being whiplashed by seeing the man, despite him being the very one who asked Rogers to locate him in the first place. “It’s good to see you’re fine.”
“And which one of you is going to sacrifice themselves to snap your fingers and bring all those people back?”
“I told her the same thing.” Clint explains, exasperatedly. “And she said:
“You know...” Natasha drawls, “Most people just go with fake boyfriend. You really didn’t have to go with fake

“— But I can’t sit here and not help when it sounds like you guys are doing this very dangerous thing all on your own.” Lang heaves out a harsh exhale, the words coming out of his mouth like they’re running a hundred miles an hour, the frantic gleam in his eyes, the bags under them, the pale tone of his skin doing nothing to diminish the fervent sentiment in his voice, the assured tone of his message. “Alright? I know, I know we’ve had your differences, and I’m so sorry, but I really want to do everything I can to help, because I can’t let my baby girl go sick while I watch, okay? I have to do something about it, if I can help, I wanna help.”
in the way, Buck.” Steve reassures, even though words are never good enough for Bucky when he is like this. Steve’s words have never, ever done justice to his actions.
Steve wants to. He wants to apologize.
so many things beyond his control he can’t quite accept and let go of -, he asks, his tone dry and snappish. “Why not?”
“You said Stark attacked you.” Sam reasons, gripping Steve’s shoulder tight, trying to be reassuring. “He attacked Barnes, right? You fought back, man, that’s not wrong.”

He tried to beat him into submission.
Steve makes a tight pause. “I’ll be there in five hours.”
; But no one really is, isn’t it? But he’s alive. Tony hadn’t been sure, because Bruce’s and Mantis’ accounts contradicted themselves, and by now, Tony is constantly expecting the worst. But Thor made it, and Tony happy to know it. He and Tony had never been close, definitely not enough to hug it out like Rhodey and Bruce have, but Tony cares about him, and wishes he wasn’t going through this as much as everyone else.
Because there is

His husband is big, but he is not threatening – he is… a source of protection. He is intimidating, but in an oddly transfixing way, as powerful men often are. Antonio’s fingers twist on the pelt beneath him, the thick, soft hairs pleasant and satisfying to grasp, the perfect brace as his breath escapes in a fleeting gasp at the rush of want that crashes in his body suddenly, by the sight of the Captain kneeling before him on the furs, coming closer, but he is not deterred – he removes his furs too, adding them to the pile where they lay, as eager to get undressed as his husband. Perhaps he shouldn’t. It’s desperate, unbecoming, even.
(After all—)
He feels wound up so tight it’s a marvel he doesn’t snap.
, with his…
Maybe all of that had been Wanda. Maybe it had been Loki.
“Okay, we’ll put a pin on that.” Tony presses, not allowing the conversation to stray too far. “No other register of it before then?”
But this is not about Bucky. That’s not why she is hurt.
“Be careful.” Tony nods, a little too rushed; Too casual and too worried, too dismissive and too pleading, always, always too much. It’s stupid. He won’t dwell on it, not now. “Call in if anything goes wrong.”
(How poetic is that?)
Rocket is the one to offer her comfort this time. He doesn’t put a hand on her shoulder, but he steps closer, close enough that he can brush against her a little, silent companionship, and Nebula shifts her weight to her other leg so she can stay close, unknowingly or not.

“I’m sorry.” The words stumble out of Tony’s mouth, awkward and uncertain, but sincere – because he has no idea who this Gamora is, but he thinks she was probably someone to respect, if half the universe seems to be in a tirade to find her… or, he guesses,
But he keeps putting the pieces back together. Over and over again, even if they’re not as seamless, even if they’re not as shiny as they used to be. But he keeps doing it. Because he would rather have them, cuts in his hands, sleepless nights, and all that comes with it, than not having them at all.
He can’t ignore it.
“So, how did you guys meet?” says Bruce, with all the awkwardness of someone who doesn’t know how to maintain small talk with someone who clearly admires him, unintentionally making it sound like a distant relative who’s fishing for the story of how Tony and Lang got eloped somehow.
Also related to Part 1, I should also let you know there is going to be a very long discussion about Wanda somewhere down this road. It is heavily influenced by AoU, after all. So if we have any Wanda stans in the house, I assure you now that my intention is not to make a open hunting season on Wanda, but you might be bothered by some parts of this discussion. Some of it is not gonna be flattering. This is me letting you know in advance, so don’t say I didn’t warn you.

accused him to be, and he cannot find the strength to move and escape from it, after so many months doing exactly that.
It’s dangerous. It will… If they manage to pull it off, chances are some of them might not come back alive. Maybe even all of them.
Steve chuckles too, although what he’s feeling is something more akin to hysteria than actual humor, but he doesn’t think it makes a difference. “Yeah.” He agrees, the words flowing out of him before he can think about them, his whole façade just crumbling at Bucky’s feet, leaving him completely unguarded. “The team was… They were in a rough spot. I went to get them out.”
That was – what the
Pepper has always been a force of nature, always been a tidal wave crashing into Tony’s life, and he’s so lucky she has given him any chance at all to love her back, to be hers, to let himself be vulnerable with. She has given him so much. And he knows it. He doesn’t take it for granted, at all. But he knows her, as she knows him, and they both know each other far too well to pretend this is about anything other than what it truly is. Just like Tony can’t stand the thought of not acting and not helping when he

He looks older. Older than Tony remembered him. Too old, too tired for his age.
(But I tried to warn you.)

Tony finds her in their room, the door left open in her haste, but frozen still between the entrance and the bed. The armor is nowhere in sight. Even as her back is turned to him, her arms are crossed and her shoulders are tense, the tight coil she’s holding inside her clearly visible now she doesn’t have the firmness of metal around her to disguise her distress, and Tony sadly realizes she is
Okay, then.
They start to descend, and he gives a quick look to both his of them, seeing Natasha adjusting her uniform and arming herself with her Bites and knives, as the Quinjet enters the autopilot for a safe landing and Sam quickly reaches for his Wings, the perfect replica princess Shuri had given him once his original had been taken by Ross.
Bruce pauses.
Because he wouldn’t. She is not. Tony fixing her shoulder has nothing to do with it. It’s… It’s just what Tony does. He sees broken tech, he fixes it. That’s all. He’d just been paying back Nebula’s help, when she helped him into the ship. They are only helping each other survive this, and that is that.
“No, of course not.” Ms. Carter huffs. “He asked my name and my designation, so I introduced myself, and told him I was a friend”.
“So what’s the problem!?”
He only realizes he had so much to lose after he’s already lost it, and Anthony is gone, and Maria is grieving so deeply she might as well have gone with him.  She is young and kind, a gentle soul, really, much more than Howard could ever pretend to be, and he knows that as hard as he took Anthony’s death when it happened, Maria felt it much worse. It was always worse for the mother. Anthony had been his son, and he grieved in his own way – even though the world sometimes liked to say he’s completely heartless -, but, at the end of the day, Howard Stark is a visionary. He’s always looking forward. He struggled, he mourned, but he kept going because Stark men don’t have the luxury of sitting by while the world keeps spinning.
I'm sorry for the delay on this chapter, folks, but I hope you like it <3 Also, please, make sure to check out the end notes, I have something important to mention :)
Bucky still hesitates.
Nevermind the fact that all Steve has to do is to get over being embarrassed about a joke.
He waits. He always waits.

“Not that we know of. We didn’t even manage to get close enough to hit him.” Rhodey admits bitterly.
“Tony.” Steve tells him. “Let’s take the Tesla.”
Steve looks at him desperately. “If not you, then who else?”

Steve had no idea they could look like that. Stark or Romanov.

Tony doesn’t seem to take it personally, but Steve regrets not taking his chance to give Tony a hug.
too late, is that Tony’s heart was not the only part of him that was damaged by the presence of the Arc Reactor. The casing used to be seated right into his sternum, probably through the bone, and that means that whatever it is that is holding Tony’s chest together today, it’s artificial, and it might

This chapter also includes an extra treat: the introductions of a few characters I'm very eager to discuss a little more. Well, it'll be a treat for me. I wonder how you are going to feel about it when we get there. There sure will be some diverging opinions, I suspect. But since when am I known for avoiding delicate topics? They won't have entire arcs of their own, unfortunately - but see if that can stop me from including them and stirring the pot, just because I can. I said no stone unturned. I'm going to keep that promise.

“It’s safe now, you can leave”, Agent Ross explains.
“My name is Tony. Tony Stark.” Tony offers demurely, voice breaking when it travels through his scratched throat, parched mouth and blood-stained teeth. Despite all of that, when he looks at his companion, to the blue skin of the hands that are both soft and strong at his sides, to the pitch-black eyes and the mouth twisted on a frown, he hopes it comes off gentle, even if just a little bit, because he feels like he owes this to the Guardian.

And then, she raises her gaze at him, piercing and incredibly telling.

, and it is slowly driving him insane, ebbing away all the fight and all the anger and all the drive, and leaving him… with this. Which is ridiculous, because how can someone be hollow in two different ways? How can the hole inside his chest ache in two distinct beats, two wavelengths, one that stings sharp and one that burns slow? And he can’t make it stop, because once again,
Tony decides not to press it.
“Bucky is my best friend.” Steve says in a low, reserved tone, his eyes cast down so he doesn’t have to face Sam. As if that would make any difference.
“No one will dare attack us. And if someone did, I can take them down alone.”
“They won’t leave.” Nebula says, with eerie confidence, not giving Tony any time to ponder what the hell Sakaaran trash is supposed to mean.
He has been keeping himself away for a while. He puts on a disguise and goes around the city for hours, sometimes unnecessarily, just so he can have some time alone, so he can think. Being among the civilians helps a bit. In the middle of the crowd, no one notices him, no one sees him, and it’s the only time he doesn’t feel like he’s being watched or suffocated by the stifling aura he created between himself and his teammates back at their rented rooms.
“Want to go have dinner?” Steve asks, smiling.
There’s a beat of silence, tentative and fragile, and Tony waits for a protest or a snide remark that, surprisingly, never comes. It makes something funny unfurl inside his chest.
“Captain?” Shuri calls, and Steve startles, realizing he has been standing in front of his old suit for minutes now, just staring at it, trying hard not to think about the tears and the cuts and what exactly they meant.

We've been talking about some really serious stuff so far, but there is still something we have yet to address in any way, shape, or form, not only me - but many people in this fandom, I believe. Not because we don't see it, no. We see it, but it's so much easier to talk about it when it's in a happy tone. This is the kind of stuff that sparks a very particular kind of sadness, of pain, because like I said: Family is complicated. And in a universe such as this, where daddy issues are undoubtedly a very prevalent problem, we can't really be surprised at how extremely powerful the subject of children is.
“They’re grown-ups, they can handle it.” Tony assures, in a tone that’s far too soft and gentle for the dismissiveness of his words. Seeing Bruce this uncomfortable, this ungrounded – it has always made something inside Tony go unexpectedly mellow, a twinge of sympathy that makes his insides feel like they’re liquid. It even makes the words sound more confident than Tony truly feels.
(Not anymore.)
Stops, as in – her entire body locks up, as if she’s been shocked with a live wire; and although she doesn’t jump, or startle, the movement is perceptible, the sudden cut of air between her words and her silence, the strangled breath that dies as it passes her lips, making no sound, like it’s blinking out of existence as soon as it manifests.
If the cool kids wanna hang out with Tony, they have to meet his standards. That’s all.

“Poisonous.” Natasha completes, with not much gentleness in her voice.
“And what will you do? Sit tight while I take a nap, read a magazine and wait until I heal fully before going out to save the world?”
Tony doesn’t know Gamora, didn’t even get the chance to meet her when the Guardians found them on Titan. By then, Thanos had already taken her. But he understands. Tony feels an echo of Nebula’s pain in his own chest, a hollow thrum that stings with every heartbeat, the corners and edges still hot and sharp when they move and breathe. Aching loss. Tony can so easily imagine the kind of woman Gamora must have been – Nebula’s sister, she sure would have been just as fierce, just as precise and determined.
The childish, petty part of Steve almost wants to make a jab at Bucky, something ridiculous like
He looks like he was caught stealing a candy bar from a 7-Eleven and now has no way out of the scolding of a lifetime.

“Who did this?” She demands the answer, even if her voice is soft.
“He wanted to talk to us. He refused to tell me what about before you guys arrived.”

Huh. Weird. They make a face at Bruce, but Bruce only shakes his head, somehow embarrassed, and gestures a dismissal with his hand.
! We need to go.
Every time he ponders about it, he remembers Ms. Carter’s warning. He remembers the story of what followed Captain America’s sacrifice, about the soldiers Johann Schmidt left behind when he vanished, and their attempts to finish what HYDRA had started. HYDRA hadn’t died when the Red Skull disappeared because there was always someone willing to take command of those who are left alive and free, he knows it well, because ideals are much harder to destroy than individuals, and HYDRA had once its claws so deep into those men that not even the alleged death of their leader would stop them.
“You probably should go check in on those guys you set loose at your R&D, Tony.” Bruce reminds him kindly. “Make sure they’re not panicking – well, not too much.”
“Next step is to find him.” Rogers continues.
“Then why are you upset?” He asks, a little insensitively, maybe, but it’s such genuine shock that he can’t even think twice before blurting out the words.
SHIELD, who has been compromised.
They are hiding in Cambodia this time around. It’s getting harder and harder to move with the entire group, they are too many and not inconspicuous at all, not when their faces are known by the entire world. It’s their last night together, they decided – Wanda and Clint will go a bit farther without them, and Scott is still thinking about what he’ll do, and he only has a few hours left to decide. They leave as soon as the sun rises.
He feels so incredibly relieved for being here. He hasn’t been here since he went back for the team, forcefully putting some distance between himself and Bucky, as princess Shuri asked him to. He doubts she meant something so extreme, but Steve felt like it was necessary, or else—or else he wouldn’t have been able to do it. He knows he can’t think clearly whenever Bucky is involved, his deep-seated instincts to keep him close and safe sometimes making him careless, but now he’s trying hard to give Bucky the space he needs. Or he was.
the Gauntlet, that’s the thing.” Rhodey reminds him. “We’re gonna have our own. So we just need the Stones.”
Maybe he should.
Wanda clears her throat gently, rubbing her hand against her cheek to wipe away the moisture of the tears, and he sniffs before replying, her voice surprisingly steady: “Yes. Yes, it’s fine. Viz and I needed to talk, that’s all.” She pauses, and shoots Vision a light, unsure smile. “Everything is fine now.”

“Go figure it out.” Natasha commands, and as she turns the TV on and settles in her spot, Steve knows he is, somehow, being dismissed.
Clint has a long moment of confusion right before his eyes, his expression scrunching up and his brows furrowing almost cartoonishly, until realization dawns on him and he sobers up almost at the speed of light, his whole posture shifting from relaxed to alert.
“The library of the Kamar-Taj has hundreds of scrolls and books containing information about magic in its many forms over the years.” Wong calmly says, like he’s giving them a history lesson.

“And you’ve commanded troops before.” Nebula reinforces, only adding fuel to the fire in Tony’s belly. “We saw the footage of your armor – you organized my sister’s idiotic family into an almost functional force. So why wouldn’t you do the same with your own team?”
Which is an

Steve wants to look into a mirror and not dread what he sees, in the beard on his face or the holes in his uniform. He wants to be that good man again, the man who isn’t haunted by the stupid, unthinking things that he did, the man who is more than Captain America, the man who is only Steve Rogers, and that’s
“Like air-conditioners?” Agent Ross insists, still clearly confused.
And he hasn’t forgotten, since it happened.
“You think you’re the only one with family back home, Barton? Really?” Sam jabs.
So, no, Tony doesn’t actually need him.
Vision makes a sound that almost seems like surprise, like he wasn’t expecting this. “Yes, he is. But it is not the same as it was before, Captain, I can tell you that. His heart has recovered from the extraction of the Reactor and his sternum healed correctly. This reactor is a new version of it, not invasive as the previous one Mr. Stark used to wear, and it is based on a different kind of technology. It allows him to have the armor close at all times, in case of necessity. He says its… for precaution.”
Tony almost wants to tell her she might not have a choice.
Nebula doesn’t answer. She just shoves the shirt in Tony’s hands, who recognizes the gesture as the order it is, and he pulls it over his head and down his body with some slight difficulty, still half leaning on Nebula for support.

(How can he—)
“I don’t know exactly, he was hiding it at first.” Natasha says pensively. “Somewhere around two months ago. It’s hard to tell, it’s not always visible. I don’t know what kind of Reactor it is, because it’s not the same as the one he had, but that kind of information is very hard to find, even with the connections I have. Especially since it’s Tony we’re talking about.”

he, when he’s just like her, deep inside?
Tony thinks of the first years into their relationship, how bright and intense everything had felt, the years and years of pining for each other and still keeping a professional barrier between them mounting so many strong feelings behind it that, when the wall finally broke, the wave that came in felt just like being stepping into the sun after decades in the dark. Overwhelming, extreme, and overcoming. How they hadn’t known, exactly, how to transition from one thing to the other. It took work. She had been amazing – and Tony kind of wants to tell her that, it was not her fault, she tried so hard – but she said not to interrupt – and Tony – Tony knows what she means.
“You guys be safe, alright? Don’t slouch, don’t get cocky. I don’t want any of you to get caught not even

The color is not the best, but Red, White and Blue are kind of Cap’s whole brand, so Tony compromises: two suits. One with the proper color scheme, and a stealth suit. Dark blue, maybe. Cap would look great in dark blue. The material is nice, to be honest, but the distribution of the padding is not the best, so some redesigning is in order.
of the tale, how easily Tony can see where the experience and the Accords discussion blend into one another, how many times this problem has happened over the history and just left unsolved, just building itself on top of the ones before, until no one can see a solution for it.

They fall into their roles like dominos. Like they’re meant to. As if gravity itself pulls them all into this one place, this one spot – And Tony fears, for a moment, that this was inevitable. It is… the scariest, most horrible idea he can possibly fathom. That this would always have to happen, this tragedy, this cursed fate – that this is the only thing that would have dragged them back together after what happened, and in doing so, even if it changed everything… It hasn’t. It hasn’t changed a thing.

And he doesn’t mean to sound like a petty teenager who didn’t got what he asked for his birthday, but that’s just how it comes off, and it’s too late to stop now. He’s said it, he’s bitter, and he can’t hide it, apparently. If he had the courage to tell them, to pry open his heart and explain in detail what happened, he wonders if they would understand – if Nebula, who once only knew to process her loss and abandonment by seeking violence against the sister who left her, instigated by her captor, or if Rocket, who holds Nebula’s arm and whose eyes go misty at the mention of the idea of family, if he could explain to them what exactly the Avengers had meant to him before they all fell apart like a house of cards, if they would understand. Tony knows what they’re trying to do, and in some other moment, maybe, he would at least have commended them for being clever, for—
“When Thanos escaped.” Thor says, and his words bleed guilt and grief, heavy as his hammer, a weight too heavy for any of them to comprehend. “He snapped his fingers and wiped away half the universe – and it cost him the Gauntlet. I saw it, up close. It was burned and deformed.”
Steve doesn’t blame them.

When they reach the workshop and the doors open, he damn near succeeds.
Tony squeezes his eyes with his thumb and index finger, pressing into the bridge of his nose, trying in vain to keep a splitting headache at bay – and if his hand hides his face, if he leans his head down and faces the floor to hide from the shame for his lack of control, he hopes Thor won’t ask.

The Winter Soldier shrugs. “Works for me.”

“Ok.” Jarvis sighs, a bit exasperated, squaring his shoulders and pushing out his chest to adjust his posture, trying to take the deepest breath he can take. “Very well. You have a deal, Deputy Chief.”
“It’s been a pleasure, Captain.”
They all seem utterly and completely heartbroken. Rhodey, right next to Tony, looks so sad it sends a rush of worry through Tony’s body, just like Thor, who stares at his feet with a face so conflicted Tony barely even knows how to interpret it.
Tony breathes, as calmly as he can, and asks, “How many?”

Somehow, he finds himself with his arm around Steve’s waist, gripping him tight and pulling him closer, enough that Tony can hold on to him and take flight, dragging him away from the woman and the crowd by sheer force. They blast through the sky, retreating quickly towards the White House garden, where Tony can shakily see Natasha standing there waiting, as Carter and Ross, looking lost and worried out of their minds, carrying their guns in iron grips and shaking hands, breathless and heaving, undoubtedly confused and scared of the sudden sounds of screaming retreat outside the House when they were supposed to be

And this is – this is on a small scale. Tony has no idea what has happened to the governments. Hell,
He knows, when the sun comes out, that he has nowhere to run.
“Good.” Tony nods, pretending he can’t hear how winded he sounds, that he almost went completely insane and drove himself into a panic attack just because of that scare. “Can’t wait to leave this place. Do we get to watch a movie during the flight? Or it’s not available to economic class?”
But it’s more than that.
“Hey, Smurfette.” Tony calls, and it only goes to show how truly focused on him she is, because her eyes snap back to his with no question, not even a slight wavering of her guarded posture even with the use of the nickname. A warm surge of something that is far too close to affection crashes in tidal waves in his chest, and it leaks into his voice, curling malleable around his words. “It’s okay. We’re safe. There’s no threat.”
, how is he going to explain Nebula’s presence to people?
Why he misses home, even though he’ll probably never have it back.
The whiplash is almost strong enough to make him dizzy.
“Wong… Thank you.” Rogers says, before any of them can react in any other way, and Tony dares to steal a look at him, curious to see if Rogers has realized the same thing Tony has, and this is his way of ensuring Wong realizes how much this means to them, after his irritable display a few moments ago by the entrance.
, it’s driving him insane. He wants to fight the Accords, but he doesn’t want to think about it.

He stops, because he fears what the words that almost came tumbling out of his mouth might cause. It wouldn’t be the first time that the way Tony phrases this idea causes distress between them, his failing to convey correctly the mess of feelings and intentions in his chest pushing Pepper into a frantic state of frustration and concern. This is how it always starts.

He wonders if that changes what she thinks of him.
Tony knows he’s probably not being as discreet as he should with his staring, but he doesn’t really care, even if he’s being intense enough that it makes Nebula raise her gaze and look at him uncomfortably, her entire face scrunched up.
He has to be a soldier.
Tony has no idea. He doesn’t even know what exactly is it that he’s feeling right now.
“Alive, Boss.” FRIDAY says, in a low tone. “They’re alive.”
“There are people.” Tony exhales, so suddenly and sharply it almost sounds like a sob. “In the hospital. We have to go back in there. I have to see them—”

It’s strange, to think Steve could have been… what,
He doesn’t get to keep her.
“Don’t kill him.” Both Natasha and Tony reply, but Tony is horrified, and Natasha acts like it’s a bothersome reminder to a child.

Tony gives out a little sarcastic hum, snorting. “Sounding a little arrogant there, Smurfette.”

“A bit too late for that.” Clint chuckles darkly, mockery tainting his tone. “This kind of life? You don’t stop once you start. It
Out of all the people who stood by the Accords, the one he least expected to break them would be Vision. Natasha had broken them, but who in the world can make Natasha do anything she doesn’t want to? She comes and goes as she pleases.

Tony stares at the back of her head for a few seconds, not exactly suspicious; But still, instinctively wary, and only when she doesn’t turn back at all Tony feels comfortable enough to bring his hand around the casing of the compartment and pressing into the safety locks, popping the front open and exposing the inner workings of it so he can work on connecting all the cables correctly himself, trying not to damage it further on the process.
Oh, that’s gonna hurt like a bitch when he finally lays down to sleep somewhere. He can already imagine the pain flaring stiff on his muscles when he wakes up.
Steve had once thought his stubbornness was one of his qualities.
“He is.” Jarvis nods, a tiny smile making its way known into his face. Ms. Carter gives him an exasperated look, half mad, half fond, and then she sighs – and Jarvis can hear so much in that sigh. It makes him feel nostalgic. It reminds him of the first time they met, their unlikely alliance, and the unique bond they formed over their trials and tribulations together. It makes him ache for simpler times, even though he knows those times were not simpler at all. He just had more time. More strength. More hope. But he feels hopeful now, with Ms. Carter by his side, all steel and strength as she always was, the way Jarvis always remembered her to be. “Thank you, Ms. Carter.”

There is Zemo, who is currently imprisoned in the Raft, but Zemo doesn’t talk. Everett Ross has tried to force him, Natasha once said, right at those first months on the run, while she was giving them the info she could gather before she made her escape – and Zemo never talked. Not for a sense of smugness or superiority, or so the reports said. There was no arrogance or prepotency in his refusal to cooperate.

When suddenly, a bright spark of red and orange snaps into existence right in front of Tony, scaring him into almost toppling over when he scrambles to get away from the table, his fight or flight instinct activating a visceral response and sending his heartbeat into skyrocketing speeds when the spark gets stronger and stronger, and it starts to move in a circular motion, big and wide, before Tony realizes what it

He doesn’t know for how long.
“Nat.” he gasps, so softly is barely makes a sound, but the way his back straightens and his hand darts out to hold her forearm before she can get up is more than enough to gather her attention.
But it’s only that, a distant thought, too far away for him to reach when the immediate thing on his mind is the pure and unbending feeling of discomfort of
“Oh, I – I would rather skip my turn on the Truth Circle, if that’s alright.” Bruce laughs, a little hysterically. “I don’t think it would be good for anyone to relive what I saw that day.”
Steve doesn’t want the shield back. He could care less about the shield.
I've made my problems with Wanda no secret, and though I will not call her a villain or anything of the sort, calling her a hero is... difficult for me. I don't think any of you would be surprised about that. But it is interesting, if you think about it, what her presence means in this story and in the other characters' lives, if you dig deep enough. For plot reasons, even. I'd like to show you a theory of mine, so you'll see what I mean. And considering her powers come from an Infinity Stone, it will fit right in with our plot.
“I can see why.” Bruce snorts, and seems totally unbothered by the look Barton throws him. “What? You want me to pretend she didn’t make me destroy a city?”
Someone who doesn’t have that much strength to believe in much anymore. It feels refreshing to see her, the way she exudes calm and tranquility, her mind fast but steady, and her manners sweet but imposing. It’s a powerful combination. Steve is sure both her family and her country are very proud of her.

that?” Rocket exclaims, and they all burst into varying expressions of dissent, loud and low, assertive and confused.
“That’s why the Mind Stone was the one to warn us.” Bruce says, in a tone of wondrous realization. “Because it was the only Stone that had been in contact with Thanos before.”
(I’ll fight you, every single step of the way.)
“Shut up, Steve.”
and as soon as possible, Vision will be making the journey back and meeting her there.
Tony thinks he loses time.
“I’m sorry, Nat. I’m sorry for lying.” Steve says, his voice cracking at the edges, his vision getting blurry and his breath starting to sound heaved, and he is panicking and he can’t stop it.
“It’s worth the try.” Bruce insists, looking at Tony with pleading eyes. “Whatever Thanos gave them, even if it’s not exactly a new kind of element, it was definitely pretty strong. Maybe it could give us a hint that would speed this up.”

Tony realizes he can’t find in himself the strength to answer Nebula’s question, whatever answer that would be, mind going too fast to process words – so he doesn’t. He simply stands there for a second, barely hesitating, before grabbing Pepper by the hand and making a gesture towards the side at Nebula, and says:
Well. You know. Marriage. Tony hadn’t been the kind of guy anyone would have married at the time, granted, but it didn’t – he still thought about it. What if. Isn’t that Tony’s entire shtick? What if. He thought about it, because he had to, because—

“How are you guys doing?” Pepper asks, breaking the silence – and even though her words are gentle and curious, not at all ill-intentioned, Tony still feels a rush of breath escape his lungs in a sigh, an inkling of a bad feeling rearing up its head over his shoulder, small, quiet, but present.
“I know it didn’t always seem like it. I wasn’t always the best at saying what I meant, and getting used to it in the first years… It was tough.” Pepper says in a rush, breath harsh and winded. It sounds like it hurts her too. “But I did say things I didn’t mean, or I didn’t mean
Wanda steps back a bit further and their moment passes. When it does, Vision turns to them with his expression serious, determined, and he takes a step forward to make sure they all can see him properly, before he announces:
“She can’t stand me fighting. She can’t.” Tony explains, looking down to the Gauntlet so he won’t have to look at Thor. “And she was right, when she said this was dangerous. We don’t even know if we’re gonna make it to Thanos, much less if we’re gonna get out alive from

Not looking back is as much a defiance as it is self-preservation at this point, to block out your own ears and pretend that what you’re doing can be ignored, just for a little while, just enough for you to take a breather and think, even when you know that the situation is
“As you’d prefer, Visitor.” FRIDAY replies all sugary sweet, sass and elegance, her vowels rolling supple and round, her cadence just like the incredible woman she’d been modeled after had been.

“Of that I have no doubt. I would refuse to part ways with him if I had any other choice, but unfortunately, I do not. At least, with you, I am sure he will be safe.” Jarvis says, with absolute honesty. He has nothing to fear. Ms. Carter is someone he holds dear. She is someone he can trust. “Don’t worry. He is a quiet company. Dare I say, in due time, he might actually grow on you.”
Just a few days shy of his birthday, he’s taken from them. Taken in the most literal sense, dead in the night, by some mysterious kidnapper that didn’t leave any goddamn clues. God, they look

A gunshot cuts through the night, loud and dry, and collectively, they all drop low in instinct, crouching and throwing themselves on the floor, panic wrecking through them like an explosion, unleashing chaos upon the entire block. It so unexpected, so sudden; Tony feels disoriented, like everyone else, just as helpless, and it awful that it takes him even longer to react, because—
Tony tries not to think too hard on how deeply he feels the veracity of this fact.
Pepper makes a pause. “And the other guy? From the park?”
“Now that you mention it.” Tony shuffles, changing his weight from one leg to another, crossing his arms in a thoughtful motion. “I didn’t see Strange use the Stone.”
He wants to ask FRIDAY where Pepper went.
Thor seems all too eager to lay the gauntlet mockup on top of a table, at full display of everyone, stepping back almost immediately to watch it from a bit further away. His eyes are trained on it like a cat would watch a dog, waiting for it to pounce. Some follow him more closely than the others, eyeing the Gauntlet with varying degrees of curiosity, hesitancy, and discomfort. They are still shuffling about when Bruce, Nebula and Rocket barge in, in quick strides – until they see the thing on the table and almost trip over one another.
, to explain he meant no harm, that this isn’t him ignoring their fears or their voice; This is him being forced to face the consequences of his choice of saving Bucky. And he would beg them to try and understand why he did it. Why he couldn’t let someone he loves to be treated like a monster, when he was just a victim. He thinks the world would understand.
It is a message from Ana Jarvis, Mr. Jarvis’ wife. It says:

Tony understands what she means about trust. Trust is something Tony doesn’t have much to spare to begin with, so – he understands. What she’s trying to say. She trusted him when he said it wouldn’t last, the thing with the suit – and that turned out not to be true. He promised to be more careful, and that wasn’t true, for a long while. He promised to stop, to step back and let someone else take the reins, and that didn’t happen either.  He promised signing the Accords would make it easier to step down, and then it didn’t – and then he promised no more surprises, and then he didn’t.

They are as silent as a cemetery, the sound of the turbines roaring in their ears, a constant stream of noise to accompany the loud pulsing of the blood in their veins, the feeling of palms sweaty and dirty with ash, beneath fingernails, sticking to the skin like a branding of sin. Tony had been using a helmet the entire time, but he feels like his lungs are scratching terribly every time he inhales. His mouth is dry. He has never felt so uncomfortable in his own skin, itching beneath the surface, a mixture of hot and cold of the most unpleasant kind and—
You see, he does think about it. He does, because he has no choice, and he can’t escape this anymore. T’Challa has gotten what he wanted.

“We have to find the survivors and take them somewhere safe.” Pepper says, hugging Tony closer, but calling all the attention in the room to herself. “The first thing is to bring people to a secure location and keep them together. We need to know where people are, and where other people can go if they can reach help. Checkpoints.”
But maybe not.
Bruce looks at Tony like he’s frustrated, like he’s pitying him, and like he’s worried, all at once, all of it woven in the lines on his forehead and the slight downward tilt of the corner of his lips, but ultimately, he exhales and averts his gaze, shifting into a problem-solving mindset easily, the easing into the science all too easy from years of habit ingrained into his soul.
clear that he has no intentions of contacting him for anything short of the end of the world, but still – Steve still thinks about it. About how he is doing.

“I don’t need you to be an Avenger.”
“Well, I don’t know about that, Mr. Stark, but maybe they can help you with those.” Agent Ross motions to the crowd behind them, somewhat to the left, where Tony imagines the R&D personnel might be hiding behind the mob of field agents.
Like he’s deciding if Steve is an enemy or a friend. Like he’s panicking, a little, and if he had the armor, Steve isn’t sure he wouldn’t have called it on instinct.
“But I can’t accept it. I have a suit, and it’s still in working condition. It might not be the best, but I can use it. I…” Steve pauses, breathing in deep. “I’d like to keep it. I can fix it. It’s more than enough.”

Steve… Steve can’t accept that very well. He knows it’s illogical, and he tells himself to stop it, because he has no right of feeling offended if Natasha has doubted him in any way when he told her Bucky is innocent. But it’s just a defensive reaction. After hearing over and over that his best friend is a murderer and a monster, being doubted by a

We are too many, with too many different pieces of information, and we’re gonna get lost if we don’t know what we’re working with. So we also need to know where he got them, when, and how.”
(This is the Black Widow you’re talking to, Captain.)
“Are you not?” Jarvis asks, not curiously, but dangerously, and the pause he’s given doesn’t feel comforting at all.
“No.” Wanda exhales, after barely a second of deliberation. “No, I can’t stay. We can’t stay there forever.”
And while we're here, let's take a peek inside Clint's mind as well. I feel like it's only fair - he is the one who plays a huge influence in Wanda's life after Pietro -, and I don't know about you, but even though MCU Clint is not the most interesting character to begin with, what bothers me the most about him is not that, but how contradictory he is in his decisions. You know, like the time he recruits the person who mind-whammied his entire team, after his speech of "do you know what is like to be undone?", when he was mind controlled a few movies back? Yeah, that kind of stuff. So let's address that as well, just for fun.
He hasn’t forgotten that Natasha signed it. But he had hoped— He had hoped she’d changed her mind when she left the US and came for him in the Raft. He thought she had finally understood. She saw what happened to Bucky,
“Is everything alright?” Thor inquires, tone incredibly delicate, and it’s terribly polite of him to ask, given how awful Tony knows he looks. It’s not even a question worth asking, at this point.
And he wonders if that’s not the case, and if it isn’t, what the hell exactly is that ring.
“Huh.”
When he does, and the world goes black, he immediately regrets it.
“Then you can stop questioning me if I say it’s fine and you can stay.”

It wouldn’t be wrong. Tony himself doesn’t know if there’s any way that he’ll come out alive of a second brawl with Thanos. He barely got out of the first one as it was, even if against his will.
If they separate, he won’t care. He won’t. If Barton leaves, and Natasha follows as she always has, and Rogers turns his back like he always does – Tony will not chase after them.

At the end of the day, Steve still believes that the safest hands are their own, and he is still willing to fight for that right. And it hurts, it cuts deep and makes him bleed, because even though his instinct is to push out his chest and say he will make the call and act on it even if the world tells him he’s wrong, the thought that immediately follows that one is the image of his shield, broken and bloodied, painted on a brick wall, the evidence of the fear he left behind along with the destruction his presence brought, everywhere he went.

Jarvis knows better than that. He knows a Nazi cannot be trusted, no matter the circumstances.

She stares him down, face tilted down but eyes wide, locked on Tony’s face like a laser aim, both wary and uncaring about his reaction to her words, and he feels completely shaken. It’s not meant to intimidate him, not quite; It’s… It’s the unnerving, unknown edge between desperately wanting support but not being willing to admit it, and the resolve to act even without it, but not wanting to do it alone all the same.

“You created them.”
He nods at her, still a little out of sorts, but Nebula, without breaking her strong gaze, nods back, and Tony gulps to halt any more frenzied words that try to leave his mouth, and forces them to sound calm as he speaks again.

Tony kind of wants to run his hand across it, but he doesn’t. The wood is woven between what seems to be two halves of the head of the weapon, bringing them together, and the back and the blade are both made of some shiny, silver, absolutely impeccable material, with elegant ridges and lines, and just a faint marking of something designed across the metal, like Thor’s hammer used to have on its sides and around the edges.

Not because he was Captain America, but because Rogers was – he was a stubborn asshole, a guy that refused to back down and be defeated, that would rather get himself killed in battle than let civilians be harmed. Tony had admired that. When that stubbornness clashed with his own and when Steve would give him that disappointed look or bicker about something; Tony had taken all of it in stride, because he’s a good sport, and despite what everyone thinks, Tony does listen to criticism.

– and that’s what drove him forward. He didn’t even hesitate. He didn’t think twice about it, he never does, because he assessed that the threat of five Winter Soldiers was bigger than anything else on their plate at the moment and that was all he cared about. He could deal with the consequences later, he thought. Later, when he had the time.

Steve wishes he could be angry about that, but he can’t.

Apparently, Cap is gonna be the leader of this little superhero gig they’ve got going on, which means he has to look good. Not that he doesn’t already, if Tony really has to admit, but the suit is… a bit of an eyesore. He doesn’t want to be mean about it, especially not when he realizes

Steve isn’t foolish enough to believe this to be a coincidence – after all, if there is one thing Natasha is very skilled at is hiding, as if she can make herself invisible any time she pleases, like a ghost. She has no trouble sneaking around and avoiding being spotted, even by someone with enhanced senses like Steve, so he knows better than believing she isn’t exactly where she intends to be, at all times, every time.

“Natasha did.”
Tony doesn’t know the answer to that himself. “As well as we can be.”
A beat passes, two, three – the air in the room settles, weighted by dread but frizzling with determination, with the impulse to right this wrong, to wipe away the sorrow that has drowned them.
“It still hasn’t rained.” Bruce also mentions. “When it does, the water will be contaminated. It’ll ruin the soil. It might even get people sick. We… We are living in a hostile planet now.

They look surprisingly resolute and steady, their bodies still tired and slumped wherever they sit, their formation still wobbly, but their eyes steely with resolve and determination; And it’s equally exhausting and refreshing to see, stirring heartstrings Tony hadn’t realized he still had left inside him, an old, rusty sense of familiarity, that he now feels he has no right to keep.

“No, Jarvis. Yes, Howard, of course it’s Tony.”

The Range gets shut down for a few days. Tony even says he’ll help with the maintenance, and they can upgrade the whole thing while he’s there. He doesn’t seem to be at all fazed by Fury’s lecture, smiling wide all the way through it, and though Steve’s ears burn a little with embarrassment, hiding his smile is surprisingly hard when Tony’s so damn happy, even if Fury stares him down with all the might of his one good eye.

Now, they’re scattered, and they bump into each other painfully at every single move, like ants scrambling beneath the hot laser of a magnifying glass.

So, he doesn’t think twice. He grabs his tools, he goes to his lab in the middle of the night, when no one else is going to be around for at least a couple of hours, and he gets to work.
“That night, at the Gala.” Steve says, as he steps impossibly close, hovering over Tony while he sits on the workbench. “I didn’t know you were listening.”

FRIDAY confirms, quietly, as if she is mourning that particular loss much more personally than she should.
That’s when Steve shows up. Of course. Steve always shows up when Tony is not ready – not ready to believe he’s alive, not ready to be in a team, not ready to fall in love. And Steve is always there, pushing his limits, not even knowing he’s doing it.

The sweep of the glowing ray of the regeneration machine feels like nothing at all on his wound. Bruce had to cut off his stitches, as carefully as he could, and the tug on his skin as he did so had more sensation to it than the direct action of Dr. Cho’s machine, just as she promised once. Bruce holds Tony down with a careful, merely mindful hand, to prevent him from slipping into an odd angle, and the machine works making almost no sound at all, gentle, and as Bruce watches it, with the soft blue glow of it illuminating his face, Tony watches Bruce.
, from the vacant look in her face, the stiff posture of her shoulders, that her night has not been as blissfully blank as his. Her gaze lost, her hand loosely wrapped around his, her long, delicate fingers sweeping soft caresses across his knuckles – it’s all distant, laced in muted unease, and it makes Tony’s chest hurt and his heart heavy, raw despair that Tony can recognize in a glance, and he wants to make it better, but he doesn’t know
that he does all those days by himself. Tony doesn’t actually know what he does, and he doesn’t feel like he can ask.
They regard him in careful silence, waiting patiently as Barton pushes off the wall and approaches in slow, almost sluggish steps, to join them in the line before the board. Rogers turns to him, with a curt nod, and when Barton nods back, even if his mouth is pressed in a tight, bitter line, Rogers asks:

Agent Carter raises her eyebrows after a long blink, but then an almost imperceptible smile pulls at the corner of her lips, and her eyes spark with an intense emotion; and with one final nod and parting thanks, she goes too, lingering for the briefest of seconds, throwing a glance in Rogers’ direction in a way that is not at all very subtle, a low sense of curiosity, but Rogers only nods at her and she accepts this, her hair wiping gracefully as she turns away, her strides large and sure as she walks towards Agent Ross.

The clues for the final conflict in the Infinity Saga had been floating around for a very, very long time. Often we forget how long, I think. The funny thing about scattering pieces across the road for someone else to find is that you can't forget those pieces will fit a whole when they're all found. A puzzle piece rarely serves a purpose if it doesn't add to the full picture - so the full picture should always be in your mind. Even if the puzzle takes a decade to come together. You still need it to fit, when the time comes.

The others seem shocked by his forcefulness. Maybe that’s why is so easy for them, even Rocket and Nebula, to readily comply, with silent nods and somber stares. Maybe it’s not only Tony that feels some shameful embarrassment, but he’s not the best person to judge – being chided by Rhodey is… It always hits him deep. And Tony gets it. He gets why Rhodey’s angry. He’s angry at himself too, angry at this childish resentment he’s helping create between them, in some ways. If Tony could get over himself and ignore whatever other issues he has with Rogers, Romanov, and Barton, maybe this would all be easier – but again, maybe it wouldn’t. It’s not a one-sided thing, that’s very clear now. Maybe they really couldn’t help it; But they’re on the same page now.

to believe Wanda could somehow show them visions of the future. Though the Chitauri had been long gone when the images where put inside his brain, the memory of Ebony Maw’s ship descending into New York like a reckoning is still fresh, and his fears of a future alien invasion were proven true.

Tony tried to stay away. From both of them. It worked with Harley, more or less. He gave the kid a workshop, he even gave him a new watch for his baby sister – and a phone, an email that could reach Tony’s personal server directly, everything to make sure that he would never have any troubles getting in contact directly with Tony in case he needed it.

He wonders if this is what will drive Natasha away.
(Does she know how it feels?)
“Yeah.” Tony says, if a little too aggressively. “And because of that, Rogers wouldn’t sign.”
“He and JARVIS had a conversation when he first came online. Before he attacked.”
“They did.” FRIDAY adds, and a profile for Erik Selvig is also added to the board in 2012, along with notes for the Chitauri army.

“Tell me what?”

Tony doesn’t know how long they stand there.
Nick looks at him like he’s tired of Tony’s bullshit, rolling his eye – funny how the eyepatch doesn’t diminish the strength of his unimpressed face, Tony’s sure he practices that face on the mirror –, lips pressed together in an almost grim expression, but when does he not look like that? Tony takes this as permission and designs an entire new set of suits and battle armor, of weapons and stealth equipment, for every single one of them.
(Do you even remember?)
But instead of outright saying, FRIDAY pulls up

Steve’s eyes narrow just a bit, and something teasing pulls at the edge of his smile, almost malicious. “That’s a little hard to believe, considering you were going to sneak out on me.”
, it might be something you're interested in!
And then it flickers in a burst of light, something quick and energized that Tony feels all the way down to the marrow of his bones, a pulse of energy running through every single spot of his body where a tracking chip of the suit is hidden underneath his skin – oh God, will it fry it all? –, the compartment whirs and glows – it’ll
As I've previously mentioned in the comments (let's be honest, yall know any CW fic is a controversial fic, if you haven't read the comments yet you eventually will, even if it's just to watch the drama unravel. I see you. You can't fool me), I don't consider the Sokovia Accords to be the actual problem that drove the Avengers apart. But of course they helped, so they should be discussed for the sake of this work. Once again, I'd like to remind everyone that despite all the talk that will occur about the legal repercussions of the Accords, the point is not actually to define if they are good or bad. Do I have an opinion about them? I do.

“I myself don’t know exactly what Stormbreaker is made of.” Thor admits. “It’s different from my hammer. Different magic. I had to hold the star open myself, so the metal would melt, but it’s possible other magical components had been added to it before we arrived.”
“I think it was a message from the Stones themselves.” Thor affirms, confidently.

Antonio wishes he knew his name. He’ll have to learn. He wants to. He wants to learn how it’ll taste in his mouth much like the Captain is licking into
so open and present, so gentle and caring. Steve thinks it’s probably insulting how jarring he finds it, but he does. It’s so overwhelming to see Natasha so unafraid of being soft, of being simply…

He could remind himself that Tony still attacked Bucky, that Tony still had gone behind their backs and made Ultron with Bruce, that he still kept Wanda inside the Compound against her will…
None of them are supposed to be here.
“Steve?”
Steve holds them back at the last minute, biting his tongue to keep them inside. He bites almost too hard, and he can taste the copper that floods his mouth when his teeth cut his right cheek.
