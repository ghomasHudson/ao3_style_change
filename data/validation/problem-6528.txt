Morgan’s dad: So, you would tell me if something went wrong? I know you hate to ask people for help because you think you can do it all on your own, but sometimes it's necessary.
Venom: Also, bring ice cream or any type of junk food. I feel like I deserve it today. I mean, I did find out my boyfriend was fucking around on me, and I made out with you a year ago and didn’t know. That would’ve been an appropriate time to tell me the truth.
“More than one incident involved enough coke to probably get charged with trafficking. The 90s were a bad decade for me."
Counselor Laura: That does not surprise me at all. I think I hear him and May yelling in the hallway right now. I also hear Simmons crying. I am also 99% sure she’s drunk right now. I would know.
Counselor Laura: We’re still in blackout mode due to the fact that I’m getting picked up a lot for questioning. If he doesn’t contact me, then I don’t have to lie. I only expect a message in an emergency right now.
“This framework is the same virtual reality thing that you and Stark have been working on?” She asked, not sure what else to say regarding his confession.
Red phone: That is now very permanent, moving on to other people permanent. Why did you think I decided to stay at the compound with an hour commute each day when I have to be at SI in person?
Also I think there’s like a 98% chance that Stefan found the ring hidden in the jumbo box of condoms. Really, I should’ve known better. Of course, even with the perfect immune system, Stefan would have a preference. Although he hasn’t said anything about it yet, so I shouldn’t panic right? Or should I panic because he hasn’t said anything? Or am I just overreacting to everything?
“More than once, but she's also done a picture of us at a wedding. So different pathways, and we will just have to get to the right one.”
Me: Tony’s anything but easy but it’s better being with somebody who knows me entirely. I think you said something similar when you were drunk.
We are on our way back to the Lighthouse after finishing the morning talk show circuit. Good news, I did not punch out Chuck Todd even though I really want it to. He’s only slightly more tolerable than Everhart. Some of the questions with Steve went a little bit over the line. Apparently, everybody wants him to become Captain America again, probably because they can’t handle Asian Captain America. They couldn’t handle a not White Cap the first time around either. Fuck them all.
Counselor Laura from 2023: It really is. I know you're worried, but this isn't like what happened with Ross. The Avengers here are taking excellent care of me. I have my own room at the compound with a hot tub.
Me: See for anybody else that would be a completely benign question. But for you your answer is either going to be a not brainwashed Bucky or an alive and no longer suffering from dementia Peggy.
My heart dropped to my stomach when Sharon told me what happened. Just the thought of losing you makes me sick. I don’t want to be without you. I’m not sure I can survive without you. I can’t even go a week without talking to you.
Me: Furious, especially because I don’t know what he was doing. I could’ve helped him out if I knew.
P Parker: It wasn’t like that. The room was too hot, and we were just sleeping. Flash broke up with his boyfriend yesterday because he’s a prick. The Princess is here as well as Fitzsimmons and FitzHunter. Along with a bunch of other agents and Wakanda security force members. I promise we are adequately supervised.
Me: Of course I’m talking about Agent Scary. Making out with somebody once post funeral does not count as a relationship.
Me: Excellent point. Feel free to FedEx me some of your artwork, especially anything with you naked, surrounded by rose petals.
The Mechanic: She is his handler or super power kid case worker. She also legally can’t say anything to you, unless TMNS is a danger to himself or others.
Also, this chapter may push the T rating because Tony has a dirty mouth, but it’s only a couple of lines, so I’m keeping the rating as is for now.
Friday: They were already in love with each other before they began speaking to one another per my analysis of the messages.
“Note to self, incorporate something like that in my wedding vows to you,” Tony joked, Steve thought.
Morgan’s dad: Widow already tried and got nothing. Although they did eat half of Hunter's cookies. I could really use one of those cookies right now.
“The military is not going to come through that door to pick me up?” Steve was only half joking. Maybe that was the plan. He really didn’t know these two agents that well. Although, they were on  Melinda’s team so he was inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt.
Although, Tony doesn't remember specifically telling Steve not to tell his friends that. Also, that conversation did happen electronically, so the Princess probably read it.
Freakingcool dot com is the name of the fanfiction site that Kamala a.k.a. Ms. Marvel wrote Avengers fanfiction on in the Marvel Comics universe. I decided that the MCU must have its own version of the site.
Blue phone: My mom's favorite color was lavender. She always looked best in purple, but it was an expensive color back then. So she only had a few things. It's just every time I see the color I think of her and it gives me a warm feeling inside.
Person that cares about my boss: Of course he did. I am starting to believe that he really is in love with me or at least has a crush on me because of his jealous behavior.
HSBF: I'm glad Pepper was there. Have you talked to her since getting back? Is it safe for me to send her a thank you note or would she burn it on principle?
Anthony: I know we need to talk more about our Bucky issues, but I feel like you have to work out a lot of that stuff yourself. I’m beginning to realize that you didn’t save Bucky for his sake, but maybe for your own. I think you should see a therapist.
Genius Princess: First, I’m not working with any dangerous chemicals. I learned that lesson when I was 12.
“I’m glad the principal let you see Kamala,” Tony said as Steve slid back into the passenger seat of the car. Tony opted not to go in because even though he’s been more of a recluse for the last five years, he could still cause a bit of a scene at a gifted kid school. Even if Brooklyn Academy was less science-focused than Midtown. Kamala has been trying to get him to be a guest speaker since freshman year, but he keeps turning her down. Maybe he should reconsider that.
Venom: I’ll give you a massage when you come. That usually helps. What the hell were you talking about in that meeting? Are aliens coming again?
Tony: So, Radcliffe really invited us over early for non-alcoholic pre-match drinks so he could show me and Dr. Monkey Lover his illegal LMD and probably get us to work out all the kinks. I’m so glad Monkey Lover was late because my James decided to send Dr. Simmons off on a mission and he just had to see her off. It’s best that only one of us had to deal with this ethical dilemma.
"I forgot you were still frozen when Obadiah successfully used my mental issues to get me out of my own company after he had me kidnapped, which was responsible for most of my issues in the first place. Board members Asshole, Prick, and Dick are essentially threatening to lock me out of my company the same way. Because murder bots and superhero throw downs in Germany they can deal with, but a new boyfriend is apparently a bridge too far.”
“I can see her point. You are loyal to the people you love. I had the bruises to prove it.” Tony joked. And apparently, it was a bad joke because he could see Steve’s eyes darken.
Nomad: You really believed that Howard hated you? Why, because you couldn’t live up to some arbitrary unreal standard? Because nobody could be everything Captain America stands for, not even me. He wasn’t real. At best, he was an exaggeration of the truth.
“Agent Agent and his team dealt with the end of the world just last May while we had our heads up our asses. Which means it probably will happen again next May and probably the next May or possibly April after that because apparently April/May is apocalypse season. It’s why I’m working on a wearable suit. Thanks to help from the princess and Monkey Lover, I might have one ready by Thanksgiving instead of Valentine’s Day.”
Anthony: It’s a little fuzzy. I believe the incident involved a stripper, some drugs that may or may not be illegal, and a superior officers’ car being covered in whip cream and reprogramming the horn to play Everybody whenever he sat down in the driver’s seat. I don’t remember all the details because I may have taken a few of those drugs that may or may not have been legal.
"I love Agent so much. He is just the best. When he’s not fanboying over you or lying to us about being dead. Of course, now he’s probably going to glare at you for screwing his whatever they are, but I’m sure he’ll eventually get over it."
Football Hunter: You mean when you cased his apartment. Using going to the men’s room as an excuse? I taught you so well. You were such a sweet innocent thing when I found you.
The mechanic: I wanted to at least wait a year until the wedding anyway because I’m not stealing Simmons’ thunder.
Warning: There are references to Captain Marvel, Ragnarok, and Endgame in here. There’s small but still here. Also, major references to Infinity War. It’s all connected.
Tony: Now that answer you can give publicly although some people may think you’re a gold digger so maybe we’ll have to phrase it differently.
"You’re right. Rhodey should not have to put up with that. Friday, sweetheart, please make sure that my BFF receives a box of the good chocolates. Maybe put on the card, ‘Sorry, I’m forcing you to deal with crazy bureaucrats/admirals that don’t know what they’re doing’. Maybe throw in some cupcakes as well."
“Steve mentioned asking Kamala if she would be willing to stay here over the weekend and on nights to help you with the kids. Are you open to that?” Tony asked.
Me: And you won’t let me call you Captain Tight Pants anymore which is sad. Although, I do love calling you cuddle bunny. And let me just say how happy I am you acknowledge that.
Red phone: The thing is, in the real world, I don’t think there’s one magic ingredient to add to make things good again. It took me a long time to realize that. I thought the accords would help and I was wrong. Letting her have Kevin and dividing up duties to keep the company running with minimal contact seems like the easiest solution.
Me: Then you add in the fact that there was this asshole playing head games to break up the Avengers because my idea to bring about world peace ended up killing his family and you get super complicated.
Counselor Laura: Hey, we are doing another all-hands meeting tonight. Steve is making turtle brownies, and I’m ordering pizza. Tell me what toppings you want.
Girl Friday:  Since you’re busy on another mission, we are going to start research and figure out what not to do. I want to thank my other self for sending us all the records, except for the part where I lost consciousness. I really am getting the full-blown human experience. Some of it feels overrated.
Tony Potts: He’s engaged to the less asshole version of Stevie bear. Also, apparently, he is the director of Shield's replacement organization. He also has three kids. Busy seems like an understatement.
Blue phone: Melinda definitely fell in the FWB category. I respected her, but she was really sad and lonely and kept everyone at arm’s length. She left the military after a mission gone badly for a civilian job in HR, her marriage fell apart because of it, and her best friend died on a mission right before I moved in. Actually he died during the battle of New York.
May: Clint and Natasha are working on the list. We got the coordinates from Nebula this morning regarding several stones. That arrived just before I left. We are debating whether we should go to Norway now or wait until after the meeting to get specifics from Thor regarding the Tesseract.
However, right as Laura pressed the send button, she saw a flash of light and felt as if her whole body shrinking. Moments later, it was over, and she found herself in the lab section of the Avenger compound. Except it didn’t look like the lab space now. One, there were nowhere near as many teenage friendly science experiments. The kids had their own space.
“You didn’t know how time travel actually worked. You thought you were just earlier in the timeline.” Hunter placed a reassuring arm around Leo, pulling him closer to him.
Pepper pot: You've been on the metaphorical couch since before Morgan was born. It's why we have separate houses and bedrooms. I’m not stupid, Tony.
Counselor Laura: Friday? I have one more question for you. What is this decimation that you keep referring to?
:  Elena Rodriguez Shield agent and member of the UN Avengers. Colombian national seeking asylum in the United States. Former assistant to Tony Stark, now working for Stark Industries as a security consultant as part of her cover identity.
“No, it didn’t. I love Pepper. A part of me will always love Pepper, but we are not right for each other. I’m willing and able to acknowledge that now to myself, but I wasn’t quite ready until this weekend to tell Happy that Pepper and I are never ever getting back together because I fell in love with you. Not Captain America, but Steve from Brooklyn."
“Well you keep getting hurt trying to save the world and your boyfriend doesn’t like that. Also with Wanda leaving to start a new life with Vision and Clint back with his kids, I heard you need a third for your secret Avengers.”
Red phone: It’s the story of my life. People like what I can give them. They love the tech I create, but they don’t necessarily like me.
“But here we are. We have a couple more days before the letter has to go to Wakanda. You can come back to it in the morning.”
Tony: Still the plan because we can’t come up with anything better. Although Jane from PR wants us to do a joint interview with the New York Times where we ask each other the 36 questions that lead to love.
Blue phone: Please stop antagonizing people who probably already want to kill you. Wait, you didn’t actually say that to anyone at the DOD?
I originally had all the emails from both of Tony’s accounts in one chapter but it got way too long and I decided to split it up between his two accounts.
Me: It’s Agent May, but I already have one May in my life. Although, Queens’s aunt is equally terrifying.
Anthony: I am allowed to do Stark Industries' business and some of the weapons being sold were either retrofitted or counterfeit Stark Industries weapons. We don’t like being associated with xenophobic terrorist organizations.
We are doing something a little different; it’s time for an email chapter. There will be a few sprinkled throughout the series.
Anthony: Because there's months’ worth of content there. Dr. Fitz and Dr. Simmons are kind of obsessed with the show. The next time I am forced to be at the Playground, I'll ask them to make you a starter list. If I stay well behaved, it will probably be a while before I get back there. Unless Senator Hateful has another mood swing.
Steve: That makes sense. May retained a whole lot of knowledge about Hydra operations because of her time in the framework herself. It’s been useful to her now.
Me: Any halfway competent medical examiner can tell the difference between a neck breaking because of the impact of a vehicle and the neck breaking because someone snapped it.
Tony Potts: Exactly. We can even get some reinforcements. Nebula and Rocket may come to join us. Also, if things work with Simmons, maybe you can go to Norway for an intervention. Storm Breaker would be good to have.
Red phone: So much that she signed emergency custody papers naming me of all people, temporary guardian of the kids if something happens. She’s been picked up a few times for questioning. So it’s a concern and those kids cannot end up in state custody. It’s too dangerous.
Boss: When you’re done relocating my therapist, can you find out everything you can on Cuddle Bunny’s post defrosting hookups. Who knows if Hydra or someone else set up a honey trap for him.
The Mechanic: Yes. And I’m starting to question that decision, especially after the last assassination attempt. However, I was dragged out of the other closet by a sex tape and an asshole ex-boyfriend who is still deep in the closet, pandering to the family values crowd.
“That’s good, though. Not that he still in treatment, but that they might have something available.”
Anthony: I may never be able to sit down for a slice of pizza with your BFF, but maybe I can start making peace with things. Bitterness is not productive.
Me: Did he figure it out just like I did? Or like Liz’s dad? That was in the real version of the Agent Agent report.
“Are you ever going to tell Steve that I was able to read all his rough drafts as he was writing them?” James asked as he activated the tablet to read.
Me: I’m touched. You’re the best text message boyfriend ever. Actually, I think you’re the best boyfriend I’ve ever had and you’re not actually my boyfriend. My love life is sad.
Nomad: Apparently you were having a torrid affair with Natasha and that’s why she sided with you during the accords.
Tony: Me too, but every time somebody tries to argue that the Gay thing is new or I’ve been hiding in the closet for decades, I just bring up the sex tape. I mean it’s not my fault that they are bi-phobic.
Anthony: Look, now they're bringing in your biggest mistake to psychoanalyze me in. Apparently, I am a narcissistic unstable megalomaniac who should be locked up.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous. Here is your first chapter of 2019.
“That’s good, although you could’ve waited until after the wedding to tell me,” Steve whispered to Tony. “Or actually tell me, I’m sitting next to you.”
Blue phone: There’s nothing you can do to make the irrational less afraid, including putting a leash on yourself. It just makes it easier for them to find you.
Me: No, because nothing I say is going to bring her son back. Making a scholarship in his name is just a slap in the face. So, it’s best to just keep my distance.
Red phone: I’ll make an appointment with the lawyers when I get back to New York. But I’m not really in a hurry to get back.
Avenger Friday: They renewed their acquaintance after Agent Coulson died in May 2018 post decimation. They married six months later so that Agent Melinda May-Rogers could get custody of a young inhuman girl named Kamala Khan, in addition to being able to keep Robin. Kamala was the cousin of a Shield agent who also disappeared during the decimation along with the rest of his family.
Anthony: I knew that they were going to do this. It’s why I put off putting out the press release for so long. It definitely makes drinking tempting.
So does anyone want to guess how many more conversations will occur before Steve realizes that Tony has a crush on him?
Cuddle Bunny: That’s problematic. Do either actually have any military or law enforcement experience whatsoever?
So let’s dive in and work on our emotional intimacy and not think of this as us trying to figure out how to appease my very angry PA person. I think it will go better that way.
Tosha: So, you never actually talked to Deke when you were conspiring? Also, it’s May and Simmons that were arguing about said conspiracy. Also, May tried to take the bottle of not actually water from Simmons.  Apparently, it was never about getting the stones only about getting Fitz to her. I assume that she convinced you to go along with it because she promised you Laura.
Friday: Ana 2018 transmitted Deke Fitzsimmons’ report on how he ended up in 2018. A copy has been sent to your Stark pad for your review. I think you will find it illuminating.
Loki also knows that I have a communications device. More importantly, he knows I have someone that can create portals. Apparently, he knows all about Robbie. I wonder if the Rider would kill Loki on sight. I'm not as sure about that as I used to be. Maybe people do change.
Me: This all went down while you were rescuing the troops. Actually, you probably were able to rescue the troops because all this went down. At least, that’s what Agent Scary implied.
“I think I'm using cuddle bunny currently. Although you haven't texted me since I changed it last. I may change it again. My point is there's no reason for me to pretend I'm not sexually attracted to you. You’re either aware or ridiculously oblivious.”
Girl Friday: okay, Ana has confirmed that you’re not on base anymore due to May dragging you out of bed with just a little more than an hour of sleep. Apparently, you’re on a mission, which means she can’t tell me where you are. [Six pouting face emojis]
“I know that now. But I think if I died on that ship, my regret would be not working things out. And I got a second chance. Then I wasted five years not working on this with you.” Tony sounded regretful.
Venom: Well, Benji was planning to make a move on you during our European trip, so it doesn't matter.
Yes, I’m in therapy. I don’t get to see her as much as I probably need to, but I think it’s helping. The nightmares are becoming less frequent. I haven’t had one in the last week, although that may be because the boyfriend is visiting. He has a tendency to keep the bad dreams away. At least when he’s not starring in the dreams. But that’s a whole different set of issues. I’m working on that as well.
Me: I don’t know because everything I went through gave me character. It made me a better person in the long run.
Cuddle fiancé: First, when would I have time? Second, I felt like it’s more your place to explain. Also, I don’t know all the details because you were rambling and going off on tangents during the meeting yesterday. Your email was worse. I just now found out about the hammer thing. On its own, it is concerning.
I do wonder if I should design something to control when she sees the vision instead of blocking it all together. Dr. Leopold says we do not need these visions to change the future, he already has seen the future. I believe that the future has changed too much for what he saw to come to pass. But I feel that there is a threat upon the horizon that we need her for if we are to survive it.
Red phone: I still haven’t figured out everything that actually happened with that “satellite” explosion that took out half of the Galileo system and Veronica.
Me: Yes, because until Agent Scary agrees to take up the shield, there is no Captain America. I am working on her taking the shield. I think her new codenames should be Agent America. What do you think?
Red phone: Cuddle bunny, you’ll be happy to know, I got out of the Pentagon without getting arrested.
Counselor Laura from 2023: I don’t know. I think it might make things worse because he chose to stay and is married to Hunter. He argues otherwise, but we all know better.
“Also, blood tests have shown that you don’t have any of the genetic markers associated with cloning. In addition, you are slightly genetically different than the Leo Fitz that originated from this timeline. But close enough that we do not believe that you are a Hydra agent wearing a nano mask. So therefore we are willing to entertain the possibility that you are from a different timeline.”
DILF: When Scott showed up last week, I thought maybe just maybe we could give her and her big sister a better future. Do you have any idea how many times I have held Kamala as she cried about missing her parents and her brother? They deserve better and so does Morgan.
“I was close with my mom. We had to be. We couldn’t survive as long as we did otherwise. However, sometimes I wish she would’ve told me the truth instead of lying to me.” Steve confessed.
Counselor Laura: Was it? The new Shield is not the old Shield, but it could become like the old Shield now that they’re back under government control. Especially if good people with backbones are not put in charge.
Warning: Tony’s dirty mouth. Let me know if you think he’s starting to push us into M territory. I’m sure he’ll get us there eventually, especially if he ever successfully convinces Steve to try any branch of telecommunications sex. I am now accepting bets on if Tony will succeed at accomplishing that.
“Why are you still in the room?” Tony turned around blinking and slightly annoyed because he wasn’t unfastening Steve’s pants anymore. “Dr. Simmons totally gave me the green light this time to ravage my boyfriend.” He has even moved up to moderate sexual activity, as of the last check up.
Blue phone: Yes, but because of things being what they were, we decided that we were better off as friends, actual friends. He went into the Navy and I went into the Army. Then I met Peggy and I ended up frozen in the ocean, so it didn’t matter. He died in March 2012 about a week before I came back. Also, of lung cancer.
Football Hunter: So maybe you’ll save the world after all from that purple raisin with a glove fetish that baby bird keeps drawing.
“I was told pointblank to not say anything about Bucky being deprogrammed via any type of electronic communication. It’s almost like she’s testing me. I really, really want to get laid in Mumbai so I’m not to do anything that may accidentally lead the military to invade another country to get Steve’s BFF back.”
May: Laura has. We talked about it this morning. She and I are on our way to pick up someone who might help us. At a minimum, she will help us with our rehab project. We are also calling Rio in. Who apparently took over the Jarvis foundation’s relief efforts in Puerto Rico in the other timeline. Because of her, it wasn’t a shit show like here.
“Unfortunately, I was too angry to hear your words. I’m sorry I came into our relationship with too many misconceptions and wasn’t willing to hear what you needed to say. Especially in Siberia. That was half the problem.” Tony acknowledged.
“It’s better that you don’t remember that shit,” Tony said, squeezing Steve’s hand again. He almost wanted to reach over and hugged the man.
The new consultant: Close enough. That’s essentially Afia. The state of New York won’t allow Tony to adopt, so his AI Friday decided to take things into her own hands with the help of the Princess. They used science to create a person, a child for Tony to raise.
I know about the proprietor of Alias. She may actually be a good choice for this. Just make sure you use the Tony C petty cash fund with the usual protocol.
“Of course sir. Would you also like me to add reminders about the time difference before you send correspondence to anyone?”
Counselor Laura: Good news after the awkwardness of two days ago, Steve and Tony managed to have lunch together yesterday. Better yet, they came up with an idea to keep half of my reality from going poof and help your reality undo the damage of the purple one here.
“My nanny is on family leave. I understand.” Too well, really. She’s just thankful Tony has committed to staying clean, unlike her own mother.
Me: The new head of PR is going to have his work cut out for him. Although, I do like the new ATCU uniforms. Very patriotic. Apparently, the Shield agents are the best division of the agency. At least according to twitter.
“She had former Agent Barton knock out her ex-boyfriend to keep him from getting detained by the US government after his boyfriend was nearly killed by sunflower oil. She’ll understand. That book is dangerous and anybody who reads it will have to be taken out. I know what happened last time. Radcliffe looked at it for a second and he ended up kidnapping May after replacing her body with an LMD duplicate, made a deal with the Watchdogs, and then he kidnapped all of us to hand the agency over on a silver platter to a man who wants to kill all Inhumans and has a personal vendetta against Coulson.” Leo explained.
Anthony: Which was absolute bullshit. I’d already had my first kidnapping by that point. It would’ve been nice to know that people were after me because my daddy was a spy that people wanted dead and not because of being heir to the Stark Empire
I really hate my job. Especially because things are going on that I don’t know about. Half the people here are ridiculously incompetent. Jimmy is either an idiot and doesn’t realize half of what's going on, or he’s kind of in love with Scott and ignoring the obvious. I’m trying to decide if I ship it. Regardless, I’m probably going to be spending some quality time at Scott’s place.
“They say the third times the charm. The Senator killed him, the first time around. I killed him the second,” Leo confessed.
Me: This is the problem. The accords are dependent on people not being awful being in charge but you never know who you’re going to get.
Purple Arrow: It’s not about that. You don’t know what I’ve done these last five years. I’m not a good person. I’ve never really been a good person, but now there’s too much blood to even pretend.
Morgan’s dad: Possibly. On the one hand, she's incredibly good at getting you to talk about things that you may not otherwise talk about.
"I do too, but we’ll see each other soon. Mumbai for the wedding in a few weeks and then Malta for Christmas. It won’t be as bad as last time."
This is a timeline this story is using. I am working off the assumption that the battle of New York happen no earlier than late 2011. The events of the agents of shield season three finale/Civil War happened late April early May 2016. Tony and Steve start speaking to each other again in May 2016. Certain early events from Spider-Man: Homecoming occurred in August before school started. In this universe, everything else takes place in September 2016.
Me: Because Ross is an asshole and Thor knows the idiot only managed to get confirmation because the only qualification was not being Hydra.
Me: Okay before I leave for my LMD burning, should I bring the Princess to the playground or the upstate facility?
Me: It’s probably better if he hears it from you then an intelligence report from your host country. Tony kept it from the news, but I know the hubby has a new job using his special skills for you know who.
Me: Really don’t call her that. She hates that name as much as the other one which is why her new designate is Agent America.
Me: Very serious. They are spending Thanksgiving in Malibu together right now. Although, not engagement ring serious just yet.
I’m certain you are aware that this position will be requiring you to relocate to the upstate facility, but I think that might be why you want to take this position in the first place. You will be given a small apartment on the Avenger campus. We can even arrange for your son to go to one of the private schools in the area or I can arrange for a tutor. Both will be covered by SI. I’m personally leaning towards tutor because at least that way we won’t have to come out with lies to keep your baby out of gym class or recess.
Purple arrow: Hey Ana, you have a list of everybody who was lost during the decimation in the other timeline in your data bank, right?
Morgan’s dad: That might be another reason why he is now in an alternate timeline 2018 instead of our 2018.
Nomad: You're the guy who cares. You’re the guy who sees things 10 steps ahead. You’re the one who is looking at the big picture.
BITC: I owe you 20 bucks. You were right about Flash not being that heterosexual. I bet you already know that you were right. Actually, since Flash is your best friend, you probably knew the truth when you made that bet. Which is so unfair.
CoulsonPJ: I didn’t think I meant that much to him. He went back to Laura once she got cleaned and successfully stayed that way for a while. Never date somebody who’s just legally separated from his wife.
Tony: Which would be a relief to Hunter. I’m sure Hunter would prefer hunting Hydra again to more than 48 continuous hours with the kids by himself.
Me: Ridiculously good time. It is so much better to be around people I actually like and not the Board of Directors.
They tell you to never meet your heroes because they might just end up disappointing you. I can tell you from personal experience that is true. The people that we idolize are not who we really idolize. They are mere mortals who make mistakes and screw up a lot. They’re not heroes because they’re perfect. Maybe they’re heroes because they keep trying.
“Someone that will always have my back. You offering to create a computer virus to keep people from looking at that picture I accidentally posted to Instagram tells me you do have my back. I appreciate that. Even if I don’t want you to do anything that would get you in trouble with the Accords.”
"No. He won’t come looking for you. He just said to try not to cross his path and keep your head down. Ross still wants his trophy back and Talbot will not give him the satisfaction.” He’s not even surprised they see him as a thing instead of as a person. Tony warned him.
“Two days ago, Dr. Strange asked me if I wanted to go back, and I said no. I wanted to stay here with you. I love you.” The words were punctuated with yet another kiss.
MJ: I feel like that is an Ana question even if this is my independent study period. Don’t you have the AI on your work phone?
Tony: Same fears here. Although, the fact that you’re not asking me what the shocked was makes me feel like you already know, especially because you chatted with the ex-girlfriend.
Red spider: You will not listen to me if I tell you that your presence would not have made a difference?
BITC: That is a very obvious point. Because of my overprotective mom, I’m stuck here doing nothing. Trust me, I would rather be helping you guys than thinking about Flash and Benji dating.
Venom: I knew that we’re friends, but I didn’t realize that’s how [redacted] figured out the truth. That’s a lot.
Love: Good. I think someone can seriously benefit from an antidepressant patch. Oh, who am I kidding? We’re going to have to shoot him again with tranquilizers.
Venom: I shouldn’t even be surprised that Spidey’s BFF came up with that name. Also, apparently, somebody is switching to the new last name early.
Yo-Yo was killed by Thanos during the fight. I’m trying to find out if others died during the battle, but again Friday’s not allowed to tell me anything, and no one else is talking. I overheard this little tidbit.
“I’m abstaining because anything can be a slippery slope for me,” and this whole entire mess with that other timeline has been making him crave a drink for a while. “However, one of the good things about the snap is they decriminalized marijuana. I’ll get you a breakup starter kit.” Tony said seriously.
I do realize that I probably said some things that I shouldn’t have. Sorry about the crying. I went full Howard which is something I don’t want to do. I try not to be my father because he was a bit of a dick. I am still mad at him for sending me to boarding school, or more accurately, not telling me he was sending me to boarding school because my good mother figure got sniped because of him. I have lots of issues. Basically, I spent most of my childhood being compared to Captain America and that was well before I became a member of the superhero club.
Me: Dr. Suarez is more like a contractor or consultant. She was friends with your ex-girlfriend’s now deceased ex-husband, a.k.a. the former top Shield psychologist Dr. Andrew Garner. Dr. Suarez is currently filling in as a favor until they can get someone permanent.
StarkAE: Understandable considering I kind of want to punch him. Also for somebody who wants the world to think that he’s still dead you're doing an awful job at it. There are at least three shots of you at the crime scene. I’m still not used to you in something other than a three-piece suit.
Tony: When it comes to you, the first thing that comes to mind is that old Prince song, ‘I would die for you’. That is definitely the Steve Rogers version of friendship. Loyal to the end. Are you familiar with that song? Or is this one of those times where you have no idea what I’m talking about?
Help needed: Due to a wonderful offer from Misaky0 there will be illustrations for upcoming chapters. However, I never uploaded images to A3O before. If anyone has and is willing to walk me through it. That would be wonderful.
“I thought I had my wife back. I should have known better. There’s no hope in this world.” That’s when Natasha wrapped an arm around him.
May: You’ll have to tell her what we’re trying to do. There’s a reason why Rio is our default for medical care.
Nomad: Yes, and you just had to break into the Shield servers. This was already in the mail by that time.
Cuddle fiancé: I’m aware. After New York, Hydra recovered an alien communications device and contacted a consortium that referred to itself as the Confederacy.
“That is a great idea.” Because he doesn’t want to accidentally crush the car if there’s another strange revelation.
“I knew even though you’re looking at engagement rings, you’re still upset about that.” Hunter grins.
Hunter: Acknowledgment is the first step. I will help you get to where you want to go. I’ll be there in 20 minutes, with your cheese fries.
Anthony: But at least promise me you’ll think about seeing someone. You can’t blame yourself for everything
The mechanic: And just so you know, I consider Jarvis more my father than Howard. Blood is not everything. So I’m happy to be a good mentor to both of you. At least I haven’t traumatized either of you, yet.
Red phone: I am completely willing to play ball with the State Department itself. Ross’ advisor for Enhance Persons Affairs is competent and doesn’t want to turn people with powers into weapons of the state.
Nomad: Because I want the first time we do anything together to be in person. I don’t want to just imagine what kissing you would be like, I want to know how your tongue feels against mine. I want to know what you taste like before I fantasize about it. I want to know what your hand feels like against my skin before you talk me into getting off.
I just want to let all of you know that I will be on vacation and then moving over the course of the next three weeks. I have banked a few chapters (and some artwork that will probably drop Monday) so there will be some updates during this time, but I’m not sure when I will be able to post. I probably will not be responding to very many reviews after this weekend either until things calm down again.
Iron Dad: The minion was involved as well, which is never a good sign, and they don’t even know about Thanos.
Purple arrow: This is true, although MJ is probably going to be dating a superhero soon. So, she should learn the hazards of that now.
Sparrow is Tony’s nickname for Robin Huntington. She is a young human girl who sees the future and draws about it. Someone who can see the future. That might prove useful.
“They didn’t go from fighting to making out on the couch. The future Stark-Rogers had a lot of shit to get through, and they did it together because maybe they realized the world needed them on speaking terms. At some point, my Tony and Steve realized that a lot of the choices they made were because they were in love with one another, and both were too stubborn to acknowledge it.” Steve’s blush told her she hit the nail right on the head.
Melinda: How would you feel about a new teammate that kills evil people and only evil people? He’s useful, but the organization is in a probationary period.
Avenger Friday: No, they did not until a dying Coulson contacted Tony shortly before the decimation. Tony and Steve were never engaged or even dated for that matter. Tony was engaged to Ms. Potts at the time of the decimation. Although they have yet to have the ceremony, they live in Pennsylvania with their four-year-old daughter Morgan. Technically his last name is now Potts-Stark but I prefer to still call him Mr. Stark.  I can only describe Steve and Tony’s relationship as complicated. However, their children enjoy regular play dates despite their age differences.
Steve is going to try something different with the next few questions because this is taking forever. The timestamp in this chapter will be from Steve’s perspective.
Tony: Hey, Pepper Pot. So you should probably know it’s time to break out that other in case of an emergency press release. Steve decided to let me put a ring on it.
“Part of me doesn’t believe you. Were there any French boys?” Tony asked, raising one eyebrow. It worked.
I might get to talk to her again at 2 PM. Ana suggested that I make a video since the other Avengers will have important things to discuss with Mom. Also, this way, Nikki can say hi. He really misses his mom--divorce sucks. They say this is just a separation, but I know better. I know the end is coming.
Me: I don’t even think most people know mom‘s maiden name. Or how paranoid Howard was. Or the fact that that was the name I used when I was at smart kid boarding school and MIT.
Tony: After discussing what will probably happen to the senator arrested for treason, kidnapping and torture that refuses to resign, we talked about renegotiating the Accords. As well as the need for creating a version that protects the rights of people with powers and keeps the government from merely seeing them as weapons. No more throwing people in the Raft because they won’t use their powers like the U.S. government wants them to, when they’re not being a risk to themselves or others. He is on board with the modifications.
The new consultant: Hey, we just got here. We brought food. Just me and the Princess. Even Her Highness couldn't talk Ned's mom into letting him come back here.
Me: I thought Yo-Yo and Happy would be able keep them preoccupied for the evening while you and I have grown up fun time. However, Connor needs homework help because he is expected to know something that they didn’t cover at his school in Iowa last year. Since it’s kind of my fault that he is starting a new school in Manhattan this year, I should probably help until I line up a tutor.
“At least she got a lot of vitamin C and calcium. Robin went through that phase. Heaven help you if you accidentally get the wrong cheese stick.” Steve added.
What is the name of the doctor you’re seeing? I want to do a background check to make sure he or she is actually qualified. Okay really, I just want to make sure he or she is not a serial killer.
So, apparently, I made you cry. I didn’t want to do that. I just wanted you to realize how serious things were. Being a superhero is not a video game. You don’t get extra lives usually. Sorry I used one of my father’s techniques to express how dangerous the situation really was. You’ll be happy to know that your aunt threatened to kill me. Don’t worry. I deleted the message from every server known to mankind and put a fake one in its place. (And Friday will be deleting this part of the email after you read it). I told your aunt that there was a lab accident that you were responsible for and that’s why you came home in the Free Quake T-shirt. Please corroborate.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fabulous. Oddly enough, this was the second conversation I drafted for this story. However, I realized we needed to go through a bit before we get to Tony Potts and Mr. May-Rogers having a text message heart-to-heart.
Anthony: I don’t know if I’m more shocked to see you use the word ‘fuck” or “internalized homophobia” in a sentence. I assume this guy was Jonathan from Freddy’s?
Tony: No going out with friends without a preapproved chaperone, no staying out late, no unsupervised patrolling, and no saving the world from the bad guys unless aliens are invading again.
I’m sorry about the message from yesterday. I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just upset that Tony and I still can’t really talk to each other. Our schedules are not making it any better. I was about to cancel today’s lunch because of an emergency visit to our cell phone factory in China when Friday informed me that Tony had a last-minute meeting with Rhodey because of an incident last night. Maybe it really fell apart because neither one of us had time for the other and not just because he fell in love with you.
Me: I get it. I only believe that it’s him because I know how he came back from the dead and I still did a DNA scan.
Me: Actually, all the kids miss him, especially Connor. He was being an extra brat to Laura. Teenagers. They almost make me glad I’m sterile.
Football Hunter: You didn’t run into her younger self at the doctor’s house? See this is why I did not want you to switch places with baby brother.
“No. I am supposed to be your dad. That means you listen to me and we’re going to talk about boundaries.” Steve couldn’t help but start giggling at Tony’s words. He was kind of adorable being a dad.
MayMQ: Establishing Stefan’s identity is a good idea. I’m just not sure if this is the venue it should happen in, but it was Steve’s idea.
The boss: I suggest you hit Pepper’s chocolate stash instead. I know she still has a lot of the good German stuff. You need to be able to drive.
Me: I wrote to him before hand and that helped things not turn into a shouting match. Okay there was shouting, but no throwing things.
Red phone: Actually, Skye-quake_23, my now former ATCU contact, did just that because apparently it’s my fault that her boyfriend died last month. Not that she’ll explain why.
Me: That probably needs to be looked into. However, who’s going to be supervising Benjamin once she’s in California?
So, if I can rebuild my relationship with Steve (still a work in progress) after the cluster fuck that was Siberia, then maybe there's hope for us.
Me: Still breathing, although it was a near thing when I told Sean about taking a 15-year-old to Germany without the complete consent of his guardian.
SimmonsJA: If you really were emotionally ready to have sex with Stefan, you wouldn’t need me or Dr. Suarez to give you the okay. You would have ignored our recommendation entirely. But you need us to give you the metaphorical green light because deep down inside you know that you’re not ready for this.
Me: The heroes always have bad publicity. The villains get the best publicists. Although, Jane is doing an excellent job recently.
"They were making it out to be worse than what it really was on the news." That’s when he heard Tony walk into the room.
This chapter takes place about four days after the last one and the reason why it’s been so long will be explained in the chapter.
Tony: No, because a lot of that is just complete bullshit, you know, until your wife took over. Also, if you wanted me to know, you would tell me.
“Who promised she would sign the divorce papers the moment I meet somebody and fall in love. She joked about already having a lawyer picked out.” Tony’s not sure how to take that, so he decides to go to the next question. Apparently, the universe, or at least Laura, hates him. God, this was a lot.
Girl Friday: Pants were still on, but their shirts were off. Allegedly, it’s too hot. That room was 65°. I am rolling my eyes so hard right now. As well as sending the picture to both the princess and MJ. MJ never turns down shirtless Benji.
Tony: Well that’s better than the idea of certain board members to just unmask him at a press conference Thursday. Sexy Monkey said hell no to that.
Anthony: Really, I don’t care about the stocks. Everything will probably go down 10 points unless they were convinced I was making weapons for the government again. We both know proverbial hell will freeze over before then.
Nomad: I’ve already seen it. Clint enjoys classics from the 80s. We've also watched the Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, and 16 Candles. I like 16 Candles the best except for the Asian stereotyping. That was awful.
"Very wise. And she got killed because dad had too many enemies. I don’t want to take unnecessary risks and I think it’s safer if you keep a low profile."
“You should since it’s already tomorrow wherever you are. Hey how are the new recruits?” Tony asked.
So feel free to speculate how the show and Infinity War will influence this story or how things will be different in this timeline. But no matter what happens, remember that Tony and Steve are in a much better place because they got over themselves. And maybe just maybe the two Fitzs can live together in harmony, without one of them having a bridge dropped on him. Now, let’s celebrate that we are currently in Mumbai.
"Yes. After what happened in Siberia it became obvious that I have a lot of problems that have to be worked through with professionals and drugs. I'm not a healthy person but at least they figured out the right medication mix." Tony joked.
“Love you too,” He said as he pulled away and grabbed his bag. He didn’t look back, because if he did he would have burst into tears. He did still cry but at least he made it to the Quinjet.
“Isn’t that where the Fitzsimmons wedding happened? I kind of remember it from the text messages that you sent me from the wedding.”
Girl Friday: Wait, is your mission just an excuse to hook up with Cap Dad in the nearest broom closet? With Agent Agent getting kidnapped, I can see why Agent America might want to get to her boyfriend sooner rather than later.
Ana Jr.: Since you are now speaking with me in the year 2018, the experiment was obviously successful
Me: Yes, but it’s not that hard. I’ve never been very fond of the pretentious and superficial. Mr. Patriotism is very pretentious and extremely superficial. It’s like he thinks playing the part of the superhero is more important than being one.
Me: I have a team of people who keep a watch on how money moves at SI after the ‘business partners stabbing me in the back via kidnapping’ fiasco because I’m not going through that again. However, I may have been slightly too trusting when it comes to the foundations and did not have the same things in place. We didn't even know to start looking at Windom West until Clint’s sister showed up a couple of days ago.
“I saw those growing up, and this is not that. I love May. I really do, but it’s not the right type of love.” Steve tried to explain.
Anthony: Right now, I just want to cut my brain off for a few hours and trade snarky comments with you about what ever movie we’re watching together.
Nomad: Captain America is a tiny woman whose family immigrated from Hong Kong. I doubt that they’ll get confused. There was a press conference and everything.
May:  I’m still reading reports. Although I know we only have to worry about locating five stones because they took care of the mind stone without traumatizing Wanda.
Me: No, I think Hydra covered it up, but Aunt Peggy was smart and she would have seen things for what they were which is why she moved me into her house.
“Because the Captain America still comes with apple pie and hot fudge swirls." And was secretly Tony's favorite, but he’s never ever going to tell Steve that.
“Actually, Tony did not create Ultron. He was a project created by Shield and the U.S. government. He’s just taking the fall,” the android explained. “He did create Vision, who is a hero.”
Me: It is dangerous work. And well, I’ve had more than one employee try to kill me, recently. Agent also ran background checks on all of Peter’s friends and Decathlon members.
D FitzSimmons: I think I might not hate this Hunter despite sleeping with Bobo. I really can’t hold that against him because Nana is also sleeping with Hunter.
The Mechanic: No but yes. You’re different and people throughout the world are afraid of you because of that. You’re just starting to come to terms with the fact that you’re different than everyone else and maybe you want to keep that to yourself for a while because you’re not ready for others to look at you differently including the ones you love. You haven’t even completely acknowledged what this means to yourself yet.
CoulsonPJ: Ross wants Daisy back. Also apparently Talbot believes that carrots work better than honeycomb kill rooms.
"Although maybe to be on the safe side, you should probably hide the old sheets under the bed because your ex-girlfriend is a spy and will be here sometime in the morning to collect me." And Tony is not going to think about leaving Steve.
Also, this story is now being translated into Chinese by the fabulous KayKIMO. If anybody else is interested in translating this story or any of my other works into another language feel free to contact me.
Melinda: I’ll come with you. I will try to talk to Phil before Malta. But if this goes badly I’m going to find you in whatever country you’re in and hurt you.
Greetings from an undisclosed location. Although I’m trying to convince your aunt to let you come to this place for Christmas. I feel like I owe her a European vacation. So you probably heard about Mumbai. The wedding was good and the food was excellent. The terrorist attack, not so good. But no people with powers were harmed and we got the power back on. Also the country of India will no longer extradite the rogue Avengers on site. So all is good.
Me: So, after I stopped texting you, Spider Brat decided to use his tracker and newly 'liberated' suit to track down the weapons dealers to an abandoned gas station somewhere in Maryland.
“Because my knowledge from the other timeline prevented May from dying, albeit temporarily,” Leo told her.
Happy Bear: I am worried about you. I know about Siberia. My dad was abusive. He said he loved us but he hit us and mom all the time. It didn’t stop until I learned to hit back. I think that’s why I’m upset about this.
"Yes you can tell her how tough it is to babysit my boyfriend and she can tell you how hard it is to babysit my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend's daughter."
“You’re so mean.” He said, making his way out of the vent because he knew she would follow through. Natasha does not make idle threats. “I just want to be alone. It’s been a hard couple of days.”
“When you were eating, he decided to call his Nana even though we weren’t ready to test the multidimensional  messaging device yet." Bobo one explained.
Tony Bear: Pepper made me promise not to get arrested, again, in a foreign country. If I tried to make small talk again, then the probability of getting arrested jumps up to 89%. I don’t like those odds.
“At least you’re self-aware. Laura asked me if you ever worked through your adjustment disorder. Apparently, you were formally diagnosed with it a couple of months after the Siberia fuck up. Since both me and other Tony are bipolar, I feel like it's safe to assume the diagnosis also applies to you.” Tony explained. He won’t tell Steve that the formula for other Steve's antidepressants was passed on just in case.
D Fitzsimmons: That's what I'm trying to write about. Five and a half years ago, Leo Fitz ended up being killed in a blast that destroyed the monoliths. This just happened to be the day I came back to with my grandparents from the future before I knew they were my grandparents. He was dead before I knew the truth. Leo Fitz ended up being killed in a blast that destroyed the monoliths. Of course, Nana didn't have time to grieve because we had to keep the world from getting cracked apart. We did, then Thanos showed up. We lost Daisy, Mack, and Yo-Yo. Later Coulson died again, which just made things worse if such a thing were possible.
Red phone: I’m back in New York. I broke in my new bed, but not the fun way. The designers did a really good job. Did Friday send you pictures?
Me: Which won’t be until Thursday or Friday because you’re going to California first to tape a few talk show appearances and Pepper agreed to meet with Happy together. At least that was the plan this morning.
Me: I know you were there for a brief time, but you do remember what school was like? It's only gotten worse since the 80s.
CoulsonPJ: Ross keeps remarking that Stark is dating a Chris Evans look alike, but thankfully hasn’t put everything together yet, according to our DOS contact. Although after the package announcement in 15 minutes, I’m sure he’ll have other things to worry about.
: Wanda Maximoff, a.k.a. Scarlet Witch (media nickname). Stark sometimes refers to her as his daughter-in-law due to eloping with the Vision.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: Hey Ned this is Afia, Peter is currently throwing up in the bathroom and wishes he could turn invisible like his junior counterpart.
Ana Jr.: The cafeteria where you were at this morning is an option. You should be warned that your grandparents are back at the cafeteria currently talking about you. Simmons actually likes you, and so does Hunter.
Tony: Do you think it would’ve happened the same way if we were already dating? I would like to think that I could have manipulated you into at least listening to my position with the promise of a blowjob.
Anthony: Also, after the fall of Shield, Agent America had to be un-person. She really doesn’t have an actual identity outside of the government. We should make stuff as real as possible especially if you living as Stefan is the only way you can come back eventually.
Anyway I’ll try to get to LA to visit as soon as I can or at least arrange things so I’ll be in New York next time you’re in New York.
“The next question is supposed to be us using we sentences. I guess the first one is we really screwed up in Siberia.” Steve supplied.
Hunter: If you're trying to soften the blow, you maybe could've kept me from reading about my ex-wife disappearing in other me's arms. I didn’t want to read that account from my other-self. That you could’ve blocked.
This is an interlude chapter, but as you know, the interludes are where the best plot points happen. In this case we’re going to start to explore why some things are different in my timeline. This conversation happens to take place near simultaneously to Tony’s last conversation with his Stevie bear.
We are doing the New York Times’s 36 questions that lead to love again. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html
Melinda: But you need to fix things with Tony. It’s been seven years, and you’ve never worked through your guilt regarding what happened.
Tony: So, would you be upset if your shield was returned to a certain country due to the fact that Howard may have did something slightly illegal and definitely amoral to get it?
HSBF: Which would be good for you because you’re doing way too much, especially if you’re going to be taking the new job. But where does the revenge element come in?
Anthony: Yes, but he hates it when people get in the way of the mission. It annoys him. It’s looking more and more likely that Spidey is going to powered person summer camp or rather winter break camp as they kind of can’t wait nine months for intensive training.
Please note, this is not everything that Steve sent Tony in the last chapter. Remember from the last conversation that there were lots of sketches of the Brooklyn Bridge, snow, and trains involved. Below are some of the highlights. There is significantly less nudity than last time but everything really mean something to Steve and tells a part of our story.
Counselor Laura: Steve was a little upset about that. Especially because Sharon ended up reading those messages as part of her punishment after you managed to get her back in the good graces of the US government. So Steve will never ever give other you the real thing.
Cuddle bunny: It doesn’t matter. It still would’ve been awful. And we were too distracted with fighting amongst ourselves to do anything to stop it.
“He wants us to make sure his boyfriend doesn’t kill himself.” Wanda said, placing the device in his hand.
Melinda: But then I met Andrew and I let it go. Dating another agent would be messy. Andrew was easier and I did love him.
Tony: I think Steve wants Central Park in spring. And since it is Central Park, it must obviously be daytime. I’ll have Mary look into wedding planners. Or I can ask Simmons who she’s getting. Monkey lover 1 says she has three binders already filled with wedding stuff. I expect a save the date any minute. I know they are thinking March or April of next year.
Counselor Laura: Friday watches that as well and he’s been good. Friday also monitors electronic correspondence and some of the things that you said in your text messages have triggered the contact me threshold.
Tony: Also, apparently the brain trust is planning to use arc reactor technology to build up the power infrastructure of Puerto Rico before something catastrophic happens because apparently, you can't stop a hurricane. Even one that causes 2% of the population to get superpowers.
I’m sorry for what I said a few moments ago. I didn’t intend to send that email, but Peter is the technically inclined one in our family. I doubt that anything like that happened even though I’d did catch Peter with his shirt off with his BFF. I mean he is head over feet obsessing about Liz so he can’t be fooling around with Ned, I think. Then again, you’re supposed to be an international playboy and you have a gay sex tape.
Director Snookums: Not always. I hope things go well for you guys, but I am worried. I saw you after Siberia. I don’t want you to go back to that place.
"See, I knew there would be people down here that would understand." The man said, coming back in with chips, two slices of cold pizza, and a soda. Apparently, he heard their conversation from the kitchen. “Also, stop with the agent stuff. Just call me Deke. I’m not actually an agent. I am a consultant from Stark Industries.”
Girl Friday: Nobody expected Alastair to crash the wedding after he was paid off to keep quiet. That was not my fault. Can you make another one for Flash? Also, make sure that the documents are compatible with his screen reading software.
“You had the kids that weekend, and there may have been some edibles involved. May suggested that I send you a picture of my privates. When high, this seemed like a good idea.” Tony is now 100% sure Steve’s future ex-wife ships them.
Nomad: Better me then Anthony. I want to be there. If he wasn't stable, I would be there regardless. Not all of us can let our loved ones die without us.
Like last time, this is not actually a text message conversation between FRIDAY and Tony, but rather a transcript of FRIDAY and Tony’s conversation. This takes place immediately after the last conversation between Tony and Steve.
Ana Jr.: Per the DNA test, I assume that Agent Simmons is your grandmother. I also assume in your timeline, she's an alcoholic?
Tony: Pepper does. It's five years, and I'm still not used to the non-Happy driver. So I try not to use the service even though Sasha is lovely. But I will float the idea by Pepper. Then you can ask your daughter if she is OK with that.
I thought I was supposed to have winter spy school during the break. Although, I’m okay with that happening somewhere in Europe. Aunt [redacted] never really gets to have a vacation. The last time was years ago when we drove to Disney. That was before [redacted] died.
Monkey lover 2: Yes, actually. There may have been engagement rumors. I didn’t exactly have time to keep up with twitter when I was incarcerated.
Anthony: Little Anthony is always up for you, quite literally. Every other part of my anatomy, not so much. They're a little worried about me over exerting my heart due to my previous ‘condition’. I have a stress test in an hour. Dr. Simmons will not let me get out of it. She’s a little terrifying.
Acronym key: OES is the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. Yes, this is an actual office at the Department of State. In the MCU, I’m sure they’re dealing with that bit of ocean pollution that led to a recent explosion of people getting superpowers.
“Yes. The fact that they kept going after Ms. Marvel’s family despite being relocated three times, until I decided to put them on the Compound, made me realize that the other agencies that have the database would be vulnerable. That’s when Fitz and I came up with the Hellfire Protocol,” Tony explained.
“Exactly. Also, I’m still a little too angry to actually talk to Happy yet so it’s probably best that I have a few more days before we have to have that conversation. He’s already on his way to California to deal with the wrath of Pepper."
Me: By the time we found the scepter, Pepper had already issued her ultimatum. It was why I was looking at the old Ultron program to see if maybe there was a way to still help the world and not be out there all the time. You know how that turned out.
“You’re the one who disrupted my experiment. I’m not the person you know back at the lighthouse. A lot has happened in the last 5 1/2 years. Like me having to take care of the wife you abandoned Just so you can shack up with Hunter." Deke screamed.
Red phone: I don't know. I've half expected her to be here with her godson, but Laura has no idea where she is.
Me: You’re silly. So how was your day? I’m actually surprised you still text messaged me. It must be nearing 1 AM in New York.
Monkey Lover 2: Your boyfriend is not looking at his phone, so I have to contact you directly. DC is dark due to a continuous EMP attack. I am working on restoring power. False flag operation in effect by Watchdogs. Using the blackouts to attack Inhumans. I’m activating the revenge of hellfire protocol.
Me: I don’t know. Maybe we will fuck up so badly trying to save the world that there won’t be anything left in 70 years. I just feel like something bad is coming. Something that we won’t be ready to handle.
Since we’ve already spent some quality time with the Natasha and Clint of the “bad timeline,” I thought we could check in on their “better timeline” counterparts. Although considering both their partners are MIA, they might not see this as the “better” timeline.
“It was the same thing with Bucky.” Steve tells him “I was trying to help the person who I thought needed the most help. I didn’t realize how much else was riding on your choices, not until we really started talking to each other."
“Does he realize that you have a crush on him?” Hunter heard baby Fitz ask as he placed the secret Stark tech communicator in his pocket. He really wanted one of those bead phones that everyone else walking around has but he’s afraid to ask.
Also, remember that nobody under 18 is referred to by their real name in the text messages. If they are, the AIs will remove the name. However, in this universe, Flash and Liz are over 18 by the time this chapter takes place.
Anthony: Pretty much. Why talk about classifying the watchdogs as the terrorist group they are when celebrity gossip can get much better ratings.
Tony: Oh, good news, the studio is going with my suggestion of him playing Bruce instead of the guy from Fight Club that looks nothing like Bruce, but whatever.
“One I will never tell you.” Romanoff responded as she pulled back her now blonde hair into a ponytail. That’s when Tony noticed a mark on her neck.
Red phone: It’s that stupid fondue story. And you should know that I have used fondue as a double entendre before, so that’s no sign of you being inexperienced.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. Also, thank you for observing the no Spider-Man spoilers in the comments rule. You are all absolutely lovely. As more time passes, I will point out the differences in this universe from Spider-Man: Homecoming. The most obvious being Kevin/Laura/Yo-Yo took over Happy’s role in Tony’s life as well as his other work functions because Happy took Pepper’s side during the breakup implosion in this universe and he is only now back in New York. We will explore how that changes things as we progress as well as why this universe is different.
Me: Thank you for that. The urge to go to the liquor store has passed. Talking to you really helped.
I am aware that I made some serious mistakes  previously. I assumed things I shouldn't have. I did things I regret and that I'm sorry for. The fact that I can only see him occasionally at things like where we are right now is punishment for that.
BITC: Did she get pictures? Did she get his autograph? Did she try lifting the hammer? I bet she could lift it.
Me: Really, I should’ve had Laura pull him when he interrogated Baby Spider’s shady uncle. I thought the FBI agents and Yo-Yo on the ferry would keep things from ending badly.
Continuity Note: There are spoilers from/allusions to Agents of Shield: Slingshot in this conversation and a few of the upcoming sections. A slightly altered version of the events from the web series happened in this universe, mostly because I was planning on something similar happening anyway and the events occurred about the same time frame as the story. It’s nice when we are all on the same page.
Tony: Not at all. The President is making him resign early A.k.a. Wednesday. Although, if it makes you feel better they might ask you to do more of those Captain America educational videos.
Anthony: Dum-E already had to intervene twice. It’s for the best, even though it’s kind of a mad house outside of the personal apartments.
Me: Jealousy is so cute, but no worries. According to Benji, last week his aunt asked the Bulletproof Pacifist if he wanted to go out for coffee sometime and he politely declined due to the fact he has a new boyfriend of two months. Benji was also freaked out when she responded with something about all superheroes being gay.
Counselor Laura: We also need a grief counselor. Also, Tony said something about me needing to do an intervention in Norway. Why do I need to do an intervention in Norway?
BFF Ned: Why is the princess even in the US? Is this related to the Thor sightings on Twitter Friday?
“No. That’s going to be Kamala’s choice. Maybe you and her biological family will be splitting custody for a while, but you have to give her a choice. She 16. She gets to choose who she lives with.”
“Really, I’m so tired of you guys trying to kill me. And badly. Seriously, what’s with the dog masks? I mean if you’re going to wear a mask to conceal your identity, at least design something that allows for fighting. You’re totally getting your asses kicked by a Russian ballerina, a social worker, an engineer and an NGO worker,” Tony said as he successfully broke the arm of six after disarming the idiot who went after him again, even after getting shot. He quickly gave the weapon to Sam, who could make the most use out of it.
The new consultant: I just feel like something different is happening this time. Like we're on the cusp of something big. I hope it’s not another New York.
Me: Hey Godmother, I have no idea if this burn phone is in the nearest lake, but you should know that you owe me 20 bucks because Captain Oblivious just realized that Shellhead has a schoolboy crush on him.
Anthony: Although thinking about it, so are you. Okay, Agent America will be giving that speech, because Yo-Yo got shot a couple of months ago after taking a bullet for her current boyfriend, which led to cauterization by blowtorch.
Me: You both fucked up equally. Because of the fact that he’s using the phone that you got him for emergencies to flirt via text message I’m going to assume that he still has a crush on you.
Me: I would make a joke about your multitasking abilities, but pre-algebra awaits. Talk to you later, Gummy Bear.
Tony: I always need you. However, I am only about 10 more minutes of this meeting. Also, Agent America is standing by to pull me out, most likely for another briefing on or conference call about the Adrian Toomes situation.
On her workbench, there seemed to be a few drawings of him as well. One looks like he’s in the desert being very sad with sand running through his hand. There’s another one of him surrounded by chaos wearing a gauntlet with Multicolored gems on it facing that purple raisin. Another one looks like him and several kids at a wedding that seems to be taking place out at a lighthouse. He is also kissing Steve in that one. He likes that better. He’s pretty sure one of those kids was Afia and maybe an older version of Lily bear.
Red phone: Mostly because I'm avoiding Pepper. At least there I don’t have to see her. I’m not looking forward to the next board meeting.
Steve: I don’t think that’s entirely it. I saw her looking at her phone before she passed out and I think that’s why she passed out. I think we need to look at her phone to really know what happened.
This conversation takes place on the evening of September 21, 2016. That means that parts of it took place before some of the later emails that Tony received. I just didn’t want to split up that conversation.
Me: The Galileo satellite incident did make the news, but they’re referring to it as the Galileo satellite incident because the public is already in a panic.
Anthony love: Unfortunately, I won’t be there. I’m currently on my way to the Playground because I have no control over my schedule.
It is way too early West Coast time for me to be dealing with this. The principal called Kevin on his personal number because apparently, one of Kevin’s kids went to Midtown before the relocation. The principal knows him personally. Kevin covered because he is the best. Again, I would like to know what is happening.
Me: Now you’re actually contacting me. I’ve been trying to call you for the last 3 days. Do you have any idea how many text messages and emails I’ve left you? Did you throw your phone into the ocean again? Agent Piper said that Steve was hit. Is he okay?
Monkey lover2: Me too. I forgot about the Tony Stark Gay Sex Tape. This state is preferable than before.
“She is. Aunt Pepper is also kind of with Happy this time around, so that may not work out for you.” Friday interjected.
Anthony love: So today or maybe yesterday at this point, on the day that happens to coincide with when Fitz bounced back to our timeline, two people from that timeline came to our timeline. One who, according to multiple DNA tests is the grandchild of the Fitzsimmons is stuck here. The other is Clint, who managed to take his sort of wife back to his timeline.
Purple Princess: Or me. So, she won't let him come up here, not after what happened last time. She doesn't even let him come to the house in Queens. We must go to him unless he's with his dad. It's been a year, and she's still mad about what happened last year at the wedding. Like that was my dad's fault.
Nomad: Okay, I had four grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch. They’re just so small. It’s just sometimes I still feel guilty about getting extra food. I know mom sometimes went without eating just so I could.
Tony: I am too. Laura told me that Steve 2.0 saw through the light bulb story because of something in your own childhood. Laura wouldn't tell me what that was. Although I'm supposed to ask about family in Nevada.
Blue phone: I think I would like that especially if it was you. Maybe I’m a little confused about how you make me feel sometimes. Oh God, I can’t send that message to you. I’ll scare you off even more. So much for our promise to keep talking to one another. (Message not sent)
“May said I was too focused on the mission that I was obsessed with it, and I didn’t see the big picture.”
Me: That gives me plenty of time to enact my revenge. Don’t say anything about the breakup. It hasn’t made it to the press yet because Jane is still trying to figure out a way to make Robert come out like the asshole that he is without damaging Pepper because our society is sexist as hell. It’s always the woman’s fault.
Okay, you’ll probably notice a change in handwriting right now. This is Steve’s mysterious boyfriend. You’re probably wondering why he’s writing you. Well, we’ve met. And when we were together last time, I was an asshole. Actually, asshole is an understatement. I was also out of my fucking mind and I tried to kill you.
Genius Princess: I'm still trying to figure that out. I wanted to enlist the BITC's help, but his mother won't allow it.
Captain Tight Pants: You don’t actually think that Ross can provide better oversight than we can? Especially because you hate his guts.
Anthony: You're getting good at these little pep talks. Don't worry I'm still drinking a rum free Coke. The good stuff with actual sugar.
Tony: Don’t care. He was an abusive alcoholic and he hurt your mom and you, so I don’t have the energy to remember his name or make up one for Stefan’s father. Eventually, he left and Steve’s mom told everybody that he died during the Great War where Stefan’s mom didn’t even bother with alive because divorce was normal.
“Of course it did. By the way, Hunter keeps texting you,” Simmons said giving him back his personal phone. “There must be 100 or so in there. You should probably message him back.”
For those of you who read Star Trek (particularly the Kelvin timeline), tomorrow I will be posting my entry for K/S Advent 2016 titled How to Survive (Until) Your Wedding. Check it out tomorrow if you're into that sort of thing.
Hunter: Let me prepare Leo for what's going to happen. Because he's going to have to interact with Deke. They can't keep just glaring at each other from across the room. Simmons invited him to the anniversary party. It's been rescheduled.
He wanted to protect people like his new charges from Queens and Jersey City. After very interesting conversations with Ms. Rodriguez about ICE’s stance on people with superpowers, I realized that some of his actions that I was really angry about before were just his way of protecting teammates from being deported. That's part of the reason why she is his assistant. Apparently being Tony Stark's assistant is considered a highly skilled job deserving of an EB-1 visa.
Tony Bear: Someday soon I need to tell you about trying to get KFC in Tokyo at 3 AM. You didn’t think about venturing out to try some of the local cuisine? Or, you know, at least go down to the restaurant. You did so well at breakfast.
Anthony: Don’t forget about the possibly having sex with someone too drunk to consent. BTW that’s now considers sexual assault. Well at least he's making sure you see all the good stuff from the 80s. Princess Bride? Coming to America?
Morgan’s dad: Now you’re talking. Your brownies are better than hunters cookies but don’t tell him that.
Ana Jr.: Technically, he was able to sleep for one hour and 21 minutes. He was agitated when Agent America woke him up. Apparently, he was having one of the good dreams.
D FitzSimmons:  I hope you don’t actually get that message because I shouldn’t have said it that way. I was just angry typing. I wasn’t really planning to send that message, but not-Friday sent it anyway.
The fact that some things could be changed is why he was standing with his boyfriend waiting for two Asgardian’s to show up so they can try to convince them to let the Tesseract be destroyed during Ragnarok (even if Robin suggested something different). Why did Leo feel like this was one of those things they couldn't change? But they were going to try anyway. They would make sure Robin's drawings would not come to pass.
Red phone: Friday just had to revive me after my heart stopped because you managed to shock me simply by knowing what FWB is.
Just as Steve was reading the message, Tony’s face popped up on his screen along with the small children that were sleeping on top of him.
Tony: We both have best friends named James that we will do things for that may not be the best for everyone else.
Tony: Puerto Rico with mom to visit the extended family. Also one of his cousins may have just gone through Tergenesis, so Rio is checking it out with Davis and Piper. Which means New Orleans will just be on its own until closer to Mardi Gras.
D FitzSimmons: So the fact that I'm with Bobo one means that he didn’t die in the explosion. The monolith sent him back 22 months (?) in time. He sort of made a new timeline. Now I personally would have done something cool like becoming a rockstar super agent. Bobo One decided to become CCO of Stark industries and ended up with Hunter.
The Big Boss: The board wants to call a meeting. They tried to do that through your assistant, but she pretended not to understand English. Only Perez is fluent and knew better.
Me: I did and then I had Jane get rid of all the images of Benji getting his dick smashed by his homecoming date as well as a lot of Spidey Twitter pics. Also, she’s kind of mad that I refused to give the kid an award for providing us information that led to the Vulture’s arrest.
“Nobody wants to talk about their sister killing most of their people and then their brother subsequently getting his neck snapped by Thanos not that long after that.”
“And this is why we made Platypus and Lily Bear’s aunt the Avengers diplomat/government liaison for years. With the aunt on the lamb, Platypus had to step up and do all the untangling post Germany fiasco by himself. He went head-to-head with the UN. Even before that he was the government’s liaison to Stark Industries.”
Me: But I’m not going to let that scare me off. If we only have another day, another week, or another couple of years, then I am going to take every single second of that and treasure it. I don’t want to have any regrets.
"And yes she's back permanently. I know Steve well enough to know that you're going to need extra help to keep him from doing stupid stuff like suicide by nobility. It's such a dangerous trait to have in a boyfriend."
“Yes it is true. They’re not going to work so stop pushing them to work because you are too scared to ask Pepper out.”
Me: Sometimes in the lab I do start singing along with the music. It depends on the song. I’m sure Friday has video.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. It is now time for more get well messages. Some digital and others contain cookies. Apparently, everybody just wants to send Tony things that won’t send him into anaphylaxis. Also, he doesn’t eat enough.
