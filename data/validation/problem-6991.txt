The music in the workshop that was blaring went silent and there was a moment of silence as Tony listened to Friday. The man’s shoulders tensed and he put down his tools. He slowly turned to face the doors and frowned as he saw Bucky. A second later, the doors slid open and Bucky took hesitant steps inside.
Tony laughed, despite the thought of pregnancy swirling in his mind. Maybe he should tell Steve? No, he didn’t want to get the Alpha’s hope up if it was nothing. He went about his morning, cleaning up and feeding the horses.
Even more gratifying still was when he took one of his kills and skinned it himself. He gave soft prayers to the gods, thanking the animal for its sacrifice, and made a fur of his own. He’d been alone then, on watch by a low-burning fire.
When they finally got back to the tower, Tony was waiting in the common room. He was so damn nervous that he could hardly keep still as he tried to focus on the designs for Natasha’s new Widow Bites on the StarkPad he held in his hands. Waiting was torturous, and he wanted to just go get his suit so he could track down both super soldiers and bring them back. Bucky had told him to wait, though. After searching a few blocks and not finding any sign of Steve, not even a lead, Jarvis let them know that there was a sighting of the Captain in Brooklyn. Many people had snapped quick pictures of him on his bike, then a few more as he walked down the street on a very familiar road.
Tony nodded in agreement. He startled just a bit when Steve took his hand and kissed the top of it gently. Tony was never one to fall for such things, but coming from this Alpha, it seemed wondrously romantic. Tony smiled, a soft, hesitant thing. He was putting his trust in this man. He hoped to the gods it would work out.
At least, that’s what his father thought of him. Apparently, a lot of people thought that way, though Tony had never understood why. He supposed that Omegas’ ‘natures’ were to be demure. To be in the houses, care for the pups. They weren’t leaders. At least, that’s what was said about them.
He hesitated before clicking on a video. A demonstration, the notes called it. He watched in horror as he saw Barnes forced into the chair, restrained there as the machine folded over his brain. The electricity started and Tony listened to Barnes scream for about thirty seconds before he was stopping the video, not able to take any more.
“They’re expecting the assassination to work. No doubt, they’re expecting word from Rumlow in a month or so,” Tony spoke up. “Obadiah underestimated us, and our people. He sent too few. Rumlow failed. No doubt his plan was to have us killed in the night, and for the Hydra men to take the clan over.” There were a large number of people that were not warriors. No doubt Obadiah considered his warriors to be superior, and that the good Stark warriors who had defected would align themselves with his cause or face death.
Pepper hummed and regarded him for a moment. “I’m sure your father will want it done as quickly as you do,” she answered. Tony wasn’t so sure. His father had probably heard a lot of the talk last night regarding Omega rights. He more than likely disapproved of Steve’s stance on things. Maybe he’d change his mind about this particular Lord.
Bucky had expected anger to fully hit Tony at some point. He’d expected the man to storm in and attack, or at the very least have him kicked out. However, three days passed and he noticed Steve starting to get worried. He learned that this was a common thing for Tony, closing himself up in his workshop when he was upset or stressed.
“It wasn’t an accident. It was orchestrated. Howard had some serum left, some of the original formula. They were transporting it when the crash happened. It was an ordered hit.” Steve wasn’t looking at him, just into space. Tony felt shocked and saddened, his ears ringing. He wondered why Steve was telling him this now.
Steve leaned over for a soft kiss. “I pray that our son will wait for me to return before he’s born,” Steve says tenderly. Tony laughs, a little watery because he doesn’t want Steve to leave. Not now, especially.
“Okay. Okay…but we’re totally going to have a talk about how you got in here like that,” Tony said breathlessly. Bucky’s only response was a huff. Tony went to work, getting all of, well, everything, back online. This almost felt like a dream. A very weird dream. He knew it wasn’t, though. The Winter Soldier was sitting here, in his lab, waiting for him to…well, he wasn’t sure what. Fix his arm, probably. But he knew there was significance to Bucky coming here, to the tower.
Tony blinked in surprise, and then he grinned back. Yeah, that was definitely a man who was interested. He nodded, letting his grin ease into a small smirk. “Sure thing, buttercup,” He teased, brown eyes twinkling. Bucky looked a little relieved at that and definitely excited. He set the tablet down and turned to leave the workshop.
This was so perfect; it almost felt like a dream. The sunlight filtered in through the slightly raised curtains as Bucky took both Steve and Tony’s hands in his and led them to the bed. They fell onto the soft sheets together, three sets of lips and hands all on each other. Later, Steve would wake up all tangled in limbs, two different patterns of soft breathing on either side of him, and think how lucky he was to end up there against all odds. Despite everything it had taken to get them there, they’d gotten a second chance.
Natasha sighed and shook her head. “Oh, he’s acting all sweet now. Don’t let him get away with his slip!” She exclaimed as she took a sip from her own cup, eyes shining with mirth. Lord Steve grimaced a little.
“Hail Hydra,” the criminals all said in unison before the lever was pulled and they lurched to their deaths.
“He wasn’t proud of me, even when he thought I’d be Alpha,” he would say back, even though it would fall on deaf ears. Perhaps, when Tony had been very young, Howard had been a proud and hopeful father. Though, Tony had distinct memories of his childhood, even before his presenting day, where he wasn’t good enough in training. Or he wasn’t good enough during a hunt.
Steve smiled back, looking equal parts nervous and excited. “Go,” Tony told him softly. “The pup isn’t being born yet, and you have a team to assemble.” The fight couldn’t stop, not for this, not for anything.
“Oh. The translator. Yeah, it’s going on without a hitch. I’m glad my design worked, otherwise we’d both be pretty confused right now,” Tony laughed a little. Steve looked up at him, impressed as he connected the dots.
“Your parents.” Was the first thing out of Steve’s mouth, and Tony felt his blood go cold. His parents? Steve knew this was a sore subject for him. He hated talking about Howard and Steve’s good old days. Hated thinking about how he’d never got to say goodbye to his mother.
“Well, look who knows how to use doors, after all. Miracles do happen, you know.” Tony tried to tease, to lighten the air, but Bucky could see how tense he was still. He was upset, not that Bucky blamed him at all.
Tony felt grief sink into his very bones. He tried to stay upright but his knees gave out. He felt Steve kneel beside him, hands over his shoulders. Tony didn’t hear anything else, didn’t hear his mate’s soft placations.
This one showed the words being spoken, Bucky’s screaming filling the room, and then as the words went on, Bucky silenced. His face was twitching, his eyes going dead, cold. Tony stared in horror as they made him do unspeakable things to people around him, to document the proof that their Asset worked.
It's done! Finally. It took me way too long to finish writing this, oops! I hope you guys have enjoyed it anyway! I promised a happy ending, and I delivered, with much fluff. Seriously, it's tooth rotting. You're welcome. Haha!
When most were again stumbling back to their tents, Steve walked him back. Tony went to return the fur, but Steve stopped him with steady, gentle hands. “No, keep it. You said yourself; you don’t have many pelts to wear. It’s a gift,” Steve told him quietly. Tony looked up at him, fighting away the flush in his cheeks. Damn this Alpha for making him blush so much.
Bucky listened intently and looked heartbroken for Steve. He never liked to see Steve in any pain, and even he couldn’t imagine everything Steve had gone through. Steve shook his head before he continued to explain in a soft tone. “I figured it wouldn’t be fair to him. Because I still loved you. I couldn’t put him through that, not after everything he’s lost,” Steve finished.
Steve offered a kind smile and nodded. “The few you have will do for our trip. There are more once we reach our lands,” Steve supplied. Tony felt a thrill rush through him when the Alpha referred to the lands as theirs, not just his. He pulled the fur that Steve gave him tighter around his shoulders. When the Alpha wasn’t looking, distracted in conversation with Sam, he ducked down to bury his nose in the fur to catch Steve’s scent.
Steve smiled and nodded, before leaning over to press a gentle kiss to Tony’s forehead. Tony closed his eyes and leaned into the touch, feeling warmth bloom through him. He didn’t feel uncertain or scared. He trusted this man with what was about to happen.
“Good. They’ll answer for their crimes in the north. The people will like to see someone punished. It will give them closure,” Steve answered.
The punching bag gave underneath his onslaught, sand going everywhere. He paused, breathing hard and that’s when he noticed there were easily fifteen, maybe more, ruined bags on the gym floor.
The Rogers clan was built very differently to the one of Tony’s childhood. He marveled at the stone buildings and had to stop himself from jumping off his horse to examine the structures. In the south, it was hot, so they mostly lived in tents to allow for cool breezes. They had to move a lot too, shifting to different parts of the land when their crops had made the fields useless.
Despite the lower temperatures, summer and spring brought these lands bountiful harvests. Their soil was good; some say it’s blessed. Tony knew that his childhood clan would benefit from the food.
Steve was a heavy, protective presence beside him the whole time. “I’m so sorry, sweetheart,” Steve uttered once they were out of earshot of most. Tony sighed shakily and stopped his walking to turn and look up at his mate.
He was really trying not to panic here. None of this was familiar, but it didn’t seem like he was in danger either.
“Do you understand your mission, Asset?” Pierce asked, blue eyes intense with a crazed determination. Another beat of silence hung in the air, but the Asset answered before Pierce could land another blow.
So, no, he hadn’t wanted to stay, but he was so exhausted, and the bed had been so inviting. He’d fallen asleep and only woken up when the sun’s rays filtered in through the modern glass windows. Bucky sighed as he opened his eyes, sat up and took in his surroundings in the daylight. The apartment was clean, nice, obviously filled with quality furnishings. Stark had the money, he knew. The one thing he liked about it most though, was how blank it was. Like it was just waiting for a person to make it theirs.
“Come on, don’t pay him any mind. Let’s go out to the balcony.” Tony wanted a little bit of fresh air right now, and it would be a better place to talk than the common room. Somewhere a little more private, just in case one or more of their teammates came back.
On the fourth day, when the announcement was finally made, and people scrambled to see the arrival party, Tony felt nauseous. His handmaiden, Pepper, quickly grabbed him and pulled him back into his tent.
Tony fixed her with a bitter glance. “Perhaps…but can I not even choose who I’m meant to marry? Does it have to be some random Lord I’ve never met before?” He didn’t necessarily want a mate at the moment, but if he ever did, he’d at least like the choice of selecting who it was.
“What? Years? But what about Pepper? You two were so happy.” Steve looked beyond confused. Tony sighed and nodded, thinking back to his past relationship. It was complicated, in his mind. Both good and bad times, and yet still Pepper was one of the most important people to him.
He took a quick shower and went to the gym to find Steve. No doubt the other super soldier had already woken up, ran and had breakfast, and was now doing his morning routine. He wanted to talk to him about last night and make sure that everything was okay.
When he walked inside, people were still staring before there was a collective shuffle, parents whispering to their kids to get a move on, and suddenly, he had the room to himself.
“It’s a good team. They’ll keep you safe, I’m sure of it,” Tony told him. They had a large army, but they were hopeful for the least amount of causalities possible. This highly trained team was definitely capable of infiltrating and executing the most important members under the cover of night. The numbers of their army were only a backup plan, in case their planning failed.
Tony paused and stared, looking a little horrified and no doubt making some of the same connections that Bucky was.
The Omega threw his hands into the air in frustration. “You’re not getting it! Even now, you have no clue how they see me! How they see all Omegas! We’re like cattle! They won’t see me staying here to lead as a positive thing.” He moved closer to Steve, seething. “They murdered my mother. They murdered children of our clan. I want to see the light flicker from Obadiah’s eyes myself. I want to be the one to do it. And it’ll be all the sweeter if I do it in my final months of carrying our son. Or perhaps with him swaddled to me.”
His crew. They were all dead. He hadn’t managed to stop the asteroid from hitting the ship and…how? How had he survived?
“I am glad, as well. You must understand. I’m not used to receiving any type of right. My open defiance of this would have me cast out if I was not a Lord’s son,” Tony explained. “It is…quite refreshing to see an Alpha who agrees with how I think.”
There was no answer from his husband’s lips. Tony stared at his mate’s face for a long while, unable to sleep right away. Tony finally sighed and put his hand on his stomach. He turned back around, settling down for sleep.
Steve gave a groan and cracked open his eyes. Tony gave a relieved intake of breath, though Steve being awake didn’t mean much. Bruce had no choice but to ignore Tony for now and rip open Steve’s shirt to get at the bleeding wound.
“The North’s recent plague has made their populations thinned. Through this marriage, we have agreed that some of us from the South will migrate to the North in exchange for use of lands and for trade,” Howard continued. There was some whispering, excitement but also hesitation. Tony figured not many would want to relocate. The North, though having much to offer in resources, was quite cold and the people of Stark clan were used to their nice weather and silks.
There was sympathy in his gaze. Steve didn’t want this young man’s sympathy. Though his beauty was a welcome and unexpected distraction from his new, raw loss.
He left the room and Steve was faced with silence, except for the beeping of monitors from the equipment. He spent a few hours just lying there, trying to get it together. He had more questions. Where was he? How had he been found? Who were these people?
Howard looked pleased with that answer. “Yes, of course. While I don’t necessarily approve of his Head of Guard, he’s still a good match,” Howard spoke for a moment like Steve wasn’t there. Tony could tell that bothered the young Lord if the slight clench of his jaw was anything to go by. Luckily, his father hadn’t noticed.
“Ah, Tony. Congratulations on your mating. I’m sure you’ll provide Lord Steven with a worthy heir for both of our clans,” he said, his tone just as sickly fake as his countenance. Steve looked offended at that; Tony could tell that’s what he was feeling by the glint in his blue eyes.
Bucky didn’t question, just stayed silent in the hopes that Steve would elaborate. Eventually, he did. He took a deep breath, and his hands trembled a little. “It’s…a long story. But you’re right; it is about you and Tony. I guess I just never thought…I mean I saw the two of you getting closer, but I never assumed you’d…” Steve sighed again, realizing he was tripping over his own words.
Tony nodded, confirming Steve’s earlier question. He shifted closer, more in Steve’s space as they leaned against the balcony railing. He could smell Tony’s expensive cologne in the air, and it only made him want to be even closer. “Yeah. I guess you just give off a very straight vibe, being Mr. America and all,” Tony teased. Then, he seemed to hesitate a bit before reaching out and putting his hand gently on Steve’s forearm. “It’s not your fault. It’s not any of our faults. Circumstances kept us apart, but that’s over now. Bucky and I want you if you’ll have us?” Tony asked, looking beyond hopeful now. There wasn’t any point in hiding his emotions after all of this.
Tony felt the telltale signs of his own arousal as he hardened and felt a gush of slick. He heard Steve groan into their kiss. No doubt the Alpha had smelled the slick from him. He’d heard that Alphas were especially susceptible to its scent.
“Of course. You have to know how to defend yourself in this world. Especially us Omegas,” she said this, the regret of its truth clear in her expression. She turned to Pepper next and fixed her with a glinting smile. “And you? I saw you last night, but never learned your name.”
“Tony…you being in heat doesn’t waver your consent. I’m your mate, it’s true, but you can be alone. It’s every Omega’s right to refuse during their heat. It’s every Alpha’s right to refuse during their rut. You must know this,” Steve said a little desperately. When Tony just looked even more confused, Steve did all he could to rein in the anger for Tony’s childhood clan.
Bucky definitely hadn’t planned to stay the night. He knew that it would have been better to leave. He already felt guilty that he’d asked for Tony’s help, without the man knowing the truth about what he’d done. He wondered why Steve hadn’t said anything. No…he knew why. Steve was protecting him. Steve felt like he owed Bucky that protection, even from his new team, even after all the things that Bucky had done as the Soldier.
Tony seemed to be a little taken aback by having to give this information so suddenly. He politely clears his throat and gives Steve a careful look. “Captain. The year is 2365.”
Steve looked placated by this and climbed in after his Omega. Tony immediately reached for his Alpha, the scent of him only making his heat settle in faster. It was going to be a long few days, but Steve being near him would certainly help.
Steve’s hands came up again after Tony’s diadem joined Steve’s, but this time they tugged at a knot of his silk. The fabric loosened, unfolding from the careful placement it had been in. He felt warm fingers trail over his shoulders, brushing the silk off of olive-toned skin. Tony felt the fabric pool useless to the ground and he was finally naked in front of his new mate.
There was an eerie silence for a long moment, the winter air whipping through the courtyard, and the angry citizens of Tony and Steve’s joined clan listened.
Howard’s gaze was like fire again as Tony spoke up and the Omega knew he’d made a mistake. Howard raised his hand as if to strike him and Tony inwardly prided himself on the fact that he barely flinched and didn’t break eye contact.
Tony let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. He rocked Peter in his arms, who had fallen asleep again out of exhaustion no doubt. Bruce wrapped Steve’s wound in a tighter bandage.
Tony believed him, of course. He knew that Steve was speaking honestly, and from the heart. He turned in Steve’s arms and smiled at him, feeling warm with love and reassurance.
There was a quiet shifting; a creak on a floorboard of their room and Tony was up in a second. He wasn’t a deep sleeper, and he was on edge these days. He didn’t know if Obadiah would send men to kill him, even if none of his supporters from his tribe were traitors.
He felt like he could cry, but he didn’t. He kept it together as he made his way to his own tent. He wasn’t getting out of this. If he wanted to avoid it, he’d have to run away and he knew he wouldn’t last in the wilds. He was a Lord’s son, an inventor. He wasn’t a particularly good hunter or survivalist; at least he didn’t think so. It had never been put to the real test.
They walked arm in arm toward the prepared tent, cheering people behind them. It quieted down the further down the lit path they got, and when they stepped into the tent, almost all noise except for the crackling fire was muted. Tony looked up at his Alpha, hoping he didn’t look too nervous.
They changed his sheets and dealt with the afterbirth, which Tony wrinkled in his nose in disgust at, but honestly he’s way too tired to even care that much. Eventually, Peter ate his fill and fell asleep as well. Tony kept him in the sling at his chest and fell into a much-needed deep sleep as well.
He stood in front of his ornate floor-length mirror, staring at himself as the two Omega women helped to get him ready. He hoped he could get the nervous shaking out of his system before he walked out there to join Steve on the dais, but he highly doubted it. Pepper reached up with gentle hands and slowly dragged sharpened coal around Tony’s eyes.
So, when he’d taken the reigns of the horse Steve offered him, and swung his leg over, earning a smattering of gasps from the onlookers, he’d just grinned. He was amused at this point, all these small-minded people realizing that there was a world outside of their stupid closed-off views. That there were people out there, whole clans, that lived by entirely different laws.
“I was, most of the time. She was good to me. Good for me. I just…wasn’t good for her. She doesn’t deserve this life we lead. The Avengers. Fighting other people’s battles all the time, risking our lives. I put her in so much danger because of Iron Man. I guess neither of us could live with that for any longer.” Tony admitted all of this and shrugged.
Tony nodded, trying to look like his mother had convinced him. “Okay, I’ll try.” And he would, for her. Sometimes she ignored her husband’s awful behavior out of love, but she was a good woman. And Tony knew she loved him. He’d try for her but wasn’t promising he’d be ready to marry the man at first sight.
Bucky knew that Steve had spent a lot of time down here with Tony as well. The other man would join them sometimes, but he’d always slip off after Bucky and Tony got talking about some theory or another, saying he should go for a workout or something along those lines. Bucky didn’t think anything of it, and neither did Tony.
Oh. Business. Okay, there went the butterflies. Business?! As if Tony was just some sort of cattle to be talked about over a roasted chicken and a cup full of wine! Tony let out an offended huff and turned on his heel, back toward his tent.
“We have other things to discuss,” Maria Hill spoke up, her eyes slightly glazed over as the gift the gods had given her worked. They looked at her, waiting for her to tell them what it was that she was seeing.
He heard Steve make a curious, confused sound, but he didn’t care to stay any longer in the presence of the Alpha. He had no idea why this man was so flippant about Tony’s improper Omega behavior, but Tony wasn’t going to fall for the Alpha’s charm!
Natasha got in his space, sniffing. It might be considered rude if they weren’t so close. Tony raised an eyebrow at her as she took a step back again. “Your scent is changing. It’s slight, but take it from another Omega. I can tell. Congratulations are in order, my Lord.” She looked happy for him, the ever-serious warrior offering him a soft smile.
He looked terrified for a moment before he seemed to snap out of it. “Guilty!” He shouted and then looked surprised that he’d admitted such a thing. “I’m guilty of the charges,” he said this in a quieter voice. There was a collective gasp among the people.
Tony leaned into his Alpha’s touch and just let himself enjoy the feeling of being cared for. He usually hated Steve getting overly protective, determined to protect himself, but tonight had been harrowing. It made the Alpha feel good to be protective, so he let him have it.
Also, let me know if you guys want a NSFW Epilogue? I kinda faded to black there a little bit, just because I'd rated this fic a T. I can certainly write a little follow up though if people want that! ;)
And Bucky was so fragile, relearning how to be a person and not a weapon for others to use. It wouldn’t be right for Steve to ask Bucky for something more, when Bucky barely knew himself.
“The gods tell me we have conspirers in our midst, although they are being surprisingly unhelpful with specifics. We need to keep our vigilance,” she said and her eyes slowly cleared again. Tony frowned at that information.
He was selfish, though. So horribly selfish, and he felt himself getting nauseous for the first time in years. He’d lost them both, hadn’t deserved either of them and they’d fallen through his fingers like the damn sand that littered the gym floor.
His mother met him in his tent a couple hours later, as expected. She fixed him with a sympathetic glance as she crossed the space and sat down at the foot of his bed, among all the furs. “Anthony, my dear,” she started, brown eyes searching for any emotion on Tony’s face.
The poll of people was chosen and stood with the officials and the royal pair, slightly above the onlooking crowd. Drums were sounded as the prisoner was brought out, growling and sneering at anyone who hissed at him along the way.
It was four days until Tony saw the light of day again. On the fourth morning, he’d woken up, sore and exhausted. Steve was slumbering beside him, obviously just as tired. Tony stretched gingerly, wincing at the pain of all his muscles. His heat-addled brain hadn’t cared that rough sex would result in consequences.
Tony nearly screamed, his eyes rolled back into his head as he came just from the sensation of being stretched on that knot, feeling Steve’s seed empty into him in hot waves. Just when he thought it couldn’t get better, he felt Steve’s teeth on his bonding gland, biting, breaking the skin. If he could have come again, he would have.
Tony shut the screen down. He sat in his chair, staring at nothing for a while, just completely shocked and horrified. He couldn’t turn Barnes away. Not after 70 years of that. He couldn’t blame the man for his parent’s deaths; there wasn’t any conceivable way that he could. He blamed the men who tortured Bucky, the scientists who delighted in turning Bucky into a shell, a weapon. He let out a shaky sigh as he processed this.
“If anyone isn’t worth it, it’s me,” Bucky said softly, and that got Tony’s attention. He looked at the super soldier with incredulity. He was about to ask just what the hell Bucky was talking about when the other man continued. “I…all the things I’ve done. All the people I’ve hurt. Your…your pare--” Bucky started and Tony interrupted him by holding up a hand.
Steve looked even more delighted and amused at that. “Feel free to. I’ll be here in the morning. And many, many mornings after that,” Steve promised softly. Tony’s heart skipped a little at the sentiment. He closed his eyes and let himself fall into unconsciousness, his Alpha surrounding him in every way.
Eventually, the baby quieted, and they got him to latch on and eat. Tony leaned back against the pillows that have him propped up and he dozed in and out. He’s grateful for the sling that the midwife had fashioned, so he didn’t have to constantly hold his arms up to keep the pup supported.
He and the pup were both startled awake by frantic calls outside the tent. Tony went to sit up, it’s his first instinct, but he’s stopped by the weight of an infant on his chest and then the sharp pain between his thighs.
It raged for an hour before Tony finally spotted him. He felt anger course through him with every fiber of his being. He shot a clear path, right up to Obadiah. Gods, he wanted to just slaughter him. But no, that would be too quick.
When they were gone, Tony let out a shaky sigh and the dagger he’d been holding so confidently fell to the floor with a clatter. Steve set his shield down and moved to him, helping him sit back down on the bed. They’d almost lost their lives tonight. Tony put a protective hand on his stomach.
Bucky took him to a nice little Italian place on a side street. Tony would think that Italian was a little much for a first date, but it felt right. They laughed and sipped on wine over a candle-lit dinner and it was so damn romantic, Tony almost ran for the hills because he was terrified. He was falling so damn fast and he had no control over it. He hadn’t felt like this since Pepper, and he was so scared of getting hurt again. Of yet another person leaving him.
“Friday, put the curtains back,” Bucky asked of the AI quietly. The room was put back in relative darkness and soon enough he heard Tony’s soft snores again. Last night had been wonderful, Tony so beautiful underneath him. Bucky grinned as the memories came back to him, how Tony had arched and moaned so gorgeously.
There was a writing desk, and a bookshelf filled with tomes. Tony eyed them with interest, and Steve laughed as he led him over to the collection. “History of my people. Fairy tales. Tales from other clans. It’s a small collection. Most of the books we receive go to the public space for books,” Steve explained to him and Tony turned to look at him with wide brown eyes.
He felt like he was going to puke, his knuckles were white with strain as they held onto the edge of the worktable. Shit, Steve was right. Tony had already known that, but now there was absolutely no fighting it, no denying it. Barnes was a victim, he’d gotten a fate worse than any of the people he’d been forced to murder.
“Good morning, future Lord,” Clint greeted him with a grin before leaning over to rotate some meat they were cooking over the fire. Tony felt flattered at the greeting. He’d been groomed to be a Lord all his life, or at least the mate to a Lord, but to hear it and be excited about it was something he hadn’t expected.
“Come on. Bucky’s probably going crazy waiting for us up there,” Steve said as he led Tony off of the balcony back into the building. They made their way easily to the elevator and found themselves kissing again, against the smooth chrome of the elevator wall. Tony wasn’t sure he’d ever get tired of feeling Steve’s lips on his.
“Steve. I don’t think…he’s not really talking much,” Tony offered quietly. He was looking at Bucky, gauging his reaction to Steve’s presence. Steve’s gaze snapped to Tony, then. He seemed to understand and went still, not taking another step towards Bucky. It was the exact opposite of what Steve wanted to do, Tony could tell.
A week before they arrived, Tony was curled up next to Steve on their furs. Their small portable tent was propped up around them to cut off the bite of the outside wind. Steve’s hand trailed over Tony’s side casually and then ended up splayed over Tony’s stomach. The Omega closed his eyes and took a quiet intake of breath. “I’m not pregnant,” he said quietly, knowing his husband was still awake.
Tony surprised himself when he felt a sob wrack his body. His mother looked immediately concerned and even more saddened and wrapped him up in a warm embrace. He cried in her arms for a solid fifteen minutes before pulling back. “Ugh…I’m just proving him right. Sitting in here, crying,” he said quietly, half to himself and half to his mother.
Howard cleared his throat, obviously figuring out that Steve was awake now. “This is my son, Anthony,” Howard introduced, keeping his voice unobtrusive. “He’s also one of the brains behind your rescue. Chip off the old block.” Howard seemed proud, but Tony looked a little shocked at the man’s words.
In his grief, Tony wanted to cry. He wouldn’t give his father the satisfaction, though. He had no choice to look down, his father’s hand was strong and his gaze was forced down to his feet. Tony’s hands clenched into fists at his sides, but he didn’t dare strike.
All Alphas thought the same. They all saw Omegas as property. Best-case scenario, they saw them as people whose only duty should be mothering children for their legacies.
He didn’t protest as Steve readied the bath. He really was sore. He shed the casual clothes he’d half-heartedly put on just to be decent for their tribe when the water was warm and scented.
Pepper nodded, seeming to understand Tony’s thought process. “I agree with you, Tony. He is a very nice man, I can tell. He’ll treat you well.” She smiled a little sadly up at him and Tony is confused at first before he connected the dots.
He would trek into the woods for logs to burn at the fire. Natasha taught him how to hold a bow, and he’d grinned ear to ear when he’d come back to camp for the first time with a kill big enough for half of the people there. Steve had looked at him with a soft, proud smile from the fire, watching as Tony dragged the boar across the leaves.
Steve had found a new light, a new reason, a new home. All in one man. Of course, Steve knew he couldn’t have Tony either. Despite knowing the genius wasn’t opposed to men sharing his bed, Tony had been so damn happy with Pepper. Steve wasn’t the type of man to break something like that up for his own selfish gain.
“Yes. Maria told me just yesterday. I meant to tell you, but I wanted to wait for a good moment. She saw it, in a prophecy. Vision visited me later that today to relay the same information. I asked them both to wait to tell you, I wanted to make it special. A little boy with your hair and eyes,” he told Tony softly. He put his own hand over Tony’s, gentle. “See? The gods will protect us. They sent them the message to tell us so. Us and ours will make it through.”
It might have been too swift. He’d hoped for a little more satisfaction from Obadiah’s death. Though, he supposed that the old Alpha dying kneeling in the dirt before an Omega Lord was plenty good enough.
Tony nodded and followed his Alpha back into the tent they’d set up. Luckily, everything had been finished before the skirmish, and the invaders hadn’t gotten to their space, so everything was intact.
Steve smiled at him softly, reassurance in his kind blue gaze. Tony smiled back, his heart light. He didn’t care if the wedding was stopped right now. He would run. He would choose this man over everything he’d ever known, in a heartbeat.
“You were gone…I thought you were dead, at first, and then I thought you were lost forever no matter how hard I searched. And Tony…he was there, this brilliant light in my life that gave me a home in a strange new world. It was easy to fall for him, even if I knew I shouldn’t have. When he and Pepper broke up…well, I was waiting. Waiting for him to heal, because I didn’t want to hurt him. I was just about ready to ask him, but then…there you were that night. In the chair, looking broken and lost, and somehow you found your way home, to me.”
Part of Tony wanted to go up to the floor he’d just given Bucky and…and he didn’t know what. But he remembered the way Bucky had been; so numb to the world, only a few things bringing flashes of emotion. Tony sighed, eyes closing as he took a shuddering breath. He knew, deep down, that the monster that had killed his parents hadn’t been Bucky, but it was hard to swallow.
They grated against each other in the worst ways at first. Steve had thought that he’d gotten the worst parts of his father. Then, the walls Tony fought so hard to keep up started to crumble away, and Steve got to know the true heart of Tony Stark.
Maybe it was just phantom contractions. His mother had told Tony about that once. She’d had them with Tony. The midwife would be able to tell. He didn’t have to wait long before they were entering the tent in frenzy, Steve right behind them.
Once he parked his bike, he made his way to the entrance. A few people stopped and stared, and Steve pretended their looks weren’t full of pity. The woman working the front desk seemed shocked and fumbled, before offering to close the museum for a bit for him. Steve was grateful for the sentiment but said it was all right, that he was just going to look around.
“And then you found us…you thought you’d lost us both,” Bucky said it as he realized it. Steve nodded, affirming Bucky’s suspicions. “Well, you haven’t. You haven’t lost either of us.”
He went to sit up quickly, knowing that his crew needed him up as soon as possible if that was the case. Dizziness and stiffness in his muscles incapacitated him for a moment and he breathed out sharply.
Bucky frowned, arms crossing over his chest. “Don’t give me that bullshit. I may have been the world’s shittiest friend for not connecting the lines sooner, but I can see now that you’ve been withdrawin’. You’ve been makin’ yourself scarce around us, even before you found us like that.” There was a long silence because honestly, Steve couldn’t deny it. He hadn’t been spending as much time with Tony in the lab, all of his emotions and feelings for both of them warring in his head.
“Steve…look, your son,” Tony said softly. Steve’s eyes went soft, obviously understanding Tony’s words, but he couldn’t speak. He lifted a finger, trembling, to touch the infant’s little hand. Then, his eyes closed and his hand fell limply to his side again.
“Those who can’t train need to gather supplies in a hurry. The blacksmiths need to work double. This is the time to act with haste. If we don’t, our numbers won’t do well against Obadiah’s organized army,” Tony contributed despite his inner anger.
This was meant to strategically hold an oncoming army if need be. They still had plenty of supplies, and they sent a few people back with a couple carts as soon as they were established. They would make the trek again so they could bring back more supplies if the war went on.
“You are a Lord’s son. You don’t have that luxury,” Maria said with a shake of her head, her soft brown curls falling over her shoulders. “I’m so sorry Tony. I know this isn’t what you deserve, my precious boy, but it’s what you must do. Otherwise, our clan falls into chaos when your father passes. That or Obadiah takes over, and…well, I’d rather not have that be the case.”
Tony took a deep breath and shakily stood, his brown eyes fierce and hardened. He could feel Steve’s gentle hands on him, steadying him through his grief. Many of the people around them looked just as grieved as Tony, tears on their cheeks. It spoke to the Omega, that people who didn’t even know his parents still felt the sadness for their Lord.
There was a long silence as Tony settled into his seat. He sniffed a little as he ignored the Alpha’s presence from that point on and went to gather food onto his plate. Hell if he wasn’t going to enjoy the feast despite all of this. He could feel his father’s harsh gaze as well. He didn’t care. Howard wouldn’t dare lash out of him in front of this other clan.
“Tell me. Who else?” Tony demanded harshly, but Rumlow had fallen silent. Tony waited another moment before scoffing and moving away from him. “Take this filth to the prison hold. We’ll make his trial and execution public tomorrow,” Tony said to Rhodes. His old friend and guard nodded and forced him out of the house.
Bucky seemed to get the message. “I’ll be waiting upstairs. Tony’s suite. He’s got the biggest bed.” He wagged his eyebrows at them and laughed as he slowly walked away to the elevator. Steve’s cheeks went red again as he spluttered a bit. Tony took a little pity on him, and reached out, putting his hand on Steve’s shoulder to guide him across the room.
“My Lord, your husband has been gravely wounded. They were waiting, an ambush. We fought valiantly and took many of Obadiah’s numbers, but we had to retreat once he was injured,” Natasha told Tony lowly. She noticed the child and she gave a watery smile. “He’s beautiful,” she noted softly.
Tony looked out over the people and saw some had taken arms against others. He cursed softly and reached for his own sword at his hip. There were some in the crowd that were obviously fighting innocents. Tony quickly picked them out. His loyal people outnumbered the attackers, but the offending group was comprised of some of the most skilled warriors that Tony could remember from his tribe.
Steve’s countenance darkened considerably. He looked haunted as his gaze went from their angry, grieving people, to Tony. “A clan. Well, they call themselves a clan but they don’t have any allies. They don’t even really have land. They take what they think is theirs. They contest anyone and everyone, on the basis that they think themselves fit to rule all lands, every clan,” was his answer from his husband.
Another chapter finally! I have recovered from post-IW emotions (as well as I can for now) and I've finally gotten around to the next part!
Steve was up in a second as well, hand going to his shield. There was a quick movement, and Tony saw Rumlow’s face in the moonlight. The Alpha had a knife in hand and he was going for Tony, going for his stomach. Tony gave a cry, to alert Rhodes, and grabbed his dagger. Luckily, Natasha’s training paid off and he fought off the first couple of blows before Steve swung out with his shield.
In that same time frame, Tony readied the troops for war. Obadiah knew they were here now, though he didn’t know the exact location. The element of surprise was not on their side any longer. However, they still had the numbers. According to Natasha, the small group had managed to slay many in the night and especially imperative fighters.
Before he could even come up with their next move, there had been an asteroid coming straight towards them. It’s presence had blipped on their screens before their sensors fizzled out in a chain reaction of explosions that Steve could feel, vibrating through the USS Commando tumultuously.
“I…am sorry. For your loss,” Tony began in a soft tone, not quite meeting Steve’s gaze. “I know you probably inferred this, but you are the only survivor. What…what remains of the USS Commando and her crew are being extracted from the asteroid and preserved.” Tony looked up at him, hoping the information wasn’t too harsh.
“Surrender! You’re outnumbered. Your cause will never prevail!” Tony’s voice was slightly different in the suit. It echoed in a way, as his voice bounced off the metal. It was clear that the old Alpha didn’t recognize him.
They were getting closer too. As much as Tony was trying to fight it because frankly, it was terrifying, he was starting to actually like Barnes. And not in the friendly way that everyone else was starting to like him. Thoughts of Barnes kept him up at night. Those gray-blue eyes that had been getting softer and softer as time went on, the harshness of the Soldier getting stamped out just by being around loved ones, around friends.
Tony was fiercely protective of Peter, hardly letting the newborn away from him. He kept the newborn pressed against his chest at nearly all times. He’d put his clothes on over the bundle, and they were more than large enough, being later maternity sizes.
“Yeah. Steve. Friday, a scan, please.” The AI was smart enough not to verbally answer, just do as Tony said. He went over the results quickly, humming. It was amazing technology, but he could do better.
“It’s not…I’m happy for you both. Really, I am. It was just…a shock, that’s all,” Steve tried, giving a bit of a half-truth. It had been shocking, seeing them, but it wasn’t as casual as that. Bucky didn’t look convinced either. There wasn’t any fooling Bucky; Steve knew that. They’d known each other for too long.
“Goodnight, Steve,” he offered in return. He would have been horrified by the breathy quality of his voice if it weren’t taking every fiber of his being to make himself not pull Steve into his tent.
“I do,” came the clear, Alpha tone as Steve stared into his new mate’s eyes all the while. Tony could have cried with relief, but he held it back. The ceremony was almost over, and he did not want to weep after Steve had made such a grand gesture of equality in front of both of their clans.
The Alpha pulled away, giving Tony a bit of space as he smiled. “Goodnight, Tony.” Steve’s voice was noticeably deeper and Tony couldn’t suppress the shiver this time. The Alpha’s eyes went a little dark at that, and Tony had to force himself to take another step back.
“Well? I saw you talking to the Lord and his people all night. You looked like you were having a great time,” Pepper prefaced as she got everything ready for his night. She didn’t say anything after that, knowing Tony would talk about it if he wanted.
With little to no sleep, Steve had made his way out of the tower before the sun had even begun to rise. He couldn’t be here; it felt so stifling for some reason. He needed to get away, be somewhere else physically and mentally for a little while. He didn’t want the team to notice. He was supposed to be the strong one, the one who always knew what shots to call. He couldn’t look weak in front of them. Completely forgetting about how he’d left the gym the night before, he set out on his bike, mind swimming.
“I’ll pick you up at your floor at 8. Don’t forget about it.” Bucky knew that Tony often lost time as he worked. Tony regarded him fondly as he leaned back against the worktable.
Later that night, Tony and Steve met with the Rogers clan council. The only two surviving members are Nicholas Fury and Maria Hill. Maria was young to be on the council board, but she was touched by the gods, had premonitions that made her wise beyond her years. It reminded Tony of the gifts the High Priest of the Stark clan had. He’d been glad to see Vision among his supporters today.
It was so silent, and Steve almost didn’t want to concentrate on his surroundings. He finally did and he almost choked on his emotion. There were a lot of original furnishings, and Steve had to wonder how in the hell they’d managed to keep them standing all these years. They’d barely functioned as fixtures in the 30’s and 40’s.
“Surrender, and I’ll make your execution swift. Retaliate further, and you’ll be dragged to the North by your feet,” Tony said through clenched teeth. Obadiah was silent for a long moment. Tony waited, not knowing if this meant that the Alpha would give up.
The redhead smiled at Tony, almost conspiratorially. “Natasha, Steve’s Head of Guard.” Tony’s eyebrows shot up at that. An Omega? Head of Steve’s entire military after him? He almost spat out his wine but managed to swallow without choking embarrassingly.
Tony’s armies went around, putting out all the fires and shackling those who were left. There were some innocent parties, Omegas who had been forced into imprisonment. Children and families of radicals who hadn’t been allowed to escape. Those people were brought to their field medics and taken to a carriage or cart to rest.
He sat down and rested, but he didn’t stop looking over to Bruce working frantically to save his husband’s life.
“Young Steven has agreed to meet to discuss a possible marriage, as well as the merging of our two clans when I pass. Luckily, he just might be desperate enough to take you, considering the population of his clan is so thin,” Howard growled out.
The ship had lurched out of warp drive, leaving them in the middle of uncharted space. It had happened so quickly, that Steve wasn’t even sure of the cause.
An alarm sounded, and Tony hadn’t expected to catch the clan by surprise at all. There would be no formation though. Tony didn’t care about honor. He’d burn these traitors and murderers to the ground.
Tony went and placed a flower on each coffin. He stopped for a little longer at one of the too-small graves. He knelt in the dirt by it and tried not to cry. Just whispered a little prayer for the small soul. The parents watched him, looking absolutely devastated but grateful for Tony’s words.
“So, you wanted to talk?” Tony asked, helping Steve along again. He knew this wouldn’t be easy, but he had a feeling where this was all headed. They all liked each other, but Steve was worried Tony wouldn’t want that. Which was absolutely insane. Of course, he wanted it. He was barely keeping himself from just dragging Steve to the bedroom, already. But he needed to be patient. This was something Steve needed, to hash it all out. So Tony would let him talk, and he’d listen if it made Steve feel better.
Tony counted thirty-two coffins. Some were too small, and he had to look away from them. Anger and grief surged in his heart as he saw the few that were so small that they were easily lifted above a grieving parent’s shoulder. Obadiah would pay for this. He and his whole faction would burn.
Steve just sighed and didn’t offer anymore protesting. It was clear though that the Alpha wanted to keep insisting that Tony stay. But really, what could he do? Tony had made up his mind that he was going to fight. Steve would just have to do his best to keep his mate and child alive at all costs.
Tony kissed back, hands curled in Bucky’s shirt as Bucky smiled against Tony’s lips, and backed Tony up to the workbench, hands wandering. The other man was warm under his hands, muscles, softness, and slight curves in all the right places.
“They…they used the Winter Soldier to carry it out,” Steve finally revealed. Tony felt a lot of things in that moment. He wasn’t sure if he was angry, grieving, or feeling betrayed. It was probably a good dosage of all of those things. Bucky had killed his parents. Steve had known. The S.H.I.E.L.D information drop, no doubt.
“Tony,” Steve greeted, with that wondrously smooth Alpha voice that Tony wasn’t sure he’d ever tire of hearing. Just the tone of it struck something in him, something baser, his inner Omega preening at the attention. It would have sickened him if it had been any other Alpha, he realized.
He shuffled down to his lab, nursing his wonderful mug of life-elixir. He paused just for a second when he saw Bucky sitting on the couch he had down there, reading something on a tablet. He couldn’t help the soft smile that bloomed on his face when Bucky lifted his head and grinned at him.
Some resolution, finally. There was so much baggage, I thought Bucky and Tony deserved some time to hash things out with Steve alone.
Bucky stared at him for a moment, looking like he couldn’t quite believe Tony’s doubt. “Is that honestly what you think you’re worth? Tony…you’re brilliant. You’re hilarious and devastatingly gorgeous.” Bucky paused, and Tony felt his face heat up. When’s the last time someone called him gorgeous? He couldn’t even remember.
“Public space? You allow everyone?” He asked, even though he already knew the answer. Of course, he did. Steve fixed him with a soft look, and there’s some sadness to it as well. Tony knew that Steve hated the fact that his Omega had suffered such a loss of rights.
Howard took a deep breath and actually seemed to calm down a little, much to Tony’s surprise. “There. That wasn’t so hard, now was it? Your disappointing subgender could be useful if you’d just act like you’re supposed to,” Howard said, his voice now sickeningly, falsely fond.
Rumlow grimaced at her. She was an Omega as well, and Tony knew that High Priestess would never be granted to an Omega in the Stark clan. “I will not answer to you, whore. You are no speaker of the gods. You do not deserve your station,” he spat at her.
Steve surprised himself by letting out a soft laugh. The word ‘wreckage’ should have bothered him, and honestly, it did, but Tony’s soft humor was blissfully distracting him from the shock and pain.
Sam Wilson was a Beta, one of Steve’s best friends from childhood. He was a natural fighter, but since the loss of his mate, he hadn’t wanted to take charge of their hunts and fights. He’d conceded the position to Natasha easily when she’d come along. Tony didn’t ask for details. If he were to marry into this clan, he’d find out on his own soon enough.
“Tony, can you tell me where I am?” Steve asked, knowing it had to be a planet, but he couldn’t possibly know which.
“Tony…there’s something you should know. Something I should have told you a while ago when I first found out,” Steve said lowly. Tony’s heart raced impossibly fast. Whatever this was, it wasn’t anything good. Steve was a generally serious person, but not like this. This was something else entirely.
For some reason, he didn’t flee, and he was temporarily frozen in place. He watched as Steve cooked, the broad-shouldered blond humming to himself as he went about the chore. Bucky’s body and mind both faltered, as he rethought his plan. He was tired, and he was confused. He couldn’t remember things, but some memories came back in harsh, startling clarity. He didn’t want to run.
He remembered a report of dissension down in engineering, and then the alarms started blaring. Something or someone had hit the core and in that moment, all systems were failing, including life support.
“No! Don’t you understand? This is our only chance. When his patrols don’t return tonight, he’ll be suspicious. He’ll send larger forces our way tomorrow night. It’s now or never, Steve.” Tony wouldn’t let all of their planning and training go to waste.
“I will never surrender to you, Omega. You’ll have to kill me here, or I’ll do it myself,” Obadiah said gravely. Tony took a deep breath and aimed right between Obadiah’s eyes. There was no point in dragging this out, no point in waiting. The longer this man lived, the longer his horrid ideologies inspired what was left of Hydra’s infection of the Stark clan.
Steve looked torn but he eventually nodded. He let Tony’s hand drop and stood. Bruce told him before he left that this was no phantom contraction. Tony was having this child, tonight. Tony felt nervousness light up anew in him. He’d been somewhat hopeful that it was just a false alarm.
He was driven out of his thoughts by Obadiah’s voice, talking to Steve in quiet tones. He was immediately on high alert. He’d seen Obadiah’s looks, knew how he truly felt about Tony taking the throne. He walked closer to his Alpha, standing by his side. Obadiah fixed him with a sickly fake smile.
At the head table, set up on a wooden decorated platform, he saw his father on his throne, his mother sitting on his right side. On his left, an empty seat for Tony, and next to that empty chair sat Steve. He was chatting with a redheaded woman lowly, a small smile on his face. She smiled back, and Tony could tell already that she was fiercely loyal to her Lord.
“So. Wanna grab dinner tonight?” Bucky asked in a low voice and holy hell that was literally right behind him. Tony turned and his eyes went a little wide as he saw Bucky standing close, a roguish grin on his face. Was he asking him out? Was this seriously happening right now?
Steve tried to push his panic down as he left the workshop. His hands were shaking, breath coming in short gasps as he made his way to the gym. It was late, but he needed something to do, needed to sort out his feelings, and this was one of his sure-fire ways to deal with his issues.
“I’ll try, but I can’t promise it,” he told his Omega. Tony understood of course. He winced as another sharp pain laced across his stomach. Steve moved even closer. “We have to get you to the tent,” Steve told him quickly.
There was a tense silence, much like the last hour or two of this night had been. Bucky looked downright flighty. He very obviously wanted to run, not comfortable around Steve quite yet. Tony could tell Bucky knew, deep down, inherently, that Steve was good, that Steve meant safety. But he was probably feeling guilty too. There were a lot of charged emotions between them.
“I hope the ceremony happens soon. I’m eager to leave here,” Tony admitted softly. He’d miss his mother, though he wouldn’t miss anyone else. Those he cared for, he was taking. That would be a part of this agreement. Surely his father wouldn’t disallow him to take a small handful of people as an entourage.
When he felt a tentative brush of lips, his first reaction was to lean into it, kiss back. Kissing Bucky was somehow simultaneously everything he’d imagined and nothing like he had expected. It ran so deep like they’d done this a thousand times without knowing it. At the same time, it was new, exhilarating, and Steve wanted more.
Tony nodded, agreeing. “Okay, let’s talk. You want Bucky with us?” The last thing he wanted was to make Steve uncomfortable again. He was dying to know what had happened, why Steve had been so upset, and why Steve and Bucky seemed so chummy now. Steve looked over at Bucky, happiness dimmed a little bit by the slightly regretful look that crossed over his features.
One calm night, a month into their travel, he finished a final touch on his suit and let it cool on a foldable workbench (something that he had invented). He put his hand on his stomach and sent out a silent prayer. Please, protect my child. I want a good life for him.
The last thing Tony needed was for him to be secretly in love with someone else. He couldn’t do that to his friend. Not after Pepper, not after everything Tony had been through and lost. He wouldn’t be one of the people to betray him.
Steve gave him another moment still, before sliding further and further in. Tony moaned, soft and breathy as he felt the beginnings of the Alpha’s knot against him. He was so, so full. It felt amazing. He was claimed, in all the best ways, his inner Omega purring at having such an amazing mate. Tony thought he’d be disgusted with himself for such thoughts, but he wasn’t. He wanted in a way that he didn’t know was possible.
Whew! Chapter 5! The plot is rolling now! I appreciate everyone who reads, leaves kudos, and comments!!
“Good morning,” Tony greeted in return before sitting next to Natasha. She smiled at him as well. A few passing Alphas stared at them, and mostly Natasha, who wore the red and blue dual colored feathers in her hair that indicated her status. It was quite a topic of gossip and Tony knew that many of the traditionalists disapproved greatly.
“Stand back,” Tony warned his Alpha, who wordlessly did as Tony asked, fully trusting the other man. It made something warm bloom on Tony’s heart, but he wasn’t distracted fully by the Alpha. He pressed the buttons that released his weapons, the swords sliding out quickly with a metallic sound.
He couldn’t help but put a hand on his own stomach, and he felt renewed purpose. He wouldn’t let another pup die like this. He’d burn Obadiah himself before he let harm come to another child under his rule. He stood shakily and went on to the other graves, dropped roses on caskets following his path.
Steve shook his head. “You would have found a way, even without me.” Tony didn’t deny the words. He’d been resistant all his life, especially after presenting. He knew that even without Steve’s clan coming into his life, he would have done something.
“We have buildings for you to stay in. Many are empty from the plague my husband’s people suffered. We’ll see to it that you’re all fed, and your horses too,” Tony said quietly before turning away to oversee the transition of his people into Steve’s childhood clan.
Steve suddenly remembered that all he’d known and cared about was gone. He tried not to break down again, thinking about all those funerals that had now happened almost one hundred years ago. All of those families that had wondered if they were coming home, and they never had.
He’d more or less given up on Steve, though. But that was all fine, he supposed because his heart had focused on a new man. A man of the bright, impossible future.
It took a little while, but they were finally eased. The criminal’s bodies were gone, taken to a nameless grave. Tony didn’t feel the least bit bad about it, either. The gods would never find them, they’d be lost forever, and it’s what they deserved. The innocents, however, deserved full processions.
They’d arranged this beforehand. If an uprising were to be had, if a group was to flee, a few select Alphas dedicated to Hydra and Obadiah would leave with them, infiltrate.
Tony cleared his throat and nodded, trying to take it all in stride. “Yes, it seems agreeable. Though, my father has final say.” Tony, of course, was educated, but he wasn’t usually included in this kind of talk. The Elders disapproved greatly of having an Omega sit in on council meetings.
“Bucky here had a little arm malfunction. We’ve fixed it up, haven’t we buttercup?” Tony said easily, trying to keep the air in the room a little less stifling. Bucky just nodded, still staring at Steve, icy eyes looking unsure. Tony went back to his holographic screens, making a few notes. “Why don’t we get you a place to stay, huh, Barnes?” Tony asked the damaged soldier, looking over to him.
Steve wasn’t quite privy to the joke of course, but he found himself smiling back, admiring the way the smile lit up Tony’s features and his beautiful brown eyes.
Tony nodded and then hesitated with a little shrug. “Well, technically, yeah. Since dad and I work for them. They would never have found the wreckage without my sensor technology, but…I won’t brag or anything.” It seemed very much like Tony was bragging.
“We’re with you,” Natasha spoke up, stepping closer to the ruling pair. “We will fight for you, Tony Stark.”
He didn’t even notice he was moving until he was way too close to Tony to explain away. The genius’ words stopped and the shorter man was staring up at him with wide eyes, a tiny smile on his lips. It was very reminiscent of earlier today when Bucky had asked Tony out in the first place. Bucky watched as Tony’s smiling lips parted a bit, and he took that as a sign.
Bucky really had once loved Steve. Still did, in fact, even with this budding thing with Tony. Though, he knew that Steve saw him as a friend, a brother. He’d been so in love with Peggy, during the war, and Bucky had tried not to let that hurt. He’d figured it served him right, after going dancing with so many girls as they grew up instead of admitting his feelings to Steve. He’d been a coward, afraid of Steve’s hatred and afraid of being put in jail, maybe even killed.
The two Alphas fought for what seemed like forever, Tony was afraid to step into the fray. Rumlow was swinging his knife and Steve was swinging his shield just as violently. Either one could easily hit him if he tried to interrupt.
“Good,” Pierce said as he straightened his posture. He looked down at the broken man, who was bound to a chair. Torture tools surrounded them, blood and dirt spattered on the floor.
“Something is wrong. Don’t lie to me, Stevie,” Bucky said firmly, eyes serious. “Not here.” And hell if that didn’t strike something in Steve. He rubbed the back of his neck, not sure how he was going to get out of this. He couldn’t tell the truth, otherwise he’d lose both of them, wouldn’t even have them as friends.
One arrow went straight into a man’s throat. He made a noise of surprise and fell off his horse, only to be trampled by another rider. Tony raised his aim and shot again, getting one man in the eye. He screamed, and the distraction was enough for another loyal warrior of Steve and Tony’s to skewer their sword through the screaming Alpha’s heart.
He didn’t want to be unprepared if there was a sudden attack on their troop. He’d already had to heat and add metal to the stomach section of the suit three times now. It was worth it. He wanted to be here. People looked to him for leadership, and he couldn’t let the Omega cause be dampened by the very thing that Alphas called them unfit for.
He made his way down to the lab level, looking around curiously. He paused at big glass doors, an access pad that was lit up red, locked, seemingly the only way in other than breaking the glass of the door. Bucky had at least three other ways to get inside, but he decided he should probably knock this time.
“I could say the same thing.” Bucky offered his arm to Tony, an old-fashioned gesture that honestly had Tony’s heart leaping. He took the offered arm with a shy smile. He was usually so good at this, but something about Bucky had him feeling like a sweaty-palmed sixteen-year-old picking up their prom date.
He makes himself look away because really the young man’s face is devastatingly beautiful, but he needs to find out more. “And this…S.H.I.E.L.D. This planetary government found me in the asteroid, right?” Steve asked, wanting to clear up all the details.
A soft smile, something a little more genuine than the one he’d worn for Howard, bloomed on Steven’s face. “Anthony. It is a pleasure to finally put a face to the name,” Steve greeted, and his voice was butter-soft, yet had a certain authority to it that was undoubtedly Alpha.
He adjusted the folds of dark green fabric. It swooped in a U-shape at his front and went over his shoulders. The fabric dipped low on his back, showing the olive skin of his shoulders and spine before trailing to the floor. He slipped on a few bangles and his sandals before sitting down to enjoy a private breakfast with Pepper.
Tony heard Steve draw in a long breath as blue eyes raked over his form. “You’re so beautiful. Like the gods crafted you with special care,” Steve said in a low, reverent voice. Tony tried his best not to blush from the compliment and Steve’s intense gaze.
“They believe themselves superior to us in every way. They want the enslavement of Omegas, and the massacre of those opposed to such unjust laws. We fight today for our loved one’s freedoms, and for our people’s safety. Today, we avenge the lives of those we’ve lost, and we put an end to their evil once and for all!” Tony spoke clearly, brown eyes fierce.
Then, the man looked up, catching Tony’s eye and the Alpha stilled, something flickering in his eyes that Tony couldn’t quite place. Underneath that striking blue gaze, Tony almost wavered again.
He gasped. “Pepper! You know I’m bringing you with me! Rhodes too, if my father will allow it. And Bruce. There is no way he’ll just let me go to the other tribe without some people from Stark,” Tony reasoned. He put gentle hands on the other Omega’s shoulders. “I would never leave you here.”
Steve went silent, blue eyes searching Tony’s infuriated brown. “I understand, Tony. I do. I just…I want our son safe. I’m worried about losing you, losing him. Losing both of you,” he admitted quietly. “What if you have him in the midst of battle? War is no place for a newborn.” Tony was halfway through his fifth month now. With the two weeks training and the two months travel, it was a very real possibility that Tony could have the pup in the midst of it all.
“Hey, yourself. Doing some catch-up?” Tony asked, nodding toward the tablet. Bucky often read about things he hadn’t been taught as the Soldier. He knew a lot about military history and happenings, of course. The Asset had been involved in most of them. However, he didn’t know anything about pop culture. It hadn’t been relevant in the Asset’s training.
Tony looked a little shifty, but he didn’t pull his hand away. “I…I don’t want to bring the tone of the night down. This has been great, although I have no idea why you’d be interested in a 47-year-old who’s been around the block more than a few times,” Tony admitted with a sour laugh.
“Possibly,” Steve admitted, though he was a little quicker in getting the rest of his clothing off. Tony watched, unabashed, as more smooth pale skin became bare. God, his Alpha was gorgeous. Strong shoulders, muscles that told of his power. Tony let his gaze dip lower as the last of the fabric was shed. His eyes widened a bit and his mouth fell into a small ‘o’. He didn’t have very much to compare it to, but he was pretty sure that was above average as well.
He’d done this journey once, in the dead of winter. It was June now, spring had melted the snow and grown plentiful harvests, and now summer was slowly making an appearance. And the further they went, the warmer it would get. It was vastly different than making the trip in the winter.
Tony saw his husband in the fray finally. Steve swung his sword while blocking another’s with his shield that he was well known for. Tony couldn’t help but allow himself a brief moment of admiration. His husband was a beautiful fighter, and none of the other soldiers stood a chance.
Tony felt wrong about taking off the armor, but he did so. Couldn’t very well have a child in it. Steve settled him on the bed and prepared some hot water and towels. It could be a quick birth, or it could last a day. There was never any way of knowing.
James Buchanan Barnes was standing in his lab, blue eyes eerily cold as he stared down at Tony. It was clear that he wasn’t going to attack. Especially when Bucky let his wrist go.
He felt the press of Steve against him, and then his Alpha was sliding into him. Tony gasped and went a little rigid at the new feeling. His new mate immediately stilled, looking down at the Omega to make sure he was okay. Tony took a deep breath and forced himself to relax before nodding. “It’s okay. Please, I want you,” Tony assured him, honesty burning in his brown eyes.
“Wait? No…no, we’re not waiting. I…thank you for offering that, but no. I want this. I do. I don’t want there to be any doubt in people’s minds that we’re mated. And…I’ve never felt anything for another Alpha like I do for you. Even in the short time that we’ve known each other,” Tony said honestly, his brown eyes shining in the low firelight of the tent.
A nurse broke the marked silence between them. She shuffled in and introduced herself in a calming tone, but Steve didn’t really retain it. He let her check him over. He knew the answer already. He was in perfect health.
A year passed in peace. Time went on, and Steve and Tony’s people rebuilt, healed. He found himself a year later, Peter on his hip and a hand on the slight roundness of his stomach, leaning against a stone pillar of his and Steve’s house.
“The name is Howard Stark. I’m the man responsible for finding you,” the mysterious man said with an air of confidence. Steve tried to let all of that sink in as he blinked heavily to shake away the last of his sleepiness.
Steve nodded, a pensive look on his features. “So now, we must act quickly. He’s expecting his plan to work. He’s expecting news of the successful takeover, to have won the war before it even started,” Steve said.
Obadiah did actually look around. And what he saw was the clan burning around them. Tony and Steve’s people vastly outnumbered Obadiah’s. With those who had defected from Obadiah’s rule, and with the losses Obadiah had suffered three nights ago, the numbers were clearly on Tony’s side.
He didn’t know where Steve was, but he didn’t have time to look for his husband. He stepped forward, his suit making soft whirs. He aimed his hands and started firing at the attackers.
The arm would spasm here and there, causing Bucky a bit of pain. Tony would almost immediately recognize this and quickly learned to notice the signs before Bucky could try brushing it off.
The tent fell silent, as it was just the three of them inside. Tony heard the shifting of guards outside. He heard Sam’s voice speaking to whoever was sharing his watch with him. Good, he was probably with Clint or Natasha then. He felt safer knowing they were on watch.
Hot tears immediately started to roll down his cheeks as he took in the scene. It seemed like a dream, and he was shocked into silence for an instant.
“I…well…yes, of course.” Is what ends up coming out of his mouth. Very eloquent. What was he meant to be doing again? Oh, right. He was meant to be chasing this Alpha away with his utter improper behavior. But…the Alpha seemed amused.
Howard shifted and gathered some notes. “Tony, I’ll send a nurse in now that he’s awake again. Feel free to catch the Captain up on…well, everything,” the man instructed. He probably sensed that Steve preferred the company of his son.
Tony smiled, amused by the Lord’s neatness. “Do you plan to fold our clothes every time we mate?” He asked lightly as he lounged back onto the bed. Steve looked over at him and smiled warmly.
Tony seemed to consider this, trepidation growing in him. He’d never heard of this group of people, and now it turns out there had been Hydra members in his own clan? Maybe for his entire lifetime? And this small group was probably only the beginning of their influence in his childhood clan.
They spent two days with their celebrations before packing things up and making the long, hard trek home. Luckily they had more than enough supplies to get them through it as the temperatures got colder.
“Some of the people claiming to follow me may not be telling the truth. It would be an easy way to win the war. Take advantage of our kind natures and have me and Steve killed in our sleep,” Tony said sourly. He thought of Rumlow. He’d been surprised to see him there, and a few other Alphas who had given him trouble growing up.
Comments and kudos are always a wonderful motivator! Please, if you enjoy the story, take the time to write a little comment! It truly makes my day and it lets me see how you guys are enjoying it or if you have any suggestions!
It had hurt more than anything to leave Peter in the tent with Steve. Bruce had promised he’d watch over them both, and give his life for theirs if it came to it. Tony hoped that it wouldn’t come to that.
“Tony…I. I think we need to talk,” Steve said softly, and Tony raised an eyebrow at that. Usually, that was never a good thing to hear, but Bucky looked calm and there were still happy smiles on both of their faces, so he assumed that Steve didn’t mean for it to sound so relationship ending and menacing.
At that moment, Steve felt dread pool in his stomach. He was an expert tactician, and he knew how to gain knowledge of his surroundings and situation quickly, and he did not like what his brain was adding up.
Steve gave him a long look as if he was thinking through what to say in his head before he said it out loud. In fact, that was probably what he was doing, after earlier today. “I do not wish for you to be forced into this,” Steve said seriously. “I want your full consent. If we’re to mate, I don’t want you to be unwilling.”
“Friday?” He tried to see if the AI was still up and running. He was met with silence. Great. He probably wouldn’t be able to alert the team, either. Whoever had made it this far was good. Too good to forget about bypassing the emergency signal that went out to all members if there was a sudden outage in Tony’s lab. Tony dropped his tools carefully and turned in his chair, only to let out a terrified shriek as he saw a man standing directly behind him. He picked up a nearby wrench and swung blindly, but a gleaming hand caught his wrist.
They marched through the paths that led to the Stark clan. Natasha, Clint, Sam, Pietro, and Wanda were all flanking him at the front. It took a good few hours to get there by walking horses and on foot, but Tony soon saw the flags of the Stark clan. The symbol had been painted over in red, a horrid skull design replacing it.
Steve’s jaw clenched, and it was so very obvious he wanted to protest, but he didn’t for now. They shared a look that meant this conversation wasn’t over. Fury and Maria had fallen silent as they observed the disagreement but wisely didn’t offer input.
Steve hummed and nodded beside him. “We’ll need to keep an eye on all the refugees. They aren’t to be treated any differently. Guards can be placed by their homes. Those who are innocent will see it as protection. Those who are not…it will hinder them,” Steve declared. Tony nodded in agreement to his husband’s thinking.
The wedding night. He’d totally forgotten about this aspect. It wasn’t as if he didn’t want to be with Steve. Quite the contrary, he wanted this Alpha more than what was probably good for him. He was just nervous. He’d never been with an Alpha. He didn’t know what to expect. He was sure Steve would be careful, though.
“I’ll never let harm come to you, I promise,” Tony whispered with tears in his lashes. The boy curled his little fists and kept on crying. Bruce laughed with some relief as he watched the two for a moment.
“We have to stop this. I won’t let these people get away with ruling on my father’s land. Our land,” Tony said very seriously. “Whatever we have prepared, it has to be enough. Obadiah won’t wait any longer once this news gets to him. He’ll come in full force. And I’d rather be the one to surprise him.” Tony looked up at his husband to see if the other Lord agreed.
“Okay,” Tony croaked out. He was shaking, still so angry. He looked over to Steve who was looking beyond relieved. “Thank you for telling me,” he added. He didn’t mention how it had taken Steve a little too long to tell him, but he was grateful that Steve had told him before Bucky had stayed here any length of time.
“You like him too, don’t you?” Bucky pressed as he guided them to the rickety table chairs, somehow having wordlessly sensed Steve’s need to sit down. They creaked as the soldiers sat like they might break under their weight, but whatever. They were their chairs anyway, dammit.
He lifted one of his gauntlets and fired one of his arrows straight between the man’s eyes. The body slumped to the ground, still and inanimate. Tony turned to the other prisoner, who now had the decency to look at least a little frightened by Tony and his invention.
Still, he worried. What if he was barren? He knew that this clan didn’t hold Omega’s usefulness in their ability to bear children, but it would still feel like a defeat. And it would be a drawback in keeping Obadiah and his ilk off the throne. Perhaps, if Tony truly was infertile, he could convince Steve to take in a wayward child and claim they were legitimate.
His intended Alpha was out there. With his people, probably talking to his father at this very moment. No doubt he was waiting in anticipation to see his would-be Omega mate. Tony felt numb. He didn’t want this, he just wanted to be left alone, and he just wanted to use his mind for great things. He’d be perfectly content to ignore his body and subgender, thank you.
This was all because of the experimental serum in his blood, the very thing that had saved him as a young man, and had let him enlist in Star Fleet in the first place. That had to be why he was here. That had to be why he hadn’t gone down with his crew like he should have.
The morning came with shouting and people in an uproar outside of their dwelling. Tony and Steve shot out of bed, dressing as quickly as they could. They both made sure to grab a sword as well, and Steve grabbed his shield that he was known to wield.
He took a shaky breath as he undid the tape on his hands, left it on the floor carelessly. He never left the gym like this. He always cleaned it up, but he found himself just leaving, going back to his rooms.
When Tony woke up the morning after crying himself to sleep, he’d hastened to his lab. He didn’t want to risk running into any of his teammates, and he definitely didn’t want to see Barnes.
“Regardless,” Maria interrupted once a beat of silence had fallen over the two, “we need to move quickly. We’ll announce the training tomorrow morning. Put our best fighters in charge. Natasha, Sam, Rhodes,” she detailed.
That Omega would be his, and he would burn the Rogers’ clan to the ground. Stark and Rogers’ lands both would be under his rule, and Hydra’s influence would spread until the entire world was under its, and his, dominion.
Steve quickly backhanded the man, and Tony heard a crack of bone. Rumlow’s jaw no doubt. Tony grimaced before making a quick move, one that Natasha had taught him, throwing Rumlow’s knife across the room and pressing his own blade to the Alpha’s throat.
Steve looked a little shocked that Tony was speaking to him all of a sudden. Well, he better get used to the random changes in how Tony was feeling if he was planning on marrying him. “I did,” Steve confirmed with a nod. “She’s more than capable and proven her loyalty to me and my army more than I can count. I see no reason to keep her out of a job that suits her because of her biology,” he finished with a small shrug.
“How may I help you, Sargent?” The light Irish lilt asked. Bucky liked the voice; it was soothing. Apparently, there had been a British male personality before her that Ultron had destroyed. He was told it was a sensitive topic and to not bring it up around Tony especially.
Rumlow gave him a challenging look and Tony thought he might spit again. Steve moved quickly to bind Rumlow’s hands behind his back with a pair of handcuffs that Rhodes had produced and tossed to the Lord. Tony kept his knife where it was, nestled at Rumlow’s throat.
Bucky had met some of the team in those three days, and they seemed supportive, at least. Natasha seemed to understand most of all. They’d been through something similar, he supposed. He knew her file, had fought her many times as the Soldier. He’d even shot her, a wound she had teasingly flashed at him as they spoke quietly in Russian in the common area.
They hadn’t really talked about names. They’d been so preoccupied with everything else; the conversation had never really come up. Now, though, they had to decide. It was happening whether they liked it or not.
Another was Clint Barton. The Beta, apparently, kept claiming to be retired so he could go to the outskirts of their lands to his farm with his Beta wife and two children. Even so, he kept returning whenever they needed him. Apparently, he was so well trained that Steve didn’t worry about him missing most of the training and drills. “He could hit an apple atop someone’s head from a mile away,” Steve had said.
So he’d been the friend Tony needed. He’d watched, idly, happy enough to be an Avenger. To have a new family.
“No. It’s too soon. Guards will be on high alert tonight. They don’t know who is truly loyal. They let these people in on good faith, but they aren’t stupid. We wait. Two weeks at least, let them get complacent, gain their trust,” Brock said firmly. “We can’t afford to fail. This is our best chance to snuff out the reign of Stark.”
“Bucky.” Steve’s voice was raw, disbelieving. He took slow steps toward the other super soldier, trying to show that he wasn’t going to do anything sudden, wasn’t going to harm him. Bucky kept a wary eye on him, his countenance reading that he was feeling quite a few things, but not wanting to really deal with any of them at the moment.
“Quick! Move him in here, I don’t have another medical tent set up!” Bruce called. He gave Tony a worried and apologetic glance. Tony’s heart leaped into his throat and Peter started to cry.
Tony didn’t come out of his tent until dinner. He would have rather never come out so he didn’t have to see the offending Alpha again, but he knew that his presence was practically required. Pepper was helping him dress up his outfit more for the night and re-apply the charcoal around his eyes when the tent flapped open. Tony looked into his mirror to see who it was and sighed.
Howard had a look of shock on his face, and Tony wasn’t sure he’d ever seen his father turn that shade of red before. His father opened his mouth, no doubt to berate his Omega son, but before he could say anything, Steve’s laugh filled the air.
Tony turned to look at him finally. The genius’ big, brown eyes were vulnerable, and Bucky’s breath caught in his throat a bit. The other man was beautiful, and it was like Bucky was just now noticing this particular fact.
Their son made a noise of protest at all the uproar, and then made a cry that no doubt meant he was hungry. The Omega took the tiny child from his husband to let the pup eat, which Peter did enthusiastically.
The last two were Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. They were twins, runaways from another tribe that they refused to name. It seemed to scare them to even think about it, so Tony, of course, did not pry. They’d been there since they were young, having ridden in on a horse as children, half-dead. Steve’s mother had taken them in, and they were raised communally. Eventually, when of age, they joined the ranks of Steve’s military.
Steve looked sickened at the implications as well, so Tony took that as a good sign. “I had no idea the laws were so strict here. Stark clan is known for its prosperity. I had thought maybe they were more lenient than most.” Steve sighed and shook his head. “It’s late. And your chaperone is starting to look protective. I’ll tell your father of our agreement in the morning. No doubt he’ll be eager for the ceremony to begin as soon as possible if what you tell me is true.”
He ignored the obvious contraction, determination in his gaze. “Tell me everything you know about the defenses Obadiah has planned against a possible night raid. Do so and your death will be quick. Don’t, and we’ll keep you on the knife’s edge of death all night, maybe longer.” Tony left the ultimatum in the air.
“Steve.” Was the one word answer that came from Bucky, his eyes still cold, but a bit of warmth in them now. Tony let out a shaky breath.
Tony smiled at the attention and admiration. He carefully held their son, who had stopped eating and fallen asleep in Tony’s arms, as newborns do. “I couldn’t have done it without you, Steve. Without our people,” Tony answered him quietly, not wanting to wake up their sleeping pup.
Panic was abounding as his helmsman rattled off causalities from the previous explosions. The numbers and names burned in his mind as he tried to concentrate on saving who was left.
“Tony, you should have woken me. You’re in no state to be doing anything like that,” Steve admonished softly as he went to take the heavy bucket from him. Tony scoffed but let the Alpha do it. No doubt Steve would be on high alert, protective of his mate, as Alphas usually were after an Omega’s heat.
He went straight to the tent where his unconscious husband and his son were waiting. He sent a silent prayer to the gods, hoping that his husband hadn’t perished while he was gone.
“Tony…” Sam this time, looking tired and worried. “We have to let Bruce work. You have to rest, please,” the Beta begged of his Lord. Tony took a shuddering breath and let the other man lead him back to his own bed.
A little bit of surprise lit up Tony’s face, and then a soft smile. “Huh. Well, I don’t know if I should be impressed with myself too, or put out that someone did this before me.”
A question about Obadiah’s defenses was on his tongue when he felt a sharp pain in his abdomen. He just managed to bite down on the whimper that wanted to come from his lips. No…please don’t let this happen now. They were so close, they just needed some information and then they could attack tonight.
He sunk down into it with a sigh, letting his muscles relax. Steve joined him and they slowly cleaned off the smell of heat sex and let the warm water soothe their tired bodies. When the water started to cool, they were quick to get out and cover themselves with furs. It wouldn’t do to risk getting sick, though their hearth was still burning and kept the room warm.
He raised his chin up at his father, a little defiant, and he knew no good could come of that either, but he did it anyway. He could see the fire raging in Howard’s eyes. The older Alpha man had probably consumed a little too much mead tonight, no doubt. That always got him going. He’d lament about not having a proper Alpha heir to his clan, how he’d be leaving their people to chaos when he passed.
Bruce and the midwife gently talked to him, getting him through it. Tony bore down on the pain, and he wished, prayed, for Steve to come rushing in at the last moment. For the mission, and the war to have been that swift.
Steve was silent for a moment, fingers running over the iron metal. “Tony, it’s amazing,” he said. Tony grinned and did a quick turn around, the sound of gears working around his body softly filling the room.
Tony nodded, and Steve appreciated that the younger man was trying to be as normal as he could. The pity was to be expected, sure. Though, Tony was still somehow drawing him in, making him laugh even in this horrifying situation.
Steve hummed and smiled as he took Tony’s hand in his, threading their fingers together. It felt so natural. They slotted together perfectly. Tony felt love bloom in his chest. “Well, then. Let’s get to packing. If we rush, we could be on our way by week’s end.”
“Ready to comply,” answered a scratchy voice. A voice that was either not usually used, or one that screamed far too much. Perhaps it was both.
He stepped out of the folds of fabric with now bare feet and crawled into the warmth of the bed. The furs were soft on his skin and he couldn’t help but run his fingers over them. He watched as Steve picked up his wedding garment from the floor.
This only confirmed Tony’s fears about Obadiah wanting the throne. Now, though, with the wedding impending, there was nothing to be done. The succession was clear, especially if Tony fell pregnant soon after his and Steve’s union.
Tony let the wrench clatter to the floor, still in shock. They stared at each other for a long moment before Bucky moved to a nearby chair and sat down. He presented his arm on the table wordlessly, and that’s when Tony noticed it was damaged. The plates were bent and kept shifting. Bucky’s face kept twitching a bit. He was in pain.
Steve’s eyes widened, and Tony could tell he was afraid. So was he, honestly, but he didn’t want to admit it. “I can’t let this stop me. We’re so close. We’re going to attack, tonight!” Tony said desperately. He knew he couldn’t go, not while in labor. But he was desperate not to hear that.
He winced and held Peter in a better embrace, so it’s not only the sling that is supporting the fragile child. His heart hammered in his chest, worried that something was wrong, that they were under attack.
They knew that an announcement like this was in the works, and many had guessed already that they were going to hear that there was going to be a wedding and a royal one at that.
“What will you name him?” Steve asked. The Alpha doesn’t even think of naming the child himself. He’s leaving it to Tony, and it just proves to Tony even more that he’s the perfect Alpha.
He slowly made his way up and noticed most of the other apartments were closed off to the public. It was an old building and not a very large museum. No doubt they didn’t have the money to renovate the whole thing. People stared as they passed him on the stairs, and seemed to part like the red sea. Steve tried his best to ignore it.
Steve took a rattling breath and fought off another wave of tears. He’d have time to grieve later. He wanted the other questions rattling in his head to be answered now. “How long…” He barely manages to gasp out the partial question.
The trip got colder, too. Tony had to abandon his silks not two weeks into the trip. He used them for more important things. It had been strangely gratifying when he’d taken one of them, a soft lilac, and ripped it up so he could use it to wrap a wound Sam had gotten from his horse bucking him off. He’d caught Natasha staring at him that time, a pleased glint in her eye.
“Don’t know? Don’t know what?” Tony asked, feeling a little caged from Bucky’s intense stare. He had a terrible feeling go through him, though he wasn’t sure why. If Bucky was going to answer, he didn’t get the chance to. The doors to his lab slipped open, and there were heavy footfalls. Bucky tensed in his seat, but he didn’t dart.
He cradled the crying child in his arms and rocked him, humming and purring soothingly like a mother does. He’s a mother. It hits him hard all of a sudden, like running into a brick wall. He had a son, and he’s a mother.
Obadiah was more than likely the culprit. Maybe even the elders and other Alpha leaders were behind it too. The people who had watched him grow, who had raised him, taught and governed him, had betrayed his family.
“Hello,” Tony greeted sleepily. Steve reached over and threaded his thick fingers into Tony’s soft brunet hair. Tony closed his eyes and let out a soft purr.
At another fire not too far away, Obadiah Stane watched the intended pair with fierce eyes from the shadows. “I can’t change Howard’s mind about the union. I’ve told him, that Alpha is far too liberal, but he won’t reconsider,” Stane told Brock Rumlow, the Alpha son of one of the council members. Rumlow gave a scoff into his wine as he finished the last of it off.
“You said ‘we’. Who is ‘we’, exactly? If your colony is new to the UFP, you must have another government in place,” Steve reasoned as he looked to Tony for the answer.
“Yes? You were saying how useless I am in a fight. Shall I let you repeat it while you’re choking and drowning in your own blood?” Tony seethed, pressing just a little to draw a thin line of blood.
He was allowed access to the forge as well, and he delighted in metalworking. He upgraded some of the military’s gear, as well as creating little cogs and pieces to work for weapons. He was allowed to flourish here, and he had a supportive Alpha along the way.
“Somehow, by the grace of all the gods, someone has accepted my offer to take you.” When Howard said this, Tony’s gaze immediately goes back up to his father, brown eyes wide with fear.
She didn’t recoil. She walked to him, to stand in front of him, her eyes glowing with a fierce red power that honestly startled Tony. “The gods compel you to tell the truth. You offend them with your words. How. Do. You. Plead?” She asked again. With a little flick of her wrist, a red tendril of power flashed over Rumlow’s face.
Tony whirled around to face him, eyes burning with anger. “I will not stay here. I cannot. Don’t you understand?” Tony yelled, not caring if anyone heard them beyond their stone walls. It was unlikely anyway; they had a rather private plot of land.
“That was amazing,” Tony finally said, as they both became a little more clear-headed. Steve huffed a laugh and peered at him with kind blue eyes. Steve’s large hands ran over Tony’s back and over his hips. “And I really don’t want to fall asleep on your knot on our wedding night, but I think I might,” Tony admitted tiredly.
Tony looked at the Lord with wide eyes, still in complete disbelief. “This…sort of thinking. It’s common for your clan?” He wanted to know more, desperately so. Could it be? There were people out there who let Omegas do more than the housework and child rearing? A warrior! Head of Guard, no less! Not that Tony wanted that job, but perhaps this meant that Steve would let him invent!
Bucky took long strides toward him until he was very much in Steve’s space. Steve blinked. He was even more confused now as he felt one flesh and one metal hand come up to cup his face. “You don’t even know. How gone on you I was,” Bucky said softly. Steve felt his heart skip a beat. This definitely didn’t feel even remotely real, now.
“Good morning,” Steve greeted him in return, looking beyond smitten. Tony still couldn’t understand for the life of him why he would be, but he wasn’t about to question it. This was the happiest he’d been in a long, long time. He hadn’t felt this free since he was a very small child.
“I don’t understand…I do want you, Steve. Of course, I do,” Tony said softly. He hissed a little as another cramp hit him and he relaxed back in their bed. “Gods know I’ve been through enough of them on my own.”
They rushed into the clan’s lands and the battle started. Swords and arrows flew, shields clanging. People cried out in pain and rage of combat. It was a full out battle, and Tony was right in the crossfire. His suit held up well, though. He felt multiple arrows and blades glance off the metal as he fired continuously.
Steve nodded in response. “He…took it about as well as he could have. He’s been locked up in his lab this morning. I haven’t been able to get inside.” Steve told him as he sat beside him. Bucky didn’t reply, just started to eat. Steve ate with him, in companionable silence.
He leaned over slightly to kiss the top of Steve’s golden head before getting out of bed carefully. He went about getting a bath prepared, throwing simple clothes on to access the well behind their dwelling and brought in buckets of water. On the third bucket, Steve was awake and he frowned as he saw Tony carrying it in.
“Tony,” Steve’s butter-soft voice suddenly spoke, making Tony waver for just a second before he poured himself a cup of wine. “I hope I didn’t offend you, earlier.” Was the stupid Alpha still talking? Tony rolled his eyes and he almost startled as he heard a delighted laugh from the redhead, but managed to keep his wits.
With a horrible jolt, he remembered that he couldn’t have it. He pulled back as if burned, and guilt crashed over him again. “Buck…no, what about Tony? You’re happy. He’s happy, I can see it.” The absolute last thing Steve wanted to do was hurt either of them. They both deserved to be happy, and if that was with each other, well Steve would learn to handle it.
“I will. If it’s what you want, I’ll take you from here,” Steve agreed easily. Tony let out a relieved breath, shaking with it slightly. It was frightening in so many ways. Here he was, agreeing to marry this random Alpha. Agreeing to leave his clan, and all he’d ever known. Of course, he just got abused and put down here, but still. It’s where his family and clan were.
Steve’s eyes widened further. “Tony! God, you’re a genius!” The Alpha exclaimed, a proud smile on his face. He suddenly felt just a little bit better about Tony being in the fight. It was evident that he was prepared, and there was obvious extra protection around his stomach.
“Tony, you know you need to make nice with the people. They’re all going crazy out there with this visit. Your new Alpha is quite a charmer,” Rhodes said with a snort. Pepper hid a bit of a smile as Tony made an angry noise at that.
Steve nodded, looking Tony over. He reached out and put a gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder. Tony tried not to concentrate on how warm he felt from that touch, how a lot of the anger and grief lessened just from Steve’s support.
Rumlow was forced into a chair and chained there, guard on both sides. He didn’t make eye contact with Tony, and that somehow pleased the Omega.
When they got to Tony’s floor, they reluctantly separated just enough so they could get to Tony’s bedroom. Steve felt a new wave of nervousness. Was this really going to happen so quickly? Part of him thought maybe it was a bit rushed, but another part of him didn’t care. He wanted this, had wanted both of them for so long. He never imagined he could have them like this.
“The Rogers clan, from the North. Their numbers have severely dwindled after a recent plague. It claimed the life of their Lord, Joseph Rogers. His Alpha son has only been Lord of their clan for a few years,” Howard told Tony, who actually did listen for once. The Rogers clan. He’d heard of them, but the Starks didn’t usually come into contact with them. They weren’t an enemy but they weren’t allies either.
What he found in the tent was so much better than he’d ever hoped for. He made a noise of happy surprise when he saw Steve sitting up, holding their son delicately.
When the nooses were tied around their necks, Tony stepped out in front of them. He felt an odd sensation of glee as he realized he was the last thing they saw. A pregnant Omega, having defeated them in battle, taking his place as a leader of these people.
He finally rushed over to them, all the while shedding his armor. He left the pieces carelessly on the ground, not caring about anything except his family at that moment. “You’re awake! Gods, I worried that I’d never see you awake again!” Tony said quickly.
They spent a little while longer in the restaurant, choosing to share a tiramisu. They went right back to lighter topics after their brief serious discussion. They talked about the team, and Tony’s recent projects, and it just felt amazingly right.
“I was in love with him too, you know.” And that got a wide-eyed look from Tony, as Bucky shakily admitted it. “Even when he was a scrawny little guy…I wanted him, but I was a coward. I was afraid of bein’ imprisoned or killed. Of Steve turning me in, or worst of all, Steve gettin’ hurt.” Bucky took his hand away from Tony’s grip, looking down at the table again. “Anyway, he’s always…been into dames strictly, you know?” Bucky laughed sourly.
“Finally! You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that,” Tony admitted with another small laugh. He brought Bucky close for another eager but short kiss. “God! This is amazing. Think of the sex. I mean, I have been thinking of the sex, trust me. You make it really hard not to, what with all your…muscles and sexiness and just…” Tony sighed happily. “I’m rambling aren’t I?” He asked, but he didn’t seem overly bothered with his own realization.
Tony looked at Bucky for a long moment. “Yeah, I know,” Tony said softly. They shared a moment of silence together before Tony spoke up again. “I…I was in love with him, even before I met him. But maybe…maybe Steve’s done us a favor. He’s brought us together. He never meant to hurt us. You know that,” He said as he looked across the table at Bucky intently.
The man helped him back and Steve was immediately down the stairs to greet them, no doubt having smelled it. “Thank you, Thor,” Steve told the other Alpha man, who just bowed and left them in peace. Tony’s mind was whirling with confusion, and another wave of heat hit him. He groaned as the pleasure-pain sparked up his spine.
Obadiah’s body slumped to the ground, and the nearby Hydra men noticed. They gave an angry rallying cry and charged at Tony, but they were only met with an abundance of arrows from the tree line.
Steve stilled for a moment, and then shifted in their furs. “No. I don’t imagine a trip such as this would allow for it,” he answered. “You’ve been doing wonderfully, my love. I’m so proud of how far you’ve come.” And of course, Steve would change the subject to Tony’s accomplishments. He doesn’t want Tony’s mind idling on the negative.
“Tony…” Steve said softly, eyebrows furrowed. “We’ll put it off. Obadiah still doesn’t know we’re here. We could wait a few days…” the Lord started to say, but Tony shook his head violently.
“Now, with the marriage agreed upon, Steven and I will be discussing things that aren’t suitable for Omegas. You may leave,” Howard dismissed his son. Tony wanted to protest, and he could see that Steve wanted to as well, but they both wisely stayed silent. Tony nodded and quickly left the tent, heart pounding in his chest. He was getting married. And he was actually kind of excited about it.
When many of the two clans were stumbling to their tents, Steve walked Tony to his. Rhodes was standing not too far away, as he’d been assigned to be their chaperone. He gave them space, however, making sure he was out of earshot. Tony was glad for it, as he could easily ignore his best friend’s presence as he turned to face Steve.
When the cheering quieted down enough, Howard continued his announcement. “With this union, there is not only a clear and stable succession but other advantages for both of our clans. As you know, our lands are becoming depleted from our numbers.” There was a serious murmuring in the crowd. It had been a cause for concern recently. The rations had been depleting, the number of people in their clan growing too large to support.
“He will not have our lands. Our people won’t be subjected to his tyranny. This is a declaration of war,” Tony said, voice surprisingly steady despite the utter anguish in his heart. There was a clamor from the people who had heard him, largely agreement.
“Almost one hundred years…” Steve said softly, breaking his gaze with Tony to stare at the blank medical wall. He didn’t know what else to say, shock was almost immobilizing him.
Tony stood, his hands forming into fists, and then unclenching. Steve stood too, hands up, trying to placate Tony’s anger. “It wasn’t him. Not really. You know that. It wasn’t Bucky. They brainwashed him, Tony. You should see the video files. What they did…please. Please let him stay. Let him recover with us,” Steve begged, eyes wide and worried.
There was a long moment of silence as he stared the man down. Howard’s eyes turned sad, and Steve knew what he was going to say, he just didn’t want to believe it.
“He’s horrible. Are all Alpha’s that pig-headed here?” Steve asked with a scowl once they were out of earshot. Tony huffed a bitter laugh and nodded.
He took a few moments, but he finally told her in a slightly shaky voice as she took off the first of his bangles. “I’m marrying him, Pepper. I’ve agreed to it.” He looked over at her and sees her slight surprise.
Steve nodded and gave him a soft look. He reached out and touched Tony’s arm. He was still weak, so he couldn’t move much. “It’s okay. It had to be done,” Steve said softly as if reading his Omega’s mind. “I’m here for you. I know that battle is traumatic.”
“I don’t think he’s very good at waiting for the right moments,” Tony joked, even though there were unshed tears in his eyes. Steve smiled fondly despite his own sadness. There’s a moment of silence that passes between them, both hesitant to be apart.
Tony gave a derisive snort. “Good people! He called our marriage ‘business’, Rhodey. Business! Like I’m something to be signed over,” Tony shook a little in anger. Rhodes sighed and shifted, the metal of his armor shifting with him.
He peered up at the man who had spoken. Human, from what Steve could tell. However, he didn’t recognize him as one of his crew. He had a relaxed nature about him, salt and peppered hair and a mustache.
Tony started to cry in earnest. “Please, Steve. Don’t leave us. Don’t you dare do this to us,” he said with a wavered voice. “You hear me, Alpha?” Tony demanded of his husband, but Steve didn’t stir again.
He knew if his mother were here, she’d be telling him that Steve was right. That Tony should let that anger go, and help where he could.
Tony watched Steve leave with regret. He wasn’t sure which he wanted more, for Steve to stay here by his side, or to be able to follow him into battle. He huffed and leaned his head back. He couldn’t believe that it happened like this. All that training, all the traveling, just to stay behind on the pivotal night because apparently, his son couldn’t wait one more damn day.
“And you are?” Tony only addressed the redhead, sipping his wine casually. Steve sighed and looked like he understood that he’d made an error and deserved the silent treatment to a certain extent. Steve grabbed his own wine and took a drink.
A month passed, and Tony only grew more with Steve’s child. The healers said he was healthy, as was the baby. The Omega hoped that stayed true through the ordeal. It looked very much like he’d have to fight a war while heavily pregnant. He was five months along now, and it became hard to hide the bump, even with thick furs.
“Now. I’m getting older. And because of your failure to present how you should have, we’re going to have to involve an outside clan, as you know,” Howard said with a little more sourness. That was better. Tony was used to that tone.
Steve had tried to talk to him a few times, see what he remembered. Bucky hated the sad look Steve got whenever Steve would talk about something and then notice that Bucky wasn’t remembering. It made Bucky avoid him a little, just so he didn’t have to try and pretend to be someone that Steve knew. It wasn’t that he didn’t care about his friend’s feelings. He did, which is why toward the end of the third day that Tony had shut himself up in his lab, Bucky decided to do something about it.
He spotted the universal translator from across the room. So, that’s how they could understand each other. It looked almost like Federation issue, but it was different. Tony tracked his gaze.
“Today we march to attack a clan who has unjustly slaughtered our people,” Tony began, and a hush fell over the crowd that was gathered. All able to still fight looked up to him, armored and grim-faced.
“Now we wait. I sewed up all the internal damage I could see, stopped the bleeding. It’s up to the gods now,” Bruce told the omega. “I’m in the next tent, Tony. You call for me if anything changes, with any of you,” the doctor instructed. Tony nodded, somewhat numbly.
It had all been worth it. The sacrifices they suffered had lead to this. These were Tony’s thoughts as he watched his people move about their day. Children running happily in the streets. Omegas free and joyful, smiling as they headed to the library.
Steve shook his head. “It’s terrible. I don’t understand how they could shut down an entire third of their population. Our bodies work differently, but our minds are the same.”
Rumlow regarded him for a moment. “Indeed. Hail Hydra,” he spoke quietly. Obadiah raised his wine glass to the words and took a sip, his steely gaze still on Tony.
“Thank you,” he said to the air, to the gods. He didn’t understand them, they weren’t explainable, they weren’t tangible, but he thanked them nonetheless. He knew one thing for certain. Despite their apparent blessing, he wasn’t going to rely on them. He had his suit, he had his training and he would burn anyone who tried to harm his child.
His husband was silent, save for the deep sounds of breathing. Tony watched the rise and fall of his mate’s chest and eventually fell to his knees. He was weak, tired, and heartbroken.
It was with these thoughts in mind, that he found himself staring at Tony as the genius stepped into his workshop and immediately started to explain something animatedly. His hands were flying around everywhere, his brown eyes bright with knowledge. It was beautiful.
“Captain Rogers is not currently in the building,” Friday answered crisply in her Irish lilt. Bucky cursed and pressed the button for Tony’s floor. They had to find him. Something was terribly wrong here.
Steve isn’t even sure how that had slipped out. He supposed his subconscious was realizing that he had to tell the truth. Bucky would know, and it would only strain them further. Best to just get it out of the way, and deal with the awkwardness later.
Tony hadn’t been surprised. “He’s always been a supporter of my father and Obadiah’s harsher laws against Omegas. He would never follow me,” Tony told him. Nick looked sick at that thought, but let it go for now.
He leaned in and kissed him, fully and eagerly. He realized then that he’d wanted this for weeks, months, and he was finally letting himself take it. He wasn’t going to be a coward this time.
The High Priestess looked content with this answer and stepped to the side, addressing the judges and the crowd again. “Will our witness please step forward?” She asked, her voice a little airy.
Bucky decided the gentlemanly thing to do would be to walk Tony back up to his floor. He went to press the button for Tony’s suite, but Tony’s had stopped him and pressed the level for his lab instead. Bucky fixed him with a disbelieving look.
“Friday. I want everything you can find on the Winter Soldier. And I mean everything,” Tony ordered sharply, the sound of his voice heavy in the silent lab. The AI gave the affirmative and got to work. It took a good half hour, but soon he had the files. Videos, notes, mission reports. He started to read, not quite ready to watch anything yet.
He didn’t, though. He kept making confident steps toward the Alpha, not averting his gaze in the slightest. No doubt his father was already angry with him, for not approaching in a demure manner.
“Fine,” Tony said, breaking himself out of his own reverie. “I’ll give him one more chance.” He looked back up at the mirror and deemed himself to look good enough. Pepper and Rhodes flanked him, as he left, walking toward the communal fires that were roaring for tonight’s feast.
“Your language is beautiful. Especially coming from you,” Steve said softly. Of course, Tony couldn’t understand him, so the other man just laughed and turned it back on.
“We won’t let it come to pass,” Steve finally decided on. “We’ll end this war quickly. No more children will die because of Hydra.” God, Tony hoped that was true. He put a grateful hand on Steve’s, where it still rested on his belly. He picked up his fork and forced himself to eat.
“Apparently, we’re starting to become technologically advanced enough that they’re considering adding us to the list of Federation planets. And then…we found you. Our sensors picked up an asteroid headed our way. It would have been devastating, had we not developed tractor technology some 50 years ago. Anyway, we sensed a life form deep in the ice of the asteroid. You.” Tony shifted as he took a breath, looking up at Steve to make sure this wasn’t too much at once.
“Not you too! He is not my Alpha! I’m not marrying that Lord, no matter what anyone says is required of me,” Tony said with an affirming nod as he crossed his arms over his chest stubbornly.
His hand shot down to his stomach, flattening over the expanse of it. It couldn’t be…could it? Natasha gave him a shrug. “Wait a week or so. It’ll be obvious by then.” And with that, she walked away. She did turn to call over her shoulder, “You still have to feed the horses and clean up your mess, your highness!”
He’d failed his crew and he didn’t even know why. He didn’t even know how. His crew, what was left of it, spent every last moment trying to get systems operational before the asteroid collided.
Tony tensed a bit, but eventually, his shoulders relaxed and he nodded. “Sure, pop a squat,” He answered lightly as his hands waved around and moved blue holograms around. Plans for suit upgrades, among other things.
Bucky let out a soft laugh, and there were tears in his eyes, Steve noticed. “God, I know we would’ve been something if we hadn’t been born when we were. I was so scared of losing you, Stevie. Of you thinking I was sick, of getting arrested, taken away from you. Even if you agreed, which I thought you wouldn’t, I didn’t want to risk you. People might’ve killed you, and I…” Bucky sighed and pressed their foreheads together. Steve let himself close his eyes. This had to be a dream.
A soft moment of silence passed between them, and Steve smiled at his Omega proudly. He finally spoke up, as he leaned back against the pillows. “I’m so proud of you, Tony. I’m grateful to have such a strong, beautiful mate. Look at our son. You brought him into this world, all the while fighting those who would harm him. You’re remarkable,” Steve praised.
Tony was screwed. He was so incredibly screwed. His plan flew right out the window, and he didn’t even know what to think. The sound of the Alpha’s laugh replayed in his head, over and over, and it was, unfortunately, one of the sweeter sounds Tony has heard in his twenty years of life.
“Finding me? Where am I? Where’s my crew?” Steve asked, firing off a bunch of questions once his head and voice were both a little clearer.
The packing went quickly. Throughout the few days that it took, Tony tried his best not to feel like his tribe wanted him gone. He just let himself focus on the fact that he was leaving. He’d be away from this place that tried its best to put him down at every turn. Even his own father had limited his mind, his training, and his right to be a fully-fledged heir, all because of his sub-gender.
Howard raised his hands and the drum beating as well as the cheering and murmuring crowd finally settled down so everyone could listen intently to the news.
“Oh, of course. This clan is still run in the old, traditional ways. Omegas don’t have such power here, do they?” Natasha asked, casually; as if this wasn’t a huge political topic that could vastly offend a wandering traditionalist Alpha.
Bucky didn’t want to remember the past, not right now at least. The memories hurt, and he wasn’t sure what was real and what wasn’t. Right now, he wanted to heal and make a future. And this beautiful man, who was forgiving him against all odds, seemed like a very good place to start in Bucky’s mind.
“The hell I’m not,” Tony bit back, meeting Steve’s gaze, challenging. “I don’t care about my condition. Those monsters murdered my family. They murdered my people. I’m not going to just sit here while I send Alphas off to fight in my name,” Tony argued through gritted teeth.
He finally stood and stretched. Pepper smiled at him from the hearth as she fixed his breakfast. His new outfit for the day was folded over a chair and Tony stumbled to it so he could put it on.
The prisoners looked at Tony darkly, but Tony didn’t look away from their sharp gazes. “You’ll be tried for your crimes against your rightful Lords,” Tony told the prisoners before ordering for them to be taken away. They’d be shackled to one of the carts and forced to march on foot at the pace of a horse’s walk the entire way.
There was no doubt that they were among humanity, though. He’d seen them in the gifts given to people. It truly did amaze him, though he couldn’t help but be angry at the same time. “Why? Why protect my child and not theirs?” He asked, thinking about the tiny grave, the weeping parents. He didn’t want to be ungrateful, but he couldn’t help but feel that it was unfair. Why promise his son a long happy life, and cut another child’s life short?
“People of my clan, I have great news. Today, there was an agreement for my son and heir to be married to Lord Steven Rogers of the North,” he said, getting right to the point. There was mostly a renewed cheering from the crowd, many glad that Tony had finally found an Alpha.
“Well, Tony. You should call me Steve, then,” he answered easily, looking absolutely delighted at Tony’s brashness, for whatever reason. Tony was absolutely perplexed. He was floored, wordless. And that did not happen often.
It seemed as if his father wanted him gone as quickly as possible, and honestly Tony wasn’t going to protest. He wanted to leave. The thought of being with Steve and his decidedly more liberal people absolutely thrilled him. And one day, this clan would be theirs too. Their word would be law, and Omegas would have rights. If Tony had any Omega children, he wouldn’t have to worry about them.
“Where. Is. My. Crew.” Steve was starting to panic, despite his best attempts. The crash, everything that had happened before the darkness had overtaken him, was coming back to him in horrible flashes of memory.
Maria tutted and wiped away his tears. “It isn’t merely an omega thing to cry, my darling. We all have emotions, and I know you must be very scared. You’re so brave, my beautiful son. Please, at least try? I’ve heard good things about Steven Rogers. I hear he’s a kind young man,” Maria told him, trying to be helpful.
“And so? Am I an agreeable Alpha?” Steve teased a bit and Tony couldn’t help but smile along with him.
The redhead smiled approvingly, surprisingly enough, and it shocked Tony to smell Omega from her, though his smelling was inadvertent, a scent carried by a gust of wind. Steve stood as Tony came up the steps and circled around the table to sit in his seat, only sitting back down when Tony himself was seated.
He never thought that it could be possible. Sure, he’d seen them getting closer. He’d been glad for it at first. It was honestly a miracle that they weren’t at each other’s throats, considering Bucky’s past. Tony had forgiven him, and Steve had been so relieved.
“He did,” Tony answered, frowning heavily. “I…I don’t blame you. I saw the files, watched the videos. I know what they did to you.” Tony’s voice sounded strained. Bucky halted a bit at that.
“Don’t be nervous,” Natasha told him as she fitted the white and gold silks of his wedding attire around Tony’s form. “I can guarantee that Steve is more nervous than you are.” She fixed him with a small, encouraging smile in the mirror. Tony felt flattered by it. He’d quickly learned that smiles from the tough woman were hard to earn. Steve had quietly assured him that Natasha approved greatly of her soon-to-be second leader, and he could tell this just by how many times she smiled in his company.
The gods didn’t answer him, but that didn’t mean that they hadn’t heard him. Tony knew they were watching, listening. He stood and walked to his and Steve’s tent. It was late, after dinner, and most people were finding their ways to their bedrolls.
Tony remained silent and Steve sighed, knowing his answer didn’t quell Tony’s worry. “Tony. You’re lucky to not be pregnant now. The harshness of the trail would endanger the child.” He planted soft kisses on Tony’s shoulder, where the fur wasn’t covering the olive skin. “You are worth more to me than a tool to gain an heir.”
When he looked up, he noticed Natasha staring at him with an amused glint in her eyes, Pepper looking pleased as well from her spot beside the other Omega. Tony flushed brightly and cleared his throat, straightening his posture and ignoring their gazes.
Pepper held the tent flap open for him and he stepped out, charcoaled eyes scanning the gathering. There were people surrounding the middle of the communal space, all vying for a chance to see the foreign Lord. He walked through the crowds, weaving his way through the people who all stepped aside for him. As the crowd dissipated, that’s when Tony caught sight of the man he was meant to marry.
Tony lifted the faceplate of his armor and he saw their looks of shock and disgust at being bested by a heavily pregnant omega. Tony just smirked at them, relishing it. “You have no idea how satisfying it is to see you in defeat like this. You had no idea we were here, did you? We’ll be able to sneak right into the clan, and your oppressive regime will be finished in a single night,” Tony said to them, venom in his voice.
Bucky seemed to sense his fears at the end of the night. The super soldier reached over the table and took Tony’s hand in his. “Something’s wrong,” Bucky said lowly. It wasn’t a question; he knew Tony was thinking something. They’d been having such a good time, talking and laughing and flirting over pasta and the restaurant’s best merlot.
Steve gave him a weary stare, not going to easily trust whoever this was. “Who are you?” He had to ask, and the confusion of just having woken up wasn’t allowing him to ask anything else quite yet.
Howard would no doubt punish him, but who knows? Maybe it would buy Tony another couple of blissful, unmated years. He nodded again, content with that plan. “All right, let’s go,” he told Pepper and he was proud that his voice didn’t waver.
Tony and the other people from Stark had an easy transition. Some did not like the cold. Pepper complained about it from time to time. They all got used to that aspect quickly though. The atmosphere here was noticeably different. They were communal, and casual, though they kept their military and survival skills sharp. They kept their minds sharp too. Tony saw children of all ages running around with books, mothers, and fathers telling them to treat the pages with care.
The floor was padded with large furs. There was a hearth in the middle of the house, and an area to cook and lounge. Another door led to a room, full of weapons and other discarded things. Tony’s mind’s eye immediately saw the room cleaned out in preparation for a child.
While the fighters trained, the other people packed and prepared. By the two-week limit, everything was ready. Weapons, food, clothes, blankets. Everything they needed for the two-month journey and enough supplies for a few months of the camped-out war if it came to that. They would send some back to gather more supplies as soon as they got to their camp, in preparation for the four months that it would take.
It turned out that Natasha was right. In just a week, it was obvious. His scent was changed, and Steve put a knowing hand protectively over Tony’s stomach every night. It was nothing to celebrate quite yet. The early times were always fraught with miscarriage. One little fall or illness or something they couldn’t control could bring the joy down in a second.
Rhodes raised an eyebrow at him and stepped further into the tent. “Tony, be realistic. Your father is not going to stop looking for an Alpha. If he passes before you marry, half of the clan won’t want to see you in power alone. And this man…” Rhodes gave a bit of a shrug. “This man seems like good people,” he finished honestly.
Someone did come into the tent, and Tony almost went about his plan before he realized it’s just Bruce. He’s relieved for a moment before the doctor spoke frantically.
Tony closed his eyes tightly to the sound of it, the mockery of fatherly care. Somehow, he knew that even if he’d been an Alpha, he’d never be good enough. He didn’t understand why, but he knew it to be true.
“You deserve everything this world has to offer and more, Tony. You have such a big heart, you do so much for people. Even if they spit back in your face, you keep on trying. Keep doing good. Don’t you dare point out your past mistakes and use them as a reason for you to feel like you don’t deserve happiness. And don’t let anyone else do that to you, either.” Steve felt very vehemently about this. Tony tried to make it look like he brushed things off his shoulders, but Steve knew he harbored it all.
“Move. Please, Steve,” Tony begged when it became apparent that Steve was going slow, stilling more than instinct would want, just for Tony’s comfort. He felt another gush of slick and he had to bite down on his lip to keep from whimpering pathetically.
“Tony, I…you seem very okay with this. I guess Bucky really wasn’t pulling my leg,” Steve sighed shakily and finally turned to face him. His jaw was set, a determined glint in his eye that Tony was used to seeing in the field, and really that shouldn’t be as hot as it was.
A long, tense silence fell over them, Tony staring at Steve, and Steve staring right back. Tony knew that Steve meant every word. Hell, he knew every word was true. It would be so easy to blame Barnes, to lash out. But then who would he be? He’d have even more blood on his hands than he did already, and he knew…
“You ungrateful Omega whore. How dare you act like this land is yours? You lost your right to it on your Presenting day,” the other said, spitting in his anger. Tony’s amused smile slid off his face as his emotions were replaced with anger.
The trials of the leftover prisoners were grim and swift. They all hung, with no mercy shown by Tony and Steve’s people. It was a unanimous decision from all parties.
Tony took all this information in quickly. “And…when will he be getting here?” The Omega asked his father, trying to look amenable to the idea of marriage, just to get more information out of him. The more he had, the better. He was not marrying this man; he didn’t care what anyone said.
“Not now,” Bucky answered shortly. He went to the barstools and sat down as Steve made him a plate. “You told Stark?” He had a feeling that Steve would, after Bucky’s odd behavior toward Tony last night.
“Who is he? I have at least the right to know that, surely?” Tony asked of his father, crossing his arms over his chest defensively. He wasn’t stung by the fact that his father had been going to hit him. He was used to it. Though, when it came to the physical blows, Howard did always look like he regretted it once he was sober. Not that that particular fact excused him at all, in Tony’s mind.
The trip took a couple months. It was long, and arduous, though the whole company did everything they could to keep Tony comfortable. He shrugged them off at every turn, though. He wanted to be strong; he wanted to be a leader they could respect, not some whimpering Omega.
