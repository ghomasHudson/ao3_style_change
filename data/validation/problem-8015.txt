“Of course, Princess,” he inclined his head. “I am deeply sorry that I have no more information for you.”
… and then the blanket
There was a moment of dismayed silence before Sam, who seemed to be familiar with the original tale, guffawed loudly. “You're a horrible storyteller, Your Highness.”
out in a bar or at a gala or something, and these days even
Clint swore again. “If he has, how will we ever find him?”
“Are you two leaving tomorrow?” Nia asked Carol, and then Jim.
“There’s news the Rand boy is in New York,” said the man who had greeted them. “No confirmation yet, but if his crowd is spoiling for a fight--”
“What happened to me?” she asked. “Where are we?”
Nia shrieked. She couldn’t help it; she didn’t plan to do it; the high-pitched, anguished noise escaped from her throat, shrill and harsh and awful.
as you’re settled,” Nia instructed. “Both of you.”
,” Howard snapped, getting to his feet. “Is that the last time I did this, I was
Being who he was, though, he thought he might lose his mind with boredom after the first week of captivity, and spent many of his days shut in the castle with its ancient, crumbling, but still readable library of tomes. Lacking opposable thumbs during the day meant he had to spend many of his nights making sure his reading material would be accessible to his swan body – especially if it rained during a new or waning moon, so that there was nowhere he could go to light a fire to read by at night. When he had tired himself of calculating the mathematics of his flight ability as a bird, and mentally designed at least a dozen different potential flying apparatuses he never intended to allow Clint anywhere near, he started scribbling down—in charcoal, on the least interesting pages of the books at his disposal—every design for around the castle he could think of. He found himself sketching out new bow designs or tiny wrist-sheathed darts, and determinedly refused to think that it was sheer obstinacy at this point that was keeping alive his faith that he would see the people they were designed for, even one more time.
She stalked over and poked one porcelain finger into the middle of his chest, quite painfully. “You should be ashamed of yourself.”
Ty was cut off by the opening strains of the UNITY anthem, and the two of them popped out of their seats, raising their right hands in measured salutes at the flag.
“If I win, I pick your wedding dress,” Bucky said, smiling wolfishly.
It was a blessing, at least, that Bucky had been unconscious for all of this and not dragged in to defend himself against the ridiculous accusations.
He grunted, and sucked in a breath. “I have to leave tomorrow,” he said. He brushed a fingertip over her clit, and her knees wobbled. She braced herself against the tree as he kissed her again, deeply, and pressed his erection up against her palm. “I don’t want to waste our last--”
“I am no widow yet, Lord Fury,” she maintained, time after time, adamant that she and Tony had been as good as married since their betrothal years earlier.
“A knight, someday,” Natasha corrected, gingerly reaching over to grasp Bucky’s hand where it was fisted on the tabletop. She looked at him sadly for a moment while he was too upset to look anywhere other than his bowl, then she sighed and turned to look over at Steve. “Tony is a prince, and he's kind, and intelligent, and it's a very good match. He loves me, and I love him, and it's not the same, but it's better than what most royals get. We both know that. You should be happy for us.”
Thor eyed her reluctantly, but came to his decision quickly and nodded in the direction of the door. “Perhaps a more private setting then, Princess. Your man is welcome to join us.”
She bit her lip, still expecting him to wake up, to say something. When he didn’t, she turned her back to him, leaning on his box as she slid to the floor. “Today
“I am afraid it is not an ideal solution,” Thor admitted, peering down at the pendant. “It is intended to defend against enchantments being cast on the wearer – but in your case, Prince Tony, the enchantment has already been cast.”
Tony tried admirably to coax Steve into something resembling a dance, and Steve concentrated on the lines of Tony’s body as he moved and suggested how Steve should be moving – and after a little while, some missteps, and a great deal of trial and error, they actually managed to create a passable dance between them.
“Yeah,” she said, touching the little wings on the sides of her cap. “I’m a real adult, or something, now.”
“What happened?” Sam asked quietly, watching Steve from where he had curled up on the large windowsill. The last dregs of sunlight drifted down upon him even through the black and purple rainclouds hurling rain upon the castle, limning his face with a shimmering pale glow.
Summer came around again, and Tony had learned his lesson last time.
“I’m sorry, I don’t understand,” Ty replied sweetly. “Perhaps if you spoke in a more reasonable tone of voice.”
Natasha set her hand on his arm, and he noticed that his own hands were sitting frozen on the silky harpsichord keys. “He's still sad,” Natasha told him. “It wasn’t very long ago.”
Between Peggy’s lessons and Tony’s, Steve felt confident in nodding again, and saying, “Yes, Sir.”
Steve turned to him, his face dismal. “Yeah?”
“Put her on an airplane now,” Maria replied. “And I’ll come do whatever it is you want the minute she's home.”
She looked for her parents one more time, but their seats were still vacant, no matter how hard she glared.
. Tony’s eyes fly wide as soon as the sentence is finished, mirrored immediately by the baby blues opposite him. Whatever proto-teenage hormones have kept Tony frozen in place from the moment he opened his door to find this Adonis until now… they dissipate all at once with a shock of embarrassment. He slaps a hand unthinkingly over his eyes and ends up slamming his glasses—
“Almost there, Tony,” Steve called through the door, pressing his hand against the wooden panels. “We’re going to get you out, just hold on.”
He had tried not to think of this possibility, as part of his refusal to give up on Tony. Somewhere along the way, giving up on his relationship with Tony had become tantamount to admitting Tony was gone forever, and even now he struggled to even contemplate it. Was it possible that he had truly lost his chance with Tony? That after years upon years of being together but still so separate, years of Tony making no secret of his feelings for Steve while Steve was foolish and fearful and distant, that now that Steve was finally able and willing to admit that he had fallen desperately in love with another man, a betrothed prince, no less –
Nia gathered up her notebook, clutched it to her chest, and ran after her father.
“A nothing,” Bucky finished for her, quietly.
But it was Carol who came running like a racehorse across the sand, kicking up clouds behind her, in impossibly high red espadrilles that were
Before she knew it, she was on her feet, her hands curled into fists. “I didn’t
Maria got up from the table, leaned over, and kissed Nia on the cheek. “No,” she said. “But I love you.”
“What sort of power source do you mean? What kind of power would overcome the spell’s failure?” Natasha asked, staring intently at Thor.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Of course you are. And I don't think she was asking.”
But he could not expect her to turn a blind eye were he to bring men into his bed; he simply could not do that to her.
There was a sudden racket from inside the room: a great squeaking of the bedframe and some scraping sounds, then two loud
He settled her back on the ground and allowed himself to be pulled into a rib-crushing hug. She smiled against his collarbone and greeted him formally with her face mashed against his neck, commenting on his more elaborate mustache without even looking at him. He laughed and returned the formal greeting while curling his fingers through the heavy fabric of her blue velvet dress.
She snuck her own hands up beneath his shirt, sliding her fingers over his smooth chest, his well-defined muscles, and laughed as he caught his fingers on the back of her bra, unfastening it and tugging it forward, away from her breasts.
While Bucky slept, accusations flung wildly and viciously around the castle.
He looked younger than she’d ever imagined him-- though she supposed he’d only been a few years older than she was when he’d died.
“We’ll talk about it on the way,” Howard answered. “Just--” he gestured at her bedroom. “Get packed. Say goodbye to your mother.”
She tried to count the number of times in the past few days when she’d thought her life could get no worse, but this-- this, now-- this was the absolute bottom, the depth.
Maria rarely laughed, certainly not around Nia, or at Nia’s jokes. Now, she cackled gleefully. “Good,” she said. “If any of those reporters hound you, that’s what you tell them.”
“Are you already ready to go?” Maria asked. “Howard said an hour.”
Steve shrugged. “I told you, I only needed the right partner.”
Queen Maria was a sharp woman who went as soft as ermine when faced with her only child. Despite her distant demeanor, Tony was clearly fond of her. Though the queen was generally expected to keep her own company with her ladies-in-waiting, she did not want for invitations to join Tony, Natasha, and even Sam sometimes on gentle rides around the fields. They whiled away many days on these outings, and many more saw them eating lunches from carefully prepared picnic baskets, lazing down by the creek in the afternoon breeze.
Suppressing his sudden desire to act even brattier than usual to incite further use of That Voice, Tony flapped his hand dismissively at Steve. “Science doesn’t sleep, Cookie Monster.”
, but you’re not even in
Inside, fruit trees bloomed and a sparkling fountain shot water high overhead. Nia wanted to be in awe, but she couldn’t rid herself of the feeling that an entire block of the slum had taken up less space than the front lawn of the hotel.
“Stone residence,”  Ty said, smoothly, as if he were answering for someone else.
She understood it now, better than she had at twelve. But she had begun to understand where the cracks had come from, why her parents weren’t meant to be married. There they were, seemingly so similar, nearly identical, right up until that last sentence, where it turned out that their perspectives were entirely opposite.
She frowned, and reached out for it-- it was a cable or a tube, painted white like the edifice of the house, but glossier, coated in rubber, and flexible. She crawled further into the bushes, until she was flush up against the side of the wall, and traced her finger down the length of the cable, until it abruptly changed directions ninety degrees, running downward and entering the house through a small opening in a partially-recessed window.
“Howard wants you with us,” Obie admitted. “He knows how smart you are. He may not always show it, but he...he respects your intelligence.”
Blood dripped from his sliced-open elbow onto the face of the amulet under Obadiah’s keen gaze. Tony did not know how long the pause lasted before Obadiah was apparently satisfied with what he had extracted. He smirked at Tony, dropped his arm heavy on his stomach, and unceremoniously pulled the amulet up and over Tony’s head.
A month into the visit, Steve had seen Tony only a handful of times and had not spoken to him at all after the first day – the castle and grounds were easily large enough to facilitate this, and Steve was very careful. It was when Sir Alexander sent one of his pages with a message for Steve to come meet him at his manor outside the town that Steve realized he had not even told Tony that he was to become Sir Alexander’s squire, alongside Bucky.
It was no wonder his neck felt so terrible. He was a swan. A
The fireplace was crackling vibrantly in the background, and Steve had not lit any candles when he came in – so the light in the room was low, burning red and orange, flickering all around them. It danced vibrantly through his lids when Steve closed his eyes, breathing in deeply to smell Tony’s skin, his nerves shaking with Tony’s nearness. They had stopped their own pretense of a dance, standing still and wrapped up together, breathing heavily.
“Hurry,” Tony pleaded, sounding closer but not like he was on the other side of the door. “He could be back any time, he’s always here after the sun rises.”
The king and queen and all gathered looked on in curious surprise, waiting to see what the young princess would do. After a long moment, ignoring Prince Anthony’s squirming, Princess Natasha held out a tiny hand for him to take.
written on it in a looping scribble, it isn’t that hard to figure out what just happened. Steve is still beaming at him, and he hasn’t let go of his hand. He’s obviously both pleased and embarrassed by his friends’ antics, which is oddly sweet on a guy who looks like he could take out anyone who crosses him with one punch (as long as that someone is not a spider, of course).
Sam clearly took exception to that, and actually pulled off his shoe to throw it at Steve. Steve caught it on a reflex, which sent Tony further into giggles as he tried to communicate without being able to form sentences that Steve should be able to dance if he was able to display such otherwise fine motor control.
Both men turned to look at her in mild surprise and, in Clint’s case, confusion. He was still walking respectfully behind the two royals, so that Thor had to turn his head to the side to speak with him, but Natasha could feel her friend’s questioning gaze upon her back. “He's the finest archer I have ever come across,” she clarified, giving the prince an earnest look. “And highly effective in both hand-to-hand combat and espionage.”
Nia’s stomach lurched, and she realized she hadn’t eaten. Nothing, all day. She’d been too nervous in the morning, and then she missed lunch because she’d conveniently been hauled off to jail, and now it was nearing six in the evening and she somehow, somehow had made it this long without fainting.
And Nia’s world was wiped clean; everything went white.
“Loki wants Nat’s kingdom,” Tony pointed out, turning in place to stand beside Bucky, facing the other three. “Very predictable. The fake me is unexpected, I’ll admit – I don’t think that was his plan to begin with.”
He let go of Tony’s neck abruptly. Tony coughed in a breath and glared up at the ruined prince with watering eyes. “
He had never admitted his feelings to Tony aloud. He had never had the courage. Now he refused to lose the chance to cowardice. He had spent enough years in that particular prison.
But then the surgeon lifted his shirt-- displaying not a human torso, but a wide, blank screen, that blinked to life, first with static, then with an image, a blurry human face.
body pillow. They ate, played, and worked out together (Steve had claimed that Tony was ‘scrawny’ which, true, but rude). When Tony was home from class they sat around in amicable company while he worked, and Steve occupied himself with things like drawing and painting, neither of which were as hampered by the claws as Tony would have expected. Hell, they spent most evenings messing around on Tony’s laptop or watching movies together, and most weekends taking on increasingly ambitious home improvement projects, and generally, you know,
“Everything,” Nia had replied. “I like math and physics and history and chemistry and biology and art and…”  She had tried to think of a subject she
Tony stared him down, but Steve found himself looking anywhere other than at him, embarrassed and a little afraid of his own thoughts. He spoke again after a moment of silence. “Was it…” He shook himself off a little. “Did you lose anything…”
Nia nodded and started for the door. Just before she reached for the knob, she stopped, took a breath, and looked over her shoulder. “Dad?” she asked. “Thanks.”
Steve nodded, but could think of nothing to add.
“I--”  He huffed. “It’s for your safety.”
Nia.”
A question slouches up from the back of Tony’s brain and, lacking a filter, he asks as casual as you please: “Is this a date?”
Clint flushed. “I may also have aimed an arrow at his head.”
The pain was getting worse the longer he stayed away from the lake, he could feel it. His thoughts were disappearing like steam. His muscles began to seize.
“You want to
Tony’s eyes narrowed. “Okay, I might, maybe, even conceivably believe that you are my Steve given some time to process and a great big pile of evidence, but if you want me to accept that you were under some kind of spell that has been broken because I said the words ‘I love you,’ I’ve got some bad news for you, champ.”
She was alone, bobbing on the surface of an enormous sea that stretched to the horizon in all directions, the sky pink and burning overhead. She kept herself afloat by treading water, staring up at the hot sun.
They kept living in the same house, the huge house on Long Island Sound that Howard called “imposing” and Maria called “oppressive.”  But it was clear something had happened, and Nia didn’t know what. People didn’t tell children those kinds of things.
Tony looked hurt for a moment, devastated, and Steve only had enough time to feel confused at the raw pain showing on his face before it disappeared in the next heartbeat, and Tony gave him a winning smile. It did not brighten his eyes, though, and Steve hated that smile more than he hated Tony’s aloof stares.

Tony and Bucky turned sharply to look at her. “The what?” Tony asked in surprise.
Pepper pressed her lips together. “Do

), and opens his plush mouth.
“Antonium,” said Howard.
“I do not wish to sully your hope, Princess,” he said, as they descended the stairs into the grand entryway once more. His voice had dropped low in deference to the numerous castle denizens now milling all around them. “But… I feel I should make myself quite clear. My brother does not appreciate loose ends being left upon his schemes. If he succeeds in extracting the willing compliance of your betrothed, it is unlikely that he will permit him to live.”
She put her hair up in a twist, as best she could, the way Carol had showed her how, and found matching earrings in a drawer in the hotel room dresser. She was still hopeless with makeup, but she
“Yet,” she added, and left the room.
It was dismally true – for the dozen or so people on horseback who had accompanied King Howard and Queen Maria to Natasha’s castle, there was no sign of a single one of them. Steve’s stomach clenched when he realized… they must all have gone over the cliff.
Thor looked at her placidly, as they walked astride. “I would imagine Clint is not the only one here who is proficient in the act of espionage, Princess. Think not that I cannot see you manufacturing emotions for me to read on your face.”
“Sir Alexander,” Steve greeted with respect and a little awe, which made the knight smile kindly.
“Because I’ve finally managed to ask you, and I really hope you’ll come get coffee with me,” is the ridiculous response, and whatever nervousness there had been on Steve’s face before has been replaced with steely determination.
“Uh, Tony?” Steve said from above him.
. They’re not on our property; you’re a newsworthy figure now.”
She wasn’t sure what made her say it, but it was out of her mouth before she realized what she’d offered.
Steve heard Natasha and Pepper shouting at him, but his eyes were fixed on the way Thor kept his large hand pressed over the amulet, pushing it against Tony’s flesh as he started to murmur something in a language Steve did not understand. But it was magic, he realized, when the amulet began to glow. The others fell silent, gathering close around, until the glow sunk away into Tony’s skin and Thor moved the amulet to the side – revealing a nasty-looking scar where the open wound had just been.
There was a horrible keening noise in Tony’s ears all of a sudden, like one of the street lights out on the road was about to blow. It was so loud Tony swore he could not only hear it but also
Startled and befuddled, Tony glanced down at his costume, having already forgotten what he was wearing. And okay, without the fangs, which had fallen into his drink quite some time ago and been abandoned to their fate… he maybe looked a little like a gender-bent ghost-Belle. Maybe. A little. What with the brown ponytail and pasty-white makeup and gold pseudo-Regency getup. And, uh, especially considering his companion for the evening.
“I get it, I get it,” Nia replied. “Do you want me to hold your hand?”
Soon, though, the cold water and even colder wind worked to relax him, and the pain screaming inside him burned counterpoint, somehow pushed into the background. He remembered that he wished to see the faces of the people he loved, but he slipped away without being able to remember their faces through the fog.
Nia blinked. She looked back at Steve, still and serene in his encasement, and bit her lip. “You tried kissing him?” she asked dryly.
For a guy who had (from what Tony had been able to glean) been cooped up inside that building for at least few years,
They painstakingly avoided talking about it, and while Natasha and Bucky had realized the situation and respected the pair’s decision to remain silent (or at least had the decency to keep quiet about their opinions, for the moment), Sam made no secret to Steve what he thought of the silence and awkwardness.
“I'm turning fourteen this summer, Sir.”
Pepper had elected to remain inside the carriage, since she was still recovering from her days’ worth of seasickness, but Rhodey was standing at attention beside it. He bowed low over Natasha’s hand while introducing himself like the perfect gentleman he was. “I'm James Rhodes, Your Highness, Tony’s nursemaid.”
She took a quick shower, lamenting that she didn’t have time to luxuriate in the gigantic tub, dressed, and went to meet her father.
a girlfriend, a perfect, tall, blonde girlfriend with muscles like a wrestler and a face like a fashion model. It had been her first real crush, her first crush on a real boy who wasn’t fictional or dead, and she’d sworn to hate Carol for as long as she lived. But hating Carol was impossible, when Carol called Nia up to go to the movies with her, when Carol begged her to join her for lunch, just the two of them, when Carol gave her a dress that ‘didn’t fit anymore,’ the kind of tight, red, dress Nia’s own parents would never have let her buy, the kind that didn’t even pretend to fit regulation.
“Nice to meet you!” she yelled, smiling widely. “Amazing costumes!”
The carriage had traveled a long way down into the gully, but even at his careful pace Steve reached it within a few minutes. The carriage was upturned, with three of its four enormous wheels ripped off and strewn along the path it had created. The remaining wheel spun slightly in the wind, rattling against its axle from where it had almost joined its brothers. The carriage door was swinging open, slamming closed and then flinging itself away again as the wind whistled through the trees and did its best to tear the door free entirely.
Behind her, Nancy had drawn her service pistol, pointing it at the assailant with trembling hands. "St--stop!"  She stammered. "Stop or I'll shoot!"
“For what?” Howard asked.
They were clearly in the king’s chambers. The décor was opulent and heavy, with rich fabrics and furnishings, the curtains drawn tightly over the window and the whole room lit only by flickering sconces and an enormous fireplace. The four-poster bed against the far wall was immense, though it appeared a little smaller since the curtains along two sides were shut, and the bed-coverings had been pulled up and set up around the perimeter in a sort of nest of coverlets and furs.
“I thought you wanted to be late?”
She felt cold; her shoulders tensed, and her stomach growled nervously.
They all met up in Natasha’s dining chamber after Bucky and Steve had time to bathe and change clothes after their long time on the road and out in the wilderness. By that point, Tony was practically jittering with nerves.
Steve nodded his agreement. “You want to test him. Publicly.”
He felt like he could scream, it was so unfair. How could he not have seen this when he had Tony right in front of him? Was he so selfish, so stubborn, that he was incapable of recognizing a blessing and a miracle all in one when it was standing in front of him with glowing brown eyes and a crooked grin?
He quite enjoyed the results, petty as it might have been.
She nodded. “Very well.”
Steve and Bucky took turns trying their luck on the iron lock, but there was no reasoning with it. Eventually, Steve hissed with frustration and turned hard eyes on Bucky. “Bring Nat. Quickly.”
He put a hand against the heavy weight of her hair, pressing his face into the vibrant copper curls and almost wondering himself why he had tried to give this up. “I was ill, I'm sure they told you.”
“What do you want?” the prince asked tonelessly, ripping another damp sheet from the notebook and fetching another peg from the basket at his feet.
She clanked her spoon against her bowl to jerk him out of the verbal spiral.
Nia sat on the grass, numb, unmoving.
The beast snorted at him, then looked surprised at himself. “Yeah, I think that’s probably bad.”
her parents. She winced at the nickname she’d stopped using two years ago.
than graduation. She actually felt glamorous.
Even so, Natasha had Bucky, and Tony would by no means begrudge her that.
“It wasn’t my idea!” the man—Justin—cried, trying to back away from her but finding his way blocked by the titanic form of Thor at his back. He held up his hands and turned back to Natasha as if he was planning to plead with her. “It wasn’t me! I was just the puppet! Don’t you see? I’m the fall guy!”
Everyone was given an assignment that seemed to suit them, and no one looked displeased. Of course, this was an elite Academy and Nia had heard that at the less prestigious schools, students didn't always expect assignments they would enjoy. There were people assigned to menial jobs, people assigned to infantry, whose lives were at much greater risk than the young officers graduating into the military from the Academy. But that didn't happen here. The Academy was made up of the best and the brightest, the smartest and most ambitious, and, of course, the most wealthy.
“I like cotton candy,” Steve shrugs, and Tony bursts out laughing.
Steve grumbled a little, arguing that “it isn’t like that, Tony,” which it was, it totally was. Because they had long since taken to sleeping in the same bed (after Tony had reinforced it for Steve’s massive bulk), and it turned out that Steve made an
“Who sent you?” Pepper stormed over and demanded, in a voice that held the distinct promise of imminent pain.
“Well,” she said bitterly. “If they wanted to entice me, the least they could do is show up to my graduation.”
“Wake up.”
It was inevitable that he would try to escape, and he had to factor in that Loki would surely know that. Tony tried to to admit it even to himself, but Loki’s words did not disappear as soon as he said them – rather they embedded themselves in Tony’s mind, and the niggling doubts accumulated.
To his grief, Steve had been right about Bucky’s arm. The town doctor, Bruce, had been forced to remove it once they had cut off the remainder of Bucky’s jerkin and shirt and seen the terrible extent of the damage. His friend’s left arm now ended in a bundled stump a bare finger’s length from his armpit. Steve could not bring himself to sit on that side, but Natasha had no such compunctions. She was there at Bucky’s hip almost as much as Steve was, though she had numerous duties around the castle that could not be delegated indefinitely.
She felt a bit stupid as soon as she said it, of course he had a name; people generally had names.
Nia made a face, and pushed herself off the bench. “Plush accommodations; I’ll be sure to give it four stars,” she answered.
“Hello, Nat,” Steve said finally. “Prince Tony.”
His first thought was that something must be terribly wrong.
She sat down on the other sofa, clasping her hands between her knees. She realized, belatedly, that she could take off her jacket, too, and she tossed it over the side of the sofa, breathing in, feeling less stuffy in her plain white tee shirt.
“Stop, Steve,” Natasha said coolly, holding up a hand. “That's my betrothed you're talking about.”
The next day the others announced a hunting trip, and though Steve was desperate to take off as soon as possible, he knew it would only raise questions and more danger for all of them if they let anyone know they thought something was amiss. So that afternoon they took off into the forest as casually as they could manage. The most difficult part of getting on the road with haste turned out to be getting Bucky on horseback in the first place, after he had missed the entire conversation over dinner the night before, and the resultant series of revelations. Through a combination of Steve’s manhandling and Natasha’s cajoling, Bucky was extracted from his room soon enough, and by sundown they were flying down the roads back to the abandoned castle, in the desperate hope that they would not be too late.
Obie said it kindly, defensively, looking loyally up at Howard, but the response in the room was a rising murmur.
Tony made an inarticulate noise of protest while Pepper giggled and leaned out of the carriage window, and Natasha perked up like a fox catching the scent of a helpless little bunny. She turned slowly to look at Tony, and he was very much aware of who was the bunny in this scenario.
She drummed her fingers on the table. “And then it turned out I was working for nothing. And it’s never going to happen.”
“And you--”  She watched her father now, mesmerized.
“You're late,” Tony accused, clapping his hands on Bucky’s shoulders.
where it was actually meant to go. Tony had not yet seemed to have noticed this.
“For fuck’s sake, Ty, it’s Jim and Carol.
“What about my daughter?” Maria asked.
. Since I’m leaving to work for UNITY... I sent that film to forty of our affiliate channels. With instructions to air it only at my say-so.”
He was not certain this situation could get any worse.
And then there was the new variable of Sharon Carter, granddaughter of Natasha’s castle steward. She seemed to be willing to play with the others for one reason and one reason alone – Steve fawned over her at every available opportunity. Who would not want to be treated so royally? Tony could not tell if she actually liked Steve as much as he clearly liked her, but he figured it was not his place to ask or worry. Tony saw very little of Steve that summer, as a result, and wondered if Steve was not deliberately ignoring him once again.
“That has nothing to do with it,” Steve snapped. But the question stuck in his skin: Tony had asked him almost the same one.
Natasha took his arm comfortingly and he turned to look at her with slightly widened eyes.
“We’ll keep trying,” Howard added. “We’re not going to give up until he’s awake.”
Tony hissed at him, despite the pain it caused.
Nevertheless, it was decided roundly by all that the summer trip should be canceled.
Tony nodded. “Does this mean you're to be my personal protection detail for the next seven weeks?”
“Well, yeah,” Tony forced out. “I mean, I moved into your house. You… you might have been in danger if you left. I didn’t give you a choice, I—”
“You really are a genius,” Bucky crowed at Tony, who grinned and squeezed his hand around Steve’s arm.
“Because you
“Wow,” Nia breathed.
The prince did not open his eyes but folded his arms tightly over his chest. “It is possible,” he confirmed. “Loki escaped confinement over six months ago, and we have had no word of him since.”
Steve expressed his own confusion, to which she simply said, “I have Bucky,” and adamantly declined to elaborate further.
-- that Nia felt at her most insecure. Four years after Jim had sought her out to invite her to a party because she was ”the smartest person in school," she was still surprised that their friendships had lasted right up till graduation.
Maria arched an eyebrow, and shook her head. “Oh, no,” she said, and she walked to the window, pushing back the curtains. “It is definitely not over.”
something devastatingly snarky is about to leave his mouth. “Towel optional.”
“Now he has awoken, I feel more comfortable giving him medications,” the doctor explained a little while later, fussing over Bucky’s bandaged shoulder. “This is going to be… painful. Very painful. He will need to be on nerve sedatives for many weeks, perhaps months. I'm not – not really a surgeon, I have not treated a wound this severe before,” he admitted.
,” Nia answered, though she was suddenly very aware of just how loudly she’d been shouting.
The three of them turned to look at the bird, which was now close enough that they could see the dregs of the sunlight glimmer in its eyes, and Natasha was right – the swan was alternately looking between the four people on the shore and the rapidly descending orb of the sun. The looks were getting faster and faster as the sun started to disappear fully below the horizon. It felt as though none of them had moved for hours, and Steve was not certain how long it was before the light disappeared completely behind the trees.
Nia took a long, slow breath. Maybe she’d been too hard on him.
“The rings,” the priest said, probably for at least the second time.
Ty wrinkled his nose at her, and looked about to retort, when Nia heard someone call out from behind her.
“Yeah,” she said, finally meeting his gaze. “You know how they are. It’d just be more fuel for the fire. They both desperately want me to pick
A blaze of light arced from the gem into the center of Tony’s chest, shoving him over the surface of the cot and into the wall behind with a painful thud.
Time to start acting like a prince. He didn’t need Natasha. He didn’t need Bucky.
Tony fought the pervasive aches and pains pulling at him as he shifted to sit on the edge of the cot, his hands curled around its splintered and slightly damp frame for support.
But before he got to the water, an enormous arm wrapped firmly around his waist and spun him back away from the lake. “Steve,” Thor’s voice rumbled.
“Thank the stars for that,” Bucky retorted gruffly before pulling back and looking up at Steve. “If he can’t leave the lake, we’re going to have to rethink our strategy.”
By this point, Tony had gone from sober to tipsy to almost-sober again, and most of the room was somewhere along that scale. They all congregated in the living room, filling it to capacity and spilling out into the kitchen and hall. Jan stood tall on one of the armchairs at the edge of the room, one foot on each of its arms and holding an enormous bag of candy on her hip.
Steve ducked his head. “Tony…”
She gritted her teeth, squeezed her eyes shut, and slipped a hand between her thighs, brushing a single fingertip against her clit, hoping maybe she could masturbate her way to sleep, but now all she could see was Ty, and it made her shudder, made her stomach turn, until she felt repulsed and snatched her fingers away.
She trembled, knock-kneed in her too-high shoes, and Ty took a long look at her, his eyes focusing on the low neckline of her dress.
Steve sighed, keeping his eyes closed even though the phantom of Tony behind him had dissipated. “He's a prince, Sam.”
,” said Nia, kicking her feet in the sand.
and not even doing that right.” He shook his head softly, like he hadn’t just dealt Steve a mortal blow to the heart. “No wonder nothing ever happened, here.”
“A…”  Nia didn’t really know. “Like a...ten or a twelve, maybe? Kind of depending how tight the waist is? A medium or a large?”
His entire body ached, from a pounding headache in his temples to what he hoped was not a broken ankle. It took him several long moments to realize that he was on a thin straw cot, and that he had certainly not been in bed last he remembered. The memory of what had last happened to him was hazy, blurred somehow, and it took him a long while of lying very still and wishing his headache away before the memories began to trickle in.
“Can you at least give me a straight--”
Bucky broke into a grin. “He's a lord and a knight! He can do whatever he wants!”
Sometimes, when he missed him deeply, Steve tried to draw Tony from memory. But every time he tried, he realized how little attention he had paid to Tony while he was there, and he thought that he was such a fool. The next year it was decided yet again that the trip was unsafe, as the war in Asgard reached what all hoped would be its fever pitch and, mercifully, its end.
. That’s a direct line. This has my badge number on it and everything.”
Tony’s eyes were probably a little misty too by that point. Fortunately, nobody was around to see: it was late enough that all the kids were home already, and the foot traffic was down to almost nil. Besides, they’d cut through a big alley between streets, which Tony would only ever do at nighttime with a literal giant monster accompanying him.
She peeked out of them and saw a wide expanse of  landscaped grass and trees-- a full golf course.
“I’m not his boyfriend,” Steve said sulkily, but Jan clearly didn’t hear him.
“My father isn’t corrupt,” Nia answered, her jaw feeling very stiff. It was hard to talk; her voice sounded stilted.
Of course, Tony chose that moment to mutter something completely muffled into the shoulder of Steve’s jerkin.
Bucky tightened his grip and cut off Stane’s air. The regent fell mercifully silent after a small retching noise, before he was quickly gagged. His eyes stayed on Steve, though, reveling in his hurt.
“Yeah—yeah, sure,” comes the flustered response, followed by the sound of bare feet padding away towards the kitchen, then padding quickly back.
“Rad. Okay. Coffee.” Tony whipped around and made his way over to the kitchen half of the room. A nice coffee for the toothy beast. Why not? “I swear by molten black coffee, as nature intended, but I recognize that some people aren’t so enlightened. So do you want milk in yours?”
“Oh,” the other man said, a large, ugly smile stretching across his face as he took another step towards Tony. “I make no such mistake. But you are wrong, Stark, to think that they will ever find you.”
And though all reason told Steve that Pepper was simply fabricating stories for herself to better cope with the fear that the Tony she had loved had not returned, truly, from his captivity… as the days went on, Steve began to find himself falling more willingly into her opinion.
The Dean shook his head and looked down at the envelope. “Tiberius Stone,” he recited. “Public Relations.”
She chose warmth, snapping the door shut behind her, and felt her way blind along the walls of the hall. Her head and her heart were both pounding; she panted softly, and, for a moment, rested her cheek against the plaster wall.
and the least you could have done was
Clint gave a bit of a shrug. “I'm an archer, Your Highness, not often within range.”
off the stage.
with my father,” Nia replied.
Tony did not know how long it had been. Months, certainly, but he did not know how many.
“If you wish it, I will not attempt to convince you to stay,” the prince agreed. “I ask only that you wait for me to gather my possessions.”
There was a chorus of boos as Thor the Icelandic football player pumped his fist in the air and caught his candy bar one-handed.
It was a fond joke – a warm, private source of laughter around the castle that the burly, golden Steve’s knight’s arms were to be a delicate, irritable waterfowl. It was not supposed to be dragged in here, into this dungeon, this mysterious place. Should never be spoken of by this loathsome man, who spoke of killing in one breath and then in the next of humor in which he had no place.
“But Nat said it wasn’t a duck,” Clint said, peering suspiciously down at the drawing in the middle of the table.
He did none of those things, simply leading Tony down in silence to the drawing room.
“Well, circumstances have changed,” Maria said.
Nia stopped dead in her tracks.
characters—they seemed to be missing a Chewbacca, and maybe Steve wanted to volunteer?—when there was a child’s shriek from off to the right.
After a moment spent considering Loki—or, perhaps, considering putting an arrow through his throat—Clint nodded and took off out of the splintered remains of the door without so much as a backwards glance.
She put on the pair of blue shoes that were in the closet-- higher than any shoes she normally wore, with tiny spindles for heels, and she wobbled a little as she got her bearings. She twisted a bit of wire around the antonium capsule, then strung it on a chain from another necklace, and hung it around her neck. The metal was cool and smooth against her sternum, and it looked enough like a very modern piece of jewelry that Nia was satisfied it wouldn’t draw too much attention.
It was times like these, looking at all her beautiful friends-- at her beautiful
“It’s the only sample,” he said. “It’s the element that Hydra was using in their weapons. We never-- it took me this long to recreate it. And that little tube-- contains enough to power an entire city for a decade.”
Howard shook his head. “No one,” he replied.
“Okay,” he said. “How about you come out into the main room and we talk?”

“Let go!” he barked, twisting in Thor’s grip to find the swan again. It was drifting closer to them now, silent, but still flapping its wings and bobbing its long neck back and forth anxiously. “Let
Tony turned raspberry red while Pepper and Rhodey laughed gleefully.
He wondered for a moment if he should not try to get Pepper and even the others to safety – but Tony did not seem to present an immediate danger to anyone. In fact, he seemed far more harmless now than his usual self. Than he should be. Than he was. Steve had wondered before how much a person had to change before they became in effect someone else, but now he was beginning to wonder if that had not been thinking far enough. Tony appeared to know who each of them were, knew their names, knew plenty of information about them – but did not know how to talk to them. And they all knew, in the form of a well-worn joke, that Pepper and Tony’s farewell exchange had been the same since they were very small children. There was no way Tony knew who Pepper was but did not know the correct response to that phrase.
He hopes his smile doesn’t look as brittle as it feels as he obligingly ducks out of the bathroom, and hustles for the front door.
"It's been years, Howie," Maria had answered, cutting him off before he could finish. "We could all use some closure."
Steve flinched, and Sam reached across the table to touch his clenched fist apologetically.
A journalist in the front, a woman with pale skin and brown hair, chuckled at the answer, and then grinned, and gave Nia a thumbs-up, and the laughter filled Nia with renewed confidence, and she got into the spirit of the thing, rattling off sarcastic answer after sarcastic answer, and, after a few questions, felt emboldened to pose for the cameras, trying to mimic the looks of the models in Carol’s magazines-- blowing a kiss over her shoulder, standing with one hand on her hip.
“As for Prince Anthony,” Natasha said pointedly, when Thor drooped. “We believe your brother to be responsible for his disappearance.”
Steve, Tony, and Bucky would soar over the grassy hills together, and Steve considered himself a brave man, but even
Tony gestured back at the lake and raised his eyebrows. “Are you really…?”
Tony perks up with a grin of his own, ever-so-subtly adjusting his glasses. Then he narrows his eyes in concern. “What have I agreed to, exactly?”
who my
The redheaded menace gave Jan a little smirk, effortlessly snatching her Three Musketeers out of the air. Half the room cheered while the other half booed—Tony, for one, had already complimented Nat on her “This is my Halloween costume” t-shirt, and was snickering into the top of Steve’s head.
attacked
Maria's expression tightened, hard and etched, a cold glare. "January's a myth," she said, through gritted teeth.
“They tell me you have been made a squire,” Tony said into the silence, still standing with his arms behind his back in front of the harpsichord. “Congratulations.”
“I get it,” Nia said. She patted her pocket. “I’ll put it on a chain, turn it into a necklace.”  She grinned. “If I paint some hearts on it they’ll think it’s some dopey teenager jewelry; they won’t give it a second look.”
Natasha’s heart beat thrice in a single second, and she fought not to show the reaction upon her face. “I understand, Prince Thor. Perhaps we should simply return to our ship, in the interests of continuing our investigations with the utmost haste.”
The way those blue eyes crinkled at the corners was one Tony was perfectly familiar with, and he exhaled in a rush of forgotten fear and delight.
Pepper, as the champion of the theory that Loki had somehow altered or damaged Tony’s mind, was one of their most dedicated code-breakers. She was also in constant communication with Tony’s friend Rhodes, who was far afield defending Menahahte from the increasing attacks from their neighbors. Stane’s leadership, it seemed, left much to be desired, and it had been the rare month recently that some foreign land was not snapping at the kingdom’s gates, testing its new regent or simply bolstered by the death of its brilliant king.
That if Tony had been there before, he would still be there now, as the traitor and whoever else was in on his disappearance believed they were safe, with their impostor firmly in place.
“It’s not ready,” Howard said, his tone short, and Nia got the sense that he was cutting Obie off deliberately.
“Obie’s harmless,” Howard said, waving away Yinsen’s remarks with a hand. “He’s been working for me since he was a kid. He’s just overeager; that’s all. He wants to be a hero. He’ll listen to sense.”
Clint narrowed his eyes at Thor while Sam scoffed. “You bridge troll.”
“What the… hell was that?” he gasped.
happen, do you understand?”
Steve’s costume. He was wearing Steve’s costume, and he was standing where Steve had been, and he was claiming to be Steve. There was still no damn way this was his Steve.
The same sort of encounter happened several times along their way. By the end of it, Steve had relaxed enough to show off his enormous fangs along with Tony’s rather more teeny-tiny ones, which made most of the kids either scream with pleasure or gasp in awe. The adults, amazingly, didn’t seem to entertain the idea that Steve was an actual monster for even a second. Steve even took a selfie with a group of freshman girls from the nearby college, although admittedly he didn’t look thrilled about it.
Nia bit her lip.
As they tramped up the stairwell to their rooms, Tony started to reply to the doctor’s solicitous questions from behind chattering teeth. “Yes, I’m starving. What’s to eat? Don’t want all the cooks’ work to go to waste. Fair warning: if it’s a bird, I’m going to faint.”
“Stop faking it, Ty, you know it’s me,” Nia growled into the receiver.
“The last time Miss Stark received an infraction was six years ago,” Officer Knight said, clearing her throat, when no one else spoke. “That means you’re lucky,” she said to Nia. “This isn’t even going to show up on your security reports.”
“Nia,” Maria said. “We’re outdoors. You’re screaming.”
On alternating days, Tony would go riding to spare himself the dangers of sparring. He was an excellent horseman, fearless and utterly wild, and the others had to start taking turns with who would accompany him – since riding with Tony on their days off from training was often just as strenuous as the sparring itself. Natasha loved to ride, but she preferred jumping and the more technical aspects of working with a horse to flat-out runs or forest hunts, so she tended to go out in a trio with Tony and Sam. Sam was a good rider but mostly enjoyed it because it allowed him to pursue his much deeper love of falconry. The three of them would set out to hunt on their afternoons, and Tony would come back flushed and bragging about all the animals Redwing had killed, as proud as if he himself were the huge falcon’s trainer.
“Steve?” Tony had noticed, now, since Steve had all but frozen in place, staring at Tony’s huge, beautiful brown eyes, like Peggy’s, and supposed he had a certain set of preferences that were constant for both women and men, at least, that certainly lent a sort of poetic symmetry to the entire affair, and it may have been that his thoughts were starting to descend into the hysterical…
It was the sheer appeal of Loki as a suspect that had Steve practically staging a rebellion during the four day journey on the ship over to Asgard.
It’s not like Tony can’t get attractive people interested in him, or people far younger than he is, for that matter, but that usually has to do with enormous amounts of work on his part paired with the right context. Steve has more or less caught him with his pants down, and Tony is well-aware he isn’t all that impressive when he’s not being full-blown
—had surely returned the impostor to his place, and the others had no reason to suspect him now.
Nevertheless, Tony, Natasha, Sam, and Clint managed to amuse themselves in the others’ absence. One memorable afternoon, Natasha demonstrated the trick riding Clint had been teaching her – first on a horse, which was honestly impressive enough, and then on
Because… Steve had no desire to ever live without Tony. And he knew he would never have to, since Tony was to wed Natasha one year from now, and officially unite their two kingdoms. Menahahte was small and quite self-sufficient, so Steve already knew that Tony planned to take up residence in Natasha’s lands and merely visit his own from time to time.
She whirled away, telling herself she didn’t care if he followed. She wanted Jim. And Carol. And Obie. Obie would know what to do, she told herself. She wondered if her parents had known about this, if
Steve knew this already – he swallowed and prepared to tell her as much, when Tony himself slid out of the nest of fabric and furs and came up alongside Natasha, standing comfortably in front of Bucky. He glanced warmly over at Steve, and grinned. “But that doesn’t mean we can’t all have fun with it.” With that, he leaned up and kissed Bucky – not the wild kiss of a passionate lover, but far more than the affectionate kiss of a friend.
He has no artifice in him—not a speck that Tony can detect. Not about his interest in Tony. He’s just so unlike any of the other people Tony normally finds himself in these situations with. He’s seen Tony at his most caveman-like phases of the morning and evening at least once a week for almost a year, when grunts in recognition of pleasant greetings are the best he can dredge up. And somehow, in all that grunting, Steve saw something in Tony that he liked well enough to engineer probably the most ridiculous, spectacularly unromantic meeting between them as humanly possible. And he admits to it with no shame—only open glee that his terrible tactics have worked.
Oh shit, if it was awkward before, there was no way this wasn’t going to make things absolutely unbearable between them. No no no, how could he be so stupid? Tony tensed up too, his heart starting to pound. He made the executive and not-at-all-cowardly decision not to remove his face from where it was hidden in Steve’s fur. Denial, yep, denial was definitely the way to go.
He tried to remember this when Tony appeared at dinner looking ruffled and flushed, and yet still staring at Steve as though he had never seen another human being before.
“I—” All Steve’s words suddenly abandoned him.
For a while, he simply breathed, luxuriating in the feeling of not being in what felt like fatal agony.
“Oh.”  Maria frowned for a moment, then say back down on the sofa and patted her lap. “Okay, sweetheart. Come here.”
And that was when Nia realized that there hadn’t been a problem with the car service, after all.
The day after the feast was a somber one. The guests trickled away for the journey home after the morning meal, and finally Tony and his parents took their leave without too much ceremony.
Natasha reached the pinnacle of her ability to stay quiet about the situation one evening where they had all come together in the drawing room. Tony was not in the mood to play the harpsichord, but Clint could play a mean lute and was serenading them all with increasingly bawdy and hilarious drinking songs, egged on by Bucky and Sam. Natasha did not involve herself, but was obviously enjoying it as much as the rest of them.
“I--”  Nia took a deep breath. “I’m glad you said what you said down there. That’s what I was trying to say. You-- I don’t know if this is the kind of thing you want to hear, but Maria would be proud.”
Steve and Sam took off running after Clint, and Steve managed to overtake them both on the way down. He burst into the enormous chamber and immediately ran over to Natasha, who was standing over a man Steve did not recognize. Both of them were in the middle of a buzzing crowd of servants and the odd courtier. The man was seated on a low stool, dressed warmly and covered with a blanket, but clearly soaked through from the storm outside. Lord Fury and several others stood close-by, watching the man with wary concern.
Nia blinked. "Steve?" She asked. "He has a name?"
“Wha--”  Nia walked to the windowsill, looked out on the front lawn of their house. Just past the pristine emerald grass, the beautifully-sculpted shrubbery, the columns that marked the end of the property, stood a
Tony pauses with one foot in the air, half-way out the door, then continues with an arch glance over his shoulder. “You aren’t even afraid of spiders, are you, you sneak?”
Steve’s smile falters, but he keeps it up. “Good enough for me.”
“Who betrayed us?” Natasha demanded, grabbing Justin by one of his upraised wrists and digging her fingernails into the sensitive skin there. He cringed in pain as she twisted angrily. “Who helped you, Hammer?”
Nia had sat very silent and still, and she hadn’t quite been able to explain the way her forearms had tingled, why she had felt cold all over.
She stopped walking, throwing her hands up in the air. “You? Not thinking about that? Your parents
“We’ve tried everything we can think of,” Maria said. “We’ve been trying, for twenty-five years.”
He had almost summoned a snippy reply through the fog of shock, but she simply shook her head and brushed right past him. He watched her stalk back to the castle without once looking back at him, scowling at her retreating form and muttering against both her and Tony. And Bucky. And Sam.
“Come inside,” said Maria.
Tony looked hurt for a moment, and Steve had time in that one moment of Tony’s soft, pained expression to feel years’ worth of regret and horror at himself, and he wished he could take it back.
“Come on, after what happened to you today?” Carol asked. “He didn’t even ask how you were; he just launched into his own complaints.”
Steve, Bucky, and Clint all blinked at him in confusion, while Sam began covertly grinning into his napkin.
Steve did not even have time to lodge a protest before Bucky chirruped, “Done,” and pranced over to shake Natasha’s hand. He then kissed the back of it and winked down at her.
– the conceited, vengeful younger brother of Crown Prince Thor of Asgard, said to have been banished from the realm for traitorous actions during their last war with Jötunheim.
“I—” Steve repeated foolishly. There was no point in pretending that he did not know what had happened to the notebook. Tony and Natasha clearly already knew who was responsible, and Steve was no liar.
Steve had been prepared for any manner of greeting by Tony after their disastrous farewell. He had anticipated anger, coldness, relief – and in his weaker, more hopeful, besotted moments, he thought that perhaps Tony would be overjoyed that Steve wished to move on from their longstanding past of denying their feelings for each other. He had often imagined greeting Tony with a kiss: a kiss like those they shared in front of the fireplace, kisses that escaped reason and robbed him of breath and thought. Even on the ride back home, he imagined sitting upon the bed with Tony as he convalesced, eating proper meals and resting and recovering his strength. He imagined curling over Tony’s thighs and just feeling his body present and warm beneath Steve’s, or holding him close with his hand over Tony’s heart, feeling it beating alive.
“These books,” Maria said, as she shoved the bookshelf-door shut and then pulled four different books out from their spots on the shelf. The door swung open again, and the books popped back into their places. “Try it.”
“Not-- not even Aunt Peggy?” Nia asked.
He gave Natasha an arched eyebrow, and it startled a smile right onto her lips.
He still wore his shabby shirt and trousers from the night of his capture, but the person meeting him in the storeroom—whoever could get away from the festivities the most subtly—was to bring a suitable outfit for him to wear. He looked forward to the idea of clean, fresh clothes almost as much as he did to the idea of a warm, freshly cooked meal. His hair was long and tangled around the strip of leather he’d been using to tie it back, and he hoped briefly that his friend had brought a comb. It might be too much to hope for some tools to groom his beard.
She willed herself to stop now, looking back into the mirror. She didn't look old. She didn't feel old. She felt like the same
Nia had rolled her eyes.
Even having expected it, Tony chokes on his coffee. Steve laughs brightly at him, and this is hands-down the weirdest, greatest first date Tony has ever been on. It’s still pretty much dark outside, they haven’t even started their coffees yet, and he already can’t wait for the next time they meet up. He beams over at Steve, who is flushed and actually not wearing it very well, all ruddy and flustered—which is even more endearing than his general perfect gorgeousness. Tony smiles at him as un-sappily as he can, under the circumstances.
He had been gone from the castle for a little over three weeks, but apart from that they knew very little about where he had been and what he had planned. This was becoming the norm for him, without a more defined role within the castle than simply ‘the princess’s friend.’ All of their lives had settled into an uneasy new equilibrium in the months since the attack. Natasha found herself missing the security of her longtime betrothed in more ways than the obvious, as it seemed that every week after the mourning period passed she was receiving increasingly generous and attractive offers of marriage from princes and wealthy nobles from throughout the nine realms.
Tony had not been found. They had scoured the ravine for days, covered every place he could have possibly been flung and a fair amount of places he could not. And yet for all their efforts, there was no body, no blood, no trails – no trace at all of the man.
The carriage. Bucky.
Everyone applauded politely, and the Dean moved on to the next assignment.
There was another silence, and Tony heaved a sigh. “You must be kept busy.”
She now
“Fuck you,” she muttered.
From the moment of his arrival, King Howard was treated with no more than the barest minimum of courtesy due to him by the household, as he had not made the best of impressions. The first thing he said to Tony upon his arrival was a snide complaint about his son’s attire. (Though in the king’s defense, Tony had been sparring with Bucky and Natasha out by the lists, so the grass stains and liberally smudged dirt upon his person were quite eye-catching.) Nonetheless, neither Natasha nor any of her friends much appreciated the downcast look it gave Tony for the next few hours, and less still the false smiles and forced laughter and joviality Tony donned in the man’s presence – all of which was hinting at an ongoing pattern.
“Come on, Nat,” Steve whispered roughly, as if she could hear him.
“Do you mean that?” Tony said instead, turning slightly with his arms loose at his sides.
There was a long pause, and then, “
“We’re here, Buck,” Steve said soothingly. “Nat and Steve, we’re here.”
It was too late for this. Or early for this. Maybe this was all a vivid, exhaustion-provoked hallucination. Wouldn’t be his first. Although the subject matter was certainly novel: apparently Tony had
Tony got to keep those letters though, with Steve’s determined, blocky hand and determined, blunt words. It was a poor substitute, but it was still a part of
He could never stand to think that Bucky was dead – it was too much, simply too much.
This time, the mattress gave out a sound more like a pained gasp.
And Nia burst into tears. “I hate him,” she said, her voice sounding thick and shrill and ugly, and her stomach lurched. She put her hands to her middle. “I want to puke.”
Steve was reminded of his childish love for the lovely Miss Peggy Carter, and his even more childish hope that Sharon would be as wonderful as her aunt. Natasha had been furious with him when he expressed that view, and forbade him from seeing Sharon unless he just wanted to see her for her own merit. Since he did not know Sharon very well and she was three whole years younger than him, Steve had decided to let their friendship become far more incidental. He did not forget that exciting, scary, happy feeling he had felt around Peggy though, before she married Gabriel.
“Nat showed me,” Bucky retorted far too loudly, shrugging. He grinned back at Steve as he opened the heavy door and proved it to be unlocked. “It’s always good to be prepared, Stevie.”
“He’s just inside, with Sam,” she said reasonably. Then she added, less reasonably: “Clint is watching.”
“—deserve so much
,” he snarled again. “I don't care what it is you want. There is nothing you can do to me to make me change my mind.”
The dining room-- what had been a dining room, when she was twelve-- wasn’t a dining room anymore. Years of family meetings and negotiations had necessitated that the one shared space in the house-- apart from the foyer and the secret room she wasn’t supposed to know about-- had become more of a conversational space, and there were now sofas and chairs and a wide coffee table.
what their assignments would be, that they’d be posted to the Air Force. It was a proud assignment, an elite assignment, and people had been treating them like elites for months.
Steve had to remind himself almost daily that this was still the man he loved, and that his resolutions upon Tony’s loss were not to be negated by the trauma he had suffered while in captivity. Even in the face of Tony’s new, pervasive indifference to all of them—even Steve, even
“Hey,” Clint said suddenly, in an inappropriately energetic voice. Everyone’s attention zeroed in on him. “You said that… if Tony’s enchanted, it would wear off at night, right? So, if we were there during the day, the spell would be working, right? So if Tony was
she was going to do something terribly embarrassing, and it would be too late, she wouldn’t be protected from the press anymore, it would be in every single newspaper come morning.
His only comfort these days was that he now at least knew what the Asgardian wanted with him, why he had gone to such lengths and caused such loss of life. The trouble was that the knowledge did not actually help him at all.
If that was all their secret room was, she thought, she was a bit disappointed. Though she couldn’t imagine what they did down here for all that time-- or how they bore the cold. She supposed maybe that was all this was-- storage, storage for other experiments, and maybe the lab was another room. The temperatures, she thought, would loan them to medical samples, maybe something her mother required for experiments. Or some unstable material her father needed to keep at a low temperature or risk blowing up the house.
Now she walked quickly through the airport, escorted by a full complement of guards, all with guns and steel-toed boots, past civilian security, and the guards
So Natasha extricated herself from the two men atop her legs and took his place. She immediately launched into a fast, jaunty reel, which Tony instinctively attempted to drag Steve into as soon as it began. But Steve was bigger than Tony, and refused to move; just gave Natasha a look pleading for mercy. She grinned sharply at him and segued into a much calmer, more structured rhythm, with lilting midtones and a solid beat to follow.
Steve spent the entire time sulking, according to Natasha. And Bucky. And Sam. And Sharon. And Peggy, when she visited. And once, memorably, Lord Fury.
Bucky’s mouth slowly broke into a grin as Tony rambled, and Steve realized it was the first real smile he’d seen on his friend’s face since he’d woken up after the accident. “I don’t know about a crossbow, but I’ll take as many daggers as you can squeeze in.”
“I’m Tony,” he told her, and her faint smile grew wider.
Tony blinked as his brain raced in five directions at once. The easiest bit to process was that his own hands were still up as if he were ready to fight his way out of this, which would only end in tears. His tears. With a jolt he brought his arms in to fold them over his chest.
,” Natasha snarled as the hall flew into pandemonium behind them, and the man cringed. “You quivering rodent, how
When Tony drew back, he gave Steve a bit of a watery smile. “I will see you next summer.” Steve swallowed and nodded, and Tony’s smile grew a little less sad. “Your eyelashes are wet.”
"You code on
Here, parts of the city looked as she expected any city to look, but in other places, the homes were little more than shacks with clay walls and tin rooftops, barely large enough for a single room. Children ran barefoot in the street, which was torn up and badly in need of repair. She saw people driving
“He’s beautiful,” she said, and then realized she’d said it out loud. She flushed, and stammered. “I mean. Uh--”
This was a mighty realm with powerful warriors, and for hundreds of years it had never been invaded by a foe. Many had once sought its power and wealth for themselves; all had failed. Many more still had tried to trade with this prosperous land, but they were set in their ways, and did not care to build relations with the lands outside their borders.
Or… did he feel trapped living with Tony? It wasn’t like he had much of a choice, did he? The thought had occurred to Tony before, but he’d always managed to chase it away when Steve would smile at him, or start another food fight, or let Tony gently scrub paint out of his fur. What if Steve was desperate to leave, but he just couldn’t? He literally couldn’t go outside without putting himself in danger, and Tony had been completely oblivious because he
, there’s no—” He skids to a verbal halt, blinking at himself in the mirror over the sink in utter horror. He hasn’t been this useless at conversation with attractive people since he was
Tony realized who he was.
“Fusion?” Nia asked. “Like,
Littered along the drop were the bodies of horses and men, some intact but some splayed in obvious death upon the ground and the hefty, unforgiving trunks of the trees below. At the sight of it, a wave of nausea swept cruelly over Steve, and it was all he could do not to turn away in horror. For all he was in training to one day become a knight, he had not been exposed to death before. Not like this. Nothing like this.
“What was in the back room?” Steve asked, startled.
Tony, Pepper, and Rhodey returned home at the end of the summer in high spirits.
Though he looked as though he very much wanted to leave once that nicety was taken care of, Natasha latched onto Tony’s hand in a clawed way Steve was very familiar with, and dragged him into the room with the rest of them. Bucky called out a friendly greeting, which Tony returned reluctantly. Steve tried to feel vindicated that Tony was turning out to be such a toad now that he had left his childhood years behind him, but instead he felt disappointed and vaguely ill.
“Your synapses are
“What changed your mind?” she asked a little suspiciously, unwilling to let him go without questioning even through her obvious excitement that someone might finally agree with her.
She pushed the curtain back again, and wrapped her arms around herself, all the hairs on her body sticking out at once. She could feel her skin puckering with goosebumps, feel her nipples harden to taut points beneath her shirt, ticklish against the cotton.
It was therefore Clint’s horrified warning bellow they all heard while Natasha and Tony were sharing a long embrace.
Steve squinted in the dim moonlight in the direction Sam was pointing, and could just make out the unmistakable blackness of charred wood on the trees whose trunks were remaining. The villager had not been exaggerating: each of them did indeed appear as though torched by a great bolt of lightning.
“That’s not tactics!” he points out, a ludicrous giggle lurking in his voice. “That was the least tactical move I’ve ever seen.”
He must have made a noise (hopefully a manly gasp, but more likely a childish squeak), because the figure cringed and paused half-way up onto its feet, putting its hands in the air as if in surrender.
She looked unhappy, and Steve felt a little bit bad. “He’s my friend. Can’t you be friends too?”
Steve was down in the kitchens, scrubbing pots.
The figure flinched, but didn’t turn around. “I… yes, but it’s not what it looks like.”
“They were going to assign you to work for me,” Howard said.
“With all due respect, General Ross,” Howard said, raising an eyebrow. “You of all people should have some idea what happens when technology is tested in the field before its time.”
But to Steve’s dismay, he shook his head. “It’s not just the transformation, Nat – it’s… the change is—”
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve says as he passes. The words sound uncomfortable in his mouth—Tony’s name in particular—and Tony almost cringes.
Clint’s admittedly tasteless jokes seemed to make Tony more uncomfortable than they ever had before, and the sharp wit they had grown to expect from the man seemed to have vanished beneath an odd stretch of uncertainty. Even Sam’s gentle solicitousness appeared to unnerve Tony to an extent, and his comfort and reassurance seemed to fall upon stone ears. The overwhelming presence of Thor, who really
A great golden medallion gleamed in the center of his chest, likely some sort of royal trinket. It was the precise color of his hair, flashing in the sunlight like his curious eyes.
mama died.
At that, the other boy—Steve—puffed up like an angry little sparrow. He turned his glare briefly on Bucky, who ignored it with what looked like long experience. Tony sensed that he was on thin ice for some reason, but wasn’t feeling too charitable towards the child who looked to have been mentally throwing rocks at him this entire time.
“Not Obie. Not Peggy,” answered Maria. “No one. It’s absolutely imperative.”
“Yes,” Steve nods firmly. “If you’re interested.”
“Do you have a song?” he said, putting on a smile.
Nia felt a jolt at the news, and sat up straight. “My parents?” she asked. She rubbed at her eyes.
“Show who what?” Nia asked, looking around for another person, someone apart from the surgeon and Dr. Yinsen.
The room they were gathered in was in the center of the castle, so the only windows were the clerestory ones high on the southern wall, but at this late hour there was very little light entering through them. Instead, the cavernous room was lit by a vast number of candles, so that it was bright and warm, golden, and Steve briefly remembered flashes of kissing Tony in a room lit like this, tasting his skin and touching his body, and he flushed bright pink right there in his seat.
Next summer was going to be wonderful.
Was it possible Loki had erased his memory, and Tony was simply too afraid or too clever to let on that he was surrounded by strangers and terrified for what a turn his life had taken?
She leaned back against Ty's chest for a moment before she remembered herself and pulled back, standing beside him more properly, though she offered him a hand. "I'd make a terrible leader, Captain," she retorted, sticking her tongue out.
All of this, however, seemed to lose some of its importance when it came to finding Tony, which had more or less become one of Bucky's sole reasons for recovering from his melancholy. There was little he would not put up with to find his friend: whose absence he felt acutely responsible for, no matter how the others tried to convince him otherwise.
Jim’s car was a miracle of automotive engineering, a machine the two of them had built two summers before out of spare parts, salvaged scrap, and whatever else they could find. It had been their proudest achievement, getting that wreck to actually run, and not only run, but run better than anything on the market. Nia had, somewhat grandiosely, offered up her half of the car to Jim as his birthday gift.
“He’s probably very grateful he has a shirt at all,” Howard said. “You’re being too softhearted; you sound like Maria. If you help one of them, they’ll all want help, and they’ll-- they’ll get vicious, if they think you have something to give. There are better ways to help than just handing out money.”
She had put the paper back on Howard’s desk.
Nia groaned. She took his hand back, patting it. “This isn’t the
“Or am I not quite blond and muscular enough?” she teased.
“You don’t need to get yourself arrested,” Nia said quietly.
Beast-Steve stared at him incredulously, which was probably justified, then nodded slowly.
At his side, Sam’s eyes were as wide as their forgotten dinner plates, looking from the ghostly white Pepper to Natasha’s self-defensive stance to Steve’s utter stillness. “You knew?”
Instead, Tony gave him a brief frown and then a weak smile, and a splinter of uncertainty lodged in Steve’s chest.
They built a fort of branches and twigs in the woods (which the girls ruthlessly demolished the next day despite the boys’ best counterattacks, through a calculated and worryingly impressive military effort), they helped out in the kitchens for the joy of the treats the cooks lavished on them, they played in the stables and with the dogs, and they discovered every conceivable hiding place within the castle walls – including a certain nook in the battlements which hid Rhodey so well that he was very cold and
Nancy.
His mind caught up with his thoughts, and he clenched his hands in the sheet.
“Doctor Yinsen?” she asked.
“Are you?”
“It's a pleasure to meet you, Mister Rhodes – may I call you Rhodey, or is that just Tony’s name?”
“Ty’s having a party on the beach,” Nia said, finally, as Howard pulled the car into the drive.
Something beeped.
in the press, and it won’t be pretty.”
Two months passed quickly, and soon Tony was going to have to return home.
But Pepper simply would not have it, no matter who the reassurances came from. “Loki has done something to him. Something more than we know.”
"I'm meant to find out which of the officials here are in support of waging war against the insurgents, and which would prefer a peaceful solution. It’s pretty obvious which side your--"
A noise cracked from his throat one morning, while Steve was busily drawing Natasha’s profile as she reclined opposite him in Bucky’s bedchamber. In an instant, both Steve and Natasha were on their feet, leaning over Bucky’s bed.
“They shot her,” Nia said. “They...they killed her.”  Her throat was hoarse, and every word was effort. “Water?” she asked.
He stroked a hand along Tony’s splayed wing. “You could have had a lovely life together as disgusting perversions of nature, if only you had been something other than a prince…” Obadiah paused for a moment, then pinched one of Tony’s secondary feathers between his fingers and yanked it sharply out of the flesh. The pain scarcely registered through the rest of the agony and horror overshadowing Tony’s mind, but he flinched nonetheless. Obadiah twirled the feather between his fingers, then stroked it down Tony’s bill. “I’ll give him this, shall I? A token of your final failure. After Hammer’s unfortunate death, of course, when I can ascend unchallenged to the throne. I would love to see the look on your dear knight’s face when he realizes just how long you’ve been dead.”
Nia obeyed her father’s instruction, swallowing as her throat went dry. “What do you want me to do with it?” she asked.
She wriggled out of his grip, snatching the bra off through one of her shirtsleeves, and dropping it to the ground, even as Ty cupped one of her breasts in his hand. Her breast was small, and his hands was huge, and covered it fully.
“Call them
,” Tony snapped – or, he meant to snap that, but what came out of his throat was rather more a brief series of hisses punctuated by a surprised
His escape attempt had been ill-fated from the start, he knew, but he had done it anyway. He only needed Yinsen’s help with one part. A map. Just a small piece of parchment. The brave, kind man had agreed to bring Tony the pivotal tool of his eventual escape, and the hope came flooding in despite the distance still left to go before freedom was his once more. He would still need to break the spell, of course, but at least he would know how far he had to travel, would be able to plan something, plan
. Like most people.”
Thor drew up regally. “I am Thor, son of Odin—”
“I'm glad. I know you hated being trapped in here every afternoon.”
She froze, and didn’t turn around,  “I’m-- I’m sorry,” she said to the reporter who had just asked her a question about her opinion on the recent rise in Hydra insurgents. “Could you please repeat the--”
Obadiah settled a little more on his hip, tilting his head at Tony. “The wedding has probably already started, and Hammer will be there to throw off your friends. Apart from that one – the archer? He’s unconscious in your chamber, bumbled in at the wrong time, I’m afraid. Now,” he tapped the feather on Tony’s head once more. “Shall I snap your neck, or just leave you here to bleed to death?” He looked up and down Tony’s body, then smirked and returned his gaze to Tony’s black eyes, glaring coldly down. “You’ve been a thorn in my side for over a decade, you little cuss. I think I’ll leave you to die slowly.”
“Got a paper towel?” he calls out.
"I know," Nia had answered. "But I can't decide. I like everything."
She put on ordinary civilian clothes: a pair of bluejeans and a tee shirt, not bothering to dress up or look particularly nice, and tiptoed down the back service stairs and out the kitchen entrance.
“I just want something to remember you by,” he whispered softly, and she recoiled at his words, without quite understanding why.
“To your brother,” Natasha said, bluntly, and immediately a shadow fell over the prince.
Someone suddenly tapped Steve’s knee, and he looked over in surprise to see Sam peering oddly at him.
“We’re not certain. Asgard is still in turmoil, and there is talk of another civil upheaval. It’s possible Fury is simply being overly cautious. I assure you though – he's taking no chances after the amount of time and effort he has put into arranging this marriage.”
Steve had kissed people before: had felt their lips play over his own and even felt the wet, warm sensation of a tongue teasing for permission to enter his mouth. He had never given that permission before.
“Tony, I love you too. It really is me, and I’ll prove it to you.”
“Where am I?” Tony demanded, looking the stranger up and down.
“Steve!” Tony said brightly, not quite shoving Bucky out of the way to hurry over.
“There’ll be time,” Ty urged, and he unbuttoned his own trousers when she made no move to. He snatched up her hand with his free one, slid it down the front of his pants.
“Remember how you sucked my cock and let me come all over your ugly little face?” Ty asked, his voice whisper-soft.
Tony beamed up at him, reaching up to tug his fingers through Bucky’s hair. “You’ve gotten as shaggy as me,” he noted. “Looks better on you, I imagine.”
She explained succinctly how they deduced that someone had warned Loki of their arrival, and Bucky’s face turned thunderous. “Who would dare?” he snapped.
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Yinsen asked.
There was a long silence. Steve felt it stretching out, unable to think of anything appropriate to say. Tony allowed the silence, though he was fidgeting almost instantly. He was never still, always in motion, dancing through his life. Steve was weak already, and Tony was standing right there, calling out to him with luminous brown eyes.
Thor’s eyebrows jumped up, and he flashed another assessing look over at Clint. “To what does this information pertain?”
ready, Howie,” said Obie. “We’re closing in on Hydra’s primary base of operations, and we have to do something.”
—only to slump back onto Steve’s shoulder when she called out Scott’s name for his admittedly amazing Mike Wazowski costume. It was basically a stuffed Swiss ball spray-painted green and cut open for his head and limbs, but something about the way it made Scott waddle around and bounce off of furniture had had people in stitches for hours.
“Come in the water!” Bucky shouted, splashing a bit of it at them. “It’s cold!”
Maria shook her head, pinched the bridge of her nose. “You are more than ready,” she said. “It isn’t you.”  She sighed, then got up from her chair. “Come on, love,” she said. “You must be starving. Let’s go fix a sandwich.”
This was one of the most intimate touches they had ever shared, since usually they were both extremely careful to avoid this sort of thing. Steve got the sense that this was a bad idea even as he dragged Tony in close to his chest, but there was no chance of him abandoning it now. Tony made abrupt motions at Natasha, the only other member of the group with the capacity to produce music from the harpsichord.
“No wonder you’ve been so weird all this time! How did you know this Peggy? How long have you been a monster and why the hell—how the hell did that happen? No, wait, you’re back to your normal self and we don’t have to worry about that whole monster thing anymore so does this mean you’ll finally kiss m—mpfff!”
“Time for prizes!” Jan was saying, to an eruption of cheers. “And then you have to go home because I have an 8AM class tomorrow. So!”
Tony was not there, but by the look of the large, fresh bloodstains on the flagstones and the outer door swinging wildly open in the wind, he had been recently. And he was badly injured.
,” she grumbled, even as she saw his shadow staggering out of the trees. She looked to Jim. “Can I get a ride home?”
Nia reacted quickly, jabbing her elbow into the man's middle, but her shoes wobbled, barely supporting her. She snatched them off her feet, brandishing the heels like weapons.
It earned him a chuckle, and a wonderful blush. Tony did not bother resisting the urge to run his hands up Steve’s arms from his wrists to his chest, feeling the thick new growth of muscle there. He squeezed Steve’s impossibly broad shoulders with only slightly feigned disbelief. “You aren’t even wearing shoulder padding!”
“I knew it wasn’t true,” she informed him, turning her head so that her ear was pressed firmly over his heart. “Why did you lie? Why did you not want to see me?”
, which he's certain would have been far more pleasing had it not ended up with him flat on his face in the sand with one of Natasha’s strong, trouser-clad thighs wrapped around his neck.
. It’d be like choosing children.”
They broke apart only the barest space, both pulling in desperate breaths. Steve held Tony’s forehead to his own far too tightly, pressing their brows together and fighting tears he could feel in the corners of his eyes. “Tony,” he said, hardly recognizing his own voice. “I’m so sorry, Tony, I’m so sorry.”
Natasha brushed past a shock-frozen Steve and held out the handkerchief with Thor’s own amulet inside it. Thor immediately pulled the fabric aside and turned to dip the amulet in the water, brushing frantically at its surface with the handkerchief, digging the silk into each and every crevice as he did his best to remove all traces of blood from it.
Then they were falling. Tony remembered the carriage spinning around him, as he, Bucky, and his parents turned far too slowly within it to keep from being hurt.
, the psychopath would soothe.
They left Obie, but Yinsen walked to an elevator with shining golden doors and floor-to-ceiling mirrors on the walls, and an
There had been protesters outside the hospital, people with white picket signs, shouting. Jarvis explained that there were some people who felt that people from the Territories, the land outside UNITY Central, should be able to cross the border to receive medical care, and some people didn’t.
; he’s on your side; you--”
“Yeah,” Nia said hoarsely, stumbling as her feet hit the ground again. “Yeah, I know.”
“Shh! Okay!” Jan chirruped, waving around a Milky Way. “For most accurate costume… Shuri, as a kinda scary-functional Inspector Gadget!”
"I was about to," Howard answered. He took off his glasses, rubbing at his eyes before he put them back on.
Then, without a word, Thor grabbed the knife buried in Tony’s chest in one hand and the amulet in the other. Before anyone could protest, he had pulled the knife from between Tony’s ribs with a terrible sucking noise, and pressed the gold amulet over the wound.
Nah. No need to be that paranoid. Tony settled for pouting just a little and kicking disconsolately at Steve’s shin until Steve flicked him and glared.
are you thinking? That’s going to be in all the papers; you--”
“It can't remain that way,” Steve repeated, looking uncomfortable. “I am to be a knight. There are certain relations that can be… that can have their place, but you're – difficult.”
She walked into her room. It was palatial, twice the size of either of her bedrooms at home, and had an enormous bed at the center, with a thick down coverlet, and a bathroom with two sinks and a bathtub large enough that Nia suspected she could swim in it. The carpet was rich and plush; the windows took up an entire wall, and were hung with rich, shimmering draperies.
Nia shut the door and copied her mother’s actions. The door sprang open, satisfyingly so. She grinned and popped it shut again.
“Lord Fury,” the little princess said without turning around and without taking her hand back from the prince. “I will show Tony to his room.”
There had been different flags, different uniforms, not an entire planet of people dressed in the same blue.
“Congratulations and best wishes,” said the Dean.
Maria's face appeared at the door, and she raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms over her chest. "Well, it's definitely been an eventful day," she observed. "Is that what the screaming was about? You met Steve?"
putting me in prime position to sabotage--”
Steve didn’t answer.
Distantly, Steve could hear the melodious sound of Natasha shouting at Tony, then some movement around the table, and then Tony was gone, and he slumped back down.
“Honestly I don’t even know what this looks like, whatever the hell
Tony’s eyebrow rises, wondering if he’s about to get his palm read or something equally kooky, but he gamely holds out a hand palm-up over the table as he takes another gulp of coffee. He knows he hasn’t stopped grinning and staring at Steve’s glittering eyes since pretty much the moment they sat down, but he really doesn’t care.
He knew they were watching, the nosy lot of them, but he did not much care at that moment. “Tony,” he breathed, then grinned.

He gave her a hurt look. “Do you think I was

Steve collapsed against a wall in a corridor he barely recognized through hazy vision. What if Loki had done something far more terrible to Tony than chaining him up in a basement and leaving him there alone for months? What if they had been ignoring the signs of a severe magical tampering with Tony’s mind for
, you’re – you’re
“You are the most… stubborn…” Sam trailed off, tipping his head against the cool stone of the wall at his back. “Are you so afraid to be happy?”
Right now, Steve was realizing how much Tony meant to him. How enormously important he was to Steve’s very existence. Compared to that riotous feeling of joy and fondness and gratitude he felt that he had
“And Maria wants me to go save babies with her,” Nia answered, shrugging. “Either way, somebody’s going to be disappointed. But I’d rather it be because my aptitude lies elsewhere than because I had to disappoint them.”
The next day, Steve was nowhere to be found. Bucky was lurking around, but he avoided Tony studiously and only spoke to Natasha to argue with her about Steve. And the day after that, Tony had to leave to get on the ship that took him home. He waved to Natasha from the carriage that took him to the docks, until the coachman noticed him hanging out of the door and started yelling at him. He drew back inside morosely.
“Why are you stopping?” he asked. “What--”
It would make Natasha happy, and probably Bucky too.
“A final gift from my mother, young Prince,” Thor said somberly, quietly: as though the words were just for Tony, and touching his fingertips to Tony’s cheek affectionately.
"Nia?" Maria said sharply. "Nia, are you alright?"
Steve always ensured that one of Bucky, Clint, or Sam would be present on these outings, since he knew there was a need for security but he had no desire to get to know the woman who had given Tony to the world, and whom Tony loved so deeply.
And then, one day, when she had made the move back to her father’s side of the house, a message from Howard appeared on her holoscreen.
that? Is that--”  She swallowed, remembering what Ty had said, that his family wouldn’t allow any stories about her to be run.
Steve poked his curious head around the end of the wooden wall and was confronted with a sight he would likely never forget so long as he lived.
“Oh,” Nia said, and she looked down at the capsule again, with more interest. “
Natasha was the first to crack. “You might have mentioned such a thing earlier,” she groused.
The racket he made also made someone call out from within.
He just shook his head. Of course Steve was sad about it. Tony didn’t know what he would do if
"Miss Stark!" He exclaimed, loudly, loudly enough that it turned the heads of the crowd milling nearby. "Are you excited for your assignment? What do you think it'll be?"
why I wasn’t sober enough to help with your little radiation experiment, General?” Howard asked. “Because I laid my ethics down to bed and took a weapon design from the mind of a madman who was
This time, she filled the enormous bathtub. With bubbles.
They ate supper together as a group in Natasha’s private dining room, and the long-suffering Lady Hill had long since given up on pretending there was any sense of propriety to the princess dining unsupervised, nightly, with a foreign prince, two squires, a falconer, and a mercenary who had once been sent to kill her.
Somewhere along the way, Tony had gone from being a source of constant aggravation to becoming what felt like one of the deep roots of happiness in Steve’s life.
“Fuck!” Nia exclaimed, and she drew the curtains shut with a snap. “What
“The doctors who operated on you,” Yinsen explained.
“I am fortunate my treacherous brother has not soured your opinion of me,” Thor grinned wanly, at which Tony merely snorted. “It is an honor to meet you, Prince Tony. Your friends speak highly of you.”
Steve seized upon the escape route and punched Tony’s arm lightly. “You're horrible.”
Nia's breath hitched. There was a conversation she had had, more than once, with Howard, about the dangers of being the child of a powerful government official, of the way she might be hurt or taken advantage of, and here it was, something she'd always laughed off, never perceived as a palpable threat.
It took her a few moments to realize that there was a fuss behind her, onstage, where Ty was standing, hands on his hips, facing off with the Dean.
," Maria answered.
voice was perfect.
The knight nodded, then drew himself up to his full height. Bucky and Steve did the same, sensing the change in the atmosphere. “When you are of age, Steven,” Sir Alexander said solemnly. “I would take you as a squire.”
He gave Natasha a meaningful look. “But many of these spells require the
, she remembered the times when he was too drunk to work, when he’d shut himself in his lab and muttered things that made no sense, when the way he spoke to Nia made her frightened to be near him-- she wanted to get up and march down to the front of the room and defend Howard against this man.
She sucked in a breath; swallowed, gasped at the heavy sensation. “I want to see my friends,” she pointed out between kisses. Her skin was getting hot, sticky; she could feel the back of her shirt clinging to the sweaty spot between her shoulderblades. “Ty, this isn’t how I want to--”
Pepper scoffed. “Forgive him, Your Highness, he becomes overly flirtatious around powerful women.”
They were dead, now, but Nia had been unsettled by their smiling faces. They had looked like ordinary, happy people, not traitors or terrorists.
She had to hold onto them, to keep them afloat, and she turned them to face her, so she could clear the fluid out of their mouth, too.
“I’m going to make you a new one,” he promised, giving Bucky a little shake. “The best damn arm you’ve ever seen. Built-in armor, perhaps a small crossbow mechanism. Maybe a hidden compartment for a dagger or two, or snacks—”
Steve scowled and took a step back away from him. “I am well, thank you, Prince Tony.”
They had been sitting next to each other at events since they’d begun at the Academy: Nia was S-T-A-R-K, Ty was S-T-O-N-E, though it took two years for Nia to even bother to introduce herself, and it was only then that she found out that Ty had been paying close attention to her all along.
Without a thought, he threw himself beneath the surface, and the pain did not recede but instead began to take direction. Pulses of it shot through his bones, heaving at his muscles and his skin. An itching fire spread across his flesh, as though he was being stabbed over his entire body. But with the water there, cold and still and liquid around him, the pain began to become tolerable and, eventually, it faded away entirely.
Natasha looked to him piercingly, taking her seat as well and indicating that the others do the same. “Thor?” she prodded, as Sam darted over to shut and bolt the door to the dining room. “Is that possible?”
“Oh, Dr. Cerrera,” said the robotic man. “I’m afraid that’s not possible.”
“They all look the same!” Steve snarled in frustration, leaping back from the angry pecking of another swan he’d gotten far too close to. “How are we supp—”
“Steve,” he choked out.
Pepper nodded amiably, then rose to her feet. Steve, Thor, Sam, and Clint rose with her, and Tony stumbled up a moment too late. “Goodnight,” Pepper said to the other four men as a whole, then turned to Tony. “Will that be all, Prince Stark?”
When Howard still hadn’t shown, she had pulled down a book from his shelf, a book of history from before UNITY had been assembled, from the Last War, and thumbed through it, reading about the world before UNITY, a world with hundreds of countries and people who spoke different languages, different rulers and forms of government, different militaries that fought each other, instead of a single military committed to eradicating terrorism.
“Well?” Nia asked.
"You're saying you know the code," Howard observed.
Tony thought about Natasha’s joke about the ugly duckling, and found he could not help but to agree with her.
“James and I have decided,” she told him seriously, belayed only by the light of amusement in her eyes. “That my first child should never have difficulty claiming the throne, so it must be Tony’s.”
“Are you saying you don’t want to be?” Ty murmured back.
could.”  She bit her lip. “I was better than
Tony’s mouth twisted. “He wanted my blood—more than he got from doing his best to break my nose once a week, I might add—but he wanted me to give it willingly.”
“Because he cannot,” Thor replied wryly. “Loki is a sorcerer – their natural magical ability makes it difficult for them to cast certain spells on themselves. I would imagine this is one of them.”
. Tony had pointed out that it wasn’t like you could see Steve’s… bits, what with the thick coating of hair, but Steve would not be swayed. Tony had managed to prevent him from wearing a shirt, not least because carding his fingers over Steve’s magnificently tufted chest was one of Tony’s new favorite anxiety-reducers.
Tony tried to get out of visiting the next summer too, but his parents were adamant.
“He’s rude,” Steve retorted. “And a bully.”
Leaning into the touch, Tony swallowed and his eyes dropped to the ground. “Well, I’m difficult to get rid of, apparently.”
Steve tried not to shrug. “I can ride a horse, Sir, but I have not done it to fight before.”
“We’ll find something else for you to do,” said Maria. “You can work with both of us.”
“Come on, man,” said a young, female reporter with pale white skin and  dark hair, tugging at the photographer’s arm. “Don’t ruin it for the rest of us.”
The rumble of satisfaction he felt in Steve’s chest made the burning in his (scrawny) thighs worth it.
Every hope that had been fluttering in Steve’s chest, insisting that it was perhaps not that long of a drop at this point in the mountains, that perhaps it was reasonable that most if not all of the caravan had survived the fall – every little flame of optimism guttered at once as Steve looked into the yawning, black chasm below. The cliff was practically sheer for the height of at least three men before ever so slowly beginning to level out. At that point, the trees could begin to grow, which meant that both Steve and Sam could clearly see a path slicing through the copse of broken trunks and splintered branches, where the carriage must have tumbled down.
“Good guess, Kiddo,” said Howard, and he glanced at her, then looked away. “Come on, Nia,” he said, after a moment. “We’re going upstairs.”
"Cut off one head and two will take its place," the surgeon answered, and chuckled maliciously.
Tony gave him a sideways look. “My parents?”
But now others were snapping pictures. They'd seen her, and it was one thing to take a camera from an errant reporter (Nia thought, as Obie smashed the camera on the ground), but they couldn't stop a crowd. Nia ducked, covered her head with her hands as Obie wrenched the photographer's hand up behind his back and forced the man to his knees.
cross when Bucky and Tony finally found him. They had to appease him with a delicious, freshly roasted apple they’d finagled from the head cook.
Tony wasn’t particularly thrilled over having his date co-opted either, and told them so as he tugged on Steve’s cape to make him follow.

The Dean put a hand to his forehead and held out the envelope. “Public Relations.”
“Maaaaybe,” she answered, and kissed him back.
Steve leapt out of the chair like it had been kicked out from under him, and Sam instantly lunged over his seat and wrapped his entire body around Steve’s back, trying to keep him from pouncing on Tony. Sam was bigger and much less frail, so his weight would have been enough even if Bucky had not joined in, darting around the table to press his hands on Steve’s shoulders and yell at him to calm down.
She combed a hand, self-consciously, through her hair, and spat into the sand, looking down. “I punched Ty in the balls,” she said.
"Have you ever heard of January?"
“It is possible,” Thor nodded, then swallowed. “There are many ways to create the false appearance of another person. The easiest would be a simple magical disguise, a veneer of some sort.”
No such luck. Steve is standing there looking considerably more peppy than he had earlier (after he’d shamefacedly trekked over to ask the neighbor he’d barely exchanged three words with up until that point to rescue him from the wannabe-Aragog hanging out in his tub).
you, that’s another story. Actually…”
Tony considered this, then reached out and took the amulet from Thor’s palm, inspecting the pendant hanging down from the robust chain as best he could in the low light, and with Steve refusing to release his other hand. “What’s the catch?”
Natasha had been in a fine strop for the last few months, after Lord Fury received a missive from King Howard stating that his Grand Advisor, Lord Stane, had expressed deep reservations about the prince and princess’s impending nuptials, and that he would be accompanying the prince on his trip this summer to discuss the details further with Lord Fury. The princess stomped to and fro about the drawing room, her antechamber, the boys’ chambers (to Lady Hill’s exasperation), and most of the rest of the castle, grousing about the delay and expressing a strong desire to be finally married and able to control her own kingdom and affairs.
He remembered Tony’s weight upon him, Tony’s lips against his throat.
There had been no sightings of anybody either entering or exiting the building in years aside from its occasional custodian. And it was the recent disappearance of that custodian from his hometown, the small hamlet of Gulmira, that had sent Steve and the others to this dilapidated structure.
Tony sighed despairingly. “An Leshdad. You know, fum
. You can’t just...can’t just not assign me.”
“Love you too, candy floss,” Tony replied, grinning triumphantly.
Flinching, she drew her hand away. “What?” she asked.
“Oh, and get yourself thrown in jail,” Jim piped in as he finally ambled his way over. “Real smart, Captain.”
Nia winced, and she looked back at Howard, who was watching, shivering, in the doorway. “It’s his heart, isn’t it?” she asked Maria. “This is why-- your new prosthetic, the one you had me help you model, that’s for
, she mentally corrected, though she wasn’t quite sure, really, what to call this. She watched his face, watched his long, golden eyelashes, waiting for them to flutter, to show signs of life.
“Just for friends, Your Highness. You're welcome to call me Rhodey,” he returned with a charming smile.
He worked himself up further and further as the dark hours went on, until it was a little before sunrise and sleep had abandoned him all night, and he could not stand it any longer. He felt fury radiating through his bones, pulsing in his chest, and he finally gave in and swung out of bed.
Then again.
“But my mother goes to them”  Nia had said, then. “Why would they need to come here?”
. Bucky darted forward and grabbed Steve’s elbow in a painful grip, as all four of them watched a golden light diffuse out from where the swan was floating on the water. The swan had stopped fluttering its wings, and was peering at the glow beneath its body as if judging it for something.
The tears erupted, spilling down her cheeks, and she wiped her eyes on her bare arm, the sticky tracks of saltwater glistening on her skin.
She had wondered if they had been talking about her-- she had supposed it had to be her; who else could it be, and what could they be keeping from her? A lot, she had assumed. There was the obvious secret of the room behind the bookshelves. She knew that her father dealt with all kinds of secrets as Secretary of Technology.
Thor looked very confused at the entire debacle, turning to Steve beside him with raised eyebrows. “Is something the matter with Prince Tony?”
The man in green shot Nancy in the head.
“Bet you they kiss before the summer is out,” Bucky whispered obtrusively to Sam (who was several feet away from him), over the easy but rather loud tones of the music.
who pushed the buttons.
“He's confused,” she would calmly insist. “The uncertainty of our marriage is… difficult.”
Tony swallowed his own heart-pounding panic, peeled off his fangs, and flashed him a roguish grin. “Told you so.”
“You look like you need it, too,” Steve smirks, the ass.
Tony sighed, but nodded. “I can work with that. So, what, I show up at the castle two nights from now, slip this on, and just walk into the great hall? Seems… worryingly simple.”
Thor’s lips quirked. “The amulet itself is enchanted, so it requires an energy source. This one uses the living blood of the wearer, which means that the longer it is worn, the more energy it will drain from you as it fights the spell. Its use must be sparing.”
Specifically, he was scowling at Tony.
They took the quickest route to the storeroom where Tony was supposed to have met Clint, only to find that the door had been locked.
He was provided for largely by a man he soon learned was called Yinsen, whose wife and children were being held against him in some way by Loki – he did not give details, and Tony was not eager to ask.
!” Nia snapped. “I’m not going halfway around the world just to run away from my pissy boyfriend!”
,” she muttered.
He made a despairing noise in the back of his throat before leaning down and pressing his mouth firmly against Tony’s, keeping as still as he could but trying to pour every loving feeling he had ever had for this man into the kiss. Every kind thought he’d ever had about Tony, every exasperated one, every time he’d ever thought he wanted to spend the rest of his life at Tony’s side, every kiss he’d wanted to give him, every word of love he’d ever wanted to speak.
Some way, somehow, Tony got them moving out of the bedroom and into the main room of his fancy condo. Possibly Tony had won Steve over with his superior debating skills, or possibly Steve was just tired of having his fur yanked on. Tony wasn’t questioning it. He released Steve for the moment and sped over to check himself in the hall mirror.
Howard looked up at her, and smiled weakly, then raised a hand, as if to wave away the compliment. “It doesn’t matter,” he said. “I...want you to take something.”
Nia growled. “Did he come over here?” she asked. “We--”  She realized she couldn’t exactly tell her mother everything without admitting that she’d sneaked out of the house. “We had a fight yesterday. It’s fine; it’s over; we’re doing different things now, anyway.”
The reporter gritted his teeth. "Miss Cerrera-Stark is eighteen," he answered. "She's graduating from school. You can't deny us access anymore."
She smiled weakly. “
“Sir Alexander abandoned his squires on The Peak,” Bucky told him, frowning. “So we had to make our own way home without the maps or the caravan.”
“Well, that was…” Bruce fidgeted with the strap of his bag. “Nice. But I meant confessions of love, not kisses. Folktales don’t get everything right.”
to know, what her father had been working on, what was so dangerous, that he didn’t want her to be part of it.
Her voice echoed, “wake up, wake up, wake up,” until it was ringing in her ears, and it wouldn’t go away, and Steve was still limp in her arms.
Holding out one of the rings from the little pouch he had been entrusted with, he leaned in to whisper to Tony so only Natasha and the priest could overhear. “Do you have the amulet Sam gave you?”
The groom looked at him a little oddly, obviously taken aback by the question, but he nodded and flashed a small smile. “Of course I do.”
“Whoever he has enchanted to look like Tony,” Natasha cut in. “Is likely then a reserve plan, should Tony refuse to give the blood freely. Were we to marry, I was probably not intended to survive long after the wedding. Loki clearly believes the impostor is firmly under his control.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Tony cut him off. “It doesn’t matter now.”
"It's really him," she said. She pressed a finger to the plastic, as if she could feel him from this side, as if she expected him to respond, to shift or stir. She looked at her mother, shaking her head. "But he's only a little younger than Howard!  How is he so young?"
Tony rather hoped Lady Hill had been relieved of her duties for good at this point, or that somebody had long since noticed that Natasha was never going to be the demure princess many people would hope for. He loved her just the way she was, deadliness and breeches and all, and he knew she would make an excellent queen. She was brilliant, sharp, stunningly beautiful and one of his best friends. In two years she would be twenty-one, and then they would be married.
“Coffee,” Steve says, with a bit of an odd edge to his voice. “Aren’t you… I thought you were getting ready?”
“If you don't mind,” Bucky said cheekily, assuming the position for a slower, inappropriately intimate couple’s dance.
Ty was quiet, his face pale.
“Can’t you give me a hint?” Nia asked, and she bit down on her lip, then reached for her glass of ice water.
Tony’s stomach dropped. “You're lying.”
“Who lives here?” Nia asked, marveling at brick-walled estates grander than her family’s home, and wincing at the proximity to the slums.
He inquired after Tony from a string of castle servants, who pointed him in the general direction of the castle town. Steve grew more confused as he continued on through the streets, following instructions of the townspeople until he ended up in front of the great barn doors of the local blacksmith. Uncertain what the prince could possibly need forged on such short notice, Steve slipped in through the small side door and slid noiselessly through the stores of tack and farming equipment stacked in his path. The smithy rang with the sound of metal clanging against metal, sharp against the racket of the roaring fire, which he could hear crackling and snapping in the center of the room.
“Stalled out,” Howard answered. “That’s your progress report. Stalled out, and too unstable to use as a weapon, without risking the lives of good UNITY soldiers.”
Nia shuddered. She didn’t want her mother with these people, under any circumstances. “Don’t agree, Mom,” she said tensely, shaking her head.
She felt numb; she couldn’t move her hands. There was a slow, steady beeping sound, and the electrical whir of a fan.
“Why can’t I--”
“Other men would find this position very enticing,” he mused to her, spitting sand off his tongue with a series of little
“I was not talking about Tony,” she interrupted, giving him a cold look. “Make this right. Don't talk to me until you're willing to behave like a reasonable person.”
Howard was silent for a moment, brow furrowed, and he opened his mouth once, twice, a third time, shutting it again and again, as if he were thinking and rethinking what to say.
, effortlessly beautiful.
She rubbed her eyes. “Since I’m going to be, you know--helping--”
“Miss Stark!” shouted a reporter, shoving a microphone near her mouth.
“I should have him exiled,” Natasha hissed, turning abruptly and stalking back the way she had come.
Tony said his usual warm farewells to the others, exchanged with Clint the very odd punching and hand-slapping ritual they had developed over the summer, embraced Natasha tightly and breathed in the fresh, herbal smell of her hair.
Nia mouthed the words, but didn’t dare actually try to sing; she was painfully awful at carrying a tune. Ty, of course, sang along in his light tenor. It made Nia want to roll her eyes; even his
Natasha leaned in until her nose was almost brushing their captive’s as he desperately leaned away, caught between her fierce grip and Thor’s enormous hands on his shoulders. “They might just kill you first,” she said sweetly, glancing at Steve and Bucky.
Nia growled. “Yeah,” she snapped, as she opened the door of the car and slammed it shut as loudly as she could. “Yeah, we
“Why’d you do that?” Nia asked. “He might have needed--”
Nia washed the dishes-- a task usually left for Jarvis, but she was feeling jumpy-- and went upstairs to her room. She took a long shower, hoping the hot water would make her feel better, but it just made her feel overheated and a little bit raw as she sloughed off old skin. She twisted her hair to wring it out and tied it up into a knot before climbing into her pajamas.
“Powerful red-headed women,” Tony corrected.
"You didn't tell her?" Maria asked.
“Tony?” came Bucky’s voice from behind them, oddly tentative, and Tony curved around Steve’s shoulder to look at him, his eyes widening. He didn’t say a word, just stared at Bucky, then at Natasha, and Clint, who was half hovering nervously in the doorway and half glancing at Tony as if he could scarcely believe his eyes.
to stop those bombs, and I didn’t pay any heed to his sacrifice. You want to go out there and fight these crummy little insurgents that are a mere shadow of what Hydra was? You do it with my blessing. But we are
She had gone down to his office, the one that was in the house, the room with high ceilings and dark wood paneling, shelves upon shelves of books, and nearly every surface covered high in a mess of papers. She had sat down in the big, squishy chair that faced his desk, wearing the same slacks and blouse she’d worn all day, in stocking-feet, and waited for him.
With a few close calls, Steve made it to the end of the vertical face and staggered forwards slightly as the ground began to even out. He steadied himself with a tree branch, feeling its charcoal surface brush off on his hand.
– Steve’s spine twinged and his knees faltered. Tony caught him quickly, keeping him upright long enough for Steve to find his feet and surge forwards.
Bucky and Natasha jostled with each other as they started towards him as well, though Tony saw a well-placed elbow take Bucky out of the running with a wheeze, and then Natasha was in his arms and he twirled her around as high as he could lift her.
Nia sat, stunned. This was her father, this was the man who got on the radio and told everyone that UNITY was the greatest invention of the modern age, this was the man who said, in public, that anyone who dared threaten the security of the new world order would be met with force that would crush them. She’d known him for eighteen years, and this was the first taste she’d had that maybe there was something else beneath that, that maybe it was all for show.
Steve was an
“I just came for some bread,” Tony said quickly, holding up the note they’d left telling him where to go. “And I will get out of your way.”
Her parents weren’t there. They hadn’t come.
“Response?” Ty asked. “Do you think I’m trying to get retribution?” He laughed. “I’m not mad at you, Nia. I know you were in a…
She nodded. “Yeah, okay,” she agreed, and followed him toward the trees.
“Steve’s in stasis,” Howard answered. “He’s been left alone for weeks before. Jarvis checks on him if necessary.”
“I’m taking you for coffee,” Steve says firmly. And isn’t that right at the corner of
“Tony,” Steve said softly. “I didn’t want to… rush you or, make you uncomfortable, but…” He rounded the second couch and lowered himself to sit on the floor beside the one Tony had claimed. “I missed you.” The words felt choked, sticking in his throat not with reluctance, but with sheer importance.
As something of a compromise (though it was obviously benefiting Stane far less than anyone else, but Natasha and Lord Fury were clever that way), the Lady Potts was sent to live in Natasha’s castle and keep watch over Tony. His old friend was devastated with relief, and her prim and controlled façade showed deep cracks when she first laid eyes upon Tony in his guest bed. Tony was little more moved by Pepper than he had been by any of his other friends, which was at once a relief and a great disappointment. Steve had hoped that it was not simply him and their group of friends here that Tony took issue with. Perhaps—as Bucky was convinced—he really did blame them for his capture in the first place. But whatever the case, there was no real joy to be found in his blank expression upon greeting the misty-eyed Lady Pepper.
The expression on Ty’s face, confident and proud and raging, fell away, and his brow furrowed. He looked worried, frightened. “Public Relations?” he repeated.
Steve hardly realized he was beaming at Tony until Bucky elbowed him in return, with a bit of a laugh. They were both giddy with excitement and Sam, on Steve’s other side, was grinning from ear to ear. In the tradition of his homeland, Thor was standing and bowing to the princess as she entered, which she acknowledged with a smile and a faint nod. They owed a great deal to Thor, Steve thought, and he hoped that one day he might be able to pay the foreign prince back for his kindness and service.
“I—I beg your pardon?” Thor almost choked, his eyes darting between them all in surprise.
“What exactly the problem is,” Steve finished for her, and she tipped her head slightly in agreement. “But what is there to do? The wedding is in less than a week’s time, and we can hardly accuse Loki or
Nia slumped back, as if she could shrink into the leather seats of the fancy car. “Fine,” she answered. She tried to sound nonchalant, but it came out hollow.
“And for most unoriginal costume… Thor, as the god Thor!”
“Howard?” Nia said, finally. “You look like a fish.”
“Tony,” Steve said finally as he drew away and put his hands behind his back. “It's good to see you.”
Outside the baggage carousel, Nia looked for a driver with a placard with their name, but Howard raised a hand in the air and started forward toward a man in a rather shabby-looking but neat three-piece suit, with thinning gray hair and a pair of wireframe spectacles balanced on his nose.
Hours had passed since the visiting royalty had departed, morning bleeding lazily into afternoon and soon into evening, and Steve was sitting alone in one of the many guest bedrooms of the castle. That this one happened to be the room Tony had claimed every summer for fifteen years was only to be expected, really. Sam certainly seemed to have expected it, since he showed up at the door to the antechamber at one point and sat in silence with Steve. Feeling uncomfortable and lost, Steve had settled himself on the bed Tony had been using, wishing the cleaning servants were a little less efficient; wishing he could at least have Tony’s scent to bury his nose in and pretend for however long that his life was very different from reality.
“If you try it—” Tony notes, looking Steve’s bulk up and down out of the corner of his eye as he quickly locks his apartment door. “—I’ll go down like cotton candy.”
“Call me as
“Hey,” Jim said, waving his fingers in front of her face. “Hey, Nee. You okay? You know we don’t care where they put you, right? You’re still
They arrived at the party to very little fanfare. What few college kids weren’t utterly hammered by this late hour were well and truly in the Halloween spirit and made no comments to Steve that weren’t compliments on his “sick fangs, bro.”
Tony’s return, naturally, caused a great excitement in both Natasha’s kingdom and his own, and all of the realms joined in the jubilation over the prince coming back from the dead. Lord Fury, as practical and almost callous as always, demanded that Tony and Natasha be married immediately, and after long, quite ugly
… Wait, what?
,” he breathed, before launching forward to lay his hands on Tony’s shoulders. He ran his fingers along Tony’s ribs, from his protruding collarbones to his neck, then up to his gaunt face, trying to convince himself that the moment he had been dreaming of for so many months had finally arrived.
"I thought you would have left by now," Howard had admitted.
Stupid goddamn spider. If it weren’t already dead he’d be wishing a fate worse than death upon it for its meddling.
“Nope,” Howard answered, shaking his head. “You synthesize a new element, you get to name it after your only child. That’s how it works.”
still in her kingdom at all was the northern accent of his caretaker, Yinsen. He might have transplanted here, of course, but Tony could not bear to let go of his one certainty.
“Sure, nothing to do with my brilliant tactical mind.”
Sam made a noise of dismay but did not comment. Instead, he helped Steve tie the horses' reins securely to a protruding tree root at the safe side of the road, then watched determinedly from a perch at the edge of the cliff face as Steve began to eek down the stone and mud. Sam had an excellent eye, better than Steve’s in this bad light, and he called out directions for footholds and smooth, slippery-looking patches of rock to avoid as Steve made a slow descent in the hammering rain.
Steve shook his head. “I just don’t like him, is all.”
“Of course it counts. It just means I’m a genius even when my higher functions aren’t awake yet.”
The ugly noise that came from his friend’s throat was one of the most wonderful things Steve had ever heard.
Captain-America-like today, in his freshly-pressed uniform, the blank star-shaped space over his heart waiting, like all of them, for the silver stars that would mean they were Graduates.
Nia hoped she was right.
“Will also have an escort when they arrive.”
,” Steve finished with a snap.
Steve barely registered Natasha thanking the man and turning to confer with Lord Fury.
Ty seemed to sense her fear, and she suspected it was because she was holding onto his hand with a steely grip.
Tony looked longsufferingly up at the ceiling. “Of course your name is Steve. Why wouldn’t the monster under my bed be called Steve?”
It wasn’t like most divorces. Neither of them left. They didn’t stop working together, on whatever it was that happened in the laboratory with the hidden door, the one behind the bookshelf that Nia had found when she was eight but had never figured out how to gain access to. They simply weren’t married anymore.
Their days passed in smaller groups than they had last year, with Tony spending more one-on-one time with Natasha than he had since they were small children. That was admittedly pleasing, but also a reminder of how much things had changed since last summer, when the six of them could scarcely be separated for an hour at a time.
Maria kissed her back, smoothed her hair down, and put her hands on Nia’s cheeks. “I’m sorry I’m not always the best parent,” she said.
As the autumn and the winter passed and blossomed into a beautiful spring, Tony could feel his mood souring further and further with resentment, and it was all he could do not to dig his heels in and refuse to go back, for Natasha’s sake.
She looked fretfully out into the audience. Jim was staring, Carol was staring. Obie was standing in his seat, hands in fists, as if he was one breath away from starting a fistfight. Peggy was still seated, but she had a very dark look on her face. Miss Potts was walking from her seat toward the back of the amphitheater, away from the graduation.
Tony was not incapable of fighting by any means, but he clearly did not take quite the pleasure in it that the others did. He also had a natural heart condition that had persisted through the threshold of teasing and proved itself to be something of a threat to his consciousness if he overexerted himself. This was not something that had ever been a problem when he was a child but, when pressed, Tony said something about the Asgardian pirates who had taken him briefly captive a few years before, and then said no more.
?! You’re Steve? Is this normal for you? With the face and the abs and the—” He gestured frantically at Steve’s entire body.
No further clues had appeared to them, however, so they had taken to simply searching every spot around Loki’s last known location that may have been of any value to a man with a prisoner. Meanwhile, they set about making Loki’s sneering face one of the most well-known sights in the land and the adjacent realms, attempting to cut him off at the ankles were he to attempt to simply relocate as they latched upon his trail.
“He’s horrible,” Steve insisted, scowling at the ceiling.
“Tony!” Jan screamed from the front room, over the music, sitting on the shoulders of a huge guy Tony didn’t recognize through his Batman costume.
“Is it…” Sam began, craning his head around for a different angle. “Crying?”
look impossibly like the statue of Captain America outside the Academy, though: tall and athletic, with a twinkle in his eye and softly curling yellow hair that was just a touch longer than regulation, but not so long that he couldn't charm his way out of an infraction.
The cacophony of honking, hissing, and the quacking of many distressed ducks drowned out the sound of one particular swan, which honked in utter disbelief when it saw them standing around the perimeter of the lake.
,” she snapped, before she marched, braless, back to the beach.
“Would you
As though it understood, the swan’s head fell slightly and it began to drift back from the shore. It stared at Clint for a long time, letting out an oddly mournful noise, its wings drooping as the fight evidently left it, and eventually it turned and swam out into the middle of the lake, then round the bend where it was hidden by the rushes. Steve watched it go curiously, wondering what Clint could possibly have done to anger it so, before rounding the corner and jogging to catch up with his friend.
As Natasha cursed the fact that she did not have anything with her to pick the lock, Pepper came running from the other direction, calling out that they had found Clint drugged and tied up in Tony’s room, where Sam had stayed with him. Tony had not been there. Steve kicked viciously at the door, again and again, but hardly even rattled it. He was about to run back down the hall to take the longer route around the outside of the castle – when Thor arrived with Bucky and, without even slowing down, barreled into the door shoulder-first so hard that the lock came splintering right out of the door frame. Thor grunted in pain as Steve ran past him into the room, looking desperately around.
, because I’m fucking
“Ty, give your lady some beer,” Jim urged. “She needs it.”
Tony cracked the door back open with wide eyes, desperately curious about the clumsiest home invader he’d ever encountered—and froze when an enormous shape started to rise from where it had been laying on the floor.
, however, going to show up in the newspapers,” said Maria, though she didn’t look angry. She put a hand to Nia’s shoulder. Nia glared at the floor and shrugged her off.
At least, she thought to herself, at least she knew she was important enough to
Nia winced. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “You…”  she swallowed. She didn’t want to cry again; she’d cried too much today, but she felt weak. “I spent my entire life preparing for one thing. I did the best I could; I did the best
Carol brushed Nia’s hair out of her face and kissed her, softly, on the forehead. “You never have to see him after today, okay, love?”
Clint shook his head. “He simply vanished. We have received no ransom demand, no communication of any kind. We have scoured the mountain many times over. There is no trail, and no remnant of him whatsoever.”
He was more handsome than Steve had remembered. Tony was eighteen now, and he had lost all but the final dregs of childhood roundness in his face. His jaw was solid, his chin proud and jutting. His eyes sparkled still as he looked over at Steve, and Steve…
He reached for her head, tilted it one way, and then the other, shone a light in her eyes, and then applied pressure to her jaw, so her mouth opened against her will.
Ty waggled his eyebrows and tossed Jim a salute.
“Seal the doors!” Lord Fury roared. “Nobody leaves this room until I say so!”
Then something strange happened. At first, Steve thought the sun was rising again. There was an odd glow emanating from the same direction, but after a moment of confusion he realized that the glow was coming from the
As much as he wanted this very masculine development to help reduce the inappropriate affection Steve had for the other man, it seemed—to his despair—to have quite the opposite effect.
“You say that like home’s so peachy,” Nia retorted, feeling a little queasy as she thought of Ty..
She bit her lip; her face felt numb, and it wasn’t from the cold. “Unless I do,” she said, slowly, as the realization came to her.
“They will not stop until they do so,” Tony said staunchly.
“Surprise,” Ty replied, as he pointed to a reporter.
Her parents exchanged a glance. Howard chuckled. "Just the one."
“That’s because it
For a moment, Pepper visibly struggled with herself, obviously wanting to believe him but feeling nonetheless wary. “We must find out if the problem is with his memory or… something else.”
Steve nodded, gave the kidnapping murderer a stony look, then followed after Clint.
“As far as I can tell,” said Doctor Yinsen. “We’re in the Hydra base. You…”  He went quiet.  His face was ashen; his expression grim. “You were knocked out. Something’s happened to you, but I think it would be best for you to hear it from the doctors.”
,” Howard implored, rubbing his forehead. “Get out of the car. We need to talk.”
“Spider,” Tony repeats, remembering vaguely what the guy had started babbling about as soon as Tony had opened the door. At the time he’d been occupied with blinking blearily at what he could only assume was a vivid, exhaustion-provoked hallucination of an Actual Angel descended before him. “In your bathtub.”
Her mother had looked a little sad at that. “Annie,” she’d said. “Your entire life, people are going to judge you. They’re going to say you don’t deserve what you have, they’re going to accuse you of getting where you are by cheating your way, by doing things you would never do, they’re going to underestimate your intelligence.”
He held back as long as he could, but the horses were slowed practically to a crawl as they made up the final distance to the gatehouse, and Tony could stand it no more. He flung open the carriage door and ran past both the carriage and the horses, a smile wide on his face.
Tony was out there, somewhere, and Steve was going to bring him home.
Nia whistled low. “Guess you can do that, huh?”
Tony was quiet on the ride home. He spent the trip seated upon Liberty’s back, since she was the horse he knew best. She was also officially Steve’s now that he had purchased her from Sir Alexander, and Steve trusted her with Tony, and her alone. Steve alternated with the others walking the way back, though it slowed their pace considerably. The one-day trip took them two days to complete anyway, as Tony’s malnourishment and general ill health did not lend itself particularly well to extended periods upon horseback.
