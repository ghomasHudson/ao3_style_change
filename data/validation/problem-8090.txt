Steve can’t speak, and the screen door creaks open. He turns to see Beth, who looks as nosy as a teenager possibly can.
“Great,” Steve says, still thumbing at his phone and patting his front pockets to ensure he’s got his wallet. “Just let me lock up, and we can get going.”
Steve can’t help but grin.
It’s clear deflection, more of Tony’s inability to confront the real issue at hand. No longer possessing the patience to deal with it, Steve grips the cardboard box tighter, feeling it bend under his fingertips. “You know that’s not my problem,” Steve says. “But I think we both know that you’re not capable of talking about the actual problem.”
His first thought is to pray that Pepper knows kids can be easily swayed, and he just spent a week indulging her daughter’s every whim, but then Steve feels like he could burst with the feeling he’s experiencing, so he squeezes Morgan back.
They make it to the beach twice more, and Tony stays on the sand while Steve dog paddles out with Morgan. They buy cheap sunglasses from a pharmacy: Morgan gets pink hearts, Steve gets aviators with orange lenses, and Tony acts like he’s too good for a pair until he snaps up some hideous purple and green things.
He declines the cocktails but accepts the questionable meat and cheese sampler and a packet of Skittles that remind him of Lance. Before he deplanes, he counts out a generous number of bills and refuses to let her turn them down. She blushes and he knows it’s going to be a story she tells everyone she meets, how a post-apocalyptic Captain America had flown in the first row and given her a hefty tip.
the case.”
During those bleak five years, Steve had blamed himself for refusing to compromise.
“No.”
When Fury becomes director, Steve manages to get a message to him via Peggy who is still as sharp as ever.
The snow isn’t falling fast enough to pose a problem, the ground not yet cold enough to allow it to gather enough to hamper the drive back into the city, but Tony nods at the implication - at the unspoken need to get far, far away, as soon as possible - and doesn’t press any further.
Tony cracks an eye open and directs it at where Steve’s clutching the arms of the chair. Aware of how firmly he’s holding on, Steve loosens his grip.
It’s got to be a dream, he decides, once he’s put himself together enough to stumble out of the room and down a set of stairs that deserve a feature in Architectural Digest if they haven’t had one already. He pulls out his phone halfway down, jots down the phrase in a draft to use in his article, and hurries down the rest of the stairs. Thank god for open concept floor plans, he thinks absently, beelining for the front door and groaning at how expensive it’s going to be to find a taxi willing to come all the way out to what he assumes is Tony Stark’s personal residence, based upon a vague recollection of a conversation - had he been on a private jet last night? - in which Tony had ridiculously pleaded the fifth after impressing upon Steve how vital it was that he was at his company’s Los Angeles airstrip bright and early in the morning.
“Should I assume we’ll be seeing you tonight?” Clint asks, hopping up and cursing when one ankle wobbles perilously. “Unless, you know, you’re too good for us now that you’ve been inducted into the very elite club of ‘People Who Have Blown Tony Stark and Lived to Tell the Tale.’”
Steve sells the bike for scraps once they’ve got enough together to buy an old SUV. Denise teaches the older kids how to parallel park and do three-point turns on the weekends in empty parking lots, and Josie shoves Steve out the door one Monday night.
“Point is,” he continues, “it’s up to you.”
“You’ve seen
Peter, who’s been doing a good job of keeping his head down and laughing at all the appropriate moments while tucking into his food, jerks his head up while his knee hits the bottom of the table.
Those goddamn brown eyes narrow, and all the air whooshes out of Steve’s lungs as he bobs a little too low, coming perilously close to getting water up his nostrils like a fucking idiot who’s too dazed by the man in front of him to swim properly.
She doesn’t answer him.
Tony doesn’t argue, even if it looks like he might. They both know the chance of Tony ever needing anything from him is nonexistent, but the not-quite-closed door will have to be enough of an offering to leave behind.
“My assistant,” Tony says, watching Steve with satisfaction plain on his face. “She’s got a sensitive nose and complained a lot.”
“What secret?” Rogers asks. “Is it - what does she think I need to know?”
“I’ll be inside in a second,” he promises, and Beth nods. She lingers, but he raises his eyebrows at her, and she looks guilty before disappearing.
Steve screws up his face, concentrates real hard, and then -
In the back of his mind, Steve tries to hold on, but there’s nothing to grasp at besides heat and Tony’s smooth skin. He grunts Tony’s name until it’s all he remembers and Tony is beautiful, so beautiful that Steve can’t help but reach down and feel for him. As much as they want to take their time, it’s not long before Tony is crying out and he’s so gorgeous when he whimpers like that, coming completely undone until he’s trembling and Steve is pleading for him. When he falls apart all over Steve’s hand and stomach, that’s all it takes for Steve to see stars and follow him while crying out, thoroughly worn out and unable to resist any longer.
“Ready if you are.”
you spent all this time thinking I wanted to play twenty questions with you.”), Steve can almost ignore the looming self-imposed deadline.
What looks like the vague outline of a squirrel scampers across the neighbor’s driveway, almost too speedy to really see as it travels from tree to tree. It’s gotten late and street lamps and the moon are the only real sources of light, but it’s enough for them. The air is still, thick enough to swim through, but there’s no rush to go back inside.
“I suppose it is about time, isn’t it?” he says, like the idea has never occurred to him. “Us, men - we’ve got a bigger window. Not like Peg.”
Tony’s hand slips in his and holds firm. He’s a little shaky, but Steve just holds right back, and that fixes everything.
Steve eases up onto his elbows and looks around. Aside from the flora and fauna, he appears to be alone.
“You ever think about how long you’ll stay?” Josie asks, out of the blue.
“Who told you?” Steve asks, rotating the vegetable skewers.
But then he’d found himself on his phone, a specter guiding him to revisit the short-and-sweet text message Tony had shot him.
“I like Steve’s beard the way it is!” Alexa exclaims, panicked.
He thinks he misses his old friends. If he can call them that.
“To be fair, I’m not sure the planet could safely contain both your ego and hers for any significant period of time.”
“Thought you’d be interested in hearing what they had to say about Stark,” Sam says frankly. “You two have got some kind of history, don’t you?”
Feeling queasy, like the cold coffee might be making its way back up his throat, Steve carefully lifts his own hands to lock thumbs and forefingers around Tony’s wrists. He might as well be moving in slow motion for how long it takes, doing his best not to tremble as he pulls Tony’s baffled hands away from his face with surgical precision. Tony doesn’t protest or stiffen as Steve moves him. That, at least, Steve is grateful for.
“Well, yes,” Pierce says, leaning back against the edge of his too-large desk and crossing his arms over his chest, still holding the damn remote. The volume is too loud.
doing.”
Because for all that Tony Stark has toned things down in the last year and a half, Iron Man has become a more gallant presence than ever. He’s amassed a small group of teammates, been seen protecting countless civilians, and prevented at least a dozen horrific events on varying scales, ranging from false alarm bomb threats to the potential destruction of the entire planet. At least, that’s been the rumor going around anytime someone is forced to defend what Tony had done in Sokovia.
When Steve appears in the bathroom doorway, Tony almost wants to tell him to pause. Six-foot-plus of Herculean strength on display, from the slope of his traps to the familiar corded length of his quads as he walks with an impeccable center of gravity; it contrasts charmingly against the nervous twitch of his upper lip, one of his admittedly few tells that Tony doesn’t know if he’s aware of. It’s a rare sight, miles of flawless skin on display and the thrill it sends right to Tony’s cock has him involuntarily jerking in his own hand. If Steve weren’t as hard as he is, bobbing enticingly between his legs, Tony might consider being embarrassed.
“What do you guys do here?” he asks, because it’s more polite than,
Tony grimaces magnificently, letting go of the framing and letting the door swing fully closed behind him. Steve attempts to remind himself that the man in front of him isn’t his responsibility, but people choke on their own vomit all the time, and remembering that is all it takes to push open a stall door and coax Tony forward, free hand outstretched in case he needs the support. He doesn’t, shoulders drawn tight as he stumbles forward till he’s standing over the toilet, bent at the waist in a way that looks supremely uncomfortable.
Steve checks the status of the hot dogs. “What’s wrong with not wanting to get sunburned?”
It’s hard not to be enchanted with the way Tony seamlessly integrates himself into the house. Even though Steve is tired from the day he’s had and the toll their drive and conversation has taken on him, he can’t look away as Tony listens to Ben try to explain some of the finer points of the plot. Alexa butts in here and there to explain things her way, and Tony gives them each his full attention.
“Okay,” Tony says, and the gears are whirring, considering angles and weighing pros and cons. After a very brief argument that Steve narrowly wins by convincing Tony that he’s got a much higher pain tolerance than any kind of positioning could conceivably compensate for, he pushes at the back of one of Steve’s thighs and stares at the scene before him.
“He’s gone,” Tony’d confirmed.
“You could’ve done that earlier,” Steve says, and it’s unnecessary because they both know it. He says it anyway, and Tony responds anyway.
“Or we can go back to just kissing,” Steve offers. “I was trying to be polite. Didn’t want to force anything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And then he wraps his tiny hand around Steve’s index finger, grip as tight and sure as anything. Steve feels the panic rising in his throat, the cognitive dissonance threatening to overcome him, and he can’t do this. He looks at Peggy, knowing he must be wild-eyed and spooked, and she comes over to save him.
The SuperTarget is blissfully cool, the AC on full blast, and Steve commandeers a cart with all the authority of the former Captain America as Tony pulls his slightly sweaty shirt away from his body.
Tony crosses his arms over his chest and flops around. “
“He’s not moping,” Bucky says, and he glances at Steve. “He just lives there, like the rest of us.”
Tony leans back in the oversized chair, elbows propped on the armrests and fingers steepled precisely. He regards the room carefully, knowing that he’s posturing but unable to resist the temptation to regain control of the situation.
It’s the longest day Steve has ever had, and he has had many long days in his lives.
Tony jabs a finger in his chest.
“I miss my mommy,” Tony yawns, and Peggy tuts sympathetically.
“I take back what I said last night.”
“Great,” Tony says, and his sudden put-upon smile cuts deep, vicious and overexaggerated. “Another old man, here to tell me what a horrible loss this is. Someone else here to tell me all the great things Howard accomplished, like I haven’t grown up hearing it all, being told that I’ll never - ”
Tony turns around on a heel, concealing a wince at the sudden movement with a raised eyebrow.
“Is everything alright?”
“Me? I’m peachy keen. You think there’s anything under here?” he asks, indicating the slightly raised bed before him.
It’s like slipping on a favorite sweater as Tony shows Steve around. It’s a house, Tony supposes, but stresses that it’s important not to draw an excess of parallels between that which exists in this plane and that back on Earth.
She flops into a chair, mouth running a mile a minute, and Steve heads inside.
“Okay,” Denise relents. “One movie, if everyone gets ready for bed. But then it’s to your rooms for the night.”
Yeah, that definitely won’t be making it into the profile.
For once, Steve doesn’t seem to be offended as he shrugs it off.
“How could I have known?” Steve entreats. “It’s not as though I’ve died before.”
Rogers shrugs, still in his tactical gear, leaning just inside the door with his arms crossed and the shield still on his back. “Easy,” he says, eyes trained on Tony, just a touch too intense before he appears to remember himself, and nods at Steve like he’d been expecting to see him.
“I’m not doing anything,” she says, but it’s unnecessary. He’s trusted her for a long time.
“You won’t find anything,” Steve says, drowning out JARVIS’s response. “Why would you? Peggy founded SHIELD, she’d never let that information see the light of day. I’ll eat my shoe if anyone else knows.”
“Natasha,” he murmurs, and she leans into his palm. When he looks, she is out of focus and just as beautiful as he remembers.
“They’re your family too,” Tony says, and he sounds as angry as Steve feels. “I could move to Malibu. Save myself the trouble of personally escorting Morgan to upstate New York every other week.”
“Might just want to call and chat sometimes,” Tony says, and the words ping familiar, but this time, Steve embraces them with everything he’s got.
“No orange juice,” Sam says, pulling a shirt on as he enters, Carol and Rhodes coming in behind him. “Hey, man. Look at you.”
One of Natasha’s widow bites goes flying between them, landing on the floor amongst remnants of Steve’s uniform with a painful buzzing sound.
“Rental,” Tony supplies, like he can read Steve’s mind. “Want to go for a drive?”
It’s enough for him to pause, and Tony scoops banana-granola-almond milk into his mouth while he ponders a way to approach this sensitive topic.
There’s no way this is his Steve, because while he’s always been bold where it counts, he’s never been forward like this.
“Well, that’s not going anywhere anytime soon,” Tony says to no one in particular, peering at the massive bruise staining the length of his flank. “J, we sure there’s no internal bleeding?”
For a long time, he had wavered over the best time to intervene. It hadn’t been like after the fall of SHIELD, when there had been no question about what he needed to do. He had sat at the table well into the night, night after night, mapping out different ways it could all play out and missing his battle-sharp skills, his determination, had missed not caring about having more than a rough plan because he trusted himself to improvise and survive.
“Well,” Tony says, the single syllable stretching between them like taffy as he flicks his lighter. “Not like you’d write about it if I did.”
part to focus properly, illicit scenarios lighting through his brain like wildfire, and he coughs into a fist while rocking back and forth on his heels, hoping to get rid of whatever way he’d been looking at Steve that had made him offer up an alternative.
“Nah,” Steve says, and they both get up, chairs scraping on the unpolished floor. Tony leaves the empty bottle and glasses where they are, figuring he can deal with them later. “We’re in the home stretch now. Gotta keep focused.”
(Which means that he’s ninety-nine percent sure that it would be news to Steve, who would protest and attempt to disprove the very notion if Tony ever endeavored to get him to see it.)
The bottle is empty, and Tony resolves to never drink with two super-soldiers ever again. When he mentions this aloud, Steve wryly replies that he’d barely had any of the scotch, and if he wants to complain, he can complain about the old man who has since retired for the night.
He heard his Dad give a gentle laugh before he hung up. Peter shook his head, moving to set the bowl in the sink, only to… not be able to let go. Well, his fingers moved, but the bowl was practically stuck to his hand. He made a soft noise of confusion, blinked to try and figure out if he was just dreaming. Got, he hoped he was just dreaming.
After the demonstration, Tony road with three soldiers, drank and listened to loud music. They took pictures. It was the epitome of the funvee!
“Here’s your alibi,” the agent said. “You were on your yacht. We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.”
“True,” the man said with a smirk, his eyes moving to look over Peter’s shoulder. “But you have him to thank for this.”
Thor didn’t reply, and seemed to wander off in a daze. Steve went to follow, try to get to his teammate, only for Natasha to be be attacked. His eyes widened, and he tried to figure out what to do. Bucky and Clint were still active, and he could still fight.
“You don’t sound to good, Tony,” Steve always said. “You sure you don’t need a doctor?”
Tony had been hoping that after they'd taken down Hydra SHIELD, he would have the courage to ask Steve out. Instead, he was busy working, distracting Wade, and trying go think of a good time to ask Steve on a date.
Steve didn't sound angry, though, and Tony pursed his lips as he moved to the dining table to open it up. “No, it shouldn't have. A prosthetic is never meant to hurt. Even if it's connected to the brain like his and-” Tony stopped, squinting at the inner workings of the arm. “There aren't any dampeners.”
“Your eyes are red,” he said. “A few tears for you long-lost boss?”
His worst fears had come true and he was horrified to find the cell empty. Wilson stood in the hall, beaming like an idiot, and
STARK: In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.
“This framework is not compatible,” Tony grumbled, doing his best to rework everything.
As he flew back home, he got a call from Rhodes.
XxXXxX
“I’m sorry,” Tony said, pulling his hand away. “But who are you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony scowled at the letter in his hands, even as Pepper was leaning against his desk.
Wade hopped a bus to get to New York. After all that stuff with Hydra, he had grabbed Bob and had dragged him away before the feds could book them. He was an underage merc, after all. Swords and guns and shit ass humor. And Bob was Hydra. True, a ‘Hydra Youth Intern’ and a complete crap of one, but still Hydra.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And what’s with the whole story that it’s a bodyguard? He’s my… I mean, is that… That’s kinda flimsy, don’t you think?”
"Yup," he said, popping the P. "It's the same place I got the first one. Just, you know, hidden 'between the folds of reality', whatever that means."
“Hi, Rhodey, it’s me.”
So the Friday date didn't happen thanks to Coulson asking them to go take out a Hydra facility in Missouri. More like misery… Steve just wanted to take Tony to this little Italian place he knew from back in the 40’s. It was still standing and still as good!
Honestly, is was like a Christmas miracle, as cheesy as that sounded to Tony. Peter was starting to move on, and that was really all that Tony could ask for. When the break hit, Peter asked to go to Ned’s for a while, and Tony was just so happy, he just told Peter to go. The kid had been spending more and more time in the mask. Honestly, it wasn’t healthy.
“Well,” Wade drawled as he dropped onto the couch next to Al. “The cock-sucker that turned me into this butter faced creep, who I spent the last two years waiting to murder, slipped through my hands today.” He paused, then scowled at his slowly growing stump. “
“A safehouse for a dog?” Tony couldn’t stop from coming out.
Peter could feel the tension in the room the moment he got home. His parents were having some kind of fight, which happened often enough, but this seemed… different. They normally hid it from him, not wanting him to be exposed to a broken home or think that they were a broken home. This time, they were actually arguing in front of him.
“Oh!” he gasped, a mix of faux surprise and giddy pleasure. “I’m the focus right now? How exciting!” With a giggle, he rolled up the map before anything on it could be seen. “Trying to peek at my work, Wolfy? To bad. It’s not gonna work~ After all…” Even through his mask, still firmly in place, his face went dark. “I’m taking full control now. And there’s nothing you can do about it~”
“That’s Daddy’s heart now,” Tony said to Peter, who he once again had at his hip.
“He was in love with me?”
“There is a book of documents in my bedside drawer,” he says calmly, at peace with what is to come. “In case something happens. Everything that was worth anything was in Peggy’s name, and I had it transferred to yours upon her passing. Including the house. It’s yours to do what you wish with.”
As Peter and Bucky start bickering about alternative breakfast beverages, Steve can’t help but smile and push the second mug Tony’s way. When it earns him a curious look, Steve just says, “In case someone tries to steal yours again.”
“You mean like you clearly want me to?” Steve counters, because he’s smart and knows that Tony thinks he should start wading through the remnants of the tragic legacy that had been left behind for him.
“Yes,” he says, because it’s an easy question with an easy answer.
like he’s a part of it.
“Alright,” Steve says, injecting the words with as much earnestness as he can muster, considering his disappointment at the lack of a proper goodbye. “You’ll call and chat.”
Steve squeezes his eyes closed, squeezes Tony’s hands in his.
Steve meets so many people his head swims. It’s almost entirely kids and young adults, a few older individuals who lost their kids and only just got them back but want to keep at the work. It’s a Saturday, and Callie groans with Beth about homework while Elliot reads a well-worn paperback that’s definitely not for school. When a young woman who introduces herself as Josie slots into the seat across from him, with a wild head of tightly coiled hair and big gold hoops in her ears, Steve shifts and wonders if he’s made a mistake.
“So Tony’s really here?” he asks, not even bothering to keep the incredulous relief out of his voice.
Denise leaves with a sad smile, and Steve cracks open his Coke and goes back to work, tuning out Beth’s chattering a few seats down. She’s good on the phones - gets people to stay on the line long enough to talk about the hard stuff.
“From both of us,” he says, jaw set with determination. “We don’t need it anymore.”
“Is it bad?” Steve asks, scrubbing a hand over his jaw. He’d managed a painstakingly close shave that morning, but there’s somehow a phantom rasp of stubble against his chin. “It’s cheesy, isn’t it?”
“There is no swear jar,” he insists.
“Thanks, man,” Sam says, doing just that. He tugs his jacket off the wall hook and bundles up while Steve makes his way over to see him out. It’s a surprise when Sam finishes up his zipper and tugs Steve in for a brief one-armed hug, but not an unwelcome one.
Tony rests his chin in the palm of his hand, speculative, eyes still bright and reflecting the renovated kitchen back at Steve.
kitchen - ”
Steve clears his throat and reaches for the water to steel himself. He doesn’t want to let his temper get the better of him and derail the interview. It’s been going well so far, all things considered.
Tony clamps his mouth shut, and Steve kisses away the beginnings of a frown.
Tony swallows past the tangle of heat and want in his throat, knowing that in the grand scheme of things, there are more important things to be said than how much he wants Steve to kiss him again, preferably on the mouth.
“‘What’s up?’ Are you serious right now? You’re really asking me that? Do you have any idea what time it is?”
“Tell me I’m wrong,” Pepper says with a yawn. “Is that all, then? You called to tell me that you’re on your honeymoon?”
“I’m serious,” Tony says, limbs akimbo as he attempts to straighten his ass on the seat and settle his feet on the floor. “Get in, or I’ll tell Joe here not to leave until you do.”
Whether easier or not, Steve can’t help but look at Tony, willing him to connect the dots so that Steve doesn’t have to explicitly lay it all out for him. Tony merely blinks, for once not filling a purposeful silence.
Sam stretches an arm out along the back of the couch, too comfortable if Steve ignores how they run together most mornings and split their Saturdays between each other's places. He can’t seem to remember, rankled by the familiarity just as he’d be by anything else in this particular moment after that particular phone call. It’s not fair to Sam, but it’s better him than anyone who’d be more likely to fire back at Steve’s sudden bad mood with nasty equivalence.
“Do you - ”
“Well, obviously,” Steve says, lips curling into a sarcastic smile. “Obviously we all hate them. Why do you think we’re here?”
“I’ll check with my editor, but I’m sure she’d be more than happy to publish something, especially with our online traffic growth as of late,” he says, recovering as fluidly as he’s capable of when confronted with a Tony who looks more jaded than he used to, who wears every minute of his capture and subsequent ordeal in the lines of his face and the curve of his posture. He’s still handsome, though, Steve thinks admirably, before amending - he’s even more handsome for it all, if possible.
In the context of the time they’ve spent together yesterday and today, it’s incredibly confusing, and Steve is thrown off guard. Unwilling to be caught vulnerable again, he swallows involuntarily and dares himself to meet Tony’s gaze.
Morgan serves as an excellent distraction. She demands near-constant entertainment, and Steve is more than happy to provide it to her. He builds a blanket fort and tells Morgan age-appropriate scary stories that make her laugh until her stomach hurts. Tony makes pina coladas, adds rum to his and Steve’s, and Steve secretly loves the way Tony’s tongue loosens until he’s singing along to a Top Hits playlist that he claims he has nothing to do with. Various scrunchies make their way into Steve’s hair, and when he teaches Morgan how to flip a pancake, a velvet red one ties it all up in some semblance of a messy bun.
“I can go, if you want me to,” Sam offers. He’s not even bothering to conceal his grin behind the lip of one of Steve’s mugs, and the promise of coffee is enough to signal the release of the pressure valve in Steve’s chest. He straightens up, eases the clenched grip he has on his nearly-empty protein shake, and does his best to smooth his face out into something less furrowed and more neutral.
Steve lets Tony fly him back in the Quinjet, but only because it gives him more time with everyone.
“Morgan,” Tony says, and Steve nods. “I guess I’ve got to set a good example for her, or whatever. That’s what Pete said. Guess I’ve got to set a good example for him, too.”
“Nope,” Tony says with a smirk. “Really did fly into a wormhole.”
“I miss them,” Steve admits.
“Do you feel this?” Steve says, hushed and humble. “The universe let a man from another timeline come here to make sure we ended up together. Do you really think the universe would let something so significant happen only once?”
Rather than light up as Steve had expected he would, Tony sips his coffee long and slow. It takes effort for Steve not to squirm or get impatient, but eventually -
“Nice,” Tony says appreciatively, and then he’s under the covers. “Do you mind if I get the light, or - ”
“Is he really your friend?” she asks, quietly, and he’s reminded of the girl he met six months prior.
“I’ve got it,” she mumbles, and he can see her wipe her face as she reaches for the phone. “Hello?”
It’s not anger that he feels, because anger is too easy and whatever emotions Steve’s held towards Tony for the last couple of years are complicated, to say the least. He won’t do himself a disservice to reduce it all down to something as simple and secondary as
Regardless, the blatant dismissal burns third degree as Steve’s door opens from the outside.
“We help Denise and Josie with whatever they need,” Beth says, after a particularly large bubble. “We go around asking for people to donate supplies, we sit with the younger kids. Elliot is really good with the babies.”
“So show me,” Steve says, determined and pink-cheeked. “Show me how you thought about it.”
There’s too much of Steve’s strength behind it to call the kiss tender, but Tony comes embarrassingly close. The yearning inside of him spirals up from the pit of his stomach, dormancy disappearing as Steve adjusts his grip, fingers feathering out and securely holding on now that Tony isn’t pulling away. Tony kisses back, primarily as an instinctual reaction to being kissed, but as the fevered surprise fades, it leaves behind a striking awareness that this is
He can barely find it in him to care, sitting vigil by Peggy’s bedside, not wanting to miss a thing. Whatever chain of events will separate this universe from his have been set into motion, and he can no longer guarantee that things will happen exactly as they did for him before.
“It’s not even eight. This is a perfectly normal time to be calling,” he points out, because he actually does remember all the conversations about appropriate out-of-office conduct.
“Together,” he says. “And yeah, maybe that time I was the one who left. But I thought I made it clear this time around. I didn’t want it to be like that ever again. When I came back? When I brought your shield and solved time travel for you and wore the gauntlet? Did none of that make it painfully, abundantly clear that I intended for the rest of it to be together?”
“Did I miss something?” she asks, sitting on the step behind them. Steve reluctantly allows for distance between himself and Tony, just enough for her to wiggle in and rest her chin on Steve’s shoulder. Tony pops a kiss to her cheek, and Steve can practically feel her responding smile.
Tony taps his fingers against the steering wheel.
“Why do you ask?”
It’s so Steve, so certain and patient at all the worst times. His giant hands cradle Tony’s head like he’s trying to protect him from something, and they’re half-sprawled on the steps where anyone could poke their head out their front door and see them if they tried hard enough. Tony wants more, but he also doesn’t want to push whatever this thing is, so he kisses Steve until his lips feel raw and he’s well on his way to learning exactly how far he can go before Steve slows it down.
“There’s so much to do,” Steve says, and he understands Josie’s anger. “A million cities, just like this one.”
They sit in mostly silence with the exception of placing their orders. He feels his stomach growl and realizes he hasn’t eaten in nearly twenty-four hours, not since he’d downed a triple espresso and eaten an almond croissant in two bites between meetings the previous morning, before the call to Assemble.
“You do,” Beth says, and her ice cream is chocolate and studded with marshmallows and streaks of fudge. “Besides. The corner store was having a two-for-one special.”
Floating around the party like an actual guest isn’t exactly recommended; there’s a press room for a reason, no matter how much of an effort Christine puts into harassing Alison Williams, something Steve’d attempted to remind her that she’s not supposed to do regardless of how famous her father is. But Steve lingers on the edges, by the bathrooms, by the bar, and waits to strike when these people are on the verge of letting their guard down. It’s worked well for him so far: he’s gotten skincare advice from Jesse Tyler Ferguson’s rather handsome boyfriend, helped Amy Poehler locate one of her sitcom co-stars, and spent a solid five minutes making fun of the photo booth set up with an actor who’d look a lot like Clint if Clint ever bothered to ditch the purple t-shirts and wash his hair.
Tony lifts one hand to stroke at his chin, sinking further into the chair.
Well, Steve reconsiders, that might be a bit melodramatic. Tony looks like he’s been stood up, which is ridiculous because Steve doubts that Tony’s ever had that particular experience. And he’s not even going to address the utter insanity that would have to occur in order for Tony to ask anything of Steve that would even remotely resemble a date.
She refuses to go until he explains, so they compromise, and he explains in the car. They both cry and she clutches his hand, furious and demanding to know why he thought he couldn’t do a thing about any of it.
“Wouldn’t miss you one bit,” Rhodes coughs, pounding a fist on his chest.
“If you know me, then you knew him,” Steve says, weighty without all the negative connotations of heavy, and Tony nods, parsing through the sentiment and running through several dozen responses in his head. It takes mere milliseconds to come to a decision, and he walks around the hood of the car before holding out an arm, beckoning Steve onward.
“We’re just trying to get along,” Steve says, but suddenly it feels suspect. “Morgan’s been with us the entire time.”
Suddenly overwhelmed, Steve gets to his feet. He’s unsteady but shakes off Tony’s offer to help.
“We’ll put you on phones,” she says decisively. “You don’t look like you scare easy.”
He breaks off with a cry, and Steve doesn’t know what to do.
“I hope he’s all healed soon, then,” he says, forcing himself to keep his tone even no matter how badly he can feel it wanting to wobble.
It’s easy to tell that Tony is holding back. It’s easy to tell that he doesn’t approve of the way Steve went about it all, lying low and refusing to touch a single thing. It’s easy to tell that he’s disappointed and Steve isn’t sure he’s trying to hide it at all, and he defends his actions as best as he can.
He waits for Steve to struggle it out, watches Steve get distracted by a sudden rush of pleasure, mouth opening and closing erratically like he wants to speak but literally can’t string a syllable together, and Tony keeps at it just like that, raining kisses down on Steve’s face from his eyebrows to his chin to keep from losing himself in the wet-enveloping-fiery bliss that’s being inside of Steve like this.
Tony would feel guilty, but two days later he passes through to spy Rogers tentatively testing Bruce’s latest recipe for tamales.
So Steve picks up his duffel and lets himself be led back to the residential area, cool nighttime track lighting kicking in. When Tony stops them in front of a door that looks just like the others, Steve does as instructed and uses his handprint to let himself in. FRIDAY welcomes him and the room looks so much like the one he had at the old compound with similar furniture and coloring.
A feeling not unlike that which Steve felt in Alexander Pierce’s office way back when descends, and the paralysis barely allows Steve to croak, “Iron Man’s retiring?”
“You could come upstate,” Tony says with practiced nonchalance, and the thought of this being something that he’s had to work up to gives Steve a funny feeling in his stomach.
“You couldn’t have let me in on that little secret?” he asks, annoyed.
Of course, Steve thinks, looking at the reflection of a very rumpled, very sweaty, very inebriated Tony Stark.
She shrugs, “He’s
"Have known? For years? Yes." Tony grimaces, "That's besides the point. If he's come he'll--"
“I t’ink,” the man says slowly, “perhaps, it would be betta to show you.” He gestures to the TV at the back of the room, grabs the remote, and turns it on. “It is… unpleasant,” he manages.
“Because you’re special, Carol.”
“What? Is there something wrong?” Panic seeps into his voice and Tony literally can’t handle the stress right now.
"What?" Her head lifts up.
Her face closes off and he sees her pupils dilate... like her brain's going far away. "Death. Destruction; chaos. Evil." If Tony didn't know better he'd say that she was almost chanting it, or like another voice had layered on top of hers. But, that couldn't be possible.
“Tony…”
“Yes, sir,” Steve nods contritely.
Rhodey grinds his teeth and folds his arms angrily. “That asshole… I’ll tear him a new one.”
Jealously swirls deep in Tony’s gut, and he fights to push it down. “How… what’s your secret for long, successful relationships, Jay?” He asks ever so quietly.
She just laughs and gets a mad twinkle in her eye. This spells disaster, Tony decides. Richards has just dug himself a grave.
The room is quiet. Nobody responds. A knock comes at the door and Fury growls out, “Enter.”
“Your brother… Pietro is alive.”
The doctor looks mildly surprised, and then heartbroken. “My husband was a soldier,” he murmurs and starts rolling the wand thing across his belly.
Steve’s face has suddenly gone very, very pale. “Are you saying… D’ya mean-- Are you tellin’ me Stark ensured that those documents would never fall-- never have fallen into the wrong hands? That… that he
Stark huffs but doesn't respond. He looks off to the side and avoids eye-contact with anybody in the room. His fingers, now loose, are twitching like they're trying not to fiddle with something.
By the time Steve receives another call from the tiny flip phone he knows belongs to Tony, it’s not Tony’s voice he hears. Again.
"Th-that's really concerning, but we have Thanos to worry about right now. He's coming, Tony. He stole the power stone from Xandar just days ago - or weeks, maybe? - and decimated the planet. Tony, if he isn't here already he
The two just lean back and laugh and giggle ridiculously.

“The Tower.”
He raises a suspicious eyebrow. "I'll do my best."
Fury’s glare is terrifying and shuts the super soldier up right away. “You have. You’re lucky the bond was new and barely formed, otherwise one of you would have gone into a coma. Or, worse, gone feral.”
"D-done? J-Jen?"
Btw... any guesses as to which reality I've dropped him in on? *wink wink*
“I am sorry. I know… I know it’s not much, but I just. I never wanted this to happen, you know? I’d… there’s lots I could’ve done differently, but I can’t change the past–”
“You love me,” Tony counters.
They’re both going for blows, both aiming to hurt, but Steve wins again. “I’m not the self-centered one here,” Rogers growls.
Steve rushes into the Tower lobby and heads for the elevators. He presses the ‘Up’ button aggressively. He has to try to fix this.
He tries to focus on the room and his surroundings, but he’s dizzy and everything keeps fuzzing out at the corners. Okay, great, so a concussion then. Awesome. He catalogs his injuries: bruises everywhere, scrapes pretty much everywhere, possibly a dislocated shoulder, a twisted––he hopes––kneecap or leg, probably got a mass of fun bruises on his back, and a sprained wrist. Terrific. Could be worse, but all he cares about is that he can still sense Peanut. His baby is alive and nothing else matters. Well, he could stand to not be in this situation–that matters–but he’ll take what he can get for now.
“That’s great. Thanks for letting me know. What’s the nearest town?”
also, i feel the need to let everyone know that my chapters are probably going to be a lot shorter from now on. it just makes it easier on me that way, so i don't feel like i have to churn out pages and pages of words. hope that's alright. i'll do my best not to leave it right in the middle of something or not to have cliffhangers that feel more like a noose, though, ok? :)
“No, no.” The doctor grins broadly, “Would you like to know your babies’ sexes?”
Steve’s eyes go wide. “Really? The second quadrimester? But you’re–” He wisely decides not to finish that sentence when Tony’s eyes narrow.
? You alright? How--"
) so little faith in him, he hates that he can still get kidnapped, and he hates that he knows that this time no one is coming to rescue him. And, most of all, he hates that it isn’t just his life at risk right now.
Steve scrubs his face and lets his shoulders droop. “Let’s head back and see if T’Challa has any news.”
“Rhodes, it’s Cho.”
Tony's eyes go wide and he knows of only one mercenary crazy enough to dig through trash in his free time. He folds his arms and asks them to

“I… I was helping Cap, sir.”
Tony purses his lips together. He’s not being fair to Wanda. She may have hated him for his many sins back when he was a weapons dealer, and she may have sided with Steve and destroyed part of the Compound on her way out, but-- at the very least-- she wasn’t a supervillain.

“Like pumpkin pie.”

She huffs and stands. She folds her arms and arches back to look at the sky. “If you ever hurt him again,” she threatens, “there’ll be nothing left of you for anyone to find. Do you understand me?” Her green eyes glint in the sunlight and a shudder runs down Steve’s back from her murderous glare.
Ross smiles. "Breaking your contract, assault on federal agents, obstruction of justice, withholding information, being a public nuisance, damage to government property, etcetera, etcetera..."
Looks like they both have their demons after all.
Fuck. He needed Bruce.
how I got the name Black Widow.”
The man’s face turns purple, and then it’s smoothing out into a perfectly blank mask. That scares the shit out of the brunet. He isn’t sure how it happens, but suddenly there’s a pool of lava below him and his chair is on a little island. It’s sweltering.
“Tony told me something… that I think you’re going to want to hear.”
By the time Fancy Pants comes back, Tony’s probably got heat stroke. He’s exhausted, too, and he’s already peed himself.
and that is unacceptable.
She sighs and pads across the carpet to the curtains to open them. The natural light floods in and Tony blinks rapidly to clear the spots. "It's ironic that this is the happiest you've been, isn't it?" She's still facing the window, her back to him. She purses her lips and grief colors her voice. "I'm sorry it had to be like this, Tones. It's not fair to you. It's... never been fair to you."
"What!" Tony shouts indignantly. "Seriously?! Vision--"
["Hello? Tony? Is that you?"]
“I love you too, Tony.” She then looks down at his small, non-descript baby bump and pets it lovingly. “These twins are gonna have the best mom in the world, and the best aunts and uncles, too. They’re going to be so happy, you’ll see, Tony. You’ll be amazing at it. Hell, you’re amazing now.”
“Oh, god, I said– I talked to him like… like
“Jay!” He whips his head around and glares at her.

"Holy fuck," he hears and it sounds oddly like Barton's voice.
Which is how Cho finds him, some five minutes later, with his face plastered to the porcelain and his hair matted to his face. He’s miserable.

“Language, Captain,” Tony smiles wide.
“So,” Reed speaks up, “who was that?”
“Shit
“No! I mean: no, he’s not. We just,” Tony closes his eyes, “we disagreed, and he got angry. It was my fault; I didn’t explain my side well enough. We weren’t even… we weren’t dating, Rhodey, so it’s okay.”

“No worries, Cap,” Tony pats his belly and his eyes crinkle with joy. “I’m just carrying twins, is all.”

“I brought you one of those frappucino things, from that coffee place I mentioned. It’s not caffeinated,” Steve blushes as he assures Tony.
Whooshing sounds thread through his ears and he feels another panic attack coming on. Because this isn't possible.
Strange is propelled out another window and the fight moves outside.
“So how far along are you, now, Tony?” Steve asks one night after The Proposal has ended.
Clint swallows.
A twinge turns into agonizing pain that probably doesn't last for longer than a minute, but has Tony biting his lip and groaning in misery. When the pain abates, Tony's chest heaves and he pants out his breaths.
"Stones?" He spits out.
His brows pinch together and his confusion is palpable. He rests a hand on his swollen belly and asks, "Is it... is it

Steve’s features twist with impossible agony and grief. “Don’t leave me, I need to make this right. Don’t leave. Stay. Stay.” The rest of what he says drowns out into white noise.

whelming.

“I’m sorry. I am. I was out of control; I was
” Rogers does sound contrite, Cho will admit, but it’s not enough. Rogers is more at fault for the way things turned out than Tony ever will be. All this could have been avoided if Rogers had stopped for a moment to listen.
"He's already at 8 centimeters, and he's bleeding." the midwife tells the others with concern lacing her voice. "When did he start labor?"
“Damn right you went too far,” Fury thundered.
“What?”
(it's gonna get a whole hell of a lot worse before it gets better)
. Tony's told Peter the names, too, and that Peter's their honorary big brother. The poor kid almost starts crying he's so touched. Rhodey swings by more often, though Tony knows that Ross has been on his ass ever since Rhodey got more used to the braces and re-learned how to walk.
Tony turns and sure enough, it's Hawkeye himself.
He hears something about vibranium, about S.H.I.E.L.D., about an invasion, and about Wakanda.
“Awesome. Deny access.”
“Couple of weeks from the looks of it.”
to happen.
“Never,” she grins.
Steve holds his throat and decides that probably the stupidest thing he’s ever done was to make an enemy out of Natasha Romanoff.
God, he looks so young. “Kid, how old are you?”
It takes all of Tony's willpower not to laugh. Again.
He pushes with all he can, crying and screaming with effort, when Steve brings Lucy closer.
It's Rhodey. He just... stares. He looks so put out and jealous, so Jacey dissolves into a fit of giggles.
“N-neither of us knew, then, Cap.” Tony can definitely feel his body start to shut down. He’s getting light-headed and he’s freezing.
“Hey, Steve,” Tony greets numbly. This should not be so goddamn hard.
Steve feels as if he’s been dismissed, so he gets up from the chair with contrition and shame clear in the lines of his face and in his body language.
“… He put Wanda on house arrest.”
Tony doesn’t know how long he’s been in captivity; he lost track at three weeks. He files the information he’s learned for later use and pondering. He goes back to being numb.
Before her brain catches up (which is unusual for her), she blurts, “Why do you care?” She doesn’t mean it maliciously, or even to hurt Steve. She genuinely wants to know.
Steve’s mouth twists into a self-depreciating and wry grin. “Yeah. I did make it all worse, didn’t I?”
"I don't know, Boss, I'm scanning now."
Luckily the contractions seem to ease back and only come every few minutes or so.
in the dark and he's moving the flip phone around in his hand.
Cho is sitting in a chair, awkwardly and crookedly, asleep. “Hey, sweetums, could I get something for the pain, please?” Tony asks rather loudly and winces.
Steve grits his teeth. “I saw.”
Besides, now that he’s decided to give Steve a second chance he’s going to make the blond damn well earn it. He smirks.
Adrenaline and panic course through his veins with equal measure and it leaves Tony reeling. He has to get up; he has to move. His babies are coming! So... he has to... has to...
Tony’s eyes lose focus and he can no longer see. He can hear Steve sobbing next to him, somewhere saying everything’s Tony’s ever wanted him to say.
As quietly as a mouse,
, a traitorous voice from somewhere in his heart whispers achingly.
“It wasn’t just sex,” Tony admits very, very quietly.
I go into brief detail about some A/B/O matters. Also Everett Ross is kind of an asshole.
“It’s gorgeous, isn’t it?”
Stones. Gems. Precious gems? He's still missing a piece of the puzzle.
"We think maybe Heimdall has the soul stone, Tony."
Tony chortles. “I am, and you know it.
"We have a problem."
“... you women and your intuition,” Tony murmurs. He closes his eyes and thumps his head onto the pillow.
Steve growls warningly.
Jacey opens the door and smiles guiltily at her friend who's laid up in bed with fluffed pillows and some TV show playing on low volume. "Hi, Tones."
"Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair?" He points.
“He took the fall. For all of us. I didn’t know when I left, and by the time I found out… I was already on the plane to here. I had to–” She takes in a shaky breath, “–I had to find out from the TV. Do you know how awful that was? That I could’ve been there if I’d just–” She crosses her arms and sits down heavily in a chair.
“Now, Agent Barton, I asked you a question.”
“Of course not!” He raises his voice indignantly, “It’s wrong to treat
When Steve knocks on the door and it swings open he doesn't expect it. When he sticks his head around the frame to peek inside he doesn't expect to stumble into a nest. He doesn't expect the scents to smell so... calming and home-like. He gently pads over to the sleeping trio and shakes Jacey awake. He tries to clench down on the jealousy rising in his chest.
Tony sighs with a little relief, even though he still worries. He almost wishes he weren't so damn pregnant. It's still odd to say that, he thinks. He's never thought it possible before, and even if he had known it was he didn't think he'd be a good father... he hadn't really wanted to

His babies. Oh, fuck, his babies. He'd completely forgotten he was in--
“Your leg and forehead, mostly. I don’t… I don’t know what else is broken–”

Tony is flabbergasted. "What? No! I'm talking about pheromones! And endotypes! I can't smell
She wipes her eyes, bright green shining with mirth and sadness. “You think you’re so funny,” she says flatly.
The doctor slaps Tony hard enough for him to see stars. “That necessary?” He grumbles.

“Yep. Still have loans, believe it or not. I probably wouldn’t if I hadn’t wanted adventure so much, but I can’t really regret it, ya know. I loved my travels.” There’s something oddly wistful about his voice.
"She's beautiful, Tony," Steve murmurs with tears in his eyes. Steve instinctively lays the baby on Tony's chest and the baby howls when she hears her mother's heartbeat. Tony feels a new wave of determination spread through him and he pushes. And pushes.
“About?” He sighs.
Steve frowns, puzzled, and opens his mouth to ask–
Tony lets out a weak chuckle. "Gotta love omegan parturition hormones. Didn't know they worked on other... intelligent species. 's interesting." Tony is so, so tired.
Goodbye, goodbye.
The drink in his other burns down his throat. He can't remember what glass he's on. He knows he hasn't finished the bottle yet, maybe he's trying to. He doesn't know. He just knows that he can feel the not-alcohol when before he could feel nothing. That dream had been awful...
“Jacey is a psychologist, actually, and her only policy is that she won’t resort to meds until every other option has been explored.”
“Yeah. Just… maybe… start by being his friend first. Get to know him. Sit with him and ask him about his day, about his projects, about his likes and dislikes; show him you care. Compliment him when you can, and give constructive criticism when you can’t.

Tony gives an airy laugh. "Y-Yeah."
The doctors have finally given him the all-clear to sign out. He would’ve signed out sooner, but Jacey is very persuasive at getting him to follow doctor’s orders. Cho and Bruce would be so jealous. He’d also just had another ultrasound and he’d found out that the babies were doing fine, he was approximately three months along, and –as he expected– he’d need to go on bed-rest in three months from now. As it was, the doctors told him it would be wise to take things very easy, to not bend over, and to not lift things over ten pounds. He sighed. He was going to be

it would be to give in and to let Steve rock his world all over again. To let Steve make Tony lose his mind in toe-curling pleasure.
"That's a good name," she smiles gently, encouraging.
Tony heaves out a sigh and lays against the scratchy hospital pillows.
“Rogers,” Fury’s violent attention is back and Steve shrinks, “what is she talking about?”
He manges to crawl a little bit, but it doesn't get him far. He's grabbed by the neck and hauled up by an alien who looks like Squidward.
"What?" Tony's world spins to a stop and he feels his heart drop to his stomach. There's a faint buzzing in his ears. Don't panic, he tells himself. Don't.
“Which is why,” Steve takes a deep breath and steels himself, “I won’t ask you to let me be apart of the baby’s life. I– I think you’re going to be a great dad, Tony, and I don’t deserve you or the baby. I haven’t treated you right, and I’m going to change that from here on forward. You have my word.”
There's a hushed silence, now, Tony realizes belatedly. The air is tense and awkward. The other group-members are shuffling their feet like they're...
right now. He can’t be the Steve that– that Tony...

“Hey!” He squawks indignantly.

Deadpool? Seriously?"
How is this his life again?
She loosens the wire and heads for the exit. “You’re getting sloppy, Rogers,” she says to the man behind her.
Natasha’s surprise seems to increase. She hadn’t missed the glance he’d made. “How mature of you,” she manages through something that feels like a frog in her throat and knives in her chest.
“Yes,” the man’s voice cracks and he looks awful now.
“T’Challa–”
“We’re just outside of Sergelen. Zuunmod is the closest city, but the hospital there is...questionable. Ulaanbaatar is a far better choice, but 60 kilometers is… a great distance for one in your condition.”
His voice is a hoarse whisper.
Temper, temper, Stark, Tony thinks idly. "Yeah. She was kidnapped by Killian and he injected her with Extremis, but I gave her a counter-acting agent of the strain to make her more or less baseline. And, well, a lot less... volatile," Tony winces as he thinks of all the bodies he saw erupt.
“Uh, sorry, man.” Reed looks sheepish and awkward.
Jacey digs her fingers into her legs. “I’m sorry. I know it makes everything worse, but since your bond has mostly been cut off… his physiology is getting used to the bond in small doses, which is why he seems different than before.”
“My name is Doctor Stephen Strange, and this is Doctor Reed Richards.”

“Well,” she nods, “you did do that. But, you were trying to get me to leave, weren’t you? You pissed me off, and it did work. I guess I’m trying to say– thanks, Tony.”
"Missed me?" Barton sounds confused. "What, we didn't see each other often, or what?"
“Tony’s on bed rest,” She says softly, “but there’s trouble...”
from you guys! What the fuck? I can't smell
Tony sighs out and flicks through the TV channels to find something to watch. He still hasn't settled on what to watch when FRIDAY announces that he's got two visitors.
“No, Boss.”
He walks with his head bowed, watches the pavement move under his feet. He shoves his hands into his pockets and walks.
"Uh. No?"
oh, right! and if anyone knows if this is recced or got fan-art anywhere let me know so i can give them all some LOOOOOVVEEE! <3 (and link the rest of you to it mwahaha)
“No,” her eyes wide with fear and wonder, “it is much rarer. Stronger. Cofeted (coveted) by many cultures as being magic. It is truly special… but the punishment… the punishment for laying a hand against one’s uhane hoa is to never be allowed the chance to bond. It– how do you not know zis?”
there! Curse Steve and his goddamn super-sperm!
has given you the rundown already? So I came to hear whose side
Tony purses his lips and turns his head to look out the window. The plane is landing.
Tony shrugs. What can you do? "So what'd'ya guys got goin' on right now? Anything fun happen recently?"
The lava goes away and the doc asks, “The schematics, Stark.”
Strange looks at Tony in the rearview and his eyes tell Tony that he’s too perceptive. “You’ll probably run into your old team,” the surgeon murmurs.
” Steve murmurs with a haunted tone.
“Bucky’s pack. He’s… he’s my brother in everything but blood, and I couldn’t let Tony kill him.”
Tony holds back a sob. Once, he might have teased Steve. Once, he might have seduced him with a couple of breaths against sensitive flesh. Once, he might have smirked and flirted and talked dirty, filthy things that made Steve blush even brighter. Once, he might have chased that blush until Steve was easily coerced into doing… more fun things. Once. Not anymore. Maybe not ever again.
“Why?” Steve asks.
Steve sits and looks down at his hands. “I… I came to apologize.”
"No, of course not. Not that we had many, well, we had--one? But, no, that's suicidal. What kinda fuckin' idiot would make-- oh." Tony goes quiet.
“No,” the strange one says back, “we can’t.”
"My Steve was convinced that 'the safest hands are still our own'." Tony grits his teeth so hard he can feel bone grinding.
"So, you're telling me-- you're telling me that you're one of these Beings? What the fuck?" His eyes are wide and full of disbelief and denial.
I've found a reason for me
Goddammit the blond is stubborn.
P.S. i would like to inform you that Steve may seem OOC. this is because I am angry. and biased. sorry in advance. I'd say go and enjoy but you probably aren't.
be forced to deal with copious amounts of stress provided by the Secretary of State.”
The first time the incident happens, the team–what’s left of it–is training in the Wakandan forests. They’re chasing some kind of animal. Steve’s not sure what it is, exactly, but all of a sudden–out of
Ok, so he knew how. Obviously. Sex twice a day with four or five rounds each time for three months straight probably hadn't been the best move if Tony had been trying to
The contraction stops. Tony's chest heaves and tears roll down his face. "They're coming so fast," he whispers, "too fast. I-- I think the placenta--"
“We can’t leave him here,” the young one says.
A voice answers, “Well, that’s too bad. I’ll be sure to remember your complaints.”
Yeah. They call this the honeymoon phase for a reason. Tony’s never been this happy in his entire life, and even though things aren’t perfect… Well. For the first time, Tony’s optimistic about the future.
Why are relationships so messy? No, scratch that, why are
His phone, where is his fucking phone?! He needs to call somebody! Anybody! Shit!
“He was watching two eagles mate.” She snorts and just shakes her head, “It wasn’t until later that I found out he was watching it for his biology class. He was majoring in marine biology and minoring in environmental science, so I sure picked an interesting one.”
616!STEVE POV
I don’t think I can handle another minute here. I’m being serious.”
As soon as everyone else had left Fury sat in a chair and gestured for Steve to do the same.
“Yes. I’ve got…” She sighs and looks down at her patient, “I’m with Tony.”
"Well. It's a mad world, you know." His lips tilt upwards a bit.
“Cho is on her way up, Boss, she is currently laughing very hard in the elevator.”
Tony spins around and holds a hand to his chest, “Jesus, Natasha! Heart condition, remember?”
He shakes his head. “No. I’m. I’m
“Oh. Okay, if you’re sure. Could we speak privately?”
Tony is bored. No, okay, hear him out: he’s so bored that he’s considering watching this god-awful telenovela that somehow the cable box was a good preset. Not. Also, he’s still in the hospital and that is just not cool, okay? Tony Stark and hospitals are like fire and gasoline. They really, really don’t get along.
Barton freezes and then pales. "You're not
The surprise she feels when she suddenly feels someone behind her, however, is not.
“Yeah? What’d Evie want?”
Tony catches a sob in his throat and tries to focus on breathing. He’s asleep some minutes later.
He's going to have to make nice with Steve again, he just knows it. God dammit.
Rhodey grins. "Aw, buddy, you don't mean that. Wanna build a snowman?"
Tony shrugs, “I was bored.”
“Oh.” He’s killed it alright. Not destroyed it, but definitely maimed.
So much is different, and yet so much is depressingly similar.
. He couldn’t do that to himself. He wouldn’t. His self-preservation instincts may be practically non-existant, but he did have them.
“What? I’m just sayin’.” The archer shrugs and then looks to Scott who’s been staring at the dead gortle.
“Uh, could I get a name first? I mean––it’s just––I don’t usually put out on the first date without a name.” Stark makes a herculean attempt to not laugh at his own remark.
Present, 2016
Tony smiles weakly.
I'm awake."
“I don’t know everything that happened in Siberia, but I know that he hurt you,” she places her small, gentle hand on his chest and her eyes are filled with meaning, “and you can talk to me.”
“‘Cause we all know you’re a hot-head.”
Tony goes to look outside the window again. She’s helped with a lot of his problems, namely his PTSD and anxiety. He’s also managed to solve that irritating little quirk where he couldn’t stand being handed things. Tony hadn’t lied when he said Jacey used drugs as a last resort, but it just so happens that his PTSD was… incessantly stubborn. And, while therapy was giving him progress… his flashbacks and following panic attacks were relentless, so Jacey reluctantly passed over the prescription and told him that she would be switching the medication every two doses to prevent his immune system adapting to any one drug. Also she claimed it might help him not become so dependent on them as a sleep aid and antidepressant.
“Sure, Boss.”
“I’m not a kid. I’ve graduated high school.” Richards sniffed haughtily.
fourth: this chapter may seem slow, and I know I'm back-tracking (again ahah. what's a linear story progression? i've never heard of it ahhHAH), BUT ch 12 will speed everything up so fast some of you will prob get whiplash, add. ch 12 will also COVER ALL PLOT HOLES. it's going to be a long chapter... whew. REJOICE.
to. I'm sorry."
“So, the doctor suggested they do a surgery and turn him... more alpha. I don’t know the details, but it was successful. However… years later… when Gyeong tried to bond with a potential mate, he snapped. Everything to make deep bonding possible is absent in betas, but since he was born more beta than alpha, he didn’t have the necessary components, and it caused his body to be at war with itself. He went mad, Tony. He broke the fledgling bond with his girlfriend and tried to kill her.
The engineer purses his lips and picks at a non-existant thread of his leather couch. “Well, I… I didn’t tell you about it.”
I think you guys know by now that I have thing for cliffhangers. Really. I can't seem to help it. I'd apologize.... but that would be dishonest.
Steve freezes and nearly gets hit in the face with the bag when he whips his head around to gape at her.
"I know, it's hard to believe since I'm so ridiculously hard to kill, right?"
Psssst. Pssssst. Notice the new tags.
Stark blinks. "You
Sam holds his hands up. “No need to get fiesty, I’m just tellin’ it like it is.”
Tony closes his eyes and feels his heart ache deep in his chest.
In which Tony kinda helps the Avengers become a team again, solves their biggest problem-- All in a day's work. And maybe he figures out what Jacey sent him there for, too.
woke up here, in the past, that sunny afternoon just days before all their lives would change. He says how sorry he is again. Apologizes for losing faith in him and not trusting him like he should’ve. Apologizes for the things he’d said and the pain he’d caused Tony. He’s sorry that he wasn’t there when Osborne almost killed Tony and then when Tony had subsequently deleted his brain--after--how even more horrible he’d treated Tony. He’s sorry for all of it. All the way to the Skrull invasion, and beyond, to the Incursions. He should’ve known Tony was just doing the best he could with the options that they’d all given them. God. He’s sorry for turning almost everyone on the team against him. No, in fact, he
“Not just an omega, Dr. Richards, but a pregnant one.”
Tony turns and sure enough, it's Hawkeye himself.
“Yeah. In… the dungeon… the guy said something about an invasion. I–” Tony’s eyes widen as that whole conversation comes back to him with striking clarity. “No, not

Reed and Strange share a glance and then nod grimly.
“I know it won’t mean much from me, but for your part in it… for the mistakes you made… I forgive you, Tony. You don’t have to forgive
"Can't you just see it now, Jacey?"
“What? Tony Stark has PTSD?” Sam looks shocked.
deserves from him after all that Steve has done.
When the two men come back, looking as fresh as they can with their still world-weary faces, Tony knows they don't have good news. He turns off the TV and lets them talk their fill.
As the day passes, the rest of the Avengers gradually join the nest. Normally... normally Tony wouldn't allow them to see him in his most vulnerable state, but unfortunately his omega identifies them all as pack-mates. And... since he learned the news... well, Tony wants all the comfort he can possibly get even if the moment is fleeting. And, despite his better judgement, Tony loves these idiots. He knows they're not bad people, but he just... wishes that he didn't always get taken advantage of. They don't do that on purpose, either, he knows, but regardless-- it stings.
second: rejoice! next chapter will be prob next week, or possibly sooner (might give ya'll a nice lil new years gift ;) ...)
Helen sighs, “Depends.”
“Yeah,” she smiles, “I did.”
"Yeah, Tony. It was-- it's like I wasn't even there, it was all Hulk."
“Steve,” he chokes out instead, “what are you saying?”
at least
“Colonel Rhodes… Why are you calling me?” And not Tony, Steve thinks, “Has something happened?”
” Fury has never spoken to them in such a dangerous, murderous tone. Steve is shocked.
“Romanoff,” Fury’s voice is more even and less angry, “they would’ve arrrested you.”
“For a being to harm one’s u’hoa,” she says as if it’s obvious and he’s got rocks for brains, “is the greatest of all sins.”
“You– you are–”
Tony's jaw drops to the floor because
, and I want you to tell him why you think he is one. I want you to apologize for every wrong you’ve done or said, Steven Grant Rogers, or so help me I will not hesitate to maim you.
Wake up in the morning’ don’t know what happened
Tony sobs and can't stop until the pain finally eases into annoying throbs. "U-um. Th-that one was a little under a m-minute, I think, and my l-last one was... u-um. 8 minutes ago, m-maybe?"
! Who’ve you been sleeping with that you’re all sexually frustrated over?” Scott laughs.
“I’m not sure. I just… saw red?”
The man rolls his eyes and sighs. “You can call me Doctor, if you must. Now, first question: Extremis.”
I warned you.
“It’s okay, kid, Jacey is… well. She’s my shrink, I guess.” Tony sighs and rubs his face. “She honestly shouldn’t be working in a shitty office like that, under the employment of some manager; she should have her own business, frankly.”
“Yeah,” Jacey nods.
willing to listen to him spill his heart out.
… why had Tony kept the codes the same?
The AI recites dutifully when he’s reached the door.
“Yes. We have established this already. Do not make me angry, Mr. Stark, you will regret it.”
“From the fight. He got sick, and it got bad. You should be here.”
-- what a world.
- Ghost In This House, Alison Krauss and Union Station
"Mm, no," Tony purses his lips and shakes his head, "he looks more like a really buff movie actor/model than an actual... well, than an actual
; can read just how deep his regrets run.
"In two weeks time," her voice trembles and cracks into pieces like a mirror falling to the floor, "something bad is going to happen."
“Before… I lost my head,” Steve sighs, “I won’t give you any excuses, but I’m working on my… issues.” The supersoldier winces and goes back to staring into Tony’s soul. “I wanted to tell you that I shouldn’t have doubted you with the Accords. That I should have been more willing to reason and negotiate. I was bull-headed, and for that I’m sorry. I wanted to say that my poor choices weren’t a reflection on my or my co-conspirators opinions of you. Save Wanda, maybe, she’s– give her time. She’ll come around.
“I don’t know. No… that’s not right. Well, Ms. Maximoff, I’m sure you can think of a few less than stellar reasons why America’s Sweetheart wouldn’t want the Merchant of Death for a soulmate.” Tony gives a small, self-depreciating smile.
"No. Not since... well, it doesn't matter anymore. But, you hated me-- blamed me--and you were right to, you know. It was. My fault. I just, wanted to tell you that. Even if it's not... well, I guess, you?"
“What?” Rogers’ eyes go wide, “But that’s impossible! I haven’t bonded–”
“We have good news, though,” Jacey pipes up innocently.
Tony bites his lip. "Two weeks... two weeks
"I- I- can't! It wouldn't be proper! I... Tony must be the one to invite me." Steve relaxes though, but tries to gently pull away from the woman's strong embrace.
the beginnings of pneumothorax, but I think I can guess why.” She frowns and looks at him sadly.
“I fucked up.” He says simply.
Tony wipes his eyes, “And I just--” his gray-blue eyes seem to flicker and he hiccups, “I thought-- no, I
Tony must black out for a few seconds because when he blinks open his eyes again, his nerves are shot and he can’t feel much. He can’t smell either, and his vision is getting blurry with grey and the edges are black. He’s running out of time. Steve is saying something, but it’s sounds so far away…
He hangs up and grits his teeth. They have an Avenger to save.
“Captain America, everyone,” Tony shakes his head, “don’t go off and become Ghandi now.”
“Uh. No offense, Mr. Stark, but you’ve got puke all over you and I don’t think–”
“You’re not planning on going into space, are you?” Steve asks, but any potential concern vanishes when Tony shakes his head rapidly.
It’s an expert diversion, almost like she knows, which seems impossible but nothing ever really is where Natasha is concerned. He denies her the pleasure and waits, wondering if he can finally plant the apple trees he could never fit in his yard in D.C., and looks over once he realizes that he doesn’t even know how sustenance works in this world.
Here is what stays the same:
“I once came this close to sleeping with him, you know.”
“Don’t worry,” Tony is quick to say with a single sharp shake of his head. “You’d think I’d have learned by now, huh? Don’t touch Steve Rogers without his permission, never goes well - ”
Except - it’s not too late for them.
The funeral is still held in England, where he had known Peggy longed to rest long before she ever admitted it.
It could be cruel, but when Tony sets his eyes on Rogers’ baby blues, there’s no judgment to be seen.
“Get a room!” Rhodes says, voice raised.
“Oh.” Tony almost sounds bemused. “Is there something you need in order to finish?”
“Tell him the secret you wouldn’t let Peggy tell me.”
Steve gently takes it back, arranging it in its original spot with a brand of precision that is remarkable even for him.
“You can’t even remember,” Tony says, rueful in a way that Steve never would have dreamed him capable of. “You’re really going to tell me that you would’ve been okay with it when you were more blacked out than not, and the next chance I got, you turned me down flat-out?”
“It’s Steve,” he says, and it immediately feels unnecessary.
But Steve doesn’t want to hear it. He doesn’t want to know what Tony sees in him, is terrified to know what a literal superhero really thinks about someone so insignificant, so he turns his head just enough to nudge his nose up against Tony’s. He only means to get him to stop talking but it qualifies as permission, apparently, because then Tony’s surging up to kiss him full on the mouth and Steve loses himself to the tailspin for just a second.
“Employer-employee boundaries are very important, Steve,” Tony says, approaching the edge of the pool. “I absolutely encourage him to call me Mr. Stark.”
“Nothing is wrong,” Tony says, and he’d be giving in to the urge to run his fingers through his hair if it weren’t slicked through with pomade and likely to leave his hands coated in a fine waxy film. “What’s up?”
There’s a painful awareness of how tightly he’s got Tony’s fingers clenched in his, and with the cold only compounding the issue, Steve makes himself release his hold while focusing on Tony’s hovering face. Concern lurks just underneath the quirk of a well-practiced humored expression, eyes alert and ready to take notice of any sudden movements, and Steve moves especially slow.
“If your chest hair catches fire, I’m not putting it out.”
“Right,” he assures her. “Just like you call me Steve.”
He watches as Steve chews on his bottom lip, Adam’s apple bobbing as he readies himself.
Steve feels paralyzed, bolted to the concrete as he watches Tony slide along the black leather bench seat until he’s out of the car and drawing himself upwards with a single-minded focus. Some warped sense of tunnel vision sets in, one where Steve can feel the loaded gun pressed to the small of his back, threatening him with flashbacks to that February night years before. He watches Tony join their little quartet, and in the back of his head Steve knows that they’re at high risk of garnering nosy bystanders, but no one else seems bothered by the possibility as Tony pulls the trigger on a wide grin that absolutely transforms his face, beginning with half-moon wrinkled eyes and continuing on past the moment Steve realizes he’s
“ - thought it was only right that I give you a real chance at what you came here to get,” Tony finishes, talking over Steve like he hasn’t heard him, only Steve knows he did. “So come on, hit me. Any questions you want, and then we can declare things off the record so you can finally partake of some of this basically overpriced sparkling grape juice and I can go back to harassing personal information out of you.”
There’s a miraculous change of clothes to save them from the unpleasant experience of trying to tug smoke-soaked fabric over damp skin and soaked underwear in the middle of the thin desert climate. Steve wants to stop and ask questions about who took the time to retrieve his things from his room, but it’s not worth it, not when this is clearly how things work when Tony Stark is involved, as simple as that. Besides, it's not like he needs to know for the article.
“JARVIS can help,” he offers. “In the kitchen. Or you can order in, whatever you like. You see how Natasha abuses the city’s delivery boys and the team credit card.”
“I don’t know, the tens of nominees around us?” Christine says, mouth quirking. “The countless A-list celebrities we’re here to report on?”
It’s a crash course then, bruising kisses across every stitch of exposed skin and hurried touches exploring as thoroughly as they can in their desperation. Steve feels stripped down to his core, Tony’s mouth hot and leaving delicious burns down his abdomen until he can flip them and return the favor. Tony grunts when Steve pins him down, heavy hands on bucking hips while he sucks kisses into solid thighs. There’s a hand in his hair and Steve is ready to oblige, but then he’s being pulled up,
“You concentrate,” Tony says with a shrug. “Might take a few tries to stick. Your brain has to get used to it - you have to convince yourself that it’s part of the structure. I was a little skeptical coming in, not going to lie, that’s why I took a while to settle down. Saw some cool things while I was losing my shit, but before I came along Natasha was basically camping out in a hammock, so she can thank me for teaching her everything she knows.”
“ - Stark continues to respond with canned statements, despite rumors that he’s been meeting with government officials regarding the matter,” one of the news anchors says, and Steve wonders if this isn’t a little heavy for a Saturday morning. “One has to wonder if he’s really as well-intentioned as he pretends to be, when he continues to evade - ”
“You ready to get outta here?” Steve knows how it sounds, but can’t bring himself to regret it, not when Tony wets his lips with a sliver of pink tongue.
Carol looks entirely unconcerned as she finishes her drink, and gets up to pour another.
Sam hums. “She seems…”
The sun sets violet and indigo and buttercup yellow-orange as they drive back to the house, and Steve just about presses his face to the window to watch. He took plenty of pictures before they got in the car, after they found a parking lot with food trucks and Morgan gorged herself on chili cheese fries.
Steve gropes blindly, feeling cool wool and there’s a distressed noise that might come from him, but maybe it doesn’t. He needs to not be like this, to not always be hopelessly in love with a man with a personality too big for the entire universe, talented and selfless and unaware of how phenomenal he is. Steve needs for Tony to know -
“Together,” Steve says, feeling so choked up and miserable that he barely gets the word out.
Next, he relays what led to the decimation, and Tony grasps his glass and tries to understand the intricacies, but Steve forges on. He tells Tony how they lost, how Carol Danvers had needed to retrieve him from another galaxy, and keeps it together.
they had some chemistry going on. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“His Tony had a daughter,” Tony says, and he’s not quite unraveling but his heart aches because it’s so painfully human to love someone you will never be able to have. “They never - ”
“I thought things were okay,” Tony says, and Steve hates how he can hear the hint of desperation there. He hates when Tony gets like this: so generous, so eager to please even when it’s to his detriment.
Sam is the one who hangs back.
“It is,” Steve says. “Doesn’t mean I didn’t try to listen to you the first time around.”
He glances around, knowing that if Steve wants to eavesdrop, no walls around here will stop him. That being said, the man does possess an iota of tact, so Tony ventures back out to the front porch while knowing that it’s enough of a gesture to guarantee that Steve will grant him privacy and tune him out completely.
“You’ve got some low standards then,” Tony tells him.
“Steve,” Tony says, and it’s so uncharacteristically gentle that his intent - or lack thereof - couldn’t be clearer.
“Hm.” Beth pushes her feet flat on the glass. “If you won’t be there, can we take the pull-out?”
“Wasn’t going to,” Sam assures him, draining his mug and getting to his feet. “I’d stick around to watch you brood the day away, but I promised my nephews I’d show up at their games, so - ”
“Excuse you,” Pepper says, rolling her eyes and sharing the aforementioned anticipated smile with Steve as she steps forward towards the car. “Where are your manners?”
“Don’t knock the cosmos,” Steve mumbles disapprovingly, tugging at the hem of Tony’s t-shirt. “I promised him.”
“Okay,” Steve says, and he goes to pick up the patch that he’s cut to size, but Bonnie is saying his name so he stops.
He's pretty sure he's done exactly that.)
“Do you know why I said no before? When you tried to show off the suit?” He keeps it all tightly reined in, the fire and ice in his veins all at once, signaling an end that he’s decided to run into.
Tony leads him around the front of the house. There’s a long pathway carved into the landscape that slopes down until it turns into wooden steps that spill out onto the messy shore of a lake. It’s big and glassy, reflecting the stars and the moon, and Tony bends down to roll up the legs of his pants.
“We can try again,” he offers indulgently.
Steve looks at Tony, hoping that he can adequately convey how much gratitude he holds towards him.
When it’s just him and Peggy in bed that night, he feels oddly at peace in a way he never has before.
Steve isn’t sure that they do any good by being there.
“It’s just a lot,” he explains, and Tony nods along. “We order the rolls at the Tower, but it’s different.”
Used to the passing of time, the sun slowly climbs in the sky. Natasha and Tony chat idly, flitting between topics pertaining to their day-to-day, and Steve is happy to close his eyes and enjoy the way the sun warms his ankles. He doesn’t tune back in until Nat prods at the meat of his shoulder, and he slowly blinks as she talks at him.
“I hope you’re ready to learn,” Sam says, finally migrating to the table.
“I like my bed,” Tony says, huffing some more. “I’m not changing it.”
“Ana was in the hospital,” Tony says, recognition flaring behind enormous red-rimmed irises. “When she was still alive. You and Peggy - you stayed with me until my mom got here.”
“I’m sorry,” he says, and Tony looks up in surprise. “I shouldn’t have acted like that.”
“I hate those HYDRA bastards,” Tony says, unable to keep from scowling as he yanks his shirt down.
“We’re thinking that not everyone ends up here,” Tony says. “There has to be a certain...suspension of disbelief to exist here. Nat didn’t say as much, but I get the feeling that there are people she’s tried to find.”
“Do you ever want to talk about them?” she asks.
One, is that Tony isn’t entirely sold on retirement. He’s embraced the idea enough to want it announced publicly, but references a future Iron Man in ways that indicate he hasn’t completely disconnected himself from the identity yet. When Steve had asked if he’d consider taking up the mantle again in the future, he had given a hilariously shrug-like gesture and started up with some excuse about why he had to start the engine repairs at the Tower, as opposed to the compound.
Strong hands and surprising muscle, every inch of him as capable as the last and all exceeding expectations. Steve had watched him in silence for years, unaware of himself as he kept unnecessarily close tabs on exactly where Tony was oriented whenever possible. There wasn’t a room they didn’t simultaneously occupy without Steve’s immediate awareness of how Tony was positioned, whether he looked tired or over-caffeinated, attempting to decode body language the way one soaks up a new language in a new country.
“Not in front of the kids,” Clint says, exaggeratedly putting a hand over his eyes, and Steve just leans over to watch where Carol has somehow found a captive audience in the oldest two without managing to scare them away from the compound permanently.
“You understand why I couldn’t,” Steve says, and it’s as good as a yes.
“You can ask me whatever you like right now,” Tony offers eventually. “This is a secure line, so there’s no need to worry about - ”
“I'm calling an Uber,” Tony says, trying to keep the labored panting out of his voice, thankful that Steve is steadfastly looking forward and can’t see him struggling. “I've been scammed. Hoodwinked. Bamboozled. As soon as I'm done killing you, I'm suing you, and I can't think of a jury in the world who would put me in jail for throwing you in the Potomac. Although that’s a little more your style, isn’t it?”
“I’m torn between wanting to ask if you were ever in that sort of a situation as a teenager, because I’m really doubting it, and slamming you up against the door until you’re begging me to stop.” It’s so matter of fact, his voice inhumanly level; meanwhile Tony bites down hard on the inside of his cheek to keep from letting out a moan at the mere prospect.
“I know,” Tony says, looking like he’s grieving Parker’s loss all over again. “I know. It just makes you think.”
“I’d think a guy like you would be more experienced when it came to doing what you want,” Tony said, elbowing him. "And not caring about what others expect."
The traitorous voice pipes up again to inform Steve that they kind of
The office is all out of the fancy caramel-flavored pods he likes for the Nespresso machine, so he steals a can of sparkling water out of the fridge. He pops the tab and nearly rips a nail in the process, and it’s flavored grapefruit in a way that makes him wish he’d just grabbed an Evian, but he leans against the granite kitchenette counter and takes short, fizzy sips until his head feels clear. On the way back to his desk, he steals a pathetic looking pack of unsalted almonds from the snack bar before settling in, determined to finish so he can head home for the day and pray he gets mugged on the subway and doesn’t have to lug the giant box in through his apartment door.
“We can wait for you here,” Steve tells Peggy. “I don’t mind.”
Steve would do a lot of things for a decent mattress and daily Starbucks runs, but selling out isn’t one of them.
(What he doesn’t voice is the recollection that Tony had said Rhodes liked Steve. It’s not pertinent, no matter how it boosts Steve’s ego.)
“So then the shield - ”
Tony sniffs in exaggerated disdain, Steve’s easy nonchalance bringing out his desire to stomp all over his own feelings and cover them up with his signature billionaire flair. “Yeah, I guess I can mingle with the bourgeoisie for a hot minute.”
would never let anyone drive a wedge between them.
Fury comes in the early morning when Steve likes to putter around the garden. He’s expanded into vegetables now, and he’s promised Peggy a bountiful harvest. Once he’s done watering the squash, he joins the dark figure on the porch.
“You always want to take things apart,” Steve says, and then he’s scratching at the back of Tony’s neck, fingers dry against barely muggy skin. It feels better than it should, and Tony holds perfectly still, unwilling to sway forwards or backwards and risk the fragility of this moment.
“What?” Tony says, a beat too late to be considered normal, but Steve doesn’t seem to notice as his mouth does that thing again, the one that gets Tony nearly every goddamn time.
Never once does Tony’s breathing return to that uneven alertness, and Steve just about drowns in the privilege of it all.
When he settles into bed for the night after helping Peggy with her nightly routine, she strokes the back of his hand. It’s not as certain as it used to be, but has the same effect as always.
For seconds, hours, minutes - he just lies there. His head feels empty for the first time since he’d laid eyes on Tony earlier in the night, and the whooshing in his ears lulls him into fuzzy unfeeling until he’s forced to pull his face from the mattress so he can breathe.
Tony goes alarmingly quiet after that, and Steve isn’t sure what he said wrong.
Once the sun is up, enormous and buttery, both mundane and inspiring at the same time, Steve kisses Tony’s hairline, right below the crown he’s still wearing.
“ - You have to tell him,” Steve finishes. “If you are even half the man I was in my universe, you will know. You will not want to, but it will be the most important thing you do.”
“That was the
When they get back to the house, he sends Beth inside and reaches for his phone.
Eventually, after a useless twenty minutes of determining that Tony’s paranoia - sorry,
“Should I be worried about being a homewrecker?”
He’s been working his way through the information that Bonnie compiles, scouring the Internet for anyone in the area who could be looking for one of their kids. It’s not particularly difficult work, but it wears on him as he reaches out and is disappointed more often than not.
“You gonna write about this too?” Tony jokes, as unguarded as he’s been all night.
Not without the rest of them.
He just looks at her helplessly.
“Okay,” he reassures her, and any hidden tension in her features dissipates. “I won’t. Just tell me what to do.”
“Put it on my tab,” Sam responds, eyes glued to some news channel reporting on absolutely nothing of immediate importance. Steve walks to stand in the draft the still-open window is letting in, knowing he should shut it and stop burning money to heat the outdoors, but the balance of hot and cold distracts him from how the news anchors announce a change in topic when they come back from the break.
“Nat,” he says past the lump in his throat. “I can’t, this isn’t - ”
Tony’s hand is warm and dry as it curls into Steve’s, and Steve gets approximately a microsecond to register that before Tony is stepping in, invading any kind of standard personal bubble in order to clasp his left arm around Steve’s shoulders. Except it’s more of a wrap than a clasp, given how close they suddenly are - Steve can see the product-ridden strands of Tony’s hair, a shade or two lighter than the stark almost-black it had been last time, and he can smell it too, something clean and salon-like that’s gotta cost a million bucks an ounce - and Tony has to lean up to reach, a hint of muscle lurking underneath his suit jacket sleeves if Steve remembers correctly. At least, Steve assumes those corded biceps are still there, judging by the strength with which Tony pulls him down an inch or two, leaving no room for argument.
Tony leans forward in the oversized chair, an elbow hitching forward to land on the edge of Steve’s desk. He fumbles embarrassingly but recovers quickly by shooting out a hand to grab at the simple black picture frame in the far corner.
“I’m sorry about Pepper,” Steve says, before Tony can open his mouth again.
“Really?” Steve deadpans. “You’re passing up a golden opportunity here?”
Iron Man. I know you’ve never - ”
Perhaps it can be that simple.)
By the time the house is quiet (the driving rotation means that normally Denise would drive the high school kids, but Tony’s unknowingly thrown a wrench in those plans so she packs up the girls and begrudgingly allows the middle schoolers to squeeze in as well, since they start later), he realizes that he’s not sure whether Tony plans on coming back or not.
Steve runs a thumb along a chip in the white ceramic, rough unpolished texture catching along the edge of a barely-noticeable hangnail. “I don’t know,” he finds himself saying.
Steve glances up, then centers his eyes on the flurry-frosted lawn and rippling slate-tinged lake before him.
It takes a second for the words to register, because Tony really had been expecting something he wouldn’t want to hear. He has to parse through the pronouns for a second, a task that hasn’t gotten any easier as time has gone by. It’s not bad, he doesn’t think, but he clarifies.
“That’s really how you’re ending it?” Clint demands.
Perhaps a draft is to blame, but Steve feels a ripple of goosebumps at the nape of his neck as he gets his feet underneath him.
“But still,” Steve says, trying to figure out why Tony seems so unbothered by divorcing the only person he’d been in a relationship with since before Steve knew him. “There’s a lot of history there.”
When Tony speaks, his voice cracks. “You think I didn’t need you?”
“There’s got to be something,” Tony insists. “Do they need a bigger place? I can find an abandoned McMansion down there, they can each have their own bedroom and en-suite. Tennis courts, a pool, the whole shebang. How many are there?”
in fancy red lettering, and not for the first time since arriving, Steve marvels at the clear home that had been built in this Tower. “There was this whole lead-up, I had to send the murder twins to South Korea and pray they held up their end of the American Express bargain, and Banner used some kind of alien stone - ”
Steve doesn’t care if he’s being rude. He’s never cared very much about what others think about him (present company excluded, he thinks grimly), but in the last few years, it’s gotten worse. He knows he borders on disrespectful half the time, any semblance of politeness thrown out the window as soon as there’s half a reason to do so. Realistically speaking, if he wasn’t better at his job than just about everyone else now that Christine’s left, he’d’ve been forced to learn how to rein it in a long time ago. As it is, Steve knows what he shouldn’t have to tolerate, and this, right here in front of him, is one big giant reason to flash the middle finger.
“Water’s fine,” Steve says, and Tony gives a short nod before taking his time with the coffee machine, some overpriced contraption that grinds the beans and noisily spits out Tony’s espresso. Steve doesn’t stare, ears straining involuntarily while his eyes fastidiously take stock of where Tony might sit and how to best position his phone to record the interview. There’s a chess set on the coffee table, which is more amusing than it should be, if only because he can’t see the Avengers sitting down and taking the time to play board games.
He gets that, because Tony is flushed around the neck, hardly noticeable to anyone except for Steve who’s looking closely at every visible bit of skin. The hand on his leg has progressively gotten higher and higher, edging into the kind of territory Steve isn’t sure he can come back from, and the firm press of Tony’s fingers isn’t helping at all. No one else can see, not unless Carol or Wanda really can see through solid surfaces, but it feels vaguely possessive and there’s an appeal there that makes blood rush in Steve’s ears.
I swear I meant to update consistently, but then got slammed by a winter storm and didn't have power for a while. Barring any more natural disasters, I do plan on continuing to post every few days. That being said, thank you to everyone who takes the time to engage with this - all of it is greatly appreciated.
wrinkles beginning to set in her kind face. He doesn’t think he deserves it, but he pulls on his leather jacket and heads outsides into the thick, oppressive Atlantic humidity.
“So what have you decided?” Natasha asks as they make their way down the hall.
For as every bit of charming the man can be, Steve decides, he is also just as odd.
“I know I always will be like him,” Steve says, and he’s running a thumb along his jaw, looking speculative. “But you hit the nail on the head: I’ve had different experiences, and we’re not the exact same. We’re made of the same stuff, but it’s different. I don’t want to end up like him.”
Tony’s lips curve into a smile.
- prevents Steve from entering any of the interesting areas in the compound, he finds himself standing in the middle of what looks like a common living area. There’s an odd assortment of chaises and armchairs that appear to never have been used, and a large kitchen with gleaming counters and appliances. Steve wonders if anyone actually lives here or if it’s merely for show, considering that it’s all expensive, very tasteful, and yet regrettably uninhabited.
Tony links their fingers together, and gradually their tendons and ligaments relax until their joined hands rest easy.
“Is this where you want to be?” Tony asks, searching for verification as he holds Steve’s chin firm between his thumb and forefinger. “You’re not just here because Natasha is sleeping, or because you’re scared or lonely, or because you’re trying to lock me down while we’re both unattached?”
“That’s what I thought,” he says with a sort of certainty to it, and he grins, and for a moment it’s like looking into a mirror despite the fact that Rogers is many many years younger than him. He stands up then, holding out a hand. “Come on. Tell us the rest.”
“Yeah,” Steve nods. “I know I left a lot of people behind. But I think I needed a new perspective. Something to help me remember how much - to help me remember that it’s okay to love the people who mean a lot to me, even after everything we’ve been through.”
“Just the one,” Tony says, and he’s charming and Bonnie is trapped in his orbit as he shakes Josie’s hand. “Tony Stark.”
It’s observant, quick syllables sharp on a silver tongue that Steve knows very well. He doesn’t have to look to know who it is but wrenches his eyes open immediately anyway.
“You will need him,” Steve says. “And he will need you. And if you do not tell him, you will not be there when the world needs the Avengers.”
He feels lighter.
“I wasn’t hiding it,” he points out, and Tony cradles the frame carefully, not wanting to leave smudges on the picture that had clearly earned a place of honor amongst Steve’s minimalist decorating style. “You can look all you want.”
“About…?”
Out of the corner of his field of vision, he sees a glint of auburn-gold. It’s beautiful, but wrong. Distorted.
Tony takes a minute to calm down and finish grumbling before letting Steve continue.
"I think that's up to us, too. We get to appear exactly as we see ourselves. Complicated, I know." Tony tugs at his neckline, just enough to reveal that his skin is smooth and unscarred in a way that Steve instinctively knows it had never been during the years they'd known each other. "Took me a while to sort out this mess," Tony indicates before letting go and covering up.
“Yeah,” Steve says, chin dipping in a nod. “I...I don’t think we’ll ever really know what happened in his timeline,” he admits, and Tony’s heart clenches at the accuracy and sorrow of the sentiment. “He never said as much, but Peggy did, once, and he didn’t deny it when I asked.”
On the way out of the office, Steve sticks out a foot that Tony narrowly avoids tripping over.
“Not what I meant,” Tony says once he’s drained his water bottle and tossed it on a side table amongst at least a half dozen abandoned drinks. He plants his feet, looking side to side in an impression of someone gaining their bearings. “Is there a service entrance around here?”
cupping, leaning in with bated breath and so utterly focused on forging ahead and doing what he’s always wanted to do -
“Do you miss being with all your superhero friends?”
“So how’d we do?”
Steve rests his hands on his thighs and misses Peggy’s hand in his, weighing his words carefully.
He just waits there with the dumb smirk on his face, the one Tony is constantly torn between wanting to kiss or punch. Tony crosses his arms against his chest, then uncrosses them, letting out a brief huff.
Steve prays Tony doesn’t notice, and decidedly doesn’t watch as Tony lingers before joining his girlfriend in the car.
“Just a moment,” he mutters to Tony, who nods and sits, immediately politely directing his attention elsewhere.
“I’m sure what you’ve got is impressive,” he says diplomatically, and when Tony pouts and reveals a weapon that looks suspiciously like a gun but he claims isn’t one, he makes sure to ask lots of questions and act very engaged.
When he comes to a second time, it happens quicker than before.
“Great,” Steve snaps into the phone. “Enjoy the rest of your day.”
That’s definitely a blush, Steve thinks in satisfaction.
“Now, you listen here,” Pierce says, shaking a finger in Steve’s direction. “As part of your employment contract, any interview and subsequent information obtained during your tenure is the intellectual property of - ”
“Tony says he’s coming back,” Rogers says, and Steve believes it. “Says he’s got some loose ends to tie up.”
“Is that what you tell Josie?” Steve asks, and Denise flips him a middle finger before disappearing to her room.
“So this is…”
“Lucky you,” Rhodes agrees before frowning at Tony, who’s currently shredding the petals of the peonies in the centerpiece. “Okay, seriously? I don’t care how much you hate these people, but if we don’t at least pretend to make nice with some of - ”
He adjusts his cap, shoves the paper in the duffel he hadn’t wanted to leave on his bike, and thinks about the dwindling bills in his wallet.
“I’m sorry,” he forces out. “That was - ”
He cannot risk this. There is more than his life at stake this time. The years have made him soft and weak, and on the day he leaves the picket-fenced one-story for the last time, he does so with a plastic bag full of damp paper towels and cosmos seeds. Tony answers Steve’s call and arranges it all with his usual aplomb, and when Steve steps out onto the lawn of the compound, a wave of nostalgia hits so strong it nearly knocks him to his knees.
When Josie looks at him, after she’s hung up the phone, she just shakes her head.
“Why didn’t you?”
“What are you even asking?” He knows he sounds exasperated, but it’s the best he can do right now. After all, he does like being able to afford the good meat from the butcher around the corner and the well-fitting suits he’d finally given into upon his promotion. It’s smoke and mirrors mostly, a glass-walled office that he despises and often shirks in favor of hanging out at the cubicles with the junior writers, but it helps to look the part. All his old ones had started to wear at the seams after so many years, anyway.
They gather supplies and Tony says he knows a place. It’s further up the coast, and Morgan falls asleep in the car, adorable with her mouth open and head bent at an unnatural angle. Steve has to resist the urge to wake her up, Tony shooting him a glance and shaking his head warningly.
He gets the impression that it's a question Tony hadn't anticipated, but he answers smoothly enough.
For a while, Steve loses track of time. He barely remembers to glance at the road signs, but when he realizes he’s in Arkansas, he pauses.
“There’s too much,” he says, and it overwhelms him. “Too much I want to do.”
; but there aren’t any.
He lifts a single eyebrow in her direction. “You want a refresher on how invasively inappropriate that would be?”
“It’s not that,” Steve says, a sense of familiarity fighting to curl up in the base of his belly like a dog curling up for a nap. After trying to kiss Tony (Christ, what the hell had he been
“I’m not going to apologize,” Tony says, his sunglasses hiding anything that could give anything away. “Because you’ve been a real moron, and I meant what I said.”
“I’m pulling rank here,” Steve says, plucking the donut out of the box and taking a large bite. It’s just faintly warm still and Steve doesn’t have to think on it for more than a second to know that the donuts are Tony’s doing, just chewing fluffy-yeasty pastry and taking a moment to savor the rich chocolate on his tongue.
“And then after?” Tony says, more to prolong the conversation than anything, unwilling to call it a night when Steve looks so vulnerable and bares his soul in a way that Tony is fairly sure only he is privy to. It’s the benefit of working together so closely like this, being thrust together and knowing that they have to make it work if they want to live.
Tony just faces him, closely observing.
“What did you think of the avocado toast?” Tony asks, shifting a plate bearing the remains of latkes, applesauce and sour cream smeared across the ceramic. That had been a hit, he recalls.
“You’re not really on the clock anymore,” Tony says, doing a fantastic impression of sobriety as he licks his lips spit-shiny and stares intently at the side of Steve’s face. Steve only knows because he’s looking right back, trying not to and failing miserably. “So if that’s the only issue - ”
Steve slides in after what he considers an appropriate amount of hesitance, thanking the driver and offering up his hotel location as the door shuts after him. “Joe?”
“Before Tony,” she clarifies, and then looks at him sideways as they pick their way to the very edge of the large clearing he’d appeared in. “To be fair, we really weren’t expecting you anytime soon. You’re going to have to tell us what happened at some point, you know, otherwise he’s just going to keep coming up with worst-case scenarios.”
He learns that they’ve been through five different coffee makers in the last month alone because Bucky can’t figure out how to work them and inadvertently ends up smashing them to bits in his frustration. Dr. Cho and Bruce come by at least once a month to consult on whatever they’re needed for, and Thor has contacted them to announce that he plans on visiting on the anniversary of the battle.
Malibu. What the hell is he doing in Malibu? His flight out of Vegas is no longer of any use to him, and he weighs exactly how pissed his editor will be if he tries to pitch a last-minute flight out of LAX as a work expense as his eyes rove over what looks to be a guest room.
“Not a vegetarian,” Rogers says, turning around to press his rigid spine against the edge of the bar, observing the room in front of him. “But I’m usually much better when it comes to trying new things.”
“Can’t a guy just call to chat?”
but he doesn’t have another name for it at the ready, and he doesn’t know how to proceed. This was certainly the last thing he expected upon rolling out of bed this morning, but now it’s happened, and he has to deal with it.
“Wipe your mouth,” Steve orders. “I think you’re done drinking, and I’m pretty sure your body agrees with me.”
Steve thinks of the slip of paper in his toiletry bag that he can visualize clear as day, and stares at the phone hung on the wall. He can hear Denise upstairs, firmly telling Jackson that it’s time for bed, and Bonnie and Crystal are fighting over who gets the next turn in the girls’ bathroom. It’s a pleasant sort of cacophony, familiar and comforting.
, Steve thinks furiously, with no clue how he’s found himself in this situation again - winking in Steve’s direction.
Tony slides the hangers off the rod, one at a time. “You’re absolutely right, for once. I should just get both. Hey, what are the chances we make it out of here for less than a buck fifty?”
“I meant what I said,” Steve says, and he feels desperate for a second, but then he just feels bold. “About everything always being up to you.”
Rogers looks at the menu but doesn’t order when a waitress comes by, so Tony shoots her a charming smile and asks for the coffee pot and two waters.
“The beef sliders,” he says, eventually, as he sees a paunchy man with an oversized gold watch and sparkling cufflinks beelining for them. “Like little burgers. You’re lucky they opted out of the blue cheese this time.”
“Do I know you?” Rhodes asks as their hands release.
He thinks he’d be just as happy to watch Tony for the rest of their shared afterlife as he would be to have him.
“Then what can you tell me?” Tony asks, always curious, needing to know everything.
, and Steve unhooks his thumb to open the microwave before it can beep again.
Tony’s breath catches in his throat, but he speaks around the sudden thicket of emotion anyway.
Steve reaches for his work ID badge because it’s more accessible than his wallet, lets the guy do whatever verification he’s supposed to, and avoids Christine’s watchful eye. He signs with the miniature stylus where he’s directed to, and then the courier is scurrying back towards the hall that leads to the elevator bank.
Things change. People change, and they see Howard less often as he gets involved with new ventures that Steve and Peggy don’t quite approve of. He plays the role of doting husband as well as he has been, unofficially helping Peggy wherever she’ll allow, and they keep each other going.
Pepper Potts’ mouth goes thin before twisting into what looks like foreshadowing to a genuine smile.
Despite having wrapped up with Peter, Tony’s predictably still sequestered in his workshop. He’s wearing safety glasses, which is new for him, and Steve takes his time poking around the benches. There’s an entire section of the large room dedicated to Iron Man developments, and Steve smiles to himself as he picks up a panel that looks like it belongs to the left arm.
It happens before he can process it, Steve picking him up and following through on that threat of his.
“Yeah, right,” he says, rocking back on the rear legs of his chair. “Like he ever-so-helpfully reminded me, I couldn’t even get my relationship to work out.”
“Don’t go,” he tries to say, but it’s like trying to cup water between his own two bare hands. “I’m not done with you yet.”
“But don’t you ever want to be there too?”
Over a bottle of single-malt scotch, he talks Tony through it, from beginning to nearly the end.
“What did he tell you?” Steve asks.
A muted crash sounds back from inside his apartment, reverberating against the thick glass windows. It’s loud enough to have him turning quickly, nearly knocking the phone four stories down, but he saves it at the last split-second and squints into the dim light of his living room to see nothing more than a body being thrown onto the couch, feet kicking up on a sturdy wooden table. The source of the noise, he quickly concludes, is the television remote that’s been thrown back onto the catchall tray in the center of the table.
“Which one?” Tony asks, and Steve leans in close.
Thanks to everyone who took the time to let me know how they feel about chapter length! I appreciate the feedback, and you guys overwhelmingly advocated for longer chapters, so that's what you'll be getting.
“So it’s not….”
Tony cuts himself off, lashes fluttering closed before snapping open. He looks almost scared, and Steve rubs a thumb over his cheekbone.
He thinks about that as he tries to sleep that night, tossing and turning on the pull-out couch.
He pulls a few extra hot wings onto his plate during game days, and they both know they’re Steve’s for the taking so he doesn’t wind up feeling guilty for claiming too many.
“But aren’t I?”
Tony Stark, though, is neither yet another actor knocking on the door of irrelevance, nor a former girl-grouper desperate for next-level notoriety. He’s seen through Steve before, or at least given off the impression that he did, and Steve should’ve been prepared for him, and yet he’s definitely not, judging by how he fumbles for words.
Steve glances over to see her rolling her eyes.
Wanda picks him up because the flight lands early and Tony is delayed in the city doing something with Peter. Bucky and Sam are rushing a recon mission to get back for the holiday weekend, and Rhodes won’t leave the compound while Carol has stopped in for a visit.
“Actually, I’d love to forget the time with the force field,” Tony counters, and he flips off the cap to find that it’s ready for use, squirting out just barely enough to gauge the viscosity. “You’re telling me that you brought me here not only to tell me Benjamin Button’s deepest darkest secret and confess your undying love for me, but also to consummate what I presume is supposed to be the start of a long and healthy union?”
“Why not?”
Steve had forced her out of the car, holding her tight and making her promise to be careful and come back in one piece.
“I stand by it,” Tony says, hands fluttering as he searches his person for something to fiddle with and comes up empty. They’ve dressed casually for this, in simple t-shirts and jeans, and he misses his armor of cufflinks and lapels and ties to adjust. All he’s got is his phone and the car keys, but those would make him appear plain rude. “Maybe there’s a part of you that sees him, whatever the hell he’d gone through, but I can’t. I felt for him, I hope he’s happy with whatever he ended up doing over there, but what makes a guy just fucking - ”
“I didn’t even tell you it was making funny noises,” Pepper protests.
“This, coming from the guy who can barely be bothered to get his own coffee when Rogers is around,” Rhodes says as he passes, and Tony wastes no time in scowling after him.
He starts to look a little sick as Steve talks, and Steve gets it. It’s got to hurt, knowing what the alternative could have been, except that isn’t exactly true.
He’s nearly fifteen minutes late to work, but can’t bring himself to feel guilty about it.
“Is that so?”
“He’ll keep it,” Tony says, shooting Rogers a look as if daring him to argue, and Rogers just nods again.
“If you don’t start a new one - ” Tony starts, trying to steal Bucky’s as he passes by on his way to the table.
“That’s sweet,” he tells Steve, meaning it.
“Well,” Sam says, clapping him on the shoulder. “You’ll always have a room with us.”
“Sorry,” Steve says again, and there’s a clearing of a throat on the phone.
“So what now?” Tony asks.
“Do you ever shut up?” Sam says rhetorically.
There’s nowhere else Steve wants to be. Nothing else he’d want to do.
He freezes, realization blanching.
“Was I selfish?” he gasps out, and he’s already been kneeling at the side of their bed, but he feels like he’s collapsing into the ground. “Coming back to you?"
Steve does, but only after he’s shimmied out of his boxers, and that nearly distracts Tony entirely.
When Hank leaves to be with a girl he met in the city, Steve is the oldest one in the house.
“Well then you’re doing an awfully good impression of someone who’s terrified that his supervisor is going to find out that you tried to put the moves on your interviewee,” Tony says, and then he’s got his fingertips all up in Steve’s business. Steve looks down at him reproachfully, but Tony just innocently shrugs and keeps at it, stroking and petting with varying levels of pressure. “This is new - relatively speaking, of course. For all I know, you could’ve dyed your hair eighteen different colors since I saw you last, then buzzed it all off before growing it out. But I bet you didn’t, I bet you just got lazy, didn’t you?”
“It’s not funny,” he protests as Tony laughs. “She’s sixteen, Tony!”
“I don’t know any more about this than you do,” he tells her, bending down to scoop up his pen and tuck it behind his ear once more.
They all exchange goodbyes, and the short drive to Tony’s feels weighted. Morgan’s music still plays, and Steve doesn’t know why Tony doesn’t change it but hums along anyway. When they pull up to the house and come to a stop, he’s aware of Tony looking at him.
“Yeah,” Tony says softly. “That. Do you?”
When Steve lies down that night, his head is full of thoughts about how much he’s missed.
Josie forces him to buy things for himself, saying his clothes are wearing at the seams and making him look like a hobo. She sends Elliot with him, and Zeke and Manny want to tag along with their pocket change, and they stop in the mall food court before they head back. Steve buys them each a giant cinnamon roll and it’s the closest he’s felt to normal since before Siberia.
Tony makes an indignant noise in the back of his throat.
She perks up once they arrive, and it’s true that on a Tuesday afternoon the beach is mostly empty. There are a few surfers and a particularly handsy couple that Tony snorts at as he watches Steve set up towels and chairs and an umbrella. He wants to ask why Tony’s got all this stuff on hand, but then Steve watches Tony slide a pair of water wings on Morgan’s upper arms and he doesn’t need to.
“No,” is all Tony gets, and he presses his lips against whatever patch of skin is available directly below them.
He’s thought about it, deep in the recesses of his mind, on and off for so long. It’s never seemed like an option, and he thinks that it probably still isn’t, and Sam is just a terrible gossip.
Tony can’t wrench his gaze away, starry-eyed and single-minded, and Steve knows he’s just as bad. They dry each other off and find the blankets when they find the bed again, and Steve holds Tony to him and never wants to let go. He only stills once they’re completely tangled, legs slotted together and the planes of Tony’s bare back a grounding presence against Steve’s still-pounding heartbeat.
The spiced meat and creamy tzatziki help him push down the overwhelming nausea and ignore the bone-deep ache running through his entire body.
along with it.
Tony hangs up, and Steve stares at the screen.
“Tony and I are old friends,” he says, because she’s sixteen and he’s not going to get into a decade of interpersonal dynamics with her. “I guess we move around when we sleep. It’s not a sexual thing.”
She watches him carefully, and they both know that he’s never talked about the future, his past, not like this before. He’s never confirmed anything like this before.
Rogers doesn’t have to ask for clarification as he rattles off the roster.
This time when he wakes, he knows it is for good.
“I just don’t wanna ask for something he can’t give,” he mumbles into the speaker, wedging his free hand in his pocket and guarding his shoulders.
Steve doesn’t know how to grieve.
They both move around as little as possible, trying to get comfortable without disrupting the delicate balance between them, and maintaining as much distance between them as they can. Steve doesn’t want to push, but he has so many questions, and he parses through them methodically until he finds one that feels adequate without prying. Then, he listens for Tony’s breathing.
His heart aches, and he’s reminded of why he doesn’t like to remind himself. The band grows tight, and he doesn’t register Howard speaking at first.
Any momentary confidence Steve may have possessed earlier when messing around disappears. Because Tony is a notorious womanizer, something he’s been able to keep in mind without questioning too much; because Tony is a ruthlessly efficient businessman, and this is technically business. It’s for Tony’s career, yet another piece about one of the most desirable men on the planet, and it’s been difficult to discern the motives behind the flirting that seem to come as naturally to him as making money always has been.
“I can - ”
A soft exhale blooms through the speaker. “The CIA,” the voice repeats. “Or is it witness protection? Because really, Steve, you keep telling me that you’re just some journalist, but it was near impossible to get someone to actually connect me to your personal line before I was forced to run through the server and find the extension myself. And I’ve got a top-of-the-line AI on my side, you know.”
Tony swipes the yellow mug fondly and slurps noisily before knocking his elbow into Steve’s.
“I love you,” he says directly into Tony’s ear, closing his eyes at the sudden rush of emotion that brings that tell-tale prickling to his eyes.
Natasha signals the bartender for another pair of shots.
He’s steady, but Tony knows him better than that and reaches out a hand to skate over the valleys of his abdomen.
“It’s a pity she’s with her mother this weekend,” Wanda says, as she lets Steve peek in her room. “Tony says she’d love the pool.”
“There’s nothing about Stane here.”
They partied, and there were strippers.
"Dummy and the other bots have been taking care of them in the living room," Friday assures them. "Pepper and Happy were originally taking care of them, but they… did not survive."
“Yttrium,” she says. “Don't worry Harry, Y is a hard one.”
“Still no word from the others?” Steve asked, though he was sure that he wouldn’t like the answer.
Okay, before you guys read or complain about the tiny in comparison chapter (though it is called an intermission for a reason), this actually has just about zero impact on the plot of Mistakes. In fact, I wasn't even planning on doing this! I was watching Tag last night, and I was like 'Wow, Jeremy Runner is basically Clint Barton in this!' so I wrote a chapter about what happened to Clint in the months after Chapter 10/Civil War. So enjoy!
“Good to see you,” he got back.
He pulled out the ring from his pocket, kneeling down in front of Tony to hold it out. Tony wanted to stop him, to not do this right now. Ultron, if he was going to kill anyone today, it was going to be Tony. And if Tony died he didn’t want this to be the last conversation he has with Steve.
“I’m only doing as instructed,” she interrupts, and yeah, okay, he’ll concede that she lacks the tendency towards social niceties that Pepper had resolutely stood by, and he respects it. “If you’re looking to decline, I’ll inform Mr. Stark so he can proceed accordingly.”
If Rogers wants to starve in protest of whatever he could possibly be protesting (probably the fact that Tony had been the one to swoop in and save the day, instead of him), then so be it.
Tony breaks into a dazzling smile, and then he’s reeling Steve in and he’s fitting their mouths together, and Tony is kissing him, and it’s just the barest pressure against Steve’s lips, but it’s tender and real and more than Steve ever thought he’d manage to wring out of the multiverse.
“I feel like I know you,” Tony says, and there it is, that bleeding heart of his, the one that got him killed in the end.
, and he presses in to get a better angle, to get in deeper, because if this is real, he’s not missing the opportunity to give it all he’s got.
“I’m getting pruney.” The way Tony confides in him makes it feel like a secret, something far more illicit than it really is.
It’ll have to be enough, he decides, pushing not-memories of shadowy bodies out of his head to make room for too many references to Tony’s expertly tailored suit pants.
“Nobody had to,” Clint chuckles. “You didn’t bat an eye when he asked for help getting sunscreen on his back.”
“Steve Rogers,” he answers reflexively. He wonders if his boss has forgotten to tell him something, or if Clint’s being obnoxious as usual, and uses his teeth to rip open the pack of almonds while setting the half-empty can to his far left atop a short stack of legal pads he can’t remember placing there.
Well, Steve thinks that this is it.
After they make their way back to the bedroom with the intention of getting some more clothes on their bodies, Tony enthusiastically returns the favor and Steve nearly puts a fist through the wall. Tony refuses to allow him a shirt, and Steve just rolls his eyes as he pulls on pants.
Rogers looks up from where he’s banging the heel of his hand against the bottom of a ketchup bottle.
Tony looks at him, long and searching. Steve doesn’t know what he’s looking for and doesn’t care what he finds, because he knows what he wants, and nothing is going to sway him at this point.
Steve immediately jerks, his hips searching upwards, and Tony hides a satisfied grin with a filthy open-mouthed kiss, corralling Steve’s wild tongue with his and stroking that same nipple once more, twice more, the pad of his thumb as light as air as the skin pebbles up and pushes back. It’s amazing and he’s brightly aware of Steve pinning him to the door, hand lifting off his thigh in acquiescence, and Tony pauses the bruising kiss long enough to divest Steve of his shirt entirely.
Tony might laugh, a weird ephemeral noise as he strokes a thumb over the line of Steve’s jaw, so Steve just bites lightly on the edge of the kiss and loses his eyes to the back of his head with how Tony takes it as an invitation to ramp it up a notch. Tony rises to the unspoken challenge, adjusting the angle as he lifts up and pushes into the framework of Steve’s gripping body. The world narrows down to Tony, now tilting Steve’s head back far enough to open up the kiss, scotch-tinged tongue dipping in tenderly while there’s suddenly a leg between his, Tony swung half over him like he belongs there, molding into all his folds and corners like he’s supposed to fit perfectly in Steve’s lap -
it’s just a minor stab wound that requires a little surgery, and Tony is forced to drag Rogers out of the waiting room by the scruff of his neck once she’s asleep and recovering.
“I know,” Steve says, because that’s not what he’s getting at. “I just don’t want to leave anything unturned.”
“Steve,” she says, biting her lip. “You’re scaring me, darling.”
Steve is smearing a thumb across the screen when another message buzzes through.
He shifts his hand to the back of Tony’s head, tentatively,
He grasps for Steve’s drink, which Steve wordlessly slides towards him, and downs the entire thing in one almighty chug. His lips are red as he wipes at them, Steve notes, a reddish-flowery-pink, and he briefly fantasizes about whether or not they get even redder under less innocent circumstances.
He knows what he’s done.
Tony laughs genuinely and it makes him feel lighter. “Careful, you might swell up my head.”
Stark purses his lips together until they're pale and bloodless. His jaw clenches and he twists his body to the side.
One last time, one last time
, so I tried to–I don’t know–I just–” Steve fumbled for a response.
“You know what else I find interesting, Captain? It’s that you chose Barnes over the person you bonded with. Now, how’d that happen, I wonder? Considering your very biology is supposed to ensure the survival of your mate at all costs. What’d you do, Rogers?”
“He did.” She smiles, “He told me that was the easiest promise he’d ever had to make. That was ten years ago.”
He realizes he hasn’t been able to read him since shortly after Tony got Extremis.
"So lemme get this straight," Stark mutters, "the only super-powered people you have in your 'verse are aliens, Steve, T'Challa, the Witch, and Spider-kid."
Natasha reels because Rogers does not
“The fetus is fine. It’s a strong one.” She doesn’t say anything else, but the look she’s giving Tony means she
"You lie!" The alien yells furiously. "I can sense at least two in this building! You will tell me where they are, or I
“I know. I wouldn’t ask if there was anyone else, but Tony– and Natasha– are hunting us.”
“How do I fix this?” He asks her, voice low and thick with misery.
Strange moves aside.
Rogers blinks. "That sounds dangerously arrogant."
to speak with Stark. It’s almost like they have years of bad history.
Ross narrows his eyes, “Really, is that so?”
Tony raises an eyebrow, “What’s this? You don’t think the good Captain is Mr. Perfect?”
“Rhodes.” Rogers is extremely worried now. “What’s happened?”
. Tony gets the feeling this is going to be much, much worse than Loki's invasion a few years ago. The brunet swallows and breaks out into a cold sweat. They are going to need

“I was transferring from my community college to a university beach-side that Autumn, and I’d just moved in to this new apartment with two other girls. We were good friends, so we decided to go wandering around to explore the area. It was fun… up until it started pouring rain out of nowhere. So, the girls and I duck into a local, hippie coffee shop where I lay eyes on a man sitting in the far corner all alone on his laptop.” Jacey laughs and her eyes are bright with mirth.
Yeah, so that one was a little shorter, but I'm on a roll, guys.
The beatings get worse, but it’s the psychological warfare that the doc’s subjected him to that finally takes its toll and makes him go quiet. He’s having a strange out-of-body experience when he hears the doc chatting on the phone.
She huffs and Tony can picture her puffing up with pride, “
“Are you drunk?” The blond asks.
Tony groans. "Alright, what?"

Stark holds up a shaking thumb and grits through a wobbly smile. "I-I'll try--"
Lord knows I wouldn’t, but I’ve got my head screwed on straight now, I swear it, and I’ll do better. Be a better friend; listen. But God, Tony, why didn’t you come to me about the SHRA
"Luciana Margaret Stark will be the girl," he says decidedly. "Lucy means 'light' and Ana... Ana was Jarvis's wife. She was-- she was incredible. If my mom was like a cloud, then she was the ground, and Aunt Peggy was a force of nature," he smiles, "she probably wasn't suited for parenting. Too badass, and plus she didn't want kids; she loved her career. But she and my mother were best friends, and she always told the best stories. She gave pretty good advice, too, before she-- well, you know. I loved her like another mother regardless. Her, and Ana as well."
Tony grins shark-like, "My Rhodey said that."
["SHIT! I'm calling Steve and Strange, right now. I'll call up a midwife I know, too, everything will be fine, okay? Hang in there! Remember to breathe and relax!"] Jacey hangs up and Tony is left alone.
hah. hahaha. haha. *builds fortress with really tall walls and a nice defense system* wat chu guys think of my castle? yeah? pretty awesome, huh? I'm not-- I'm not hiding, no, of coURSE not. that'd be... hah... that'd mean i'd done something-- *winces* I just-- *shifty eyes* okay I'm so sorry about this *hands reader a cookie and tissue box* *hides behind walls*
“You will not believe me unless you see for yourself. Come. Quickly. We must hurry.”
Tony sighs. This peace is... amazing. Everything Tony's ever wanted.
First of all: thanks for all the views, kudos, and reviews I've received. I love it all. Here's a chappie. OH remember to subscribe, k? ;)

Tony snorts. Batshit insane isn’t what he’d say to describe the situation with the others at all. No, he’d call it more of a brutal backstabbing in a Roman colloseum than insanity. He sighs heavily, exhausted. Tony looks out the window of the Jeep and tries not to think. He tries to see the outside world and the landscape of dirt and farmland because he
"I know, Jay. You're always trying to look out for me. I'm sorry, too."
? You should be
Tony flushes and sputters, "Not- I didn't -" He knocks a book off the bed with his foot. "No! That's not what it -" He puts his face in his hands, the blush spreading to his neck and ears.
Steve inhales. "I imagine
The one emotion he had more trouble dealing with than any of the others combined, however, was grief. He first saw grief in all it’s terrible glory the day they hauled Tony away in a van. An event he witnessed at the JCTC stronghold on a television. Ross had been smirking, and then Vision had experienced rage. Next, he saw Colonel Rhodes crying out on the same TV and Vision didn’t know what to do.
“I… I admit that I was wrong, on all accounts. I should not have done what I did. I– no. There is no excuse for my actions. I will, and I am, taking full responsibility for the consequences.”
Natasha is decidedly very unhappy with a lot of people right now. Namely, Steve. Also Clint. She’d handed her burner phone over to a terrified archer who could hear his wife yelling from two feet away. Damn fool better be sorry, and Natasha always kind of secretly enjoyed it when Laura tore Clint a new one. It was amusing and plus she seemed to be the only one who could screw that man-child’s head on straight besides Phil Coulson and, occasionally, herself.
“Mmmm…” Tony just snuggles into Rhodey’s chest and practically purrs.
Steve gets an odd look on his face. "I'm enhanced and even my sense of smell isn't great enough to pick up smells of individual people."
“60? That’s about 40 miles, so… like… what? An hour away? Maybe a little over from here?”
She nods. Tony sighs and pulls her in for a hug. She lays next to him, soaking in his scent and warmth and finally drifts off to sleep.
"Are you okay?" Steve asks tenderly--worriedly.
"Jesus, man, you look wrecked. What the hell happened?"
Scratch concerned, she's terrifying him a little bit. "Jacey, what the hell is going-"
[1] a demi is a character who has characteristics of more than one designation. Jacey, in this case, is a beta with femalpha characteristics. i.e. she sort of smells like an alpha (pheromones) and she has an alphan presence (commanding, leader, badass, etc)

(p.s. i made up the scene from KUWtK. idk if that happens or not. i'm abusing my artistic liberties with my shiny creative license ok. it was supposed to be funny. i'm funny right?)
Happy New Year!
He could certainly see, back then, that she and Happy were getting... close. He'd have been jealous and bitter and a little bit betrayed by that if he hadn't been so busy keeping up with Captain America's insatiable libido. Say what you want about the Capsicle, but 95 years old he was not. It'd been going good, and Tony had been careful. Though, it would seem, not careful enough.
Okay! I know it ends kind of suddenly, but I sort of kind of already have some ideas for another three chapters? So, yeah. More chapters!
A few days ago, when they had kissed on the escalator, it had felt hot and fast and explosive. This time, it was slow but somehow just as heated. Tony felt his entire body heat as his lips glide against Steve's. Even if it was hot, it was still chaste. No tongue, no touching aside from the hand on Tony's jaw.
Tony was feeling light headed now, and he felt like sitting up was taking to much effort. He leaned, landing with a soft thump on his side on the floor.
Tony had loved Captain America as a kid. He had loved the stories his Aunt Peggy told him, loved the hero, loved the legend. He had kept a poster on his wall, and had all the comics. Because Captain America was his hero.
“No,” Tony said, handing it back. “You can have it. It… It was mine when I was little. Aunt Peggy made it for me. She knew Captain America.”
Sucking in a shaky breath, Tony did his best to tier up the leg of his pants. He pulled it apart, having the nanomites stitch it back together in the vague shape of a pouch. Hands shaking, he carefully gathered as much of the dust and ash as he could, being as gentle as he could as he gathered it all into his makeshift bag.
XxXXxX
He tried to sit up, only to his at the sharp tug at his side. Tony had to lower himself back down, tugging off the sheets to look at his chest. He wasn't wearing a shirt, and instead found pristine white bandages wrapped around his midriff. Slowly, he brushed his fingers over it, brow furrowed, trying to find the end of the white strips.
“And there’s Stevie,” he chuckled. “Come on, Stark’s got Bruce and Clint’s setting up the jet to take us to somewhere safe.”
“Where did that even come from?” Tony chuckled.
“Just do it Wolf.”
“Tony!” she cried, clearly frightened. “Tony, are you okay?”
Everything was going great for Bucky, and he didn't want to change a thing.
STARK: We can amend the hours a little bit.
Turning around, Peter looked around to see if he could spot him. The skate park was pretty open, with only the food stands and the tables being covered. If Wade was here, Peter would be able to spot him.
She got up and walked off, and Peter and the three other teens sat awkwardly in their circle. Peter glance around, then to the large box that had been left by Mrs. Warren. He was the first to move, and tentatively opened the box.
“Really Tony?” Steve turned to scowl at him. “Really? I thought you were all about tech and style and
He pulled back, beaming as Peter gave him that confused little look he did when things didn't add up quite right. Wade knew he had questions. Peter
“Sorry,” a voice came behind him, Peter running up in a thin black jacket. “I’ll pick up.”
He didn't say a word throughout the entire trip. In fact, he ignored what little conversation there was. Tony did listen when the others discussed their plans, though. It was a terribly simple plan, but Tony was set to join the flanking team. He didn't argue, and just remained in his seat.
“The size of a spork,” Wade confirmed with a sigh of his own.
His old friend gave him an odd look, but followed him back to the jet. He let a calm settle over him, because he knew that he would never let the vision become reality.
Tony hummed, listening to the reporter until she said that people thought he had PTSD, and that he was hiding out with Peter. Trying to hide. Stark men don’t hide. The render was completed, and Tony drank a bit more veggie sludge before heading to get himself and Peter into some suits.
STARK: Iran.
Wade ignored him, groaning as he got up to grab a bottle of Jack Daniels. “The only way to fix this is to find Francis. He fucked up my face so I’ll make him fix this butterface.”
XxXXxX
“I want you to not tell Peter,” he said again. “I want to tell him on my own. Just… not yet. Want to have a few days to think of a plan. So… just don’t tell him, okay?”
Once his suit was on, Wade spent the next hour getting every single gun he could from around the house. The duffle was soon full, and Wade slung it over his back as he went running to his meeting spot. He was early, so he dropped the duffle as he did his best to take deep breaths and keep as calm as he could.
when he killed those hydra agents in western Kentucky last month!”
“Not. A. Word.”
XxXXxX
“He’s met me!” Wade chirped, grinning. “Technically, I met Peter’s dad before I met Peter, so…”
When they arrived, they did find Ultron and Klaue, as well as the Maximoff twins. Rhodes and Sam both went off to attempt to chase down the stolen Iron Legion and Ultron himself. Steve and the others were focused on Klaue’s mercenaries, and the Maximoff twins were there, attacking when they were distracted.
Thankfully, Pepper agreed, leaving to go cool off and taking Peter with her. As much as Tony loved his son, he needed a moment. However, within an hour, he had forgotten the deal, making some fixes to the armor. When she returned, without Peter, he looked up.
“Jarvis, you traitor!”
For a moment, his dad seemed to think. “It'll be hard, but we can use your birth certificate to track down information.” His fathers calloused hand came up to smooth back his hair, soothing him. “But I promise, Peter. I'll find out who she was.”
“It’s just a game. Nevermind.” Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.”
XxXXxX
STARK: It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.
He tossed the smashed helmet to Tony, who looked up at his old father figure. Never again, he thought, however, as Stane joined him on the center of the roof.
I'll try to get the next Chapter out within a month, and if not a month, them before April.

“Delay the order to Pep!” Tony said, rather manly, and not at all in a panicked squeak. “I'll… I'll deal with it!”
“Gulmira,” Yensin had said casually. “A small village.”
“Ugh, I think I’m gonna lose my lunch.”
"Well it can't be good! I mean, you're evil!"
Before he could ask what the agent ment, there was a sharp tug on his body. He let out a strangled cry, wanting to tell them to stop. White spots danced across his vision, before it all went black. The next thing he knew, he was on his back, feeling dizzy and disoriented.
"No, I'm- Well, yes. I guess I am. I mean, that's what Savvy always says, but I promise! Everything will work out in the end! Here, just…"
And then, he fell limp once more. Tony stumbled back, eyes wide with horror. He would have saved them if he could have. He would! He did everything he could to keep Steve safe, to protect the team in the only ways he knew how, and-
“Yeah,” Tony said, lifting to look at the cards. “The truth is…” He trailed off, turning to look at Peter. His son stared up at him, big eyes practically pleading. So, Tony turned, and cleared his throat. “The truth is… I am Iron Man.”
“I know that it’s confusing,” Tony interrupted. “It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I’m a superhero.”
Tony hesitated. The weight of the pouch was heavy around his neck, a reminder of what needed to be done. But when Tony looked down at the two toddlers, Susan staring and waiting patiently as Johnny made irritated grabbing hands at him, he couldn't help but want to curl up with them like he had done what felt like ages ago. They were still so small, but they'd grown in the month that he'd been gone.
“Look at you,” Obie said, forcing a smile. He glanced at Peter, who puffed up his cheeks and tried to look bigger. “Hey, what a surprise.”
“Scanning, Baby Boss.” There was a pause, Peter feeling his chest tighten. “It appears that you have gained small hairs on your fingers and hands, similar to that of a spiders. While I'm glad you're finally awake and seem to be unharmed, this is worrying.”
“Do you mind?” Obadiah said more then asked, pushing a reporter out of the way as Tony came up, Peter clinging to him, now on high alert.
XxXXxX
Steve had barely held back from punching him, and instead locked Wade in the newly vacant cell. The blond was now back in place, pacing and demanding answers from Wade like he had done to Thanos. Tony wasn't sure that Steve could get any answers from Wade. They had never really gotten along, even when they had been trying for Peter's sake.
"Wade?" Ned asked, as he ran by the large teen.
Steve was exhausted, but happy.
“Never mind who told me. Show me.”
“I didn’t mean for this to happen,” Wade said quickly. “I didn’t- That night, the last time I saw you, your dad was gonna give me some gear as a graduation gift, but I passed out. When I woke up in the hospital… They told me…”
“I know,” Peter said, placing a hand on Wade’s shoulder as he reached back to slowly pull the mask off with the other. “You told me… Spiderman about the scars… And I don’t care. As long as it’s you.”
“Come on!” Obie cried dramatically. “The arc reactor? That’s a publicity stunt! Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up!”
“I know,” Tony groaned.
“It’s about time, though,” Hill said, Bruce nodding in agreement.
And then the coughing started. It began with a tingle in the back of his throat, making him try to clear, but that only led to him coughing. He coughed and coughed, on hand over his mouth as he reached out wildly for something to cough into. It felt like something was in his throat, working its way up, and his hand was already wet with something that wasn’t spit. Finally, he gave one final hack, a glod of wetness landing in his palm.
She trailed off, her free hand reaching down to shuffle notebooks around on her desk. Without caution, she tosses a few to the floor. Wade would shoot her, but if she was telling the truth, if she was going to fix everything, then he didn't want to miss the chance to be reunited with Peter.
“Jarvis,” he gasped, holding on tight. “Call rhodey’s cell!”
“Take us to the hosp-”
“What?! I thought you said it was safe!”
“I am,” Tony said, taking a deep breath. “This is a flight stabiliser. Completely harmless.”
“Hold still you little prick,” Stane laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I forgot my own birthday.”
It was then that Peter felt every hair on his body stand up straight. A tingle ran down his spine, and everything seemed to move in slow motion as he leapt into action. Dr. Connors lunged for his aunt, and Peter smashed through the window to tackle him. They went into a tussle, his sudden attack catching Connors by surprise. Pepper gasped in surprise, watching as Peter got the man down, shooting webs at Connors arms, hoping to keep the man down.
Peter rolled his eyes, though a blush was starting to dust his cheeks. With a huff, he dropped his board and pushed off, rolling around the skate park for a while. It wasn’t that he didn’t want a little brother or sister, or that he didn’t think his fathers could do it. He just didn’t think right now was the right time for them. But thoughts kept rolling around in his head, snowballing now that he was really thinking about it. If his dad and pops did adopt, would they adopt a baby or a kid? Where would the kid sleep? The tower was big, but the penthouse was really only meant to have two bedrooms, with the third room being a sort of hobby room with the floor to ceiling windows.
“Let’s take a picture. Come on. Picture time!”
Swallowing, Tony held the bag to his chest, looking around as he chewed his lip. The Guardians had gotten to Titan somehow… Likely a ship. If he could just find it… Get it going and make it back to Earth… He could do everything he could to fix this crazy mess.
As the reporters sat, Peter opened up the burger, holding it out to him. Tony took it, placing a kiss to Peter’s temple in thanks. Peter didn’t say anything, and Tony reached into the bag to pull out the box of nuggets. He got a smile in return, and watched as Peter shyly ate his nuggets.
Then, Steve’s hand lashed out, grabbing Tony’s wrist. “You,” Steve struggled to say. “You… could have… saved us…”
“So,” Steve said when he came in. He stood to lean against the table of the conference room, looking at Tony with arms crossed.
"They?"
“What?” Peter squaked, and shook off Wades hand when he grabbed him, fixing the reporter with a hard gaze. “My father is a
After the Vulture ordeal was taken care off, his dad pulled some strings and got Liz’s mom a job working in the tower. She mostly answered calls, and it wasn’t enough to keep their house, but they found somewhere closer to the school, and much cheaper, so Liz got to stay.
As Weasel went looking for all the guns, Wade hurried to pull on his suit, mind reeling. He would need backup, and Weasel was no match for this guy. It had to be someone he could trust, who wouldn’t questions about why he was asking for help for to long. Someone he could find fairly quickly.
“Thor,” Steve called, and Tony could see the way that he was slowly inching over to shield Tony from the new creation. “You helped make this thing?”
Wait… Readers? Wade shook off the chain of thought, and focused on the now.
Tony stared. He… he had expected them to tell him what a bad idea it was. But he wasn't expecting this. Never this… never them actually telling him to
“What?” Pops said, sitting up. “What about the team?”
XxXXxX
So once they were out, they snuck on a bus, got a little lost on the way, and ended up in New York after two days. Not to bad, Wade had figured as he made sure Bob was coming with him to Weasel's new bar. It was in a shadier part of Manhattan, some place called Hell's Kitchen. It was near the water, by Jersey, and kinda down an alleyway. There was their old plaque from Tennessee; Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Children. It was still the same old plaque, scarred and beaten, and now burned, from the years of mercs running in and out, but it was still as inviting to him as it ever had been.
It wasn't an unreasonable thing to ask for, not by any means. But it was such a difficult thing to do. To go back, and look for all this information that Tony didn't know about the woman that had his child? The woman that Tony didn't even know the name of? It was…
“I’d still come to the big stuff,” Bucky said hurriedly. “Just… It’s been four years since I was freed from Hydra. And it’s not that I’m not thankful to Stark for the help, but I haven’t really seen much other then the New York and places we go to on missions. I just want to explore. See what all is out there.”
XxXXxX
“Hello?”
“I want to see it.”
“Doctor Strange?” the doctor asked. “I used to work with Strange. He went off the grid almost a year ago. Where have you been?”
XxXXxX
Peter nodded, ever so slightly, as Tony carried him to his room. Tony’s room, big and spacious, was more used then Tony remembered. He rarely slept there, except when he had, uh, company over. Now, it looked like someone had been sleeping in the bed daily for months.
Putting Peter in the car, he buckled him into the car seat and drove. He drove a little fast, glancing into the mirror every now and then to check on Peter. The kid fell asleep rather quickly, and didn’t make even the slightest of peeps the entire ride. And for that, Tony was thankful.
“Four or five moments,” Steve says, slowly walking towards him. “That’s all you need to be a hero. People think it’s a full time job. Wake up a hero, eat like a hero, go to sleep a hero. But it’s not. It’s four or five moments where you make a decision to be better then you were, or be better then your enemy. Moments where you make a choice. To make a sacrifice, fix a wrong, save a friend.” He gestured to Francis. “Spare an enemy.
Obie quickly led him away from the podium, and Tony took Peter’s hand as he was ushered away. Obie took over the conference, and Tony led Peter outside, scooping him up as they went. He had Happy drive him to the factory, to go see the big arc reactor. Peter was amazed by it all, and Tony couldn’t blame him.
Wade scowled down at his clothes. He hated wearing suits. Really, he did. They made him feel like one of those cheap criminals that think they’re so badass in spy movies. But this was for Peter, so he would fucking deal with it.
Tony ignored her, looking at the different photos. It was definitely the Ten Rings, carrying cases with his company's logo. And then, he saw it. The Jericho missile. It was right there, clean and brand fucking new.
However, he ran into a snag rather quickly, and called the first person he knew would be in the house.
“You know what?” Tony asked as Obadiah led him off to the side. “I was naive before, when they said ‘here’s the line, we don’t cross it. This is how we do business.’ If we’re double-dealing under the table… Are we?”
"Just you and me now, Pete," Tony said, voice soft. "But at least we're on our way home…"
“Just read read it word for word.”
Tony could only stare, his brain seeming to stop working. Steve was… proposing. Steve was on one knee, with a ring, asking Tony to marry him. The same ring that Tony had in his hand. The one of a two of a kind ring that the jeweler had said there had only one available. Which meant that Steve had bought his ring before Tony had. And
“Well… Maybe you should go for it?” Steve suggested. “I know that the, uh, you-know-what has been kinda driven you a little crazy. I know it’s hard, but you know the saying. And it’s been two years, Buck. Even more for them. It’s better that no one knows and that we don’t go digging the knife in old wounds.”
“Oh Weeeaseeeeel~” Wade sing songed as he skipped in, Bob squirming behind him. “I'm back!”
Tony frowned. “What? No, no. I want to do this now. See, Steve, there’s this thing that I’ve been meaning to say and-”
“And be the only mercenary with up to date Stark Tech weapons?” Wade cheered. “Hell yeah!”
Gwen seemed to be next, and Peter studied her. She looked kind of familiar to… “Gold, W, Europium, Nitrogen. Gwen Stacy.”
With tears welling in his eyes under the mask, Wade found his feet already moving. He ran, faster then he had in a long time, through the dimly lit night streets, towards the beacon of light that was Avengers Tower. He threw open the doors to the lobby, scarring the desks night secretary, and was running to the elevator to the private floors.
“That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen,” Rhodey said, standing with Peter, who looked scared and worried.
“You said he was stable,” Steve was saying as they flew over. “You said that we could trust him to not be evil.”
Peter sat on a roof, stretching as he looked around at the quiet streets bellow. It had been almost a year since… the incident, and Peter was finally feeling back to normal. Well, as normal as he could. He was still hurt, and he still loved Wade, even though he was gone, but maybe in a few years he could move on.
His face was so serious, Tony couldn’t help but laugh, pressing his forehead to the top of Peter’s mess of hair as he did. That’s how Obie found them, Peter looking confused but serious and Tony laughing his ass off.
“That’s what they say.” Tony turned to face him, studying his face. “Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?”
“Not exactly,” Peter hummed, adjusting his glasses. “But I heard that your dad has a division dedicated to bio-chem tech. Stark Industries doesn’t really do much of that.”
“I’m not going to-” Tony started, only for Steve to interrupt.
“We're going to get some real food in you right now,” Steve said, tone holding no room for nonsense. “And then you're going straight to bed. We've had a hell of a week, and you need sleep.”
-fucker!” Wade screamed as he threw Peter’s backpack at the wall of his room.
Steve took a deep breath, leaning back in his chair. "Yes… When we got close enough, Wade… He cut off Thanos' arm. The one with the gauntlet. I took the opportunity to take it, put the last Stone in while Wade kept cutting Thanos up, and I… I snapped. My fingers, I mean. To bring everyone back that I could. And when I did…"
“It was,” Tony hummed, looking at the new one. “It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I’m swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.”
