him and that’s honestly even worse, Rogers. Or maybe it’s the part where Earth is about to be decimated, hmm? That must be it, because I know you can’t be talking about how the entire globe is prepared to ignore all the shit you and your pals pulled off this past year is what’s
Steve’s never been good at any of this. Sam and Bucky follow after him, asking why he hasn’t done more to get them back. They never leave.
There had to be something he could say to make this right. Somewhere, in the back of his mind, there had to be a plan of what he might do or say to take it all back and start again. He’d waited so long to make this right. This couldn’t be it.
. I would have known, but if I hadn’t made it, you couldn’t have handled that. It wasn’t about me at all.”
Tony’s body jostled and pitched forward under his hold as Steve curled over him, letting himself teeter on the edge of release, holding back his orgasm with the sheer force of his will. He didn’t want this to end. He wanted to crawl inside Tony and live there forever, a first line of defense against any threat that came their way.
“Tony…” Steve’s hands flutter at his sides and Tony watches out of the corner of his eyes as Steve rests his hands at his back, then brings them forward to settle at his hips, then clutching the top of his belt. Anything to avoid crossing his arms, he realizes a moment later, and Tony wonders who taught Steve that trick. Sam, probably. Or Barnes, in his effort to look like a less threatening goat herder.
“Apologies, Clinton, but it brings me great excitement to bear witness to another Midgard festival! Tell me, what is this Fourth of July?” Thor asked, not markedly quieter.
Steve chose not to comment on how he’d effectively been voluntold he’d be cooking his own birthday dinner.
He never has any words for Peter. No matter how many times he runs the loop and Tony dies in his arms, Steve can’t ever bring himself to look Peter in the eye.
When Tony doesn’t reply, Rhodey runs a hand across the short-cropped hair on the top of his head, drawing attention to the silver that lines his temples more and more every day. How many of those grey hairs are because of him?
Twining their fingers together, he presses Tony’s hands over his head, stretching out over him until their hips fit together, rolling as the pleasure builds low in his stomach. He wants to take his time, guide Tony to a peak just to hold him there, not letting him tip over until Tony’s desperate and pleading, out of his mind with need.
When tomorrow eventually slips away and becomes the wee hours of the next morning, he drinks so much he blacks out.
He’s not even that hungover when he freezes up mid-lunge, trying to take down the Falcon who breezes past him. Second-guessing his target gives Steve the second he needs to yank him from out of the air and throw him down onto the mat. Steve, naturally, bears his weight down onto the armour to subdue him and that’s enough.
Steve comes, hours later, and taps on the glass while Tony’s lying prone on the old futon that somehow survived the destruction. Or maybe it’s new and just ugly.
“Your husband trying to kill you creates reasonable grounds for separation,” Tony quips as if they haven’t already had this conversation multiple times before. He doesn’t know what Rhodey’s angle is tonight. They’ve carefully avoided the topic and danced around it for weeks leading up to the council sessions.
Steve swallows, Adam’s apple bobbing thick in his throat, but he holds back the tears and lets his face go carefully blank. Maybe he has a better poker face than Tony has given him credit for.
A big last thank you to fundamentalblue for her fantastic beta work, and resurrectedhippo's thoughtful comments every step of the way, beginning to end.
Striding back out of the Clerk’s Office almost a half-hour later, papers tucked under one arm and cell phone in the other, Tony finds Steve still waiting for him outside.
After breakfast, they opt to ditch the game highlights and instead, Tony takes Rhodey down to where they’ve set up the B.A.R.F. program to run in the Compound. It’s not massive, but Tony has dedicated almost an entire floor to the set up in a way that’s intentional but subtle.
Tony’s eyes widened, but he leaned in and put a hand on his right shoulder, steadying him. “No harm, no foul. Can’t change what’s in your DNA. Now, tell me what happened so we can avoid it for next time.”
Steve’s fingers are running through his hair, slipping down to cup his cheek and tip his head up but Tony ignores it, swallowing him down without meeting his eyes.
“First,” Tony says, with a sweeping gesture, plucking the multitool out of Bucky’s back pocket while he’s arms deep in the inner workings of the car. “Don’t ever talk to me about Howard’s balls. Second, if you think I’m going to believe that backwater Brooklyn Bucky Barnes could afford a car like this, let alone his rent, I’m sending you back into cryo for more testing.”
When Steve saw Tony again months later, he was emaciated and half-dead on his feet. For a brief moment, Steve felt a glimmer of hope because Tony had come shuffling off the spaceship and stumbled down into his arms.
Tony’s eyes melt into molasses, shining and bottomless. “So that’s why I’m here,” he whispers, almost to himself. “Took you long enough, don’t you think?”
He slides the slick across Steve’s puckered entrance, relishing the way Steve clenches and releases before Tony’s even breached him, already begging to be filled. And he deserves a reward for that pretty picture, so Tony fills him carefully with one finger, then a second, whispering endearments and demands to relax as he seeks out Steve’s hot spot and strokes his fingers across it.
Steve gives a deflated sigh and sits up, arms resting on the arch of his knees under the light sheet.
“I’ll give you some time to yourself. Oh, here,” Pepper places his cell phone on the table beside the letters. “You can call when you’re ready. For me. Or,” she glances conspicuously towards the door before giving him a cheeky little smile and slipping back into her shoes.
There was a long, drawn pause. Maybe Tony had covered the receiver with his palm because the stuttering breaths he was drawing were muffled, though still audible. They seemed to fill the silence in the room, which had become bigger, emptier as the conversation went on.
“Your bots stealing our stuff or something, Tones?” He joked, but Steve could have sworn that Tony’s face had flickered blankly right before he rolled his eyes and laughed.
They’ve only just scratched the surface, and somewhere below where the light can reach there’s an ocean’s depth of darkness to wade through. It’s been there all along, and at least now he’s not trapped there alone. Steve has said he’ll try, that he’ll do what it takes, and Tony wants to believe him.
At first Steve passed it off as a future thing – men were just more comfortable with their affections in this time. Except then he realized that not only did Clint or Bruce or even Coulson not share his proclivity for physical touch, Tony didn’t seem to touch anyone else half as much as he touched Steve.
Peter agrees, and Tony lets out a breath he’d been holding onto for the entire exchange. Whatever Peter is thinking, he carefully hides behind an animated conversation with Bucky, first on the phone, and then in person when the assassin joins them in the workshop and presents his mottled shoulder for review.
Rhodes leaves him in peace for the rest of the afternoon, and he’s definitely stalling on calling in Peter, more so because he needs time to emotionally prepare himself.
He switches gears, pulling up holo after holo of new projects waiting for his attention and flips through them at a rapid pace, trying to find something to focus on. Something to quiet his mind while he sequesters away the dread in his stomach, forcing it down until it’s a pressure cooker of emotion waiting to explode.
“You’re so beautiful, Tony.” Steve slid his legs further apart, kneeling between them and pressing a reverent kiss to the curve of one cheek as he pressed forward with the tip of a finger. Tony’s body yielded without protest, welcoming the familiar touch.
“Before. Yeah, before.” Tony huffed an exhale, a maimed laugh shot through with something that made his next words feel like cruelty. “When I trusted you.”
Bucky rolled his eyes, grumbling something about never leaving the bed again, and never getting his way.
Eventually Tony ends up in his bedroom, circling the floor like a dog unable to settle, waiting for his owner to come home. An owner that’s never coming home but didn’t have the decency to abandon him on the side of the road or drop him at the shelter. No, Tony’s here, restless and trapped, the food and water all dried up.
“In a few minutes,” Steve cuts him off. Tony shifts a little closer, looking at the bed as if he wants to crawl in and tug Steve into his arms. “It’s not so bad.”
Steve laughs his way into his pants and is still laughing on the roof a few minutes later when Tony grabs hold of his wrist, snaps the faceplate shut, and fires them off to the battle.
“I knew it.” Steve kisses him, tasting blood in their mouths but it hardly matters. “Together. I knew it, Tony. We had to do it together, don’t you see?”
Tony doesn’t look like he’ll take any pleasure in it. He wonders, absently, if Steve weren’t here what escape Tony would have picked first: a bender in his shop, or the bottle.
Steve gets it right another week later, after half a dozen heartfelt and weepy conversations, when Tony starts to panic. When Steve’s arms around him feel like a vice and Steve’s voice in his ear as he’s drifting off to sleep triggers layers upon layers of fear and resentment because that delicate space between wake and sleep can be a tempting siren, drawing him into old memories that leave his chest aching and his hand trembling.
Irregular, and at times terrifyingly slow, but beating in his chest all the same. “I haven’t heard this in so long,” Steve says, and Tony doesn’t ask so he must already know.
Not that all wizards aren’t stupid, but this one is particularly distasteful when he goes ahead and drops a Pacific-sized dumpster fire right into Tony’s lap and expects everything to somehow be fine and dandy.
Tony and Morgan sharing pieces of fruit and reading bedtime stories. Tony tossing bits of food out the window to that damned alpaca. Kayaking, side-by-side through the water in the early days of autumn. It’s all there in his mind.
As he pulled back and started to thrust forward, Tony’s face went smooth with pleasure. A little whine escaped him and Steve rolled his hips again, hoping he could work his name from Tony’s lips or pull forward one of Tony’s breathy, desperate little sighs.
Bucky and Nat are in the kitchen later that morning when Tony skulks out of bed, thinking it’s late enough in the day that everyone will already be up and gone. It’s a rare morning off. Steve had cancelled their morning circuits the night before after Tony had drifted off in the warm circle of his arms.
The guilt in his chest starts to ease, his conscience absolved. This Tony is so unpredictable. He can’t tell where they’re headed next, or what to say. He’s making it up as he goes along, not unlike the rest of his life, and his thoughts drift to Tony’s family. Tony had so little time to enjoy the life he’d built for himself and Steve had gone ahead and stolen a whole extra lifetime.
.” Giving voice to it makes his chest ache, and Steve tightens his fist in the blankets. Tony, still teaching him lessons in vulnerability.
It’s genuinely hard to tell which pisses him off more. That Ross would imply that Steve was little more than some meaningless, dirty, throw away romp in the sheets, or the fact that he’s so quick to overlook the blatant disregard for international law, the destruction of Leipzig, and, oh right, how Steve had beaten him half to death in Siberia.
“Alpha, Bucky – Bucky please, please bite me. I want it. Fuck me, baby please, give it to me. Want it. Want you. Bucky? Bucky –
In the distance, Steve is running towards him. It’s a mirage and it makes him feel hysterical because his brain has played a lot of tricks on him in the last few days, and the tricks are always Steve. Steve holding him, Steve kissing his face, Steve yelling at him be it in anger or in sheer desperation.
Steve pries her hands off his face and sets them in her lap. Both of their fingers are wet. Steve wonders if his eyes are as red as hers, sparing her a slow blink as he stumbles up off the couch and towards the elevator on legs that shouldn’t be able to carry him.
“Just, hang on, okay?” He pulls away quickly, and passes Tony his shirt, encouraging him to follow suit as he rights his own clothes.
But here Steve is, with his crystal-clear logic, calling Tony on his bullshit and apologizing without question, and maybe Tony can let it be that simple. It’s been good for months, and he has been waiting for the anvil to come hammering down, but to what end? Because he’s desperate for this to end all over again?
The ache in his chest is back, radiating low and constant until it spread down his arm and into his wrist. The last thing that he wants to do is yell, so he absently rubs at the scar on his chest, clenching and unclenching his fingers. Trying to ignore how Steve’s eyes clock the movement, he gives a sharp shake of his head when Steve leans into him, reaching out as if he’s going to try and wrap him in his arms.
“Colonel?” Barnes cuts in. “Full disclosure, I’m not prepared or cleared to run drills at this time. I’m havin’ trouble with the arm, and I’m only recently out of cryo. Whatever I can do from the sidelines is fine, but until I have the green light from the team in Wakanda, I’m too great a risk to engage in hand to hand.”
Maybe Steve can’t be that for him right now. He hasn’t been ready to talk, so Steve’s waited. He’s been waiting for this. “I won’t.”
Tony whispered, and Steve could almost feel Tony’s lips pressed up against his ear, breathing out filth and urging him on.
Tony looks like a dream, a maniacal vision with his face pinched with strain from too long under the fluorescent lights and grease stains tracked up his arms despite freshly cleaned hands. Tony is entirely in his element, his left leg jerking a restless rhythm from where he’s perched on the edge of his chair, as if his body is just trying to keep up with the speed of his genius.
“Damn it!” Tony shouts, slamming his hand down on the countertop. “Stop talking to me in that fucking voice. I’m trying to have a conversation with Steve Rogers. You’ve met him, right? Is he in there, Cap?” The words are barbed and meant to sting.
“Tony?” Steve prompted, and Tony offered a mumbled affirmative but didn't really answer. “Tony? What kind of pasta do you want for dinner?”
As if one day he might find Bucky at breakfast, more Brooklyn than Soviet and everything would go back to the way it had been. Except Bucky had come back to find Steve with someone else, bonded despite the fact that that bond was shrivelled and faded to almost nothing. He was a different man now, and so was Bucky, and maybe neither of them was actually coming home.
“I don’t believe this is wise, Sir,” JARVIS is saying as Tony’s fingers fly over a keyboard. Line upon line of text appears at rapid speed on a massive, holographic computer screen. “I would deign to suggest this goes against my most basic protocols for the wellbeing of the Tower’s inhabitants.”
“Listen sweetheart, the reception’s not great up here. Fuck, I don’t even really know if you’re going to hear all this before we break the atmosphere.”
There’s no question of causality when the nightmares return at full force after the first letter arrives.
“No can do, boys. But thank you.” He pushes out, light, with a fake smile he can plaster on in his sleep. It’s not like he’s looking, but he catches Steve’s face fall and wonders when he’s finally going to catch a fucking clue.
“Oh, well that’s not so–wait, do you have a new super soldier web fluid you forgot to mention?” Peter rolls his eyes, like
Bucky snorts. “You used to follow him around everywhere.” Bucky directs his attention to the room. “Thomas was a scrawny little fella, smaller than Steve even, and he walked on crutches most days. Steve made it his mission to keep him safe from the neighborhood bullies.”
It’s shameful and he feels humiliated, as if he’s willing to just get down on his knees and beg Steve to take him back so he doesn’t have to be so alone anymore. Its reminiscent of a dog, begging at the corner of the table, happy for any scraps that might be tossed his way.
“By my calculations there was no immediate threat, and given the Captain’s inclination to, quote, ‘show you off to the city’—”
The thrusters kicked in and sent him jetting down, down, down, until the pressure of the deep had the suit shrieking and whining under the strain. He was so close, so close, he could almost reach out and—
“Well,” Natasha says, wrestling Clint down from one of the vent shafts. He lands flat on his ass beside her. “Isn’t this a pretty family picture.”
Steve almost treats him as if he’s delicate, hands fluttering across his back, settling softly at the top of his ass before finding a tentative grip at his hips. It’s as if he can’t tell what’s allowed, even though his hands knew every inch of Tony once.
“Someone would have to run him through the sequencing. He can’t use the software alone.” Tony muses aloud. “Would you run it for him? I don’t think he’d be comfortable with me doing it.”
.” Steve runs a soft hand through Tony’s hair, his expression morphing into something dark and melancholy. The regret is tangible in the way his lips curve down and he tips Tony’s face up with a finger under his chin.
The lounger is practically a bed, shaped like a half-cracked egg with a canopy that keeps the sun off Tony’s skin. He wants one for the mansion. Tony hardly has to move off to one side for Steve to fit with ease onto the space beside him. Hell, there’s room for another super soldier or two, if Tony were ever so lucky.
The conversation had come after one of the particularly challenging nights, when Steve, horrified, had struggled to wake Tony from whatever he’d been seeing. Shaking his shoulders and trying to tug Tony closer into his arms to rouse him had been fruitless. The screaming had only intensified, with Tony lashing out against him with a violence that bordered on feral.
The jumble of thoughts that follow simultaneously gut him and rip him to shreds, because it’s blatantly obvious, isn’t it? Steve’s probably working through memories of their time together so it doesn’t hurt so much. So, he can move on from whatever this was. Not initially how he’d intended B.A.R.F. to be used, but if Steve wants to use it to erase him–them–so be it.
Tony shuts his eyes and focuses on evening out his breathing. A hand trails across his chest and presses his wedding band down, leaving a sharp indentation above his left nipple.
“Don’t, please don’t.” Tony begs, closing his eyes and resisting the urge to cover himself. “Steve, please.
There were a lot of things to admire about Tony. The sweet chocolate brown of his eyes and the way those eyes crinkled when he laughed. The way he talked with his hands, always a cyclone of motion. The way he teased the people he loved, relentlessly.
Steve bit back a groan, stroking himself in earnest, rubbing the puppet across his chest where the fabric rasped over his nipples, teasing them into taut little points. Just hearing the sound of Tony’s voice left his cock pulsing between his legs, a drop of precome leaking from the tip to slick the way. Steve let his thumb press into the slit, spreading the moisture before teasing himself just below the glans until his thighs were twitching with the sensitivity.
“Sir has died, Captain. The Avalon Protocol was established in the event of death during a catastrophic event. It would allow me to take over and pilot the Iron Man suit remotely until the fight had ended, so the team would not be left short-handed. The battle is complete and thus the protocol remains active only so far as to allow me to transport Sir to his next location. I am terribly sorry for your loss.”
This is Tony at his prime, the Tony that found Steve when he was still trapped in the frozen wasteland of his own mind and gave him a home.
“We’re not asking you to forgive each other,” Steve says quietly, and Tony takes a significant interest in the dirt underneath one of his nails, mouth tipped down in distaste. “We’re asking you to put aside what you can, for now, for the greater good. I’m sure if the WSC can set aside the Accords, this is the very least we can do.”
Tony gives him a sharp nod with a look that gives nothing away as he starts digging around in one of his pockets. There’s the familiar tinkling sound and Steve almost refuses when Tony starts prying one of his fists open to shove the little silver bell into his palm.
“Not saying you’re wrong, Tones. You know I’m not. But at some point, this whole thing… it needs to stop being about blame. Don’t you think?”
He pulls back, rasping around a throat already rubbed raw by Steve’s cock. “Come on, Steve. Let me have it.”
“Mmfph.” Tony mumbled from inside his coffee cup, two holographic screens projecting up from his phone. He was seemingly reading the morning news, his work emails, and three other things that Steve couldn’t make out backwards all at once.
“That would be great, thanks.” Steve interrupted again, and Bucky glared. Steve jotted the code down into a notebook he kept in his pocket, shoving it aside for later. He thanked Pepper and ended the call before Bucky rounded on him.
and Steve can’t breathe. His chest aches with it all and he wants to wrap them up in his arms and never let them go. Steve’s been so damned lonely, that even when he was with Peggy it hadn’t been quite right.
Tony tilts his head and gives him a calculating look. It would be reasonable for Tony to be angry or resentful, and Steve steadies himself for whatever comes next. There had been so many times back in the early days he spent with Peggy, enjoying a peaceful evening in their perfect little house, when he’d hear Tony in his head.
When Steve tries to thread his fingers through his hair again to gain some control over Tony’s ministrations, he bats him away. Instead, he allows Steve’s hand to settle over his own on Steve’s thigh, losing himself in the slick, wet glide of his tongue over Steve’s shaft.
“Would you believe me if I said this was the final adventure?” Tony says, voice hitching on a disbelieving laugh. “I have no idea, really. Some people have called it Heaven. Some people think it’s like living in a permanent dream.”
Bucky wasn’t wrong; there had been a clear shift in Tony’s behaviour recently. Steve had attributed it to Stark Industries’ upcoming tablet release, and Tony’s work with the Maria Stark Foundation on a new charity branch, launching on a global scale to accompany their work with the Accords council.
Tony laughs and slaps a palm down on his chest. There’s a revelation in his eyes, like he’s finally fit the missing piece of an equation into place. It’s something Steve doesn’t need to hear to understand, he’d probably not be able to comprehend if he did.
“I’ll admit, there does appear to be a special, paternal sort of way that you react to young Mr. Parker,” Vision adds unhelpfully, and Tony squirms a little in his seat, saying nothing.
“Sorry,” he mumbles under his breath, and Pepper gives him the same soft smile. Exhaustion weighs heavy in her shoulders, dropping forward in another brief moment of rest.
“Neither do I.” Steve admits, nose wrinkling slightly. “It doesn’t, uh, really change anything, does it?”
The words don’t even make sense. He doesn’t know what Tony’s talking about, but he digs his hands into his chest, right where the arc reactor once was, and fucks down onto him harder, faster, milking Tony for everything he’s got because if it’s their last night on Earth, he’ll be damned if Tony doesn’t fill him full to the brim. He makes a dozen silent promises, and if he were still a religious man, Steve would pray.
. Tony tries repeating Pepper’s words to his cracked, chipped heart but it can’t hear him. Even in the
“Master Override L-R-2-5-5-8, Captain Rogers, Steven Grant. I know you have the footage, JARVIS. Show it to me. Now.”
But Tony was gone now, and Steve was left with this shell of a puppet, a mockery of the man that he loved from a distance for years.
The minute he crosses his arms over his chest he realizes he’s made a mistake. Steve’s eyes flicker down to Tony’s bare left hand before he holds his own out in front of them. The grey vibranium interwoven with threads of red and gold metal is incredibly loud against the pale skin of his hands. It screams at them both.
Tonight, it’s just Tony and Rhodey tucked into a booth in a dilapidated old diner a few blocks away from their hotel, grease running over their fingertips as they devour cheeseburgers in silence.
“But in that last one… what you’re looking for isn’t possible. There’s nothing you could say or do differently by then. The damage is already done. Even B.A.R.F. has its limitations, Cap.”
“You’re going to need to come pick up the paperwork. The Clerk’s Office needs ID and a signature, I wasn’t able to pick them up myself. Why don’t you come stay with us for a few days while you’re in town? I’m worried about you. We’re worried about you.”
Steve swallows. The realization that Steve might come out of this without Tony either way sets in, and he stares into the blank, dark circles of Tony’s eyes, searching for an answer.
They share deep, ragged breaths, air flowing between them as the inhales draw longer and the steady rhythm slows to rest. If Tony opens his eyes and looks down at his hands, he has no doubt that he’d find one of the cracked shards that’s been missing from their relationship since the beginning. It’s not perfect, it won’t ever be. For now, it’s good enough.
Steve’s apologized, more than once, and for more than just not telling Tony about his parents. No, he’s sorry for lying, hiding the truth for so long, not letting Tony in, blaming Tony when he shouldn’t have. Those are the things he said, which means he gets it. Genuinely, truly get it, and sees Tony for exactly as he is. Most of all, he listened, even when he might not have wanted to or liked what Tony was going to say.
“You’re not listening; that’s not how these things go,” Tony says, flapping the thick stack of papers in his face. He’s red-faced and angry, the hand not holding the Sokovia Accords package in a tight fist at his side.
“Morning boys.” Natasha put in, sitting down next to Steve with something that looks like pudding but was apparently ‘overnight oats’ that she let sit in the fridge and congeal.
FRIDAY had said he was going through a rapid fire of sequencing before getting stuck into a feedback loop. So, if all the memories were like this, somewhere, Steve was hitting a dead end. As long as the scenes keep switching, they were only repeating of memories that Steve had been successful in altering, be it enough to cope, or put it behind himself.
In the same breath, Strange tells Steve that the rest of the team is needed in Wakanda. The chances are high that that’s where the attack will take place and T’Challa and the Dora Milaje will need them. In minutes, Wong will be appearing in the living room to escort part of the team through, the rest to arrive by Quinjet as soon as possible.
Steve admits, drawing Tony in for a sweet, chaste kiss, before pulling him over to the sofa. He settles him down, one hand on his knee and meets his eye with an even gaze.
When he opens his eyes again, Tony is still there, concern etched into the flawed marble of his skin. “You were always so dense. Skull thicker than cement, I swear.”
They’d almost lost that. Steve had almost lost him, but now as he watches Tony across the shop, talking quietly with the owner, all Steve can focus on is the casual way he leans against the counter. When Tony smiles and turns on the charm, Steve’s stomach swoops all over again.
When Tony finally touches down on the platform that juts out from his Malibu mansion, Steve’s legs feel like putty, and he leans against the suit, an arm still slung around Tony’s metal neck.
They’d been more oblivious than he’d expected and he had relished every moment of it. There were remnants of guilt in the back of his mind for avoiding them so long, but he’d wanted time to savour this.
Tony leans back against the couch and runs a hand through his hair, ignoring the accusation and going in for the kill. “Prove me wrong. Sit down. Listen to me. I would love nothing more than for you to prove me wrong at least once. Or do you want to stand over there, glowering, ready to put your first through the wall or talk over me when you’re tired of listening to what I have to say? It’s not going to make a difference to me, Steve. Like you said. I already ‘walked away.’ There’s nothing stopping me from going right now.”
He was all ridiculous arrogance when he’d rolled his eyes and wrapped his hands around Steve’s cock, whispering, “Really, again? Can’t help yourself, can you Steve?”
Steve snaps the top of one, sitting high on his calves before he falls silent and slicks himself up. Tony is wet and dripping from where Steve has attacked him with his mouth and when he finally slides home, Tony shifts restlessly, groaning around the fist he’s shoved between his teeth.
“Oh yeah, I didn’t even need to ask. Go ahead and fuck my face, honey. Remind me exactly who I belong to.”
Tony is in the kitchen, humming under his breath. He’s learned to cook over the last few months, and he tosses little bits from the end of a broccoli stalk through the open window. It falls into the pen below, and against the setting sun, Steve can see Gerald’s plume of a head bobbing down to chase after the tiny morsels.
He yanks Steve upright, driving up into him as Steve shifts in his lap, trying to accommodate the new angle. The hand on his throat steals the air from his lungs and his chest burns. Tony wraps around him at every angle and his vision blurs at the edges.
“It is true! Tony, I know you.” Steve looks torn somewhere between furious and devastated and, well, they’ve always been two sides to the same coin, haven’t they?
“Tomorrow?” Tony’s willing to bargain. “Talk tomorrow, I promise. Promise, Steve, I swear. Come on, sweetheart, please. I just want to feel good, with you. I haven’t felt good in so long. After we can talk until, you’re sick of hearing my voice again. I promise.”
As if sharing silent instructions, Steve recaptured Tony’s mouth and shoved his boxers down to his knees, a second set of hands tugging them off at his ankles. Maybe he could ask them to do all the work, just lay there and bask in their attention, warm and slick, mind wiped blank with ecstasy.
He jerks back, eyes wide, because even in this century he knows you don’t lick your friend’s fingers. But then he catches the way Tony’s eyes darken. Tony takes a little, hitching breath and sways towards Steve like phantom hands on his shoulders are pushing Tony forward.
“Might, but this would also be comin’ from the genius that built DUM-E.” Steve tugged Bucky in, laughing, as the brunet readjusted in his arms and leaned back against him. “We should call ‘im later, tell him to get his ass home for dinner tonight. I feel like we’ve barely seen him at all this week. He was gone when I woke up this morning.”
For a second, Steve’s mind fumbles. Arguably, this isn’t good at all. Tony’s hand-to-hand combat skills are sorely lacking, and one of these days someone is going to catch him outside the suit and poorly prepared to defend himself. “I don’t think I’d go that far—”
Tony choked on a gasp, one of his hands flying up to cover his mouth. His eyes searched the fabric, taking in the fresh, cooling stains on the bed and he swayed forward slightly, eyes screwing closed as his face contorted into a grimace and the long lines of his throat swallowed again and again. “What did you do?” He asked, hoarse. “Steve, what did you do?”
If Tony wants him like this, pointy bones, deafened hearing, asthma and all, Steve can wait. He’ll wait because the rampant arousal throbbing between his legs feels more important than anything else and Tony may be tougher now, but he isn’t cruel.
That’s what the grief has been. A bed of nails that he’s been laid down over, pressed down, down, down until it pierces every inch of him. The wounds have healed over, but the nails shift and jab under his skin every time he moves.
“We want you, Buck. Both of us. Can we – do you want that too? Tony thinks you do, but I have to be sure. I need to know that you want this and that you know that we want this, not just for the physical stuff, but all of it.”
“It’s pathetic, I know.” Tony sighs and presses his lips together, trying to convey more than he has the energy to say.
“I’m tired, Tony. Too tired for this. If you think we can figure it out—if you think you can pull us through this, I’ll believe you.”
The tapping goes on for a painfully long time and when it stops and Tony hazards a glance at the door, Steve is sitting there, back pressed to the window panes with his head hanging in his hands.
“What’s this really about, dollface? You don’t need to fit some cookie cutter mold of what “Omega ' should be. And what’s so wrong with a fella showin’ his mates how happy they make him and givin’ ‘em such a thoughtful little gift?”
“Tony?” Steve calls out, panicked, whipping around to where he last saw his husband, his own armour protruding from his stomach when that bastard of a wizard had given up the stone.
He lets out a shaky breath and stills Steve’s wandering hand, pressing it firmly to the centre of his chest.
“Tony, fuck,” Steve pants into his mouth, hands flying to Tony’s belt and ripping it free. Before he can get to the zipper, Tony captures both of his thin wrists in one hand—have Tony’s hands always been so big?—and twists them over his head.
Bucky is awake, grinning at him and flexing the fingers of his new metal arm. He’s working on peeling away a tiny arc reactor sticker Tony has slapped on the shoulder, and when he finally gets the edges peeled back, there’s nothing underneath. No sigil or brand, just a beautiful, silvery prosthesis that Tony has spent weeks building from scratch.
Just the gentle touch, a light stroke of his fingers up and down Tony’s back, was enough for his body to stop struggling. Emboldened, Steve brought one knee to the mattress, half kneeling at Tony’s side and ran his other hand through Tony’s hair to brush it back from his face.
“Tell them about the big donut!” Natasha prompts from the table, smirking over the beer in her hand before taking a long pull from the mouth of the bottle.
Bucky hadn’t recognized him. He didn’t remember him, and he’d almost killed them both. Then… nothing.
“Don’t let go, Steve. No matter what, we’ll get them back together. Always together. You’re always saying that.” Tony laughs a little, short and sweet. “I don’t even remember when it started but I believe it now. Just don’t let me go, okay? Promise me you won’t let me go.”
“Sir, suit integrity 55%. Even with all additional power redirected to the thrusters, the chances of survival at this rate are—”
“You’re the most infuriating person I’ve ever met.” Steve gives him a firm shove backwards into the bedroom. Tony stumbles through a step then grins up at him as he draws in close again, magnetic and enticing. “And the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen.”
Steve pinked up prettily, the way he always did, and started to push Tony off his lap. An octopus, wriggling in Steve’s big arms, Tony refused to be dislodged and managed to curl in closer.
Rhodey takes one look at him, striding into the conference room for their first official ‘team’ meeting, and his jaw clenches.
They stand in the centre of the church until the storm in Steve’s chest passes. When he finally pulls away, Tony’s eyes are wet and red, and the kiss Tony plants on his lips is chaste but firm.
They haven’t had a trail on Bucky in weeks, and he wants to crawl out of his skin. Anticipation builds like a tsunami but doesn’t crest because every time they get close, every time someone gets a lead, Bucky outsmarts them. He’s amazing and horrific to track, leaving a trail of damage and dead HYDRA agents in his wake.
Rhodey is quiet for a long moment, eyes searching his face for something Tony doesn’t understand. He shifts uneasily in his chair. No one sees through him quite like James Rhodes.
“I love you, Tony. Fuck I love you so much. I’ve missed you. Sweetheart thank you, you’re perfect. My perfect omega. Beautiful, beautiful.”
“I’m not happy, either.” Okay, that’s one way to interpret that. “I think about you all the time. You know I remember everything, right? Too clearly. So clearly, it’s not fair. I can’t imagine you’d have any idea how much I want to forget what your mouth tasted like the first time I kissed you, and the way you felt when you were sleeping on my chest during movie night.” Steve balls his hands into fists at his sides and his eyes flicker between Tony’s face and over his shoulder, as if he can’t bear to look at him and speak the words at the same time.
“Yeah, I know what you were doing.” Bucky’s voice is a controlled growl, laced with disapproval that Steve isn’t prepared to face. Bucky must’ve seen some of it before he’d pulled him out but before he can think about what that means, the room changes.
They’ve always been explosive and sometimes it’s hard to tell where anger ends and lust begins. Maybe it’s always been one and the same.
, even a crack, Tony would have thrown it open wide. Probably wouldn’t have been able to help himself.
It dawns on Tony that this is the longest he’s been in Steve’s vicinity where Steve hasn’t tried to talk to him about them, order him around, or make amends. The burst of energy that runs through him makes him twitchy and his fingertips start to prickle with pins and needles.
And then Natasha, breathing air into his lungs and Tony thrown across his chest, a welcomed weight even as his body screamed for relief. Somehow, they’d both managed to make it out unscathed, half-frozen and half-drowned perhaps, but uninjured. Already on the way to recovery.
Yet Bucky holds back now, his only tell in the harsh grip he keeps on Steve’s arm. His fingers bite into Steve’s flesh but the hurt feels grounding. It forces Steve to acknowledge that this is real. Even when he looks away, Bucky is still there in front of him.
DUM-E doesn’t buy it, trundling over to him on his little wheels and trying to give him a sharp prod with his claw. Tony smacks him away with a hand, light, against his long strut where it meets the claw.
But Steve doesn’t apologize. He never apologizes, Tony has come to realize. The disappointment is just as sharp.
“You own it and I respond or I don’t, whatever your mind decides is enough. So, all the other memories change because the rational side of you already know that if you had done all those things, there would have been different results.”
He doesn’t want Steve to be unhappy, but something about Steve not trying to push him now feels foreign. A sliver of caution and hope catches in his gut and twists.
In a way, the new apartment felt almost clinical with it’s white walls and pale blue curtains, littered with his meager belongings. There were only a handful of items left over after the destruction of the Compound, but Steve didn’t need much.
“Is that why you walked away?” Steve counters, and his lack of understanding, his complete disregard for anything Tony is saying or has said, continues to astound him. “Is it? Damn it, Tony. Are you saying you walked out on our marriage because you think I’m like your
Morgan holds out another section, and Steve follows suit, slurping the edges of her fingers, sticky with fruit juice and basking in her joy. “Now you, Dad! Now you!”
“Give me a chance,” Steve says in a low voice as if one of the nurses in the hallway could hear and come rushing in to stop him. “I’m not saying that this is us working it out or reconciling, because it’s not. But give me a chance here, Tony. After everything that’s happened.”
It’s a trick Steve taught him years ago, and he lets his calf absorb the blow to avoid falling for the next rough twist. Tony growls in frustration when Steve holds fast, and for a moment they’re locked together and breathing hard. Tony’s little match for his strength and that only seems to make him flush redder. He’s shaking, digging his nails into Steve’s hands.
Steve hasn’t said much since they started out towards the Tower, so Tony hasn’t had anything to respond to and even if he wanted to say something, he’s not sure how or what or why. Instead, when the door clicks shut behind him Tony starts unknotting his tie and shrugs off his jacket in silence, nodding pointedly towards Steve to follow suit.
“You’re sorry?” Steve asks the question with slow precision, and looks at Tony like a spooked horse to be tamed. “Just like that?”
As he watches Tony sail through an intricate maneuver of dips and weaves, decimating the airborne aliens above, Steve focuses on the last remaining squadrons on the ground.
“Uh oh, you woke the beast.” Tony tipped his head back and smirked up at Bucky, a deep growl rumbling through the other man’s chest.
For some reason, it doesn’t feel as good as it normally does. When Steve’s had a chance to apologize, when they’ve half-ruined each other and left throbbing, purpling bruises on hips and shoulders, it feels like a salve to have earned Tony’s love. To know that he’s worked it, to know that it comes on the heels of something painful because everything between them has
, rushing in to scrub the hint of charred caramel from his nostrils. It didn’t click with Bucky’s muddled brain. How could this man continue to be so kind to him over and over again, after everything?
Steve claws back a whimper as Tony breaches him with a finger, pressing all the way in. “Is that what this is about? You want to get me back at me?”
of us don’t appreciate this much emotions-talk in the morning. Tony, you’re a doll and we love ya more than anythin’.” Bucky paused. “Stevie, shut your hole.”
Maybe if he asked real nice Steve would slide in there too. They’ve talked about it – his Alphas always saying it wasn’t safe, it was too much – but if he begged now, maybe they’d knot him together. Take him together. Bond together.
“Whoa, hey.” Tony puts a hand on his chest, propping himself up. Steve can just make him out through the darkness, but the rest of the room feels like it’s drawing in around them.
Happy averts his eyes and turns around, feigning an alert on his phone needs attention as he coughs and wipes at the corner of one eye. “Of course, Boss.”
Steve sucked at the gland on his throat, lapping and laving until Tony was squirming and closer to coming than he’d thought possible at this point in his life.
Tony gives her a hard look, wishing that he could read her mind and know if this is all true, or if she’s just playing another angle. Every fibre of his being wants to believe her, but he’s been burned so many times. It’s exhausting, these mind games, if that’s what this is.
“Maybe we could…” Steve tightens his grip around Tony’s waist and Tony stiffens because whatever Steve is going to say next is something that he’s afraid will set Tony off and maybe it will. Maybe it should.
“You seem to think you’re weak like this. Powerless. Why?” Tony purrs in his ear and Steve shudders. He feels like he’s floating away, reduced to the slick slide of Tony’s hand over his cock and the rush of blood in his ears.
Tony’s family has become Steve’s, not that he’s particularly surprised. Tony’s given him everything—a place, a purpose—and his friends have come to love Steve too. In the face of the lost, Steve finds a place that he fits as best he can.
Tony never gets to hear what Steve might have said, because the memory switches on them, fading to black and offering up something new.
Steve shakes his head but for some reason he realizes that’s a lie. It’s nothing he should remember, but he does, like someone’s stuck the memory into his brain and he’s seeing it through someone else’s eyes. He remembers the cold blackness of the water, but he also knows that Bucky pulled him free.
Tony jerks up, breathing hard. His eyes are unfocused, scanning the bed, then the room, then following the trail of Steve’s arm to his face. He’s white as a sheet and drenched in so much sweat the sheets are damp from where he was lying.
“I don’t want to hear any more excuses. He doesn’t get it, and a conversation like that won’t change anything.”
Steve’s eyes are blown black, but there’s something sad lingering around the corner of his mouth, a slight curve downward.
Tony throws the multitool across the room, relishing the way it shatters into a splay of attachments across the tile.
Bucky could hear Tony clear as day through the line. Damned super hearing. He’d made a move to shift away and Steve pinned him with a glare that made him pause.
Their bodies don’t touch at any other point and it feels so foreign, so unrealistic that Steve wants to scream. It’s not fair that Tony would treat him so kindly, with ginger fingers as if he’s afraid that too much might overwhelm him.
“Yeah, come on,” Tony rasps, waiting with his mouth cracked open. His tongue peeks out between swollen lips and laps at the head of Steve’s cock as he strips his length, jerking off with a furious determination to come all over Tony’s face.
It’s so strange, hearing Steve ramble. Always so self-assured and confident. The man with a plan, every word that leaves his mouth selected with intention and precision. Steve looks more exhausted than ever.
The assassin had settled back into the couch without a sound, eyes focused on Steve’s hot face. He took a long, smug drink of his coffee when Steve stayed silent.
How, after all this time, could Tony still think he was so worthless? So inconsequential that the only thing that mattered was the products of his labour. What did that mean for all the tender moments, the whispered promises? The plans they had for the future.
“Bullshit. What aren’t you saying? What—” Tony cuts himself off, and his face spasms with realization but he steels himself and pushes on. “What are you hiding? Why are you hiding something from me?”
Steve feels himself colour, and he glances down before he meets Bucky head on. “Anytime now. We’ve… been waiting.” Bucky’s eyebrows shoot up and Steve huffs, nudging him with a shoulder. “Well, I couldn’t go off and get married without my best man, now could I?”
Steve all but growls as he drives into him at a brutal pace, cock threatening to split Tony in two and Tony scrambles against the window, trying to get a grip or some form of leverage to push back to meet Steve’s thrusts. He can’t, it’s thrilling.
“A whole life,” Steve mutters against his skin. “Kids and grandkids. I’m going to grow old with you.”
Seeing Steve before serving him with the papers is out of the question. No question about it at all. All Steve will have to do is look at him with those desperate blue eyes and that fucking disastrously sexy beard and Tony will forgive him.
“You think this is funny?” She demands. Tony’s eyes go comically wide, and he looks at Steve for some form of back up. Steve just shakes his head; Tony’s gone and done it this time.
“It’ll take.” Steve assured him, leaning in to steal kisses from Bucky’s slicked mouth and moaning at the taste.
“I just… I don’t understand why you even thought you should send it in the first place. I think I deserved better than that.”
In moments, he’d be underwater. The Avalon Protocol might be enough to get Steve to safety either way, but if he could just hold out a few moments longer—
A shadow that should dissolve with the night, but Tony’s had to reinstate to the arc reactor, his heart not quite strong enough to withstand a biting curve of vibranium. Now there’s always just enough light to keep the shadow alive and well-fed.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Sure buddy, I’ll bring it all down to the shop for you later. Now get out of here, you spoiled heap of junk.” The robot swivelled at him again, fondness obvious in the little swirls, and rolled towards the elevator. “Yeah, yeah, happy birthday, kid.”
“Bonding and breeding,” Steve pitched forward and wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, leaning over Bucky to tip his head up and capture Tony’s mouth. “Oh, sweetheart.”
Something slowly relaxes in Tony’s shoulders and he tugs Steve in close again. “You’re taking this remarkably well. No panic? Wait, what exactly did you think was happening this whole time?”
The whole experience was amazing. Enlightening, even, and it had set the precedent for dozens of nights after where Steve lost himself entirely, greedy in his pleasure as he chased away Tony’s nightmares and kept him safe from his own subconscious.
So, when Tony had come striding into the Tower earlier today, exuding a confidence he didn’t feel only a month after he’d last been in New York, it had shocked him to find Steve and Barnes at odds. Barnes, in the middle of telling Steve to back off and that he hadn’t agreed to this, wasn’t
Tony collects the pieces of his resolve and shoves them into place. “This did not mean more to you than it did to me. And you’re an asshole for saying it.”
But he also knows that Bucky’s had his back in more ways than one already, and it’s the least he can do, really.
His little love-sick fantasy that tasted like marinara and fresh basil felt like it was going up in smoke.
was sent to honeypot me so I stand by that initial reaction,” Tony leans back in the chair and crosses his legs at the ankle, flicking a smirk in Natasha’s direction. “Plus, I still want one.”
“Right. Cake then.” Steve physically held back his eye roll. “But like, if you had to pick a favourite meal. Something that isn’t dessert or made of pure sugar.”
“I’m fine,” Tony had said, pushing Natasha away as she tried to tend to him next. There was no medic on board the ship, and it was nothing short of a miracle that Steve could hold Tony in his arms, overcome with panic as Tony shivered through massive tremors.
“I love you. Jesus Christ, I love you so much and I’m going to kill you. Tomorrow. After you warm me up and feed me soup. Or maybe I’ll warm you up. Either way, tomorrow, I’m going to kill you.” Every word was a knife in his raw throat but Tony couldn’t stop, the whispered words of
“It can’t be wrong.” Bucky would mutter, buried to the hilt in Steve’s body, hands sweaty on his hips and back, simultaneously propping him up as he shoved him down onto the thin mattress. “Nothin’ this good could be wrong. Nothin’ wrong about you, Stevie.”
Steve eyes him carefully as he continues, but doesn’t rise to the challenge. He’s perfectly professional, not a hair out of place.
The entire ordeal had left him with the same empty, hollow feeling; as if someone had dug out everything inside of him that once held meaning and left him a gutted frame of the man he’d been before. That’s what Steve was now. Empty and alone.
Like the lights against the skyline from the Tower’s penthouse windows, Tony is an intricate magnificence and the pieces of the suit fusing into place sends thrills through Steve every time.
Steve curled deeper into the edge of the oversized sofa, feet between two cushions with his sketchbook balanced on his lap. Bucky was within arms-reach, fingers wrapped around one of his ankles, taking in the morning news and stroking his thumb in slow circles.
Steve thinks about Bucky, his eyes shining bright as he stood by Steve’s side and watched them promise to love each other for the rest of their days.
“You’re on.” Peter shoves a hand at Sam first, then Clint, and Tony’s just sitting there rolling his eyes.
It’s hard to decide whether or not that’s Steve’s perfect fantasy ending, or something Tony might really do and at this point, Tony has no idea. Bitterness has coloured these memories too severely in his own mind and reality now seems to give way to a shield in his chest and his arms wrapped around the Winter Soldier’s throat.
Tony could kick his own ass. This is Peter. He’ll always make something work for Peter and not just because he owes him one—more than one.
Steve makes a valiant attempt to keep up, sliding his tongue into Tony’s mouth but Tony forces him back. Tilting his head up with both hands in his hair, he yanks hard and the throaty moan that rips from Steve’s throat bolts straight to his cock.
It did come as a surprise though when the Rogues had been invited, albeit underneath a shaky veil of amnesty, to partake in the deliberations about Amendments. The first day had been a lengthy talk of the consequences being reduced or done away with and the Avengers coming together as a whole again.
Tony had always refused sleeping pills in the past, explaining that they held him captive in his night terrors, making it harder and harder to swim towards consciousness. And, even after he’d woken, the lingering haze of the sedatives made it difficult to discern whether he was truly awake.
“Absolutely, Captain. This particular meal holds something of a sentimental value for Mr. Stark. His childhood butler, Mr. Jarvis, made this meal for him often when he was young.” AI JARVIS explained.
This morning had been all about Steve, Tony taking him apart slow and easy with his hands and his mouth, whispering sweet nothings into his ear and easing Steve into orgasms that started to layer over each other until Steve was a whimpering, sobbing mess.
Bucky saunters over behind Steve’s seat, and gives him a whack to the back of the head, hard enough that Tony thinks it should hurt, but Steve doesn’t even flinch.
Steve flips them over, bucking his hips to tumble Tony sideways and he sinks back down before Tony can catch a breath. With a hand splayed over his chest, Steve can gaze into the depth of those eyes and know what it’s like to come home.
This is right. This is where Tony’s meant to be. This is exactly where he belongs. He pushes everything else away, if only for a few moments.
Tony stays long enough that he lives to regret it. A part of him wonders if this was what he was waiting for after all. Tony is a weak man.
“To be honest, I’m surprised you’ve held it together as well as you have,” Rhodey admits and that… well, that actually throws him a little bit.
Tony shoots him a smirk. “You’re so uptight, Steve. Live a little. Are you not enjoying your vacation?”
Forever two steps forward, Steve takes one step back. Sometimes he doesn’t take any steps, he just vents and blames. When he justifies it makes Tony’s chest ache, every word a tiny shield to the arc reactor. But for the most part, Tony learns that over the last year Steve has gone through something of a self-discovery.
The Compound stands in the distance, glowing against the low dip of the afternoon sun. When they’d started the planning, Steve had suggested they hold the ceremony down by the river for the quiet. The soft wind and the gentle lapping of water; an atmosphere he knew Tony loved. It had surprised him when Tony had suggested an arch against the treeline.
The moment that his lips touch Steve’s, his whole body lights up like fireworks in the night sky. If anything, he deserves a medal for the whole five seconds he holds back before he’s crawling into Steve’s lap, thighs on either side of Steve’s hips. Tony gets his hands in his hair, stroking his face, cupping his chin. Any part of Steve that he can get his hands on, really.
Steve sets the drawing aside, half finished, and in a few short steps he’s in Tony’s arms. When Tony kisses him, it tastes like the peanut sauce next to the stove.
They talk openly when they can, and ask for more silence when it’s too much. Steve listens and respects him, even when Tony’s angry. Even when he tests him again, this time in front of the team, because Tony’s not perfect either.
“You’ve been down here before,” Bucky cuts him off. “Don’t try to tell me this is the first time—we don’t do that with each other. I really thought this was helping you, at first, but this isn’t right. It’s not healthy.”
“Tony,” Steve groans low in the back of his throat and suddenly there’s a sharp, prodding tongue between his cheeks, lapping at his entrance and shoving inside the tight ring of muscles.
“You mean—you’re talking about us?” Steve asks, careful and slow, but his heartbeat is picking up speed in his chest. His fingers flex at Tony’s hips, holding him in place astride him. “
For the briefest of moments, he wishes the end of days could hurry along so he can move on to whatever comes next. Whatever that might be. Anything except this limbo where everything hurts and nothing makes sense.
Tony goes to shove him, again and Steve catches his arms easily, tugging him in. “I’m sorry. Tony, please listen to me. I’m so sorry.”
“Then why don’t you?” Steve snaps, jaw clacking like a rabid dog even as his entire body rejects what he's said, stepping between Tony and the doorway in an unconscious movement, maybe, blocking Tony’s exit even as he pushes him to go.
“I want you to be mine.” He mouthed along Bucky’s strong jaw and felt Bucky’s hips twitch up towards him. The faint smell of bitter, dark chocolate nudged at the edges of his senses. Steve’s excitement, all eagerness and crackling lust. “Both of you, my Alphas. I’d be yours, and you’d belong to each other.”
“We’ll be there, then.” As he handed the phone back towards a gaping Steve, the line clicked and went dead. “What?”
It feels too good to be true but Tony would be betraying the deepest part of himself if he didn’t have one ear cocked, waiting for the other shoe to fall. For now, he stays.
None of this has ever been about Barnes. Steve just chooses not to believe it. How can he? When abandoning that train of thought would force Steve to face the realities of his trespasses against him.
Tony might have felt exposed, belly up, head thrown back revealing the swelling gland at his neck, but he couldn’t feel anything more than desperate, heady desire.
Did Steve even consider what those vows meant when he’d made them? They’re only pretty words now, scattered like rose petals in the frozen waste of Siberia.
“Ain’t that a pretty sight. Pretty, perfect little Omega,” Bucky cooed at his ear, pressing open-mouthed kisses along his throat.
“Of course I know that!” Tony balls his hands into fists and feels cold sweat break out across the back of his neck. “It doesn’t matter—”
He took stumbling steps backwards, putting as much distance between himself and the bed as possible. It seemed that might be the only thing he could give Tony now.
“The second it’s over.” Steve stumbles into his clothes without his usual perfunctory grace. “I promise, we’re going to sort it all out.”
They’d waited too long; Tony’s thoughts were frantic and the bond he left untouched in the back of his mind throbbed and sparked with a hope that startled him. It was rare for him to still feel Steve, sharp and present in the dark recess of his mind.
“Then stay,” Steve brushes his lips across Tony’s throat then tips his head to the side so he can capture his mouth. They stay like that for minutes that feel like hours, losing themselves in each other, until Tony can’t stand it anymore. Lifting one of Steve’s legs at the knee and hiking it higher, he angles down and thrusts harder, with purpose.
Tony scrambles onto Steve’s lap and wraps his thighs around him. He wraps his arms around his neck and holds him fast.
Steve sighs, the exhale through his nose too loud and broken across the crappy connection. He’s probably pinching the bridge of it, closing his eyes, exasperated with Tony like usual.
He drops his head back to the futon and thinks about the irony of it all. Guess he needs to start looking for a new place to call home all over again.
A full-body shudder runs through Steve, then suddenly the hand holding him down is wrapped around his throat, pulling him back so Steve can seal their mouths together in a kiss Tony can feel in his bones. For a moment, Steve’s grip cuts off his oxygen supply and the arousal in Tony’s gut winds impossibly tighter, balls drawing up against his body with the rush towards his climax and he files that one away for later.
“I’m not. Christ, Tony, how can you even think I’d—” The rest of his sentence gets lost when Tony grinds up against him and it’s all he can do not to whine. He’d forgotten how sensitive this body was, how it laps up physical contact and comes alive with desire.
There had never been any pressure intended. Tony and Steve had talked at length before they’d initially bonded that things like nesting and breeding weren’t in the cards; Tony having no instinct and being past the age to have or want children anyhow.
“I didn’t even figure it out on my own, not really. It wasn’t long before you called that I actually started to see things differently. I watched how close Bucky and T’Challa got, after he came out of cryo and I was so bitter. How could two people with so much hurt and anger between them manage to set things aside, and my own–my…”
“Tony,” Steve starts again, hard and firm as if he’s prepared to say what he has to for this to end but Tony ignores him. Steve can make his own bed and lie in it.
On the first day upstate, Tony hangs the picture of himself and Peter with Peter’s internship award above the kitchen sink and stares at it while he washes the dishes. He doesn’t speak to Steve. He hardly looks at him at all.
Everything that came after he’d let go of Tony’s hand in the sky was a blur, nothing more than a series of flashes pieced together against the backdrop of the night sky. A streak of red and gold chasing him down, his back searing with pain as he hit the water. The familiar fear of being trapped under the ice as water flooded into his lungs once more.
Steve sat by the window, watching the dancing shadows of the trees in the courtyard with his chin resting in the palm of his hand. It was late into autumn now, and the leaves were falling rapidly. Any day the first snowfall would set it and plunge New York into winter.
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Steve flinch and Tony’s jaw clenches. Don’t look at him. He’s not worth it and he’ll see right through you, idiot.
“You’re losin’ it, Steve. You’re supposed to be the sane one of the two of us, but you’re—this stuff ain’t real. You’re living in a fantasy down here and that’s only going to end in more hurt.”
Bucky rolled his eyes, the sucker, and pushed off the couch to refill their mugs. “Coulda just asked, Stevie.”
Tony’s face is pale and streaked with blood, head limp against the back of the suit where it cradles him so gently amidst the sheer violence of the scene. His eyes are open, staring unfixed beyond Steve’s shoulder so Steve reaches over with trembling fingers and gently shuts them, trailing his index finger down to run along the set curve of Tony’s mouth. His beautiful, perfect mouth.
Steve presented him with his own gland and gave a sharp grunt when Tony bit down, too hard. Tony wanted it to hurt, he thought viciously, chasing his pleasure. Wanted Steve to understand what this meant after all they’d been through.
Sometimes, the way Steve clings to him even in sleep makes him worry. Steve hides it well enough, but there’s something deeper hiding just beneath the surface; something that scars Steve in a way he hasn’t been willing to admit.
Tony reaches across the small space between them and lays a hand over his. It feels like safety and home and everything that Steve’s ever dreamed of having. The warmth of his hand and the roughness of his calluses are familiar and welcomed. “It’s real,” Tony says. “Steve, it’s everything.”
“Fine, then take mine off instead.” He gives Steve a cheeky wink and together they get Tony out of his pants, shoving them down around his ankles so Steve can cup him through the thin fabric of his underwear. The underwear isn’t long for this world though, and Steve shoves them down after his pants before he scoots to the edge of the bed and settles one hand on Tony’s hip and wraps the other around the base of his cock, brushing the tip with his lips. Tony gasps and tries not to close his eyes because Steve is looking up at him, mouth parted and teasing along his cockhead, a cheeky look on his face that drives Tony wild.
And there wasn’t a single mark on him, the prick. Not that Tony hadn’t given it the old college try, biting down hard enough to make Steve grunt and squirm.
Steve just watches him: the graceful arcs he makes through the air as he talks with his hands, the way the fine lines around his eyes, appearing more and more each day, crinkle when he considers what type of suit might fit his fighting style best.
“I know. Shh, okay. It doesn’t matter.” Of course, it matters. It will always matter. But what’s the point?
“He can take care of himself.” The words come out harsh and biting. Why can’t he just be fucking normal for one goddamn minute. Not everything has to be a fight, Stark.
Strange, what Barnes has come to understand in such a short time while Steve continues to lay his hands over his eyes and claim that he’s blind. And how ironic it would be, if that’s what it takes. Steve’s good old buddy from the past, the driving force of change when Tony has been there all along.
And just like Maria, Tony had found his Howard and let that be his world for years. The thought is black and ugly, something heinous he shouldn’t be considering but the resemblance is startlingly familiar. The way that Steve never says he’s sorry, never apologies. The way that he thinks he’s better than Tony, than almost anyone, and one day everyone is going to wake up and realize he’s right, then thank him for it.
“No, Pepper, I’m not okay. My husband destroyed our marriage and I’m here all alone trying to put the pieces back together without drinking or offing myself. Stop asking me if I’m okay.” He flicks at crumbs on the futon.
“An apology must go a long way with you, huh Stark?” Bucky drawls with a put-upon leer as Tony shuffles closer to the coffee machine and wills himself not to flush.
It’s a small thing to be bitter over, but when Tony had made his vows, he had meant them for life. With a fine-tooth comb, he had selected every word, handpicked each one for Steve with purpose and precision.
Everything swells around him and Steve’s vision blurs with tears again. The hand on his mouth slips down and Steve gasps in air before it’s back with Tony shoving two fingers into Steve’s mouth.
“I think hamburgers and hotdogs are more appropriate for the Fourth of July, wouldn’t you say?” Natasha suggested, helping herself to another samosa and tearing it delicately between thin fingers.
“Wow.” Tony gives a slow shake of his head. “That’s… okay. You said you wanted to talk, let’s talk. I’m not going to fight with you tonight. I just won’t, okay? So you can cut it with the passive-aggressive waspy bullshit, Cap.”
Steve laid a warm hand on his back over the blanket, and oh, he could just arch into that hand and let himself fall to pieces.
Tony remembered crawling into his bed, stretching out beside the old man, and taking turns reading pages as Tony stumbled over words and argued that his turn always came too soon. Jarvis’ lilting voice always seemed to stitch the story together, effortless and smooth as butter.
Tony was always so pushy about clean-up, claiming that he was shy and didn’t want anyone to walk in. It had happened before and the reactions had been… unsavoury and judgemental. No one ever understood.
Steve gasped into his shoulder and damn, Tony wanted to watch as Bucky prepped him with Tony’s own slick. He loved watching his big, strong Alpha give over, let himself have this beautiful pleasure without restraint.
“We don’t do this. But. I just, I have to tell you. And if we get a chance to figure it all out later, I’ll still feel the same–this isn’t a goodbye thing, except maybe it kind of is–God, I hope you can hear me. Can you hear me, honey?”
“Come on, sailor, let’s find a bunk and you can take your time warming me up,” Tony teased, his shaky voice a far cry from his usual lecherous humour as he dug his elbow into Steve’s side. It startled a laugh out of Steve all the same.
Tony groaned, whimpered as a light smack of redirection landed on his ass. It was hot, despite the cool metal of Bucky’s fingers.
One of Tony’s hands rubs circles into his back, smoothing over the creases and lines in the back of his suit. He must be staining Tony’s jacket, ruining the expensive fabric, but Tony doesn’t seem to mind. His hand stays, drifting through small patterns, rhythmic and smooth.
Tony held Steve’s wrist in a tight grip with the gauntlet, the other hand stretched out behind him, keeping them alight and he had nothing to fight Steve off with, nothing he could use to stop him. He could only watch, with abject horror, when Steve reached up and squeezed the fingers of the gauntlet with his own, looking into the Iron Man faceplate with a bittersweet smile.
When they’d first arrived in Washington for a week-long session on a series of Amendments being proposed to the Sokovia Accords, dinner had been a loud and obnoxious event. The current Avengers piled in around the table, tempers spitting, emotions rising and cresting like tsunamis as they reviewed the days’ proceedings.
the way that he needed. Then bringing down the gavel and reinstating his rule into law all over again.
Rhodey huffs a laugh. “No, but I can make you some breakfast and hang around for a bit if you want. We could watch the highlights from last night’s game?”
“Steve?” Bucky gave him a hesitant look. He hadn’t felt this uncertain in a lifetime. The memory of a skinny, bony little Alpha, arms wrapped around his waist, swam behind his eyes.
hair, when Steve and Rhodey are unavailable and Tony is lacking for human connection. Sometimes, Steve thinks that she enjoys it just as much as Tony does and he can’t blame her. Tony’s hair is so soft, slipping through his fingers and sliding against his palm like little trickles of silk.
“You’ve already said none of us are.” He feels his body sagging under the weight of it all, adrenaline draining out through the bottom of his feet and leaving him without any real desire to push her. He’s tired. So damned tired. “I don’t know what you want me to say. We can’t just forget it happened. There’s no going back from this.”
Tony traces his fingers over Steve’s throat, stroking the bruises forming there. His lips press together until a line of white appears at the purse and Steve doesn’t move, doesn’t dare touch him.
The look Steve gives him is not unlike the look he gives his battle plans and strategies, eyes working Tony over as if he’s a map into a Hydra base with a special tactic locked somewhere within his skin. It’s all Captain America, cool and composed as ever.
Peeling back the blankets, Tony let Bucky wrap an arm around his waist, hauling him closer until Bucky was pressing his mouth flush against the nape of his neck, treating him to little pecks and flicks of his tongue.
It felt so, deliriously good, Steve wanted to sob. He wanted Tony’s hands on him, body pressed along his from feet to shoulders. He
Bucky dove in like it was his job, spread out flat on his stomach and parted Tony’s cheeks with his thumbs. He licked deep, spearing inside with a pointed, firm tongue until Tony was writhing and gasping, trying to thrust up against that sinful mouth. Steve kept him pinned down at the hip, the restraint sending a sear of pleasure curling low in his stomach.
Pitching forward, Tony lets himself be caught, Steve’s mouth hot and wet against his own as he works Steve harder now. Sharp drags of his hips grind them together faster until Steve is groaning and gripping so tight, he’s on his way to replenishing the fading bruises on Tony’s hips.
He bites back a sigh, because every other time it’s been Steve trying to talk or ask him something he doesn’t want to answer, or even criticize him. He’s just… tired of it all.
Steve comes with a shout, threading his fingers through Tony’s to hold him as close as he can. For that brief moment, they’re one again. Steve’s whole and nothing hurts.
Two orgasms later, Steve floated restlessly in his own thoughts, tethered by Bucky’s heavy weight on his chest where he was snoring. Warm breath swirled over his chest, Bucky scenting peace and ease, even in his dreams, relaxing Steve’s own nerves.
“You’ll be able to figure it out when we get there.” Bucky had told him. “Never met an O – anyone – that’d do something like that if there weren’t still feelings there. He loves you, Steve. You got some real grovelling to do, but he loves you.”
In the middle of the night, Tony wakes feeling sated and deliciously warm. He buries closer to Steve’s heat, pressing his face into the hard lines of his chest and curling his arm tighter around his trim waist. Steve’s breathing is too shallow and for a second, Tony almost let’s himself drift back to sleep, but Steve starts tracing patterns on his skin and he forces his eyes open.
“I didn’t mean to make anything worse. I swear, Mr. Stark. I just wanted–you’re always looking out for everyone else and I just–I wanted to make sure you knew that I had your back. After King T’Challa brought you back…” Peter chokes off as the air sticks in his lungs. “I don’t ever want to see you like that again.”
He should, because people don’t change. Not really. Maybe in small, subtle ways, but not in the monumental, sea-parting ways that Steve would need to change and yet here he is, wearing his heart on his sleeve. Here Tony is, the weak man now with the weaker, broken body to match, prepared to let his husband hurt him again.
Groaning long and low in the back of his throat, Steve let his head drop back, jerking Tony at the hips to meet one last sharp thrust as the orgasm washed away.
Clint’s face is dissolving into a grin, and Bruce is peering over his glasses with humour in his eyes. Thor looks about ready to tackle them both to the ground, vibrating halfway out of his civilian clothing.
The Hobbit had become one of his favourites, and he had fallen in love with Tolkien as a young man, well into his adulthood. What he hadn’t anticipated, however, was this strong identification with one very particular, scaly character.
It wasn’t that Steve hadn’t realized before now, but it felt right. The last week had brought clarity and solidified something Steve had already known was there all along. Maybe it was supposed to be private, or romantic, or any other way than what he’d just done now, but it felt right.
The shop owner’s face morphs into a look of mild irritation when Tony inevitably places another massive order. But then he nods and steps behind the counter to get to work. A younger woman approaches with a plastic container, pushing it towards Tony, and he thanks her with one of those dazzling smiles.
Steve’s going to kiss him and Tony thinks he might let him. Every inch of his body explodes with anticipation and maybe this time it won’t hurt so much, because he’s seen glimpses tonight, of the Steve he’s been waiting for. He’s under there, somewhere, and Tony wonders if maybe he could draw it out in other ways.
It should enrage him, but maybe it’s not so horrible to have the power taken out of his hands. He can bear this if Tony wants him to, if he needs him to.
Tony has been on incredibly shaky ground after the incident at the Raft. It’s not a far cry to picture himself in one of those cells. Life is so surreal these days it’s not hard to imagine that this is all a delusion and somewhere, he’s rocking back and forth in a straightjacket.
Steve plants his feet and drives Tony forward on his chest, taking over and dragging him back onto his cock. Tony moans, low and long, boneless in the face of Steve’s strength.
Steve doesn’t remember how they ended up here, his head cradled in Tony’s lap with Tony’s fingers threaded through his sweaty hair. His stomach rumbles and it’s impossible to say how much time has passed since Tony finally let him come.
Tony’s back bows and he groans, bucking up underneath him, hips slotting into place as he squeezes his eyes shut and comes. Steve can’t stop staring at him.
Worse, he has absolutely no idea how much or how little Steve and Barnes have shared with the rest of them, and if they haven’t said anything, he sure as he isn’t going to. There’s no sure-fire way to know what they’re thinking; if they know.
.” Tony licks his lips and swallows hard, tugging on the back of Steve’s hair until he gets with the picture and bursts into motion, throwing the blankets off and tugging Tony’s boxers down as he goes so his prick slaps back against his stomach with an obscene smack.
Peter seems to accept it, and as Tony leads him back out of the workshop and up to the communal floor, FRIDAY notifies them that the food has just arrived and the team is assembling for dinner. Pete rambles on about new features he’s been thinking up for his suit and Tony promises to add them all.
“Come on, fuck me.” Tony’s gasping and clenching down, pulling out all the stops to just get Steve to fuck him the way he needs to be fucked. If Steve will just fuck him until he’s crying and aching, it’ll be worth it. “You fucking bastard, come on.”
Rhodey is a little harder to shake, but when Tony eventually promises to call him in the morning, and asks him to take care of the arrangements for when Rogers and his team arrive, it seems to pacify him. Admitting he doesn’t have the energy for any of this earns him a gentle, supportive response. It’s not Tony’s fault that Rhodey assumes he’s going to be getting an early night.
“I think perhaps we’ll end here for today.” The chairwoman, a Frenchwoman with a balanced energy that unsettles Tony, interrupts with a sharp pound of her gavel, “we’ll reconvene at nine o’clock tomorrow morning.”
They haven’t gotten to Siberia. Tony’s terrified of what will happen when they do. But he learns so much about Steve and sees things that make him wonder who took sanding paper to the sharp corners of Steve’s self, polishing him into something even more beautiful; a rose without so many thorns.
Running his hand through his lanky, too long hair, Bucky refocused his attention on the weights next to his bench. It wasn’t as much that he needed to lift weights so much as he enjoyed the structure and repetition. Each movement, controlled and dictated by a schedule long pressed into his brain.
“He’s jealous. And it’s hot.” Tony gave his Alphas a flat look. “I just wasn’t expecting this. When have I ever done anything like this? Seriously? Tell me. I feel like… some fifties housewife. Dress me up in some hosiery and I could basically be playing house for my big, strong Alphas. Maybe I should start cooking your dinner, too.”
?! Come on man, don’t start with that.” Rhodey’s exasperation makes him smirk from where he’s looking down at Sam’s flight pack.
“And what about you?” Steve says, tone rising as a flush of angry heat rushing into his cheeks. “What about you? You’re blameless in all of this, right?”
“Steve I–” Steve covers his mouth lightly with his palm to still him and then replaces it with a short, chaste kiss.
“We’re through.” Tony interrupts, scathing. “So, here’s what this is going to look like. The pardons give you full immunity from anything that’s happened leading up to this point. You’ll have your regular rooms back at the Compound, with near similar access to the building and its amenities. Rhodey has been heading up the team here, so at least for the foreseeable future you can expect to co-lead the team with him. You can do whatever you like, really, so I want to be crystal clear about this, Rogers. Outside of anything strictly necessary for saving the world, you don’t speak to me. I don’t speak to you. We’re through. It’s that simple.”
“I’m going to go,” Rhodey fires off a quick response and huffs a breath, his lips tightening into a firm, almost sad line. He looks tired enough to sleep for a week, but still, the tactician in him is preparing. If all goes well and as planned, the Rogues will be pardoned and the team will need to be a
“I did, too. I mean, I felt the same way–back then, when you said, uh, what you said.” Swallowing hard, Tony ducked his head, avoiding Steve’s eyes.
“I’m not trying to prank him.” Steve grumbled miserably. “If anything, I’m trying to do literally the exact opposite.”
Tony moves like water, flowing around him, going easily when Steve lifts him onto the counter and steps between his legs. His thighs grip like a vice, tugging Steve to him with heels pressed tight into his ass and digging in until Steve can feel Tony, half hard in his jeans, rolling up against him.
Steve pats a hand on his shoulder as Tony touches down beside them, a gauntlet settling on the other. “Nice work, Peter.”
Tony huffs, bucking his hips in a delicious little slide that catches Steve off guard. He lets the motion tip him sideways, and Tony crawls on top of him, perched with his thighs bracketing his chest and rolling his eyes.
Rhodey sighs, stepping into his space and clicking a button on the base of the flight pack that causes the wings to snap back into the base, almost taking off one of Tony’s fingers in the process.
The following morning, he almost runs smack into Steve on his way out the door to an SI meeting. Almost instinctually, Steve reaches towards him to steady him with a hand on his elbow and Tony jumps back, heart in his throat. He wills his breathing to settle, because he’s been working on this, really, he has.
Tony perches beside him, settling on the edge of the cushions with concern lingering in his features until the coughing stops. Eventually, he continues, “You can be anything here. I thought you would have figured that out already. So, what’ll it be? Depression beard Cap? Motorcycle Cap? Phil-Coulson’s-Wet-Dream Cap?”
He had worked so hard, and made it through so much, without a single drop. Everyone else was allowed to make mistakes. Hell, she’d followed a man that had beaten the shit out of him without blinking an eye, but
Steve drops to his knees with a sharp crack against the floorboards, bits of straw poking in through his jeans. Tony’s hands are in his hair at the same time Steve reaches for his belt, tearing it open and shoving his pants halfway down his thighs.
The streak of electric colours darts up Tony’s arm and onto his shoulder. The side of his face is alight and on fire. His eyes burn brighter still and when he meets Steve’s eyes, they’re terrified and wild. It’s as if he already knows he’s staring down the barrel and he’s ready to die.
Tony will beg him if he has to. Maybe if Steve forgives him, it’ll help. He’ll feel better because at least he’ll still have Steve and he won’t be completely alone. It’s more than he deserves.
“Me? Why do I have to make this so difficult?” Oh, there he goes, his voice is jumping up a few octaves and the discomfort in his chest is slowly building into throbbing agony.
“Uh, closure?” Tony offers and Rhodey cuffs him on the back of the head before he slings an arm around his shoulders and tugs him into a hug.
He kisses Steve with everything. Everything that he hasn’t said for months. All the love and heartache Tony’s been trying to live with; trying to drown in booze and projects that barely make a dent in easing the storm of emotion inside him. Compared to this, they seem like fruitless endeavours now because he’s only ever been able to quiet the storm with Steve’s hands on him, his mouth sealed to his own.
DUM-E rolled towards Steve, knocking the edge of his chair as he rotated his claw into his lap, like a dog waiting for scratches.
Steve’s voice was almost lost over the howling of the wind as the Iron Man suit stuttered and faltered in the sky, a hesitant rocket barreling towards a shoreline lost somewhere on the murky horizon.
. If Tony’s trying to convince himself that he wouldn’t re-marry this man in a heartbeat—if Steve would just—
“Let’s go.” Steve’s in his space, nodding towards the side of the stage and Tony gives him a cold look, falling into step beside him.
“Harder.” Steve’s heels press into the small of Tony’s back as his nails dig into soft, malleable skin until Steve’s sure he’ll leave marks. “Tony please—
“Then what’s it about, damn it? Can’t you just be honest for once in your goddamn life.” It takes everything in him not to cross the space between them and shove him back. At that moment, he wants to hurt him, which isn’t fair. None of this is fair.
“Yeah, okay buddy, I got it, thanks. Jesus Christ,” Tony ran a shaky hand through his hair, wondering when this became his life. “A brainwashed Soviet assassin’s looking in our window and rubbing one out. That’s a little bit fucked up, even for me.” But even as he says it aloud, something tightens in his belly and a bolt of lust beelines down between his legs.
They’d told him Captain America wouldn’t age, that Steve would be trapped in a cage of his own making while his loved ones grew old and died around him. Something about his journey into the past had changed everything. He hadn’t been prepared to step out of the portal and be an old man, but an odd sense of relief had followed soon after.
“This is different,” Tony shakes his head, using his good hand to lift Steve’s chin when he breaks eye contact and fixes on a spot over Tony’s shoulder. Steve must be feeling equally uncertain, and as much as Tony would prefer to forget, he remembers the look on Steve’s face too. The way that Steve had sobbed into his chest and loved him anyway. “Listen to me.” Steve meets his eye. “I know how I feel and I know what I want. And I want you. Now. Whatever you want to give me. So do you trust me? Because the only reason you should be saying no right now is because you don’t want to, not because you think you know better than I do.”
“Never seen anything like you, Steve.” Tony’s hands are on his hips, roughly pulling him forward then guiding him back. “Never thought you’d—
When they finally separated again, they were breathing hard and there were effectively fewer thoughts - and a significantly less amount of blood - in Steve’s head than the first time.
Tony bites back a moan and fists a hand against his forehead, shoving back onto Steve’s fingers when he adds one, then a second and spreads him to wiggle the tip of his tongue between them. He’s already loosening up, his hole neglected for so long, blossoming at the opportunity to take Steve inside him in again.
The clothes he’s wearing belonged to Sam once and practically drip off his body. Fabric pools at his waist even though he’s rolled the shirt up and tucked it firmly into ill-fitting jeans. He’s had to cuff the jeans multiple times and his feet poke out from underneath them, ridiculous protrusions in shoes two sizes too big.
“I’m sorry!” Steve exclaimed, finding his voice. “Tony, God, I’m sorry. I don’t know what I was thinking—I didn’t mean to—oh God! Please believe me, I had no idea that you’d—”
Rebuilding the Compound had taken time, and patching up the team had taken even longer. Trust wormed its way back in as they expanded suites and extended training exercises. Despite everything, after each long, exhausting day, Steve would tumble Tony into bed and they worked their way back to each other with difficult words and sweaty skin.
“It’s ridiculous.” He muttered, resisting the urge to preen under Steve’s attention, the reptilian part of his brain screaming with joy that he’d pleased his mate.
He’s still ruminating when Steve finds him later, reclining on the luxurious, oversized lounger on the balcony to their suite.
“Not your love life–I bet him that I knew you better than he did. Looks like I was right.” Bucky’s warm laughter, and the shit-eating grin on his face follows Tony back to his bedroom.
Steve had been so patient, especially in the beginning, waiting for Tony to decide what he wanted, agreeing to let the bond all but die the night that Tony had called to say they were coming back, because it hurt too much to keep it alive.
“Don’t try to be the hero.” Tony laughs wetly into his chest and fists his hands into the soft creases of his t-shirt. Steve cards his fingers through his hair and Tony tries to savour the feeling.
For a moment, he forgets all about Bucky. The lack of progress falls away and there’s just Steve and his team; Steve and his family. This merry band of misfits all broken and battered but somehow seamlessly stitched together, old and new.
Tonight feels like more than a dream or a memory; his subconscious calls up every fine line right down to a perfect replication of the little scar along the edge of Tony’s jaw and the deep line that creases between his eyebrows. Steve wants to bring those lines to life with a stick of charcoal, and maybe if he asks, Tony will let him draw him like this for nostalgia’s sake.
“Come on, hurry up, you’ve made us late to the party!” Tony scrambles out from underneath him, cock bouncing between his legs and a small trickle of come already working its way down the back of his thighs.
A grin spread across Tony’s face. “Yep, that’s what I’m saying. At least try it before you say no. Just imagine it, Steve.” Tony slid across the mattress towards him, resting his hand on one of Steve’s thighs as he leaned in and pressed his mouth to the soft spot below Steve’s ear. “Think about it. You can have me. Do whatever you want to me. Help me.”
Tony’s arousal flooded the air thickly, bathing them all in coffee and hazelnuts as his mind exploded with
Then Steve pulled the fingers away, grunting from the force of it as he pried open Tony’s fingers and sending off a series of internal alarms. The metal shrieked and gave way, cracks spreading up the arm of the suit and the repulsor in Tony’s palm sparking out. Spiderwebs cracked up the metal like shattered glass, as if the suit was a delicate thing against the brute strength of Captain America.
With Steve’s hand wrapped tight around his cock, Tony came again, shifting as Steve’s knot swelled and locked them together, expanding deep in his ass and filling him to the brim.
“Perfect. You better start packing then, your flights leave first thing tomorrow morning.” A notification pops up on his cell phone notifying him that the documents are already in T’Challa’s possession, and that’s that.
The nest shifted around them, lumps and mounds of fabric rippling like water under their combined weight, spilling over the floor. It was soft and hard at the same time, the tile floor buffered under his back.
The realization that Tony could have just as easily sat down and joined them, feeling more at ease than he has in months, is jarring. But maybe that’s how these things happen. One morning, you wake up and the puzzle pieces are slotting back together, picking up speed as the image becomes clear.
Peter had been so angry when Tony had told him the Rogues were coming back. It had been a toss-up between the fact that Peter had had to find out about it all on the news, and the fact that Peter was one of a half dozen people who knew what had happened in Siberia.
“Oh god.” Steve drags a hand over his face, resisting the surge of heat to the back of his neck. “Stop, this is too much. There needs to be some sort of rule around how much time you two spend together without me.”
The next two days pass by at a grueling pace, leaving Tony exhausted and hollowed out. Steve still watches him, but something is different. Maybe now he realizes that Tony was serious after all, because he doesn’t try to approach him again, and he never comes back to Tony’s hotel room.
“You hate this, don’t you?” Tony says, looking his fill. “Being small. Weak. Needing to ask someone else for help for a change. But you’re still drooling for it.”
“All I get to see over and over again is you driving the shield into my chest! All I ever get to see now is you trying to kill me, Steve!” A familiar burn pricks behind his eyes and Tony wants to scream. Hasn’t he cried enough?
“They’re going to put him under in a few minutes. You can’t go in, Steve.” Pepper lays a hand on his arm as he starts toward the door. “It’s a sterile environment. But you can talk to him, if you want. There’s an intercom, here.”
“Hey kid, leaving your own party so soon?” Tony nods to the driver, who smiles at them with a tilt of his head and a brush of his fingers against the brim of his hat and steps back into the car. Tony props one arm against the door, holding it open at his back as Peter comes to a stop in front of him.
Somewhere after serving the papers the anger had deflated and made way for loneliness, rejection, and hurt to creep back in. The little question of doubt,
“And then you came here and you still picked Captain America over everything else. You’re a selfish man, Steve. Everyone always thinks it’s me.” Tony draws soft fingers over the head of his cock again and Steve flinches away. “I love you anyway, Steve. How fucked is that?”
The Tower was always the one place he’d felt at home and he’s grateful to be here, even for a little while. Maybe this dream can be one that lasts.
There’s a stack of papers overflowing one corner of Tony’s desk and Steve’s fingers twitch against his forearms, itching to reach out and straighten them. Despite his ramrod posture and the harsh look in his eyes, Tony gives himself away too. The once meticulous office is in disarray in a way unique to Tony, a blatant opposite to the chaos of his workshop.
Then Steve’s kissing him like they have all the time in the world. He kisses him and keeps kissing him until Tony is breathless and laughing against his lips. Until Tony presses up against him with a soft gasp, and his tongue slides into his mouth, and Bucky coughs lightly over his shoulder.
“But you—it was an order—” Steve breaks off with a sob, yanking at his gloves to get his hands on Tony’s face and touch him skin to skin, just one last time before they start trying to pull him away. They’ll have to, Steve isn’t going anywhere. He’s not going anywhere without Tony. Not ever.
Tony’s not thinking rationally. He’s going to regret this. He knows that it’s not the right thing to say but he’s going to say it anyway because maybe Steve deserves to hurt, at least something close to what he suffers with. Maybe Steve deserves to ache with it, too.
“You figure out whatever you have to, Cap. I already told you no. And I would have said it a lot sooner if you’d bothered to ask me. Jesus.” He ran his rejection of a hand through his hair and stared at Steve with wide eyes.
“Look at me,” Tony demands, his voice a low grow. He nips Steve’s lip again as Steve struggles to fuck himself back onto Tony’s cock, planting his feet on the mattress for leverage. “You’re perfect, Steve.”
He never wanted to stop. He wanted Tony to wake up coming, eyes rolling back with pleasure and know that
Except he wasn’t in heat and he wasn’t sure when, or if, that might every come again, and he’d spent the better part of a few decades coming to terms with the fact that he wasn’t a typical O. That he was… defective, with a heart condition that impacted his heats and the arc reactor in his chest that had given his natural Omega scent an underlying tinge of burning solder.
A sob broke free from between Tony’s fingers and Steve could only watch, heart splintering in his chest as his stomach dropped and all of his errors came rushing forward. This wasn’t the reaction he had anticipated.
Tony’s fist starts slowing to a stop and Steve braces himself for the inevitable onslaught of sensation again. Tony’s edged him before, but it’s never been like this. This is torture.
The metal hand wraps around one of Steve’s biceps and pulls him back a few more paces. The fingers seem to catch before they curl, and Tony wonders what kind of shoddy job this ‘Shuri of Wakanda’ has done on the prosthetic he’d currently wearing.
Peter is… surprisingly unsurprised when Tony ‘spills the tea.’ He elaborates that he’s known something was up, because why else would the Rogues have been pardoned? Why else would international law be conveniently ignored, even for a short while?
Tony guzzles his way through a piping hot cup of coffee and promptly refills the cup. He plucks a second mug out of the cupboard and fills it too, adding sugar, before turning tail and running back into the soft, safe refuge of his bedroom.
Rhodey glares at him. “Wow, that’s rude. And no. Honestly, Tony, if you don’t tell him, I think I’ll have to do it for you. Steve and I have talked about it; we need all hands on deck and he at least deserves an opportunity to train with the team and get familiar with how to fight with us. You know he’ll get pulled in, either way. Why wait until there’s an alien invasion strolling through Brooklyn?”
“I know you said something to him. I just didn’t think you’d cave so quick. Out with it, Parker. What’d you say that’s got Cap so on edge?”
He gagged, keeled over and blindly grabbed for the edge of the bed or a railing on the wall. Anything.
As much as he wants to hold him, to wrap him in his arms and forgive the last few hours, the last few days, he thinks better than reaching out for him. The anger radiates off Tony in waves.
Unlike all the other times, Tony doesn’t feel threatened. He doesn’t feel the need to suit up and knock Steve down a few pegs, or prepare for the figurative punch in the jaw that always follows the insults. No, Tony feels uncertain. Unstable. Steve is pulling the rug out from underneath him with little yanks, not enough force to unbalance him entirely, but just enough to leave him wobbling and reaching out to steady himself.
Steve pressed Tony down onto his back and captured his lips, tongue dipping inside and tracing the cavern of his mouth where he tasted himself. There was a valiant twitch between his thighs that Steve took as an invitation to paw at him, grasping him loose in one oversized hand to stoke the embers of arousal in his belly back to a roaring, screaming fire.
“Come on, baby, yes. Just like that.” Tony shoves back onto the two slick fingers Steve has crooking in and out of his ass, his left hand tight around his hip to keep him close, or slow him down, Steve isn’t quite sure.
“What’s this about?” Steve’s voice is soft and soothing, cajoling even. He feels buttered up and it’s horrible.
Steve’s got him up against the window, fucking into him like it’s his last night on earth and Tony loves it. There’s a smear of saliva spreading across the window from where Steve caught him off guard, pressing down on the back of his neck to hold him still against the cool glass while he kicked his legs further apart.
It’s in the way Tony doesn’t mince words. He doesn’t shy away from a fight just because Steve is Captain America. And as much as he hates to admit it, Steve’s initial assessment of Tony was wrong.
“There he is.” Tony leans forward to brush his hair back from his face. “I always loved your hair like this. Gotta say though, Rogers. I did not love these pants.”
“Just a nightmare. Hey, you’re okay.” Steve rubs at his back, nudging a little closer. “Haven’t had one like that in a while, huh?”
“Not sure if that’s ever really going to be the case. But without the arm things are a lot better. Not so messed up in my head.”
It’s like he’s seeing Tony Stark in an entirely new light, even though he’s been there all along. Steve hasn’t ruled out that this may be him finally acknowledging what’s always been there. Whether he labels it attraction or not, the way Tony needles and barbs, the way he rubs against him in all the wrong ways, has a certain appeal. It’s maddening, but still Tony has been the one thing keeping him grounded since they woke him up.
“Are you happy?” Steve asks because he can’t help himself. He asks too often these days, but if Tony’s happy, Steve can set the rest aside and try to let himself be happy with him.
Steve makes a loud, exasperated noise and runs both hands through his hair, tipping his head back and looking up at the ceiling as if the answers are written on its surface.
“I know, I know,” Tony quiets, rubbing circles on her back. “Never again. You can do this though. You’re invincible, you’re fantastic, you’re—”
Bucky loved him this way – either of them, really – wanting to watch every flutter of emotion and sensation as it crossed Tony’s face. He liked to suck the air from Tony’s lungs and swallow his cries until Tony was a gasping mess, Bucky the only thing he could see, taste, smile.
In his rage, Tony was not a rational man and Steve didn’t blame him for attacking Bucky. Hell, he didn’t blame him for the fiasco with the Accords, either. It was a difference of opinion Tony was entitled to, and Steve knew that Tony had been struggling since Ultron; Tony’s judgement had been impaired.
“Gross, don’t do that.” Bucky waves a hand between them as if to both accept and bat away his thank-you. He’s smiling all the same.
Wave after wave of pleasure rolled through his body and for a moment all the humming in Steve’s brain stopped. For one, blissful moment, there was only Tony.
” Tony says his name like a prayer, cheek ghosting along his. The warm burn of Tony’s short-trimmed stubble is an afterthought, two seconds behind the hands that can’t seem to stop touching him and Tony’s body, constantly in motion as he wraps around Steve and draws him in.
Steve brushes a hand across his wet cheeks and slides down Tony’s body without a word. He kneels between his legs and presses a kiss to his belly, right below his belly button, before he leans in and sucks Tony down to the root.
When it looks like Tony might say something more, Steve holds his breath, but the words don’t come. They’re swept away in the wake of a fresh set of sobs, and Steve closes his eyes. The storm comes on quickly, and he holds Tony through it until his breaths even and slow.
He got a little more than a slice of that life Tony was always telling him about, and when he looks back at the chapters of his life, the paragraphs are growing shorter and every sentence has a period.
“This is real, right?” Steve asks, abruptly, swallowing around bursts of citrus. “I’m not imagining this. This is really our life now?”
Tony’s never needed much direction. He knows Steve like the back of his hand, which makes sense. He was there for the majority of the discovery, and he puts his learning to good use now. Tony’s tongue is hot and wet, licking up the underside of Steve’s cock, following the thick vein up to the head before he dips his tongue into the slit. It’s too early, too soon, and it sends sparks shooting down to Steve’s toes as he groans and slides a hand into Tony’s hair.
Tony pushes out of his chair with a scoff, shooting a pointed glare at Rhodey before he saunters out of the room without a second glance.
The question is vague and Tony thinks that must be intentional, as if Steve’s trying not to give too much away, waiting to see how much Tony will actually offer.
What kind of ludicrous game was Ross playing at, anyhow? Word of Tony’s marriage ending had been front-page news for weeks, and here they were, prepared to stand together before benefactors and diplomats claiming that the Avengers were united and Steve and Tony had reconciled enough to bring everything into place.
Tony shoots him a lazy, almost giddy smile because he’s drunk on Steve now. Of course, he is. He’s an addict who's just had his first fix in forever.
Choking on nothing aside from his own humiliation, Tony padded back towards them with a flaming red face. He was torn between loving it, and brutal embarrassment not because Bucky was teasing, but because it didn’t even make sense that he had stolen these things.
Tony licked a stripe up his throat and breathes hot in his ear. “You’re just full of surprises, Steve. I like that, and I’m going to figure out every—single—one.”
Later, the elevator door opens and Rhodey is there smiling and looking relaxed in a pair of old jeans and a ratty MIT t-shirt. Pepper and Happy are setting plates on the table and the food is almost ready. It smells amazing, even though Tony’s appetite is nowhere to be found.
The curve of Steve’s lip twists upward under his touch. For a fleeting moment Tony realizes he gets to have this again. He gets to have this for the rest of their lives and it steals his breath away. Loving Steve has never been easy.
