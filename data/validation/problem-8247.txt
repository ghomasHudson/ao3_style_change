“Come on,” she said as she placed both hands on the table, pushing herself to standing and moving her chair back with a loud scrape, “if we’re going to die, I want to do it looking at something more pleasing than this.” She motioned at the two men in front of her with a wave of her hand. Steve chuckled softly and after getting himself up, pulled Tony out of his chair and helped him walk through to the cockpit.
The cockpit began to illuminate with a warm yellow glow.
“Quill—” Nebula felt a lump form in her throat for a man she never thought she’d care for, “he and Gam—” the lump grew infinitely, “Gamora, they told me of something called The Unspoken Thing that they felt between them from before they’d promised themselves to each other. Quill, in his infinite idiocy, said that he felt it from the moment he saw her, but she was just stealing from him, and certainly would’ve killed him, so I don’t understand that. But Gamora...she said she knew it was there when he first mentioned it to her.” Nebula paused a moment, and though she appeared to be looking right at Steve, he knew she was somewhere else, just momentarily. “Sorry, you didn’t ask for all the details.” She clasped her hands together, squeezing her fingers tight over her knuckles— something Steve had noticed she’d do when she was upset. After a long few moments of consideration, she silently shook her head.
Tony’s head fell lightly back against the headrest as he giggled quietly to himself.
Nebula’s smile fell back to her comfortable, recognisable scowl when Steve caught her watching them.
“He’s sleeping,” Steve looked down at Tony, the terrifying beauty of space in front of him suddenly forgotten, “he’s weak. With our remaining supply of food and oxygen, I think it’ll be tomorrow.” The thought of Tony falling asleep and never waking up again caught Steve’s voice in his throat.
“Tony…” Steve’s voice was low, brow knotted in disapproval.
Steve had no idea how long the three of them stayed like that, but it was as comforting as the void— the beautiful, starlit void— in front of them was overwhelming and terrifying.
“Is Stark okay?” Nebula touched Steve’s arm lightly, just for a moment, as she asked and Steve couldn’t help the small curl of a smile itching at the corner of his lips. This— asking after them and a fleeting touch— was the most affection she seemed able to show them so far, but it never went unappreciated.
“I know, Steve. Me too.” Tony’s eyes fluttered shut, his chest barely rising at all. Steve closed his eyes and pressed a long, tender kiss to Tony’s forehead— he planned on staying like that until the oxygen finally ran out.
“I can’t believe how beautiful this is,” Steve offered.
“Morning already, huh?” The sound of Tony’s voice, a croaking whisper, snapped Steve back into the moment.
Steve helped Tony lower himself back into the pilot’s seat, and perched himself on the arm rest, not allowing himself to let go of Tony’s arm.
“Tony, you’re dreaming, it can’t be a—” Steve was cut off as the light grew closer and brighter. He raised a hand to shield his eyes. “—woman.”
Instead of the dark and light swirling purple he’d seen out the window last time, he was now faced with inevitable doom in the form of a teal and almost-black-navy starscape. In the far reaches of his view, Steve saw a galaxy— deep pink, with a blur of bright white-yellow stars dancing an eternal loop.
“This is only the second time I’ve really seen it,” Nebula broke the heavy silence and pushed the fuller bag of rations to Tony’s hand, “the Unspoken Thing.”
Tony’s laugh turned into a wheeze and for a moment they all watched the cloud of breath dissipate into the cold air around them.
“It’s a woman.” Tony muttered.
“I suppose this must be beautiful to you.” Nebula’s voice came from behind him, shattering the silence he had lost himself in.
“If this idiot wasn’t so focused on keeping promises,” Tony bumped Steve with his elbow as he wiped the crumbs from his face, “maybe this wouldn’t have been unspoken for so long.”
“I’ve never seen anything like it. Could never have imagined I would.” In the 21 days they’d spent together on the ship, Nebula had become cautiously but increasingly comfortable with Tony and himself, so Steve was no longer surprised by the proximity with which he now found her standing next to him, just behind his shoulder. He couldn’t pull his gaze from the nebula in front of him to look at the one by his side. He was suddenly sickeningly aware of the one piece of glass separating the three of them from a death only slightly more certain than the one they currently faced.
“Mm, yes, the scene of our oncoming death, very beautiful.” A smile barely drifted over Tony’s face.
“Tony?” Steve couldn’t stop his smile, even though he knew this wouldn’t last long, “Wait...morning?”
“Sorry, Captain,” his smirk more prominent now, then dropping away as he really looked out at the scene in front of him, “it’s unfathomable.” Tony took a shaky breath, as deep as he could manage. “There are worse places to die...and worse company to spend my last hours with.” Tony put his hand over Steve’s.
“What is that?” Nebula’s voice was tinged with anger and defence as she stepped forward.
“The Unspoken Thing?” Tony’s voice was soft and thin when he finally gathered himself enough to ask.
“Steve…” He ignored Nebula’s voice, brimming with...something, concern? Confusion? He refused to open his eyes to an existence without Tony— a reality where Tony Stark, the man Steve finally admitted he loved, was dead.
“It’s a dark consolation, but not even that serum will keep you around for long afterwards.” Nebula had been the first— and last, Steve realised— person to witness the final culmination of more than 10 years of not-quite-there and never acknowledged feelings between Steve and Tony. She put her hand over the back of Steve’s wrist now, gripping as tightly as she could allow herself as two of her fingers rested on the back of his hand. Steve felt a tear form in the corner of his eye, and knowing he couldn’t push Nebula to hold his hand properly, he moved his other down from Tony’s shoulder and slotted it into his hand, resting as he slept, holding on to the life they had left together.
Tony pulls away, clapping his hands together to get the twins’ attention. After a moment or two, Peter and Maushmi drag their eyes away from the evil fox and look at him expectantly.
“What, it’s true,” Tony says, defensively.
He climbs up the stairs, two at a time, and he reaches the landing, hand gripping the railing, as he skids the full way. He knocks on the door ferociously, and he almost falls forward, when James pulls the door open, surprise flickering in his expression.
Brandt scowls, falling silent.
“Do you really want to have this conversation?” Tony asks, pointedly. “This is… this is dangerous territory, don’t you think? I have a husband and kids, and we haven’t seen each other in years, and you’re clearly back because something bad is happening and you need my help, and maybe… maybe, we should
“And you left it in the bathroom?”
“I shouldn’t… I don’t know if anyone told you, but we went to that garden that Nebula told us about–”
“I thank you for your help and for your company,” he says, faultlessly polite, “but I think I would like to sleep now.”
Tony bristles, ready to argue at the rebuke that he hears in Steve’s tone of voice, and then, he catches sight of just how exhausted Steve looks, even if it was Tony who shot the HYDRA bastards who stole their children – that’s somehow worse for Steve, Tony knows, because Steve hates, absolutely
What insurance claims officer needs to leave the house before six in the morning?
okay!” Steve shouts, and then, starts to cough, vigorously, painfully, his spine bowing under the weight of the strain.
His husband is distracted, uninvolved, uninterested,
Tony cries himself to sleep.
“Kids do that. They get so attached to their parents being a single unit, and from what you’re saying, your children already some indication that all wasn’t well between the two of you, so they decided to keep you together the only way that they know how, because they can’t understand the issues that go on behind closed doors,” Eshe says, gently.
Natasha looks like she wants to say something, and maybe Tony would prefer it if she did, but she doesn’t, she doesn’t say anything.
“Thank you,” Sam says, roughly. “I’ll try my best.”
He baulks immediately, and that’s how Tony knows that this picture is odd, that it’s not just him who finds this picture horrifying and distasteful. The boy tries to protest.
“I can’t, I can’t let the police know. They wouldn’t…” Tony purses his lips. “They don’t have the kind of resources that I do. I can find them quicker; please,
Tony returns the smile. “I picked you,” he promises.
Steve’s expression looks agonized. “Tony, please, I just want to-”
James nods. “Understood.”
James looks up at him through his eyelashes, his pale eyes hot. “Like I could ever forget what it was like to be with you.”
Tony lets out the sob that builds in his throat before he can stop himself, and he hates himself for it, hates himself for being so weak, and maybe, as much as he also hates to admit this to himself, he wasn’t ready for this, wasn’t ready to be like this with them, and
His veins fill with lead, cold and heavy and disgusting.
“You picked the kids up,” he says, no emotion in his voice whatsoever.
“I want to ride your cock and watch the video at the same time and have you tell me how much of a slut I look like in the video,” Tony confesses.
“Ah, yes,” Eshe drains half the glass of water that’s sitting on the small table beside her chair, “what I was trying to say is that children don’t take well to their parents’ relationship dynamic changing, especially if it was happy and stable in the first place. Now, the two of you had your issues, your children sensed that and it affected them accordingly to the point where they made those drawings, and now, from what you’re saying, your children are doubly protective over what you two have and are trying to keep the two of you together and happy. That’s normal in situations like this, but with what the two of you are proposing, there is going to be issues. The kids might not take it well, especially early on, the introduction of this stranger into their lives. Do they know about James at all?”
“Actually,” Steve hesitated for an agonising moment, “that’s something else that we wanted to talk to you about?”
child.”
“What’s going on here?”
Tony’s world shifts for the final time, stretches at the seams to include James in some significant, permanent way that he’d always been aware of but just needed some tangible effort on the universe’s part to put it square in front of his eyes, eight months after they have the conversation about including James into their family with the children.
“But-but my wine,” Tony complains.
“Fuck yes! We’ve made it this far.”
, they weren’t, well, they weren’t always there, and so, I thought if I had babies of my own, I wasn’t sure I’d be a good
, but this, you, us, the family that we make together, I want it to be mine.”
Obadiah gurgles his screams as he burns, blood and smoke everywhere, and his entire body is quickly engulfed.
“Oh, no, you don’t. Leave the five thousand here,” Tony orders.
“Steve knows that I lied about where I was when I left him and the kids, yesterday,” Tony says, wearily, pinching the bridge of his nose. “When I came back home, he’d dropped the kids off at a friend’s house, and he was waiting for me at home. He was
When he stops shaking, Tony is breathing hard, and there’s a pleasant stretch to his thighs, his entire nerve ending shot to hell, and he’s grinning shamelessly from the hot, lovely rush of pleasure that makes the endorphins rush to his head. Before he even knows what’s happening, Steve is withdrawing from his legs, crawling forward to his head. His hand is around his cock, stroking firm, back and forth.
“But still–” Natasha cuts herself short. “My apologies, this is not about me. You have gone through something terrifying and horrific, and I should not be focusing on what I could have or could not have done. I… I want you to know that you are safe now, my lord–”
Tony curves forward, and then, his arc reactor pinches against a muscle or a tendon inside him, and he winces, rubbing against the spot, until whatever it is, shifts, and he can no longer feel the sharp pressure there.
Steve bites at his shoulder in response, making Tony whine low in his throat.

“So, how was your day?” Steve asks, washing his face in the bathroom sink.
After a moment, even Steve opens his previously clenched eyes, confused.
,” Tony sings, slowly, giving the children time to join him with their soft, high voices. “
“And now you’re here.”
He guesses that’s him, and the two on either side of him is Peter and Maushmi, one with short hair and two, thick scratches as pants as Peter, and another with a triangular sort of dress and long hair flicked out in the ends.
“Asleep,” Tony says, belligerently. “Because it’s a Thursday night and it’s two in the morning. They have school tomorrow.”
“And his temperament?” Tony braves himself to ask, licking his lips, even if he knows that it does not matter.
“Tony-”
Tony nods again, suddenly feeling out of place, out of body, and lets James steer him towards the door, out into the walk. They make it down the stairs in total, utter silence, and they only stop when they reach Tony’s car.
“Fuck!” Tony snaps.
He heads over to the counter, pouring himself a coffee cup, draining it dry, before pecking both Ana and his mother on the cheek.
“A word?” he says, sharply.
He reads them, each and every one of them, and they’re all of people that he knows, people who are dead and people who are alive, and Tony gets sick of the game pretty quickly.
Tony sucks in a sharp breath.
with me? Do you really think I needed to
Tony shakes his head.
“But he’s not
Tony stares at him and licks his lips. “You know what’s in there,” he says, heavily. “You’ve seen the pictures, all of you.”
“Oh, yeah? Did I kill anyone?” James demands.
“Look at you like what?”
Steve peeks his head out from the bathroom. “I’d love to,” he says, fondly.
Tony turns his head, so that no one can see how it affects him, how much it hurts him, how his face cracks wide open, and he clenches his eyes shut in an attempt to free himself of the weight of the blow.
“You really think that?” Steve asks, his voice low, hushed, pained. “You really think that I’d just leave you like that, leave our kids, and just, what, never talk to any of you again? Just abandon you completely?”
“Well, it’s a nice couch–”
; they might have… they might have
now,” Tony tells him, coldly. “It’s not the easiest thing to walk away from.”
Peter gnaws on his nails, and then, his lower lip. “You’re not going anywhere?” he asks James, in his high, child’s voice.
James nods.
“Okay, I’ll see you out,” James says, gesturing to the door.
“Where are the kids?” is the first that Steve asks.
Steve tells her about the photos that Natasha was happy enough to give him, about Tony and the Winter Soldier spending time together, actively defying SHIELD, about the times that Tony lied to him, the night where they fucked and after, how Tony blew up at him and slept in the other room. Steve tells her about the last straw, about the last time that Tony had visited the Winter Soldier in his apartment, and how he’d come home afterwards. He tells her about the gun, SHIELD’s orders, and the fight that ensued after that. He tells her about the Winter Soldier intervening. He tells her about Bucky, about staring at a ghost, the ghost of his dead best friend, his first love, of a love that never quite died, was just lost somewhere in the desert half a world away.
“I do, I do,” Tony murmurs.
“No, no, no,” he says, weakly, “don’t, I refuse. I don’t want to go to sleep.”
The threats escalate. Guns are shoved in his face, and they threaten to cut off parts of his body. They scrape knives against his ankles and stomach and chest and between his legs, reminding him that he only needs his tongue to talk – the rest of him is expendable.
He mouths at Tony’s throat, where his pulse is throbbing fast and wild, and then, he moves down his body, running his tongue over each brown, shiny scar on his sternum, from where the arc reactor used to be, even if he knows that the skin there is all dead anyway without feeling. He bites down on the bone of Tony’s hip, drawing a curse out of Tony, as he jerks upwards.
“Fucking prick,” Tony mutters under his breath.
Steve’s fists clench hard over his thighs. “Because at first, it was too painful to talk about,” he confesses, the muscle in his jaw jumping. “When I first met Tony in that bar, I was just starting to move on from the fact that Bucky was dead. I… we’d never actually
Tony looks down at his lap.
“And I hope that you stay safe here,” Steve says, his voice gentle. “Take care of yourself, Grant.”
“Yeah?” Steve’s eyes brighten, his face splitting wide in a relieved grin, and he climbs to his feet. “Yeah, you’ll marry me.”
“You want to know what happened,” Tony snarls. “Your brother and I fucked.”
Tony processes the words, and his face twists with revulsion, his stomach actually rebelling against the words.
When that doesn’t do anything, he rolls his hips out in a quick, dirty grind, and then, he bats James’ hand away, the hand around his throat, and twists their bodies until he’s bearing James down onto the mattress and he’s sitting astride him, his legs on either side of James’ hips.
He climbs to his feet, stretching out his hand.
“But you have,” Steve says, simply, smiling. “And I’m going to explain to you why. You see, my name’s Steve Rogers, and I’m datin’ this… smart, beautiful, kind, funny, fierce,
James closes his eyes. “Okay, I guess that’s one way to look at it,” he muses. “But it’s the right way.”
“We’ll see what your Daddy has planned for today,” Tony tells him.
“If this sort of situation comes up again, do you think you can be strong enough to talk to Steve about this, without having to resort to the massive arguments that you’ve had in the past?”
fingers so that we can bring everyone back?” Tony offers, his voice betraying his hesitation.
“A monster setting,” Peter says, dubiously.
“Oh, my God, Steve, oh, God–”
Natasha’s entire form turns lax. “Fine, Steve was busy that night, and I offered to bring you dinner because I wanted to know more about you. You were… well, you were hostile to say the least; you didn’t want me in your house, and you definitely didn’t want me around your kids, but I guess I just wanted to see you in your element, you know? Your house and your kids, and I know that Steve was really busy, and he seemed really tired, and I was concerned about him,” she says, defensively.
“He got along well with all of you. He would play with you, laugh with you, tease you, and you loved it, presumably because you knew, even then, that Howard would never do those things with you,” Maushmi says, bitterly.
Steve grins at him, boyish and unencumbered, before showing him the shield strapped to his back. “It’s got to be good for something.”
Of course, when they see Steve, the misery falls away and is quickly replaced with joy. Maushmi is the first to hurtle out of bed and into Steve’s arms, who catches her, just as she hits his chest, closing his arms around her and swaying her little body back and forth.
me that, and I… I…” Steve deflates, the hurt bleak on his handsome features, “don’t think I could’ve done it, Tony, don’t think I could’ve been with you like that.”
cheating on him,” he growls low in his throat. “Why do people keep telling me that? Why do people think that I’m-”
“Obadiah Stane is still alive somewhere. I’m going to find the son of a bitch and get rid of him once and for all,” Tony says, coldly, fixing all of them with a stern look. “I wouldn’t wait up if I were you.”
“You don’t have to be,” Tony tells him. “Contrary to popular belief, an erection is not needed to have an orgasm. Just… do you trust me?”
Tony scuttles back against the headboard, and Peter curls up by his side, almost immediately, one eager for comfort wherever he can get it. Tony flicks open the camera app on his phone and stretches out his arm, so that Tony and Peter can see the screen. He drags it over the entire room, stopping at Steve and Maushmi on the other bed, who promptly make a gruesome, distorted face just to hear Peter giggle all over again.
“I’m not leaving,” James says, his voice all but a growl.
Around the next bend, Tony sees white, blessed sunlight coming through the crack in the corner of the next chamber.
James snorts. “I would’ve bent you over the nearest table if I had no more morals,” he offers.
But Tony can’t be fucked feeling any sympathy towards his husband’s mistress, and he can’t ignore the similarities, at face value at least, between him and Natasha Romanoff, because this might not just be an affair.
“Krishna approached Satrajit and told him that he should share the gem with the other people of Dwārakā and give it to King Ugrasena, who was Krishna’s grandfather. Satrajit declined, saying that the jewel belonged to him. A few days later, Satrajit's brother Prasena wore the jewel as a necklace and went out on a hunt. He climbed a tree waiting for some game, a lion came by, and just as Prasena was about to shoot it, a snake, which dropped from the branch above, surprised him. Now, Prasena was startled and he fell from the tree. As he was falling, the necklace with the Syamantaka Gem got caught in a branch, and Prasena hung by the neck. He was killed instantly.”
“I’m not, I’m
He sweeps a hand over his face, and then, breaks into a coughing fit that makes Tony think he’s about to keel over.
“Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division,” James deadpans. “They’re a secret intelligence agency, based here, in the States. When I came back stateside, I guess they didn’t like it too much that an ex-HYDRA, and frankly, they might just think that I’m still HYDRA, was in their territory. They’ve been tailing me.”
“Perhaps it would be better than you taking my head for my crimes in front of all of your people,” Tony replies, darkly.
“Did they see
Steve jumps up, looks around desperately.
“Tony? Tony, where are you?”
“Oh?” Steve’s voice is incredulous.
The submarine had stopped, and he realizes quickly that it was a gentle well of water that had splashed him awake.
“How can you… how can you stand there, have married me, have had children with me, and
person, as Steve’s footsteps recede.
Bhim climbs to his feet and doesn’t hesitate to embrace both of them. “My friends,” he says, his voice thick with emotion. “I am so pleased you are not dead.”
Grant withdraws from the boy, and the boy stumbles, clearly weak-kneed, gathering up his clothes, dressing quickly, and rushing past Tony, who plasters himself against the door frame in an attempt to avoid the two of them touching.
Tony doesn’t resist, because there’s a significant, pained part of him that revels in this, revels in Steve touching him like this, like he still loves him, like there is absolutely nothing wrong with their marriage.
“What the–” Stone swallows hard, before fixing his eyes on Steve. “Who the hell are you? What the hell do you think you’re doing?”
“I’m your boyfriend now, Tony,” Obadiah purrs into his ear.
“No address or criminal file?” Steve says, discomfited.
the enemy here,” Tony retorts.
Ship/Main Pairing: Tony/Steve
“Is that your final answer, Tony?” Grant asks, disappointed.
“Okay, then,” Eshe says with a soft smile of her own. “How do we do that?”
She beats them black and blue, spinning in the cold night faster than his eyes catch, her hair loosening from its dark curls, and she’s beautiful, maybe the most beautiful alpha that Tony has ever seen (that’s a lie; when Steve Rogers smiles, it does things to him that he didn’t even think were possible).
“Get up and get out,” Tony says, his eyes fixed on the wall ahead of him.
Phillips stares at Steve hard, before relenting. “Barnes?”
“Yeah,” Wanda says, dryly. “I hit him, and you should have seen his face, Tony. He was… so surprised, but so hurt, and I think that was the worst. He… he didn’t, he didn’t think I was capable of it, and honestly, neither did I. I stepped back, and there were tears in my eyes, and his hands were shaking. He looked… he looked awful, completely awful, and then, he left.”
Steve’s hands tighten around Tony’s hips – tomorrow, he’ll certainly wake up with a mottled canvas of bruises on either side, but he’ll still be content, content enough to touch those bruises and remember how they got there and smile at the soft, slow ache.
“I think,” Abraham swallows, “yes.”
“What happened, honey?” Steve asks, his voice rough, rubbing his back.
how much of a degenerate slut I really am, how hot and hungry you can make me for it?”
“No,” Tony says, slowly, cold, gaping dread opening up in the pit of his stomach. “No, you haven’t.”
That night, Steve comes to bed, and Tony is already lying under the covers, pulled up to his waist, while he swipes across the tablet in his lap with the pad of a single thumb.
“No, you’re not,” Steve says, lowly.
“Steve went to get them,” James explains.
There’s a noise, and when Tony turns around, Peggy is standing in the doorway, red-eyed and tired.
Tony jars awake, suddenly, at the sensation of plaster dust raining down on him, sitting bolt upright. He looks up at the ceiling, touching the top of his head, feeling around his hair.
Steve’s face cracks wide open, and he starts crying unashamedly, soft, slow tears that rack his body.
The sun is burning his skin, streaking it with an unhealthy shade of red, and he can feel it so sore that it’s pulling tight across his muscles and bones. Despite his struggles, the Nazis are tugging him to this strange hole in the dirt.
“–and you killed Thanos,” Tony finishes for him. “Yes, Rhodey told me.”
There’s cigarette smoke and laughter everywhere, as he makes his way through the tables.
“Look, I’m not saying that married couples shouldn’t keep secrets from one another. I don’t think that’s realistic at all,” Eshe tells him, her voice kind. “I think you both have kept secrets from each other, and those secrets have to do with formative parts of your life, which is where I see problems happening. The secrets about who didn’t do the dishes the last night, or who ruined the bedspread with coffee, those don’t matter. You get angry, you fight for a few minutes, and then, you move on. These ones, though, the secrets that you kept from each other – Steve, your secrets with SHIELD and Natasha and Bucky; Tony, your secrets with James and what you did at MIT – these are the ones that have the power to end relationships. These are the secrets that are so central to your existence, to your identity, your relationship, that you
Tony drops the folder, leans over the nearest bucket and vomits into it, vomits until his chest is aching, his throat is sore, and his eyes are flooded with tears, which drip and drip and drip, running like rivers down his face.
Steve’s thumb rubs over Tony’s cheekbone, tracing over the line, the curve. “Okay,” he says, gravely, “whatever you need me to do.”
The bell rings, and they’re swallowed up in the crowd before Steve can address Tony’s latest conspiracy theory.
“Quite,” Bhim says, dryly.
Steve’s face dims, as he remembers the other side of the story, the side where the Winter Soldier isn’t just some faceless man named James who’s in love with his husband and possibly fucking him, but his best friend, his tortured, not-
"Brooklyn."
Eventually the kiss gentled, soft sweeps of lips against his own, tongue brushing over the sore spot where his alpha had bit him, making him feel fragile. Tony guided them to the couch, tucked him tightly against his side, allowed Steve to bury his face in his neck once more, overwhelmed, this time by emotion. “Please don’t leave me.”
“And I could keep it? You wouldn’t take me away from our baby, would you?”
“Always, sweetheart. But that doesn’t mean I’m going to make it any easier on you. I’m a selfish man. I enjoy my fun. And claiming every last inch of you for my own? That’s fun.”
The smile turned softer, indulgent. Tony kissed him again. "That's my good boy. Good night sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow." He stood there until Steve unlocked his door and stepped inside. His fingers brushed against his cheek one last time before he disappeared back into the elevator.
Work is very mind numbing and dull. Have a chapter of kinky porn. Enjoy!
Steve was beautiful in his anguish, screaming as Tony forced him over the edge again and again, constant pressure on his prostate ensuring that he was completely emptied by the time they were done. He collapsed back on the table, gasping for breath, eyes shut, as he tried to recover from the onslaught of pleasure. Bruce quietly entered the room, probably notified by JARVIS that they’d finished. Steve didn’t have a chance to react as the needle slid into the side of his neck, the sedative taking him before he even had a chance to struggle.
"Oh please, yes..."
“Oh! Right! So I had reservations tonight for my favorite Italian restaurant, but I really don’t want to go by myself, and I thought it’d be a lot more fun if you went with me. I always have a good time with you. So will you?”
Tony accessed the collar and cuffs, pulling Steve backwards off his feet. The restraint board slid across the floor, landing beside him. Before he could react, the restraints connected to it’s surface, retracting down until he was held immobile. Bands slid over his torso and limbs, holding him securely in place. He struggled until his face was red and his chest heaving.
Tony had spent the day much the same as he had. Both of them were exhausted leading to a simple dinner followed by going to bed early. Steve had a hard time falling asleep that night, tossing and turning restlessly until finally falling into a light doze. Small sounds startled him awake all night, leaving him feeling sluggish the next morning. His exhaustion was obvious enough that Tony handed him the first cup of coffee.
“No! No! Stop it! Leave me alone!” Steve’s chest was heaving, tears pouring down his face from stress and panic. Tony made a soothing sound, rubbing over the bond bite to calm him.
Steve slowly climbed back to his feet. The wall of windows showed a nightscape that was instantly recognizable as Manhattan. Somehow, he was back in Stark Tower. The elevator chimed behind him and he spun around only to come face to face with Tony Stark for the second time that day. The other man’s features showed shock for a moment, before closing down into the hard, angry mask Steve was so used to seeing.
“Yeah. It was a dilating formula. He was resistant to getting bred.”
The metal of the robotic cage was moving again, shifting to clamp down ruthlessly around the base of Steve’s cock, forcing him back from the edge and holding him there as he sobbed into his stretched arms.
“But, you just said…”
(See the end of the chapter for
There was a slight waver in Steve’s voice, but he remained defiant. “Fuck you!”
“Barnes here, came back from the dead a while ago. And apparently he killed both of my parents back in the day. And Rogers? He knew about it. Hid it from me. Tore apart the team, threw me under the bus without a care in the world, other than protecting the Winter Soldier.” Bucky flinched at the name, and Stark saw it. Saw everything. “Don’t like that, do you? Not too happy myself. Last time I saw Captain America and his Winter Soldier, I was freezing to death, trapped in a busted suit, with the arc reactor that I use to keep me alive smashed to pieces in my chest courtesy of the shield my dad made for Steve Rogers. And you both just walked away, didn’t you? Not a care in the world. Not about me. Not about the shit storm you left behind. How’d that work out for you, Barnes?”
"Always."
Tony gently urged Steve onto his side, curling their bodies together, trying desperately to soothe the distraught omega.
“Okay. It’s okay.” The alpha rumbled quietly, the sound vibrating through his chest, soothing Steve’s shattered nerves. He whined, trying to press closer, find the feelings of comfort and safety that he’d lost. “I’m right here. Everything is gonna be okay, sweetheart.”
Steve then ran the gel Natasha had given him through his hair to lightly slick it back and rubbed a vanilla-flavored balm into his lips. Next, he pulled on a pair of blue silk briefs that Natasha had helped him pick out and carefully dressed in the tuxedo that had been delivered to him the day before. After checking that every detail was right in the mirror, he took the elevator up to the penthouse.
“Let’s start with something simple. Call me Tony.”
“It’s fine.” Bucky can feel himself hunching in, curling up tighter, trying to protect himself. What from he wasn’t sure.
Steve gasped at the words, tears welling up in his eyes. He was right. It might not be how he pictured it, but this is what he came here for. Tony would give him what he deserved. What he needed. “A-as many as you want, Tony.”
“You going to ask me for it?”
Steve shuddered hard, felt his body squeeze around the dildo buried inside of him, pulse against the metal imprisoning him. His response was breathy and soft. “Yes Tony.”
"Yes, Sir."
"I- I came without permission?"
“Yeah. Thanks J. And order enough dim sum for both of us in… Oh, say an hour? That should work as finger food.”
Steve shifted on the bed, curling up tightly against Tony’s side, face buried against his chest. “I love you, Tony. So much. You”re the first person I think of every morning. The one I want to see the most when I’ve been gone. I’d do anything for you.”
"Good. Come on. Let’s get you under the covers."
Tony’s eyes glowed that beautiful blue that Steve couldn’t bear to look away from, and a soft click sounded from the cage. He felt the metal sliding away, exposing his cock. Steve was so oversensitized, had been locked away for so long, he could feel every gust of air against his skin causing him to writhe against the sheets. A low ache throbbed in his shaft as it hardened almost immediately.
Steve whined, pressing back when Tony’s fingers reached his hole. It was slick and swollen beneath his touch, making Tony moan. “Fuck, Steve… Look at you. You’re gushing for me, baby, aren’t you?”
“Good. Come on sweetheart. Let me take care of you for a bit.” Tony gently guided Steve to his feet, supporting him when he stumbled. He led him to a cushion beside a chair at the table, eased him back down to his knees. Relief flooded Steve, making him feel dizzy and disoriented. Tony was going to punish him. His alpha was going to correct his behavior, not get rid of him. He accepted bites of food from Tony’s fingers, sips of water from a glass whenever it was held down. He wasn’t sure how long he stayed there, floating on the waves of relief, but when he was finally urged to move, his wounds were healed and muscles stiff.
By the last day of Steve’s heat, Tony received at least a part of what he was wanting. Steve’s belly was rounded and slightly swollen, his dainty cocklet hidden between his thighs. Tony was extremely pleased by the current size he’d managed to reduce Steve to over the course of his heat, the added benefit of course being how crazy it had driven the omega each and every time. He hoped in the future that Steve would grow used to the cage, stop fighting against it. Maybe he’d even be able to put him in a less restrictive and more decorative one in the future.
"Oh God..." Steve buried his face in his hands, feeling his skin burn at the realization that Bruce apparently knew exactly what he and Tony were doing, and probably had for a while.
Any concerns, please see the end note.
"Mr. Stark! How did you manage to date Captain America?"
He fought then, finally finding the strength to struggle now that it was too late. “No! No, you can’t! Tony! No. Please. Please?”
“And after you received the serum…?”
Steve turned his face away to stare at the wall. “Don’t.”
*          *          *
With a sigh of relief, he rolled to drape himself over the brunette, clinging to him. Silently begging for sweet caresses and gentle kisses.
“Tony…?”
“Thank you. Why don’t you go to the bathroom, take care of anything you need to do, then meet me back out here.”
He took his time, slowly feeding Steve bites of fruit and pastry with his bare hands. Stroking his fingers across his lips. Steve relaxed into the sensation, let the world become blurry and distant. He brushed kisses over Tony's fingertips and lapped the juices from his skin. Time seemed to slow around them. It felt like he was floating a few inches above the ground.
“Alright, sweetheart. You know I’ll always give you what you need. But how about we make a game out of it? I have a meeting in about five minutes, and then I’m free for the rest of the day. I want you on your knees, under my desk, warming my cock for that meeting. If you can be a good boy, and not distract me, you’ll get a reward. But if you’re a naughty little vixen who teases me and gets me hard, then you get punished. Understand?”
"Yeah... Sounds nice..." Steve could feel his cock beginning to stir in the confines of the cage just from the other man's presence. From knowing he was going to play with him. The first throb of almost pain as the cage prevented him from hardening.
“I know. But let me try? We have the next three days free, barring psychopaths or aliens trying to invade the world.” He let out a breath, a soft chuckle. “Never thought I’d say that. Anyway. Give me those three days. Try for me. Give in and let me do this my way. If you hate it, or can’t do it, we’ll figure out something different. Deal?”
“I love you too Tony.”
"Tony, I always love the things that you make. That you take the time to create something for me with your own hands. Whatever it is, I'm sure I'll love it."
The table turned back over, Steve laying on his back once again. Dr. Stark came to stand in front of him again, a pleased smile playing over his features. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. I’ll get you home. Get you sorted out.”
For the second morning in a row, Steve woke to a cock sliding deep inside of him. He could feel slick dripping down the backs of his thighs and tensed. However, the punishment of the day before was too fresh in his mind. He didn’t want to spend another day burning with arousal, unable to find relief. And although he would never admit it aloud, the alpha’s thick cock felt good moving inside of him. Something he had never allowed himself to experience. A moan slipped free when the growing knot began to tug at his newly sensitive rim, sparks of pleasure bursting behind his closed eyes every time it dragged over his tender glands.
"Are you asking?"
Tony softened, cupped the omega’s cheek in his hand. “No more electric shocks, sweetheart. Your gland is recovered. I checked the scans myself this morning.” He dropped a gentle kiss on Steve’s slightly parted lips, drawing it out when he didn’t try to pull away.
Steve lost to pleasure and desperate was probably the sexiest thing Tony had ever seen in his life. It made Tony want to destroy him. Ruin him for anyone and anything else, so he’d never want to leave. “Offer me your neck, sweetheart.” His voice was low and dark, dangerous. But Steve still obeyed immediately.
“Did you just come for me, Steve?”
Both men rose to their feet and obediently walked down the hallway. When they entered, James cautiously glanced around. Tony watched him carefully, wanting to make sure nothing in the room would trigger a bad memory or a panic attack. When he’d finished taking in the surroundings, Tony caught his gaze, held it until he received a small nod in return. “Now Steve, I know how hard it can be for you to control yourself sometimes, so we’re going to get you tied up nice and tight. Say thank you, omega.”
“From killing an unarmed and broken man?” Tony arched an unimpressed brow, then sighed, slumping back against his workbench. He kept his arms wrapped around Steve’s waist, holding him close. “I don’t know what I’m doing. I really don’t. I know that the person who showed up here the other night isn’t the one I met in Siberia. He’s not Rogers’ pet, and he hasn’t done anything other than hide since he got here. It’s just throwing me off, I guess.”
Time seemed to stretch and melt around him, pleasure building slow and gentle until he was falling over the edge and softly crying the other man’s name. He didn’t fight as Tony continued to stroke him, drawing out the pleasure, working him to arousal, and then again bringing him to release. It seemed like forever when Tony was finally done. He curled, limp and sated, into the cushions, felt the heat of Tony’s body against his, and was perfectly content.
The cage seemed to be fully automated and remotely controlled. It tightened and loosened throughout the day to suit the situation. Almost like something Tony would design, if he were to set his mind to making sex toys. Which was a thought that it was best for Steve not to dwell on. A soft ding startled him out of his sexual haze. Realizing it was the cell phone, Steve quickly finished rinsing off before stepping out to snatch up the cell and see what his Sir had sent him.
"Okay." One arm wrapped tightly around Steve's waist, holding him back against Tony's chest. The other hand wrapped tight around his cock, starting a punishingly fast rhythm. There was no build-up, just hard strokes, working him to the edge dizzyingly quickly. Steve's head fell back against the other man's shoulder, hips rocking up into his fist. Tension coiled in his muscles, pleasure creeping up his spine, pushing him closer to the edge. Almost there...
“Absolutely, honey. I’m not letting you go. Nobody’s gonna take you away from me. Not ever.” There was a hint of a growl in Tony’s voice that he hadn’t intended to be there, but instead of scaring Steve, it seemed to cause him to relax further in his arms. He was finally calm. Content.
"I was wondering if you'd like to go. As my date. There'll be a lot of press there, so I understand if you're not ready for that yet. But I would love a chance to show you off. Show you a good time. The kind with clothes on."
"Good boy. Such a good boy for me. I think that deserves a reward." Tony pulled him into another kiss, this one deep and filthy. His hands began roaming over his chest, flicking and pinching his nipples roughly before pushing him down onto the bed.
“Well, you know. Genius.” Tony moved around his body until he was kneeling in front of him, tipping his face up to the light, studying it. “Beautiful. How did I get so lucky?”
A small sound drew his gaze back up as Tony drew the chain from around his neck, unlocking the cage, sliding it off and setting it aside. Steve's cock throbbed to life as Tony began to move inside of him, thrusts slow, drawing nearly all the way out before stroking deep in a single movement, eyes locked on his the entire time.
"You're welcome, baby. Get your mind off of work, and right here to pleasing me. That's what you're here for, aren't you?"
Loki hesitantly moved closer. "I am quite well here. Does that please you, or do I need to fear my recapture by your hands?"
"It would indeed. Any other questions, feel free to give Pepper a call. She knows the ins and outs of the collection. If you'll excuse us, I promised to show this beautiful man a good time."
Steve shuddered. “And if I don’t want to wait?”
It was as though every release he had been denied yesterday, Tony was determined to give him today. Steve’s chest felt swollen and tight. Every brush of fingertips made him shudder. The suction of Tony’s mouth around his nipples had slick dripping down his thighs. He squirmed in his bonds, enjoying the sensation more than trying to free himself.
"Captain Rogers? Sir is requesting your presence, if you are free."
"That's right, sweetheart. Gonna punish that hungry little hole of yours. Teach you some manners that way. It's just ginger. It won't hurt you."
True to his word, Tony had left him shackled to the bedposts until he had returned with a beautiful collar he had crafted for Steve, made from the titanium alloy of one of the Iron Man suits. He couldn’t stop touching it, running his fingers over the smooth metal. It was slim, only about an inch thick, and could be adjusted at Tony’s whim. Another piece of him that was controlled by the other man. And he loved it. Even if he did have to put up with the smirks and teasing from Bucky.
"T-Twenty. You said?"
"Uh uh. Naughty boy." Tony reached back behind him, gripped the base of the plug and pulled it free, carelessly tossing it to the side. "You didn't think it would be that easy, did you?"
Steve had expected the conversation with Natasha to go almost exactly as it did. She was usually reasonable and currently predisposed to like the mage that saved them from the unending slime golems. Clint was the surprise. Steve had expected the man who had been controlled by Loki during the invasion to be more upset by his presence in the tower. However, the time as a thrall seemed to have given the archer a fairly good insight to Loki's state of mind at the time. In the end, Clint used the opportunity to extort a supply of homemade baked goods from the god and was more than willing to move forward.
“Oh sweetheart, you’re a fucking gift.” Tony’s voice was a low growl by the last few words, making Steve shudder helplessly again.
“That’s right. Pretty baby. Feels good, doesn’t it?” When the reply took too long, he slapped the side of Steve’s face sharply, forcing his attention back. “Answer me.”
"Tony, you don't have to give me anything."
Tony flashed him a cocky smile, squeezing his neck in a gentle grip before letting go and taking his own seat once again. “That’s right, sweetheart. I’m more than a pretty face. I’m Tony Stark.”
Bucky didn’t realize he’d been screaming, or that he’d moved at all. The door to the bedroom burst open, Steve and Stark rushing in, hastily thrown on robes mostly in place. Bucky had wedged himself into the corner, was trying to press back into the meeting of the walls, make himself smaller. Escape. Disappear.
Steve whipped around to face him, shock on his face. “Buck? Is… Is that you?”
“Why not. I don’t have anywhere else to go.”
The attachment on the cage came alive, buzzing against the metal sending strong vibrations through the cage. Steve cried out, hips rocking forward, cock straining. The movement shifted the plug, causing him to jerk back. He was helpless against the unrelenting onslaught of pleasure, body arching and writhing. It didn't stop.
“Tony…”
"No..."
“So good for us.” He glanced over his shoulder, taking in James’ intent gaze before turning back to the trembling omega and sliding to his knees. Tony trailed his fingers over Steve’s slick thighs, then began to stroke it over his soft cock, leaving it wet and glistening as Steve gasped and writhed from his touch. He lingered for a few minutes, enjoying the slide of the silky skin through his fingertips, as well as the helpless noises it drew from Steve anytime his overly sensitive cock, or cocklet as he called it, was touched. He obviously loved and hated it in equal measure, and was so easily overwhelmed by it, making it one of Tony’s favorite ways to torture him. Finally deciding he’d had enough, Tony let his grip slide away. He hid a smile at the obvious sigh of relief Steve released, thinking that Tony was done.
“Good.” He moved closer, pulled Steve into his arms, stroked his hair. “I always want you to feel safe with me. I know… I know we play hard. We both like it that way. But I need you to know that we’re more than that. I love you, Steve.”
“And finally, instead of asking your alpha for what you needed, you tried to take it yourself.” Tony’s hand slid between his thighs, rubbing delicious circles into the stretch of skin behind his cock, knowing exactly where to touch to make Steve shudder in pleasure. As soon as he was getting close to release, Tony stopped, leaving Steve panting and disappointed, writhing from the fresh surge of need pounding through him.
The relief was short lived as the machine he was bound to came to life, vibrating beneath him. Steve tried to fight, struggling against the mixture of pain and pleasure wrecking his body. The spot behind his balls was tight and ached fiercely as the vibrations pounded through him, however this was also the most stimulation his cock had gotten since Tony caged him a week ago. His head fell back with a groan as the cage tightened around him as arousal swelled him in his confines.
“Because I know now. Not to touch. That’s… That’s not for me.”
"Water?"
Once the last formalities had been finished, Tony lifted the limp omega in his arms, carried him to the waiting limousine and ordered Happy to return them to the tower. It was a short trip, and in less than an hour he was depositing Steve on his bed. “JARVIS?”
"Will you marry me, Steve?"
“Of course, love. Nothing could make me happier.”
"You with me, baby?"
Steve took the time to look around. Notice the chaos and creativity present in every inch of the space. Somehow it seems to suit the genius perfectly.
Steve began moving the toy again, hips rocking, unsure if he was trying to avoid contact with that sensitive spot, or chase more of it. Several times Tony ordered him to stop, adjust one of the settings, increasing the speed or strength of the vibrations, pushing him closer and closer to the edge, desperate for relief. So close that a little more stimulation might have him coming despite the cage. A groan behind him signaled Tony's release, frustration at the thought of being denied again making him want to scream.
"Okay." He gently stroked Steve's side, sipping his coffee. "Do you need me to help you, baby? Make sure you get a good night’s sleep tonight?"
“Gonna die on you? No. All better now, sweetheart.”
“No. My name is Tony. You’ve been here for almost a month. You’re practically a ghost, hiding in the shadows. Something has to give, and we’re starting with this.”
Steve raised his head enough to weakly glare up at the older man. “I don’t really have a choice, do I?”
"Long. Boring. Lots of people who think they're smarter than me only to find out they're wrong. The usual. Lots of boring meetings though. All day, actually. Have some energy to burn. And lucky for you, a beautiful submissive to help me do it."
Steve slid his hand into Bucky’s, tugging him to his feet and leading him down the long hallway to the room he and Tony shared. When they reached the bed, Steve let go of his hand to casually strip off his robe, before turning to face Bucky. He slowly undressed him, guiding him down onto the large, soft bed when he was done. He turned into Steve’s body, felt arms wrap tight around him. Bucky hid his face in the side of his neck when he felt his cock began to twitch and harden, not wanting to see it. Not wanting to have any part of it.
Steve hid his face again, as the heat of a blush rose in his cheeks.
As requested, the ever popular punishment chapter. A little departure from my normal, but I hope you enjoy anyways. You can thank my wonderful Dom for this chapter being both extra long and extra porny. So probably the only one for the day.
"Tony! I can't go out in public like this!"
And now, onto the fic.
"Yeah." He buried his face into the side of his neck, breathing in the scent of Tony's body. "How do you do that?"
“Yes. Yes, Sir. Please. More. I need… I need…”
Steve’s body trembled as he frantically rubbed the magic spot, feeling spasms inside his passage. There was obviously some connection he didn’t understand between it and his omega gland, which he could feel throbbing almost painfully as he neared release. Just as he was about to tumble over the edge, the restraints on his hands and ankles snapped together, leaving him trapped on his back. His body throbbed, still close to release, but feeling it slowly recede back to his normal state of frustrated arousal as he was unable to do anything to help himself.
"Yes, that's right. My boy's so sensitive back there, isn't he? So sensitive everywhere. I could play with you for hours, Steve. But right now, I have other plans." The fingers leave and return a moment later slick with lube, start rubbing against him before dipping inside. Tony takes his time, slicking him up and working him open. Steve feels dizzy from the pleasure washing through him mixed with the pain from his clamped nipples.
Maybe it was all of the prior health conditions from his past, or the experimental treatments that had been used on him. Either way, he didn’t know. It hadn’t been until he was recovered from the ice that Steve realized how damaged he was. He couldn’t get hard and he couldn’t come. No matter what or how long he tried. Which always led him to frustration and misery, due to all of the other things that meant he would never have.
It took several long moments for Steve to realize that both sensations had stopped. Gentle hands were stroking over his back. He focused past the pounding of his heart in his ears to hear the soft murmur of Tony's voice.
"So, my boy thought he could take what he wanted, instead of asking me nicely?"
"Oh, so much."
“Your choice, remember? Choice one:  I’m going to tease you, edge you up one more time until you’re so close you can taste it, and then we stop cold and go to bed. Some good old fashioned denial. Choice two: I’m going to tease you, edge you up a couple more times until you feel like you’re going to explode, and I’ll let you come. But I’m going to ruin it. Have you ever had a ruined orgasm Steve? I bet it’s something a sweet little masochist like you would love. Those are your choices.”
“Stevie? What the hell are you doing here?”
“Now why would I make it that easy? Besides, you love this. Being my toy. Having every bit of my attention focused just on you. You don’t care if I hurt you or please you, as long as I don’t stop.” A harsh slap landed on Steve’s thigh, making him jolt. “And I want to have some fun.”
Natasha moved closer, studying him. "And you disagreed?"
Tony stroked sweat-damp hair back from his forehead, leaning down to kiss him softly. "Don't worry, sweetheart. This one is just for short term play. Only for tonight. If you're a good boy, it'll come off tomorrow morning and I'll make it up to you."
“Where’s the fun in that?”
He wasn’t sore, but there was a slight tenderness in his muscles from last night that a part of him enjoyed. He was also acutely aware of the cage being off. It was… Unsettling. He had grow accustomed to it’s weight and constant presence. He made a mental note to ask Tony about it later as he turned back towards the tower. Feeling energetic, he took the stairs up to his floor, bursting through the door and coming face to face with a complete stranger.
“I’m sorry Tony…”
Steve was just about to make his suggestion when he was interrupted by Jarvis’s smooth voice. “Captain Rogers, there’s a delivery for you in the elevator.”
Tony smiled. "Better than motor oil and alcohol. Did you use some while I was away?"
Because I couldn't get plot out of my head, have another chapter! Major brownie points to anyone who saw this coming. I'm going to try to catch up on my other story, since there are a few points where plot (what little of it there is) overlaps, so you can look forward to that sometime soon. Comments and suggestions are always welcome. I hope you enjoy!
“It does. Thank you for trusting me to care for your omega.”
So, stress caught up to me and this happens. I’m so sorry! *hides*
Steve immediately turned, leaned forward, bracing himself on his arms, perfect ass lifted high. His thighs glistened in the low light, coated in steadily dripping slick. Tony knelt down, lined himself up and pressed into Steve’s overly sensitive hole. Listened to him gasp and moan as he clenched tightly around each of Tony’s thrusts. Knowing how sensitive his boy got, Tony reached around, gripped his small, soft cock, squeezing and rubbing each time he stroked into him, driving Steve crazy. He whimpered and thrashed beneath Tony’s body, trying to both jerk free from the touch on his overly tender cock while arching his back to encourage Tony to rub against the sensitive glands in his passage.
“That’s why I want this to work,” Tony says, and there are tears in his eyes, tears that he rubs from his eyes. “I fear that if I pushed it, pushed myself, pushed you, that we would crash and burn, and I want this to last, Steve. I want
“How can I admit something to your face that I didn’t even do?”
“Pan-fried,” Tony tells him, clearing up the blanks.
“Be very careful about what you say next,” Tony says, a dangerous edge to his voice.
“You gonna come for me, honey, come inside Tony, make him all wet and sloppy and open with your come?” Steve says, his voice almost as a taunt, as he pounds into him like he’s on a mission.
Toni’s heart thuds against his ribs. “Nothing, nothing at all.”
He drags his hand through his hair.
“Is that why you didn’t tell him about SHIELD?”
“Is he always this blunt?” James asks, curiously.
Tony presses butterfly bandages against each of the cuts. “So, the guy got away?”
Sam swallows, visibly, and there are tears in his eyes. He reaches out to take Steve’s hand, and then, Steve drags him in for an embrace, the shield uncomfortable between them.
“Oh?” Tony lifts an eyebrow.
“Excuse me,” Pepper says, sternly, “can you please start the wedding night on your time? Because there’s a bunch of people, who are sitting here expecting a wedding, and that’s not what you’re giving them right now.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, softly.
“You fucking whore–” Grant snarls, and his backhand snaps across Tony’s face.
Peter makes a face. “Do I?”
“Me too; you are such a good boyfriend,” Toni gushes.
“He’s cheating on me,” Tony repeats, flatly, morosely.
,” Tony flings at him. “I know, okay, I
Tony flinches. “Have I done something to upset you–”
“We shall proceed,” Abraham says, smiling himself, and nods at Tony.
Maushmi doesn’t know how to respond. “What the hell is going on here? Tony, who did this to you?”
He only has himself to blame.
“Hodge, wait, pal, maybe you shouldn’t–”
inspiration.”
The last thing that Tony wanted to be was another corpse for Steve to mourn.
“That was for Natasha.”
Tony’s arm curves in a wide arc. “As you can see, I’m doing great,” he says, dryly.
“Give me the fucking gun. We can’t have a conversation if you two Neanderthals are pointing guns at each other. Give it to me now.”
Tony rolls his eyes, scrubbing at a particularly annoying oil stain in the corner of one of his Pyrex boxes.
Steve shakes his head almost immediately. “What the hell, Tony? No, no, what if the kids came in and saw. We can’t do that,” he says, the colour high in his cheeks. “What’s going on with you?”
“I have never once looked at you or our kids and thought you were less by virtue of the fact that you weren’t white,” Steve says, venomously.
in this together.”
Tony frowns. “You mean yin and yang?”
“Tony–”
Howard steps back, and Tony stares at him.
“You absolutely do not,” Tony warns.
He slips the lingerie off his shoulders, slowly, making sure that Steve can see the swell of his pectorals, the curve of his hips, as it falls to the ground, pooling around his feet, before he’s stepping out of it and kicking it under the bed.
Tony nods, dazed.
“No,” Tony says, heavily.
He pulls his hand out of Steve’s sweatpants and sucks in his fingers into his mouth, dragging over the musky, salty taste of his pre-come.
“I think we all need therapy,” Tony mutters.
Tony scowls, throwing his hands up in the air. “How are you even doing this?” he asks, crossly.
Pepper’s parents are a wreck, her mother crying noisily, while her father clutches onto his wife for dear life.
Steve looks alarmingly charmed. “You thought I was hot?”
“The right partner,” Steve says, after a moment, and when their eyes meet, it’s like a livewire rushing down Tony’s spine, settling between his legs. “I meant,” he says, breathlessly, clearly affected as well, “I meant you could do anything? Why join the army?”
“How could I do ever refuse such a request?” James mutters under his breath but nonetheless crawls over to Tony’s side of the bed.
mine, aren’t you, Tony? Just mine?”
“Steve–”
Toni purses her lips thin.
Steve’s big hand circles his knee. “I am, aren’t I?” he asks, roughly. “God, I’m almost tempted to make you put that lacey, silky thing back on so I can strip it off you all over again.”
“And I’ve spoken to your parents. No school tomorrow. We all think it’s best if you take a little break, relax and rest for a change.”
James offers his upturned palm for Tony to lay his phone in, and he flicks across the screen once Tony’s handed it over, tapping a series of digits into his contacts.
“Hi, Steve,” Tony rasps, his tongue sticking to the roof of his mouth.
There’s a loud smack, and suddenly, the weight is being ripped off him. The hands release him suddenly, and his body slides down the wall. He ends up on the cold, hard ground, still blessedly clothed, arms wrapped around his knees, watching as Agent Carter descends on his assailants, a snarl on her red mouth and a metal staff in her hand.
James blushes. “They, uh, HYDRA, they did stuff to me, injections and other experimentation crap that affects my testosterone levels.”
“Thanks,” Natasha says and sidles in, her every move graceful, like she’s a dancer at heart.
“Is he going to come inside?” Maushmi asks, purposefully.
Steve shuttles right out of the window, and Tony dives for the bed, jams off the light, disappearing under the covers. The door opens, and Jarvis appears in the open frame, bleary-eyed, and he flicks on the light by the door.
Steve drags a hand up and down his body, almost grudgingly. “This would beg to differ.”
“Fuck,” Tony wheezes, turning onto his back, an arm slung over his face to hide it from the sun.
“I like your metal hand,” he says, shyly.
For a few moons, Tony has respite.
And then, Tony sees him, the killer, with his multicoloured sweater, the hat pulled across his face, his portly frame, and he passes through the bar of the cell, something which his girth shouldn’t allow.
“I understand, I just…” James trails off. “I need to get rid of the bugs, Tony, and I’m good with tech stuff, but not that good, not good enough to disable them. That’s why I need your help.”
“But Appa knew you as James,” Peter says, slowly, fixing him with a serious glance.
The sheets are still a little sweaty from their earlier romp, and when she throws one of her legs over his, he can feel his come, sticky against the insides of her thighs.
. That’s what I wanted. So, yeah, I left. I left to
“I’ve noticed that too,” Ms Lewis chimes in.
“Fuck,” Tony gasps out like he’s been punched. He looks around. “Peter! Maushmi?” he calls out, fear a terrible lump in his throat. “Peter? Maushmi?”
“If you don’t mind me staying?” Natasha says, hopefully.
“No.”
“Yeah, yeah, fuck me,” Tony insists. “Fuck me, Rogers. Don’t stop.”
Wanda’s eyes narrow. “You know, I’ve always been really curious; you’re the bottom in the relationship, aren’t you?”
“Why?” Sam asks, curiously.
“Make use of what I’m wearing and make use of me,” Tony admits, smiling coyly.
“With luck, it will put you right out and you won’t feel a thing.”
Steve tells her about SHIELD, how and when he joined, when he met Tony, and how he was told not to say anything, told to keep it a secret. He says it shamefully enough and fully admits, even that early, that he shouldn’t have lied.
He crawls under the covers and settles beside Maushmi and Steve, leaving a space for Tony to take at the edge of the mattress. The bed is just big enough for all four of them, with Steve’s shoulders’ width being what it is, and he turns onto his side once he’s under the quilt, making sure that the twins are adequately tucked in.
“Kitchen,” he instructs and leads the injured man towards the place in question, forcing him to sit on one of the stools.
Then, someone pitches out of the dark at him. Tony yelps and grabs the nearest heavy thing, ready to bash the intruder over the head with a night lamp, but then, Steve’s face looms out of the darkness, balanced precariously on the rose trellis outside his window.
He doesn’t know how Wanda continues to breathe.
Tony glares at him, before storming out himself.
. Being a father is great and it’s significant and I know it’s important, but it’s not the same as what I did in college with Bucky, stopping HYDRA. I just wanted something different, and when James came back, asked me to help him dodge SHIELD, dodge HYDRA, I saw the something different. I wanted the adrenaline. I wanted something that wasn’t cutting the crusts off a cheese sandwich.”
Tony forces himself to breathe, to take long, deep breathes, until he stops seeing red, red and red, and he turns his attention back to the street camera footage.
“Tony? Tony!”
“And he started interrogating him, and I couldn’t tell him about James because I knew what he would say, and then, we got into a fight. And then, we had sex, and it wasn’t just…” he flutters his hand in the air as if trying to use his fingers to explain some of the story. “It wasn’t just sex. It was him proving a point. He was feeling jealous and he was feeling possessive and he wanted me to know that it was only him who could do that to me, make me feel that way. He got a kick out of it, seeing me like that; he’d never… he’d never done that to me, used me and what I was like in bed to make a point. I felt…”
? Are you angry that, maybe, just maybe, I’m not the great fucking househusband you were promised when we had those kids? Are you disappointed in me? Is that it?”
Steve digs his teeth into James’ unmarked shoulder, and James yelps, his thrusts turning into stuttering, jerky, shallow motions that almost feel clumsy to Tony but definitely still do the trick.
Tony cringes, but follows, mostly because he has no other choice – Obadiah, as his father’s second-in-command, had made his feelings clear; he had no intention of caring for his dead liege lord’s omega son, not when he could get to business and begin making alliances with Tony as the thing to be sold to some stranger like a horse.
“Of course not,” Tony scoffs.
, well, he wishes that he’d seen this side of Steve before.
“You have two little kids upstairs,” Steve points out.
.” He bites his lip, giving his husband a heavy, lidded stare. “You want to know what I dream about?”
They come around a corner and come into view of a covey of bats. Tony curses, and Steve glowers at him.
“I understand,” Tony says, softly, tangling their hands together for a fleeting moment, before he withdraws it. “So, Natasha-”
Tony hopes that they died from their wounds the night before.
“Yeah, and I believe him. I believe you both when you say that you haven’t… you know, you haven’t slept together or anything,” Steve begins, awkwardly, running his tongue over the seam of his lips, “but I guess… I don’t know, I guess I’m wondering why you didn’t
“I’m sorry, are you
“An orgasm might help relax you,” Tony says, brazenly, squeezing Steve’s cock, purposefully.
“Yeah,” Steve says, pretending to speak to himself rather than to Tony, directly. “Yeah, I think I’ll fuck you.”
“Shirt off,” he orders.
He kisses Tony, sliding his tongue into his mouth, curling behind his teeth, with a lot more confidence than Tony would have expected from the man who entered this hotel room with him. Tony slings his arms around Steve’s shoulders, and he gasps, when Steve’s hands fall to his bare thighs.
Maushmi’s face turns a blotchy red with fury, and she picks up the nearest cushion, ready to throw it with all of her strength at her brother, until Steve intervenes quickly, lifting Maushmi off James’ knee and into his arms so that she can calm down.
Tony’s cock is hard between his legs, curving against his belly, and Steve neatly avoids it, before he decides to focus all of his attention on it. He curls a hand around the base, and Tony lets out a low whine in his throat. Steve strokes quickly, firmly, his eyes hot on Tony’s, and there’s a pressure building low in his belly. Tony fists his hands in the sheets, the tendon in his throat going taut against his skin, and his mind is hazy, the fire spreading from his stomach into his fingers and toes and his throat.
“You okay?” Steve asks, worriedly.
Tony reaches out, ignoring how his cock twitches almost painfully against his stomach, and runs his palm over Steve’s shaven cheek.
Tony hates that, hates that they’re talking about him like he isn’t even in the room, as though he isn’t even a person, just a goat, to be bought and sold, traded and bartered over, in terms of advantages and disadvantages, benefits and detriments, as though that is the sum total of his being.
“I’m not going to hurt you, Tony,” Natasha says, calmly.
Tony grimaces. “Nothing special,” he says, vaguely.
“We should, uh,” Steve’s voice is rough, gravelly, the words grudging, “we should take him away from here.”
Tony gapes at what he finds.
“That’s because I’m kind of a dick,” Tony says, honestly.
“Stop it,” Steve says, sternly, the lines around his mouth thinning.
Disgust lines his voice at the idea of Natasha Romanoff and her bright auburn hair and her beautiful, mysterious smile, her
“What do you want to do with that?”
James nods, his brow creasing.
in the middle of it all,” Tony points out. “You jackass,” he says, scathingly. “I helped you kill terrorists who were trying to poison water supplies in Massachusetts, remember?” He pauses. “You know, I never understood why terrorists would want to poison the water in Massachusetts,” he muses.
“It was hard for me,” Tony admits. “It’s
“Come on, Steve,” he murmurs, nudging his nose against the hollow of Steve’s throat. “Do you know how long it’s been? I know we have kids but that doesn’t mean our sex life needs to die in a ball of flame, does it?”
One of the Nazis hits him again, and the pain explodes across one half of his face, where the Nazi’s palm strikes. His cheek is hot, hotter than the sun could make it when the Nazi steps away.
“Okay, then,” Steve says, clipped, and drags the seatbelt to cover him and Peter, while Tony follows suit with him and Maushmi.
“No,” Tony says, pleased. “What
Tony clenches his eyes shut, before he grapples for the photos, shoving them into his hands.
Caroline’s throat flexes.
Steve’s thrusts slow, and it wrings a high, desperate noise from the back of Tony’s throat.
“Won’t take that much,” Steve grunts, “with you being so fucking desperate for my cock, your tight fucking cunt, all sloppy like this.”
Tony cranes his ear.
. You don’t need to be happy about it; hell, I’m not happy about the way that it went down, but maybe, now, we can help each other out.”
!” Tony roars, and when he’s done, when the sound is finally in the air, he’s breathing hard and his lungs are stretching painfully at the edges. “I have
Tony grins at him.
to last. I have never had anything, never had anything that could be mine,
“If I knew that, you think I’d still be running this place?” Tony demands.
Steve laughs, tipping his head back and exposing the pale, lean line of his throat. He kisses Tony swiftly on the side of his head and makes his way towards the stairs.
“Why don’t you fellows come down here? I’ll show you,” Steve calls out, angrily.
“I don’t think you want to finish that sentence,” Tony cuts over him, with daggers in every word.
She takes a seat on the couch beside him, and she lifts him up into her lap, so that he can wrap his small arms around her shoulders.
“I thought you hightailed it here to find
“As long as you’ve eaten,” he replies, mollified. “Am I still a good boyfriend?”
His eyes find Steve, who is busy fighting a legion of Outriders, Thor’s hammer in one hand and his splintered shield in the other, and Tony thinks,
“Yes,” Steve says, softly, patiently.
you that I’m not sleeping with him-”
Suddenly, Steve jerks in his seat.
He sinks down onto Steve’s cock until he’s fully seated, with the thatch of pubic hair at the base of Steve’s cock scratching against the insides of his thighs.
It should be obvious.
“Yeah–” He clears his throat. “Yes, I will, of course, I will, I’d love to share your heat with you.”
Tony looks around, and his eyes close on Bhim and his men being held at bay by ten armed Nazis.
“Tony, I didn’t tell you this to make you feel guilty.”
Sam’s face floods with colour.
. Stupid, because you didn’t tell me about her, tell me about this beautiful woman that you worked with, a woman who clearly knew you well enough to touch you the way she did, to talk to you with all that blatant flirting, like someone who’s seen you naked, and I couldn’t… you made me feel
“Is Aunt Wanda okay?” he asks in a low, hushed voice. “When we last saw her, she was on the ground and she wasn’t moving. Is she dead now?”
Instead, he slides a hand across the sheets, hoping that he seems adequately seductive but not too wanton such that Lord Steven begins to wonder whether he has bonded with a virgin or a whore.
He brought a fucking army from 2014 to get the infinity stones from them and kill them all, so he’s pretty fucking determined, in Tony’s opinion.
“It’s what people do, when they find something that’s more important than the family that they’ve already got,” Tony drawls.
!” Tony snaps. “I’m the father of your children. I don’t know, I hate that you make me feel this way, Steve. I hate that you make me feel possessive and jealous like this, irrationally jealous on top of it, but I can’t help but feel like you shouldn’t be defending her, not when she’s… she’s the cause of so much of all the
Steve closes his eyes.
“Lost what?”
Tony nods, stiffly. “Sometimes, I… I don’t know, maybe it’s silly, maybe I’m overreacting or just being selfish, but I feel that Steve could be a complete deadbeat dad and still get more love from the kids than I do. I feel like they take me for granted,” he says, honestly.
me, that he wasn’t my punching bag. It’s the advice he would have given to anyone in his group at the VA.”
friends. Too much has happened between us, but… it’s hard.”
Tony licks his lips. “Is this SHIELD? Has… has SHIELD asked you to get rid of me?”
Steve scowls and makes to lunge to his feet, but Tony reaches out, winds a hand around his wrist, pinning him in place.
would you say if we said that we loved James too, and we wanted him to stay with us forever?”
Steve sighs and puts a hand on his shoulder. “You’ll be safe here, I promise,” he says, earnestly. “I know, this isn’t what I wanted at all. We’ve… we’ve only just recently been bonded, and I confess, I’m not good at this courting business, but we should be able to spend more time together. This isn’t how I wanted it to go, but if it’s your safety that you’re worried about, you needn’t be worried. Bucky will have to come with me, of course, as the captain of my guards, and he’s my best soldier, but Grant will remain here. He’s a competent fighter, of course, so you’ll be safe with him, but he’s not suited for war. Natasha will also remain, so you will not be bereft without company either. I know that you and Grant get along quite well, so I hope that will make your days a little brighter.”
“Okay, so, ideally speaking, Scott’s plan would work. I mean, we would go back to 2018, to the day that Thanos and his children came to Earth to fight us for the stones, and maybe, with all of us there knowing what was about to happen, we’d be able to tilt the odds in our favour and stop Thanos from snapping his fingers.”
I am with you, I am very glad that you came back,” he says, his voice muffled.
He’s not Steve.
Tony climbs to his feet and offers his hand to the beautiful redhead that his husband couldn’t stop looking at. “Hi, nice to meet you,” he says, kindly.
“Don’t worry, baby, I’ll give you what you want,” Steve growls.
“Captain,” he drawls, landing at the bar.
“So… uh, you work at the insurance company with Steve?” Tony asks, a little confused by the idea of a redhead who looks like her working at an insurance company unless they
Tony pounds on the window until his hands are aching, his knuckles are bleeding, and then, turns in frustration and yells into the night.
Tony nods, even if his chest hurts at Sam’s declaration. “I understand.”
Steve sighs. “Because if her father never died, she never had a reason to save him. It becomes a vicious circle,” he says, wearily, pinching the bridge of his nose. “And if we went back in time to stop Thanos from snapping his fingers, there’s never a reason for us to go back in time in the first place. It would be a paradox, and there would be time demons floating everywhere and removing us from the space-time continuum.”
Tony bares the razor line of his teeth.
“Like the fear that your husband was having an affair,” Eshe guesses.
There’s a cock pressed up against his rim, as soon as Steve withdraws his fingers, and Tony lifts his head, the heat of lust making his head spin.
Howard’s lips are frowning-thin. “You should go and pack your things,” he grunts. “Go, now, get out of my sight.”
Steve has even more gaping holes – Sam would have been his best man, or even Bucky, and Natasha and maybe even Wanda would have been
Tony’s name never comes up linked with Grant, which he thanks the gods for, but it doesn’t help knowing that he wasn’t Grant’s only victim, just his last.
“Is that okay?” Steve asks, worriedly.
“Yeah, so, uh, well, a few days ago, Bucky and Steve asked me to marry them.”
Steve groans and covers his face with his hand. “I didn’t mean-”
“Which leaves only one other explanation, of course,” Tony goes on, the agony a bright-hot, living thing all over his body. “It means that he’s in love with her, that he wants to be with her, that he’s just too much of a coward to tell me or he just hasn’t gotten around to it, because I don’t matter anymore, my feelings don’t matter.”
“There’s this hole-in-the-wall place in Brooklyn, actually,” Steve says, embarrassed. “I think you’ll like it. Their pizzas are amazing, and they’re massive, and their pastas are bottomless. I checked the menu just in case, and they do make food that you can eat.”
He lingers behind the curtain, behind the spectacle that his sire makes, bright lights and bright eyes and the white man in awe, designing and building and creating the things that keep their troops safe, mouthing to himself the words that his sire says that makes the crowd fall in love with them.
Tony looks over, his lungs in his throat, and he can see a sheen of tears in James’ pale eyes. James rubs the heels of his hands over them, sniffling slightly.
“Fuck off,” Tony barks. “Wanda’s my friend, and I know her, I know she would have put herself between whoever came after the kids and the kids. She’s hurt
Pepper shrugs. “I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; he                      walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of… like those guys on the bus who stare at your legs? Then he walked out through the wall on the other side.  Like he'd just come to check me out...” she trails off.
slept with him, and you didn’t tell me that. You’ve been running out of here to meet this guy, so how the fuck do I know that you two haven’t rekindled whatever it is that you had before-”
PhDs, and you were simultaneously writing theses for four other doctorates. You were the most terrifyingly intelligent and capable person I’d ever met. You were on your way to becoming one of the richest men in the world, the CEO of an insanely large company. Your life… there was nothing that I could give you that would match that. There was nothing that I could give you that would make you feel like you’d given up something
“Bhim!” Tony calls out.
“Tony, normally, when we’re having sex, I like you talking, but right now, it’s really, really killing the mood. Can you just shut up and make out with me?” Steve says, frustration bleeding through his voice.
Beside him, Steve’s scent is thick, warm, comforting, heady, an alpha that he likes, that he wants – not all alphas smell like him.
Steve and Phillips lock eyes, and Steve smiles, clearly finding whatever he needed to.
Steve groans, and his hips jerk forward.
“He… had an access code,” JARVIS says, surprised, as if he hadn’t been expecting that himself.
“Dwārakā,” Bhim replies.
Peter nods. “Yeah, Steve draws with me and lets me play with his paints, and Bucky takes me flying,” he tells her, completely chuffed that they would do this for him.
, looking as you do, and string bean me
Tony sinks his teeth into his lower lip, showing a hint of a pearl-cut smile, and then, he nods.
“Bullshit,” Tony retorts.
Steve’s brow furrows. “But you’ve been with so many people-” he stumbles over his words, turning bright red. “Shit, I didn’t mean to imply that-”
happening, because what Tony is experiencing right now is a slow death, but a death, nonetheless.
His lungs feel like someone went at them with a meat tenderizer, like someone’s gone in and wrenched them out completely, leaving empty, burning rents in his chest cavity. His stomach curdles in fear and nausea, and he bites back the urge to vomit.
Tony feels a thrill deep in his bones, settling in a bolt of heat between his legs.
“You are such a fucking creep,” Tony accuses, but softens when Steve takes him back in his arms.
In the photo, Steve is deflecting gunfire with a starred car door.
Sorry about the angsty cliffhanger. Yesterday was not a great day. On the plus side, you got two chapters?
He spent some time thinking after the call ended. Kept coming back to the same thing. Bucky had never lied to him. He slid the tablet over, began searching. The first thing he learned was that the world wide omega rebellion their parents had always talked about had never existed. It wasn’t covered up, otherwise there wouldn’t be anything there. Steve found mentions of the protest that had resulted in Bucky’s capture, as well as several others from the past. Easy to find, because in society it just… Wasn’t important. Omegas in general were happy with their lives.
Another chapter, this time with a heavy helping of soft boys being soft. Brownie points to anyone who catches the Rent reference. If you enjoyed this one, let me know in the comments!
“And can I trust this person? Do they mean me any harm?”
Steve’s eyes widened in horror. Not only had he treated his alpha horribly at every turn, but he’d made the man feel as though it was his fault. He was going to send Steve away. Send him to live with Bucky and his mate. Instead of disciplining him, his alpha was going to punish himself. Stay away from Steve and spend his time alone. “Please. Please, alpha. Don’t… Don’t do this. Don’t send me away. Please. I’ll be good. I’ll be so good. I promise…”
"Thank you, Tony. I love you."
Steve shifted against Tony's body. His nipples were still sore. He could feel his cock pulsing desperately against the metal cage, sending waves of agonized want through his body. His ass clenched around the plug, pressing it deeper inside of him, making him shudder. It was overwhelming, and intense, and so fucking good. "No Tony. I'm alright. It's..."
“Yes Tony.”
We have a new chapter! As always, all mistakes are my own, and comments are always welcome. I have not written smut in a very long time, so be patient with me. Tags will be updated as the story progresses.
Tony allowed him some space after they’d left, a chance to think over the conversation, not interrupting him until it was time for bed. Unlike the last few nights, Tony didn’t fuck him before bed. He attached the wrist cuffs to the harness, the ankle cuffs were fastened to each other, and then he pulled Steve into his arms and went to sleep.
"Tony... Please? Am I done?"
Is that what Tony wanted? To take him home for a night, then pretend it had never happened? Or did he want something more than that? Earlier, he had said that Steve was his. Like he owned him. His property.
“I… You’re gone, and I feel… Empty, alpha.”
That lightheaded drunken feeling from the restaurant had returned. It felt like the world was spinning around him. Part of him wanted to refuse, to laugh it off as a joke, and forget this part of the night had ever happened. But a stronger part of him, the part that liked the feelings Tony drew out of him, that part wanted to keep playing. To see where this went. "Yes Tony." He whispered.
"Absolutely perfect, sweetheart. My prototype passed all of the preliminary tests with flying colors. Started a longer functionality study this morning, and so far it seems to be a success."
“I did.”
The pleasure built, distracting him from the pain for a while. The longer it went on, the more his hole clenched, desperate to be filled, leaking slick all over the surface of the machine. Steve didn’t notice the whimpers and cut off moans that were falling regularly from his lips as he attempted to grind down. His body tensed, the muscles in his legs stiffening. Steve could almost feel the gland tucked above his entrance harden, sending a bolt of pain up through him before it released. A rush of come dripped from the cage, once again without the accompanying pleasure.
Tony waited until he’d calmed before he continued. “I thought about denying you. Keeping you dosed with an inhibiting agent for days. Watching you go crazy trying to get off. Maybe even letting you out of your cage, just to watch you stroke your little cocklet, trying to get hard, and knowing you won’t be able to. I could lock you back up just before it wore off. Make you beg me to let you come…” Steve’s muscles tensed. He could envision everything Tony was describing, and it would work. It would be hell, and he would become a desperate, sobbing wreck. And if Tony had decided to do something else, that meant the something else was going to be even worse.
The man in the holding room was breathtaking. Golden hair gleamed under the lights. Smooth, lightly tanned skin was on display, as the omega hadn’t been allowed the privilege of clothing. As Tony’s eyes ran over the well muscled chest and thighs, he thought it might be a shame to ever allow that body to be covered. The omega had taken no notice of the two men standing in the hall, continuing his attempts to force the door open and secure his release.
The increased pressure on his soft cock felt almost like a caress in his current state. Steve struggled to his feet, gracelessly stumbling down the track. Each movement of the dildo was torture, stimulating his already sensitive body. It took even less time than before for release to crash over his body. Steve cried out, locking his knees to keep from falling again. Whimpers accompanied every movement, and he could feel his alpha’s eye tracking him around the room.
“There you go. You took that so well, pet. And it’s all better now, isn’t it? All I have to do is activate it, and then you get your reward.” Steve turned his head to watch Tony, desperate for the other man’s reassurance. His eyes flared the same shade of blue as the arc reactor and Steve felt a brief pulse from deep inside. A soft vibration inside of his prostate. Then Tony’s eyes returned to their normal dark brown. “Ready, baby?”
“I’m sorry, Steve. This is for your own good. But I’ll try to be gentle. Bruce said this one shouldn’t be too bad. It won’t even hurt much after a while, okay? And I’ll give you plenty of breaks.”
“Oh, sweetheart. That must have been terrible. And you haven’t… Been with anyone since?”
Tony laughed. “Smart boy. Fuck I love you.”
"Strip baby."
"Yes sweetheart?"
“You’re welcome, pet. This has all been so overwhelming for you, hasn’t it?” Steve nodded. “And I know I’m not making it any easier on you. But I want to give you a chance to prove yourself to me. You want that, don’t you?
The restraints were released, the clamps removed from his nipples, and he was drawn down into Tony's arms, curled up in his lap, surrounded once again with his presence. "Tony..."
Without any other recourse, he reached between his spread thighs and began rubbing firmly at the stretch of skin between his caged cock and plugged entrance. It always felt good when Tony did it, though Steve usually avoided the area, not wanting to think about what had been there prior to his imprisonment. He increased the pressure on the area, moaning in pleasure. His hips rolled up into his own touch as he chased the release he’d been desperately needing for days.
“But.. You were… You were hurt. I know you were. I saw it.”
As soon as the thought crossed his mind, the plug buzzed to life, pulsing directly against his prostate, causing his body to jerk hard enough that he had to grab the desk to keep from falling on the floor. Thank God he was alone. The relentless vibrations made him moan, a rush of blood going directly to his cock, making it swell within the confines of the cage, creating a steady ache. He pressed the heel of his hand against it, trying to will his body to calm with no luck. His phone chimed at the same time the speed of the vibrations increased.
Steve blinked at him dumbly. “How the hell do you have a date?”
He wore the suit. The blue one that Tony had... Mentioned? Told him to wear? Steve wasn't entirely sure, but he wore it all the same. He was standing in his living room, uncertain what he should be doing with himself, waiting for Tony to pick him up for their date. His first date since... Best not to think of that.
Just before noon, Steve took the elevator down to Tony's office. It was strange seeing him behind the large desk. He was more used to seeing the other man bustling around his workshop helping to create the future. But he looked good, in his tailored suit, radiating power and poise throughout the room. Steve closed the door behind him and took the seat Tony gestured him to. "Food should be here in a few minutes, but I wanted to talk to you first."
"What do you think, sweetheart? Want to watch a show?"
There was no response as the first trickles of cool liquid began to fill him. But as the amount increased, it began to make it’s presence know. Steve let out a soft gasp, began shifting slightly on his knees, shuddering as he became aware of the chill saline flooding his intestines. He shivered, whining softly, and Tony shushed him. Offering affection in exchange for the discomfort he was causing him. As the amount inside of him grew, the first hint of a bulge stretching Steve’s flat stomach, Tony brought his cock to full hardness.
“Of course. I’ll bring it by later.” It always made him feel a little small and shy when Tony said things like that. As if for just a moment he was the same man who needed to be cared for and protected, the way he was before the serum. The way Bucky used to.
He pressed harder against the muscle, groaning when the single digit breached him, hips unconsciously rocking back into it. Steve worked the finger in and out, flexing the knuckle to loosen himself, moving up to two fingers at Tony's next order, scissoring them to stretch himself open.
Steve obediently rose from his lap. “Yes Tony.”
He nodded in resignation, allowed himself to be led back into the living room. Tony settled him on the couch, grabbing a plate of sandwiches before returning to sit next to him. Steve was docile and distracted as he fed him. After they’d eaten, Tony laid them back on the couch and cued up a few movies, holding Steve close, allowing his presence to calm him.
Steve wasn't sure how such a simple touch could be undoing him so thoroughly. Maybe it was because he hadn't been touched in so long. Or maybe it was the confidence in every move Tony made. He was playing with Steve, alright, but the rules of the game were beyond his reach.
Steve flinched minutely when the elevator stopped, hiding his expression almost immediately and following Tony onto the floor that had been prepared for his Steve Rogers. Tony glanced around the space. Everything was utilitarian, with an emphasis on function rather than comfort. Hard lines and sharp angles.
"Good. Now Steve, grab the blue container from under the bed, strip, and get comfortable for me."
“So good for me. Even when I’m so mean to you. Okay, sweetheart. It’s almost time.” The plug cut off abruptly, leaving him disoriented. A second later the cage clicked and slid free. Instantly his cock was hard and throbbing, dripping onto the floor beneath him. He tried to move, to rub against something, anything. But Tony had planned this too well. There was nothing anywhere near his cock. Not even a hint of touch.
When he got back to the living room another red cushion was waiting on the floor by Tony's feet. Steve sank to his knees and looked up at the older man hopefully. Tony carded his fingers through his hair, studying him. "You have been so fucking sweet for me, haven't you?"
“I absolutely can. We need to do it at some point anyway. It’ll be better for you after you adapt to the cage, shrink down a bit. Then you’ll be more focused on releasing like you’re supposed to, and not trying to come like an alpha. Now, move. You know the consequences.”
“Steve, I’m warning you. I will not tolerate anyone talking about my omega like that. Not even you. I don’t want to punish you in your hospital bed, but I will.” Tony’s voice was hard, demanding. A part of Steve wanted to roll out of the bed, drop to his knees, and offer the other man everything.
Steve’s mind drifted to someone he did know who felt like that. Bucky. Bucky who was always so strong and kind and loyal. Bucky who had never lied to Steve once in their entire lives. He said they had been wrong. That he was happy now. Steve didn’t want to admit he could be right. It would mean his entire life had been a failure. He had fought for nothing.
When Steve had finally calmed, he turned his teary gaze up to Tony’s face. He felt broken down in an entirely new way. His cock throbbed. Denied pleasure made him ache with need. “Tony… Alpha. Please?”
Tony reached out and took his hand. Gently stroked his fingers over the back until he began to relax. "Nothing to be sorry for, gorgeous. Are you alright? Is this too much?"
Tony’s hand came up, rubbing roughly at the surface of the cage. “What is it you want, sweetheart?”
“I think it’s late, and it’s been a miserable fucking day. How would you feel about a long hot bath? JARVIS could order us something to eat after, and then we could go to bed and start over in the morning.”
Tony shook his head sadly. "I'm starting to think you don't want to come at all tonight, Steve. Otherwise, you'd be trying harder. Over the counter."
“I never told you to stand, pet.” Steve immediately dropped back down to his knees. He was rewarded by gentle fingers carding through his hair. “Good boy. You won’t be needing those again. The only clothes you will wear are the ones I choose to let you have. When I allow you to be dressed at all.” Cool metal seemed to flow around Steve’s neck, wrapping around his throat before solidifying into a solid band. It was snug enough to be a constant reminder, but not tight enough to affect his breathing. A small kindness. “Your collar will allow me to know where you are and what you’re doing at all times. It will also prevent you from leaving the property without my permission.”
When he was completely buried in Bucky’s body, Tony paused, tangled a hand in his hair and pulled his head back. Tony’s lips brushed softly over his, another claim that Bucky was eager to offer up. Tony began to move inside of him, holding him in place, dark eyes focused on his face. Watching him slowly build to another devastating orgasm, trembling in his grasp. Bucky could feel his balls tighten, cock throbbing relentlessly against the metal. He was sore inside, unused to penetration. His prostate overworked and aching. But Tony obviously wanted him to come again, so that’s what he would do.
Steve went limp beneath his touch, staying there as Tony moved across the bed, retrieving a box from the side table that he hadn't noticed earlier. He watched as Tony pulled out a complicated tangle of metal. The front was recognizable as a cage, like the one he normally wore. Attached to it was a curved metal bar with a large round ball on the end.
Another sharp slap. "No. Try again."
"You're a lucky boy. I'm going to be so sweet to you today. Let you come as many times as you like, you don't even have to ask. Say thank you, Steve."
"Do you want me to stop?"
Tony shrugged, spearing one of the vegetables and studying it speculatively. “Not really, no. Especially not when I-“ He stopped, glanced at Steve and cleared his throat. “Never mind.”
Tony drew him up into his lap, one arm wrapped securely around his waist as he began kissing him again, mouth occasionally sliding away to press kisses over his cheek or down his jaw as Steve struggled to draw in breath. He moaned when Tony’s mouth slid across the curve of his neck, feeling hotter as it rubbed over his bonding bite. The feeling of teeth scraping over the sensitive skin made him shudder and clench inside.
*           *           *
"In that case." Tony stepped up, sweeping Steve up in a bridal carry before launching into the air and flying them back to the tower. He set the blonde down carefully on the landing platform before shedding his armor. Even his flight suit was soaked in the goo. "Shower. Hot. Now."
Steve was lifted gently and carried to bed, surrounded by the comforting scent of his alpha. A warm body pressed against his back, arms wrapped comfortingly around his waist. He tried to say something in gratitude as a soft blanket was pulled over him and tucked around his shoulders, but the gag prevented him from speaking. Even a look of thanks was beyond Steve’s ability, eyes too heavy to open. But apparently his alpha understood anyway, judging from the soft nuzzle and kiss to his bond mark that Steve felt just before exhaustion finally claimed him.
“Fuck you taste so good, sweetheart. I love running my mouth all over you.” He stroked his hair as Steve cried, making soft shushing sounds. “It’s okay, baby. We’re almost done. Maybe if you take your punishment like a good boy, I’ll let you blow me while I’m being sweet to you after. Would you like that?”
“Did my pretty boy like that?”
"Alright, sweetheart. Come here." He pulled Steve's head down to his shoulder, gently rubbing his back. "That's better. Take your time."
“Tony…?”
“See what you do to me, my good boy? I’m going to have you again, because I just can’t help myself. Then, after I’m done, I’m going to plug you up, trap all of that come inside of you, marking you as mine.  After that, I’m going to have you put on a show for me. And then I’m going to give you a choice. It’s not going to be a nice choice, but I think you like that, sweetheart. I think you get off on it. Don’t you?”
"I- I, umm..."
“There. All better now?” Tony waited for Steve to nod before he continued. “And what have you learned today?”
“Yes Boss.”
“Yes.”
"Give me just a moment. Gotta get you ready. Have to take care of you."
Tony forced him over the edge over and over again, leaving Steve trembling and sobbing in agony. The burning didn't stop, seemed to get worse as his passage swelled around the intrusion. He came again, a soft beeping sound barely heard over the cries falling from his lips.
Tony gripped his hips, pushing him onto his hands and knees before pulling back so Steve’s hole was displayed in front of him. “Look at you. So pretty and needy. Am I the luckiest alpha in the world or what? And look at this…” His voice shifted to a low growl, hand sliding up to cup the neat package the cage had made of Steve’s cock and balls, tightly compressed and curled back so it was barely noticeable from the right angle. “So fucking pretty. And watching you release like that, over and over like you’re supposed to. Made me want to eat you alive Steve.”
“I’ve told you how the day is going to go. What do you do, omega?” His voice was steely, unwavering.
Kisses were mixed in with the touches next, a press on his shoulder, his jaw. Gentle suction on a nipple that made Steve moan softly. Fingertips stroking up his inner thigh, close enough to almost touch his cock before moving away. A brief caress of his balls, making them throb. Soft nips along the side of his neck. Warming his skin, causing his hips to shift restlessly against the bed.
Tony led them down the hall to the doorways of their rooms before reluctantly letting go of his hand. “You can stay in here. This is my room right next door. If you need anything…” Tony paused, uncertain of how much trust he was willing to extend to this man, then shook his head. This wasn’t Rogers. This was Steve. Soft, submissive, eager to please Steve. “If you need anything, you can come wake me up.”
They stayed that way for a long time, enjoying the closeness, before Tony soaped up a soft rag and began to tenderly clean all of the sweat and come from Steve’s skin. He was practically purring by the time the other man finished, eyes half lidded and heavy with exhaustion.
“Yes, alpha.”
Steve closed his eyes, slowly nodded. "It was... So intense, Tony. Nothing's ever felt like that before."
“I do… The papers mentioned her. Said you tossed her aside and broke her heart. Had some sort of scandal right after.”
Steve had barely stirred when Tony slipped out of bed early in the morning for a round of meetings. He’d heard the other man moving around the room, felt a soft kiss pressed to his forehead, and exhaustion had pulled him back down for several more hours. When he did finally get up, he took a quick shower, grabbed a cup of coffee and headed outside for a run.
“You said… You said I’d get a choice, but it wouldn’t be a good one.”
Tony’s voice was hard, vicious. And Bucky knew he deserved every word. He dropped to his knees, bowed his head, waiting for his own execution. There was a sense of relief there, underneath it all. It was finally over. He was finally done. “I’m sorry… So sorry…”
“Of course. Thanks Bruce. You’re a lifesaver.”
A sharp slap landed on his thigh, startling him and causing him to stop his frantic motion. "No."
The alpha didn’t plug him afterwards and when he straightened up, he felt a trickle of come slide from his hole and dribble down his leg. Steve tried to catch the man’s eyes but was ignored. “Use the bathroom and do whatever else you need to get ready for bed, then come back.”
"Yeah?"
“That’s… Not nice.” The words came out as a gasp. Tony released him suddenly and Steve collapsed back against the bed, breath heavy as though he had just finished a run. He dimly heard the sounds of Tony moving around the penthouse before returning to the bedroom.
"That's my job. I take care of you."
Steve set his fork down, full attention on the other man. "Steve."
The towel he chose was slightly rough, just enough to set Steve even more on edge as it rasped over every inch of bare skin, multiple times as Tony murmured something about being thorough before Steve lost the thread of the conversation. He felt his feet leave the floor again, and was soon deposited onto the bed, spread out before Tony’s hungry gaze. “I really should be nice to you. Get the cage off, check you over, get you off nice and gentle, and give you a rest before I lock you up again. Is that what you want, sweetheart? Should I be nice to my good boy? Reward him for everything he did for me earlier?”
"I'm sorry! I was just worried about you."
Bucky nodded, letting his head fall forward again. He didn’t know what to do. Who to be anymore. Had come there to end it. And now that wasn’t happening. He felt so lost. “I understand…”
"It reminds me of you."
Steve curled tight into the corner of the couch, arms wrapped around his shins. His voice came out soft and wavering. “Even… Even when he hurts you…?”
“Yes, Tony. I mean it. Anything you want.”
"Gorgeous. But I think you have a little too much on. Why don't you stand up and let me help with that?" Without waiting for an answer he was tugging Steve to his feet, stripping him and carelessly tossing his clothes across the room. It didn't take long before he was standing there in nothing but the cage around his cock.
“A brief demonstration, so you know what will the consequences will be if you try.” Nothing happened for a moment, then a current of electricity poured through Steve. He screamed as the pain sent him collapsing to the ground, struggling for breath as his body spasmed uncontrollably. It stopped a moment later, and he scrambled back to his knees, muscles twitching with the aftershocks. “Need I say more?”
“What did he do?”
"Out of the cage?"
"I think that's enough for the night."
"Not... Not yet?"
He kept his eyes glued to the numbers on the clock, watching them tick down slowly, too slowly, as Tony played with the remote. He was constantly adjusting the strength and speed of the vibrations, pushing him closer and closer to a release that he couldn't quite achieve. Precum was pouring out of him, running in slick ribbons over his thighs, soaking the sheets beneath him.
“How… How much more is there?”
Once everything was in place, Tony released the valve, allowing the saline mixture to flow down through the plug and into Steve’s body. With as wide as he was stretched, not even a drop would be able to escape. Tony settled on the bed in front of him, wanting to have a good view of both Steve’s face and stomach. He urged Steve to brace on his forearms, offering a hint of comfort, and began to stroke his hair. Steve nuzzled into his touch, eager for even the smallest scrap of affection. It was no hardship. Tony wanted to touch him. Run his hands over every inch of Steve’s body. Offer him pleasure and pain for his adoration. This Steve would never betray him. Tony would make sure of it.
"Okay. Then that's what we'll do. You come only when I tell you to, or you get punished."
Tony kept his touch soft and careful, building Steve slowly to his first release. He waited until the soft cries had gained in volume, the body beneath his hands and mouth trembling. Steve wasn’t very good at hiding his reactions, a fact Tony took advantage of regularly. He waited for the slight hitch in Steve’s breathing signaling that he’d reached his peak. As soon as he heard it, Tony let go and leaned back, watching come dribble from Steve’s small, soft cock onto the floor.
“No Tony.”
The pleasure tightened his stomach, made his body clench harder around Tony’s cock. He continued to thrust through the resistance of Steve’s body, sending sparks of pleasure shooting up his spine. Steve felt the edge creeping up on him, certain he would crash over any moment. But nothing happened. He stroked himself faster, rocking down into Tony’s thrusts, felt his cock throbbing inside of him, the knot popping to stretch his rim wide, locking them together. He could feel pulses of come filling him as Tony groaned through his own release.
"That's right baby. Keep going."
Steve's breath left him in a sigh. "Very much."
“That’s okay, sweetheart. I know this is hard. Thank you for telling me. I’m assuming that before the serum, you got hard and jerked off when you wanted to come, which is why it’s been so difficult for you after?”
Steve closed his eyes as he felt his cock throb in his pants. It was as though no time at all had passed between the moment Tony left him last night and right now. His skin felt tight, and his breathing sped up.
After he was done, Tony stepped into his body, wrapped his arms around him holding him close. "That's my good boy." He gripped Steve's hips, pulling them into his own, grinding them together, until Tony came with a moan.
Bruce burst into the room, shoving Steve out of the way and gathering Loki into his lap, arms wrapped tightly around him. As soon as his face was buried against his shoulder, Loki broke into shattered sobs. "It's alright, darling. I'm here. I'm here..."
“It’s… It’s afternoon. You’re… You’re not going to leave me like this for the rest of the day.”
Tony moved behind him, he could hear the sound of a cabinet being opened. When he returned, he moved in front of Steve and began to play with his nipples, tugging and pinching until they were hard and throbbing before reaching into his pocket and pulling out a pair of clamps with metal weights hanging from the bottom. He attached it to one of his nipples, pinching it tightly, carelessly letting the weight drop afterward. Ignoring the harsh cry it caused and repeating the process on the other side. As soon as he had finished, the plug began to vibrate again, causing Steve to jerk in the restraints. The motion made the weights pull, nipples beginning to throb under the cruel pressure.
Steve felt the cool touch of plastic at his rim before wetness flooded into him, dripping back out and down his crack. Tony tossed the lube shooter aside and picked up something he had tucked out of sight. The metal was cold as it pressed against him, slid deep into his passage in one stroke. Almost too deep, and he clenched around it trying to force it back out. The dildo was massive, stretching him open, making him feel like it was going to split him in half. And then it was thrust into him further, so far the line between pain and pleasure was blurring around him. He could no longer tell if he wanted it pressing deeper or pulled out entirely.
"Yeah... That was... Wow."
"Yes!"
“You’re wrong!” Steve fought harder, straining to free himself, glaring daggers at the smug man standing before him. “I won’t do this! I won’t give in, do you understand me?”
“I- I think so…?”
"Steve, there isn't anything that I wouldn't do for you."
"Okay. We're only going to do ten. And since this is your first time, I won't even make you count. Get ready."
Firm pressure was followed by the welcome sensation of Tony's cock pressing deep and bottoming out inside of him. Steve moaned as fingers dug tight enough into his hips to bruise, pulling him back into each thrust, setting up a quick rhythm. Everything was fast and hard, just on the edge of painful. Exactly what he wanted. He lost himself in the slap of skin against skin, the jolt of agonizing pleasure when his prostate was slammed into. It was perfect.
“How are you, how are you feeling?” Steve asks, braving a step forward beyond the threshold of the room.
“Oh.” Peter’s throat works. “I love them too,” he says, shyly.
Tony goes back into the hall, before he pauses at a door marked as
“Are you allergic to any medicine?” the second nurse asks, kindly.
Tony looks at Pepper, sharply. “Hey, did you have a nightmare too?” he demands.
Toni pauses. “I don’t know how I feel about the fact that one of the only two people that this eighteen-year-old girl likes is the guy I’m about to marry.” She pauses. “Is she pretty?”
“What, you think they left me in a good way? There wasn’t a rupee left when they were gone. Guess how I lived, Mister Rogers? I worked here, in this fucking bar, and I wasn’t the bartender.”
Tony nods, giving up the ghost.

In another universe, in
What he is about to do is a sin of great efforts.
Maushmi’s lower lip trembles, as she runs a hand over her face. “We didn’t know. Not at first,” she says, almost pleading, halfway close to tears. “You were such a happy child. You were so happy. Obadiah, he was… he was your father’s business partner at Stark Industries, helped him out in the earlier years, when your father… it was hard for him, you know? For both of us, getting out there. He was Jewish, and I was Tamil, and they didn’t like us, they didn’t like the idea of us making weapons, but Obadiah, with his smile and his white skin and his blonde hair, it made everything better,
“I have some Horlicks for you,” Jarvis offers. “Why don't you jump into bed? I’ll turn on your electric blanket as well.”
“I didn’t mean to make you feel that way. I know you probably won’t believe me, and I understand why, but I never intended to make you feel that way, Tony. I never wanted you to feel like you were disposable, and I
He sees a pair of grey eyes, the slow lick of a smile, indulgent and soft, and the shame pools thick in his chest, because that’s a lie.
His lungs are in his throat when he stretches himself out like a cat on top of the bed, naked, waiting, allowing himself to be as alluring as possible, when he hears the door creak. Grant slips in between the shard of empty space between the door and the door frame.
“I wasn’t spying on you,” James says, derisively. “I had to make sure that you were okay before I came to see you.”
Everyone starts snickering.
Tony gnaws on his lower lip and then, purposefully rubs his body against Steve’s, feeling Steve’s erection nudge him in the hip.
“In my family, it is. It very much is, or it’s a white hoax, because they think too much of themselves or they aren’t built to be resilient like us, and we aren’t that weak,” Tony muses, grim-edged. “Anything to do with mental health, we can deal with it. We don’t need to talk about our feelings; if we have any problems, we suck it up, because there are a lot of people who have it much worse than me. We just… deal with it. We are not weak.”
James growls low in his throat, the look in his eyes sharp and full of fury.
Steve’s hands skate over Tony’s face, down his arms.
“He was a good one,” Steve says, wistfully.
because I was smart enough that he wasn’t slumming it with me but dumb enough that he didn’t feel inferior, the same way that he felt with you. He didn’t see me as a person. He didn’t see me as a friend or a student or someone worthy of his respect. I was like a project to him, and when he found out about us, he was furious, not because I’d… I’d used you or abused you or took advantage of you in some way, but because I had used
Steve’s brow furrows. “I feel like that could be ten different people.”
“So, have you sufficiently proven your point?” he asks, curiously.
“Don’t say that,” Tony murmurs.
Tony slams the point of his elbow into Obadiah’s broad, fleshy gut, struggling to get free, but Obadiah backhands him hard enough to send him flying into the chair. He collides with Steve’s faux corpse, which spills out beside him, his phone clattering nearby, the alarm flashing on the screen.
“It’s alright, Steve,” Tony says, gently. “You don’t have to worry about me.”
“You’re not going anywhere?”
“You knew,” Tony accuses, in a voice as brittle as glass. “You knew about Steve and SHIELD this whole time, didn’t you?”
Steve doesn’t flinch this time. “Your name is James Buchanan Barnes. You grew up in Brooklyn. Your father’s name was George, and your mother’s name was Winifred. You have a sister, Rebecca. She’s married now, and she has kids. Two, a boy and a girl, a boy named James, for you. I go and visit them sometimes. They call me
Peter bites his lip and nods.
Tony worries his teeth on his lower lip, staring up at him through the dip of his eyelashes. “It’s what I do best,” he manages to say, seductively, his voice and soft like a slow drip of honey.
And honestly, trying something like the rent boy fantasy one more time is only likely to result in more humiliation for himself.
“You were already giving me so much; I didn’t think I had the right to take anymore from you,” James says, ruefully. “You put a roof over my head and food on my plate, because you didn’t want me sleeping in some filthy alley and scrounging in dumpsters. You were helping me destroy the people who’d hurt me the most, ruined my life, stolen from me everything that I held dear and could never touch again. If I touched you… didn’t that make me as awful as the people I was hunting, touching something that I had no right to touch. My hands were already so filthy.”
“Neither am I,” she says, casually.
“No, no,” Steve says, quickly, “you look, you look like you needed them, or rather, you enjoyed them. I’m happy that you… you enjoyed them.”
James leans to the side and knocks their heads together.
Tony’s hand is shaking, but he maintains his grip on the knife. “Don’t touch me,” he says, fiercely. “If you touch me, I will kill you.”
“Steve, I’m actually an expert on this, because a lot of people have said I do it too, but you’re babbling,” Tony says, calmly.
Warnings for this chapter: explicit sexual content, dirty talk, consensual verbal degradation, low self-esteem, suspicions of infidelity.
She starts unpacking the plastic boxes, and Tony goes to help him.
Tony remains silent, bites down on his lip when Grant slides two fingers into his body, dry as a bone.
“I’m Tony Stark. They wouldn’t dare,” Tony says, with a shrug of his shoulders.
His hands are linked with Peter’s and Maushmi’s, and when he looks down, he finds Peter glaring up at him.
And Steve Rogers is just another name in a long list of people who claimed they loved him but ended up disappointing him, and now, he would end up disappointing Tony’s children as well, and that’s the worst, that’s the thing Tony can’t bear to deal with, to endure, the idea that he has made such a fundamental mistake when it comes to the character of someone that he loves and his children are going to be the ones that pay for it.
Tony lifts an eyebrow. “Why the fuck would I suggest to
The heat of the water soothes his nerves; his feet slap in the water.
Tony has the sudden urge to comfort him.
“He’s lying,” Steve chimes in, rocking back on his feet.
, Tony would have said, a laugh in his handsome voice, and Steve wants to scream in rage).
“Tony,” Steve sighs and pushes his hand away. “No, Tony,” he says, firmly, his voice brooking no argument.
“Do you believe that you are undeserving of Steve?”
“If I fall asleep after this, you’re not going to sneak out of bed, out the house, are you?” Tony demands, his voice stronger this time around.
“Yeah,” Sam says, somewhat contented, “that’s what I thought.”
For a moment, he feels that instinctive insecurity, because Steve and James are specimens of human perfection in their own right; they’re made to kill, predators in their own right, and their bodies are wired tight, ready to kill, and Tony doesn’t have that; he doesn’t have that savage beauty to him.
Toni’s throat flexes. “Yeah,
There’s clearly a diamond attached to the band, and he brushes the pad of his finger over the sharp edges of the stone.
Steve frowns, suddenly, his brow dipping. “Hey, what’s wrong?” he says, softly, smoothing a thumb over his cheek. “Are you not feeling well, Tony?” He presses the back of his palm against his forehead, as if checking his temperature. “Are you sick? I can…
!” Steve barks at him. “Have I ever given you the idea that I’d… I’d just walk out on you guys like that?”
You have to take care of them, he told himself.
“Yes, thank you,” says Lord Steven, licking his lips.
Sam jolts a little, as if he hadn’t been expecting that to be the sentence that came out of his mouth, his eyes widening comically.
Coulson and Steve rush into the cell. Steve climbs to the bars and unties the knot, which leads to Natasha sliding down over Coulson’s shoulders, limp as a marionette with its strings slashed.
“Have you been… have you been stalking me?”
He reaches forward, closing his mouth around the tendon in Steve’s throat, connecting his neck and his shoulder, setting his teeth there. Steve’s head falls onto his shoulder, and Tony can see the strands of Steve’s hair sticking to his neck, damp with sweat.
“Oh, I’m sure.” Tony pauses. “Did she know?”
“Oh?” he says, lightly, turning around to face her, his voice all honey, all sweetness.
“Have a good day,” he says, quietly, something terrible and frightful curling in his chest.
Steve opens his mouth, even stretches his hand out to catch Tony’s, but Tony dodges it expertly, making his way out of the room and up the stairs.
“Yeah?” Tony asks, with only the slightest suspicion.
“What if there’s someone hiding there,” Pepper urges.
For fuck’s sake, ten years ago, Tony would’ve just had to bat his eyelashes and fling Steve those bedroom eyes of his, and Steve would’ve herded him into the nearest room and fucked his brains out.
“Tony-”
. I’ve been such a slut. I’ve been spreading it all over the place; I need to be shown who I belong to.”
Tony’s face hardens into an angry mask, his expression flattening. “Yeah, everyone’s made that very clear; Steve’s not the guy to do that to someone, but it’s always the guy that you least expect it that betrays you the most.”
Tony’s eyes are on his monitors, cleverly sneaking peeks at Steve in the machine. The EKG beeps in the background.
Steve sighs and tilts Tony to the side, so that Tony can reach out with one hand and grab the wine glass.
His eyes were still a deep, brandy brown, albeit with a few more wrinkles around the sides, shades of bruises under them belying his exhaustion, his nose still sharp, and his mouth still firm and pink. His jaw is strong, but when he leans his head down, a second chin forms underneath like a thick layer of fat.
“Somehow I know how this is going to end,” James says, dryly.
“Hi,” Steve says, shyly, “these are for you.”
“You really want me to?” Tony asks, unsure.
“One, two, Obie’s coming for you. Three, four, better lock your door. Five, six, grab your crucifix. Seven, eight, gonna stay up late. Nine, ten, never sleep again–”
They’re hesitant to nod again, but they do.
It’s not an intense ceremony, thank God. She doesn’t have bridesmaids; she has attendants, that being Pepper and Bruce and Happy, and a man of honour, being Rhodey, and so do Bucky and Steve, who go with Sam and Natasha and Clint.
Tony cocks his hip out a little, almost self-consciously, the silk of the short, crimson-red nightgown stretching over his hip.
He nods, almost desperate and half-wild, with the idea, kneeling in front of Steve, like this, in just a scrap of lace covering his cock, and putting his mouth on Steve’s cock, while Steve sits there, fully dressed, with his hand in Tony’s hair.
Tony runs up the stairs in a blind panic towards his wing of the manor. He darts into his rooms, slamming the door and locking it. He presses his ear to the door, trying to hear if the killer is coming up this way or not.
Tony wouldn’t want him to cry, he thinks.
Tony climbs the ladder to the top of the turret and braces himself between the two uprights there, the radio mast and the periscope. Still, the ocean comes up to meet him. Soon, the top of the turret is underwater and the radio mast is disappearing. Tony shifts his grip to the periscope, working his way up it and hanging on for dear life as the ocean whips at his body, the periscope quickly going under.
Something kicks a little in his chest, pushing against his lungs, and he laughs, self-deprecatingly.
“That’s not true,” James snaps, suddenly fiery.
; you… you gave me a purpose that wasn’t just building things that blew up. Of course you’re not just another Tiberius Stone to me.” He purses his lips thin. “Don’t think this means I’ve forgotten about the fact that you were
“Okay, this is creepy,” he says, casually.
“Stolen what?”
“Do you want everything to go back to normal? Do you want to build something new?” Eshe pushes.
“Oh,” he whispers.
He decides to run.
Tony shrugs, as his fingers slide into his body, biting his lip against the stretch, as his insides shift to accommodate his fingers.
“I said, I chose you. When your father gave me that choice, I didn’t hesitate. I chose you because I loved you because I wanted to be with you because I couldn’t imagine life without you in it.” Steve keeps his eyes fixed on the wall as if he’s not brave enough to look Tony in the eye. “You told me about that life you imagined for us, where we’d go on adventures together, dig together, live together, and it would be perfect because we had each other. I dreamed of that life too. For fuck’s sake, Tony, I
The drunken singing behind him alerts his attention. “I see crack squad is prepping for duty,” he says, dryly.
“Doesn’t sound like it. In fact, it sounds like you are still making decisions for me instead of asking what
“Because I’m not cheating on you!”
I do have to warn everyone, because I see this coming up in the comments a lot - you may disagree with how they resolve things, and by that I mean, Tony and Steve. You might think that Steve doesn't grovel hard enough, and that's your right to do so, but I approached it in a way that this Tony would react and what he would accept, and if you were expecting Tony to walk away from his marriage at the end of this, I am sorry but that's not going to happen. They will resolve things and stay together, and I'm sorry if it doesn't happen in a way that you want, but this is how I saw things realistically happening.
you, I might add – it’s not as if there was some great love story there either – and he brought you to this unfamiliar place, and then, refused to touch you, all because he thought you were a child. Months passed where he gave no attention at all, and then, he left, left
Tony’s mind snaps into action, and he leans down, grabbing a rifle from the prostrate body of one of his former escorts, and runs back into the flaming settlement.
“Go back to bed,” he cajoles. “I’ll come and join you soon.”
“Blame you for what?” Tony asks, frowning.
“What if I do?” Toni asks, patiently.
“Yeah, and I thought you told me back at MIT that you were trying very hard to go for the very opposite of Ty. Sounds to me like you took a few steps back there, doll,” James taunts.
Tony crawls over, his hand dripping with lube, and he smooths another hand over the dip of his spine, the small of James’ back, before his fingers find his rim, tucked between his cheeks, and he prods his fingers against the furled skin there.
“But to them, I am,” Tony points out. “They’ll never see me as anything else. If you go over there and fight with them over it, well, that’s not going to help. They won’t stop making those comments. They’ll just think that we’re sleeping together, and the comments will get worse.”
That only makes Steve grin harder. He reaches up and smooths a thumb over his cheekbone. “That’s ‘cause you’re mine,” he muses. “You like what I do to you in this bed, don’t you?”
“I’m fine. Why did he call you Bucky?” Tony asks him, his brow furrowing.
, Tony. You’re always going to be my son. There aren’t any lines I wouldn’t cross to keep you safe.”
like insurance.
? This whole time… but you, you work for an insurance company,” he says, lamely. “You… you’re a claims agent. I don’t-”
Steve takes a deep, steadying breath. “I’d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.”
, well, you’d put two and two together and come up with eighty-five.”
But nothing happens; there is no destruction, no fury, no terrible, widespread death of everyone that Tony loves, because the stones are no longer in the gauntlet that Thanos is wearing.
Steve’s expression warps into something savage and covetous. “Yeah, you do,” he growls, leaning up at the waist to brush his mouth over Tony’s. “Come on, baby, you know what to do,” he cajoles.
Toni presses her lips to the corner of her his jaw, before she straddles him, her knees on either side of his hips. From this angle, he can see her whole body, and it still amazes him after all of these months that Antonia Stark,
He falsifies his next smile, it turning taut around the edges. “I’m sorry. I didn’t introduce myself to your date,” he says, softly, turning to the man beside Nat, who looks increasingly angry by the way that Nat is fawning over Tony’s husband.
Both of them remain silent.
like you give a shit about me. We both know you don’t.”
Toni looked at him, curiously.
“Oh, I’m sure there’s some cult out there,” Tony tells him, dryly, and then, gasps, when the next thrust of Steve inside James, sends James’ fingers deeper into him, catching his prostate.
So, what does he do then? How does he fix this? Is there even something to fix?
Steve looks at him, without flinching. “Natasha raised the unfortunate possibility that maybe, you weren’t… you weren’t being completely honest with me.”
“Is she Natalia Romanova?” James pushes.
“Back then, you were,” James says.
Finally, she clears her throat. “So, Phil’s alive.”
“Good boy,” Steve soothes, stroking over his hair. “Why don’t you get on your back, baby, and grab yourself one of those vibrators of yours, huh? Pick your favourite and I’ll fuck you with it.”
Tony looks over to see Wanda cracking a single eye open. Something cracks in his chest and floods out, and he reaches out, tangling his hand with the closest one of Wanda’s.
“Natasha… knows pretty things,” Steve explains. “She… wears a lot of things like that during missions. She’s… she’s a honeypot, herself. She seduces her marks, and she has a certain image to portray to her targets, so I thought she’d know exactly what you may like.” He pauses. “I realise now how stupid it was, and I… I had a chat with her about it, about her wearing that to the date. She was testing you.”
Tony kisses him again, presses their foreheads together. “You and me, Steve, I promise,” he says, softly.
“You’re telling me,” Steve rasps, and his eyes seem darker in the low porch light.
“Sometime in the last six months.”
“But you love me,” Tony says, softly.
Steve smiles at him like the sun, and that fluttering in his belly, in his chest beside his pathetic heart returns.
“Holy shit,” Steve gapes at himself, “it feels good.”
, you lied straight to our faces about some crisis at the company, so you could go, what, gallivanting with this guy? You’ve just told me that you’ve been spending time with a guy that you’ve had sex with in the past, and you deliberately kept that from me, and what, I’m not supposed to get suspicious? I’m supposed to take it in fucking stride, believe you when you say that nothing happened?”
“Are you in love with Bucky?”
“Where are we going?” Tony wonders out loud.
“Come on, let’s go,” Tony says, curtly, ripping his hand out of Steve’s and moving down the corridor.
“Hey, I’m not meaning that as an admonition. I’m just saying that if it were me, and you showed up with an old flame, wanting to invite him for dinner, I wouldn’t be too happy about it either.” James pats him on the hand. “You’re sweet, and you have good intentions, but I don’t think it’s going to end the way you want it to.”
This isn’t the place for that, and despite the relief, the stupid, nonsensical love that he’d felt for Steve in that tent, just by looking at what the thought of Tony’s death had done to him, he hasn’t forgotten how they ended.
But there’s nothing.
“You don’t even
Steve taps him on the nose. “Who said I wasn’t?”
“Oh, yeah, I remember her,” Steve says, face brightening with the realisation.
you this already!” Tony tells him, almost incredulously. “What more do you want?”
It doesn’t though; nothing works, because Tony is just dead.
. In there, there was a list of names, targets of the Winter Soldier, and your parents were on that list.”
Tony feels that sudden, aching longing, the sad, desperate one, where his heart leaps into his throat, and he wants to reach for Steve, to draw him into his arms and kiss the sadness out of his eyes, to make Steve whole and healthy and happy again.
“I was so focused on my life and what I wanted from my life and what I had to do to get there, so I’d never have to sleep in a car again or have to get dressed before the creepy, pervy janitor caught me in the showers or have to choose between buying food or buying pads, that I didn’t realise that Pietro was struggling, that he needed me. By the time I realised, it was too late. I’d graduated, I’d got a job, I’d found Sam and married him, and honestly, I lost touch with him.”
Steve flinches.
Toni sends him a withering look. “Let’s not pretend that you’re the pinnacle of haute couture.”
Tony closes his eyes, reaches out and fists his hand in James’ shirt, the blood creeping onto his fingers, red-black and damp. He pulls James inside and shuts the door.
Toni nods with the faintest smile on her face.
He used to swear like a sailor behind the wheel, sometimes even flip stupid, teenage drivers off, when they pissed him off.
“Thanks, babe,” Steve says with that golden smile, leaning down and kissing him swiftly between the eyes.
, and
Tony reaches over and fondly brushes back Wanda’s dark auburn hair away from her eyes.
Whatever it takes, Tony told him on that last day, and Steve can still remember the hot, insistent press of his mouth against his.
“Wait, just… just listen to me,” James says, firmly, hands grasping him by the shoulders before he can rush out of the apartment.
They end up in Phillips’ tent, where the colonel is signing a stack of letters.
“Come on,” Steve cajoles in a what Tony perceives as a mean way, “come on, Tony, be real for a second here.”
. Exactly, what do you think I’m doing when you’re not here, Steve?”
Tony frowns and pulls away from James’ embrace, wrapping his arms around himself. “Complication? What complication?”
“No, no,” he sobs, a brief, incoherent noise slipping out of him before his voice tapering off into a thready whine. “No, it’s not real. It’s not real. He’s still alive,” he forces himself to repeat over and over again.
“You don’t know what sort of man James is. Tony, even you don’t. The two of you know halves of a man that hasn’t been made whole. You might not even like the man he is when he’s whole. James… is in a very peculiar circumstance, something which I doubt I will see again in the rest of my career, but I do think that things will change between the three of you as the time passes. I’m not saying that to mean that I think that the three of you won’t go forward with this relationship, but parts of that relationship will change. James needs to be whole, and the two of you need to love that man he is going to become before anything can happen between the three of you. He needs to know what he wants as a person before he can be a part of this relationship. He needs to be his own person, have a life, some stability, before you can be three people in a relationship. And, I hate to say this, but he has to be prepared to love and help you raise your children before you get serious. And I’m saying this because I know you’re both good parents and that you love your children, and I know you would never do anything that would put them in harm’s way, emotionally or otherwise.”
, and no one who knows him can deny it.
Steve bites his lip and steps down from the porch. “I love you,” he says.
Steve’s face crumples. “You’re right. It is my fault, and I wish I hadn’t come back into your life either,” he says, his voice thick, “and I know I’m banking on a lot here. They haven’t hurt you in the last twenty-four hours; they aren’t going to start now. I’ll be back to get you in no time.”
The moment snaps back, and the rush in Tony’s body fades; he can feel it in his chest, in his throat, the broil of his fury, the well of his resentment, the ache of his indignation, and he feels like he’s on fire, like he’s smouldering.
Stone isn’t some guy who drugged a college girl during a frat party and raped her; Stone isn’t a guy who got controlling and thought his girlfriend was cheating on him in high school.
“Wanda? What’s going on?”
Coulson cocks his gun, and Tony jumps in between him and Natasha, ensuring that Coulson can’t fire his gun without harming Tony in the process.
“I am,” Tony and Steve intone at the same time.
Steve lifts his eyes, and they’re wet, and there are tears all over his face. “I’m sorry,” he says, roughly, his voice scarred. “You don’t… there is no obligation to forgive me-”
He cradles Tony’s in a single hand, his thumb dragging over his plump lower lip. His other hand lifts Tony’s legs to splay over his thighs, spreading them slightly, so that he can work his fingers between Tony’s legs, cupping his cock over the lace underwear.
He can practically hear Steve frowning. “Why?”
“The best.” Steve kisses him back, kisses him firmly on the mouth. “Thank you, Tony, thank you.”
Peggy purses her lips.
“Like what?”
Steve stands, and he approaches Tony’s still body.
“What happens between your brother and I is between us alone. You have no right to comment on it,” Tony insists, the air tight in his chest.
Tony scowls absolute murder. “Because I said so, that’s why.” He curls his hand into a fist on top of the bar. “It’s about time I called the shots in this relationship.”
“Well, then, I hope you come back soon,” Maushmi huffs.
“Not even close.”
Steve scowls. “Come on.”
He passes Maushmi into Steve’s arms, and she happily settles in his lap, burrowing under the sheets.
He swims for it.
“Pepper was my
Toni smoothed her hand over the side of his face, while her other hand curled around Bucky’s knee.
Tony did know that.
Bucky and Steve kiss her soundly.
“Yeah, I know.”
For a second, he can feel Steve’s surprise, his mouth slack under his, but then, a groan rumbles through him, rumbles against Tony, and he kisses back, firm and gentle in equal measure, dry and without skill, as though he has not kissed many people – Tony would prefer it that way, would prefer an alpha who is as inexperienced as he is.
“Yeah, JARVIS?” Tony asks, absentmindedly, his fingers deftly twisting a screw into the leg braces he’s currently working on.
“I’d love your kids as if they were my own,” James promises, with a passion that borders on madness.
“You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about,” Steve says, his voice ugly.
Tony leans forward. “In a totally non stereotypical way, Jungle Man fix John. No more nightmares for me.”
“Hey, you,” she drawls.
“Maybe that’s how
James nods.
It really fucking
They pull him from the chair, remove the ropes and the gag in his mouth and haul him to another tent, in which there is a long trough in the center, overflowing with murky water.
“Fuck,” Steve mutters, and with a firm hand on Tony’s thigh splaying him wide, he adjusts the direction of the vibrator, and the next thrust catches directly on Tony’s prostate, and
“I don’t…” Tony trails off, closing his eyes in an attempt to free himself of the roiling uncertainty. “I don’t want to hide this anymore. I don’t want to hide this part of me anymore. We’re not doing anything wrong, and I’m sick of feeling like we are. I’m sick of feeling like I’m cheating on Steve or doing something unforgivable, when it’s
“I’m so glad that you’re feeling better,” Sarah says, fervently. She pulls back, searches his eyes. “Things are different now, and I know that, but if you want to talk, about
“Get the fuck out of my bar,” he snarls.
“California’s the most high and palmy state, man,” Darcy interjects.
Tony, to them, can endure all manners of discomfort, but God forbid Steve go one night without a warm body beside him; no one, of course, had intervened when Steve had left him alone, night after night, for fucking months.
“I wanted to put you in the shower, get you a drink, make you sleep it off, but before I could even say anything, you stormed up to me and you kissed me. I was so surprised that I couldn’t kiss you back,” Tony says, ruefully. “And you pulled back, and you looked so hurt, like you thought I didn’t want you back, so
