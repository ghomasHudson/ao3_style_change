I’m so incredibly proud of you! I can’t even find the words to tell you how amazing you are.  You’re so brave.  I wish I could be more like you.  Maybe I’ll find a way to get there. I might move a little slower than you do, but you’re inspiring to me, too.  I’m so so proud of you!
So you’re nerdy, huh? I like that.  I think intelligence is incredibly attractive.  Sometimes I feel like all my friends are super smart.  I’m really lucky to have them.
Jimmy heard the tail end of the conversation when he came back with the little box.  He rolled his eyes.  “Dad, if you’re going to pay for me to take the SAT three times, I better have something to show for it, right? Hey Tony, Other Jim.”
“So you’re saying you, what, let him get his hands on a stash of iridium?” Tony snapped, clearly irritated.  “Didn’t think he’d be able to break Coulomb, even though he’s already done it once? J, wake up everyone else!”
“The kid’s going to stay low key.  He could use some more training in tactics, logistics.  He needs to expand his awareness of the long game. I figure no one better than the guy who’s going to be a hundred next year. Besides, I keep delivering him peanut butter and jelly, and he says I’m not allowed to send him lunch anymore.”
Suddenly Tony was knocked down onto the couch and frozen, a high-pitched tone shrill in his ear.  What the hell was that?
It had only been a few hours, but he missed him.  The house felt too empty. Steve brought warmth and life to this place that Tony hadn’t even known was missing.  Now, though, it was all he could focus on.  The cold that seeped in when Steve left.  Not that he regretted sending him away.  It was the right thing to do.  Barnes needed him, and Steve didn’t owe Tony anything.  Everyone got what he or, well, he needed.  Barnes got his friend, and his friend’s contract.  Steve got freedom from Stern.  Tony had an unbelievably talented PA for nearly a month. He rubbed his hands over his tired eyes, then ran his hand over the metal in his chest.
They’re not starry-eyed and naïve. They know it's a long road, that they'll have to rebuild, to work hard at it. But Tony has always been a risk-taker and Steve has always been stubborn as hell.  They can find a way.
Rhodey swiped his phone open.  “It’s Pepper.  She says we should meet up to do our Christmas exchange, and she wants to bring in the new girl.”
Not much left to do.  He should probably finish up on the body suit he’d been building for Rhodey.  That guy did far too much active duty for someone as high ranking as he was.  And it was basically done.  It was actually complete.  And excellent.  Totally protective.  Just, no way for Rhodes to really get into or out of it yet.  Details.  Shouldn’t take long—it was just a matter of getting seams and releases in places that wouldn’t compromise the integrity of the suit itself.  No point in a body suit if it didn’t protect the body.
He wandered back up to the kitchen, feeling out of place.  Already contemplating a world without himself in it.  He ran his hand over the wall as he walked up the stairs, noticing the fine grain to it.  Light filtered through the skylights above, washing over him.  It was quiet, but that was somehow right.  Fitting.  He pulled the belongings out of Steve’s drawers.  Just some clothes, a watch.  He placed them neatly into the duffel bag that lived in the bottom drawer, dog tags swinging aimlessly from a strap.  He ran his fingers along them for a moment, tracing the name and numbers, the ridges smoothing out at the edges.
Natasha cut him off.  “Relax.  You’re Tony Stark.  If he swings that way, he at least thinks you’re cute.”
The movie went off without a hitch. It was a good adventure, plenty of teamwork. Steve liked it, which he knew pleased Tony. Han Solo sort of reminded him of Tony, actually, always covering up the softie inside with bravado and roguish charm.  Steve snuck glances toward Tony just to check, just to make sure, during some of the open space scenes.  Tony caught him looking, and just smiled.
That was a fair point.  Still.  “You’re still a jerk.” He turned into Sam’s driveway while Rhodey was chuckling to himself.
Steve was by his side in an instant, his eyes taking in the scene at one glance. Tony felt gentle fingertips on the side of his neck.
Steve didn’t answer for a second. “Um, they’re great,” he finally said, sounding slightly strangled.
“I thought maybe you’d run into one of those bilgesnipe Thor mentioned,” Tony said, walking up and planting a quick kiss on him, snaking his armored arm around Steve’s waist.  “I mean, I knew you could handle it on your own, but I like watching you in action.” He winked up at Steve, whose heart was going through a variety of interesting tempo changes. It wasn’t the first time he’d kissed Steve, actually.  A few months back he’d kissed him squarely on the mouth—a joke, he’d said, although Steve wasn’t sure on whom.  And Steve’d never gotten over it. “C’mon, let’s get cleaned up and get home.  I told the kid you’d make waffles.” He squeezed Steve’s waist, and then gestured toward Njorun.  “Thor’s waiting outside.”
Double huh.  He thought Pepper had said picking up stray boys was a bad idea.  Walking sexual harassment lawsuit.  Something like that.
It wasn’t that Steve was pure exactly.  After all, someone who was pure wouldn’t withhold coffee from Tony—literally holding it over his head—until he ate something nutritious.  Someone who was pure wouldn’t stand possessively nearby when pretty reporters hovered, with a deceptively mild look on his face—a look that somehow told them to back off when they got too close. Someone who was pure wouldn’t kiss Tony, hard, purposefully, while they were both in uniform, wink at him, and then jump out of a plane straight into a battle.  Or tell him, in that low, Captain tone, to wait until they got home.  Or stand in the back of a summer press conference, slowly and calmly eating a pop rocket while Tony tried to concentrate.
Steve just smiled at him. “You’re funsize, Tony,” he murmured, drawing him in, “and you taste good to me.”
Well, that was interesting.  And Jarvis was very chatty for a robot.  Steve thought, anyway, not having had a lot of experience with other AI. Sure, Jarvis was his master’s creation, bound to see Mr. Stark in the best light.  But still—who was taking advantage of him? “I see. Did Mr. Stark leave instructions for me after the SI France call?”
I just wanted to tell you that I had a good day today. A great day, really.  And I don’t want to get into specifics, especially if you are feeling low. But I think I have a lead on my best friend who I lost, Bucky, and I just wanted to share that feeling of happiness with you.
Within minutes, Rhodey was busy killing all the high notes on a Queen track, Natasha had somehow gotten Bruce to dance, and Hammer had downed half a bottle of SoCo.   Sam was loudly telling a crowd about Steve’s inspirational speech at the cross country race, Steve blushing hard.
.  Ironic.  Math was a breeze.  Fifteen minutes, tops.  He worked his special projects.  Easy.  He had two more cups of coffee.  Brushed his teeth again.  He turned on his phone, deleted anything from Howard, briefly looked over the “Call me!” messages from his friends. He got dressed, brushed his hair.  His friends, he’d said they would stand by him. He’d said he had confidence in them.  Time for him to test it.
Steve flushed. “I’m certain that’s not what she would have wanted,” he said. “She probably just wanted to get a story on you.”
“Of course Natasha should be part of it.” Tony looked over, nose scrunched up.  “She’s not that new anymore.”
“I would like to communicate more with you, Tony,” Thor announced, waggling his eyebrows in a manner he seemed to think would be suggestive.
.  He could feel another finger, stretching him, twisting, working deeper and wider.  And then another, and he couldn’t wait, he couldn’t hold everything he was feeling inside, the sensations bursting out of him, cracking open his chest, surging from his skin, “I love you, Tony,” he managed to say, nearly out of his mind.
In the morning, Tony took the elevator straight to his workshop.  No stopping in the kitchen.  No getting coffee from the big coffee maker.  He was not going to run into anyone today, just in case.
Steve looked out the window for a moment, trying to be anywhere but here.  The sun would set soon.  “I just need a break.” He turned back, smiled. He was pretty sure it looked natural.  “I’ll be back, Tony.  And I’m around if you need me.” He tried not to notice the way the setting sun shot fire through Tony’s hair, the way Tony’s eyes tightened a little against the glare, making tiny wrinkles that Steve wanted to kiss away. He attempted to ignore the grey smudge on the side of his neck where he knew he’d kissed him last night. The space was too close. His heart slowly, inexorably imploding, a newly formed black hole eating him from the inside.
“God, is he hurt?” Steve’s concerned.  As if the kid hadn’t stolen his shield, cuffed him with webbing. Of course he is.
He brushed his teeth, towel wrapped around his waist.  He wasn’t sure what to wear to bed.  Normally he slept naked, but he felt a little awkward.  Or maybe just strategically defensive, since kittens had claws and the blankets were thin.  He decided on a pair of Iron Man underwear Tony’d given him when he moved in. It had helped break the ice, started a short round of gag gifts that ended when Thor loosed an actual black widow in Tony’s room.  Steve had ended up being the one to find and remove it.  Clint wouldn’t touch it and Bruce and Natasha were away on a mission.
“You know, there’s a fair amount of irony in this.  Considering whose file this is. But there’s just something about the feel of manila.  It feels right. This is the way a file should feel,” Coulson rambled, smiling.  He stopped in front of Steve’s desk.  “This one. This is the big guy.  He’s been through a lot.  Cut him a little slack, will you? He’s a good guy.  Hides it well. But when all the cards are on the table, well…” He set the packet down with a hefty thump. “I hear you knew his dad.  I think this one’s an upgrade.”
“Right, well, I mean, I guess the serum works differently than Bruce’s thing. Processed it differently,” Steve tried, flailing wildly inside.
No, he hadn’t. He didn’t think it mattered.  Tony pulls up the information quickly. “Son of a bitch. Of course he is.  But that quiz wasn’t my fault, Rogers.”
Please, if you care about me at all.  Please just write back to me.  Just let me know… something. Anything.”
They had just put down a horde of flying electric jellyfish. Tony’d taken a direct hit, and the suit was out of commission.  He’d loaded it up on a quinjet, patted it fondly.  When he turned away, Steve was looking at him, an undecipherable look in his eyes.
Bruce was getting out some teacups from a sideboard; he gave Tony a small wave, not wanting to interrupt the conversation already going in the room.
Steve flushed. Was that really what Tony thought of him? He was a narcissist and a bigot? So old-fashioned, so hypermasculine, that he couldn’t cope with change? Couldn’t compromise? Steve’s skin was heated but the rest of him was ice cold, humiliated, sick with disappointment in himself. He touched the handle of his motorcycle, trying to ground himself. No. Probably not. Or not entirely. Steve felt fairly sure that if Tony really thought all that of him, he’d be less welcoming than he was.  Tony didn’t dislike him; he was kind to Steve.  Caught him up on the good movies, showed him how to make the pop-up blocker more selective, asked him for feedback on his suits.  They were teammates. Friends.  Good friends, even.
“Interesting,” Tony said, dumping silver powder over the filter.  That was really precise.  If he didn’t hate magic so much, he might be interested in recruiting the woman.  If she weren’t a witch.  And also crazy.  Then a thought occurred to him. “Wait a sec, Bruce kept it in his system until midnight?”
Tony nods.  Not that it matters. He says, “Take care of yourself, Rogers.” He can say that. It tears him up inside, but he can say it without screaming.
Happy looked pleased at being called sir, but the expression faded as he looked over the forms.  “There’s like nothing here.  What are you trying to pull?”
ordered a hit on us.  Whoever this is, this Iron Monger fucker, that’s fucking treasonous! Nat, we have to find whoever the hell this guy is.”
“Steve, you going all 40s on us?” Tony couldn’t help asking.  He’d never seen Steve wearing that hat.  He usually stuck to baseball caps when he wore a hat at all.  Not that Tony had noticed.
I’m sorry, Shell.  I wish I could make it better for you.  I wish it weren’t so hard for you.  I guess, I mean it’s late, and I’ve just been listening to music for a while, a mix of everything that’s on that college channel.  But now, I guess, there’s a line from this one song that I wish you could feel: “Believe your voice can mean something.” I know, it’s an old song. Just, you’re important to me.  I guess that’s what I mean.
“Of course, sir. I shall relay your message immediately.” Jarvis sounded more pleased than he had since Steve left.  Not that he was supposed to get attached to the guests. Still, Steve was Steve. Hard not to get attached.
Morita took a deep breath.  “Yeah.  Thanks, man.  Thanks for encouraging me to take that SAT the last time, too.  I think that 1500 is what sold them on me in the end.” Tony’s ears perked up, tallying points on his invisible scorecard of Who Might Be Flying, which sounded more like a drug reference and less like a guessing game when he said it like that.
Tony forced down the urge to vomit.  “Oh, that’s me.  He had some ideas about robotics and thought he’d drop by. After all, Nat and Bruce and I are on the team and now we’re all in one place.”
This was truly thoughtful, clarity and intent showing in each detail.  He noticed the notation in the upper right corner.  Oman/Pakistan.  So, refugee camps from ISIS, from the Taliban.  Steve’s mouth tightened.  This he knew. Without thinking, he picked up the heavy pen that clipped the pages together, adding notations throughout.  The security was good, but it needed to be heavier in the girls’ quarters.  The school rooms should be separated, and the building for school girls reinforced.  There needed to be a temporary mosque.  Prayer rugs for those who lost theirs in flight.  The muezzin’s tower should be more centralized, and protected from sniper fire.  The wells should be dug deeper, about another 10 meters—Steve had led one mission against a local insurgent who was targeting water systems that weren’t dug deep enough. The filtration system should also be equipped for bioweaponry prevention.  A greenhouse for local food production.  It wouldn’t be enough, but it would help with some of the vitamins and minerals.  The area was good for growing oranges, pomegranates, onions.  They could grow fruit and vegetables to help prevent scurvy and other malnutrition problems that weren’t as effectively covered by the food donations.
“Man of Iron, you have vanquished a truly worthy foe. Let us feast tonight, in celebration of your heroism!” Thor enthused, waving Mjolnir.
He took a deep breath and rolled up the blueprints, tucking them under his arm, and marched straight to Mr. Stark’s office.
He was, if it was possible, more distant in this session than in the previous ones.  He wondered if she would tell Coulson.  He wondered if he should care.
Steve cuts the line with a jab at the communication pad more forcefully than necessary, and marches off in righteous indignation. Two steps in, and he paddles back to take a closer look at the fridge. Specifically, at a piece of handwritten note stuck under a shield fridge magnet saying “REMEMBER: STRK-2188, Expo, Dec 1 to 4”.
to store data. They’re what people call the ancestors of modern computers. “Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator. Probably weighs thirty tonnes, uses more than eighteen thousand vacuum tubes.” He waves at a jumble of patch cords and some three thousand switches beside them. “Fun fact. ENIAC might’ve started it all, but I’m betting SHIELD was loaded enough to invest in second or third gens. I heard Dad mentioning a MANIAC once. Oh, it
It becomes immediately clear to Steve that the quarter’s soundproofing isn’t that terrific after all. As he walks the hallway alone towards the canteen, agents – young and old, male and female – cast surreptitious glances at him, all the while greeting him “Captain” with either a curt nod or a salute. They whisper, though his enhanced hearing can’t pick up the exact words. He made sure he’s properly showered, changed and shaved, so what gives? He stops by a large glass door and checks himself in the reflection, and boy oh boy, there’s a huge ass hickey over his jugular that his U-neck T-shirt cannot hide.
“Hey.” Must’ve been quite a mission, whatever it is that Fury sics on Captain America two weeks ago. Though his helmet hair and crumpled sweater doesn’t take away the overall… wholesome, handsome, youthful machoism from Steve Rogers, Tony still notes the slight edge in his voice, and agitation in his movement that translates to, “Let me guess, mission was major suckage?”
It doesn’t feel right either handing Steve the money he owes for lunch – and some. He sends Steve to the door and shuts it without another word, but runs after Steve anyway just to pass him a Cetta Therapeutics name card with his personal phone number scribbled on the back. Steve takes it politely, and Tony watches it disappear into his uniform’s breast pocket.
Compounded with having to save thirteen others from the vaults, there are only two viable way out. Option one: take the Goblin out with extreme prejudice. Then, have the hostages navigate
The nurse takes one good look at him, and he smiles toothily. She turns to her colleague. “That’s impossible. He shouldn’t even be conscious.”
Innocent until proven guilty? Not anymore. This is in every way worse than having his head held underwater until he builds the Jericho because now, even dying won’t stop the baddies from winning.
Miraculously, he makes it to the hospital in one piece, not even a dent on his car. He parks it haphazardly by the curb and only needs to follow the breadcrumbs SHIELD is dropping. Rows and rows of agents, all armed to the
and bravado, and thinks, he’s done this before. He made Mark I in a cave with a box of scraps, while strapped to a freaking car battery! He can do
a full tank of gas. No cash, too bad, but Tony hopes to charm his way into the cash register sitting on the table right there. They don’t need much, some change perhaps for emergencies. There’s only so many coins one can find in the nook and cranny of a stolen car.
Then, the hyperventilating begins, and Tony slumps entirely against Steve despite the vehemence of being stuck with anyone in close quarters. The struggles might’ve ended, but the panic doesn’t. “Calm down! Can you feel this?” He plants one of Tony’s hand against his chest, right over his beating heart. “Breathe, Tony. Easy. Do what I do.”
“Hey,” Steve greets first, and stops to stand where the curtains are. The thing about the Iron Man armour is, Steve often overestimates how much protection it confers to the man within. The way Tony often brags about his inventions doesn’t help ground their expectations either. Lifting the faceplate feels like cracking a Kinder Joy egg. The cuts and the welts and the free-flowing blood never fail to surprise
Steve pulls the cock out, and slams it flat against the nest of pubic hair. Balls exposed, he latches onto them, tonguing the tauten sack and Tony’s hands fly up to cup his mouth.
–” Tony doubles over, a short cry escapes his lips. Don’t mistake Steve’s lack of aggression for weakness. His heart is hardened, the force of his fist punishing. And he isn’t about to let up.
Before he could take one step closer, Steve spins him around and stills him by his biceps, fingers digging into the flesh as his bulging eyes rake over the expanse of Tony’s bare chest.
Barely able to roll out of harm’s way, Tony lands ungracefully against the TV set with a thud, the back of his couch
And the world, cruel as it is, puts Steve on ice and preserves his forties’ virtues and ways. They call him old-fashioned. Should he change as the tide changes?
inappropriate as it is longed, and he can’t help groaning into Steve’s mouth when that daredevil of a hand gropes his behind.
“Is Tony with you? We have some pressing issues to comb over before we head for DC next Tuesday. I appreciate if you can tell me where he is.” Because, Steve is this close to driving down to the nearest police station and reporting a case of missing person.
“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Do not engage the Soldier upon sighting.” And Steve’s voice falters. “Leave him to us.”
hurt Tony as much as it’ll hurt him. Tony takes everything like a champ, the small smile encouraging.
Their journey towards the heart of the city is that of a typical midday traffic on a DC highway. Still no roadblocks or any indication of a nationwide hunt for one Steve Rogers, despite all the hoo-hah on the media.
“Someone’s been here recently,” Tony whispers, and kills the flashlight. “Says ‘ASP’ on the door. What does it mean?”
No shrapnel. No residual casing of the arc reactor. No trauma to the bones, muscle and surrounding internal organs. He’s fine. Absolutely fine. He continues gawping at the film as he walks down the hallway, only half his mind alert and actively searching for his door. Which isn’t much of a challenge really, because said door has a huge portrait of Iron Man sketched with chalk. Flattering. A masterpiece. He’s eyeball-to-eyeball with the pastel helmet when the door swings open, and he finds himself staring at a pair of shins.
? I’m starting to feel like an intellectual disappointment in the face of my forefathers’ achievements.”
“No, I do not,” Fury replies himself, and brandishes a frighteningly thick ring folder from inside his trench coat. There’s a fourth dimension in there, Steve suspects. “Captain Rogers, a word please. I’ve a message from the WSC.”
OK-ed yourself, and on the manufacturing side, we’re already filling up these orders. It’s too late to cancel anything now.”
“Where are we going?” he tries his luck, and gifts the attending paramedic his most cheerful half-wince.
A testimony to the perfection that is Stark Tech, the drawing app on the tablet is impeccable. There’s virtually no lagging between the touch of his finger pad on the glossy screen and the creation of a dot. Sketching is intuitive.
As Tony bullshits over the phone to save his hide and buy himself more time on the negotiations, Steve keeps his hands to a polite kneading around the shoulders. As the conversation gets more heated – read, Tony realises the purpose of this call isn’t just-checking but more like buck-up- incompetent-sack-of-shit – Steve lifts himself so he, too is kneeling on the massage bed, with his front almost flushed against Tony’s back. A hand comes to Tony’s front, and sits atop the crevice of his chest once more, minding its own business.
“Flattering. But, I can’t up and go at a moment’s notice. I’ll check my schedule, hit me again in an hour.”
One more thing. What Stark Industries does, how it operates and conducts its businesses is frankly, none of Steve’s concern. It disturbs him now that he knows how vehemently Tony is against the principles of Insight, yet indispensable in bringing it to fruition. Does Tony even know this?
“I’m fine, not joking. Did all that just happen, or was it a bad dream?” He was human kebab not too long ago, wasn’t he? He lifts his shirt and presses his palm to the exit wound – the
breathes a sigh of relief when the air-conditioning and lights come back on. There’s probably fifteen minutes left for all thirty suits to complete downloading every byte of Stark Tech.
Behind them, the wall of computer monitors suddenly turns blue – the blue screen of death – with the ASCI marquee spelling “ROSEBUD” cascading from unit to unit. Looks like the suicide code has been triggered, and Tony grins some more. That’s the final trick up his sleeve. Try overriding the deleting process in hope of salvaging residual data, and boom! Rock falls, everything dies.
– has been bidding their time. They’ll want to strike when fear has seeped deep enough into the community. And with fear, comes acceptance and gratitude when a saviour shows up at the nick of time. HYDRA means to play that role. Be the planet’s knight in a shining armour.
“Punishment does not come before the crime, General,” Steve grits out, the heart monitor beeping increasingly loud. “If there even is a crime.”
“That metal arm. Its dexterity and strength is something I’ve never seen before, and I’m me. Is that prehensile prosthetics, interfacing with your own neuronal functions? Or very impressive body paint? Who made it? I’d love to offer them a job with my company. I can pull some strings.” The man reaches behind his waist and brandishes a butterfly knife. The blade zings when he flips it. “Or not.” Tony’s mouth begins to dry. “Don’t like small talks, huh? Fair enough. Let’s go straight to the elephant in the room. Why do you want Fury dead? Is it something personal? Which I can kind of relate. Or are you working for someone else?”
Steve has an arm wrapped firmly around Tony’s waist as they dash to their freedom. A mighty leap over the barricade, over the flyover, that’s all it takes. The bullets are mere wasted effort to the shield.
has given him quite a scare last season. “No, I don’t think so.” Tony sits up a little straighter. “Don’t jinx it.”
“Cakewalk, Cap. Uh, we got DODC incoming from the Western borders. ETA is five minutes from now. Can we leave the clean-up to them? I’m still trying to clear off my sleep debt.”
And he watches Steve be led away by his men. He lingers, but they don’t bother him. They were more cordial with him than before, humouring his questions and accusations with a faint, understanding smile. Nodding at all the right points as he futilely argues for Steve’s exoneration. “We’re not arresting him, we just want to have a word with Captain Rogers.”
? – looms before him. He’s still too dizzy to make out the form, but going by the way light is reflected off the person’s left bicep, images and sounds start trickling in. A deluge of information, too quick to process – his head lolls backward and thumps against a wire mesh. He tries to move his arms. Locked. His ankles, too.
gained an honorary membership with the freak club. “Am I on the news already? It’s been two days since I thrashed my house with an army of Iron Man. If that doesn’t take the cake, I don’t know what will.”
“OK, how about…” Tony lurches from the sofa and wobbles on his feet a second. That’s enough scotch for the day. “You guys do room service?”
At that exact moment, a quartet of Agents – fully geared and totting MK5 – breaks past the canteen’s perimeter and scouts the surrounding. Tony instinctively shields his brows with his hand, and grows a sudden interest for the Calathea. Cocking his head to the right, his earpiece digging deeper, he whispers, “They’re onto me, Steve.”
What’s new about this anyway that sends him up the wall, making him so anxious and jumpy? Sex has always been his go-to choice of entertainment. There’s sadly no cunts in the vicinity, but handjobs are handjobs. If Steve keeps his mouth shut as Tony closes his eyes and pretends there’s a set of boobs hanging in his face, he’s golden.
“I apologise, Mr Stark,” she flushes, and instantly scoots a good yard away from her desk under Steve’s piercing gaze. “I didn’t know you were in between meetings.”
. He fumes in silence as something murky crosses Tony’s visage, and he doesn’t care. It has to be said, and he’s saying it. “I’ll let you know when we need you.”
“– World Security Council. I know the name. Don’t know him personally.” Tony winces again, and Steve pretends the spider web up the ceiling is rather interesting. “Go on. What about this Veech guy?”
“For as long as I can remember, I just wanted to do what was right. I guess I’m not quite sure what that is anymore.” Strange thoughts. He doesn’t give up. He
“It’s me,” Steve grits out breathlessly, his good hand clutching the other. “Just me. You’re safe, Tony. Just you and me.”
“Just stand there! Wait for it…” This is going to be nothing short of awesome. Steve watches him goof around with a holographic control panel, his hands bracing his waist, feet tapping to the tune Tony’s humming. “JARVIS, re-initialise sequence. Let’s switch things up a bit. Target to B2.”
“Captain Rogers? Is everything all right?” The cool, artificial intonation of JARVIS resounds in the monotony of the garage.
Tony wants to play hero this time. Man the wheel for as long as he can, get them to their destination single-handedly. Let Steve sleep to his heart content. He promises, the first thing Steve sees when he wakes up will be NJ’s famous local delight, the “Taylor Ham” Pork Roll. Is that what Happy calls it?
The gaping hole in his chest is closing. He’s lighting up again, his mouth wide open in a silent plea.
to spell it out to the politest person on Earth who wouldn’t take anything for granted. So, he does the whole rigmarole – tells Steve that there’s always a room for him at the Tower, that he welcomes Steve’s company anytime.
The debriefing is also quite the experience on its own. Steve has never seen Fury this chirpy, and he’s never harassed Tony by the end of it, not once. Though not one for flattery, Steve makes sure to highlight Tony’s contribution to the team, from the fact that he’s Avenging while on official leave, to his selfless sacrifice at the end.
the distraction, even for Steve and his bottomless volume of self-restrain. He draws in measured breaths to keep his head clear, and all the Zen bullshit just flies out of the window when Tony leans his back fully against the dash, legs spread as widely as he can on the seats.
Then, all the way from the far end of the corridor, something rattles – metal on metal – and it’s heading towards them. They stand up, the cacophony impossible to ignore. A pair of nurses half-jog through the large door, stainless steel crash cart in tow. They spare them not even a chance of glance. Tony hates this bit about hospitals. So much action, yet sometimes, so
Because he’s still lying in some sterilised foam bed with bars on the sides to keep him in place, with tubes snaking out of his wrists delivering drugs and whatnot, hooked to a heart monitor because it almost gave out on him not half a week ago? Tony understands the
– we’re talking public casualties and a one-way-ticket to life. For you. Oh well, at least you’ll outlive your wardens and fellow lifers. That’ll be fun to watch. I promise to visit.”
That’s how Steve ends up ploughing into an abandoned Cineplex, backed up by a six-man-strong STRIKE team extracting hostages, because some psychos are holding up an auditorium of people at gunpoint, demanding an obscene amount of money. To clarify, those guns are reverse-engineered Chitauri tech. That bit warrants the Avengers’ intervention – sorry, he means
remember how many teaspoons of sugar Steve adds into his tea – none – and that Steve doesn’t like jalapeno in his burgers. It’s fascinating – watching Steve – and savouring life by the second. He’s lunching with his eyes not glued to his phone or laptop for a change. He’s not thinking about a two o’clock appointment. This must be what wise men say to stop to smell the roses. Steve does smell something pleasant… it draws him in –
“Get down. There’s a catch somewhere.” There’s always an underground bunker for an underground bunker with SHIELD. He just has to find it. This might not be an air-raid shelter, but some form of cover is better than none. In the dust and ashes on this good earth, he places his faith.
Tony isn’t asleep. He may not stir, he may not respond when Steve calls his name, but he guarantees the heavens above. Tony Stark is not asleep.
As with the barricade, a warehouse – what must be the base of operation – pops abruptly into view as they drove past an ominous signboard that says, “Caution; bear in area!”. Their truck rumbles on before it parks itself near an entryway, guarded by heavily armed SHIELD agents twice the size of Steve Rogers.
Steve swats the burning stick from Tony’s grasp, and kicks the haystack into the rain. Blood drips onto the floorboard where a nail in the stick tore through the flesh of Tony’s palm. “It’s OK, let’s get that cleaned up. We can stitch it up, I know… how…”
“Tired.” The hands depart, each sliding sideways to hug along Tony’s flanks. They crawl upward, kneading the ribs. Tony instinctively holds his breath, until Steve returns to his shoulders. “Anxious, is the word, I believe.”
Tony jerks upright, eyes wide open like a raving loon. His elbow misses Steve’s nose by an inch. “What’s up? What happened?”
The helmet glows brighter as JARVIS speaks from the inset speakers. “Jackson Brice, alias, ‘The Goblin’, was an ex-employee of Toomes Salvage Company. In 2010, the company was forced into foreclosure once Damage Control officially takes over clean-ups post-Avenging.”
“Two incoming, my three o’clock,” Tony mumbles as he pointedly looks away. They’re occupying too much seat space, and he quickly lowers his duffel bag to the ground, between his ankles. “Don’t look like Agents to me.” A lady in her thirties accompanied by her male colleague amble towards them, entrenched in their conversation. As they come closer, Tong freezes up so bad that he doesn’t
They just crossed the state border into New Jersey. No roadblocks, no patrols on their trail. Steve is about to thrash this car and borrow another one to throw their pursuers off the scent… but the coast has been clear so far.
Steve drops his hand to Tony’s waist, and squeezes. His knee buckles and collides painfully with the stupid drawer of the desk. He turns around and leans his butt against the wood, and stares at Steve eyeball to eyeball. Daring. A sly smirk is plastered over Steve’s face, but it’s not unkind. He figures how his own mug looks like – given current circumstances – and it probably shows, because Steve’s grubby paws hesitate over the front of his zipper.
Tony takes the cloth off Steve and pulls him up by his underarm. “Come on, we can talk while we shower.”
“Why does it matter, you and I? You need this as much I do. May I, Tony?” Steve’s nose nuzzles against the crook of his shoulder. He’s
Steve isn’t a quiet worker. His head bobs with vigour, and he slurps. Saliva dribbles down his chin; the glistening track so clear for Tony to see when Steve changes angle to get
Cold metal arm grasps him by the waist, and though he can’t see it, he feels the blunt edge of the knife grazing the underside of his flaccid cock.
Tony Stark is Executive Vice President of Strategic Partnerships and Business Development of guess where, Cetta Therapeutics, a Boston-based biotech company specialising in virus specific T-cells, meaning, fucking
– God – that he’s about to accidentally swerve their car off the railing when his hand nearly grabs the steering wheel for purchase. His semen splatters unabashedly across the front of Tony’s suit and face.
Steve walks back to his room with two sets of sandwiches and steaming coffee, void of sugar and creamer. They don’t stock up on the finer things in this warehouse. He knocks on the Iron Man door twice, and opens it anyway when they go unanswered. At least Tony hasn’t locked him out of spite. Tony himself is lying on the second bed, his back against the door so Steve can’t see his face. No matter, Steve sighs, and closes the door behind him.
Steve turned to ask if he meant it but found himself mid-kiss, the scrape of Tony’s beard on his skin, the arm not letting go of his waist.  Tony pulled Steve’s shirt off him, muttering, “Seriously, Steve, where did you find this?” Steve blushed a little, but managed to strip Tony’s clothes off just as quickly, licking every scrap of skin he could reach, shivering at the rough feel of Tony’s hands, trailing his hand down Tony’s chest.
He wasn’t going to get a reply, was he? Flying had abandoned him.  Flying had left him.  Maybe it was just being outed.  Maybe it was the spotlight.  Maybe it was the fact that everyone was talking about him at school—hell, on the news.
“Hey, Flying.  Same here.  I’ve got a secret too, and it’s like I’m hiding who I am, every day.  From everyone.  All the closest people to me.  But I just can’t tell them.  I’m gay, too. It feels like I’m putting on this mask, this shell of who I think they want me to be.  Even though I don’t think my friends would judge me.  I don’t know why.  I just.  I’ve got a secret.  –Shell”
Tony shook his head.  “Nah, J’s got everything covered.  Just come over at eight.” He walked off, stuffing his hands down into his pockets.
Finally, Steve commended Tony’s switch-backs and his communication.  Steve always wanted more communication, and Tony was trying.  He preened internally, giddy and blushing, but just nodded at Steve. “No prob, Cap. Whatever you need.”
that you are here to work for Mr. Stark.  Aren’t you, Happy?” she asked, somehow intimidating for such a small woman.
Her look was full of understanding.  “I can give you a day.  Remember that when the sun falls on your skin, my dreams will evaporate.”
Bucky looked unconvinced, unable to hold back a quick, “I told you though, Nat, the man was ogling Steve’s ass like it was ice cream on a hot day!” as he pulled on his shirt.
Speak of the devil. A rumbling motorcycle pulled up in front of the house, and Brock Rumlow got off, hanging his bucket helmet over one handlebar.  Tony noted that he was favoring his left side heavily, and moved like he was extremely sore.  Good.  Asshole deserved whatever Steve dished out.
Tony felt oddly vulnerable.  “Peachy, cupcake.” He just felt… bristly.  Who was this kid to judge? Still, he knew part of it was embarrassment.  He’d used to be a genius, billionaire, playboy philanthropist.  Now he’d just have to settle for three out of four.  Nobody wanted a man who looked like he stepped out of a scifi movie.  Except for cosplayers.  And that wasn’t really his type.  He grabbed the mug, getting ready to shove Steve out of his bedroom.  Ironic, he thought, given that he’d normally have liked having life-size-Ken
Scenario three: Tony was listening to some type of new music that Steve wasn’t familiar with.  He’d been blindsided by Britney Spears, after coming out of the ice, asking if they’d replaced singers with robots.  Tony’d said, yes, and this was one of the best, playing four or five of her songs on repeat for him before laughing until he couldn’t breathe.  After that, he’d teased him mercilessly about it, looking over at Steve whenever they ended up fighting robots and saying, “this is your fault, should’ve worn a warning” and following that up immediately with “oops, I did it again,” rolling his eyes and winking. It was the best part of his day, and the worst.  It felt like flirting, but it was just Tony being Tony.
“What the hell, Wilson?” Tony started, looking up at the door.  Jesus. Tony’s workbook fell to the floor as he trailed Sam to the double doors.  A tall cop was loading Steve into the back of a squad car while another was clearly trying to calm a visibly irate Peggy.  Tony just made it outside when Principal Fury started shooing everyone back inside, rumors churning around him.  Tony’s last glimpse before he was squished back into the hallway was Hammer on a stretcher and Gilmore Hodge sporting a black eye.
Sorry, sort of still reeling from all that.  When did I know I was gay… Okay this is going to be really embarrassing.  Do you remember that documentary they did on that group of scientists heading up past the ISS? That sounds super nerdy, I know; it was called
Natasha looked at Bucky sternly, then put her hands over his ears, a funny expression on her face. “Steve,” she started.
Steve pulled almost all the way out, still a little slower than Tony seemed to want him, then pushed his way back, watching the rim stretch around him, feeling the little shivers of Tony being too full, too stretched.  He sped up, watching Tony’s face, making sure he was feeling pleasure rather than pain, pausing to spread more lube on himself, picking up the pace again.  Tony’s cock was flushed and swollen, damp at the head. Steve swirled his thumb around the head and brought it to his mouth, sucking at the bitterness, savoring the taste of him. He held Tony’s eyes as he did, and Tony clamped down almost painfully on him, the drag tight and unyielding as Tony came, spurting mess all over his chest, on Steve’s stomach.  Steve rocked into him, gently, tiny movements as Tony shook.
Tony thought of how lonely that must make him.  Having no one.  Even Tony had his people, the ones who he knew would be there for him, in the end.  He had Rhodey, and Happy. And Pepper.  Even now.  He didn’t know how Steve could bear it. Sometimes he thought he could see it, in the ridge of his shoulders, in the way he stood tall, somehow taller than he should be, as if bearing up against the weight of invisible burdens, alone.
Pepper and Rhodey made their way out together, in intense discussion about Barnes and Romanoff.  She turned back at the door, looking at the pair still standing inside.  She took a deep breath, a smile settling across her face, and shut the door quietly behind her.
“Clearly you never took the sexual harassment training from SHIELD,” Tony broke in, unable to restrain himself. “See, that’s a bad touch right there, Rudolph.” Loki was really running with the horns thing, apparently.
“What? I’ve been working there for almost a month.  He’s friendly. We got to know each other pretty well. We’re friends. He told me to call him Tony.” It sounded pleading even to himself.
“Steve,” he said, clearing his throat, turning over in his arms. Good start.  Clever.  To the point. “I think we should take a break.”
“Steve.  Steven.  My mother was Italian, you know.  I will not have chicken fingers parmigiana with tinned pasta sauce in this house. I’m coming up there with you and I will show you how it’s done. Shut it down, J.” Tony swiped everything to the side of the screen, seeing Steve’s face reflected momentarily in the glass.  It didn’t hold the innocent expression he’d had a second before. It was downright devious. Sneaky bastard knew exactly what he was doing, asking Jarvis about tofu.  “You did that on purpose!” he claimed, whirling on Steve.
Steve was slightly consoled that at least Jarvis seemed to have Tony’s best interests in mind as   well.  But apparently there wasn’t anything either of them could do. How could Tony have built a system that left him so completely isolated? So completely vulnerable?
Barnes grinned, offering a fist in return. “It was only an airsoft, sir, no reason for him t’be bawlin’ like that.”
“Oh, a new project,” Tony said, waving his hands airily.  It wasn’t exactly true, he didn’t have an idea, but he would, after he found a few parts. That always sparked an idea.  He parked at Morita’s electronics.  It was tiny, but it stocked some weird parts that was difficult to get anywhere else. Mr. Morita would always smile secretively and say it was because of his Yakuza connections.  He was clearly joking, they’d been living in Fresno for three generations before they moved to New York, and Tony’d never met a more church-going family.  Mr. Morita just liked to joke around.
An hour later, Tony was freshly showered and ready for a debrief. He knew Steve would keep it quick, since they were supposed to go get Thai food for the team.  Sometimes they got delivery, but they liked to go to the Thai place together. It was a nice walk, and the owners were sweet.  Tony didn’t say so, but he thought Steve liked to check up on them, especially since they were empty nesters now. Besides, Mrs. Srisati doted on Steve, always stuffing the bag with a few extra boxes of something spicy. Couldn’t blame her, though. Steve was always hungry, and always charming without trying to be. That guileless appeal was one of Tony’s favorite things about him.  Although if he was making a list, it probably wouldn’t even rank in the top ten. Top twenty, even.  He shoved the thought aside.
“Thank you, Jarvis.  I was just wondering, do you, er, did you, have a… background… in London? I don’t mean to assume anything, it’s just.  Your voice reminds me of a friend of mine. It’s probably silly.”
, he admonished himself. Besides, Steve was Captain America.  Eventually he was going to find himself a pretty little nurse and buy a house with a white picket fence and have a kid and two and a half dogs.  Or something like that.  Tony might be flexible on a sexuality spectrum, but Steve, he was sure, was solidly in the “straight” category.
Jesus. Good thing Steve wasn’t a corporate spy. He’d seen the thing once? Twice? And he sketched a perfect replica from memory?
He’s played the fight over and over in his mind, always seeing Steve lifting that shield.  He’d thought Steve was going to kill him, even though he knows better.
Tony huffed a quiet laugh to himself.  If nothing else, it was a cute tag.  He watched the moon. Somewhere, distantly, he could hear people laugh.  A group of people, clearly having had a few drinks, stumbled past, singing a Queen song relatively on-key.  Their falsettos faded into the distance, erupting in a faint laughter.
Steve was unwilling to leave Tony alone, but he had to get the replacement.  “I’ll be right back,” he said, squeezing Tony’s hand. He raced downstairs, flung the rag off Dum-E, and seized the glowing cylinder, forgetting to hope that it was safe to touch. He sprinted back to the living room, snatching up the pair of pliers that were resting on the table.  Plucking the reactor out of Tony’s chest took all his courage, praying it didn’t hurt, talking to him the whole time. “I’m so sorry, sweetheart, please, just be okay, stay with me, it’ll be okay, you’ll be alright, sweetheart, please stay with me, don’t leave me—“ he detached a connector, holding his breath. God, this had better work.  He clipped in the new device, fitted it neatly into the cavity, and clutched Tony’s hands tightly.
“Hey, leave off him, Longhorn,” Tony said, irritably.  He wasn’t going to let Loki badger Steve. “Shift back, I already know I’m pretty.  Thor, get your brother under control, would you?”
“Alas, I wish I could,” Thor said, sighing heavily, used to this battle by now. “Come, now, brother. Leave Steven alone.”
Steve set down his notes as the others filtered in.  Hulk was still Hulked out, which was a little strange.  It was very strange, actually. If Steve metabolized the powder, Hulk should have by now, too. They were almost always at the same metabolic rate.  Funny the things you learn, working on this team, Tony thought.  Weirder still, Hulk seemed to have made red velvet cupcakes with yellow frosting, which he placed in front of Tony with a grunt. Natasha came in just behind him wearing what could euphemistically be described as a dress.  She ran a hand over Tony’s shoulder as she walked by him, winking.  Tony shrank back a little into his chair.  Steve saw the interaction and frowned, so Tony sat up a little straighter.  He didn’t want Steve to think he was going to be bad for group morale, he just didn’t know what Natasha was playing at. Finally Thor swept into the room, tossing his hair back over his shoulder.
Tony shook his head a little.  “And you love me?” His lungs burned and ached, trying to contain the shards of his heart, raw and rough.
“Brunch here, tomorrow, 11am, everyone’s invited. It’s mandatory,” Tony announced.  They had questions, he was sure.  He owed them all some answers.  About the arc reactor.  About Stane.
Tony had five screens open with ideas of what to make Steve for his Christmas exchange when his email pinged.
She smiled again at him, her voice stretching through his heart, a balm on a sore. “No one will come to harm, Captain, unless it be you.  It will only last for a day, after all. But you must be certain what you wish for.  Knowing the consequences.”
“I’m sorry I hurt you. I couldn’t let you. Not when it, not when it wasn’t him,” Steve continues, like he’s heard Tony’s thoughts.  The unfortunate side effect, Tony thinks, of working so well as a team.  Anticipating each other’s moves.
Nomad keeps a low profile for a few weeks. Sort of. Tony notices that some of the robots lying in the rubble after the next battle don’t have repulsor blasts on them.  He’d been on this one alone.
“I do have a place like that. Or, it’s a place where everything makes sense.  Where I can just be me. It’s not perfect, it’s at home, and there’s always a danger that my dad will walk in and yell at me, but in that room, it’s my own space.
“What’s up with you, man?” Sam asked, afterward. “You normally don’t put me through my paces like that. Something bothering you or did you just decide I must have been skimping on leg day?”
“No, Tony,” Steve said gently, turning his head to softly kiss Tony’s palm. “His greatest creation is you.”
Tony gagged, self-loathing and recrimination trying to dislodge the canapes and apple juice.  He’d been disgusted with Stern, righteous in his indignation that the senator treated Steve like an object. But was he any better? He’d hired Steve because of his looks, jacked off to those looks not even five hours ago, and then tried to press himself on Steve in the limo. He was the same, trying to take advantage of that power, trying to use that prestige to make Steve his. His stomach roiled, rebellious, and his lungs ached.  It was probably psychosomatic, but he thought he could feel the arc reactor flicker, dimming a little.
Steve turned. “Thanks for coming to get me, Mr. Stark.  You must have been following me for a while.  I’m sorry I wasn’t paying attention.” The words were perfectly polite.  They were perfectly neutral.  Careful.  Tony was sure if he poked, if he prodded, there was something just below the surface.  Guilt, maybe.  For what?
He’d looked at Steve’s file back when Rhodey had handed it over.  Rogers had been to see a doctor all of twice.  He’d been in to two counseling sessions and then waived the rest.  No fault on the doctors.  They’d been overworked.  And it wasn’t like anyone was going to get Steve back in to see another one when his mind had been made up against it, the stubborn fool.  But Steve’s nightmares were clearly not new or unexpected. Tony thought, knowing Steve as much as he did now, the soldier probably didn’t want to impose.  Probably felt like he didn’t deserve the help as much as other people did, always selling himself short.  The VA shouldn’t have to count pennies when it came to helping veterans.  And Tony could help out a little.  In recognition of the men and women who had been with him in Afghanistan.  In recognition of Steve.
Steve kissed him again, because he could, because it made him happy, because it made Tony smile, because home was wherever Tony was. “Anywhere.”
Steve felt nonplussed.  He held out his hand.  Stark took it, but dropped it quickly.  “Jesus,” he said again.
There had been no nightmares this time. No costumes in mind.  Just Tony, brilliant and magnetic. Steve was fucked.
I know, I'm super slow.  Also, I don't have a beta, so all the mistakes are completely mine. But, like most needy, insecure authors, I live for comments.
“Flying, I get what you’re saying about not wanting to disappoint, or complicate. I don’t really feel that way about my dad, but my mom is already—” Tony broke off.  How did he say it? It wasn’t that she didn’t care. She did. He was sure of it.  But she wasn’t strong. It’s like she wasn’t strong enough to handle Howard and love Tony, too.  She only had enough for one of them.  And in a way, handling Howard was part of loving Tony, part of being his mother.  She’d talked his way out of several beatings.  After the first grade yearbook photo, she made sure Howard didn’t find the stain on his new shirt.  Sure, she took it to Jarvis, but that was her way.  She loved him.  And he didn’t want to give Flying the impression that she didn’t.  So: “my mom is already taking on a lot.  I don’t want to make her do more, either.  So yeah, I see exactly what you mean.
She raised an eyebrow at him, clearly understanding at least some of what he was thinking. She didn’t know about the whole story, but she obviously read the hormones Tony was thinking about throwing.  “Him?”
He’s wearing restraints.  It was a requirement he’d made for coming back with Tony to the tower.  They’re coded to Tony’s commands, something he’d made when they were together, something they’d never gotten to try.  Tony is struck by how not sexy this is.  He’s struck by how easily he could call Ross, deliver him his most desired fugitive.
Tony stiffened for a second, then relaxed, arms winding briefly around Steve’s torso.  “Go,” he said again. It was just unfair that he had to keep telling the man to leave, when all he really wanted to do was keep him. But, Steve wasn’t his to keep.  Wasn’t anyone’s.
Bruce just shook his head.  “I don’t know, Tony. The Force operates outside of the physical realms as we know it. I don’t know that we have enough data to come to a conclusion on it.”
“—he told Steve to get out of his way, told him to move, and the sweet idiot just says, ‘No, you move,’ and lets the monster swing at him! Meanwhile Peter’s scampered off, like Steve told him to, because at least the child has a working sense of self-preservation!” Peggy took a deep breath, still clearly fuming.
He schmoozed with the British kids and told them he was interested in palladium replacements for his clean energy project at their earliest conveniencce.  No need to go into specifics.  As he shuffled his drink to grab his business cards, Steve materialized to deftly hold it for him.  Where had he come from?
Tony’d written when he got an A on a quiz.  Flying had congratulated him. Like he meant it.  Like he was proud of him.
When Tony finished off the last of his fries, Steve slid a small heavy jar over to him. His eyes were on the little glass jar, avoiding Tony’s gaze, uncertain of his gift’s welcome.
“The deal? Not the secret?” Tony’s heart was hammering and he thought he might vomit, his knuckles white where he was gripping the steering wheel.
Dr. Erskine had wandered over and now stood close to Steve.  “Ah, the famous Miss Potts, I assume?  Steve speaks highly of you.  And you must be the other half of the ‘best looking part of the track team’?” he nodded teasingly at Rhodey.  “And Tony Stark, of course.  Your reputation precedes you, of course.  I read the paper you wrote for Selvig on the scientific accuracy of
He checked his email at 9am. He got to sleep in, his parents were gone, no one cared what he did, and he’d had a late night.
So did you ever have a crush on your best friend? I haven’t, I don’t know why. Just wondering.” That was casual right? That didn’t sound worried?  Totally casual. Just dropped in.
Tony reaches out with the back of his hand, his palm away from Steve, even with no gauntlet. He strokes the back of his fingers down Steve’s cheek.  Steve shudders, his whole body trembles, his eyes close, his lashes are damp. Tony’s eyes are wet and his lungs are burning.
He turned the television back to CNN, watching in a daze as the news cycle picked up Tony’s story instead, then shifted to talking about “today’s teens” and if there were major psychological problems with them.  His email stayed empty.  At three am, he went to bed.
“Right, well, um, speaking of communication, has anyone heard from Jane recently?” Tony asked desperately.  He was very confused.  Maybe Thor didn’t realize what he was implying.  After all, Asgardians were bound to have different customs and social cues.
“Oh, of course,” Steve said, blushing further. “I should have realized.  I didn’t mean to sound inconsiderate.” Was it inconsiderate to remind an AI that he missed a childhood?
Steve looked out the window for a moment.  The sun would set soon.  “I just need a break.” He turned back, smiled. He was pretty sure it looked natural.  “I’ll be back, Tony.  And I’m around if you need me.”
“Steve,” he said softly, staying at the threshold to the kitchen. He wanted to give Steve space, clearly indicate that he wouldn’t try anything again.  That he wasn’t like Stern. Wasn’t like Howard.
Mindful of the company, of the politics, of all the good he was trying to do, trying to leave Pepper on solid ground, trying to build a legacy that would grow instead of a weapons company, all he said was, “Sounds a little like coercion to me. Not really my style.” He turned to find Steve and give him an errand—to go see Pepper, to find the Fountain of Youth, honestly, anything to get him out of Stern’s reach—but Steve was nowhere to be found.  He’d disappeared, his presence only known by a fresh glass of apple juice on the rocks.
Fury had personally escorted him to his new apartment.  He wasn’t sure if that was supposed to be comforting or a threat, a reminder that Fury was the one who put him in the apartment and he’d damn well always know what Steve was doing.  Of course, Fury was also the one who had set him up with his bank account, a little plastic card to get money, walked him down to a SHIELD therapist and told him to get his damn head on right, that a war was coming and he’d better be ready.
“No! That wasn’t the deal, Hammer,” Tony whispered back.  “I said I’d invite you places, I can’t change whether she likes you or not!”
Steve quickly dropped to his knees.  Otherwise, he’d ogle, and Tony would know he was ogling. He knelt next to the shirt, opening the cabinet under the sink to look for a first-aid kit.  He didn’t see Tony’s eyes get even wider and his jaw drop.  By the time he’d found it, Tony’d managed to close his mouth and tell himself to calm down, instead muttering curses at the bundle on the chair.
“Er, Tony, do you…” Steve began, looking over at him. He clearly didn’t know exactly how to finish the question. Maybe this was some sort of post-witch ritual on Asgard?
Then his conversation with Professor Selvig was interrupted by his least favorite politician—a stocky orange man, dripping insincerity in his shiny suit: Senator Stern.
And Christ, Stark was a mess.  Daddy issues on pseudodaddy issues the likes of which Steve hadn’t even imagined before he’d gone under.  Sure, Howard Stark had been a megalomaniac, smooth-talking dick, but not the cold angry sort.  Not the abusive sort.  But Steve understood the brittle shell Tony Stark had created, he understood the incessant need to be the brightest and the best.  He understood where it came from.  Steve wondered when Howard had changed.  What had changed him.  An uncomfortable little piece of him wondered if it was—but no, that was hubris. He could have smacked himself with how arrogant he’d been tending.  What a prig, Peggy would have said.  Bucky would have just called him an asshole.  He’d have been right.
In the last email, he’d told Tony that his mother was dead, had died a few years ago. The way that he missed her was palpable, even through email.  And he wished that he could have told her that he was gay, before she died, that he wished he could have shared that part of himself with her.  That he wished he were that brave.
“That was fun, Tony, thanks,” Steve remarked afterward. “It’s like chess, in a way; you can think through the whole board.”
“It’s better than not being with you,” Steve says.  He’s quiet. But he’s also pale.  And he’s lost a lot of blood. He leans up against a wall, trying to look casual.
Steve reached up, stroking down Tony’s throat, calming him.  “Tony.  I love you.” He stretched up to kiss him.  “Whatever you want, sweetheart. Just tell me. I’ll give you anything.”
“Can’t blame h—him,” Tony caught himself at the last minute.  They would make a cute couple though.  Have gorgeous, sparkly-eyed babies.  “Does Pep want us to head over now? To her place?”
Steve got to work cleaning him up, holding him securely in those broad, gentle hands. Soap and water first, then a soft cloth to dry him off, antiseptic, and two large bandaids.  Tony grinned defensively when Steve opened them and found his shield spangled across them.  “It was in a multi-pack,” he said.  “I’ve already used up all the Mjolnir ones.” It wasn’t, and he didn’t.  But nobody needed to know that.
It was later that Natasha gave him the best gift he could hope for this year: his paperwork from Matt Murdock.  His assets were legally separated.  He started moving out immediately, Dum-E going into the new apartment first.  Howard and Maria were in Portugal for the next month.  Tony had completely moved out of the house by the New Years.  He told Flying that his internet might be spotty, but Flying said he was going to be gone anyway. In fact, all of Tony’s friends IRL were out of town for the break, getting back only the night before school started. He didn’t bother telling them where he lived yet, the new place.  He’d invite them all over on Monday, when they got back.  Until then, he’d be alone.  Still, being lonely was better than being stuck at home with his father.
“You’re everything I want, Tony. Everything.” Steve rolled so he covered Tony, his back to the sun, fully drowning in light, touching him everywhere, fingertips burning, rolling his hips against Tony’s thighs.
Tony smothered his laugh in Steve’s neck.  “Or at least he’ll know what I was thinking about when I was making them.” He pulled himself up and kissed Steve between words. “You. Are. Devastatingly. Sexy.”
Steve smiled to himself.  When Natasha did ask Bucky, he’d definitely say yes.  Figures he’d ask about her before asking if he was back in the program for his arm.  “Yeah, she said she couldn’t leave your ugly mug.”
Tony was surveying him.  He sort of imagined that Steve wouldn’t appreciate being called GI Joe, either.
A woman in a dark, slinky dress floated over and joined the conversation, introducing herself as Maya.  She handed Tony a scotch and kissed him on the cheek.  Maybe not a first meeting then. Steve stifled a flare of unaccountable resentment, chiding himself for his irrational reaction.
Tony closed his mouth.  Maybe Rogers was putting them all up to this, in return for the other day when Tony had Rickrolled him.
In mid-afternoon, Tony went down to the shop, muttering about Clint’s explosive arrow tips needing a more targeted blast.  But he held onto Steve’s hand as he went, and Steve was more than happy to go along with him.  He settled onto the couch where he sometimes sat.  Tony tossed him a sketchpad he’d produced from seemingly nowhere, and Dum-E wheeled over happily with a set of watercolors.  Steve was surprised by how domestic his day had been.  How sweet Tony was to him.  It was as if he’d been dropped in the middle of a relationship that had been going for years, and it felt.  Well, it felt like home.  The casual way Tony would bump into him and smile.  The way it felt natural to pull him into a hug, kiss his hair.
Tony sighed internally, and looked briefly at Steve, standing next to Pepper at the side of the room. They made a lovely couple, tall, fair, athletic.  He brought himself back to the question. “Actually, I’m not in the market for supermodels, Russian or otherwise. And no, I, and SI, would never sell weapons to enemy combatants.  As you know,” he glanced toward Steve again, apologetic, “I owe a great deal to our men and women in the service, and I would never betray their trust. As for Dubai,” he hesitated slightly, checking his phone almost imperceptibly, “no. We’re trying to track the money from the sales, transactions made without the company’s knowledge or mine, and we think that money trail ends in Libya. We’re working with our teams to liaise with the Libyan government.”
Tony scoffed, almost a laugh, brittle and self-mocking. He toyed with his watch, twisting it around his wrist until it left red marks.  “Normally? Normally all I have to do is have one sip, and then suddenly I’ve had more drinks than I remember.  Normally I just have to smell the alcohol underneath the peat and sweetness.  Normally I have Happy pour me into the limo and then I lock myself down for the next couple days.  It’s usually real messy, the first couple hours.  Kinda messy for a day or so.  And then I get it back under control.” He took a deep breath.
A message pops up in his HUD, front and centre and it says flap deployed. And then it’s the summer breeze in his face, a telling splash immediately after, before the cool, dark depth of the Potomoc claims him. Despite initial velocity, he hits the water softly. He’s still in one piece. Just him alone. Having absorbed all the damages, his suit – now a useless shell – is lifeless as it sinks to the bottom of the river.
“Something amusing?” Steve gasps from above him, and Tony quickly wipes off the stupid smirk he doesn’t realise he has on his face.
into it, figured if it was advantageous if we could, you know, pre-empt crimes, just like what your buddies in SHIELD are trying to do.”
There are worse ways to go than in a burst of fireworks. Sparks shooting from his ears, maybe. The end of times.
Another low moan breaks the silence. What it means is unmistakable – what Tony is doing in the confinement of his own goddam room, door open and inviting – and Steve retreats, a step at a time, until he’s all the way back in the elevator going back to the forty-fifth floor, wondering if
He lets himself in, and finds Tony slowly rousing from the couch facing a floor-to-ceiling window. He’s wearing some sort of ultra-modern glasses, every aspect of it is transparent, and there are blue lines running across the eyepieces. Chic, but unfortunately does nothing to hide the wearer’s hammered profile. He takes one good look at Steve where he’s seated and yawns once more, long and wide.
In the end, Mr Tough Guy withholds cereal drinks, and provides them with only plain water. Out of sympathy – Tony plays up his look of distraught, eighty five percent of it was all him anyway – and he gets away with a carton of instant ramen and bread.
this latest shenanigan. It’s a problem of course to be under such microscopic scrutiny, but for Steve, this is doubly worse.
It takes two beeps before Pepper picks up the call. She does not speak immediately into the phone, and it drives Steve up the wall because he neither has the time nor patience to deal with
“We’ll want to heighten security level after this, won’t we?” His eyes twinkle, and so do hers as she catches on to his intentions.
Barnes falls to his knees, and he bows over Steve. Their noses are almost touching, and Tony stops swimming against the current. He raises a fist above the water surface, and squeezes out his last ounce of strength. Whatever he can get out of Extremis – a flaming cannonball, a firecracker, a cluster of hot steam – he wills into existence.
“Leave SHIELD, Steve.” The bench trembles under their weight as Tony shifts his. “I mean it. If someone wants me to jump into a swimming pool, I’d like the water to be clear. SHIELD is as clear as
Threatening people so they bow to his commands isn’t quite his MO, but there’s something about Tony that’s
voice blares through them. “Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. You’ve heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it’s time you know the truth.”
“The ship serves as a mobile satellite launch platform. It was sending up its last payload when pirates took them. STRIKE was mobilised ninety-three minutes later.” Steve pulls off the rest of his clothes and uses his soiled pants to wipe off residual semen off his thighs.
we need his expertise, son. Sit down. Nick,” Steve tries appealing to the biggest cheese in the room. “Please.”
It’s not a good year for Stark Industries without the government or NGOs threatening to either sue his pants off or throw him into jail. He admits, when General Scudder-what’s-his-face gave him an ultimatum, he nearly wets his pants.
a spy, aren’t you?” Goodman hisses, the vein in his temple swelling. People have such an imagination around here.
Tony is lost as Steve engulfs him whole in his mouth. His hand flies to clutch at the top of Steve’s head instinctively, stray strands of hair peeking between his white-knuckled fingers. His back arches into the warmness and slickness of what he thought as forbidden. He can’t stop. He’s gone off the deep end and he doesn’t care if this becomes one of
clamp down on his shoulder, coming there and then into Steve’s hand. Semen runs between his fingers, and swirls into the drain hole. Some splatter against the front of Steve’s shirt.
“Mr Stark,” he greets charmingly, and invites himself into the backseat. He nods at Steve, and says, “What can I do for you, Captain?”
The mugshot of the masked, metal-armed assassin replaces Schmidt’s. Next on is a CCTV footage so grainy it doesn’t mean much, but the silver arm is unmistakable.
Steve pulls away, God, the tip of his tongue just barely caressing the plump edge of Tony's lip. And air –
Steve runs his plans by him, which he finds palatable, and that is saying a lot because nothing short of a miracle that a wanted fugitive and a dead man can do to unmask one of the world’s most trusted, and guarded intelligence agency. Steve’s knack for exploiting the best his men can offer shows.
But Tony stays put, even when Steve stops padding around the room in search for an excuse to afford Tony some privacy. No amount of towel adjusting can hide his raging erection, and he’s not sure if he’s ready to acknowledge the fact that a man’s touch is enough to send all the blood gushing to his downstairs brain.
“This what you want, Stark?” Steve bites into an earlobe. Deftly, he unbuckles Tony’s belt and leaves it to dangle freely from the waistband. “Paying for sex, imagine that. When you can have this.” He shoves his hand down the front – Tony has gone commando – and pumps the full length with fervour.
Tony sets his glass on the coffee table and yawns. Money is what makes the world go round. Money is probably the only reason girls keep throwing themselves at him. They never thanked him for his magnificent lovemaking skills, only the wad of cash he stuffs in their bras and panties. Hell, money gave him the best wanking he ever had.
“Say stop, and I will,” Steve promises again in a whisper as he leans in… and Tony promptly cocks his chin sideway. That’s all on the brainstem. Reflex. Steve gets the hint and backs up somewhat, but something inside Tony shrivel up a little. He’s still rock hard – guy downstairs probably does a cheer of its own when Steve cups him in a palm – and he thrusts into it. He welcomes the heat, the friction, and he can’t stop –
On cue, Dum-E brandishes the gauntlet that is now charred on the front side of the palm. Overheating, probably. It
Clint has to pick his jaw up from the carpet when he locks eyes with Steve from across the hallway. He looks
too is among them, Steve notices belatedly. He’s sleeping, his body sprawling across the two-seater like an oversized octopus, legs dangling off the armrest. A thick book is spread atop his chest, one hand splayed over its cover to keep it in place.
Next Monday morning, on the steps of Capitol Hill, as they ascend shoulder-to-shoulder, a slew of press crews surrounds them, pressing for answers. Tony takes all the questions in his stride, his voice rings true. He apologises that the issue got out of hand. He reiterates that the Avengers are on this case. There’s an industrial saboteur to be held responsible. He tells them that they mean no disrespect, and they’re grateful for the outpouring support that has come forth since the clip was shared on Facebook.
– when a suspiciously familiar voice says right on the other side, “Have you seen Captain Rogers on the compound?”
“Tony,” Steve greets him. The inflection in his voice suggests he isn’t expecting Tony to meet him so soon. “I told Bambi not to bother you.”
“Shit.” They both wince as the window above their head smashes when pierced by a bullet. “What’s the plan?”
Steve is where Bambi says he is, loitering around the foyer, still as fresh-looking as the last time Tony sends him packing into SHIELD’s SUV. He too is admiring Howard’s portrait. It’s not exactly easy to ignore it. Very in-the-face. While Tony looks at Howard with indifference, Steve’s visage is anything but. Entirely understandable, in theory. Howard spent more time looking for Steve in the waters than he did raising his own son. He might’ve given up on Steve at some point, but he pretty much given up on a lot of things by then, and Tony had become too cynical to care.
Steve’s hand that’s still holding him still by his jawline slides downward, past his throat, past his collar, until it rests right atop the cold metal that is the arc reactor. “This gives you any problem lately?”
“They’re already looking at us funny.” Steve commandeers Tony’s cock with his free hand. “Don’t hold back.”
Steve suspects just as much. The world may not have woken up to the news of war hero Captain America’s return, but SHIELD has. SHIELD dregs him from the frozen seas, and breathes air into his breasts. They haven’t seen the wrath of Steve Rogers, but there are tales from the Wars. He’s the largest threat standing between Project Insight, and world’s peace.
“JARVIS?” His voice is like fingernails on a blackboard. Weakly, he kicks out with his left leg, but his suit won’t give. It’s not interfaced with his body. So, it’s dead. Why is it dead? “J, please. You here? Let me out! God –”
“I uh, took a leak. Fertilised that tree right there, see?” Again, his heart skips a beat and his mouth dries up. Early onset of arrhythmia what-not, please, not now.
“I am,” his voice trails off, and he takes a deep, calming breath. He does owe Tony the truth. “I am so, so sorry for what I did to you. And that’s why I’m leaving.”
“I think about this sometimes when I’m away. Did you check if it’s still leaking metal into your blood?”
“Looking for this?” Steve’s question is a breath away from his earlobe. “I found it on the coffee table outside.” His wallet has strangely made its way into Steve’s hand.
“Sir is currently driving a 1952 Chevrolet pickup. There are no accessible computer circuits to access.”
“I know what this is. What it does,” Steve comments impassively, and pushes the rest of the fabric off Tony’s back. “I won’t use it against you. That, I promise.”
Steve’s proximity is claustrophobic, and his heart thumps maddeningly in his ribs. He tries to tear himself away from the desk, and backs into Steve, who for reasons unknown remains steadfastly rooted to the ground – and inside Tony’s personal space. A warm gust of air blows past his nape. “I know what else you’re looking for.”
“Yeah? Watch me –” and he’s suddenly pinned against the side of the car, his front flushed against the window. Zippers, so many zippers bite into his chaffed flesh while Steve and his dead weight is all but against him. “Get off me.”
As grown adults, sharing living quarters with fellow Avengers mates has its upsides and downsides. Steve is more than happy to trade seamless Assembly for decline in privacy. It’s either the Tower, or SHIELD barracks anyway. Same difference. Actually, scratch that. Sharing living quarters with
Still, a bunch of LEDs aren’t enough to illuminate the grounds. They stumble around half-blind, and Tony makes sure to stay half a step behind Steve. “Place still looks familiar? Changed much?”
Tony only realises how far gone he is when the receptionist tells him the next day that Steve is on leave.
“… Spare him. He’s no use to you dead. Killing him won’t change anything.” Steve’s trembles worsen as he speaks, and Tony holds on to him tighter. Can’t believe after jumping through hoops of fire, a bleak sequel awaits. There is no turning back, no more returning to the time before he went on national TV and screamed I’m-Iron-Man into the cameras. Teach him not to run his mouth, didn’t it? Ross, a Winter Soldier on the loose, the Extremis. Accountability for his tech. A bloodless legacy. A promising future?
sex recording Steve swears has been permanently etched into his retinas. Somehow, the buffering bar with the status “Deleting…” does not assuage the annoyance that is bubbling under Steve’s façade of nonchalance. He grips the handle of the floor-to-ceiling door – those implements that can only be moved by either machineries or three other men throwing their body weights at to get an inch of movement? – and effortlessly pulls at it that the door swings to a close and slams right behind him.
Steve exerts just enough force to push past the tight barrier. Certainly too much for a first-timer to handle. Tony’s clenches up, and Steve stills. They go on this dance, gaining entry by the inch as Tony’s body learns to accept Steve. His cock has gone flaccid with what must be searing agony, but he makes not a single squeak, and Steve’s heart squeezes when he remembers this body he’s fucking has suffered through worse. And here, the Extremis is a God-sent. By the time Steve is fully sheathed, Tony has recovered enough that he’s back to masturbating, working his cock into a respectable rigidity.
“I thought the punishment usually comes after the crime. I stand by what I said to Nick, by holding a gun at everyone on Earth and calling it protection? This isn’t freedom. This is fear.”
Steve isn’t a man with many possessions. Everything he has can be fitted inside two large luggage, which he parks right beside the door of his bedroom. If he leaves the Avengers, he leaves the Tower. He promises not to suddenly drop off the surface of the Earth. This… career, these things that he does to uphold the Dream has been his purpose for being. He doesn’t need the Avengers to fight the fights. Fury says his living quarters in DC is still available. Hasn’t been touched since he left for New York.
“What are you going to do?” Tony asks and his philtrum itches and he wants to scratch it, but if the nanofiber coating comes off, his moustache will show on his lady-face, and since the circus isn’t in town…
When in the quiet, Tony finally turns around to pat him on his head – gentle fingers running through his hair and pawing his scalp – he lets the tears run freely.
There’s sand in his nostril, Christ. Coal in his throat. His brows and hair are nicely singed. He coughs, and God, his throat is so raw like it’s flayed. Is he?
“It’s the best we got. The engineers tweaked the frequency. If you see Agents coming for you, you run.”
“Feels like we woke up the wrong side of the bed and fell through a wormhole. Into an alternate universe or something. Congratulations, by the way. You’re officially a criminal.”
“Mr Stark! What is the reason behind exposing this video on Facebook? Do you suspect malicious attempt by a specific group, perhaps a case of defamation –”
surrounding him. He’s a mess, God, he’s a mess in here, but he knows deep down that this is right. Gripping the edge of the case, he fully embraces the sweltering heat and flames, and completes the destruction of his arc reactor.
“Invited. It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic values. They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own.” Zola’s mugshot fades out, and is immediately replaced by a silhouette of the Red Skull, and the ominous HYDRA emblem.
“Yeah, my downstairs brain has been thinking… that I’m ready to try something new.” Then, Tony tugs Steve’s waistband down to the knees, and playfully cups at Steve’s taut sacs. “Fuck me.”
Steve runs his fingers through his hair. “Fine. Can you patch this line to Miss Potts’, please? She should be at the Malibu campus.”
a concrete barricade. They should’ve crashed, but the drive is still as smooth as silk, like the barricade he sees is thin air. He turns around so abruptly his neck creaks, and lordy, there it is – the barricade their truck just runs into, intact and pristine.
By nightfall, Steve decides to hell with everything because he owes an old friend an apology for wrongly assuming Tony is doing this for kicks and giggles, as if this incident has no implications on him and his company at all. Steve brushes his teeth and waits until it’s close to nine o’clock, assuming Tony will be home at this hour, and then makes his ascend to Tony’s private suite again. The front door is unlocked, which itself is not odd. There’s minimal lighting escorting his way upstairs, also not odd. The bedroom door is ajar, and Steve drops his posture to a quiet creep, because
, but a cakewalk for the Captain, no? You rescued some hostages, arrested some pirates, no casualties, no losses. No real reason to get all sulky now, is there?”
Be that as it may, he instructed Tony to secure the perimeter while he land the Quinjet, and to rendezvous at the hangar in ten. So naturally, Tony strolled down the lower decks all on his own. Five minutes later, Steve heard screams and grunts blaring from his earpiece and he landed the Quinjet on water and swam all the way onboard. By the time he reached Tony in one of the storerooms, he was greeted with what he could only describe as pandemonium. There were char marks in every corner, courtesy of the repulsor blasters, and a battalion of heavily armed individuals strewn lifelessly around them. All incapacitated via non-lethal means, of course, but it sure was a drag triaging them, and then securing lifeboats and rescue choppers to cart them off to the nearest hospital, and then staying back to sweep the area for evidence – intact and destroyed.
trust SHIELD with your health.” Tony’s knuckle raps exceptionally hard on the table at that. “I’m just taking a leaf from your book.”
Tony follows Steve into the bathroom, but stops short of joining him in the shower. He really needs a trim… and his nostril hair is jutting out. He continues, “If they’re not robbing the ship, think… holding it ransom.” Steve starts the shower. “A bit too late to the party, though. Nine-three minutes too late. Those pirates should consider firing their event manager. How many of them again?”
He towels himself dry and almost walks out half-naked, when regret prickles at his consciousness and he puts on his old clothes. He almost…
Now only things start to make a lick of sense: the suit takes him in, goes on stealth mode and makes its way to one of the five designated “safehouses” around the country, because he’s paranoid like that. He has contingencies
“I’m different now, Steve,” Tony snarls in his face, and wills the fire to erupt in his eyes. Steve’s expression pinches, but not of fear, and Tony’s insides wither. “I don’t need your pity.”
“After the discussion with Briggs, I’ll come forward and put a stop to this circus,” Steve says. “These rumours won’t do well to your image.”
Tony finally obliges, and slowly turns around and replaces his head on the pillow. He tries not to squirm so much, or
Steve jabs at the button and takes Tony by his elbow. He steers them both through another door of frosted glass. “Your security needs upgrading. Stop leaving your door unlocked.”
no life in the eyes that rest blankly on Steve’s features. As if nothing computes, and Steve shifts his weight a little in his meek attempt to catch Tony’s attention. Against his instincts, he reaches out for Tony’s wrist, and gently coaches him back to reality. Clint himself is tense beside him, ready to pounce at the slightest evocation of recognition. Of aggressiveness? They know this well. They know what it means to be haunted by the bygones.
, to be the champion of everything just and right, when the very institution he’s pledged his life to is crumbling before his very eyes.
From the tail of his eye, Steve notices Tony covertly holding his right hand behind his back. The wiggling middle finger is not a coincidence.
It’s a talking tablet, of course it is, it’s Tony’s. Every hunk of metal is near-sentient with the guy. How does he interact with it?
For the longest hour, Tony stands under the icy cold shower with his palms flat against the smooth tiles. Water dribbles down his nose and chin. His mind is numb. Hollow. Which never happens. He doesn’t care about an engine, an arc reactor, an automated toaster – because mankind needs one of those. He only turns off the tap when his fingers become gnarly, and the Extremis taps into his noggin wondering if he wants to puff his flesh out. No, thanks.
watching Tony steady himself, and take the plunge for more. He doesn’t go too deeply – once bitten, twice shy – and changes strategy. Just a slight turn of his chin, all the right spots in the head rub incessantly against his cheek. Still feels like deepthroating.
So what if they’re right where SHIELD wants them to be – cornered, without allies and resources? He’s not giving up.
The next hour is possibly the longest he has endured since the Ice Age. He scouts out the locale. Plenty of open spaces. No tall buildings, so no snipers. No blind spots. He can see cars coming from the distance, far enough to buy him time for hightailing. There are semblances of a neighbourhood towards the north, likely an abandoned construction. Only one way in, and his keen eyes are on it. It’s also the only way out. Aerial attacks and scouts are possible, but the skies stretch endlessly where he is.
, gone! Hell, he sent the note to SHIELD Forensics, and triple watched every surveillance recording within the Tower.”
Tony’s going out a limb here and assumes that by “Bucky”, Steve means James Barnes, some dude from the Howling Commando. That’s the name Steve put to the facial composite Tony made days ago. “Is Bucky your pal? James Barnes from the War?”
“I’m not.” Between wrestling Tony to the tarp and forcing him to sleep, and launching into another exhausting debate about personal care – or lack of – Steve sets himself a new task. “I’ll tell you what. I’ll make us a fire. It’s going to be freezing out here. You rest up.”
“Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suit. I’m pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, badass, baby brother.”
“Special?” Ross barks, amused. Tony smirks, but dread quickly fills up the recesses of his skull when Ross dangles an unassuming remote control from the end of his finger. “We’ve seen the videos. We know what you can do. You have all been under surveillance from the moment you left the Potomac. Consider your next word and action
Tony’s lips pursed, and he shakes his head. “Still the same. Hasn’t woken up. The doctor says anytime now, but.” Shockingly enough, the super-soldier serum doesn’t grant Steve invincibility. He was
Her nostrils flare, and Tony’s not sorry. “He said to call Dr Streiten from SHIELD medical if your symptoms get worse. I asked him what was going on with you
They don’t look like hired performers either. Or doppelgangers – no, he’s seriously watching himself and Tony lip-locking, hands snaking under each other’s clothes. Oh, oh, as if this cannot get worse, the video cuts to a tastefully captured scene in which his hip is joined with Tony’s buttocks, and cue a lot animalistic grunting and thrusting and –
He pulls over and sits very still, ignoring the way his seatbelt is cutting into his chest. Steve is still fast asleep, which is beyond fantastic – so he slips his hand under his oversized T-shirt and clutches the arc reactor.
“Captain Rogers,” JARVIS begins, “there are two kilograms of C-4 stacked in clusters against a load-bearing wall. Preliminary calculations highly suggest demolition of the western half of the building upon detonation.”
But first, work. The kind of nonsense that Fury can’t wait until Monday to lay on him. “‘Letting the Avengers loose’? No, Nick. We’re not criminals. We answer to the WSC when we need to, but until then, we’re free to live our lives as we see fit. They want us locked down, they have to answer to the ruling institution of this country.”
Too soon. Steve has to shut Clint up with a firm tug on his elbow. “Stark?” he calls out quietly. “Can you hear me?”
He looks away, downward – a brief air of annoyance crossing his face. He’s suddenly kicking at something else, something near the door that Tony can’t quite see. There are
Clint packs his bags that evening, and the Tower belongs to Steve and Tony again. Correction: since Tony has taken up permanent residency in his basement workshop, that leaves all two floors of the Avengers living quarters to Steve. What can one man do with all those space? Steve has even taken to napping in the living room, and catching up on SHIELD paperwork in the kitchen and dining room, hoping to bump into Tony on the off-chance he decides to reload his coffee mug or fix a sandwich.
“He is here,” she begins slowly. “He says he’ll be in touch with you as soon as he can. There’s some… last minute designs he needs to work on. It’s for the Long Island plant, the Chief Engineer has been trying to get it dismissed, says it doesn’t adhere to safety regulations. Tony won’t hear any of it, so he’s… you know…”
Steve fixes himself quickly and they soon board the six thirty shuttle bus. Oddly enough, they pass security checks without hassle. No pat downs, no biometrics – all they have to do is to place their ID face down on a scanner and be granted access to possibly all fifty-something floors of the Triskelion complex.
Steve unfolds his fingers and studies what he just caught – a slim, nondescript metal bracelet that’s cold to the touch. Must’ve been left in the open for some time. “What’s this?”
He leaps to his feet and bounds towards the hangar, of which he has no idea where. He stops and looks around in frantic, and is pretty sure regardless that he should be heading for that circular building, its domelike rooftop already splitting into quarters. And a bullet catches him in his flank. It’s painful enough to bring tears to his eyes. He’s defenceless, a sitting duck for the slaughter.
“Hey,” Tony greets, and joins him. One careless sweep over him and Tony notices blemishes on Steve’s forehead and cheeks. Dirt, maybe. One or two scratches on the side of his neck. His fingers are chaffed. “Are you hurt?” Tony’s hopeful that Steve had the honour of introducing his super-soldier fists to the assassin-wannabe.
There’s still an opportunity. They don’t know what Tony is capable of. With Rumlow’s back turned against him, he gathers the last of his power in his right hand –
“He would’ve found some ways to alert you about it. I know Nick and your father go way back. I don’t deny him having a soft spot for you, Mr Stark. And for that exact reason, Alexander Pierce was elected as Chairperson. A shame really, considering recent events.” He sighs, and continues, “You’re a man of the future.” Ross clasps his hands behind his back, and heads for the far window. “Evolution can’t be stopped. What we are as a species won’t stay the same forever. Changes are already happening as we speak. But at this rate? Tell me, if you were in my seat, what would you do about them?”
“Beautiful morning, isn’t it?” Clint offers Steve a basket of garlic bread. If by beautiful Clint means the bleary sky and streets covered in sleet, sure, why not? “I bet your Facebook wall must be bursting with posts.”
Steve weighs in the state of the Avengers. He either loses the Widow for possibly until year end – Nick Fury doesn’t dick around when he throws blackmails like that – or he loses her
of dreams. Choke full of vivid colours and sounds, people in funny clothes speaking funny languages. The nights had been arduous when left to his own device. There’s so much free time that – Nick said – he could use however he sees fit! This never happened, all right? In those long-gone days, people used to hustle for a lot of things. Food, medicine, money, job… the War. Those concerns haven’t shifted much seventy years later, but life has been genuinely good to him.
“… Then, how is the armour on me?” Steve flexes his fingers again, making sure they’re really obeying his movements. “They’re responding to me.”
Tony can’t believe they drove two days to listen to a madman raving. Suggesting that SHIELD is inherently HYDRA? He doesn’t really root for the home team, but this is ridiculous. “That’s impossible. SHIELD would have stopped you.”
eat for the record, but just enough to sustain his enhanced physiology. The serum has made it so efficient that despite his four-times higher BMR, his intake of expired bread is still about half of Tony’s. Human biology isn’t anywhere near his scope of expertise, but something tells him whatever it is in Tony’s blood, it’s behaving like an inferior version of the super-soldier serum. “No. Eat as much as you need.” Except, Steve has never gone up in flames, and he doesn’t want Tony to try just to prove a point.
And, that’s closure for Tony and Steve both. The final piece to the puzzle that Steve doesn’t think solvable after the Goblin’s death. To barricade himself and thirteen bystanders in an intricate trap that guarantees deaths without ransoms suggests the Goblin’s expectations of
There are two single beds hugging opposing walls. Each comes with a desk and a closet set flanking the bathroom. A bathroom that comes attached to this room? Small mercies, thank the Lord – and Tony pulls his shirt off and tosses it over his shoulder. He could’ve cared less if his stinky shirt lands across Steve’s face, he would murder kittens to have a good, hot shower.
It’s not just them. The anxiety permeates. Rumlow sticks his head into their vicinity again. More Agents begin to crowd the space. The Reaper draws closer. It’s suffocating.
“Hey, I’m all for a clear conscience. I’m not going to steal, I’m going to see what favours or odd jobs I can do for that… lovely shopkeeper over there.” Said shopkeeper has a look of a butcher and a scowl that rivals Iron Man’s. Not one for judging a book by its cover, Steve smiles tightly. “Earn some spare cash, at least enough to reload on gas, food and water. And aspirin. You look like you can use some.”
All evidences pointed to the pink of health. Nothing was wrong save for the pool of biological damnation in his lap.
“… Almost a million. I’m downloading this, then I’m pulling out. They’ll catch me watching if they’re still working on this.”
“I’m asking… for your kindness. I know I’m asking a lot. Maybe too much, and out of place. I owe you… my life, Tony. Everything that I have now, a home, a renewed purpose. I owe it all to you.”
A candle flame wavers over the tip of Tony’s thumb. Its brilliance dances in his irises, and he bursts into laughter. “Oh my God, Steve! I’m like one of those things in your old comic books!”
“So, coming back to this issue,” Pepper pops out the tablet again and places it on the table. “The company is interested in negotiating with SHIELD.”
It’s not even a particularly special date. He kind of missed Mom and Dad’s death anniversary by a couple of months. Can’t bear to visit so soon after all that’d happened. After knowing about the truth behind their accident? Murder. Despite all that, it did shit for his soul. Closure… closure be damned. Tony sighs, troubled, and wonders why he would even bother to drop by and say hey.
Tony lifts it up with only his thumb and index finger like a pincer, and appraises it with aghast. “You want me to go meet Nick in this jumpsuit? It’s a very nice jumpsuit. Fireproof. I can change into a nice Burberry suit in four minutes.”
They drop off Milos at the bus terminal – he insists so, despite Steve offering to drive him home – and even with only the two of them in the wide expanse of the car, Tony stays in the back. Their passive-aggressive ignorance breaks into a worrisome level that Steve sacrifices his ego and checks the rearview mirror. And a chill runs down his spine when he catches Tony’s hazel eyes peering back at him – unwavering,
He doesn’t know what sort of sounds he’s making. There’s tremendous pressure in his chest, and his vocal cord is raw. He smells something charring and coppery around him, and there’s no stopping. His very flesh boils. The table creaks when his back arches, splinters burning immediately into coal.
“We’re here to offer our assistance in fixing those radars,” Steve speaks up, peering at Tony icily before stepping into Fury’s office. “Earth is open to interplanetary threats while security is down. The skies have been quiet for a while, but it’s a chance we should not have to take.”
When Steve hangs up and Tony has precious few seconds thereafter to fully process what he’d just said and done, he groans audibly and collapses butt first into the sofa again. Cradling his head in his palms and chanting
Steve’s knuckles graze his again. “Be more ladylike. Don’t walk with your feet apart. Use smaller steps. Do
stick in the confinement of his pants. But Steve doesn’t want Tony anywhere close to it, and Tony seems more than happy to oblige. He wipes his soiled hands in the rumple of his shirt. “Is there gonna be a next time, Cap, because I’d like to carry tissue paper on my person if so.”
“But, I can get us into Insight. Before he attacked, I was going through SHIELD’s databases and cracking the drive. I’ll be honest, the drive itself wasn’t very interesting. The syntax was foreign to me – which is quite a blow to my ego. But
does him in. He gasps and blinks unwept tears rapidly, his biology spasming with a flight or flight response.
“Any attempt on the director’s life had to look successful,” Maria replies as she rubs a spot between her eyes.
Steve starts pacing the length of Fury’s bed. “The command centre has to be in the Triskelion. Where Alexander Pierce will be, since they’ll need his biometrics for the launch. Where is he scheduled to be at noon tomorrow?”
They’re persistent, Steve gives them that. He’s trained with them, ate with them, worked with them. Persistent SOBs. Was mighty useful when they were still fighting on the same side.
“Not yet,” Steve waves his package right under Tony’s nose, a surreptitious indication that the day is far from over. “Nick needs a dead drop loaded. I just offered our services.”
“Trust is a two-way street, Maria. You are manhandling an ally of SHIELD, and I hate to break it to you, they come in rather short supply these days. Let him go. He’s
in my chest, it’s almost constant nowadays. I’m dying, Steve. Could be the shrapnel finally doing me in. Or the poison. Listen to me – I’m saying, there’s enough blood on my hands. Yours is the
Yet amidst the ashes and fire, there are still babies bawling. Chaotic cries flood in from his left and right. He stops to survey the pile of cars ditched haphazardly on the road. He has a job to do, he does. Crowd control.
Steve stifled a groan.  With a lapful of Tony, he was fully hard.  But as willing and eager as Tony seemed to be, he couldn’t. It wouldn’t be right.  Not when this was all a dream. Or maybe not a dream, but also not real.  “I love you,” he said, instead.
That did sound good.  Steve returned to his room, finding his duffle bag on his bed.  Funny how quickly he thought of it as his bed.  He opened the duffle.  Toothbrush, comb, clothes.  He really didn’t leave the army with much.  And yet, with too much.  He sighed.
He could see the effect of the music stopping.  Mr. Stark looked around, surprised, for another second.  He saw Steve, looked briefly confused, and then seemed to remember who he was.  Not Pepper, that’s for sure.  With a wave of his hand, he collapsed the blueprints and they disappeared.
“Look, Steve,” he says, trying to figure out how to take it back. Steve was Captain America long before that term existed. He’s also more than the shield.  More than the uniform.
“Tony? Are you hurt? I saw a report about an alien energy explosion in New York, are you okay?” He doesn’t sound panicked, not yet.
Howard.  Howard didn’t figure prominently in Steve’s dreams. They’d never been close. Howard was too young, too arrogant, back when they’d known each other, to be a good father. But he had been a genius, that’s for sure.  If this Anthony was an upgrade, he had to be incredible. He started to peruse the file.  A young kid, the same curly hair and big eyes.  On the cover of
Rhodey’s phone beeped at the same time as Tony’s vibrated in his pocket.  “Is it both of us? Read it to me, sugarbeet.”
Scenario two: Tony was being attacked by… something.  Jarvis had excellent security, and would have alerted the rest of the Avengers if something had gotten in, but every once in a while Tony would bring home something dangerous and instruct Jarvis not to rat him out.  Jarvis had to obey, it was in his programming, but sometimes he could find a workaround. That’s how Steve walked in on a miniature elephant trying to stampede Tony three months ago.  Stupid shrinkray.
Coulson patted Tony on the shoulder. “But Tony, you’re going to be an adult soon.  On your own.  You’ll see that things get better.  That sometimes you have to relax. Take a break. Put down all the new shiny tech and look around for a minute, sit on a beach somewhere.” He pulled Tony’s phone out of a desk drawer.  “I can see how much this little speech really convinced you,” he said dryly, taking in Tony’s nervous energy and the way that his eyes seemed to be glued to his phone.  He shook his head, motioning Tony toward the door.
was into him.  It was ludicrous, and arrogant, and humiliating.  Painful, if he wanted to be truthful with himself.  It hurt.  Rejection always did, even if it wasn’t the fault of the other person.
Obie was screaming, clutching his fingers. Natasha moved closer, weapon trained on him, as she kicked the taser and the thug’s gun toward Tony. “Don’t be such a baby,” she said coldly.
It shocks him to realize that Steve’s afraid, too.  That Tony hadn’t pulled his punches, he’d blasted Steve in the chest, decimating that star.  Tony’s not the only one who’s been hurt. And abandoned. Steve thought—no, he knew—that Tony would kill Steve if it meant he could kill Barnes.  And in that moment, he’d been right.  But here he is, bleeding and bleeding to stand next to Tony.
Rhodey side-eyed him hard.  “Uh-huh.  Had to make it weird.  Besides, she’s been hanging pretty close to Steve.”
“Steve!” Nat called after him, but he was already halfway down the stairs, keys in hand.  It should take about forty minutes to get to Manhattan, but he thought he could do it in closer to twenty on the bike.
... That had probably been Tony’s way of implying that he knew about Steve’s crush.  That he was fine with him liking men, but to set his affections elsewhere. Polite. Accepting.  But ultimately an implicit reminder that there were other women and men he should consider instead. One of those fish-in-the-sea things.
“Huh.”  Tony eyed the pizza.  The crust looked crispy, with caramelized bits of tomatoes peeking out from beneath the bubbling cheese.  Pepper was a genius. He turned back to Steve, who seemed to have gotten himself under control. “All right, Brooklyn.  Show me what you got.”
Of course it was. Of course. That was just perfect.  Barnes’s animosity made a lot of sense. Not Tony’s fault, not in the direct way, anyway.
Silver lining.  Tony knew exactly what he could make Steve for his Christmas exchange.  Perfect.  He could make a palette thingy out of that new metal stuff he’d gotten from Mr. Morita.  Kismet.  It was great.  He’d start it just as soon as he figured out how to ask Flying if he was actually a giant douchenozzle on the outside and went around punching little kids.
“And we have chicken fingers in the freezer, don’t we? Or do you think we could do it with tofu instead?” Steve asked.
Steve looks around.  Tries to think of a better solution.  Doesn’t see one.  He starts pulling off his costume in the goddamn hallway.
“Guys, drinks in the kitchen, karaoke in the living room! Daaamn, Pepper, who you gonna use that whip on later?” Sam teased her, shooting finger guns at Natasha and high-fiving Rhodey.
A display of the office appeared on the wall, and he could hear the conversation heard off screen in greater clarity.  Didn’t prove anything, but… He pulled up Google and started running searches. And since when did Tony Stark care about water in developing nations? Algeria? Tunisia? Chad? These countries weren’t even on most Americans’ list of known nations.  What was this all about?
Tony was surprised to find he was hungry.  Well, then.  “Alright, J.  Run a prototype.  Clean  water. Achievable in our time.  And dad wanted to make a flying car.”  He turned to Steve.  “Lead on.”
Steve suppressed the urge to roll his eyes.  Well, score one more for Mr. Stark, then.  But still, he had a job to do.  An $850,000 job.
Tony went to the workshop and set the metal disc in the fabricator.  He’d tinker for a little.  Get things ready.  He hit play on one of his playlists and started uploading the design, shaking his hips in time to the bass.
She turned back in her seat and started jotting down notes in her phone about legal codes and forms.  Tony’d seen a few of them before.  She was starting on separating assets already.  Jesus.  Who was this girl?
When did I first know?  I feel like I’ve always known.  Ever since I knew what attraction was, I knew I wasn’t attracted to women. Not in that way.  Well… When I was in middle school, I spent a long stretch of time in the hospital. Not a big deal, and I’ve grown out of it.  But the television in the hospital kept playing this terrible television show the entire time. Maybe it was a marathon of some sort.
Tony turned around, shifting nervously.  “So, you slept with Loki, huh?” he teased. “Even I haven’t slept with an Asgardian.”
Tony grinned.  Steve always remembered to order that for him, even though no one else touched the stuff.
“Tony?” Steve bit his lip.  “I’m sorry.  I know.” He looked away, over the river. His eyes were brilliant somehow, reflecting the moonlight mirrored in the river. “I know.  I’ll just.  But I didn’t want you to be here, waiting, thinking that I didn’t love you, too.  Because I do. Because you’re amazing--you are, you know? You’re amazing.” He rubbed his hand sheepishly on his thigh, looked down as if the ground had answers.  “And. And when you find someone you really want, he’s going to be so goddamn lucky.” He smiled at Tony, though it looked wrong on him, somehow.  Not a real smile. Not a Steve smile.  He took a step backward.  “Um.  Be careful getting home. Do you want me to call someone for you? Jim, or Pepper?” Steve turned, clearly uncertain if he should leave Tony alone in Central Park at midnight, but not wanting to overstep his bounds.
Tony shut down his snooping with a quick word to Jarvis to keep him updated and hurried down to the basement. Barnes had been looking in the wrong filing cabinet.
“Thanks, Rogers,” Tony said, mildly. He wouldn’t drop the question, but he’d just ask Rhodey about it afterward. “This is Jim Rhodes.  Rhodey, this is Steve Rogers.”
“What’s up with you, man?” Sam asked, afterward, panting. “You normally don’t put me through my paces like that. Something bothering you or did you just decide I must have been skimping on leg day?”
“Loki,” Steve agreed, trying to laugh along, but it felt like there wasn’t enough air in his lungs for that.
He took a shower, unsure if it would be weird if he didn’t close the bathroom door.  It was in his own suite, off his bedroom, so he didn’t usually.  Or maybe it would be weird, then, if he did? After all, kittens weren’t people.  It was just sitting on his bed, playing with one of Natasha’s hairties.  There was no reason to feel self-conscious.  Steve finally sighed, knowing he was overthinking the issue, and closed the bathroom door.
Batroc reappeared, sitting down heavily and clunking his mobile onto the desk by a set of three Montblanc pens.  “I’m so sorry, Mr. Rogers. I’m afraid that the accords won’t be able to be signed for at least another three weeks.  But we are working as fast as we can.  It’s just, everything is all rushing with you Americans.” He sighed. “I’ll update you when I can.”
“Yep, and this genius needs his sleep.  Today was exhausting.  I hope whatever bit them wears off as they sleep.” Tony didn’t mean to sound bitter, but he couldn’t help it.  He was a genius, after all, and he could put it all together.  They all had some sort of momentary infatuation with him.  Everyone except Steve.  Which was great, it was, really, except that the only person he wanted to be hopelessly besotted with him was the sweet idiot standing in front of him. The only one whose demeanor hadn’t changed at all.
Well.  At least he didn’t seem to be having any effects from that powder.  Maybe he had just metabolized it faster than the others, but he didn’t feel any different at all.
Tony resisted the urge to bang his head on the steering wheel again. “It’s so not fair to you, though. What if you want to date someone? Not to mention you’d have to be in Hammer’s presence again and the slimebucket gives me the creeps just by existing!”
The minute Tony’s arms closed around Steve’s ribs, he felt all the tension deflate from him, that same shudder running through him. His hand came up to close over Tony’s. Tony kissed his back.  “Steve.  Why didn’t you say something?”
Steve could have cried.  He wanted.  God, he wanted, and it was the one time, the only time, that he was ever going to be able to make love with Tony, he wanted so much he couldn’t breathe with it.  But he couldn’t.  “I do, so much, I love you so much. I just. Can I just hold you tonight?”
By noon, his bladder was calling.  Tony got up, refreshing email automatically on his way to the bathroom.  Nothing.  There was no way Flying didn’t see the story—if not on ShieldSpies, then on CNN, Fox, local news… He’d at least have checked his email by now.  He checked his email at least three times a day, not that Tony was counting—he just noticed things.
The next morning, still nothing.  He picked up Pepper, Rhodey, and then Natasha, listening as Pepper talked about her new budget reports for prom, and Rhodey reminding her that the dance was still over six months away.  Natasha agreed with Pepper, though, having a good mind for budgets.
“Doesn’t matter, stop interrupting me, you ever been engaged? No? Then shut up, you wouldn’t know. My point is, I am an expert in love and relationships, and I am telling you, Stark is 100% in lust
Stark had been staring at his hand but he looked up at that. His face was still blank, and Steve still couldn’t see his eyes.  “Huh.”
After the competition, which they lost by three points when Hammer grabbed the remote control from Bruce and navigated the robot squarely into a wall (Natasha didn't even
Steve paused for a second, noticing the movement, then continued, praising where Natasha had taken out the witch’s rabid wolf friend without drawing any attention. She winked at Tony. Maybe it had been her? If so, she had very large feet for a woman, which he felt like he would have noticed.
Steve had had enough.  “Mr. Stark was not out partying with mobsters, Miss.  He was home, working on renewable energy,” he said, sharply, “and certainly not in
Steve stared at the screen blankly, picturing a cliff, picturing snow.  How do I live with that? He’d tried not to, when it came down to it.  The best laid plans.  He could still taste the shitty whiskey he’d found at the bar.  Peggy. Always competent. Always focused. It hadn’t really helped him.  It had been over since that day anyway.  But it couldn’t hurt to pass along advice.
“Mentoring is kind of a strong word for it.  Trying to stop him from getting himself killed is all. He’s a little ambitious maybe. Headstrong. Doesn’t know his limits.  Remind you of anyone?”
Folding his slice, he took a bite.  Ok, Steve was maybe not kidding.  This was actually delicious. And from an oven in his kitchen? Amazing.  He realized Steve was still standing in the kitchen.  “Sit, Rogers.  Have pizza.  You’re allowed to have pizza. You have to eat, you know.”
The day the whole team was hit by the spellpowder, Tony had already been ranting about how much he hated magic. Magic was the worst. It defied all boundaries of rationality, of proof, of science.  Ever since he’d met Loki, he swore he’d rather fight a thousand mad scientists with a thirst for his blood than tangle with another magician, sorceress, or warlock.  You just couldn’t tell what would happen.
“Um, thanks, buddy,” Tony said.  “Don’t you think some hipsters are going to miss their gardening project? It’ll probably interrupt their organic salads if we take this.”
Tony just continued to stare.  But Lorraine. “No. It isn’t,” he blurted out. He’d written Steve off as impossible so long ago it didn’t add up.
He held Tony’s hand, watched the sunline creep over him, like in the painting, illuminating his skin, anointing him. He watched it edge closer to his own hand, unhurried, a nightmare.  The moment the sun warmed his skin, he couldn’t help it.  He closed his eyes.  The world stopped, narrowed to only the feeling of Tony’s hand in his, the warmth of the sun conquering his skin, until he knew he was lying entirely in the light, the day fully on him, flaying him, leaving him exposed and defenseless.  He had no idea how long it had been.  Only that it was over.  And Steve was lost.  He didn’t know how to go on.  But Tony would be expecting some sort of answer, and he had to open his eyes, had to face it head on.  Had to take the consequences Njorun warned him would come.  At least, they’d only hurt him.  She’d promised.
“Well.  I have some things to finish up.  Tony.  Sir.” Steve didn’t exactly hurry on his way out, but he wasn’t taking his time, either. He disappeared rather quickly up the stairs.
Tony drew back, looking at him closely. Steve felt laid bare, for a second. “Is that your way of telling me to get back to work?” Tony grinned, then kissed him again and clambered off, sauntering back to his work station swaying his hips. He winked, then started back on the arrows.
She threw her arms around him, squishing the bagels.  Rhodey hugged him, too. “It’s been a weird couple of days, Tones,” he said. “Weirder not having you around though.  Don’t go disappearing on us again, okay?”
Pepper had walked over to the other man, still lying on the floor.  She looked for blood, but there didn’t seem to be any.  Eventually she poked at his cheek with the point of her shoe.  “What about this one?”
Steve thought about it. He’d woken up and battled Loki, hadn’t stopped fighting since.  Before the ice… He’d been in basic training until he’d been made a USO exhibit, and from there he’d led the Commandos.
He kept close to Tony all evening, subtly keeping Tony’s drinks switched out.  Every time someone handed Tony a martini, he picked up a decoy Evian from Sam. When there was a toast called out, Wilson had already set aside a glass of sparkling apple juice.  He’d told the former airman that, as a PA, it was important that he always had a drink in hand, to blend, he’d said, and he wanted to match whatever Mr. Stark had, to impress his new employer.  But that he didn’t like to drink on the job. Sam had nodded understandingly, happy to help Steve out.  They’d run a rough mission, Steve’s ducklings being called in to prevent civilian casualties on the Khalid Kandhil extraction and cover Wilson on his way out.  Sam felt like he owed him one, although Steve didn’t see it that way.  It had been a bad mission all around, Kandhil taking out one of the airmen.
“Great! You’re fine and dandy and all that, Cap, but you and I just aren’t meant to be. Now, hurry along. I have some six-million potential customers to appease.”
Tony turns sideway so his lips brush against Steve’s. That’s enough permission. He swears Rumlow just poked his head in again and accidentally witnessed his Commander locking lips with another man. The burn in his skull is real. He trusts Rumlow not to Instagram this, but what a sight it must be.
to rationalise reducing the frugal amount of money tentatively being offered. Profit turnover, labour costs and litigation fees are expensive considerations, and don’t get him started about all the variables when dealing with biological systems.
They’re rocking the fucking table, and it’s banging ceaselessly against the wall. What is his neighbour going to
He shrinks deeper into the alcove between the generator and a shelf, and stares at the man in terror as he stoops to push through the hole he’s made in the door. He straightens up, and coldly surveys his target. Tony is close to hyperventilating and pissing his pants, as the man raises his other hand. Only for Tony, he has another gun – larger, odder in shape – and he takes his aim, right at Tony’s heart.
He hops into his car and heads to this warehouse Stark Industries has in DC. There are still people working at the front despite the late hours, forklifts manning the crates. He gives the workers two short honks, winds down the window to stick his hand out and waves, and promptly parks his car behind the block.
Just let him be, send an ambulance down his way and he’ll be right as rain. The medic will deal with this… this jet of blood he just projectile vomited when he coughs. The stabbing in his lungs won’t subside.
Tony has fallen asleep sometime after they passed Baltimore. Steve turns off the radio, and raises the indoor temperature. The jumpsuit doesn’t offer much protection against the elements.
Steve’s eyes – grey and haunted – shoot open and he gasps like his lungs stopped working, jolting upright from his fully reclined seat. Tony keeps banging on the door, and tries the handle in his desperation to
Tony waves, and the man is soon on his merry way to Subway next door. Steve leads them to the elevators, occasionally nodding and greeting at passing men and women with a friendly, “Agent.”
Only, Steve is as limp as a half-filled water balloon. Maybe a quarter-way rigid after a couple of squeezing, and Tony quickly removes his encroaching hands from Steve’s crotch – already conveniently placed in his face. That’s when it hits him, both the force of his imminent ejaculation, and the deed he’s done. The deadweight in his stomach doesn’t ease up when Steve excuses himself from the room right after – the first time he’s ever left Tony to a vacant space at the end of a session.
Oh? This is what it’s about? Naughty, naughty, Anna Smith. So, Tony toasts his drink in mocked acknowledgement, and keeps his trap shut. His squeaky Teletubby voice will only do him a disservice.
as Steve stops and spits his cock out of a bruised mouth. Still holding his gaze, Tony loses himself in the blueness of Steve’s eyes as more clothes join the pool on the floor. Steve’s. Bare from the waist-down, Steve swipes excess saliva and precum coating the length of Tony’s cock and slaps them over his own. That can’t be too hygienic – Tony still has
“I have his blood on my hands, Tony.” As he utters those words, his throat constricts and he digs the heel of his palm into his eyes. “It’s been seventy years, but I remember it as though it was yesterday. He was dangling off the side of the train, and I was there. I was… so close. I know if he were here, he would say, there was nothing I could’ve done. And it was
giving up, and just like that, despite a flickering HUD and cracking shell of his Iron Man suit, his surmounting fear… vanishes.
With her unwavering stare, she peels back his soul, layer by layer until he gives up evading and she drops the one question that really matters. “What are you not telling me?”
His vision swerves in and out. The fluorescent tubes are but a smudge of white, before they sharpen so acutely he sees the very screws bolting them to the ceiling itself. The black of sky is unending, and then, stars as clear as Christmas bobbles light up the Milky Way.
Steve said, but there’s something in the way those words were gritted out that’s so foreboding, Tony thinks its wiser to play the fool and come disarmingly in peace.
“Sir, a three-tonne support beam is breaking off from the hull. Trajectory projection indicates a straight dive into the National Mall. Civilians evacuation is still in progress.”
The quiet and Tony Stark's sole company warms him up. He turns and catches Tony’s wrist with his lips, and trails kisses along the bare flesh with care. Tony stops his ministrations with an equally gentle grip on his jaws, and coaxes him to look up. Look Tony in his eyes, and notice the burden he too carries. More tears leak out of Steve’s, and Tony thumbs them away. He can’t possibly ask Tony for forgiveness. But, he can let Tony in, if only to ground himself to the fact that Bucky Barnes still walks this earth! Selfish? The words when spoken solidify the fact. He needs to… to convince himself that this –
Fuck it all to hell, yeah? Steve doesn’t know how far he’s willing to go with the Extremis. He can set this room on fire. Explode. He can char the brains out of Steve’s skull. All of those with an express thought. And before he knows it, there is wetness dripping off the tip of his nose, and he backpedals a safe distance away from Steve, eyes rabid as Steve slowly eases off the closet.
Steve doesn’t look impressed at all when Tony dangles Nescafe in his face. “Return that, and get us water! How are we making coffee when we don’t have water in the first place?”
“It’s not.” Putting words in his mouth, classy. Steve sighs wearily, and points at the unoccupied cubicle two door down from Clint’s. “I’m saying, you asked for a reward, and I’m giving it. With one condition. Get in there.”
Another day, another battle. For now? Tony takes a deep, steadying breath. “You just woke up. I just regained my appetite! I’ve this stupid hankering for a cheeseburger. I can sneak one into the ward for you. Think the nurse out front won’t mind.”
Tony doesn’t think even Steve can stand up to an Iron Man suit, and Steve has the super-soldier serum coursing his veins. Metal arms are cool, but for
“Shit…” Steve’s fingers grapple uselessly at the handle when the door is flung opened, a pasty, plump man in his mid-thirties blocking the way.
Straightening up, he clears his throat and walks past Steve into his assigned quarter. “You’re in my room. Where’s yours?”
“… Did you, by any chance, went for plastic surgery, or…” Steve reaches out to run his hand over Tony’s torso. “Procedures? To remove your scars?”
“… Sure you all do.” Tony clears his throat some more, and pulls his cup of coffee to his lips. “So, going back to school, huh? Which one? What programme?”
– the view of those jeans-clad legs spread apart before him has never been so inviting. Steve quickly pulls his sandal free from his right foot, and pads along the inner areas of Tony’s leg –  the chiselled bumps of his calf, the firm expanse of his thigh. A shiver courses the length of the limb as Steve creeps higher and higher.
Then Tony very successfully takes his mind off Bucky with his far-fetched plan about hijacking a TV van and its antenna. Something about needing the extra firepower. Why specifically a TV van – because that vehicle is so commonplace – instead of say, borrowing a computer on display in the mall Steve will never find out, because Tony rambles on, going into specifics. Tony’s droning soon loses its magic. Bucky’s face is still front and centre on the tablet, and Steve is cradling it.
.” The exhaust must’ve been linked to the reactor core where power is generated. So, Tony lets go, and his body is thrown backward with the force of his attack.
– Tony’s resolve solidifies. But, he doesn’t ready his fist. He swims, and Barnes trudges into the bushes.
“I swear, if you get in my way, I’ll run through you.” He presses into Steve, his body melding with Steve’s form. The complement is faultless, and his arousal rises to the occasion. His forbidden desires are intoxicating, and Steve must have known it, too. His breathing quickens as he backs into the closet, but Tony is relentless. He keeps Steve prisoned. “I will, Steve.”
between us, you understand?” Tony hooks his free arm under Barnes’, and he pulls and lugs until Barnes is firmly settled against his side.
"He then said, 'Why not a pilot without a plane?' You're telling me this is the same man who threw his alarm clock out the window and sent an empty suit to the battlefield?"
“You can only imagine what it’s like being in this industry. Much worse has been… presumed of me. A common misunderstanding. I’ve learned not to take things too personally.”
prepared for him all right, so Tony grabs the pile of towels arranged beside his pillow. “Just the towels, Steve.”
They walk to the mahogany table that was once Tony’s for over a decade. He caresses the polished edge with his knuckle and promptly sits in the guest chair facing the executive’s. Boy, what a vista. Can’t believe he spent all those years working with his back
When Steve’s on a straight stretch of road – like this one – he’ll turn to run a palm up and down the length of Tony’s arm, if only to reassure himself that the body beside him is still warm and alive.
He kneels beside the port where the arc reactor is supposed to go. There’s no spare reactor lying around of course – maybe one or two cassettes of palladium but point is, he doesn’t stockpile on arc reactors. He blames his paranoia of evil people taking advantage of his tech. Paranoia that has
He finds purchase on large chunks of debris and rests his entire weight on them. They don’t give – structural support is good. “Tony, come on,” he hisses with urgency. Who knows if SHIELD’s coming back to comb this area. SHIELD’s not taking chances, and neither should they. He searches the ground where he had Tony pinned under him during the blast, and –
Tony slams the trunk down that the car itself bounces on its suspension. “I feel like I want to poke these people in the eye for ruining my best week of the month. You just got back from an assignment, I was gonna take you out on a test drive with Mark 42. Now Insight is picking us off one at a time, maybe SHIELD is evil, Mark 42 is scraps, and I’m presumed dead. My life is a sitcom, that’s what.”
He’s got to be blind to have missed the beam. He straightens his arms and jets towards it. “Those people won’t make it. We have to clear a path. How many more I should be worried about?”
A metallic grey – through and through, so Mark XIII? – freefalls behind him, and its latches work to admit his body into the suit’s belly. It’s not over – not until the system goes online upon recognition of his biometrics and honest to God, if JARVIS asks once more for his favourite colour he
The elevator pings and he steps out of it first, Pepper hot on his heels. “A contract with SHIELD is not like with the military.”
“You must understand, Steve. When I go out in that suit, I’m not just one guy. I’m the collective intellect of all the supercomputers combined, because I
And then, and then, and then, Monday happens. Pepper is so looking forward to receiving them that she’s gone ahead and arranged for the company’s jet to pick them up sharp at eight in the morning. She was going to plan a luncheon with those folks in Long Island to welcome Tony’s homecoming, and that’s where he draws the line because, “It’s still your show, Pepper. You’re still CEO.” He may not be dying anytime soon, but he’s serious about passing the torch to her. Nevertheless, like he said, he won’t say no to CTO, and knowing Pepper, it’s an arrangement that’s probably already in the pipeline.
on the incense. Tony takes his clothes off and puts on the disposable pants arranged neatly atop a stack of towels, and waits. Which fortunately doesn’t take long because time is another thing he’s hard-strapped for, and holy shit –
A grimy pickup truck eventually emerges from the horizon, and he patiently waits for it to rumble to a halt. The driver kills the engines. A door opens and gravels crunch under his bare foot. That’s dangerous, isn’t it – this
“We just knocked his wife out cold in the wee morning, stowed her in some bush and I just lied to his face. I hope they get their meatballs to go because the Smiths are spending the next couple of days in Anna’s observatory ward. What are we doing, Steve?”
The problem with funerals and graves and dead people in the movies is that it always seems to rain when they happen. Clichéd as they may be, perhaps he hasn’t sampled enough scenes. Or maybe there’s a nugget of truth in that. He gets that it’s New York. In February. He misses the West Coast already. So why not go back? Tethered to New effing York by work and duties and honour and what have you is why, dammit. Which explains why Tony Stark is rooted to the muddy ground grasping a plain, black umbrella as raindrops tap dance above his head on a bleak Monday morning, his recently-unfrozen billionaire butt clothed in plainclothes as cheery as the day.
Tony’s thinking on the line of evacuating as many of these people – but that can’t work, can it, because there’s no magical place on this planet that can withstand the brunt of those Helicarriers’ guns. The next best thing would be to
Tony’s mind is still stuck at the ringing syllable of “shot” when Steve presses on, “We don’t know if he’s going to make it through the night.”
it that way,” the anger barely contained in his hisses. There’s just them in the car, what is he ashamed of?
Tony fixed two out of three cars by three o’clock. The challenge isn’t performing under pressure, but add Steve into the mix… he’s shredding through his supply of screws because memories of Steve gurgling in his sleep won’t go away. He tosses his spanner into the toolbox, frustrated and anxious, and walks to Mr Tough Guy, fully prepared to leave with nothing but a black eye.
“No! OK, you know what? If you find anything weird, you’re free to report it to your superiors. Hill, Fury, up to you. Please,” Tony begs, “this is important.”
in front of Stark Tower since the hearing goes online. People camped on the curb holding placards, trying to catch a sight of Iron Man. They don’t know he’s all holed up in Sibley Memorial Hospital and has no intention whatsoever to rematerialize out there, not when the crazies are everywhere. Which explains his docility, right? Zero complaints since the day he checked into a ward.
New York skyline. And Pepper must have settled in nicely in her CEO position, just look at how she’s personalised the workspace!
Then Steve meets Tony’s gaze evenly, and wonders how well Tony would take it. He hasn’t broken the news to the others, but he can roughly guess who will be in the no-way-camp or the OK-camp. But, with Tony?
The only sign that Barnes is aware of Tony’s presence is his stiffening shoulders. He’s shaking from the cold, and water rolls off the tip of his nose and chin. He might’ve been crying, if Tony wants to believe that. Barnes’ dull glare on the patch of grass does nothing to ease what’s roiling in Tony’s chest.
sake, Tony hopes he’s made of metal elsewhere, too, because he’s not slipping kids glove over Mark 42’s repulsor-charged gauntlets.
Steve continues drilling him into the bed. Tony can’t hurt – his body won’t let him. “You’re a closet masochist.”
Clint bolts. Steve wants to bolt, too. The pressure on his nose eases and Tony steps away from the door. His demeanour changes completely – God, Clint was right, Tony’s completely red in the face, the culmination of shower steam and vigour of their recent… activities. And Tony just stares at Steve, expressionless, on and on like he has questions queuing up but doesn’t know which to ask first.
It’s all Tony can do to wheeze pitifully, waiting for the ultimate strike. Another hand – flesh and blood – that’s familiarly ruthless creeps under his shirt. Fingernails scrape against the valleys of his abdominal packs, but up and up the hand goes until its thumb scrapes against the housing of his arc reactor. Without slightest gust of a warning the assassin
“What’s the deal with the fire? Last time we checked, he’s a promiscuous businessman with a knack for tinkering, and I’ll stop here because I’m being polite.”
Barnes’ body lists sideway a fraction, and a sudden glint of metallic sets Tony off to hyperaware mode. He blasts Barnes with a non-fatal supersonic wave – the same party trick Obadiah Stane used on him long, long time ago. Fun stuff. The effect is instantaneous, just the way Tony remembers it first-hand. Barnes drops unceremoniously to the ground, mud spattering on his pale, damp cheeks. He’s still very much alive and conscious, but all manners of movement locked within the casket of his body. Just to be sure, Tony prods him carefully with his toes, and decides that even enhanced individuals are susceptible. He reaches around Barnes’ back to retrieve what looks like a 9-mm pistol held in place by his waistband.
Steve cocks an eyebrow, comprehension dawns on him like a tonne of brick. “This is a bit extreme, don’t you think?”
Tony does not comment, but asks to exit the highway and do a pitstop at a gas station. They find one quickly around a junction.
been a while since he last saw her. Last time, things were going boom all around and there were problems, they rhyme with “Vanko”. “Are you OK?”
If that HYDRA SOB has somehow activated Insight before the designated hour, then a hard reboot on Insight’s system ought to do the trick. Steve is heading for the hangar. He should, too. He should… be ripping out wires and taking apart engines –
“I’ll uh, call for housekeeping later.” That corner Clint is standing at looks more like patches of the Sahara than a gym. At this rate, funding the Avengers will completely bankrupt Tony. Just give them a couple of months. “I’m heading off to the showers. Catch you guys later?”
Steve puts on his down jacket and skips into the wintry morning. Things get odder from hereon. People in modern New York tend to keep to themselves on a bright, summer evening and become even more subdued towards year-end but
Tony doesn’t remember if he asked for the egg mayonnaise or chicken sandwich to go with his coffee, and he certainly doesn’t recall how he ordered said coffee, which never happens. He
“No piezo in the radius of fifteen yard. Could be the Goblin. Could be a hostage. Shall I engage – oh, boy.”
that immunotherapy is the cure for “Big C”. Turning on one’s immune system as the ultimate defence against aberrant cells is genius. No graft rejection, no delayed effects. He’s talking up to eighty percent of clinical remission and improved survival in rodents. Not saying it’s doing terribly bad in the humans, by the way. Emily Whiteheads was seven and critically ill with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia when she received the world’s first T-cell therapy in 2012. Three weeks later, the doctors couldn’t detect cancer cells in her marrow and peripheral circulation. Five years on, she still has her modified, super-soldier T-cells coursing her veins. Fantastic news all around, indicated by the pop of champagne corks planetwide.
Tony washes his face and towels his chin dry. “Interesting. Let me guess, you’re not pissed off because some lady isn’t obeying your instructions. I’m gonna go one step ahead and assume she’s doing that on someone
“First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive! In 1972, I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body. My mind, however – that was worth two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing in my brain.”
But life is equal part comedy and tragedy, and the rug is pulled from under their feet when rival company Juno Therapeutics announced five deaths in their ROCKET clinical trial for the same T-cell therapy. Five deaths from cerebral oedema is all it takes for them to scrap the programme altogether. It’s not fun for Juno. Company stock price nosedives. People’s faith in an actual cure for cancer has never been so thoroughly shaken.
Mr Tough Guy promises him a carton of instant noodles, more bread – just lovely – water and cereal drinks,
He clears half the foyer without event. He ducks low behind an oaken display shelf, and checks the main entrance behind him. No signs of overt break-ins – no broken windows, doors still attached to their hinges. Things are still where he last left them. The blackout in the garage is more extensive than anticipated. Clearly it affects a significant area of the mansion – he can’t see clearly past the archway that connects this foyer to the sitting room. But, there’s still light streaming in from the gardens. Small mercies. He strains his ears for signs of the intruder, and counts to five.
“And you’re blameless? You walked into unchartered territory, severely undermanned and failed to consider the possibility of a second base of operation. This mission would’ve failed if it weren’t for my, dare I say, timely intervention and foresight –”
“Sure,” Tony grits out. “You forgot tech visionary and philanthropist.” That earns him another forceful shove against the truck, and Steve has had enough. He stills the unruly agent by his shoulder, and six crosshairs instantaneously appear over his torso.
Sighing dramatically, Tony puts his helmet down and lifts the hem of his oversized shirt. The bluish glow of his arc reactor casts shadows around them. “I’m the best-looking floor lamp this side of America.”
He deeply regrets what comes next – doing the sensible thing and talking sense to Tony, teammate to teammate, man to man.
“The circuitries in this headband connect directly with the user’s hippocampus. It’s meant to access certain… traumatic memory – no, listen! – for alteration and projection of said memory onto an external infrastructure, in this case, a video editing software while simultaneously projecting said uh, graphics, onto a screen like this one. I save all my videos on my private server, in Malibu – guarded by my biometrics and Pepper’s, just in case – for future processing. The point of this technology is to allow users to re-experience said… traumatic experience, and learn to work towards overcoming it. It’s a sixteen-billion-dollar worth of therapy.”
So, Steve taps him lightly on the shoulder, and points at the table. “An Apple keyboard and a USB drive port, Tony. Still too ancient?”
And then, Steve’s hand cups him gently by his jaw, and a thumb ghosts along the edge of his somewhat unkempt beard. “Come here,” Steve whispers, and Tony freely obeys. There’s teeth, lots of teeth – because they’re both grinning like idiots as their lips keep missing each other, but they just kept going. Tony runs his hand through Steve’s hair and finds it grainy, and the back of Steve’s neck is sticky with dried sweat. If he’s lucky. With Steve, “sticky” can mean anything from semen to alien blood.
“Each suit carries a sole copy of decades’ worth of your work, Sir. We have lost Project Tomorrow and Manhattan. The crude blueprints of Arsenal are stored in the suit you have just reprogrammed to explode upon contact with the northeast hull of the third Helicarrier. I remind you –”
Nothing Steve can dispute. Tony is right. He’s a liability when his powers behave unpredictably and easily tampered by emotions. Things can go wrong in more ways than they can ever be right.
Tony gets up from his chair so quickly he almost upsets it. “Mark 17? ‘Heartbreaker’. Artillery Level RT Suit
“Very. But!” Even his back straightens up. “SHIELD isn’t going to expect this. Crawlers typically take months to do their job. Their cyber guard dogs will be looking for malicious ware, not this. Let me do this. It’s
Tony nearly misses Steve's barely-there whisper. “Nick showed up at my place, all torn up. He said, don’t trust anyone.” He almost freaks out when Steve’s forehead come to rest on his shoulder. “Eyes and ears everywhere.” Steve’s so close Tony catches a faint whiff of copper and sweat. “
the cure is beyond horrifying. They might be up against an enemy with no compunction for sociopathic approaches if that means getting the job done. An enemy who has no fear, who is not held back by standards – nigh unstoppable.
Steve takes hold of his shield in the nick of time when a metal arm punches through the driver’s window, fingers curling futilely against the smooth, cool surface of the vibranium disc.
And the crafty Steve interjects, “Metal sensors won’t work on him. Allow me.” He ignores Tony’s reproachful glare, and beckons him to assume the same open, vulnerable position to aid inspection.
“I’ll make sure he behaves.” Convincing Maria to let Tony attend is the easy part, believe it or not. Convincing
“Hi,” Tony begins, wincing as the crown of his skull pulses. “Don’t think we’ve met. What’s your name?”
A bullet ricochet off metal bits. In the last vestiges of clarity, Steve pulls his hoodie up and arches his back, digging his cock all the way into the fiery depth of Tony’s throat. He needs to go – doesn’t care if Tony’s gagging on his dick, he asked for it – Steve fucks his mouth in earnest. Tony splutters, drool running down his chin and Steve feels his throat seizing up.
The eyes on the Iron Man helmet suddenly shine brilliantly white. Steve almost drops it when JARVIS says, “Sir, incoming short range ballistic in thirty seconds.”
Tony coughs suddenly, his cheeks flushed with heat. His collar is damp with sweat, and Steve hears the friction of air passing through his airways. “So hot,” he whines, and reaches into their cardboard box of supplies for another bottle of water.
Steve’s hand slips under it, and he flattens his hand over the dips and curves of Tony’s toned abdomen. There is strength and flaming passion – a man of iron will and heart, Steve respects Iron Man for that – as is vulnerability, and mortality. His hand dips lower to fiddle with the curls of dark pubic hair, and Tony lets out a whine, his pacing stuttering.
Tony hums and takes a particularly huge bite off his sandwich. It’s not difficult to read in between the lines, and pray tell why would clients mistake Steve for something else – sarcasm fully implied. Perhaps keeping his fucking hands to himself would help stay away the scandalous assumptions. And right on cue, Tony’s dick does a little stir, so he shoves the last of his sandwich into his mouth.
Tony raises his hand, and her lips tremble with suppressed fury. “Pepper, enough. General.” Out of the frying pan, and into the fire. “Surely you don’t mean to come all the way from New York to tell us how genetically special we are.”
He can only meekly tense his muscles where the syringe pierces the underside of his forearm. He might just break the needle.
Obviously pleased with himself, he smirks, “What is it with you, Rogers? You like pissing me off that much?”
Tony drains his own cup of ramen and beckons for Steve’s empty one. “You think SHIELD is using the Mandarin as a test run for Insight?”
“Nonsense.” Tony turns the tablet around to look at it again. Steve doesn’t need it anyway. He recognises it anywhere. “You know him? I know everybody you hang out with, Steve.”
He doesn’t always get sentimental, but being on the run, living in shambles kind of jogs back memories.
Regardless, it’s not like SHIELD could advertise a super-soldier slash World War II veteran vacancy and expect a queue of replacement candidates by Monday. So, Steve agrees to stick around until someone suitable crops up. Big shoes to fill, no doubt. He can work for
He shoots back up to the second ship adjacent and gives it his best. As he reclaims his place in the line of spitting exhausts, stabilises flight amidst vortices as sweltering as three thousand and two hundred Centigrade, Tony sees now – as clear as ever – the price tag slapped on freedom. It’s hellfire and brimstone and heart-stilling fear for failure. His stabiliser is overworked, and the heat seeps through gold titanium alloy that Tony gnashes his teeth so hard because he
Four thirty sharp, Tony emerges fresh from the shower and strolls into Steve’s designated room. Steve is already waiting, the bed prepared and the lights dimmed. There’s no expectation, no signs, no preambles, and Tony’s got his game face on. He’s the man, the alpha, and no amount of teases and sexual gratification will shake him up and his identity. He lies on his back with his legs parted from the get-go, his cock already at full mass in his pants.
“Remember Zola’s presentation? There’s always more from where that comes from. I’ll get us the evidence. We Snowden the crap out of SHIELD.”
of Tony’s fist being the only music to his ears. His own erection abandoned, Steve has half the heart to resume driving manually, if only to take his mind of –
Steve reaches around his neck and undoes his dog tags. His few mementos from the bygone. His anchor to the living and dead. A reminder of why he’s still fighting, seventy years after the War, and what hope feels like.
He scoots a safe distance away from Steve until it seems platonic enough to the public. The crunch under his butt tells him that Steve’s snuck something else inside his pocket during the heat of things. How clandestine.
Naturally, Tony does a show of chugging more spit like his life depends on it, because that can’t be what Captain America just asked of him, right?
And off he scuttles to the trunk to retrieve the first aid kit. He skids to a halt next to Steve and drops it on the dusty ground. With hands so shaky, he pries the lid open so forcefully that gauzes and antiseptic belches from the box. “Sorry, I didn’t mean this to happen…” Steve’s healing rates pale in comparison to Tony’s. It’s not instantaneous. Though the worst of the burns had passed, the blisters remain.
“Really?” An operation this important and Tony Stark is whining about looking like a chick for one morning. Very mature. “Fine. Give me that. Set the bodies up.”
“I saw them myself. Three next generation Helicarriers synched to a network of targeting satellites. Guess where they were launched from?”
His free hand gropes about Tony’s front, over the cotton shirt he wears to his sleep. It too carries a whiff of vodka and overnight sweat. It drives Steve insane, and he needs to… needs this heat in his core to dissipate. It’s hardly pleasurable though he’s harder than ever – Tony is back to pumping their shafts in long, measured strokes – and he needs to…
Stay and die, or hide and die. “Seven minutes to go. I’m staying, Steve. I need to see this through with my own eyeballs. Are you in position?” Seven minutes to giving the world the dirt on HYDRA.
The hair on his neck stands on end when Steve stops folding his towels. His ego and downstairs brain hazard a guess and say his proud erection has commanded Steve’s attention. He quickly slips into the flimsy paper pants on when Steve’s chair scrapes against the floor.
He doubles back to the impressive crater where the suit impacted and drags the hunk of metal to the bodock tree again. A thick shrubbery surrounds it, and the grass about them have a nice, healthy glow of chlorophyll to them. Not much traffic, he deduces. He stows the courageous Mark 35 between branches and twigs and God, this is… he has hit the lowest point of his year.
“If I don’t make it back, it’s not an opponent you can handle without the suit. This isn’t up for debate, Stark. I’m not risking your safety needlessly.” He closes the door behind him and peers through the crack of the window. “Watch the clock. Stay here.”
“Sure you do. And that is why, Miss Potts, you make a better CEO than I ever will be.” Suddenly, the very air in his lungs feels so much sweeter. “I owe you one, Pep. Thank you. For believing in me.”
“I mean, permanently, Tony.” Which stops Tony dead in his track. “I’m resigning from the Avengers, effective tomorrow.”
God help him, he wants to cross the length of the garage and feel Tony up, every square inch as he rides his orgasms –
Half-kneeling this closely to Tony, Steve notices the little things. How chapped Tony’s lips are, and how a particularly large gash is speckled with dried blood. A workshop mishap? Steve’s thumb brushes against the border, and it scrapes. Dehydration. And it’s awfully chilly in here, a fact he’s only come to realise since he burns like a furnace himself. The stress lines on Tony’s cheeks are more pronounced, the bags under his eyes a little greyer than Steve remembers.
They say, absence makes the heart grow fonder. As he waves Steve away and clambers into his bed, he’s already looking forward to waking up.
“Don’t cry,” Tony whispers, and Steve digs his chin into the crook of Tony’s shoulder. He shudders, and believes the last tears he’s shed has seeped into Tony’s pyjamas. He sneaks a hand under Tony’s pants and deliberates around the pubic region, fingers toying with a small patch of dark curls. Just waiting for permission. He gets it quickly when Tony clamps his teeth about Steve’s jugular, the tip of his tongue gracing the skin there. And Steve dives in. He pumps Tony’s cock in earnest, already slowly gaining interest in Steve’s attention. Steve craves for something else too. He straddles Tony’s waist and peppers all visible areas with tear-streaked, open-mouthed kisses. He hungers for… He’s done pretending to be so
It’s all Steve can do to herd Tony back into the safety of the Tower’s foyer, using his glorious super-soldier physique as a physical barrier between them and the clawing crowd. Vision phasing through the ceiling is most welcomed – at the nick of time – and he hovers six feet off the ground. He has a smile on, so warm it could melt the snow, and Steve blinks in amusement when the crowd starts
detailed medical report. Very entertaining. I almost vomited on the spot.” At least Steve has the decency to look conflicted and miserable – and he should damn well be. Making up excuses for a bloodthirsty lunatic, seriously. Did Barnes beat him up too much it addled him? “So don’t ask me to
“Biometrics. So, I’m betting thumbprints or retina scans, but with SHIELD, it’s up for toss. Maybe it’s scalp patterning. Hair swirls. Oh, wait…”
Like he said, this isn’t the Ritz. Still, Tony dozes off the soonest his head touches the makeshift pillows of stacked-up rugs.
Pardon him for forgetting the shaving foam and razors before he hopped onto the car and drove somewhere ten hours from DC on the fly. “I get that we need the gas. But, I don’t have the cash, and we’re
, repulsor engines and possibly guns based on Howard’s work on the Tesseract.” Without further prompting, Steve himself is drawing the same conclusion. His worries are justified. They’re not paranoia after all. “The missing link – phase two – is the crime prediction algorithm. It’s not ready yet. Insight isn’t completed.”
“No, I’m not. Is this too hot for you to handle? I would do something for you, you know,” Tony waves nonchalantly at the raging erection in Steve’s lap. “But… nah.”
Tony runs his fingers through his hair, and splutters the one thing that’s perhaps, the most sensible thing he ever spouted today. “Join me for lunch?”
The door yawns open and a figure promptly faceplants into the tatami mat. Despite the distance, Steve’s nose wrinkles at the stench of vodka. Even for a highly functioning alcoholic, that’s quite excessive, isn’t it? Tony rolls to his side, but is too inebriated to sit up on his own.
” he raises his envelope to eye level before pulling out the documents it contained. “Is a comprehensive lab report of… shall we say,
The whizz of a zipper being pulled down cuts through the hanging tension. His button comes undone. The belt buckle catches the glow of the recessed lighting above. Steve drops to his knees next, and all kinds of alarms go off in Tony’s noggin. He reclines further into the desk, and for the umpteenth time in the last hour, doesn’t know what to do with his hands.
“Ah yes,” Erskine responded thoughtfully. “I like the thinking behind that strategy.” He noticed the rest of them shuffling a bit.  “I believe you have a study group to attend? If you don’t mind, I’d like to speak with Steven for a moment, and then off to study for you all.”
Steve surged up to kiss him.  He wondered if Tony realized, as he ran his fingers down Tony’s spine, felt him tremble, felt his own heart swell in response, trying to envelop him in love, that Steve already knew he would give Tony forever.
At night, he’d dream.  Peggy. Beautiful, vibrant, in red.  In uniform.  “Come back to me,” she’d say, in an empty dance hall. In a bombed out French bar.  In a graveyard, mist trailing at the bottom of her hem.
Tony laughed, just the right mix of indulgent and irritated. “New staff, right? Sorry, Obie, I have to get this one home. It’s his first big event, and looks like he’s had too much fun.” Out of the corner of his eye he could see Everhart lose interest the minute Steve entered the picture. He was just an assistant, after all.  Pretty, but low ranking. Obie just patted him on the back, chuckling tolerantly.  He knew Obie would understand.
“Don’t worry about it, Tony.  I’ll get it.  You always do,” Steve told him.  He went downstairs and brought back dinner, setting it on the coffee table with a stack of paper plates.  Then he went to the kitchen and got a pack of rootbeer, placing it so Tony could reach it easily. While Steve situated himself in the available armchair, Thor stripped off his shirt, claiming the garment interfered with his enjoyment of watching films. Natasha rolled her eyes.
If it was a day like any other, Steve should come wandering down in about fifteen minutes with his sketchbook.  Even if they didn’t have a project to work on, he seemed to drift into the workshop anyway.  It was the best part of Tony’s day, although sometimes he was busy and didn’t get to spend as much time talking as he’d like.  A few of his sketches hung around the workshop.  Sometimes Tony thought he should take them down.  They gave him away.  But Steve hadn’t seemed to notice yet, so they weren’t an issue.
Tony turned around, but Steve had his back to him.  “Right, well, feel free to take them out for a test drive. Let me know if they need adjustments.” He wanted to keep Steve in the workshop, but wasn’t really sure how to do that without giving himself away.  “Where’d you put the LF?” He couldn’t help himself.  He knew Steve didn’t like the name, but it was like he couldn’t stop pulling his proverbial pigtails.
That burrito seemed like it wanted to make a reappearance, so Tony lay down in his bed and tried to keep it down.  He didn’t wake up until the next morning.  Still nothing in email.
Eventually Tony throws his hands up. The idiot doesn’t have a weapon—not even a goddamn shield. Tony goes back to the tower and opens a familiar file of measurements.
Rhodey, Barnes, and Natasha were talking shop, Rhodey clearly impressed by the shot Barnes had made and still curious about what Natasha had used. They parted ways, Natasha winding her arm around Barnes and tucking her small hand into his back pocket.
“Yep.  No more one-armed bear wrestling for you.  And before you say it, yes, she’s the best thing that’s ever happened to you and that includes when you got your expert qualification.”
“Well, Batroc says that he can’t get it done.  He says the accords can’t be signed for several weeks.  But… Here’s the thing.  Jarvis?”
Tony actually laughed, narrowly avoiding spitting a blueberry at the guy. “I’m not an officer, Rogers. Military is definitely not my style.”
In a manner of speaking? Well. Still. Maybe he shouldn’t look at the texts directly, but Jarvis could still help him out. “What’s the issue, J?”
“It’s only a day, Steven,” she cautioned him. “I can’t change someone’s nature. When the sun rises on you, my powers will end.”
that pizza?” Tony was incredulous, but he didn’t see a take-out box.  How had he done that? Tony was a genius, and Italian, and he couldn’t make pizza.  A negroni, sure.  Pizza? Surely you had to take lessons for that.
“Okay.  After robotics tomorrow, Nat is coming to Steve’s chemistry study group.  Do you want to come with us?”
Rhodey kicked the back of the chair.  “Tones, how’s the robotics championship coming? Should we show up at competition this weekend?”
“Alright, Ken doll,” Tony said, noting how Steve winced a bit at the name.  Not comfy with the looks then. Weird, considering he’d won the genetic lottery somehow. “Start now.  I’ll have Happy bring the bike into the garage when he comes back.  Find you a room somewhere.”
Tony slipped his heavy card down onto the bill, winking at the waitress when she picked it up.  “Miss, can you get us an extra set of enchiladas with the works, and a salad to go? Thanks.” He didn’t think Steve had made dinner. He sent a quick text to let him know he’d picked something up for him.
In the kitchen, Steve cleaned up the mess from dinner, carefully washing and wiping each dish.  Tony Stark was not what he had expected.  Sure, he was slick, and talked fast, and worked with the privilege of money, always sure he could buy his way out of the problem.  But still.  Anyone who took profits and decided to dig wells? Maybe he wasn’t what Steve had thought.  And yes, he thought he’d heard something about intellicrops—low water usage varietals of wheat, corn, and alfalfa—suitable for use in the more inhospitable climes.  Then again, Bucky was missing an arm.  Courtesy of Stark weaponry.  It literally said so, on the side.  Branded and everything.  What kind of a traitor sells weapons, no matter what the reward, to the enemy?  And, did that really seem like the same person who was digging wells? Then there was the thing with Howard…
And honestly, it was better this way.  He’d been stupid enough to show up on a news conference. What an idiot. He’d put his face on live television answering Miss Everhart.  Stern knew where he was now. And it wasn’t fair to get Tony involved in any capacity.  He obviously didn’t know about Rebirth, about Erskine or Howard or Phillips.  He didn’t know about Stern. The last thing Tony needed was Stern causing problems, and Steve had brought that to his doorstep anyway.
Steve fixed the moment in his mind.  He had maybe twelve hours left.  He wanted this every day for the rest of his life.  “You make me so happy,” Steve told him.  And it was true.  Sure, he knew that it was going to end, and that he wasn’t sure he was equipped to handle that loss.  He had thought he was. He didn’t know what he’d expected, but this easy, sweet love, this was more than he thought he’d ever have, more than he had imagined. Njorun had said he’d be the only one hurt, and it was a deal he’d make, over and over again, protecting Tony more reflex than second nature.  But he didn’t know what would be left of himself, tomorrow.
Tony jumped up. “I’ll go with you. Totally have to pee.” Maybe he’d see something more of Steve. Something that would tell him, definitively.
Tony’s brain reset.  “Oh, well. I just meant, she was hot in the general sense.  Like, she’s very pretty. You totally have a chance with her,” he amended.
Then he heard a soft thud and a high whine, not the product of a larynx.  “Tony?” No one answered.  “Tony? Tony, please answer me!” His pulse raced. What the hell was going on? He hit video.  He could see Tony, on the couch, a panicked look in his eye, but the phone was moving, the picture shaky, Tony was definitely not holding the phone anymore but who was? A flash of one of the many mirrors that Tony had said Pepper’s designer scattered around “for Feng Shui,” a brief reflection of a tall bearded man, shiny bald pate. The line went dead.  Fuck.
“So I went to the experts.” Steve stood up and started walking toward Tony.  “Because I want to keep this. I will give up anything for you.  I am lucky to be here, with you.  If I had a time machine, I’d break it.  So if you really don’t want me, I can respect that. But if this is some sabotage or self-sacrifice, then I want you to know that I, wholeheartedly, want you, shellhead. I thought it through.  I love you, Tony Stark.”
“Divorce, huh?” Steve asked, gently, pulling Tony close.  “I guess we’d have to get married for that to happen.” It didn’t sound like a new thought to him.  “And maybe that’s one way to make sure you won’t run on me.” He didn’t wait for Tony to formulate a response, just kissed him, over and over, as if he could heal all the spaces in Tony that bled.
Don’t worry. I understand.  You know, I like Batman, but my favorite was always Wonder Woman.  You know, Lasso of Truth, doing the right thing the right way.  I mean, they’re both vigilantes, technically, but the way she would always end up tied up and then rescue herself—actually, that doesn’t exactly sound how I meant it.  I mean the way she would always… now that I think about it, there was a lot of kinky shit in Wonder Woman.  Okay, maybe let’s take a step back from that one, reconsider why I was so into WW.  Man.  I mean, I thought it was because she was all about equality and justice, and my dad thought it was because I wanted to bone her, so win-win.  But now… It’s like my entire childhood is being refocused, right in front of my eyes!
She kissed the top of his head and slid the ring onto his right hand.  “Love you,” she said fondly.  Then she turned to Steve.  “Thank you, Steve.  I owe you one.”
Tony joined him in the shower, then, claiming he was sore and tired, wheedled Steve into a nap.  Lying down, Tony turned over. “C’mere, big guy.”
Steve looked up, the same radiant look in his eyes, this time mirroring the morning sun that gilded his skin and swept down his lashes.  He was so beautiful, it made Tony’s heart ache. Not with want or desire, just his sheer loveliness.
Tony swears. He takes the elevator down, grabs the cuffs.  He sees his reflection in one of the glass panels.  He’s covered in Steve’s blood, red on red.  It looks like his nightmares.
“I’ve never played mini golf,” Steve admitted, trying to avoid the thought of dancing with Tony—pressing against him, feeling the rough scrape of his goatee against his cheek, being able to splay his hands over the muscles of Tony’s back, feeling them flex and shiver—who’d sat down on the bed to place the crackers within reach.
“I want to…” Steve thinks of lying next to Tony, stretched out, sunshine warming them both.  He remembers the way Tony had smiled when Steve had brought coffee and a tiny bouquet of flowers.  The way he’d touched the petals. The way he’d smiled, and stayed, that first morning, how he hadn’t run away.
Tonight, Tony’d gone to bed at a reasonable hour, in preparation for a press conference he had to have tomorrow morning.  He didn’t look great, either.  Steve kept making his meals healthy, and Tony insisted he wasn’t sick. But he looked tired. Still, he was in bed now, so Steve dropped off easily.
Just as he wondered where the phone was—was he supposed to use his own phone? It still flipped open and was so old he wasn’t sure how many more times he could get it to power on.  Was that secure?—Happy trudged up the stairs.
“I wasn’t saying it was. I was just wondering about adding in a secondary program.  For when he’s just out in the neighborhood.  Like a tutoring program, or bilingual translations. Maybe he can earn some extra credit.”
“Stop saying my name like that!” He was defensive now, but he couldn’t help it. It was still sort of a sore spot.  And embarrassing. He’d thought
“Well, I can do that.  Is there anything specific he likes? Or, should I order something from somewhere? I…” Steve had no idea what Mr. Stark would eat.  What did rich people eat, anyway? Should he just order from Le Bernadin? Was that even open for lunch?
I’m really glad finals are coming soon.  How was your day?” That was general. That was bland.  “I’ve been thinking about you a lot.” It was true.  He’d been hoping, a lot, that it wasn’t Rumlow.
Steve turned, giving him that look, the one that was both disapproval and amused tolerance all at once.  “I left him with Natasha.  She has a brush.”
Selvig looked at Steve.  Steve just shrugged and nodded.  He stretched out his hand to Brock.  Brock just looked at it, walked back to the motorcycle and flipped it on, riding away in a cloud of dust.
Steve realises belatedly that the bag is starting to spill sand from the seams. He’s been working at this long enough, time to tap out. There are also footsteps shuffling from the adjacent corridor. He’s certainly hogged the facility enough.
“SHIELD thinks the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour, and that led to Nick’s death.”
. “There’s plenty of space for a massage in the living room. This whole suite is larger than your room downstairs. Who do I need to call? Your supervisor? Get them on the line, I’ll talk to them.”
The whole world is wrong about Steve. There is nothing wholesome about America’s favourite son. All of this, the lewd little sounds lacing Steve’s breath, the way his fist is pumping in his pants – all his. All Tony’s.
It’s the generic pitch when he approaches potential investors for money. He’s got a few to systematically rendezvous with on his appointment list. He’s got one tomorrow, actually. He’ll work his charm, make them believe in this as much as he does, and the game’s in the bag, yes?
If there’s…” his voice breaks, and he pinches the bridge of his nose. “If there’s a chance’s chance that he’s
Steve chuckles some more. “I know. I stopped by a gas station to get more water. It’s straight out from the tap, so you want to boil it first.”
Tony stuffs his right ear with the earpiece and starts it. No chatter yet, so nobody’s active on the line, which is perfectly fine. It’s still too early for shit to go down. Two minutes of inactivity and already he’s itching to cartwheel across the canteen and juggle empty paper cups. “Hey, Steve?” He pretends to cough into his sleeves, and shirks his shoulder to jam the earpiece deeper into his ear. “You copy?”
“Of course not. That would immediately expose HYDRA’s base of operation to the world. Camp Lehigh isn’t SHIELD’s anymore, is it?” The camp is abandoned. Annihilated, last time he checked.
“Right. And you’re so sure of that because he gave you a three-inch deep stab wound in your right shoulder, three bullet wounds – one of them nearly severing your femoral artery, let’s not forget that – a dislocated jaw and clavicle, bruised kidneys, broken ribs – I don’t know if that’s from the CPR or him trying to murder you. Oh, that, of course. Barnes, trying to murder you.” Tony taps his chin repeatedly with his thumb. “Yeah. I might have missed a couple of things. It was a
to jump the gun. He can’t tolerate a second longer of SHIELD’s grubby paws on his tech, not when he suspects something is rotten in Denmark.
Tony scoots lower until he’s suddenly sitting atop Steve’s crotch, and he gyrates his hip, his hardened bulge rubbing against Steve’s. “Oh, someone’s interested?”
And OH. MY. GOD. It's over! I hope the ending is not too abrupt. Thank you so much for staying with me to the bitter(sweet) end! We have a coda left in the next chapter, and that's it. <3 A sequel awaits, folks. Until then.
Tony starts in his seat and drops the screwdriver he’s holding, and what little colour left in his face disappears completely.
“How is Steve?” She slips her petite hand between the railings to grasp Steve’s limp one. She squeezes, and Tony looks away. He does that every other hour too, if only to assure himself that Steve hasn’t accidentally passed in his sleep.
Leave no stones unturned. Send an hourly report direct to the Avengers line, and any sighting of Stark is to be reported via Avengers comm
There’s a scratching and pawing sound, a soft sigh, and a depressed grunt – Steve’s heart leap to his throat, his hand quickly reaching into his pocket for his phone. He has Tony’s doctor’s number on speed dial, and is about to sprint into the bedroom when –
Steve bypasses the arc reactor in Tony’s chest, and the supervising Agents did not complain. Emboldened, the frisking continues in earnest. Tony makes his discomfort obvious, grunting as Steve prods him under his armpits, along his flanks and turns his pockets inside out. “You could’ve just asked,” Tony snaps, annoyed. Steve’s fingers just grazed the length of Tony’s limp cock. All to the blissful ignorance of everyone.
“It’s five-thirty,” Steve whispers as he combs Tony’s hair briefly with his fingers. It took a while for Tony to fall asleep, even after he commandeered Steve’s left thigh for his pillow. “You up?” Steve hand had rested atop the arc reactor for some glorious three hours the night before. Sometimes, he tapped a steady
“I spoke with Fury earlier. I know he’s been giving you a hard time, and frankly speaking part of it is on you.” Steve smiles fondly at the accusation, and so does Tony. This is a precious memory to have of a friend, so Steve holds on to the moment for as long as he can. “We don’t appreciate your contributions to the team enough, I admit that. And I regret that it went down that way. No, let me have this, Tony,” he bats Tony down quickly. “You’re an important asset to the team, no lesser than the rest of us. You and I operate on different functions and mechanisms, and I was too…” Steve huffs again, “prideful, perhaps. I needed to peg you down to the… hivemind. You laugh, now,” Steve smiles again.
Tony flinches so hard the cubicle itself rattles as he pushes against it. He bats away Steve’s offending hand, and Clint turns the shower off. “No what?”
