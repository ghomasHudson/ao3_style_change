At least he still had his little patched together family. Bruce, Victor, Peter. Pepper and Rhodey too, even if they didn't live in the tower anymore. It was really far on the down low, but Pepper was actually pregnant right now. The marriage had been planned and set in place before she had even realized. She was only two weeks in now, so she wasn't showing at all which was lucky given that she had bought the dress before.
"What about Bucky." Just keep him talking. Tony grabs the roll of gauze, stretching it out and meeting Steve's eyes before placing one end on the top bullet bandage.
"Hi everyone." Steve gives a little wave to the camera, feeling a light pink creeping up his collar. "Ok um.. so there have been some things being said about me in the past few hours that are... not right. Morally. I am proud to call myself a Christian, and I would like to make it very clear that those who preach hate do not adequately follow the Lords teachings of kindness, and disgrace his good name." Tony gives him a little thumbs up and Steve can't help his smile. "That being said, the journal found and displayed by the Smithsonian does indeed belong to me, and it is saying exactly what everyone is thinking it does. I'm not going to bullshit you with something about how we had different ways of spreading affection and I was hyperbolizing. It wouldn't be true. I am, as Tony helped me word it, very happy to be gay." An honest smile flickers into Tony's face. "So I guess you can count this as me coming out. I have a lot to learn, and a lot to unlearn, but I vow to all of you at home that I will do my best to become more educated on our shared history. Tony told me that I should go to Pride this June, but given that I'm not exactly sure what that is yet, I'm going to hold off on making any commitments. I hope you all have a good rest of your day. Spread love, not hate." Steve gives a little salute to the camera, looking up at Tony and grinning, watching him turn the recording off. "How's that?"
"So.. your body will combust in the way that Lady Jane's would've?" Thor asks, looking very suddenly concerned for his friend.
She goes silent, for a long moment, then yells something indistinct to someone else. "I'm very busy right now. Why can't you just do it, Rogers," She says quickly.
He could see himself getting used to this. And lots of cake in their future. Towering monsters, or one layer simple cakes, coffee cakes and pound cakes and lemon cakes and cupcakes. Yeah, he'll bake Tony as many goddamn cakes as he wants.
"Bye!" Howard says, waving to them over his shoulder. "You would not believe, Jarvis. This puts our adventures to shame."
"That's the spirit. Let's knock the socks off this shit." Tony punches his shoulder, producing a tablet from god knows where. Then they get to work.
"Yes I do know the renegade, Peter and his friends taught me. You absolutely don't need to look it up."
"That is a good point," Tony concedes, smoothing out his suit jacket as best as he could. "Come on angel face, I'll call us a taxi."
"Epic forced of darkness and light—" he continues to talk, and Steve watches, until the final words Tony Stark ever had for them in this life—everything's going to work out exactly the way it's supposed to. I love you 3000–directed at Morgan, of course, but for a spare second, Steve imagines that they were for him. A declaration of love, sure, but it was forgiveness. Something in his mind protested that the words weren't his, but the hope is enough. The hope that Tony truly had forgiven him for everything.
"It's quite alright dear. I'd best be off. Natasha, Ivan," she gives them a nod, her eyes lingering on Steve's lips for a moment to long before she walks off into the crowd of rich people, her shiny black pumps clicking on the floor.
The near predatory look he gives her was almost enough to make Steve snap as it is, if they were really dating, he might've just beaten the man to a pulp. "Gideon didn't mention that to and of us. Even in death he's finding ways to do whatever he wants. Still, I hope to be seeing more of you around. If he trusted you two that much, I do as well."
Steve rolls his eyes to avoid any more of this weird awkward small talk crap. "Congrats guys. But it that's all for tonight, we kinda have a date to finish." He had promised Tony a drink after dinner after all.
"Don't ask me..." Steve says with a shrug. Either way, he knew that whatever Tony was playing at, he was going to get his way.
The possibilities were endless. He was on top of the world, and nobody could take him down now. So many years spent alone could finally mean something, as long as he could make this work.
Tony smiles. "I'll make up for it." He pulls some pants on and walks out of the room, only to find Wanda laying on the couch watching the bachelorette. "Morning Wanda," Tony says.
"You're kidding. Of course I'm coming with, you promised me a drink after this." Tony scoots towards the edge of the booth, taking his card back from the waiter. "Thanks," he says, standing up.
"Come on birthday boy, I have a surprise for you," Tony says, rubbing his back and kissing him gently.
"I'll get your number from Steveie if I need it," Bucky concludes, leaning back against Steve, who slings an arm around him comfortably.
"Oh hush. It's not your wedding." Still, Steve stoops down to give him one last kiss before taking his arm back. "I'll come see you before you know it.
There's so many things Steve could say. It was Tony's fault they hadn't seen each other for two weeks. But all that anger was... it was useless now that Tony was back in his arms. "I love you."
"I just... I just don't know where my home is anymore. If I ever even had one. It just feels like I don't belong anywhere." It's a moment of raw honesty. He doesn't even have to think about the words. His throat doesn't clench and his cheeks don't burn until after the confession is out there, meeting his ears for the first time. She doesn't say anything, but he knows she hasn't fallen asleep, because she continues to rub the back of his hand.
Thor freezes for a moment, taking in the carnage. "Come on, we need to get back to them." Steve offers Thor his hand, and he springs into action, flying them across the war zone and sending them crashing through a beautifully ornate window. No sooner do they enter when a burst of golden light flies out, sending both blonds stumbling backward. Deep below then, the castle rumbles and Natasha screams. "No no no no," Steve says, breaking out into a full sprint. "Natasha!" He shouts. This could be bad, this could be really bad. Really really bad.
They had been childhood friends, inseparable, even when Steve's ma lost the house and they had to move. Every morning, Steve would be up at four to walk the five miles to Bucky's school. When he was lucky, Ms. Barnes would pick him up with a smile spreading across her rosy cheeks and her hair impeccably curled. "Hey sugar," she greeted him.
"Bullshit. You implied that your hissy fit at your wedding was his fault," Sam says, his voice low and near a growl.
"It's about him. And Bucky." She holds out her tablet, tapping at it, then setting it on his lap. "The Winter Soldier killed his parents, Steve. I feel like that should come from you."
He listens quietly, practically ready to start praying. Maybe he should pray. Wind was roaring in his ears, though, and he doubted he would be able to hear Steve anyways.
"Well, Howard should be driving down this road in a minute." He pops the case open, lifting the shining blue space stone into his palm. It twinkles at him in the bright sunlight, as if it were just some pretty rock.
Steve shrugs, taking the first sip of warm coffee. It sprouts across his mouth with the taste of searing vanilla and strawberry. He blinks away the vision of Tony's lips on his. There was no hand on his cheek and no puzzling man in front of him, just a question. "Yeah of course. Gotta meet the parents." He was proud, really. That was way further then Pietro usually got, and as far as Steve was concerned, it was time for him to settle down. Even if that made him sound like his mom.
That surprised most people. They pegged him as the type who would have no trouble picking anyone up. Going off his looks alone, he could probably get half of New York home with him. And he was a pretty nice guy, with a stable career who was doing pretty well for himself. So Steve, why are you so incompetent with people? Great question thanks for asking. He liked to blame his asthma. When he was little, it was so bad that he was bedridden and scrawny, and nobody wanted to flirt with someone who couldn't even come to school half the time. Then he hit puberty and he got some experimental drugs that shot him up to being easily the most attractive person in the high school. Even then, he was struggling to keep up in school after so much time sick that he didn't have time to consider dating. When he finally got out of college, he realized that maybe he should've learned how to talk to people, after all he didn't want to be alone forever.
"Some of the other customers are uncomfortable, I'm very sorry." In her stress, a bit of her southern accent seeps through
"You're the face of the company, not me. Clint will lend you a tux." She says quickly. Clint yells something he can hear through the phone and Nat mutters something angry back at him that causes him to quiet down. "Perfect, it's decided. Bye Steve."
"Of course I do," Steve says immediately, his eyes flickering up to Tony. He blinks, a bit of shock on his face before it smooths over into a smile. Steve blinks, trying to assess the reason with a clear head, even as pink creeps into his cheeks. "So I was thinking we could do lunch. I know this great sandwich place and we could eat there or take it to the park."
Steve's pretty sure that's how love works. He's never been in love, but he would sure like to be. It was too soon to say really, but he could see falling in love with Tony. It's not something he would commit to right now, but really, he can almost picture a life together. Them and Peter and all their friends. He could be friends with Tony's friends, and Tony could be friends with his friends and it would all be good. Maybe. In the future.
"And you love it," Bucky taunts back, pushing Tony's legs off his lap. Tony grumbles, sitting up on Steve's lap instead. "I would say our best bet would be to—"
Footsteps approach and a tall man glares down at her. "What do you want?" He says in a gruff heavily German accent.
He presses his dick against Steve's rosy lips, which part for him gratefully, letting Tony slip into the slick warmth of his boyfriends mouth. "You think I should fuck your pretty face?" Tony asks sweetly, rocking in and out in shallow thrusts on Steve's tongue, while he hollows his cheeks around Tony's weight, doing his best to nod.
"Don't go too far," Steve says, squeezing his hand before grabbing the phone out of his pocket. He turns away as he presses it to his ear. "Hello?"
"Of course. Yes to both of those things," Steve says quickly with a smile. He walks back towards the door. "Pietro, I'm leaving!" He shouts, trusting that Pietro could hear him even though he didn't respond.
Ok, yes, this is the last chapter BUT. You may have noticed that I added this as the first work in a collection, because indeed, just as I expected, I was unable to stop myself. So I have a one shot prepared that will go up in a couple days that takes place during the events of this story and a story that happens right after this one in the drafts. So stay tuned, haha. Thanks for sticking with me on this ride, xoxo!
"I'd like to know if you'll be coming to the party tonight, Peter," Steve says, keeping Tony's eye contact. He was close enough that Steve didn't need to have it on speaker.
Just then a waitress appears in front of the table, her hair in honey brown curls. "Heya, how can I help you?" Her voice is tinted with a southern accent that makes Steve wonder where she is from and what she's doing in New York.
She snorts, kicking the car into drive. "I suspect there are people who would be offended by Captain America expressing a sentiment like that." She drives back out of the spot, speeding back towards the Starks' mansion.
It was sloppy, and wet everywhere, and Steve looked an absolute wreck, and god Tony was barely hanging on. He was definitely going to come like this, with Steve's cheeks hollowed around him and the fierce constriction of his throat as he desperately tries to pull in air. Almost every thrust skits Steve's teeth across the base of his cock, but neither of them much care. Steve moans loudly, his body twitching. Tony tugs on his hair gently, still balled in his fist. "Steve," Tony moans, though it's not him who's choking. Steve gets it though, and even wrecked as he was, he's still able to construct his mouth for a few seconds before Tony comes in heavy spurts, pulling halfway out so he can get most of it on his tongue rather than right down his throat. Steve pants into it, closing his mouth and swallowing down. Tony tucks his cock back into his pants, rebuttoning them.
"Just like how much I'm going to charge you for the cake now that I know you're loaded," Steve teases, kissing his cheek softly.
Tony snorts. "Obviously. They're not rumors, by the way. I've confirmed it more than once. The media just likes to talk."
She smiles at Loki's name, still looking sad. "They need nothing but each other." She steps away. "I'll see you again, perhaps."
The waiter sets down two plates of tiramisu and the bill in front of them and Tony slides they bill towards himself. "So not to be presumptuous, but I thought this was pretty fun," he says, spearing the corner of his tiramisu with a fork.
"Do too." His breathing is heavy, labored. Tony doubts he would even remember this conversation in a few hours.
"I'm sorry Buck, I can't.. I'm not what you need." Steve sits next to him, neither facing each other. "I have to go." His mind reminds him of the look on Peppers face when she told him the world needed him to be strong. She was right.
"I need your dick. Please Tony, I'll be so good, just for you." He licks his lips, pulling Tony closer with his hands.
Because every marvel fic needs a villain. There’s some more kinda serious homophobia in the next chapter, but only in the like, overt way that asshole family members do, and then they go “I’m not homophobic”
Was he going back? Well.. yes. Eventually, he had to go back. He could spend a few years in the past, but he still had a job to do, he knew that now. With Nat back, the whole ordeal would be a thousand percent more tolerable. He still had a world to protect—or maybe a whole universe now. Well, the Guardians and Carol could handle the universe. Maybe the world was ambitious enough.
"Strawberry with gold and coral fondant flowers. Kinda like that one in the case." He points to the purple flowered display cake, currently in a darkened display case.
Peter obviously hesitates, his eyes flickering to Steve. "Ms. Leeds um.. said she didn't mind picking me up."
Tony obliges, unable to come up with a reason not to move. He collapses into the largest couch, leaning his head against the arm rest. The lights dim as Peter walks over with a bowl of freshly popped corn, the teen sitting himself directly between Tony's legs, his weight acting a little like one of those anti anxiety blankets. The movie starts playing as soon as Peter settles, tossing popcorn into his mouth. Tony takes a handful, watching the screen intently. "He doesn't deserve you, Tony," Peter says at a lull in the action.
And boy does Howard deliver. By some miracle, he finds the same broadcast Steve had woken up to all those years ago (from now?), and they get Nat into a just questionable enough 40's nurse outfit and stick the thawed Captain America in a 40's hospital room. All that's left now is to wait for him to wake up. Nat taps her foot, standing next to him and watching the footage through the tiny embedded camera focused on him. Bucky was sitting deadly still on a cushioned velvet chair, waiting with a nervous silence.
Tony squints at him. "Don't take this the wrong way, because you're welcome, but what the hell do you mean? Why would I be mad at you?"
When he wakes up, it's to a rapid tapping at the door. "Rogers!" Nat calls to him. Tony sits up first, prying himself away from Steve's chest and looking back at him. "Can I come in?"
Steve looks between her and the footage rolling across the screen of her tablet, of Howard calling out to Sargent Barnes, and Maria's final moments. "Ok." He looks down at his lap. This wasn't going to be pretty. "Thanks. I'll... yeah. He'll... do you think he'll understand?"
"You haven't heard my but yet," he says gently, pulling a hair back. "I can't forgive him. Not yet. I know it's not his fault, but I can't. And I'm not ready to help you look for him. I understand that you have to, but I just... I can't."
"Natasha," he greets, his face lighting up with a matching smile as she leans in to give him a warm hug. If Steve were only slightly less attuned, he wouldn't have noticed the slight moving of her lips or the ever so subtle crease of his brows that was gone in half a second. This was an exchange from two friends, sure, but more exactly, two people remarkably accustomed to this kind of secret interaction in the middle of public eye. "How was Fiji, darling?"
"That's none of your business, Vanya." Nat teases, collapsing onto the large bed. "I'm just an expert."
"Well, Amy, there's our answer," one of the women from earlier says, the screen panning out back to them. The microwave starts in the background. "So. Thoughts?"
She rises to her feet, looking down at the magic still floating through her fingers. It's like a punch to the gut, the way she admired it. She was dirty from not showering and there was a big red pimple on her cheek bone, but in that moment, Steve could've sworn this was the most beautiful he's seen her. He shakes it out of his head... probably just residual fever shit. "Alright boys, what do you say we test this out." She smirks at them, raising a brow with her eyes a fiery orange. A ball of the magic swells in her hand and she hurls it at the wall. It... spreads across the wall like rippling smoke. Steve feels his chest deflate a little. "Or not..." she looks down at her hand, all the glow gone from her eyes. She sits down at the foot of Steve's bed, hunching over her hand. "Any ideas."
"You aren't even looking at me." Tony kisses his nose, completely loosing track of what he was going to say next as soon as Steve opens his eyes, open and wanting and so so sweet. All for Tony. Steve's fingers trace possessively over the hickeys and bruises marring Tony's skin. "I have.. I have plans," Tony protests valiantly, his eyes slipping closed as he lets out a gasp at Steve's fingers so carefully pressing into his hips where he had had Tony pinned down last night.
The part of Tony's mind that wasn't completely involved in the scene thought back to the designs of engagement rings he was drafting. Even like this, it made him all warm to hear Steve say that. The rest of him responds as he knew Steve wanted. "Then you'll get it." He pulls out his heavy cock, moist already with precome, both eyes on Steve, who's mouth had fallen wide open, a deeply pleased look on his face. Tony swiped at the head of his cock, moisture pooling on his thumb, which he promptly sets on Steve's tongue, pushing it down to the bottom of his mouth and holding his jaw wide open.
Unfortunately less than an hour later, reports come in of another big monster attack, until it starts to dissolve, revealing StarkIndustry drones. Tony looks at Steve and Steve looks at Tony and wordlessly they jump into action, running up into the nearest quinjet. "Friday," Tony says, typing in the coding to wake her up. Oh the perks of being a tech giant.
Steve laughs, a faint blush creeping onto his cheeks. "I wouldn't say that so soon. I haven't given you cat litter for our two month anniversary yet." They step into the elevator, side by side and Steve hits the button.
"You guys are fun. We can do a double date sometime." Steve pulls around his hand, slightly impatiently. "Until then," he winks and allows himself to be pulled off, away from the newly engaged couple, a wide smile on his face.
For the next 20 minutes, they work together to get the shop ready for customers. The thing about running a bakery is that oftentimes the more delicate goods would go bad if they were left out overnight so every time they opened or closed, they had to move trays upon trays back and forth. As soon as the clock hits 6:00, Sam is out front, unlocking the door and setting out the signs. Almost immediately a woman comes through and ends up ordering a dozen cupcakes. Sam goes back to start working on the cupcakes while Steve starts to whip up a batch of frosting, which he preferred to do by hand and knew that people liked to watch, especially the actual frosting process. About halfway into the process the phone rings. Steve abandons his powdered sugar in favor of pressing the phone to his ear, holding it against his shoulder. "You've reached Star Bakery, how can I help you?" He says, picking the measuring cup back up.
Steve picks his way over to her, with a look of exasperation. "Wanda Maximoff, I think you forget to tell me that this was the wedding you were going to."
"Yes. Wish Ms. Romanoff my best." The phone clicks before Steve can reply. God, he hates dealing with old men who think they're so mysterious and important, god, they can't have a normal ducking conversation. He hangs up the phone angrily, sitting down on the floor with a huff.
"I'm working as fast as I can Rogers," Tony snaps, knowing exactly what look Steve had on his face right now. It was probably the angry puppy one if Tony knew his shit, and he did. Tony pulls up the files they needed, tapping out a few lines of code for it to start uploading.
He can't really help but smile and blush while he pushes up to kiss him gently. "How can you say all that cute shit with a straight face," Tony complains between kisses.
Then they went to the MoMA, damp as they still were from their canoe trip, and both, far louder than most of the other patrons. Steve talks about his favorite pieces, and Tony watches him with every shred of his focus, a true feat considering that most of the time his mind is running at least nine other things at any given time. Vaguely, Tony knows they're being filmed, but he doesn't really care. The relationship shouldn't have to be a secret just because Tony was really really rich and cool.
“Indeed,” Tony agreed.  “And then he takes my phone number, which I am taping here,” he said, his voice a bit garbled around the cap of the Sharpie he was using to write on the piece of duct tape that went on the drone’s belly.  “Texts me his deets--that’s
“I’m saying, you have to think about how this looks,” Fury said, holding up a placating hand.  “You know what people are going to say.  Why was Tony out there in the first place, all by himself like that?  Why didn’t he just leave?  If he was in trouble, why didn’t he call for help?  There’s practically an entire brigade a doing the chicken dance not a hundred feet away.”
Steve would remember.  He was good at remembering things.  He would be here.  He wouldn’t forget, not something like this.  No matter how…busy…he was.  With other things.  That Tony wasn’t going to think about. Think about the car, Tony told himself.  The beautiful, expensive, laden-with-guilt-car that showed up in the middle of Steve’s absence.  Yeah.  Good call. Focus on that, Tony thought with an inward eye roll.
“I spent most of it in cryosleep,” the alien explained.  “When I felt the need come upon me, I had no choice. As my time got closer, it became too painful to continue.  Cryosleep was the only way to stave off the inevitable.”
“Tell me you don’t love me, and this ends right now,” Tony said quietly.  “I’m not actually trying to ruin your life.  Not anymore than I already have.”
“I thought that was your Tony-What-Did-You-Blow-Up-Face,” Tony muttered.  “Honey-bear, meet Steve Rogers, my temporary ball and chain while we handle this tiny bump in the road, which was mostly not my fault.”
Or they did, but it was different now, wasn’t it, he realized grimly.  He wasn’t Tony Stark, Omega son and heir of Howard Stark, scion of the weapons and technology industries, a curiosity, if nothing else.  Not anymore.  He was some stranger’s Omega. Someone else was going to tell him where to live and what he could do, how to dress and what to read, but it wasn’t any of these someones, these men who had come to drink and smoke cigars and take away what little control he’d been clinging to, even as he’d known it for the illusion it was.  He was someone else’s property now, and we really must keep up social mores, mustn’t we, Tony thought sarcastically as the men walked past.  Wouldn’t want to do something improper while we’re handing someone off to play whore to some Alpha.  Good Lord, no.  Hide the good silver, Jarvis, Tony thought, feeling hysteria bubble up in his chest.
“I was running low, and this was all the hotel gift shop had in my size,” Steve said, glancing down at the boxers adorned with playing cards.  “Sorry it isn’t the thong. I know you liked that.”
“I’m not a soldier anymore,” Steve corrected, because for some reason he couldn’t fathom, that seemed important.  “I told you, I wanted this.” Tony smiled up at him, wild, wicked, beautiful--so beautiful.  “And I don’t know if I.  I mean, I’m not sure if--ooooh, fuck, Tony, that’s--ah-ah-ah--oh!” Steve stammered, his body quaking as Tony pushed three slick fingers inside his waiting hole.
A million dollars could do a lot.  Not just for him and Brock--there was that part of it, sure, but he could donate to that program Sam ran out of the VA.  Sam spent half his time applying for grants, and Steve knew it would be far better spent doing what he loved--helping veterans integrate back into society.  It was actually how he and Sam met, though most everyone assumed they knew each other from their military days.  Steve only went to a few meetings before he met Brock, but he remembered them being helpful.  Finding and keeping a steady relationship seemed pretty much a good indicator that he didn’t need to go anymore, though, as Brock pointed out. Besides, work kept him pretty busy.  But, still, it was a good program, and Sam shouldn’t have to struggle so much to get funding.
“So, I can’t really let you just meet him, you understand. We already had an…incident…with some Alpha military observer that was part of the recovery team, which I would not like to see repeated.  He’ll be okay, mind you.  Eventually,” Fury said, shrugging as if totally unconcerned.   “We’ve kept him isolated through the worst of it, but I’ve got a stack of increasingly belligerent messages from everyone from Ross on down demanding to meet him.  Somehow, I don’t think they are concerned about his health and well-being, if you catch my drift.”
“Switzerland would be great.  I’d love to tour CERN.  If we can, I mean. That’s the—they have the large hadron collider there. They’re working on measuring different stages of heavy-ion collision.  Fourier expansion coefficients and all that,” Tony said instead. The words tasted a bit like ash in his mouth. Dry and wrong.  They didn’t want to come out.  They wanted to stay buried, somewhere down below that lump in his throat, but he was tired.  Tired of saying all the buts, even when he knew they weren’t true.  These words, they were right, no matter how it felt to say them.  He knew it.  Steve knew it.  Even Howard fucking knew it.  “Fun stuff,” Tony added with a  grin that he couldn’t quite hold.
,” Danen added, nodding at Steve.  “Ignore this one.  She thinks she is special because she has served the Lady Christine for years and has forgotten her place when the Lady is away on her travels.”
“Let me know how the ride homes goes tonight,” Rhodey called out in a muffled, sleepy-sounding voice.
“I know what anyone would say about it, and I reckon some part of me will be saying those things to myself no matter what,” Steve admitted, “but I don’t regret it, Shellhead, I don’t.  It was—God, it was better than I ever could have imagined. No wonder the Church doesn’t want you to do that. You’d never think of anything else, would ya?” Steve did let a grin slip out at that thought.
The sketch of Maria was rolled into a half-curl on his bedside table when he woke, her eyes fixed, body a molded metal suit, bound in spirals of energy that Steve somehow managed to capture as if they were undulating on the page, up and down, a sinuous prison.  She should be expressionless.  Impassive.  But, there was something about the way she stared out from the page that implied an eerie, gleaming awareness, some kind of otherworldly power that was both beautiful and vaguely terrifying.    A machine, but a more human machine, something other, artificial and frighteningly real.  Something caught brutally in-between, and more threatening for it.
If he hit him, it would be immediately satisfying, true.  But, Tony was always more about the long game.
“You can relax, you know,” Barnes shouted at Steve as he disappeared into the apartment. “Nat already came by for the welfare check.  I’m fine.  Go back to…whatever you’re doing,” the man said, looking pointedly at Tony when he said it.  “Bulb’s out,” he added as an afterthought.
“Jealous,” Steve coughed into his hand and smiled up at Kirk, who was still focused on the painting with an intense sort of fascination stilling his features that made Steve’s stomach think it was on the Cyclone or something.  “It’s artistic license.  Looks better on top of a tree than a giant, exploding ball of gas.”
“I’ve got an alien using my memory rolodex to communicate. Disconcerting is one word for it,” Tony muttered, then smiled, softening it.  “Actually, it’s...okay, it’s weird, but it’s not, like, bad-weird. I mean, sure, having images of my old butler in my head while I have funky alien sex is weird, but…” he shrugged.
“The telescope?  The work at Caltech and SHIELD? The car?  The watch?  A trip abroad, I hear,” Jarvis listed them off, cocking his head in a speculative look at Tony. “Now MIT.  Something that I am certain was not as easy to accomplish as it sounds. It occurs to me that if you want something, he tends to want to give it to you, even when you do not know how to ask directly for it.”
Still...Steve’s mind whirled. It was odd, wasn’t it? Him and the man, both out here this time of night.  Maybe the man thought he was the odd one, Steve figured.  It made a lot more sense for a grown-up to be out at night, didn’t it?  Hadn’t the man said that? He had, and that--that made sense, it was just…something.  Something that raised the hairs on the back of Steve’s neck.
“Because you’re my Omega,” Steve replied, like he was stating the sky was blue, water was wet and Empire was the best Star Wars.
“That’s good, Steve.  Just like that,” Tony urged, voice tight and biting with strain.  He saw Tony wet his own lips and reach a hand down to cradle his cock as Steve repeated the motion.  It was easier now, with Tony watching, so clearly affected, because he could be doing it for Tony.   He didn’t know why that mattered, but it did.  Steve took another pass of it from his forehead and brought his fingers to his mouth.  “Stop,” Tony ordered sharply, eyes dark and hard, roaming possessively over Steve, making his skin tingle and warm.  “Use that on your cock,” Tony said, voice going low and hard.  “Make yourself come for me with my seed.”
He reached out and hooked one arm under Steve’s and the other behind Steve’s knees, cradling him to his chest. Steve sighed and pressed the side of his face against the cool metal of the armor as Tony carried him to the bed, setting him gently down on top of the comforter. Steve was staring up at Tony, his body slack and pliant, almost boneless as Tony arranged him on the bed. Tony pressed Steve back against the bed, then pushed his legs up and apart so Steve was spread open beneath him. He shifted position a bit so that he was kneeling below Steve’s spread legs, watching the way Steve’s cock was dripping pre-come into the pool of his navel, a delicate flush spreading over Steve’s skin as Tony observed him. The HUD was giving him all kinds of readouts, none of which were nearly as interesting as the sight before him.
“You’re not.  I’m not.  Probably none of us are,” Tony replied.  “But, and you know how much pains me to say this, Barnes is right.   There is nothing I want more right now than to help you, but you’ve got to decide to let me, and be okay with that.  You can let Barnes here call He Who Shall Not Be Named, let him tell your boss he has someone else for that job, and you can relax here today.  Maybe hang out at my place, if you want.  If you’re not there yet, though, that’s okay, too.  Happy will be downstairs in a few minutes, and he’ll take you to work.  It’s up to you.  There’s no right or wrong here, Steve.  Either way, I’ll be back here tonight, and, hopefully, we can celebrate our success with the Board.”
Clint slowly surveyed the room.  “Look, I’m going to clean everything up.   Nat, grab me a mop and some towels, would you?  Hulk, no more smashing.  Come on, buddy, like we talked about,” Clint urged.  “Gentle, gentle—oh, no, wait, don’t squeeze!”  Clint implored, holding out his hands in an attempt at a calming gesture.  “Okay, yeah, so that’s a definite no on the Hulk Poppins idea,” Clint acknowledged as the watermelon in Hulk’s hands burst, sending seeds, rind and bits of melon across the room.
Nat rolls her eyes. "Yep, sure, fine. Now get out of here, there's other people looking for that thing." From what they had learned from Rocket, Quill would be attacked shortly. His ship had been brought back here from Vormir,
Steve can see Loki standing and watching them, watching him especially, as they tear through their enemies like butter.
Tony shrugs, an easy look on his face. "I'm an engineer at heart, but I run the largest tech company on the globe. We make weapons, but I'm trying to get away from that right now. We also do sustainable energy and well.. prosthetics, if you don't mind the offer." He gestures subtly to Bucky's shoulder
"No, you're not," Nat says, taking it and snapping it shut. "This is what you were sent here to retrieve, we got it for you." She tosses it to him, as he catches it, eyes wide open.
"I mean, you don't want to.." Tony shrugs, collapsing into the seat next to Steve. "Just let them have at it. Although, I've tried it before... not a hot move. We can do something."
Steve's jaw goes a bit slack. He hadn't told a soul about his plans, but of course Bucky could tell. "I— I'm sorry," he says, looking away. He was sorry. It didn't change the facts. He could never make himself move on fast enough to help the world, and Pepper was right, it needed him now. He needed to go away for a while.. maybe right a few of his wrongs, then he could come back.
Steve rolls his eyes and fixes them on Tony. "It's Tony, please. Also how do you two know each other." He glances up at Steve, tightening his grip on Steve's hand.
"Why not?" If there was one thing he knew it was that Peter loved Tony. This just didn't make any sense.
The red skull crashes against a boulder, the breath knocked from his lungs. "I see—ha—you have delved into legend. Well, as have I." He thrusts our a hand, and a column of golden-orange light flies out of it, arcing straight for Steve. He sees himself fall to his knees, and vaguely feels the dull sensation of hitting rock. More important in his mind though, was the feeling that his chest was being crushed. He couldn't breathe, couldn't rise. "Elongated exposure to the soul vortex... well, it has had interesting effects on my capacities." Steve chokes on his tongue, the feeling of it heavy in his mouth. The edges of his vision tint black. With the final shred of his strength, he sends a shooting bolt of lightning towards the red skull. It knocks him away, and all at once he gasps for breath and sends electricity coursing through the Skull's body.
The door swings open and Nat steps in holding a tablet. "Oh. Hi Tony." She holds the tablet tight to her chest. "I thought you would be.... somewhere else. Can I... can we have a second."
Huh? Steve blinks down at the frosting he was working on, hardly hiding the shock on his face. "Did you say four PhDs?" He was pretty glad Tony couldn't see his face right now.
"Not really, but thanks." Tony squeezes Steve's hand reassuringly. "I'm gonna go now." He turns on his heel, pulling Steve after him. Luckily she doesn't chase them down, and Tony doesn't speak another word until they're in the tower. "Sorry about that." He lets out a deep breath. "How about we forget that even happened."
"You're fucking kidding," Tony says, looking over at him with a raised brow. His eyes flicker to Steve's arms, then back to the road. "What, are those fake."
"In return, I think you should really let me put a sign on your ass. Or even just print it on your pants or whatever." Steve lets out a sigh of relief that turns into a laugh.
They had families. They were Steve's family. Then again, he's never been good at dealing with grief. He dealt with the loss of his dad by enlisting in the military more times then what was considered legal. After Bucky fell, he had crashed a plane into the frigid waves of the arctic. Now that Tony and Nat we're gone, he had fled to the past. When his mother had died, he had hurled himself into a series of pointless fights he could never win with people who would never loose against a scrawny asthmatic punk like him. Until finally, Bucky grabbed him by the shirt and told him something he would never forget. "Your ma wouldn't wancha fightin all these wankers who don' deserve it, ya punk." That of course was true.
"Ok, how about nobody argues, and we eat?" Natasha says, a smile on her face that says clearly that she isn't asking.
Tony rolls his eyes. "I can't stand people like that. Like they have the right to pretend like they're helping me by harassing me for no reason." He squeezes Steve's fingers. "I'd rather publish my own statement anyways."
"Rude. Besides, I have my own personal chef boyfriend now, so suck my dick." He gestures to Steve, throwing a wink in at that last part.
Nat takes his hand, pulling him towards their room. "Better get you cleaned up then." He follows, smiling fondly down at her. It wasn't hard to pretend, given that he really did love her. Unquestionably. Once they're in the room, she punches his shoulder. "Fuck, that was violent. Hot too."
"Thank you." He looks down at her, her eyelashes fluttering gently against rosy cheeks. "For everything, I mean." In another life, it could've been her. She might've never felt the same, but he could have fallen in love with her easily. He could still, with enough time. Loosing Tony was less raw now, but Steve loved him as much as he ever had. He never really had to stop loving Tony though, but he knew that if Tony were here, he would tell Steve to go for it, that he deserved to be happy. For all his bravado, Steve knew that deep down Tony just wanted everyone to be happy, and if that was with him or without him, so be it. He liked to pretend to be self centered, but Steve knew very well that it was all an act.
"Boo." Tony clarifies. "Fine. I'll take care of it. Give me a few hours, I'll have the whole thing cleared up."
"Damnit." Tony looks back down at Steve, and his limp body slamming into the rocks. A sob escapes his throat. "No.. please.." Tony squeezes his eyes shut letting the tears fall with reckless abandon. He looks up into the sky opening up above him, lighting up with electricity, power. "Please!" Tony screams, hysterically pleading with the sky. With a blinding flash, Tony feels his body go limp, endless nothing around his bodiless mind, before the universe returns to him.
"So... you're.. companions." She says, with a raised brow. And there was another mask. Natasha pretending she's was interested at socializing with strangers and Peggy pretending she wasn't completely shell shocked with the new news.
"It's been a long night," Steve concedes, taking a sip to have something to do while he tries to straighten his thoughts.
"Oh I absolutely do." Steve sets his phone down on his lap, waiting for it to download. Sure, now he had a TikTok too, but that was excusable, he was sure of it. He only wanted one to see one persons videos. Maybe Peter too, the kid seemed nice enough. "How far is the restaurant?"
Tony makes a little huff against Steve's chest. "Great you're enjoying this. Thought you'd be upset your ex and your boyfriend were getting along so well."
They dial in the coordinates in awkward silence, and Steve is very aware of the redness in his cheeks. He hadn't exactly... meant to kiss her, but it had just felt so right. It felt.. right, like it was meant to be. But is she didn't feel the same way, then he knew far better then to pursue. First of all, his mother raised him better then that. Second of all, even now he was lucky to have all his body parts intact. Third of all, he respected her too much, loved her too much to try shit. So no, that was one thing he wouldn't be pursuing.
Steve woke with a start, coming to that kind of instant, heart-pounding wakefulness that leaves your whole body feeling off kilter.  Everything was wrong, was his first thought, then his mind caught up and he realized he was on Tony’s sofa with his head pillowed on Tony’s lap.  Steve looked up to apologize, and saw Tony’s head lolled to one side, eyes shut, mouth slightly parted in sleep.  He looked young, Steve thought.  Softer, somehow, the usual lines of worry smoothed away by sleep.  Vulnerable in a way that Steve didn't usually associate with Tony, though he knew a lot of what Tony presented was by careful design.  Tony’s hand was halfway through Steve’s hair, as if he’d been in the midst of running it through when he fell asleep.  There was warmth and safety and a strange sense of certainty that flickered through him as he watched Tony sleep.  Steve lay there for a long moment, still and quiet, and let himself bask in the feeling, fleeting though it might be.  Tony was a lot of things, but there was little certain about any of this, Steve was well aware.
Once for trust, once for joy, once for sorrow, once for plenty, once for want and the final binding for forgiveness, for that was one that needed to be closest to love, which tied the knot. It was only when Steve looked down at their bound hands that he caught it, the light, silvery flash buried against the rope, tiny links of chain in a metal that Steve knew already bound them.  His breath caught in his throat, the sudden hitch catching Tony’s attention.
Tony, make him his. Maybe that should have bothered Tony.  When he thought about it, he felt like it should, but instead…God, he’d never felt more powerful than those moments when Steve would walk, slowly, deliberately, across the room, his eyes boring into Tony’s, everything signaling this carefully-contained control that was this close to snapping, and all because of Tony.  All of that, that power, that strength, that energy, all of it belonged to Tony.   It was intoxicating.  Exhilarating.
“So, I’m guessing the answer is something less than decades, then,” Steve said, giving Tony a speculative look.
“St—Steve,” Tony stammered, mindless, overcome.  It was too strange, too good, too much, and not nearly enough.  Steve pulled his mouth off, and smiled up at Tony. His hand came up from Tony’s hip and rolled the other nipple between his fingers, then flicked at it.  Tony jumped, then moaned as Steve’s mouth closed over the stinging peak. He suckled at it, sending shooting, throbbing bursts of bright, hot need down the length of Tony’s cock.  Tony’s flesh pebbled and burned. He was on fire. He was drowning. He didn’t know. This was Pleasures, surely. It must be what Steve meant.
"How.. how are you here?" He holds up his hand for mjølnir, his eyes widening when Steve twists as it flies out of his hand. "What?"
His thirst momentarily sated, Steve looked out towards the sea from underneath the makeshift lean-to he had constructed out of what few materials to be found on the island and the bits of wreckage that the creature brought up from the deep.  Wind-swept waves were glancing over the shore under a clear, blue sky and empty horizon. He couldn’t spy the creature from here, but he knew it was there, likely waiting in its usual spot for Steve to come down for his morning swim, a habit he had gotten into after waking up itching from whatever it was in the sand that first night.  Since then, he had managed to make a bedding of some of the larger leaves he pulled from the trees packed over a soft, sandy clump of sand, but he still looked forward to the routine of rinsing off in the morning and talking to, or at least talking
Steve braced his forearm against the glass and stared down at the red moon. Finally, he turned, his body rigid and his strange, marble-blue eyes downcast. “I thought...I thought I would have more time, but...that is not to be. I will take you back to Terra, Tony Stark, as I promised.”
Peggy’s grip tightened on his arm, and she shot him a questioning look.  Steve realized his whole body had tensed, and tried to force himself to relax, though to little avail.
“You’re not weak, Tony. For God’s sake, you’re one of the strongest people I’ve ever met,” Steve cut in sharply.
“Yes. Definitely. Yes.  Very excited to get home.  I had Happy go feed our fish.  Don’t give me that look.  You’re the one who went and named them.  Wait. We’re using ‘go home’ as some kind of euphemism, right?” Tony asked, sitting up abruptly.  “Because, honestly, if we don’t—“ Tony broke off with what he thought was a very manly squeak as Steve lifted him onto his lap and ducked his head to capture Tony’s mouth.  “Emjussayin,” Tony mumbled into Steve’s lips, feeling them curve into a smile.  Steve brought his hand up and settled it onto the back of Tony’s neck, pushing just hard enough for the pressure to burn a path down to the tip of Tony’s already half-hard cock.
“Clint, don’t be an idiot,” Natasha ground out, spreading her arms wide to indicate the watermelon-covered floor.  “Steve could slip,” she pointed out.  Then frowned and shook her head.  “Wait, that’s not—what I meant was—this was a terrible idea for a lot of reasons, wholly unrelated to Steve.  None of which I seem able to think of right now, but I’m sure there are many, many other reasons.”
“Tony,” Obie said, shaking his head as he knelt down next to the sofa.  “When I ordered the hit on you, I worried that I was killing the golden goose.  But, you see, it was just fate that you survived that. You had one last golden egg to give,” he grinned, almost placatingly as he loomed over Tony.  “Do you really think just because you have an idea, it belongs to you?” He pulled some kind of pincer-like device out of a case on his lap and held it up in front of Tony’s face.  “Your father, he helped give us the atomic bomb. They tested it right outside the city. Did you know that? You can take a tour now with one of those little headsets,” he added, stopping for a moment and looking down at Tony.  “Now, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you?” he hummed in question, then pointed the device at Tony’s chest, just over the reactor and pushed it in.
“How did you even get around the parental controls to find me?  Anyway, you could, but you don’t,” Kirk said.  “You have what you think of as your ‘good clothes’ hanging up over there on the back of the bathroom door.  Two all black suits, which you alternate for work.  They’re the only ones that you bothered to iron. Which leaves…two plaid shirts, a corduroy jacket and three pairs of khakis stacked up on your dresser along with assorted t-shirts and your winter coat, one of those Southface things they sell out of the back of an old minivan down near Chinatown.  Yeah, you’re single.  How are you single?  Have you seen you? Though, you’re obviously friendless and emotionally stunted.  I’d still fuck you, though. Not really one to judge on those things.”
“How…how did he die?” Tony asked carefully.  He toed at the flecks of gravel under his shoe and watched the sand and dust float through the car’s headlights.  “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t…it isn’t my business.  You don’t have to talk about it.”
He should tell him.   There was a ghost in a computer who told Steve lies that held too much truth when he finally decided to look. He needed to tell Tony. Not here.  Not now, with the fallout from Lagos to deal with, and Tony’s walk down create-a-memory lane, but soon.  The possibility that he was wrong had long ago worn down to hope and now…now, he was probably approaching self-delusion.
“Maybe I could make it easier to believe?” Steve offered.  “I’d like to try.  I mean, I have a lot to work on.  About myself.  But,” he stopped, tugging Tony to a halt and around to face him.  “I’d really like to try.”
Steve moved to the countertop area that served as a kitchenette and took two mugs out of one of the cabinets, then looked inside them and put one back, pulling out another. He rummaged through the shelves a bit, then looked at the coffee machine as if it had offended him, a deep furrow appearing between his eyes.
If any of them could have, it would have been Tony. But, Tony was gone, and everyone kept looking at Steve.   I can’t do this alone, he wanted to shout at them, but he couldn’t, so he had offered to do it alone, anyway.  And now, he was here, alone in a way he hadn’t been before, when the future was terrifying and awful, but limitless and wonderful, too. If this didn’t work, he wasn’t sure he could handle doing this all over again, not when the future held nothing but a bleak emptiness.
“Sure,” Stark said easily.  “I mean, there may be the occasional squabble over who ate the last Pop-Tart. Spoiler alert, it was Barton.  And movie night.  Ugh, don’t get me started on how many times we had to watch Harry and the Hendersons.  God, that movie, I can quote it backwards.  But, are you really going to say no to the alien demigod?  I don’t think so.”
Which just figured, didn’t it? Virtually every interaction with Stark since the beginning left Steve feeling twisted into some kind of ridiculous position, tongue-tied and torn between being mortified at himself for letting Stark get to him and angry at Stark for being…well, so very
To be fair, that was probably because they were celebrating a windfall that wasn’t going to happen, and he was the only one who knew that.  God, Brock was going to be pissed.  Even more now, because he would feel humiliated since he had already told his friends about their ‘good luck’ in Vegas.
“Stay away from the Ul and his people, will you?” Tony requested in a clipped voice. “They are not to be trusted.”
, not to get to him, but he was always there, wasn’t he?  Only he hadn’t known, not really.  How could he? Why didn’t you tell me, he beseeched someone who would never hear him, though he wondered if he really wanted that answer.  “Right, Tony?  You tell him all these stories about Cap, what’d you expect? Wants to help.  Be a hero. All that stuff.  Eh, kiddo? Be a helluva thing, finding Captain America, wouldn’t it? Bet that’d show ‘em back at school.”
Steve looked over at the fountain again, then back at the doors.  He blinked.  There.  Light danced across the opening barely splintering the shadows, but he could see the edges of it.  Light that hadn’t been there just a moment ago.
Tony pushed himself up off the floor and brushed off his slacks, straightening his jacket and running a finger through his hair while his mind fought for some kind of purchase, thoughts scrabbling around like they couldn't find a place to settle.
Anthony deserved someone who didn’t bring a lifetime’s worth of baggage with him. Someone who could get through the day without resorting to bullshit fantasies because those were the only times he could let himself feel anything, when he knew it wasn’t real.  Someone who didn’t wake up screaming at night, choking on water so cold it froze his throat. Anthony needed someone who could take care of him, and Steve could barely take care of himself. He knew that.
The hairs on the back of his neck were standing up, and gooseflesh dimpled his skin.  This was wrong.  Everything about this.  Tony was fully awake now, his heartbeat rabbiting in his chest.  Everything felt off.  He could feel his anxiety ratcheting up with each beat while he waited.  There was a part of him that didn’t want Steve to open the door, wanted to do what Steve suggested and go back to bed, because knowing things meant having to deal with things.  And this…well.  He suspected this was something that needed dealing with.
“I know,” Tony said, his expression flicking with a terrible sort of resignation before it shuttered.  “Let us not pretend, not with each other, not anymore.  I know that this,” Tony said, reaching up and tracing the underside of the collar around Steve’s throat with the pad of his finger, “Chafes at you.  You are not a man meant to be ruled.  Do you think me blind to that?” Tony asked with a low chuckle at what must have been surprise flickering across Steve’s face. “Perhaps at first, yes, before I knew you better, I admit.  I know that this is not what you wanted or what you planned.  A part of you will always rail against it.  I thought I didn’t want that, that I wanted to rid you of that, but it’s the same part of you that places yourself in front of Cam.  It’s the same part of you that comes to me with truths I don’t want to hear when it would be far easier to turn a blind eye, as so many others must have over the years.  It’s the same part of you that comes up with ways to strengthen the very walls that hold you here because it is safer for the other people behind them. I can’t take that away from you.  I wouldn’t, even if I could.”
Finding Brock had been a bit like grabbing an anchor in a storm, something to hold onto in all the chaos.  Brock was familiar and easy, and they shared so much history after two tours together, it just made sense, no matter what Bucky said.  It wasn’t like Brock outranked him anymore.  Besides, even when he had, Steve liked to think there had been a certain bond there, at least as soldiers, even if they had their share of friction.  Who didn’t have friction over there, given everything they were dealing with?  Heck, just about everyone in his unit had some kind of run-in with a fellow soldier at some point.
He lays back against the rock and looks up at the expansive blue of an endless sky framed by trees and buildings alike. This was good.
The resounding slap to his face echoes and his eyes snap open, and he scrambles back, eyes darting between Steve and Natasha. "W—Captain America? Am I dead? Oh my god, I died."
"Maybe this time." Tony pauses, but the fear in his virtual eyes is visible. His voice is hopeful, nearly pleading.
"No problem, Stevie, doll." She was the most beautiful woman Steve knew, her hair the color of dark chocolate, and eyes the same bright blue as Bucky's. Their whole family was pretty in every sense of the word, although Becca and Mr. Barnes were somewhat more subdued. "How's school goin?"
"To be honest, I have no idea. In the future, they have these DNA tests, but I've never taken one because I'm afraid that they'll sell it to the highest bidder and someone will try to re make the serum." Tony shifts in his arms, and Steve tries not to cry. Here was his friend, his teammate, his love; dead, yet just now alive.
A woman sets a hand on his shoulder. "I'll show you." She leads him out to a spot near the unset banquet tables, draped in the same gold cloth. Across the room, Steve spots Tony, but he doesn't see the bride anywhere yet. "There. It's pretty, isn't it. You did a great job." She compliments, patting his arm.
"I'm glad to do it." Steve rubs his arm. "You can count on me, Bruce," he says, smiling a smile that doesn't reach his eyes.
He takes a step forward, leaning his hip on the counter. "Long story short, I'm from the year 2023. Me and my companion Natasha are traveling back through time to return some powerful stones we borrowed to be used in our time, one of which included something hidden in the tesseract. Now we're here to.. to right some wrongs."
"Oh time travelers! Wonderful. What year are you from?" Thor says, making a brisk pace that Steve can feel Nat struggling to keep.
Fucking wrong. They make it as far as Germany before running into the unfortunate blockade known infamously as the iron curtain. They try to get past, citing their Russian personalities and affiliations with the KGB. Then they get thrown in prison. Try having a ridiculously high metabolism in a fucking soviet prison. Then try your best friend having the same thing. By day 3, Steve is running a fever for the first time since 1943. Nat was still a little mad at him, but not so mad that she wasn't sitting next to him every moment of the day, holding his hand and feeding him the few rations they got. Bucky wasn't in as bad of a shape, thank god, but even he was bed ridden with a headache. On day 6, Steve starts vomiting. Yes, you're right, that is very counterproductive for a man who's sick because he lacks nutrients.
“Well, that’s one way to put it,” Tony said with a rough bark of laughter.  “I’ll have to tell Rhodey.  I’m not making an ass out of myself, I’m just being
Malcolm and Dominic were looking back and forth between each other and Steve and Tony, torn between confusion, hope and terror.
“If I tell you, it will ruin the surprise. Off with you, now,” Tony said, turning to watch the boy race out of the door.
“You look good, too,” Steve replied, since that seemed easy enough to say and had the benefit of being true.  Tony smiled, eyes drooping shut and curled in on himself a bit.
“God, is he going to get like this every time you get near a Heat?” Clint asked in what Tony felt was a bit of exaggerated exasperation.  “I saw your memo, Tony.   I saw it, because you taped it inside the fucking
Steve followed, with Cam trailing behind him, his head down, eyes focused on the ground as he walked. He could practically hear the boy’s internal diatribe building up inside of him like a bubble waiting to burst. Steve nodded to Josiah and Peran, and noticed that the tent was ringed by others he recognized from Tony’s personal guard, along with a few of Lord Murdock’s soldiers. Taking no chances, even amongst so-called friends, Steve thought, once again feeling grateful for Rhodes’ careful attention to detail.
The camera swiveled and caught on Peggy, sitting in one of those wooden-slatted chairs that was anchored to the boat dock where it jutted out over the water.  Behind her, a large speedboat bobbed gently with the waves, and Steve could just make out the A-lined roof of a house perched on a rocky shore.  Her hair was tucked under a wide-brimmed straw hat and dark, squared-off sunglasses took up much of her face, but she was easy enough to recognize.  Tony’s mother sat next to her in a flowing, floral sundress with a blue scarf wrapped around her head to try to combat the wind where it whipped across the lake.
Tony slathered the gathering fluid over the head of Steve’s cock.  The friction was exquisite torture.  Too much sensation and not nearly enough.  Tony’s hand left Steve’s cock for a moment, and Steve cried out at the absence, but it was back again soon enough, this time coated with a slick, viscous oil.  Not warm this time, as he was used to, but warm enough in Tony’s hand as he wrapped it around Steve’s cock and gave it a strong, hard stroke.
“It left a question in my mind,” Steve said with a slight shrug of his shoulders. Tony’s gaze seemed to have an almost solid pressure to it as he studied him, but Steve returned it steadily enough.  He wondered briefly what it was that Stark saw when he looked at him.  An unfortunate complication, probably.  Something to be handled, the way they’d all handled him up there earlier.  Say this, don’t say that, wear this, go here, smile.  Giving the paying customers what they wanted was familiar enough by now, at least.  It didn’t sting quite the way it once had, being an object, some moveable piece they didn’t really have to deal with.  Except…except there was that moment, that brief span of a single look, where Tony had seemed to actually look at him and see some
“Huh?” Tony groped for words, gaze wandering around the tableau in front of him. “I—no. No. Wait, yes. I--”
“I know,” Tony said.  Steve was fidgeting next to him.  Tony reached out and covered Steve’s hand with his own where Steve had been tapping out a nervous rhythm against his thigh.  Steve’s motions slowed, then stopped, and he glanced over at Tony with a grateful look.  Tony gave his hand a light squeeze, and to his surprise, felt Steve’s fingers interlace with his own.
“Yeah,” Steve replied with an easy smile.  Tony could see some of the tension leaking out of Steve’s shoulders, which made the tightness in his own muscles slowly start to ease.  “You’d like their R&D division.  I’ll have to take you for a tour one of these days.”
“Las Vegas has about fifty standalone wedding chapels.  Then a few in hotels and restaurants. One in a KISS-themed Mini Golf,” she told him.
“Right,” Steve agreed.  Brock sat down next to him, leaned in and kissed him.  It wasn’t a great kiss or even really a good kiss, though probably that was on him, since he just sort of sat there, letting it happen without managing to muster much of a response.  Brock didn’t seem to notice.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, I didn’t pick the names, Howard,” Peggy replied affectionately, holding up a placating hand. A small smile played on her lips, and she cast a quick look at the camera.  Or at the man behind the camera, more likely, but it hit Steve between the eyes, the way it always did with her, like getting to peak behind a curtain and finding the Great and Powerful was even more amazing.
The sounds of clothes being removed followed.  Heavy thuds of boots cast aside.  The slide of cloth against skin.  The soft swish of fabric hitting the floor.  The bed dipped, though Steve kept his eyes down.  It was easier that way for some reason.  He heard Tony sigh, and felt the stroke of a hand over his back, up and down the ridges of his spine to just above the length of chain that wound around his waist.
“I programmed the neural translator while you rested.  It took a bit of doing. Our languages are very different,” the alien explained.
“Steve…” Tony breathed out.  “Oh, God.  Shouldn’t he be, like, not awake for this?” Tony demanded, looking first over his shoulder at Coulson, then at the doctor sitting down by Steve’s head where a large machine with dials and pumps sat idle.
Dominoes, Tony thought. One of those intricate, uselessly fascinating creations of them, where one falls over and eventually, they all succumb to that one, tiny bit of force, changing everything. He tossed a glance to Rhodey, who just raised a speculative eyebrow.
“Oh, good, there you are.  I thought I’d have to separate you two after the way you were making eyes at each other over breakfast,” Pepper said as she exited the suite’s elevator.
“And why, exactly, should it be me?  Hmmm?  Do tell,” Natasha asked, coming to stand in front of Tony with her arms crossed over her chest.
“Tony,” Steve said in a long, low moan that drew out the word until it was almost unintelligible, just a plea, really, for more, for whatever it was that Tony would give him.  He couldn’t get his head to focus on anything, and then it would seem to latch on to one thing and hang there, unable to let go. The way Tony’s hair fell across his forehead.  How his hands on the back of Steve’s neck felt rough from countless hours in his workshop.  How he smelled like berries and sweat and a hint of smoke and earth.
“That, as a rule, whatever came out of your body, you got to call it whatever you want,” Tony recited. Admittedly, this was an annoyingly fair rule, but he just really liked the sound of Steve’s name, and there was already the Steve Zone practically established. He just needed a few visual aids, maybe a PowerPoint…definitely a memo of some kind. Everyone really seemed to respond really well to those.
So, yeah, just your basic mission, Steve thought with a grim sigh.  No different than any other day ending in Y.
A hard expression flickered over Brock’s face, and for a second, Steve thought he was going to argue, but then it was gone, and Brock smiled indulgently at him.  “Yeah,” Brock agreed, glancing up at the waitress. “Real sorry.” He smiled, then rolled his eyes and shook his head at Steve. “What’d he call you last night?  Boy scout, that’s it,” he added with mock accusation.  “He had you pegged from the get-go, that’s for sure. Boy Scout,” he repeated with a pleased laugh. “That’s you, man. That’s definitely you.”
“You know, it occurs to me that we may never be presented with this opportunity again,” Tony observed, setting the shrink ray down next to where Steve was sitting. “Not that I don’t love how you look all serumed-up, but…” Tony trailed off, letting the suggestion hang in the air.
“Good,” he said after a long pause.  He opened his eyes and looked at Anto.  Anto was almost used to the man’s directness by now, but it still caught him by surprise sometimes, like now, the openness in the man’s face.  His eyes were wide and dark, the color of the sky before a storm, Anto thought to himself, his hair was sticking up and plastered with sweat that clung to his brow, and his gaze was rapt, focused on Anto in a way that made something warm open up deep inside Anto’s belly.
Anto sighed and swiped his hand at the corners of his eyes. They were leaking again. Weak eyes. He hated them sometimes. “Steve need,” he said, pointing at Steve’s groin for emphasis.  “Tony there. Steve no signal. Tony big and ugly. Big, ugly, stupid Omega.”
“No idea,” Cam shrugged.  “But, he went directly to the King when he returned without even changing his garb from the ride.  Oh, and she said he spoke to Admiral Carmichael about raiders and not being able to find enough drink or something.  Erdé was there, picking up the laundry, and heard part of it.”
The dealer drew the top card and set it down at the end of the line of cards in front of Tony.  A nine. He was out. Steve winced and frowned, looking over at Tony, who seemed completely unbothered.
The van hit a pothole and Tony’s world lurched.  He squeezed his eyes shut against the slam of pain in his head at the motion, then twisted to one side again.  Stretching out a finger, he held it to the face of his watch long enough for the system to scan his fingerprint, then tapped it three times.  The hand repulsor leapt out, and he used his finger to drag it over the back of his hand.  There wasn’t really a great way to do this with his hands bound, but, he had to try.  He used his feet as leverage and pushed himself up to a sitting position, with his bound hands facing the door, glanced over his shoulder once to check his aim, took a breath and—
“Wait. What? You signed that to get me my tuition back?” Tony asked, voice going thin, head tilting to one side as he watched Steve's always expressive face, which answered for him. “You signed it to get me my tuition back.
Steve’s insides squirmed.  Brock’s words hit too close to the mark, and Steve couldn’t help remembering what it had been like to wake up to an empty bed, an empty suite, and feel… used.  That was utterly unfair, Steve knew, because Tony had kept his side of the bargain just fine.  Still, it was hard to shake the feeling, even if his mind told him he was being an idiot, and Brock zeroing in on exactly what was bothering Steve certainly didn’t help.
Tony made a non-committal sound, chewing a bit on his lip, though he didn’t challenge that explanation, for which Steve was rather grateful.  Mentioning Brock, even obliquely, felt incredibly awkward.
“I’m so, so sorry. Really, I—this wasn’t my idea. I mean, I know that isn’t your fault, but I didn’t—I told him not to—I thought he was kidding!” the man blurted out, finally letting his nervous gaze fall on Tony. “I didn’t think he’d actually go through with it. I don’t even know how he found someone like you---I mean. That. That didn’t come out right,” the man amended quickly when Tony’s head canted back in question. “Look, I have…I can give you cab fare?” the man said, digging into his pocket for a worn brown leather wallet that looked like it had once carried Continental currency. “If that would help? This isn’t the best neighborhood.”
“Takes a long time to get to England in a rowboat, though,” Steve put in, making Tony have to cover his mouth to keep from probably getting into a literal dick measuring contest with Barnes.
Even the hard parts were easy.  He wasn’t sure it was supposed to be like that, but he had an answer if someone asked him what made him happy, and he couldn’t make himself pick it apart just because they weren’t broken when they were together and neither of them knew what to do with that.
The Accords.  They’re sending them somewhere, the pieces that were left on the board.  A test.  A trial balloon to see who would balk.  Who would be in
“Did you kill all the bad people because I had a cold?” Tony asked, then sniffed and scrunched his nose up. “Wow.  Every have one of those my-life-is-weird moments?”
“I am not tired,” Steve replied.  He knew the words for a lie as soon as he said them.  He was exhausted.  His head pounded.  His muscles ached with tension.  He wanted nothing more than to curl up in bed and wrap himself around Tony for the night and probably the day after, but he knew, looking at Tony, that this was not going to happen.  Already, what energy had seemed to leech out of Tony as the horror of it all dawned on him was returning.  Steve could see it in the set of Tony’s mouth, the way his eyes roved around the room, and the way his hands moved, tapping at his chest and clicking together, as if his body needed to release some of the momentum of his mind.
“You’re back!” Cam’s voice announced from behind him.  “Isn’t it great?  It came this morning.  Are you going to paint me?  Can you paint me as a knight?  I should like that, I think.  There’s food, if you’re hungry.  Should I call for a bath?”
.  Tony could’ve said the same things to himself a thousand times and they wouldn’t have meant as much as hearing his own vindication fall from Steve’s lips.
“Me?” Anto said, staring in fascination at the stone figure. “For me?” he asked, pointing at the amulet.
“You’re weird,” Steve observed, scrunching his face up, then sighing with heavy exaggeration.  “But, don’t worry.  I guess you’re
I don’t want to, he thought, feeling a bit sick with the admission. I want them to hurt.  I want them to be afraid.  I don’t want to always be the one who is magnanimous.  Who forgives.
“Well, funny story,” Tony began.  “This guy,” he said, pointing at Steve.  “Is my husband,” Tony explained, splaying his hands wide as he turned in his seat a bit.  “But, he has this insane idea that I’ll up and decide I’m too much of a pretentious douche to love this great guy who happens to love me back.  I’m winning him over, though.  Slow going, at the moment, I’ll admit, but we have checks with both our names on it and that’s, like, practically a binding, legal document.  Ferengi Sixteenth Rule of Acquisition, a deal is a deal.  It’s a thing.”
“Okay,” Steve said quickly, stepping around behind Tony so that he blocked the water.  “I didn’t know. I’m sorry, Tony. I wouldn’t have pulled you in here, if I’d known. I should’ve asked.”
“Too late.  Did that at MIT.  Now, I’m stuck with his clingy ass,” Tony said, smiling widely.  “I did find out he was Special Forces. And, get this, we met him in Bagram.  I hit on him.  Try to contain your shock.  But, even more interesting, it was his squad originally assigned to my protection detail for the missile test, but they got pulled at the last minute.  He seemed to think it was weird.  Not the usual SOP.”
“I would know that what you felt when you first found yourself here—that despair you described—that it no longer has hold of you,” Tony whispered, breath warm across Steve’s lips.
“We could all benefit from more of that, I would think,” Tony agreed, his voice soft and filled with something that Steve couldn’t quite name. “As difficult as it may be at times to hear.”
Honestly, it didn’t really matter if Tony saw it or not, did it?  It wasn’t like this gesture was really going to change anything, other than make Steve feel a bit better about the whole thing.  The point was,
Tony heard Steve’s door click open and looked up. Steve disappeared inside, then turned around and looked out at him through the opening with an expression caught between confusion and disbelief.
Tony drew in a shuddering breath, then released his hold on Steve’s cock, making a clicking noise in his throat as he did.  Distantly, Steve heard the thud of his boots hit the floor and felt the rush of air on his thighs as his breeches were pulled off.  Naked now, he pushed himself onto his elbows as he felt the mattress dip beneath him with Tony’s weight.
“Come.  Have some sherry with your mother and leave this rabble to their Scotch and cigars,” Maria urged, rising from the table.  Tony dabbed at the corners of his mouth with his napkin and stood up to follow her.  He could feel Steve watch him go, but when he turned to look back, Steve was answering Obie’s question about the Army’s contract review process with a detailed precision that was probably what led Howard to call for more to drink.
“I do not believe I am owed what I want to hear at this point,” Tony replied.  He drew away and regarded Steve with a grim determination.  “Tell me what you must.”
“Our clients’ needs are attended to for the entire visit,” the man said, shooting Steve an affronted look. “It’s part of the package.”
Was he really going to do this? He pulled the baseball cap lower over his face and hiked up his jacket collar, looking up and down the alleyway. It seemed deserted, save for a few homeless people standing around a barrel and a city bus lumbering by a couple of blocks to the right. There were a lot of rusted cars and parts off to one side, and he could hear a dog’s occasional bark from there, though it never appeared from its hiding place. It was oddly disconcerting, feeling this alone, even on the outskirts of the city. He had no reason to think this was some elaborate trap, not when Tony suggested it in the first place, but he couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched now that he was here.
Steve chuckles. "His name is Tony." Tony holds up his own left hand to prove it. Betty squeals again.
"Bummer. Guess I'll have to settle for you," Steve deadpans, pulling Tony up in to an easier position for him to kiss. Tony responds enthusiastically, setting his arms easily around Steve's shoulders. "It's ok, you're pretty alright," Steve mutters before he goes right back to kissing. Tony can't reprimand him if he can't get a word in edgewise, after all.
Tony eases his way onto the bed, wincing slightly as he tilts his body towards Steve, then readjusting. He just looks concerned. Well, as Tony would rather him say, sexy and concerned, but still concerned. "What's wrong?" Tony reaches for his hand, eyes flickering to the tablet.
"Hi Sam. It's nice to meet you," Tony says with a good natured smile, clearly finding this somewhat painful.
Steve shrugs against him. "Honestly they tried to explain it, but I don't think they really know either. My best guess is the serum, or maybe even the soul stone."
What a weird ass situation. "I don't know." Seriously, Steve didn't have young people in his life that he was in charge of, and least of all did he have kids who hid freakin bracelets in their school bags. "Do you want me to call him?"
Tony hooks the finger pointed at Steve's chest into his tie, pulling it with just enough pressure for him to feel it. "No, not any more," he says low and quiet.
Steve rests his arm around her shoulders. "Well, I don't think we should be here when Thor gets back. I also don't particularly want you traveling yet."
"I.. she... she found something." Steve tangles their fingers together. "It's... you should... ok, if I have video evidence of bad news, would you rather hear it, or watch the video first?"
On his pages there were two drawings, one of Stark Tower peeking through the skyline and one of a wedding cake for Sam and Bucky. He would have to battle Nat for the rights to making the cake, but damnit, he had to be able to hold his ground against her at least once in his life.
There were always people who criticized the actions of the Avengers. There would always be those people. To some, they seemed more like a government agency than anything, which was rather untrue. The government hated Tony, and it wanted to lock Bruce up. Thor had nothing to do with America. Nat and Clint worked for the government, yes, but that wasn't public knowledge. Yet, looking at Steve, at his suit, his shield, all people could see was America. When he had first donned the suit for battle, it had been a monicker he had worn with pride. All these years later, it seemed more like a burden than anything else.
Allrighty. Whewh. So um.. my original intent for this fic included Steve dying on Vormir, and Tony following suit at the Battle for the Universe. Obviously that didn’t happen, because apparently I don’t know how to write anything with an unhappy ending. So if you liked this, say thanks to my monkey brain lol. Comments and Kudos are always appreciated 😊
Steve turns on the lights, the whole shop flickering to life, an air in his step that he hadn't felt in a long time. "She's going to kill me for not telling her sooner."
He nods, pouting at her. She sets him down in the crib, swiping her thumb on his cheek. "You ready?"
Steve pulls back, a real smile on his face through the tears. "Of course you do. You're a smart kid, Morgan." As smart as Tony. She looked like him too. Steve's chest aches with the need to protect her, but that wasn't his job. She needed her mother, Happy, Rhodey. Not a broken hundred old man who's lost everyone he's ever known multiple times. "Smart like your daddy," he adds, then let's go of her, seeing Pepper's heels looming next to him.
Steve rubs his eyes, groaning quietly. It was his own fault he slept so poorly anyways. Couldn't just stop overthinking everything. To find Pepper or not to find Pepper. Was Tony even a cheater. Who kissed who. Was it his place to meddle. How was he supposed to make this cake under these circumstances. He and Nat were the only ones allowed to make wedding cakes, being the only ones with any actual training. His shag carpet is soft against his bare feet as he trudged towards the kitchen, pulling a pair of sweatpants on on his way to his bedroom door.
God damn it. Steve blinks at Tony, but far be it from his capabilities to say no, so he sits down, a smile toying on his lips. Steve sinks into the chair, unable to stop himself from leaning against the table, smiling over at the beautiful man in front of him. "If I didn't know better, I'd almost think you were flirting." Oh no. Oh god. Oh no. Shit, he just doesn't know when to shut the hell up. Did every ounce of sense leave his body? Why the ever loving fuck would he say that out loud. Steve's eyes widen in fears she goes to apologize.
The recovery process was long, in the way that things always seem to be. Unfortunately, it seems the world can wait no longer when they receive news of a massive fire monster attacking the city of Prague, and Spider-Man being the only one fighting it, along with some guy Tony doesn't know, and doesn't like already. Nobody hangs out with his underoos. They hold a press conference in Wakanda on July 2nd, both Steve and Tony's matching arms and rings on full display as they reveal that neither heroes had died and that both were retiring.
