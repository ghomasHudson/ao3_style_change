“It’s ok,” he whispered to the super soldier.  I’ll take care of everything.  I wish you’d let me in on this, though, honey,” he added in a pained voice.  Steve stayed silent.
Evil bases are funny things.  They have VERY good security (it’s how he caught the Witch out after Ultron), and the footage would give high definition detail of Steve’s COMPLETE and total lack of reaction to Howard Stark (Steve’s great friend!) having his face bashed in, and his dying plea completely ignored by the murdering assassin in favor of choking Howard’s beloved wife out.
“Oh, something like that,” Steve smirked.  “You are in a hospital bed, but let’s not quibble.  I’d have you strapped down regardless,” and Steve tightened his fingers into a hold on Tony’s hair.
“I didn’t know it was him,” he conceded, but he didn’t bother with any emotion at all at this point.  It was too late for that.
Steve was unavailable for long stretches of time now.  In fact, when the whole Mandarin thing happened, not only did Steve ignore Tony’s increasingly frantic calls, he wasn’t even aware that Tony had been declared missing (dead) until months after the whole thing was resolved.  Rhodey’s and Pepper’s looks at the First Avenger were getting increasingly dark.
If you could pass it on to T’Challa, I’ve also decided to put synthetic vibranium on the market this Fall.  The fabricating possibilities are limitless.  Why, very soon, it will be like the WHOLE world is benefitting from vibranium (what a novel concept—and all from the mind of a colonizer!).  His highness might be a little concerned at the SUBSTANTIAL loss in revenue, but I’m sure he’ll be distracted as he concentrates on de-programming your new boyfriend, Barnes.  The BARF could already do that, of course, but I’m sure that the genius princess of Wakanda will think of something in the next few years . . . or eventually (let’s be realistic, medical testing takes time, genius or not).
Tony shrugged before following Steve into the kitchen, making sure to stay a foot or two behind. Steve entered the kitchen, walking to the island before leaning against it. Tony stopped at the threshold of the entrance to the kitchen, leaning against the archway with his arms crossed.
Tony rolled his eyes as he pushed himself away from the table, approaching Steve. “It’s called style, Rogers. Who doesn’t want to look good while also saving the planet? You and Banner have poor taste.”
. Tony thought to himself again as he plopped his head into his hands. But before he could feel more miserable, Tony felt a hand on his shoulder. Mustering up enough sensibility to not appear like a love-sick fool, he turned around to greet Steve.
Steve felt terrible that their relationship had gotten to this boiling point. He cared about Tony, and that was before anything he was feeling romantically. He wished they could get back to working as a team.
Steve groaned, wallowing in pain and embarrassment, as he laid back down in the bed, rolling from side to side.
Steve took a deep breath as he entered the lobby. He looked around at the people rushing in and out of the building, almost bumping into a woman who was talking on her phone while checking her watch. Steve managed to maneuver around another stranger as he walked up to the security desk.
As Steve relayed the details of Bucky’s move-in, Tony drowned his voice out. He thought maybe he should interject and ask Steve to move in with him, but he didn’t want to look desperate. Besides, they just started seeing each other and would Steve even want to move in with him? Yet, he knew thinking about Steve and Bucky living together would only make him miserable. Just hearing about it was already twisting his heart apart.
Something about Sam’s last comment made Tony feel emotional again, just as emotional the day he broke up with Steve. He nodded, not really sure what to add.
As Steve walked through the lobby of his suite’s building, he thought about the conversation he had with Bruce about Tony after the first failed simulation run-through with the Synergy device. During their conversation, Bruce hadn’t mentioned anything specific to him, but Steve did remember that Bruce had tried to explain that Tony had been dealing with a lot and Steve just needed to be patient with him.
Tony could sense that Steve was waiting to respond. “That’s understandable, Tony. It’s normal to regret something like that especially when it’s connected to a traumatic event…” Steve finally contributed.
“I can pick you up from your place then we can take Peter over to May’s.” Tony finished, dizzy from the kiss.
As low vibrations from background music emanated from around the stage, Tony did a little shimmy as he waited for the applause to die down, which showed no signs of ceasing considering how psyched the audience appeared. As Tony waited, smiling like he usually did during such events, the word “Synergy” flashed in giant letters behind him as a presentation similar to the one Fury had given the team their orientation day began to play.
“As long as you’re honest and cooperative this time, Loki. What happened in the lab cannot happen again, understood?”
A group of scientists were standing in front of their colleague who harangued them for the latest mishap. The disgruntled scientist waved his arms about in a fit of frustration.
“…did…I ever tell you about the last conversation I had with my mother before she died?” Steve added as Tony agonized over faded memories.
However, suddenly, as he attempted to refocus on his work, Tony felt a dull pain in his chest, halting for a moment to calm himself down.
Tony nodded, but then hung his head low. He could feel Steve inching closer toward him, but not too close.
“Hey, uh, Tony was here while you were out…” Bucky informed Steve as he placed his cup on the counter before meeting Steve out in the living room.
Tony leaned forward with another moan. He placed one hand on Steve’s chest as he continued to touch himself.
The comment made Steve’s face flush even more. Tony laughed as he patted him on the arm before turning around to look at projection of the uniform.
Steve looked downward before looking up at Tony; his smile was half shy, half intrigued. “Tony, you just gave me an important assignment and that’s all you can think about?”
Steve crouched down near the device as he readied himself. He had done this so many times that it finally felt like second nature to him, but obviously he couldn’t concentrate as well since he was so focused on the past weekend and Tony’s current behavior.
Tony stared at Steve for a minute longer before pushing himself away from the table. Steve watched him walk over to one of the consoles.
Both Bruce and Thor nodded at Tony. The three of them were sitting in the back of the mobile lab. After addressing Bruce and Thor, Tony took his time joining Steve in the passenger seat. He motioned toward the scene as Steve drove nearer.
It was obvious that Bruce hadn’t appreciate the comment; Tony watched his friend’s face contort into a look of serious concern.
Tony looked at Bucky and nodded. On top of still feeling hurt that Steve probably wasn’t into him like he had thought, now he was feeling a tinge of jealousy brought on by Bucky’s otherwise straightforward statement. He had gotten to know Steve pretty well since launching Synergy, but that would never seemingly compare with his relationship with Bucky. And something about it irked Tony.
“No, Tony,” Steve shook his head again, “I’m just not ready to be in a relationship right now…I told her that…”
Gamora unexpectedly flinched in time with the flash of light that her safety goggles barely shielded her eyes against. Yet, as her vision gradually recovered, she could hear her father laughing manically before speaking to her sister.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Because, Tony, I don’t want you to have to do everything for me. Or anything…I’m not taking advantage of you.”
Tony finally turned to face Steve. Steve could tell from his facial expression that he was internally struggling with something.
Fury walked to the front of the room. “Okay, first, I’ll need the team at S.H.E.I.L.D. for some debriefing…”
Obadiah scoffed. “I’m only looking out for the company, Anthony. We need to keep our investors happy or there won’t be a Stark Industries after this. We must get ahead of this before the press does.”
Tony couldn’t help his face from expressing how astounded he was with such a simple statement. He could feel Steve's sincerity which strangely felt reassuring. He continued to feel behind Steve’s ear, but then the dull pain in the middle of his chest reappeared.
Tony waited with anticipation, hoping Steve would just let the situation be. After a moment, he felt Steve nod his head against his neck before kissing his skin.
“You told me…” Steve interrupted Tony, “…that Synergy would never be used for weapons manufacturing. I don’t know about you, Tony, but I’m not going to sit by and let all our hard work be destroyed for personal gains.”
“Where are you going?” Tony half-whispered, half-shouted after Steve, trying to get him to slow down by gently grabbing him by the arm but the other had yanked it away defiantly.
He waved a hand around as he pointed out certain architectural features. The group came out on the other end of the walkway into the one of the main buildings. As they entered, they were met with the sounds of a few wedding guests walking around and enjoying the resort amenities.
“Rogers, let me show you the other labs and facilities. We’ll also discuss the project more with the rest of the team.” Steve turned around to acknowledge a content-looking Tony.
He moaned some more from Tony touching him, his body pressing downward more into Tony as their cocks rubbed up against each other. Tony looked downward between himself and Steve, freeing himself and then Steve, feeling their naked cocks slide up against each other without missing a moment.
Steve shrugged. He tried to remain calm. “Uh, I thought I should just let you sleep.” He attempted with a half-hearted smile.
“Let’s get you all settled. I have keys set out for everyone to your suites. Just retrieve them at the main desk once you’re ready.”
Tony lingered on the floor. He drew his knees up to his chest before pressing his forehead against them. There was no way he would be able to sleep tonight, so he might as well go down to the Synergy lab and work until the others got in.
“…now, I don’t even care. The memories hurt, sure, but he wasn’t a father to me, and I was his biological son. He was cold…and calculating. He never told me he loved me…never told me he even liked me…”
After a few moments of some inevitable awkwardness, the two chatted about Steve a bit longer before going back into the hospital room.
Tony maneuvered around Steve, laughing as he set up a prep station on the island. “If I have everything out, then we can move quicker.”
“Should we, uh…” Steve started again with a contained laugh, “go to the bedroom…?” To Tony, Steve’s voice sounded strangely tentative.
Tony sighed. “It’s not just because of Synergy…” he stopped for a moment to look downward at his feet, “…when we were at the house…Steve found one of my dad’s diaries…I told him to throw it out, but he kept it and read it instead…”
Tony took a sip out of his beer before nodding his head. “Or you can email me. I know it’s tough with your dumb phone, but I can make it easier for you with a Stark phone.”
Steve followed him, waiting for Tony to find his copy of the house keys before letting them inside. As soon as they entered, they were met with a lingering moth ball scent which was accompanied by a visual array of antique and modern-looking furniture covered in plastic and cloth sheets ahead of them. Steve looked around as Tony walked to the kitchen: the space ahead of the foyer looked like the living room which had a fire place in the middle; on the right of the living room was a small space that connected to the kitchen and then to what looked to be the dining room. Steve looked to his left to see a hallway that probably lead to more rooms.
“Yep, that’s perfect!” The photographer shouted back, wholly unaware of Steve and Tony’s relationship woes, “okay, now everybody say: congratulations, Sam and Shuri!”
Peter turned toward Steve, beaming. “Tony gives me a—” He then glanced quickly at Tony as soon as he forgot how to properly pronounce the word “quota”.
“Sorry. I…what are we talking about?” Tony tried to recover. He swiped to delete the last draft before shoving his phone into his pocket.
“Earlier in the week we have the simulation presentation for the board, so please be ready for that.” Tony commanded to everyone else.
Tony smiled before reaching over to caress Steve’s side. “It’ll be easy for you to peek if I finger you first then make you come later…” He looked down the length of Steve’s body before looking directly at him. Steve’s eyes widened as he only nodded.
Tony then cautiously walked toward Steve before stopping short. Steve felt like moving backward, but he was still hyper aware of possibly offending Tony.
“We didn’t think we would have any showing from Stark Industries this year, so it’s wonderful to have you here, sir.” The staffer continued as he showed Obadiah into the room.
“Also, please send an email to Pepper to let her know I’ll be working up here the rest of the day.” Tony sat down at his desk as J.A.R.V.I.S. turned on his main monitor and the console in the corner of the office.
Clint sighed. “I’m a mercenary.” He casually answered as if that wasn’t the most bizarre thing Steve had ever heard anyone utter.
Both Shuri and Bruce nodded back at Tony before scouring the lab for material. Some minutes passed as the trio called out to each other whenever someone came across an item.
“…I should have handled this better…” Steve offered, “I didn’t realize that this would be such a huge deal…”
Both Peter and Tony hustled out of the kitchen to greet May at the elevator. Peter shouted with glee as soon as he saw his aunt emerge from the elevator.
He knew he needed to get over it; he had been through breakups like this before and managed to survive. But now it felt like he would never find anyone. Maybe it would be better to just focus on Peter and work. Dating only brought him heartache. Yet, he couldn’t lose Pepper completely; she was one of his closest friends.
Steve nodded. He was crossing his arms now and Tony could tell he was waiting patiently for him to continue.
Tony groaned. He put down his tablet to pinch the bridge of his nose. “J.A.R.V.I.S., please. I’m trying to get some work done.”
Steve laughed before turning away from Tony again. They were so close on the sofa that he was embarrassed that he was blushing.
“So, I was talking to Bruce the other day and he let me go through the archived Synergy files from a few years ago, and I found this…” Peter slid the square object across the table toward Steve and Tony. Both looked at each other before Tony picked up the thing and unwrapped it. As he slowly revealed the gift, both he and Steve made the most surprised reactions.
“…this tub…” Steve started, trying to speak, but lost himself in the moment, “…this tub…is huge, Tony.”
Steve smiled, which eventually got Tony to smile back at him, albeit something about it felt off to Steve. They finished their breakfast in near, if not complete silence before Steve needed to get ready for his physical therapy session.
Strange nodded as he crossed his arms. “Although the surgery went smoothly, we’ll need to keep him under for the next few days. We’ll see how he’s doing then. But if he wakes in the meantime, I think he’ll be well enough to go home.”
“Oh my god, Tony…” Steve breathed, holding onto Tony tightly as their hard cocks rubbed up against each other, with Steve’s still inside his boxers.
Both ends of the connections went quiet before Tony thought of something to say. “You know, this is one of our usual sleepover nights…do you think it’s too late for you to come over…?
“Rogers, who cares? I’ve had so many rumors said about me, ones far worse than this one, and I’m more or less fine.” Steve could tell Tony was trying to assuage his feelings with another smile, but it didn’t work.
Tony swallowed the lump in his throat, but he knew, based on dealing with this in the past, it was best for his sanity to let go. He could feel that Pepper still cared about him and wanted to be in his life, but as he thought back on their relationship, he realized maybe he didn’t love her the way she loved him. His actions certainly suggested so.
“So, the best advice I can give you when it comes to promotional tours is to keep smiling no matter what. They usually field the questions for us, but if you get a hard ball, try to counter with something positive about the program.”
“Nice job today, Steve.” Rhodey greeted Steve with a handshake, “you’re becoming a natural at this.”
Steve managed to laugh back, although he felt incredibly awkward. He watched Tony crack a few eggs before tossing them into a frying pan.
Steve walked up to Tony, putting a hand on his shoulder before joining him to see what he was working on at the console.
Steve only answered with a pleased-sounding noise as he viciously attacked Tony’s lips. Steve backed Tony up against the elevator, his hands wandering everywhere along Tony’s body. Tony couldn’t think clearly; not only was he drunk, but he was also enraptured with how nice Steve’s lips felt against his own.
Steve saw him enter and waved with a smile. Tony waved back before walking over. Steve rose from his seat to give Tony a hug that was less awkward this time.
be effective. Fury wouldn’t have been okay with you joining the program of you weren’t.” Tony winked at Steve before spinning around to walk over to another series of consoles. Steve stayed put as he watched Tony rapidly tap a few times on a screen.
Steve emerged from the bathroom that was connected to the room with a towel wrapped around his waist while using another to dry his hair. Tony was lying in the bed wearing his reading glasses and tapping rapidly on a tablet. Steve smiled to himself, thinking about finally asking Tony if they could go further that night, but he wasn’t sure how to ask without sounding silly.
“That’s completely understandable…but please don’t worry about it…the team’s on it…you have to get better…” he looked away before looking at Steve again, “…uh, I talked to Bucky and he doesn’t mind if I take care of you…until you get better…”
Tony questioned, thinking back to his conversation with Sam at the event as he rocked back and forth on his heels.
Steve inhaled then exhaled as he turned the coffee mug he was holding around in his hands. He was leaning up against a counter.
Bruce was standing near Tony as the latter tinkered with the Synergy device at a table. They were both in Tony’s lab late into the evening when most of Stark Industries’ employees had already left for home.
the person who probably knew him the best would give him the hardest time since they hadn’t seen each other in a few months.
, and second…” he made another motion with his hands to indicate Sharon and Steve, “she doesn’t know that I used to fuck her boyfriend!” His voice slightly raised with anger causing Bruce to make shooing motions with his hands to get Tony to quiet down.
Rhodey nodded slowly as his expression change slightly. He then smiled, but only a bit to reassure his friend.
“Fuck, Steve…you feel so amazing…” Tony let out as he leaned forward some more. Steve watched Tony’s ass pop up and down as he continued to push forward.
“Okay, ‘jumped’ was probably not the right choice of word. I was just teasing you. You were very nice and polite, despite being hammered—uh, well, that was until we got back to the penthouse. You were all over me.”
Steve kissed Tony on the lips before moving his head to kiss him on his neck. He moved all Tony’s shoulder before moving downward, stopping to feel his chest, taking his time as he then leaned in more to lick Tony’s nipples. Tony’s breath hitched as soon as Steve’s tongue made contact with his hard nipples, pushing upward more as he held onto Steve.
Tony rolled his eyes again. “They’re super close…I don’t know…Steve could have anyone. I wouldn’t be shocked if they used to date or at least messed around in the past…”
Ever since learning more about Thanos’s work at Hammer Industries, Tony had been consumed with trying to figure out the best way to move forward with Synergy. Also, and perhaps even more distressing, he had been using the newest company crisis to distract himself from seriously dealing with his feelings toward Steve.
“And this is my brother, Loki!” Thor clapped the shoulder of a shorter, but thinner looking man who had walked past their huddle. He winced as soon as Thor grabbed him and practically forced him against his side.
As soon as the yacht made contact with the dock, Sam quickly rushed everyone off the yacht to head to the area of the resort where most of the other wedding guests had gathered for the photo. Sam had everyone separate into multiple groups before taking a group photo. Steve and Tony were placed together in a smaller group with Sam, Bucky, and T’Challa.
Tony’s mouth popped opened slightly, looking quite surprised, before he broke out into an uproarious laughter which caused Steve’s face to turn even more red.
Both Tony and Steve looked at each other, perhaps both sensing that it was awkward seeing the other in person again since that night.
Peter shuffled once before he settled. “Um…Ned’s mom has a new boyfriend…and he said she’s happier now.” Peter looked intently at Tony and smiled.
Steve smiled, but he was sure he was blushing ridiculously. It had only been recent since Tony had started calling him “baby”. And Steve couldn’t help from turning pink every single time.
Steve was running around the auditorium, trying to get the rest of the students, parents, and teachers out of the space before he found Ned to also get him out to safety. The robot was now in the middle of the space, spinning around with its arms flailing about. Peter and Tony flanked the robot from the back as Peter worked on his tablet. He tapped once more which caused the robot to stop spinning before it ran right into a tight corner between the bleachers and the stage.
Steve and Tony marched down the corridor, with Agent Hill following not too far behind, until they came upon one of the interrogation rooms. As they arrived at the one-way window, they could see someone with self-assured expression on his face restrained to the table, flanked by agents on both sides. Tony looked at Steve before pushing the interrogation room door open.
Sam smiled. Steve could tell that he was trying his best not to give him a hard time considering how upset he was.
“We gotta start small before thinking big, Barton.” Fury coolly explained. Steve also thought it was a little ridiculous that they were replicating something so trivial, but he didn’t question the need for practice.
Tony continued to laugh, never showing any signs of letting up. Steve crossed his arms as he sat up in the bed.
“Not, yet, I haven’t lost yet.” He managed to gently hold off Peter and his efforts to get him to wear the mask before the game began.
Tony took his time looking directly at Bucky who was now looking at him with the sincerest expression.
worse.” As Steve opened his eyes, he saw Tony smiling at him. Steve tried to smile back, but something about Tony’s expression looked pained. He forced a smile anyway.
Tony placed his tablet on a nearby console. “Do you think I should introduce them? Steve asks about him all the time, but I’m really not in the mood to have Peter meet someone I’m kind of seeing and then have things fall apart like they always do.” He sighed miserably.
refer to me as ‘Mr. Stark’—Tony is just fine. Second, originally the plan was for me to be hands off, but, as you’ll get to know me better, I’m never hands off, especially when it comes to anything coming out of my labs.” Tony pointed toward himself before pushing away from the console.
“We’re going to the hospital first; we’ll contact Barton and Romanov on the way!” Tony shouted over the rush of wind as the helicopter lifted from the pad.
“Tony…?” Steve called, not really sure whether he was on the verge of fighting off his kid’s science fair project.
Bruce slowly nodded as he let out a sigh. “Tony, to be honest, I’m not really sure why you ended things with Steve in the first place…I know you thought your past would ruin your relationship, but you guys were great together…I’m just glad you recognize that now.”
Steve sulked some more. “…I can feel things getting more serious between us, so I thought reading the diary would help me better understand where Tony was coming from…I had no idea he would react the way he did…”
Steve waited with anticipation; he knew May wasn’t finished but could tell she was trying to remain careful speaking about Tony in front of him.
“I don’t know, anything, please.” Tony groaned back as he rested forward with his elbows on the control board.
Fury pointed to the woman with the red hair. “Rogers, this is Natasha Romanov. Romanov works closely with me; we managed to steal her away from the Russians.” The last statement seemed to amuse Fury.
Tony slid the image toward Steve who looked confused by what to do. “It’s like using a smartphone or a tablet. Just fiddle around with it with your fingers.” Steve watched Tony make a few motions with his fingers.
“I don’t know what there’s to say, Buck.” Steve lowered his voice as he answered, a little self-conscious that Bucky had been so blatant.
“Uh, that meeting at 10am is the one with the executive committee to talk about you and me…” Tony explained quietly.
Steve continued to laugh as Tony began wrestling around and nudging him. “Tony!” Tony had lightly pinched him, “Tony! Stop!” But he was laughing too hard to really do anything as Tony pinned him down in the bed.
Steve looked at Tony then back at the house, telling himself to give Tony some time. Suddenly, Tony groaned loudly to himself as he motioned for Steve to exit the car with him.
Both Steve and Tony looked at each other before looking back at Peter. Peter’s bed was hardly big enough for him and Tony, but Steve would definitely hang off the edge if not fall off if he joined them.
Pepper inhaled deeply as she shook her head. “No, Tony. That was for a company press conference. We had plans to go to Fratelli’s, but you forgot and scheduled that event instead.” Pepper’s voice never faltered; she gazed intently at Tony.
That entire day, Tony mulled over Steve’s actions and their fight up until that point; it was true, although it took Tony a while to admit it to himself, that he had kept Steve from fully expressing himself, but Tony had felt so hurt by Steve not listening to him. Also, ever since getting to know Steve, Tony had to remind himself that he was old-fashioned and perhaps Steve thought a hand-written note would show his sincerity.
Tony’s insides twisted in on themselves as Rhodey continued. “…you seemed happy when you were with Steve, Tone. The happiest I have ever seen you since I’ve known you. I know you guys have been through a lot and it sounds like things are still complicated, to say the least, but you deserve the best, Tony. You should let yourself have it.”
“Uh…” Tony started, looking away, “…uh, I just wanted to say…” he looked upward at Steve who was looking downward at him with a concerned expression.
Ever since Tony’s father and mother, Howard and Maria Stark, died, there had been a very public power struggle between Tony and Obadiah over the control of Stark Industries. After his parents passed, Tony hadn’t been in the condition to properly run the company but was saved when Pepper later stepped in to serve as a figurehead while he got his shit together. Several years later, Tony asked Pepper to serve as the CEO so he could focus on working in his lab more hours during the day. He had no interest in really running the company, but he didn’t want someone like Obadiah in charge; it was obvious that the man would contract projects to mercenaries and private companies to build weapons and Tony was trying to move the company away weapons manufacturing.
Tony gawked at Steve. “I am well aware, Rogers.” He tried to walk past him, but Steve wouldn’t let him by.
If for some reason you would like to decline this offer, please let us know immediately. Otherwise, we look forward to you joining us in this venture.
Tony put his hands on Steve’s arms before pulling away. “I meant monetary payments, Rogers. But I don’t mind this either.”
Steve nodded. He stopped working for a moment to acknowledge Tony. “I’ve never been a parent, but I’m sure it’s tough. Nice to have people around to help, though.”
Underneath the Christmas paper was a framed photograph of the two of them on Project Synergy’s orientation day.
“I’ll follow your lead, okay? It was rude of me to ask you to come over when you hadn’t made plans for Rhodey to stay longer with Peter.”
Steve shook his head as if he were having a in-person conversation with May. “No, it’s okay. I’ll let Tony know that Peter is fine. Thank you, May.”
Without really thinking, Tony clicked on Pepper’s name to call her. It rang a couple times before she answered.
The comment was met with a period of awkward silence as it conjured up the memory of Steve and Tony having sex after the first time Steve modeled the team uniforms for him. However, Steve wasn’t sure if Tony had realized what was his comment was alluding to, so he shrugged it off.
Peter nodded once more as Tony readjusted his pillow before sitting back again. “Also, I’ll only keep seeing Steve if you’re okay with it. It’s important to me that you like him.”
“Tony?” Steve whispered softly as he approached the opening to the balcony. He looked downward to find Tony reclining on the furniture, fully awake.
“Well, I hope I’ll be an effective member in this endeavor.” Steve answered as Tony smiled at him. Something about the smile felt half warm and half fake as if Tony were smiling during a press conference.
“…he’s going to use his weapon before long…we’re going to have to do something soon before it’s too late…”
“Open brackets: Six, nine, hundred, delta, epsilon, seventy-eight, hundred, closed brackets.” Tony was relentless. Steve fumbled as he punched in the code from the second set. He had never felt so nervous in his entire life, which included serving in the military. He wished they had practice learning the keys on the device first before trying it out in the simulation.
He felt like leaving the party all together. If Obadiah thought they were sleeping together, did everyone else think so, too? Was their relationship too close? Steve hadn’t thought so. Well, okay, he often easily found himself returning Tony’s flirtation, especially of late. Also, Steve had been texting Tony more lately, but it wasn’t like anyone else knew about it. Besides, Tony was flirty with everyone. Wasn’t he?
Steve laughed quietly before turning Tony over some more to kiss him. “Yeah, I think it looks good on me, too.”
Bruce nodded as they walked to the main conference room. “Yes. A few times, actually. Natasha’s worried. She said she’s never had trouble getting a hold of him.”
Steve nodded, taking another step toward Tony. He knew he needed to give him some more time, but he felt compelled in the moment to show Tony how much he cared about him.
Bruce perked up as soon as Tony finished his statement. “Nice, Steve. You’re really getting a hang of the device.” Whatever tension he was feeling could only be broken by some good ol’ active scientific experimentation.
“Ah!” Steve yelped, letting go of Tony before rolling to the other side of the bed as soon as J.A.R.V.I.S.’s voice materialized out of nowhere.
Tony nodded as he followed Steve back inside. They wandered around a bit longer, finding a full bath and another half bath, until they found a bedroom. However, as soon as there was nothing left to discover about the spatial configurations of the suite, they soon realized that there was only one bedroom in the entire suite.
Steve nodded as he watched Tony wait for May’s voice on the other end of the receiver. He chatted with her for a bit before talking with Peter.
Ever since he started seeing Steve, Tony had been drinking less. However, there were times, like this one especially, where Tony needed something to calm his uneasiness. He poured himself a drink, downing the pour as soon as the whiskey filled the glass. Tony stared at the empty glass as Obadiah’s voice and memories of his dad popped right back into head. He sighed, pouring himself another glass.
Steve chuckled before pulling his phone out of his pocket. “You know the nice thing about having an old phone is that I don’t ever really need to charge it.” He handed the phone to Tony.
“Oh yeah?” He kissed Tony back as he bucked upwards to get a better hold. He then looked Tony directly in the eye as the fluctuation in his voice changed.
Steve patted Thor on the back, wincing somewhat from the force of the hug. “Hey, Thor.” He peeped through the hug.
Steve nodded back as he finally reached Tony, reaching out to pull him into a secure hug. Tony exhaled deeply as he settled against Steve.
“I had a really nice time tonight, Tony. Peter’s great.” Steve said as he watched Tony approach him before pulling him into a hug.
Once they approached a hospital room, the doctor went in first to clear the ambassador’s entourage out. Steve felt a hand lightly caress his shoulder.
Tony watched them from above before patting Steve on the shoulder, turning to leave the balcony. Tony led them down a hallway before taking the back stairs to the first floor, walking down another hallway before reaching a restroom where they had stashed the Synergy device and a tablet in a waste bin before the event that evening.
Loki groaned loudly once he saw Thor approach his small table on the sidewalk next to a café. The two hadn’t seen each other for about a month now and sporadically since the Synergy program had been officially abandoned. However, Fury had been intermittently tracking Loki and Dr. Selvig as part of S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol.
Tony looked at everyone else before looking over at Steve who was on the opposite end of the helicopter. He sighed heavily as Bruce took his eyeglasses off to rub his forehead.
But before he could make a decision, Steve rubbed his nose against Tony’s cheek. “I think I’m going to come, Tony.” He whispered.
“I’m really glad we decided to do this, baby…” Tony whispered tilting his head upward for another kiss, “…we were always great together in bed and we can avoid all the stupid relationship drama…”
Steve nodded before turning to exit the kitchen. “Thanks.” As he left, he could feel Sam and Bucky staring at him. But he didn’t care. He knew what he was doing and having Tony at the party was what he wanted.
Tony worked for about an hour before he glanced up at the window looking into Steve’s room to find Bucky walking past it.
“I know that, Tony…I’ve been doing that for over the last week, actually…” Steve shifted a little to look at Tony directly, “that’s why I took a shower and I’ve already been taking the prescription…oh and,” Steve laughed to himself, “our work insurance covered all of it.”
“Stark. Rogers.” Fury’s voice appeared suddenly in both Tony and Steve’s earpieces, “we need the both of you at S.H.I.E.L.D., ASAP. We got Thanos.”
As Tony approached, the doors opened to reveal Steve who also looked stressed and worn, however also seemingly managed to keep it together better than Tony.
Eventually, Peter successfully parallel parked into the spot. Steve patted Peter on the shoulder before exiting the car.
Steve held his hand out toward Strange. “Thanks for all you’ve done, Doctor. Tony’s been telling me that you’re the best.”
“While not illegal, would have definitely been morally uncouth, Rogers.” Tony tried to get Steve to loosen up with a grin, but it was obvious that the conversation had taken a serious turn.
Tony turned slightly to gauge Bruce’s reaction. Bruce nodded as he crossed his arms. “Yeah, I can tell, Tony…” He said with a sincere expression, “but please don’t let that be the reason why you won’t talk things through with Steve.”
Steve stood in place as he watched Tony march away from him. He was tempted to follow, but figured it was probably best to give him some space.
Steve hung his head before pressing the intercom to the lobby in Stark Tower. It was late, perhaps a little too late.
Steve placed his mug on the table next to him as he showed Tony his shortcut. Tony made a few pleasant-sounding noises as Steve worked.
“Maybe the two of us should follow that advice.” She grinned, simultaneously kind while letting Steve know she too was on to him and his relationship woes.
Tony watched Bucky slowly open the door; he took his time placing a tablet down on the table next to him. Bucky stopped short from entering the room, shoving his hands into his pockets as he finally stepped in.
“Of course…” Steve smiled down at Tony, “I love you, Tony…and you would have done the same for me.” The way Steve was looking at Tony caused him to smile wide although his whole body was sore.
Tony sighed as he turned his head away from Steve. “I should probably get ready…should take a shower to clean up from last night.” He grinned with a wink at Steve.
He looked down at the chip in his hand, turning it around and around like he usually did whenever he took a moment to look at it. He then looked up at himself in the mirror, his expression changing somewhat as he unzipped the front breast pocket to his uniform to place the chip inside.
Obadiah sat down in his desk chair after unbuttoning his suit jacket. Steve sat down after, waiting patiently for Obadiah to continue. Obadiah leaned backward in his chair. He appeared to be studying Steve; He took almost a whole minute to speak.
“Tell me which shirt I should wear.” Tony grinned as he held up two different shirts for Peter to look at.
Steve nodded before getting up from the bed to walk toward the bathroom. As soon as the door closed, Tony launched himself across his bed, almost sliding off the silky cover in the process as he grabbed his phone on the nightstand. He tapped once to pull up Rhodey’s number from his favorite’s list.
Tony shook his head back, reaching out to take a hold of Steve's hand. "Steve, it's okay, really…uh—"
Tony yawned loudly as he entered his home office, carrying a second cup of coffee. The setup in the office wasn’t as robust as the lab on the seventieth floor of Stark Tower, but it had most of the equipment and a console Tony could use to do some provisional work.
Soon after, Tony’s penthouse was filled with laughter and music. He had invited his close friends and their significant others, a few business associates, some board members that he genuinely liked, and some other Stark Industries employees. The party was a one off, just something Tony wanted to have for some needed levity as Synergy was being officially closed down.
“Okay, great. You know, they say it’s difficult, but it sounds like you’re getting the hang of it, despite this little snafu.” Tony knew Rhodey was alluding to his anxiety over parenting Peter beyond the failed scheduled pickup.
“Uh,” Tony’s voice sounded choked, “I’m really exhausted, Steve. You know with broken childhood memories and what not—‘Cat’s in the Cradle’ bullshit, you get it.”
He glanced over at Steve who hadn’t moved from his current position and was still smiling kindly at him. Tony smiled back, but almost giggled again. He cleared his throat once more before turning to face a console.
Tony laughed again, moving side to side, hugging his body as if his sides were on the verge of splitting from laughter.
“Well you would know better than me, but don’t give up yet. Even if it doesn’t work out with Steve, you’ve seemed a lot happier lately. That’s something to be proud of.” He smiled at Tony.
After much delay, the first event of the Synergy promotional tour had arrived the following week. For the first event, Steve and Tony were due to give a debut presentation at a design expo at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum on Pier 86. Steve had trouble falling asleep the night before, and now, as he prepped with Tony in a room reserved for them backstage, Steve could feel himself hanging on the brink of his nerves possibly crippling his performance. However, as he ran through his lines repeatedly, Steve was ultimately thankful that he could do the presentation with Tony; they had figured out a good back and forth and a solid narrative that Steve was more or less comfortable with.
“Uh…” Tony began as he felt Steve rub his arms, “…I’m trying to be that person who’s cool with their ex seeing other people…is it working?” He smiled awkwardly as he was beginning to feel empty inside.
Thor grunted, nearly shoving Steve out of the way, but the other appeared unfazed by it. They walked up the stairs leading to the front door, taking note of their surroundings before opening the door.
Yet, Tony remained persistent. “Oh no, you don’t get to stop there. Elaborate please, Captain Rogers.” He smiled widely, waiting for Steve to continue.
Steve inhaled deeply, calmly reaching out his hands toward Tony whose back was now facing him. “Tony, I know. But you should read it. Your father—”
“…this Thanos and whatever the hell he’s building is putting the proverbial damper on Synergy.” Fury added as the team watched the footage that had been projected above the table.
“Well we need to do another test run after we show you all the labs first.” Tony pressed a button on his clicker before depositing it into his pocket. The image of the vibranium spun around before collapsing onto itself. Tony glanced upward and accidentally locked eyes with Steve. Steve looked over at Fury to avoid any prolonged contact.
Tony smiled at the staffer, trying to walk the balance between amiability and not alarming everyone about Thanos’s explosive hidden somewhere on the campus.
Tony nodded, but he stayed put. “Okay…” he took a moment, “let’s input the functions we need to generate a detonator and then we’ll deploy it once we get off this island…”
“Yeah…I’m setting it now…” Tony walked slowly toward the device before leaning downward to input the failsafe code. He let out an uneasy sigh; they were more than capable with reconstructing the device, but now Tony was frustrated with how Steve reacted.
Steve shifted to straighten up which prompted a groan from Tony. “You did say we would leave early.” He said quietly with a smile, running a hand through Tony’s hair as the other hand gripped Tony’s waist.
Bruce smiled before adjusting his glasses. “Okay, so, we’ve been playing around with a few things in the lab as it relates to the device…”
“Tony, you’re awake.” Steve smiled down at Tony, feeling relief rush over him as he carefully grasped Tony’s hand while the other gently rubbed his shoulder.
“Yeah,” Tony felt himself getting surprisingly choked up, “he said something to me once…about how tough I was no matter what happened.”
Steve watched Bucky take a swig of his beer as his friend lightly grilled him about any possible detail related to Project Synergy.
Tony froze. “Uh, well…he’s fine…” He turned around away from the console to see that Steve was looking at him.
As the elevator door closed and flew down to the lobby, Bruce and Tony stood in silence, both too weird to really comprehend the travesties that were their respective dating lives.
He forced himself to dwell on the positives in order to get through work before going out to Queens to meet with the team again.
“Uh…” Tony began, feeling that sharp pain in his chest, “maybe you should go home…” He finally let out quietly.
Looking quite surprised, Dr. Selvig swallowed before looking downward at his tablet. He shuffled around a bit before looking directly at Natasha.
Tony crossed his arms. “Okay…so there’s this random scientist, Thanos, building a super weapon…what does that also have to do with Selvig damaging the Synergy device? Wouldn’t he need it to help build this weapon?”
Both Steve and Tony waited behind the wings of the stage; Tony was chatting with a couple backstage employees, while Steve stood silently, looking around awkwardly as the backstage people whirled around him trying to ensure that the projections of the device worked properly.
Tony watched Steve and Peter, feeling the urge to hug them both. Instead, he jumped up from the sofa, clapping his hands together to get their attention.
“There’s been a call about a possible bomb threat at police precinct 16. I’ve been in contact with Romanov and Barton and am in the process of locating Dr. Blake and Dr. Banner, but I need the two of you to head over there immediately…”
“Good morning, Mr. Rogers.” J.A.R.V.I.S. greeted as soon as Steve entered. He watched Tony turned to acknowledge him with a smile. A version of “Les Boréades” was playing softly throughout the space.
Pepper looked to be considering the proposal. But then she closed her eyes briefly, inhaling sharply before answering.
As the lights in the bedroom dimmed, Tony stared at the ceiling thinking about the inevitability of dying alone before he remembered he needed to text Steve about tomorrow. He fished out his phone from his pants and stared at Steve’s contact profile for a second or two.
Obadiah shook his head as he wiped his mouth off with a napkin. "She sent me an email that she'll be here in a few minutes or so. Stuck in a meeting, I suppose."
Later, Tony would watch in high definition, noting (somewhat bemusedly) that neither Bucky Barnes nor Steve Rogers—who had both benefited from Howard’s money and gear not unlike the Avengers had benefited from Tony’s—were both completely ignoring the very dramatic death scene of their pal Howard in favor of side-eyeing the poor orphan.  Didn’t that say a lot about those two paragons of truth, justice, and the American way?
Rhodey sneered openly at the Captain.  He was certain there was another reason.  SI and the Maria Stark Foundation (At Tony’s behest) were still the primary funders of the Compound and all Avengers missions, mysterious missions that Steve called for with little explanation and often with only Widow and Wilson by his side.
“I know.  I know.  It’s just New York.  The wormhole.  And then the Mandarin,” Tony added and sighed when Steve closed his eyes in obvious sorrow and guilt.  “I’m not blaming you, honey.  It’s just all adding up, you know,” Tony added, consolingly.
Tony gave his bit on missionary Charlie working in Sokovia and bantered back and forth with Widow a bit.  Of course, she would understand they had no choice with this.  They were being informed about how things were going to be, not asked if they approved.
Tony had pulled Barton’s butt out of the fire and offered him a place to stay outside of SHIELD after Loki when everyone looked at him like a monster.  He got no judgment from Tony.  Tony had given Nat a second chance after the palladium incident.  A third chance after that stupid report, and then he had pulled her butt out of the fire along with Steve after what she pulled with SHEILD.  Steve might not really be aware of the just how catastrophic their decision was to post all of that secured information on the web, but Widow was more than well aware.  She had been looking at multiple treason offenses and was well on her way to being the first execution for treason since the 50’s and the Rosenbergs before Tony had stepped in on her behalf. And Tony had provided Bruce with a sanctuary where he could study and experiment to his heart’s content.  He was safe from Ross for the first time in years, and Tony hadn’t said anything when Bruce had condescendingly told him ‘he wasn’t that kind of doctor’ when he had gone to him as a friend to talk, missing Steve and having no one to lean on at the moment just after the Mandarin.
Sam sat back and thought for a moment.  Steve sat back and thought for a moment.  Clint sat back and thought for a moment, but was still mostly indifferent.  Wanda didn’t bother thinking because why should she.  Nat just shrugged, because she never said anything different.  Men are just stupid and gullible.  Captain America is no different.
“Steve, where are we,” Tony asked again, opting to ignore Steve’s last bomb for something that he actually needed to know.
“I’m sorry, Tony.  I was too shocked to even act in that moment.  It’s more Jarvis than Ultron, to be honest.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” Rhodey said sadly.
“I looked you up,” Widow said.  “You were a Falcon test pilot.  We can get you in to get those wings.  Then we have a few things we can all take care of,” she said with a smirk.
“But, man.  Tony Stark is maybe the best hacker in the world.  I know he could cut through all that and release the stuff that needs to be out.  Why risk all of the others,” Sam asked pleadingly.
T’Challa was pretty mad about the burner phone.  Steve didn’t like to think how mad he was going to be once he passed on Tony’s message.  And he would, because Steve was a good and honest man that didn’t keep secrets—unless he ABSOLUTELY had to.  Well, maybe T’Challa didn’t need to know about it yet.
And then Leipzig.  And, of course, Widow is Widow.  And Rhodey.  He HATES them all, but Steve clearly knows something.  Clint, that bug man, and Wilson all make judgmental remarks about him being a traitor, as if he was ever anything but loyal to them in the past.  As if they ever treated him as a teammate.  As if he OWED these people any loyalty now.  He was just sick of it.
“No.  Oh, his highness offered, of course.  Guilt is interesting isn’t it?  He was so upset that he had wrongfully chased Bucky, that he offered all of his support to Bucky, me, and the incarcerated Avengers immediately.  I had originally intended to take him up on that, but, again,--things.  He didn’t seem all that concerned about Howard and Maria, though,” Steve said with a mock frown at Tony.
Tony wasn’t Peggy.  He never could be.  Someone like Peggy was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but Tony had been a good second choice, um . . . second chance.  He was incredibly patient with Steve.  He took care of Steve (and the bedroom was no exception).  He made sure that Steve could do what he wanted—no needed—to do.  Money was no object.  Gear was no object.  He did all of the glad-handing that Steve DESPISED.  What more could Steve want in a lover.
Tony looked behind him where Bruce was standing quietly.  Tony was dumbfounded.  These people were supposed to be his teammates, his friends!  Steve was his lover.
“The deception that she and Fury pulled at the start of this.  Everyone’s opinion of me is being shaped by that document, which clearly leaves out important mitigating factors.  You HATED me at first, Steve, and only part of that was how I acted on the helicarrier.  And a lot of that was a distraction so I could pull a fast one on Fury and figure out what he was up to with a very dangerous artifact,” Tony said sharply.
“Sir, your readings appear to show that you are under duress. Do you need medical attention?” J.A.R.V.I.S. asked him.
But to be honest, Tony mostly wanted to avoid Steve because he felt like he might have embarrassed himself by constantly staring at their newest team member during the project introduction. Something about Steve was very appealing, well besides the fact that he was extremely attractive. Yet, Tony knew he needed to get his own life in order before even considering asking anyone out. Also getting involved with another Synergy member would be a huge no-no. Although Rhodey had been kind about the possibility (again, if there was one), he wasn’t sure how others would react, especially the Stark Industries board.
“—no, I heard that part,” Tony turned around fully to glare at Steve, “you seem more than fine with such a
“I got wind that Obadiah is planning to contact some international weapons dealers. I…” She stopped short before continuing. Tony gave her a curious nod.
Steve pulled away to look at him intently. “Let me take care of you tonight, okay?” He whispered softly as he rubbed Tony’s cheek.
Steve made a face once he connected the dots. He ran a hand through his hair as he laughed nervously.
“Sounds good. Night, Steve.” Tony sounded exhausted, but Steve could sense that he was grateful for the invite.
Steve nodded before pointing behind himself toward the inside of the suite. “Should we keep exploring?”
Bruce’s breath hitched as soon as he saw Natasha already sitting at their table in the restaurant. She looked more beautiful than he had ever seen her, and he had no idea that was physically possible.
Tony didn’t actually like the shirt Peter had picked but he made of show of being grateful for the help.
Steve could barely look at Tony, let alone be in the same room with him. He had no idea about this failsafe and the device implosion could have killed innocents. Ever since getting to know his partner, Steve believed he could trust him. Yet, he had trouble trying to comprehend Tony keeping something so crucial from him.
Tony didn’t feel comfortable sleeping in his old room or his parents’ room, so he and Steve decided to spend the night in one of the guest rooms attached to the dining room through a small hallway on the opposite side of the kitchen.
“Of course, I would love to watch Peter!” Tony glanced briefly at his phone to ensure that he had indeed called the right person.
After arriving back in New York from Berlin that evening, Steve, Tony, Bruce, and Rhodey met up with the rest of the Synergy team and some other Stark Industries employees at a nice restaurant and bar Tony had rented for a private gathering.
“Tony, I told you. I have it. Just read the figures.” At this point, Steve and Tony were elbowing the other out of the way of the device. The bickering between the two began to bother the rest of the team.
Fury slid against the wall to retrieve some rolled-up maps in the corner. He unfurled them before placing them on the table. Everyone scooted close as best as they could to take a look.
She then nodded knowingly at Steve and Bucky. “I hear that Mr. Rogers is doing a great job on the team. You must be
“Or, uh…” Tony started as Steve sat down on the sofa he had slept on the night before, “I don’t mind if you nap on the bed with me, Rogers…I can tell you didn’t sleep well last night…you also seem anxious…”
“Despite those unfortunate mishaps,” the board member took her time drinking out of her glass, “I think you’re all doing a fabulous job, Mr. Rogers.”
Peter giggled as he struggled to put the mask on Tony right side up. Tony took over and donned the mask himself, making a face at Steve who was still laughing uncontrollably from the scene.
government connections. Howard would have killed for such access.” Tony whipped back around to face the console. Steve took a chance, even though it wasn’t the wisest decision he had ever made.
“Tony,” Steve took in a deep breath, “please, I need to say this first…” He looked downward at the floor before looking back up at Tony, causing Tony to feel the same way he had the last time they slept together.
Steve nodded, smiling at Tony which prompted that warm feeling on the inside. “Yeah…I should get some stuff from home.”
“…um…I-I'm so sorry, Steve…it wasn’t…uh, it wasn’t because of…me…right…? Because I’m really sorry—maybe you can talk to her—”
“I’m getting a bad feeling about this situation, Tony. I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to be cautious.” Steve opposed, letting himself be pulled by Tony toward the main part of the house were most of the party guests were mingling and dancing.
As the elevator doors opened into the penthouse, Tony quickly exited the elevator car to shed his jacket before walking briskly to the master bedroom.
Steve nodded, standing still for a moment as he watched the car drive away. He sighed to himself as he took the time to regain his composure before heading upstairs to his apartment. He knew Sam was never going to let this go.
Steve rolled his eyes but then he smiled as Tony opened the door for them into the building. They greeted the security guards before going through the security check point to access the elevators leading to the event area.
“Um…,” Clint started in a low voice, leaning on Natasha, “are we still talking about the failsafe…?” He murmured, dragging out the words with cautious-laden bafflement.
Tony fought back another sob that he ended up choking on, trying to focus on something else but the thought of Steve going through his personal items threw off his concentration. He then started crying to himself, thinking that he had finally met the right person before telling himself that being in a relationship never worked out for him so there was no use in trying to make things work with Steve no matter how close they had become.
?” Tony had lunged toward him but both Steve and Thor managed to catch him before he could grab Loki.
was all Tony could think as he hugged the bathroom door. He sighed deeply before turning on the shower.
Bruce’s mouth bobbed opened once or twice before he took the hint, backing away slowly as he mouthed the word “okay” with his hands up in a halting position.
“We’re not…” Tony shuffled around to make sure Bruce nor anyone else wasn’t near him. “Well, he is hot and yes, it is none of your business.”
“Welcome back, Sir.” Steve abruptly stopped short after entering the lab as a dispassionate, non-human voice appeared out of nowhere.
The group then huddled in front of the projection on the wall as the call connected. Soon after, Fury appeared on the screen, flanked on both sides by Bruce, Clint, Natasha, and Thor.
“…I think…ugh…” he shuffled back and forth on his feet, “…I’m really serious…about Steve, Banner…more so than I have been with anyone else…and…it…scares me…” Tony couldn’t bring himself to be completely transparent about his feelings for Steve, but that comment had been the most he had ever said out loud.
Tony tensed.  He didn’t like where this was going.  He could tell something wasn’t right, but he was still too out of it from whatever drugs he clearly had pumping through his system to fully comprehend it.
“You’ve caught on, haven’t you sweetheart,” Steve said with a wink before he leaned forward and stroked Tony’s cheek.  “If you had fought by my side against the Accords, we could have pushed this back a bit, but that’s alright.  I’ve been ready to collect my prize for some time now.”
Ultron was a sucky movie for me.  First, I'm an inappropriate, hysterical laugher.  I read comments all the time about how awful Tony is in that scene when he laughs while looking at Jarvis's "body"--but that's my coping mechanism too, and almost no one understands it.  I had to leave my grandfather's funeral when I started laughing hysterically.  I've never been able to cry for some reason.  People judged me, but he raised me like his own daughter, and the disbelief that he was gone just flooded through me in a way that I couldn't physically handle.  Please don't judge someone if they seem to be laughing in unacceptable situations.  It may be their only way to cope.
“He’s hardly the first hypocrite I’ve ever met.  It’s a requirement for royalty, I suppose,” Tony said without any real thought.
Later, at Clint’s farm, Steve made certain to ask for a separate bed after their fight outside.  When Steve attacked Tony on the word of the Hydra agent that had set the Hulk loose on Johannesburg as he was trying bring Vision online, Tony wasn’t even surprised.  After everything was over, he was even less surprised when Steve approached him to get the girl off the hook for her past transgressions, citing Tony’s involvement in the weapons that killed her parents (as if that was a good reason to become a Nazi terrorist and risk the WHOLE WORLD to get revenge.  As if Tony hadn’t specifically told him about Stane and how his godfather had tricked him when he was young and impressionable).  Rhodey stood beside Tony and stared at the Captain implacably as he told Tony they were putting Wanda on the team for the help she had provided in fighting Ultron, and that she would be moving into the Compound.  Rhodey sneered at the Captain when he said that he would be moving out of the Tower and into the Compound as well.
“Did you know,” Tony asked.  After, lying in a completely broken suit while he waited (hoped) for rescue, Tony would reflect on the fact that not only had Steve lied, he hadn’t even felt a bit bad about it.
“Uh, I think I missed something,” Tony said, strained.  Steve finally let go and then sat back in his chair, crossing his legs.  He looked more like a dignified, political general than a soldier at the moment.
This was the first time Tony was seeing Steve since they had taken their break, though Steve regularly contacted him to reassure him that he was thinking of him and still loved him, that he just needed a bit more time to process everything.  Then he’d go on to describe how well “Wanda” (she’d always be Maximoff or the Scarlet Witch to him) was settling in and raved about the budding romance between Vision (Please, No!  Jarvis would be SICK!)  and the young girl (WHY did he INSIST on infantilizing the woman?).  It was a bit much, honestly. And Rhodey’s comments about Steve were openly hostile by this point.
"Maybe we should take a break, after the upcoming mission, the search for Strucker's base," Steve asked, rubbing Tony's shoulder.
“She showed me you . . . dead,” Tony pleaded, reaching for Steve, but Steve stepped back.  Maximoff hadn't even denied her part in Ultron’s creation.  She had gleefully described the vision she had given Tony explaining that he, alone of the Avengers (she had added with a straight face.  But Bruce was GONE. GONE. GONE), deserved to suffer.
“Yeah, well I’m your friend, not his.  And I certainly wasn’t sleeping with him and living off his dime at the time.  I couldn’t even get you to let me buy you new shoes back in the 40’s.  What happened to that guy,” Bucky asked, wondering when Steve changed so much.
“The one with the footage,” Tony asked nonchalantly, like SHIELD, and Nat in particular, hadn’t gone out of their way to immediately sour Steve’s opinion of Tony.
The time away from Steve, away from their relationship, was opening Tony’s eyes a bit.  He was suddenly remembering that Steve had refused to speak up on his behalf to the team about Nat and that stupid profile.  He expected Tony to forgive and forget.
“I think we’ve established some time ago that you are the only one that I’ve bothered being “real” with, Tony.  It’s what makes you special.  There just isn’t anyone else that can keep up.  And that leads us here,” Steve said, leaning back once more.
Sure Steve loved Peggy.  He REALLY loved her, as in the kind of love that you read about in fairytales.  Sure they had never kissed, or talked for more than a few hours at a time in between missions with the Commandos (Peggy wasn’t in the warzones after all).  Sure they never had a date, but what they had was Real.  He wasn’t blind to the fact that he had something real with Tony either, though.
Well, Bucky Barnes (the poor little lamb) felt solid enough to take aim at the grieving, betrayed orphan with his stolen semi-assault rifle when Tony took his (rightful) swing at that bastard, Steve Rogers.
“Oh, sweetheart.  That’s why it always had to be you.  I want you to fight me, baby.  I need you to fight me.  And Tony . . . hail Hydra,” Steve whispered in his ear.
“Sam, please understand.  We just can’t risk it.  Yes, maybe bringing Tony in could save hundreds of lives, but if anything goes wrong, Insight is set to take the lives of millions all over the world.  Sometimes you just can’t save everyone.  War means making sacrifices.”
Steve sat up and, strangely, gripped Tony’s hand with a care that Tony found odd.  It felt real.  Tony had known for some time just how fake the good Captain was.  Wanda was practically a neon sign that he didn’t know how the others, especially Natasha, was able to miss.  Sure he was a genius, but that was just stupid!
Suddenly he was shaking and laughing hysterically.  He knew it was inappropriate, but he just couldn’t handle this.  Jarvis was gone!!
“Tony, don’t be coy.  That’s not really your style, is it?  You see, when I came out of the ice, Nick wasn’t the only one that approached me.  There were . . . others . . . as well.  I had to make a choice.
Later, he would see footage of Steve flirting with Sharon Carter.  Later he would see footage of Steve kissing Sharon Carter (And Steve was clearly taking nostalgia into different and FAR less healthy territory).
“Of course,” Steve said in surprise as Nat nodded and Sam and Clint smirked.  Wanda just looked at her nails, indifferent—she had another rich benefactor after all.
