“You’ve outstayed your welcome,” Hill says sternly once they’re out in the hall and the door is closed.
It isn’t clear who’s more shocked to see who. Tony raises a brow and Pepper takes an exasperated sigh of relief while Hogan’s frown just deepens.
“I thought those things were only for famous people,” Steve says earnestly, clearly having separated himself from everything despite the golden invitation in his pocket.
“Hmmm,” Joseph sounds skeptical. Then as if an after-thought, he adds, “Bucky wasn’t too pleased about it.”
“Let’s get it on,” Tony whispers and this time Steve does huff out a laugh. Because the music had been completely forgotten, blocked out by the blood rushing in Steve’s ears. And Steve is sure a line like that would certainly win them some sort of award in the Painfully Corny Gay Amateur Porn category. But all mirth quickly dies away when Tony gives Steve’s two sure stokes and says, “-open me up so we can get this in me already.”
“Are you alright, sir?” the young lady asks once turning off her vacuum cleaner, the low hum of the machine disappears.
Steve moans into the desperate kiss that follows, hands shaky as he takes the proffered tube of lubricant and allows himself to be pushed back until he’s up on his knees.
“Honestly,” Steve says thoughtfully, “I can’t begin to tell you how lucky I feel. I mean, I thought my agent was gonna have me doing modeling bits forever. Then she spoke about this senseless teenage show, and I mean, I was grateful for her major effort, don’t get me wrong. I just, always thought if I get into the business I’d do something meaningful. You know?”
“Tony isn’t picking up his phone,” Hogan says. “I stopped by his room at Le Sapphire and he’s not in. Or not answering the door, I dunno. I thought you might know where he is.”
But today is different. All cellphones are off and appointments aside. They have gotten this far in the script, and Steve is determined to get through the entire thing at least once before the big day, but Tony isn’t making it easy.
For some completely unexplainable reason, he isn’t taking into account the fact that his father has also viewed the very same photographs.
He wonders what Tony would think if he knew Steve was still reminiscing the night before. Picturing him naked.
“I’ll be in the lounge if you need me.” Steve places a kiss on Tony’s lips. A kiss that Tony threatens to deepen had he not pulled away on time.
He’s shocked that he feels slightly disappointed when Tony tugs him a little, summoning their continuation down the busy pavement.
Tony’s jeans dropped to the ground with a light thump and loud jingle. And Steve can’t decide whether he wants to push Tony away to enjoy the view or keep kissing him. He decides to enjoy the best of worlds, brazenly reaching between their two warm bodies and groping Tony too expertly for Tony to believe that it’s Steve’s first time doing this.
“And,” Steve spins round and gestures to the kitchen island like the pretty lady in a tight red dress pointing to the car on an old gameshow, “for the piece de resistance, blueberry buttermilk pancakes.”
“Well, as it’s been decades since anyone has asked to see my ID-” Steve is uncharacteristically snarky. Because he’s jobless and he’s been dumped by the man he thought he loved and now he’s about to be stood up by his best friend as well. “- I’d like one damn good reason why you won’t ge-”
There’re several magazines, but only one is open. Pepper dares a glance over at the page on display and then immediately wishes she hadn’t.
“Send Mom my love,” Tony says, and then scoffs after a moment, “I’d like to think you do. You’ve got an odd way of showing it.
“Save it,” Howard raises a hand. “What I want you to do is get Sharon Carter, see to it that her license is ripped from her and she never works in this city again. I’ll deal with the rest.”
Tony notices how the spiky-haired man makes every order sound like a question. Of course he can look down and turn left and raise his head. He keeps himself amused by this since the more he thinks about it, the less sense it makes.
Hogan raises a brow when Pepper stands. Her imaginary dance partner mustbe quite a charmer because she certainly looks like she’s enjoying herself as she sings softly along with Mr. Rogers.
“Oh dear,” the lady says, gesturing for Tony to sit down at the kitchen table. “It doesn’t really shock me that much though. Steve has always been like that. Kept a lot to himself. I just assumed he’d told you.”
“That’s inevitably what you had me thinking, Steve.” Tony shrugs as Steve fights not to look away. “But this isn’t about me. I just, don’t want you to apologize. I don’t want you to feel bad about this because that’s all over now, okay. We’re here, that’s all that matters. And I think you were fucking brave doing what you did for your dad. I respect your decision. I respect you more for your decision, just….. don’t leave me out of the know again. Don’t leave me, period.”
“You know, we probably should rehearse some time,” Tony actually succeeds in sounding calm. “I mean, it’s what I usually do with my co-stars. Helps with continuity.”
There’s a short silence as the stranger digs into Tony’s pocket, the tight denim leaving little room to avoid the type of contact that could be classified as second base to theoreticians. Tony can’t help but smile.
“Now, whatever you do, do not talk to Natasha Romanov,” Tony goes on. “Few get passed her without shedding tears, and that includes the men.”
“Iy Iy, Captain,” Pepper says in the deepest voice she can muster up and Tony finds himself chuckling low again. He can practically see the frown on Hogan’s face through the door.
And then with a shaky hand, Steve reaches into his pocket and holds the little velvet box up in front of the man he wants to spend the rest of his life with.
“You’re encouraging him, aren’t you?” Hogan scolds. “That’s why he signed that damn contract. That’s why his father is pissed off at the rest of us.”
“Then where the fuck do you get off acting as though you know me,” Tony frowns. “Buckyt you were doing it before you even met me. Everyone is always doing that.”
Steve’s laughter quickly dies down when a certain look crosses his father’s face. He tenses slightly when Joseph moves his hand to his cheek.
Even with the door shut and a few paces down the corridor, Hogan and Pepper can still hear the heated argument going on between Mr. And Mrs. Stark.
Steve tries hard not to look over his boss’s shoulder, because Bucky is chopping Stark’s head with an imaginary axe in the next cubicle.
“Hello,” Tony finds his words a second later than he would have liked. It isn’t like the person standing in front of him has bothered speaking either. “I was wondering if Steve Rogers is here.”
Steve swears he can see the realization of his words sinking in. The silence is killing him, he needs Tony to respond.
There’s no doubt that Tony still confuses the hell out of him. Of late, it’s been in a damn good way. But there’s something in Tony’s mood at that moment makes Steve certain that the question he’s been dying to ask for quite a while will never have a better moment than now to be voiced.
Pepper has to turn her back to prevent Howard from seeing the amusement on her face, while Hogan gives Tony his usual warning look.
“You must really be happy,” the smile looked misplaced on Tony’s face, “you’ve never called me that before.”
“Don’t forget Charlie Hunnam. But it gets even better with you. You will be a hero to scores of scared, young, closeted boys who think their sexuality is the end of the world.” Lee places his hands on Tony’s shoulders. Hogan stands abruptly, almost knocking down his chair. “They’ll look at you and they’ll say; Tony Stark…maybe there is hope after all. They look up to you, Tony.
Despite Steve’s best effort to look friendly and thirsty and incapable of pouring his own drink, the man behind the bar is unmoving. He isn’t at all a tall man, but the muscles bursting at the seams and chest of his black short sleeved top make him look as though he’d be able to hold his own in a fight against another man twice his size. His arms crossed over his chest don’t only pronounce his muscle further and show off his very intricate tattoo of a hawk, but it also makes him appear standoffish and every bit as though he’s absolutely not intending on catering to a single one of Steve’s requests. Yet somehow, Steve still manages to find his polite voice. Even though the scrunched up look of animosity he’s receiving couldn’t even be done better by a pro wrestler on steroids and cocaine.
Steve barely hears Stephen try his best to correct Bucky’s deliberate error, not when his eyes are suddenly locked with the man’s behind his termination.
And just as Steve finds a place right beside Tony, Steve almost chokes on the breath he catches. Startled and frozen solid, Steve can’t even begin to imagine what the hell Tony is thinking as he moves both hands to Steve’s face and presses their lips together.
“I’ll be alright,” Steve forces a smile, because Bucky looks as though he’s actually going to hug him. But as Steve takes the long taxi drive home, he wonders who he was really trying to convince. As he sinks into his bed for a much needed nap, he’s certain he’d been lying to Bucky and himself altogether.
“You both however have a chance to right some wrongs,” Howard continues. “It has become clear to me that Tony is doing this to settle his own personal childish vendetta that he has with me. I don’t find it amusing at all. I feel he needs to be monitored… closely. He needs to be stopped before he continues to do bullshit like this and completely fuck up all I’ve built for him.”
Waking up at the hospital to Tony Stark’ face was what he’d thought would be the biggest and only surprise for the day. Though completely pleased by this, he was extremely nervous from the uncomfortable silence that had surrounded them on the long car ride back home. He’d tried not to doze off so as not to miss any moment that Tony might decide to speak to him. But Tony’s shoulder was apparently more comfortable than he’d thought, and shortly after resting his head there, he was out for the next hour.
“That’s the script?” Tony asks with a soft smile and a raised brow, pointing past both men to the thick, bound document on the disorderly table.
Tony tosses every last loose note from his pocket into the hat that’s placed on the ground beside the musician.
The kissing was great; Steve wouldn’t begin to deny that. But the affection was way better. The way Tony had literally just laid in his arms. Steve under the covers and Tony on top. The bridge keeping a level of innocence between them.
Steve hears Tony chuckle and then watches as he shrugs out of his jacket, revealing a black, heavy metal t-shirt.
“Is that all Mrs. Romanov?” Tony askes, taking the utmost pride in knowing only a select few celebrities are able to render her speechless like that.
He’s paying little attention anything going on in the room as they give each other orders to zoom in on camera two and roll to add breaks. Hogan’s way too on edge.
“You’re not ready?” Howard frowns, not missing a beat as he grabs the plate off his son’s lap and pulls off the napkin that had been tucked into the collar of his black shirt. Tony cringes for the make-up artist when his father grabs the powder brush out of her hand. “My son does
“Let’s carry on,” she Hill sighs as she reenters the room and takes her seat once again. Rhodey looks relieved that she’s alone. Lee, slightly annoyed.
Steve returns the soft smile that Tony’s trying on, unable to completely vanquish the guilt that creeps up despite Tony’s words.
Steve looks at Tony, their eyes locking. Steve is trying to search for honesty in Tony’s words, truth he can’t seem to pin with the grin still present on the other boy’s face.
“We’re doing things my way,” Steve barely recognizes his own voice as he kisses Tony at a very bad angle in a very good way, “I wanna see your face every single second I’m inside of you.”
The old against the new, the known versus the fresh. It’s one long media stretch of who wears it better. It’s going to be a challenge.
It’s one of those moments, those perfect moments where he’s just blurted out the truth of his soul; now all that he has to do is lean in an inch, kiss the boy and all will live happily ever after.
“I’ve already spoken to Mr. Lee, dad.” Tony holds his father’s gaze warily. “We sorta already have this whole verbal agreement thing going. I have every intention of signing the contract. You can deal with your
The gym is partially empty just as Tony likes it. It’s probably the very reason he chooses Friday nights to do his main workout of the week.
Howard pulls a photo from the docket, not caring which one it was. They’re all equally clear. Equally disturbing enough.
Steve knows Tony is half awake. He himself has just drifted back into consciousness. When he turns around and looks up at Tony, he suddenly wishes they were both still asleep.
“However, I think I can manage to get away with a tiny spoiler,” Tony announces, regaining his childhood ease. “It’s a true life love story. It’s called,
“Must’ve left it in car,” Tony shrugs, looking from Pepper who’s still trying to calm someone down to an irritated Hogan. “What’s wrong?”
Steve feels Tony’s thighs close around him, pinning his hips, making Steve’s resolve slip further as Tony kisses a hot trail from his shoulder to his chest.
“Well, don’t lose sleep finding another,” Clint shrugs when he notices his question has somehow become rhetorical, “You’re Tony Stark, after all.”
Tony’s been joking like this the entire time, from the second the role was handed over. Even before. He’s been referring to Steve as his boyfriend when in the studio. No one has taken it seriously, assuming it was just Tony being Tony. Now, it makes Stan wonder just how long the little affair had been going on for.
The studio is packed, not a single empty seat in the house. Tons of eager fans sit cheering, not listening to what the talk show host is rambling on about, and none of them really caring what’s being said.
Steve hears himself murmur another promise that gets lost somewhere in the back of Tony’s throat. His fingers skimming through the smaller boy’s hair, eager hands cupping his jaw and holding his neck. Anything not to lose this contact.
“If your dad finds out you’ve been drinking again you’re in shit,” she says, making an effort not to look at his face. He’s doing that thing again. That thing that Tony does when he’s inebriated. He’s revealing that part of himself that only Pepper knows. The part that scares and excites her all at the same time.
Tony is annoyed by his father’s choice of words, even further annoyed that his father’s back is turned to him as the man casually rummages through his book shelf.
As Pepper and Hogan enter, they’re immediately greeted by a sturdy look from the man behind the office desk. He watches them above the brim of his spectacles, not caring much for their hesitance.
that Steve has come to know over the past few days doesn’t give a damn about it being gelled and sparkly. Steve can’t decide which he likes better. Tony Stark or just plain Tony.
Tony breaths heavily, and as he opens his eyes the gentle light that the partially opened curtains are offering is just enough for Tony to see Steve’s head roll back. Eyes shut and brows furrowed, mouth agape in rough gasp as he finds his own release.
He doesn’t stay long enough to be told to leave twice. Instead, Steve makes his unceremonious escape to the elevator ignoring all the knowing looks from his former colleagues who are wise enough not to sympathize over fear of suffering a similar fate. He’s just about to make a somewhat respectable clean getaway when a familiar hand prevents the elevator doors from shutting and he’s joined by his best friend in the cab.
He will attempt to make sense of everything later. Maybe later when he isn’t worshiping every single slight effort Steve is making.
There was no question in Pepper’s tone and all three men seem to know better than to argue with her.
Thor complies and for the next few minutes they go through the dialogue. Lee listens contently while Rhodey jumps from scene to scene. Hill speaks fluently, thoroughly engaging herself in her various roles. And it’s easy considering how well Thor pulls his own weight.
Hogan thinks with a slight shake of his head. Anyone watching the two can easily tell that Peggy is far past mesmerized by Tony and is doing next to nothing to hide it.
For the first time ever, Steve actually finds himself self-conscious about the way he looks in such a situation solely due to the fact that it’s being documented. But, the way Tony tilts his head up ever so slightly and narrows his eyes, making his already thick, dark lashes seem almost too heavy for his eyelids as he looks Steve over. The way Tony makes a low, nearly inaudible noise that comes from his chest and deepens somewhere in his throat. The way Tony adjusts himself none too subtly as he turns and reaches for a remote control, all of that reassures Steve that his boss is more than pleased with his choice for the night.
“Jesus Christ, Stevo,” Bucky interrupts, “death-by-heart disease is completely illogical considering how you got fired from the job you’ve only been planning on quitting since Tony took over. And so what, Stark and you are over. If you ask me he was a closeted, absent dick of a boyfriend anyway. Not to mention he was definitely violating all sorts of workplace moral codes, even if he is a Stark.”
So, Steve very subtly opens his drawer, retrieves a compact disk of his own and pushes it towards his boss.
“Maybe it would help if I gave you his shoe size?” Steve chuckles, then immediately feels like a middle-aged dad trying to be hip around his children’s friends when the other man remains completely unaffected and statue still.  He decides to cloak his embarrassment by busying them both. “Can you get me a Long Island Ice Tea.”
As Tony crouches down to his knees and watches Steve, he feels bad that he has to wake him up. What if Steve had been awake all night? What if he’d only just laid his head down and passed out. The boy’s obviously exhausted, Tony knows that. Seeing Steve there like that puts all of Tony’s problems far behind him. There’s only room to feel for one person at that moment.
“Truth be told,” Tony places the DVD back into its slot, “these are all rubbish. What do you say we ditch this place and go make our own?”
“Okay but,” Steve clears his throat, Tony’s arm still around him is distracting to say the least. It’s mere friendly contact. Only, it’s
“You will be challenging the entire industry,” Lee goes on, “You will become the pediment of entertainment. Think about it.”
“I’ll wait,” Tony offers the lady with a smile. He’s grateful when she removes a box of files from a chair and offers it to him.
The revelation of Tony and Steve is one thing. Finding out about it pieced a lot of things together. For one, as he watches Tony speak to him even though he’s unable to take anything in, he notices a certain joy in the boy that Tony just never had before.
“Hello,” he says calmly. With the phone pinned between his shoulder and ear, Brock swiftly lights up a cigarette.
Steve lets out a controlled breath, rolling his head to the side as Tony continues. He moves his hands from the ripples of muscle on Tony’s stomach right around to trace the notches of his spine, not remembering him being so toned, but loving it either way. Tony’s tongue brushes up his throat, and when his hips thrust up to meet Tony’s, Steve realizes that he couldn’t have controlled it.
“Can’t help it,” Steve grins, focusing back on the zombie he’s still trying to annihilate, “It’s addictive.”
As Tony saunters over to the mini bar, Steve busies himself by shrugging out of his hoodie, tossing his cap aside and taking in the room more thoroughly.
The last scene has all eyes glued to the big screen ahead. Then the music fades out as does the screen until the entire place was filled with blackness moments before the credits roll.
“I knew you’d be no help.” Hogan spits bitterly, making his way to the door. “If he calls you again, you tell him to call me right away.”
The water covers a little more of Tony’s chest than it does Steve’s. It’s just the right temperature, tiles smooth and clean under bare feet.
“I’m not famous, dad,” Steve rolls his eyes, placing his socked feet on the ground in front of him. It feels like sitting up will make him hear more clearly, and of late, he’s been hanging onto his father’s every word.
The song could have stopped. Neither could really tell because all else fades away when their lips touch.
When Steve pushes into Tony, Tony is far too tight to be teased any longer without actual lubricant. Steve assumes that Tony is most likely always on the pitching end of the game because he simply cannot picture his boss a virgin. The thought still excites him when he allows his mind to wander as he unfastens the cap of the tube and slicks his fingers with a considerable amount of the water-based substance. What if Tony really hasn’t ever bottomed for any other man before? What if Tony really hasn’t ever been with another man at all? What if Tony Stark, certified lady-killer, is a complete virgin in the art of man-on-man loving?
It’s hope. Hope that maybe Steve has been speaking about him to his family. His family has made an effort to know who he is.
The sight alone is enough evoke all sorts of emotions. It feels almost surreal seeing Steve lying there, possibly deep in sleep. His face is drawn into a soft frown, giving away his discomfort. Tony hardly doubts he’s uncomfortable considering the way he was sleeping.
It isn’t like Steve is a stranger to the joys and ease of the internet, he’s just stubbornly old-fashioned. Steve often jokes about how he’d still be using a typewriter if it could email. So as much as Bucky tries to make Steve realize he is living in the 21st century, there are still certain routines that he refuses to shake off.
The stale smell of cigarettes hits Tony’s nostrils and he refrains from scrunching his nose as he takes in his surroundings.
He’s never felt this way around other guys. Hell, he’d been able to look and appreciate their good looks without anything attached.
“Tony,” Pepper finally joins the conversation as she slips her phone into her pocket. “I know how this must feel. I know you’re angry with all of us, but let’s just try to make the best of this. We can all just hang out for a while, we report to your father that you’re keeping out of trouble and then all is well.”
“Remind me to never sleep in denim again,” Tony grins as he snuggles up against an incredibly baffled Steve.
When Tony enters his temporary dressing room, he’s fully prepared to just shove his clothes back on and head home. Maybe pop in to see friends, because judging from the last few messages he’s been receiving, he hasn’t done that in ages.
“Yes,” the lady confirms as if Tony should be knowing this already. “For Joseph’s operation. Steven’s father.”
“Come on, Steve,” Tony grabs his arm again when he turns to walk away. “Is this just because I kissed you? Because that really meant nothing.”
“I wish I could tell you something else,” Howard consoles, “but you deserve the truth. He was leading you on, Tony. And that right there is his collateral. He threatened your career with those; I had to pay him off.”
“Why did you do that?” Steve whispers loudly over the powerful soundtrack and the hum of everyone’s chatter.
“You should ride with me,” Tony’s grin finally returns, refusing to feel any sort of remorse for the antagonist. “Showing up on foot will totally kill whatever rep you might get by being seen around with me.”
Tony almost loses his phlegmatic demeanor, taken slightly off guard with the fact that this is the kid.  This is the boy who’s been chosen to be his co-star. Everyone in the studio has been speaking so much about Steve Rogers, and with twenty days until production, Tony had known he was bound to meet him sooner or later.
This time it’s Tony who moans and as he feels his jeans tighten, he can’t remember to give a shit about what they’re doing. Or the fact that it’s Steve he’s doing it with. Though lust is fogging most of his judgment, he realizes he has never felt so instantly and insanely aroused in his life.
Steve feels his pulse quicken from the look Tony’s giving him. Why the hell is he so afraid to believe Tony? Is it for his own reasons? Is it because the boy who has just said those words to him was Tony Stark?
“The fact that your son is all over magazines kissing a boy who happens to be his co-star in a gay movie that you are thoroughly against him having any part of,” Pepper says with pause.
Tony watches the two boys run to the front porch. To where a young dark-haired man is seated on the porch swing.
As he strips out of his clothes, taking in every detail of the room as he goes along, a strong part of him wants to just go against his promise and drive the extra miles to see Steve.
He wants answers, that much is obvious. He expects excuses, and could care less about what they might be. He can’t envision an apology, at least not a sincere one.
“Ah, Howard,” Hogan says simply with mock fondness. He is, however, grateful that Pepper has also taken it upon herself to slip
Hogan stands backstage chewing on his bottom lip as he watches Tony tackle every question with ease. The boy is working the crowd expertly. Hogan doubts that it really matters what Tony says or how he says it. He can tell the entire audience to eat shit and die and they will all still applaud. The power Tony has is overwhelming, the careless discard he has towards it is frightening.
“Could you send him in,” Hill says to her assistantbefore shooting an angry smile over her shoulder at Tony. “And not another peep out of you.”
Now, Steve is seething when a stack of folders are placed on his desk exactly ten minutes before he’s about to pack up and head out for TGIF drinks with the boys.
“Look at me,” Steve pleads, taking Tony’s face in his hands and forcing their eyes to meet. Both boys are still breathing heavily, both still furiously aroused, but the look they share at that moment holds none of the desire that their bodies are radiating.
“Thor Odinson,” Rhodey says, paying next to no attention to Tony as he sifts through the headshots in front of himself.
Although, right then, Stan feels like doing the man in and hiding the cadaver, he’s more concerned about what Howard is thinking. Howard Stark, standing motionlessly at the window, his back towards the room. Stiff shoulders and reddened neck, head slightly lowered.
This is why Steve is scanning the DVD selection behind the beaded door of the only Video store still standing in Brooklyn. Although his cap is low, his glasses are too big for his face and his hoodie is draped over his head, Steve still feels that same rush he’d felt the first time he’d rented gay porn all those years ago back when he was still in college. It’s the adrenaline rush that keeps him coming back. The sheer possibility of being caught. The tension that builds in the pit of his stomach as the clerk double-checks his choice before giving him a measuring look. As if picturing Steve watching the fireman on the cover fucking the police officer in said overly built man’s arms, hand speeding up and down his own cock. Exactly as Steve intends on spending what’s left of his Friday night.
“I could have gotten you so much more than they were willing to settle on.” Sharon states confidently. “We could’ve split it both ways and still remained with more. But you decided to screw me over.”
“That’s exactly how you looked when you first started,” Hogan frowns, “he’ll be fine. Pepper’s calming him down.”
Even after his awkward assessment of the vicinity from the safety of the door that gains him a few odd looks, Steve still isn’t quite sure what the theme of
Steve chuckles, looking up at the Demerol drip and then back at his father. “Maybe if you behave and don’t drag race on your wheelchair in the middle of the night.”
“What? I mean so little to you that you’re just gonna leave without saying goodbye,” Bucky frowns and Steve frowns harder because Bucky is rummaging through his box as he says it. The short time in which it takes his best friend to relieve him of his cactus, stapler and
And as if by pure coincidence, his eyes drop to the box beside him. The one on floor that has dividers stacked alphabetically.
Steve takes a moment to look from his hands to the boy sitting beside him. He knows Tony’s intentions, and he’s kind of grateful. But he can’t help feeling a little bit mocked even though he knows Tony’s heart is in the right place.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Yes, Neil,” Tony finally smiles again and offers Steve his hand before unsurely adding, “Patrick,” and then, “Harris.”
Because the second Mr. Stark walked into the building that morning, everything suddenly became far too real.
Tony regrets deciding to spend tonight with friends. All the girls keep asking Tony is if Steve has a girlfriend and if he’s as handsome in person as he is in the magazine and if he is a good kisser.  And Tony can’t stand every single thing being about Steve Rogers anymore. So he cuts the visit short and takes the drive home incredibly slowly.
gave me on national television, then the answer is yes. She always found it impossible to be with someone whose hand was constantly down her brother’s pants.”
“You’re kidding me,” Clint says. “He’s been with you since the beginning. Why would he do that now?”
“I was talking about Mr. Rogers here,” Harold had corrected without skipping a beat. Without noticing Tony’s eyes darken and narrow and fix solely on Steve as if they were the only two people in the entire 30-story building. “If you need anything at all, he’s your guy.”
have a gay son,” Howard speaks slowly. Tony wonders if he’s the only one in the room who notices how his fathers’ words sound more like a question than a statement.
“I’m sorry,” the father says as his daughters openly point and gasp in awe, “they’re just big fans of your show.”
“Well,” Steve gives a half defeated smile. He’s clearly fast losing optimism and Sharon almost feels bad for him. Almost.
When Tony does roll off, he lays flat on his stomach just as Steve moves to sit on the edge of the bed with his back to Tony.
“You never did,” Howard says a little too calmly. Steve looks at Mr. Lee who’s still uncharacteristically quiet in his seat. “I don’t blame you that he’s…. changed.”
“Where was I,” Tony continues, “Oh, yeah. The reporters you do wanna talk to are Phil Coulson and Loki . Coulson is easy to spot- balding man, always wearing the same hideous blue suit. And Loki –”
It’s  been a two hour drive getting there, another half hour finding Sharon Carter’s studio in a town he hardly knows. He’s had ample time to think about exactly what he was going to say to her. What he really wanted out of this unscheduled meeting.
“You know what,”  Tony shrugs his mother off, dropping his bag. “I think for the first time I finally do. So I got used, big deal. It happens all the time to people like me.”
“Steve?” Ms. Wanda enquires worriedly when he’s quiet for a second too long. Steve shakes his head as if she’s able to see him deny the wordless accusation.
Steve pretends to act shocked by it like the script demands, he even pushes on Tony’s shoulders. But before he can give in and allow it happen, Tony chuckles again.
“Uh huh,” Tony muses skeptically as he lays back down on the bench press and Jarvis lines up to spot him once again. “You do that.”
“You don’t understand,” Tony can tell that Steve is trying to convince himself that Tony is delusional.
“She was,” Steve corrects politely, “sort of. She did commercial writing. She was a published author, but every now and again she’d take on a commercial.”
“I don’t have to,” Pepper says, running her hands over his bare shoulders. They seem more defined than before. Probably because it’s been a while since she last held him.
“And in other news,” Natasha Romanov’s smile is thoroughly malicious, “Tony Stark, star of the hit show,
what you need. I can give that to you in a heartbeat, in the blink of an eye. But you have to make me a promise.”
“That one is just plain terrible,” the familiar voice causes Steve to spin around so quickly that he nearly knocks down several DVD cases when trying to steady himself. “Just a lot of bad ranch puns and honestly, there is nothing appealing about getting a bunch of hay up your crack.”
Stan knows a picture’s worth a thousand words, and the pictures Brock showed up with were platinum. But, Tony’s glow seems to shoot all those photographs to hell.
would be the inevitable final walk of shame that comes with it. But both pale in comparison to finding his replacement in his seat before the leather even had time to get cold.
“Everything about our relationship was complicated and fucked up,” Steve’s sigh is already laced with nostalgia, “that’s what made it so-”
Tony smiles, wondering if the short time they’d spent together could have anything to do with it. He would like to think it did.
“Do you wanna start maybe by telling us a little about yourself,” Hill says. She knows she isn’t the only one that notices how calm Thor is compared to the other boys. He holds the script professionally in his hands instead of twisting and folding and bending the edges. He looks right at home in the chair with his legs extended casually; the camera not deterring him at all.
“Looks like you have a visitor, Steven,” Ms. Wanda mutters. It’s completely obvious that she’s less than pleased and Tony finds himself more confused than curious.
So, this idea had been put on hold for a long time. It actually came to mind when I was a looot younger working part-time at a DVD store. The perks of such a job was the simple fact that if you landed the double shift (closing at night and opening in the morning) you were allowed to take as many movies/games/sitcoms as you wanted home with you (the downside to that was that I was usually half dead at work the next morning having spent all night playing PlayStation games and watching full seasons of everything. Anywho, one PAINFULLY SLOW night, literally minutes before closing, I went gay-movie-hunting (not porn – we didn’t have any of those). In my hands, I had the placement cards for All Over the Guy, Brokeback Mountain, Shelter and I was reading the summary of Mysterious Skin when in walks the owner (not the manager) to conduct his two minute random inspection just to make sure all is running smoothly (he had three branches in town) and his employees were happy (incredibly sweet man who also happened to be ‘Anderson-Cooper-sexy’). The entire time I was briefing him on the day’s progress, I was saying please don’t ask what I’m holding over and over again in my head. Then he finally slapped his hands together and said, ‘So, what will you be enjoying this evening?” And his smile sort of turned to confusion as he scanned through my selection. And my face went hot. And he sort of just said ‘oh’, before giving me the cards back, slapping my shoulder, and with the widest grin ever, he said, “enjoy.” I wasn’t entirely out then, but I wasn’t completely closeted either so my panic attack lasted only a minute. But I started thinking how hilarious it would have been if the store DID offer gay porn (any porn really) and I’d been found the same way. Then I laughed more thinking, what if that happens to someone who works at a major corporation and they look up only to find the CEO standing right beside them, doing the same thing. Then Stony came into my life and I thought, how perfect would it be if it happened to these two sexy bastards. And then in one sitting what I’d planned on making a really short story became 19 pages and now its late and I’m tired and I’m praying you guys enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed writing it. Goodnight Stony lovers, Over and out.
“Sharon,” Brock grins, backing away with his hands half in the air in subtle defense. “Nice to see you too.”
“Yes, Sir,” Steve allows unnecessarily and Stark does so, not before giving Steve one last look as if to thoroughly make certain that he has the go ahead.
“Now you’ll have the chance to confirm that you’re not. It’s about time you grow up, Tony,” Howard’s voice wreaks authority. “Now, what we’re going to do is-”
Tony ceases what he’s doing; looking down at the spot his lips have last touched as if memorizing the location he has to pick up from.
The photograph on Steve’s nightstand catch Tony’s eye. It’s a family photograph. Bright smiles all around with Steve looking a lot younger.
“I think you’ve got more than me,” he says, picking one up and then flipping it over to read the back.
Steve moves closer to nestle up against Tony’s side. As if just realizing the boy is awake, Tony’s expression instantly changes and he moves his arm to wrap it around Steve’s shoulder.
“No you don’t,” Hill quips, “You get to sit in and watch if you promise to blend in with the chairs.”
Which is probably why as he knocks on the door, and it swings open seconds later, he’s wondering what the hell had swayed him to come to Steve instead.
He’d been expecting the arrival of his parents, returning from their Sunday afternoon bike ride. One they had enjoyed together ever since Steve could remember, and even before that. Instead, Steve had been greeted by two, burly police officers standing at the door with news that altered his life forever.
That’s what Harold had said. But what Tony had heard was: ‘This man is your bitch, make sure you give him ten times more work than everyone else and call him in on public holidays to do frivolous tasks that should’ve really been assigned to Sarah from Accounting. Also, don’t acknowledge his achievements and penalize him for his co-workers mistakes.”
Steve finds himself completely unprepared for this situation as Ms. Wanda parks the car in their driveway-
One to get an energy drink and impulse purchase a few Twinkie’s, and then the second to use the bathroom at some remote gas station. He checks the address on Steve’s file one more time.
“Why didn’t you ever learn how to play?” Steve askes carefully, never having thought that envy was an emotion that someone like Tony could experience so intensely.
“Bucky,” Steve realizes he’s just been standing there like an idiot, watching them stand off.  He grabs Bucky’s arm, trying to guide him to his black van, but Bucky doesn’t budge. “Bucky, please. Can we talk quick?”
But there’s something in Mr. Stark’s tone that makes Steve know that Howard really does have it right, leaving nothing to preserve. How he knows, Steve has no idea, but he can literally feel himself tremble.
“No,” Tony lays flat on his back, positioning himself on the bench press. “I told him he can deal with his….okay; I can see how that may have sounded. But that’s not what I meant.”
“Do you wanna go out there for me?” Tony asks. “Do you? Because I don’t mind, but I think the audience might be just a little disappointed.”
“Always,” Brock nods, gesturing unnecessarily towards his apartment corridor, “My hard drive is a vault.”
“Let’s get it…done,” Stark turns on his overpriced heel and makes his way back to his office, paying next to no attention to the few employees brave enough to wish him a goodnight.
Tony, however, doesn’t care too much for how he’s looking at Steve. Even from the short distance, as the guy drops his cigarette and stomps it out, Tony can see the predatory gaze being directed at Steve.
Neither of them are the least bit surprised when the gates automatically open before them. Both can almost feel Howard’s glare burning into them from somewhere off in the mansion.
That contact from before. The pace. The movement. The feeling. It’s mystifying to say the least. Why he wants it. Why he has to fight to move off of Steve.
“No, don’t do that,” there’s a mixture of authority and worry in his voice now. “You’re not, Tony. You don’t know what you want. You don’t know what you’re doing.”
Pepper opens the door and Tony follows dangerously close behind her. So close that she can feel his every move.
He looks at Tony’s uncovered arms that only have white arm bands around the wrists. And then Tony holds up the script and Steve snaps out of his trance. A trance that seems to be consuming him far too often of late, he frowns when he realizes that Bucky’s still rambling on in his ear.
“This color’s not cute on you,” Sharon says, referring to his idiocy and doubting he knows it. He further proves her point by looking down at his own pants and then back up at her.
Steve’s never heard of it before and he isn’t quite sure if the place has always been there. But after Bucky had woken him up from his self-pitying slumber with a string of angry text messages; an unemployed, loveless night of irresponsible drinking with his best friend quickly sounded worlds better than moping himself to death on a Friday night. It didn’t take long for Steve to decide to hop in and out of the shower and grab a cab to the GPS coordinates Bucky had sent him along with the many threats of bodily harm he’d inflict on Steve if Steve left him ‘hanging’.
He too is dressed in all black and also has tattoos. But the sleeves that the tank top lacks offers a full view of all the intricate ink stokes sliding and swirling down each ripple of muscle from shoulders to wrists, veins jutting out on his forearms. And he’s wearing biker jeans; the vintage-looking, distressed denim is faded in all the right places and ripped without seeming ruined. Even the boots don’t make him appear as though he’s overcompensating for anything, but perhaps it’s because Steve personally knows this guy doesn’t have to.
“What have you done with Jarvis and why are you here,” Tony’s frowning, even as he accepts and fleetingly returns the
“Hello,” Tony grins, hands sliding onto Steve’s bare waist and hands clamping down firmly enough to keep him in pace.
Scott chuckles behind the camera, silencing the second Hill shoots him a look. She is deeply shocked, however, when she realizes Thor is laughing too.
In reality, Mr. Stark was no longer Neil Patrick Harris, the desperate, horny mix of submission and domination, a switch he’d been able to switch far too expertly at whim. The man who walked in was Steve’s boss, hardened face in scary Armani from head to toe. Eyes empty and posture reeking of infinite power.
Pepper breaks the kiss. The kiss that had been going on for at least three minutes. The type that makes her lightheaded and besotted and so dazed that she hadn’t even noticed Tony’s t-shirt come off.
As the reporter announces that they’re going to crossover to viewers take on the revelation, Steve finds himself completely absorbed by what the outcome will be.
“Sharon,” Brock begins, “I’m really sorry. I never thought that would happen. I assumed I could make it a win-win situation. I pocket a few extra k’s and you get Steve Rogers known. I was still going to sell the images either way.”
“You see that’s what your problem is,” Steve stands, raising his voice considerably. “You think everything is a big joke.”
The entire time while in the office, Stan Lee had said nothing. Steve had taken the only comfort he could in the sorrowful looks that Stan Lee had given him. Sorrow that could easily be misread as guilt.
Fortunately for Pepper, once the door is shut, she’s able to fully remember her place. And when Tony steps out of the bathroom with his shockingly brown bedroom eyes and still half naked body, she’s able fix her demeanor. Even if it is just barely.
“You know what?” Hogan begins, “I think you should just forget about all that. You have a hell of a track record; you’ll find another job in a heartbeat. And me, I can finally pay a little more attention to my other clients. This isn’t the end of the world, Pepper.”
“Hi,” is all Steve can manage, his heart thumping in his chest simultaneously with the bile rising in his gut. But then there is also something else.
“It was implied,” Tony shrugs as they enter the elevator. Steve is just about to argue before Tony purposely interjects. “So, you going to the premier tonight?”
“Of course you’ve been busy,” wants to kick himself for assuming anything less, “you’re Tony Stark.”
Tony shoves the phone into his pocket and then places his hand over Steve’s which is resting on his stomach.
“That boy is doing everything he can to try to get back into Steve’s life,” Ms. Wanda shakes her head. “Well, now that Steve is worth something in his eyes.”
“That’s what’s scaring me,” Hogan reaches to grab Tony’s arm again, but Tony’s too quick. “Tony, you should-”
Tony smiles softly again. He can tell it isn’t going to be easy, but he feels oddly numb enough to take Steve’s blows.
Steve follows Tony’s eyes to the flashing red light on the blackwood table with his abused lip still between his boss’s teeth and something inside him snaps. As if painted with a fresh coat of fuck-me-now, Steve pulls away from Tony Stark, yanks his pants off seamlessly and tosses the annoying piece obstruction towards the camera. Purposely missing it by an inch. Smiling down at Tony when it slowly becomes clear to Stark that Steve is finally getting the picture.
Tony wonders if Steve knows the kind of effect his hands have on him. And they aren’t even below his neck yet. Tony shivers at the thought, further deepening the maddening kiss if it at all possible.
And regardless of all his inward tantrums, he still feels it better that Tony drive him insane under his watchful eye than reading about what Tony’s broken in the Tabloids the next day.
He moans again when Tony’s tongue slides deeper into his mouth, battling his own. Tasting and exploring and introducing Steve to a hunger that he didn’t even know was manifesting in his entirety.
“I am, aren’t I,” Tony chuckles, wondering why the hell, of late, it sounds like the worst kind of insult.
Then there are the numerous times that Tony’s phone will ring, Hogan demanding Tony right away or Lee phoning either or both boys to ask them to meet him at the studio. As production day was growing closer, Steve and Tony seemed to be having less and less time to get ready for the much anticipated performance.
“Tony?” Steve mutters, not fully believing it is really Tony’s eyes he’s looking into. Steve immediately sits up, moving quickly as if the illusion will disappear if he takes a second too long. “Tony, I’m so sorry. I’m sorry. I didn’t… I’m sorry.”
Sharon lifts a brow, thoroughly loving the man standing in front of her at that moment. He’s completely rugged and smells questionable, but she’s prepared to marry his mind.
But Stark is clearly not invested enough to examine the mental condition that he clearly thinks Steve is suffering from. He turns on his overpriced heel and makes his way to the elevator, paying next to no attention to the few employees brave enough to wish him a happy weekend. If the rumors are true, Stark probably has a pretty blonde thing waiting in the limo downstairs with Stark’s favorite brand of scotch in one hand and no panties on under her miniskirt.
Tony saunters into the office, karate- kicking the door closed comically. With a wide grin, he holds up a box of what Lee can only assume are donuts. The bewildered skip in Tony step as he throws himself in the chair across from Lee only tears Lee apart that much more.
But that was all the night before. And Steve knows Tony well enough to know that the boy is severely unpredictable.
“I can’t promise anything,” Tony finally speaks again with a sigh. “It’s not gonna be easy, but I’m gonna try for this one.”
Steve mulls the question over, wondering if the truth would make everything worse. Ms. Wanda freaks out whenever a wave of undesirable emotion crosses Steve’s face. Steve’s father is the only one who does a decent job of hiding pain from her, even though they all know he’s enduring the most of it. All the time.
Despite the situation, when Tony leans forward to kiss Steve’s neck, Steve feels his body react. Steve’s eyes flutter shut, mind completely taking in the sensation.
How could he be blamed while seated across Stan Lee and under the scrutinizing eyes of Howard Stark?
“I support my country,” Steve gropes his crotch with one hand and salutes with the other, not feeling the least bit self-conscious. “And my country supports me.”
“I’m confused about a lot of things Steve,” Tony begins. “I have so many unanswered questions of my own. But, I like the clarity I have with you. It’s probably the only clarity I’ve got right now.”
And then everything falls silent and Tony stopped moving altogether when the punchline to Steve’s joke doesn’t follow.
Tony’s eyes roll back as Steve bobs mercilessly up and down his shaft, leaving him to clutch at sheets. Only because if he touches Steve’s hair he’s sure he’ll get a fair amount of strands out.
“Ya know,” Tony begins, “You may want to tell me why you hate that guy so much. I hate him too, but, of course for my own reasons. It would just be so much more fun if we did it together. We could get club cards and matching t-shirts and everything.”
“Funny thing, actually,” Tony begins, sarcastically, “you know what they also decided to invent after inventing addictive games?”
“You’re unbelievable,” Brock narrows his eyes. “Here I thought you were mad because the photographs of your client are not going to be all over mags and websites, when really,” Brock shakes his head with a smile, “really, all you wanted was a cut in the bribe.”
Stan thinks it wise to get rid of the photographer before Howard’s shock wears off and something else takes over.
Hogan turns his attention to Steve who was perched on the ledge as if he wants to get in but is concerned that the chlorine might eat away at his skin.
And Steve is torn between thanking the guy and lecturing him on proper customer service etiquette, but the new owner is already disappearing behind a pair of retro swinging doors. But when the doors swing open once again, all debates between gratitude and orations are knocked out of him as hard as the wind from his lungs when he locks eyes with the dark figure that emerges.
“Steve,” Tony pulls away from the kiss, still aware of Steve’s hands in his hair and on his neck. Their eyes lock, neither wanting to look away. While Steve’s look is nervous, Tony is trying his best to look reassuring.
“Bed, Tony,” Steve whispers firmly, and Tony can’t help the shudder that ripples through him. Steve’s words, Steve’s actions, Steve’s intentions all rushing straight to his cock. He wonders if the two of them can make it to Hogan’s spare room without being noticed.
“I need no explanation from you either,” Howard shrugs steadily. “I did not intend for this meeting to be long.”
But as he nestles into the pillows and sinks into the mattress, picturing Steve doing the same in that very bed, the most comfortable sleep almost instantly takes over.
“Well, Bucky, I lied,” Steve balances his cargo onehandedly as he glides the little piece of plastic through the employee login and swipe card system for the last time. Within seconds it will be deactivated and Steve will no longer be permitted into the Stark’s Industries building at will. A year ago this would’ve been the happiest moment of Steve’s life. Far too much has changed in a year. “This is hardly the first time a man has lied about his true feelings in order to keep his emotions guarded.”
Tony paces back down the corridor, swinging his car keys around his index finger. If Lee had noticed the awkward silence between the two young men, he hadn’t let on.
“You’ve got no more excuses, Mr. Rogers,” Tony sprawls his arms out on the ledge of the swimming pool. “I didn’t bring my swim trunks either, but I made a plan. Now get with it.”
As Tony closes the door behind himself and emptiness fills the hotel room, the same feeling spreads throughout Steve’s chest.
He doesn’t have a come-back to that one. None that won’t be akin to a cheesy line in a porno flick that is. So as his laughter dies away and an odd silence fills the room, Steve finds himself dwelling on less amusing topics. Issues that have to be smoothened out if he’s ever going to have peace of mind.
“You don’t know a thing about me, Tony,” Steve shoots back, the offence clear in his eyes and in the way his voice hitches ever so slightly.
“Yeah, I see,” Rhodey says, shuffling through photos once again. “This is very different from your norm. What made you decide to try out?”
“You don’t wanna talk about it,” Steve isn’t sure if it’s a question or an observation, but he’s prepared to listen either way.
“I’ll give you everything you need, right now,” Howard smirks convincingly, “if you’ll leave. Forget everything that’s happened while you were here. And stay the hell away from my son.”
only in it for the money. I wasn’t kidding when I said I don’t give a shit about the fame though. But, that doesn’t matter because I got what I wanted. Without having to go through all the stupid song and dance.”
He nods, sitting in the seat across from hers as she fully opens the blinds, spreading light into the once dark office.
And for the first time since meeting the arrogant and occasionally ‘assholelic’ boy, Steve picks up on something he never saw before. And Steve is  taken aback.
“The producer?” Howard scowls harder. “What were you doing at a studio when I told you to be here at exactly three o’clock?”
“Where is he by the way?” Clint asks. The man is so rapt in the moment that he doesn’t notice Tony’s expression waver.
“Uh,” Steve prolongs, looking at Tony. He’s really happy with just spending the day with Tony; Stan’s cancellation had actually made his day. Steve isn’t so sure he’s ready to drop his unplanned plans with his… co-star.
And so, Steve is still seething when a sealed compact disk and an intimidatingly large book are placed on his desk exactly ten minutes before he’s about to pack up and head out for I hate Mondays drinks with the boys.
“I don’t need you anymore,” Steve confirms, voice lowering. “I’ve got what I wanted. Just, stop calling me, okay.”
“I’ll give you a ride.” Tony decides, and Steve is glad that they’ll at least have a little more time to spend together.
He looks down for a second, thinking everything through as Steve stares at his windswept hair. When Tony finally looks up again, Steve stubbornly looks away.
He’d absently noticed the welcoming plainness of the place as he’d walked up the short driveway. It’s one of those old fashioned family homes, conservative and well kept, complete with front porch and a porch swing.
After hearing about the motorbike accident, about Steve’s mother’s death. About this operation being the only procedure that may give his father the hopes of ever walking again. After all that, all Tony can think about is comforting Steve.
Steve doesn’t have time to dwell on the fact that Tony has obviously done this before, possibly numerous times. He doesn’t have time to wonder if there really will be a ‘next time’ for him after telling Tony that he can ride bikes better and Tony laughing, saying he’d like to see that. Steve is still too busy reliving the feel of the motor vibrating up his legs, no space between his crotch and Tony’s bum as he clung to the man he wanted to throttle only hours before. The uptight, pain in the ass boss who was taking rebellious turns and ignoring warning lights with a laugh Steve had never heard before. A laugh Steve didn’t even know existed.
Hogan stands in the control room, unable to take his eyes off of Tony. He only flinches slightly when he feels a hand on his back.
“Whatever you’re having,” Steve says, not really wanting to think. Because if he does he will realize that he is in a hotel room in Manhattan on a Friday night with his boss who made it perfectly clear that he wants them to outdo every gay porno in Brooklyn. He instead steps out onto the balcony, wanting to get some fresh air into his tight lungs and the view into his muddled brain. But he only makes it two steps onto the deck before a hand is turning him around at the shoulder and strong arms are wrapping around his waist. Steve stumbles back until his lower back hits the railing, Stark’s lips over his the entire time.
“I’m not done with you yet” Steve says quietly, the gentle words breaking the tension that had risen between the two of them.
“Not unless yearbook pictures count,” Steve chuckles. Then he inwardly curses himself for his own flippancy.
There’s a certain feeling one gets when they know they’ve just stepped into a potentially disastrous situation. It’s an instinct, something most human beings are born with.
Tony waves a dismissive hand, immediately feeling uncomfortable by the way that Steve’s in awe with him and what he owns. Steve has been like this from the second the trip began.
“Hello,” Steve grudgingly answers, grateful when Tony takes a moment to stop walking so that he can at least attempt to hear his interrupter over the liveliness around them.
Ms. Wanda’s laughter makes his mood lighter once again. He hears it fade away and then hears Ms. Wanda call his father’s name. They exchange a few cheerful words that he can’t quite make out, and then there’s a little bit of a struggle on the other end of the line.
In fact, Steve has followed Tony’s advice so well that they’re almost dressed exactly alike, save for the different colors. While Tony is in dark tones and silver chains, Steve is in a green top and snow-white shoes. Green really suits him, Tony thinks. It matches the color Steve’s face is changing.
“He left… a while ago,” Stan says, somewhat metallically. “Tony, the production has been postponed.”
Brock always feels comfort in what he does; reminding himself that it’s the celebrities who put themselves in the situation they’re in in the first place. They chose to be in the spotlight, they made that decision knowing full well what came with fame.
Tony’s in the water, a cyan glow tinting his skin. The smug look on his face as he speaks makes Hogan know that he is undoubtedly taunting the boy on the opposite side of the pool.
Tony moves past the photos, feeling tense relief when the next page of the file gives him exactly what he needed.
Steve’s frantic protests go unheard and a second later that same raspy, drop-dead, sexy voice floods his ear. “Hey, Wonder Boy.”
Deciding against thinking such, Tony looks down at what he has. Looks at what he isn’t prepared to lose. It makes him brave.
Bucky rolls his eyes dramatically and shoots himself in the head with two fingers. He manages to duck behind the barricade just as Mr. Stark turns to see what has Steve so distracted. When Stark looks back at Steve its equivalent to a look that one would give a person caught defecating in the middle of an intersection during rush hour.
“Fuck the script,” Tony chuckles, moving away from tasting Steve’s flesh long enough to look him in the eye.
Tony sighs, a hint of relief in its texture. He pulls the case away from Steve who hadn’t even realized he was clutching it with white knuckles, fingernails denting plastic.
Hogan pulls out one of the chairs for Pepper before sitting down beside her. Silence drags on for a moment before Hogan decides it’s gone on for long enough.
“Oh Jesus, Tony,” Maria sighs, completely hating the obligation she has to her husband. The one that she once thought she was going along with only to protect her son and now feels like the very thing causing the most damage. “Tony, I need to tell you something.”
Sharon makes a silent prayer that she’s crushed him just enough to make sure he doesn’t go knocking on anyone else’s door any time soon. She hopes he thinks he needs her.
Maria clasps her hands together, thinking of a good way to approach the subject. She notices that Tony is distracting himself with small tasks, like changing his shoes and stuffing his gear into his duffel bag.
“I’m not in the mood to cook tonight,” Steve says on an exhale, bypassing the needless task of reminding Bucky that they share an apartment. That banter lost its novelty ages ago. “Why don’t we go all out and splurge on some
Some reporters gasp and others just chuckle, their mutual distaste for all things Natasha Romanov delighting in the sickened look on her face.
Tony’s sure Lee assumes the silence is there for all his own reasons. Tony’s sure Lee saw right through his calm, quiet facade and noticed every time Steve stole nervous glances at him in return. Tony wonders how good an actor Steve Rogers actually is, because he did a pathetic job of disguising his embarrassment the entire time in Lee’s  office.
Steve feels the little bit of perseverance he’d mustered to prolong the show disappear the moment Stark moves past his balls and reaches for his hole. Because Stark is a hardcore man of authority he has unimaginable power and uncountable riches, yet here is, wide-open and vulnerable, giving himself to Steve so certainly.
“Oh forgive me,” Steve says, sarcasm dripping in his tone. “Forgive me for not knowing that Tony Stark likes kissing boys, just not the gay ones.”
As much as Hogan hates it, Tony’s faded jeans look even more ripped than the last time he’d worn them and his once piercing white shoes are now grubby.  Hogan wonders how he’s ended up with the
Tony muses at the beauty as he rubs Steve’s shaky thighs. He only wishes it was his hand that could be held accountable for bringing Steve over the edge, but he knows there’s always next time. He knows there’ll be many more next times.
“It’s alright, man,” Tony smiles, giving Steve’s shoulder a friendly shove. Then as if to keep the next part covert, he throws his arm around Steve’s shoulder and leans in close to his ear. “To tell you the truth, I don’t think much of that show either,” Tony whispers.
There’s nothing funny about it anymore. Tony is putting all of himself into what he’s doing. It’s no longer about him kissing another guy; it’s about Zane kissing the boy he’s travelled half way across the country for. The boy he loves. The boy he’s just found out is dying. This time it’s completely about Zane and Jake.
“One of us is gonna have to be the brains in this relationship,” Tony chuckles, “evidently, the smart money is not on me.”
Tony’s a little startled by Steve’s arms around his shoulders, a little shocked by the kisses Steve is planting on his lips between words. But he loves it so much and would’ve let it go on forever were it not for the fact that they did have an audience in the otherwise empty waiting room.
Tony chuckles, diverting his gaze away from the dialogue of the opening scene, long enough to look at himself in the mirror. The elevator walls are lined with mirrors. The lobby is lined with mirrors. Tony knows it’s a clever trick to make rooms appear much larger than they really are, but it is beginning to annoy him.
Tony doesn’t have an answer to that. He merely makes a face that shows that, probably, for the first time ever, he and Natasha agree on something.
“I gotta be at Mr. Lee’s early tomorrow,” Steve says, touching Tony’s chest gingerly. He realizes he’s being careful about everything with Tony. He wonders if he can just let go for a while.
It’s quite the opposite, Steve notices as he passes her. His teary eyes must be deceiving him. But, no.
The corridor of the place Tony had once called home. He’d once looked forward to being there. And now, even the good memories that are framed and lined on the walls feel tainted.
She knows that everyone’s looking at Tony in a different light, but doubts anyone notices the change as much as she does.
“Tony,” Steve pleads, holding onto Tony’s hips to slow his movement. Lord knows he doesn’t want to, but he has to save himself before falling deeper. Deeper than he already has. Has he been keeping it in that well? “Tony, I’m falling for you.”
