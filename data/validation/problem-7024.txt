That somewhat dissuaded Steve, who was just about to ask, if the last ghem-lord Stark had a spare identity named Walter, 'just Volt, for friends', who pretended to be a slightly mad but genius scientist from Escobar.
"That is exactly it, in fact," answered the ba, its voice serious. "But ghem-lord Stark hates traditional poetry."
"I could've ended up anywhere," Steve breathed out through his teeth, "meet all kinds of people that don't test their experimental substances on themselves, don't fly around in the armor, don't... turn into hulks. And I ended up here."
"Yes, and my mother is anything but mundane," Stark agreed. "Alright, let's say you understood the haiku correctly. I have no chance of comprehending any of it, so I'm going to rely on your opinion. Let's say the Captain did spend a few years in cryosleep. The question now is, how many? And what led him to it in the first place – an injury? A need for disguise? Or something else? Am I even looking in the right place?"
"What is it?" Janet asked curiously and looked from behind his shoulder. "Oh, unknown number? What are you waiting for, answer!"
"I'd say especially when compared to the last Consul," the easily amused Captain snorted. "Have you seen his hair? Did the hairdresser's right hand have a quarrel with the left?"
He met all kinds of people at war, but their first reaction to him was always the same: he was either a weird guy in a metal suit who couldn't be trusted without second thoughts, or he was a small weakly boy who somehow got to a battlefield. In both cases, people expected him to prove his worth, and even in his time Steve was already quite tired of it.
"He'll be alright," Steve said, "whatever happened to him, we'll figure it out. As soon as possible," he hesitated for a moment, and then kissed her forehead. "I promise."
"Well, you know how haut-ladies are. They won't calm down until they intentionally repeat the result they got by chance," Howard grimaced. "Most samples didn't escape anywhere, but one of the last once, marked X, managed, and he also settled down on Athos. He didn't achieve the same happy end that his ancestor got, but he's working on it. He has his own school, a lot of interesting children there, all boys, unfortunately, they don't allow girls and hermaphrodites there. We... well, you can say we work together. If it's not too much trouble, I'll ask you to deliver a message to him, as well."
Steve didn't think it was stupid. He was generally suspicious, even a slight deviation from the norm would make him question things. During the war, this behavior was dictated by his desire to stay alive, but now the rules were different. Maybe this was just how scientists behaved.
"Oh. That's what I thought," Tony froze, looking at a white piece in his forceps. "A bone. Lovely." He'd thrown it away to the pile and looked at his hand, carefully, massaging it with another. "I... well, not me, the Iron Man sometimes works for the government, when things get tough. Officially, they're called consultations, but we both know what it means. Ross called me to hunt a dangerous criminal, I put two and two together, and here I am."
The last few months, it seemed, Steve's whole world was centered around Tony, and he wasn't about to lose this new one, after already losing his world before.
"Look," he noticed, still distracted, enlarging the hologram, "I broke my brain trying to figure out how you controlled this piece of junk in the forties. My armor has a power source, but it doesn't have a control center, so it cannot be connected to your neural system."
"I'm sorry," said Tony. "I think I can fix this. Well, theoretically, at least, in reality I've no idea what to do, but I'll think of something, I'm smart."
When the cup of coffee, much larger than anything customary for Cetaganda and more resembling of a pool, improved the ghem-lord's mood, his intellectual abilities also increased.
"What happened?" immediately asked Stark, stopping his tinkering with a small device, probably copied from Illyrica.
'And if it doesn't corroborate yours, you're in big trouble,' the commander's gaze was practically transmitting the message.
"Alright, it already dawned on me I need to read about Cetaganda for another hundred years before I understand how people there live and think," Steve sighed. "So, your mother was sad and lonely. Why didn't she go back to the Heavenly Garden? And what does it have to do with Barrayar?"
"It's hard for me to judge, not knowing any details, but I'm inclined to believe the Consul. I've read a lot about their society, and children are valued with the same awe as here. Which is understandable, I guess, considering the work and all the hopes of the parents they put into their creation. He wouldn't."
The armor's scanning system suggested it was a tracking device and that Hawkeye already knew where to look for him, and Janet kept watching Steve expecting him to know what to do.
"Because the atmosphere on Jackson's Whole is too paranoid. Raising children there didn't seem like a good idea to me," said somebody new, coming down from the second floor.
"Got angry," Bruce gave a simple answer. He moved a bit closer to the burning log. The ground was cooling down, and it was getting drastically colder. "We should sleep. I want to leave at dawn. We'll have to make a stop to buy gas and food, and then I'll drop you off at the first city with a train station."
"That's all your things?" he asked, puzzled, looking at a small bag in Steve's hands. "Tony said you were moving."
"We can set up a fire," he offered. "It's not that hard. And no," Steve shook his head, predicting his objections, "I've been at war, Bruce, nobody'll see us."
Steve suddenly understood where he was going with it. He went back to the table, put the coffee pot on it and sat down.
"My father was a fan of everything huge," he said out of nowhere. "Even his ideas were huge, almost monstrously epic. This is his house."
Actually, the thought of getting on an operational table again wasn't at all appealing, but Steve understood what he signed up for when he first agreed to it.
The highly artistic black chaos that crowned the Consul's head could not be categorized as either. His hair dress had some long braids in it, while some strands were cut short, and it even included a few tails and some strange things clearly of technical importance, even though they looked like decoration.
"I think it'll be a good idea to have another course of this... treatment," the Captain grinned, giving Tony a possessive look. "As a preventive measure."
"The hell I am," said Tony. "It's not my fault that you're a psychotic hypnotist straight from a Nazi camp."
It was half past five. The sun had already risen, flooding the kitchen with yellow and green light, painting shadows from the arch leading to the corridor.
"It’s remarkable," said Steve. "Yeah, I gathered. I'll try, but I won't promise anything. But even if I do get there..."
Steve really didn’t want to think about anything that happened. During the war, he sometimes tried to imagine what it would be like to tell somebody about the Iron Man: his girlfriend, or a friend, or even just a passerby. Steve pictured how it would happen, what words would be said, what he would answer. He wondered, if people would be disgusted, or scared, or just shocked. But while Steve Rogers was a nobody, and Iron Man was a hero in his world, in this one, neither of them mattered.
Steve felt that another second of this and he'll crush his fist right into Stark's well-groomed temple. He got up so fast that the move sent something flying to the floor and said, the words clipped:
The kaleidoscope of worlds they had to look into was incredible and dizzying. They changed the route a couple of times, so even the pilot would probably be hard-pressed to recreate it. And who even cared about the route when there were so many new things to see and experience?
"I'm sorry, Captain, but I'm afraid some urgent business requires seeing to. Keep your question, I think we'll find time to talk again, and then you can ask me."
"This is stupid," she muttered. "Something's wrong with Hank. He jumped at dawn and dashed somewhere, mumbling about a conference, or whatever, but who's going to hold a conference on Sunday at four in the morning? Besides, I'd know, I know everything about Hank's meetings."
"You find it funny, Mister Rogers?" Faustus sank into a deep chair, clearly made some time in previous century, and put the cane on the table in front of him. "Yes, I know your name. Mister Stark told me everything."
"Go away," he said. "I don't want to see your face. Like a high-schooler before his first time. No," he added, "I don't want to argue, don't want to hear any excuses. Come back when you stop scaring the clients away."
Escobar was a peaceful world, satisfied and beautiful. It looked quite proper, but Tony looked a little wary, and the four Cetagandans wearing the colors of his house, barely jumped from shadows.
Her own tail, long, with black and red stripes and a charming white spot at its end, was tapping the floor.
"I won't help you," finished Tony, purposefully putting his hands behind his back. The gesture was pointless, Steve knew perfectly well Tony could control the armor with just a thought; even the clicking fingers he used to do was only out of habit.
They had to talk, but Tony, apparently, had been great at playing hide and seek with people he lived in the same house with. Steve remembered Howard's stern face and sighed – he probably shouldn’t have been surprised.
Tony almost stumbled, and Steve belatedly got scared that he'd fall and break all the bones they just put back in their places. When he looked at Steve again, his face was beaming with absolute, pure, frightening happiness.
He didn't want to talk about it, but the question itself, actually, was neither malicious, nor strange. He heard it many times before.
Steve finally felt the armor calling, again, and desperately wanted to connect to it. The call was different than before, though, the pressure of it was gone, so Steve was sure everything was going to be fine. He wanted to get encased in metal again, alone with the armor, the rest of the world drowned out, and to fly. God, he missed it.
In the light of the match Solomon brought to the tip of his cigarette, Steve glanced at his reflection in the dirty glass of the shop's door. He didn't look like a soldier at all, especially with his hair all grown out. He looked like a teenager.
"Of course. Howard Anthony Walter Stark," answered the Cetagandan, raising his eyebrows. He was clearly expecting something different. "I was named after him and my grandfather, so, Anthony Edward. Two names. Almost like yours."
"If something goes wrong," Steve said, slowly, "if my neural system burns... don't even think of leaving me like that."
The name sounded familiar, but Steve didn't like listening in to people's conversations, so he left Pepper to her work.
Tony moved his shoulders, and the armor turned off. He paced around the workshop, took an empty glass from a table and a bottle with golden liquid from a shelf.
"You know for what," Steve interrupted. "Really, Tony. If you really want me to be angry at you for knocking me out, I will be. But I'd rather not."
They managed to catch a radio station, and the trip went slightly livelier. Bruce even cheered up, losing the look of doomed fatigue he was spotting before. Watching him now, Steve suddenly realized why he still hadn't left: Bruce had nobody, and you could feel that in the way he talked, in his actions, in his almost child-like surprise when Steve tossed him a chocolate bar. It was a small, pointless purchase that caused an undeserving amount of gratitude. Bruce was almost as much an alien in this world as was Steve, and it was unthinkable to leave him alone.
"I don't think you're that simple," noticed Tony with disarming honesty. "Are you glad you escaped the war?"
It was a bit like jumping, only Steve didn't land, staying in the air with his hands awkwardly moving around. The stabilizers were buzzing, making his skin feel weird, like tiny insects were crawling all over it. Then again, Steve wasn't all that sure the stabilizers were at fault – he could've been feeling nanobots.
The tour around Stark's mansion took longer than expected, so when the guests, including Jarvis who was dragged inside (while the other Cetagandans went back to the ship), were finally preparing to leave, it turned out, it wasn't just nighttime, the dawn was coming pretty soon.
The screen of the comm on Jarvis' hand was just big enough to fit all of the haut-lady Mio's message:
He noticed the armor moving. Even with the reactor turned off, the movement echoed in his body. Steve stubbornly denied himself connection with it. He remembered how awful it was the last time, and he also remembered Tony saying it could kill him.
They gathered their things quickly and quietly, not forgetting to hide traces of their presence. Steve noticed Bruce looking at him from time to time, but as soon as he turned towards him, the man turned away. It was somewhat unnerving, but Steve quickly learned to ignore it.
"That a problem?" Tony gave him an awkward smirk. "Or did you want to..." He paused, suddenly, tapping his lips with a finger. "Never mind that. I'm getting carried away. What exactly do you want to hear, Steve?"
"Maybe, I am a machine," Steve made a half-assed joke, and Happy, to his surprise, gave him a wide smile.
"I didn't think..." he paused; the expression on his face became distant. "I told you bots are smart, almost like a living organism, remember? I never completely disconnect from the armor, I don't need to."
"How should I know? My job's shooting flies on the wall. No insult meant for you lovely pets, Miss van Dyne," added Barton.
"That's why," he explained, "I'll need to handcuff you to a chair and you'll keep flinching every time I try to touch you afterwards. God, if only you knew how much I miss blueprints." He stretched, making his neck crack. "But my bots react to your reactor, so mine and the nameless war genius' technology is similar in some way," Tony muttered. "Except for the thing where incompatibility can burn your nerves." He dropped the stylus and reached for the glass. "Which means, if there’s a mistake, you'll probably stay alive but paralyzed. Or turn into a vegetable."
"Jesus, Steve, leave it." Tony came closer and put his hands on his chest. He was taller than Steve, but it didn't feel like Tony was crowding him. "That's cute, really."
"I... actually, I've made one for you as well," he rubbed his head, nervous. "I thought you'd want to..."
"I know exactly how much blood I've lost," said Tony. "But no, I don't need a hospital. Armor, determine our location. I hope this piece of trash still has a working GPS."
"Our analysts noticed strange activity among scientists a while back," Barton answered, completely serious, and Steve turned to watch him. "Oh, you're staring with those slits again. Creepy." Steve removed the faceplate, and Barton nodded. "They started digging into it, but couldn't find anything concrete. Today's lead is an accident. If you didn't go to Pym, we still wouldn't have anything to go on. But you did, Hansen came back to herself, and everybody took two and two together and linked it to their shared therapist."
"Hi," the archer grinned. Steve couldn't see his eyes – they were hidden by his glasses. "I knew you'd fly by. You always do when shit like this happens."
From time to time, they exchanged a few words on neutral topics, discussed what was happening in the world. Steve turned out to be impressively knowledgeable compared to Bruce and for the first time in a while had a chance to tell something instead of just listening. Bruce was a strange conversationalist, he wasn't distracted like Reed, or patronizing like Ben, or charmingly sarcastic like Tony. When he wasn't reminded of where he was and what he was doing, Bruce answered all questions softly, almost kindly. But then, there were some moments when he winced, losing his smile, and tensed under some internal pressure.
There was also a robot next to the wall. It didn't look like an armor, and while it was human-like, the dark steel color of his eyes made him look almost sinister. The shadows were playing on its face, and the eyes looked unseeing.
Steve heard it before, Pepper mentioning it in passing, seeing it in newspapers or hearing it somewhere, it was just on the tip of his tongue. That was a clue. A therapist could do something to Hank, even hypnotize him, maybe, but why the hell would he need to? And why the hell would he need Tony?
"I didn't know he was a ghem-lord," Steve smirked, remembering the old story. "If I knew... There was more truth than it seems in that first personnel file you found on me. I did try to follow in my father's footsteps, but that didn't really work. I was born before my time, I was weak and sickly. If I could pass the theoretical exams for the Academy with relative ease, as for the physical ones... I didn't really excel at that."
"Get in," he said. Steve sat on a passenger sit and carefully closed the door. The car looked like the money from selling it would be enough to feed a small African country.
"If I can't find the information indirectly, I should try just asking for it. Not the traditional way for a ghem-lord, but it works sometimes," he instructed his reflection in the mirror. The reflection nodded and looked at its owner with the sorrow of all Cetagandans. It didn't like his hairstyle and the speed with which his hair was growing.
The situation was absurd, like a Mad Hatter's tea party, and Steve couldn't shake the feeling of irrational fear. He hoped Hank would protect Janet, no matter how strong the hypnosis, he hoped, Barton's reinforcements would arrive in time, he kept looking at Tony, feeling helpless and sorry. If this man, Doctor Faustus, was of his world, then he was Steve's responsibility. Him, and all that he managed to accomplish.
Stark did exactly what he promised. Steve never met a person who could hug him like this, from all over, like a boa constrictor. Then again, Stark wasn't trying to choke him, he just climbed onto Steve and kept breathing in his neck.
"Tony," Steve interrupted again. He felt unnaturally calm for some reason, like all his worries lost their meaning. He was either too tired to feel anxious anymore, or he already reached the limit of excitations he could experience in one day.
"Because being completely loyal excludes free will and the ability to make decisions," answered the ba, "I'm a good executor, Captain. But I'm not quite capable of quickly reacting to circumstances. I'm not programmed for that."
"It was always a smart ba," Howard nodded, calm. "Alright, I'll start with the message later. Come," he walked towards a very Cetagandan-looking screen, pushed it away, touched a control panel, and a part of the wall moved away silently.
"I don't drink," reminded him Steve. He hesitated for a moment and then sat down next to Tony on the floor.
"Pepper, this is Steve, he lives this us. Steve, this is Pepper, I told you about her, she's just back from Milan. I think she hates Milan."
"Trust me, some – only some – Imperial Couriers have enough authority to declare war and peace. They try not to do it, of course, not to infringe on the Emperor's rights," answered the Commander.
"Okay," Tony easily conceited. "War secrets, and all that? But the war's over. More than that, the war that you came from wasn't the one that happened in this world."
"I was just thinking that those won't make a good impression on a sick person," said Steve. "I'll show them to you when you get better. Is that a good enough incentive to try to do it faster?"
"Healing factor?" he asked, and they both stopped to look back at the doctor. "Do you mean gene X? You're a mutant?"
The Betan Orb was just outstanding, even though Steve had to admit that what was considered as open-minded on Barrayar, on Beta was seen as extreme puritanism and quickly abolished. Even Tony had to admit that Cetagandan bed life was too serious and prim in some cases.
That same evening, he decided to turn on the phone. As it turned out, turning it on was the easiest thing you could do with it.
"It's fine. I'm unharmed." Tony flinched and looked away. "I hate people messing with my head. I don't think you’re leaving this office on your own, Doctor."
"When did that happen?" Tony said in a puzzled voice. "Doesn't matter. Your consent always was going to matter. I've already prepared the equipment we're gonna need, which took some time, but..." Steve could hear metal clanging somewhere in the background. "Say goodbye to your work, get you things, the car will come get you... when will you be ready?"
"His life depended on him. He only relied on you to get his youth and strength back," Tony brushed him off.
He patted his pockets, took out the phone and gave a string of numbers on the screen a puzzled gaze.
"Rise of the ants?" suggested Tony, but being met by silence, asked in a more worried tone, "what happened?"
They sat in silence for a while. Bruce was shaking from the cold – all his clothes were in tatters. Steve gave him his hoodey. It was quite dirty and wrinkled, but it was still better than nothing.
"Keep in mind, this is the first time I'm doing this. So, don't keep quiet if I'm doing something you don't like it."
"Without the addition of scopolamine this time, I hope?" The Captain smiled, while Clint and Natasha gave him worried glances.
"No damn way," Tony gave him an absolutely mad smile and bit Steve's lip. That helped for a while: Stark's teeth were also quite sharp. Steve was grateful, honestly, otherwise, he wouldn't have had a chance to last. He moaned, pushed his hips forward again, managed to find a good rhythm and started fucking Stark the way the man seemed to like it most: quickly, deeply and roughly. The moans he let out, at least, were very encouraging. Of course, Stark tried to stop himself from making too much noise and drawing the attention of the whole ship and the ba to them. Nothing stopped him from talking, though.
"Let's find a log," Bruce sighed, getting out of the car. Steve yanked the keys out of ignition and followed him.
"I wasn't sure when my consent will start to matter," Steve answered. "So I decided to test my luck now. I saw you in the news."
"Well," Bruce finally broke the silence. "What happened with the Super soldier project in your world, Steve Rogers?"
Going back to his room, Steve noticed Happy at the door at the end of the corridor. He was leaning on the door with a lost expression on his face. Then, noticing Steve, he cheered up, gave him a thumbs up and nodded at his back.
"So, you're saying that he couldn't have attacked a replicator bank?" Natasha clearly wasn't distracted by discussions of Cetagandan culture. She also wasn't prepared to call anyone, other than Barrayaran hermaphrodites, 'it'.
"This is getting annoying," said the archer, his voice cheerful. "We can dance all day, but we all have stuff to get to."
"And it turned out Hulk is a jolly green giant, you and doctor Banner are best friends, and I chose the wrong side of things. Again." A crooked and somehow really tired smile appeared on Tony's face. "That's the problem. I always choose the wrong side and make mistakes. I trust the wrong people, I risk lives of others, somebody will die at some point, and..."
"Oh, Billy likes answering doors. He can make something like a force-field to hold off unwanted visitors while the others figure out what to do with them," Howard waved his hand, unconcerned.
Bruce came to his senses abruptly. He raised his head and looked at Steve through the tousled hair falling on his forehead.
"Is that good or bad?" Tony turned his head to give him a questioning look. "I thought you'd find it cozy. All the old stuff, layers of dust, right?"
Steve gave Natasha a questioning look. This is how it always went when you got involved in somebody else's business without getting a proper briefing first. Natasha showed him a photo on her comm. The screen was small, and identifying a paralyzed person wasn't easy sometimes – the facial muscles relaxed, twisting a usual expression, but...
"Relations like that were not accepted in your culture about a hundred years ago, which didn't stop them from blooming, especially among officers. The last half a century, they're not encouraged, of course, but are definitely not rejected," Stark smirked, still continuing his evil ministrations. "And I think, I'm making quite clear what I'm so interested in. Although, it's not just that."
"The doc?" Tony said. "You're going to a therapist?" Hank nodded, and Tony rolled his eyes. "Oh, Henry, you need to change your surroundings, get outside your comfort zone, find the source of your issues and understand the depths of your subconscious," mocked Tony. "I hate therapists."
A few days later, Steve noticed that he was turning into a ghost of Stark's mansion, that he was going crazy from having nothing to do, and that missing Tony almost physically hurt. Steve was so used to his constant presence, to all the talking and watching movies, all the little things that made up their friendship, that he almost inadvertently started going places he could bump into Tony, spending too much time in the kitchen, standing for way too long in corridors and the drawing room. Tony, however, stopped leaving the workshop, and Steve didn't dare go there directly.
He stood up, grasping at a tree, straightened his shoulders and whistled. The armor turned its head on his call.
"I... yes. How's your adaptation going? I mean... I don't spend enough time with you, and although Ben says everything's alright, and Sue says everything's alright," Reed sighed. "Sometimes I don't pay enough attention to people. Maybe that's why we broke up with Sue. But that's not the point. How are you?"
The explosion caught him on the stairs. He suppressed the panic urge to fall on his stomach and cover his head and almost flinched when he saw Jarvis. The man was quickly climbing up the stairs, clutching a vase to his chest.
"There's another bonus, too. Maybe, these babies can speed up your regeneration. Of course, you won't be able to grow a torn off limb, but scratches will start healing twice as fast. And I can carry you."
"Let me guess: those questions have something to do with your recent research activities that made our whole internal network shake," of course, no network was actually shaking, except for Vorbarton's threads, but Steve wasn't going to indulge that information to the Consul.
"I did," admitted Tony. He looked so sincere, that Steve didn't believe him at all. "Settle in and come back down, I've fixed the armor. And I've a few thoughts... on neural connections. I can only guess, how your reactor is constructed, but if I'm right, it will all go fast and well." He swayed and grabbed the banister. "Though, maybe, not today. But it will."
"Fair." He shrugged, the movement of his muscles under wet skin making Steve's throat go dry. "You still want to know why I did that? Welcome to the real world."
"Well, yeah, genetic construction for you is its own art from... What do you call it? Bio aesthetics?"
"And here he is discussing Dono The Mad's architectural style, quoting classical poetry and making long term predictions about development of gardens with endemic and imported plants," muttered Captain Rogers looking at the screen. "When did he become an expert in all of this? Yesterday?"
He quickly got ready, did some exercises (he'd prefer to go for a run, but was afraid of disturbing someone here) and went down to get breakfast. Nobody seemed to be awake yet, and, while he was sitting alone in the kitchen, a similar breakfast he had with Tony came to Steve's mind. It was a lot more fun despite the difficult conversation they had.
"... there will be some Cetagandans at the banquet, as well, so it definitely won't be boring. You know them."
"My curiosity is quite natural. Not every day Vorbarr-Sultana gets a new Cetagandan consul." Steve's face expression didn't change, but he berated himself for not thinking of taking away the time-stamps of his requests. He had a feeling Stark was lying and using this as a convenient excuse, but he couldn't think of a way to prove it.
"Not quite. It told us we've no right to do that without its mistress's consent and the knowledge of the Consul," the medic looked directly at Stark.
Steve could say they were both right, to find a way to reach an agreement. At least, he was planning on doing that, when they got interrupted by a phone call. The ringing sounded directly in Steve's ears and, unaccustomed to it, he shook his head, trying to get rid of the unpleasant feeling.
Stark finished suffering over his poem, admired the screen filled to the brim with classic hexameter with an almost classic beginning of 'Sing, Haut Mio, the rage', compressed the letter and sent it to his mother, clearly hoping it was her turn to suffer.
"Listen, I knew what to expect, the story with Steve showed me," Howard spread his hands and sat down on the corner of the table. "Alive, I would draw unneeded attention. Think about it, ghem-lord Stark at war with Jackson's Whole Houses! Dead, I'm of no importance. All these children were brought here as biological samples, at least, that's what the technicians see them as. Escobar is one of the biotechnological centers. There's nothing weird about a head of a corporation travelling god knows where for samples from time to time."
He kissed Stark, gently and gratefully, and finally pushed his hips forward, like he wanted to for a while. That was rewarded plentifully: Tony let him in even deeper which seemed impossible before, pressed his hips around Steve even harder, as if urging a horse, albeit in a different position.
"I want to hear the truth," Steve said, finally, putting away his plate. "You said there should be no secrets between us."
"Oh, shut up," the archer snorted. "Let's part our ways amicably. I don't really want to chase you. Go home, don't get in our way, and I'll go home and won't have to kill you. Best case scenario. Right?"
Steve frowned in confusion. To his utter horror, Tony grabbed the wrist of his left hand with his right and raised it.
"How are you feeling?" asked Tony, his amusement evident in his voice. "Judging by your face before the helmet closed, you're in heaven."
Steve had no strong feelings about the Chinese, or any other nation, for that matter. Even during the war, he answered all provocative questions calmly. He didn't hate anyone, he just wanted to protect people.
"Of course. Jacksonians, in their rush to make more money, completely forget that humans are supposed to stay humans," complained Howard, opening the door of his office. It was huge, furnished like a weird mix of bedroom, lab and library. "Some of my wards adapted well, but female animals still refuse to leave the house. I told them so many times about the legendary Taura, they're still scared."
"I've never noticed our moons to be so... magnificent," muttered Vorbarton. He came to the festival accompanied by his wife, but she quickly found herself a group of friends among Vor-ladies and stopped needing his presence.
Steve quickly pulled the bandage aside, and Tony managed to grasp his elbow with his broken fingers.
"Well? What have you learned from the manual with an offensive title?" asked Clint, sitting next to Steve at lunch the next day.
Captain Rogers took note of this. This was the first time he heard something like genuine emotion – disgust in this particular case – in the masterfully controlled Colonel's voice.
It was too late and stupid to back down, and Steve sat on the bed, twisting his fingers nervously. Another's pulse was throbbing under his jaw, non-existent water drops were sliding down his body. Compared to all that, the pain was an afterthought, almost unnoticeable. Steve could get used to it – Tony had to deal with it all the time.
"Leave him alone," said Reed. “Come with me, and I'll show you an idea I was thinking of for a while, I think you'll appreciate it."
"Sorry. For some reason, I lose control of the conversation really fast with you, and this time I'm even awake."
"Well, it was really dirty," said Steve, resigned to his fate. Swamps on Barrayar are really something, I must admit. We spent four days there, and at the end of it we couldn't distinguish anymore between a comrade and a pile of dirt. Vorbarton had to ditch his jumpsuit, something chewed it through, and if not for this thing," he pulled the thing but durable fabric on his shoulder, "who knows what gnats would do to him. We're very serious about boundaries and safety on Barrayar."
"The ghem-colonel himself could get those codes for his servant. He visited the bank before, during a welcoming tour. Although, how could you learn and write them down?"
"I've no license," Bruce shook his head, raised the gun and squinted, aiming at some point in the field. "But that's probably the last thing that should worry me."
"It'll be fine," Steve repeated, pointlessly. They were pretty much doomed. Two men and a Beretta against eight APCs, four machine guns and who knew how many armed soldiers. Even if Steve wanted to be inadequately optimistic, he wouldn't claim they could get out of this alive. How much time did they have? Steve reckoned, about five minutes, before the commanding officer would lose his patience.
Steve didn't even doubt that, but his decision felt like a point of no return. He was either going to change forever, or he was going to die.
And then, he started shouting from the pain twisting his body. He clenched his teeth, and his screams transformed into stifled hissing. Steve barely forced himself to keep his eyes open. Tony jerked his hands away, and then pulled a wire from Steve’s chest. To him, it felt like Tony was pulling his spine with it.
Steve wanted to say it was pointless, but he couldn't find his voice. They were surrounded: the black cars that he saw when he stood up were coming from all sides. Wherever they try to go now, they will be stopped.
"Indeed, that was malicious intent against the father, perfectly fine by Barrayaran standards," Tony smiled, suddenly resembling a painted demon, even with his face unusually devoid of any paint. "I suppose, we shouldn't even try to recall what Yuri the Mad did, after all, three generations have passed..."
The ghem-lord's face, moments before curious and pleased, got twisted by a sudden bout of fury. Whether this was the alcohol that he wasn't used to, or the stress or everything at once, the effect was sudden and somewhat terrifying.
Solomon answered the phone only after ten in the evening, when the shop should've already been closed. He listened to Steve attentively, went quiet for a few moments and only then asked:
Steve's ears picked up that 'another'. Banner didn't look like a person who could kill someone. Nevertheless, there was something weird, something concerning in all his movements and how he held himself, as if he was hanging off the edge of a cliff.
He didn't get to finish, as Janet jumped forward and awkwardly froze in front of him. She clutched lapels of the coat thrown around Hank's shoulders, shook him slightly and squeezed his neck so hard Steve almost expected to hear his spine breaking.
"Something tells me that impertinent ghem-lord will be happy to help you move around the galaxy," Nat smirked. "You've a hickey under your ear. Should we ask them to add hoods to uniforms?"
"We're checking that," Wilson said shortly. "We need Miss van Dyne to answer some questions about Hank Pym's research."
Bruce gave him a crooked grin and started shaking; maybe it was the uneven road, or the laughter he was trying to hold. His jumps from pretended calm to nervous laughter resembled hysteria. What he needed was some rest, something to drink and sleep, and certainly not driving the car.
The most surprising thing was that Tony didn't take the armor. He left it lying there in the dust, and nobody cared.
From the gates, Steve proceeded alone, and the butler only met him at the door. Steve frowned, trying to remember his name.
The city blurred in his vision the moment Steve left the building. The flight was accelerating, and for the moment everything went aside, his goal, the reason Steve donned the armor in the first place. There was just the sky and frightening lightness and the machine that lived with him.
Jarvis, upon learning that their sad hovering near the wormhole tunnel was over and to be replaced by a series of quick jumps and a kaleidoscope of worlds, nodded and volunteered to bring the news and the route to the pilot and the crew. Steve was starting to think that those invisible Cetagandans were like magic mice in fairy-tales: you've never seen them, but the work got always done. Jarvis also suggested that perhaps the ghem-lord should write a letter to haut-lady Mio, to calm her worries.
Steve sat against him, gave a once-over to the visibly tense Cetagandan and asked, feeling like an idiot:
They had to talk, but Steve still didn't know how to start that conversation without looking like he was trying to force Tony to do things his way. There was one way, of course, one thought that occurred to him right when this whole thing started, but he dismissed it, expecting everything to dissolve by itself.
Hulk released him suddenly, and Steve rolled to the ground, helpless, almost hitting his head on roots of a tree. They ended up in a forest, apparently. Lying on his back, Steve saw tops of trees broken by Hulk and pieces of the sky.
He made a quick step forward, making Steve stumble back and hit his back on the door, and pressed his lips to Steve's.
He looked exhausted and pale after his episode, with dull lifeless eyes. Steve wistfully thought of a shower: warm water would've helped them both now.
"You just saved me a lot of time that I would've spent going back and forth," retorted Steve. "I might not know much about sick ghem-lords and the appropriate care of thereof, but I do know that you can't leave an ill person by themselves. And sorry I disappeared for so long. I felt like one of us was going to strangle another any moment. You don't mind me lying down next to you?"
The places where bones pierced his skin were covered in pink raised scars, like the ones from burns. Tony spread his fingers and brought them back together again – as he mentioned, the little finger was still not listening to him. But still, the wound looked like it was inflicted months ago, not just days.
For a while, everything went quite. Neither the strange Cetagandan, nor his servants tried to access any more files, other than that of Grant Stuart, which was to be expected. No mandatory, or just interesting events were being held in the Empire's Embassy, and Clint wasn't calling his buddy to the park – it seems, after surviving the youngest daughter's birthday Vorbarton’s household quieted down as well.
"You read about me on the internet," Tony touched the already cold coffee pot with his fingertips and sighed heavily. "I own a company, I waste my life away, I gather junk. That kind of thing."
"Because the serum drove Steve Rogers crazy," all of a sudden, Bruce seemed eager to share the story, "according to the data we have, 'our' Steve was even weaker than you before the experiment. They chose him because they thought he’d fit the role, he was honest, loyal, wanted to serve his country, and he donated his body to science. He turned into an uncontrollable monster and was shot like an animal, after he killed quiet a lot of people."
"Sue would be glad, though," Reed continued, "she said I should rest, right? But how can I rest, when the flight is so soon, and I haven't even finished the calculations, not to mention that I was going to check them, but there's just no time. Sometimes it seems..."
"Does that bother you? We can have dinner. I'll tell you all about myself, you'll tell me everything about yourself, all proper-like."
Steve almost dropped, when they finally stopped. The world was spinning in front of his eyes, and his left cheek was scratched - Hulk was moving through the forest not paying any attention to the trees.
Somebody whisked past them, almost invisible, like a silver-grey shade, and a voice sounded from deep inside the mansion.
"No, wait," Stark took a closer look at the trees. "The trees are real, but the leaves aren't. Do you remember what I did at the first banquet? It's the same thing here. But why? What for? Who would spend all that energy keeping a garden looking like this? It's dreadfully expensive. Doing something like this on a space station would be only slightly more expensive..."
"That thing in your chest," muttered Bruce. Steve could hardly hear him in all that noise. "What is it? It doesn't look like it could be the result of the serum."
"Not to mention a theoretically impossible energy source that can bankrupt fuel corporations in a second." Tony yawned. "I was used to considering myself a technical genius, but my father is making me self-conscious."
Steve looked at the message for almost a minute, then parted his fingers, letting the phone fall on the bed, and closed his eyes.
Steve wanted to answer, but Tony kissed him again, softly touching his lips, the corner of his chin, sliding his lips along the curve of his shoulder. If Steve was capable of any protest before, now fighting Tony, his own arousal, the pleasure he felt from the lips touching his collarbones and neck, seemed completely pointless.
"I've no reason to trust you," Banner remarked, quite reasonably. He was still tense. It seemed as though he was trying to relax, and failing miserably. Steve saw perfectly well his shoulders brought together and the nervous tick showing through the carefully controlled expression.
Lightning strikes and bright ribbons of light danced behind the glass walls of the reactor that didn't really seem all that reliable.
"I would say something sarcastic, but there's so many options I don't know what to start with," said Stark, unable to keep his mouth shut. "Keep doing what you're doing."
The car started smoothly and left the alley that Reed's house was in. New York fled past them from behind the dark windows, and Steve could barely tear his eyes away from it: he loved the city in either century he found himself in, and could probably watch it forever, if given the chance.
Steve unclenched his fingers and the crumpled fabric of his t-shirt fell down. He looked at Tony, trying to understand if he was joking or not, because joking about these things in the forties wasn't just improper – it was unacceptable. Especially in the army.
But it did, and mysteriously, Steve Rogers from December of 1941 appeared in May of 2012 in the home lab of the famous inventor Reed Richards.
"How should I know? That's not my division at all, I only learned about it because Nat called me an hour ago. The case got handed to her, 'cause... you know, it's a delicate issue. Future mothers aren't going to talk to some guys from Security, and she always manages to get people to trust her."
The armor wasn't looking at him anymore, it was once again unmoving, perfect, and most likely incredibly dangerous. Steve could hardly appreciate all its potential, but even the bits and pieces of information he managed to get during their short connection showed him what a powerful weapon it was.
"Pym particles," asked Steve. He felt slightly excited and felt sorry that Reed, who'd be thrilled, wasn't here to see this.
It only now dawned on Steve that Tony was the first person he told his secret. Iron Man's identity was highly protected: only a couple of people in the government knew that a small young man, whom all the soldiers were laughing at at any opportunity, was piloting the armor of everyone's favorite hero. An endless supply of missions and tasks robbed Steve of everything, and no, he didn't mind that, he volunteered to make that sacrifice, and he would’ve absolutely done it again, because it was worth it. But sometimes, when his thoughts weren't occupied by the next mission, or when his mind wasn't being ripped apart by exhaustion, Steve thought that he was missing something important – a friend, an assistant, a beloved woman, or a mentor, it was hard to say. Steve didn't have anybody. Steve didn't even have himself, not really. Iron Man, with all his insides, belonged to the government.
He shuddered, as if only now coming to his senses, and stepped aside – Steve's hands, without the support, hovered for a moment in the air.
"Not anymore," said Tony, looking Steve in the eyes. "I'm an expert in robotics. I study electronics. Trying to make the perpetuum mobile."
He disconnected. Janet immediately snatched the phone away from Steve, pressed a couple of buttons and gave it back, saying:
Steve rubbed his face. He felt weak and nauseous. He knew he couldn't trust Faustus, but his gut was telling him the man wasn't lying. There was no reason to lie about this. Steve could go back home.
Steve snorted. He heard the rustling sound of steps, a click of the door, then – a thud and Tony's hissing. Apparently, Steve was wrong about the night vision.
"Hank," she said. "Is it you? Please, tell me you're alright. Oh my god," Janet ran her hand through her hair and laughed quietly. "You're an idiot. You're the most genius idiot I know!"
"Come in," he waved his hands. Tony told his people to wait outside and call the police, in case something happens, and walked inside. Jarvis looked in as well, but then shook his head and stayed outside. Steve, however, couldn't hold his curiosity and followed inside.
Tony, probably only now noticing that he touched Steve, jerked his hands away and looked at them as if they did something wrong.
Janet swore, made a few steps forward, and then her legs gave out under her, and she would've fallen if Steve didn't support her and help her sit on a nearby chair.
"Excuse me, but I'm afraid I'll have to leave you for a moment. It seems my face paint got smudged," he declared and swiftly disappeared into one of the well-concealed restrooms. His movement made a few bright holographic leaves tear from the equally holographic branches and slowly fall under the guests' feet. Artfully constructed illusion lay on the floor for a few more moments, pleasing the guests' eyes, and then disappeared like a mirage.
He was interrupted by loud ringing of the doorbell and the sound of Reed's heavy steps, who was most likely side-tracked on his way to the kitchen. Ben frowned, and Steve went quiet. In two weeks, nobody came here but Sue, and she had her own keys.
Steve, frowning, followed his gaze. No sunlight was coming through the curtains, and the only source of light was the reactor in Steve's chest.
The evening was progressing as it should, the officers from the Cetagandan Empire's embassy were gracious hosts and didn't let the guests get bored. The Consul, indeed, turned out to be a ghem-colonel Stark (that, of course, sounded quite Cetagandan, unlike a more familiar name Anthony). He was gliding around the hall that was decorated like a neglected autumn garden, while leading a few conversations at once, even, as Steve noticed, on a few different levels. His kind replies to questions concerning the culture of his Empire were underlined with an almost indistinguishable sense of superiority. Although he seemed to genuinely appreciate and praise Barrayaran culture as well. He knew it quite well, apparently, but to Steve, and a few others, as he noticed, it seemed like a joy of a parent looking at a well-executed drawing of a five-year-old. He graciously evaded questions about politics, but also asked nonchalantly about everything, including the particulars of relationships in the Barrayaran imperial court.
"This is exactly what you should keep thinking," said Natasha, all of a sudden, clearly considering Stark's words. "Let's say, the Cetagandans do care for children. Let's say, haut-ladies, keepers of the nation's gene pool, wouldn't even think of hurting other people's offspring. Let's say, the ba was set up by people who didn't recognize it for what it is. Who would benefit from it?"
"I'll send him a message. How's work?" asked Janet, carefully navigating towards a free table. "You know, I've been pretty surprised to learn you work at an arts shop."
The armor was here, somewhere really close. Steve clenched his hands together and breathed out brokenly, trying to control himself with no success. Steve wasn't in the armor when he got brought here, and he never felt it since. Was Reed lying to him? Maybe there was never even a Reed, and he was captured, and the enemies were trying to get to the classified information he had? The last intelligence reports said hypnosis could easily do things like that.
The army taught Steve to sleep in any circumstances: he could nod off in the armor, in the mud, in a trench, sitting, standing, any way just to get some shut-eye. Falling asleep in a softly rocking car was no big deal. He was dreaming of his mother: she was coughing and constantly sending him out of the room – to get some water, to get the doctor, to call the priest. Steve couldn't take a look at her face. His mother was dying, her tuberculosis was getting worse, and all Steve could recall were the sound of her voice and the coughing.
The day was exhausting, more than any attack he ever had to carry out, and he seriously didn't understand why Tony still bothered with him. The man in question frowned.
"No. It's just that now that we know everything, it's not so weird anymore. First of all, now I'm also a direct subordinate of Colonel Fury."
He didn't manage to figure out who was behind it, in the end. The trace disappeared in the Hydra's lair. The same place Steve's formal life disappeared.
"I can't wrap my head around it," he admitted. "I want to think you're just crazy, but something's not letting me. Crazy people don't usually have influential friends that can get them classified information." Bruce took his hand away from the wheel and pushed his hair back. "What would I know, though? I don't know a lot of crazy people."
Steve stopped in the half-dark bathroom, looking at the smooth blue glow of his reactor that replaced the red. He didn't expect the color to change. The web of scars around it stayed the same, though, and Steve’s body didn’t start glowing or sparkling, he didn't grow any new limbs, didn't start getting seizures that would have him writhing on the floor. Only the familiar glow illuminating his features was different, so now Steve resembled a ghost.
Steve was watching him carefully enough that he noticed that Tony was left-handed. The scars on Tony's arm were almost gone, leaving behind only pale uneven lines. Even his fingers healed up almost perfectly.
Not a muscle moved on Banner's face. For a moment, Steve believed that he was mistaken, or given the wrong directions and address, or maybe he took the wrong bus, but...
Hulk didn't hear. He grabbed the crumpled armor and crushed it with his body. There was a sound of hinges breaking, another shot of pain in Steve's chest, but he ignored it and rushed forward. He clutched Hulk's green hand, clenched his teeth and tried to pull Hulk away.
"My hand is broken in three places," Tony raised his eyebrow. "A piece of metal cut through my tendons, and I can't move a finger. No, Steve, I'm not in pain."
"I've no ties to the government," Steve tried again, "my friend hacked the database to learn your address. I came from New York."
"You spent so much time trying to get me to agree to it, and now you're discouraging me?" Steve asked, confused.
There was probably something in his voice that made Janet turn around and step away from the roof's edge.
"I want to apologize for the rudeness of my colleagues," he continued, after Steve nodded. "Of course, all questions can wait, considering Miss van Dyne's state. We're just trying to avoid a repetition of the situation with gamma rays. I think you can go, but..."
Then he froze, shocked by the loud noise the door made. He was breathing heavily and had to apply considerable effort into making his hands stop forming fists. Tony was standing in front of him half-naked, his lips stretched into an unpleasant smirk.
"Did Reed ever tell you anything about Hank's research? Why does he need all the ants and the rats, why's he always in the lab at night and didn't tear off your head for walking around with his girlfriend?"
APCs stopped about a hundred feet away from them and their truck. Soldiers with rifles started getting out of cars and taking position, aiming at Bruce.
"Listen," said Steve, carefully landing on the roof, raising clouds of smoke and debris from the concrete. "Do I understand correctly that you can't allow me to look into the situation with Maya Hanson?"
Tony nodded and followed, his legs stiff. He was too used to considering his father dead and absolutely did not expect to meet him here, on Escobar... presiding over a kindergarten?
The suitable occasion for asking the question came quite soon: as a part of cultural exchange program, the Cetagandan Embassy traditionally organized a festival of admiring the moon (or, in case of Barrayar – the moons). Even the stubbornest and most traditional Vors wouldn't decline the invitation – namely because they saw nothing bad in admiring moons and eating light appetizers. If the Cetagandans wanted to see each satellite as a hare preparing the powder of immortality – let them, as long as they didn't start wars because of it. Even though nobody, including the Catagadans themselves, could understand, how believing in the hare living on the moon co-existed with secure knowledge that it didn't, in fact, exist due to almost complete exploration of space.
"Junk," Steve echoed. He felt himself getting irritated again. What junk? The kind of junk that was red and gold and that the best scientists during the war would sell their souls for? "Weapons?" he asked in a low voice.
"Janet," Steve said in a soft voice, touching her shoulder. "Let's go to mine, we've nothing to do here anymore. That man promised to keep me posted."
"And when people spend the whole day exercising, that usually means there’s some tension they’re trying to shake off," she added, bringing the phone to her ear. "Yes? You again? I already told you Tony Stark doesn't need a therapist consultation. I don't care about your accomplishments, Doctor Faustus. No, I'm not going to meet with you, and if you keep calling..."
"Of course, it is more important," Stark nodded. "But that fact's not going to stop me from grumbling. Let's have a tour, Captain. We'll have to spend too much time in this tin can, either way."
Hank and Janet appeared next to them, but this time Steve noticed them faster: Tony's armor was good at learning things, and once it noticed something, it kept track of it and reacted faster next time. First, Steve saw them as just tiny dots on an insect, then, at once, they were their normal size, Hank and Janet, hugging him closely. Barton jumped, raising his hand with the bow, and swore.
The man moved, still slowly and half-awake at first, but then he thrown the blanket away in a quick move. He searched around himself, trying to find his crushed glasses, and then got up.
"Why do you hide your hands?" Steve interrupted him. He’d talk about anything rather than his issues.
"Miss van Dyne, you're needed in the institute. Yes. There was an accident, an explosion in the lab, there's a chance the toxin was released." She blinked. If before Janet's voice was distant, now it came alive again, "oh my god. We have to go there, Steve! Now!"
"I was thinking," Reed said, after a pause. "The apartment will be yours, well, after we leave for space."
"Listen," he said, softly. "It's true that I don't have a license. I'm not a doctor, but this place doesn't have any. And there's no landline, so people can't..."
Nothing happened for a moment, and then the mechanism gave in with a squeal, the face panel slid away, and Steve finally saw Tony. Only now, Steve understood what the armor was trying to tell him: Tony's readings – the pressure, the pulse, how much blood he was losing. It was all very confusing, and Steve shook his head, going out of his daze, and turned the connection off.
"He was misbehaving and stayed back to have a supposedly serious conversation with somebody," Pepper shook her head. "So, the auction. You said you like art, so naturally, I had this idea, why not take you?”
"Have you been to Disneyland?" she asked instead of a greeting. "Don't answer, that's not important. Are you free today? I need to go shopping and Hank's always..." Janet stopped, and Steve vividly imagined her rolling her eyes. "I promise no lingerie store!"
Janet saw him and happily waved her hand, the gesture so wide she almost knocked a woman passing by.
Steve sort of expected this. Of course, he hoped Bruce would change his mind, start studying martial arts and learning breathing techniques. He stubbornly thought Bruce had a chance to control the monster inside. Yes, Hulk was dangerous, but any weapon is dangerous in the wrong hands.
Best minds of America were struggling on Steve's armor, trying to make a union between a human and a machine possible; trying to make something that could change the course of the war. Tony Stark made the perfect machine because he was bored.
He kept muttering something under his breath, quieter and quieter, until he stopped talking altogether. Something screeched, some kind of mechanism coming into motion, and a door behind the aquarium opened. Hank slipped there, losing the blanket in the process.
"My baby noticed you, but didn't quite understand what you are. You two are incompatible systems, I suppose. Holy crap," he repeated. "I got my hands on a treasure."
"It's not my secret to tell," said Steve, and gave the mental command. The faceplate opened, and then he disassembled the armor, the way Tony did before. It gathered into a small case that fell next to Steve's legs. Steve was still in his home jeans and a t-shirt that did nothing to hide the glow of the reactor, his hair was disheveled, and his fringe fell over his eyes. He probably looked ridiculous. Tony always managed to look beautiful, even when he was hurt and didn't sleep the whole night before, but Steve wasn't at all like this armor. He was more like a big clumsy machine of his world. They both looked equally ridiculous.
"But I'm willing to bet it'd be someone strange, exiled here for a misdemeanor... whatever they consider a misdemeanor. Disclosing someone's genetic code?" answered Captain Vorbarton.
Having finished that, Steve read up on mutants. Banner's slip up showed Steve there was still a lot of things he didn't know about this world. Then again, reading catchy article titles and drier language of scientific papers Steve stumbled upon familiar words: 'healing factor', 'mutation' and bright pictures brought back the memories of war. Steve met some strange guys back then. One of them, a Canadian, even saved Steve's life, cutting the chains around his armor with his claws. That wasn't what made Steve remember him, though: the guy swore and smoked so much it made Steve’s eyes tear up, and he almost dragged him to a brothel, just because, according to him, any self-respecting soldier should've already gone there. Steve just couldn't recall his name.
"Call someone else," said Steve, barely attempting to not make it sound like an order. "Three or four other scientists, preferably ones that are somewhat connected to Hank. Then call me back."
Was this some kind of terrorist attack? But why were they targeting only scientists? Was it a drug that they administered at research institutes? Or was it something else?
Janet was making noise, doing god knows what in the background. She appeared, with her face clean and beaming, relieved like a person who just had all her problems solved. Janet gave him an unsure smile, her lips quivering slightly.
"Where's your head?" asked Tony. "Will you keep Pep company at dinner? I'm busy, and while I wash it all off – hate being this dirty – Pepper will already find herself another important trip and disappear. Slow her down for me!"
Steve squinted at Tony who was standing with his back straight and looking forward. There was no more life in his eyes than in Hank's robot.
"The witnesses in Sandy Valley said a giant green monster destroyed their homes. That's where the theory came from, that there was a gas leak because of the earthquake. Then it was chalked up to a gamma-radiation explosion in one of the labs."
"Why did you do that?" echoed Tony. Drops of water were still sliding down his neck, and Steve shuddered, even though he couldn't feel it anymore.
"Shouldn't be. If your body started rejecting nanobots, you'd be already on life support. Does anything else hurt?"
He was used to thinking of armor as of something alive, like people sometimes think about their favorite cars or motorcycles, but this one was hostile, from a different time and a different world. Steve didn't even really know what was hiding behind those doors. But the armor found him, and the surprise feeling of it twisted him, and Tony's fingers were squeezing his shoulder so hard it felt like they almost dislocated it. Steve turned around, wheezing through his tightened throat, and Tony snatched his hand away, as if scared.
Actually, Steve wanted to stay at home, but it seemed impolite to refuse someone who came all this way just for him, so he shrugged.
Hank was fiddling with something in his secret room, and the shadow it threw on the aquarium looked like some kind of sea monster.
Steve laughed, all of a sudden, and Tony's eyes widened, making him look absolutely ridiculous. That was a first for Steve – he saw Tony serious, laughing, tired, half-asleep, wounded, sarcastic... One person with so many sides to him, like a whole small world.
It would be incredibly stupid to say Steve wasn't afraid of death. Everybody was afraid of it, they just showed it in different ways. It most likely even applied to Tony Stark, despite his bravado about healing factors.
The lab they came into was probably just one big room at some point that later got divided into two. In the antechamber, the equipment was stuck on top of each other, haphazardly and seemingly without a system. There’s been a screen, a hanger with white coats, a couple of safe vaults and book shelves that no books on them, but a large aquarium with ants instead. Steve stopped, looking at the insects running through gel tunnels.
"Reed didn't want to make it public." Steve hesitated, "he probably thought he could send me back. It was... a mistake? An accident."
When a member of the crew whose name Steve still didn't know announced on the internal communication line that Steve was being officially summoned by the capital, neither Steve, nor Tony were fit to appear in a polite society. Nethertheless, Steve tried to make himself presentable and took comfort in the fact that the collar of his uniform hid his painted neck when he sat in front of the comm. Vorromanof, frowning, looked back at him.
"Great. And people were trying to kidnap me for being strong and aging slowly?" asked the Captain, sarcastically.
The fact that Janet felt the need to console him after mistaking him for the Iron Man somehow just made everything worse. He wasn’t the Iron Man, not really. That was Tony.
Nothing happened for a few seconds, and then Steve felt like something pushed, grabbing him by his collar like a kitten and throwing him out the door. His chest around the reactor hurt, and his head was ringing, as if somebody just punched him. Steve swore, swayed on his feet and grabbed the corner of the table leaving deep dents from his metal fingers.
"Here are the messages, so I don't forget about them tomorrow," he handed Steve a couple of colored disks. "One is for my colleague on Athos, one is for your... what's his name now? Colonel Fury? Some people change names way too often. You are coming home at some point, right? Hand it to him then."
"So she is capable of speaking clearly after all! Thank you, Jarvis, especially for not dragging me from important business by my ears, even if I asked you to."
The mysterious 'he' also recognized them both and froze, not knowing who to start with. Then, he gave them a wide smile.
"You're upset I didn't call you?" Steve adjusted the phone and made himself comfortable on the bed. He didn’t say anything for a moment, then closed his eyes and continued, "Tony, I want to talk to him and learn everything I can. This is important."
Stark didn't have a talent for poetry, all his inclinations were towards development of technology. But he looked at the terminal, slowly breathed out, as if preparing to enter into a cold lake, and stroked the keyboard.
"The rest was easy," he muttered. "That thing in your chest, it's like a magnet for the armor. I could feel you from a mile away."
He caught Tony coming into the corridor. The man stumbled, surprised, and Steve pushed him into the room and slammed the door shut behind them.
"Are you trying to be friendly? Stop it," Tony snorted, watching Steve put aside his spoon. "That is worse than a glowing thing in your chest, right though? You haven't even seen all my childhood pictures – before Howard figured out how to make it see-through I was all blue like a freaking andorian."
"What?" asked Steve, confused. "Oh god, no. I'm not suggesting you shoot yourself. You've tried it?"
"That city's too big," answered Bruce, shaking his head. "Too many people, too many cars and airports around."
"I take it our roles in bed are pre-determined and not up to question," muttered Stark and threw his head back, following the hand that pulled his hair.
Finding his resolve, he leaned down and took the head of Tony's cock in his mouth. The smell of weaponry got stronger, but not unpleasant, and Stark groaned, clearly not out of pain.
"Do I look that smart? Nah, I just keep him company, or he'll drive everyone crazy with his nagging." Janet made a funny grimace. "Jesus, I'll put a stake in my own chest if I start understanding half of what Hank usually talks about."
Finally, Steve breathed out and stopped talking. He sat straight on the ground, hugging Bruce's shoulders and listening to him breathe. A couple of feet from them he noticed the glasses crushed and pushed into the ground.
They were slowly moving towards the exit, Steve carefully measuring each of his steps not to fall. Tony stepped away from him a bit, but was still holding his elbow.
"Listen, we've already established that you don't understand me, and I, surprisingly, don't understand you. But it doesn't stop us from rack our brains over intrigues – and it shouldn't stop us now," Stark murmured, quickly, like a tongue-twister. "Just keep kissing me like this, and everything will be fine."
Steve closed his eyes and opened them again, fighting the urge to stay in the cool pleasant darkness that wasn't burning his retina.
"Hulk," Steve corrected in a tired voice, before the monster had a chance to get mad again. "His name is Hulk."
This was the first time Steve saw Tony touch people, but he had no time to feel surprised, as in this moment Steve felt himself being twisted from the inside. The armor found him. Steve felt it, and it felt Steve.
In the end, Steve did go there, but the door was closed, and he didn't have the code. Steve couldn't see the light behind the darkened glass – neither the blue glow of the monitors, nor the white and yellow light of the overhead lamps, but Steve was still pretty sure Tony was there.
"Yes... No." He shook his head. "You're not interested in the company, you only do what you absolutely have to, and nothing else."
"Had enough of flying? I could've bet you'd spend half a day under the ceiling. That's what I did." Tony turned his head and adjusted the collar, as if he was hot. "At least, if you ignore the moments I was smashing into walls and breaking furniture. The first model was far from perfect."
Steve mentally went through possible explanations. Was it a disease? A mental disorder? A result of working with poisonous substances? Is that why doctor Banner was trying to run away?
"During the second world war," Steve started, looking at some point above Tony's shoulder, "there was a project called Rebirth. I'm not a scientist, so I don't know much about it, but it had something to do with a serum that could increase person's strength and endurance. They would get a super soldier, maybe even an army of super soldiers that could beat the fascist army."
The hand that touched him in the place that demanded attention for a while now, was a complete surprise.
Steve was on the verge of laughing, but he didn’t let out a sound, only came closer and sat down in front of the table. It probably looked weird from the outside – a human-shaped robot kneeling in front of a living person, but Steve didn't care. He raised the faceplate, took off part of the armor from his hand, just to touch another man's skin and feel the warmth of it.
"Oh for god's sake, shut up," Steve ignored the hurt look Tony gave him. "I'm not changing my mind, but there are two conditions. First, you don't hide anything. If you need access to the reactor to figure things out, just say it."
"Excellent," said Tony. He went to the exit, and Steve looked at his legs against his will – Tony didn't even have a limp.
Stark looked at the printed text, but in his mind he saw instead strokes, and swirls of his mother's elegant handwriting. He was angry.
Silence fell. Steve seriously considered saying no, but then remembered the small art shop on a quiet street in Brooklyn and, for some reason, Solomon's black dog.
"I shouldn't have either," admitted Steve. "I shouldn't have shared my highly valuable opinions on things I don't know anything about. And I can make sure you get your drinks, warmth and rest. If you let me, of course."
"Horrible," Stark winced. "Although, quite understandable from a historical point of view. So, you were born as a living proof of everything wrong with the natural reproduction. And?"
"That's what I suspected," Steve nodded and thought to himself that he wasn't actually against the idea, and it's not like Nat gave them any deadlines for those deliveries.
"They reported that the oldest head of Jackson's Whole houses is dead," answered Steve, slowly, "Baron Fell didn't get to me in time."
"Blue," Steve answered on a reflex. He was still feeling slow and half-asleep, although usually five or six hours of rest would be enough for him.
"Of course, not," Steve retorted. "You can lose your hand if you just leave it be. I've no idea, why you're still conscious, maybe it's the painkillers, but they'll stop working soon..."
Steve's sleep was actually deep and calm, probably for the first time in a few months.  He woke up around sunrise, feeling cold, shivered and only then opened his eyes. He turned his head, squinting in confusion at grey morning light, thinking the blanket must've fallen off him during the night when he was tossing and turning. It happened before.
It was still bright, the sun just started going down, and the earth was still emitting a pleasant warmth, so Steve decided against starting a fire just yet.
"The moon isn't bright enough," complained Stark, responsible for organizing all the festivities. "It should be more saturated. And don't tell me it's going to be fine the night of the festival, I'm not going to believe it. Why do I always have to do everything myself!"
"Taking a ride with the Iron Man," Barton grinned and adjusted the quiver on his back. "That'll be worth telling children."
He noticed Janet, Hank and Barton standing around him, and Hulk hovering over them all, hiding half of the sky from Steve's view.
"Me," answered Steve, absent-mindedly watching Janet and Hank, Clint with a red-haired woman he didn't recognize, thinking of Bruce sitting alone in the kitchen. "I think, sometimes it's good to have a team."
Steve pushed it all aside and turned, following the route the armor calculated, trying not to speed up too much. He was well aware of the speed the armor was capable of, his head was full of data: flight conditions, air resistance, the maximum height Steve could reach. He wondered, absent-mindedly, if Tony was seriously considering going into space, and then: god, he hoped Tony wasn't in trouble.
Steve listened to that feeling, trying to figure out what way he should be going. The armor was somewhere in the house. He went through the room, unsteadily, noticing Tony getting up in the corner of his eye, opened the door and went into the corridor. It was like a game, the only thing missing was Tony exclaiming 'hot' and 'cold'. The man didn't say anything, though, just looked at Steve with caution, making no attempts to stop him.
"I think we should go somewhere more comfortable. This corridor is too dusty. Serious conversations shouldn't take place among dirt and garbage." He nodded at Tony. "Bring him to my office."
"Alright," Tony put the glass aside and started drawing something on a tablet, just like that, with his hands in the air. As far as Steve understood his gestures, when the light showed the contours of his drawing, it was a schematic picture of the reactor. "What's the second condition?"
"How could you connect to it?" Tony immediately asked back. "How do you even know what it is? Did you have big human-like robots in the forties?" He rubbed his nose. "Did you have laser swords as well?" Despite trying to joke, Tony looked deadly serious. Steve sighed.
It felt like Steve instantly lost half his feelings and almost stumbled from the surprise of it. Tony was looking at him from a couple of feet away, and for a moment Steve thought his face showed regret and fear.
Tony sounded and looked (Steve couldn't see clearly, but he was pretty sure) completely unperturbed. Evidently, barging in into his guest's bedroom at five o'clock in the morning and having conversations in complete darkness was completely par for the course for him.
"He was cold once," grumbled the Cetagandan, pulling the blanket up to his ears. "Of course, seventy years in a cryochamber, anybody would get cold, even people on Kibou-daini wouldn't like it..."
"He left the workshop half an hour ago and went to his room," Jarvis adjusted the flower pot and slowly went towards the kitchen. "I would guess, Steven, you've time to catch him before he locks up."
Steve brought his shoulders together, feeling the tension in his back, then looked at the screen of his laptop that went dark while they were talking. The only source of light now was the red glow of the reactor in his chest.
"Then again, Pepper says I don’t take care of anything, I just come and yell and ruin my reputation," Tony continued. He moved to press something on the tablet, frowned, as if only now noticing his hands were occupied, and touched the screen with his nose. "As if it can be ruined any further."
Nevertheless, the book, colorful and frivolous, left the Captain with more questions than answers. Reading it was like trying to eat a meringue cake made of lead. Steve couldn't understand if the book was deliberately written in such a way, or if an actually quite normal text didn't resonate correctly with his psyche, disturbed by his conversation with the Consul.
"We'll get out a bit earlier," he said to the driver. If Janet was surprised, she didn't comment on it, until they left the taxi and started walking around the little streets.
"That's a shame. He should've come in. Alright, we'll invite him," Howard stood up and started walking around the table, remarkably resembling Tony during his 'interrogation'. "I asked Mio to send you to look for Steve. I've heard rumors he's finally been awaken, but I couldn't come check for myself. I try not to leave Escobar more than absolutely necessary: you think the mercenaries made your life difficult, multiply that by fifty and you'll know how I live."
Tony seemed to be thinking about it. He bit his finger, looked away, and brought his shoulders together. He obviously wanted to go the workshop as well and check that everything was working, but something, some distant feeling of responsibility, was stopping him.
That sounded quite reasonable. Steve remembered his body accommodating to the reactor and how long rehabilitation took the first time. The thought of going through it again made him feel weird, a strange mix of anxiety and excitement. He touched the metal piece in his chest in an anxious move that was instinctive, subconscious, like pulling your hair.
From what he managed to discover, there was no way that Captain Rogers, no matter how secret or mysterious his personal files were, ever worked for Jackson's Whole or had any connection to it at all. But then again, as of now, it was impossible to prove the opposite. The Captain's file was detailed only about the events of the last three months: the reasons for his wound and transfer to the headquarters were clear – Captain Rogers, though not a Vor, seemed to follow a similar bizarre code of honor that compelled him to protect the innocents even at the cost of his own life. Anything that happened before these three months, however, was described in simplest terms: he was born in the family of a simple soldier and a nurse, he was ill for a long time; when his father died in the line of duty, he decided to enroll in the academy and follow in his footsteps. After numerous failed attempts, he finally achieved his goal, and since then had been an excellent student in combat and all other types of training.
The road quickly stopped being so deserted: there were trees going along it, making it look like a living tunnel. Sometimes they passed by huge trucks and single cars, a couple of times Steve even noticed people riding bicycles. In the distance, there were animals on the pasture.
"Found it in a phonebook." Steve could almost hear Tony's smirk. "Bring Janet back, or Hank'll bite off my head, and I'm not quite sure I can grow a new one. I don't even wanna try."
Her gaze was jumping all over him, as if she was trying to recognize familiar features in the metal armor.
"I've read an interesting article written by your compatriot. There's a lot in it about symbolic meaning of the paint, but almost nothing about what's it made of and how it's applied."
"Not as much decided... and not as much to help. Let's say, I'm her eyes, ears and hands. I'm much more used to being the brains, so this is somewhat of a downgrade for me. But if an haut-lady wants something done, ghem-lords nod and do it. That's stronger than any personality."
Things went well until they reached one of the doors, it opened and a tall man with a cane stepped through. He looked out of place among broken beams and shattered windows, with his carefully pressed suit and a monocle. Like a ghost of times past.
"Well, you asked," Steve said, hoarsely, and proved to Stark that yes, he was a man of action. He pushed into the pliant but tight body, biting his lips, expecting Stark to start screaming, and he'd have to stop, which was not at all what he wanted... But Stark made no noises unbecoming of a ghem-lord, only breathed out, quickly, as if preparing to jump from a great height, and pushed his sharp nails into the Captain's back.
Steve felt completely empty. Tony's words buzzed in the air, but Steve couldn't understand him, instead hearing other commands. He reached for the bag on instinct.
"I don't understand," answered Steve, softly. He got no answer and, turning to Bruce, was surprised to notice that the man fell asleep in an uncomfortable position, with his head falling back. Steve sighed, carefully covered him with a blanket and took a couple sheets of paper and a pencil out of his backpack. He wasn't joking about the pictures.
"I," he hesitated. "I wanted to be an artist before..." Before the world war started, he almost said, but held himself in time. "Before I decided to enlist."
"You didn't literally drag me by my ears, though. So, you are perfectly capable of thinking and not just following the letter of your orders," Stark sighed. "I know you're constantly mocking me – and be my guest for that, but don't do anything like this again. I really need to get closer to that Barrayaran. Although, he doesn’t seem to be the person I'm looking for. Where's the message?"
"Show me someone Stark does get along with. If I had to make a list of people you should never have anything in common with, he'd be taking the first place."
"To keep it short, there's been a rumor circulating the galaxy for quite some time that Barrayarans learned to augment genetic faults in their children not while they were being constructed, but after the fact. It may not sound as important to you, but for the Empire..."
He lowered his bow, too, and was standing smirking with his hands crossed. The dim autumn sun was just starting to light his figure and clothes, making the cloth look dark purple.
"I never thought you were boring," declared Tony, with his teeth chattering and clearly too cold to resist any of Steve's ministrations. "But this won't do any good, other than making you cold and getting your suit wet. Besides, I have my own clothes here."
Rogers shook his head, briefly, throwing off the feeling. He found no guilt in his actions, and the Cetagandans, while they weren't enemies anymore, still couldn't be trusted.
"For what?" asked Tony with genuine surprise in his voice. "It was probably really hard to keep silent all this time. I have..."
Steve remembered for some reason how he touched Tony's hand after their fight with Hulk and felt like something burned his fingers – maybe that was the armor in action. The picture in his mind of a young Tony avoiding contact with anyone was too real to just brush away.
They ate in silence, and then Bruce brought the pickup on a highway and pushed the gas hard making the pickup rattle thrice as much. Steve spread the map on his knees and was studying it carefully.
"How can I be sure?" Stark smirked. "Nobody thought of putting a prophetic device in me, what an oversight on their part. Stop talking, will you? I thought you were a man of action."
The whole situation was making Steve mad. He wasn't used to doing nothing when his friends needed help, and that was exactly what Tony asked him to do. Steve was basically shaking from how useless he felt. All his training yelled at him that he needed to put a splint on the hand, clean the wound and immediately get a doctor.
The muscles under his hand went through another spasm. Bruce curled around himself even tighter, clenching his teeth so hard Steve could almost hear it. He was breathing heavily – like a dog, with loud noises erupting from his chest every timed he seemed to have almost forcefully pushed air into his lungs and let it out.
She didn't sound displeased by it, more flirtatious. The girls in the dance rooms used to talk like that, Steve recalled, when soldiers were asking them to dance. They almost always refused Steve.
"Not really," Steve grinned. "Ethanol doesn't work on me. At least, not in the way that it does on my compatriots. But it can still warm me up. And cognac has an additional advantage of a nice smell."
"A lot of people," muttered Vorbarton, perfectly aware of all the people who wouldn't mind putting Cetaganda and Barrayar against each other and benefitting from the occurring chaos.
Steve raised his eyebrows, unconsciously copying Tony's expression when he heard somebody telling him bullshit.
Eventually, the conversations touched upon biotechnology. Enough time had passed that it wasn't considered something like dangerous magic on Barrayar, but the Cetagandan Empire was still miles ahead of anyone else.
"Got any requests?" Tony drove into the roadway almost without looking and pushed the gas. Steve expected the car to jerk from such treatment, but it started quite smoothly.
The news talked more about the airport next to it, and not the actual city. Steve remembered, because it happened a couple of days after he ended up here, and he was clinging to all information he got his hands on.
The view from the windows in Doctor Faustus' office opened unto Central Park. Steve gave a hollow laugh, covering his face with a hand.
"Yeah, I shouldn't have hoped you'll have a date that’s not your work," Clint made a sour face. "Well, have fun with your reading. I'll go home, too, and try not to lose my mind. It's my youngest daughter’s birthday next week, and everyone's already going crazy," he lamented.
"Alright," Steve felt like he was dreaming the kind of dream where impossible things are masking as real. Nevertheless, he was curious about having a conversation with a telepath.
"Howard said," Tony remarked in a thoughtful voice, "that there's nothing bad in average, if you do understand you're average."
"I could knock you out right now and leave you here," said Banner in a grim voice when they were at the door. "But then nobody would find you, and another death will be on my conscience." He kept moving without a glance behind.
Tony wasn't moving. His left hand was a bloody mess: the sight of torn pieces of metal piercing his skin made Steve's head feel fuzzy. Doing nothing any longer seemed impossible, and Steve did the only thing he could think of: he connected to the armor.
At that moment, the door opened, and a huge cage passed through, the person holding it barely visible behind it. Janet excused herself and rushed to help put it in one of the vaults.
"You'll solve your problem," he said. "You won't have to kill me, you'll just get rid of me, of your potential death."
Steve's fingers touched the zipper of his hoodey, and he pulled the handle down and started to take it off. Tony's eyebrow went even higher, but he still didn't say anything.
"I also don't like oatmeal. And smelling food in the morning. I don't like small animals, the board of directors and the French who pretend not to understand English."
"To properly get you acquainted with out world," Tony hummed, "Jarvis says you liked the library, right?" Steve nodded. "And you haven't even seen my movie collection yet."
"I didn't have time to finish your armor," said Tony, pausing next to him. "If not your darling friend Hulk, I'd have more time, but I was busy repairing my own."
"How was it the last time?" Tony retorted with his own question. He was slowly pulling half-transparent gloves onto his hands. "How do operations normally go? You fall asleep, and then you wake up with a new shiny plate in your chest."
Hulk breathed out again, and Steve turned back to Tony and recoiled from him the moment he saw him: the armor was disassembling by itself; various parts were coming apart and flying away, falling on the grass. In less than a minute the only part of it left were the plates around Tony's left hand that were probably damaged too much to come off.
Steve bought a full canister of gas and went back to Bruce, who was mindlessly turning the control wheel of the radio. There was only rattling sound coming from it – either this place had no reception, or the radio was broken.
"People are disgusting," he sighed, at last. "They're disgusting, 'cause they have a tendency to die."
"Master is waiting for you in the drawing room," he said, opening the door wide in front of Steve and quickly disappearing in the dim corridor. The mansion's big windows were covered by heavy curtains that made one of the walls look like it was made out of fabric.
Tony didn't try to be witty anymore, he was concentrating hard, his eyebrows drawn together, his eyes dark, he was clearly in pain. He couldn't not be in pain, whatever he said and however well he managed to hold himself.
Steve appreciated his consent with great enthusiasm. He had a half-formed thought in his head, that all this was undignified for a Barrayaran officer, but... the hotter the kisses got, the louder moaned Stark, the less attention he paid to it, until there was none left, melting like an icicle in boiled water.
"I'll... have to think about it," Vorromanof nodded, slowly, as if moving underwater. "Later. When I process the fact that I tried to set you up with women who are five times younger than you are. Anyway, I don't know why Baron Fell told so much to his mercenaries, I would've went with 'find him and bring alive', but they knew why their employer needed you. I don't know what kind of contracts they had, but, learning that you disappeared from the planet in an unknown direction, they almost tried to kill themselves. Those are serious people, practically samurai."
"Jarvis," said Tony, "this is Steve. I'd say you'll get along, but I don't like to share. Steve, have you eaten?" Without waiting for Steve’s answer, he addressed Jarvis again, "make us some snacks, we'll be in the drawing room."
Steve blinked. The phone - a small plastic contraption with a bright screen - Ben gave him the moment they left the house. He said that was a way of contacting him and promised to show how to use, but didn't really come about to do that.
He opened and closed them a few times, and then, without a warning, pulled a piece of metal out of his hand. Even Steve felt nauseous, and Bruce straight up rushed to the bushes.
'Colonel,' noted Steve. Strange or not, the ghem-lord's rank was clearly awarded for more than his beautiful eyes. Though they were, of course, worthy of attention: big and changing under a certain light from black to dark-blue or brown.
Stark tried to fight the urge to run his fingers through Steve's shortly trimmed hair and the urge, understandably, won.
The new Consul, as if just waiting to be mentioned, appeared by the side and threw back his head, looking at the night sky.
"Reed's a great guy, but he's most likely convinced he's doing you a favor by leaving you in an empty flat all alone," Tony turned his head and gave him a wide smile. "You know, silence, no annoying people around, nothing stopping you from doing science. The fact that not all people are scientists on this planet skips his head all the time, and it's no use explaining that to him." Tony took a breath. "In other words, nope, I came on my own."
"Yes," Steve nodded and tried not to squirm. An already piercing gaze of the Cetagandan turned almost palpable, as if trying to size up and dismantle every piece of him. "I wasn't aware of the details of their work, but you can see the result for yourself. And as soon as the result was there, strange accidents started happening around the lab. First, some guys from Security appeared and announced that I was accepted into the Academy, to keep an eye on me, among other things, of course. Then, they said the scientists shouldn't publish their results, but to quietly surrender it to the state. But which one? Why not the one, whose citizen they unlawfully experimented on? I don't know if they agreed."
His gaze was not unkind, but still careful and sharp.  Steve suspected, if Happy had some objections against him living here, he'd be already on the ground with his face pressed to the floor.
"That your servant, under your orders, infiltrated an imperial replicator bank closed for the night armed with vials of substances with proved teratogenic qualities and tried to break into the nutrient supply system to insert there what he brought in."
Steve finished making the coffee and handed the cup to Tony, who was half-asleep supporting his head with his hand.
But that wasn't what made Steve afraid now. He was still clinging to the possibility of returning to his old life, and he understood that changing himself now would also make him useless for his own world, in addition to how he already felt useless to this one. He wouldn't be able to pilot his giant robot anymore; he wouldn't be able to help his country win the war.
When the suit finally came back, Janet was almost calm and barely shaking in Steve's hands. He had to move away for the man to give Janet water, and the suit pulled him to the side.
"I hope so," called Stark, somberly, from the inside. "Steve, the lock is electrical. And it is somehow fine, unlike all the rest! Damn Justin!" Steve didn't know that Cetagandan, but he could understand Stark's outrage. "The holding force is about three hundred kilograms. Can you tear it open?"
They stopped. The dust was settling down, and high grass was coming through windows – they rode into a field.
Jarvis was half-leaning on the back of a couch, kept in place by something looking like a force field. Despite that, however, the ba didn't look like it was resisting, it didn't even move, just looked at everything with its curious cold blue eyes. It didn't resemble the Consul, or even his distant relative, it looked more like a part of Steve's family with its fair hair and blue eyes, its classically beautiful face and a vertical worry line between its eyebrows.
Tony raised his eyebrows, but didn't have time for another quip - Reed pushed his wheelchair out of the kitchen. When the sound of the moving wheelchair was replaced by the voices from behind a closed door, Ben raised his shoulders.
"A fundamental law of the universe, Captain Rogers. We are polar opposites, we came here together from another world, and we are obviously connected. The question is, what are possible consequences of that connection, and I don't want to risk it. Do you?"
It was just a theory, a blind belief of a soldier that guns meant protection. Steve himself knew that feeling of anger leaving him and settling down somewhere inside when he touched the cold metal of the armor.
The view of the city from the roof was marvelous, but Steve was more drawn to the helicopters - the shadows from their wide blades were drawing lines on the ground. If they had these machines during the war...
"I'll remember that," he looked down at his tablet and scrolled through something. "My internal clock says it's evening, but the day's just started. I don't like working during daylight. I think sun is better used as a source of energy, not a source of light."
"You know why I am thinking about ramps? Because when you and Sue finally have kids, she'll be the first, well, second, to hate you for their absence."
"Tired?" Steve took out a small pack that had some sandwiches in it, divided them and gave half to Bruce. The man nodded his thanks.
"For you, Athos is probably a synonym to hell," commented Tony, sarcastically. He was anxiously pulling at his hair and enviously eyeing Howard's short trim.
"It is hard to say. Normally, hand-made gifts considered to have artistic value by default. But I am not aware of talents attributed to Barrayaran people, and even less so about yours."
There was a stadium-sized space under the house with a mysterious shining blue device in the center of it.
He suddenly felt free, all the panic and fears of the last couple of days were gone. He made a final decision, just the way he used to decide everything before, and whatever the situation would bring, it couldn't be any worse.
He went around Steve and stood next to the armor hanging in the alcove. Nothing happened for a couple of seconds, and then the armor's dark eye sockets glowed with soft blue light.
Steve stood in front of Hank and Janet, repulsor glowing on his raised hand. It was nothing serious, just the light, but it could be taken as a warning.
He locked the phone and looked at Steve, the expression on his face soft and thoughtful. Steve already saw him looking like that, but this was the first time it was for him.
"Smart," Steve closed his eyes and finished his coffee in two swallows, treating it like medicine, the only difference being it left a sticky sweet taste in his mouth instead of sour. "Then, can we go check the armor?”
Steve rubbed his temples. Reed said his condition resembled depression, but he also concluded that it was expected. Then again, Steve didn't particularly trust Reed's opinion. The man understood machines far better than humans.
On the other hand, it was good Reed wasn't here. Otherwise, it was likely Faustus would target him as well.
He turned the wheelchair around, quite awkwardly; one could guess he hadn’t gotten used to dealing with it just yet.
"If you knew him, that means you're at least ninety. And your dad took no part in that unpleasant story, didn't he? He really died in the line of duty, just really long ago, in your second conflict with us... or during the Great War?"
"The old Fell, yeah? He was grasping at straws, these last few years," Howard sighed, as if pitying the man. "Trust me, Steve, it might offend you, but there are many more interesting people, than you are in this world. At least, in scientific sense. Anyway, Tony was supposed to find you, and you both were supposed to find me."
"That's true," the man nodded. "You see, it's much closer to the haut race genetically than I am. A lot of changes in my genome were tested on it beforehand, which makes Jarvis almost my relative in my eyes, even though such attitude is unpopular back home. Trying to test its blood, you would interfere with my mother's work and... well, at the least, infringe upon her intellectual property," he smirked.
She jumped, without waiting for his answer, and Steve had to grab her elbow to stop her. He took out a crumpled bill and left it on the table.
The moons practically seemed to be saffron and lilac, which caused an unpleasant association with the face paint of ghem-lord Rau in Steve's mind. He didn't know him personally, of course, but the lord already had an unpleasant influence on his way of thinking. That valuable association, however, Steve decided not to share with his friend.
Steve carefully landed on the terrace and froze awkwardly when a myriad of ants scattered away from him. A brightly colored bird flew from one of the trees, and Steve noticed a butterfly on the petals of a huge flower. If he understood correctly, it wasn't just a garden on a terrace, but a continuation of Hank's lab.
"Alright," he squinted like a pleased cat. "I have an italian place in mind, how about we go there?"
Steve expected to Tony to go for the reactor as soon as he crossed the threshold of his house, but the man seemed in no hurry. He didn't do anything for a few more days: the next morning after the movies Tony was nowhere to be seen, and Steve used the time to explore the ground surrounding the mansion. The building looked monstrous, to Steve, too old-fashioned. It would seem gigantic even to a whole family, let alone just two or three people. Most of the rooms weren't even open, the right wing was deserted. Steve felt a bit like a character in a horror movie.
"And that's it," said Tony, smug, buttoning up his sleeve. "It's a good thing Mister Hulk didn't tear it off completely. I hate when it happens, building up the muscle mass is the most tiresome thing. Awfully boring."
