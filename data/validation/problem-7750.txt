“My father… My father was a brilliant man in many ways.” Tony hesitated for a moment before deciding that if he couldn’t be honest with his husband about this, who could he be. “He was horrible in many, many others. For one, being King.” Tony scoffed. “The only thing my father ever truly cared about was money. Earning it, keeping it, and making more of it. He would do anything for money. Even betray his own people, not to mention his family.”
Tony turned his eyes back to his husband-to-be. Steven was pouring them more meed and Tony could make out what appeared to be a satchel beside the goblets. Steven was still using the goblet Tony had given him and he had pulled out another one for Tony. Steve gently replaced the pitcher and gathered up goblets and the satchel. He turned and slowly made his way over to Tony. Steven sat down and held out the plainer of the two goblets to Tony.
Steve dropped Tony’s hand and made his way over to the group of people milling about the table. He walked over to the woman, bypassing the cluster of old men surrounding her and bent nearly in half to kiss her check. When Steve pulled back, the woman reached out a thin arm and gently cupped his check.
Steve reached the top of the rubble pile and slowly slid down the other side to reach a large hole in the side of a building. About half way down, Peter's still developing motor skills failed him and his bag of cheerios slipped from his grip. Steve adeptly reached down and caught the bag eliciting a high pitched squeal of delight from his baby son who then proceeded to laugh and clap his hands together in excitement. Steve had become so used to this over the past hour that his son's actions didn't surprise him in the least. However the increase in noise doubled Steve's desire to get out of the open as quickly as possible.
Tony looked over at his son and partner.
Tony nodded his understanding and Steven smiled brightly at him again. It made Tony’s knees a little weak.
Tony cursed internally. He hesitated a moment before answering his son’s question.
Once Pepper and Rhodey had moved aside, Steven grabbed Tony’s hand gently.
Sarah, having somehow sensed her fathers’ presence and Steve’s proximity, untangled her little arms from her Uncle’s neck and formal shirt to reach meekly out to Steve.

“What?!” Tony cried, his entire body reaching out to his lover as if to implore him to reconsider. Not that the genius would ever do that…or at least not yet.
“….Ok” Steve said hesitantly.
"She's already ours isn't she?" Tony asked half relieved and half terrified at the idea of being the father of two small children.
Tony let out a real, healthy laugh at that before agreeing. He slowly got up, taking his son with him and went to grab his daughter from her chair before taking them both to bed. The three of them curled up and took a well deserved and very restful nap on Steve and Tony’s giant mattress.
“Its terrible.” Tony finally said, shattering the silence of the house. “They’re all dead. The other Avengers. Our team. Their bodies are scattered all over the place.”
Tony looked up expecting to see disappointment on Steve’s face, but instead he found that softness that absolutely could not be affection. It was far too soon for that. Lust Tony could understand, and felt plenty of. Affection was something you reserved for someone important, not for someone you were arranged to marry.
“I agree.” Steve said.
“Tony!” Steve yelled, turning to fully face his partner, while their infant son looking tiredly between his parents with a pacifier in his mouth and an elephant plushy clutched tightly in his little arms.
Tony sat up and took the goblet from Steven.
Steve smiled down at him. “Yes, it does. My great grandsire founded the city. This mountain is full of caves and he chose and expand this one for his home.”
“Steve.” Tony whined. “You said you’d fuck me when we weren’t out in the open.” Tony spread his legs wider, letting the scent of his building slick build. “We’re not in the open anymore.”

It was then that Steve noticed the small embroidered words on the edge of the baby blanket. Steve gently ran his finger over it but couldn't make any sense of the foreign language. He was almost sure that he had seen the name before, but couldn't quite place where. In a moment of inspiration, Steve remembered that the words had been on a large sign above what had probably once been the entrance to the building. Realizing that he would have to wait for Tony to translate the words for him, Steve gently picked up the small infant and prepared to move out.
“If you need me pull your rope ok. I’ll be right down here faster than you can blink.”
“Bull shit.” Tony interrupted, leaning in towards his partner slightly.
“It would appear so.” He replied.
Steve chuckled and smiled at the exchange. The two of them were adorable and he just couldn't seem to bring himself to put the baby down, though he knew he had to in order to make sure that the baby was unharmed and warm.
Sarah began to rise from her chair, but stumbled slightly. Steve and his uncle both rushed to help her, but Steve got there first and gently caught his mother.
“And, language!” The Captain proclaimed at the same volume.
“You should eat something and then we should dance.” She stated once she saw she had his attention.
“Thank you.” Tony said. He then leaned up and kissed Steve’s cheek. “Return to me soon, Steven.”
It was chaste at first, but the heat grew and grew between them. Before he knew it, both of Steve’s hands were cupping Tony’s face and Tony’s own hands were tangled in Steve’s blond hair, pulling him in closer. Their tongues danced back and forth between their open mouths and Tony could feel the beginning of wetness at his entrance.
Tony smiled as he stepped out into the hall and gently closed the door behind him. The smile quickly fell when his eyes landed on Steve again.
Steve and Tony shared a look. They hadn't actually thought that far yet. Tony was still mildly panicking at the idea of two babies being in the house. Well, at least this one wasn't exhibiting any signs of powers…yet.
Steve softened slightly, cause in a way he did see Tony’s point. Even if part of him, the part of him who was still that poor city boy from days long gone who dreamed of fighting for what he believed in, still didn’t fully believe that he was doing everything he should. But that hardly mattered when his partner said those things and made the part of Steve that was more and more becoming a part of the 21st century melt a little. For now, he could let the part of him that still doubted go, just for Tony. He might not fully believe it just yet, but Tony had a way of convincing him about most things and Steve was sure that this would be one of them.
“It is an honor to meet you, Clinton.”
However, before the super soldier had time to act upon his plan, he noticed the metallic glitter of some sort of projectile moving towards him out of the corner of his eye. Acting on instinct, Steve turned his back towards the attacker and curled his body protectively around his young son and the baby, clutching them both as tightly as he dared.
It had been almost a month since Steve and Tony had brought home their new baby daughter. The media in particular had a field day with the story of the super hero couple’s new baby girl. The public was practically drooling over the images of the baby that Steve and Tony had begrudgingly released at the insistence of Pepper, who had astutely said that the media would not leave them alone until they got a glimpse of the baby the media had taken to calling “America’s new Sweat Heart”.
“Anything for you, Tony. Anything.”
When he finally couldn't put off leaving any longer, Steve regretfully took one of the couple’s private planes and headed for the battlefield. He was desperately worried about Tony and willed himself to resolve the situation as quickly as possible so he could return home and take care of his family.
Another yell of “Kitty” came from the hall leading to the throne room and was soon followed by an exuberant two year old with light blond hair tied up in pigtails and a pair of gray blue eyes. The sight immediately brought a bright smile to the young King’s face.
"Yes, well I was a little preoccupied wasn't I?" Steve said angrily as he gestured sharply with his free hand to the small children he had shielded.
Ah, Tony understood now. Thor had explained this too and had entrusted the intricately carved silver goblet to Rhodey for safe keeping. Another old tradition about the man closest to the person being the one to hold the gifts for their intended. Thor told Tony that after their “hand fasting”, Tony refused to believe the what they actually called it, there would be an exchanging of gifts where Rhodey was to give Tony the goblet and after filing it with mead Tony was to offer it to his husband and say his name. This was somehow supposed to solidify their marriage. Tony really was so confused about all of this stuff. The Celts had some weird traditions.
Steve wove a hand into Tony’s hair, the other securely wrapped around his lower back, and his face pressed against the top of his partner’s head.
At one point Steve had to intervene when Tony really wanted to name her Talon and remind his lover that they were trying to keep their child from hating them.
Tony flashed Steve a cocky smirk and was met in turn by an angry scowl. Tony's smile slipped immediately and he realized a little belatedly that he was in a lot more trouble than he thought.
“No!” Captain America declared firmly before turning around to place the now nodding off Peter in his crib.
Tony cut him off when they reached the door with a quick "bye" to Thor and then he practically shoved his partner outside.
Steve's smile was as bright as a thousand Suns.
Steve furrowed his brow slightly and bit his bottom lip nervously. He reached out for his daughter and Natasha, somewhat reluctantly, handed her to him.
“Are you coming, Betrothed?” Steve asked from several paces away from Tony’s horse, hand offered out to him.
“Peter.” King T’Challa chastised firmly. “Minister Ku means you and your sister no harm. Isn’t that right minister Ku?” King T’Challa declared, turning the full force of his authoritative and protective gaze on the old man.
“The town of the ford?” Tony questioned.
"Oh, so she will hate us for naming her Sarah hm?" Steve said, almost daring Tony to disagree with him again.
“Would you like to see more?”
Tony smiled down at his partner. Oh how he loved this man. He leaned down and kissed Steve tenderly, telling him in his own special way that he loved him more than anything. Once Tony leaned back from the kiss, Steve looked back at him and smiled.
Steve beamed. “I love you.”
Thor would soon regret ever letting his friends talk him into babysitting.
Steve looked like he was on the verge of crying.
The final piece fell into place for Tony. “We’ve met before.” Tony paused. “Or I at least saw you across the ballroom one night in my father’s palace. Though I remember the name Natalia floating round the rumor mill around that time.”
Clint snorted as Tony passed him on his way to the table. “Just because your sweater says ‘Queen’ doesn’t make you one.”
King T’Challa was moments away from putting the fool of a man in his place and marching over to the landing pad to beg for his friends forgiveness when a commotion caught his attention.
“I-“ Tony paused. He could not tell Steve any of this. He couldn’t show this weakness. “Etruscans are exclusively monogamous in marriage. I… I take that commitment seriously.”
between them.
“What was your father like?” Steve asked innocently.
Ah. That explained the closeness he had noticed between Steve and the man he had called Bucky earlier.
Instead of taking his anger out on his friends after the horrendous woman had left, Tony channeled his emotions into teasing Fury about his protectiveness.
Steve still looked like he was rethinking the whole idea of a "night out" when Tony placed a hand on his lower back.
Peter’s little face contorted into the kind of fury that T’Challa had never seen on a child, and honestly had no desire to ever see again.
Once the door was closed behind him, Tony moved to begin unpacking his first trunks. He opened the latched to see which one was on top and found it filled with his personal attire. It was a mix of a few Etruscan style clothing the mainland Celts had smuggled out of his home for him, and the style of clothing favored by his adopted people. Tony began placing his clothing in the armoire along side his betrothed’s. By the time he was finished, the armoire was alarmingly full.
"I'm kidding! KIDDING!" Said Thor, erratically gesturing with the hand that wasn't clutching his young nephew who had been looking back and forth between his father and his uncle in interest.
Tony slowly entered and walked over to one of the windows. He could see the sea beyond them through the pane. It allowed sunlight into the room that lit the space. Tony turned back to take in the rest of the room. It was rather sparsely furnished, but the furs and the large bed made the large room feel cozy.
This ended up backfiring because Tony, as it turned out, couldn't decide between their two top picks. Finally after getting tired of Tony's complaining, and due to their near imminent arrival at shield headquarters, Steve intervened yet again.
Steve gave him a strange look. It seemed like a mix of pity on confusion. Steve opened his mouth to say something, but was interrupted from a barrage of sound.
The Parkers had been old friends of Tony's and when they had come to Tony and Steve with their young son begging them to protect him, Steve and Tony were more than happy to do everything they could. Including adopting the young child when his entire biological family were murdered by Hydra. Thankfully, Richard and Mary Parker had kept Hydra from knowing that they had a son and were able to entrust Peter to Steve and Tony before it was too late.
“What’s going on?”
“Nothing that wouldn’t have happened anyway.” Tony replied in a sharp, decisive tone.
It took more willpower than the King dared to admit for his eyes to move up from the breast plate to his face. The sky blue eyes he found there bore into his even from across the expanse of the throne room. To anyone else those eyes would only show determination and fierceness, but the King has seen those eyes filled will more emotion than anyone else. He knew what those eyes looked like above him and filled with passion, he knew what they looked like when brimming with love and the joy of fatherhood, and he knew what they looked like when consumed by hurt and anguish. He could see that now. The same hurt and anguish they had shown when the man had betrayed him, but now there was a heaviness to them that the King was unfamiliar with. A weight that had settled on the man’s soul.
As their party finally emerged completely from the trees, Tony could make out just the edge of the ocean and a stone peer jutting out into it from the heart of the village. Tony looked back towards the trees and could see where the black sand beach curved back out towards the sea and rose into high cliffs covered in the same thick forest they had just traveled through. As he observed, their party continued riding through the tall grasses dotted with the last wildflowers before fall truly took hold.
Tony cleared his throat abruptly. “Rise and speak.”
“Tony.” Steve murmured almost reverently as he leaned back and started kissing Tony again.
Jarvis, Tony’s personal manservant, opened the door slightly as he spoke. “I’m sorry to disturb you, your Majesty. The prince was asking for you.”
After Thor left none other than Pepper and Rhodey made their way over to them. Pepper and Rhodey approached the two of them before dropping to one knee, right arm parallel to the ground with their heads down.
“Oh yeah? Well then, where’s your throne, your Majesty?” Clint snarked.
"If this is an orphanage, then why would they leave her here?" Steve asked, unconsciously reaching up to touch Peter. "I mean look at her. She's tiny. She can't be more than a few weeks old."
The baby’s cries were so loud that Steve and Tony could hear it both echoing from the hall and emanating from the electronic device that the younger man was now glaring at. He was silently hoping it would be one of those times when their infant daughter just needed to voice some complaint or another for a minute before falling back asleep. Unfortunately for Tony, it was not one of those times.
Steve was incredibly weary of how much the general public already knew about his family and he was not about to let them even further into their private lives without a fight. However, he knew that he would eventually have to give in since Tony himself was an incredibly public figure even before becoming Iron Man. It was only expected that the same fate would befall the Rogers-Stark children.
“My King, there is a dispute in the village near Dugan’s place. They need you to come at once.” The boy said, his chest heaving from having run there.
Peter was just waking up from his nap and was staring bleary eyed up at Steve who smiled back at his baby boy. Peter reached up his arms weakly, a silent message for Steve to pick him up. Steve complied and reached down to pick up his young son. Peter, it turned out was still clutching his stuffed elephant teddy bear. Steve chuckled slightly and then deposited Peter on one of his hips, balancing the toddler expertly as he moved over to the makeshift crib to check on his new baby girl.
“How about you start with why you’re back here after two years.” Tony snapped, his head turning to stare at Steve even though his face remained completely passive.
"Yes, of corse. What was it you wanted me to translate?" Tony supplied quickly.
Tony dutifully made his way towards his betrothed, striding purposefully through the gap the onlookers had made for him. He reached up and placed his hand in Steve’s before bowing at the waist.
“Enjoying the view?” Tony questioned smugly.
It was on one of the nights that Tony returned home particularly late from work that he finally had enough. He had come home to a dark house, their children already having been asleep for hours and Steve himself appearing to have gone to bed already. The genius had tiredly made his way up the stairs and down the extensive hall to the master bedroom, silently cursing how far away his comfy bed and sexy lover were from the garage.
“Its amazing.” Tony murmured.
Natasha turned her eyes back to Tony. They were silent for a moment, just taking each other in. There was a silent agreement between the two of them. They would keep each other’s secrets in this court. After all, there was an almost mutually assured destruction for the two of them if the wrong person caught wind of what the other knew.
He held out the hoodie and watched as Steve threw it on haphazardly before grabbing his and Tony’s plates and walking away, the bright white “King” printed on the back proudly displayed.
The old Minister looked at his King, the anger still lingering in his gaze, before acquiescing.
“There is no need for that, my King.” Tony said.
Tony peaked inside the two trunks on either end of the armoire and found the one on the left hand side filled with cloaks and other common items and the one to the right was filled with shining armor on top of which was a large circular shield with a star emblazoned on it. Tony carefully closed the trunk again. He then moved the empty trunk by the door to be dealt with later.
“Its a torc.” Steve said, his hand coming up to feel his own silver necklace. “it is an exact match to mine. I had heard from my cousin that one of your family colors was gold, so I had my finest smith forge it in your metal.”
“Wait. May I ask your name?” Tony said.
In lieu of a vocal response, Steve leaned in and kissed Tony lovingly. He had learned a long time ago that the ex-playboy was a much more physical creature than he himself was and Steve knew that sometimes actions spoke louder than words with this man.
Tony searched Steve’s face for any kind of lie. How could this man want to know more about Tony’s people than how to conquer them? He had heard tales about what a skilled warrior the High King of Ireland was and the other rumors that he was a kind and just man had drawn Tony to him above any other warrior King he heard tell of, but this was a surprise.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good morning, Beloved.” Steve murmured.
to watch as his fiancé finished undressing. Steve was dressed in the usual loose pants that the Celts favored for sleep, but he had apparently elected against the usual loose fitting tunic they also wore. His back was mesmerizingly beautiful, broad, and muscular. Tony wanted to claw at that expanse of smooth skin as the alpha’s cock pounded into him, but that probably wasn’t going to happen tonight with the tension that had built between them on the walk here.
“Ok.” Tony agreed.
Tony took a deep breath before speaking. “Very well. Lord Commander Rhodes will assign you your post. Now I think I will retire.”
“Really?” Tony shook his head and raised his hand to silence Steve’s pitiful attempts at protest. “You and I can discuss this latter because clearly I won’t be getting any sleep until we do, but right now OUR son needs me.”
“You are a strong, intelligent, loving man who I honestly don't deserve” Tony hesitated for a moment, his body slightly curling in on himself as if afraid he had just shared a bit too much of his inner demons, even if it isn’t the first time he’s said this to him. “You do so much for me and our children.” He hesitated again, his hands coming to rest on his knees and squeezing tightly. “I hate it that you don’t see yourself the way I do. You bring as much, if not more, to our family than I do. Yes, I have a lot of money. Too much money for all of us to use in several life times and the amount just keeps growing. So let me do something useful with it, like taking care of the people I love.” Tony implored, looking to his partner like a kicked puppy.
"Has he been like this the whole time?" Tony asked. A combination of exasperation, humor, and wariness tinging his voice.
“And it's exactly the right size.” Tony purred while Steve choked on his eggs behind him.
“Steve!” He cried in a nearly desperate voice.
Steve turned to look at Tony, a smile plastered on his face.
Tony grabbed the discarded black hoodie and internally cursed Steve for his lack of enthusiasm for Tony’s attempt to one up Clint. That bird brain would not get one over on Tony. He would ensure that his gag gift failed spectacularly by fully leaning into the dumb joke. Tony had already used U to take a whole bunch of pictures in his own white hoodie, making sure that the “Queen” and crown design on the back was prominently featured. He had also recruited Jarvis to take candids of he and Steve together when Steve was wearing his matching black “Kins” hoodie, but the blonde kept “forgetting” to wear his. Tony was sure that Steve was doing it on purpose, but could not figure out why his Husband refused to assist him in this endeavor.
At this point he turned back to the very disgruntled and enraged minister, his arms full of the Rogers-Stark children. He was officially back in King mode.
“If you really must complain about a failed sexual endeavor to our infant daughter then I think you need some time to learn a lesson.” He declared when he turned back around to face Tony.
Tony’s hands moved up to grip Steve’s hair tightly. Steve leaned farther in, his breath ghosting across Tony’s face before he moved to kiss the hinge of his jaw. Tony whimpered softly. He wanted Steve’s fingers to press harder against his bonding gland, but he also wanted Steve’s lips to kiss down his neck. He wanted Steve to bite him, milk his bonding scent from the gland, and forge a mating bond between the two of them. Tony’s legs started spreading of their own accord at the same moment that Steve pulled completely away from him.
“Áth Cliath.” Steve replied.
Tony nodded. “I was, thank you.”
“Hmm. I’m not so sure about that. I think I’ve got a whole meal right in front of me.” Tony replied. “But you would look better wearing this.” Tony moved one of his arms away and untied the black hoodie from his waist. “After all, what’s a queen without his king.”
“Clinton Barton.” The man replied.
"…And make sure Peter doesn't get into the cupboards again. Last time we had to re-buy everything. Emergency numbers are on the fridge. And…" Steve continued.
Steve was shaking. He didn’t know how Tony had managed this long without completely falling apart. If he had to experience what the younger man had just described over and over again, he would have fallen apart long before now. And he knew that the images Tony was painting for him were nothing compared to what he actually experienced every night. He could imagine himself in Tony’s place and could only conclude that he would have spent every night clutching his partner’s dead body desperately and calling out to him over and over. And the little ones, his babies. The mere notion of clutching the lifeless forms of his infant daughter and young son was soul shattering. That was the moment Steve realized for certain that Tony was infinitely stronger than he ever would be.
“Promise that you wont ever leave me.” Tony begged in the faintest whisper against the base of Steve’s neck.
Steve looked from his daughter to his friend and then back again, asking with his eyes what she meant by that statement. Tony was looking the most helpless King T’Challa had ever seen him.  So, in an attempt to help his friend, he handed Tony his young son before replying to Steve’s unasked question.
“Uncle Kitty!” Little Peter Rogers-Stark cried excitedly.
Steve only nodded and followed Tony up to what used to be their chambers. Tony checked over his shoulder as why went up the stairs and noted the reassuring shadow of two guards standing outside the door at the bottom of the stairs. It had become something of a habit after the war started to always check the guards were still there after putting Peter to bed. Tony couldn’t help the feeling that there was another enemy lurking out there and something told him that when they came Peter would be in the line of fire. It ate at his stomach in a way even having Steve back in their space couldn’t hold a candle to.
“Tony.” Steve said plaintively. “No. I won’t fuck you until I’m sure you really want me to.”
Steve sighed heavily. “Not tonight, my omega.” Steve leaned in and chastely kissed Tony’s forehead.
“Tony. Please, if I am to call you Steve, call me Tony.”
“Steven, I offer this goblet as a symbol of how our pairing with be full and sustaining.” Tony said.
About a month had passed since that night when Tony had finally confided in Steve. Tony had improved greatly over that time, but there were still occasions where he was blindsided by a particularly clear image from his vision and would freeze up in panic. On these occasions it would take him hours, sometimes days, to regain his footing again. It had been a few days since the last occasion on which Tony had experienced such a thing and he and Steve both knew he was due for another episode. Steve suspected it would be sooner rather than later. Thats why he put off leaving on his mission as long as he could.
It was Natasha’s turn to pause. “that… that was a long time ago.” She looked back up at the head table, her eyes focused on her husband. “A different life.”
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Steve Rogers”, Tony began. “You are the most infuriating man that I have ever met…” Steve smiled slightly before Tony concluded his statement with, “…and you’re dead wrong”.
“You also speak it well,” Tony paused, he recognized that accent. “for a Chernogorivka.”
Tony finally got back to the Tower of the King late in the evening. He took off the crown and threw it haphazardly on the dresser. He made a point of not looking in the mirror as he started to undo the ties on his formal doublet. Just as he had gotten the top few ties undone there was a knock on the door.
“We’re here.” Steve said softly.
The man turned back to face Tony. “My name is Samuel Willson, my Lord.”
The super soldier somehow managed to seamlessly remove himself from beneath Tony and after grabbing his discarded clothing and redressing, he started to make his way towards the nursery that was only a few feet down the hall from the master bedroom. Tony just watched him go and huffed dramatically once his lover had left him alone on their bed, high and dry. This was not over! Not at all!
“Steve.” Tony whined.
Tony’s breathing faltered when Steve squeezed his crotch, his eyes closing in ecstasy.
“Oh thank heavens.” Steve exclaimed, relief evident on his face at the sight of his two children in the arms of his friend.
Steve smiled, “Its near the coast in a sheltered valley. There is a forest nearby and a mountain range less than a morning’s ride.” Steve blushed. “I hope you’ll like it.”
"To answer your previous question, I found her. She was abandoned. Actually I was hoping that you could translate something for me." Steve explained with much more patience than Steve thought he was capable of at the moment.
Tony smirked and turned to pour himself a fresh cup of coffee just as the elevator opened revealing the rest of the avengers. Thor was animatedly chatting to Burce while Natasha nodded along thoughtfully. Clint made a beeline for the freshly made food and drink.
“Yes, Your Grace.” The boy bowed quickly before running off again.
The man gestured to the hall behind him and Tony dutifully closed the door to his and his fiancé’s quarters before following him.
Tony read the next chapter of the story trying his best to soak in the moment. Peter would be turning 9 in a matter of months. Soon he would be too old to tolerate his dad reading him stories every night before bed.
“Goodnight, Steve.” Tony said, wiggling further against his husband’s chest and studiously ignoring the evidence of Steve’s interest in him. If Steve wasn’t going to satisfy both of them then he could deal with the consequences.
They set off at a brisk pace out of the clearing and down the hill as if worried they would be followed and stoped. Steven lead them through the sprawl of tents and into one of the largest of the bunch. It was set at one edge of the camp and surrounded by several tents all about the same size, but Tony was more focused on what he could see just inside the tent. In the center there was a small fire pit ready to be lit and the rest of the ground was covered in rich furs.
Tony made his way down the stairs to the floor dedicated to the royal children. Tony’s hand drifted self consciously to his belly when confronted with the nearly empty hall. There were half a dozen chambers on this floor, but only one was filled. He and Steve had only just had their son Peter when war broke out and then… well then there was no possibility of more children.
Steve looked over at Tony with an angry glare.
At such an utterance from his lover, one of Steve’s hand dove into Tony’s pants and started fondling his erection through his boxers. The other hand started the process of removing Tony’s pants the get better access to the prize hidden inside the layers of fabric. A loud moan erupted from Tony’s mouth at the renewed pressure.
“The honor is mine, Lady Sarah.” Tony said, bowing once more.
Steve’s head rolled over to look at Tony, face serious and giving off an aura that instantly made it seem as if anything Tony had to say would be the most important thing in the world. Tony swallowed heavily, no one had ever looked at him like that. Like his words and opinions could alter his audience’s fate.
“Sarah!?” Came a worried cry from the hall.
“Come in.” Tony called.
Steve slowly and carefully climbed over a pile of rubble, his right hand securely on the back of Peter's head to try and keep the baby steady. Peter, however, was making a point of remaining anything but still and was currently alternating between throwing his cheerios at anything he could see and eating them.
Steve and the rest of the avengers slowly (too slowly for the tastes of Tony, Hulk, Thor, and Hawkeye) made their was towards the center of the city and were nearing the end of the battle. Steve for his part, could hear the fighting beginning to die down and decided to make a sweep of one last building before making his way towards his comrades, figuring that by the time he got there the fighting would be completely over.
Tony pulled on the loose Etruscan trunks he still favored for underclothes and sleeping in and turned
“Yeah, Bruce. Thanks for doing this.”
“What are you missing me for?” Steve asked playfully. “I have been right here this whole time.”
“Most people call me Natasha Romanov now, Prince Anthony Edward Stark.”
For a moment, King T’Challa looked miles away before abruptly returning to the conversation at hand.
That was certainly not the last night that the vision haunted Tony’s dreams, but it was the first night since that fateful mission that he was able to sleep without visiting that darkest pit of his subconscious where the vision now dwelled.
“Hello Pete-y pie.” Tony closed the door behind him and made his way over to his son’s bed. “How was your day, my shining light?”
Tony huffed and closed his legs. “Fine.” He turned onto his side. “Are your sure you don’t want to hear the rest of—”
The couple nodded and the conversation soon drifted to other, though not always lighter, topics. Steve and Tony, however, spent the majority of that night, and many to come, worrying over the fate of their children. Particularly the now prominent possibility that their baby girl could develop an ability, and a fairly powerful one by the looks of it.
“I believe it’s time for bed. We will be traveling home in the morning.” Steve said.
Tony was still too caught up in the throngs of his panic to respond to his son. He merely curled tighter in on himself and tried to keep his sobs from escaping his mouth so as not to scare his son further. It seemed to have worked because Peter walked away. However, he returned a moment later with his favorite elephant stuffed animal (Steve had some obsession with elephant themed baby things that was completely beyond Tony).
“You are a good man, Steven.” Tony said seriously.
Tony let out a husky moan in response to the delicious contact. The Steve’s arousal was evident through his thin pajama pants while Tony’s was still relatively concealed in his now slightly too tight dress pants.
“I’m sure it will be beautiful.” Tony said. “This whole land is.”
Tony nodded gravely as he looked down at the baby girl held lovingly in his arms. At some point the baby had fallen asleep. Looking at her peaceful face, Tony couldn't imagine anyone ever being able to do something like abandoning such a beautiful little girl. And yet, the fact that she was in an orphanage in the first place suggested that this might in fact be the second time someone had done so.
"Fine. You pick her middle name then." Steve relented.
“Brother.”
Tony finally opened his eyes and looked into his lovers brilliant blue orbs, searching them for the information that had not yet passed the lips that he so desperately wanted to kiss again.
Steve and Tony had made their way back to the shield helacarier with their two little ones and the rest of the avengers, who were enjoying fussing over their nephew and new baby niece. The head doctor on board had cleared the little baby girl and had concluded that she was about a week old. Steve and Tony had therefore estimated her birthday as May 19th.
Steve shuffled his feet awkwardly, his eyes flitting from the floor to Tony and back again.
Tony braced for impact. “You’re going to have to be a bit more specific, Steve. My father did a lot of things that could have worried you.”
“Don’t try it” Tony retorted. “I know that you have been thinking that you're useless or not doing enough cause I go off to work everyday while you stay here with our children, and thats bull shit.”
As soon as the words came out of his mouth Tony realized how perfect it was seeing as the old man had been friends with his father and therefore was the closest thing his kids would get to a grandfather. Fury had initially attempted to protest, failing miserably as his arguments were drowned out by the laughter of both the avengers and every shield agent in hearing range, but Fury quickly gave up after begrudgingly internally agreeing with what Tony had said. Not that Fury would ever let him know that.
“Both.” Steve leaned back down and pecked his lips. “Well now we’re done with that part.”
The door opened and the young black man Tony had noticed Rhodey talking to that morning stepped into the room followed by four other servants. They carried his trunks, stacked two on top of each other, between a pair of them. They entered the chambers slowly before placing the trunks down gently in front of the bed.
“Really now?” Steve teased. “Thats not the name you should be saying in that tone.”
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"This. I have no idea what it means, but I think its a logo of some kind. I saw it on a sign on the outside of the building too." Steve explained.
“Yes, Mother.” Steve replied as he pulled out the seat beside him for Tony.
Steve took a moment to look up the sky and mumble something incoherent under his breath, though Tony knew that he was asking for patience. He always did that when Tony had done something particularly exasperating.
“My King. Royal Consort.” The man said nodding to each of them in turn.
Steve blushed, a bright red gracing his ivory skin. Tony chuckled.
Crap. Tony had forgot to look at his face. What if he was ugly? Well then Tony could admire the hot body pounding into him when they consummated their union. Tony’s eyes traveled up to his betrothed’s face rather hesitantly, but what Tony found there made his heart skip a beat. The first thing he noticed was the man’s strong jaw followed by his plump lips and sweeping golden hair, but that wasn’t what drew Tony’s focus. No, it was the bright blue eyes that dragged Tony in. It was like a fire had been set under his skin. Those eyes made him blaze in a way he didn’t know was possible.
Tony’s feet, unlike his heart, continued on their correct corse and brought Tony to the center of the raised stone platform in front of Bruce. Tony’s face was now tilted up slightly to continue his examination of those eyes. Neither of them moved until someone cleared their throat. Tony looked over to see Bruce waiting expectantly, hands still out flat. Tony quickly reached over and placed his right hand in Bruce’s as his opposite did the same. Tony glanced at Bruce’s face and saw the amusement at Tony’s reaction to his handsome betrothed. Tony was tempted to glare, but realized that might give the wrong impression and abstained.
The rope would apparently be used for an important ceremony to mark the official one year engagement Tony and King Steven would enter into. For some bizarre reason they called it a “hand fasting”. During that time they were to produce a child to complete their marriage or decide to go their separate ways. All in all, this felt more like a real wedding than an engagement to Tony, but Thor had assured him that was not the case. Tony was also still a little unclear on how a child made a marriage, but that was what Thor had told him and Jane had corroborated it which meant it had to be true. Jane would never lie to him and was alway careful to make sure that Thor wasn’t leading Tony astray on how to behave in Celtic society by convincing Tony that Thor’s idiosyncrasies were normal. Tony loved the big, blond man dearly, but he was definitely an odd one.
“So stop it.” He concluded.
“You are not useless.” He stated seriously.
“Come, my betrothed. We are having a feast to celebrate our union. Then I will show you to our tent. Your gifts are waiting there.” Steve said, his voice was deep and melodic. A slight shiver went down Tony’s spine. He was definitely looking forward to the night ahead of them.
“What do you mean ‘betrayed his family’?” Steve asked softly. “What exactly did he do to you?”
“Good.” Steve said.
“Please! Please tell me whats wrong so I can help you.” Steve implored, tears of his own stinging his eyes.
“Mother.” Steve grater joyfully.
It was in that instant, looking at his lover and their children, that Tony realized he was well and truly screwed and he wouldn't change it for the world.
Steve began to turn slowly onto his back. Tony moved his hand way and made room for his betrothed to lie flat on his back, Steve’s broad shoulders making his skin shoulder brush against Tony’s bare chest.
“Are you going to say anything or is it just going to come down to me doing all the talking as always?” Tony said, his face kept carefully neutral.
“What?”
A burst of cheers erupted from the crowd and the circle that had held steady around them broke, people coming closer to congratulate them. Steve turned, hand still tied to Tony’s and forcing him to move as well. His arm pulled awkwardly for a moment before Steven moved his much longer arm closer to Tony, relieving some of the pressure.
“Not to worry.” Tony replied. “My own mother was the same way. She would have… well she would have been either overly excited or ambivalent.”
“I said you are not useless.” Tony replied with the same seriousness in his voice as before.
Slowly Steve retuned the baby to Thor and started the rant he had subjected the young god to when he had first arrived.
“You speak Gaelic well, for an Etruscan.” The woman said with a sly smirk.
He grabbed Tony’s very loose tie and pulled him into a much steamier kiss. Steve’s action elicited a slight moan from his partner before the two pulled apart.
Steve pulled him even tighter against his body and nuzzled his head against Tony’s as a way of both urging him to continue and comforting his love.
“I could go along with that.” Tony teased, smirk in place and his own empty hand quickly retrieving his new dagger.
Tony heard a soft voice call from the other side of the door and he pushed it open. Tony felt all the pain of dreams unfulfilled fall away as his eyes locked on his son’s curly dark head half burrowed under the covers.
Peter had, thankfully, come down from his ceiling perch for the time being and was currently in the arms of his "Uncle Thor". Steve and Tony (begrudgingly on Tony's part) were insistent on referring to all of their fellow avengers as Peter's Aunts and Uncles. Especially since neither of them had any blood family of their own for Peter to refer to by such titles.
“Anthony Stark, you are twice the man your father was and every inch the King you were meant to be.” Pepper said with more conviction that Tony had ever heard from her, which was saying something seeing as Pepper had lead whole armies singlehandedly.
Steve wrapped his arms firmly around Tony and pulled him tightly to his body so that the man was pressed firmly to his chest, his head resting right under the larger man’s chin.
"Yes, she most definitely is." Steve said smiling.
Tony smiled sheepishly and wished that he had remembered that the particular piece of technology he had forced upon Steve was capable of more that just tracking his every move and reporting it directly to Tony's suit.
“I think I need to retire for a bit.” Sarah said as she straightened up slowly.
“What’s it called?” Tony asked.
Tony looked over to glance at his fiancé. His face was smooth and impassive except for the slight downtick at the corner of his mouth. Tony returned his focus forward. Well that didn’t take long. It had been barely half a day since they left Tara, the sight of their hand fasting, and he had already managed to ruin this.
Thor was right behind him. His arms flung up in the air, alternating between snatching movements and what looked like attempts to catch Peter should he suddenly fall. The toddler and the god quickly made their way through the entrance hall and into the living room.
The party rode up along a stone path that was slowly forming out of the grassy valley and through the gap in a short stone wall that served as a border marker. As they made their way through the fields, farmers and shepherds stopped their work to cheer as they passed. Soon countless people were lining the road. When they passed the first of the houses, the cheers became thunderous and the air became filled with flower petals being thrown by the people. They created a cascade of kaleidoscope colors that rained down on them. Tony smiled at the obvious joy and pride Steve’s people had for him and turned to look at the man in question only to find Steve already looking at him.
“Your Majesty, I have come to humbly request I be allowed to return to your guard. I have wronged your Majesty, but I wish to make amends and pay for my sins in any way you deem necessary.”
“As much as I love this,” The blonde leaned down and kissed him briefly. “you need to let go of me so that we can eat.” Steve said with a bright smile.
“It is an honor to meet you Anthony. I am so glad to be welcoming a third son to my family.” Steven’s mother said with that same glowing smile on her face.
As a result of this decision and as a way of ensuring more protection for Peter should they be wrong and Hydra know about Peter's existence after all and attempt to eradicate him, one or both of Peter's new parents were always home. Steve and Tony would take turns going out on missions while the other stayed home with their son. There had been some occasions when both of them were needed out in the field. On such occasions Steve and Tony would only trust their young son to one of their very close friends, and only for a very short period of time when absolutely necessary.
He kissed his son’s head again before getting up and heading towards the door.
Tony leaned down and placed a chaste kiss on his lovers mouth before quietly mumbling, “I missed you”.
Tony sighed once the door closed behind his fiancé. He turned back to the room and started taking in more of the details. There were two candle holders on either side of the bed that hung from the wall. The itself bed was made of thick solid wood. It was simple, but elegant. The poster were carved into twisted pillars and there was an intricate knot carved on the footboard that was surrounded by various leaves and swirling designs. The bed was covered in soft furs with what was probably a fine linen sheet underneath. Tony ran his hand over the sheets as he walked around the bed to go back to now of the windows. A nock on the door startled him out of his explorations.
“Look at how big you’re both getting!” King T’Challa said affectionately before straightening up and this time lifting both children with him.
“Only if you swear the same.” Steve replied in a desperate voice. He knew that if Tony left him alone he would never be abel to bear it. He wouldn’t survive it. At least not completely. He might be able to endure for his children, maybe. But even then, he wasn't sure how long he could live without Tony.
Tony, having been giving the green light, dashed over to the closest computer and began searching through baby names. He had soon settled into t-names and a-names, going through pages and pages of names and speaking aloud the ones he liked best.
“My King.” The man said in what Tony took to be a teasing manner from the slight uptick of the woman’s mouth. “Allow me?”
“The honor is mine, my Lord.” With that, the man bowed once more and indeed left.
The drums picked up the beat of the next song, the sound reverberating in his sternum in a harsh unending beat. The two of them began moving counter to each other. Pushing their hands together and then apart as they moved. Tony had spent enough time with the Celts to know their dances like the back of his hand. They were different enough form the dances back home that Tony could escape those memories for a fleeting moment. The harsh steps and resounding beat a welcome counter to the overly soft and flowing movements of the Etruscan court dances.
“Steven. You are returned.” She smiled warmly. Her eyes moved away from her son to take in Tony, still standing where Steve had left him. “Are you going to introduce me to your husband?”
Steve and Tony just stood there in complete shock and bewilderment before realizing that they should probably go and try to help their friend with their rampaging toddler.
When Tony was finally roused from his hellish nightmare, he fell apart. He broke down sobbing uncontrollably and curled tightly in on himself, though it did nothing to ease the guilt and overwhelming grief that consumed him.
"Maybe we should start calling you Grandpa Fury?" Tony continued to tease.
The morning air was chilly. Their party was moving slowly down the path, the horses huffing in agitation at not going faster. Tony could just see Rhodey and another African man leading the pack from his and his fiancé’s place in the center of their party.
At his partner’s statement, Steve’s eyes did one more sweep of his children and took notice of their daughter’s condition. Worry bloomed on his face with remarkable speed and he quickly traversed the room, arms stretching out to take his daughter from her Uncle.
“Its him.” The little boy spat at Minister Ku.
The soldier’s hands quickly left Tony’s lower body to allow him to remove the last of his own clothing.
“Yes. Well, the first gifts will be given at the feast. It’s an old tradition.” Steven explained.
Sarah smiled back at him with a please look in her eyes.
“Daddy?”
“Not to worry cousin. Anthony is my shield brother. You have no need to guard him from me. Besides, my Jane would cut off my stones if I so much as thought of marrying another. Her clan does not follow our customs.” Thor clapped Steven on the shoulder once more, seemingly unfazed by his wife’s ever looming threat of castration, before flouncing away into the already rowdy party around them.
“Mother, this is my future husband, Prince Anthony Stark of Vetulonia, rightful King of the Etruscans.” Steve introduced.
“May I have your name?” Tony asked.
Tony suppressed his wince as much as he could, but clearly didn’t quite manage it. Steve’s perviously chipper face melted into the beginnings of that sad pout once more, but this time there was an edge of concern and something else Tony couldn’t quite decipher.
Bruce squeezed Tony’s shoulder affectionately and smiled softly at him before a more serious expression fell over his face.
“What is your home like, Tony?” Steve asked, a soft look still on his face. He almost reminded Tony of a puppy.
“Uncle Seamus.” Steve greets the man jovially, if a bit more reserved than he had been with his mother.
Eventually, Steve came back to himself, despite still being worried about Bucky. Though he continued to be consumed by guilt over all of the hardships his best friend had no doubt endured during his absence. The relief that Tony experienced over Steve’s recovery was short lived, however.
“Hey,” Steve replied gently with a soft smile.
“You seem distracted.” The redhead murmured as they passed closer to one another.
It all started with a Shield job that Steve was needed on. He had gone off on what was only meant to be a quick trip. He was only supposed to be gone for a few days, staying in the couple’s D.C. apartment to rest before returning to their Malibu home after the job was over. It had ended up being a much longer stay than either partner had anticipated.
“Yes, your Papa is back.” He said almost regretfully.
Tony's face lit up like a five year old who had just been told he was getting a puppy. It was that moment that Steve realized he had just accidentally given Tony exactly what he wanted.
Steve sighted and shook his head, clearly not agreeing with Tony’s assessment. Tony studied Steve with half lidded eyes. There was something there that Tony couldn’t put his finger on. There was clearly another layer to this that Tony wasn’t grasping, but it was apparent that Steve wasn’t going to do anything fun with Tony again tonight.
“My lord the Royal Consort, I am here to deliver your trunks.”
“Hey,” Tony said softly.
He could hear the crackle of the fire and beyond that movements and soft voices all around them. The feast seemed to have ended at some point and people were making their way back to their tents for the night. Tony looked at Steve questioningly. He didn’t see the problem here. Wasn’t it their duty to consummate their union. What would everyone else care if they enjoyed it rather loudly?
“What happened?” Tony questioned sharply, already moving towards the young King and the children held in his arms.
“What is it little one?” King T’Challa asked in a quiet “Uncle” voice that was laced with familial concern, his head bent down to look more closely at his niece.
“You’re all dead and gone, yet I'm still alive. Just sitting there, staring at the three of you, and wishing that I was dead too.” Tony concludes in a harsh whisper, self loathing permitting every word like acid spilling from his mouth.
As if sensing his lover’s harmful train of thought, Tony reached out and wrapped his arms securely around Steve’s abdomen. He pulled them together until they were chest to chest, their legs tangled together until Tony wasn't sure where he began and Steve ended.
“Beautiful.” Steve said, fingers following the curve of the necklace just above Tony’s skin. Never quite touching, but hinting at it.
Tony snapped out of his stupor and quickly dismounted. He made his way over to his fiancé and took the offered hand. Tony could swear that he felt a spark when their skin touched, but he ignored it in favor of following Steve into the large house.
Thor could see the unease in Steve's face and body language and was currently attempting to ease his friend's fears.
Tony hooked his arm through his fiancé’s as the doors before them opened. They entered at the back of the hall and walked their way around the tables of people to where the large chairs still sat. There was now a table placed directly in front of the chairs that were occupied by the other members of the royal family. They walked down the front table to the two seats in the center and took their place.
He stood up and pulled fully way from Tony. He reached down and took their still half full goblets back over to the table before moving over to the trunk next to it. He opened it and quickly stripped of all his clothing except his loose trousers. Tony’s eyes raked appreciatively over the muscular physique now on display to him. Before standing himself and walking over next to Steve, stripping until he was in a similar state of undress. He folded his clothes and placed them in the trunk next to Steve’s.
“What does it mean?” He asked.
Burying his nose in Tony’s hair, Steve continued, “This has gone too far. I’m worried about you. I’m so worried.” He pulled him closer to him as if he could absorb the other man’s pain into himself.
Steve slowly made his way out of the conference portion of the helacarier's main control room. He navigated his way through the ship to the medical wing and to the small room that Fury had arranged for the little ones.
“Yes.” Steve mumbled.
“Oh God.” Tony uttered breathlessly.
Their party all started to dismount and make their way into the main building or several of the other smaller ones scattered around it. Tony, however, made no move to dismount. He was mesmerized by the building before him. The wooden exterior seemed to almost melt into the mountain as moved went back. The stone foundation of the building’s exterior seemed to almost be the mountain. Its stoned were far rougher and more natural looking that the stone foundations of the buildings in the villages. The wood itself was thick and sturdy, almost as if the trees had been left nearly whole before being molded into the building before him. In the center was a large door that was carved and painted with some sort of mythical scene that Tony lacked the context to understand fully.
Minister Ku opened his mouth as if to retort, the anger glistening in his eyes, but little Sarah Rogers-Stark’s whimper cut him off. Concern immediately overcame the previously stoic face of the young King.
Steve’s back stiffened instantly from his place in front of the crib on the other side of the room while he cuddles Peter in his arms. The baby boy having needed soothing after being distressed about his little sister’s own unhappiness.
Richard Parker had explained to the super hero couple how the little baby had gotten his powers when he and his wife had left Peter with Steve and Tony. Peter had somehow managed to get into the container where Richard was keeping the genetically modifies spiders he had been working on during his time undercover at OSCORP, and the baby had been bitten. After a couple of hours of crying on Peter's part and a frantic Mary asking her husband exactly what those spiders would do to their son, Peter had calmed down and within a matter of days was displaying the new abilities the spider bite had given him. Richard had immediately destroyed the remaining spiders, even thought he knew their affects were directly linked to his own DNA and therefore would only work on himself, bis brother Ben, and his son Peter.
“Yes, Mom.”
Tony, realizing that his lover had just handed him a metaphorical shovel to start digging himself out of the hole he had some how managed to drag himself into, grabbed the line Steve had just thrown him like his life depended on it.
Steve reached up and grasped Tony’s hand, holding it more firmly against his cheek.
Tony swallowed thickly.
Shield, particularly Nick Fury, had been very accommodating of the super hero duo during this time and had helped them change Peter's last name on every database they could access to try and further hide his connection to the Parkers in order to keep him safe. They had even offered their assistance in boosting Tony's already impeccable security. Fury had ensured that all of this was done entirely off the Shield servers, of corse, and only by his most trusted agents.
“Anthony-“
“Tony, I have one last gift for you this night.” Steve said.
The pair moved on after exchanging a few more pleasantries and before long Thor came charging at them, lifting Tony right off the ground in a tight hug.
Tony hummed in answer as he realized that he had already lost his way on their path from their rooms to the main hall. He was going to have to work on that.
“I heard the maids whispering that Papa was back. Is that true?”
Peter laid down and curled into his father. Tony slowly and gently wrapped his young son in his shaky embrace. They stayed like that until the baby made a slight noise and Peter, realizing that his little sister was being left out voiced his concerns.
“Thats our cue.” Steve murmured, turning to face the doors and holding his arm out for Tony.
The couple’s young son soon began screaming and crying as well, a habit which he had taken up recently whenever his baby sister started wailing. At least Peter only joined in on the crying when Sarah was really in need of something or distressed.
“The honor is mine, My Lord.” The man said, but he didn’t bow as his compatriot had done.
"He'll be fine. We wont stay out long." Tony said as he replaced his hold on his partner.
Tony reached down and grabbed a fleece blanket from the trunk before closing it firmly. He reached over and pulled Steve with him by the hand. Tony slowly sprawled down on the furs, dragging Steve down with him and skillfully maneuvered them so that Steve was curled against Tony’s back, arm draped over him, and both of them snugly covered in the warm blanked.
“You were in the ranks out our party this morning were you not? Are you a soldier then?” Tony asked, wishing to start up some sort of conversation to fill the silence.
Steve’s hand moved from his cheek to gently grip his neck. Tony’s breath caught and he felt his libido start to react to the possessive hold of his alpha. The heat began to build faster when Steve’s thumb started rubbing Tony’s still unmarked bonding gland. Despite everything his father had done, selling him around to gain favor from his father’s business partners, Howard had been clear that they not damage the prime value of his merchandise. Tony hated that his father had treated him like nothing better than a prized cow to breed to whoever suited him, but was also glad that his own protectiveness of that particular part of himself was backed by his pimp. Tony was greedy in wanting to choose how own mate, even if he would never have the freedom other omega’s had in doing so. This marriage and this man was his choice in a way that so few of his partner’s had been. He had picked Steve, not for love or even lust, but he still chose him.
Steve pulled Tony down the same stone hallway his mother and uncle has just disappeared into. The path curved slowly as they moved deeper into the mountain. They walked for several minuted before coming to a large wooden door. It had silver and gold metal decoration covering it and twisting together into intricate designs.
“Very well, your Majesty. If there is anything else this evening please ring for me, I shall retire for the evening.” Jarvis said with a polite bow.
Peter was staring up at his parents in fascination, one fist, that had once held a handful of cheerios, stuffed entirely into his mouth. Tony looked down dramatically at where Steve had indicated, took in the image of his son, blinked, and then looked back at Steve.
The two of them made their way back into the bedchamber, Tony heading over to his dresser once more to finish undoing the ties of his doublet and Steve once again standing awkwardly nest to a doorway.
Tony’s hand reached over to soothingly run his fingers through his son’s curly locks. “I don’t know. I’m sorry, Peter. I wish I had a better answer for you, but I promise your Papa loves you so much. I will tell you anything I hear from him, but for now just know that we both love you more than anything.” Tony bent down and kissed his son's head.
Tony dutifully turned his attention to his plate and ate what little he could stomach with thoughts of the parties in his father’s court swimming through his head. Every time he looked out on the hall his vision swam with memories of the gilded chambers of the palace he grew up in. The colors changed from blues and greens to bright reds and purples. The meed turned to sweet wine on his tongue and the heat radiating off his fiancé turned into the menacing hatred of his father.
“Dawdy, Sawah lowvs you and is wowied too.” Peter said firmly.
Steve pointed towards the opposite side of the valley from where they were emerging from the trees. Opposite them sat a village nestled at the base of a jutting mountain. Farm land and livestock spilled out into the valley from the cluster of round houses whose foundations could only be distinguished from the rocks of the mountain by their almost black mortar.
Yes. He was. Tony would do anything to protect his people from the usurper that has killed his father two years ago and King Steven was a notoriously powerful man. This was his only way back and he was going to do everything in his power to ensure it worked. His hand tightened on the rope.
It was to this lovely scene that Steve returned home. It warmed his heart to see the three people he loved most in the world all curled up happily together and he knew that Tony would be ok. Or as ok as Tony ever was.
When he finally returned home, Captain America was a mess. He had cried for days about Bucky and having lost him again. Tony did everything he could to comfort his lover, but it didn't seem to make much impact. The only thing that could heal Steve was his family’s love and time.
“Don’t your people practice multiple marriage?” Tony asked.
Tony, frustrated by Steve’s continued collectedness, decided that his lover had far too many clothed on. He started kissing his way down Steve’s body, his hands gliding down ahead of his lips. Once Tony’s slightly rough hands found the band of his partner’s now infuriating pajama pants and boxers, he slipped them beneath both pieces of offending fabric and proceeded to remove them. Steve’s hips lifted slightly to allow Tony to more easily remove the clothing. The ex-playboy tossed the clothing over his shoulder carelessly, fully enjoying the view before him with a little smirk.
“I’m sorry, but this is royal coffee only.” Tony sassed as he handed a cup to Thor, bypassing Clint completely. “Peasants must wait for the next one.”
"What I meant was that there are a lot Sarahs. We might want to give her a more unique middle name?" Tony started hopefully.
“Steve?” Tony asked.
Steve went to walk away, but Tony reached out and grabbed his arm.
“I love you too.” He said adoringly, before pulling Tony down into a much deeper and more sensual kiss. Tony’s hands started trailing lower and Steve’s hands wound themselves into his hair.
“You don’t have to do this, you know.” Bruce said quietly.
Tony was so far gone into the darkest depths of his subconscious that he didn't even notice how stiff his lover had become.
Tony took a breath as the pieces of knowledge began to fall into place. A Chernogorivkan woman with red hair who was much farther north and west than a member of her tribe ever should be.
At the end of their ordeal, it was Tony who was badly broken.Tony was plagued by nightmare after nightmare where he was forced to relive the terror of the vision that Wanda had inflicted upon him. It had gotten so bad that one day Steve had walked into their bedroom to check on Tony only to find his lover gone. Eventually, after franticly searching, the super soldier found his lover in their master bathroom wielding a wicked looking knife. Tony had already inflicted cut after cut on his arms and had the kitchen knife prized over his wrist, ready to inflict one last and final blow. In that instant, seeing his lover so torn apart and broken, Steve felt as if his heart had been ripped from his chest and was laying in the steady stream of blood stemming from Tony’s arms. It was terrifying and incredibly detrimental to both partners.
“Dawdy?” He questioned, he was still in the process of figuring out language. “You ok Dawdy?”
“Its lovely, but I’m not sure what it means.” Tony said regretfully. “I am not as familiar with your traditions as I would like to be.”
Tony's hands shot up in a sign of surrender and quickly begins backtracking.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Tony.” Steve held his hand out for him once more.
“Steve.” Tony reached out and cupped his husband’s jaw, Steven’s eyes shot up to meet Tony’s gaze. “My Steve.” He said with determination.
Steve gave him a steamy and all too knowing look, complete with his own smirk.
Steve opened his mouth and invited his lover in. Tony quickly took the bait and their tongues began to engage in a heated dance. He was now thoroughly distracted and Steve took advantage of it.
During this whole process, Steve made a point to always keep his vibranium shield in front of his young son. Steve was not taking any chances. He was perfectly fine getting shot or being hit by the stray piece of rubble. His baby son, however, was not.
The more Tony thought about it, the more worried he became. So, the genius endeavored to do anything and everything to keep himself distracted until his lover returned home to him.
“My lady.” Tony greeted.
“Sounds like we’re needed.” He stated with a sub tone of mirth.
“Tony, my shield brother. Steven, my beloved cousin. I am so happy for you.” Thor bellowed.
Steve’s eyes flicked up to meet Tony’s again. The heat in that gaze had turned into a fire just as warm and bright as the real one behind them. Steve’s hand trailed up over Tony’s neck to cup his jaw. Tony’s eyes never left Steve’s as his betrothed leaned down and kissed him.
“This does not bode well for us.” The man, Bucky, said. Seemingly sensing their new bond.
“Thanks Clint.” Steve said when they approached him.
Tony sighed. “Fine. What do you want to know?”
Steve blanched and was half way through figuring out how to snatch his young son out of the arms of the norse god when Thor realized his mistake.
Tony marched after his lover and had opened his mouth to argue before Steve shot him “that” look, the one that meant there was absolutely no arguing with him, after which the younger man immediately froze up, all arguments dead on his tongue. It looked like there would be no sex for Tony in the foreseeable future.
Steve turned onto his side, his head propped up against his hand so that he was looking down at Tony. His other hand reached over and began to gently caress Tony’s cheek. “Well then, anything you want to tell me, I want to hear.”
Tony was silent for a long time. He stared down at the face of the man he had once loved above all others. He didn’t know if he could do this.
Finally after about an hour of looking, Tony had settled on a short list of his favorite t-names and a-names. He settled rather quickly on his favorite t-name, Taelyn. The a-names, however were a little harder. Eventually, he settled on three names; Adeline, Aillidh, and Amory.
It took several minutes for Steve to calm down and his growling to stop.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Tony took several deep calming breaths that only partially worked with the scent of his own slick and the building scent of Steve’s musk permitting the air. When he could finally hear more than his heart beat and their mingled breaths, Tony he focused on trying to hear was Steve did.
Steve and Tony stood in the entrance hall of their Malibu home, dressed for a night out at one of the nicer restaurants in the city. This was their first date night since they adopted Peter nearly a year ago.
Tony nodded to them as the servants left the room. The young black man bowed and made to leave, but Tony stopped him.
Steve’s hands moved to Tony’s hips and slowly, achingly, made their way up his partner’s body feeling every muscle and curve of the body that the super soldier knew so well. When he finally reached the top of his lover’s shirt and the aforementioned tie, he started to undo first Tony’s tie and then each of the tiny buttons on his shirt with practiced fingers. One of Steve’s fingers delicately brushed against the hollow of the other man’s neck as he undid the top button of the shirt causing Tony to gasp slightly at the unexpected contact. Tony used the intake of breath to his advantage and decided that his lover was far too composed for his liking.
"Sarah Taelyn Adelina Rogers-Stark." Steve breathed adoringly as he looked down at their daughter. "Its perfect."
It seemed to take an eternity to make their way to the highest point in the village. When they finally arrived, Tony was greeted by the sight of a tall wooden gate that slowly opened for them as they approached. The gates opened into a small cobblestone courtyard in front of a large building.
Tony looked them over. His three dearest friends. He loved them all so dearly. They alone were half the reason he agreed to marry King Steven. Tony needed to protect them and live up to their trust in him. This was the first step to doing that.
Steve winced. “Lord Commander Rhodes thought I was best placed here. After all, I would never let anyone past me if I was guarding the two of you.” Steve looked down at his feet and bit his lip.
Tony raised his left arm proudly over his head, the gold of his rope catching the last rays of the setting sun. Tony saw an action the mirror of his own on the opposite side of the crowd. A pale hand raised above the people, a burgundy red, dark blue, and silver rope clutched in it. Tony took a step forward and saw the other rope move one step closer to him as well. The two of them made mirrored movements closer and closer together until the crowd separated and Tony got his first look at the man he was going to marry.
The first man to great them was only slightly shorter then Steven was and had his long brown hair tied loosely back. Next to him stood a short red haired women who Tony could immediately tell was another foreigner. She exchanged a nod of solidarity with Tony, two strangers in a land they weren’t born to.
“Its only after I have been looking around for a while that I see…” Tony’s voice broke. He struggled to hold in his sobs just thinking about the image that plagued him most both awake and asleep.
Bruce looked at Tony one last time before he walked to the center of the raised circular stone platform at the center of the sacred space. Once Bruce had taken his place, everyone fell silent. Bruce raised his arms out in each direction and laid his palms out flat, waiting for the two people he was about to bind together.
“Well” Tony paused. “Its not as green as it is here, and there are many tall mountains all around. In the winter they become covered in snow, but the rest of the year they are filled with flowers. On clear days, you can climb to the highest point in the city and just make out the ocean in the distance. The city itself is mostly stone now. My father designed much of it and I did most of the rest.”
Steve takes Tony home for the first time.
“Yes, my little light?” Tony replied, bending down to kneel beside the bed.
“Yes.” Steve replied, but didn’t elaborate.
The man was taller than Tony and had large muscled arms. Tony’s eyes jumped from his bulging biceps to his glorious chest and a shoulder to wait ratio that would have made any of the many gods he had hear tales about jealous. Tony inhaled sharply. His future-husband was hot. Tony’s eyes trailed down to thick legs and an unfortunately loose fitting tunic top. Curse the Celts for not wearing clothing that was just a little bit tighter. Then again Tony supposed he should be grateful it wasn’t the loose fitting Etruscan entire of his homeland, then he would only have his handsome face and broad shoulders to admire.
Steve sighed dramatically.
Steve had a thoroughly confused look on his face and swiftly sat up, one of his strong arms moving behind him to better support his weight.
“Well, if you eventually take another spouse who will surely live with us, why worry about who does and does not hear me when we mate?”
“I think thats enough for tonight.” Steve said breathily.
“Tony” Steve began. He didn’t want to pry if Tony wasn't ready to talk about it, but he knew that something was terribly wrong with his lover and it was breaking his heart to see him this way. He had sensed something was off since their mission to retrieve Loki’s scepter, but whenever he tried to get Tony to talk about it, the younger man would shrug off Steve’s concerns with his usual antics.
Was that really true? Tony searched Steve’s face for any falsehood hidden there. There was none, only firm conviction. He meant it. Steve really meant it. Tony couldn’t resist leaning in and kissing Steve, even if it was chaste.
The photos of the little baby girl were such a hit that Pepper was actively campaigning for the super hero couple to start up a blog so she didn't have to be constantly fielding calls from every form of media imaginable begging her for more pictures of the Rogers-Stark babies. So far Steve was completely against it and Tony was moderately apposed. But, Pepper was like a shark who had scented blood in the water and was gradually wearing Tony down. It was only a matter of time before Tony gave in and both he and Pepper knew it. Steve was also aware of how she had cornered his partner like a predator who had almost sunk her claws into her prey, but he wasn't going to give in that easily.
Steve made a tentative move closer to where Tony sat on the bed. “I know and I am so sorry for everything I’ve done, all the pain I’ve caused you and our son. I am so sorry.”
Tony fell back on the bed, resigned to having to share more about himself that he thought he would have to in their marriage.
“Right here.” Tony said as he promptly sat down right in Steve’s lap.
“Tony, this is my mother, Lady Sarah Rogers, the queen mother.”
"We haven't really decided yet." Steve supplied.
“Maybe just a little.” Steve said in a joking tone.
The noise was so high pitched that it made the old minister wince, but King T’Challa did not. He recognized this noise and the particular nickname that was being screamed.
Tony’s body went limp with shock. How could this happen? No! He wouldn't let it!
Steve handed Tony the baby and she gurgled happily before settling quietly into Tony's arms. A small smile flashed across Tony's face before he refocused himself. Steve reached over and pointed at the embroidered name.
“Fine. If it means we can go eat at the table, I’ll help you get back at Clint by wearing his joke hoodie.” Steve relented.
Finally, after a long year of caution and parenting, valentines day had come and Tony had insisted on taking his love out for a well deserved romantic evening to celebrate the holiday, even if it wasn't on the actual day. So, they had called up their friend Thor and asked him to baby sit the now 18 month old Peter, which had gotten a lot harder since he discovered walking and as a result, the beginnings of running.
“There’s no need.” Tony said sharply in Etruscan. “I never have and never will ask that of you.”
The blonde startled slightly, but quickly adjusted to holding his husband securely in his lap with one arm while devouring his breakfast with the other.
Tony was distracted from the pit of memories his mind was diving into by a tap on his arm. He turned and came face to face with the red headed women who was soon to be his sister-in-law. There had been an itch of recognition when he had seen her at the ceremony the previous day that now focused into knowledge. He had seen that face before.
They were silent once again, but this time it wasn’t nearly as comfortable. Tony faced forward and refused to meet his almost-husband’s eyes again even though he could feel Steve’s gaze like a physical weight. They kept riding in silence until the trees started to thin. Tony could just begin to see the edges of a large valley with what seemed to be a cluster of buildings near the tree line.
Steve, still breathing heavily from their previous actions, chuckled slightly beneath Tony.
Tony looked over to see what could only be described as a pout begging to form on his betrothed’s face. That same emotion welled up and Tony couldn’t stop the slightly sappy smile from forming on his face. Shit!
Once he had finally forced his body to the door, Tony had quietly opened it and found Steve already laying beneath their covers but not yet asleep. Tony stepped in and closed the door delicately before making his way further into the room, stripping off pieces of his rather annoying suit as he went. He was just working off his tie when he reached Steve’s side of the bed and gently sat on the edge of it.
Tony shot Steve a sharp glare before moving down the hall and knocking gently on the door of the only other occupied room in the tower. Tony could feel the ghosts of the other children he and Steve had dreamed of having dancing at the corners of his mind. He had wanted so much more than this. More for his son. More for his kingdom.
There was a larger amorous opposite him that was taller than his betrothed. It was placed at the opposite end of the wall from the door and two large trunks on either side of it. On the opposite wall was one other a large desk covered in papers. Tony walked from the window over to the table to examine the sheets. He reached for one and turned it over to find a beautifully done sketch.
"Oh God!" Tony exclaimed. "I'm sorry. I thought you would recognize me. I mean its kind of hard not to."
Steve took another look around the decimated room, taking in the presence of multiple other empty cribs and a few changing tables. He quickly walked over to the cleanest of those changing tables and set the baby down. Steve unwrapped the baby as delicately as he could so as to not further irritate any already existing injuries. After he did a quick inspection, he discovered that the little baby was unharmed much to his relief.
Sighing, Tony made his way over to the elevator and pushed the button for the common floor. He spent the ride down picking off whatever miscellaneous threads or pieces of lint he could see on Steve’s hoodie. When the doors opened, the smell of the breakfast Steve was cooking filled Tony’s nose. He inhaled hungry and followed the alluring scent to the kitchen where his Husband was standing in front of the stove.
“Can I interrupt?”
“Oh Anthony, Steven. Wonderful. Now we can start the feast.” Sarah said from her seat on the left of the highest backed chair.
“It shows you’re mine. My future husband, my omega, the Royal Consort of Ireland.” Steve said reverently.
“Did you do these?” Tony asked.
“Good morning, your Queenly-ness.” Clint said as he passed behind Tony. “Can you poor me a mug?”
Rhodey stepped closer to him and coughed pointedly. Clearly Tony had take too long to think it over. Fine. Steve was still a night of the realm. It’s not like there was a real reason that the public was aware of for him to not be a member of Tony’s guard. And technically Steve was still his consort. Tony hadn’t taken anyone else to his bed since their wedding night and their marriage still held. Tony hadn’t been able to bear asking Bruce to annul it. After all, Tony had thought the memory of their vows and the ring on his finger to be the last parts of Steve left to him beyond their children. But after what had happened… Tony wasn’t sure if he would ever see Steve again. He supposed this was his chance to have the man in his sights again, even if it wasn’t what he really wanted.
“Oh really?” Steve said in a slightly shaky breath, Tony’s hands having been inching slowly closer to his member. “Are you planning on returning the favor any time soon?”
After what seemed like hours Tony’s breathing finally evened out and sobs no longer shook his body.
"Tony" Steve said as he gently laid a hand on his lover's shoulder.
Abruptly Bruce took a step back and Tony inhaled sharply. He had been practicing for this part. His Gaelic was much better than it had been, but it was nowhere near perfect and Tony desperately needed to not embarrass himself. Tony looked up into Steven’s eyes again and suddenly it was like they were the only two people in the world.
Bruce reached his hands out again to take Tony’s rope and then his betrothed’s. Right, his name was Steven. That was the name of the adonis Tony was marrying, Steven. Damn. He was not going to mind their consummation at all, in fact he could hardly wait. If Tony had his way, their marriage bed would be a mess by the end of the night.
“I was and I am.” The man replied as the two of them walked back down the winding halls. “I’m an archer.”
As for Tony, he had been working a lot since they had returned home from their last mission. After all, the CEO couldn't leave Stark Industries unattended for long, despite how talented Pepper was at running the business for him. For the first time in a long time, Steve was glad that Tony’s income and substantial wealth allowed for him to stay home with the babies, even if he didn't particularly like being completely reliant on his partner for everything. Despite his relief at having the freedom to stay home and take care of their children without worry, Steve still felt that he wasn't contributing to their household in an equal way to Tony and it bothered him immensely.
“I am not contributing…” He began.
A long silence followed his desperate plea. If Tony hadn’t been so shaky in Steve’s arms, the elder would have suspected his lover of being asleep.
“What?” Tony replied, the buzzing still almost overwhelming his senses.
“But-”
Tony turned around and came face to face with his fiancé. Tony didn’t turn to look at Natasha, but she must have made some sort of affirmative gesture because the next thing Tony knew, Steve’s hands were pressed to his and there were sparks zinging down his spine. Tony lost track of time. He didn’t know how long they spent dancing there on the floor, but at some point the guests had begun to filter out of the hall.
“Getting a little impatient there, Captain?” He teased before gently nipping Steve’s ear eliciting a gasp and slight buck of his hips into Tony’s.
Tony opened his mouth to say something when a young boy with fiery red hair came running into the room. He hastily bowed upon entering and then addressed Steve.
“I want you to now.” Tony whined, his head falling even farther back to show even more of his neck in hopes it would tempt the obviously interested alpha.
“Ok.” Tony mumbled.
Tony heard a slight cough and turned to look at his Fiancé. Steve’s hand was raised to his mouth and his pale skin had turned a fierce red. Tony couldn’t helps but find it endearing.
“I will only take another spouse if you want me to.” Steve said assuredly.
The Black Panther only nodded, eyeing his minister somewhat warily as he walked away from his King and the young children in his arms. Sarah was still whimpering when her fathers came rushing in looking slightly frantic and haggard.
"And who exactly was it who wouldn't let me out of his sight without forcing me to put this" Steve gestured angrily to the small piece of opaque plastic in his ear, "in my ear so he could keep track of and check in on me?"
“I’m cutting you off.” Steve proclaimed, his hands coming to rest firmly at his hips.
“You said something earlier today…” Steve paused as if considering his next words as carefully as he could. “… something about your father that worried me.”
He shifted restlessly as the feeling grew. Steve groaned above him, pulling away so he could look at Tony. Tony whimpered and tried to pull Steve back to him, but his Alpha wouldn’t more.
Tony reached out his hand and pressed it against the center of his fiancé’s back.
At the end of the two week long period, Shield had fallen and Hydra had been exposed once more. The parasite having grown to far greater strength than it ever had in the time since Steve thought he had destroyed it the first time during World War II.
Once the boy had left, Steve turned to back to Tony the mask melting off as if it had never been there. “I’m sorry, but it seems I need to go. Your trunks should be delivered shortly. Please take any space you need. I want you to feel at home here. Should you require anything while I’m gone simply ask one of the servants to take you to my mother. She would be happy to get to know you further.”
"Thank you!" Tony practically squealed before jumping up, pressing a kiss to Steve's cheek, and skipping over to the shield agent that Fury had assigned to managing all the legal details of the adoption.
Steve looked utterly flabbergasted, his mouth hanging open and eyes wide.
“What?” Tony whined while leaning down to place his exhausted daughter in her crib. “Its not like she can understand anything I'm saying.”
