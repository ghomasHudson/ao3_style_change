"Your side? You don't have a side, and that's not a matter of opinion, but plain fact," Tony shot back.
"Nope."
Tony shook his head to dismiss that thought and—
"How? How did you manage that?"
fault...
He had begun suspect his time to think was limited when he had been barred from the site of the collapsed eStarkStore. The police had sealed it, then SHIELD and the FBI quarrelled over it for a time, while Jarvis hacked into all of their research files.
It worked, though. A warrior moved over to the hovering vehicle and grasped the hound's spike collar. Two others peeled off and double-timed it back to the gates, which swung open to receive them.
"I'm lousy at hand to hand," Tony admitted. "Happy tried to teach me to box, but then Natasha flattened him without trying. Hey." He nudged Steve with his elbow. "Who would win a fight between you two?"
"Not working. Just taking a chance to get in touch with my night-owl boss, who hasn't been available today, according to Jarvis."
Here Erik Selvig had opened a gate to outer space, allowing the alien invaders in: huge animalistic machines crawling through the portal and into the spaces between the towers, ugly humanoid figures dropping down with weapons blazing...
Steve! Steve was still in the armour.
"It's hard to be in love with a friend who is in love with someone else," Steve said. Ignoring her glare, he added, wryly, "I should know."
He was certainly setting a sharp pace today.
Tony raised an eyebrow at Natasha, who said, "I may have some ideas, but put it in words of one syllable, if you're capable of it."
But there were other contacts, much closer than he was.
"Velasco. Velasco. Oh, my God. Jarvis, where did he take that Chitauri troop carrier-thing? Please tell me it wasn't McGuire."
Stark seemed taken aback for a few seconds. "No, no. I mean, I know your rep, obviously and it's one hell of a rep. You'd better brace yourself, Cap, because this will come as a shock. The war was over close to seventy years ago." He paused, plainly expecting a reaction. "Don't you believe me?"
"Well?" Tony asked, in response to the doubt on the other man's face. "Spit it out."
Not for the first time, Steve woke with a morning wood of monumental proportions and memories of dreams that all too frequently involved Tony – Tony in danger, Tony dying, Tony arguing with him, Tony fighting against and beside him, Tony in bed with him...
"I have no idea what those are – or who the hell you are."
"And had him bugged and followed," Tony pointed out, his mind boggling at the idea of Fury giving anyone fatherly advice. "Now tell me something we don't know."
Never mind that. If this time's Tony had taken possession of his temporal device, the Pym particles and the Infinity Stones, he would not rest until he understood them. And if anyone in this time could figure them out it was their very own genius billionaire. After all, he'd done it once already. Except if he tried to pick up one of the Stones...
"Not sure how we'd stop you going ahead even if you hadn't," one of the cops was saying. "Besides what you did for us all today, I might owe you a personal debt."
"Yes, if you haven't thought of any more since then. I like to think of your will as my continuous masterpiece in progress.”
"I must explain that 'time to think' is a luxury you do not have. My profound apologies, but we have to have your decision tonight. An aircraft is waiting for you right now at Kennedy Airport."
"I'm hard to kill," he said.
Rhodey pulled off the War Machine helmet and stared at Tony, wide-eyed. "I know you aren't religious, buddy, but that's pretty damn close to blasphemy."
"More a case of what I can do for you, though if some people find out you may have to shield me from non-avenging furies."
Iron Man rose up alongside the ship until he was level with the deck.
"The Hatut Zeraze?"
To Tony's relief, the garage was pretty much intact and, even more importantly, empty of human life. "We'll take the black SUV and hope people mistake us for the Feds. Jay, open the key safe and—"
Carter stared at him for a long moment. "You don't believe what I'm saying, do you? Not one damn word."
Once again, greyness threatened to overcome Steve, but this time it was from that truth... oh god, if that was true... Natasha. His Natasha, who was also who the Natasha listening to this would become, was doomed to worse than death on Vormir...
When Steve woke he found a military duffle bag sitting just inside the door.
"In a way it's kinda... nice... to be ignored," Steve said, as he followed Jan out of the lab.
"Not in the Americas, sir, or Europe.
"Sure. He'd supplied me with one when I really needed it. I hate dry funerals – or anything dry come to that. Except dry Champagne. And gin. But Champagne is better for celebrating the death of your enemies. I'm really looking forward to Hammer's. D'you know if this guy really is Coulson's grandad?"
"Nope. Wakanda is. I'm just the messenger boy. Wakanda will repatriate your agents on receipt of a signed agreement, from you as Director of SHIELD, stating that SHIELD will respect Wakanda's territorial integrity, you will remove your agents from their airfield – which you have already been requested to do by two countries the UN does recognise – and cease its surveillance. They want you out of their backyard, Nick."
secrets, Steve."
"Which is odd, because you and Jean have not met before today. Your image of her is strange and troubling. I am imposing my mental image of myself here, but she is merely observing. I find it... interesting."
"You ready for another bout?"
"That's odd." Danvers appeared genuinely startled.
Tony shook his head, unable to express his admiration. "Tell me again why we never got involved, Jan."
Jealous of a dead woman? An old dead woman. Who had never slept with Steve. Which he hadn't either and probably never would.
"Past our security. We didn't even realise the first one was gone until we reviewed the news footage of the battle but the last two just went missing overnight. The CCTV cameras show them there at midnight and gone at five minutes past."
The man went down but his gun rattled as his figure tightened convulsively on the trigger, the shells ploughing runnels in the soil.
lessons in going for the jugular – well, she learned from me, I guess. She said it was bad enough that I had an obsession with creating robotic friends with weird personalities and locking myself in my workshop to mess with tech when I should be glad-handing shareholders and paying attention to her, and being a superhero and drinking which she also said affected my performance in bed which is
And they knew each other.
"Looks like their power source is dead—" Tony began, when suddenly, Captain America's grip on the armour's shoulder-plate slackened, and Tony had to clutch him with both hands to stop him falling, then drop sharply to catch the shield as it slipped out of his hand.
"There's one on me," Tony said.
"Because she stole something I never meant anyone to use. And Tony's fond of her. They used to date, I think. And he did destroy her father's dream – and him. Obie – her father – used to be my friend. He may have been a total bastard but he loved her and I'll do what I can for both of them. Come on, son. The food's getting cold."
"Yeah," and that was Tony's voice, not Iron Man's, over the communicators. "I'm calling the emergency services now." The timbre of his voice changed to the Iron Man synthesiser, but now Steve was included in those hearing him. "This is Iron Man. I have Captain America with me. You look like you could use some help down there. May we assist? Over."
"Let me know if that changes," Tony said, then, with trepidation, he dialled the number of Pepper's private cell and waited to see if she would pick up. She had spoken to Steve, but Steve hadn't dumped her.
Steve shrugged: "A handsome, billionaire genius with—?"
"Go on."
"So, someone's using his books to pick aliases? Doesn't explain why you're in such a hurry."
"When we have something to load 'em with. Analysis of sample of vibranium from the crates?"
"A fashion designer who wanted to be a biochemist and now wants to be a superhero." Hank sounded not so much angry as resigned. "In the shower, Tony. The plumbing's a tad odd, but an engineering genius ought to be able to figure it out."
Natasha ignored the question and, instead, pointed to the object half hidden by Steve's curled body. "Is that Thor's hammer?"
Her face went blank. "I was told you were close friends – best friends," she said.
Tony threw up his hands in a gesture of surrender and left. He didn't want Steve to think of him as a kid brother, but if that would help him, he'd give it the good old college try.
"Just so," said Jarvis. "Welcome to Avengers Tower, Captain."
Hands moved swiftly over his body, checking his pockets and more intimate places.
They were in a short corridor or guard room, which seemed to have been recently occupied, in all probability by the warriors currently lying bound, gagged and unconscious only a few feet away.
"Like anything of Tony's, it probably can," Jan retorted. She looked sideways at Steve. "Is he okay? Tony, I mean. He was... distraught... by your apparent death in Wakanda, then there was Pepper... You know he's broken up with Pepper?"
He had a text message to send to Pepper, and a trip to make to Brooklyn.
Pepper ignored her. "I see you lost no time in renting out my room now I'm not here to take out the trash, Tony."
Thor.
"Don't tell Tony," Steve whispered. "Howard, please don't tell Tony. I don't want to hurt him."
She seemed almost as surprised by this behaviour as Steve was... But then he hadn't really known Tony long enough to judge what was usual for him. Dismissing the thought, he skirted round the embracing couple and offered his hand to Hill, who shook it firmly.
"Guess it's magic," Natasha replied. "Sorcerers live in style. That's one hell of a Victorian mansion."
Once he had Rhodey settled on the sofa and had offered beer, which both Steve and Rhodey had refused, he poured himself the large whisky he was sure he was going to need and settled in a chair strategically facing him. Lori, beer in hand, watched with amusement from her perch on the edge of the armchair.
"The effect was all I'd hoped. The locals spotted the Other Guy—"
The squad commander, then.
It was Steve who broke it. "Shower. Change of clothing. Go."
Pepper threw up her hands. "Oh, for pity's sake, Tony! What does it matter?"
It disturbed Steve that he had far more personal evidence that the Norse gods existed than he had of the reality of Jehovah, Jesus or the Virgin Mary.
"You haven't answered my question," the President pointed out, as she rose and made her way over to the door, silent on stockinged feet. "Are you here to kill me?"
"That is the arrangement. I drive you to the border, and Hunter here accompanies me there and back here, no doubt with that gun at my head." He bowed with deep irony to Steve, with a wide gesture towards the vehicle in which he had, presumably, arrived. "Lead the way, brother."
Jan was grinning. "You don't understand, sweetie. That's the real thing. Tony used some of his secret tech to shift it out of Manhattan and Hank shrank it down to about a foot and brought it here in a helicopter. We decided that this is the best size to work—"
"I'm not so sure. I'm their go-to expert for Asgardian tech and—"
Steve felt a rush of relief. All Tony's wild emotion of the night before seemed to have retreated, leaving the familiar teasing affection, though there was a reserve in both his voice and expression, even in his position beneath the windows, as far from the bed as he could decently sit, that Steve hadn't seen for some time.
Always supposing Hank had bailed out at all. If not, then both he and Bruce had been transported to who-knew-where, but certainly into the midst of a technologically high-powered enemy.
Tony's guffaw was spontaneous – and very relieved. "Bad guess. And why stop at one woman? After all, I never commit to anyone, do I?"
"And Tony pushing his luck," Steve added. "I don't think I did that much damage. There's the effect of him tumbling head first into his father's trap to consider."
Unfortunately, that explained his presence in someone else's board room, surrounded by politicians and company Presidents and Chairmen who were all spouting arguments in which "manage the transition" and "share technology" and "give the United States a major bargaining advantage" were repeated
He tossed the buckle away from him, hearing the thud as it hit the wall, knowing it would stick there as if it had been glued. Using his weight to bear Steve to the floor, and his body to hide what he was doing with the wire, he hooked it into one of the terminals on the edge of the arc reactor, then pulled Steve's face tight into his body, just in case he was tempted to look.
"And then you met Hank?" he said, hurriedly, to divert her, with a smile to take any sting out of it.
Steve stood frozen in fear, staring at the surface of the ocean and finding no trace of machine or human. He activated the communicator in his ear. "Tony? Tony!" He could hear the note of panic in his own voice. "Jarvis, is Tony—?
Tony worked surprisingly hard, with the same fierce concentration Steve had seen during his manic bouts of creative engineering. It wasn't as easy for him as it was for Steve, whose muscle memory was phenomenal, but no one could fault his application. On those days where there were no lessons, Steve could usually persuade Tony to spar with him and it seemed to him that Tony enjoyed those sessions more than the formal lessons.
"What about Rogers?"
"So what happened to the other one – the Soul Stone – the one I fought Clint over, the one on that hell planet—?"
"Let me guess. SHIELD. You're talking about SHIELD," Tony indentified.
Even as he spoke, Steve applied muscle to the door. To his surprise it slid open with a sinister creak.
Now Tony could hear her coughing. She had plainly lost both the bug and contact with Jarvis.
There was a long pause. Then, "He said it was better if he did not get involved."
"Nothing left by the lightning," Thor said.
He wished Thor was here, even if only for a conference call, but an open line was too dangerous.
"Nope. Retrieved it. After all, I made it. Well, part of it. I don't do shrinkage." Tony gestured towards the open doors, through which he could hear the babble of voices. "Shall we?"
"Jan, go back!" Steve ordered urgently.
Steve grinned. "Guess they were there – probably in disguise."
"I can understand that," Tony agreed. "But that isn't what Cap was really asking. He and I both want to know what triggered the explosion."
"It's as far as I'll go in compromise, Steve," he said. "Either that or I'm going to pick you up and carry you."
He had to be here somewhere...
Tony thought.
Bruce and Tony exchanged glances, but it was Steve who replied; "They'd certainly be interested in it."
It had all gone wrong since he had wandered into the kitchen this morning and found no trace of either Steve or Bruce. Unexpectedly lonely, he had sauntered down to Bruce's lab, only to be barred entry.
Two men leaped out of the nearest truck and strode over to the SUV. Both were carrying rifles.
Steve had to bite the inside of his cheeks to stop himself laughing.
T'Challa frowned. "Some of them. The ones I and my father and grandfather put in place. It may be enough. Let us hope it is, but as for the ancient magic maintained by the Panther god—" He shrugged.
Steve – it was good to have a name, and one he quite liked, even if he didn't recognise it – saw the resemblance at once. They had the same regular, handsome features and the same vivid blue eyes. Howard's hair was a shade or two lighter and he wore a neat hairline moustache, while Tony was a couple of inches taller, with wider shoulders and more muscle, but both were slim, graceful and elegant.
"They asked some ants. This is now my life. Have you listened to yourself? Those words coming from your mouth are just, well, wrong."
"Put her on, Jarvis. Audio only," Tony ordered.
"I made it—"
Beyond lay more forest. At the head of the valley were cliffs riven both vertically and horizontally –
"There was nothing you could have done. I had no wish to complicate the situation," Jarvis replied.
"Didn't want to brag too much," Tony replied. So Steve kissed him again. "Ouch. This is a new form of torture, I need a safeword."
"We haven't had time to exchange details," Tony said, making a cutting motion with one hand across his throat at Steve. "So, a portal and mercenaries?"
"So, why are you in my lobby with guns – even if one of them will probably jam or blow up on you – instead of phoning my secretary to make an appointment next year, just like everyone else?"
they were all dead. This shouldn't hurt so much." His voice faded on a sob.
"Contact me if you or Erik – or, for that matter, Dr Foster or anyone on her staff – need transport. Or lab accommodation here."
task."
"Isn't it? Who else is there?"
"Sir, your heart rate is 171 beats per minute, your blood pressure is 161/104 and your body temperature is ninety nine degrees. You are not fit to operate the Iron Man suit."
"What's missing?" he asked.
Steve could feel Tony's self-confidence, and his certainty that Steve would pick up and follow his lead. And he was going to—
"Sex?"
"What?"
Tony leaned his elbows on the table, avoiding the empty coffee mugs, his chin on his hands, and eyed Clint and Natasha over the top of his sunglasses. He wasn't going to be subtle. They didn't appreciate subtle. "You owe me and Steve a real big favour."
"Sorry, Cap, but I'm going in through your window." Tony had already activated the laser beam was cutting through the glass, close to the frame.
Since when had Jarvis started calling Steve 'Steve'? As far as Tony knew he'd never done that with any other human.
"Those have just been extended," Hill retorted.
"But a better warrior?" Steve said, with a nod towards the abandoned sword.
"There are seven thousand six hundred and thirty two Stark employees currently in the building, which is slightly below average for daytime, sir, with approximately one and a half thousand working at night and weekends."
"Already on it, sir.
"There's a robe on the chair," Tony's voice said. "If you want to preserve your modesty."
He was so, so cold. One hand grasping steel that froze him even through the glove, the other reaching, reaching. The world was black and white and grey, and Bucky was falling, oh so painfully slowly, into the black, bottomless abyss, his face turned up to Steve, blue eyes – the only touch of colour there was – wide and accusing...
Steve dropped him abruptly, grabbed his wrists in one big hand, forcing them above his head, pinning Tony against the nearest wall. With his free hand, he grabbed Tony's T-shirt by the collar and ripped the garment away.
"Okay," Steve said. "But promise me that if I can help, you'll let me."
Tony had no practice at dealing with emotional secrets. He'd left that kind of thing to Rhodey and his father. The only person he knew who was worse at it was Pepper.
that is true," Danvers said, "and I haven't seen any identification, mister, you are on an Air Force base, attempting to detain an Air Force officer and defying the orders of the Air Force base commander, Colonel MacTavish, and a special agent of the Secretary of the Air Force from whom he has requested assistance. Me."
"I regret to tell you, sirs," said Jarvis's voice, "that there has been an explosion in the secure holding room. It appears the intruders attempted to blast their way through the wall and into the elevator shaft, unaware every surface was armoured."
Steve had that stoic look on his face that Tony had come to realise covered nervousness. It probably put the fear of God into everyone else, given his height, s musculature and breadth of shoulder. Currently he was scanning the area while tapping the sunglasses he would probably need within the hour on the palm of his hand. He nodded slightly at Tony and inclined his head towards two sets of headlights coming towards them. His stance had shifted, balanced on the balls of his feet, ready to move fast. Tony fingered the bracelet of the only-partly-a-watch on his left wrist, which, despite a lack of contact with Jarvis, could summon the armour from New York to close about him. Unfortunately, even if he activated it right now it would take hours to get here.
"No?" Tony pulled back so that he could look into Steve's face. His eyebrows were up.
"You're sure?" It was little more than a whisper.
"Hey, Iron Man does not clank!"
"More than a guy in white, apparently," Steve said. He rose to his feet and stretched. "Meanwhile, I'll show you where you can wash."
The serum had, indeed, done something to Steve. He had come as soon as Tony had entered him, but he didn't soften until after two more orgasms...
"Sir, this area of Washington has a concentrated night life, and the District of Columbia's crime rate is approximately three times the national average."
"Dear God," Steve's voice said. "Tony, I'm coming up. The gas probably won't affect me..."
Hogun unwrapped the bundle he was carrying and spread the contents over the end of the bed. "Change into these. Quickly."
Tony flinched, but his voice was perfectly normal now as he protested, "Watch it, Rogers. Saving my life doesn't give you licence to cop a feel." His breathing was regular now, too and the ribs beneath cotton and skin hadn't felt broken or even cracked, though Tony was plainly badly bruised. It didn't seem worth pushing it, at the moment at any rate.
He shook himself. He had no right to lecture Steve about recklessness, one way or the other. Time to put his feelings on the subject behind him.
"Has Odin authorised that journey?" Heimdall asked, his voice so deep it seemed to shake the very floor beneath their feet.
"Out, all of you!" Frigga ordered. "I need to tend to my patient. Yes, that includes you, Thor."
Tony's heart was now thundering, but he kept his face and voice casual. "I'll think about it."
The woman standing behind Howard – Roberta? – stepped forward. "You did not come here looking for a dead body," she pointed out, her voice soft but assured. It occurred to Steve that it was a voice that would lull you into a false sense of security, if you happened to be opposed it its owner.
Tony shook his head, unwilling to let his disappointment show. "I'm beginning to suspect something's going on there – probably has a threesome going with Hank and Jan. Unless they've imported a load of dancing girls."
for asking, but are you a product of my father's labs?"
"Janet Van Dyne is off on some errand she didn't brief us about and Pym is locked in Bruce's old lab with a 'Do Not Disturb Even in the Event of Nuclear War' sign on the door."
"I remember the help you've given me, Mr Stark. And please call me Charles."
"Yes, sir," Jarvis acknowledged.
Tony grinned. He was, reluctantly, beginning to like Velasco.
It was meant to be reassuring. Which was kind but not helpful.
"When I was little she'd come to consult with the Old Man," he expanded. "They were a formidable team. God only knew what adding you to mix would have done: tyrants would tremble, congressmen quake—"
"Fury's an idiot. Cap needs challenging, not babying."
Tony began counting off on his fingers which was awkward with one hand still clutching the whisky glass. "Pep, an' Happy's gone with her, Rhodey's been ordered not to associate with me, Mom and Dad and Jarvis – the original Jarvis I mean, who was our butler an' I used to hope was really my dad – Yinsen, Phil Coulson, Ty, Obie, Bethany –"
"You're being taken prisoner. What else? I have other things to do than hold your hands." Iron Man turned away and flew back towards Hatut Zeraze compound, to warn the occupying force to patch it together for the new arrivals.
Tony sighed, and washed the capsules down, draining the glass, which he retained as he wandered off towards the storage area.
Tony did not hesitate. He was already changing his grip, swinging Steve, below him, an arm around his waist as he said, "Gotcha. I'll make that fifty feet."
It was worth every concession to have her back as CEO, though he would have preferred to have her back in his bed. Maybe that would be possible. A man could hope.
Tony nodded.
The image vanished
the pieces so they could be removed outside, where Tony had improvised as series of small explosions which had left them in ruins.
He hoped the storm was going that way, but much faster than he was. He certainly did not want to surface in the midst of it, but if it came to a choice between surfacing in rough seas and his oxygen running out – or, more likely, the carbon dioxide choking him – then he would have to risk the wind and waves.
Jan grinned unrepentantly. "Not the way that sounded, though he wouldn't be the only one, would he?" she added, winking at Tony.
With the street deserted, Steve risked a comment: "This weather seems... convenient."
After a while, Tony said, "Out there, beyond the portal, I saw... I saw the stars in all their unblinking glory, the swirl of the galaxies, and the aliens' mothership. Jesus, Cap, it was
But he still didn't quite believe it.
Slowly, the woman who had challenged him laid her gun on the ground and, one by one, the other SHIELD agents followed her lead. The Wakandans moved in to collect their weapons, and Tony's interpreter steered his vehicle in close and spoke quietly.
"Why would the staff leave them here? Anyhow, Steve—"
Though, short of tying Tony up then locking him in the workshop, Steve could not think of a way he could have stopped him – and that would have put an end to the friendship that meant so much to him.
"About four months ago. We took down a Mexican criminal cartel which had decided to try a little sideline in piracy in Gulf of Mexico. Routine stuff and, despite what Tony says, I was perfectly safe. Cream? Sugar?"
"Look it up. Evil Overlord List. It's very educational. If Loki or your old foe the Red Skull had read it we might not be here now. Meanwhile, go take that shower and I'll make you breakfast."
Pain stabbed his chest again, greying his vision. It was an odd sort of grey, though, more like the smogs of his early life, in New York and later London, tinged with orange.
But he sure as hell had implied it.
Three stones still sat in the pockets built into the foam interior of the case – Red and Purple and Blue, Reality and Power and Space. Good. The two that he had sent onward had gone, though whether he had sent them into the correct position and time was uncertain.
Steve took a deep breath and tried to find words.
Then the sky was steady above him and Tony realised, far too late, that once again Steve was throwing himself between him and danger, whatever the cost.
"That doesn't answer my question, Jay. Why Steve and not me?"
Once again, he found it difficult to take in the extent of Tony's wealth.
Tony looked at him over the top of his sunglasses. "If you don't I'll come looking for you."
Rumour had it that Janet Van Dyne, who had inherited a fortune when she was a couple of years older than Tony, was dating Dr Henry Pym and had taken him firmly in hand.
"Wakanda?" Natasha asked.
is ridiculous! I can't imagine going into battle wearing that," Steve protested. "I'm not a superhero. For all you know I'm a ringer. For all I know I could be a ringer!" It was a cry of frustration.
"The girl is Whitney Stane. Madame Masque. The mask allows her to disguise herself as anything or anyone, but it has also affected her mind. She escaped from SHIELD custody over a year ago. The Doombot is a substitute for its creator, almost identical and also capable of disguising itself. It was the one that flew them in, as Whitney can't – fly, that is. Victor Von Doom was the ruler of Latveria – a genius capable of inventing such a thing. He's also dead."
"Intercontinental," Betty said. "Do you suppose—?"
"You're lying," Happy protested. "She would never—"
"The battery is currently in need of recharging," Jarvis said, "but I am monitoring the number. I have record of fifteen texts and eleven voicemail messages, mainly where you have missed an appointment. However, Ms Potts has left several messages asking you contact her."
"With a whole bunch of your damn arrogant thugs telling me to butt out. You get down here, Danvers and sort this damn thing out."
"Anyone else know where you are?" Tony asked.
As he tumbled through the air, Iron Man caught a glimpse of the woman standing on the remains of the prow, arms raised, then the man with the sword snatching the gun from where it was lying on the deck, with the man who had been carrying it unconscious – or dead – beside it.
"That's the original," Steve corrected gently.
"Do you need a sling for the shoulder?" Tony asked Steve, because yelling at him could wait.
"Satisfactory," Pepper said, hesitating a little so she was in step with Tony as they entered the Board Room.
Magic?
"We aim to please. Meanwhile, I need some decisions from you."
Tony straightened his spine and glared at the pair of them. "Generals! Professors! I've dealt with both and they're wimps compared to those sharks on the Board. Look, I'd love to have you around to instruct me from your vast experience, particularly if you suited up – and God, would I love to see Clayton's face if confronted by the Hulk – but Pe— Mrs Arbogast would kill me—"
The blonde SHIELD agent who looked so like Peggy Carter was standing at his shoulder, talking to him in a low voice. As he and Thor descended lightly to the ground behind them, Tony began to catch what she was saying.
One hand slid up to cup his face – and Steve didn't move, didn't want to move.
Then Jarvis alerted him to what appeared to be a firefight close to the borders. Gleefully passing this intelligence to the small group of warriors who had been accompanying him and signalling them to follow, he sped towards the battle.
"Hank's is fair," Jan said. "He's around somewhere. Dr Henry Pym, possibly the world's greatest biochemist – maybe he can help."
Tony's voice said in his ear, and this time only in his ear: "Her father is Army Lieutenant-General Thaddeus Ross, also known as 'Thunderbolt'. She and Bruce were working for him on replicating the super-soldier serum when Bruce's 'accident' occurred."
"I had no choice!" Steve was not going to back down on that point.
"The girl was probably Whitney," Tony said. "She must have stolen the ring to try and make up for not finding the artefact. Did you tell her I had it? She turned up at home with a Doombot in tow. Dad and Steve destroyed that one and took her into custody."
Howard's next shot hit dead centre on the Big Green Riding Hood's chest, but it didn't even seem to stagger him.
"When did that spring up? The zoning— Wait. Tendring. Oh, fuck it, how obvious can you get and Fury not spot it?"
Marilyn Bartowlski had, by some quirk of genetics, inherited her father's height and blond hair and her mother's tight curls and huge brown eyes, while her skin was milky coffee. The blondness disguised the fact that the hair was now turning grey, so she looked far younger than she was.
Excuses. The combined technology had as much potential to change the world, benefit mankind and make him an even greater fortune than the ARC reactors alone. He should have seen that long ago.
"Mr Potts, it's Tony Stark. Dad said you wanted to talk to me."
"The Statue of Liberty was kind of a target for super villains in the pulps when I was a kid."
Unexpectedly, a good five seconds after it had fallen, the tail bounced.
"And because you and Steven are my shield brothers, and I wish you every happiness, for as long or as short a time as you have together."
Jan gave one of her characteristic snorts. "Honey, he wouldn't have been able to stop talking about it."
But it mattered so much more today, and he had so much more to lose.
"I've been working," Tony said. "I gather Hank's been doing the same."
And Tony moved with it, without thought, between the girl and the monster, powering up the palm repulsors as he did so.
Steve leaned in close. "Luckily," he whispered, "considering considering your usual response to authority."
"Richards had a definite reputation," Hank agreed. "Wasn't there a headline in
"Jarvis has the source pinpointed – a comms tower just over the county line," Tony told Steve. "Looks like it's Ten Rings behind everything, including the weather and power loss."
"That if I don't take the risk with Steve I'll regret it."
"You're only peeved because you didn't build it first," Steve told him. Relieved, he turned towards the woman he had rescued, but as he did so he spotted something unusual moving just above his head. Instantly, he snatched it from the air.
"Cap is healing nicely. As for the First Aid kit, I'll send them a dozen. Tell your boss he can be proud of them, would you, Miranda?"
Convenient again.
Ah, that was clever, and if his previous statement had contained all the evidence he had it might have convinced him, because he wanted to be convinced. He raised his eyebrows. "And that included Fury?"
Instead, everything was still. There was no wind, no rain, no hail...
"Have you thought this through?" Steve asked her. "Rhodes—"
There was only one way to cut through this babble. "No."
"I was afraid of that," T'Challa said, replacing the access panel. "I will have to petition the Panther god and persuade him to let your armour into Wakanda."
That having been taken care of, he felt able to take notice of his surroundings. The bathroom was bigger than the main room of the apartment he and his mother had lived in before the war... before she'd died... before everything changed. It was white and black, with touches of scarlet, which appealed to his sense of form and colour, and looked almost more futuristic than the Helicarrier control room. The shower stall, for instance – well, he presumed it was a shower stall and he really, really wanted a shower right now – was bare of any sort of controls, and he couldn't even see the shower heads, unless they were the tiny metal objects buried in the tiles.
Thor shook his head. "Me. Though it appears to be common to the sons of Odin." He folded his huge hands around Tony's on the beer glass. "The love between warriors – shield brothers and sisters – is a thing I have experienced more than once. But the first... He was less than fifty years older than I, a great warrior, the bravest of us all, and the best of Asgard. He was dearer to me than any other. Then one day he was gone, and no one knew how or where. We – the Warriors Three and Loki and I searched for him – but that was many years ago. My regret, which I hold to this day, is that I never shared his bed, never dared to act or ask. I do not think he would have refused me, but I chose for him. You understand what I am saying?"
"No, sir. The generators and the grid are still fully functional."
"But I am of this universe. As are you. As is my uncle Dormammu. He may not love me, but he would regard an attack on me as a grave insult to the Dark Dimension."
Normally, on waking from such a nightmare, he would have asked Jarvis if Tony was in his workshop, and, if he was, would have made his way down to sit, watch and talk. But Jarvis did not have a presence here and, even if he had, Tony did not have a workshop or a lab.
Inside, it was cool and dim, save where the sunlight streamed in through the open doors, illuminating rough-surfaced walls hung with rugs, weapons and animal skins.
"Three of 'em. I sent the Mind and Time Stones back to where they should be right now. If hadn't been for Thanos's horned minion I could have put the space stone back—"
"It's Tony's private plane – and he's big into systems redundancy," Jan said, "so I'll bet it does. Come on, Betty, let's talk to Carol." She flew off, Betty following in her wake.
He had been surprised when the hammer had slapped into his palm, signalling that he continued to be worthy of it.
"Exactly. But the Norn stones merely pose a threat to the Nine Worlds, including both Asgard and Midgard."
"Most things are possible in the Mirror Dimension," the Ancient One replied with the first hint of a smile that Tony had seen.
"Depends on whether she had weapons and if I had my shield," Steve said, the tension visibly beginning to leave his body. "I'm just fast and strong. She's all technique. I wish I had her training."
"There is a call on from the local police frequency about the e-StarkStore in White Plains that perhaps you should hear, sir." Jarvis did not wait for acknowledgement, because the voice changed to that of a woman, rough and urgent, plainly scared and trying to control it, with the sound of gunfire behind. "— wholesale destruction – probably a terrorist attack — Oh my God, the things are running wild! There's blood and limbs everywhere. That one cut right through— We're retreating. Guns are useless. Repeat, guns are useless. They cut right through Kevlar—" The voice cut off, then came through again. "Sir! You can't go in there—"
Instantly, the display surrounded him, their own security cameras giving a three hundred and sixty degrees full colour and holographic display of the area around the tower, while below that were ranged the banks of smaller displays, mainly in black and white and all in 2D, some fuzzier than others.
The flier had turned right, away from the towers of the city, and was ghosting along the edge of the buffs, dipping through the jungle as it descended towards the coastal plain. Through an occasional gap in the trees, Steve could see that that plain was heavily farmed, criss-crossed by the silver threads of irrigation ditches. The white sails of boats on the lakes and ocean were mirrored by the white sails of windmills on the green plain, reminding him of those he had seen in the American Midwest.
"Please, Tony," Pepper said, her eyes seeming about four times their normal size.
"I don't remember much until I... er... woke up and found myself the size of a doll in the middle of Oklahoma. Things got a bit exciting for a while, until I spotted some buildings. Once inside, I managed to avoid the inhabitants but not the local radio station, which  one of the kids was tuned to permanently at full blast. I needed to let you know where I was, so I ... suited up, to use your phrase.
Howard ended his tour – which Steve noted did not include the 'armoury' – on the long, wide balcony that swept around three quarters of the house – mansion – with a whole panorama of city skyscrapers, river estuary, and islands laid out in front of them. On a clearer day he supposed they might even be able to see the ocean – the 'Atlantic' according to Howard.
Steve nodded. Tony pulled him to his feet. "Then we'll let Room Service bring us coffee and clear away the debris."
"Most unfortunate," a deep male voice was saying.
"T'Challa is chosen. My high priest."
"Easy, easy. Betty, hold your fire," he said, dropping the helmet he was still holding and raising both hands, palms towards the pilot. "Jarvis, is this Colonel Danvers?"
And there had been Steve.
"To get back to the point," Steve said, "if it was SHIELD, what were they trying to do?"
"Really. Thor's in Asgard, but hopefully he'll be back. Your father won't. I want to know why he didn't tell you about the hidden lab. He told you about the base itself."
There was no response.
The young woman grinned at him, threw the drapes wide, disconnected the alarm system with an ease that screamed both long practice and electronic expertise, and opened the window.
As he'd been certain they would, those accusations broke Pepper's remaining control on her formidable temper. Her hands were balled at her sides and her eyes were suspiciously bright as she snarled, "Fuck you, Tony Stark! If you really believe that, check my bank account."
"Whoa!
"Are you sure that's wise, Boss?" Friday asked.
Steve was hanging onto the back of a sofa, his face contorted in pain.
"It's an amazingly good disguise," Tony told him, plainly pleased with the effect.
"You're just nosy. Like me." Tony reached for a pair of pliers and used them to pick up the envelope.
"Absolutely. Privacy's one of the things that's guaranteed."
"Tony's right about calling the Iron Man armour, particularly if you don't want to involve your people. Apart from that, our priority must be to separate the Hatut Zeraze and White Wolf's other allies from their outside support. That means finding and destroying the portals here in Wakanda."
"My, we're grouchy. You can't always expect to find me where you left me, Mr Grump. I have people to see, research to do, a company to run—"
"I had a Hulk," Tony joked, but he wasn't smiling any longer.
He thought Tony wasn't going to answer. Then, "You seemed okay with it," he said at last, and he seemed genuinely shocked.
The arrival of the cops might give him a chance to break out, but until he knew where the controller and the stones were it might be too much of a risk.
"Your problem, Tony."
Tony thought, in outrage, as the shock wave rolled over him. Then he lifted his head and looked quickly left and right.
"The Air Force Office of Special Intelligence," Jarvis's voice said. "Colonel Danvers may know a lot more than we do about that."
"Your actions put the population of Wakanda at risk," Tony snapped. "Mine saved one and a half million lives. What was more, I was wearing several million bucks' worth of battle armour. You had nothing.
Raising an eyebrow, he answered it. "Whoever you are, this had better be important."
He probably could do it, too, while he was in the suit, and now wasn't the time to contest that claim.
"Of course not, Tony." Steve's reply was amused, but there was a note of unease at the back of it that made Tony's stomach lurch.
"Your father—"
"No."
was what Tony thought. What he did was activate the sensors in his suit so that Natasha's relieved, "He's alive," was no surprise.
"Tony, nearly everyone has better taste in art than you do. So, where are we going?"
"That's tomorrow. Thanks, Mr Hogan." Steve shed his pants and began assembling his uniform.
"None of us expect to die," Steve pointed out while doing some quick mental arithmetic. "But he must have been in his seventies."
Last time they had encountered it he had spent the whole of his time with Gene trying to keep the rings out of the Mandarin's hands. Things had certainly changed.
Sorry for the delay, folks.  Still, the next chapter is about three quarters complete. (I hope.)
"Run – through the gates – don't look back," he ordered, dropping the woman's arm and swinging to face the aircraft.
were working with SHIELD. Neither of us would have been alive if it hadn't been for SHIELD. Phil recruited me to help keep you safe. He and Fury had – have – your best interests at heart, Tony. You can't go on like this. This continual risking of your life and other peoples'."
Damn! Steve thought. Oh God, that explained so much. And left him stranded, because Howard had effectively locked Steve out of the life of the most astonishing man he had ever met. All he could think of to say was, "I'm sorry."
"They feel... different," Tony observed, grinning. "Let's go get coffee and maybe send for takeout and I'll explain."
"On your screens now, sir."
So he was taking them down with a new ruthless efficiency which owed much to his martial arts instructors, when out of the corner of his eye he saw a sudden flash of light and heard a yelp of surprise and pain.
"In this hidden lab I have stored the original Vita-ray equipment and its design specifications. Everyone thinks I destroyed it, but I couldn't bring myself to do it, even though all my experiments show that, without the serum, it has no discernible effect. Now, though... now I no longer trust my own judgement. I'm putting my faith in yours."
Perforce, Steve and Hank followed.
"Then let's get on with it," Tony said, trying to ignore the feeling of dread that set his heart pounding and closed his throat. "Should be interesting.
"No, but they took your watch."
Instinctively, Tony reached for a more personal tone. "What's going on, Steve?"
"You ran away. Captain America ran away rather than tell me face to face how I'd offended him – you."
"Damn right you're not an agent – or, at least, not a good one. But you were on first name terms with Coulson, who got into both the Malibu house and the Tower with depressing ease – something you had the information and access to Jarvis to facilitate." He shook his head. "I should have known then, when I joked that the security breach was on you. Because it was. Deliberately."
"First thing of all, the Department of Defense have persuaded the government to enact an emergency measure granting the Army exclusive and perpetual copyright on the Captain America name and uniform. They're also claiming that, as Cap was upgraded by a 'government project' – and they carefully don't specify which government project – he belongs to them, body and soul."
"It's a hang over from my wild playboy days. Which you and Pepper tell me are over. Apparently."
Steve quietly released his seat belt, checked he knew how to find reverse gear, and plastered as stupid an expression as he could manage onto his face as the bigger of the two men, wearing coveralls and a scowl, strode over to peer through the broken window.
"Could be another part of the puzzle," Steve suggested.
Tony took his cue from the smile. "Yes," he said firmly.
"Let's go get 'em, Thor. Only this time I think we're better off with a long range attack."
He was going to drown. And he knew that wasn't an easy way to die.
"We can't take the chance that they see Cap and start asking questions."
"He may be starting to doubt Steve Rogers too," Howard admitted.
Damn it, those fucking aliens had messed up one of his chief pleasures in life: blowing things up—
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said. "I really don't care what Hank thinks of my past."
"It is. Or rather, it contains the computers Stark needs and is one of the places where our enemies appear to come and go at will."
"What am I gonna do, Steve?" he asked after a while. "Pepper's gone, and for nothing. The Avengers are falling apart before they've even come together."
"God, no, I— just—"
"Yeah, she's a big city girl and she's more devoted to Stark Industries than she ever was to me. She's in love with business and power broking, and she may end up as, I don't know, Chair of the Fed or the IMF or the WTO. Anyway, the farm is now a research facility for me, and Bruce, when he comes back, and Jane Foster and Erik Selvig, when they're not in the field. There will be others, as well as Enhanced needing sanctuary and training. You could help us with that. That alien invasion that's coming will be worse than the Chitauri, worse than Ultron and Loki. That was Thor's message. And I wish the hell he'd come back because we're gonna need him. Just as we need you."
"We'll all get to work on it," Hank said.
But there was a shadow moving on the light, a bulbous shape, and was that a tail?
Once he got into his stride, the story flowed out of Rhodey. Pepper, supercharged with hurt and annoyance, and misusing all her Stark Solutions privileges, had hacked into Stark Industries computers and, with familiar intuition, had found all the properties that Stark Industries, Howard Stark and Stark Solutions owned. She had also ascertained that there was property just released from the Trust, now owned directly by Tony.
Instantly, the medic broke into a voluble flow of Japanese, to which Hank responded cautiously.
"Not 'Cap', please. Not any more," Steve said, dully.
Steve was looking dubious. "That's kind of you, Tony, but—"
His appearance remained unfamiliar, though the laptop did not. Which was so very wrong.
The ring that had created the portal.
"McGuire control to Iron Man. We have you on radar... And yeah, buddy, we could—"
Encouraged, Tony went on, "Well, you do make me feel like a horny eighteen-year-old, though right now it's more like a horny eighty-year-old. Something to do with being dragged out of an exploding Ferrari and rolling down a hillside. Is this what you call sympathy, Rogers?"
"Also his girlfriend, according to Jan."
He asked it. "But he was still looking for me?"
Even in an elevator this express, the ride seemed to take forever.
But Steve had that contained look that meant he was furious about something.
"Don't you have work to do, Tony?" Bruce had enquired, from the safety of his lab. "I don't need distracting right now, thank you."
But the pain in his chest was easing, the HUD was flickering to life, Jarvis was calling him...
"What secret project is that?" Pepper asked sharply.
"That's between you and her," Marilyn said firmly. "But it's not why I wanted to see you personally – and, though I presume that ever-present super-computer of yours is recording these proceedings, I want your assurance that, otherwise, this room is secure."
"Transportation portal," Steve explained, steadying himself by gripping the back of her seat, though he guessed the question had been rhetorical.
"So you say. I repeat: where's Stark?"
What really hurt, though, was that, though plainly disapproving, Steve seemed amused. And, worse, what he disapproved of was Tony's treatment of the women and what he found funny was his floundering attempts to eject them.
"He was," the Ancient One said, seemingly unconcerned, but she rose to her feet in a swirl of robes. "We all need to think carefully about what is to be done and how it can be done. Ring for tea. We shall be back shortly." She signaled to Tony and Natasha to follow her and swept out of the room.
Tony's knee connected solidly with the his groin, and he broke the hold in the way Happy had taught him, even as Cap yelled, "Stark, go!" and the shield sliced into the air towards them.
But they could investigate that later.
They were wasting time. And would be until Jan wore him down. Short answer: forget the argument. "Okay, Wasp, get your ass and our listening device down there. Make damn sure you stay out of sight."
"The Chitauri themselves are the same mixture of mechanical and semi-living tissue as the Leviathans, right down to their not-exactly-cellular structure. Probably to their equivalent of DNA, if I could find it. Which I can't. I presume they are neuter, just like the Leviathans, because they have no trace of reproductive organs. If anything, they appear to have been, well, built... or maybe
"Y'know...this thing... device... whatever – I mean, you're Tony Stark. You must be able to find out how it works."
A torpedo-shaped bolt of red and gold screamed across the heads of the crowd, bright against the growing darkness. The crowd stopped listening to White Wolf; those beneath it fell to the earth, while the rest scattered towards the jungle.
There was a bed. In front of him.
And the Hulk ... shrank, so swiftly it left an afterimage, as if he had been animated. Then there was just the Hulk, two inches tall, bewildered and furious.
"Hey, I learned to read so I could play Infocom text games." It was true. He'd been three and a half, according to his mother. Trying to copy her sternest glare, he looked hard at the Panther. "Assuming that we are not actually in the middle of a game of Zork, where are we?"
"Which is why the better option is getting me an internet or international phone connection."
"Better have eyes on. Give me a ride?"
"Tony! Tony, report in, dammit. Talk to us." Steve's voice was harsh in his ears.
"I don't think so," Natasha said. "We spotted them first."
Bruce didn't even bother to answer that; they'd had this conversation too many times already. He said, instead, "So we know they're still experimenting, probably on the Abomination and who knows what else."
Tony dropped quickly towards the ground, looking for the bright blue of Steve's uniform suit, and there it was, in the midst of a group of darker-clad SHIELD agents.
Steve woke to dimness, and to pain that pounded through his head and jaw. Since the serum, he had almost forgotten what toothache was like, but now he was being forcefully and unpleasantly reminded. Groaning, he forced himself to sit up and take notice of his surroundings.
"What's that?" Pepper asked, startling him so much he spun with his right hand up as if to blast her with the repulsors he wasn't wearing. Hurriedly, he turned the gesture into one of pushing aside the lock of hair that had fallen onto his forehead while his left hand hovered over the sensor that would kill the display.
That second time he'd reached out with his Extremis-enhanced mind and found... nothing save the dumbest of monitors and computer controlled feed lines.
Steve turned to give him a quizzical look, and Tony raised his glass in an obvious toast. "Thanks for the retrieval."
Were they here to investigate the burnt-out cameras? Or for some other reason?
"She's acting on Dad's instruction," Tony replied. "Among other things, Fury's trying to get us to pay for building another helicarrier."
Who was he kidding? He wanted to stay close to Tony and Nat.
"He sees all things, including this strange weather. The Rainbow Bridge is recently repaired, and I needed but my father's permission to come to your aid. When I heard the villain boasting he had slain you, I feared that had taken too long."
"Not that I saw. It went under the waves and the ship vanished. Not before the woman had done something to the suit, though."
"Tell you what?" Tony asked, with feigned indifference. "Scientific details that'll just go over your head?"
"And this time it was a version of the Other Guy who could recognise Steve and Jan and Hank as friends, and go to them for aid," Bruce went on. "In fact, the Other Guy felt so safe with them he went to sleep on Hank's jacket in the back of the SUV, transformed into me and I woke up full sized. The effect of the Pym particles must have worn off."
As it was, once he had sent the armour back to its storage niche, he had to catch his breath before checking that all the guests had left, then initiating the house's security, specifically barring anyone even remotely connected with SHIELD from entering – except for his father, but there he had every intention of getting his story in first.
But it was only when he was entering the shower that he noticed that the remains of the crust covered his entire body. It washed away easily enough, but the memory of it was not so easy to banish.
"Nope. But they'll report back to Fury that you aren't Cap."
Thor reached over Tony's shoulder and placed a hand on Steve's forehead, then moved it to cover his heart. "What evil caused this?"
As soon as T'Challa and Tony had left the parking area, Steve and Okoye slid out from the back of the SUV and into the remains of the planting.
But he could wait. Tony had promised that they would talk this through, and he was going to hold him to it.
She gave him that little, twisted, affectionate smile that was so
"Anthony Stark," T'Challa said, rising to his feet. "Wakanda thanks you for your assistance in the restoration of its legitimate government, the rout of its enemies and the defeat and capture of the traitors of the Hatut Zeraze. We are aware of the cost to you and extend our condolences. For this service we declare you and your allies friends of Wakanda in perpetuity."
"That's even weirder. Ross has been given first refusal on the Hulk, as if they've somehow managed to tame the Other Guy but are willing to hand him over for... well, they aren't very clear on that, but favours are definitely involved. And what sound like threats."
"No." Tony leaned in closer, letting Steve's body shelter him from the cold ocean wind skipping in over the swell. "Must admit I like having you around when I'm working, if only to bring me coffee. You know how to be quiet."
"After that stunt? Try and stop me."
he thought, hoping she would catch the heartfelt message.
Steve turned back to Tony, apparently unconcerned by the disappearance of his escape route, and reached out to tip his head to one side and shine the flashlight on it. "It doesn't look too bad – though we need to get Bruce to take a look at you."
Which wasn't what he wanted at all. He gritted his teeth and squirmed even harder against his bonds, glaring at where T'Challa was standing. Something about his eyes told Tony he was aware... but of what? Of the fact that he was helpless? That he was aiding his enemies? That Steve—
"Is it Van Dyne?"
They, at least, knew the Hulk ate bullets.
He wondered if there had been a measure of what was now called 'genetic engineering' in the mixture of serum and vita-rays that had turned him into the one and only super-soldier.
"Doctor Pym has been most hospitable," T'Challa said easily, rising and offering his hand to Tony, who clasped it firmly. "I was lucky that the one person who remained in the Tower in what was plainly an emergency actually knew me, though it was your A.I. – a most remarkable creation and I do congratulate you on it – which recognised me and alerted him."
"That hangar's just about big enough to hide one of these." Fury waved a hand at tail spikes passing in front of him.
He had just finished dressing when Tony called him into the sitting room. Imagining all sorts of disasters, he was through the door and to Tony's side in half a dozen strides.
"We have authorisation from SHIELD."
Determining to keep a firm hold on his tongue, Tony held out his hand and said, "I'm Tony Stark. Welcome to my tower. What can I do for you?"
"For what it's worth, I didn't think much of Captain America when I first met him but Steve Rogers converted me."
"Hi, Pep," he said, at last.
She said, as if noticing it for the first time, "You're wet."
Danvers rolled her eyes, but thrust her gun back into the holster on her belt.
"Why not?" Steve was trying to control his frustration with Tony – he didn't want to fight with him and certainly not for it turn physical – but he knew it was there in the sharpness of the question.
"Nope. I had that with me all the way through high school, though it's been upgraded since. I refuse to go undefended." He repacked the bag quickly and surprisingly neatly and stood glaring at it for a moment before turning to Steve. "You got everything you need?"
. I'm pretty social. Pretty too. And useful. And a woman, and only female wasps sting."
"I think so. Hank doesn't agree. Jan, as usual, supports Hank. Bruce is sitting on the fence.
Tony burst out laughing, more carefree than Steve had yet to see him. "Jan, I want you to meet Steve Rogers. Steve, this is Janet Van Dyne; heiress, playgirl, biochemist and fashion designer. Or did you sell the fashion business?"
"Sir, Mrs Arbogast has just called to remind you that the Board meeting is at 14:30, and should she add Ms Potts's resignation to the agenda?"
Beyond the windshield, he could see concrete and glass sliding by, with a wing tip just skimming the cars and cabs on the street below. Then suddenly the ornithopter was out of Manhattan and over the water...
"No you couldn't."
"Not surprised. Not when the Pentagon is involved."
"Put Jan on," Tony said.
There was something else.
It didn't help.
He was so tired of those.
And there was a snort of laughter, quickly suppressed, that was so very Tony that it twisted Steve's heart.
"Not sure," Steve mumbled into Tony's neck. He raised his head to look into warm brown eyes. Surprisingly, what occurred to him at that moment was that the reason Tony had given all his suits glowing demon eyes was that no one could have been scared by his own. "I had no one," he said, "nowhere to go, no place in this century, just the expectations of Captain America hanging over me... Now I'm not Captain America and freer for it. I've got a place, a home, and friends here and in Asgard and Wakanda. And you. Most importantly, you."
"Unlikely. Hogan's value would be simply in controlling Stark. You have a value of your own— don't—" The gun was suddenly in his hand. "I know you are fast, Captain, but so am I – very fast."
But she didn't run. Instead, she elbowed her attacker viciously in the solar plexus, a precise and well-judged blow.
"Sure he can, but why haven't you asked SHIELD?" The answer was already clear to Tony before he'd finished the question. "Or is the info from SHIELD?"
"Previous one?"
The door slid open at her touch, allowing them access to a large, windowless, blindingly white room.
A few moments later, Jan's voice came softly over the comms (And bless Tony for having spares on hand even in the Malibu house, and Jarvis for reminding him that Danvers and Betty needed the.).
Breathing hard, Tony slammed the door shut behind him and stepped away from the air-conditioned comfort into evening sunlight that slanted directly from the head of the valley as it fell to the west, bouncing from bare rock and reflecting blindingly off the water in the creek.
"Tony, behave yourself!" she admonished him, as soon as she was released. However, she had kissed back with enthusiasm, so he ignored the protest.
Steve crouched in the well of the boat, the hood on his stolen robe thrown over his head, as the sailboat bounced across the lake, Okoye at the tiller. He used to feel vaguely seasick even on the ferries, but the serum had taken care of that. What he had not expected was how noisy the craft was, as the bow crashed into the waves that lifted under the rising wind, with the sails slapping and the rigging clattering. Voices called to each other ahead of them.
"Not important," Steve said. "Help me strip him. Then we need to hide these guys."
"Tony..."
"You bet." Tony took a gulp of brandy. "I killed him."
He was lying on his front, propped up on pillows so he could breathe normally – but pain ripped across his back with every breath.
A tall woman with black hair in a waterfall of curls down her back burst from the pavilion, holding a small, egg-like object cupped in her hands. Its intense, icy light illuminated features inhuman in their symmetry, but was swallowed in the darkness of her eyes.
He wasn't entirely sure why he had brought the shield. It had been safe in New York – ought to be perfectly safe in New York – but he didn't want to let it far out of his reach. And it was as safe – safer – here.
"Silence! Or I will have your tongue cut out," Hunter threatened. He was frowning, but not at Tony. "Blood. You people have never had access to T'Challa's. So this has to be—" He took a step towards North. "If you have harmed Shuri—"
"This would," Jarvis said, "be so much easier if SHIELD hadn't upgraded the security on their computer databases. I cannot even see them now. It is if they have been switched off."
But that was something Steve simply could not do. He was quiet on the ride home – no, it wasn't his home, he needed to remember that – and Tony was also silent, concentrating on the traffic.
"What about the challenge you mentioned earlier? The one where this person with the ridiculous name interfered?" Tony's questions were sharp.
"For pity's sake, do I have to make myself any damn clearer? Yes. I am sure. Yes, please fuck me. Yes— oh, Christ."
That would be disastrous, perhaps to the whole universe.
He threw himself through the panther's jaws, knocking Hunter and his guards to one side, and lunged for the altar.
Clint chuckled. "Yeah, well, you're prejudiced. And Nat's got some kinky suspicions about you and Steve."
at that moment.
"Great idea, Jarvis," Jan said.
Eventually, the SUV swung off the main highway, ferns swishing aside under its tires, and then they were travelling down a single-track road, branches sweeping the roof.
Well, if he wanted upgrading, he should ask. He had, after all, stolen the War Machine armour in the first place.
Tony snorted. But he remembered the look on Steve's face as he returned it to him and remained otherwise silent.
"My God," Bruce said. "Hank's gotten into a teleporter with a fly."
"I am not blocking your calls!" Tony snarled back.
But Pepper had told him, firmly, that she wasn't there to cover the activities of Iron Man (though she seemed willing enough to give Captain America advice about how to handle the paparazzi.)
"I met Hank," Jan admitted. "Financing his work wasn't enough to make him see me as a partner. So I went back to college."
Steve only had time to take a few sips of water – indeed, he had not finished debating with himself whether he could keep Tony silent by using his 'Captain America' glare – when a woman came striding into the room.
Steve was horrified. "You don't really believe that?"
That turned out to be two hours later.
So this must be this time's Natasha and this time's Tony.
"Who sold it to you?"
"Come looking for me when it's bad," Tony said, abruptly. "I can distract you, if nothing else."
"When I did so, I saw your friend materialising at Stark Tower, alone. But almost before he drew breath, the case he was carrying exploded, you both appeared from nowhere, and the Time Stone had simultaneously fallen into my hand. The Soul Stone, however, had shattered. I heard your conversation and saw you collect some of the pieces. That was the Event. And you caused it. Somehow."
Well, someone needed to speak to the Panther god, and not White Wolf.
Tony had stopped firing because he didn't have enough control to avoid hitting Steve – and the limited power in the gauntlet was running out. He could only watch the struggle in horror, knowing that if the Doombot managed to twist free just for an instant Steve would be dead.
