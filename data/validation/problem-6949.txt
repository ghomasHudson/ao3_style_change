“J, baby, can you wake the kids and tell them to meet us in the bedroom? And if Harley makes a fuss, tell him his papa bear made bacon with maple-syrup.” Tony grabbed Steve’s arm and led them to the bedroom. It was a slow walk for Tony. He was always exhausted these days. He leaned against Steve and started humming their favorite song.
He tried not to think about Ru because when his meandering thoughts led down to that little file in his head he told himself to never touch, he wanted to strip himself from the suit and throw himself out of the window. He was stupid to believe that there’d be a time when grief would fade into dull ache.
There are other phrases for it now, nearly three years later: the Snap. Journalistic accounts call it The Decimation. Others refer to it as the Blip.
He’s silent about it, too. Meticulous. Steve doesn’t lose control these days. His hits are measured, calibrated for me to withstand and heal from.
She avoids Tony’s grasp and lies flat on the sofa, taking a huge bite of her bean and cheese burrito. She always prefers having her own space to stretch out, and while Tony pouts and pretends to be upset, Steve has no qualms about personal space anymore.
Scared for when the memories of you will become far and between. Locked up in some distant galaxy no suit or Quinjet can get to. I’m sorry. I never said that. Always thought apologies too difficult like peeling the suit, piece by piece, and all that’s left is you. Well. Me. And that’s scarier. Nothing more awful than looking at myself in the mirror and knowing what the rest of them think is true.
“Your dad left a message for us. I was thinking we could finally watch it. It’s time, I think,” Steve explained, gesturing the helmet. It gleamed under the workshop’s lights, a sharp red and gold. “Play message.”
One kiss, two kisses. Then, three slow kisses that turned deeper and heated as Tony licks Steve’s mouth open. Their tongues slid together in leisure, not a care in the world that they’re making out on a bench in Central Park.
People are stubborn, determined, and living willfully, maybe even out of spite, as if to tell the world,
Fuck. I guess grief makes a man mauldin. Carol got sick of me sitting in the conference room with all the paperwork I have to do for SHIELD now so we went on a walk throughout Midtown. The place you like, you know, the one by St. Patrick's Cathedral, where the baker makes bagels with extra sesame? It’s gone. Didn’t survive Ultron’s attack. The family moved to New Jersey though, restarting their business in a place that doesn’t get attacked as much as New York. Maybe that’s for the better.
Still, since Steve’s return, he’s strong, healthier. His mouth no longer smells like tobacco and there’s a brightness to him that wasn’t there before. As a man upholding the law, Steve’s always been fit, and Tony prides himself in learning all things about Steve Rogers. He catalogued the width of his shoulders, the shape of his back, the slope of his thighs. Tony is intimately familiar with it. But he can’t help look at Steve, gaze at this unharmed body that doesn’t have a scar from where the bullet shot his back.
Steve kisses his belly button and gets off the bed. He grabs his clothes from the nightstand and dresses without a word.
It's a funny book. I say that without laughing. You’ll like it, I think. Though, it might be too fatalistic for you. You see, I'm a genius, but maybe I'm stupid to believe you're the perfect man. Was the perfect man. Steve, you’re filled with ideals and standards that could only be lived by you. I don’t mean it as a bad thing. I never did. Sometimes admiration sounds like jealousy. I do envy you. Even in death, you’re still what I measure everything against.
This Steve of the returned tries to make him happy by bringing him food, spending the night with Tony in his arms. He warms the bath and makes a pot of coffee every morning. He cheers the townsfolk, assists in matters at the station and in the town hall. He does favors all around town, chats with the kids. Sternly tells Tommy and Kate to stay away from the dam.
I wish we could have this Cap here. But that Cap belongs to another time, another world, another generation of people.
It’s a different fight this time. A harder battle because they’ll want to hold each other, be gentle in the right ways, be rough in the ways that feel good, because Tony’s always liked it when Steve fucked him hard and raw until he was cross-eyed and unintelligible, babbling about how wonderful and handsome Steve is and biting his bottom lip so he doesn’t spill how much he loves Steve, so much so that he’d swallow the world to keep him safe.
Tony blanches, shakes his head wildly, then grips Steve’s hand towards him. “Steve, no. Of course, not. I’m happy you’re here, I am truly.”
The photographs of the team that he placed by the desk is exactly where he left them. There’s Wanda and Vision by the Compound’s lake. There’s the team in Clint’s farm with Lila sporting a bow and arrow in her back.
“Really, Victor?” Tony deadpans, spins to face the man and proceeds to kick him on the shin. “I don’t want to fucking see your face, take a message. It’s never gonna happen.”
Except, Steve is now interested in Tony’s inventions, particularly the suit. He may have shown interest before, if Tony didn’t spend all his free time getting drunk and rigging the fortune telling machine outside his workshop.
Their friends depart a week after the wedding. Peter and Johnny were first to leave, having to catch up on their college courses and go on what they call ‘New York Patrol Dates.’ Sam and Bucky stay through the week, eating berries and messing with the chickens. Tony complained all throughout that the house has never been as messy, but it reminded Steve of their Tower days, back when they were all bunking together. He misses them, but it’s all alright. They’ll all come back.
Tony didn't have anything to say, so he wrung his hands together and picked at the holes the nails had made on his fingers. He studied the nails on the coffee table.
But now, there’s nothing here for him. Other than canvas and paint set by the window, the room is devoid of personality, anything that would have made it home. He used to like this place, decompressing here when the world got too loud.
“I can’t go on without him, Nat. I couldn’t know how to live without him. You spend your whole life building a future with someone.” He searched his eyes, lost. They’ve all lost people, but goddamn, this was Tony. He barked a wet laugh. “He is a futurist and—no, he
Steve stared at their laced fingers and squeezed back in three slow successions. “I love you.” His voice sounded faint even to his own ears, like he was underwater and hearing the world go around and around.
Even with half of the universe gone, reduced to dust motes recycling into thinning air, the cafe is filled with conversations that never seem to end.
People are consumed by grief, they don’t know how to live without it. It’s a friend you welcome home, because otherwise, you’d be alone. Empty in a mausoleum full of faded photographs that retain no information. Grief lets you digest the despair of loss.
Images flickered in his mind. As he read the reports, pulled up Extremis, his mind tried to corroborate the information with unclear images, fragmented scenes, puzzling conversations he didn't understand the context for. It kept coming and coming, and Tony tried to piece them together.
He falls back against Steve, and lets the final trickles of piss out, utterly out of control. It drips down his legs, painting Steve's cock, and it splashes on his bare feet.
It’s lucky, really, but he doesn’t allow his growing bitterness to stop her from her animated tales of working part-time in her family owned establishment.
“Wow, so if it comes from you, Pepper automatically gives a pass? I gotta use that more often,” Tony said.
Steve read articles and interviews on Tony Stark’s vision for rebranding his father’s company into Stark Resilient. He’s the future of the world, no doubt. Tony needed someone who could make sure he could accomplish everything he ever dreamed about. Steve’s taken the liberty of tracking and conducting background checks on Stark Industries’ board members and his circle of friends. Stane was gunning for Tony’s CEO position. Steve would ensure that Stane would never get his dirty, bloody hands on Tony’s seat. He wanted to meet Tony and thank him for being Steve’s rock while deployed.
Tony doesn’t want to hear it because if he does, he’ll remember, and he’ll think about it, turn it over and over like a page to an endless book. He can’t have that. Not now.
“That wasn’t your vows?” Steve jokes, laughing though it. He pulls Tony closer to him and laces their fingers together.
“You’re the one who decided you couldn’t wait.” Steve drops a kiss over Tony’s head and pulls him closer. Tony sets down the glass and rearranges himself so he’s in front of Steve, his back pressed to Steve’s chest. Most days, they find themselves in this position, standing on the veranda, watching the sunrise, or sitting by the docks, watching the sun dip into the horizon.  Steve tightens his arms, happy.
“Breakfast in bed?” Tony smiles. His head still hurts and his mouth had that foul taste after drinking so much. “I could get used to this,” he adds, because, well, he’s always been reckless.
“I will,” Steve says, watching the way Tony rolls his shoulders back, once, twice, three times. He must be sore from a day of sitting in the car. “Are you not gonna eat just because Riri and Kate aren’t here?”
He breathed in and out, steadying himself. He needed to get his shit together. It was unacceptable to break down in front of his kid. It was Christmas; they were supposed to be happy.
I'm Director Stark now. I asked Maria to bring me an espresso. She would probably shoot me the first chance she gets.
Five years gone by and his mind still stubbornly drifts to fights the rest of the world no longer remembers. Perhaps, never knew, because the events of the Bunker were never made public. However, it remains as a steady film reel in Steve’s mind. Mistakes and regrets flow in a continuous loop, and it’s like he’s spent the last half decade stagnant and unchanged.
Tony was cold and he thought that the balcony door might still be open, but he didn’t want to check. That required moving.
Steve examined Tony’s messy hole. It gleaned with Steve’s spit. “You think you can take me without it? Are you still loose from this morning, sweetheart?”
Steve leaves, and doors open and shut and open and click shut again. He returns with a tablet and a small, hand mirror. He places the latter on the pillows and makes Tony face his reflection.
“I don’t know how the hell you convinced me to live in a place where it snows.” Tony shakes his head as he wiggles out of his boots. He removes his too-large sherpa coat and hangs it on the coat rack. Slowly, he pads to the kitchen and deposits a woven basket full of fresh eggs on the counter.  “Now, make me breakfast.”
provided an overview of Tony’s life as a child prodigy, his ‘tumultuous’ teenage years in MIT, his bachelorhood, the time in Afghanistan, and until finally, Iron Man was born.
His hair is mused, likely from wearing goggles, but his goatee is still pristine. He’s softer, and Steve can’t pinpoint exactly what edges have been sanded down, but it’s there.
“Fine.” The man eyes Tony with a suspicious glare, but doesn’t disagree once Tony starts rolling his sleeves and digging his fingers into the car. “But you better not make it any worse.”
Steve looked up and down his body, appreciating Tony’s defined shoulders, his strong biceps, and the lazy, charming grin on his face. His hair was a mess. It was perfect.
“You should sleep more,” Steve laughed, shaking the bed with the force of it. “But yes, darling, I can blow you.”
Tony looks like he’s his, and evidence of it is written all over his face. From the way he smells like Steve, because they use the same shampoo and soap. From the way his clothes smell like Steve’s because they shove all their clothes into the same laundry bag, use the same lavender mint detergent. From the way Tony’s lips taste a bit like the coffee they chose together.
There’s no elevator, so they climb the rickety steps for three flights, and then they’re up in a large, single room that could double as a spacious attic. The walls slant in an angle and there’s two double beds occupying the sides of the room.
Once the doctors announced that the egg and sperm clicked, the next nine months were a whirlwind of anxiety and excitement.
Steve would kiss Tony’s belly button, put his hands all around him, kiss his face, neck, thankful and endlessly happy that they had something beautiful in a world filled with destruction and decay.
“Dad said that normal is boring. I don’t want to be boring.” Morgan deadpanned and skipped out of the room, following her siblings. Then, she rushed back, pigtails bouncing. Morgan pulled at his hand, laced their fingers together, and squeezed three times.
She snaked one hand on his back and one under his knees, lifting him with ease. “We’re going. We’re gonna get you help. Hold still, alright?”
Steve shoved the gardening supplies in a corner then entered their new home. Tony was asleep on the leather sofa, hand hanging loose on his stomach. The StarkPad was propped up his thigh. Steve's heart stuttered. Steve couldn’t believe this man chose to be with him—out of all the people Tony could have, he's with Steve.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up. He leaned back, arms crossed over his chest. “Do you mean, I’m not like you?”
“Well, baby. You did all the heavy lifting, all that was left for me to do was stand there, look good, and watch your ass and biceps flex as you carry the boxes in.” Tony pulled hard on Steve’s hair, shoving him further down to his belly.
While Thor was in another dimension, the team had Bruce Banner as a heavy-hitter in the roster. They’re still building up the Avengers, but thus far, Steve was happy.
She gives him a wryly grin, except, it’s all wrong, there’s none of the ‘I’m right and you’re wrong, but it would be hilarious to see you fail before I offer help’ attitude he’d seen during their short time as a team in the Stark Tower.
With that, Tony turns back to his workshop, slams the door shut, and stares at the armor with blurry eyes, and bites down the bile rising from his throat.
He inspects the fledgling branch in their little plot. It’s a single branch with a few textured leaves. A seed grows and next thing he knows, an entire tree soon replaces the fledgling branches. It's like a love affair, he thinks, glancing at Tony with a smile.
Steve's brain rattles and his thoughts bounce like ping pongs he could never afford to play in arcades growing up. Tap, tap, tap, to the beat of his heart. Tony, Tony, Tony, synonymous to a red and yellow suit that falls out of the sky like a meteor.
Sam and Bucky wanted to murder them both for fucking in the communal showers. But, well, Tony funded the Compound, so every time they threatened them both, Tony would just laugh cheekily and make out with Steve in front of them.
“I can’t lose you. Please.” His vision was blurry and his eyes stung, but he refused to let go of Tony’s hand to wipe at his tears. “I can’t make it without you, Tony. I’m not half as good without you. I can’t do this without you.”
Steve nods and lets himself be pulled into the conference room that doubles as her office. There’s empty bottles of vodka on the floor and half-eaten granola bars on the edges of the table from earlier today.
But I know better. Steve is always alert. He’d catch my arms if I tried to push him off the mattress. He doesn’t even let me crawl on top of him. There’s no riding his cock. It’s always me with my back pressed against the mattress, his blue eyes always on me.
“Jesus, Tony.” Steve swayed closer. He didn’t even feel this apprehensive when getting the serum. At this moment, he stood at the edge of a precipice, shocked with hope and yearning.
Danvers catches his eye for a beat, looking at him up and down, disappointment evident in the twist of her mouth.
It’s been happening more and more lately. He couldn’t stop looking at Tony. Sometimes he caught himself tracing the slope of his nose, the lines on his eyes, the curve of his smile. For the most part, Steve has stopped trying to turn away. But today, under the daylight in a hot New York summer with millions of people around them—Steve didn’t think he could keep his face neutral.
It was supposed to protect and enhance his mind and yet, Steve Rogers struggled to reconcile with the fact that his husband was dead. It was supposed to perfect his mentality but it failed. Steve was weak for Tony, driving himself to recollection of their shared life together.
Bruce leads them down a row of carrots and broccoli, then with a smile, he explains, "I promised Tony and the girls I'd make curry tonight."
Steve didn’t realize that Pepper began leading them to the gardens. Morgan was still in Rhodes’s arms, awake and looking back at Steve.
“That would please me, yes.” Steve nods, taking off his gloves in a slow motion, almost as if he’s giving Tony a performance himself. Isn’t that just the case? Tony’s supposed to be the entertainment and yet, he’s the audience, holding onto Steve's every word.
“Can you call the kids?” Tony reached for him, putting their foreheads together. “I love you. I love you everyday.”
Steve turned to him. “Is this how you want to do this, Tony? You want us to yell some more? Is that all we’re good for now? We used to be better. A team.”
A sigh escapes Tony, and Steve bites his lip when Tony starts rocking against him, arching his back, demanding more.
Steve missed Tony so much he didn’t know what to do. He couldn’t deal with the grief of returning to their bedroom, alone, in a house where everything screamed Tony. He wanted to burn this fucking place down. Never set foot on it again.
— we’re doing alright. But it’s not the same without you. We make do, though. One gets used to different dynamics in the field.
Steve hummed, kissing the top of his head. “Yes. It’s a nice song. It’s our song. That doesn’t change anything. You’re right, Harley.”
Steve signals and pulls over. It’s all rolling hills here. He can see them only due to the serum. It smells fresh too, free of the smog of too many city cars.
Steve has told himself that it’s acceptable to watch and protect Tony from a distance. Maybe he’d serve as a bodyguard or head of security. His military background makes him qualified. But… Steve’s also just a man and he’s not immune to daydreams.
“Don’t I always.” Steve snorted. He led Tony back to his dick. “Come here, I’ll fuck your face. You don’t have to work so hard, honey. You already do that.”
“I’m trying too,” he argues, leaning forward. There’s a rising heat in his face, like he’s embarrassed that he’s still a child running and running and running.
Steve pauses, watching her. She’s a tiny thing compared to him, ramming her huge strap-on into Tony’s ass. Her manicured fingers are tight on Tony’s hips, thrusting in and out, in a slow, languid pace. Like they have all the time in the world.
“I won’t bend.” Steve walks over and he’s just on the other side of the sink. That’s them, now, isn’t it? On the side of each other. An immovable rudder preventing the construction of any bridge. Tony will even take a rickety one at this point.
He catches himself and grips the wheel too hard. He presses the gas pedal, releases, presses it again, and he rushes too quickly. Tony’s sharp exhale pulls him off his trance. He slows down. Inch by inch the meter’s number falls lower and lower.
Grieve. Cry. Let it out. It’s alright. Remember the good times, the happy moments with gratefulness rather than regret.
Steve clasped Tony’s elbow, curious, a question on his face. But he didn't ask. Instead, he pulled Tony back until they stood as close as possible. Steve’s hand slipped down and he intertwined their fingers together, lightly scratching the gauge on Tony’s hand.
“No, no, it’s just.” He shuts his eyes for a moment and wills his face to stop heating. “It’s just an adjustment, that’s all. I saw you die, Steve. Fisk threw you. There was nothing to recover. I can’t…” Eyes open, Tony tracks the understanding dawning into Steve’s face. It’s still uncanny to see him without blood on his face. “I can’t wrap my mind around how you’re here. I’m a man of science. Mechanics. This is magic. Supernatural. I don’t know, I can’t help but think it’s a dream.”
He sips his coffee. It’s strong, and black. No cream or sugar, and the roast is made in the house. Tony would love it here.
Steve walked over to the wall on the east side of the room. It was a mix of Steve’s paintings, portraits of the kids, photos of him and Tony. In the middle was their marriage certificate and a copy of the frontpage newspaper from the 2012 Chitauri battle.
Steve has spit dripping down his jaw, but he doesn’t care. He relaxes his throat, taking Tony in, letting Tony fuck his face. Use him like he deserves. If Steve can’t be anything else other than a cock to fill Tony or a warm hole for his cock, a faceless stranger to fuck, then that’s fine. It’s alright, he repeats, ignoring the sting in his eyes. It’s just because Tony’s pulling his hair and he can feel Tony take root inside him, growing, festering, blooming, until there’s nothing left but Tony.
He wouldn’t be as well adjusted to all the violence that comes with being an Avenger without Tony by his side.
Steve interrupted. He was biting his lips and kept shaking his head and refusing to meet Tony’s eyes. “Not right now.”
He couldn’t do this anymore. He couldn’t, he’d already fallen apart. There was nothing left to give.
The gardens on their rooftop would continue to grow, then wither in the winter. He’d have to wake up tomorrow, get dressed and pretend to have his shit together.
“As you wish, sir.” The rooftop shields lift and he hears the busy streets of New York. A cabbie honks and there’s the sound of children giggling below. The sounds washed over him and somehow, in a city filled with millions of people, he felt vulnerable and alone.
“Tony. He’ll help. He’ll understand.” Steve wasn’t sure if he was forcing himself or Natasha to believe that.
But air leaves his lungs and it’s hard to breathe with Steve lingering behind him, a shadow that follows his every move.
Steve grins because Tony calling him his husband never fails to make him feel safe, like all the painful, rocky roads of life led to this. “Hmm, I think you’ll look better in the bee suit.”
“Yes, dear. They’re still my little babies and you’ll spoil us rotten by making almond flour pancakes.”
“Didn’t know Tigra would affect you so much.” Tony doesn’t know how long he sits on the floor, staring, wondering how many more.
It’s eerie, the way Steve tracks each of his movements, nods in satisfaction as Tony swallows each bite. Steve barely spared a glance at him in public unless it was during an arrest, and in the privacy of their homes, Steve had always poured over reports, files, and incessant paperwork. He’d read out legal documents from the capital and go over legislative proposals from the townsfolk. Brainstormed possible ways to improve the community.
Steve glances at Tony in question. The man wears an amused expression and raises his hand as if to say
“Sure thing, sweet thing.” Tony winked. He laughed when Natasha raised an eyebrow. She glanced at Steve, unimpressed, and left without another word.
Tony’s shaking his head now, he’s got a hand over a woman’s shoulders. He snaps her tank top’s strap while she starts kissing his neck.
Along with the smell of the freshwater, there’s the sound of nature: the birds chitter with his family’s laughter.
“Sir, Ms. Potts has left several messages. Each voice memo has gotten increasingly threatening. I was not able to inform you due to privacy protocols in the shower,” JARVIS announced.
At a distance, the sun mindlessly sets across the Spanish coast. Its stoic brightness serves as a reminder of how light captures the distance between them, and despite not knowing where Tony is now, they share the same sky.
Steve places the aloe leaves on a wicker basket along with the vegetables picked. “Are you? Are you living with that?”
He dropped to his knees, swallowing. “We’ll be alright, baby.” He coughed, attempting to get rid of the lump on his throat. “I’ll miss your battle cry, Shellhead.”
“You’ll love it. Rice, beans, grilled chicken.” Tony made a kissing sound and padded to check on Clint and Natasha. “You gotta get my favorite though, chile verde. But come to the Tower for that. I have a recipe from an ex-girlfriend’s grandmother.”
“It made sense then. Now, too. A man still running.” Nomad, a man without a permanent home, he expects her to say. But instead, Natasha adds, “wanderer, traveller, because you have to, need movement to survive. In the older days, they categorized tribes as sedentary or nomadic. The latter moved to follow the livestock. It's survival. I get it, Steve. You don’t have to explain to me.”
Steve turns him and hooks a finger under his jaw. He wipes Tony’s tears away. “Don’t you want me like this? He always noticed, you know, the way you looked at him, how your heart accelerated when he got near. The crinkle of your eyes, he catalogued it, stored it in his head, turned it over and over in a loop when sleep wouldn’t come. He loved you. And I? I get to enjoy you.”
Steve’s cradling him too, holding him like he’s something special. That’s the thing with Steve. He always treated Tony like he’s worth a damn. Saw Tony as a good, honorable man. Saw, because maybe it’s not like that anymore. But Tony knows people go back to what’s familiar. He’s a futurist, and here he is, regressing to the habit of how to be in love with Steve Rogers. How to coax a long-drawn out moan from him. How to kiss him proper until he gets rowdy, wild with demands.
I throw the straight blade and miss his head. There’s a small nick on his temple. I used to be stronger. I can’t overpower him. I’ve tried.
He fucks hard and deep, this new determination shocking him. He'll have it just this once, and it's alright. He covers Tony's hand, and Tony intertwines them, bringing them to his lips. It's a sweet gesture, practically absurd given the circumstances, but Steve stopped caring long ago. With his other hand, he brings Tony's right leg up, thrusting in faster, gasping at the sound of their skin slapping against each other. His balls are heavy and his arms are growing tired, but he's resolute. Steve wraps Tony's leg by his waist and leans forward, aligning their torsos so they’re chest to chest.
He felt his lips tug into a smile. “I’ll have to get one with Iron Man. I think there’s a matching set at the bodega down my street.”
“Haven’t you seen enough of the world? Captain America is going on another road trip. I recall you taking your motorcycle and driving off after the Chitauri.”
He’s the face of America even when he couldn’t answer a journalist’s question without stumbling through his words and introducing each sentence with “Erm,” or “Um.” He had a script from a SHIELD PR employee memorized, but he struggled to spit the words out.
He catalogued the difference in the set of Steve’s shoulders and the way he held himself together with an air of righteousness.
“Yes, sir.” Tony’s gaze went soft, like sex was something tender even if it was anything but soft when Steve was pounding into him.
Tony twisted up, tilting forward to kiss Steve. It hurt to know how much energy the simple task required. This was Tony Stark, Iron Man, yet here he was, struggling to live because his body wouldn’t cooperate. It couldn’t sustain him.
“We’re gonna put a rose bush there.” Tony pointed at the empty lot. “An orchard. I want a greenhouse.” He made both of his gauntlet hands stretch wide, opened his faceplate and turned to Steve. “Can you imagine it, Cap?”
He drinks, sips water, finally realizing how long it’s been since he’s had fresh water. Steve pulls away the glass and sets it back down.
“Still a kid, kid,” Tony says then claps his head. “Ok, ok enough chatter, my dear husband over here made all of this for you lot, so let’s eat!”
No, how could Tony forget the nights Steve slammed him down onto the mat, then, their mattress, crafting bruises along Tony’s wrists and thighs.
“You’re gorgeous, sweetheart,” Steve said. He kept fucking hard and deep until he spilled inside Tony.
Steve was always shaking his head. There was a time when he used to smile at Tony. It seemed like a dream now.
Well. There wasn’t a body, but she was mourned by the world. Superhero, another one. A founding Avenger. Gone.
Sam and Bucky stand beside him. Iz, Augusto, and Angel sit on the front row, all waving and giving him a thumbs up. Steve laughs, and it’s just then, he realizes he’s crying. It’s true, he’s a cry baby, but he’s smiling as he turns to face Tony.
Steve kisses his mouth and they make out for a little bit. Tony’s mouth takes like vodka and cigarettes, but Steve doesn’t mind. Not when he finally has Tony. His tongue is soft and he nibbles onto Steve’s bottom lip. When Steve rocks their erections, Tony’s groans are stifled.
Rumiko’s hair is in two tight braids, bangs pushed to the side. She’s wearing a golden top that doesn’t cover much. The strap-on is thick and bright red, like Iron Man’s colors.
Tony runs forward, but it’s too late, Tommy ties the Skrulls by the rope but with short lived success, they break out quickly, and the one that wears Jessica Drew’s face kicks Tommy, hard. The kid falls and screams.
He’s been a widower for almost two years now. He hated that word: w-i-d-o-w-e-r. It was ugly and it didn’t roll off the tongue with ease. It was like swallowing shards of glass.
He comes out with a towel on his waist and circles the bed until reaches me. His body is drawn tight, exhaustion evident in the clench of his jaw and on the pull of his shoulders. My job is to make him feel better, so I tug the towel and get on my knees.
“You think Barnes, Bucky—whatever it is you call him, is still worth saving?” Tony chewed on his lips before taking another large sip from the decanter. “I really want to fucking hit something. But I’m told that’s not healthy.”
so much love in between them and it erupted out of Steve. He didn’t know what to do with all these jagged parts of himself. Tony was the one who softed up the mean parts of him, the worst parts. His kids helped. They did. They do. But it wasn’t enough, and he’s once again consumed by the guilt that
“Miss Barnes, please, sit down.” Tony urges her but she pulls away and walks further into the ruins. So far, Tony runs after her to catch up at the edges of the Silver Mines.
“I bet Sam and Bucky are outside waiting to throw a fit.” Tony grabbed some fresh towels from the shelves and passed one to Steve.
Carol snapped the pipe grip on the head of the nail and pulled until the nails released. She repeated the process on the rest of his fingers and on his wrists. Blood dripped in increments. It was only when Carol reached his forearm that Tony realized she was crying.
“Hush, baby. Just relax. We’ll take care of you. We’ll take care of everything.” Rumiko dips down, kissing the mole in the middle of Tony’s back.
Once he’s finished, he sets it in the case and paces across his room. It’s a double bed. He spent nights there, tossing and turning, rationalizing all the reasons he shouldn’t tell —
Steve could understand Pepper’s investment. She needed to ensure the future of SI. Steve couldn’t screw the business. Well, he had nothing to do with it anyway.
“Yeah, I’ll tell you everyday. Starting now.” Steve sat on the chair, pushing the other on with his foot so Tony could sit. “You’re a good man, Tony.”
Tony stays in his chair. He doesn’t even spin or lean over. His arms are crossed all too casually, and Steve knows this. Some days, on his better days, he can read this man. Before, he had the privilege to see his armor peeled back. Today, it’s just Tony Stark, looking at him detached and unaffected.
As if reading his mind, Sam replies, “he can take care of himself. Rhodes and Carol are there too when the munchkins get too much. And I’m not talking about Morgan, I’m talking about Thor and Peter. Now come on, you’re gonna show us your favorite spots.”
Steve from before who kisses him filthy, with confidence, then rolls over to smoke and pour over his paperwork, shaking his head as Tony drinks from the flask.
Steve glanced at him. There was a question he didn’t utter, like he already knew the answer. He removed Tony’s pants and boxers in one swift movement, then patted his thighs, urging Tony to stepped out of them. Then, he was kneeling on the floor and pulling Tony’s socks off.
The concrete tiles on the other side of the station were dirty and chipped, and it was a different chaos Tony never expected. Little by little, more pedestrians came underground, filling the platform with chatter from different languages. There was a high pitched laugh close by.
There would be new faces introduced to the family as their children fall in love and bring their partners home, reminding Steve that he lost the love of his life. There would be more holidays and family outings without Tony.
It seemed to satisfy them all. Steve stared at his plate—a slice of chicken, rice, and beans. It wasn’t a classic Christmas meal, but it was Tony’s favorite. He cut the chicken methodologically, shoved it in his mouth, chewed, and swallowed. His stomach felt cold, but he forced the food down. He couldn’t taste it.
It’s awful to stay in that line of thought. Regrets turn to misanthropy. He had to believe in the will of the people because he had nothing else.
Bill Foster’s body flashed over his eyes. He waved it away, tired of looking at Bill’s dead body, betrayal evident on his face.
Steve held his breath. Everyday was like standing at the end of a cliff and waiting to fall. “He gave me a list of ideas for the next few Christmases, honey. He picked that one out last year—before—” Steve choked, then shook his head, annoyed his voice was failing him. The team was here to see Steve lose it. He didn’t want to look up and see the pity in their faces. Fuck. He focused on Harley, ignoring the twist in his gut.
They linger for a beat, and Steve is lost once again. Well, found, really, home, with no care for anything other than the man in front of him.
Tony shoves the menu to the side, and it’s just them now, nothing else to distract them from cataloging each other. No road to focus on, no view to divert their attention to.
In one reality, I didn't survive the initial Extremis injection. It might have been for the best. I don't know what being human is anymore, Steve. Men make monsters in the image of their adversaries. Humans tell stories about God. I look at the mirror and all I see is me. More wrinkles in the corners of my eyes. Fuck up, fuck up again. Maybe I'm the only one that notices it. No, that’s not true. The whole world knows. Are people always so critical of their reflection? When you brushed your teeth in the mornings and stared at yourself in the dirty mirror of your shitty apartment, did you ever resent the world for demanding too much out of you?
He’d never wanted to be anything other than a man. Someone he could stand to look at in the mirror without the armor to protect him from all the parts he hated and let fester like some cancerous cell. He should remove it, operate on himself. Flay his skin back from his fingernails all the way up his forearms and past his shoulders. Break his ribs so he could reach in, remove all the awful, rotting parts of himself and replace it with the fitting screws, the right parts, but that required a master engineer with a vision.
He padded to the bathroom, brushed his teeth, and hopped from one foot to another. He looked at himself in the mirror, tilted his head, and examined himself.
“Go on, then,” Tony stays rooted on the spot. There’s only the kitchen island separating them. They have always been different. Tony has enough insight to know that Steve’s a better man. But good men don’t always do the right thing, not when they can’t see past their own myopic sights.
Ru lived in the space of his breastbone, a tiny thing that spun around his ribs, making his heart stutter anytime he saw someone with a red dress. It was always hurting. Always there, reminding  him what it’s like to grieve.
Tony can’t comprehend him. He hears the yelling of the guards. The pressure of Steve’s hand on his weak biceps. But he can’t fully register what’s happening. It’s like he’s falling out of the helicarrier without the armor.
“I’m remembering. I get flashes. Memories, I think. It loops and loops. I keep seeing death. Steve.” He choked on the final word.
With anticipation, he curls his toes, hitches his legs up higher, one foot planting firmly on the bed, while the other hits Steve's back. "More, Steve, please, come on.”
“Well, that must mean people will listen because it’s on the paper,” Tony deadpans, wishing like hell that Rogers was still around to get on his high horse to pacify the rumblings of the townsfolk.
It feels like his body is on fire. He feels punch drunk, belly full of heavy whiskey, and suddenly, he’s letting go of the lead ropes, jumping down, and walking towards Steve in a trance.
Steve knows a little bit about that. He traces the curve of Tony’s face, the lines on his forehead, and wonders if he’s lost him, too.
Motion sickness was due to the body’s confusion between perceived movement and actual, physical movement. The body thinks it ingested a toxic substance and tries to expel it by inducing vomiting.
They watch Kit dog-paddle towards the dock. Her mane is drenched and Steve already expects the   clean up and drying to be an adventure. She hops towards the dock and barks at them, as if to say,
Steve returns to his bare room. He used to find comfort in its plain white walls and minimal furniture.
, Steve hadn’t said. Instead, he’d listened, cataloguing Tony’s eyes, soft and thrilled, to the wide smile on his face. Steve had known then that Tony had fallen in love again.
You, that version of you, asked me about the Civil War. You said it must have been difficult to do what I think is right. It was difficult for you, too, I realize that now. But I wouldn’t change a damn thing. It had to be done.
When SHIELD gave him clearance to move to Brooklyn, under the watchful eye of their surveillance tech, he rode the nearly packed F train from Brooklyn to Manhattan. He could have gotten off at any stop and walked the High Line or stop to Coney Island. But he didn’t. He rode the subway for half a day, studying all the people around him.
I can't remember third grade. Cars. How I upgraded your suit. Or, that Christmas. Yeah, you know, that one. I still remember Ru. The slope of her nose. The shape of your lips. I think we used to laugh together. I'm losing it, Steve.
Steve doesn’t reply, but he meets Tony’s eyes and it’s another storm raging. Tony almost thinks Steve will hit him. He has.
Tony mouths at Steve’s chest, rubbing his naked body on Steve’s groin. This is good, this should be easy. They’ve done this a thousand times, like a well-choreographed dance. They know each other’s bodies.
“Fuck my face?” It’s a question, but he already knows the answer to it. Steve never says no to holding Tony’s head like he has the reins to the world.
“Steve! You can’t bench me.” Tony threw a hand up, annoyed. “Stop being so controlling! You’re such a pain in the ass, I swear to fuck. I told you, I’m fine. I’ll be good in a couple of days.”
He didn’t want them to worry. Someone had to keep it together. They just lost their father. They were still children who barely reached any of the important milestones in their lives, and yet, their father was dead.
“Come on, Tony will still love you even if you’re dressed in jeans and nothing but your own sweat.” Bucky punches his arms then steadies Steve. He didn’t even know he was leaning against the dashboard.
Morgan grabbed his hand, putting her tiny one over his large palms. She led him to the sofa and sat beside him.
At home, Tony’s lounging at the veranda with a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice, picked by Morgan and Steve this morning. It’s still a bit bitter, too tangy for Steve’s taste, but just right for Tony. It’s still too early in the season, but soon, the markets will fill with plums and oranges, an endless supply for their little home.
Steve kicked off his work boots, shucked his jeans down to his thighs, and let Tony pry it off him. His socks came off next. With Tony’s guiding hand, Steve moved forward and planted himself down on the lush patch of grass. The grass tickled his arms as he wiggled his ass in anticipation.
Steve wonders if he’s thinking about Spider-Man, and how the kid might befriend the younger heroes, too.
Tony leaned away, an inch or two, and kissed Steve’s nose. “I’m alive, Steve. I’m healthy. I’m gonna grow old with you.”
Harley made a sound of protest, then, he searched Steve’s eyes—for what, Steve didn’t know. Approval, deference, maybe. Then, like he’s still seven, pressed himself to Steve’s chest, dropping his head.
His saliva hits the edges of Steve's cowl, dips down the sharp slope of his nose, then onto Steve's cupid bow. Damn, he didn't get it on the "A.”
It probably isn’t, but Tony doesn’t say that. He nods, turns his head and kisses Steve’s wrist, feels the beat of his heart. Tony wants to say yes, of course, it’s fine. He belongs to Steve, will probably always will. Instead, he smiles because sex is familiar. Even with the heaviness of the moment, Steve’s still hard. Still wants him, even after everything.
Every morning, when he woke up in bed alone. When he stepped into the shower, Tony’s hair products lined the walls and stared at him. He didn’t have the courage to throw them away. He couldn’t. Not yet, maybe not ever. Who cared if that was unhealthy? Tony used to scrub his hair with it every morning, sometimes with Steve lathering soap on his back. Then, he’d turn, soap suds on his eyebrows and kiss Steve until he was breathless.
All these people surround him have never seen the grotesque bodies that litter a battlefield. But Samuel and the waitress in Hafa and the children Siwa and the farmers harvesting rice in their tiny villages at the coast, all find life.
“Served in Vietnam,” the man adds. “You in town long?” The man turns back to Steve and offers a sheepish smile, gone is the quick distrust from earlier. It’s replaced with pleasantness instead. “I got a friend who’s washer and dryer isn’t working… and getting it fixed by Tony Stark would mean an awful lot. A whole lot to us townsfolk, you know.”
He’s tired. The more he resists, the more it hurts, so he forces his body to accommodate Steve. He turns to his stomach, grits his teeth, and wishes for it to be over.
“Fucking hell, you’re so good at that—you’re so hot, that feels amazing.” Tony turns to him, mouthing at his jaw. Tony’s peppering soft kisses, nipping at Steve’s throat. “Kiss me, please. I want to taste you. Kiss me? Kiss me.”
Now, years after that very moment in the bright lights of the Compound’s bathroom, he’s only trimmed it because it serves as an easy disguise. No one looks at Steve a beat too long, and if they do, it has nothing to do with his past as Captain America.
Some people on the streets eye them, but don’t say anything, too busy with their own lives. Steve cradles Tony’s head, making sure to press Tony’s face into his chest to ensure no one recognizes him. Steve doesn’t want to read about Tony’s wild partying in the gossip rags.
“Steve.” Tony leaned forward as Steve offered him another piece of donut. This time, Tony's favorite, the butter crumb donut. Tony twisted his mouth, “I’m fine. Save some for the kids.”
“We’re already married, and we’ve already exchanged rings. But I wanted to do this for you. For us. Have another picture perfect moment for that never ending collage you make of us. There’s pictures of us all around the house. Taped to the fence, sections of the garden, in the shower. Everywhere I turn, there’s you. And I thought, hell, might as well have a wedding photo top it all off.” Tony grins at him, and there’s tears in his eyes. “Well, Bruce is here in ceremony to tell me when to do my vows because I’ll talk forever if I’m not prompted.”
“No,” he says, ruefully, placing the utensils down. Sometimes he still felt like that skinny kid, though.
“Fine. I can do that.” He glances at Steve in question. “You alright to stay for another day or two?”
Eventually, Steve gets up, mumbling something about getting a washcloth and cleaning up. Tony watches Steve heave himself up and enter the bathroom. Feeling heavy, he rises and follows. Inside, Steve offers him a small smile and makes a move to rub at the dried come and spit on Tony’s torso.
Finally, after a lecture about country music, she points at the double doors and forces him to grapple with his own thoughts.
The last time he was in a station, he was a kid, not even a man. Trains reminded him too much of blood on tracks and mutilated bodies. Even with his tenure as Iron Man, he never got used to the way life left someone's eyes.
“You did all this?” Steve chokes on his reply. He tilts his head to their guests and catches them all smiling. Beside Tony, Rhodes nods in approval.
Waiting for Tony to return from picking up the kids. Waiting hours for Tony to decide what he wanted for dinner then changing his mind at the last second.
It should have been harder to fall in love with Tony Stark. They’re two men with fucked up pasts, veterans of violence and war, tainted by the cynicism of corrupt governments.
There’s a question on the tip of Steve’s tongue, but he stops himself from speaking out loud. It’s something new he’s learned. To not always talk. To listen more and more. To give Tony the time and space to say what he means. It’s all about waiting, now.
“Don’t you have cleaning bots?” Steve asks, grabbing the stacking the plates and bringing them to the kitchen.
Steve smiles at the call back and with a heavy heart, he’s struck with how much he’s missed her, and how much he has missed.
“But you’re the longest that’s lasted.” Steve squats, pulls my head and slaps me just once, like it’s meant to be a pat on the face.
Tony could do it too, heal his broken body, upgrade his brain. Be better, faster, stronger. Playing god, that’s what Steve always feared.
Life was a thread in which people were cut. Steve’s life was patterned over Tony’s own, even if they lived different worlds, had different lives, had lived different centuries.
Then, there’s Tony spinning on a barstool doing lines. He’s wearing a grin, but Steve knows better. Someone’s making him smile. Why else would Tony be here if he wasn’t under some sort of pressure? No, it’s better to eliminate the drug use, clean up his act. Someone needs to take care of Tony.
Tony breathes in and out, then looks through the crowd. He winks, likely at Morgan, Steve doesn’t know. He can’t take his eyes off Tony. He turns back to Steve, face erupting into a laugh.
They stepped into the station. It was dark. The lights flickered. There were only a few people milling about in the corners. A few sat on the benches, looking bored or reading a newspaper.
Steve remembers the time where he’d fantasize about Tony under him. When he’d mentally replace Stone on the VHS tape with himself.
“Are you ready to do the presents?” Rhodes stood from his post and started to collect the rest of the dishes. “Carol really wants to give Morgan her present. You ready for that, Maguna?”
He offers help when it’s needed and stays within his own little corner otherwise, hunching his back to make himself smaller, appear less threatening.
When he wasn’t on a mission, Steve’s days were split between his desk and departmental meetings. Sometimes he suspected Fury only hired him for public relations purposes. Captain America belonged to SHIELD; Captain America was keeping the country safe.
He knew in the morning there would be work to be done, difficult discussions to be had, but for now, he sunk deeper into the comfort of Steve hovering above him, kissing the tears from his eyes.
“Looks like she’s about seven months,” she supplies, hand dropping down to cradle her belly. “I’m having one, too.”
“Alright, Riri, Kate,” Tony taps both their shoulders and pulls them into a one sided hug. When Tony pulls away, they both pull him back to squeeze him harder. “Both of you are in charge.”
Steve gives him a moment to recovery before fucking him slow, each thrust a slick slide as if he’s afraid to hurt Tony, as if he’s fragile.
“New life.” The waitress returns to refill his mug. She nods towards the mother and child standing beside the pink balcony railings overlooking the sea. “You alright, sir?”
He doesn’t know what Steve wants. Maybe they could be better, maybe they could go back, maybe Tony could be honest. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Steve lives in the spaces of possibilities, Tony rings around the circumference of compromise. They could be more, Steve might think.
You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You.
Tony is shaking. The arches of his feet ache from standing for the last few days. When sleep comes, it’s short and restless. The muscles under his armpits are pulled tighter and tighter the longer he stays suspended.
Steve makes a satisfied sound then continues his assault on Tony’s hole. He licks around and around, wiggling a finger in and out. The sensation of Steve's mouth and fingers makes Tony breathless, stupid with desire, with a dream to be fucked good and pretty. Steve dives in, like with everything he does. He spreads Tony's cheeks further apart and dives in. Tony loosens with the fingers pumping inside him and the flat tongue jabbing at his hole. "Fuck." Steve pulls off, licks Tony's balls and up his shaft. "I miss you."
Sometimes, he wondered whether it was better if he just disappeared, became a faceless, average man.
Carol flew them towards the bathroom. Tony broke away from her grip and threw himself against the floor.
He’s hit with a pang of jealousy, but perhaps that’s an incorrect assessment. It’s a sour, bitter fruit learning for something that he can’t have, so he’s resigned as a voyeur to this domestic family the rest of them have.
Steve spends sometime just watching the flow of the flowers against the wind. The creek is a murky green-brown color with the sun revealing the patches of algae and rocks in the swallow waters. For once, he itches to sketch out the scene. There's just shades of green. Steve wonders if it could be as easy as this: staying still against the wind with just colors and shapes surrounding him.
and said that Americans “are forever searching for love in forms it never takes, in places it can never be. It must have something to do with the vanished frontier.”
“Alright.” Steve closed the box and rubbed his sticky fingers on a napkin. He shifted closer to kiss Tony’s temple.
Steve breathes shakily, then shakes his head, utterly determined to make this right, to be deserving of this. He wipes his damp hands on his jeans and follows Bucky out.
“Going across the Great Americana and all that jazz. You know, eat, pray, love, finding ourselves and whatever else people call it these days,” Tony offers offhandedly, already focusing on identifying the program with the engine.
He’s a scum who can’t help but pretend this is Steve. If he ignores the welts on his back and the broken ribs and the split lip and the fracture on his skull, he can imagine that they’re a younger version of themselves living in ease at Fifth Avenue.
“If I gotta eat, you gotta eat, too,” Tony says, and when Steve stays silent, Tony orders half the first page for him.
He pounded hard on the tiles, hoping that the kids were asleep. They wouldn’t hear them, not with JARVIS privacy protocols and the soundproofing Tony designed years ago. He wanted to scream as loud as possible and claw his arms, his chest. He wished he was gone with Tony. Fuck, and then, guilt washed over him because
There’s no explanation, and when questioned, they simply explained waking up by the dam with no memory of how they got there.
Tony goes to the empty saloon, ruined by the battle, and snatches a bottle. He drinks on the porch, watching the rest of the town cry and shout.
Just two lanes, one incoming, going south, and the other, where he and Morgan are following,  heads north.
At one time, Steve had thought that the unabashed quality of his opinions were brusque, but Steve has learned since then. Sometimes, Tony allows himself to shed the layers of persona he's had to wear as another version of armor, and when the mask is pulled away, the sight of truth is lovely.
Steve smiles at the memory of Morgan handing him the polaroids of both him and Tony sitting by the fireplace, lounging at the veranda, sitting by the lake: Tony’s back across Steve’s chest, Steve’s hands around Tony.
Tony sits up, bringing It to his lap. It’s still Steve’s face. Tony caresses Its face. Follows the curve  of Its — Steve’s — eyes with his index finger. “You came here to conquer us. Don’t lie.”
“Thank you. That was… You’re perfect.” Tony’s smiling, fucked out. Then, softly, he adds, “You really are. Truly.”
“Hold me, Steve, just like this. Your arms around me. I want it to be just like this.” If it wasn’t for Steve’s enhanced hearing and his acculturation to Tony’s mumbling, then it would have been difficult to make out the words.
With a heart heavy and full of hope, he walks forward, knowing that all of this, this life and its future exists because of her sacrifice. Thank you, Steve raises his head to the sky and thanks her in silence, wherever she is now, he hopes like hell she’s watching in bliss.
“If this is about moving on and healing again, please, pops, save it,” Harley interrupted. “I miss him. I like talking to the suits. It helps me work, alright? We toss ideas and it’s like dad is here. Even though, yeah, I know he’s not. But it helps...It helps.”
Steve didn’t know him well and it’s unfortunate that the realization only came now, in a moment of crisis.
Of course, Steve would always vote for Tony’s tech, but he also appreciates the design of Shuri’s arm. Late in the evenings, sometimes he’d find Tony in bed, fresh him his shower, fiddling on his arm in their shared bed. Tony had glanced up at him with a smile as he closed the plates and set down his tools. He beckoned Steve over with his mechanical arm. Red and gold was a color Steve will never tire of. That evening, he learned exactly why Tony’s design surpasses Shuri’s.
“I do,” Steve nodded, looking at Bucky in the simulation room. He was in a HYDRA facility, arms tied to a chair, gritting his teeth.
He watered the plants on the kitchen counters and cut off the dying leaves. He didn’t want to snip the greenery, but it had to be done. Cutting off the dry leaves would allow the remaining foliage to grow. Steve took the kitchen scissors and cut half of a drying leaf then waters it.
He knows Steve is here by the smell of tar and sweat. He recognizes the tang of iron as blood. Again and again, Tony wonders who Steve killed this time. If it’s one of their friends.
Steve and Natasha end up sitting on a bench watching the trio run another few laps. Tony strips off his track jacket when they start mobility drills and they keep at it for another hour. The sun rises higher and higher. He itches for a cup of coffee. He’d go make them all breakfast if he didn’t think he’d be over stepping.
“You’re encouraging me to hack into SHIELD?” Tony smiled. It disappeared once he saw the first page on the manila folder.
Tony stands, and offers a hand, and Steve is shocked that he waits a beat too long to take it, and when he reaches forward, Tony’s already dropped his hand. His mouth twists before it’s soothed out into something neutral. He nods at Steve.
Surprisingly, Harley was the quiet kid. He never cried in the middle of night. But now, as a four year old, he was nothing but a tiny little thing with a list of demands.
Steve isn’t prepared for this. When he asked Tony if he wanted to join him on this trip, he may have already known that the invitation would likely be declined. Still he asked and had hoped to be proven wrong. Even if this is what he wanted when he asked last night, he hadn’t let himself imagine Tony on the road with him.
That night, Tony engulfs him in a deep, tight embrace. He slots himself behind Steve and snakes his arm around Steve’s belly and whispers how it’s alright, he understands why Steve cried, he doesn’t have to explain, and when Steve cries furthermore, Tony hushes him with a kiss on the nape of his neck.
“Our kid,” Tony corrects with a slight pinch. “Does Pops work? Sounds so old school. We thought you’d like it.”
“Don’t blame me!” She twisted around the suit and lifted Steve’s sketchbook. “I was drawing Harley and Peter.”
It’s the first Christmas. It was bound to be hard. Steve could survive this. There were more holidays to come, he’d have to get used to sitting under the tree and distributing presents alone.
Tony suddenly turns, rustling the sheets and making the mattress squeak. His eyes snap to Steve. “Goodnight, Steve.”
Now, Peter’s eyes were stormy. His fists were balled like he’s holding the remains of tattered patience. “Don’t talk to him like that.”
The hazy colors of late February are blue and streaks of grey. Shortly, the stars will come out, marking the end of his time here. He still likes it here, but it’s just a pit stop, he thinks, if it’s true that home isn’t a place but a person, he doesn’t know where that is.
Now, Steve thinks about how stupid it was to smash it into pieces and leave it in rain-soaked park bench.
him. I’m sorry, Pepper, but I’m a selfish man, I won’t lie about that. I begged him to find a cure. Extremis, maybe? He perfected that, didn’t he? But no, it wasn’t— he said it wouldn’t work. Sometimes I feel like he gave up but I...He wanted to die human.”
Tony tries to listen to their exchange, but he cannot, because he can’t take his eyes off Steve. Alive. Flesh. No organs hanging from a rotting body.
“It’s because you’re smaller, dad,” Morgan says with a mouthful. She reaches for Tony’s own glass of juice and makes a satisfied sound. Like father, like daughter, Steve thinks.
No, this is Steve shaking his head and twisting his mouth because he knows he’ll win. Without warning, he spits on Tony’s stomach. It's warm. Steve hisses as they both watch it trip towards Tony's chest. Then, he does it and again and again. Three more times in quick and consecutive. Methodological, because it’s Steve. He looks at Tony’s messy chest and stomach, glowing with pride. As if to say,
Morgan petted the wild thing and cooed. Since then, they’ve taken to placing a bowl of cat food by the ledge. It came every other day, usually when Steve was working in the gardens.
Steve spits, rinses his mouth, and splashes water on his face. He takes Tony’s towel, dries his face off.
“I know he doesn’t hate me. I wouldn’t be here if he did.” She holds his gaze for a second longer then pulls away, leading them to the side of the track. “Still. Sometimes our brain tells us things we don’t want to hear.”
Now, the planes of Tony’s chest are hard, his shoulders broader. He’s a lot stronger, and even more devastatingly handsome. The whole world agrees with the statement, but very few have seen him like this: in sweat pants with a hole in his shirt, teeth stained with coffee.
Tony hesitates, unsure and angry at himself for not being certain. He mourned Steve for months, cried himself to sleep with the memory of Steve. Gave up the bottle because if he wasn’t a drunk, then maybe he could fight. Could have shot Bullseye.
“I can’t promise that.” He sobbed out the words. “Don’t leave me. I can’t. I can’t do this without you.”
Steve turned on the shower, setting the temperature to maximum heat. He jumped in, following his daily routine—shampoo, conditioner, soap.
“We cannot be sure, Stark, but it does raise some questions about the sudden appearance of our old friends,” Reed says, eyeing Rhodes and Jessica Drew. “I have to study the biology of this...this thing. Alien. Perhaps, I may be able to invent a detector.”
He thrusted his hips up and rubbed the head of his dick. “Come on, baby. Are you gonna fuck me or not?”
Steve perches on the edge of his own bed, body turned and attuned to Tony’s every move. He can smell the sun on him, and there’s the distinct sharpness of grease around the room. “Tired?”
Peter stifled a laugh. “Yeah, you finally learned something? Now we can exchange notes because Dr. Mitski has been telling me to journal my feelings.”
“Something on your mind?” Steve sits closer to him, bumping their shoulders, too free with his affection.
“We can try.” There’s no doubt that they’d both get pulled into missions and wouldn’t be able to resist.
Steve pushed up, bringing Morgan and Harley to his lap. Harley might be too big for it, ten and a half years old and he’s got all of Tony’s snark. He didn't resist Steve; he slumped over Steve’s chest and hid his face.
Steve didn’t know how much time passed, but he was resolute in seeing Tony Stark tonight. He slammed a hand down, folded the pages of notes neatly and pocketed them. Steve put on his jacket, grabbed his briefcase, and headed out.
Steve intertwined their fingers and brought Tony’s knuckles to his lips. He kissed each one and twisted Tony’s ring with his thumb. “How are you feeling today?”
The city swallows him down. The skyscrapers loom and reach for the sky. Below, he’s just another faceless man. He’s a survivor of the Snap, Decimation, Disappeared, the Blip…whatever people are calling it these days. Steve only knows the gut-wrenching twist in his stomach. He wonders how many more days he can ignore it.
He sighed, knowing he couldn’t stop them. Steve did the same—stayed up at night, eyes tracking the patterns in the darkness. Hands crawling to the left side of the bed.
“Damn,” he takes out the cigarette from his mouth and walks over to the group of people sitting on the streets and hands them the stick. He returns to Steve. “You know, people don’t usually do ‘the right thing,’ these days. At least with my experience.”
Sometimes I just want to put my heart in a blender and think I should do that exact thing to Steve Rogers.
“You really think that, don’t you? Not everyone, Steve, is worth it. You should learn that by now.” Tony looked away, flicked more screens, expanded others. He finally spoke up once the sun started crawling from the horizon. “Alright, well, first things first, I advise you to ditch SHIELD, they can’t be trusted if HYDRA’s embedded in the organization. Romanoff and Barton seem reformed, will they follow you? Hold that thought. Then, we’ll have to track Barnes. J, use my satellite and screen all CCTV’s for anything resembling Barnes.”
Tony hunches his shoulders, wraps his arms over his torso, and briskly walks to the hotel. Steve has only one single thought throughout their short journey: peel off his jacket, give it to Tony, but he’d likely start another row. It isn’t his place now.
Steve hisses, drops a kiss on the chin, and pulls off.  He grabs Tony’s knees, opening them wide to stare at the come dripping down Tony’s hole.
It swallows. Tony follows the movement of Its throat. It’s all Steve, from the mole on the column of its neck to the sharp collarbones. It feels too much like goodbye.
reflexes have slowed. delay in memory processing. slowly, slowly, im deleting. not fast enough. not enough.
“I killed the one that wore my husband's face,” Natasha says, simply without remorse. Her jaw is set and she cocks the pistol. “I’ll kill the rest of them, too. Now move out of the way, Danvers.”
Steve jutted out his jaw, defiant. Steve wore every sentiment on his face, but sometimes Tony still couldn’t figure out thow to read him.
Now, when they fuck, Steve doesn’t spit on him or stop him from coming. There are no rules. Steve stares at him the entire time and his eyes are an awful blue that Tony wants gone.
Tony’s eyes are watering, but he soldiers on, determined. Steve wants to hold him, kiss him badly, tell him that he did the best and they’re all alive and well because of him, but he doesn’t.
“My parents?” Tony furrowed his brows, confused. “If you want anything related to the 40’s or Howling Commandos, all of Howard’s professional papers and belongings have been archived in the SI museum. You can make an appointment with, you know what, nevermind. J, can you schedule Steve a meeting with the head archivist—”
There are tears in his eyes, and he shouldn't be crying because he's endured worst in the field as Iron Man, for fuck's sake. But humiliation washes over him, and Steve, no, the man with Steve's face, is murmuring about bad behavior but Tony can't focus long enough to listen.
He sighs. There’s never waiting for the right moment with Natasha. Her knives are well-maintained, and she doesn’t resist pointing them the first chance she gets.
Behind them, the sun sets to the horizon as the lake rocks in a gentle rhythm. The sound of the chirping swallows and bluebirds are drowned by the cheers of their friends.
And you don’t, Steve almost replies, but he bites the inside of his cheeks and waits for Tony to continue. He’s got no right to be bitter, but in truth, he’s out of his depth. Tony is correct. He doesn’t know how they run the Compound without him. There are things that Steve needs to get used to. Or not, he remembers, he’s not staying, after all.
People noticed them, then moved on. They’re just two men who’ve drifted through life and somehow found each other. Steve pulled Tony to his chest. He won’t let go. This was the first of many kisses.
He tells me like I don’t know, like I don’t know what it’s like to fly, what it’s like to be in space, what it’s like to roam the universe, free as a creature should be.
Pinned to the bed like a bizarre version of Christ, he planned to stay and bleed on the bed sheets instead of opening the bottle.
Steve nodded, pushing his arms as leverage to shift so Tony could hit the right spot. “Yes, anything. You always do. I love—”
“Well, your dad is irresponsible and needs to get rest.” Steve said, fond, before dropping a kiss on Tony’s crown. “Not really a good model for you two.”
He met the kids in the living room. Morgan’s hair was still wet and dripping over the back of her white dress. She opened her arms and held onto Steve’s legs. Harley padded over, eyes grim and stood beside Steve.
They bickered while Steve plated the eggs, pancakes, and fruit on a large tray. He took the carnation and shoved it in a mason glass, clapping his hands in exaggerated flourish.
“Alright. Do you want to bring your blanket?” The sun was out, but Tony was perpetually cold these days. He was wrapped up in a sweater, hair peeking out from his cap. Steve kissed his nose.
Tony protested when Steve removed his hand and pulled off. Tony grabbed his arm, setting it back over his head. “Comfort me, I’m helpless with a fractured rib.”
Steve stared at the RT on Tony’s chest. With a heavy sigh, Steve brought the cloth over his bloody arms. “Why?”
Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve.
“Okay, good.” Tony eyed him closely for a beat, then seemed to decide on something. He snapped his fingers and a digital keyboard appeared from his watch. He leaned forward, setting his feet to the wooden floors, hands going to the keyboard. “J, hack into SHIELD and copy their files into my personal servers. Filter everything you have on The Winter Soldier and James Buchanan Barnes.”
Tony is pinned to the floor with the rest of the debris, Steve’s arm right over his chest. The contrast of the golden undersheath with Steve’s red gloves reminds him of the Iron Man suit and how Steve used to strip the plates off him.
Like a newborn child, all he could see were colors and shapes of memories he couldn’t fully comprehend. His brain was fucked, just a set of nerve endings that failed to separate substantial memories from feelings.
The sound of the ocean hitting the shore is dulled out by the conversations around him. It used to be hard, at first, when he got the serum. He’d hear everything in his proximity, even a whispered conversation. When he woke up in the new century, New York was too loud, too bright, too much. He focused on something though, a single heartbeat that anchored him.
They have his file. They have everything on him. Medical records will show his history. Chronic medical conditions. Heart issues. Health evaluations that note mental disorders. Impairments in decision making abilities. Experimentations to his body.
When Ty offered lines, Tony thought, fuck it, it's a regular Thursday night. He clears his throat. His mouth has the faint taste of bile and something bitter. He really should stop smoking and blow like he's chasing some lost love. Tony supposes that's the thing, isn't it? Running after the high so he can stop thinking so goddamn much. His brain is never quiet. He can have a conversation with three people and be doing equations and inventing something at the same time.
No, he didn’t want to upset Tony. Steve shook his head, tried to focus. For fucks, sake. Tony was the one with—
“You’re leaving tomorrow?” He reaches for the bottle, uncaps it, then takes a sip. She doesn’t offer any to Steve. It wouldn’t have any effect anyway.
Grief didn’t go away. It stayed. There’s the beginning of it—death, but in Tony’s case, it began long before he took his final breath. It began in the diagnosis and Steve has held his breath since the doctors announced the cancer’s recurrence.
Well, of course, after some heavy petting with the shower raining down on them and Tony threatening Steve to increase the water pressure because
Grief hurt. It was worse than waking up in a new century, lost, confused with who he was supposed to be—Captain America. At the end of that tunnel was always Tony, anchoring him. Tony who gave him a home, his best friend and partner before they even got together. Tony was his Shellhead before they decided, fuck it, we’re not invincible, let’s get married, retire, and have kids. Live life. Be happy. Whatever that meant.
Tony waves a hand at the ceiling. “And anyway, Nat’s not much of a cook. She’d live off PB&J if she could. Surprising, I know.”
He settles his duffle bag by the door and drops to his bed. He should shower, wash away the smell of the day’s travel and sweat from his body, but he’s suddenly exhausted.
He’s gotten better these past couple of months. He still thought of Tony every day but with some sort of reluctant acceptance.
Steve doesn't stop until dawn comes. He falls to his knees, the shield to his side, then he watches the sun rise and color the pine trees in flashes of light.
“It snows in New York and you did just fine there.” Steve smiles, leaning down to give Tony a peck on the lips.
“No, Stark. Do not think I do not want him, because I do. But it isn’t him, it isn’t. I close my eyes and I know who James is. This isn’t James...I think I’m going insane. I tried to speak with Carol about Rhodes, but she wouldn’t hear it.” she trails off, eyeing something over the mines.
“I’ll presume a dear friend of mine provided you those orders.” Tony clenched his jaw, wondering what Carol threatened the hotel staff with. “Bring me the bottles and you’ll get a two-thousand dollar tip.”
—happy in a way that Steve wishes he could see for the rest of his life. It’s a dull ache deep inside him. He’s been content to watch from afar, but the invitation for more—to press his face to the glass and breathe the same air as this man—was too much of a good offer, of a dream come true, to pass.
Steve climbed in, no care for getting his clothes wet. He pulled Tony into his arms, embracing him as if the single act could erase their sins, rewrite their mistakes.
Tony doesn’t look up. Both of his hands are occupied by a set of wires and a long, thin tweezer. “What can I do for you?”
For Steve and Tony, it was carving out a space for each other, willing for it to work even if they both understood the possibility of failure.
Steve finally breaks a sweat. We’ve been going at this for a while. He needs to work it out. He needs this body, this face, this brain. He craves this voice. That’s why I’m here.
“I’ll take good care of it,” Steve promises, realizing how young the salesman actually looks. He couldn’t have been older than his early twenties. Did he take over the family business? Steve doesn’t ask whether his father had Disappeared or simply died. In their minds, it might be the same, but he wonders if people are still hoping for a miracle. A resurrection.
“Why are you here? You already said we aren’t friends. We’ll never be friends again, you said. In Asgard, you punched me, you —”
There's about 37 trillion cells in the body. The ordinary man cannot fathom such a large number without comparison to something else. You're made up of all of that and more. And somehow I think you're greater. 37 trillion cells in the body and each one tells me that I miss you, Winghead.
“Yes, well, you know it’s common knowledge to not trust the dealer,” the salesman sighs and taps the side of the door. His gaze measures Steve up and down. “Could never sell that damn thing. Fine, take it off my hands.”
He needed to get their affairs in order. But he couldn’t leave his bed. He hasn’t taken a shower in days. He hasn’t even brushed his teeth or bothered to wash his face.
A hand reaches for Steve’s menu. Fingers scarred with burns and cuts. No ring. Just nails trimmed short and neat, clean despite all the work Tony does with his hands. Steve follows the line of his veins on the back of his hand to the dust of soft hairs on his wrist, up his strong forearms, his shoulders, then finally, his eyes meet Tony’s own in question.
He doesn’t visit Tony at nightfall. He doesn’t push. He stays a polite distance. Curious, but unaffected.
The room on the top floor was painted in a mix of stars (Steve’s suggestion) and equations (Tony’s insistence) and adorned in too many toys for a newborn baby.
“Alright, Captain Handsome. I’ll be more careful. Just so you know, I am careful, Steve. That was a calculated risk. JARVIS informed me that the chances for survival were high. You don’t have to carry the world’s burden on your shoulder. If I fuck up in the field, that isn’t on you.”
“But I can’t hold onto that.” His voice wavered. The sun was too bright and it irritated him. It was supposed to be somber. His husband just died. But instead, the gardens were beautiful and irrationally, it made him angry that pretty things could still exist when the most stunning person in the world just passed away. “I can’t pull that into my arms. Kiss it. Sleep next to it.”
The mindset is different in New York and Los Angeles. But even then, Koreatown and Venice residents move to different spheres. When he heard of Los Angeles, he thought of Hollywood and all the glimmer and glitter of actors. Koreatown is a working class neighborhood that reminds him of Red Hook. Venice is something else.
It’s only when Tony felt the wetness sliding down his neck did he realize that Steve was crying, too, then he said, “When I learned you were in a coma, I — I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t. I don’t want to lose you. I — I haven’t lost you, have I?”
“Honey,” Tony says the endearment, a thousand different memories of them exchanging the word somehow relieves the tightness in his chest. They have that, still. But the word comes out jagged, wrong, without the same affection. All that’s here is the desperation to hold on, make it right.
There was no cure. If he closed his eyes, he’d see the doctors shaking their heads with matching grim expressions.
Outside, a speeding car flashes a rosy tint through the window. The shape dances across Tony’s cheekbones. He’s handsome, and his bones are lived in, like he’s settled into himself as sure as daybreak.
“West. To see the Great Americana,” he says with a deceptive smile. He’s looking forward to the drive, the backcountry roads, pausing at small towns and offering help where he can.
He nods, flicks his cigarette and watches the ash dance towards the concrete floor. “You’ll be the first to know.”
He could tilt Tony’s chin, force their eyes to meet, and press their lips together. Say sorry, how he’s so fucking sorry and selfish. But Steve doesn’t because he needs to keep his eyes on the road and his hands on the wheel, and if he starts now, he’ll never stop.
“You sure about,” the salesman starts to ask with a grimace, subtly directing Steve to newer models further down the lot, “an ’87 Land Cruiser? It’s a bit outdated, don’t you think?”
They sat up on the rooftop garden surrounded by these wild forget-me-nots that grew out of nowhere. It was fitting. They were flowers for remembering and a fated love. A deep blue color that suggested some bullshit about true love.
There was Tony coming out of the ship with Nebula in tow, and then Steve followed Danvers into a ship heading to The Garden.
Steve wished they were still small so he could just hold all three of them in his arms at the same time. His heart was flayed with the wanting, the longing, and the hurt this is his life now. When they were all toddlers, he and Tony used to prop them all up in the middle of the bed and watch them coo and roll around, reaching for their dad and papa with pudgy hands.
The cat glanced up from the bowl, then jumped off the ledge. It disappeared and Steve was once again alone in the garden.
He wondered whether being Iron Man might be an addiction too. Because once you're an alcoholic, you'll always be one. You drop the bottle and tell yourself that you're better, but you've just replaced your addiction with a healthy obsession. Something socially acceptable.
The following morning, Steve wakes to the breeze drifting in through the crack from the glass door. The pale blue curtains blow back and forth.
“STARK!” Natasha strides beside him, firing bullets at the Skrulls, but they’re warriors, well trained. Bullets seem like child play.
“J, are the kids near?” Pepper sat on their bed, eyes a clear blue. “I think they’d enjoy the donuts before their daddy eats them all.”
Steve prefers me pliant and needy: desperate for his arms around me, soft for his kisses, nearly distressed for how much I want him to be inside me. But he also likes when I resist, so I turn away from him, and he grabs me by the hips, pulling me to him until he can get on top of me.
On and on, two years on the run, and three years more — Steve is running and running, unable to remember when the marathon began.
Thank the gods for Happy Hogan battling off the wild boars and dragging Steve’s body out of the pen while Fisk and his hired guns were distracted by Tony’s shouting and uncoordinated shots at Bullseye. Hogan had taken his father’s carriage and sped off to the Savage Mountain for Strange’s abode.
He makes himself feel better by reminding himself that Tony does the same thing. The only one who have a sense of moderation when it comes to her are Pepper and Rhodey. But even then, it’s short lived, and Morgan gets what she wants. It’s true, she’s spoiled, but she’s also generous and doesn’t ask for what she doesn’t need.
A quick scan with Extremis informs Tony that the Tower is empty except for Jarvis who’s away in his quarters.
He clicks the send button and breathes out a sigh. When he glances to the left, the child from earlier is pulling at his mother’s hair, and she allows the soft tug with a laugh.
He worried about Tony, wanted to sit Tony down and check if he was alright after the fiasco with Doom.
Steve shoved a hand between them. Their bodies were sticky with sweat. He grabbed Tony’s cock, scratching at the wiry hairs framing his shaft before jerking him quickly.
“So are the hummingbirds,” Tony observes, using his hand as a visor. He has a soft smile on his face when he glances back at Steve, communicating a thousand things at once. But all Steve feels is satisfaction, happiness that this is his. He has somewhere, someone, people, he belongs to and who belong to him in return.
Sometimes, when the kids were at school, Steve screamed until his throat was sore. He pounded on the punching bag wishing like hell he was still in the field just so he could take his rage out on something. Maybe, he’d even get hit just to feel like he was still alive, not this hollow shell of a person he’s becoming.
Tony crumbles. Inch by inch until Steve’s pulling himself up, grabbing his shield. Tony scurries like that damned pack of rats from earlier, and calls for the suit.
Well, Steve wouldn’t really know this other than the fact that JARVIS monitored anything related to Tony Stark and gave Steve a summary of it every morning. It began after Tony was diagnosed for the first time. He never asked JARVIS to stop even when Tony went into remission. The AI’s daily precis provided an overview of Tony’s health levels, his calendar, and any news related to SI, Avengers, and Tony himself.
as Avengers, heroes, people. Fucking humans. It would have been worse. But maybe that’s the failure of heroism, Steve, you damn yourself in the process of what’s right.
be home, because this is temporary. A wish fulfilled in an inverted way. Nothing can take root here because it isn’t permanent and Steve would be stupid to think otherwise.
as if the statement sufficed as an invitation to two people he’s never considered friends. Allies and teammates, yes, but they were Tony’s people.
“Good,” Samuel says, and they all earn a cheer from their bystanders. One starts rattling about how his mother makes the best iced-tea, and won’t Tony Stark please come visit to have a taste, and perhaps, fix up a broken TV set they have lying in the garage. More requests follow, and rather than being overwhelmed, Tony agrees to them all, as long as there’s tea and snacks involved.
She laughs. It’s a high pitched sound that reminds him of her hummingbirds. “I can think of someone who likes it.” Then, it’s gone too soon. More somber, with a hollow smile she adds, “You have everything you need?”
The man who let him into the entrance is back and on the porch, smoking again. He doesn’t even pay attention to Tony or Steve.
“That was then, this is now.” Tony says, “Maybe it takes the end of the world, rock bottom, for me to finally realize. I apologize that it took me so long.”
“And he looks good doing it.” Steve laughs and slips his free hand under the table to grip Tony’s thigh. He’s met with a grin.
“So, how’d you get Stark to settle down?” Samuel asks, bringing him back to reality. Samuel adds, tone playful, “Don’t ignore the inquiry, boy.”
Tony's long finished his omelette, but there's a side of half-eaten French Toast he continues to pick on, stripping tiny sections with syrup sticky fingers.
Steve is a leader and this country’s moral compass. He stands with his back straight and he listens attentively. Everyone trusts him. It’s Captain America, for fucks sake.
Steve watches Riri, Kate, and Tony work around each other in the kitchen. Bacon is taken from the fridge, along with fresh brown eggs. Sliced bread is shoved into the toaster.
Steve can’t see the future and he’s making a mistake. Tony bites the words down, letting himself drift into that hazy comfort of Steve’s warmth. They kiss and kiss, trade spit and quiet little groans. Tony drinks all of it in, every pant, soft breath.
Steve picked up the tinted sunglasses with shaky fingers. He swallowed, plastered on an encouraging smile and offered it to Peter. “Well, try it on. I bet it would look good on you.”
“Sprung this one on me the way you sprung out wanting some chickens after you saw Iz’s hens, huh?” Steve tries to steady himself. He scruffs his feet before staring back at Tony.
Steve stood beside her, learning against the counter. “I never did things that were easy. I’ll never learn.”
These days, with gods, aliens, and a boatload of science experiments, Steve’s fate in the Lord has been shaken. He didn't know if he still believed in an all-knowing God, but he wondered about Tony's soul. He couldn't stand the thought of burying his body six feet below ground, to be eaten away, to decompose.
It was Asgard all over again. Tony’s mind had attempted to provide him context. Back then, it gave him the glimpses of life after he got Extremis, impressions of people's reactions to him. But his mind was catching up now. He sought Steve out in Asgard, placed a hand on his shoulder.
“That’s right, let me fuck your mouth,” Tony grabbed his jaw, caressing it before pressing his dick inside.
He lets himself look at Steve now, takes in those bright eyes, not tarnished by rage or fear. He’s satisfied. He’s winning.
It's a surprise he can still cry. But here he is, staring back at Steve, willing reason to dawn on him.
Natasha studies him. He turns away. If she looks too closely, there’s no doubt she’ll read him as easy as a practice target.
Steve set the bowl down and touched his jaw. He missed the beard, only because Tony liked to run his fingers on the fine hair and teased him relentlessly about being Captain Handsome.
“Just a few weeks.” Steve shoves both hands into his jacket. It’s too warm to keep on, but he doesn’t take it off. “Not long enough to appreciate the differences in the region, I suppose.”
“It seems like you all moved on and I’m the only one—God, Pops is pretending that dad is still here. He wrote
Steve, the other one, the real one, hated it all. The Steve in front of him despises it, too, to an extent, but he can play with and test Tony’s limitations. Carve at his heart until there’s nothing left.
Some days Steve was lost in the harvesting, focusing on tenting the garden, watering the plants. He didn’t think of the cat—
He’s deep in the Arctic, kicking his feet against the force of the water, raising his hands until his muscles tire, reaching. He’s grasping for land; asking for air; wanting freedom.
He didn’t want to tell her about heaven. Tony Stark was a scientist and so were their children. They believed in what was observable, replicable, what could be proven and debunked. Despite the fact that they met aliens, gods, and superhumans, the notion of heaven seemed too much like faith, something too philosophical. Steve didn’t even believe in heaven anymore.
Everyone has their assisted seats and dedicated role to the team. He knows there hasn’t been any other world-ending crisis, and if there was, he hasn’t been informed.
“Why wouldn’t it be?” Tony grabs a paperboy from the side table and waves it at Steve. “This should hold you over for now.” Tony throws him the bagel, underhanded.
He didn’t know how much time passed. His ring finger was bare and there was a tan line on where it used to be.
“No, don’t.” Steve gave a laugh, and it sounded jagged and unbearably wrong, because out of the both of them, Steve was the more honest man. “You — it was all you. Me and you at the core of it. I wish I could hate you.” Steve walked to the windows and roughly drew the curtains back. “Do you know what it’s like to have your blood on my shield, how worthless of a man I felt? I could have killed you.”
Here’s what Tony’s always wanted. Maybe if he closes his eyes he can pretend that the man in front of him isn’t Steve.
Somehow, Steve doesn’t bleed to death on the ride, and isn’t that just Mr. Steven Grant Rogers to defy nature herself? Tony still can’t believe that the scientist, Erskine experimented on Steve. Erskine was having tea with Strange, exchanging notes on a medical experiment, when Happy Hogan came rushing through the doors.
“That’s because I’m the romantic one.” Tony laughs and shoves his side, an attempt to tickle him. Steve makes a face, tries to slip away, he does not appreciate being tickled, but Tony’s prosthetic arm is strong, and yes, indeed, while Steve can break away, but he doesn’t because Tony’s face splits into a grin and Morgan’s setting her burrito down to join Tony’s forces.
“Sometimes I can’t believe I’m here. In this house, sharing a bed with you. How did I get so lucky?” Tony sighs and flutters his eyes open.
Steve waits for FRIDAY to announce his arrival, but Tony remains focused on the specs in front of him, two suits by his side. He presses a hand to the glass door and it opens without a sound.
It was the coordinates of their park bench where they had their first kiss. The park bench where Steve bent down, pretended to tie his shoelace and presented Tony with a ring.
Steve’s portrait, large and immaculate, still hangs in the conference room and when Tony has meetings with the other Avengers—well, the ones that are still there and backing him—he can’t help but stare at the painting, wondering whether Steve hates him. “Let’s not fight tonight. Not here.”
Outside their brownstone were photographers and journalists taking pictures of the car. Some went as far as knocking on the tinted glass. He tried to shield Morgan from it, turning her head to his arm once the screaming began.
Tony appeased Steve’s worries with the schematics of the new arc reactor that was removable using nanotech. Instead of a perfect circle, it was now a semi-triangle that stood proudly on his sternum. The suit would envelope his body when Tony tapped it twice. It was striking, like seeing the sky for the first time. It would glow blue, then the suit would form over his body. There was only one word for it: ingenious.
But the choice isn’t his to make because there’s a tap on the window. Natasha appears on the passenger side with a raised eyebrow. She knocks again, a tiny smile on her face.
Steve sobbed, an ugly, broken sound. He set the ring on his palm, prodded it, twisted it until the light caught over it. He remembered getting down on one knee and presenting Tony the box with a laugh. Then, like a hurricane, there was the memory of prying the ring out of Tony’s cold hands. Of Steve on the rooftop garden, surrounded by his kids and the body of their dead father.
It’s likely that Steve already left, there’s no reason to stay. Tony rises from bed, finds his clothes from last night, and drops them back on the sofa. He grabs the comforter, wrapping it around his body. Barefoot, he pads out to the hallway and into the second floor. There’s the distinct smell of bacon and pasta water. Moving slow, he walks to the kitchen to find a figure with broad shoulders, trim waist, and a straight back. It’s not, Ty.
to me. But there’s only one thing I can say,” he choked, his vision blurry. Morgan wiped at his tears as Peter shoved over and held them all together. “He loved you. And you’re the best part of him. Of us. And leaving was the hardest thing he’s ever done. He didn’t want to go. He didn’t. He wanted to watch all of you grow up. We — we were supposed to grow old together.”
Steve doesn’t know what to do, but that’s the great thing about running, whether you’re on your feet, in a plane soaring higher than the clouds, or in a car, you don’t always have to think too hard. In the car, it’s simple. It’s break, go, break, go, turn left, turn right. Break and go. There’s no right side, no wrong side, just the road where you want to go.
“Tones, man.” Rhodes sat on Tony’s right side, careful not to jostle the bed. He seemed lost for words.
“I’m furious, and you’re drinking again.” He must have seen something in Tony’s face because his expression softened. He plucked the gauze from the drawer and rubbed ointment on Tony’s hands, up his arms. He bandaged them, a frown on his face. “And you’re right, there are things we should talk about. It's hard to bury what happened between us. I never thought we'd get to this point. We’re a mess.”
“You wanna get out of here? You seem uncomfortable,” Tony throws a hand at him, then the rest of the room.
This results in Johnny Storm gloating that his brother-in-law, Reed Richards, also has an AI, so it’s truly no surprise for Johnny to be bothered by FRIDAY.
Outside, it’s nearly pitch black. From here, the stars are visible, twinkling against the winter breeze. His jacket is too light for a walk. He should have taken out the sherpa from the trunk, but it’s fine. He spent seventy years in ice, he could survive a brisk jog down the street.
“You’re not alone. Remember that, Steve.” She squeezed his shoulder then fixed his tie. Battle ready, again. When could they stop making every day into something that’s a warpath?
Or was one of us always fated to fall? I am guilty, Steve. It's my fault. That’s on me. Something crazy happened, though. You, that version of you, said "I believe you." That's all that mattered. You. Hearing the words come out of your mouth in that baritone. I almost believed it too. But you and I talk both in our suits and the distance grows, grows, and grows. Strange said some bullshit about the Invaders coming back because it's the will of the people. Regret makes us all wish on wishing bones.
Steve eyed him and tried to pull off a set of puppy eyes. “JARVIS, tell Pepper that Tony and I ran into an emergency at home and he’ll be unable to attend the board meeting.”
Tony laughed, hiding his face on Steve’s chest. “I thought I was supposed to be the bad influence,” Tony mumbled.
Tony couldn’t help it. Steve found his weak points and rather than jab at it and press on the bruise, he caressed it, tutted instead, wrapped Tony up in this gauze pad of care and affection.
“Odd things have been happening, Stark. I tell you. First, Banner destroying the fields on the outskirts! Where I have family, too! Suddenly, we got Parker walking on brick walls, then, now this kid Tommy running faster than human possible? That’s just the things we’ve seen. There’s so much more we don’t know.”
Better than lying here, beside Steve, digging up parts of what is left of himself, grinding it into dust.
“Oh save it, honey.” He waves a hand and blows out a sigh dramatically. “I know. The heart is ruled by this foolish thing called love.”
“Anything. Everything. I’ll give you whatever you want. You can have it all. I’ll give everything you want.”
He groaned, pressing his fingers to the bridge of his nose. He couldn’t see her. He couldn’t think. But most of all, he needed to stop being a mess. He knew this, understood with conviction that he needed to be Iron Man.
“You just gamble your heart away when you hope.” Tony looks away and pushes his plate away. He stands without a second glance, and Steve wants nothing more than to make him stay put, so he says, “does that still stop you?”
During lunch, all of Steve’s focus is devoted to keeping his hands still. He’s never been jittery. Not really. This might be a new development around Tony Stark.
There's this hint of bitterness in his eyes, the way he carries tension in his shoulders, the grim line of his mouth. Steve's body is draped over Tony and he’s jabbing a gloved finger on Tony’s face.
“Morning, Red Wolf.” Tony rolls the pipe between his fingers, observing the way Tommy Shepard’s ragtag group of friends mess with the horses at a distance. “You alright?”
”Morgan, Peter, Harley, it’s been an adventure being your dad. I wish I was there to protect you from darkness and whatever else this universe brings. I wish, damn. I wish so much, baby. To be there for you. See you everyday. But you’ll grow up in this reality. Without me. God, I told myself I wasn’t going to cry. Kids, I hope like hell you’ll do good.
“I love you, more.” Steve sat up, letting the sheets pool over his waist. “You want breakfast in bed with them?”
“Hey, Steve. Do you wanna be called Papa? I’ll be dad.” Tony turned to him, a huge smile on his face. He was dazzling, the portrait of a happy man.
Steve lets the sound of children bickering by the alcove and the hodgepodge of languages distract him for a brief moment. Elementary children run up and down the narrow stairs. One child skips to the balcony and beckons the others. Mothers scold them with tea in one hand before turning to resume a conversation with their companion. There are men beside him smoking cigars.
He pushes up, repositions himself so he’s straddling Steve. Tony grabs Steve’s neck, squeezes it, again and again, making himself remember that this is real. With their foreheads pressed close, he ghosts a kiss on Steve’s eyelids, feels it damp, and has his heart broken again and again.
You would have hated it. This. Me. Extremis. Who I am now. I’ve always wanted to stand next to you and be invincible. I’m human, Steve, you can’t fault me for chasing after dreams. Not when I believed it to be the best.
Natasha held his gaze for a moment. She had always seen past his defenses. There wasn't a wall that Agent Romanoff couldn’t penetrate. This time, Nat didn’t bother him with platitudes.
She looked so damned earnest, he couldn’t do anything but hide his head in shame. Tony dropped his head and turned to count the patterns of the flickering light.
“Bullshit. Just take it.” Tony bulls his hands away from the shield and shoves them in his pocket. “It’ll help all of us sleep better at night knowing you got that.”
He spent a lot of time on the rooftop, observing New York from below in black out mode. No one could see him break down and be lightheaded with tears as memories of Tony engulf him.
I couldn’t talk to Cap though. Carol thinks too much of me. Said I'm the leader of SHIELD because I'm "stronger than anyone." It's not true, Steve. Sometimes a man just gets used to crisis and desensitized to violence.
She looked up at Steve, eyes wet, mouth trembling. Tony’s eyes stared back at him. “I don’t want to go, papa.”
“That’s because she’s the youngest,” Bucky replied, flicking Harley’s ear. They got into a playful tussle that only stopped once Bucky threatened to make Harley sit on his lap.
“Sometimes I’m afraid,” Tony confesses with a sigh. “The world is still broken, you know that. I know that. Sometimes I think you and I can be doing more.” Tony gestures at their little home, both of them are lying on the sofa with the television humming in the background. The kitchen lights are set in a low dim, but other than that, they’re cocooned around each other in the darkness.
Above the mantel hung an idyllic painting of the countryside. Flowers in bloom. Children running around with their plaid skirts. If only life could be like that.
She glanced away and waved the kids over for a hug. Over the years, she became freer with her affection. Steve didn’t know if that was because she couldn’t have kids because of the experimentation in the Red Room.
His limbs ache from disuse. He’s always horizontal these days. Thighs spread wide. Just a hole to fill.
“Nat,” he says, clenching his jaw. He feels tension on his back. Natasha drops her facade and raises an eyebrow. “I’m still learning.”
Steve’s shirt clung onto his torso, but instead of doing something about it, he led Tony to the bed. He lifted the sheets up, raising an eyebrow.
Steve stepped back, admired the Pothos without all the brown leaves drooping down. The sun shone through the large windows in the living room, catching on the picture frames and the bamboo flooring.
He sits there, engine still running, seatbelt still buckled, documenting the changes in the Compound. Steve wonders whether Tony decided on the new updates himself, or if Natasha and the others had offered suggestions. There’s so much Steve has missed.
“I just —“ He swallows and keeps still. Breathing exercises are important to quell the defense in his tongue. He doesn’t want to fight, he didn’t come here for that. “I wanted to say goodbye.”
I close my eyes for a moment, gathering my thoughts, pulling myself together, thrusting this awful suit around me.
The world kept spinning, around and around, on a set path around the sun. Steve's own course was astray. He's just a burning star now, cycling through space until he reached his end.
“No, nope. They’re all you, baby. I’ll fight you till the end of time.” Tony rubbed the back of Steve’s neck, a gesture of comfort. It was all wrong—Tony was the one with a tumor with the same exact size of Steve’s entire world.
It's been too long since Steve's seen him like this, unreserved and a little bit more at ease. Maybe it's all just about exposure therapy, Steve thinks darkly. Maybe Tony can get used to him again, and if he does, maybe he won't turn away from Steve, maybe his gaze would linger a beat longer.
“And Riri Williams, too. Funny, how she calls herself Ironheart. There’s your legacy, Tony Stark.” The man who wear’s Steve’s face smiles, a vicious thing. He looks so much like Steve, he even smells like him. Every sorry day Tony wakes up, he has to remind himself that this isn’t Steve.
This is evidence of Tony’s sacrifice. This is why they have today, why the rest of them are still here, still breathing, living, making mistakes, apologizing, and trying to have hope all the same.
Tony's breath caught, and his heart, the rotten thing, fell into shambles. He unlaced their fingers and pushed Steve's hair back, finally giving into the desire. His fingers followed the line from Steve's head, down to his cheeks, wiping at the wetness there.
Harley and Peter were chatting with the Bartons by the fireplace, faces animated. Steve picked up a few scientific words which just went over his head.
In lieu of speaking, Steve switches lanes, then signals back to the right to return to his original position. They've passed the high traffic volume of Cleveland and are now somewhere deeper into the state.
Steve has heard the gossip and awe over the ring, the envy over what a handsome couple they make, the adoration of the heir and the heiress redefining Stark-Fujikawa as something beyond a mere business partnership.
When Steve turns back to Tony, there’s a deprecating smile on his face. It’s wrong. Steve is a man who should always wear a genuine smile. Tony used to think there wasn’t a single bad atom in Steve’s body. Maybe he’s wrong about that too.
When Tony first showed him the schemes of the Compound, his lips twisted. Tony had rolled his eyes and said,
“No, I’m seeing this through.” Steve’s voice is dark, excited. The sounds are very far away, like Tony’s hearing the world unfold underwater.
It's chilly. The clouds are clustered towards the east, a haze resting along the silhouette of the city. Their proximity to the shore makes abandoned napkins flap through the streets, floating and falling into the sea. Steve's learned to welcome the cold these days. Besides, the temperature is bearable, nothing like cold winters further up north. It’s meditative to stare at nothing in particular, like some sort of placid, everyday man. He’s nothing special these days, inclined to fall into anonymity.
Steve plucked the flower, sat on the wicker chair, and dropped the carnation on the space beside him.
“Someone had to, if not, we’d all starve,” he offers easily before turning to Steve, suddenly serious. “I’ve had time to think and figure out what I want. I know myself now. Half the world is missing, so are Riri’s parents. They depend on me, you know, I have to learn how to do things. Adult things. I tell them good job. Make sure they do their homework. I have to cook us meals. Have regular hours. I can’t spend night and day in my room getting drunk because I’m grieving.”
“As long as your local newscaster doesn’t come asking for interviews, then that’s all fine.” Tony quips, pulling out a small toolbox from his back pocket. Steve nearly laughs at the sight. Tony is never without his tools.
Steve choked off as Tony dragged his hips back and stopped his thrusts. He pressed Steve to his back instead and loomed over. He was such a gorgeous man. In their years together, his temples have grayed and there were new lines on the edges of his eyes. But wow, what a life. What a world and blessing to grow old together. They had all the time in the world now.
He woke up from the coma, they fought Osborn, and now he was here, reeling with the blowback. His brain kept feeding him images of his failures. There was something fucked there, but Tony didn’t bother to check. Maybe remembering was his punishment.
Is that it, Steve. Is it. Our home is in ruins. Funny, our portrait still hangs even after the destruction. Even after I threw you across the hall and you punched me in the face and I wish I grabbed your by the shoulders and kissed you stupid instead. Bite and make you bleed some other way.
Does he? No, not really. He doesn’t want to talk at all. He prefers the silence. Watching Tony work on his projects. Steve, tucked on the sofa at the corner of the workshop. Still there, but out of sight.
Christmas is a small affair between them. Peter is with May, but he FaceTimes them for over two hours, chatting about his first semester at NYU. Tony is still a bit sore that he traded off being  a Beaver to a Bobcat. But Steve reminds him that their kids have to make their own decisions and make their own paths, no matter how they wish they were both there every step of the way. Morgan keeps popping up from the screen to tease him about MJ and Peter’s new friend, Johnny Storm.
There’s the garden he’s trying to build again. It’s slow going but he had all the needed materials to start planting cucumbers again. The row of dwarf carnations haven’t fully bloomed, but there’s two white flowers, striking in a sea of greens. Steve took the petals and rubbed his fingertips on the stem.
He was too old for it, but he didn’t pull away. Instead, he bumped Steve’s shoulder with a wry grin.
He read the files many years ago in a SHIELD office. The serum enhanced recovery and healing abilities. Steve’s fallen off a building, got stabbed in the stomach, mangled his legs, and everytime, the serum helped him bounce back. Physically, he wasn't hurt, but everyday without Tony felt like dropping the Valkyrie down into the Arctic. He was always cold and miserable.
Steve swallowed the sound of protest rising from his chest. If Tony wanted to hit something, it might as well be Steve. He could take it. He didn’t try to approach Tony. He wasn’t sure what he could do. “Yes. Of course. Everyone is worth saving.”
“Huh.” Tony blinks, and his mouth opens then closes only to open again, like he’s on the edge of realization. “Somehow, I think I am. Yeah. I am.”
“Too salty!” Tony exclaims, but continues to chew thoughtfully. Steve pours him a glass of water from the pitcher.
"It's a lie. Time doesn't heal the wounds. It doesn't take time. It just gets worse on some days. Then other days are better to handle, you feel normal. You could go for a run, go out with friends, then you might go to the grocery store, and pause, and think, that 'Hey, they'd like this.'" The woman swallowed, fixing her gaze at her sandals. "Then maybe in the middle of that aisle you'd turn, hoping to see them. But you're alone. Love doesn't go away. Moving on happens, yeah, of course. We all gotta do that, it’s why we’re all here, right?” She tilted her head, suddenly, her piercing gaze was on Steve. “But we gotta go on. Keep rolling the dice. Breathe in and out. Go live the next day…” She looked away, lips wobbly.
He wonders when exactly the Compound started feeling uncomfortable, whether it was before he told Natasha,
Steve's hair is longer, perhaps a little too long for a professional man upholding the law, but he's clean shaven and the red scarf necktie sits like seduction personified, on the column of his throat. One day, he’ll give Steve a bolo tie, with vibranium tipped coils and a jaded pendant.
He can pretend, can lie to himself, like he’s been lying his whole life. Steve’s gotten good at denial.
But Tony’s one of the few who sees him like this—chest panting, sweat dripping from his temples, mouth open, desperate to have his dick sucked.
They needed to unpack. Tony said they could hire movers, but Steve wanted the whole moving in together experience—choosing the decor together, selecting which cabinet to put the dishes in, and arguing about where they should place the two plush chairs. Should it be by the fireplace or by the windows?
One step after the other, and then he's out of the lab, foregoing the elevator to climb the stairs three at a time. He jogs out the hall and into a side exit, the feel of the shield light in his arm. But his heart feels heavy, and then he's running out into the concrete then into the grass.
He’s reduced to a series of organs that function to sustain a life half-lived, a life that doesn’t matter to anyone but Steve. Just command signs to his brain.
He let it fester, information darting from one memory to another. Jumping and jumping. He kept leaping across different times. Tony closed his eyes and pressed a hand to his forehead. The other was still stapled to the bed.
They woke up that morning with JARVIS slowly filtering in the light from their tinted glass window. It crept up into the room like a slow crawl, painting the wooden floors in light colors. Steve kissed Tony awake.
“God, you’re the little spoon and no one believes me.” Tony wraps an arm over Steve and pulls him closer, letting their lips meet for a peck.
Steve didn't bother reading the details. He held the folder up, closing it. “It just seems so permanent. With this.”
“I only did that because I knew you wanted chickens. You practically built a hen-house the same day. Only sprung this up on you because you’d rise to the occasion.”
“What? Uh, no, Buck, it’s not like that,” Steve directed his gaze back to Bucky. He didn’t realize he was staring at Tony. “Not at all. We’re just teammates.”
He thinks back to all he’s witnessed these last three years since the Snap. Sure, there’s been minor battles here and there, no crisis. There was chaos after half the world suddenly disappeared. There were jobs to fill; hospitals and community organizations were short-staffed. The list was endless, and yet, he expected the world to stay grim, disillusioned like him.
What—” Harley scrubbed his eyes, kicked his feet petulant. “He wasn’t even here to pick this for me!”
There's only the stick-shift between them and Steve wants nothing more than to reach over, grab Tony's hand, ask him to say something, anything to fill the silence.
Steve stands outside the Compound with a straight back, face free of bitterness. At least, he’s trying to school his expression into aloofness. He’d rather be expressionless than reflect the turmoil of departure again.
At least Steve’s time here is short— short enough so they don’t have to fight but not long enough to soothe the creases and cuts in their friendship.
With glassy eyes, he looked at the mess of his home. There’s unwashed dishes and dirty rags spoiling the imported tables. Tony’s never been one for fancy china, but he’s a Stark through and through. His flat is a combination of stylish imports he inherited from his family and tools for his inventions.
Tony's grabbed purchase on his shoulders and like the good boy he was, met Steve's brutal thrusts. His lips were slightly open, a moan on his lips.
“We all are. You know, for a man who spent two years talking about home and moping around, you sure do spend a lot of time away.”
Steve took my left hand and had it stitched back by medical. I don’t know what’s worse. The false generosity of his mercy, or the searing pain of the cut from his shield.
I think it’s a load of shit, but I’ve learned to hold my tongue. Otherwise, Steve will make me stick it out and cut it himself.
Steve watched, awe-struck to see Tony Stark in his element. The word genius didn’t cover it. He was more an enigma, something Steve didn’t even try to name. All words failed him. He watched Tony pace across the room, swiping his hands on the holoscreens to expand them and bring them forward. He talked to J, running scenarios and summarizing files. At some point, the holoscreens followed Tony as he brewed a cup of strong coffee.
Natasha sits on the rolling chair, perches her sock-clad feet onto the table and gestures for Steve. He sits on the sofa across from her.
He pulled Tony’s waist and kissed him stupid. Tony ran both hands over Steve’s shoulder, scratching the fabric before inching his hands to Steve’s back, then lower, to cup Steve’s ass. They made out for a while, with languid tongues, exchanging spit.
Steve pushes him down onto the mattress and pulls the covers over him, like a demented version of domesticity Tony once fantasied. He sits on the side of the bed, pushes Tony’s hair back, a look of satisfaction on his face. “Be good while I’m away.”
“Better not, we have kids here,” Rhodes points at the end of the table where Johnny, Peter, and Morgan are seated.
But Steve isn’t like Tony, and it’s been too long, so he lets himself have this: he lets his mind take in the new changes in Tony, listing the way he seems infinitely lighter, as if he isn't struggling with the fall out of the Snap.
Tony’s no longer eating Rumiko out, but she’s got her fingers on her clit and she’s pushing Tony back to Steve. Permission granted. It makes him feel sick that she’s letting this happen, and he’s a goddamn dog, taking the proffered scraps.
His eyes flash and Steve knows his next words have to be careful. He hates this. He hates that he has to choose his words, he hates that he can’t just say the first thing that comes to mind.
“Alright, alright, okay. Good.” Steve scrubbed the tears on his blotchy face over Tony’s head and neck. Again and again. He couldn’t even wipe his wet face anymore. He listened to the beat of Tony’s heart, holding onto its sound the way someone might try to stop a ticking time bomb.
“I can hear you, Harley. Keep behaving like that and you won’t get your present from us tonight!” Carol rolled her eyes. She made her way to Steve, gave him a half-hug and a brief squeeze on the bicep. “Steve. You look good.”
Tony flattened his tongue and drew circles on Steve’s rim. “Hmm, you taste so good, Steve.” He pressed two thumbs on the edge of the hole, putting slight pressure before letting one dip inside. Tony licked a wet stripe in his asshole, once, twice, before pulling away.
Steve wonders if it’s purposeful, though, that they’re never alone. If they all anticipated Steve to stumble over his words and say the wrong thing and eventually get into a shouting match with Tony, throwing out half-based reasons and long-winded justifications for leaving, for not staying, for running. For being them.
Steve didn’t need a therapist. He needed Tony. Here. In the flesh to bully him into making breakfast.
Steve resurfaced, not even realizing that he was sketching Tony. He didn’t try to hide the yellow note. Tony already saw it anyway.
One day, a man woke up and 70 years went by. His SHIELD-instituted councilors wrote that Steve was “coping well,” on his report. He was cleared for the field and only required to see the councilors once a month. He was normal. He was fine. Fury had him leading missions across the globe because his psychological assessment was deemed passable.
“Uh, no, I haven’t been not in a while.” Steve finally answers. He flexes his hands on the table to stop himself from reaching for the back of his neck.
He comes, splattering Tony’s mouth with his come. He tastes almost sweet, salty, unlike the bitterness of what they’ve become. Tony swallows around Steve’s dick, keeping his eyes on him the entire time. Steve watches back, removes his cock, and Tony knows that’s next, too. Steve cups his jaw, inspects that Tony’s swallowed all of him down. He smiles, tiny, wistful, and makes an approving sound.
I close my eyes and moan, imagining the sky and how spaceships would fly across galaxies. I pretend Steve’s drawn out groans are the hum of an engine.
People lived their lives knowing that death was inevitable. But Captain America and Iron Man saw the end of the world many times over and survived it each time.
“And you know what happens to people like that?” Samuel adds, stopping just a few feet from Tony holding court. There’s a row of parked bikes perched down the road. Tony’s waving a pipe wrench and show the kids the engine of Samuel’s car. “They say they can’t find the right words, so they say nothing at all. It don’t gotta be like that, pal.”
Maybe he could convince Morgan and Pepper to take him to Saks Fifth someday. He’ll fill out all of the empty spaces in the closet with things that belonged to him.
The serum cured his medical ailments, but it did nothing for a grieving widower. He felt like he’s been trapped in a burning building ever since Tony’s cancer came back. His heart and ribs felt like they were trapped under a concrete. Every breath felt like it was his last.
Steve forced his eyes open as he hammered into Tony. He watched Tony’s fingertips escape from his fucked out mouth. Steve came with a groan and dropped his head to the sofa cushions.
“I’m going to have a word with whoever coined that term and demand they retract it. You’re a sweetheart. A fluffy, gooey, feeling marshmallow. You can wear an iron suit, it can’t hide the fact that you’re a good man. Iron Man, a superhero.”
When he closes his eyes, he sees Kate’s grin and Riri smacking her curls away from her face as she worked on her suit.
He kisses my back and rubs the knots off my shoulders. He is painfully gentle, like he doesn’t want to hurt me. His fingers count my vertebrae. A tap on each one. I shut my eyes and summon a moan when he fucks his come back inside me.
The pain on his hips fester to his lower back, and he sobs as he turns over the thin mattress, biting his lips to stop from screaming.
“Tony. You’re gonna get grease all over the bed sheets. Again.” Steve grumbled about Tony’s dirty clothes almost every other night. But he really didn’t care. It was part of their routine. Bicker about the sheets, argue about who’s turn it was to take out the trash.
“No, no, not without you.” Steve’s used to crying in front of his friends now, so he didn’t try to stifle the sobs erupting from his chest. He kissed Tony. Both their faces were wet with tears. “There’s no life without you.”
He leans against the doorframe, still in the shadows of the hall, and palms his dick. He tries to control his breath, but they pay him no mind. He wishes that it was him instead—imagines himself in Rumiko’s position. Steve would fuck Tony the way he’s begging to be fucked.
They wait a beat, and it’s like standing on the edge of a cliff. Steve doesn’t know what to do. Fall forward or run back. The choice is stifling.
Tony draws a ragged breathe, and tries to center himself at the sudden pause. He hears Steve's labored breathing against his neck, until there’s the sound of his uniform dropping to the floor.
“Rogers,” he greets, wiping the grease on his overalls. His hair is a mess and he smothers the desire to push it back. It doesn’t matter. Steve isn’t here for what they’ve referred to as a check-in.
“Still is.” Tony steps forward, holds the shield with both hands, and keeps his eyes trained on Steve.
There was a flash of light before the clouds started pouring. They walked across Manhattan and paused in the middle of the road, laughing and smiling at each other. It was that moment, Carol said, that she knew she was in love with Rhodes.
“Just jump right into it huh?” His tone is even, but Steve can see the facade slipping. He shrugs, shoulders rising to his ears before quickly dropping.
“Jessica Drew. Our queen, Veranke, decided that this planet is a viable place for us. We were doing a recon mission when we learned of recent deaths. Somehow we figured it would give the townspeople hope. That you all would let us in.  We wanted to learn about you. We studied you all from afar, and then when we observed that there were other supernaturals, Veranke suggested that we take the form of the deceased.”
And now, Steve had to do the work of living the rest of his life without him. Just a memory, a specter that haunted him in the quiet of the nights, a shadow that followed him like a carres. He saw Tony in their kids—in Harley’s crooked smirk, in Morgan’s eyes, in Peter’s earnestness.
It could be like this, Tony thinks. But it won’t be. Tomorrow, they’ll wake up, Steve will get dressed and go underground. Tony knows where they’ll both be and they’ll inevitably fall to punches instead of desperate kisses. The world is like that sometimes. They’re not the poetics of two star-crossed lovers, but they’re not lovers to begin with. Friends, once upon a time. Now, just two people seeking comfort in each other before they say goodbye.
“There are things I need to say,” Tony whispered, anguished. His cheeks felt hot and there was pain on the edges of his eyes. “I know I don’t deserve your friendship.”
Steve unlaced the oxfords with quick, efficient hands, then pried Tony’s pants completely off. Now, Tony stood over him, bare from the waist down, dress shirt rumpled, and tie askew. He looked gorgeous and he was Steve’s.
It’s been shut since the fiasco with Fisk and the blowing of the dam, but from a distance, there’s a slight reflection. Tony steps forward, “What is that — what.”
“The kids, yeah, but you, Steve, you need that too. Someone to help you process this. You can talk to all of us, but it isn’t the same. I think it would help.”
“Where are the kids?” Steve looked up at the ceiling. He has gotten used to pulling them from their projects because they kept passing on messages via JARVIS that they’d just be ‘five more minutes.’
Yet, it’s only now that he realizes that all the motels, the hostels, and park benches that he’s slept in were just places.
He laughs because Steve’s smiling,  dropping his spit on Tony’s parted lips. Yes, spitting in this context is much better. Tony hums, reaching up to thumb Steve’s cheeks. He’s blushing down to his chest. Tony tweaks his nipple, earning a drawn out moan. Steve shifts again, further down, dragging his mouth over Tony’s pecs, twirling the tip of his tongue on Tony’s nipples. Steve looks up, his hair’s a mess, imperfect and Tony loves him. He does. He won’t stop.
“No. I’m tired.” He shook his head, looking away from Natasha and to his children by the docks. “I’m tired of fighting. I hate that everyday is a battle to live. That’s what it was like for Tony in the end. I just… I’m tired, Nat.”
“I missed you last night.” Steve set Tony’s favorite mug in front of him. It was given to them by a gift shop owner in Tennessee after they assisted with disaster relief. “My Red Hot Lover.” Steve read the words from the mug and grinned at Tony.
Maybe he should say it, maybe he should utter these words, see if they mean something to Steve. He wants to, he wants to, but he doesn’t. Tony loses himself in the rhythm of Steve rubbing his warm, lubed fingers over his hole.
I fucked Maya. Or. We’re fucking. Alright. This isn’t a confession, ok. I don’t know. I think you deserve to know. It’s not serious. We can’t have anything resembling normalcy. I’m me. She’s her. Brilliant and still beautiful. A bioterrorist I’ve employed because I need to watch her and make sure she doesn’t do anything stupid. She still wants Extremis. I’m not signing off. We fuck. She thinks she can get me to give her more permission. She’s always disappointed when I say no. She leaves the bed, goes to the kitchen, makes coffee and leaves for the lab. I stay there, boneless and weary of what’s to come.
Maybe it wasn’t right to have his entire life and source of happiness dependent on one man. But the statement was true. Steve was nothing without Tony, his anchor. His dream. Steve’s already lost too much. He buried his father too young, and his mother soon followed. Steve was familiar with loss, but it never got any easier.
Tony chuckles, and the broken sound echoes in the quiet of the room. “I will always want you, Steve. I’m practically programmed for it.”
When will Steve stop spending evenings in their bedroom waiting for Tony to come up from the workshop?
“I didn’t forget,” Tony says. He stares into Steve’s eyes. Blue. An ocean of problems. An ocean to drown in.
Tony has no doubt that Steve will make sure of it, but how can you force a sad person to be happy? It doesn’t come easy, especially to those victims of love. What a stupid, trite thing, and yet.
Steve’s head is tilted, expression changing inch by inch, thawing into something warm, something recognizable. Almost like they’re remembering they’re in love and that they love each other.
Then, he shaved and ran out onto the Compound’s yard, heart in his throat as he stood in awe and nervousness when the spaceship landed to reveal a man he thought he’d never see again.
His children showed up to the workshop one by one. Peter’s first, then Morgan, finally, Harley came crashing through with his bedhead and cowlicks. It’s like seeing Tony all over again.
Bucky barks out a laugh. “Me and Sam are in shorts and Carol is in jeans and a NIN t-shirt over there. It’s us. There’s no need for formality.”
He wanted to tell her the truth—no, he’d never be ready; no one was ever ready to live their lives alone. Tony could come up with hundreds of research articles showing Morgan how humans were social creatures and evolved in community.
“Oh, shut the fuck up, you sick son of a bitch. You’re no better than me. Us. You’re the worst, you’re —”
“This town is cursed. Work of the devil.” Red Wolf leads his horse to the front, whips it, and begins the ride.
“Steve, I know. Hush now, I’ll be okay, you heard them. There’s a high survival rate if they all do their jobs right, which I’m sure they will because I hired them for the Avengers and they are the best.”
As I roll my neck, his face disappears. The bluest eyes that Steve Rogers loves so much are gone and replaced by deep brown ones, inherited from ancestors billions years old. Tony's hair recedes until my head is green and my ears poke out.
He gets the directions to Malibu from someone in the parking lot and takes the freeway until he exits to a long-winding street. From the distance, there’s the Stark Mansion, he’s read about in several spreads. Home. Maybe.
Half the town, shocked and inspired into praying for their deceased, didn’t question their origins. They treated the returnees like messiahs and offered them fruit. Stared at them in awe.
“There wasn’t much use for moving it around. We got a lot of empty rooms these days.” Tony trails off, glancing back at the portrait of the original team roster. “Not staying, huh? Guess I might have to repurpose the room after all.”
It was just for the night. Steve should really learn to stop asking for so much. Just for the night, he repeats to himself, again and again until he can’t hear the subway announcing the next stop.
“But,” he says, knowing that Tony will be up shortly and whining for his cup of coffee. Now, he’s gotta make breakfast for their entire lot.
His fingers itch for the familiar weight of a cigarette, just as Steve decides to place an order for Tony, the doors open, bringing a gush of wind inside.
Steve gripped the edge of his seat before leaning forward to grasp a vine. He ran a fingertip on the leaf. Life kept moving forward. “When’d you get so smart, huh?”
Everyday, Steve wakes up with the chance of dying. But this is what it must be like to kill yourself little by little. Inch by bloody inch. It’s like standing on a cliff, knowing you’ll jump because at the bottom of the precipice might be some form of peace.
Tony lets himself be dragged out. He smells like oil and whiskey, and there’s stains on his two day old shirt.
Tony was  a scientist, but he wasn’t good at measuring the quality of men, especially when the point of analysis was himself. Steve was Tony's point of comparison, and he didn't know where he placed in that grace, always running after the future, measuring his decisions, imperfections, complete fuck ups against Steve's ideals.
There were people of all different ethnicities. A diverse set of languages filled his ears: Arabic, French, British English, Vietnamese. There was assortment of accents. Striking words said in hushed tones, high laughter. There were words dripping in sarcasm, a pointed remark, a yelp from a dog sitting in a tiny carrier beside a lady with a funny, feather hat. People dressed in fashion of different eras, reading books, tapping on their phones, cheering at a baseball game playing from another rider’s portable stereo.
“Are you sure?” Tony asks, a touch hesitant. “How could you have a full house in a small town in the middle of nowhere?”
Steve looked down at his left hand. The multicolored Christmas lights flicker on the vibranium ring. He cleared his throat, nodding over at Bucky and Natasha sitting on the loveseat across from him.
Maybe he already accounted for Steve’s perfect recollection due to the serum. He didn’t know. Steve was learning that it’s unsustainable to live in
He doesn’t know how long they stay there, but their breaths settle. Steve presses his ears on Tony’s chest and listens to Tony’s heartbeat. “Thank you,” he says, grabbing Tony’s wrist and kissing it. When Steve finally raises his head, Tony is asleep and his eyes are wet, possibly from the force of his orgasm.
“No,” He shook his head immediately. They couldn’t take the kids. He didn’t want to be alone. “That’s alright. We’ll manage.”
All it is now is a quiet surprise that fizzles into thin air. Tony couldn’t catch it and hold it between his palms if he tried. Steve is always turning away, and Tony’s always left watching his figure get smaller and smaller as the distance between them expands, so much so that there’s an ocean of problems between them.
At least, when he had missions with the Avengers, Tony gave him the complete run down, asked for his input on strategy, and didn’t bother him with mission reports. “JARVIS will handle it,” Tony said, looking smug. “Just read it over, sign it, and we’ll send it over to SHIELD. God, it’s like you all are still in the dark ages with your paper copies and filing system.”
Sometimes, the answers were never enough, so he’d go off and sit in the balcony of their old, moldy apartment and observe the way people stared at the sky, how they carried themselves, the way their tones would change depending on who they were talking to. He’s tried his best to capture the workings of the city, individual by individual, and all the sketch books studying the city-dwellers are now gone, with his mother’s favorite rosary and bible.
Tony comes, chanting Steve’s name the entire time like a man attending church in devotion. His orgasm hits him hard. It’s a release he didn’t expect tonight and it feels damn good to be battered and fucked and owned by Steve.
Crying made him feel worse. It took ages to settle his heart rate once the tears started. Rage soon followed. It was a never ending cycle of drowning in guilt and wrath.
A blush creeps up Tony’s face, and he reaches for his sunglasses again. Brown orbs are once again hidden.
It’s too much all at once, so Steve steers clear of it and asks, “And how did you meet Kate and Riri?”
He slides the balcony doors open, pats his pockets, and opens the cigarette case. He lights the stick and takes a heavy drag.
“Riri and Kate are calling themselves the Young Avengers,” Tony replies, voice affectionate for a moment, before he glances back down his plate, collecting himself.
“I wasn’t complaining.” Tony hums and circles his arms around Steve’s back. He mouths small kisses on the nape of Steve’s neck. “But we got chickens and you’ve planted the herbs for summer. We have two horses. A goddamn barn, Steve. Next thing I know you’ll be into making tea blends and mixing your own soap.”
“Look, let this be a warning for all those who are lured by the promises of false gods,” Red Wolf says, tips his hat, and they all watch the life bleed from Its eyes.
”All endings happen. That’s life. But the scientist in me wants to argue that’s all relative. Time, death, existence. You don’t go be a genius and know all these things about life and not have an existential crisis. But fearing and waiting for death was just that. I had to accept it even if I didn’t want to. I wish I wasn’t a better man, maybe I’d find a way to fix this. I woke up every morning wondering if it would be my last. Would my organs finally fail? Would I go into cardiac arrest in the middle of the night where you, Steve—where your father, God, would find me with my last breath. I hope that when I die, it’s in your arms, Steve. You know our song. I hope it’s just like that, Steve, with your arms around me. Everything will be fine. This is the hardest thing I’ll ever do—leaving you. It’s the last thing I’ll do.”
Tony might know the averages of his questions. He might be able to spit them out on the drop of a hat, but he isn’t like Steve. He’s not counting the days since he disappeared without the shield, nothing on his back except the snow clinging onto his uniform.
“Thanks, Carol.” He sounded curt even to his own ears. Fuck, he couldn’t help it. Maybe he was just bound to be a miserable asshole now. Grief made people bitter.
Invincible Iron Man who doesn’t take off the suit because without it, he’s nothing. Well, bring me back to the good old days, Cap.
Tony quirks his lips, the smile fleeting. He knows this man, and can tell you about the two small moles right above his belly button and how Steve smiles when Tony licks at the marks. Trails wet kisses until Tony eventually chokes himself on Steve’s cock. The way Steve likes to fuck his face and call Tony pretty and the power it feels to come on Tony’s face.
“Manual labor looks good on you,” Steve easily replies, then balks once his brain catches up because he didn’t mean to sound so honest.
Tony nudged him with a socked foot and dropped to his knees. He grabbed the end of Steve’s t-shirt and pulled it over his head. “Strip and turn around. On your hands and knees.”
Steve stilled, letting his climax wash over him. He opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was Tony’s soft, satisfied smile. They kissed, slow because they had time.
Steve rest a hand on Tony’s hips, pulling their fronts to grind together. Tony grabbed Steve’s arms and pulled him down. Steve went to his knees with ease, running a hand over Tony’s trousers, staring at Tony’s half-filled cock.
He closed his eyes and he saw Steve lying prone on the medical table, uniform ripped down his thighs, bloody shield resting on his chest. Tony, without his helmet, crying.
Skyscrapers loomed against the night sky and he couldn’t help but think that he should be out there. Running missions, enduring a debrief from the fallout of his tenure at SHIELD, or something as simple as flying in the suit.
There’s a mix of maps, framed news articles, wedding photos, and art pieces hanging on the hallway’s walls. Tony’s presence was everywhere in the house. He examined Tony’s schematics of one of the suits and smiled.
Parker and Drew punch and kick a few farmers, but all stop when the one that wears Parker’s face chokes Cassandra Lang.
There's a statue of you in Arlington. Big and looming. If you were alive, you'd probably blush all the way down to your neck. I never told you, but I liked that sight. Of you, red and embarrassed because you can't take a damn compliment, Steve. Just take it, alright. We commissioned a kid, an artist from Brooklyn to complete the sculpture. Found her profile on the local paper. The President wanted to have this French-Swiss artist do an interpretive sculpture of you, with all these broadlines and dull colors. But Jan, Carol, and I vetoed it. The sculpture the kid made  is how the people see you, Steve. Wish you were here to see it too.
Steve was warm, ran too hot, and Tony always pressed closer to him, a moth to flame, orbiting around Steve until he burned.
“Can we keep him? Please? Please?” Morgan interrupts, trying to get their attention once more. She pleads thrice more, pouting and clutching the puppy closer to her chest. She’s a short kid, and she’s got her father’s eyes. “Please?”
Tony flips the shield. The symbol red, white, and blue quickly disappears to show the back of the vibranuium and the brown leather straps. Steve holds his right arm up, watches his fingers, then wrists, then forearms fit perfectly on the clasp. and Tony settles it there.
“Well, honey, I want nothing more than to be held by you,” Steve says, earnest as every time he says his favorite word.
It’s easy. It’s like he’s tiny again, back in Brooklyn, picking fights in alleys and getting his ass kicked. This, he could handle.
“You would have not,” Steve measures out. His feet take him closer to Tony, and when their bodies are only a hair apart, Steve grabs him by the waist and pulls him up. He slides in, unable to wait, groaning at the feeling of Tony all around him.
He bursted through the door, pushing it hard enough to pop a screw out and pull the taped Christmas tinsel from the door. “Why do you have to do that, Tony? You could have gotten seriously hurt!”
“Not true, Steve, not true at all.” Tony pressed against his chest and popped a blueberry into his mouth.
When will he stop searching for Tony across the dinner table? The other end of the table remained empty and without a plate for every breakfast, every dinner. When will he stop searching for Tony’s warm body in the middle of the night? When will he stop padding to the workshop to lure to bed only to remember that the lab has remained empty for the last year?
How many leaves have withered in the fall? How many times has the ocean touched the shore? He doesn’t know.
For Steve, it’s rather complicated. He’s so used to running, and he wonders what home could be like, if one is still able to rebuild it after burning the structures down like a goddamn serial arsonist.
“That’s the problem, you’re doing the same things you did with Tony, and that’s okay, but you have to try new things too.” Bucky stood, patted his shoulder, then padded to the kitchen with a sigh. It sounded like he was making a late lunch for them.
He snorted softly. Natasha always reiterated quotes verbatim in difficult times as if others have already said what they were feeling. He couldn’t capture grief, though. Words were just an approximation of the feeling and if Steve tried, the only way he could describe the loss of his husband would be being torn between wanting to follow him and die too, and then being fucked with grief because his kids needed him.
“Oh, shut up.” Tony opened his mouth as Morgan fed him blueberries. He chewed slowly. “You wanted to punch me in the face. You said, ‘big man in an iron suit, take it off and what are you?’ Now that I think about it, I think you just wanted my clothes off.”
“Christ. You don’t have to sound so earnest about it.” Tony laughed, patting Steve’s thigh. Steve felt the heat of Tony’s hands all the way to his belly.
He pats Brooklyn on the side, and Chopin, jealous as ever, moves from her stable to glare at Steve. He laughs, charmed, before reaching for a carrot and tossing it to her. “Morgan will be home this weekend, so we’ll all go for a ride,” he says, knowing they’ll understand him.
Imogen twisted her legs, trying to get into a comfortable position. It was useless. Group was uncomfortable. They had to dig for their bullet wounds. It’s supposed to be cathartic, but he felt exhausted after every session.
The shower is too hot, but when he twists the knob, it’s too cold, so he settles for the former, hoping that somehow it’ll wash away the sore ache on his neck. There’s a small shampoo bottle and a bar of soap. There’s only one, and it’s already been used by Tony. Steve bites his lip, takes the still wet soap and runs it along his body.
“It’s gonna happen sometime, baby.” Tony huffed, his breath cold on Steve’s neck. “And loving you has been a privilege. It is, Steve. After Afghanistan, I didn’t think I could have this—have love, have a family, have a man who would care for me and weep me. Love. To grow old with you, it’s been a dream, baby. To look at myself in the mirror and see all these wrinkles in this old body and remember that shit, we did it. We loved each other. I love you. You love me. What a life, Steve. It’s been a good life. It still is, baby.”
“I know.” Tony sighs and unbuckles his seatbelt. He presses the window half-way down. There's a set of cows resting on the grass. Steve wants to suggest they see them, make a joke about both of them being city boys, but he doesn’t. It doesn’t feel right.
Maybe, there was a metaphor about the human body recycling its parts for the rest of the world to use. Tony told him that humans are made of stardust and genetic code that evolved then made them what they are—human. They were breakable and filled with tragic hope. Steve may have serum cycling through his veins, but he's always been just a man with a dream. For a long time, that dream came true — he lived so many lives since 1918. But one thing was certain: Steve was a husband to the best man he knew.
“Then what did you mean?” Steve asks. Tony refuses to glance at him, no matter how many times Steve drops his head to catch his eyes. But he doesn’t give up, when the side walk blinks to a stop, he tries to reach for Tony, then shortly stops. “Tony?”
It was time to open the presents. Steve couldn’t postpone it any longer, so he squared his shoulders and turned to Natasha. She’s nursing her second glass of vodka.
Steve looked at Peter. He’s all Tony, from his brown hair, to the sharp descent of his nose. He’d go through puberty soon and there’s no doubt that he’d have Tony’s strong jawline. It’s like his children have all the best parts of Tony Stark.
Psychologists and analysts in SHIELD watch security tapes and note that crossing arms over one’s body as a sign of defense. But Steve didn’t agree with that. He did the same everyday like clockwork. Instead, it felt like he was trying to hug himself, offer his body some sort of comfort, a testament to grounding oneself.
He takes Steve’s face into both of his hands—this, he thinks, this is the way he holds onto the world when all of its infrastructures are about to collapse, when the wild life has run dry, when the candle stops burning.
“I wouldn’t be having fun if you’re the one hurting yourself, though.” He gives a quiet, entertained laugh, and pats Tony’s face, smearing spit and dried paste onto his awaiting mouth. “I promise to take care of you.”
“I didn’t come here to apologize,” Steve finally said. He lied prone, his fingers idly scratching the sheets. He shook his head.
He pried the remaining nail from his forearm. Dried blood flaked on the sink as he dropped it on the counter. He stared at his reflection and saw everything he hated in this world.
It was the only untouched part of the house. Every other corner and crevice of their home reminded him of Tony. Even when Steve closed his eyes, Tony was all he’d see.
She opened the box and looked at the set of knives. She’s been eyeing Natasha’s collection and begged Steve for them. He and Tony have long accepted that their kids were never gonna be average, no matter how much they tried to raise them as normal as possible considering that their parents were Iron Man and Captain America and their godparents were a set of assassins and superheroes themselves.
and the rest of us down. How many times do we have to go over this? I told you earlier—You don’t know the proposed alternative, Steve.” Tony flattens his hands on the counter, trying to control his shaking fingers. They spoke at the Avengers Mansion just hours ago and a trip to memory lane did nothing. They’re barely holding onto the tatters of their friendship. “Do you think it’s easy for me to be on the other side? To be away from you—from all of you?”
Nomad is what he goes by now, and perhaps Natasha is right, he’s gotten too good at running away. Survival might just be an excuse.
Steve leaves it at that. He wants to say more, but he can’t find the words. He’s always been awful at communicating. It’s either bark orders at the team or scream at bullies or talk back to men who think they have authority. That’s on the fly. Those are things that are nearly insignificant to when he actually needs to talk, to fix something.
He urged Steve’s head up so their eyes could meet. Steve was truly gorgeous in all senses, even when he was awful and hurting. Steve was a paradox of emotions: grief and anger, all at once, and Tony could commiserate with the downward tilt of his lips, the shadows on his face. Even in the darkness, Steve's eyes were bright, filled with tears.
“I don’t want to move on. I don’t want to love someone else, Buck. I can’t. I don’t want to forget.” He laughed, the sound broken and pathetic. “I can’t forget. Eidetic memory. I see him every night. Before I close my eyes. When I look at Morgan. See Peter. Hear Harley.”
Steve is turning him onto his back, then covering his body, a hulking mass of sheer strength. He kisses Tony’s bruised cheekbones.
“If dad doesn’t have a bedtime, then why do we?” the kids had asked. “What happened to giving us our autonomy?”
“I dunno,” Tony mumbles, pushing up to face Steve. He almost pouts but drops a kiss to Tony’s left pec instead. “I’m tired. I got a kid. Can’t do that now.
Steve smiled at the arms in his middle. He laced their fingers, staring at their matching wedding bands. Tony rocked his erection on Steve’s back.
“We should get you to medical first, Tony. Romanoff and Barton, too.”  Steve shook his head, heart bursting. Tony took everything to stride, even when he was hurt and upset. Even when he didn’t need to offer Bucky a hand and pull him up. Steve admired him. One day, maybe, he’ll be a man half as good as Tony Stark.
Carol sighed. “What we’re saying is you don’t have to do everything yourself. You don’t just have to manage, you could—”
“No, I want to see your face.” Steve nudges Tony’s hips up, settling a pillow on his lower back. “Let me, please.”
Funny. Two years on the run, all he wanted to do was to return. He never said so, though, the stubborn shit he was. He could have called, written, texted. Could have, could have, could have. But he didn’t because he knew deep in his bones that his conviction was right — that Tony would see his point and back down.
What was the use of this certificate? Tony’s dead. This was nothing but archival material that would probably fall into the hands of a university historian some point in the future.
Rhodes and Pepper were visiting them. They offered Tony a box of Randy’s donuts, flown into New York from Los Angeles. Steve broke off a small piece of the blueberry glaze and offered it to Tony.
The jukebox from the corner is quintessential. It’s the allure of a vintage Western Steve’s never known. It plays a beat, and he recognizes the voice from earlier.
The high immediately dissipates, fading into something hollow, like he’s cracked his ribs, removed his lungs, and there’s nothing left but an empty cavity with his still beating heart. It fucking
As they all finish their task, Steve conjures a list of excuses to speak with Tony, alone. He comes up short, and is unreasonably irritated when Tony leaves the dining room without him in tow.
They all sit in the same exact seats from last night. Country potatoes are passed around, along with a bowl of mixed fruit. Natasha places a piece of toast on his plate and nudges his foot under the table.
He tries and tries and tries to bury the past, how he used to be fucked, how Steve wasn’t always kind, deep inside him. Pushes it down. Tries to rewrite the memories, then fails.
Steve sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face. He was still in his office at the SHIELD facility. Natasha was across the hall, pouring over files on the Winter Soldier with Clint. Steve needed to be alone. He replayed the video again.
Steve laughed, stepping up to walk beside Tony. Life was good. Steve belonged somewhere—to a team, maybe. One thing was certain: he and Tony were friends. They’d lead Avengers together.
meaning he might stay and this might work out. But maybe it’s false hope because is there a world where this won’t end in a huge row, in one of them in prison, or worse, dead?
“No, no. Sorry, I’m being mean aren’t I?” He crosses the room and places the containers on the small circular wooden table. It’s vintage, carved out from pine and crafted locally, if the card on the side of the table is to be believed.
“Men are fools when it comes to love.” Red Wolf nods with a resigned half-smile. “You alright, Stark? You’ve been distracted. Perhaps, a trip to the healer might do you some good?”
“No, you’re —“ Steve pinches the bridge of his nose, then walks to the table with caution. Tony pulls out a chair, sits, and opens the containers. He rummages the paper bag for the plate and utensils. “We can’t keep dancing around this, you know. You have things to say, I know you do.”
Carol told him that in her case, it was after a terrible date after four months of dating Rhodes. The waitress spilled wine on her dress and Rhodes laughed. On the way home, Carol insisted on walking instead of hailing a cab.
Steve returned with a damp washcloth, knelt in front of him, and pressed the towel on his face. Steve ran it over his cheekbones, above his eyelids, and Tony bit his lips to stop a sob from escaping.
Blogs and memoirs detailed that the body’s organs would fail. How they might have to change their loved one’s clothes, how they might urinate on their beds, and not be able to eat anymore. How their loved ones might hallucinate, forget things, become completely different. Everyone’s bodies reacted differently to chemotherapy, but once they reached the end of life and the medicine couldn’t poison any of their cells anymore—because there was nothing left—then, they had to prepare for death.
He tries to offer some truth, forcing himself to look at Tony when he says, “I told you, war changes a person,” he reaches for his pocket. “I take xanax to help.”
Tomorrow he’ll wake up, go for a run, and then maybe Tony will pass by the Mansion and they’ll have a cup of coffee. Maybe Steve might suggest sparring, just for fun, for old times’ sake, because it’s always a good idea to practice, and Steve will pretend he doesn’t know what Tony’s sweat tastes like, or the way his rim twitches as Steve slides out. Steve will pretend to not know how his hole flutters when come drips out, and he’ll pretend that being close to Tony doesn’t affect him.
“Why not?” Tony smiles, wide with teeth. They’re bright under the moonlight. “Do you really have no vices?” He narrows his eyes on Steve, still somewhat playful. “I don't trust a guy without a dark side.”
“Your parents’ death wasn’t an accident. It was an operation by HYDRA. There’s a tape to prove it.” He shoved aside the selfish, fleeting thought to keep this from Tony. But Steve wasn’t that man. “The other thing… The assassin they sent in the mission was my best friend, James Buchanan Barnes. Bucky.” Steve willed himself not to tremble and he loosened his grip on Tony’s wrist. “I’m not sure about the details yet. But he didn’t die when he fell from the train. Somehow, HYDRA got a hold on him.”
But that’s the choice of love, wasn’t it? Knowing that the loss was inevitable, but choosing it anyway. Bullshit, Steve thought.
Bruce is perched on an armchair, a set of papers balancing on his lap and a holo-screen to the side.
He shifts his gaze to Tony’s lower lips. He can’t look into those eyes now. Tony’s already reading him, and he’s likely seeing all the fragmented parts of Steve. Keeping going, soldier, that’s what he’d tell himself. Only now, he’s stuck at this impasse. He wishes they were on the road again. Because at least then, there’s direction. There, he’s got a destination.
Steve hates the glamour of Beverly Hills, the large skyscrapers, then the endless homelessness that surround parts of Santa Monica. He hates, hates, hates. There’s so many things Steve has grown to despise, no longer seeing the world through the bright eyes of wanting to serve his country, do good things in the world. War teaches you that you pull the trigger not for freedom or democracy, but to serve as pawns of men in the Capitol.
,” Tony gasps as he rocks forward, fucking his hard, leaking cock on the sheets. The blue cock ring makes the shape of his heavy balls more pronounced. “Ru, come on, please.”
“But a damn good one,” Tony continues, closing his fists to stop the tremors. The sun is making him feverish again, and he wants nothing more than to cross the street and enter the saloon. “It’s too bad he’s a fool.”
“Oh fuck, I’m coming, yes, Tony, keep going.” Steve lifted his hips as Tony rubbed his prostate. He came in thick spurts inside Tony’s warm mouth. That fucking mouth of his. “Fuck.”
Steve felt cold with grief, walking around his home with all of Tony’s inventions loitering around. He couldn’t even talk to JARVIS without thinking of him.
“If by ex you mean Fury, then no thanks, Tony.” Steve glances down, willing his heart to calm. He’s still in the high of victory with endorphins from the fight.  The left side of his body was sore from the fall he took, but he paid it no mind.
“But you’re happy.” It’s a statement, not a question, and Steve breathes out the words like a heavy refrain.
Tony sighed. “Yes, I know, you love me and care for me and you’d die if I died and all that jazz. But baby, you can’t live with all this fear. I’m fine.”
“Steve didn’t know we were coming over,” Bucky replies, setting the pizzas down before walking up to Tony to shake his hand.
Manhattan was busy on an average day. Millions of people crowd in subways and push each other off on the streets. But since Tuesday evening, the city mourned the loss of Tony Stark. All the major news outlets covered his death while social media erupted with mostly positive descriptions of his life and subsequent death.
“I’m appalled that you’re so nonchalant about this happening on a regular basis.” Steve says, not letting go of Tony’s fingers. He intertwines them, feeling bold and reckless. “You should stop hanging around here.”
Steve walks to Tony, his boots clicking on the tiles. He steps over the dried come from the previous evening and inspects Tony, the way he would when reading documents. “They tell me you didn’t eat or drink anything today. I don’t need that stress weighing me down while I’m at work.”
“Alright, Tony. I promised. Alright.” Steve stared at his fingers. He flexed his hands, open and close, then used the thumb and index figure of his right hand to pry the ring from his left. “I’ll be alright.”
The first lick was madness. Tony knew how Steve liked to have his ass eaten out. But Tony was being infuriatingly slow. “Come on, Tony, faster.”
The bed rocks forward and back with the force of their bodies. Tony's pulling him close, and Steve's grinding his teeth so a sob doesn't escape.
Steve swallows around his dick, pulls off, and spits on Tony’s softening cock with a smirk. He drops to Tony’s side and pulls Tony to his chest. Like old times.
A man with shaggy blond hair comes over, scrubs Tony in the head and offers another line. He’s built like those surfers paddling around the beach in the mornings. Steve could take him—twist his arm and shove him off. While Steve can't hear it due to the bass and the screaming all around him, he can see that they're all laughing. Tony shouldn’t be with them. They have a gleam in their eyes that speak of vultures.
With a heavy sigh, Steve ushered the children to their bedrooms to get ready for the memorial service.
“This is what I mean!” Morgan shakes her tiny fists. “I’m calling Peter. I don’t care if he has to bring Johnny Storm over.”
“I can almost feel your loving arms again.” Steve finished the song and dropped a kiss to Tony’s cheek. He caressed Tony’s jaw, then leaned down to nip at it. “Why’d you get up? You could have waited in the bedroom. I was almost done.”
She was spitfire in that little red dress, slit to the side showing the length of her thigh. The golden thigh bracelet. She rubbed his cock through his slacks that night, teasing, not letting him come.
Still, his heart strings pull whenever she’s home because Tony is immensely happier. His entire face lights up, excitement evident in the pull of his body and the way he laughs. Even Steve is still getting used to the division of their parenting system.
“Nope.” Tony takes the cracked shells and deposits them into the compost bin. Tony makes a face and promptly closes it. “And still can’t remember how you convinced me that you’ll be a farmer now.”
“Well shit,” Tony deadpans, his shoulders shaking for a brief laugh. “We can’t do easy, can we, Rogers?”
“I’m alright. Shower then dinner?” Tony stands and hangs his track jacket over the chair. “Think I can bully Victoria into investing in room service?”
“I’m fine here, Mr. Stark.” Steve sits on the French settee, bare feet cross on the cream-colored ottoman. If it's anyone else, Tony would have booted them out of his home, but this is Steve, and he looks like he belongs here, amongst all of Tony's wild metals, his hodgepodge of books, and imported candleholders.
Tony shudders when Steve removes his fingers. Steve pleads with himself to put an end to this. He should walk away, put his clothes back on, and leave them be.
Half of Tony's body falls forward, but the chains don't let him get far. Steve's dragging his ass back, silently, forcing Tony to fuck his tongue, soothing the tension growing in his stomach.
He really wished that he was still drunk because if he had to look at Steve, he might take the nail gun again and staple his eyes shut.
“Because we’re going to rebuild the world,” Riri and Kate cheer simultaneously, like this is a statement that Tony always makes. The former raises her fists and the latter gestures her hands as a bow and arrow.
“Good morning, beloved.” Tony pawed at Steve's chest and settled on the space under his arms and ribs.
But that might not be true. Steve’s still stubborn, even if the lines on his lips are a little softer, even if his eyebrows aren’t furrowed. They’ll talk in circles just like they did in the Mansion. The fight bleeds out of him, and Tony surrenders to the lull of Steve standing close to him.
He stayed with one knee planted on the concrete. “You told me that the team thought we were secretly married.”
Steve heard her erratic pulse from across the room. It was like he was seeing a reflection of himself.
For a beat, Steve seemed like he was trying to parse out words. His eyes were soft, too forgiving. “Can I walk you?”
He knows all too well that Steve would probably hear his whispers. Steve wishes he had the wall to lean against. To account for his shaking knees, he stands even straighter.
Tony stares at him for a moment, but he soon falls back asleep, head pressed against the belt. Steve smiles, fond, then shifts him so that Tony’s more comfortable.
He had only been awake for 14 months, but he was ready to fall back into the ocean and get this life over with.
The Ricards’ were in and out of town, but Reed promised to run a test on all returnees after he finished work with Banner and Dr. Strange at the Savage Mountains.
There are three words on the tip of Tony’s tongue but he doesn’t do Steve the disservice of uttering them. It’s not enough.
