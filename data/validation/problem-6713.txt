“No, for fuck’s sake,” Clint says, exasperated. “Why would I be jealous of her soulmate? Jesus Christ, Natasha, you know better than
, Toni. Clint nearly had a complete mental breakdown. I had to pry you away from a panicking assassin in order to get your spare reactor into the dock. Two minutes in which I had to argue with your overprotective, unstable soulmate to even
Her punch is quick, instinctive, knee-jerk reactionary. Her gauntlet slams into his face with enough force to break his nose and split his lip. The base of his skull cracks into the floor with enough force to rattle
She forgets the mystery of having a ceiling above her in a heartbeat, and is on her feet without quite planning on moving, reaching out to haul him with a gauntleted hand fisted in the material of his armor back towards her. “Goddammit, Steve,” she says, and leans her forehead against his cheek. “Don’t do that to me. I can’t lose you this soon after finding you.” She swallows hard, and the muscle in his jaw jumps under her temple. “Bucky can’t lose either one of us either.”
Or maybe that’s his actual thought that Tony’s picking up. Either way, he gets the message. He’s the leader here, not Clint.
He returns day after day, finding his way through the twisting labyrinth of the Triskelion’s corridors in the middle of the night, early in the morning, sometimes several times in the course of a few hours. He never stays very long, usually just long enough to clear his head and sit in silence and solitude, but finds his feet bringing him back again and again.
She doesn’t even feel guilty. She should, and it’s just a little worrisome, but she can’t find it in her heart to care too much.
He drops into a dive, arms spread like repulsors are guiding him, attention focused on the blue and white and red of Steve's uniform, trusting anyone in his path who's on his side to get out of his way. As he drops parallel with the deck and levels into horizontal flight again, he gathers his telepathy like a fist and shoves it in a psychic punch at Steve a second before he impacts Steve’s side with his shoulder.
Bucky meets Steve's eyes, reads the question in them as easily as if he'd verbally asked. He shrugs easily. “I'll come too,” he says. “Gimme a sec to change and we’ll start feedin’ Toni some dust.”
A myth, Toni thinks. A popular plot point in terrible novels written by formulaic writers. Hollywood melodrama with little basis in reality, like guns that never run out of bullets and bad guys who drop unconscious with a single punch and vehicles that explode at the slightest bump in the road. The lazy lawyer's defense, sensationalized by that one famous athlete's televised murder trial, the one who beat his wife’s mugger to death.
“... and she gives me this look, like I’d just said the dumbest fuckin’ thing she’d ever heard, and says, ‘I’m not drunk, and I’m not twelve. I’m not calling you
One of the agents -- he still doesn’t know their names -- acquired the building plans from the city archive, and he studies them now, looking for points of entry, weak places in what are no doubt prodigious defenses. Notes the locations of labs and workshops, can puzzle out the technical specs enough to determine which are Stark Industries’ standard R&D and which are the most likely to deal directly with Iron Man and other weapons of world destruction.
Manhattan disappears behind her as she kicks in the afterburners and breaks the speed limit. Clouds whip past her helm, slapping liquid across the faceplate. There’s nothing but water below her, peppered with motorboats and unfurled sails, tourist cruises and private yachts. Muscle memory and long-term behaviour has her  dump height for showy speed. She skims the surface, corkscrews through the spray of a cigarette boat, sees a blur of faces and pointing fingers, the wink of the sun flashing off camera lenses and raised smartphones.
Bucky takes a long breath, releases it through his nose, rubs the back of his neck. "Jesus. Shoulda seen that coming a mile away."
“Jesus Christ,” Toni wheezes, on her back for the thousandth time and twisted in a very uncomfortable pretzel with Clint’s weight pinning her down. Her lungs are somewhere behind her tonsils. “You’re part octopus. How many goddamn limbs do you actually have?”
. I’ll call down and have Rhoda let you through. She’ll direct you from there. I’ll change and meet you in the shop in ten.”
the reason that happened. I understand if you feel that it was still worth it, but from where I’m standing, it doesn’t look anything at all like that.”
“No.” Frigga kept her gaze steady and her expression calm as Odin processed the denial, and his face grew as troubled as a thundercloud.
One of the curators stayed behind to show Steven the second tablet, taking it from the cage and allowing him to sketch.  Steven knew that Loki would be beyond pleased with the sketches, and he could not wait to show his work to his friend.
Lady Oxford was the worst sort of guest, in Steven's opinion.  She dominated the conversation, only allowing her son or Lady Frigga a chance to speak when she asked them a question.  Steven and Loki exchanged miserable glances every once in a while, especially when she launched into a tirade on the dangers of young women showing more than an inch of skin at parties.
“Please be careful,” Sarah said, brushing a stray lock of hair from Steve’s face with gentle fingertips.  “I expect you to return home in one piece, young man.”
“The Egyptians were always carving things like that,” Thor said, with a bored wave, trying to change the subject.
Parker, M>Designation-Guest:  “If you mean I might catch something from you, I agree.”{error:  conflicting definition} {interrupt loop}
“Heron was brilliant,” Tony explained.  “We are still learning things from his treatises on pneumatics and steam power.  And some of his contemporaries wrote about his experiments into the darker uses of science.”
“I will speak with him,” Sif said.  “If you want to be discreet, you need to send them in,” she added, pointing at Steven, Bucky, and Philip.
They set down in a small public airfield to the south of the city, near a cluster of private airfields. Jarvis and Parker set about securing Phoenix to the ground while Tony went off in search of a wagon for hire. He returned with a fairly sturdy vehicle, and they climbed in, leaving Parker in charge of the Phoenix.
Natasha looked like she wanted to follow him, but she stayed in her chair.  She nodded to Wanda, who went in search of the archer.
“For this to work, we must all deal in good faith, and have a common purpose.  And our only purpose should be the protection of innocents from both direct and collateral damages.  The Accords, should they survive in any form, must provide a framework that protects all involved, while acknowledging the mistakes made and find ways to mitigate the risks to the citizens of Earth.”
"Will you be joining Loki, Thor, and my husband at the museum exhibition on Friday evening?" Lady Frigga asked.
Steven sent a slightly panicked look to Philip.  "May I invite my friend Philip?  He's over there skulking about in the shadows."
“Oh, well then.  Guess we’re ready to get started,” he said, clicking his mouse.  “I’ve been studying the documents that King T’Challa and Ms. Romanov were able to secure with respect to the conditioning that Hydra performed on Mr. Barnes.”  He waved the red journal around.  “And I think I might have a possible pathway to a solution.”
“This will be quite helpful,” Hogun said. “If you will excuse me, I will show this to my contacts.” He gave a small bow and left the room.
“Have faith, Steven,” Thor said, patting him on the shoulder.  “Remember that they took two bundles from the ship.  Perhaps your Tony was simply caught.  If he is still alive, we may yet find him.  And Loki.”
It was the barest brush of lips at first, but when Tony sighed, Steve dove in with gusto. Tony had never in his life tasted something so perfect. Hot, wet, and sweet all at once. Steve pulled at him until he was straddling the soldier, running his hands up and down Steve’s back and trying to touch as much as he could. Eventually, Steve pulled back, panting wildly and grinning from ear to ear.
Thor secured a table in a shadowy corner while Loki ordered meat pies and pitchers of ale from the barman.  Philip placed himself where he could see the door, and let Steven cram himself into an awkward corner, well out of harm's way.
“Then so be it,” she had said.  “I will not hide behind you all any longer.  I’ve let you all act as my shield against those I have wronged.  I need to stop.”  And with that, she had left to gather her things.
Steven decided that he would never tire of travelling by airship. He knew that his mother would be both terrified and furious that he had broken his word, but as he watched the world pass beneath the Phoenix, he couldn’t bring himself to worry.
"Nonsense," Lady Frigga said, her mouth set in a straight line.  "You are welcome in our home any time, Loki."
The made the rounds as Loki showed off more of his artifacts, and then exited out into the garden.  The space was lovely, and one of the most beautiful traditional English gardens Steven had seen.  There were a few strange blooms here and there, but mostly it was laid out in a vibrant, but familiar, rainbow.
“Tony,” Clint says with a broad smile, clutching at his throat in exaggerated joy. “We all knew you'd snap one day, but I'm so
She jolts her shoulder as she crashes into the floor, skidding across the slick tile and leaving a wide smear of red behind, and everything goes white and staticky for a bit.
Happiness is earned here. It's hard-won through blood, sweat, tears and pain. It's my opinion that it makes the payoff that much sweeter. I believe in a difference between appropriate drama, even in difficult and uncomfortable sub-plots, and unnecessary angst.
“Go be a boss,” he says, ruthlessly smothering the unease that still curls through him at the reminder of how thoroughly she’s been disrupting her life. “I’m gonna be too busy to entertain you. You may as well find somethin’ to do.”
Tony’s brain screeches to a halt there, and wouldn’t be able to manage registering any more words, but thankfully Steve stops talking and sinks into the chair next to the art box in the corner, freeing him from the need to follow along. A thousand questions instantly jump to the tip of his tongue, notably what chain of events was it precisely that led Steven Rogers, Captain America (and occasionally literal poster boy for high school chastity promises in some of the more backwater places), to even
Steve holds out his arm, frowning. “What do you mean, appropriated?” he asks, as Toni slides the bracer over his hand and fitting it to his forearm. Her fingers are lithe and deft, tightening it until it's snug against his skin. It's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it's obviously only half-finished, and he's worn scratchier things in his life.
“Steve!” she says, laughing and crying and smoothing her hands over his skin. “God, Steve. You’re awake.”
He walks to stand beside her like he hasn’t the slightest worry she’ll repulsor him through a wall, like she isn’t one more piece of bad news away from going nuclear. “I can see that. Can I help with the clean-up? Seems like the very least we can do.”
Tony tells himself, and stops fighting, gives in, decides that he’s okay with it too. He can try to tell himself otherwise, but this has been a long time coming, and even if this isn’t quite the reality he thought it would be once he got Steve back, it’s definitely one he can live with.
He hurries into clothes, ignoring the wet towel that slides from his hips, ignores the fact that he’s still dripping from the shower. He tears the room apart in short order, thinking maybe he put it somewhere else, but it’s nowhere to be found. He stands in the middle of the room for a long moment, anxiety a thump under his lungs, trying to remember the last time he saw it, if he brought it to the beach and somehow left it there, if someone could have crept in and stolen it while he was gone.
Lightning-quick, Toni has her by the throat, slams her onto the desk, and bends over her until their noses are almost touching. “You tell Fury,” she says, soft and calm, “that if what I think happened has actually happened, I will turn all of my extensive resources, genius brain, and
She squeaks as he bends suddenly and hoists her up to sit on the edge of the table, nudges her knees apart and moves between them. “Rather play with you,” he says, carefully threading his fingers into her hair and tilting her head back, eyes dark and warm. He kisses her, slow and languid, and she melts against him. “Missed you this week,” he murmurs into her mouth, licks a slow line over her lips until they part with a little sigh. “Bed was empty without you.”
He just wants to be able to look at himself in the mirror and know who he is. Because right now, he may be Steve Rogers. He may be Captain America. But he no longer has any idea of what that means.
It grows less okay the third day, when Bucky realizes that Toni hasn’t spent more than a consecutive hour with them. He’s been a bit wrapped up in trying to help Steve acclimate to the future to see it before now, but that’s no excuse and he knows it. He should have noticed that she’s quiet and pale, picking at her food and contributing minimal participation in their conversations.
She eases into the conference room and shuts the door behind her. Sets her tablet on the table and takes her coffee to the floor-to-ceiling windows to look out over the city while she savors the hot brew, right to the bottom of the cup.
“With all due respect, sir, I think you’re putting too much stock into Agent Carter’s report. There were extenuating circumstances--”
“If it’s too fast, it’s too fast,” she says, all in a rush. “I just thought, well… you’re doing a lot better now, and with everything that’s happened in the last few days. We can take more time, go over things, make adjustments. I don’t want you to think I’m trying to make you into someone you’re not or someone you’re not comfortable having as your past, or--”
“Hello Phil,” Pepper’s voice curls from the phone to his ear, warm and amused and smoky. “I hear you visited us today. I didn’t warrant a stop?”
He turns fully around, hauls her in by the waist and buries his head in her shoulder, shudders in relief when she loops her arms around his neck. “I’m going to wreck this,” he says into her hair. “Whoever gives out soulmarks really fucked up when they saddled you with me.”
“What are we doing, Toni?” he asks quietly. He isn’t looking at her at all, just staring at his hands resting loosely over his knees. He doesn’t pull away from her, and she doesn’t pull away from him.
“I don’t know,” she says, then resumes the slow, broad strokes up and down his spine. After a few moments, the stiffness starts to melt as he relaxes. “What do you want to do?”
Toni raises an eyebrow questioningly, and Helen points upwards. Toni follows the line of the gesture, to where the observation area is recessed into the upper walls. Clint and Bucky and Steve are visible just over the rails on one side. Coulson and FitzSimmons are standing in the middle, with Carol, Rhodey and Pepper on the other side. “Great,” she says, though she tosses off a jaunty tip of her fingers as a wave. “If only Tash was there. I could get all my disappointed looks with over at once. Wait, why is Pepper here?”
Which, Tony is disgusted to realize, has gone dry as a desert. This is not happening, he tells himself firmly, doing his best to ignore his racing heart and the storm of anxiety suddenly fluttering in his stomach as he wipes his palms that are
Tony’s vision goes spotty and his chest seizes so hard that he briefly worries about arc reactor failure, before he realizes he’s stopped breathing. He gulps in air and types,
“Whatever you need, солнышко,” says Natasha, and her thumbs smooth over Toni’s cheeks. “we are here.”
Some genius tactician he turned out to be. Maybe he should return the shield and hang up the tights.
She flexes her hands against the rope, checking the give, spider-walking her fingers over the coil until she gets to the knot. She frowns as she explores it with her fingertips, mapping the curves and ties in her mind. If she can figure out what knot it is, she can get out of it. On her second pass along the ropes, she blinks. “Oh my god,” she says, scandalized and thoroughly insulted. “I’ve been kidnapped by incompetents. A handcuff knot? Are you freaking kidding me? A
Behind them, the quaint picturesque hunting lodge they’d rented for her birthday, cosy and romantic before it was riddled with bullet holes and broken walls and bloodstains, burns to the ground.
She had never been there, of course, only saw it through the distancing filters of projections and educational materials, but she knew it should not be cold and quiet. Shadowy, perhaps, and smoky, because it was the home of darkness, but never cold and quiet. Mother’s lessons told her that more than three hundred dwarves should live there, that it should be loud with the ringing of anvils and the shouted conversation of the smiths at work. There should be hot metal and sparks spilling from workstations. A seething, rhythmic pulse thrumming through her bones as dwarves pounded steel and quenched molten metals.
Thor patted him on the shoulder and then pushed him back into the main space.  Loki had emerged from the scroll room, and was chatting with an older gentleman.  Steven glanced around, but found no sign of Tony or his friend.
“Do you know much about computers, Captain?” Samson asked.  Steve shrugged.  “It’s an imperfect metaphor in this case, but until you all acquire both neuroscience and psychiatry degrees, this is the best I can come up with,” Samson said.
Now she sat with her back against a crate, staring down at her hands as they glowed red.  She had worked so hard to learn control, but she still had a ways to go.  In retrospect, she should never have been in the field in Lagos, or Leipzig for that matter.  It was these times that he felt Coulson’s absence like a missing limb.  Behind his mild manners was a man who knew how to build a team.  He would have been so much better at reining in Cap and Tony.
The man sighed.  "That is unfortunate," he said, and took another puff.  Already his mind had moved beyond listening to Rahul chatter, and on to planning the trip to England.  He had to find a fast airship headed to Europe, as quickly as possible.  He would have to stop in Paris, and pick up a couple of his associates, as well.  He could never move about in London as easily as he wished.  They would have to be his eyes and ears.  He returned to the one-sided conversation when Rahul mentioned payment for his services.
"Steve, you know you’re not allowed on Etsy without adult supervision," he said. After the whole deal with Darcy and the link to the red, white and blue glass dildo, they had decided as a team to forbid Steve from the site. Safe search could only do so much, and no one wanted to see how the super soldier serum stood up to heart attacks.
T’Challa watched the fighters in the sacred circle.  The two women circled one another, with weapons drawn.  They were fighting to join the Dora Milaje, the deadly personal bodyguards of the King of Wakanda.  Since his father’s death, T’Challa had been dealing with unrest in his kingdom.  By opening up the ranks to young women from all of the tribes, he hoped to build a coalition that would enable him to keep the peace and help Wakanda prosper.
Two days into their sea voyage, he had found himself staring at one of the stewards who came by to check on their rooms.  After a few hesitant discussions, Steven found out that the boy's name was John, and that he'd been at sea for nearly six years.  Steven made sure that he was in the cabin during John's rounds, and that had many a companionable chat while John replaced the bed linens and checked the lavatory.  Steven had a horrible feeling deep down in his gut as to why he enjoyed talking to John(laughing brown eyes, bright smile), but he thought he'd kept it well hidden.  Apparently not.
“Not exactly,” she explained.  “It is more of a combination of that and a gentlemen’s club.  Not all of their hostesses are in the trade.  Some are merely decoration.  Some have...well, other talents”.
There was no doubt that his plan was solid, but T’Challa hated that so much of it hinged on the ethics of people who had shown no qualms in shutting the others away with no trial and no hope of reprieve.  But it was a chance they would have to take, for all of their sakes.
"Everything went well?" Lady Frigga asked, settling her husband and son on either side of her on the settee.
"This Saturday," Tony said.  "I am going to an exhibition with Mr. Banner on Friday night, and I can bring my things over on Saturday.  Then I can leave right after the show."
He departed to his friends’ laughter.  He dodged around a group of middle-aged wives and re-entered the small exhibition room.  He found two of the curators discussing the tablets in question with a third man, an obviously wealthy patron.  One of the curators had unlocked the iron cage in which the tablet resided, and removed it to a small table.  The other was pointing out notable features, even going so far as to flip it on its back to show more markings.
Steven took his hand after a slight hesitation.  "Pleased to make your acquaintance," he said.  "My name is Steven."
“Yes they are with Stark.  At Laura’s request,” Phil said.  He took advantage of the shock.  “She rightly assumed that the safest place on the continent that wasn’t a SHIELD base was with Tony.”
“Taking a version of Extremis that Helen and I modified and letting it work it’s techno-magic on your spine,” Tony said, an excited grin on his face.
“I am not afraid of them,” Steven whispered back.  He tried to move again, but Tony’s hands were strong.
He was weak, that’s why.  Weak enough to let his fear get the better of him.  Weak enough to be turned by Loki.  Weak enough to wake up every night to nightmares about Coulson’s death.  The agents he had killed.  Nightmares where Loki had forced him to hurt Laura and the kids.  He’d been under Loki’s control for days; he could barely imagine what Barnes had gone through, having to relive the memories of decades of being forced to hurt good people.
The engine room itself was a mess already. Whoever was in charge of maintaining the machinery was obviously an idiot. Really, it was a miracle the thing managed to get off of the ground at all. It would not take Tony long to render it dead on the ground.
"New York?  How delightful," Loki said.  "You must tell us all about it.  I hear they have airships larger than any we've constructed here.  Is everything steam-powered there?  Have you visited other places in your nation?    Have you had lunch?"
<Friday: Sensors Active:  Stark Manor>>Kitchen> <occupants:  Stark, T.; Parker, M.; Parker, P.> <new occupant: Barton, L.>
Steven followed him and they stood on either side of the entrance to the bridge.  Two men were checking gauges and levers on the console, oblivious to the intruders.  A table with maps and charts stood to one side, with a large map hung on the wall, with pins stuck into it.  It seemed to be of the Mediterranean.  There was a large pin in Egypt, and several in the small islands that dotted the waters between Italy, Greece, and Northern Africa.  Steven did his best to memorize the positions, though he could not say why it seemed so important.  In the corner of the map was a symbol.  A grinning skull with six swerving lines beneath it.  It unsettled him to his bones.  If this map mattered to these men, it was important.
He doesn’t even try to feel anything but resigned when his aimless sketches start turning into a portrait of Toni, frazzled and with her hands in her hair. He’s given up trying to stop drawing her.
They both roll to their feet, Toni blowing a puff of breath upwards to shift a loose lock of hair out of her face. Steve is so graceful she’s rabidly jealous on principle, barely landing on the floor before he back-rolls over his shoulder and into a crouch. She shifts her stance from left forward to right, arms tucked tight to her sides. For a long moment, she stares at him, and he stares back.
“Yeah.” He takes a final look at the skyline, gives himself just one more minute to feel worry and concern and frail, fragile hope. Then, with all the ruthlessness gained from his time as the Asset, he starts locking it all down, compartmentalizing, letting it chill and freeze until it's time to thaw it out again. He's aware it's likely not the healthiest coping technique, but he's got nothing else and besides, he's going for efficiency, not style.
A drone drops out of the sky above her, spitting bullets in her direction. She rolls right in a tight spin, blurting an involuntary “Whoa!” at the suddenness of the attack. Training rounds or not, they’ll still bruise if they hit her. “Oh ho,” she chortles, eyes narrowing as the HUD matrices lock onto the drone and three of its buddies still in cloud cover. “So you’re going to be like that, are you kid? Fine. We’ll play rough.”
They return banged to hell and freshly bandaged, but smug and self-satisfied as they both dump a double handful of thumb drives on the table in front of him. He arches an eyebrow, hastily covering his coffee when it looks like one’s going to take a dunk in his brew, and then gingerly pushes it out of range of the cup. “Am I going to see a story in the papers tomorrow about two mysterious Robin Hoods who robbed from the Staples to give to the billionaire?”
when her feet hit the floor. She stands with a groan, stretches and snarls when her spine pops in several places. “Jesus, I’m getting too old for this.”
He reaches up, yanks her down into his lap, cuts off her babbling with a lazy kiss, kisses her til the tension in her shoulders and throbbing through their soulmark goes soft and pliant.
“We’re just that special,” Toni says, and ducks as the windshield in front her shatters outwards, the gunshot echoing a second later. “Now, would you mind getting that last car, honeybunch, before one of us ends up with a bullet hole?”
Bucky would like nothing more than to gear up and go find the nearest fully-staffed Hydra base, and lay waste to every brick, every circuit, every piece of flesh and bone he can find inside the walls. That isn’t an option at the moment, so he just stands, and holds her, until she cries herself out. When her breathing changes from hitching inhales to smooth, even breaths, he gets his legs under him and lifts her up in a bridal carry. He can’t run, he can’t go destroy things, so he’s just left with what he can do here and now. Which is… what, exactly?
There’s a moment where he just looks at her, and then nearly smothers her in a crushing hug. “Don’t do that to me again,” he says, muffled in her shoulder. “Scared the shit out of me. I love you, moron.”
If he didn’t know better, Tony’d swear Steve is giving him the once-over right now. “I noticed,” he murmurs, eyes fixated on Tony’s mouth.
So toss me a comment and let me know: more plot forwarding in the next chapter, or make room for the smut?
? “I uh... I... I did something I didn’t mean to do, and I could really use your help in undoing it?”
“Okay, Stark,” she says to herself, shaking back her hair and squaring her shoulders. “You once convinced an entire roster of calendar models to join you and Barton in defacing an Italian landmark with booze and nudity. You can convince a room full of the people who know you the best that you are perfectly business as usual.”
sleep,” she adds when Toni opens her mouth, flint-eyed, “because he is exhausted and you are a trainwreck. There will be
She bucks violently, and he goes flying off, landing with a crash and a distinct sort of ringing that pierces the haze of
“You’re a good kid, J. Please.” She sits in her chair, kicks her feet up on the desk and slouches back, closing her eyes. “Wake me when she gets here.” Six minutes is a perfectly reasonable timeframe in which to catch a micro-nap.
“Alright,” he says, and leans his head against the back of the chair. “Let’s see if we can unjumble it a bit. Ask me something.”
She snarls in frustration and hauls herself off the couch, wants to stop herself from pacing like a caged lion but can’t. “God, what the hell did I ever do to deserve you? Jesus, Rhodey. Periods are like, supposed to be a magic button girls get to press when they want guys to shut up and stop talking. Fuck women’s lib. It ruins everything.”
He breaks off, clears his throat, rubs his forehead with one hand, bridges that hand over his nose and squeezes his eyes with thumb and middle finger. Looks suddenly as wrecked as Bucky feels. “Shit. Sorry,” he mumbles. “Got sidetracked. Where was I?”
He stalks towards her, and she thinks the controlled rage might be just a bit more intimidating than the insane fury. “That’s fine,” he snarls. “I’ll find it eventually. I don’t need it to tear you apart. It would just be faster.”
The fires go practically silver-white in their heat, and he grunts, strangled and pained, as Carol’s arms close around him with enough force to dent the Iron Man armor, were he wearing it. But Kobik yells in sudden shock and pain, charring lines fade into being above the mob’s collective heads, and sift into ash that disappears as quickly as it showed up.
“No. It means a hell of a lot.” Clint lifts his head, finishes his water, watches Tony the whole time. “You need a place to crash?”
He dreams of red stars and blue circles and white triangles. He dreams of pain and suffering, terror and rage, despair and emptiness.
“Uh oh,” Toni says, and can’t stop grinning. “I’m in for it now. Ow! Hey!” She rubs the stinging spot on her collarbone where Helen just ripped one of the electrode pads off her skin. “Sadist,” she mutters with a glare.
He wants to know about Peggy? Well, she’ll fucking give him all the answers he ever wanted, and hope that’s enough to hold him until someone comes to save her ass.
Because he certainly would never picture Steve sans uniform shirt, with a goddamn Hydra logo painted in black on his bare chest, kneeling in subservience to the fucking Red Skull.
Clint eyes him, then smirks. He steps back a pace, pulling the balcony door wider. “Get in before someone has the brilliant idea to take potshots at the flaming turkey in the sky,” he says.
“I wish you could stay,” Steve says, pushes out from his Bucky-shaped blanket, and sits up with the actual blanket puddling in his lap. He looks down and twists his hands around each other, Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallows convulsively. “I don’t know what I’m going to do without you.”
And Toni had given it without hesitation. She, who cherishes Clint above all other relationships, had been
The corner of his lips curve into a smile. “Good.” And his mouth slants down over hers, nipping at her bottom lip. Toni melts into it, forgetting her arms are noodles and bringing them around his shoulders, threading her fingers through his hair. He’s sweaty, but so is she, and it should be gross, but it isn’t.
Natasha clucks, and her arm goes around Toni’s shoulders to help her, sliding pillows under Toni’s back to prop her up. “тупица,” she says, disapproving.“I have no idea how you’ve managed to survive for over thirty years without someone putting you in a padded room for your own safety. Have you ever gone more than a few days without injuring yourself?”
Bucky’s fist slams into Clint’s face, knocking him back on his ass. Later, he knows he’ll be grateful that it was his real hand, not the metal one, because Toni would be furious with him if he inadvertently kills Clint, but right now, he just wants him to
“...am going to stop trying to figure out what the fuck is going on, because I need my brain to figure out how the fuck I’m getting out of here.”
“Well,” Toni says, gasping in relief as she leans back. She closes her eyes and wipes her forehead with a shaking hand. “There was that one time Clint tied me to the bed for three days. I didn’t get a single scratch.”
If he doesn’t look at the chair, he’s okay. “Humility and modesty are some of your best features,” he says with a smirk, turns his back to the chair and tries to cross his arms before he remembers that one of them isn’t working at the moment.
There never was a second Project Rebirth. He is not the second Captain America. He is the first and only Captain America. He was not married to Peggy. Peggy was not killed by Iron Man. He did crash a plane into the ice, and he slept in ice for over 70 years.
Toni reaches down, tucks the blanket more securely around him, and smirks. “Nah. I’ve always heard, ‘if you love something, let it go. If it bounces, it’s a wizard. If it’s road pizza, it was never meant to be’.”
“Steve still out?” she asks absently, hyperfocused on the three still-red items. The tertiary weapons guidance systems she might be able to skate without for the suit’s first flight, but the redundant flight stabilizers and the secondary communications functions are too important for her to half-ass. Knowing her luck, if she blasted off without them, she’d stall out somewhere over the Pacific and have no way to flag down a ride home.
Phil considers it, God help him. Barnes, Rogers and Stark are all heavy hitters, and he could really use them right now. “Let’s keep that in reserve, JARVIS,” he says. “They have seventy-two hours, so let them enjoy as much as they can of it.”
Belatedly realizing he can probably feel her embarrassment through the bond, she snaps her jaw shut and shuffles her feet. Her hand settles on Steve’s hip, and she charges the static lock on that gauntlet. Just in case. In the next second, they’re airborne, rocketing into the sky, and Steve’s whoop of sheer delight rings in her ears like silver bells.
“Appreciate it,” Tony murmurs, and the flames die when his feet touch down on Clint's balcony. “But Flaming Turkey is my porn name. I was young and needed the money.” He shakes his sleeves out as the Phoenix armor fades into the jeans and jacket he put on earlier that morning. “Got anything to drink?”
“I love you too, honey,” Clint says from above her, and she glances up to see him sliding back the cover of the vent. She doesn't even ask, because she's long since learned that if there is a vent, Clint will explore it. His head disappears, to be replaced by his feet, and he drops down on top of the desk, and hops to the floor. He bends down to kiss her, then pulls a lint roller out of his pocket and starts running it over his sober, black jacket. His eyes never leave hers, and his contented little smile never drops.
God, it’s all catching up to her now, and she sags drunkenly before forcing her knees to straighten. “So what?” she snarls, but most of her fire is out. It’s a fraction of her previous conviction. “I’m not just going to sit on my ass and twiddle my thumbs while we wait!”
He learns to never hand Toni things, because someone somewhere damaged her ability to trust enough to reach out and take an item from another hand. He learns that, if he’s holding something she needs or that he wants to give her, he should lay it down beside her and let her pick it up.
He manages to extract himself from the market, making his way back to the parking lot where Hogan, the driver JARVIS was kind enough to hire for him, waits with the windows down and the top rolled back.
way, and Tony’s mouth goes into overdrive, “and I probably ended up copying part of myself in there, had to, because—
Toni is bent over his new arm on the bench beside the chair, doing her final checks and making sure that the SHIELD agents that ferried it and the rest of Toni's very long, long list of equipment from the Manor didn't fuck it up. The team is vouched for by Coulson, but Toni isn't taking any chances. Bucky can't blame her. Even though it's been the same four agents moving boxes and machines, making more than a dozen trips back and forth under the flinty, watchful gazes of Black Widow and Hawkeye, Bucky doesn't trust any of them to play things straight.
The world goes very, very quiet, except for a loud ringing in her ears, and a deep, abiding fury that builds and builds and builds in her chest until it feels like she’s going to explode. That’s when Bucky practically breaks the door down, stalking in and demanding to know why Toni’s so upset he can feel it from three floors away.
“Scanning for damage now, ma’am,” JARVIS says suddenly, and it’s a little jolting to realize how long she’s been in the suit without bantering with her co-pilot.
“Look,” he says tiredly, and turns away from Carol to stare out the window, one forearm supporting his lean against the glass, “I'm just here to talk, Carol. You wanna fight, we can do that. You can go all pissed off war goddess, I can go all pissed off cosmic firebird. We slug it out, set some streets on fire, break a few buildings, ruin a few hundred lives. Or we can just fucking
As he approaches the kitchen, he hears voices coming from it and pulls up short. Just for a second, he doesn’t know who they are, starts reaching for a knife that he no longer carries, and then squeezes his eyes shut. He’s not going to lose it now,
By the time Natasha helps her back out of the tub, Toni’s hair is clean and her skin is pink and the heat from the water has seeped all the way down to her bones. She’s practically asleep already as Natasha braids her wet hair and ties it away from her face, but manages to rouse herself enough to dress in an oversized t-shirt and a pair of comfortable pajama pants.
Just the thought of standing up is exhausting enough. Toni groans and sinks into the pillows. “No,” she mutters, and pulls the sheet over her head. “I’m happy stinking. Go away and let me sleep, Tash. I’m injured. I need rest.”
But Toni censors herself far more often than he does. His mouth moves too fast for his brain to catch, whereas her mouth happens to be able to keep up with her brain. He knows there's things she doesn't say sometimes, or things she words more carefully than she thought them. She only speaks the raw, unrefined content of her thoughts when she's under the influence of something. Booze, normally, even if she needs to get into a state of rip-roaring drunk she rarely ever has. But pain meds, he's found out far too frequently for his liking recently, have the same effect on her self-censorship. Toni says exactly what she's thinking, without stopping to pretty it up or tone it down.
Fitz lives under a charmed star. It’s the only explanation he has for how he got from tinkering in his basement in Aberdeen to the top of New York City in Stark Tower’s bleeding-edge workshops, with state-of-the-art everything and the hands-down best coffee he’s ever tasted. He’s a kid in a sweets shop. No, better: he’s a budding mad scientist in a top-notch lab with an unlimited budget and a partner who slots neatly into his life, one carbon atom to another.
This is such a bad idea. Why did he agree to this again? Right, because Steve has SHIELD and Hydra and God knows what else at his back. “Okay, now someone who isn’t Parker say something before that’s the line we close out this war planning session on.”
and makes a few notes, flips pages back and forth, asks him more questions with answers that just make Peggy more upset. Finally, Fennhoff clears his throat, settles his face into a professional mask, polite and sympathetic, and says, “Well, Captain Rogers, it appears you’re suffering from retrograde amnesia.”
Logic isn’t playing in this ballgame, though; it’s ceded the field to fear and lizard instinct, both of which are screaming warnings of his imminent death at him. He races for the door of the Citadel, praying like he’s never prayed before that Uatu is in the mood for visitors and knowing that he’ll never make it before his lungs force him to inhale, whether he likes it or not.
The HUD screams data at her, calculating trajectory, likely landing zones, intercept points, wind speed. She ignores it all, practically
“Hey guys,” comes Clint’s voice from the door beside them, “there was a lot of screaming and things slamming around and
“Yes, ma’am. Shall I also upgrade the others’ permissions to levels more appropriate to their new roles as Avengers?”
Toni’s eyebrows are up, and so is her wariness, but she trusts Coulson. Which is still something of a shock to her, but she can’t argue with the empirical data gathered over the last week or so. “Alright. I’ll entertain the notion. When do I get to meet them?”
Behind his back, with bullets pinging off her armor and more agents with guns spilling out of van one, she breaks the seal on her right gauntlet, pulls it off. “Hand,” she says, and unclips the repulsor array from its seating.
He directs her high, up into the clouds for cover, and she follows without question. Her HUD overlays a map of the terrain below, a blinking red dot tracking the location of the SHIELD vehicle in realtime.
She has her own workshop in the house, but she doesn’t use it for anything but rudimentary devices, copies of Howard's tech. Her sketchbooks are filled with innovations and groundbreaking theories. She has theoretically miniaturized the first arc reactor, the big one in the reception area of the Stark Industries building, the one Howard is
She sucks in a breath, lets it out slow and steady through her nose. “James,” she says, in the same tone she used when he woke up the first day and tried to kill her, the calm and careful one. “I don’t think you’re yourself right now.”
The armor’s always been heavy, and she expects that it might have been more difficult than she’s used to, with being out of commission for so long. But it feels barely more than a set of clothing as she gradually goes through the mental checklist of movements. The new alloy performs like a dream, light and flexible and sturdy, and she doesn’t resist the urge to dance a little.
“Daddy?” she asked.  She bolted from her chair and flung herself at Clint.  He picked her up and held her tight, and Phil could see the tears on his cheeks.
“That’s preposterous,” Steven said.  “You have no idea what you’re talking about.  Such things are illegal.  You can be hung for that back home.   My mother would not be able to live with such shame.  And... and...  my priest says it is unnatural!”
None of the others would really get it, though Natasha probably came closest.  Steve just saw his friend.  Sam saw a way to help Steve.  Wanda saw a way out.  Clint, well, he got it.  He understood what it was like to be a tool.  To be used against others.  He knew what recovery from something like that should look like, even if it was because his own hadn’t.
“They are amenable to many of the changes that Mr. Stark suggested prior to the events in Germany,” the king said.  “Especially that of making sure that enhanced individuals have representation on the committee.”
“Steven, that’s Lady Ward.  She’s looking at you because her husband is seventy years old and half your size.  She’s much less worried about the cut of your jacket than what’s underneath it,” Loki said, a smirk dancing over his lips.
"And until then, we'll have tea and cakes," Loki said with a warm smile, deftly changing the subject.
The other two men were introduced as Fandral and Hogun, and Thor embraced them as brothers as well. When he winced at Volstagg’s clap on his shoulder, they all frowned at their friend.
“Difficult.  I understand,” T’Challa said.  “But this is the path you have chosen.  We simply have to get through it, and hope that we can reforge ties and repair trust.”
Tony waited for Vision to hand out copies of the documents that they had prepared.  Unwilling to trust even Mrs. Arbogast with the task, Tony had dragged Rhodey and Vision to a Kinko’s at three in the morning to print, copy, and collate the documents.  The kid behind the counter had been ready to post a picture of the improbable trio on Instagram, but Tony had forked over a wad of cash to get him to at least wait until he was done at the U.N.  Now, Vision was acting as a teacher’s aid, passing out the study lesson for the room full of delegates.
And now Tony was here with that other man.  A man, Steven had to admit, who was handsome, and seemed quite protective of Tony.  A man who spoke as if he came from an educated family, at least, and possibly one of some circumstance.  A man who hadn’t appeared to be concerned with Tony’s activities.  Someone Tony could talk to and be honest with.  Steven closed his eyes and banged his head against the wall.
“And all of Father’s works will be burned to the ground.  You will find out who allowed this to happen, and they will be brought before me for a reckoning when I return.  Do not fail me on this, or perhaps I need a new Captain,” he said.  He loved his sister, but she was not Queen of Wakanda.  It would not hurt for her to be reminded of that.
"Yes, sahib," Rahul said, settling down on the cushion.  "I have spoken with foreman of the dig crew.  He says they have packed the tablet up and taken it to England to put in some museum."
Thank you all for the support and love.  I have to admit, it's been hard to keep going when I read some of the vitriol directed at some of the characters in the comments.  I've stated before, none of these guys are villains.  Both sides, even though they may have made some bad decisions, have valid points.  I'm a huge Stony shipper, and I love both Steve and Tony individually as characters.  All of the comments made in the fic, by our main characters or by secondary characters, are meant to convey individual perspectives of citizens in this world, and I can say that as the author, I don't always agree with those perspectives, even those who are on 'Team Iron Man'.  So I hope you keep enjoying the fic, but be warned that every character is going to have to face their mistakes at some point.  I'm not doing this to vent my anger at Team Cap.  I'm trying to take where we were left at the end of Civil War, and help those characters find some resolution.
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man:  “Ow!  Stop hitting me.  I am well aware of that and eminently grateful, Mrs. Parker.  I, however, cannot control what these assholes print.”
"Had you worked faster, I could have caught the shipment before it left Egypt," the man said.  "Now I have to finance a trip to England.  One half."
He clicked on a tweet that led him to a forum for people affected by the actions of enhanced ‘heroes’.  he was gratified to find a whole thread dedicated to talking about the good that he, personally, had been able to do.  One woman had dressed her youngest child as Falcon, complete with wings and everything.  He grinned as he clicked the bookmark button.
“And intelligent,” Steven said, miserably.  “And he did not laugh at me for being so clumsy and awkward.”  And he had felt so close to him.  It hurt to think about it.
Sands interrupted them with another visitor.  "My lady, Lady Oxford and her son, Baron Hammer are here to see you."
“Yes sir,” Captain Rogers said, taking a deep breath and squaring his shoulders.  “If you’ll help, I think we’re all ready to start making things right.”
“That’s good,” the captain said.  “Have you heard anything from Tony’s camp?”  Vision thought that the worry sounded sincere, but then again, the Captain had proven himself quite the actor.
She regarded him for several long moments before stepping back to him and throwing her arms around his neck.
“Every minute of every day, Bruce has to think about accountability.  He doesn’t get a vacation.  He doesn’t get down time.  He has to be vigilant every moment,” Tony explained.  “After Johannesburg, I thought I was going to walk in on him trying to find a way to end it.  He’d tried a gun before, did I ever tell you that?   Big Green spit out the bullet.”
Barton, L. >Designation-Boss Lady:  “So the answer to who will notice if you two slip out for coffee is everyone.  Great.  May, do we really need to respond to this?  Surely your reputation can handle a few slings and arrow.”
Unwilling to trust anyone but the men to his immediate left and right, Tony had been doing some ‘fact-finding’ of his own.  Being blindsided about his parents’ deaths had forced him to take a closer look at the data Natasha had dumped from S.H.I.E.L.D.  Plus, he’d managed to salvage some information from the remains of Camp Lehigh that now sat on his own private servers.  He’d found some interesting information, facts that might have changed how he approached the whole Accords mess in the first place.
Steven’s eyes flew open.  “I don’t know what you mean?” Steven said, barely able to keep from shrieking.
"I just want to go on record as saying I don’t want to discuss Stark and women’s underwear in any way, shape, form or fashion," Clint added, following on his partner’s heels. He stopped behind Tony to look at the screen. "THOR! Come in here! You have to see this," Clint yelled.
In the far corner, two men stood in front of a tablet, one making quick sketches and the other one explaining something with quick gestures.  Steven gasped as he recognized the second man.  He knew the worn hands and the strong shoulders because he had first seen them in this very museum.  It was Tony.
Thor introduced Steven to his father, Odin, who was nearly as warm as Lady Frigga in his greeting.  He launched into a discussion of the Egyptian exhibit, and was earnest in his entreaties for Steven to join them.  The discussion turned to science and history, and Steven's travels.  It was quite obvious that Lady Oxford was unhappy to have the conversation moved from her list of approved topics, but she managed a stilted smile, nonetheless.  It was soon apparent, however, that the shift would speed up her departure, much to Steven and Loki's relief.
“Yes you are,” Thor said.  “And it is most unattractive.  Steven agrees.  Don’t you?”  Thor looked over at Steven with a teasing glint in his eye.
“Now, the human brain’s operating state is different at different times.  Our brain while we sleep functions differently than when we are awake.  The functional state when the brain is comatose is different still.  Different areas are ‘awake’ if you will.”
John H. had lost his car in the Battle of New York.  He and his family had been visiting the city for his daughter’s tenth birthday, and Hulk had used their family sedan to take out a Chitauri sleigh.  Geico didn’t cover acts of large green rage monsters, so John was having to work an extra job to help replace the car.  He missed being able to tuck his kids in at night, but there were just things you had to do.
Steven hurried to Thor’s side.  His friend had struggled up to a sitting position, cradling his left arm to his body.
“Will miracles never cease?” T’Challa said, unwinding himself from his meditative pose.  “So what do you plan to do about it?”
"Since school.  My father could afford to send me to the best schools, but he didn't have enough money to make people forget I'm the son of a tradesman," Loki said, with a pained chuckle.  "But Thor didn't seem to mind.  We've been friends ever since."
The frown on Sarah’s face belied her thoughts on Bucky’s likely influence.  “James Buchanan Barnes, if I hear that you have been leading my boy astray…”  The threat was unspoken, but no less terrifying.
Cap was an amazing strategist on the field, but sometimes he let the mission goals overshadow his common sense.  And Tony, while he was a big picture guy, had a hard time communicating his concerns without alienating his teammates.  He’d been keeping people at a distance for so long that it was second nature; Clint wasn’t sure that he even realized he was doing it.  It was almost painful looking at his confused face when people took something he meant as a joke and based their reactions as if he actually meant what he was saying.  Tony could be a dick, but he was rarely hurtful on purpose or without provocation.
“What?  Why?” Captain Rogers asked.  His eyebrows were drawn together in what seemed like concern.  His jaw clenched.  Interesting.
<Friday: Sensors Active:  Stark Manor>>Kitchen> <occupants:  Stark, T.; Parker, M> <new occupant: Parker, P>
“Perhaps,” Thor said.  “But perhaps not.  I think you should speak with him, away from all of this.  Away from his family and your Philip.  You don’t seem like a bad judge of character, Steven.  I mean, look who you’ve befriended!”  He gestured to himself with a wave of his hand and a gave Steven a beaming grin.
“Mr. Borson’s family has been most generous,” the curator said, frowning.  “Very well, you may stand over there and sketch while we finish showing the tablet to Lord Oxford.”
His mother had bid them farewell at the docks as they boarded a steamship for London, England.  She wept openly, and Steven had to swallow down his own tears at leaving her to manage on her own.  His sense of duty to his mother made him question his selfish wants, but the excitement at seeing the world would not let him offer to stay.
They waited until the men had exited down the ramp to drop down the ladder.  Hogun motioned them forward until they could see outside.  The two bundles were unceremoniously dumped into the back of a wagon, and once the guards had climbed aboard, were driven off into the night.  Thor pushed his way to the ship entrance, but Steven held him back.
Breakfast was a scattered affair the next morning. Steven saw a brief glimpse of Tony as he made his way in for coffee, but the engineer left without saying a word. Thor was up and pacing around the small area, setting Steven’s nerves on fire. He managed to still his tongue, however, knowing that his friend was terrified for Loki.
He started with his notebooks.  He got up early in the morning and packed them into a crate.  Parker met him near the carnival to take the crate and a few other small belongings to begin ferrying them to
“Lady Sif,” Thor said, hugging her close to him. “It has indeed. And now I come to you in need of your help.”
“Steven, you can’t fool me,” Thor said.  “You weren’t talking to a mere acquaintance in there.  You were speaking like a scorned lover.”
“I am happy that you found one another,” Steven said, carefully.  “But that has nothing to do with Tony and myself.”
The scene that greeted them brought Steven up short.  Hovering above the Great Court was an enormous air ship.  Airships were forbidden from venturing past the outskirts of town, which would have made the sight odd enough.  But stranger still were the long ropes suspended from the gondola.  Steven saw men descending along the ropes, with guns slung across their backs.
Steven stared at him with confusion and a little bit of awe.  He didn't quite know how to respond.  As if on cue, Steven's stomach rumbled.  "No sir, I have not had lunch."  That seemed to be the only question he could answer at that moment.
“No,” Fandral said.  “There will be those there who recognize you.  And if they recognize you they will know of your ties to Loki.  You will be painting a target on us both.”
“Do not trouble yourself,” Fandral said.  “They will make all of the conversation you need.”  And his eyebrows waggled yet again.
“See, here’s the thing.  I think Bruce would have agreed with a lot of the ideas behind the Accords,” Tony explained.  “Now, he would have balked at the whole Ross bit of it, but that’s because he has developed a fine nose for bullshit.  But he’s like me in that he has a long record of being very aware of the consequences of his actions.”
Steven squared his shoulders and prepared to go and give Tony a piece of his mind when Loki touched his arm.  He looked over at the his friend, who was shaking his head.
Thor launched into the tale of their journey thus far. Steven noticed that Lady Sif, in particular, rolled her eyes at the first mention of Loki, but her mien turned to concern as Thor finished his story.
"Indeed," Lady Oxford said.  "How nice."  She turned back to Lady Frigga, making it quite clear that Steven no longer mattered.
She’s comfortable in bed in one of Clint’s t-shirts and clean panties, pillows a virtual cloud of comfort behind her back, wrist propped on another pillow at her side, bottle of water and
“A really good lawyer and layers on layers of cover-your-ass paperwork. There’s precedent for public soulmates, especially if one partner is a high-profile celebrity.” There’s an odd sound, which Bucky places a few moments later as the sound of Clint scrubbing his hands through his hair. “
Toni laughs. “You’re an asshole,” she says fondly. “But yes. I’ll love you again then. Only then, and not before. Let’s go get this bullshit over with. I want to be home by this time tomorrow.”
until he’s yelling something wordless and enraged, because it’s either that, or the pressure pounding behind his eyeballs explodes through his skull.
"Mostly sitting around. Some flying, mostly exotic locales. Occasionally, gunfire and explosions. I usually handle those in the suit, but it's been known to follow me back to the airport."
part. For some reason, you’re not allowed to call yourself The.” She lifts a hand and holds it out, and he seizes it and shakes it happily. “Call me Toni. You are..?”
It hits him like a semi thrown by a pissed-off Hulk, socks him in the gut so hard it bends him double, takes the breath out of his chest, grabs him by the throat and the heart and
“I don’t care how many robots you throw at me, Iron Man!” Steve is shouting, coming down the hallway like the goddamn Terminator, intense and terrifying and relentless. “I’ll tear through them all until you face me!”
“Okay,” he says, rubs his face briskly and straightens his back. “This is not your first amnesia rodeo, Stark. Focus. Last thing I remember is…” He wracks his memory, closing his eyes and combing through his mind to summon the images, the emotions, buried in the backup partition of his mind.
After a while of staring at the list and doing his best not to choke up, he pencils Bucky’s name beside March. There's no other name that could go there for him. He thinks Toni isn’t going to mind, can already see her face fill with compassion, feel her hand smooth along his shoulders in sympathy. It’s another thing he loves about her.
he’s fast, because he’s on her practically before she can blink, bellowing in rage and smashing the shield into her dented faceplate, hard enough that it dents
Natasha smiles a small smile, but says nothing. She’s seen the Iron Hawk specs. She’s seen the Iron Widow specs too, and appreciates every sleek line and deadly weapon Toni stockpiled onto it. One day, she might even ask Toni to let her have it.
If I see her in another hospital bed with bruises that match your hands or weapons, I am not going to give a single, merrily-flying fuck about mind control or magic spells or alien shapeshifters from another fucking galaxy. I will kill you, and because you both heal insanely fast, I will do so
with this much bullshit floating around in their heads? He grimaces and grinds his fingers into his temples, wishing he could just reach in and claw the pain out. At this point, he thinks, he might swear his allegiance to Hydra just to make it
“Probably because you’re a good man,” Toni says, standing up with the shield and trotting away. “And you’d insist on giving it back to its rightful owners.” She holds up the shield, out to the side, like a target. “The trigger’s pressure based, but I haven’t finished it yet. Can you just… flex your forearm a bit?”
“Stark, what is it?” Carter looms in front of her, is suddenly all concern and worry and human emotions. “Is it the palladium poisoning? What did you have for lunch? Did you brush up against anyone you didn’t know?”
The nurse is waiting in his room with her little wire cart. The pressure cuff is already in her hand. He sullenly sits on the edge of the bed, lets her wrap the cuff around his arm, lets her take his temperature, draw blood, examine his eyes and ears and throat. When she brings out the needle, fills it from a vial of thin, yellowish liquid, he balks. “No, I’m fine, really,” he says, lying through his teeth.
“Nah,” Hogan says easily. “I’ve got good people who can keep things going while I’m away. Driving Toni’s just an extra thing I do when she’s in town. You know, keep my eye on the boss in person.” He glances at Steve again with a grin. “And the boss’s friends, too. Makes her feel safer.”
Bucky shrugs, lets his back hit the hallway wall and crosses his arms. “It isn't about me,” he says. “But even if it was? Yeah. It sits just fine.”
She turns away puts the screwdriver down, and the tiny click of metal on metal is nearly deafening in the silence. “So,” she says tightly. “That just happened.”
The elevator doors open and she steps back onto the floor. This time, she’s the one ignoring the three of them, though she can feel them staring at her the whole time. She hauls the trunks off the trolley one by one, dropping them onto the floor near the far wall. Without a word, she goes directly into the kitchen and pours herself a coffee in the biggest mug she owns, stirs in a medically inadvisable amount of sugar, and snags a packet of pop tarts out of the cupboard.
Fitz exchanges another long, worried look with Jemma. “Is it just me, or does that sound an awful lot like Black Widow is going to jump at us at odd moments?”
It should worry her, but it doesn’t. Because it might be quiet in her head, it might be still and calm, but every synapse and every muscle in her body is alert and waiting for the first decision to move.
“Carol, I can almost guarantee you won’t believe a word,” Tony says cheerfully. “But just remember, that isn’t going to make it less true.”
He learns to tolerate Clint’s biting remarks, slowly relearns his own sharp humor in response. Learns about Toni’s quick wit and Natasha’s deadpan delivery, so dry it’s hard to tell sometimes when she’s joking and when she’s not.
“Don’t touch the lady,” comes Clint’s easy drawl from somewhere behind her, and Toni’s knees want to buckle with relief. “She’s got a nasty bite when you piss her off, and you don’t look current on your rabies shots.”
still an engineering student. You think I can’t recognize schematics and prototypes when you leave them lying around in the kitchen?”
He snorts, picks up the pace a few steps just to see if she notices. “Yeah, if you think that’s a thing I’m gonna stop doing at some point, sorry to disappoint, but at least one of us has gotta have a lick of sense in our heads. It’s clearly not gonna be you or Stevie.”
Steve lays a hand on what’s left of the healing pod, trying to wrap his head around the security feeds he’s been shown. Tony, peaceful and comatose, the same as he’s been for months, until he smirks and bursts into bright, orange-gold flames. The agents rushing in with fire extinguishers, technicians in jumpsuits and doctors in white lab coats racing to save Tony from the fire.
She’s babbling and waving her hands like a lunatic, and she really hopes she’s not insulting him with all the gagging and protesting. “I mean, I’m sure you’ll make someone a very happy soulmate someday, but oh god, gross. No, I am one hundred percent sure you are free and clear of any marks I may or may not be concealing on my person. Fuck, you’re my best friend! You’re like my brother, for chrissake!”
chokes him, flares bright and hot in blue fire along his limbs, and his street clothing melts into the Phoenix armor. “What the hell is
Checks his watch, because his head is really starting to hurt now. It’s been almost four hours since his last dose. He should ask Rumlow to give him another now. He needs to be at the top of his game. Peggy deserves him at no less than the top of his game.
Toni eyes him, shakes a tiny screwdriver in his direction. “I am a genius, and that ‘aw, shucks, really’ false modesty shit gives me cavities. I’m brilliant. And I made a fucking
doesn't want to fuck with, because even with accelerated healing and superior strength, he’s got the distinct impression that Clint’s beyond caring about his own well-being, and would cheerfully die as long as he takes the two of them out with him.
Natasha tightens her grip in his hair, then relaxes her fingers with effort. Her hands do not shake. They are steady as stones. “She won’t, because Toni is resourceful and smart, and despite her breathtaking lack of self-preservation, she knows how to take care of herself,” she says with firm assurance, and meets his eyes. “But if she dies, if we’re too late, we burn the world until all those responsible are ash and dust.”
“Right now, you’re not really a high-value target for the paparazzi,” Clint says. “However, with Stark Industries now the primary supplier for the US military in the Middle East, they’re getting more interested in you. I think we have an awesome opportunity to head things off at the pass, to control the image you’re going to end up getting. Everyone knows you have marks, but no one knows what they are.” She shoots him a look. He raises his hands, palms forward, and shakes his head. “I assume there’s a good reason for that, and I’m not asking to see them. But eventually someone’s going to try to get into your bedroom, rip your clothes,
They fed her bare minimum, and shit food at that. She was sick most of the time in that fucking cave, too. And she had the reactor in her chest. I mean, I honestly thought she was going to die in the evac chopper. But she held on until we got her to Ramstein Air Base. Took four weeks of constant IV nutrients to begin unfucking the damage. Nearly a year before she was anywhere near herself again.” Clint’s looking down at Toni again. “
That, more than anything else, has Steve’s full and undivided attention, but he restrains himself from showing any outward sign of anything but curious concern. “What makes you say that?”
That’s simply something he can’t let happen. Especially not after, when he inquires in friendly curiosity what made Tony come back to the Helicarrier, Tony tells him the nearly unbelievable story of his cellular systems having been combined and rewritten with Phoenix energy incorporated.
The fire cools, the ache in her body throbs down to manageable levels, and the darkness brightens into something blue and white and red and silver. Strong, gentle fingers thread through hers, pull her up through pain and suffering into soul-deep warmth. Toni surfaces as if from a long way underwater, and she takes another, deep, painless breath of sweet-scented air.
Toni glances back over her shoulder at him, rolls her eyes, disappears head and shoulders into the weapons locker again. “Goddammit,” she grumbles. “I lose more boyfriends to my personal arsenal. I’ve gotta stop whipping it out so readily, learn to preserve the mystery.”
Bucky expects it to be quieter once Toni and Steve leave for Malibu. More relaxed. It isn’t either of their faults, but the tension over the last few days has been thick enough to taste in the air, and it’s almost like an immense pressure has lifted off his shoulders with them taking alone time to work their shit out. He should feel guilty about that, but he doesn’t. He loves them both, but being their soulmate, their common link, is just fucking exhausting at the moment.
He gets a hand between them, twists his wrist until it feels like it’s going to break, slides his thumb over her clit. She thrashes and howls into his mouth, moans hard and fast and stuttering through clenched teeth. He pulls back to watch her face as her orgasm takes her and breaks her apart.
Steve smiles and opens the passenger-side door, puts the bag of produce in the back and settles into the seat. “I am,” he says, a little proud that he remembered to use the seatbelt without prompting this time. “Thank you for waiting for me.”
Trust Steve to go right for the question Bucky wants to answer the least. For a long moment, he isn’t sure how to answer. Finally, he just sighs and unzips his hoodie, hooks his fingers in the neck of his shirt, and pulls it down to show Toni’s soulmark.
He’s expecting anger, he’s expecting guilt, he’s expecting any number of things. What he gets… is quizzical confusion. “Neither? He’s my best friend, you’re my soulmate. There’s no jerking around happening in either direction.”
She dives for the open doors of the assembly bay, biting the inside of her cheek until it bleeds to keep her focused away from her hand. Recklessly slams on the speed, racking her brain for a plan, an escape route, anything, to save her ass.
Pepper’s laugh reminds him of Toni’s coffee, because like Toni’s coffee, it’s something he wouldn’t mind experiencing more often. “Phil, do you know nothing about me? My office contains more of my belongings than my apartment. I’m always there.”
There’s a pause. “Shall I include your accounts with Stark Industries, Stark Solutions and your private servers, ma’am?”
He’s never realized before how none of them share the same birth month. Right now, he’s pretty grateful for that. It makes this job easier and a lot more straightforward than he gleaned from what Toni said.
As if summoned by the very thought of “big-chested blonde”, Tony rounds a corner and there’s Steve, standing in the hallway, dark blue and silver chevrons instead of his stars and stripes, with a broad, happy smile and an outstretched hand. “Tony,” he says, warmth and camaraderie and other things Tony’s too busy trying to remember how fast a human heart is supposed to beat to decipher. “I’m glad you came back. I was worried about you.”
“Of course,” he says without hesitation. “Anything you need, Tony. Anything at all.” He pauses for a brief moment, and decides to add a caveat that will hopefully limit Tony’s characteristic wandering through computer files. “I’m not sure how many we have remaining. Unfortunately, your departure damaged a lot of systems, including the databanks where most of the medical records are stored. We have offsite backups, of course, but it takes time to request those. I’ll pull up what I can and give you access to them immediately. Will that be enough to start?”
“Soulmate, huh? Congratulations, Rhodey. Carol, my condolences.” She dusts off her most pleasant smile, and holds out a hand. “Toni Stark. And you are..?”
“We… he… We used to wonder about you,” Bucky says, eyes closed tight again. He isn’t sure, but it feels like the torture is starting to abate. “Used to talk about what you might be like. If you were a girl or a fella. I didn’t care one way or the other, but Steve… Steve was convinced you’d be a girl. Just a feeling he had, he said. Night before I went off to Europe, we’re lying in bed and he turns to me. Gives me this look, this determined fucking look, and he says, ‘If you find her over there, Buck, don’t tell her anything. She hears what she’s got waiting, and she won’t come back with you’. I told him not to be fuckin’ stupid, but that was Stevie. ‘No one wants a sick, scrawny, short soulmate’, he said. Never fuckin’ realized that he was saying it to someone who did.”
He strips the jacket of his uniform, sheds the undershirt he’s taken to wearing inside it, and dips his fingers in the paint to quickly outline the head and tentacles of the hydra. It offends him on more than just a personal level. From an artistic standpoint, as a student and fan of the classics, he knows damned well it’s a kraken, not a hydra, the organization uses to identify itself.
He has a bodyguard. He has a therapist. He has a physician. A handler. Someone who does his laundry. Someone who brings him food. Cleans his room. Darns his socks, for all he knows. He wishes they would all go away and leave him alone.
Good thing he’s got that whole Extremis electronic communion thing working for him. If not for that, he’d be totally screwed.
The workshop door opens at his approach, and the music cuts down to a level that’s barely audible. Toni spins around in her chair as he walks through the door, clearly surprised to see him, slightly panicked and even a little… guilty? The shield, he’s relieved to see, is on the bench behind her, and looks as shiny and undamaged as when he stacked it in the corner.
“Agreed,” Tony says with feeling, rolls back around so he’s streamlined once more. “Let’s make sure they never are.”
“Any last minute instructions you wanna give out, Tony?” It’s Clint in his ear, all casual and nonchalant, like they’re not flying into the maw of Hydra hell to pick a fight. “You’ve been a little light on the details. Maybe blame that on the ungodly powerful four-year-old who crashed our war meeting, but this seems like a good time to let everyone in on what you want them to do.”
"You got it, boss," she says, feeling the relief wash over raw nerves and violent instincts. "J, give the man what he needs."
Coulson has the courtesy, or maybe just the self-preservation instinct, to make his presence known long before he taps on the door. “Toni,” he says, and Toni will never admit it, but his calm voice is a soothing balm to her raw, screaming nerves. She may have done her level best to avoid him on occasion -- or all the time, even -- but Coulson carries himself in an utterly unflappable manner, and right now, she’s not going to deny herself the tiny bit of comfort she’s taking in that. “Can I come in?”
Nothing comes, so he shoves it aside for the moment, bumping it onto its own thought track to percolate as it will. He shoves down his disquiet and unease too, because as he told himself on the Moon, this is not his first amnesia rodeo, and he's bound to have some dissonant feelings and impulses until his brain finishes unscrambling itself.
the one other person besides Bucky who should never, ever have cause to fear him. But they ruined that, made
without warning. And him at the end of his rope, coming to stop her. A fight, both of them furious and pulling no punches, then Carol hits him harder than she probably intended, and then
Clint’s eyes are dark and pained. “I couldn’t even tell you, Toni. I’m still trying to wrap my brain around the fact that Jasper fucking Sitwell, who I’ve had dinner with, run ops with, sat and shot the shit with, sent more’n fifty STRIKE members into our goddamn home and attacked us. It was authorized from somewhere, cos that much paperwork? Yeah. Someone had to rubber-stamp it somewhere. It’s just not Fury’s style, though. And
But somehow, despite being stronger, faster and more tactically-experienced than all of them, he finds himself herded, neatly and expertly, by a double-team of Carol and Coulson, who distract him with a sales pitch for the Avengers Initiative and questions about aerial tactics to use in tandem with other aerial fighters, bouncing his attention back and forth between them until his goddamn head is spinning. The next thing he knows, he is sitting in a chair on the far side of the den with an unopened beer in one hand and Bucky on the arm of the chair, his feet firmly pressing Steve’s knees down.
He doesn’t know how to ask, or even who he’d approach with the request, but fate takes mercy on him for once, and introduces him to Agent Phil Coulson not long after.
She presses her fingers on either side of her nose, squeezing her sinuses gently. Christ, her head hurts. It’s the kind of mammoth migraine that laughs in the face of pain relief, will only be cured by sleep and food and more sleep.
“Bad enough,” Bucky replies. “But she’ll be okay.” At Steve’s burning, pointed look, he sighs. “Stevie…”
“Coulson called,” Rhodey says, still chuckling. “Invited us to this gathering you seem to be having. Carol’s a bit behind. She stopped for a snatch-and-grab, you know how she is. Told me to fly ahead while she took care of the thief.”
“Boss?  I think you’ll want to see this,” she said.  The video was replaced by a live television feed.
“Firstly, effective immediately, I am announcing not only my retirement, but the retirement of Colonel James Rhodes and the being known as the Vision.  We can not and will not operate under the current  framework, which has been twisted to imprison without due process those who have acted in what they felt was good faith in the protection of citizens.  Should the unthinkable happen and Earth find herself once again under attack from vengeful aliens, we will be there, but we will no longer put ourselves and our freedom under threat from petty tyrants looking to settle a score by manipulating the good intentions of others.”
“Well, considering that I’m half of the pair, technically it would be Bisexual life mates,” Tony said, manipulating a hologram of Rhodey’s nervous system.  “And no, sugar bear, I’m not trying to get you out of your pants.  Well, I kinda have to, but mostly I’m trying to get you out of your exoskeleton.”
The taller man, quite the opposite of his friend, shook his head.  "Please excuse Loki," he said.   "I assure you he means no harm, despite his abhorrent manners.  I am Thor, and he is Loki."  He held out his hand.
When Tony took the podium, he was addressing the delegates from the 111 remaining signatories to the Sokovia Accords.  Since the incident with Zemo, several nations had removed themselves from the deal, some citing their agreement with Captain America’s actions, and some not so much as agreeing with him as disagreeing with the way it was handled.
"So what wonders do you have in store for me today?" Tony asked.  "Some monstrous skeleton or exhibition on a lost tribe?"
"Huh," Steven said.  "I suppose I had better finish this, then."  He returned to his work, studying the shell with fierce concentration.  The only thing that gave any hint at the new course for the day was a slight smile tugging at his mouth.
Everyone but Tony headed to the cargo area of the gondola.  It was packed full of crates, which according to Tony was the reason that they had been able to catch up to the ship, even with such a large lead.  The crates were arranged in a methodical manner, with a main aisle running lengthwise down the center of the airship.  A large ladder was affixed to a hole in the ceiling, allowing quick access to the upper area.  They avoided it for the moment.
“That is not what I asked,” Vision said.  “Unless this information is locked in his brain, in which case I will be more than happy to carve it out.”
“Naughty boy,” he said. He kicked the ladder away, and Tony helplessly flailed as he fell. He hit hard, and a second stranger leapt down from above and placed a heavy boot on the ladder, trapping Tony underneath.
"They can look at my son all they want," she ranted.  "But no trollop will ever carry the title of Lady Oxford.  I will not stand for it."
Tony stopped to consider that for a moment. Then he shook his head and tried to will away any attempt at an erection. He was fairly certain Steve would not appreciate it. He instead sat down in front of the laptop to see what in the hell Steve was on about. Sure enough, the super soldier’s grinning mug gazed out from a pair of well filled boxer briefs. He glanced up to the web address and sighed.
“Well,”Steve said.  “I’ve got a super spy I could lend you.  Point Natasha in the right direction, and let her take it from here.”
“Most of them are delightful,” Fandral said, grinning.  “It is a place where the rich and the educated meet.  You’ll see politicians, nobility, financiers, those sorts.  It’s set up as a Grecian temple, although all of the rooms have a special theme--quite decadent.”  He leered at them and waggled his eyebrows.
“Well then, it is safe to return,” Steven said.  He stood and brushed the crumbs from his hands.  “I’ll go make your sketches.”
“We have to wait for the others.  Hopefully Tony has finished disabling the ship,” he whispered.  Just then, a sharp whistle caught their attention.  Hogun looked outside and nodded when he caught sight of Fandral and their friends crouched near a stack of crates.  He turned to motion them forward when the first explosion occurred.
“What they found is that they were able to get temporary results in this manner.  He would be somewhat obedient for a certain period of time, but then would relapse and his original personality would begin to reassert itself.  Now, remember that their technology was nothing like what we have now, but even then they were able to see that the damage to his hippocampus was healing.  Due to the serum in his blood, he was actually regenerating brain tissue.”
This is what happens when you combine coffee and gelato.  I thought we might need a moment of crack.
“Clint, you’re all pissed off that I had Wanda confined to the compound?  Well, did you bother to wonder why?  Because you surely never called me to ask.  Friday, pull up the video,” Tony said.  He stood up and began pacing around the table.  Footage of a masked protest hovered above the table.  Some of the individuals held signs that said ‘Burn the Witch’.  An effigy of a woman dressed in red hung from a noose.
“Calm yourself, Stevie,” Bucky said.  “We’re just going in to do a little investigating.  You said that not everyone there is looking to bed the hostesses?” He directed the last to Fandral.
Steven wanted to wrench away from his friend.  He wanted to grab Tony by the shoulders and shake him.  He wanted to demand to know why someone of Tony’s talents would use them to fool poor, uneducated people.  But he did none of those things.  He listened to his friend and he walked away.  They left Loki to study scrolls and went to get a glass of something strong.
“There is a new technology that was developed to help trauma survivors go back and observe their memories,” Samson said.  “It hooks up to the hippocampus and creates a link between it and an external framework.  Then the user can reference the memory and the framework to revisit the memory in a palpable way to find a resolution."  He had a distinctly uncomfortable look on his face.  Steve understood immediately.
He closed his eyes again and tried to drown out the sounds of traffic below.  The wind whipped around the roof, but it wasn’t loud enough to drown out the sound of the intruder who slipped over the wall.  T’Challa opened his eyes and sighed in frustration at the man in front of him.
Philip chuckled.  The two men might be slightly insane, but at least Steven didn't look like he'd just lost his puppy.
“I would like to turn myself in,” Steve said.  Looking at his earnest face and sad eyes, T’Challa began to see why people were so eager to follow him.  That didn’t keep him from wanting to smack the good Captain upside the head.
“Jesus,” Clint said.  He stood up and left the room.  Steve remembered that of them all, Clint had the most intimate and recent experience with mind control.  Natasha had made some comments about her past that made Steve think she was acquainted with it as well, but Clint still had nightmares about what he’d done under Loki’s control.
Steve worried that they wouldn’t be enough.  That someone would go after Tony for the mess that was the Accords, and they wouldn’t be able to stop them.  He should be there.  He should be protecting his former team mate.  His friend.  He’d sent Tony the phone, praying that he would call and tell Steve that he needed him.  That he had forgiven Steve for lying.  But the phone sat there, day after day, doing even less that Steve was.
"Actually, Loki brought me flowers from his gardens," Lady Frigga said.  "And he brought their new friend to meet me.  May I introduce Steven Rogers, from New York?"
Steve knew it would be bad, but he felt as if he was about to throw up.  He wasn’t sure he could sit through this.  He remembered what Bucky had been through at the Hydra compound during the war, and the thought that something so much worse had occurred to his friend, his brother, just shattered him.
“Hawkeye,” he said, walking towards his friend.  Barton’s face was devoid of emotion, right up until the second he drew back his fist and punched Coulson in the face, cracking his sunglasses and potentially breaking his nose.
“Fair enough.  I know we’ve put you in an untenable spot.  If we’d known more about the situation here, we might have been able to stay put, but Clint, he…  his wife.  His children.  They protected us when they didn’t have to, and we couldn’t sit by while they were abducted.”
“I don’t care,” Steven said.  “Whatever it is, I don’t care.  I just care that you’re lying to this poor man as well.”  He gestured to Tony’s companion.  “Using him to get you in?”
“I’m very good at making things explode,” Tony replied with a grin. Steve couldn’t help grinning himself at the look of pride in Tony’s eyes. “They won’t know what hit ‘em.”
to facilitate his own endeavors as an amateur scholar, traveling around Europe researching language and literature.  If he happened to make a little side money smuggling various articles, that was neither here nor there.
To be honest, Clint had been surprised that Steve would leave Bucky in Wakanda, but the man seemed to be more than willing to trust T’Challa’s doctors if it meant getting back to New York to check on their former teammates, and to start to make amends.
Phil watch as Clint broke down.  He reached over and put his hand on Clint’s shoulder.  The uncomfortable silence was broken by the new AI, Friday.
Jarvis and Parker were already preparing the ship for departure.  They had obtained a set of scales and were currently weighing the luggage and cargo.  With such a large party, Tony knew that they would have to be careful in how much weight they carried, and he was mentally sorting through his items to see what could be left in storage.
"My lady," Loki said.  He dropped a quick kiss on her cheek and handed her the flowers.  "This is Steven Rogers, our American.  He has been joining us on our excursions."
"I could not impose," Tony said, raising his hands in protest.  "You have been too kind to me already."
As for how he saw himself, Steven knew he would never fit in with his family's circle.  He did not care for politics or business.  He did not care if the cut of his coat was fashionable.  His mother's dinner parties were torture, and he shuddered to think of what happened when he was pressured to ask some unfortunate female to dance.  His head was always somewhere else.  He wanted to see the world.  To see the great cultures that came before, to understand how they viewed the world and how they depicted their lives.
“I do not know,” Tony said.  He grabbed Steven and moved behind a display case, which gave them cover while allowing them to see what happened.  “This exhibition contains materials found in a recently discovered laboratory.  From what little he has been able to decipher so far, Mr. Banner thinks it may have belonged to an ancient scientist called Heron.”
“You have said that you wish to leave home,” Thor said.  “You wish to travel the world and study.  Surely once you are out from under their constant scrutiny, you can live your life as you wish?”
Laura had been adamant about going to Tony, and Phil was surprised to find himself agreeing.  Tony was fiercely protective, especially when it came to kids.  And from Phil’s perspective, Tony needed a soft touch to see him through.  With Pepper out of the picture, he needed a quasi-maternal figure to help him rein in his actions.  Laura, after dealing with Clint’s bullshit for years, would be more than a match for the heroes living under Tony’s roof.
“What is it, my gal Friday?” he said.  He stood up and shuffled to the coffee pot, grimacing at the dregs of the batch he’d made somewhere north of four a.m.
Mr. Banner managed to hail a hired cab within two blocks of the museum.  Steve and Tony stuffed Bucky inside and then helped Thor climb into the carriage.  Steve settled the larger man back onto the threadbare cushions while Tony spoke to a young boy, sending him off on several errands.  After a brief discussion with Mr. Banner, the latter set off on foot, leaving them.  Tony gave directions to the driver and then climbed into the carriage.  They set off along a side street.
It was a fine June evening, warm without being hot, with clear skies and a slight breeze.  The Great Court of the British Museum glowed with the seeming thousands of the new steam-powered electric lights strung up above them, crisscrossing the sky like shooting stars.  There were large buffets set out around the Reading Room, and staff milled about providing the elegant assembly with glasses of punch and wine.  If Steven had felt small on his first visit to the large complex, he now felt both small and under-dressed.
Her second stipulation was that he have companions.  His choice was his friend Bucky Barnes, the youngest son of a neighboring family and one of his few friends that didn't seem bothered by his scholarly ways.  For her part, his mother chose to send along her trusted employee, Mr. Philip Coulson.  He was loyal to the family, and had been blessed with a solid head on his shoulders.  He would be well equipped to keep Steven and Bucky out of trouble.
"Grand Tour," Steven said.  "Well, whichever stops on the Grand Tour have historical or artistic merit.  I'm quite interested in history, you see."
"Trust me, he wasn’t running away from accountability,” Tony assured him.  “From his perspective, he was carrying a live nuclear warhead out of a population center.  It’s his ultimate version of accountability.  You have to understand that Bruce, well…”
Tony made no move to pick it up.  “And why in the hell should I think that he has any concern about that?” he asked.  “T’Challa and the people he harbored have shown no concern for me and mine, except to try and kill us.”
Vision supposed that was what had prompted Captain Rogers.  By lying through their teeth, the captain and the king made sure that the public was once again ready to forgive Steve Rogers and Sergeant James Barnes.  And with that, the rumblings against Mr. Stark were starting up again.  The words ‘persecuted’ and ‘loyal’ were thrown around with respect to the captain, and the word ‘arrogant’ and ‘self-centered’ were used about Mr. Stark.  It was difficult to stay silent, but Vision couldn’t speak out.  He knew people would take one look at him and see nothing but Ultron.  Something to fear.  Something different.  A mistake.  Tony Stark’s mistake.
“No fire, promise,” Tony said, making an ‘X’ over his heart.  “But I could probably program in some bitching powers, if you’re feeling all experiment-y.”
He quietly removed the fittings on the main steam pipe. It would have been quicker to just take a wrench to the bloody thing, but it also would have attracted a little too much attention. He took a screwdriver to the gearbox next, and then jammed a wrench into the control panel, making it impossible to move several of the levers. It should take them hours to fix it, if not days.
Every picture, every video showed a Tony Stark who was vastly different from the gleeful badass who had delighted in mocking everything and everyone around him.  No, that Tony Stark had been replaced by a grim-faced tech titan, flanked at every moment by Colonel Rhodes and Vision.  The remaining Avengers stood guard over Tony like guardian, warrior angels.  Steve could see the change in Rhodey’s gait, and the faint bulge under his pants legs that were most likely an exoskeleton.  And he noticed the watch that was a War Machine twin to the red and gold watch that Tony wore.  They were never less than vigilant and never unarmed.
“Ross has disappeared, and as they say, out of sight, out of mind,” T’Challa said.  “I will do what I can to manage the situation.  But I am not sure how much help I can offer.  Or that it will even be accepted.”
“Their families have long been friends with mine,” Thor said. “When our home country deserted the habit of titles, they sold their holdings and moved. My family moved to England, while their families moved on to the continent.”
Their party was rounded out by Hogun, Fandral, Thor, and Sif. Volstagg had offered to accompany them, but he was the first to admit that his size made stealth, well, not very stealthy. Tony was to make his way to the engine room while the other searched the ship for their friends. Fandral had offered to accompany Tony, but Tony preferred to work alone.
When Steve had introduced him to Rhodey at one of the parties that Tony had thrown at the tower, he had to admit he’d been a little star-struck.  Not as bad as the giddy feelings he’d had when he met Cap, but pretty damned close.  Rhodes had a calm, competent air about him that spoke of experience and loyalty--the ultimate airman, and Sam was constantly reminding himself to stand up straight and look him in the eye.  Until, of course, he heard Rhodes tell Stark to shut the fuck up and hand him another beer.  Just like that, the tension had been broken, and suddenly there was a very real and very approachable man in front of him.
"The much poorer, much younger sister who married a great, bloody Viking," Thor explained with a wry grin.  "The rest of the family was less than welcoming."
With that, Tony left the podium, with Rhodey and Vision taking their positions at his side.  Not that long ago, he would have left them with a peace sign and a blown kiss.  But that Tony was gone.  This one just stared ahead and dared anyone to get in his way.
Steven stood far enough away to be out of their sight, but close enough to see the tablet.  He made a quick sketch, and then turned to a fresh sheet of paper for a more detailed version.  Lord Oxford lost interest, and excused himself, but the curators were kind enough to allow Steven to finish.  Once the tablet was secured again, he proceeded to copy the front and side markings of the tablet.
In the wake of the revelation at the carnival, Philip was at a loss for how to deal with a moping Steven.  The young man spent the next few days wandering around the Natural Science museum, lingering over magnificent specimens and filling his sketchbook.  Philip followed him, worried at how listless and quiet his young charge seemed.  While he was glad that any burgeoning relationship between Steven and the Stark boy had been nipped in the bud, he hated to see Steven so sad.  Sarah Rogers had wanted Steven to settle down, not break his spirit.
“Steven, you know how to act in polite society,” Bucky said.  “All of those parties your mother dragged you to back in New York.  You’ll be fine.”
Sam closed his browser window, unable to read anything more.  He told himself that these people didn’t know what they were talking about.  That they didn’t know Steve, and what an inspiring leader he was.  But a little voice inside his head asked if he had really questioned Steve’s methods enough.  Was he so used to following orders that he followed the man blindly down an unnecessarily violent and damaging road?
“Either way, it’s done,” Steven said, finally.  “Had he been honest with me, I could accept his ‘profession’.  But he wasn’t.  I would never be sure if he was telling the truth, and he would always remember me accusing him of being a thief.”
“Explain what?” Steven snarled.  “You’re a charlatan.  All of your fine words about using your gifts for the betterment of man, and you’re really just using them to line your pockets?  Is that what you wish to explain?”
Dikotsi R. lost his father in Johannesburg.  The old man had been in the market buying fruit when he was caught up in the battle between Iron Man and the Hulk.  He had received a letter from Mr. Stark, apologizing.   He’d also been given a job with the Maria Stark Foundation crews that were sent in to rebuild so many of the damaged buildings.  He missed his father every day, though.  And he believed that something needed to be done to keep the senseless death from happening again.
Steven found a quiet spot behind a display and leaned against the wall, tipping his head back to rest on the cool stone.  Seeing Tony again had stirred up all of his emotions.  He shouldn’t be so bothered; they had only known each other for a matter of days before Steven found out about Tony’s lies.  But he had felt an immediate kinship with the other man, and he had to admit, an attraction.  He supposed that he looked young and naive, and perhaps he was.  Philip had warned him, but Steven had only seen good in Tony’s smile and his pretty words.
He checked his pocket watch and saw that his contact was running late.  He took another puff and let the smoke drizzle out of his mouth, trying to remain patient.  The secrets he wanted to discover had waited nearly two thousand years to see the light of day, and twenty more minutes would not matter.  Two puffs later, he saw his contact making his way through the crowd.  Rahul was not a small man, and he crashed into nearly everyone, bring much more attention than the man would have liked.
Lady Oxford turned to Steven and looked him up and down.  It finally occurred to Steven just who she reminded him of—his first teacher back home.  She'd been a handsome woman, though hard.  And she'd made his knees quake in fear, much like Lady Oxford.
Lady Frigga's smile dimmed.  "He is with his father, taking care of some business," she explained.  "They should return soon."
Steven had no idea what to say.  He knew he should be appalled, but that would be hypocritical.  Thor and Loki had been nothing but kind, and Steven would not abuse their friendship, or their trust.
"A few," Tony said.  "But there is a new exhibition opening in a week.  It should have more.  Will you still be in London?"  He seemed almost hesitant to ask.
Thor was represented by a pair of tighty-whities with a very stylized version of his hammer dangling down in front. You also got a second pair where the hammer was thrusting up towards the sky.
As they neared the center of the ship, they heard a commotion below, back in the cargo section.  Fearing that Bucky and the others had been caught, Steve rushed forward and slid to the floor, trying to get a look down the ladders that ended in the cargo space.  There were armed guards carrying two bundles that squirmed and struggled against their captivity.  Steven prayed that Loki was one of them.
“You are all in for a treat,” Thor said with a tired smile. “Lady Sif and her friends are a merry group.”
“What about the fire breathing?  I’m not a dragon or that annoying kid that hangs out with Richards,” Rhodey asked.
“But it seems that the scrolls were older than the tablets,” Loki explained.  “It’s as if the information on the tablet was more important, and the owner wanted to make sure it survived.  I would dearly love a rubbing of them.”  The last was said with a small sigh.
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man:  Unable to vocalize.  {checking vitals}  {oxygen levels: within normal parameters} {heart rate: slightly elevated} {blood pressure: within normal parameters}
The captain of his bodyguards joined him on the dais.  She perched on the arm of his throne and studied the young women with a frown.  She would always find them wanting, because in her opinion, no one was better suited to guard her brother than she herself, Shuri, Princess of Wakanda.
“Awww.  Look at you,” Rhodey said, grinning.  “There’s still a heart underneath all of the large-and-in-charge badass we’ve been seeing lately.”
“So Bruce, he’s stuck.  One hand, he is terrified of hurting someone.  On the other hand, that big heart of his won’t let him not help people.  So he tries to find a place where he can help.  Where he can make up for the destruction that Hulk has caused.  Usually, he thinks that place is as far away from civilization as possible.”
