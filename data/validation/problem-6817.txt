Tony’s jaw drops open, gaping at Steve like he’s just grown a second head.  “Um… maybe trying to get us out of here?  Or is that not something you'd be interested in?”
Steve graduated Summa Cum Laude with a double major from a prestigious university, all while maintaining a full-time training schedule.  He should’ve been able to better decipher the signs long before he did.
Tony leaned back in his chair, a sickenly wide grin spreading across his lips.  He would never admit it out loud, but he absolutely loved that Steve could somehow sense his mood even over the phone.
Steve gave a nod as his hands came to rest on Tony’s hips.  The whole time he was getting dressed, he’d been reminding himself that this was serving a purpose.  That after today, he, Tony, Peter, and Bucky—and therefore Sam by default—would all be able to sleep a bit easier at night.
Unfortunately, the next hour that passed didn't prove to be any more fruitful than the hours before it, and soon enough Tony was on the comm, staring at the drawing Steve gave him as he called out to him in a shaky voice.
“Hey, now!” Clint pipes up from his desk in the third corner of their triangular-shaped area.  He pokes his head around his dividing wall, scowling in Natasha’s direction.  “That was not my fault, and you know it!”
"No, thank you. Um… can you start at the northernmost point and just move south along the coast, please? And go slow?"
"Yeah, it is." While Peter could see General O'Brien having it in for Papa because Grandma refused to marry him, it was still weird to try and kill him now when he could've just refused to give Papa the serum all those years ago and he would've just died on his own.
“But Tony’s not involved with the company at all,” adds Natasha.  “Or at least, not anymore.  He actually owns a body shop over in Midtown.  One that caters to the rich and famous, apparently.”
As soon as Peter had disappeared down the hallway, Tony slumped down onto the couch, leaning back and closing his eyes.
"You staying home was still the right choice, Tony," Steve said firmly, once again demonstrating his prowess at reading Tony's thoughts. "How's Peter doing?"
"That was our theory as well, Tony," Natasha said gently. "You mentioned that you saw something off to the side of the lake right before the ice formed, so if this guy Gill caused the ice and then disintegrated afterwards like the other guy did a few days ago, it would explain why we couldn't find him."
"Peter, I promise I'm gonna be careful," Steve said. "I'm gonna have Uncle Sam, Uncle Bucky, and Auntie Nat with me, so… you know they'll be able to keep me in line."
Steve swiped at his eyes, stowing his phone back into his pocket. "Yeah, well, it worked. He knew right where to hit me."
"This isn't how I'd planned to do this at all," Steve blurted out. "But… I'd love it if you could close your eyes, and imagine that we're out near the baseball field where we used to have our picnics, and that I'm standing in front of you right now, holding both of your hands. Can you see it, Tony?"
"C'mon, big guy. Let's go," Tony said when Bruce started muttering to himself, finally flipping the final switch.
"Thanks," said Peter as he turned another page, on which was a beautiful drawing of a polar bear cub frolicking in the snow. "This one I drew from a picture in an old magazine since I've never been able to see one in person. Isn't she cute?"
"Just barely," Maria said, letting out a heavy sigh as she turned off her lamp. "I had to pry his fingers from my hand once he was, though."
"No, no, I don't think that's necessary," said Steve. The less radiation that Peter was exposed to, the better. "I trust your judgment, Dr Cho. If you say he's healing like he should be, then that's good enough for me."
Not that she would've had the time to date anyone anyway. As the only source of income for their family, Sarah was forced to practically work herself to the bone in order to keep a roof over their heads and food on their table, not to mention paying for the medicines that Steve constantly needed in order to keep breathing. During the winters it often got to the point where Sarah went days without even coming home, choosing instead to just sleep at the hospital for a few hours in between her shifts while leaving Steve in the care of Bucky's family, whose father was also an Air Corps pilot and whose mother didn't have to work.
Or at least he was until he suddenly locked eyes with Tony, and proceeded to shoot him a glare that would've proverbially splattered him across the entire front of the classroom.
HYDRA had done everything in their power to try and break him, but Steve had refused to give in, just like he always had. Tony had never known Steve to back down from a fight, even when the odds were practically insurmountable against him.
They were also easier to cook, heating completely through in about half the time as a regular chicken breast. After sprinkling the thighs with some olive oil and a touch of salt and pepper and setting them to steam roast on the stove, Steve set Peter to shredding some carrots, a much easier task for a twelve-year-old boy whose strength varied from one to a thousand at any given time than grating fragile cinnamon sticks. They then added the carrot shreds to some chopped up celery and fresh basil leaves, fresh garlic, and a pinch of oregano and black pepper, stirring it all with a wooden spoon. After adding the cooked chicken and some elbow macaroni noodles, Steve and Peter set up a quick chess game at the table while it all simmered for about fifteen minutes, finally ladling a big bowl of the soup for Peter to try.
His voice trailed off as he pushed himself up off the chair and shuffled towards the bathroom, but Tony caught his meaning anyway.
"Uhh." Tony's heart was thudding as he quickly gathered up all of his Project Phoenix papers and shoved them into a drawer, slamming it closed. Then he looked down at his lap, just now realising that he was still dressed in the same clothes he'd worn for the past two days.
.  Searing, throbbing pain that burned across every single nerve fibre in his body, made worse by the constant groaning noise filling his frozen ears that sounded far,
Mr Clean's brow furrowed. "I am not in a class. In fact, and I am sorry to have to be the one to tell you, but at the moment, neither are you."
"A bit," Peter muttered. "I think I could take it if it was only a bit, but they're like on completely different levels of paranoia. It's like they still think I'm just a little kid, but it's even worse than that because they've both seen me in training, so they know what I can do! I even managed to web Papa to the ceiling up at the Compound last summer!"
Besides, Steve had already made up his mind, and already discussed it individually with Bucky, Thor, and Bruce, and the rest of the team as a group. At the moment his plan was that if something were to happen to him, Thor would immediately find Peter and transport him to Asgard, leaving him in the protection of his guardian Heimdall before returning for Tony. Once Peter and Tony were both safe, Thor would then return to the Tower or Compound and assess the situation, continuing to evacuate the non-enhanced team members if he thought it viable while Bucky and Bruce/ Hulk attempted to hold off any potential opposition. Once everyone was sequestered on Asgard, they would then monitor what was going on on Earth via Heimdall and formulate additional plans from there.
"But how can you be sure?" demanded Peter, dangerously close to squeaking. "If Thanos snapped his fingers but my dad's not dead, then where'd he go?"
, after all, but to Tony he was still just a kid, still just his little Petey, and he'd be damned if he would allow anything to happen to make his little Petey have to grow up any faster than he already was. And that included naming him an Avenger while he was only a sophomore in high school.
Peter rolled his eyes.  “Yes, you do, Dad.  And you deserve Steve too, ‘cause you love him, and he loves you.  The three of us can all be happy together.”
"So, Grandpa came by again yesterday," Peter said. He braced himself for Dad's reaction, relieved when he saw Steve reach for Dad's hand. "He… well… he was—"
Silently, he and Tony headed across the main lab to the opposite side, where Sam, Clint, and Natasha were standing by the double doors.
"What did you do to me?" Steve whispered, barely catching himself on the wall before he tipped over. Panic welled inside him as he clawed at his sleeve with his fingers, trying to scratch away the vile symbol. "I will never become one of you!"
"Okay, but I'm still going to," Steve said, stifling a cough. "So you're just gonna have to get used to it."
“Please, sweetheart,” Steve begged as he broke away from Tony’s mouth, kissing a path down his cheek to his pulse point.  “Please, I need—I need—”
He had no doubt that if Bucky and Natasha weren't standing next to him, he would've already crumpled into a heap. Right there in the middle of the battlefield.
"Oh, sweetheart, that sounds almost too sweet for words." Steve immediately conjured up a mental picture of the precious image, filing it into its appropriate compartment so he could attempt to sketch it out later.
"I know, Tony," Steve murmured. "But you don't have to tell me all at once, okay? I'm not going anywhere."
“That’s the theory,” says Tony.  “And that’s just scratching the surface.  The possibilities could literally be endless with something like that.”
Bucky immediately rolled his eyes. "You really don't miss a thing, do ya? We were gonna tell everyone once we all sat down."
As soon as Stacy was out of sight, Steve pulled out his phone. As he'd suspected, the first text was from Bucky, informing him that Peter and Gwen were seated five rows in front of him and that he could see them both clearly from his position, and also that Peter had purchased enough popcorn, drinks, and candy for at least six people. He had even bought Bucky some sour skittles, which had become his favourite candy since he'd moved into the Tower.
"Huh?" Peter said as Papa hurriedly left his room, returning a few moments later with one of Dad's old and ratty MIT hoodies.
"Tony, do you feel that?" Steve rasped against his neck. He rocked forward, pulling gasps from both of their throats. "Do you feel me inside you? Do you feel how well we fit together?"
"Ah huh. And by the time you're finished with it you'll probably have written an entire doctoral dissertation, just like last time," Tony said proudly. "And we'll all be there to watch you give it."
"Yeah," Steve quietly agreed, forcing a smile. "Make yourself comfortable, Scott. We'll all speak again in the morning."
"I know you do, Tony, and Peter, he loves you so much," said Steve. "He was so sad at first when you could never get away in time to visit him and it was breaking my heart, so once I figured out who he was I asked—"
Closing his eyes, Tony buried his nose further into Steve's pillow, trying to relax enough to fall asleep again. He was a bit sore and sticky from all of their sexual calisthenics over the course of the night, but it was the good kind of sore, like what one would expect after a hard workout. Warmth bloomed across his chest as he recalled the way Steve's hands and lips had caressed his skin, and the husky sound of his voice as he demanded for Tony to look into his eyes.
A chorus of murmurs fluttered around the room as the three men turned to leave, with Bucky lingering behind.
“Um…” Peter said as he quickly glanced around, realising that he’d spent his entire time in the store in that one aisle.  He would definitely have to come back, and soon.
Steve cupped Tony's cheek, pressing their foreheads together. "No, we can't, sweetheart, but we don't have to worry about it right this second either. Let's just try and enjoy this a bit first, okay?"
Stepping into Tony’s office, Steve’s heart skipped a beat as Sam, Bucky, and Colonel Rhodes all immediately shot up from the couch.  Both Bucky and Colonel Rhodes were dressed in their military uniforms, their jackets carefully draped over Tony’s jacket holder, and Bucky had also removed his prosthetic arm, his empty left shirtsleeve carefully pinned out of the way.
"Mmm," grumbled Tony. "Or I can just make sure that I develop some kind of interspace communications system before anyone else decides to go caravanning between planets. 'Cause this whole waiting next to the phone thing really freaking sucks."
"Uhh… so now you're talking about parallel universes?" Scott asked, obviously confused. "'Cause if so, I'm pretty sure we've just jumped right out of
"Yes, you did," Steve said softly. "And you know that I don't blame you for it. I just really wish that it wasn't true."
Steve's lips twitched, his eyebrows knitting together as he gently removed Tony's glasses, setting them on the bedside table.
He was cut off by a bloodcurdling, anguished scream coming from below, and he squeezed his eyes closed, hugging Peter so hard that he grunted. After Afghanistan, Tony understood the sounds of torture all too well.
"Okay, I think I'm good now," Peter said a few heartbeats later. Then he planted his palm on Steve's shoulder and slowly hefted himself up, pausing again for a few seconds once he was standing.
As Steve's legs finally decided to stabilise underneath him, he gave the immediate area a quick once-over. Thor was also there, completely shell-shocked as he stared at the spot where Thanos had disappeared.
Steve huffed, his blue eyes filled with such intense self-loathing that Tony flinched as they locked with his. He
Peter shook his head, internally knocking himself on the forehand as he fished his phone from the pocket, pulling up his Contacts app. "Oh, sure. That makes perfect sense."
They all fell into an awed silence as the fireworks continued, lighting up the sky for a good twenty minutes before the big, booming finale that was so loud that it shook the snow from the treetops. At some point Steve draped his arm across Tony's shoulders, while Peter scooted his chair closer so he could lean his head against Tony's arm, with Steve gently stroking the back of his head. It was the same way the three of them usually watched movies together, with Tony sandwiched in between his two beloved boys.
Even Pietro and Wanda, who'd only been with the team since the end of May and were still learning how to use the full extent of their abilities, could call themselves Avengers.
"Except that Mr Wizard here is the one who's got the Time Stone," said Dad. "So, yeah, Thanos is probably coming here."
To Peter's relief, the door swung open easily. As he and Ned stepped over the threshold, Peter fought against the urge to cover his ears against the blare of the music, kicking himself for not remembering his earplugs.
he thought as his mind finally caught up with his instincts.  He looked down, his heart almost cracking in two when he saw Peter’s terrified face, and the pain radiating from his huge brown eyes.
"No, you're not, and neither were they," Sam said firmly. "General Patton was just an asshole who didn't know any better."
Tony was just about done tweaking a couple of settings on the latest design of Natasha's Widow's Bites when JARVIS announced that the three of them had arrived, with Steve and Thor's heavy footsteps and Peter's lighter ones heading toward the lab a few seconds later.
Once again the battle seemed to pause as everyone on both sides glanced up at the gargantuan ship, watching as it settled about two hundred or so metres above the ground. Tony's heart thudded as he heard T'Challa order his warriors to regroup, followed directly by Valkyrie ordering the Asgardians to do the same.
And how things might have been different if he had done so! Would the Chitauri have even bothered with Earth if Howard hadn't accidentally found the Tesseract after the war, paving the way for HYDRA to resume their secret work with it? Nick Fury had stated that it had been Thor's appearance in New Mexico that had led to the Chitauri's initial interest in conquering the planet, but that hadn't been the whole truth. Loki was already familiar with Earth as one of the Nine Realms of Yggdrasil, but it had been the presence of the Tesseract that had lured Loki there, which meant that it had likely been the infinity gem hidden inside the glowing blue cube that the Chitauri leaders were after when they had promised to elevate Loki to Earth's ruler. Loki had just been a pawn in their game.
He couldn't become the man who killed the Avengers because he didn't prepare enough for what was coming.
There was a long pause while Grandma studied the Air Corps poster, her lips pursed and her blue eyes troubled.
"Here you go, Tones," Rhodey said as he placed a fresh, steaming cup of coffee on the counter next to him, along with two headache pills and one of the chocolate chip muffins that he'd always loved. The sight of it was almost enough to bring Tony to tears. He had told Steve about his ridiculous obsession with those damn muffins back on their second or third date, and Steve had promised him just before he'd left on the mission that they would be one of the first things that he made for Tony once they moved into the lake house.
"So, what're you working on in here?" he asked, jerking his head towards the large canvas set up near the floor-to-ceiling windows.
"All right, that's enough," said their teacher as she stepped into the classroom. "Now then, who wants to begin the discussion regarding the formation of the European Union?"
"No!" Tony screamed as he bolted upright, sweating and panting into the semi-darkness of the bedroom. "Oh God, no, you can't—I'm not gonna let you take—!"
Tony internally rolled his eyes, crossing his arms over his front.  “Did you have an actual reason for being in here, or am I just supposed to guess?”
But Bartlett just ignored him as one of his partners stepped behind Steve, grabbing onto his upper arms. "Steve Rogers, you're under arrest for the falsification of information on your Army enlistment form. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be—"
"And that right there is exactly the problem, Steve! You don't understand! You can't see what you're doing to yourself, but I can, and honey, it's not good! And it just keeps getting worse!"
The three second pause that followed was all Steve needed. No wonder Bucky had changed his tune so quickly.
"I'm already working on a contingency plan for your boy, Tony," Phillips said. "I'd tell you not to worry but I know that's not gonna happen, so for right now I'll just leave it at that. But I promise we're not gonna just leave him there alone where he's vulnerable."
“Well, for one thing, you’ve got those big purple circles under your eyes and that greyish look to your face that you only get when you're super tired,” Peter began, pointing at Tony with his spoon.  “And two, your shirt’s on backwards.”
Just like physical injuries took time to heal, and certain injuries longer than others, Steve would be recovering from his severe PTSD for a long time to come.
Steve watched through bleary eyes as Helen Cho carefully placed her stethoscope underneath the front of Peter's hospital gown, her brow furrowing as she listened to his lungs. His fingers instinctively tightened around his son's hand as she moved the stethoscope all around his chest, his heart lurching in relief when she finally withdrew it, smiling softly.
Especially since he had driven out to that hospital so many times he likely could've done it in his sleep.
"And I know Joseph would've been too," she added as she pulled Tony into a hug, planting a kiss on his cheek. "Oh, how I wish he could've seen this!"
“Okay, honey, let’s try this, yeah?” Dad suddenly cut in.  “Try and concentrate, this is where you can change things!”
"Oh," Gwen replied as her face fell. "Um… he's been sleeping quite a bit, hasn't he? I mean, it's been four days now, and everytime I try to call he's always sleeping. Doesn't that worry… someone?"
Thanks to the raucous crowd behind him, it took a few seconds for Tony to realise that JARVIS hadn't answered him. He held up his hand, asking for everyone to shut the hell up while he repeated the question.
Scrambling to his feet in the loose sand, Peter ran back towards the monster, aiming his right fist directly for his abdomen, his jaw dropping behind his mask when his hand went right through him.
"Oh." Grandpa immediately shrank back on the hard chair as though he was trying to disappear into it. "Yeah, that's right. So they're all set then, yeah?"
One of the biggest drawbacks to having an eidetic memory, as he had hinted as much to Peter earlier that day.  Steve had spent more hours than he could count lamenting the fact that as much as he would've loved to have forgotten most of his experiences over the last twenty years, it simply was impossible for him to do so.
"Not exactly," replied Steve, low and tight as T'Challa began chanting a traditional Wakandan war chant, one his warriors answered in turn.
The cracked and leaking dam that had been holding back the raging river of Peter's emotions for most of the day finally broke, and he crumpled forward, knocking the tray aside as he collapsed into his father's arms. Dad immediately pulled him close, burying his nose into Peter's hair as his entire body shook with sobs.
"By all means, bud," answered Tony. "Just as long as you save some for Papa." Then he took Steve's face in his hands and tugged him down for another kiss, the tip of his tongue teasing along Steve's bottom lip for just a second before he pulled away.
Tony tilted his head, his fingers clutching Steve's in a white-knuckled grip. "Pete's told me the same thing. He says she's one of the only nurses who acts like she actually cares about him."
"Do you want me to come in there with you?" Peter asked. "I'd kinda like to see how your arm works too, if that's okay. I think it's really cool."
is gonna care that much about what you're wearing." said Bucky. He stepped closer, waggling his eyebrows. "Especially since there's a chance you won't be wearing anything by the time the date's over."
"Yes, but this wasn't exactly just any regular mission, right?" said Papa, and Peter could've cried at how gentle and reassuring he was. Papa was right; it hadn't been just any other mission. But not even he knew the extent as to why since Dad had been planning on telling him once the trial missions were a success.
"Okay, so let me get this straight," said Sam. "We've got this Pym guy who's running secret experiments on Stark's project, and then it goes wrong, and—"
"Dad, I know that," Peter said, muffled in Tony's shoulder. "I'm literally surrounded by superheroes, right?"
"Peter!" Papa hissed, glancing furtively down at Dad when he let out a soft whimper. "Little guy, if you'll let me get a word in here, Dad and I have already talked about this."
Tony thought, stifling a cough as his traitorous mind proceeded to immediately conjure up a mental image of Captain Rogers standing in front of him wearing nothing except for… well… no, on second thought, nothing would do just fine, thank you very much.
"Okay, so where'd he go once he got off the plane?" asked Clint. "'Cause that'd be a pretty pricey cab ride, so—"
And he did have Gwen to talk to. Peter shuddered to think how much worse off he would be if he hadn't been able to at least tell her about some of the stuff that he'd experienced. The whole spaceship and travelling to a different planet parts were actually kinda cool, but having a blaster held to his head? Being almost strangled to death? Watching as Dr Strange gave up the Time Stone to save his life?
Steve chuckled as he clapped his hand on his son's shoulder. "That's better," he said. "And when you're done, you can help me make you some scrambled eggs and pancakes, hmm?"
"Yes, he told me, and that's really nice of you," Gwen said. "He enjoys the work he's doing, and it's good for him to stay busy. He's—he's always better when he can stay busy. It helps keep his mind off of things that he can't change."
"Sorry, Dad," Peter said, wincing as he licked orange dust from his fingertips. "But I just remembered that I forgot to get you or Papa to sign my permission slip, and it's due tomorrow."
A flutter of wings outside the window caught Peter's eye, and he smiled as he saw Mrs Bird returning to her nest, a fat worm caught in her beak that was pounced on so quickly by her three chicks that she barely had time to land first.
Settling back in his chair, Steve opens his bottle of apple juice and takes a long drink, trying to figure out the easiest way to get Natasha off his back without being too rude about it.
"You're right, you know," he said, his voice quavering. "You're absolutely right, but I—I don't—I just don't know
"Gotcha," Uncle Sam said, nodding once at Uncle James before they both took off from the plain, peeling away in opposite directions. Looping around in a huge infinity symbol, Peter's heart skipped when they crossed in the middle almost directly above Thanos before flying back towards the Avengers' line. Then they paused, hovering in the air.
It was enough to make Tony want to build a suit of armour around the entire world, which he logistically could have accomplished if the newly-elected president's National Security Advisor had agreed to allow Tony to expand the capabilities of his defence drones. But, as it was, under current federal law the drones were still only able to be classified as a home defence system, and therefore could not be legally made more powerful than they currently were. At the moment, Tony's drones guarded the Tower, the Compound, and the Stark Industries building in D.C., but so far that was the extent of their reach.
Steve tipped his head, a soft smile playing on his lips as he trailed the pad of his thumb across Tony's cheekbone, sending a shiver of heat down his spine. It was incredible how worked up Tony could get from such a simple affectionate touch.
Tony watched Peter exit the lab, all skinny arms and legs topped with a mop of curly brown hair. The boy may have liked to think of himself as being older, he was a
"Your dads are both fine, kiddo," Uncle Sam said as soon as Peter climbed into the backseat, before he could even open his mouth. "They and the rest of the team just had to make an emergency trip up to the Compound, so Nat and I are gonna be in charge of keeping you alive for the evening, okay?"
"Undercover?" she said. "Yes, for about the last three years, along with a few others here and there."
"Leave it to Stevie to show us all how it's done," said Barnes. "Approaching my go/no-go in five… four… three… two… one… mark."
“Ah huh…”  Tony trailed off as tapped commands into his keyboard, accessing the program controlling the security cameras.  Not even three minutes later he had altered the code to hold onto the footage for an entire week.  “Okay, that should help a bit,” he said.  “And I also want you to send me a text every single time this warehouse is accessed, you got that?  Include the security code used and a screenshot if you can grab one.”
"Oh my God," Peter breathed as he continued to read what was essentially a mini history lesson on the evolution of HYDRA, from its beginnings centuries ago as a religious cult, worshipping something or someone called Hive, through its conversion to the draconian anti-freedom principles that were influenced by Johann Schmidt and continued on by Arnim Zola after Schmidt was defeated by Papa.
Stunned silence fell across the area, with the smooth, calm lake an ironic expression of serenity now that the battle was over, but Steve was anything but serene as he reached for his husband again.
And, to top it all off, Dad and Papa even managed to remember to soundproof their bedroom after they tucked him in later that night, something that Peter was
“Who says I’m gonna die?” Steve replied, biting back another gasp of pain.  It wasn’t a retort that was completely without backing.  While he knew that he wasn’t immortal, the studies the SSR had completed on his body mechanics after the serum combined with the numerous physicals and tests he’d had since he was found in the ice, there did seem to be a general consensus that barring any severe, non-healable injury, his life would be a long one.  He couldn’t get sick, at least not with any current or formerly existing pathogens, and any injuries he sustained usually healed within a few hours, with the few broken bones he had experienced healing in a couple of days.
"Hmm. Well, maybe that explains why HYDRA hasn't tried to invade the Tower just yet if their fastest guy got scared off by the drones," Tony muttered. And, since the drones around the Tower had a range long enough to target Peter's school, that could also help to explain why they hadn't gone after him yet either.
"Steve," Tony's voice suddenly said over the comm, low and wobbly with worry. "Steve, please, don't worry about anyone else right now, okay? You and Carol just get yourselves through."
"Mr Stark's current location is his laboratory, Captain," replied JARVIS. "Would you like me to contact him?"
gone just a teensy bit overboard, but in his mind, there was no such thing as overboard when it came to protecting his family.
“Yes, and why do you humans refer to your transport vehicles as females?” Thor asks as he sends another HYDRA soldier flying into a tree.  “I find that rather… curious.”
Before Peter could regain his bearings, the image dissolved into pixels again, reforming to show Papa and Uncle Bucky in another, smaller hospital room, one that Peter guessed Uncle Bucky was in right before his surgery.  Image Papa’s right hand was wrapped in a thick bandage, and Peter’s heart lurched as he watched him rake his left hand through his hair, yanking so hard on the strands that he let out a soft cry.
"I guess I'm okay with it as long as we can station guards by the theatre," Papa finally said. He glanced back to look at Peter. "But only if Uncle Bucky can go with you, so you'll still need to ask him."
"Tony," he said again, low and thick against Tony's neck as Tony's fingers combed through his sweat-dampened hair. "Tony, I love you!"
“Oh no,” Peter said with a rather mischievous smirk.  “My dad’s only a little bit mad, and not at all about chess.”
“That's my man,” Dad said proudly.  He pressed a quick kiss to Papa’s hand, over his wedding ring.  “All right, honey.  Show us how it goes.”
Now, the United States on the other hand, with how many members of upper-level government and law enforcement that were already under HYDRA's rule, the team couldn't really rule out anywhere as a possible hiding place for Steve's prison.
But then he broke away, giving Tony an apologetic smile as he kissed the tip of his nose. "I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I really need to get going. But I'd love it if you stayed here till I got back. I'm sure you're not usually up this early, are you?"
Peter repeated the mantra three more times before slowly opening his eyes, sucking in a deep breath as he tipped his head to the side to glance up at the clock, which had continued with its incessant ticking as if it was its soul purpose for existence. With an annoyed huff, Peter rolled his eyes and dragged his attention back to studying Gwen's hair. His patience with school wasn't often the greatest anyway, but it had been even worse ever since they came home from Wakanda. Most of it was jealousy, as petty as that was. The technology that Shuri and her family had access to down in Wakanda was just so advanced that there was no way the Stark-influenced tech and equipment Peter used at Midtown could compare.
“I believe the more modern term would be ‘freezer’, Thor,” replies Steve.  “Icebox is what we used to call the machines that kept food cold back in my—”
Uncle Sam let out one of his goofy laughs. "Well, when you're the youngest kid in this grand madhouse, that's kinda how it's gotta be." He glanced back, smirking when Peter glared at him. "Oh, come on. I highly doubt that anything we've said is gonna change anything. Isn't that right, Miss Stacy?"
"Will you come to bed with me? Please?" Steve asked as he wound his arms around Tony's waist, drawing him flush against him. He could feel his own body relaxing as the warmth of the arc reactor radiated through their t-shirts, and his ears picked up its comforting hum. "I always sleep better when you're with me."
"Exactly. And Peter will come around eventually. Deep down he knows that we love him and want what's best for him. He's just got such a big heart, all he wants is to help people."
"Get! Off! Of! Me!" Peter cried as his free leg flailed wildly, finally connecting directly with the sand monster's head and sending him flying out towards the water, his bellowing roar as he splashed into the ocean echoing across the foggy island. Peter winced as the water literally tore the man apart, guilt piercing his heart.
"Shh," Steve whispered, brushing his lips across Tony's nose and then his lips as he started to gently sway, tucking Tony's right hand against his chest. "Just… dance with me for awhile, let's not think about it now. JARVIS, can you turn up the volume of the music, please?"
Grumbling as he shifted in the chair yet again, Tony glanced down at his nanite case, contemplating whether to try and record a message for Steve. More than likely it would just end up being yet another exercise in futility, as the ship had been adrift for the last three days, and even with the distress signal broadcasting, they had seen no other sign of intelligent life anywhere.
"Pardon me, sir, but Agent Romanoff is on the line," JARVIS said, startling Tony so badly that he knocked over his coffee cup, splashing the burning hot liquid all over his hand and several of Bruce's handwritten notebooks.
"Well… yeah, I guess," admitted Peter. "But that's mainly 'cause we're still learning the whole experiment process, and—"
Tucking Peter's blankets up to his neck, Tony pecked a quick kiss on his forehead and headed out of his room towards the lab, where he found everyone crowded around Bruce's workstation and Bucky holding a copy of a Russian-English dictionary that looked to be at least a hundred years old.
"Yeah, well, before you I thought the only halfway decent pilots were Rhodey and Carol, so I think we've both learned a thing or two." Tony tilted his head, brushing a soft kiss across Steve's lips. While the rain hadn't slowed down at all, the sky had grown almost completely dark just in the last few minutes, which meant that the nightly curfew would be starting soon. "Is it okay if we finish this conversation once we get back? It's getting pretty close to Pete's bedtime, and—"
Tossing his glasses onto the counter, Tony scrubbed his palm down his face, his heart thudding and his shoulders and neck aching from having to listen to Steve literally fight his way out of the atmosphere.
It also gave him an unabashed opportunity to watch Steve's face as he orgasmed without being distracted by his own pleasure. Steve was so gorgeous when he came, and the fact that Tony was the only person to ever see him in the throes of climax was so unbelievably hot that he could barely stand it.
"The arc reactors would need to be built with vibranium instead of palladium," Tony cut in. "Otherwise we'll have to be constantly swapping them out."
Steve sighed, his worry wrinkle on full display. "I don't know. When he first woke up I noticed right away that his grip seemed pretty strong, and it seems like his hearing is a bit more sensitive too." He dropped his head, letting out a heavy sigh. "I know your father said that he wasn't going to turn Peter into a super-soldier, but I'm starting to wonder if he did anyway. Maybe not quite to my extent, but… if he's still growing, Tony, then—"
Steve grinned, giving him a quick, "Yes, sir," as he pulled off his t-shirt. As Steve settled over him, Tony took hold of his shoulders, delighting in the soft skin and hard muscle beneath his palms as he tugged Steve's face down so he could kiss him. They were both already hard, their erections rubbing deliciously together through the fabric of their pants as Steve's hand slid underneath Tony's ass, pressing him even closer to him.
"Seemed like forever, but it was probably about three or four minutes." He started to lift Steve into the water, halting when Steve cried out in pain and fear as soon as it splashed against him. "Is it supposed to hurt him?"
Bruce let out a frustrated groan as his screen suddenly flickered, erasing all the text on it. "No offence Tony, but can you leave me alone with this for a bit? I need to concentrate."
As soon as Natasha exited the lab, Steve turned back to the screen, still scrolling with name after name. He watched for a moment, then had to look away, too overwhelmed by the sheer number of missing.
"There, there," said the woman as his coughs finally subsided. She nudged Peter's bottom lip with the water glass. "Ready for a drink now?"
"Probably only had to once," said Bucky. "That's all Stevie ever has to read anything, the lucky bastard."
With a frustrated sigh, Tony checked the time.  Steve had told him that he sometimes used Sunday and Monday mornings to run errands, so there was a chance that he was out doing other things.
Tony's bottom lip trembled as he nodded, knowing full well that Steve couldn't even see him. "Steve, of course I'll marry you," he whispered. "Did you honestly think there was any way that I could say no?"
“No, I should’ve made it more clear,” Steve says firmly.  “And for that, I am sorry.”  He presses a kiss to Tony’s forehead.  “Now, will you please try and sleep?  I’m here.  I've got you.  You're safe.”
"Yeah, well, that's why Sam is Sam, and I'm… not," Tony muttered. He tightened his arms around Steve, weaving his fingers through his hair and inhaling the incredible scent of his skin, letting it permeate throughout his body like a calming drug.
"Mr Stark's current location is his laboratory, Captain," JARVIS finished, anticipating Steve's next question. "Shall I tell him when to expect you?"
"Yeah, but then who's building the stuff on the other side?" asked Tony. "'Cause even though it may look easy to just copy a design, it is not as simple as it seems."
"Yeah, okay," Tony whispered. He pressed a soft kiss to Steve's lips, tilting his head as he smirked. "But I'm not exactly sure how watching all you guys stuff your faces full of pizza is supposed to be enjoyable."
Following Carol's lead, Steve launched into a series of barrel rolls and short dives, acclimatising to the stick's sensitivity as the aircraft manoeuvred through the air as though it weighed practically nothing. As soon as he felt comfortable with the stick he gritted his teeth and aimed the aircraft forward, directly towards the DMZ line that marked the border of Langaran airspace.
"You'll be able to handle it," Rhodey said softly, looking up from his datapad. Apparently Tony was now to the point where he was speaking his thoughts instead of just thinking them. "I know you will."
"We don't know yet, Tony says the scientists are still studying the data," Steve said. "All we know is that this time it wasn't in Wakanda, it was in Namibia."
"Mmm," Tony grumbled under his breath, prompting Steve to squeeze his hand. He knew where Tony was coming from, but he could also understand the rather difficult position that T'Challa was in. Sharing his country's resources with only the U.S., or even just with their team, would no doubt result in outcries from nearly every other modernised country, and that was not something Wakanda was willing to deal with.
"Well, that makes me feel a bit better," Steve said as the doors to the penthouse elevator slid open. "I'll let you know about the game, okay?"
"Yeah, so far that's the current plan." Peter knew Uncle Thor and Uncle Bucky were looking forward to the trip, as long as Uncle Thor's brother didn't cause any more trouble in the meantime. He'd been having to return to Asgard almost every week lately to take care of something or other regarding Loki, which was pretty amazing considering that Loki was still imprisoned for his role in the Chitauri invasion.
"Here we go," Peter said under his breath, watching through his eyelashes as Papa shifted on his feet, his cheeks already flushing pink.
Steve said on a gasp as Tony slowly glided his shorts and underwear down his legs and onto the floor. Steve hissed as Tony's nimble fingers wrapped around his aching erection, his back nearly arching off the bed as Tony's lips teased the burning hot skin of his thighs and pelvis while he stroked him.
"And then, if you guys can figure it out, we could try and fix things," Steve whispered. "Scott said that since time works differently inside this Quantum Realm, and so if we could figure out how to navigate it, we could then reverse the snap and bring people home."
Was Steve even still alive, or had he been blown to dust too? What about Rhodey? Or Nat, or Bruce, or any of the others?
"Don't look at me, you're the expert on all this stuff," Phillips said. "If your artificial smart-talking thing-a-ma-jig says that they're ready, then I've got no choice but to trust you."
No.  The only swimmers Steve feels could challenge him for the gold are his teammate Bucky, and Alexei Shostakov, the new champion from Russia who seems hell-bent on taking over the loud-mouthed jerk slot from Johann Schmidt.  Steve narrows his eyes, studying Shostakov’s face as he laughs at something Batroc said, and wondering how it’s possible that there could be another 100 freestyle swimmer who’s as bullish and arrogant as Schmidt was.
"Mmm," muttered Steve. Asking his ma questions about either money or Howard Stark was usually a recipe for disaster. "Yeah, I guess. I just… those kinds of conversations don't ever go over very well."
He was cut off as the fireball suddenly appeared directly above them, smashing straight into the main SHIELD building about fifty metres away. The blastwave was enough to knock Peter and Gwen off their feet, sending them both flying across the roof. Gwen screamed as Peter landed on the very edge of the roof, clutching Gwen's hand so hard he feared he might break it.
"And Tony," said Steve. "You should watch the two of them sometime when they're working together. It's like they're speaking a whole different language."
"This was my room when I was a kid, little guy," he said as he set Peter down on his old bed, tucking him under the covers. "So I hope you'll be comfy here."
"Seeing as how they made Iron Legion Halloween costumes this past October, I'm not sure how you can say that people are frightened of them, Senator," Tony replied. "And to answer your question, yes, I do believe it is absolutely necessary to continue guarding the convoys. As I said earlier, I don't believe that Toomes was working alone, and until we're able to get him to talk and find out who else was involved, we can't be too careful."
"There's a federal marshall waiting for you and Captain Rogers on the tarmac, sir, she says she has something important to give you," he said. "I asked her what it was but she wouldn't tell me, I don't know what you wanna do."
Gwen didn't know that he'd once been the Winter Soldier, though. There were still a few secrets in Peter's family that were too dangerous to tell, no matter how much Peter trusted her. Even though Uncle Bucky's record had been completely expunged of all traces that could connect to him being the Winter Soldier, the team had decided that they couldn't be too careful, especially with the possibility—however remote—of there still being more HYDRA agents out there somewhere.
But, if he knew that doing so was the best way to keep Tony and Peter from possible harm, then he would do it without question. He was a husband and a father, and it was his duty to keep his family safe no matter how much Tony decided to protest.
The aftermath of that horrible time, when even a four-week-old Peter seemed to notice that things had suddenly gone horribly, horribly wrong, is still a bit fuzzy in Tony’s mind.  The sheer cacophony of emotions he experienced, emotions that began with abject disbelief and numbness and quickly morphed into devastation and pure, unrelenting anger, all while being forced to care for a baby who still believed that nights were for screaming instead of sleeping and who wouldn’t sleep at all unless he was literally tied to Tony’s chest, was by far the hardest thing he’s ever been through.
"Oh, man," Quill said, his head tilting towards Gamora as he began to blow apart, his hand clinging to hers until the very last second.
"Um… excuse me, Doctor, but do you have any idea why my dad and the others just up and disappeared? 'Cause it seems a bit weird, actually more like
Barely a second later the missile exploded a shower of sparks and flame, the resulting shockwave sending a violent shimmy through Steve's aircraft.
“So… what was that all about?” Natasha suddenly asks from outside the wall, sending Steve’s heart rocketing to his throat.  In almost a year of working together, Steve still isn’t used to how quietly his co-worker can move about the office.  Natasha says it’s because she trained as a ballet dancer from a young age, and so was taught how to take very light steps, but Steve also has a sneaking suspicion that she thinks it’s funny whenever she startles him.
"All right," Steve said quietly. Peter's condition hadn't gone unnoticed by Steve either, and Tony knew that it not only worried him, it angered him that he was so helpless to do anything about it.
Steve ended up cajoling Tony to stay in bed for three days, a full twenty-four hours after his fever finally broke for good and the skin-crawling rasp in his breathing finally faded into oblivion. It took all of his powers of persuasion—and a blowjob—to keep Tony from leaping from the bed as soon as JARVIS announced that he was fever-free, but Steve wanted to be extra cautious.
The smell hit Tony before he even crossed the threshold, an absolutely disgusting combination of stale whisky, burnt food, and body odour that Tony was shocked hadn't yet summoned at least one of their nosy neighbours. The inside also felt like it was at least forty degrees, the trapped heat causing the dense, stale air to hover chest-high, almost like a fog.
Tony tapped his fingers on the counter as he waited for Carol's communication frequency to change, letting out a heavy sigh once she was gone.
"But that's exactly what you think!" Peter snapped, squashing his polar bear into a lumpy ball. "You both think she's just inviting me over so her dad can ask me a bunch of questions about you and the team, don't you! Because it just couldn't be because she thinks I'm cool and wants to hang out, no, it has to be all about you guys!"
Rhodey grinned. "Oh, hell no. She sleeps like garbage on a normal day, so… maybe a couple hours or so, but she's always been like a ball of pure energy. I can barely keep up sometimes."
noise that his webs made as they shot out was such a satisfying sound. "I'm pretty sure this is an all-hands-on-deck type of situation."
"Ned, why don't you back off a bit, okay?" Gwen said, politely but firmly. "From what my dad told me that place where they were keeping Captain Rogers was pretty awful, and I'm sure Peter doesn't really want to have to think about it more than he has to."
Running his bone-dry tongue across his lips, Steve attempts to swallow as he pushes himself up on one elbow.
Tony dropped his head, chuckling as he set his stuff back down on the counter. Of all the days for Steve to go running late…
As it turned out, Dr Strange wouldn't have been able to do anything for Peter anyway, and not getting him involved ended up saving his dads from having to explain Peter's genetic mutation and enhancements to yet another person outside their family.
Huffing out a sharp breath, Tony scrubbed at his eyes and reached for his coffee cup, grimacing as the bitter, lukewarm liquid hit his tongue.  Apparently it was time for another refill.
As always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗  If you have any special requests on what you might like to see in the final chapter, please let me know! 💗
The pizza was delicious, hot and gooey and covered in toppings, and once Peter had finished his third slice and downed his second cup of Dr Pepper, he was even able to smile as the girls continued their gushing over Thor and Captain America.
"And frequency," said Major Kowalski, raising his bushy eyebrows. "There was quite a bit of chatter about that too."
And now, if Tony’s right and they really are trapped here in this Twilight Zone-esque place, then that means there’s a real possibility that Steve’s going to be responsible for losing not only his own life, but also for Peter losing his father.
"Tony, what are you saying? I'm not—" He gave his head a quick shake, trying to look around Tony at Peter. "Peter? Little guy, are you all right? What're you doing here, this place is dangerous!"
"Huh?" said Uncle Bucky, his eyebrows knitting into a frown. "What the hell's that supposed to mean?"
"Well, only kinda wrong," said Bucky. "I mean, their goal was to take out the power plant, right? They wanted to plunge the country into darkness."
Setting his notebook down on his lap, Peter sucked in a raggedy breath and closed his eyes. He'd skipped his usual early afternoon snooze that day in the hopes that Steve would show up, but by the time he'd decided that Steve wasn't coming it was almost dinnertime, which meant that if Dad was going to visit it would be within the next half an hour or so. Peter was still looking forward to the time when Dad and Steve could show up together, maybe even sometime after curfew since Steve could act as Dad's military escort. Steve had promised Peter that he was going to tell Dad about his visits soon and Peter believed him, but he wasn't going to bug him about it. Grandpa had bugged and poked and prodded Dad about just about everything while Peter was little, and after watching their already sucky relationship deteriorate even further as he got sicker and sicker, Peter was determined never to do that to Dad.
"Uh huh," Peter said. He laid back against the pillows, taking the exaggerated breaths that Ms Sharon had always asked for when she listened to him.
"Okay, let's see here…" Tony said as he skimmed over the introduction, finally getting to the main part of the proposal.
"Copy that!" said Dad as Peter launched one of his splitter webs at Thanos' chest. As soon as it latched, Peter jumped behind him, trying to hold him in place long enough for Dr Strange to get his hand open. Peter jumped as his spider-legs deployed again, helping him keep his footing as Quill suddenly flew in, attaching one of his cool electrical devices to Thanos' other hand.
"But I don't wanna talk about that now," Peter cut in. He pulled his notebook out from under his blankets, flipping to a page titled
Blaster Guy paused, his grip on Peter's neck wavering ever so slightly until he was able to regain his composure. Gritting his teeth, he pressed the tip of the blaster even harder into Peter's temple. "I swear to God, if you don't tell me what the hell you're doing here, I'm gonna French fry this little freak!"
"I do, Mr Wilson," said T'Challa. "In Wakanda we call it the Ancestral Plane, the place where the soul settles after death."
"Yeah, I know that. But you also know that I'm gonna worry about you anyway," Steve said, rather petulantly. "I just can't help it. Not after—"
"But you can't promise that, honey. No one can," Tony whispered. "Which is why I'm gonna make sure that when that space army does finally come knocking on our door, we're as ready as possible."
Once again he waited for what seemed like an eternity, and was just about to give up and try and figure out something else when suddenly the red-haired girl appeared off to the side, her arms wrapped around her front and her shoulders shaking in fear.
"Hey, Nat," answered Steve. He wasn't really in the mood for company, but he wasn't about to tell her that. "What's up?"
"And serve your country you did, Captain," piped up one of the senators from the back row, a middle-aged man from Montana or Wyoming, Tony couldn't quite recall. "I still have all of my father's Captain America comic books that he left me when he passed. All in mint condition, I might add!"
"Please," Steve said, begging now. "I just need—need to forget for awhile, sweetheart. Need to empty my mind and just
"Yeah." Stacy paused, glancing down the block towards the movie theatre. "I mean, I know they're still very young and all, but… well… like you said, Peter is a very polite and honourable young man, so—"
"Thank you." Steve turned back to Scott, who was glancing between Steve and Natasha like he was watching a volleying tennis ball. "Scott, how 'bout we show you to one of the guest rooms? Let you get cleaned up? Maybe take a nap?"
"Tony," Steve said as he tilted his head up to meet Tony's lips, his fingers threading through Tony's hair to hold him in place as Tony let out a soft whimper. As a matter of fact, a big part of the reason for Steve's impatience with his healing injuries was because he wanted Tony so badly that at times he could barely concentrate on anything else, but absolutely did not feel comfortable with Tony doing all the work since he was hurt as well.
—Tony to take care of him. And he also knew that Tony would do so eagerly, because he loved Steve beyond reason.
"All right, babe, we're all set," Tony said as he joined the circle, shooting Steve an encouraging wink. "Whenever you're ready."
Mr Stacy stared at Peter while he chewed, and Peter held his gaze, almost daring him to look away. "And who would get to decide if he can join the Avengers? Captain Rogers?"
Finally, after the pause that followed Sam’s statement stretched out almost interminably, Obie’s lips twitched, and he shifted, taking hold of the back of his chair like he was trying to use it as a shield.
"Okay, so anything else?" he asked. "'Cause I'm pretty sure you just used at least three minutes of your allotted one."
"Hello, Mr Stacy," Steve replied. "And yes, this is Peter's Uncle James, who will be accompanying Peter and Gwen to the movies."
Grinning, Steve reached for his notebook and pencil. "I sure did," he said as he flipped to a clean page. "Would you like to draw something with me?"
"What the hell was all that about?" he hissed as they made their way towards the hangar. "If I didn't know any better I could've sworn that you we're trying to flirt, but—"
“You better get a hustle on your homework, yeah, bud?” Tony says once they arrive in their building’s parking garage.  “It’s getting late.”
"Which, if I may remind you, sir, is extremely unlikely," JARVIS piped up, sounding rather petulant. "In fact, I estimate the chances of it at less than 0.00000001 percent."
Tony pursed his lips, his fists clenching and unclenching at his sides.  He was used to getting into the occasional financial disagreement with Obie, especially when it involved their military contracts.  But this seemed like more than that.
"Yes, it is," Shuri said, smiling as she held up her hand in a perfect imitation of the traditional Vulcan salute. "I assume you understand what this means, do you not, Peter Stark-Rogers?"
"Yeah," Steve said with wide eyes. "Basically how it went was, I stripped down to my waist, they gave me a bunch of shots, and then set up this kind of infusion device inside what looked like an old missile casing. Once they closed me inside it the infusion device activated, sending the serum into my major muscle groups, and then a few seconds later I got bombarded with some kind of radiation."
And maybe even have enough left over to cover the surgery for his bum shoulder that Steve’s been putting off for the last three years.
"Now, you know that's not the smartest of ideas!" Tony called as the two boys took off, holding up his hand to block the dust kicking up from Pietro's blink-and-you'll-miss-him exit. "Ah, like they'll ever listen to us."
Rage flooded Steve's body so intensely at the sight of that horrible, despicable man leering over his son that he literally saw red. His belly gave a violent swoop as he gritted his teeth, trying to hold himself together as Peter let out a frightened squeak next to him, squeezing his hand so hard that Steve's knuckles popped.
"I think you've been hanging around Peter a bit too much there, Buck," Steve said, chuckling as he started heading towards Tony's lab, and the landing pad next to it that housed their Quinjet. The three of them had just stepped through the outside doors and onto the pad when the sky suddenly lit up with one of the brightest bolts of lightning that Steve had ever seen, causing him to cry out as he brought his shield up to cover his eyes. Behind him, he heard Bucky swear, cursing one of the local weathermen or something when all the hair on the back of Steve's neck suddenly stood up.
A knot rose in Tony's throat as he nodded, eyeing Steve through his lashes. "How in the hell do you do that?"
"Aw, man! Are you guys being all smooshy again?" Peter said as he reappeared, fishing pole and tackle box in-hand.
Steve's head was spinning, his stomach so clenched he felt like he might be sick as he forced himself to look at the computer screen again, wishing he could read Russian and at the same time grateful that he couldn't.
Hurrying back to his quarters, Steve readied for bed, setting his alarm for 0520, an entire hour later than usual due to the new class replacing his typical 0600 morning briefing. Ten minutes to wake up and get dressed, forty minutes for his morning run, ten minutes to shower, thirty minutes to eat breakfast, and then on to class.
Tony shook his head, scrubbing a palm down his face. "No, Toomes was a salvage contractor, not an engineer. And he's been in holding too long to have been involved with this."
"Shall we?" he asked Gwen, holding out his elbow for her to take. His heart gave a flutter when she smiled that smile that always made her pretty green eyes sparkle, taking his arm with a flourish.
"Come in," Tony croaked. He removed his glasses, rubbing at his stinging eyes as a young, blonde-haired nurse entered the room, her pretty face twisted in sympathy.
On his next inhale, Steve lowers his hands to the block, splaying his fingers out slightly before curling them over the edge.  Releasing his breath, he eases back, his knuckles going white as he waits for the blast of the starting gun.  His entire field of vision narrows to the clear blue water enclosed by the red and white lane markers, and the crisp black line painted along the bottom.
"I just like hearing you say it," Steve whispered. Then he carefully palmed Tony's ass cheeks and dipped his tongue inside.
The thought of their son having to go through that awful procedure… their sweet boy who loved to draw and climb trees, who had the biggest, most beautiful brown eyes that Steve had ever seen, the exact same shade of brown as his father's… the sweet boy who called Steve 'Papa' having to experience such agonising pain…
"Okay," Peter said again, feeling very much like one of Papa's old records that had gotten stuck. "Um—"
And maybe, just maybe, Steve would now be able to let go of some of the guilt he'd been carrying ever since the Miami battle.
"Um…" he stammered, gasping again at a particularly horrible twinge of pain. He pushed himself back from the table, calling out a belated, "Please excuse me," as he stumbled towards the hallway bathroom, managing to make it just in time to barf up the entire contents of his stomach into the toilet.
Before Steve could even react Tony had torn himself free, rushing over to their son and tucking his head against his chest.
“Hey, JARVIS?  Could you look and see if there are any of the neurological drug trials that’re still accepting patients?” he asked.  “I know someone who might be interested.”
“Okay, so… it looks like everything’s good here with the documents, so unless someone’s got something else to add, I don't know ‘bout the rest of you, but I’m ready to get this whole shakedown thing over with.”
A low growl escaped Steve's throat as he dipped his head to kiss Tony again, deliberately keeping it chaste even though his entire body was screaming at him to take it further. "You are incorrigible, you know."
"No!" he croaked, completely frozen in place as Tony gritted his teeth, his entire body shaking with the effort of controlling the stones.
In fact, Steve was almost certain that he saw Anthony lick his lips right before he turned away, sending a shock of heat across Steve's chest. Had he been standing up there all that time just waiting for him to return?
Apparently the nanotech suits really did make that much of a difference. Peter's reaction time, which was already lightning-fast, seemed to be even faster with his new suit, allowing him to dodge projectiles and evade capture even as he kept up his usual running commentary. Steve and Tony had both tried to explain that verbally taunting the enemy during a battle maybe wasn't the smartest idea, but it seemed like Peter just couldn't help himself, and since it hadn't gone against him yet, they had ultimately decided to just let it go.
Which Steve supposes is just as well.  Even though he liked his old one since it meant he didn't have to re-shave his chest every other day, and it helped him to achieve a world-record time, there’s no way he could have afforded a new one for this Olympics.  Even with his TYR contract.
Even more not cool. Especially since he couldn't ask for more details without giving away the fact that he was having nightmares, something he did
Obie’s upper lip twitched, his grip on Tony’s shoulder growing even tighter.  “It’s not that I’m pissed off, Tony, as you say,” he said, even as his low, raspy voice indicated the exact opposite.  “It’s just that I don't like getting blindsided by stuff like this.  You know I like being kept in the loop, and—”
“I had—I had these prepared before—before I left on the mission, and I just—”  Steve paused again, clearing his throat as Peter glanced down at the first page, his eyebrows disappearing under his curls as he read it.
"No, no, it's nothing like that," Peter assured her. He pulled off his glasses, rubbing at his eyes with his knuckles. "I'm just—I'm sorry, Gwen, but I really gotta talk to my dads first, all right? I promise I'll tell you as soon as I can."
"All right," he said as he plunked himself down onto the couch, opposite from Tony. "So, who wants to go first?"
"Uhh…" Peter bit his lip, just now realising that he was asking JARVIS to help him find a building that was supposedly invisible. JARVIS was really good at a lot of things, but even he probably wouldn't be able to locate a building cloaked with HYDRA retro-reflective tech.
“Good.”  Releasing Tony’s shoulders, Steve lays back, grunting as a twinge of burning pain shoots up his leg.  Even with the serum, he’s not going to be able to help much with any reconnaissance, which means he’s going to have to rely on Tony for pretty much everything.
And with that, Steve felt his entire body relax, because of course Tony knew he preferred to make love face-to-face.  That’s how they’d always done it.
"There's still one more down inside it," Bucky said as he yanked Steve back just in time to avoid his foot getting caught in the hatch as it slammed shut. "Actually, make that two."
"You're right, sweetheart," Steve whispered as he pulled Tony onto his lap, burying his face in his neck. "He does deserve that. Both he and Bucky deserve to be free of it, but—I just—I just don't know if I'm—if I'm strong enough—if it doesn't work, and we
"Hmph," grumbled Mr Stacy. "Following rules. And which rules does he follow, exactly? Who gets to decide what rules the Avengers follow, hmm?"
"The cop, Stacy, he's keeping an eye on Стив while we try to figure out how to get him outta his box," said Uncle Bucky. "But by my count, we've still got about ten or so of these damn things left so it might be awhile."
"Yeah," said Tony. "Yeah, that's—that's fine. I just—" He pressed a kiss to the top of Peter's head, squeezing him one final time. "I just—I just needed to make sure you were okay, bud. That's all."
It felt as though an hour had passed by the time he had regained some semblance of feeling in his limbs, peeling his eyelids open to find Tony resting his chin in the curve of his hip, a very self-satisfied grin on his face.
He’s so happy and exuberant that Steve can’t help but laugh.  “It was just fine, little guy, thanks for asking.  And you can call me Steve, remember?”
He'd even confessed to Steve the night before that he had a son, something he'd been dreading telling him ever since their first date. But instead of freaking out like he'd expected, Steve had actually seemed excited, telling Tony that he was very much looking forward to meeting him.
Tony nodded, relaxing his shoulders the way Steve had taught him during their sparring lessons. Then he tapped the container twice with his fingers and closed his eyes, his breath hitching as the holographic nanites began to emerge from the container, expanding across his chest and down his arms and legs, with the helmet locking into position a few seconds later. For a moment, Tony was frozen in place, afraid to move in case he suddenly lost nanite coalescence.
Stifling a yawn, Peter headed straight for the virtual deposit box where Dad had tried to safeguard JARVIS's programming. Since Peter had designed most of JARVIS in the first place, he already had his own unique set of passwords and encryption codes that allowed him full access to the program without compromising Dad's information, or even revealing that he was in there at all.
"Oh. 'Cause that doesn't sound ominous or anything," James muttered. "Maybe you ought to add that part to your bedtime story, hmm?"
“You close at what, seven?” Tony asked, grateful when his voice didn't wobble.  “I can be here at five till, and JARVIS can have our food waiting for us when we get to the Tower.”
child!" yelled Dad. He huffed out a sharp breath as he took hold of Peter's shoulders with shaking hands. "You're
"No, it's not," Dad interrupted. "But… gods, Pete, you're only eleven. You shouldn't even have to know any of this stuff, much less be concerned about it."
about when we'll talk about it? That's just code for 'we'll see', which is just another way of saying 'no', isn't it?"
"Yeah, I guess that makes sense," Peter said as he carefully eased onto the street. It wasn't quite rush hour yet, so the traffic was fairly minimal. "That last battle was a bit of a doozy, so I guess I can give them a pass this time."
"Hey, Peter!" a kind voice suddenly said, startling Peter such that he jumped backwards and knocked the back of his head against the swinging locker door.
And the worst part of it was, Tony still had no idea where HYDRA had taken Steve, or even if he was still alive.
"And I know he's never wondered that for a single moment, Tony," Steve said quickly. "Not a single one."
Hurrying over to Gwen, Peter stopped short as she gave Dad and Uncle Bruce a sort of shy wave, letting out a high-pitched squeal as Dad drove away.
"Hold on, that was you?" Tony asked, scowling. "And what the hell were you doing with Peter? I told you to stay away from him!"
“Please!” he cried into the frigid night air, barely audible over the bloodcurdling groan.  “Please, make it stop!”
“But it’s only a half a block away, Dad!  Like I can literally see it from the parking lot!”  Peter rolled his eyes, tugging on the strap of his backpack.  He was thirteen, for heaven’s sake, not three, and could more than handle a half a block walk without holding his daddy’s hand.
"Ahh, how 'bout we start with some soup or something like that, hmm?" said Tony. "No sense in having it all come right back up again."
“Think of it as like a do-over, Papa,” added Peter.  “Instead of you being angry and storming off like you’ve told us, you can tell Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky that you just need to go somewhere else for a while.”
Gwen smiled that smile that never failed to send warm fuzzies shooting through Peter's body like confetti, and always made him grin like a complete fool right back.
Standing to his feet, Tony pulled out his phone. "JARVIS, exactly how much does Mr Lang here owe in back child support?"
Steve shook his head, sucking more air into his hungry lungs as he released the iron grip on his knees and glanced down to where Tony was lying next to him, curled onto his right side like he usually was. For a moment, Steve could only stare at him, certain that his eyes were trying to trick him as he raised his hand and placed it carefully on Tony's shoulder, a choked sob of relief tearing from his throat as he realised that no, Tony wasn't just a figment of his imagination. He was actually real.
And the fact that he'd literally ran into Anthony earlier hadn't helped either. Not in the slightest.
He heard Dad pull out his phone. "JARVIS, any info you can give me on a New York City policeman, last name Stacy?"
“Gee, thanks,” Tony muttered.  He didn't particularly enjoy being reminded of how old he was, preferring to remain in his self-induced semi-ignorant bliss, even as he was forced to watch as his beloved little boy grew taller and taller.
"Ah, maybe Obie hired him," he added. "Like I said, I'll take a look and let you know if I find anything wonky."
And every single night, as Steve carried Tony's limp, skinny body from Peter's room to their bed, he begged the universe to help him. To give him the strength that he needed to keep going, just long enough for his husband to decide to come back to him. While Steve had never really subscribed to the same Catholic teachings that his ma had held so dear, he had absolutely no doubt that if there was any such thing as purgatory, he was currently living through it.
Peter grinned, reaching for the chessboard under the table. "Do you remember the first time we ever played?"
And then he was there, standing in front of Steve, his polished red and gold armour shining brightly even in the dim light of the bunker. HYDRA had altered his suit design, making it bulkier with more obvious weaponry, similar to James' War Machine armour, and the mask was shaped into the most menacing frown that Steve had ever seen, but Steve still knew it was him. There was no way that Hammer would go through his whole song and dance routine if it wasn't.
"Oh, shit," he muttered as he noticed the shiny, oily puddle spreading across the redrock ground. The fuel was indeed leaking, just as he'd feared. Based on the size of the puddle, it at least appeared to be a slow leak rather than a fast one, which hopefully meant it would be easier to fix. But Tony also had a feeling that Quill was the type of guy to let the tank get down to near zero before refilling it—which, to be honest, so was Tony—and with no way to know just where the gauge was sitting before the ship got hit, well… it was definitely going to be a crap shoot.
"Well, that's just too damn bad," said Tony, rather triumphantly. "'Cause at the moment I don't see that he has a choice."
to their son's head that he would've been just as scared out of his wits as Tony—and been just as livid afterwards—but Steve also would have realised that now that the standoff was over, they needed to put it behind them and focus on the task at hand.
Popping open the ibuprofen bottle, Steve dry-swallows four of the oval-shaped gelcaps as he crosses the street and heads down the block towards the towering entrance gates for Empire State University.  As he walks, students peel out of the row houses that flank either side of the old-fashioned-looking street, falling in around him as they trek towards the ritzy, hoity-toity school.
And he was even more immensely grateful for what he knew awaited he and his drop-dead gorgeous husband once they got home.
name one of his UIs after the man who had manipulated him, tormented him, and then tried to not only kill him, but also Peter and Papa more than once. There was just no possible way.
Steve's legs were aching, his eyes stinging with the sweat pouring in rivulets off his forehead as he rounded the corner towards the barracks at breakneck speed. The still-rising sun was directly in his eyes, and he squinted as he lowered his head and pumped his arms, trying as hard as he could to stay ahead of all of the disturbing thoughts that had been chasing him ever since his rather tense discussion with Colonel Phillips the previous evening.
Tony dropped his head, stroking his fingers through Peter's hair. "I know, bud, and I am so, so sorry. I wish I could make all of this just go away."
"Um," he started, breaking off when even that tiny word seemed to get stuck. He painfully cleared his throat, straightening his shoulders.
It also made sense that the Time Stone would be particularly important to protect, since it could literally turn back time—
"Yes!" Scott exclaimed, wagging his index finger towards Steve. "Yes, Captain, that's exactly it. The Quantum Realm is a place. It's a place where—where I just—" He broke off, running a shaky hand through his hair. "I mean—"
Steve grinned, guzzling down the rest of his Powerade. Peter knew how to make himself a more substantial breakfast than cold cereal, but, like his father, he was often too sleepy or too distracted in the mornings to reach for anything other than his usual.
And once they were back, safe and sound in their Tower penthouse, with Steve's healing foot carefully propped up on pillows on their bed and he and Peter cuddled up in his arms, Tony laid his head down against Steve's chest and closed his eyes, finally allowing his tense, exhausted body to relax for the first time in over a month.
"Now, Peter," ordered Steve, softening his words with a gentle hand on his son's shoulder. "Please."
"Mmm," muttered Papa. He glanced down at Peter, and Peter responded with a slight shake of the head. This wasn't something for them to get into yet another argument over, especially since Dad had just said the D.C. site was almost done. They'd been bickering enough lately about Dad's heath as it was.
"Hey, little guy!" Steve said as he swept into the room, sketchbook and pencil in hand and a wide smile on his face. "How're you doing today?"
"Dad?" Peter said, causing Tony's belly to flip as he swung across the vast plain, his web latched onto one of the whales' front right fins. "Dad, who's that giant dude? He kinda reminds me of that Gulliver guy from that one book."
"I'm trying, Pete!" Dad shouted as his helmet closed over his head. Peter yelped as they crashed through the remains of a star-shaped building, his own mask closing over his head as Dr Strange stepped forward, generating some kind of huge golden shield that encased the cockpit like a dome. The ship bounced hard onto the surface of the planet, the top portion of the circle breaking off completely as they continued on towards another ruined building. With Dr Strange's force shield intact, Peter gave up on trying to manoeuvre his gimbal, launching a web at the ceiling and curling himself into a tight ball as the ship touched down again, still shedding pieces of itself as it finally skidded to a halt with a massive groan, leaning slightly sideways.
Tony thought as he pressed down on Steve's scalp again. Steve moaned as Tony hit the particularly sensitive spot that almost functioned like his own personal off button, massaging his fingertips over it until Steve's tired moans grew quieter and his breathing more even.
Tony attempted a smile as he looked up at his husband. "Yeah, maybe. But by that logic he's even luckier to have the both of us. You were born to be a dad, babe. You're a natural at it, and Pete could see that way back when he first met you. And since he's smarter than me it took me a bit longer, but—"
Peter sputtered out a laugh, burrowing even closer to Tony as Bucky got up from the bed. Steve glanced up at him, giving him a nod of thanks which Bucky returned with a soft smile.
"It's Latin, and it means, 'I remember the living, and I can't forget the dead'," Uncle Bucky said. "Сэм taught it to me, said it was fitting since I'll always be trying to get back what HYDRA stole from me, and at the same time I'll never be able to fully let go of what I did."
"Mmm, honey," Tony murmured, squirming as Steve's lips trailed along the side of his neck. "You keep this up and Pete will end up scarfing down all of your pizza."
Happy grimaced. "Actually, he's already scrubbed in and talking the surgeon's ear off, asking him all kinds of questions. He told me that he wanted to be in there with you guys, and I'm sorry, but I just couldn't say no to him."
He had repeated the mantra three more times when a bright light flashed outside the window of his cell, followed by heavy footsteps in the hallway. They must've been waiting for him to regain consciousness.
"That's my boy," Tony said proudly. He stole a quick glance at the ball field, quirking an eyebrow as one of the dudes swung at a pitch he had no business swinging at.
Stepping back, Tony picked up his cup as the hologram brightened and the red dot appeared, bursting through the simulated missile until it emerged in a shower of sparks, this time accompanied by the smaller components he’d designed to break off from the main missile’s body.
" from Clint as a clap of thunder followed directly on its heels, so loud that it shook the Suburban.
And it wasn't that Peter thought Ned actually believed most of that stuff his mom liked to gossip about, it was just… things were already weird enough. All the stuff Dad and Papa had told him about, the year he was missing and what they did to bring him and the others back, was literally straight out of a science fiction novel, and Peter highly doubted that Mrs Leeds' book club ever read anything that even came close to science fiction.
Steve's luscious lips curled into a slight smile. "Yes, I'm sure I will. And I do understand about the suit. It's just that usually you have me try out a new suit in training a couple times before I take it on a mission."
"Or more than a bit," Steve said through clenched teeth. "Even so, the fact that those military leaders had deemed any amount of civilian casualties 'acceptable' is all the proof I need to denounce them."
"Hey, Cap, Tony," she said softly as they stepped inside, the sharp smell of disinfectant and the distinctive
"That's why we're all doing what we're doing, honey," said Tony, his arms tight around Steve's waist. "Whatever it takes, right?"
"Yeah, that's what Maria always says too," said Carol. "She calls Monica her anchor all the time, says she would've been lost without her after her husband was killed."
"I like to visit my ma," he continued. "She used to be a nurse, actually, before her arthritis got too bad and she had to retire." He tugged on the tight collar of his shirt, clearing his throat. "I also like to draw, when I have the time."
After zipping his backpack closed, Peter slung it over his shoulder and followed Tony out of the kitchen, stopping short right in the middle of the living room when he realised he’d forgotten his jacket.  After retrieving the jacket—and an extra pair of contact lenses, at Tony’s request—they piled into the elevator for the ride down to the garage.
"No, it's not," agreed Peter. He set the bucket down between his knees and draped his arm across Gwen's shoulders, giving her a quick kiss on the cheek. "Thanks."
“Look, if it’s a question of work ethic, let me tell you right now that you won’t find a kid with a better one than my Pete,” Dad says, gently squeezing Peter’s shoulder.  “No matter what, he’ll make you proud.”
Tossing another glare in Shostakov’s direction, Steve turns up the volume of his music and burrows down into his warm-up jacket until he can barely still see over the top of it.  Then he carefully rubs his palms up and down his arms, trying to keep them at least somewhat loose.  It’s a futile gesture and Steve knows it, but he can’t just sit there and let himself get all tensed up without trying to do something to stop it.
Stunned, they both stood there for a few seconds, with Gwen's breath hot on Peter's neck and her nose nearly touching his chin, sending a shock of such intense warmth across Peter's chest and up his neck that for a moment he literally forgot how to speak, much less think. She was
Whoever had inputted Ultron into the matrix had only figured out how to halt JARVIS's commands, not actually replace him.
"Yes, which is why I've made triply sure that we're all good here," Tony said evenly. "It's not like I'm trying to hurt the guy, Pete. We're doing all this so we can help him."
“I think we just lost the element of surprise!” Clint shouts over the comm, his arrows flying through the air.  “I’d say it’s time to engage!”
And then, once Steve has his two more gold medals in hand, he can walk away with honour at the top of his sport, just like he’s always wanted.
Sighing, Tony scrubbed his palm down his face and reached for his coffee cup, grimacing when he realised it had already gone cold. He really needed to install a coffeemaker in the lab, and too damn bad if Steve thought it was a lousy idea.
"Oh, he was an idiot," Tony cut in. "Pure and simple. Tried to convince O'Brien that he could design a better aircraft than me. He put on a pretty good show, but that's all he was. Just a bunch of unfulfilled promises dressed up in a fancy suit."
"What the—?" Bruce said as he grabbed onto Peter's stretcher, stabilising it as another bolt of lightning appeared, even larger and brighter than the first and with its accompanying crack of thunder just as deafening. Steve instinctively shielded his eyes with his hand as he attempted to keep them on Tony, his belly swooping as he feared that another monster was preparing to join the fight.
Silence stretched on for several heartbeats as Steve attempted to discern what T'Challa was thinking. His expression was scarily neutral, with just the slightest hint of amusement, as if he couldn't imagine the type of scenario Thor was describing.
"Yes," Peter rasped as he gratefully stepped into Dad's hug, tipping his forehead against his shoulder as Dad rubbed his palms up and down Peter's back, trying to warm him. Tears welled in Peter's eyes as he sensed the guilt radiating from his father in waves, even though, as usual, he had absolutely nothing to feel guilty for.
"Tony, please, just stop!" Steve pleaded. He drew Tony close again, squeezing him so hard that he grunted. "Please, sweetheart, don't talk like that. You're so much stronger than you think, and it hurts me to hear you say things like that."
"'Cause you're an overachiever, right?" Bucky said fondly, ruffling Peter's hair. "I'll see you tomorrow, then."
"Um, so you mentioned something about making alterations to the procedure?" asked Tony. "'Cause I was thinking that the radiation burst shouldn't be as long as initially indicated since Pete's not fully grown yet, and—"
Which meant that he would see this battle through to its end, whatever it took. He would lead the fight against the massive alien army being summoned through an interdimensional portal from at least three different universes, because that was his job.
"See? I told you," Tony said as he took a bite of the pasta, which was every bit as good as he remembered. "Mr Jarvis was never wrong."
look that Peter had seen way too many times during their Decathlon trips, usually as the result of him misplacing something really important.
“Okay.  And what makes you so sure the Tesseract isn't here?” Steve asks.  “Wouldn’t this be unable to exist if it wasn’t?”
And while Peter did miss his father, it was more the reason why he was gone that was bothering him. Dad had been going on business trips for as long as Peter could remember, and while he had told Gwen that Dad's visit to New Asgard was more of a courtesy visit to help Uncle Thor with some technical stuff, it wasn't exactly the whole truth.
"I'm gonna head back to the jet with this stuff," Bruce said, balancing at least five different pieces of computer equipment in his arms, along with several books on computer languages and theories and a Russian-English dictionary. Steve found it mildly amusing that with all of his vast knowledge and with JARVIS at his disposal, Bruce still preferred to use real books as references as often as possible.
"Oh, I'm pretty sure that'll be impossible, sir, but as I always say, one can always try," said Mr Harrington. Adjusting his glasses yet again, he turned back to Gwen. "If you will, Miss Stacy, please continue."
With a frustrated sigh, Steve closed out his queries and shut down the workstation, giving the cadet at the desk a brief nod on his way out the door.
"I see," Beck said as he picked up his tablet, his jaw clenched tight with anger. "Thank you for your time, Mr Stark."
"Well, maybe I was saving most of it for you," Steve answered as he patted Tony's hip. "Sleep now, sweetheart. I've got you."
-o'meter. "Well… since you guys have already fought against Thanos once today, how 'bout you give us a quick rundown on what we can expect, yeah?"
Bucky rolled his eyes, elbowing Steve hard in the side before disappearing into his shower stall. "You know how I've told you at least a thousand times that your poker face absolutely sucks?"
And it wasn't just Peter's food intake that had skyrocketed. Thanks to a battery of tests that Dad and Papa had developed—along with a bit of input from Grandpa—they had determined that Peter was now almost as strong as Papa as well.
As it turned out, though, based on what Tony could glean during dinner, Sarah didn't so much hate Howard personally, he just made a very convenient scapegoat for her to blame for the abrupt death of her husband.
"Mmm," Peter grumbled. He was starting to wish that he had figured out a better cover story for Uncle Bucky than just being Papa's old friend from the war. Technically, Uncle Bucky was still an international fugitive, and it was only through the extraordinary abilities of Dad and Director Fury that he'd been able to basically hide in plain sight within their family ever since they brought him to the Tower. He wasn't technically confined to the Tower, but he never left it alone, always had his metal arm covered by a jacket or hoodie, and never was gone for long periods of time.
No, he didn't.  And all because he was the biggest goddamn coward in the entire universe’s history of cowards.
"Is Dad okay?" Peter asked as they scrubbed the vent clean of egg yolk. "JARVIS said he was sick, and that I couldn't go in to see him, but—"
"Steady!" Steve warned, his belly giving a violent swoop as Thanos managed to get the surge under enough control to raise his arm.
Just like the battle in the Miami bunker, against Killian's Aminacin army, when Obadiah Stane blasted away Tony's arc reactor, and he crashed straight into a one-metre thick cinder block wall.
"Pardon me, sir," JARVIS said. "But Agents Romanoff and Barton are requesting access to your laboratory in the penthouse. For research purposes."
"All right, all right," Steve said, fighting against the urge to scream as the white light grew even brighter still. This was so much harder than going through it himself.
" Tony rasped as he tilted his head up to meet Steve's lips. The kiss was hard and frantic, and Tony whimpered as Steve cupped his cheek, his tongue slipping inside his mouth to stroke against his own. Tony knew that they both had been using sex as a distraction far too often lately, but at the moment he also didn't give a damn.
Gwen's cheeks flushed that pretty pink colour that Peter adored. "Well, they all think you're a hero after what happened at the theatre. I mean, my mom practically never stops talking about how you saved my dad, and how grateful she is for the guards your dads sent over so we could stay at the hospital with him, and my dad also told me that your dad's foundation covered all the salaries for the first responders that day and covered his hospital bill, so… yeah. I know they'd love the chance to meet your dads sometime."
Steve inhaled a shaky breath, letting it out slowly. It made sense, what Tony and Sam and were saying about Smythe. If he was another one of the semi-enhanced programmable soldiers then he likely would've been on the same list as the rest of the enhanced people, and probably would have tried to attack Peter the moment he saw him, not just been hanging back and watching him all this time.
Steve had huffed and glared at him, but dropped the subject anyway, allowing Tony to fluff up his pillows and make sure that his water bottles, books, and sketchbook were all within easy reach on the bedside table.
"Yes, sir. However, with these identifications, Director Fury strongly believes that we have finally seen the last of HYDRA's agents."
It had taken nearly every ounce of Steve's inner strength to not completely fall apart right there in the coffee shop as soon as JARVIS uttered the word "lake", the memories of what had happened up at the Compound slamming to the forefront of his mind. If it hadn't been for Tony's quick action, and the stoic, no-nonsense look on his face that Steve knew only barely hid his own panic, he wasn't sure if he would've been able to hold himself together.
"So you go and do all the touristy stuff," Peter said. "Go see the Empire State Building, walk down Fifth Avenue, see a show on Broadway. It's what Papa and I did when he first came to live with us, and then we did all that stuff again with Uncle Bucky. And you've always said you've wanted to see The Lion King, haven't you?"
Peter gave a nod. "Yeah, that's what she told me." He grinned, remembering how Grandma had told him that she'd had to stand on a chair in order to reach Papa's neck. "She also told me that she hadn't realised until then just how much the serum had made you grow until she had to stand on a chair in order to reach you."
"And we need to disperse them, Captain, as much as possible," said Thor. "The Chitauri are powerful and their reach is vast, so we must make it as difficult as we possibly can for them to obtain them all. This will also ensure us more time to study various methods of defence against them."
A huge thank-you to my awesome betas allthesinnersandthesaints and jehbeeeh, and to therollingstonys for the gorgeous moodboard!  💖
"Yeah, I know," Tony cut in as he looked away, busying himself with tidying up his workstation. "Things are a bit different now than they were in the forties, as I'm sure Pete and Sam have explained."
Blinking back tears, Steve dug his phone from his back pocket and quickly snapped three pictures, sniffing as he examined them. Six years after their first fateful meeting, he could still remember the very first photograph he'd ever taken of his two precious boys, months before he was even able to call them that.
As soon as the door closed behind Phillips, Tony sat down at his station, pulling up the orbital trajectories for Steve and Carol as he activated his comm.
"Are you all right, Captain Rogers?" JARVIS asked softly, so as not to startle him. "Do you require assistance?"
Peter huffed, his arms tightening around her as much as he dared, trying to focus on the burst of sensation sparkling across his chest than his upcoming secret mission. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt this pleasantly warm.
"Hoo boy, talk about timing!" Clint said over the comm, echoing exactly what Steve was thinking. "I think we might actually have a shot now!"
He also hadn't shaved in days, the itch in his cheeks and chin only adding to his overall grumpiness. It had gotten to the point the day before where Natasha had threatened to shave him herself if he didn't at least attempt to snap out of it, and probably would have actually followed through if Bruce and James hadn't had a breakthrough of sorts with Fury's suspected pager.
Peter frowned, trying to shift on his bed without using his still-healing hands. The past three days had been some of the most annoying and embarrassing days of his life without the proper use of his hands, but x-rays earlier that morning had showed that his index fingers weren't completely healed yet so he was still stuck wearing the splints, and which also meant that he hadn't been able to participate in the training sessions with the team either. Helen had told Dad and Papa that it would likely only be another couple of days, but that was two more days of him not being able to even use the bathroom by himself, much less dress or feed himself, and Peter was already beyond over it.
And then, who knows how much use of his left arm he would’ve had.  Steve knew his shoulder was going rapidly downhill when he stopped being able to easily button his jeans, but didn't realise just how badly he had deteriorated until he woke up in the recovery room to the news that instead of the surgeon performing his procedure arthroscopically, as she usually did, she was forced to use an open incision, leaving Steve with an ugly-as-hell three-inch scar right down the front of his shoulder, and a recovery time that was taking over twice as long as it would have otherwise.
Another sharp stab pierced Peter's heart, this time of pain and worry. He didn't like thinking about Gwen going away at the end of the school year, and usually tried his hardest to forget about it.
"No!" Peter hissed, thankfully not loud enough to be overheard. He tightened his fingers around his stack of books, squeezing his eyes closed as he tried to force the offensive images out of his mind.
"Well, I'm pretty sure he's been saving mine too," Steve said. "Before him I never felt comfortable with people seeing me as anything other than an Air Corps test pilot. I was—"
Which is exactly what they were doing now. The Quinjet had touched down on the Tower landing pad at just after 1pm, and after sending Peter a quick text that they were home and would be picking him up from school after his practise, Steve had scheduled a debriefing for the next morning, made small talk with Rhodey for a few minutes to thank him for staying with Peter, and then pretty much dragged Tony into their bedroom, leaving DUM-E and U tasked with unpacking their stuff from the jet.
And see the small dots of sweat beading down the side of his head, pooling on the collar of his crisp uniform shirt.
After they pay their bill, which takes at least five minutes thanks to Mags’s constant fussing, Tony and Peter head down the street to the car.  They’re quiet on the ride home, as Peter seems to have talked himself out for a moment.
Actually, knowing Schmidt, there’s a very good chance that’s exactly what he’s doing.  Everything Steve’s ever heard about the man has said that he does not take kindly to losing.
“You still sure about this?” he asks.  “‘Cause… oh God, Steve, I’m about ninety-eight point seven percent sure this is gonna hurt like a son of a bitch, and—”
"All right, Pete, don't you think you've had enough?" Tony asked, watching with wide eyes as Peter devoured his sixth peanut butter sandwich. It'd been so long since Tony had seen him eat with such gusto that he felt a bit bad telling him to slow it down, but the last thing he wanted was for Peter's stomach to suddenly revolt and send it all right back up again.
"Shh, Gwen, it's okay," Steve whispered, handing the distraught girl a tissue. His own stomach was in knots having to listen to her describe Peter's thought process for leaving the bus, but he couldn't tell her to stop when she obviously needed to work through it. "None of this is your fault."
"What is this place?" Sam asked as he stepped through, eyeing the broken ceiling. "Is this where you live?"
"Most people do love the Avengers, Peter, just not the people doing the actual reporting," said Gwen. She leaned closer to her screen, lowering her voice. "And you know that control of the media is one of the main tenets of facism."
"I'm gonna spoil you tonight, sweetheart," Steve murmured as he kissed across Tony's neck and back up to his ear. "You've taken such good care of me lately and spoiled me with this wonderful vacation, it's time for me to take care of you now."
Only Steve hadn't thought he'd meant it literally. At the rate Tony was going, though, soon enough he was going to have enough suits to not only fit around the world, but stretch out to the moon as well.
"Peter," she said, the huge smile on her gorgeous face already making Peter weak in the knees. "Did you know that your dads have their very own ice cream flavours?"
Peter gave a nod, flinching as he heard another crash of metal against stone. "Yeah, that's him. And my dad is Iron Man."
"I've been waiting for this!" Rumlow screamed as he landed next to Steve. He swung his right arm, connecting his fist directly in the middle of Steve's chest and sending him flying backwards into some kind of merchant stand as several nearby vendors and customers scattered into the retreating crowd. Steve gasped for air, trying desperately to stamp down the panic he always felt whenever he got the wind knocked out of him.
Tony breathed in, his eyes briefly fluttering shut. He had feared that something like this would happen, despite Phillips's assurances to the contrary, but he had still been clinging to the hope that it wouldn't.
"Steve, Rhodey and I are gonna show Carol around a bit first, maybe get her something to eat," Natasha murmured as James led her out of the room and Bruce rushed off to yet another overdue conference call. "It shouldn't take too long."
Tony slid his palms up Steve's strong arms and across his broad shoulders to his neck, tugging his head down for a slow, deep kiss, rolling his hips up to meet Steve's as their tongues danced together.
"Hey, Tony," Pepper said as soon as she appeared on the monitor. She looked just as elegant as ever, if not a bit more harried than usual. "What's going on?"
"Of course I am, Senator, since he was my husband's closest childhood friend," Tony said. "Unfortunately, Barnes was presumed killed in action during World War II while attempting to capture a high-ranking HYDRA official, so I'm not exactly sure why bringing up his name is necessary here, unless of course it is your intention to cause my husband unnecessary pain by reminding him that he was forced to watch his best friend fall to his death."
"Yeah, I kinda figured that out," Peter snapped, guilt slapping him in the face when Gwen's face fell. He really had no right to be upset with her, especially when he already spent nearly every weekend away from her and was gone for three weeks in Ireland over the summer, including his sixteenth birthday.
"Ah, sure thing, honeybear," Tony cheekily replied as he took off again, quickly locating Peter. "You know I'm always up for a good show."
“That’s only ‘cause I could never beat you, buddy, right?” Tony said.  He playfully knocked his shoulder against Peter’s, shooting Steve another shy glance.  “Kid’s been better than me ever since I taught him how to play.”
"Yeah, but there should be no 'we' in this equation, Pete!" Tony said as he drew Peter closer, burying his nose into his curls. "We were trying to keep you
Papa's jaw tightened, his arm instinctively drawing Dad closer to him. "According to JARVIS, there's only one person who's ever developed any kind of shrinking tech. And apparently, he's no friend of the Stark family."
Footsteps that came to an abrupt stop directly outside of Steve’s cell.  Clenching his jaw, Steve slowly peeled his eyes open to find an older-looking man wearing a white lab coat and holding a clipboard, eyeing him through the front window of the cell as though he were some kind of experimental lab rat.
All of which was probably just a cover for Peter wanting to sit on a hard school bus bench seat and hold his girlfriend's hand, out from under the prying eyes of his father.
Tony sighed as he curled his fingers around the mug and brought it to his mouth, his eyes fluttering closed as he swallowed. "Yeah, I bet. Can't take the chance, though. Don't want him getting sick right before school's out for the summer. It's bad enough that…" He trailed off, but Steve understood what he meant. Peter had missed the final three months of his last school year because of the trip to Afghanistan, and everything that had happened afterwards.
"Don't you dare give me that!" Tony snapped, wincing when Peter flinched in Steve's arms. "You got trapped in ice and almost
"I'm going to Africa, little guy," Steve answered as he kissed the top of Peter's head. "Namibia, to be exact. Director Fury wants us to open a dialogue with the Prince of Wakanda."
"What, mention the fact that your kid is nothing more than some freaky science experiment gone wrong?" said Rumlow. "You know, I saw all the records. Those scientists, they were gonna create an entire army of creatures like him. But all they ended up with was some weak, scrawny kid who's afraid of his own goddamn shadow. What a waste—"
"It's fine, Captain," Tony said, even as his cheeks flushed pink. "Captain Barnes is correct though, so if it's all right with you gentlemen, I'll see you next time."
"Not gonna say no to my favourite space heater," Tony murmured. He burrowed in a bit closer, closing his eyes as he wished that he could unsee the words JARVIS had flashed across his tablet screen while Steve's back had been turned.
"No, not exactly," Peter answered as he accepted the ice pack, draping it over the back of his neck as he blotted his sweaty face with the towel. "Thank you, Gwen."
"Probably 'cause he knew you were with him," Peter said. He ducked his head, suddenly self-conscious. "It's always better when someone's there with you when you're sick. My dad… he tried, but… by the time I got real bad… He'd try so hard to make it home in time to sit with me for a bit before I went to sleep, or even eat dinner with me, but—but most of the time they just wouldn't let him. They just worked him so hard… and no one cared about what they were doing to him. It wasn't until he got put directly under Colonel Phillips's command that he was able to start getting home before curfew started, but even then it wasn't every day."
"Mr Stark!" Gwen said, rather frantically as she tugged on the end of her blonde ponytail. "Um… I was hoping that I could talk to Peter?"
"It will for all of us," agreed Steve. "And yeah, there will be a lot of uncertainty and fear out there in the beginning, because people won't understand what happened and they tend to fear what they don't understand. But once people realise that they no longer have to cower in the dark every single night, afraid of getting bombed by the enemy, I'm guessing that that fear won't last very long."
As had his armoured suit collection. And while Steve could understand Tony making upgrades to his Iron Man armour as he became more familiar with how it worked and what he might need during a mission, this was different. Tony had explained to Steve that he'd flown that missile through the portal in order to save him, and that in his mind it hadn't even been a choice. But now that Tony had gotten a bird's-eye view of what the Avengers—their newly-minted team of superheroes—could potentially be facing, he felt he needed to do more to protect the people he loved.
"You really are trying to torture me here, aren't you?" Tony said as Steve picked up his fishing pole.
And that was if the procedure even worked, which despite assurances from both Colonel Phillips and Howard, Steve knew was not necessarily a given. The serum had been successful with Steve, even more so than Colonel Phillips—and General O'Brien, for that matter—had ever anticipated, but he was still only one person, one test subject. There was no way of knowing if the same effects would be replicated this time around.
"Well, no one's ever gonna accuse you of being a good liar," Sam said, grinning. "Which is not a bad thing, let me just say. But anyway, it's not unusual for a soldier's mind to blend different battles together, Steve. I know it's happened to you before."
Steve will have to remember to ask Ma if she recorded the race so he can hear the commentary for himself.
to?" Tony asked, rather cheekily. "That maybe I actually enjoy taking care of you when you're not too busy being a stubborn fool?"
"If you need me to repeat my question, Captain, I'll be happy to do so," O'Brien snapped. "Otherwise, I would greatly appreciate it if you would grant me an answer."
"No, not if you mean what I think you mean," Peter argued. "HYDRA could've ended up destroying Earth too, Papa, if we hadn't stopped them, and I'm sure Uncle Thor would've been able to handle his psychopath sister a lot better if he'd known that she existed before it was too late, so I don't think that it does any good to compare them. They were both evil, and they both caused a lot of people to lose their lives, but now they're both gone."
But just as that thought finished zooming across Steve's mind, he heard Sam speak up over the comm, his heart leaping at the sound of the voice he hadn't heard in almost a year.
"Papa told me way back when we were still in Afghanistan that his doctors made him smoke cigarettes when he was little to help treat his asthma, which is just so totally ridiculous that it's, well, it's just
In fact, if his memory was correct, and it always was, Bucky had managed to skip out on paying the last three times, something Steve would be sure to pass along to Sam once he saw him again.
Tony glanced up at Peter, who gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head. Just as Tony had feared, Steve was too badly injured to just head back to the Tower.
"No, no, little guy, please, don't!" Steve pleaded, holding tight to Peter's waist. "It was an accident, you didn't mean it, and I'm gonna be just fine. Don't you even worry about it. Dad and I are just so happy to have you back!"
"Steve, it wouldn't've mattered if you had," Tony said, muffled against Steve's broad chest. He wound his arms around Steve's waist, closing his eyes as he breathed in the scent of salted peanuts and beer lingering on Steve's sweatshirt from the baseball game. "You're the Captain,
He was cut off by the sudden sound of a weapon powering up, one that Steve instantly recognised as a HYDRA weapon.
"Should be good now, honey," Tony added. "JARVIS isn't picking up any heat signatures 'cept ours now."
irks me to admit," the colonel continued. "The fact that this new class is being taught by a civilian liaison instead of one of our own should have absolutely no bearing on you or any of your squadmates' behaviour during such class, is that understood? I don't wanna hear so much as even a hint of a whisper of insubordination, you got that? You can think what you want about civilians all you want, just don't you dare let any of those thoughts be loud enough to be heard. Is that clear?"
Like he has every time, even when the rest of the team started joining them, and Clint took over choosing most of the movies.
Steve gave a stuttered nod as he glided his palms up and down Tony’s back.  “Yeah.  I know you are.  I can see you, and feel you.”
"Yeah, yeah, I know it does," Dad said with a sigh. "And I can't stand that sad face of his. Makes me wanna cry or something whenever I see it."
” Dad said as the image began to dissolve.  Carefully, he removed the glasses from Papa’s face, handing them to Peter as he went to work on the leads, grasping Papa’s hand once he was done.  “You did it, honey!  You fucking did it!”
"Um, I just wanna say, that if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something and I eat one of you, I'm sorry."
Of course, the middle of Earth’s first alien invasion was not exactly the best time for Tony to be ogling anyone, especially since for most of his life he had tried to convince himself that he despised anything to do with Steve Rogers.  Choosing to interpret Steve’s overall uneasiness with the modern times he’d been so rudely thrust into as arrogance, Tony had almost managed to put him out of his mind until he happened to wake up in the middle of that destroyed street to find those goddamn blue eyes—with just the slightest hint of green—staring down at him.
Which meant all of their suspicions had been spot on. General O'Brien's government—and Meridia's government as well, if there even was such a thing—had been deliberately prolonging the war in order to keep the citizens oppressed and themselves in power.
"Good day, Captain Rogers, Mr Stark," Stacy said as he stepped over to their table. Steve reluctantly got to his feet, shaking Stacy's outstretched hand.
"We were," answered Nebula. "But the Captain said that both Gamora and I were present in Wakanda with the others. Along with Mr Iron Man and the Ant-Man."
"I don't think I know what that is anymore," Tony said, nearly cracking Steve's heart in two. "It's been so long since—"
"He has? How?" Bucky asked, confused. "Seems to me he's got a pretty cushy job for a civvy. I bet there's a ton of people out there who would kill to have a job like his."
And in the chaos that followed that earth-shattering moment—literally, thanks to the earthquake that rocked Malibu almost as soon as Tony hung up the phone—Tony went from being a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist designing weapons alongside his father and living his life without a care in the world, to a young man struggling to adjust to sudden fatherhood.
"No, it doesn't!" Ms Sharon insisted. "Peter, there are a lot of things going on that you don't quite understand, so—"
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered, brushing his fingers across Steve's chapped lips. "Rhodey'll know what to say, okay? Pete's only gonna worry more if he hears that something happened without any of the important details attached."
“Oh, really?” retorted Tony.  “You mean the one who proceeded to write a massive hit piece on me the very next day?  That one?”
"I fell one time when I tried to get up by myself," he said as he grabbed onto the rolling metal tree holding his intravenous drips and external oxygen. "Ended up pulling out one of my IVs, which was totally awful, so now they told me that I'm not allowed to get up by myself anymore."
But not for himself. Now that Tony remembered, it hadn't been self-sorrow, even as Strange must've known what was going to happen to him.
"I don't know," Steve said, scanning the area as Clint notched an arrow. "Tony, Sam, can you guys see who's firing at us?"
But Steve didn't even break stride as he shook his head, his grip on Tony's hand tightening. "No, you don't. Not tonight."
"Hey, Steve!" Peter exclaimed as soon as Steve stepped inside, stifling a grimace at the sharp smell of external oxygen that filled the room. "You came back!"
"No, no, no, honey, don't," Tony choked out. "Don't try to move just yet, okay?" He fell to his knees next to his boys as his helmet retracted, pulling Peter into a fierce hug.
“Uhh, yes?” said Pepper.  “Yes, of course I can, Mr Stark.  I’m just… wow.  I—I just… I just never thought that—”
"I appreciate that very much, Captain," said T'Challa. He glanced around their group, acknowledging each of them with a nod. "However, I do believe that my father's unfortunate death is not the main reason for your visit here today."
After dropping off his jacket in his quarters and grabbing a book, Steve was just rounding the corner towards the mess hall when he nearly ran headlong into Colonel Phillips, the Air Corps commander, barely avoiding upsetting the full cup of coffee in his hand.
"Well, he was able to use that to warn us about Rumlow way back when, and the Winter Soldier, and Obie right before he broke into the Tower, so I'm thinking that if he senses something weird about Toomes, it'll go off again and he'll tell us. Like he's always done."
"Oh, but I'm not sure that I've found everything there is to find yet!" Gwen protested. "There might be more stuff hidden in here on what Peter's doing, so—"
“Yeah, I bet they were,” Tony said as they pulled into the school’s parking lot.  He cut the car’s engine, turning to his son.  “Look.  How ‘bout I see if I can figure out why the trials were stopped today, yeah?”  He didn't add that he already had a sinking feeling as to why, but he wasn’t about to tell Peter that.  Not until he knew for sure.
"Well, then that right there makes a huge difference," Peter said. "If you're in the military all your medicines and stuff are paid for, but if you're not, then they're not. And that stuff's really expensive. My dad… he'll have to work pretty much forever to pay for all of mine."
Tony heaved a sigh, reaching for Steve's hand and squeezing. "I don't know, babe, okay? You're right, it doesn't make sense for them to ask for both of us. But we can just fly down there tomorrow night with Rhodey when he heads back, see what this is, and then come home right afterwards, okay? I'm sure Thor and Sam will be happy to get Pete to and from school, they've done it before."
“Really?  Oh, that’s so awesome!” Peter exclaimed.  Steve laughed as he patted him on the shoulder, a gesture that seemed so natural for him that Tony did a double-take.
"What the hell did you do to me last night?" he asked as he shuffled over to Steve and slid right onto his lap. "I think I must've passed out."
"I already got started on another batch of soup, Papa, I hope that's okay," he said as he popped three oyster crackers into his mouth. "You want Dad to keep eating it, right?"
Not ten minutes later they were sitting in the steaming hot tub, filled to the brim with lavender and vanilla scented bubbles.  Tony had Steve’s back to his chest, his head resting on Tony’s shoulder as he stroked his fingers through Steve’s thick, blond hair.
"Oh God, Tony, I've missed you so much!" Steve practically sobbed. "I've missed you so much, I can't—I can't—!"
Papa and Dad both looked at each other, quirking their eyebrows in their silly silent communication thingy that both intrigued and annoyed Peter.
"Oh yeah," said Chester. "I really like those, Joe. Tell Sarah that they both have my official stamp of approval."
"The next one of these stones," answered Tony. "Wakanda is the home of the Soul Stone, so if Thanos is coming here to Earth, it makes sense that that's where he'll head."
And, if there were two more people like Peter who HYDRA had already found, that meant there were likely even more who had yet to be found, which meant that there was quite possibly an entire subpopulation of people with similar mutations who were potentially in danger of becoming slaves for HYDRA. All HYDRA would need would be a big enough supply of that drug, and they could control just about anyone.
by a significant other, he had quickly learned to crave the attention that he got from his incredible boyfriend.
"Pete?" Tony said, relieved when Peter didn't even glance in his direction, his gaze firmly trained on his Uncle Bucky through the window. "All right, Sam, go!"
But while Tony is rather proud of how he’s managed to pull himself together in the years since he drove out of that circle drive for the last time, he still wouldn't dream to call himself ‘good’.  A label like that can only be assigned to someone who actually deserves it.
"So… uh… what exactly does that mean? I mean, what happens next? There's no way that HYDRA's gonna let this go, but—"
"But—but—" Steve sputtered, his heart slamming against his ribcage as he came to the realisation that Gamora had to have been anticipating seeing Peter Quill emerge from the circle, which could only mean that this universe had experienced the snap, just like theirs did. And that many of the people still emerging from the portals onto the battlefield had been victims of it.
"Last thing I need now is another concussion," he muttered as he stacked the books into a pile, setting them on his bedside table.
Steve huffed, but nodded anyway. He had already clocked over a hundred miles that week alone, all while completely brushing off Tony's concerns about his stupid bum foot and the fact that he'd been up before four in the morning for the past three days, which was early even for him. But all that those logged miles had managed to do was force him into buying three new pairs of running shoes, none of which were helping him to sleep any better.
“Good idea,” agrees Steve.  “So, Clint and Natasha will take out the perimeter guards as quietly as possible.  Once they start making too much noise, the rest of us will move in.  Thor, Bruce, and I will spread out, concentrating on the rest of the perimeter bunkers, while Tony focuses on disabling the main building defences so we can get in there and search for the Tesseract.”
"Cap, Tony," Sam suddenly broke in over the comm, sounding grim. "Nat's been able to break a few levels of encryption out here, and… we've found something that you guys should probably see."
"But—!" Peter started, startled again when an image of Auntie Nat suddenly appeared, her broken, lifeless body lying twisted at the foot of a huge cliff while a hooded Dementor-like figure hovered near the top.
"Sweetheart, we've all been through so much. So much more than any person should ever go through in their lifetime. And you know Sam says that there are certain things that we just can't purge from our memory, no matter how much we wish we could. And something as horrifying as that… there's no way those memories will ever leave us." He ducked down, trying to meet Tony's eyes. "That doesn't make us weak, mo grá, and it doesn't make you a bad parent either. What happened to you in Afghanistan was not your fault, and that is a fact that is undisputed. If it weren't for your ingenuity and tenacity, you and Peter never would've escaped from that cave."
"Uh, maybe because you were already freaked out enough after that whole thing?" Tony said with a frown. "And it didn't work anyway, so what's the big deal?"
"Oh God," he gasped, shivering as he broke out into a cold sweat. He reached blindly for Tony's pillow, hugging it to his chest and burying his nose in it, allowing the comforting scent of his husband to wash over him, driving away the madness. He could still feel the excruciating pain in his broken bones, still see Peter's face as he sneered at him, his beautiful brown eyes completely blank, not knowing who Steve was, who
"And here we are," Mrs Stacy said as she reentered the dining room, carrying a large silvertoned platter laden with a huge three layer cake. She set it down in the middle of the table, handing Gwen a cutting knife.
Almost as soon as it registered in his mind Peter broke out into a cold sweat, setting down his fork with a shaking hand and reaching for his water glass, hoping against hope that the water would help calm his churning stomach even as he knew that it had never worked in the past. Not three seconds later his fingers and toes started to tingle and burning hot pain shot from his neck down his spine and out to his arms and legs, as if his very nerves were singeing, and he couldn't help but let out a gasp at the intensity of it.
Sam had told Steve multiple times that he would likely never forget such an experience, but that over time the traumatic memories would fade.
That moment had been one of the lowest of Steve's life, but it had also forced him to dig down into the deepest recesses of himself, searching for strength that he wasn't exactly sure he would find.
"Uh huh," said Peter. He watched as Grandpa struggled to get to his feet, swearing under his breath. "Be careful walking home, okay?"
"Yeah, it was," Peter agreed. Climbing into the driver's seat, he took a second to re-familiarise himself with the controls. "You do realise this probably means that they'll be sitting in that coffee shop a block away the whole time though."
A look crosses Tony’s face, one so dazed and confused that Steve might have laughed if he’d had the strength.  Tony’s eyes flick from Steve’s face to the hand resting in his knee and then back to Steve’s face before he shakes his head, biting down on his cracked lower lip.
"And I do," Tony stated. "So…" He trailed off as he became engrossed in his work, adjusting and tweaking and rearranging the tiny nanite blocks that were not too unlike Peter's beloved Legos, only about a zillion times smaller.
“This is when I usually get in, Obie,” Tony finally replied.  “The only weird part about it is you being here in my office before I get here.”
"That something would be correct." Steve's breath hitched as he noticed one of the demon-like aliens whisper something to Thanos before pointing towards them. "Get ready. Looks like we're about to have company."
Steve breathed in, at a loss on where to start. "She would've loved you," he finally said. "She would've been plenty suspicious at first, she always was with anyone who wasn't Irish, but your charm would've won her over pretty fast."
"JARVIS says at least a day, but based on how big this place is and what they might've been doing here, I'm gonna venture that it might take even longer than that."
"It's pretty much always safe to assume that that kid's forgotten something or other," Tony muttered. "Tell him I'll take care of it, yeah?"
"All right," Tony said, picking up what he hoped was a blowtorch. "So the first thing we should probably do is figure out how much fuel we've lost, and then figure out how to repair the damage to the engine. After that—"
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, pinching the bridge of his nose. It was already close to three in the afternoon, which meant that he only had about another hour before he and Steve would need to pick Peter up from school, and he had been fiddling with this targeting system for pretty much the last three days straight, only pausing when Steve managed to cajole him into eating something.
As it was, the image of those sparking golden portals opening across the battlefield would be forever etched in Steve's memory. As soon as the first one had appeared, Steve had had to forcibly hold himself back, gripping his shield with white knuckles and trying not to choke on his own heart as he watched Dr Strange and the others from Titan float through the golden circle. Steve had always struggled with being patient, as Tony could attest to, and that combined with the nearly crushing anxiety that he'd somehow gotten it all wrong had been absolutely gut-wrenching.
Tony turns away before Steve can answer, but not before he catches the worry etched into Tony’s face, combined with a dose of self-loathing that is way beyond what Steve would call healthy.  He opens his mouth to try and tell Tony not to worry, but then snaps it closed again.  He’s not exactly in the right frame of mind to comfort Tony at the moment, and he knows from experience that Tony’s probably too upset to listen to him anyway.
"Yeah, yeah, something like that." Dad pushed himself up to his feet, clearing his throat as he looked at Peter. "How in the hell did you get to be so handsome, hmm? Weren't you only about yay big about a month or so ago?"
Even though Peter highly doubted that he would find one. This was HYDRA. They had practically invented loopholes, plus they had the President, most of the Senate, and at least some of the FBI on their side.
“All right then.”  Steve gave a nod as he ran the card through his card reader, squinting at Peter’s name while it processed.  “Well, it was nice to meet you, Peter… Stark?”  His head snapped up in surprise, his eyes going as wide as dinner plates.  “Your name is Peter Stark?”
Steve had also told Tony that in order to have the kind of air support necessary for him and Carol to make it through the atmospheric barrier, he would need the backing of at least half of all the patrol pilots. Fending off possible attacks from Langara's ground forces or from pilots loyal to General O'Brien would be critical for the mission's success, as would defending against any possible attacks from Meridian forces.
"Impeccable," finished Tony. "You're right, it would. We'd have to time it down to the very last millisecond. But we can do it." Tony paused, taking hold of Steve's elbows. "Honey, we're the Avengers, and you have trained us very, very well. We can
“Ahh…” Tony said as he pulled to a stop at a red light.  Knowing Peter, he should’ve suspected it was something like that.
"Yeah?" said Bucky. "So? Probably a good idea to meet the guy's kid if you're dating him, isn't it?"
Clint held up his hands. "Hey, I'm just telling it like I see it. I'm not saying we should go in and start interrogating the guy ourselves, just that he's lucky he's not in the old Soviet Union."
"All right," Steve said with a nod. "You all know your assignments. Since we won't know what to expect until we're all in the air, don't forget to watch out for each other. The number one goal is for Carol and I to exit the atmosphere with all of our satellites intact, so be aware that the two of us will not be engaging in any dogfighting unless we have no other choice."
"Hey," Steve said softly as he propped himself up on his elbow, pressing his palm to Tony's chest as the worry wrinkle formed between his perfect eyebrows. "I can hear your heart thumping, are you okay?"
Tony sniffed as he started the car, pulling out onto the street.  Leave it to Mr Perceptive himself to read Tony like a goddamn picture book.
"Which is why I'm here." Steve pressed a quick kiss to Tony's forehead and pulled back, indicating the food. "I didn't want you going hungry while you're trying to work."
Bucky shrugged, giving Steve that sly smile that he had started to see more and more often lately as his memories slowly continued to return, the one that the old Bucky used to give him at least three times a day when they were kids. "Yeah, that is pretty much what you used to do, isn't it." He gave Steve a rather sharp elbow to the side. "But now look atcha."
"Because in all of my time as a youth engrossed in my studies on Asgard, I never elected to learn how to fly such a vessel," Thor said, rather petulantly. "And therefore I did not learn how to land such a vessel either."
He was in that sort of weird stage between sleep and not-quite-sleep when he heard someone knock on his door.
"Just a bit stressed, bud," he whispered. "I'm worried about Papa, and I'm worried about you, and all this goddamn government stuff isn't helping anything."
"It's okay, sweetheart, I've got you," Steve whispered. His own heart was already thudding at the all-too-familiar sights, the memories that he had of that fateful walk into a room very similar to this one slamming to the forefront of his mind. The circular control panel covered with innumerable switches and knobs, the serum infusion device already prepped with the clear blue liquid, and the missile-casing-like capsule for the radiation burst that was apparently the key to making the whole thing work.
Uncle Bucky shot him a playful frown as he eyed the chessboard. "Well, I guess that's better than being the crazy one."
"A-shift take off on my mark," Steve said firmly, gritting his teeth as he gripped the throttle. "And be careful. I'm guessing we're gonna see some pretty heavy enemy resistance."
And while he would've given just about anything for even the chance to get another splinter in his palm or another skinned knee, Peter also knew that if that chance came at the expense of the entire country, then it wasn't worth it.
"Oh, you know," Steve said as he reached for Peter's hand. "He's so strong, Nat. So much stronger than he should have to be. And this—"
"I'd be a lot better if everyone would stop asking me if I'm okay," Peter answered as he slid on the glasses. They were a bit too big for him, which Steve thought was adorable despite himself. Peter looked like a child playing with his father's glasses, which, from what Tony had told him, had been a pretty common occurrence when Peter was little. Something about how a two-year-old Peter thought it was really funny to put on his daddy's glasses when Tony was trying to work, and then refuse to give them back.
"Peter, what is that?" Gwen cried into Peter's ear, gripping his arm as the fire monster let out an absolutely bellowing roar, one so loud it nearly blew Peter off his feet.
Tony frowned as he watched Bucky go, grateful that Steve hadn't decided to stop by the lab on his way to get cleaned up from his run. Tony was admittedly very possessive of his husband, and especially with how damn sexy he was when he was all flushed and sweaty and panting after one of his hard runs. It tended to remind him of other times when Steve was flushed and sweaty and panting.
"Ha, ha," Peter said, practically vibrating as he opened his sketchbook and showed Tony an absolutely perfect drawing of the passenger airliner that he and Peter had discussed over dinner the previous night. Tony chuckled as he studied the drawing, recalling the way Steve had simply watched them in quiet amusement as they talked through the design, managing to work out most of the logistics before Steve had even brought out dessert.
"We're now at one hundred percent," Howard called as the entire room shook like an earthquake, the rest of lights flickering. "Five… four… three… two… one… stop! Kill the reactor!"
"Yeah, aside from that. But even so, why the sudden new interest in reviving a bill that's already been shot down?"
He strongly suspected that Uncle Bucky was reporting back to his dads, if not quite a play-by-play synopsis then at least on a regular basis, which he was actually okay with. Maybe it would help them see that even though he happened to be the son of two of the Avengers, he could still just be a normal kid who wanted to spend some time with the girl that he liked.
It felt almost surreal to watch as Ma and Sharon arranged all of Peter's medical equipment and IV lines onto his bed. Once everything was packed up, Sharon climbed up onto the bed next to Peter, manually pushing air into his breathing tube as Sam and Bucky guided the whole thing down the cleared-out hallways and elevator and into the procedure room that Howard and Colonel Phillips had set up in the basement. As soon as they stepped inside and caught sight of Howard, who was barking orders at a couple of electrical technicians like he'd been doing so his entire life, Tony flinched, his hand clutching Steve's so tightly that his fingers started to tingle.
"Yeah, that makes sense." Tony paused for a moment, squeezing Steve's hand. "It's a good thing you picked up those extra records from your ma then, hmm? Big band probably doesn't play very well with hidden listening devices."
"Steve!" Tony moaned, far too loudly as Steve's long fingers curled around his ass, holding him in place as he rolled his hips up. A guttural groan tore from Steve's throat as he kissed his way back to Tony's mouth, his fingers kneading Tony's ass as though it was dough for bread.
"Apparently not this time," said Auntie Nat. "We didn't get all the details 'cause we had to leave, but Thor mentioned something about an older sister than he'd never met, the goddess of death, apparently, who'd been imprisoned or something."
A heavy layer of silence settled over the table, broken only by the arrival of their waiter with their food. Steve was relieved when Sam took the initiative to lighten the conversation while everyone ate, proudly announcing he and Bucky's engagement to a chorus of wolf whistles and well wishes.

"You mean his father's reputation," Steve insisted. "The one that's been hanging over his head for most of his life?"
"Steve… baby," Tony whispered as he ground his hips down, moaning at the delicious friction and pulling another moan from Steve's throat. "Oh hell, honey, it's been way too long!"
Somehow, as if he were deliberately trying to taunt him, Anthony was looking even more handsome than Steve had remembered. He was still dressed in the cadets' uniform of a plain black t-shirt and army green pants, which Steve had noticed him wearing the day before when he'd knocked him over in the hallway, and while the colours weren't usually the most flattering, somehow Anthony managed to make them look absolutely spectacular.
Peter coughed, a wet, horrible cough that was so slimy it nearly snapped Tony's already fraying nerves.
Tony nodded, his thumb brushing back and forth across Peter's knuckles. "And I had no idea, absolutely no idea on what the hell I was doing with a baby. The mom… she cut off all contact with Pete the moment he was born, and Rhodey, he tried to help me as much as he could, but he didn't really know anything about babies either, and then with Howard right there in the house, but still not really
Tony pursed his lips, his eyebrows knitting together into a severe frown. It really was ridiculous, and he knew it. He knew that Steve loved him beyond reason no matter what, scars and all. He had absolutely no reason at all to doubt him.
"No, probably not," Tony said with a wince. He'd heard plenty of rumours about the accident that had taken Bruce Banner's life, and each one was more sensational than the last.
Steve's eyebrows knitted together over his bruised, bloodshot eyes, prompting Tony to squeeze his hand. "Sorry, hon, I shouldn't've said that."
“This is definitely the happy kind,” Steve assured him as they arrived at their table.  He had called the pub the day before, requesting that they reserve the very same table he and Tony had sat at the year before.  The manager had been only too happy to accommodate him, which was a big weight off of Steve’s shoulders as the table was in the very back corner of the pub, so they could have at least some semblance of privacy.
“Fine,” he said.  “But can you at least tell me what’s going on?  ‘Cause you were all sorts of twitchy when you got to the store today, so… what happened?”
Bucky shook his head, his eyes flicking nervously up at Tony and then flitting away just as fast. "Хауард," he repeated. "Your—your f-father. Стив and I, we saw him at the World's Fair the night before I shipped out, and he had… he had a floating car."
forget to pack his earplugs. Thankfully Dad had thought ahead enough to have his bedroom built on the opposite end of the hall from the master, but it still didn't hurt to be prepared.
"We shall," Steve said as he secured his shield and grabbed onto Tony's armoured shoulders. For all of the reservations he'd had about flying with Tony at first, he absolutely loved it now.
"Copy that," Tony said, barely audible. He glanced back at Steve, still holding Peter in his arms with his eyes firmly trained on his friend through the window.
Peter said as he quickly saved the document to the new laptop and selected the next file on the list, breathing in a deep breath as he allowed his eyes to relax. Once again, the encoded text of the file morphed into actual legible words, with Peter's fingers flying so fast over his keyboard that he had to be careful not to press down too hard and break it.
“Oh, I’m sure,” said Peter.  “People do that to Dad all the time too.  It’s kinda embarrassing, don't you think?”
"You're such a sap," Tony said as he clinked their glasses together and took a sip. The beer was rather good, smooth and rich with none of the "beer" aftertaste that Tony didn't like. Before Steve, Tony could have counted on one hand the amount of times that he'd actually drank beer, always preferring Scotch as his drink of choice, and not the cheap stuff either.
It was a good thing they had gotten married already.  And had gone on their honeymoon, spending two weeks relaxing on a beach in southern Italy back in January while Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky stayed with Peter.
"All right," said Steve. "Then as soon as that's done, please call Bucky, Clint, and Nat and tell them what's going on. Tell them we'll let them know as soon as we figure out our next step."
of the ventilator hitting Steve like a missile to the chest. So many people were crowded around Peter, including Bucky, Sam, Sharon, James, and Ma, that the only part of him that Steve could clearly see were his feet, carefully tucked underneath the blankets.
"Gods, Captain," Tony said, once again reading Steve's thoughts perfectly. "I'm so sorry. That's… well… that's rough."
"Well, unfortunately, that does present a bit of a problem," said Thor. "Seeing as how the Earth possesses little in the way of interstellar travel—"
"Oh, thank the gods!" Tony exclaimed. "Your exit took about eleven seconds longer than the first time, so I was just—"
“Oh yeah,” Peter says with an exaggerated wince.  “That’s gonna take some getting used to.  I’ve never called any of my coaches by their first name before.”
"Yes, sweetheart, I know that," Steve said evenly. Steve had never personally met the senator in question, but when both Tony and Nick Fury could agree on someone's level of assholery, as Tony liked to put it, then he supposed it had to be true.
"Mr Wilson expects Captain Rogers in the lobby of Avengers Tower at 10am, sir," answered JARVIS. "Which is in exactly ten minutes and twenty-three seconds."
"Oh, sure," Peter said. But before he could take it, his own buzzed in his hand with an incoming text.
After arriving at one of the big, fancy piers, Peter broke the lock on a public restroom door and slipped inside, sinking down into the corner by the empty trash bin. He grimaced as he tipped his head back against the tiled wall; the room smelled like a bad combination of boys' locker room and strong disinfectant, but at least he was out of the damp, muggy air and could rest for a bit. He had been going almost nonstop for over two days already, and was pretty much fried.
He’ll do it, though, because he doesn't want to be caught empty-handed again.  The one time he ran out, about a week after his surgery, he was in absolute misery until he could get his hands on another bottle, which he was forced to purchase from the student bookstore at three times the price.
"Nah, dude, you heard it right," said Chester. "Either that or I'm just as messed up as you are, which I will flat-out deny until my dying day, so—"
"That's everyone, Rogers," said the voice of Colonel Phillips. "All the pilots are ready. A-shift has been cleared to depart."
"Yep, all three of 'em," Peter said. He closed his eyes as Steve brushed the hair from his forehead, leaning over to kiss him again.
“Ahh,” Tony said, waving a dismissive hand.  “Just trying to help make the world a better place, and all that jazz.”
“Ahh!” he cried sharply, groaning as the noise only made the pain impossibly worse, ratcheting it up to such an intolerable level that Steve was shocked he was able to stay conscious.  He attempted to breathe in again, to try and force his mind back into its biofeedback mode, when he suddenly heard what sounded like a large, heavy metal door swing open from the end of a long hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps
"Sure, little guy," Papa said gently, his eyebrows knitted together in what Dad always called his worry wrinkle. Peter hated that worry wrinkle almost as much as Dad did, and even more so when he was the cause of it.
"Is that the Colonel Uncle James, or the Uncle Bucky, Uncle James?" Gwen asked as they headed into the dining room, which was unfortunately right next to the living room where the music was still going full-blast.
"No problem," answered Bucky. He dropped one into her palm, popping one into his own mouth. "Стиви? You want one?"
Tony’s eyes that were the most beautiful shade of brown Steve had ever seen, and yet laced with such a thick underlying layer of sadness that in the very moment they had locked with his, Steve’s heart had lurched.
"Does that answer your question?" Steve asked, panting as he pressed their foreheads together. "You're right, mo grá, I am stuck in my own head, and I just need—right now I need—I just need
"It's okay," Peter said quickly. "I'm just glad you guys are here." His eyes flicked between the two men, so giddy with excitement that he could hardly contain himself. "Did you ride here on Steve's motorcycle, Dad?"
"Let's just wait and see what happens first, buddy, yeah?" Tony said gently. "Now, do you wanna work on Bucky's arm, or should I?"
Gwen shrugged, flashing Peter the smile that always made him weak in the knees. "Eh, that's okay. They always get a bit more overprotective after a battle, don't they? I know my dad's always more hyper about my brothers and me after something big goes down."
Steve smiled as he reached for one of his protein ration bars, taking a large bite and grimacing at the bitter taste. Definitely not up to his cooking standards.
Steve rolls his eyes and looks away, trying to ignore him, which only serves to encourage the Russian’s childish antics.
"Well, it's more like Phillips asked me a few rather pointed questions that I answered, but yeah." A rueful smile quirked the corners of Steve's lips. "I've been told that it's pretty much impossible for me to hide what I'm feeling, so… it didn't take him long to figure it out. My entire team knows too, my friend Bucky told me."
"Well…" Tony trailed off, tapping his chin. "When were you gonna tell me that Rhodey was gonna be up there?"
"Okay, so… what happens afterwards?" asked Cam. "Once you and Carol get done deploying all your stuff, what then?"
Tony shot him a scowl, one so harsh that Steve pursed his lips, yanking him down the hall towards an empty conference room.
"Mmm, sure," Ned said, unconvinced. "I s'pose you can think that if it makes you feel better, but I still say that you haven't been the same since."
A chorus of assents rose up from the table as everyone got to their feet, filing out of the conference room towards the kitchen. As soon as Thor had exited the room, Steve drew Tony into a hug, squeezing him as tightly as he dared.
"Now, go ahead and run the end of the cinnamon along the finest side of the grater there," Steve said, smiling at Peter's look of intense concentration as he grated the small stick along the sharp ridges. "Good! That's right, we don't need too much. Just enough to help keep Dad's nose and lungs nice and open so he can breathe."
Steve's shoulders visibly sagged. "Oh. Well, can you tell us who they are? Maybe JARVIS can get started on locating them."
"Now just hold on a second here, Steve," interrupted Sam. "It doesn't do anyone any good jumping to conclusions when there might not be any ground underneath you when you try and land."
"You can't beat him hand to hand!" another male voice suddenly said, gruff and mechanical and so eerily familiar that a shiver raced down Peter's spine, joining the chorus of the nearly continuous ripple warnings from his Spider Sense.
If he were truly brave, he would’ve had the operation on his shoulder that he’s so desperately needed ever since shortly after his gold medal race, instead of wasting tens of thousands of dollars on cortisone injections and useless physical therapy that only served to increase his pain level and prolong the inevitable.
"Captain!" Sharon exclaimed as he arrived on the paediatric ward, waving at him from her computer station. "You're back again already? Usually we don't see you here more than a couple of times a week?"
And with Tony fighting for his own life during a good part of that awful time, sedated and paralysed with his chest gaping open while Bruce and Dr Cho worked around the clock to create an antidote to the poison Killian had given him, Steve still wasn't quite sure how he'd managed to survive through all of it, much less remain somewhat sane.
And that ever since then, Dad had spent another of his birthdays frantically searching for Papa, and yet another mourning for Peter himself.
Tony, is that I never knew that such a device even existed until about ten minutes ago,” Obie said.  “And
"Let me be clear, Captain," T'Challa continued, as if he'd read Steve's mind. "My government is just as unclear as you are regarding what I believe you have been referring to as the 'phenomenon from space'."
"Стив!" Steve suddenly heard Bucky yell, barely audible through the blood rushing past his ears, punctuated by the growl of the war dogs and near-constant machine-gun fire. "Стиви, c'mon! You gotta get up!"
Steve reached for Tony's hand, holding it as though it were a delicate piece of porcelain. "I don't quite have all of the facts yet, mainly because it's too dangerous to be asking the kinds of questions I would need to ask. But based on what I've been able to find out so far, there's a pretty specific reason why my ma wasn't given any compensation or government benefits after my father's death. From the very moment that Colonel Phillips knocked on her door and told her that Papa was dead, she was cut off from all of his pay and other military benefits. And then, when I was only a couple weeks old she was served an eviction notice, stating that if she didn't find a job within the next two weeks that both of us would be kicked out of the house."
Slowly, Winter Soldier turned to face Bucky, clicking his heels together and straightening his back as he regarded him.
"I am." Steve's arm tightened even more, his lips brushing along Tony's temple and neck. "I'm also feeling very relaxed and satisfied at the moment."
"Yeah, yeah, big guy, all right." Dad rolled his eyes, scrubbing his palm down his face. "Here, you wanna come say hi to Pete?"
"Oh, shit!" Tony muttered as he scrambled to gather up the piles of papers strewn about his workstation. "JARVIS, uhh, you've—you've gotta—
As soon as the bathroom door closed behind Peter, Steve leaned in. "Do you really think he's okay? I know all the scans and tests and stuff said he was, but… you know him better than anyone."
, Steve, and you're not supposed to be walking on those burned feet of yours anyway," Tony snapped, his shoulders sagging as soon as the words left his mouth. "Babe, I'm sorry. I'm just… tired."
“All right, so… where should I put you?” he whispered as he glanced up at the top shelf of his bookshelf, plotting in his mind how he could rearrange some of his other
Peter huffed as he pocketed the phone, shooting the ceiling a deep scowl. "Gee, thanks, JARVIS. You're such a big help."
“Yeah, that sounds about right,” Tony cut in.  February was when Tony had discovered that Regina had been sending proprietary information from Stark Industries to Justin Hammer, unleashing such a massive deluge of shit that it ended up nearly burying him alive.
"Thanos got the Reality Stone," Gamora said sadly. "We tried to stop him, but… he had already acquired it by the time we got there."
"Oh shit, honey, now you're just teasing me," Tony said, his back arching off the couch when Steve trailed his fingers across Tony's pelvis to wrap around his erection, stroking him gently. "Whoever thought that Steve Rogers could be such a goddamn tease?"
"Only if you promise to stick close to one of us, buddy, yeah?" Dad finally said. "No going off on your own, you got that?"
According to the location coordinates, Papa's prison was situated out on an island a short distance away from another island called Jekyll Island, which Peter thought both strangely ironic and more than a little freaky. Getting out to Jekyll Island would be easy since there were regular boat rides there from the mainland. Once he was there, however, things were going to get a lot more interesting, since he was absolutely certain that Dad's portable repulsors had never been intended to be used by a person.
And Brock is a nice guy, in his gruff, no-nonsense, take-charge sort of way.  Ma just hasn’t had the opportunity to spend enough time with him to see that yet.
For once Ned wasn't exaggerating about the drinks, and as the three of them talked over punch and cupcakes, Peter actually found himself relaxing a little. Despite all of his ballet training with Auntie Nat, Peter preferred to stay on the sidelines during the fast songs while the more coordinated people tore up the dance floor, which Gwen thankfully didn't seem to mind.
"No, but this also means that JARVIS was a lot more complicated than they'd originally thought," Peter said. "Which means I might still have time to fix him."
"I'm not exactly positive that he didn't, little guy," Steve added, with an amused twinkle in his blue eyes that Tony hadn't seen in a long, long time. "He sure hurried to his car pretty fast after Thor asked him to apologise."
was supposed to take down HYDRA, and I thought that I had. I guess I was just too damn arrogant to think that by taking down the Red Skull that HYDRA would just cease to exist."
"Last I checked they were settling in for a hockey double-header," Tony replied. "Pretty sure Sam said something about joining them, so…"
"That's better," he said to his reflection, wrinkling his nose as he noticed a blemish forming on his upper lip. He didn't get zits all that often, probably due to his healing factor, but when he did they tended to be doozies. Guess it was time to stock back up on the zit cream he ran out of over a week ago.
"But you can't even agree on what's best!" shouted Peter. He tore himself from Dad's grasp and shot to his feet, running his fingers through his already wild curls. "You guys have been going round and round about this for weeks already, so which is it? What exactly is the best for me?" He paused for a second, his heart racing so fast that he felt lightheaded. "Sometimes I think you wish that I was still that weak, sickly kid that I always was, instead of what I've become."
"I wasn't aware that it was break time," the wizard said, his maroon cloak hanging off his shoulders.
"I should check Peter's vital signs, Captain," Sharon said as she came up next to Steve. "If you don't mind."
, and aside from the fact that that's only a movie, so not real, we all know how well that ended up going."
Which he had. It had been Steve's plans that had led to the successful raids against the HYDRA facilities scattered across Western Europe, and it had been his idea and his strategy that had allowed him to be captured by Johann Schmidt, the Red Skull himself, and ultimately defeat him.
"Yes, that is exactly what I am saying," said Thor. "Agent Barton, I believe you experienced some of these effects as well?"
"No, sweetheart, we can't!" he choked out, even as every single fibre of his being wanted nothing more than to rush towards his boy. "We need to let him fight this!"
"Which we completely understand," said Steve. "I promise that we do. But please, Your Highness, I implore you. There are potentially billions of lives at stake here, and if it comes down to saving those lives or saving the stone, well… I don't personally see that as much of a choice."
"I will, sir. Thank you." Steve couldn't imagine why Ma would give a damn about General O'Brien's well wishes, but he supposed that was a conversation better suited for another time.
"And I'm not trying to baby you either," Steve cut in, raising an eyebrow when Tony opened his mouth to protest. "But if there is a risk, you know I'm less likely to be affected by it."
Tony's breath lodged in his throat at Peter's statement, at how much he sounded like Steve as he said it. He cupped his son's cheeks in both hands, unable to even form words as he stared at him in awe.
"Oh, very well," JARVIS said with an exaggerated sigh. "But I'm afraid not, Master Peter. The visual range is not long enough."
"Steve, we all know that," Bruce said carefully. "Every single one of us knows that. But from HYDRA's perspective, Peter is a boy with a very unique genetic makeup that in their eyes would make him the perfect candidate for a Winter Soldier." He glanced sheepishly at Bucky, who gave him a quick nod. "All of the other enhanced individuals that we've encountered, including the other Winter Soldiers, yourself and Bucky, and even me, were enhanced after the fact. Artificially, if you will. But Peter, his is a natural phenomenon that started to develop when he hit puberty, and as far as we can see, one that's still developing as he continues to grow. His strength is still increasing, his senses are still becoming more enhanced, and right now we don't really know when that'll stop. Forgive me for saying so, but a person like that would be very attractive to HYDRA, or anyone else with nefarious intentions."
