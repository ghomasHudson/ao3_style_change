“Well he sure as hell acts like one.” Steve said, wiping his hands on a towel and leaning against the island.
“Back away from the door, Sir.” She shouted, backing up a few steps. The beam was propped high up on the door and her foot connected next to the handle with no problem, busting the door in and off the hinges. Five pairs of eyes blinked at them and Tony went in, sniffing all of them for blood. They all seemed alright, two men and three kids that had been trapped in their apartment before they could evacuate.
Steve couldn’t even count the number of strange looks they got; two government-looking agents walking down the street, lead by a cat and followed by four more, all of which were in perfect formation and step? Not very common. Steve was focused on using every sense he could to pick up a trace of Tony. It was almost after two hours of searching that he got anything.
It wasn’t a pretty sight. The pavement was churned up at random intervals, and the sky looked like it was buzzing with angry metal bees. He caught a glance at Thor chasing a group above the buildings before Tony was out of sight, eyes peeled for any kind of Shield agents or vehicles. Steve couldn’t reasonably be mad at him if he got himself to safety, right?
“Are you alright, Tony? Are you hurt anywhere?” Bruce was crouched in front of him and had a hand between his shoulder blades, rocking the armor back and forth from the force of his concerned rubbing. Tony flopped himself back into a sitting position and groaned.
screwed up, no matter what he tried to do. Steve was probably going to get sick of him soon with how things were going. Coulson was angry with him, and the spy twins probably still weren’t thrilled about being dragged across town against their handler’s orders.
Wait, what?
The agent- Tony really should have learned her name- helped them all through the halls and back to the steps, turning to Tony and bending down until they were eye-level.
“We can’t just sit here!” Tony insisted, mind reeling as he tried to remember where he’d left his phone. Steve jumped onto the counter and dropped back down next to Tony, setting it next to his feet. Tony wasted no time in texting Agent, who responded shortly and to the point.
A few days later and Tony was- for one of the increasingly frequent times in his life- proven very horribly, blatantly wrong.
“Who attacked you?” Steve started, and Loki’s tail swished back and forth.
Obviously, just getting in wasn’t going to work, at all. He hadn’t had the chance to convince the team that he wasn’t an average dog. So he needed something big. Something that would catch their attention as soon as he was over the gate, and hopefully keep him from being run off by patio furniture.
Tony’s heart monitor jumped in pace and he took a deep breath, willing himself to be calm. The hallway lights were on, he was fine. He was on the helicarrier, above New York, in the medical wing. He was fine.
Tony barked, turning in a circle and jumping up and down. The Avengers looked at him like he’d gone crazy, and Thor frowned a little harder.
Three days of working on the code, and Tony had barely made a dent. Part of the issue was the fact that he had paws instead of fingers. The other part was that Loki had really done a number on everything.
“They have, they just won’t admit it.” Steve said, still looking at the collar like it could unlock the secrets of the world. Hell, maybe it could.
“Cap, this is bad. He could be anywhere! He could be hurt, or lost, or lying broken in a ditch where no one will find him until it’s too late and he’s-”
“Stay off the furniture.” He said, then returned his attention to the screen. They were watching some chick flick, and Tony snarled at him before leaving the room and walking into the foyer.
“Can’t you sit still for ten seconds?” Natasha growled, pawing at the top of Tony’s head as he passed underneath her spot on the couch.
, something was
They came up on the rear of the building and Tony noted with dismay that it was on fire, smoke pouring out of the windows on the lower half. A corner of the building was completely missing up near the fourth floor and they had to climb over the bricks to get to the door. The other agent pulled on the standard issue mask, and started patting down her pockets.
Feel free to drop me a comment if you like the chapter! Also feel free if there's something you want to see happen, i might be able to work it in ;)
“Well he was turned into a dog about two weeks ago-” Steve started, turning to look at them. Pepper shook her head and cut him off.
“Let’s keep going; I know a really nice ice cream place that has cones for dogs.” Steve said, and Tony followed behind him eagerly. It was another example of how hot and cold Steve could be. He put a child lock on the fridge door and forced Tony to eat dog food, but now he was totally fine to give him ice cream? Tony wasn’t sure why he continued to be to back and forth about things, but he was so excited to actually have something besides kibble that he wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
Tony suddenly got the sensation of being watched, and he whipped his head around to see something dark moving across the street. His heart jumped into his throat and Tony instinctively crouched down, watching as the shadow slipped around a brick wall and disappeared. It was still deathly silent and the only noise Tony could hear was the pounding of his own heart.
Clint muttered something about
Hey guys! Welcome back to the time line where Tony continues to suffer. Wait, what do you mean, that's just canon?
“Brave soul, this one. I don’t feel any breaks or sprains, besides this back leg. It’s already wrapped, though, so I assume it wasn’t new?” She asked, and Bruce nodded.
Tony wasn’t moving as fast as he’d like, hovering a few seconds to let the swarm catch up, before he shot down the street and waited for them again, trying not to lose their attention. Thor waited patiently enough but each time Tony stopped he was nearly snatched by an ambitious ‘hopper and he really just wanted to get this fight over with so he could go back to the mansion and power-wash the guts off his armor. He’d already almost thrown up in the suit before JARVIS started filtering the air to get rid of the smell, and he was really just done with this disgusting creepy-crawly day.
“Sorry, where were we-” Coulson was cut off by a muffled
Along with the quiet came a faint ticking sound. With Loki’s bomb still fresh on Tony’s mind, he darted into the hallway to locate it. He investigated as far as the stairs before the emergency generator rumbled to life, lights and electronics resuming their normal functions.
“You wouldn’t dare; not when I hold a weapon to your neck.” Loki hissed, pressing the blade flush against the fur of Tony’s throat.
“Your job.” Coulson started, taking a deep breath in his nose and slowly letting it out through his teeth before he went on. “Your job, right now, is to sit there in your little tower and do. Nothing. Why? Because all. Of. You. Are compromised. And why is that?” Coulson continued, picking Tony up by his scruff and looking at him at eye level. “Because of you. You’re not allowed to do your job right now, because you fucked up, Tony Stark. You fucked up during Loki’s attack, and you just fucked up again today.” He bit out, waiting for it to sink in. Tony’s ears were flat back and he thought he might curl up and die of shame right then and there.
Tony typed out, leaving it at that. Peter quickly changed the subject and started wandering around the lab, letting Tony sit on his shoulder again to supervise. JARVIS- ever helpful- chimed in and described the projects as they walked by, but the end goal seemed to be the wall-length row of Iron Man suit displays. They spent a few moments at each one, until Peter came to a stop in front of the Mark VIII. It stood out from the rest of the collection because of all the damage it had obviously sustained. The faceplate was gone and the body was dinged, scratched, and dented all to hell.
“Honey, I removed that job title from the payroll and moved them to other departments the day you gave me clearance. I remember where you left it, so I’ll go get it.” Tony was trying to ignore the parting lick on the cheek and instead focus on the fact that Steve had Done Things with Tony’s company without consulting Tony first. It was trivial, and Steve wasn’t the kind of guy to do anything more than that, but it was really the principle of the thing. Steve was pretty great at so many things; it was always a struggle for Tony to find something to be irritated about. Not that he wanted to be irritated at Steve, but the balance was always skewed, since Steve seemed to find more irritating things about Tony than the other way around. He was just trying to restore an equilibrium. That’s all.
“Well, in that case… Tony, fire away.” Steve said, gesturing to the robot head. Investigating the engineering involved would be much more difficult without opposable thumbs, but Tony would be damned if he didn’t try.
“You’ll
“So if you turn out to be not-evil, what then? Stark can’t talk to dogs either. And you can’t stay, since he already made a no-animals rule.” Clint started to pick at his fingernails and Tony heaved a sigh.
Tony set off with a renewed determination, making his way through alleys back towards the mansion. He was sprinting up the drive towards the gate when suddenly there was a burst of rainbow-looking energy in front of him and he was sent sprawling back a few yards from the force.
Tony hadn’t gone on a drive just for fun in a long time, and he was enjoying the late September wind through his damp hair. It felt nice to just do something for
“You’re just a softie, aren’t you? All bark, no bite. Well, okay, maybe a bit of both. It’s gonna take awhile for the scabs on my arms to heal up.” Night had fallen while Tony was asleep, and Peter eventually deposited him on the bed before leaving his room. What the hell? He was enjoying those ear scratches! Tony laid there in annoyance until he heard the faucet running, and the sounds of Peter brushing his teeth carried down the hall. Tony suddenly came back to himself and shook his head. What was he doing? he needed to contact the rest of his team to come get him!
“Stark, no! Get out of there!” Steve grabbed Tony by his ‘required’ collar and dragged him back, snatching the fries and putting them on a higher shelf that Tony couldn’t reach.
“Tony, I don’t think this is a good idea.” Natasha spoke up, lifting her chin when he spun and glowered. “There’s nothing we can do.”
“I suppose that would work. I’d love to get my hands on that greasy little weasel if you’re telling the truth.” Bruce said, shrugging innocently as Thor shot him a look.
“Agent Monroe is supposed to be on guard-”
Tony was feeling the deja vu pretty hard as the scanners were hooked onto his vest and he was shooed out into the freezing night. There was nearly a foot of snow on the ground and Tony had to lift his feet like a show pony to push forwards.
“That’s a good one. He’s a dog, he’s wily and smart, and he’s not afraid to bite. Fits well enough.” Clint held up his hand for a high-five, and Natasha bumped it with her fist. Fury wrote something down on his folder and cracked his knuckles.
“Yea, Tony, you’re back, you’re fine. It didn’t snow in the desert, right?” Rhodey joked.
“We haven’t had a discussion about that yet. Spider-Man is just helping us debrief, but he’s welcome to talk to me after about that if he wants. So-” Steve changed the subject to their data, pulling up recordings and scans from throughout the fighting.
He felt horribly groggy. Had he fallen asleep in the lab? Bruce usually didn’t bother to wake him unless it was urgent. He cracked open an eye, and found himself in a bedroom, that definitely wasn’t anybody’s he knew. His heart leapt for a few moments until he remembered what had happened. ‘Ah, yes. Transformation, apprehension, and violation. Got it.’ He sat up and stretched, alerting Peter that he was up. Peter had abandoned the flier, apparently opting to do some research instead while Tony slept off the day’s excitement.
noise as both the bones in Loki’s shin broke. The most alarming part, however, was the fact that Loki didn’t immediately send him flying. Instead, he screamed, falling onto his back and scrambling away while his other foot kicked at Tony’s nose. The dizziness was starting to fade and Tony held on tight despite the continuous blows to his snout. He could taste and smell blood, and it was with a morbid sense of satisfaction that he whipped his head back and forth to rip the skin even further.
“Okay, I think I’m good. Our goal is still finding Peter, but we’re out of options right now, so we might as well face the wrath of Coulson and see if SHIELD has any leads.” Tony decided, bunting his head to Steve’s as they got up and went back to join the others. Bruce and Thor were sitting in the foyer, looking out the front door at something Steve and Tony couldn’t see.
“Thanks, Steve. Where’s Tasha? She might be able to communicate better with me, though seeing as we don’t have hands, it’ll be hard.” Clint bunted his head against Steve’s shoulder before he stood up on unsteady feet, wobbling forward a bit before he figured it out and padded over to the closest unconscious cat. Thor and Steve followed behind as they approached Natasha, who was asleep inside her combat uniform. Clint poked the lump with his paw.
The Avengers alarm drowned out Steve’s words. He bailed on the conversation and bolted to suit up, Bruce sharing a look with Tony in his wake.
Bruce and Clint were already there with the other pilot- his name was Jackson,Tony recalled- and they took off for the helicarrier as soon as Steve and Tony were aboard. Bruce stayed by Tony and checked out his eyes and nose. Tony recognized it as his anxious mother-henning so he let it happen without complaint.
Tony found an alley with a brick wall at the end, and considered his options. He could use the close walls to propel himself up and out. He could also use the dumpster as a platform to jump off and onto a wall, and from there he could use his momentum to clear the barrier. He made up his mind and leaped onto the dumpster, then straight at the wall. Tony had a second of panic as he slipped, but then he pushed off and jumped over the brick wall without a scratch. Easy.
appreciates my jokes. How are ya, Tones?” Clint asked, dropping his arms to lift Tony’s chin and tilt his head.
Tony stopped fighting the team about every single thing they did. He stopped getting up on the furniture, ate his kibble and occasionally threw it up in private. He slept in his dog bed and didn’t shred anything else after the living room fiasco. It was nearly a week of him being the ‘perfect dog’  of sorts before he saw any progress.
Peter wasn’t paying much attention to Tony, and he was still stumbling through another excuse, when Coulson’s voice startled both him and Pepper, who both looked down at Tony and the cell phone he’d acquired.
“Very well, sir. The shipment should arrive tomorrow morning.” Phil finished his conversation with Fury and wandered off to organize a search party for Tony, and the cats each made their way to their respective rooms. Thor remained in the living room to guard Loki, though they doubted the god could do much harm as a cat.
Success! His paws clumsily tapped away as he logged onto the Stark servers and painstakingly navigated his way through the security and into JARVIS’s servers.
“As a human I could read lips fine. Now all I’ve got is meowing. Perfect.” He curled up into the classic cat-loaf position and stared past Steve at the sky he could probably barely see. “Why am I so nearsighted, too? Being deaf again is bad enough.” Steve blinked in understanding, and mentally combed through Clint’s files. It hadn’t said anywhere that he was deaf, but if he had implants, maybe it hadn’t seemed relevant to S.H.I.E.L.D? Either way, they would need to figure out how to communicate to him without his sense of hearing.
“Natasha, can you start us off by pulling up all the information you guys gathered during the fight?” Steve amended. She nodded and rose to her feet, scrounging a few Stark tablets out of a cupboard and laying them strategically on the powered-down holo-table. Tony perked his ears and looked over at Steve, who narrowed his eyes back as if to say,
Someone who, apparently, still held a grudge.
New York wasn’t much of a corn field, but there were two answers; scare them, or lure them. And they had already done their damndest to scare them, though it only made them eat faster, and that was the opposite of what they wanted. What would interest a bunch of man-eating insects more than concrete slabs and squishy humans?
“What do you want?” Tony growled, careful to keep his voice low. He had no idea what they would do to him if anyone else was alerted. His mind was racing to come up with a solution to his predicament, but all he could think to do was wait and hope they didn’t intend to murder him where he lay.
Natasha and Clint were occasionally in the kitchen, often at the same time. Tony always offered to talk and they always politely declined, though they did seem to generally talk more about other things as time went on. The world was for once so calm and normal that Tony was actually surprised when they got another summons from Fury- this time, for only Tony.
“At least Spiderman is there. It would have been much… worse….” Tony trailed off, a sudden memory smacking him upside the head.
The elevator doors gave a soft ‘ping’ and slid open, revealing not only Peter, but the rest of the Avengers as well.
don’t do anything stupid, Tones. Please. We’ll be back as soon as we can.” With that Bruce took off, jogging for the elevators.
Clint had just put the third batch of cookies in the oven when a car buzzed the front gate. Clint left to let them in and Natasha took her opportunity to sneak into the kitchen, stealing a half dozen cookies before she tip-toed out. Clint walked back in with Fury and three other agents that Tony didn’t know, and who were giving Tony some heavy side-eye.
Tony crouched there, frozen, for god knows how long, until he managed to shake himself out of it and retreat at a run back the way he came, trying to remember which turns he had taken when he couldn’t see his footprints from earlier.
, his
That threw them all for a loop. They’d thought of this as a little test-run, to get a better feel for the guy. Fury would definitely scare him off if he tried to force him into joining.
Tony let out an agitated hiss and lashed his tail, trying to think of a way they could get to Queens quickly and without the help of Coulson.
“That was one of the most morally unsound things i’ve ever seen, and I fight cold-blooded villains on the daily.” Tony huffed. They had time to find a booth and get drinks before Coulson had convinced the guy to let the rest of them through. Tony was sitting in Peter’s lap, and happy as a clam now that the leash was off and he’d been reunited with the team. The waiter had even brought him a tiny container usually used for condiments, and filled it with water.
“You’re not half bad, you know? Considering. You have a pretty decent temperament. Should I even try to return you to your people? I refuse to send you back somewhere they…” He trailed off, picking up the cat as he flopped down on the bed, before settling Tony on his chest. He seemed to be getting himself back together after he had dried his face and changed topics. “I thought I was done with this animal-enhancement bullshit, you know. It was bad enough when I got mixed up in it. At least I could do something about it after I got my-” He shot a furtive glance at his closet door, and Tony perked up. What kinds of secrets was he hiding in there?
“We’re with you, Tony. Just making sure you realize the stakes.” Bruce meowed, the calmest of them all.
He could still hear his comm unit, though it was set to low volume. The Avengers were trying to contain the robots but they kept coming, and with three members out, it was taking a huge toll. Thank God they still had the Hulk.
throughout the lab, and he was nearly crushed by a pair of squabbling cats who materialized in mid air above him.
“Tony, wait up!” Peter called, and Tony turned to see him jogging out of the restaurant with a box of take-out. He caught up to them, panting, as if he’d run much farther than a few yards down the street. “So, where are we going, again? Some tower?” Coulson looked over his shoulder, then pointed at the peak of Avengers Tower, which was just slightly visible from where they were.
to one of the seats by an adamant Steve, who insisted it was to keep him from getting hurt. Natasha took a couple of sneaky photos of Tony in the Hawkeye hoodie as they took off.
happened to you!” Tony yowled, batting Peter gently on the unmarred side of his face. The teen winced and at least had the sense to look a bit sheepish.
“Alright, you can stop. Steve, if you could set him back down up here-” She said, putting her stethoscope in her ears and listening to Tony’s chest once he was laid down on the table again. The frown was back on her face and she opened Tony’s mouth again, then used a penlight to look in his nose.
“What are we going to do about him?” They all looked at each other again, and then Natasha’s ears flicked.
“No, everything’s alright. Thank you for helping… the dog. I would like it if you came with us to participate in the debrief later, but you’re not being held at all, and you’re free to go if that’s what you wish.” She reassured, and slowly Spider-Man’s hands lowered to his lap.
Tony wiggled closer with every omission, finally ending up draped in Clint’s lap while the archer stroked his fur. He talked about the nightmare he’d had, of losing Natasha in that building, finding her broken and bloody because he hadn’t been near enough or fast enough.
“I think his leg is broken. It was a German Shepherd, so I’m not surprised there was so much damage. They have the strongest jaws-” Clint cut himself off when Natasha gave him a
“What the fuck?” Tony looked down at himself, and made a sound akin to a cat coughing on a hairball. Hell, maybe he was, considering the four furry limbs and new tail he was sporting. At least the arc reactor was still intact. Tony tried again, and wobbled over to his helmet, feeling weird using his hands- paws, to walk. God, he really hated his armor in green. He stuck his head and front paws in, unable to squeeze much more of himself into the small cavity. “JARVIS? Hello? Power on.” He commanded, before he realized he was meowing. No wonder JARVIS wasn’t responding. That, or the fact that the suit was in pieces, and out of power; very much a contributing factor.
Tony took the time to maneuver his head back out, and once he was free he climbed back down and took off at a sprint down the hallway. His body still ached from the roughing up he got courtesy of the goons, but adrenaline drowned out the pain. If he messed up and dropped it, the results would be catastrophic.
“I want a lot of things, but only one simple favor. In exchange for not killing you.” Loki smiled, crouching down until his face was a foot away from Tony’s. “You will be asked by SHIELD tomorrow, to go on another little mission. Collecting data, or what have you. You will say no.” Loki’s hand reached out and grabbed Tony’s scruff again, smacking his head into the hardwood floor. Tony sucked in a breath through his teeth, but otherwise forced himself not to react. “I know that you’re cottoning on to what’s going on- so congratulations for being slightly above the average of your fellow dim-witted midgardians. But I refuse to defeated by your lot a second time. So; you will not interfere in my doings. You will not tell another soul what you know. I had ample time to outfit this building with my proverbial eyes and ears. The second you decide to snitch, I will remotely detonate this-” He held up a small silver disc, around the same size and thickness of a coaster, “-which contains an energy strong enough to open up a crater about a mile wide in your precious
Steve’s demeanor changed and he took a long hard look at Tony, frown deepening.
as the workshop doors slid open. Tony was grease-stained in an old black wife beater with holey jeans, wearing a protective mask and gloves in preparation to solder, but Steve still gave him a small smile instead of the Disapproving Frown like he usually did. He was also carrying a small plate, which when Tony took a closer look, seemed to have several sandwiches on it. Steve navigated his way to Tony’s seat and held out the plate.
“I’m going to go order some pizza.” Clint said- despite it being breakfast time- and pulled out his phone, disappearing into the other room. They all knew the order by heart: three meat lovers pizzas for Steve, an onion-mushroom-ham for Clint and Natasha to share, a pepperoni-bacon for Bruce, and Tony hoped that Clint got four extras of whatever in case Thor came back and wanted something. If Tony had been human he would have added a supreme with extra pepperoni, but as it was he’d probably just be getting another bowl of the raw stuff Bruce put together. It wasn’t as good as pizza but Tony wouldn’t be complaining.
“Tony really wasn’t supposed to be anywhere near the fighting, but he’s stubborn.” Steve seemed to hesitate after that. The last time they had seen her, Steve hadn’t let on that Tony was anything more than a pet. But if he was going to tell the truth, they would have to let the cat out of the bag.
“Well, looks like you’ve weaseled out of it for now. Let’s go see what this alert is about.” Bruce leads Tony to the living room where they switch on the TV to a local news channel.
Natasha finally turned to look at him, and blinked a few times before she seemed to realize that he was there.
Hehehehehe
“This must be where he landed. You can see the ruts in the pavement.” Coulson ran his fingers over a gouge, checking out everything in the alley while Maria packed the suit into two duffel bags that they had brought. A few backup agents reported to them a few minutes after they were done, and they took it with them to bring back to the tower where JARVIS could analyze it and get readings about the spell. Meanwhile, the team tried to pick up his scent again- though it wasn’t much use. New York was huge, smelly, and loud- they would need to wait until they found another energy reading, or had an amazing stroke of luck before they could track down their team-mate.
Steve stood and stared at the bag for a few moments before he went at it again, twice as violent as before.
Tony batted him  in the shoulder a bit, swiping a dismissive paw. Clint shrugged and added some gray fur to Pepper’s pants, who at this point looked like she was barely suppressing the urge to leave and immediately send her clothes to be dry cleaned.
A heavy
“Stark! Hold still!” It was Clint, and he forced Tony to stay in one spot as a flurry of hands brushed all the insects out of his fur. They scattered and disappeared back into the decaying church, leaving Tony and Clint to stand there and watch in disgusted awe.
“You’re so dumb, don’t ever do that again or I’m going to have a heart attack, jesus christ-” Tony babbled, settling himself on Peter’s shoulder and purring like a motorboat.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony wanted to shout, but he settled for harsh barking. He stepped a few paces back from the agents, which forced the kid to fall over onto his behind, and allowed Tony to block him more effectively.
“Damn. What did you do to him, Natasha? It’s like a miracle; not even a peep.” Clint remarked, and Tony heard the others make quiet noises of agreement.
Nyet = no {just in case anyone didn't know that}
Tony couldn’t have been looking through the code for long before Bruce entered the lab, a mug of coffee in one hand and a food bowl in the other.
in decades, and yet, there it was.
Tony decided to camp out next to the decommissioned robot, investigating it to see if he could figure out where- or who- it actually came from. He couldn’t get it open without any tools, but the casing was telling on its own. Smallish head compared to the body, cheap materials, military grade weapons system, no intention of using human pilots… It all reminded him of someone. Someone who was supposed to be in
He couldn’t say his thoughts out loud so he settled for barking as he was pushed out of the kitchen and into the living room.
“Thanks bud.” Tony gave him a quick pat on the claw before he finished off the rest of his food, tossing the empty carton onto the scrap-metal table and getting back to work.
“Damn. I wonder if he was born enhanced.” Bruce said, shaking his head. “If he isn’t careful, he can be out of this field before he’s even really in it. Maybe we should keep an eye on him.”
“Welcome back, Steve. So Peter, the basics, are this; these are the Avengers. They were... transformed into cats. As you can see. You also found Tony and indirectly returned him, for which we’re all grateful for.”
“Stop squirming!” Peter hissed, just as Coulson started striding towards them. The crowd parted to reveal a bizarre group of five cats and two government agents (Tony hadn’t noticed Hill), and Peter instantly froze.
There was silence for a few minutes, until Tony’s communicator crackled to life.
“No. Thank you, though.” She murmured, petting down his head before leaning back and pulling her new mug to her chest. “I should be getting back to bed. You too, shchenok.” Natasha said, briefly pressing her lips to the top of his head when she rounded the counter. The sound of her sirregular footfalls faded as she returned to her room, and Tony slid down off the stool and limped back to his bed, curling up as he let the smell of honey lull him to sleep.
“We aren’t doing anything today, why can’t we take it to a shelter and have it checked for a chip? It’ll only take half an hour-” Clint started, but Steve shot him down. Tony didn’t catch the rest of their conversation after that because the quinjet doors shut and the engines revved. It raised up vertically until it was clear of the surrounding buildings, and with a roaring of propellers started off towards the mansion.
In hindsight, they should have invested in a heavy-duty animal crate.
“Bruce put together a new diet for you, and I think you’ll like it a lot more than kibble.” Steve popped off the lid and gave the container to Tony, who investigated the contents. There was a whole raw chicken leg, a few tablespoons of some kind of meat and some chopped up vegetables all coated in what smelled like egg yolk. It was less than a regular portion size and Tony figured it was because they didn’t want him to get sick. Either way he wasn’t at all complaining, and dug right in, tail thumping against the bed. He’d stopped trying to force it to sit still when he was happy and Clint snorted.
“Doesn’t he understand- that as part of a team- he needs to communicate better?” Steve said in between punches, steadying himself and the bag before he continued. “In order to work as a team, we need to trust each other, and if I can’t trust him to be honest about
Tony’d had no idea how much Clint always carried on his back, the burdens he had acquired both at SHIELD and from being an Avenger. He hadn’t gone back farther than the mind control, and Tony figured he had to step up his friend-game to unlock that particular backstory.
“Tony?” Clint called, his feet padding down the hallway until he could poke his head into the room. “Fury just called. It’s another mission, the debrief is tomorrow morning, on the helicarrier. Is that alright?” He asked, and Tony knew the gentle tone was due to the fiasco earlier in the day. A flare of embarrassment heated the back of his neck, but he forced himself to ignore it.
“As much as I loved the hospitality, I really couldn’t stay. Armies to gather, worlds to conquer, that sort of thing.” Loki finally dropped his hand and sat up straight, staring at Tony right in the eye. “I also have a few enemies to vanquish. This is the part where you come in.”
“Well, it’s definitely good to see you again. What’ll you be having?” Tony always got something different if he was in a good mood. He settled on something 120% chocolate and cavity-inducing, thanking the barista- Megan- after he got his drink and left to sit down. He chose a quiet corner and sipped his sugary monstrosity while he went through his emails. Most were about the battle from the morning, a few from Fury and Coulson, while the rest was from SI and Pepper.
noises as she sharpened them. Tony could smell new car and an overwhelming musk of warm leather, from the car seats and the uniforms of the agents. Tony rolled down his window a crack and stuck his nose up against the cool air. It wasn’t necessarily a horrible smell, but there was so much of it that Tony was getting a headache. The wind whipping by was a nice cold relief.
After a week or two of normal life, however, there was a small hiccup in the routine. Tony awoke on a thursday night- or was it early morning?- to see Natasha sitting at the table, nursing a cup of coffee. She wasn’t normally up so late- at least not in the commons area. Her crutches leaned against the table next to her.
“Hello? Peter?” Tony yowled, leaping across ceiling beams towards the source of the smell. There was a small intake of air from Steve, who bounded forward and started sniffing around a wrinkled hand that was extended from underneath a sheet of drywall. “Oh.” Tony whispered, placing his paw on it and sighing in relief when there was a faint thrumming underneath his foot.
Tony did a circuit and didn’t see anything amiss, so he padded over to fall into step with Steve, nosing his ear for a brief moment of comfort.
“Honey-s, we’re home!” Clint called, arms spread open like he expected a hug. Natasha only raised an eyebrow at him, but Tony huffed a little laugh. “At least
“And I’m sorry again for not letting you on the couch before. That was pretty mean.” Steve admitted, running a palm over the top of Tony’s head. Clint was always the most affectionate- he loved to scratch Tony’s head or rub his belly. Bruce, too, would give Tony a pat or ruffle his ears, but Steve hadn’t been overly touchy-feely.
“Wait, Coyote? Whose code name is Coyote?” Steve said, his voice strained. Tony had no idea if they were still fighting or if they’d switched over to search and rescue.
“Can’t be out of high school yet. Mid-teens, probably.”
Okay, now what? How had he even ended up here, let alone as a feline? He combed through his most recent memories, trying to suppress the pounding headache he had.
“It’s always so awful when we accidentally hurt our own pets. He seems alright though, and your doctor did an excellent job on this. I’ll give you some antibiotics, just to prevent infection.” Hannah left the room for a few seconds and returned with a little orange pill bottle full of tablets. “Have you had to give a dog medicine before?” She asked kindly, and Steve shook his head, looking bashful. Tony was so going to tease the shit out of him about his previously non-existent acting skills once he was human again.
“I’ll give you a call next time we have a mission.” Fury said to them as they left, which meant he had something in the works and there would be two to three days of rest, according to Clint.
Tony was dozing in his bed when Steve jogged into the kitchen, right at six thirty, like clockwork. Except this time when he started in on his ritual pre-run fruit mix he looked over at Tony and spoke up.
“Where are we going? Why do you look so ruffled?” Steve didn’t answer (Clint wouldn’t have heard anyway), instead gesturing for Clint to follow him as he led the way to the elevator. It was already descending with Natasha on board.
“Alright, handsy, put me down! I won’t bite you again, just put me down.” Tony meant for it to come out as threatening, but his meows sounded more like cries. He was promptly deposited on the bed (which was unmade and smelled like dirty laundry, but Tony was glad enough to be free that he ignored it).
“‘Heart attack’ my ass. I was as cool as a cucumber. I had things under control.”
“Okay, sure. You must have a pretty bad concussion if you’ve forgotten. Bruce, should we bring him to see Hannah?” Steve acquiesced, hands up in surrender.
Peter’s face expanded into a grin, and he nudged Tony’s paw with a finger. “Sooo. You never mentioned you had a
Tony started to fake-gag, and Steve gave him a hearty thump on the back, smirking all cheeky-like when Tony gave him a half-hearted glare.
“I think you need to stop making impulsive decisions that could cost you a life, whether it’s your own or a teammate’s! Get it together, Stark, or I’ll bench you for your continued recklessness and lack of consideration for your teammates.” Steve gave Tony a small push and stormed past, slamming his bedroom door in the most accurate impression of a child he could get. Tony picked up one of the couch cushions and screamed into it as loud as he could, despite his sore throat.
“You didn’t steal him- at least not directly. Actually, he was lost, so for finding him we should give you a reward.” Maria soothed, but Peter looked even more skeptical at that.
“This morning. He’s just tired; the guy never sleeps.” Clint was holding the whole coffee pot, and Bruce kept shooting him looks as he drank straight from it like a mug.
“Good to hear.” Steve came in next, sparing a second to pull off his gloves before he crouched down to hug Tony around the neck. Tony felt better seeing their Captain’s composure back. Thor came next, and took his turn giving Tony a hearty pat on the shoulder.
“I’m Spider-
“He was acting a bit strange the other day. He gave me the weirdest look when I brought down lunch, like I had gone nuts.” Steve said, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“Before I attempted to rouse you, I searched the roof myself. There was no sign of Anthony anywhere, nor his metal suit. He must have been thrown far afield by the blast.” Steve felt his heart jump into his throat. He was about to panic again, but just then a frightened yowl sounded from one of the other cats.
Tony was right on Thor’s heels as the god threw open the front door and boomed out;
“You’ve been going at that awhile. How much coding are you going to have to do?” Steve asked, lazily stroking his tongue down a leg.
Tony was trying to remind himself that he was in a tub, that he was with Steve, that Steve would never hurt him- but as soon as there was pressure on his back he snapped, scrambling away from the hands and trying to get away, away from the water and the people trying to kill him and the hands keeping him still-
Due to the power-and generator, whoops- being down, Tony had to take the dozens of flights of stairs down to their ‘bunker’. For caution’s sake (and Bruce’s sanity), he’d had a Hulk chamber put in eight stories deep below the building. It was made of concrete, the walls ten feet thick, supplemented with layers of steel and the thickest rebar Tony could get his hands on. It couldn’t necessarily contain the Hulk forever, but it was the best they could do given the circumstances. Even Fury’s glass Hulk room would likely have been insufficient.
“You’ll get hypothermia if you don’t dry off. I’ll get some towels.” He said, rummaging around in the linen closet. Tony reluctantly stood there and shook, while everyone took a towel and helped to scrub him dry. They all had pinched expressions on their faces and Tony wanted nothing more than to escape, crawl underneath something, and hide until they forgot what a pain he was.
“Well we can start with your teeth now, it’ll only take a minute or so. I also cleaned up my lab, so you can come hang out, if you wanted.” Bruce said, leading Tony to the bedrooms and into Tony’s own.
Tony thought, padding out of the kitchen and heading to the foyer. He came back a minute or so later to see Steve waiting with a bemused expression on his face that turned into a smile when he saw what Tony had brought.
sadly when he realized that Tony was already leaving them so soon after getting back.
“Alright, I believe you.” Bruce rolled up and tore off the used paper, setting it aside to be destroyed later. He then sat down heavily next to Tony and whipped his phone out. He used the arm holding the coffee to wrap around the back of Tony’s neck and he held out his phone with the other, smiling as he snapped a selfie. Tony peered over his shoulder at the shot and Steve walked in to see them both focused on the phone, chuckling to each other as Bruce set the picture as Tony’s contact image.
The front door didn’t budge when Tony reached it, but he wasn’t surprised. He started to bark instead, hopping up on his hind legs to get JARVIS’s attention.
Steve was frowning at it, though he said nothing. Clint glanced up and seemed to pick up on Steve’s tension.
Steve finally got up and picked up all the wet towels while Tony shook himself out, dry but still freezing. Maybe, when Bruce came back up, Tony could convince his friend that he was a lap dog.
He made his way through New York using mostly alleys, getting creative whenever he hit a roadblock. It got easier as he went and it was maybe an hour later when Tony turned onto the street where the mansion was waiting. He picked up speed and reached the driveway in a full sprint, clearing the security gate with a hop onto the trash can and over.
, and Tony couldn’t just
“I have the perfect idea.”
Peter winced when he finished reading and ran his fingers through his hair.
On unsteady legs, Tony hauled himself up, and placed his body between the kid and the guns. Jackson lowered his uncertainly, but the rest of the group didn’t flinch. Tony wasn’t tall enough to totally shield the kid, and they still had a rather clear shot.
“Aw, nuts.” He muttered, leaving Tony’s side for a few moments. He wasn’t sure what Clint was doing and he focused on drawing in air while ignoring the burning in his chest. It was reminiscent of when he’d nearly drowned thanks to a gigantic grasshopper, the bastard.
After a few moments a young dark-skinned man walked in, giving them all a hundred-watt grin as he introduced himself as nurse Harley. He glanced over Hannah’s clipboard and clicked his tongue.
“I think Coyote has something, so we’re heading back in.” There was a pause as they reached the first building and they stepped through that barrier. “No, I don’t know. Stand by.” Clint whispered, and then it was truly silent. Their footsteps shuffled and echoed down the narrow streets and Tony felt once again like he was being watched. He could sense Clint’s uneasiness behind him and they picked up the pace a bit.
Steve let out a surprised laugh, which turned the heads of the others in the room.
Tony also made a fuss about the bed while Clint just scoffed.
“Bring water?” Steve guessed, repeating the scoop-and-dip motions. They were separate signs, the scoop meaning ‘bring’ and the head-dip to indicate a drink. In the case of them being cats, it was water by default.
After a few minutes he found the place he had entered the town and released a breath of pure relief, passing the barrier and letting himself relax slightly as the sounds of the wind and birds filtered back into his ears. The comms also crackled from static into voices- angry voices.
can’t I lay on my own, god-damned couch?!” Tony shouted, and they all sobered up a little. They apparently hadn’t realized how much it bothered him. “It’s my couch. My chair. My whatever. It’s not like i’m going into your bedrooms and rolling all over your pillows. Lighten up.” Tony finished, wracking his brain for any other glaring mistakes his team had made. He didn’t come up with anything so he flopped back down, tirade officially over.
Clint was quiet for another minute, before he partially uncurled himself and looked at Tony for the first time that night. His eyes were bloodshot and he was sporting purple under-lids, looking really-not-okay. They looked at each other and Clint finally deflated, resting his forehead on his knees as he started to talk, a hoarse whisper that seemed too loud, filling up the room despite trying to curl in on itself and disappear.
The first snow of the year had fallen while Tony was gone, and the next time Steve and him went running, it wasn’t quite as pleasant as it usually was. Tony ended up with snow clumped to the fur on his belly, between his toes, and all the way up his legs. Steve just laughed at him and Tony grumbled as they finished their lap and came in through the front door, pausing to get themselves as snow-free as possible. Unfortunately, the snow was matted in Tony’s fur, and he stood there uncomfortably as Steve kicked off his own sopping wet shoes.
“Good morning.” Steve said, looking up from the book he was holding. Tony didn’t catch the title before he put it down. “It’s around ten o’clock.” Tony looked around, but he really couldn’t tell besides the analog clock hanging across the room; they didn’t have any windows and the only difference from earlier in the morning was that the hallway lights were on.
Leave it to Barton to ask the important questions. Tony turned back to look at Peter, and gave him a soft
“He owns seven cats, as of two days ago. Well, maybe six, I don’t really know how this actually works, they just made me sign the papers and told me not to fuck up under pretense of extreme pain and the literal obliteration of any future conquests, to quote Agent Coulson directly. I can call him, if that’s what it’ll take for you to let me leave without being castrated. Please.” Peter was subtly leaning back while Pepper was slightly leaned forward, scowling at the kid as his rambling petered out to a nervous grimace. Tony reached up on his back legs and pushed Peter’s new Starkphone up and out of his pocket, pinning it to the floor and typing in Phil’s contact info while Clint watched over his shoulder and Steve took his turn giving Pepper’s slacks a new layer of orange fur.
Three hours and he’d nearly finished his smoothie, picking it up and sipping from it whenever he needed to think. He was on the last stretch for that wretched SHIELD assignment. He’d thought it would only take a few hours, but it continued to get more complicated, drawing out the process nearly to a full day.
Tony gazed at Steve, silently pleading for him to salvage the situation. Ever the team captain, he jumped back into the conversation.
“This is my PSA, and I just want to grab a quick burger. I won’t be long.” Peter gave the guy the saddest eyes Tony had ever seen, and he got waved in.
Something slid around his neck and this time when Tony screamed it came out how it usually did, hoarse and broken as he pleaded against Raza’s men to
“Of course not!” Thor scoffed. He turned to Tony and crossed his arms. “There are more ways to communicate than just words. Do you know Anthony Stark?” Thor said, giving a smug look to the others when Tony nodded his head slowly and deliberately. They all shifted uncomfortably and their faces went from doubtful to resigned acceptance.
“I trust him.”
“Clint, what are you doing? What implants?” Clint watched his face as he talked, then shook his head.
. Tony struggled, but Natasha had an iron grip, and refused to let him go.
Tony had naively expected everything to be all hunky-dory when he finally got all of the Avengers living in the same building (which had taken a lot of persuasion, money, and grovelling to accomplish), but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Everyone was awkward around each other, and most of them were the type of person who would rather have a fist-to-face than a heart-to-heart; which meant that everyone was easily set off, and little squabbles broke out over even small things, such as picking a channel or deciding who got the last of the leftover chicken wings. The entire mansion started to give off a perpetually irritated vibe in itself- unless that was just them projecting their feelings. Though perhaps not- JARVIS was just as short as the rest of them the longer it went on.
“This paperwork isn’t for you, Stark. Peter needs to fill it out before he starts.” Coulson got up and smoothed down his jacket, the very embodiment of suave as he swept out of the room, agents trailing after him like puppies. Peter turned to Tony with a look of fear in his eyes, and Tony patted him on the arm.
By that point it had been nearly three days of moping around and pretending that he wasn’t eating garbage, and it was getting old. Fast. Tony had already choked on a chicken femur and he wasn’t about to be killed by dead poultry. He needed to do something about the situation; he needed to take a stand.
Pepper heaved a sigh, picking him up and putting him back on the floor. “Go do something constructive, waiting around and worrying yourselves isn’t going to do any good.” She finished, herding them all back to the elevator and sending them down to the communal floor.
The first thing Steve registered was pain. His head was throbbing, and he felt like his skin was crawling with bugs. That was enough to make him scramble to his feet. He ignored the persistent pain in his skull as he tried to brush at his arms, only to look down and see himself covered in… fur? He staggered backwards and tripped on his uniform, which was huge, and not on his body. What the fuck? Did Loki turn him into a fucking
“COULSON!” Tony all but screamed, scrambling in Peter’s grip to be let down. The poor kid was freaked out, and he clutched at Tony to keep from dropping him. At first, Coulson didn’t seem to notice, but then his head dropped down to his feet, and he turned, making eye contact with Tony. “COULSON, COME BACK!” Tony wiggled even harder, but Peter juggled him from hand to hand and refused to let him down.
“Fine, whatever. Be my guest.” Tony sat down while Steve went to sniff at the sleeping agent and double-check his vitals.
“I was about to say the exact same thing. These are obviously Hammer tech too.” Natasha continued, smiling ever so slightly. At that she turned and rifled through a duffel bag at her feet. Steve continued explaining their mission log to Fury, but the talking cut off when Natasha tossed a severed robot-head onto the table, where it clattered to a halt right in front of Tony. He looked at her and cocked his head, but she only raised an eyebrow in return, as if saying,
Steve was still trying to pull a motivational speech out of his ass when Thor spoke first.
“So how do you know all this? And who are you, anyways? Are you actually a dog?” Bruce asked rapid-fire, but Tony knew exactly what to say, stepping on the tube of paint to get more and start a new sentence.
“With all due respect, Hawkeye, Agent Jackson and I were the only two grounded, and one of us had to stay at the jet. If I hadn’t brought Coyote, a family of five would have died.” She said, and there was a beat of silence as the last unspoken question seemed to cross all their minds.
“I can’t say for certain what happened, but he got her from the north-west corner of the third floor to the stairwell of the second, so they were close to getting out when the building came down. Took us two hours to find them. He was holding up at least two hundred pounds of plaster and debris the entire time, keeping Nat from being crushed.” Steve finished. Hannah nodded with a concentrated expression on her face as she felt Tony’s legs up and down and rotated his ankles.
Fury wasn’t amused as they entered the room, eye narrowed at Tony.
Tony turned to Steve as well, who ran a hand down his face, but eventually waved at Tony to go ahead.
“Peter! He lives in Queens, this must have been why he left so quickly- what an idiot, he went straight home to check on his aunt, we have to do something, he’s going to get in the way and get himself killed-” Tony rambled, leaping off the couch and running back into the kitchen, the rest of the group hot on his heels.
“I’m sorry, Anthony, but I must return to Asgard to confer with Odin and the council. I’ll inquire as to the reversal of your condition, but I can not promise you that I will get any immediate results.” Thor said, giving Tony one last smile before he shut the door and strode down the driveway with a determined set to his shoulders. Tony watched from the window as Thor raised his hammer and called on Heimdall. The beautiful rainbow colors returned and whisked Thor away, and Tony felt himself wondering- as always- how much of it was science, and how much was purely magic.
“One for you, two for Widow, and three for both.” She said, and Tony only gave two barks. He was fine; his ankle was going numb and he had burns on his tail and forelegs, but he would be alright. He still smelled blood and he had no idea where Natasha was bleeding; she needed help first.
Natasha and Clint both frowned but didn’t mention it again, instead listening intently to the information they were given on the Starkpad Fury had brought.
“That was awful.” Natasha said, getting up and slinking in Coulson’s shadow as he motioned for them to get into one of the vans. Clint trotted after her with his ears back and the rest of them filed past, Tony hopping in last and wedging himself underneath one of the seats. He didn’t want to talk to any of them after that. He wasn’t even sure if they’d want to either, since everything Coulson had said was right.
Steve’s hand made an aborted move forward, like he wanted to touch Tony, but he wasn’t sure if it was a good idea. Tony resented the fact that they might start treating him like he was glass. He moved sideways a bit to bump his back against Steve’s hand, letting him smooth the fur down Tony’s spine. Petting never got old and Tony sighed, lowering himself down on the pile of towels and letting his muscles relax while Steve scratched behind his ears.
Nurse Harley left and the other three members of the team scrounged up some plastic chairs to wait in. Tony glanced at them in confusion and Clint shrugged, pulling out his phone and tapping away at the screen.
What the hell was their
Tony sat and seethed, watching the TV as the quinjet left the mansion and shot across the city towards uptown.
“Come on, Vivian, it can’t be that bad!” Peter hissed, trying to shove Tony’s head back into the backpack without hurting him. They had gotten up early to go shopping for cat supplies, and not even five minutes in the back pack and Tony was soooo done. He’d made it as far as the store, and in Tony’s book, that in itself was enough of a win.
Tony woke up feeling like an empty husk, and only anger fueled him enough to get up and trudge back out to the kitchen. The whole mansion was clean, and the ruined couch had been removed.
Coulson used his wrists to press circles into his temples while Hill subtly rubbed his back.
Fury said something, but Phil talked over him. “Yes, JARVIS?”
“Aunt May, I’m home!” He called, thundering up the steps and shutting his bedroom door behind himself.
“We were just heading down to interrogate Loki, if you wanted to come.” Peter asked, a little shy as he hid behind the phone, with Coulson still on the line.
Deep breath. Tony was fine, he wasn’t going to die. Yet. Which meant he had to get away from Loki or otherwise stop him- alone, suitless, and no longer human. So Tony did what he did best, and turned his fear into a shield of anger, posturing in the vain attempt to buy time before the Avengers responded to the alert he’d put out before Loki turned him into a dog.
“Are you sure you want Pepper to find out about this? She’ll fret, and you know how much it stresses everyone out when she’s worried. It’s contagious, man-”
“Alright, Coyote, you’re being deployed as soon as it’s dark out. Make sure to memorize that map while we wait.” Natasha said, unstrapping herself to work on setting up the comm connections. They were coming up on their target; the quinjet would be set down a mile or so out, just in case there was anyone was lurking around in the vicinity of the town. Tony was headed to the church- it was so dilapidated and battered that there wasn’t even a roof, so he would have to be careful navigating his way through. It was mostly one big chapel so as long as he steered clear of debris he would likely be alright.
“Jesus, do we have to wear those all the time? I refuse.” Clint jumped down, Thor right on his tail. The rest of them let themselves be strapped up. Natasha was having a hard time balancing herself, though Steve and Bruce figured it out pretty quickly.
“I’m serious. Loki is the one that fucked you over- he made you think you wanted to help him. That wasn’t you. It was never you, it was his scepter, he turned you into a pawn and that was
“Fury wants to be briefed as soon as possible, so we’ve been summoned to the helicarrier for a meeting in exactly an hour.” Steve said as he leaned back into the room, pointing his phone at all of them to emphasize his words before he vanished again. Clint stood up and brushed himself off before holding out a hand to help Bruce up.
After what felt like forever, Tony reached the bottom of the steps. The door had an old-fashioned keypad, which ran on its own separate generator in the event of a power outage, which suited his situation well. His nose was clumsy with the disk in his mouth but he painstakingly pressed the combination in and waited for the heavy ballistic bay door to slide open.
“Did I wake you?” She asked softly, dropping a hand to card her fingers through the fur on the back of his neck.
“Wait, wait, wait. How do we know he’s not lying?” Bruce called, and they all looked over at where he was leaning against the door frame, hot cup of coffee clutched in his hands and hovering just beneath his chin. “Maybe this dog
“I see them!” Someone called, sunlight suddenly filtering in through the cracks in the drywall. Several pairs of hands lifted up the piece that was on Tony’s back and he pushed off the one that was resting on his head and neck. It was too bright and there were so many people, his body completely exhausted. Tony’s legs wobbled and gave out so he laid down next to Natasha while there was a path cleared to lower a gurney down for her; there was no way to wheel one in. Someone’s hands slid under Tony’s chest and he was lifted up and out of their way.
“May?” Tony meowed, rubbing against her shoulder and trying to rouse her. Her forehead creased for a moment before she squinted her eyes open. “May! You have to come with us, SHIELD can get you to the hospital.” He insisted, knowing she couldn’t understand him, but trying to nudge her to her feet anyways.
instead of someone else. Especially when it involved Starbucks- his guilty pleasure when he had the time.
“Those energy readings we picked up weren’t like the tesseract’s- we’d see the match immediately. Are you one-hundred percent sure?” Fury asked, and Tony nodded impatiently. They sat in silence for a few more beats and listened to the scratch of the agent’s pen before Fury hummed and pushed his chair back.
“Please don’t do it again, though. Nearly gave us a heart attack.” Steve muttered, entering the jet and setting Tony down on a blanket that must have already been arranged by someone else on the team. He fit a clear cup over Tony’s muzzle and it was like a breath of fresh air- quite literally, since it was an oxygen mask.
of his team, like metal and ozone and leather. All the new smells were overwhelming and it took a lot for Tony to ignore it and focus on what he was doing.
Bruce walked over and peered over Natasha’s shoulder, humming and sipping at his mug.
across the street, but he felt more uncomfortable without keeping an eye on the tesseract, so he reluctantly turned and slowly circled it, trying to keep his back against whatever meager cover he saw.
Tony wasn’t sure how long he stood and waited. He had no idea what he was waiting for, but suddenly the tesseract blinked out of existence and he was left in the darkness. It was heavy and the air was thick in his lungs, and it felt like the room was suspended in that second when you knocked something off a table and couldn’t do anything but watch it as it fell.
“How long has he been like this?” Pepper asked, gently rolling Tony over and lifting his head into her lap. He licked the back of her hand and let himself be maneuvered around as she wanted.
“We’ll be back around eight to get you out.” Steve called, the team’s chatter cutting off as he pulled the door shut.
“It bum rushed me, too, but I rolled out of the way and it was gone when I looked back.” Tony finished. Neither of them spoke up as they thought about what he’d said, and the comfortable silence lingered as Clint tossed Natasha her controller and unpaused the game.
“I know, I promise I’m not keeping him. In fact, we were just out putting up fliers to see if anyone recognized him. I’ll pay for his room and board until we find his owners, please, you won’t even know he’s here.” Peter sucked in a breath while his Aunt sighed out, rubbing her face in a way that suggested she wasn’t surprised.
Steve and Bruce were hovering in the foyer when they got back.
“I just shut him in his bathroom again. I didn’t turn on the lights, since that seemed to calm him down the past few times.” They didn’t talk about it after that, continuing on to other topics, like the most recent big bad, or the new kid they called Spiderman.
Steve stilled immediately, and they looked each other in the eye for a beat. Tony broke the contact and gestured for them to follow.
the Avengers.” Bruce twitched his tail and shook his head, but it was still fond.
The bomb was carefully placed in the middle, and Tony gave it a final nervous look before he bolted out and locked the door behind himself.
“I’m so sorry, Tony. I swear to you that I didn’t know, I would never have made you do that. I’m sorry.” Steve dropped his hands into his lap and he looked so sad. Instead of his usual kicked-puppy look, he had an expression akin to someone who had done the kicking on accident and consequently regretted their existence. Tony hated seeing that look on his face.
“I let the rest of the team come with Hill and I when we were looking for Tony, because being equipped and having supervision are perfectly acceptable safeguards for leaving the tower under a normal circumstance which involves minimal danger. This situation is much different. You disobeyed a direct order, for starters. Then you left with barely any equipment. And no- the suit hardly counts at all, you’re unable to use it. Forget the supervision part entirely. You came completely alone! Nobody knew where you were, and nobody would have known until too late if something happened.” Coulson seemed to run out of steam at that point, because he set Tony back down and scrubbed his hands over his face. His whole body deflated a bit and he sighed.
“I don’t want Stark getting fur all over my helicarrier, so let’s make this brief.” He said, as ill-tempered as usual. He seemed especially grouchy, though it was warranted; they’d had Loki almost within their grasp and he’d slipped right from the Avengers’ fingers.
“Why are you up so late?” He asked, and she glanced over at the microwave, which read 2:19 A.M. in bright green font.
Tony thought, but he didn’t voice it aloud.
Tony wasn’t complaining at the new development.
He slumped and went back to his designated bed, curling up to wallow in self-pity for as long as he liked. He didn’t have anything else to do, anyways. JARVIS was down. His workshop was closed. He couldn’t even go outside.
Tony sighed and motioned for the computers to be shut down, walking back to the doors with Steve right on his heels. They stood outside the elevator doors and waited with their sides pressed together, easy and quiet. They had mastered companionable silence before either of them had even realized they liked the other, and it was common for them to be together without being on top of each other all of the time. It was something Tony loved about their relationship, though they had only been ‘official’ for a few months, and they still had things to work out- but they’d made it this far, and Tony had faith in them to persevere through the rough patches. It was a bit strange to trust himself so much when it came to relationships, but it was really Steve’s fault. His positive vibes were contagious.
Monroe woke up a few minutes after Peter hung up with Coulson, and to say he was not pleased was an understatement.
“Guys, I have a plan. Cap and Widow, you keep eliminating the strays. Thor, buddy, I’m gonna need your help. I’ll lure them to the water, and you deep fry them to the American standard of perfection.” Thor copied enthusiastically, flying past Tony to meet him at the bay, while Steve started to 'Hen', as they called it.
There was more silence before someone else came on the line, the agent who had initially gone in with Tony.
“Oof!” Peter had the breath knocked out of him and he stumbled back in surprise, hands automatically coming up to keep Tony from falling as the cat rubbed his face all over Peter’s chin.
“Coyote, Agent Dawson is going to do one last equipment check before you leave.” The woman who hooked up his vest sent him over to a man tapping away at a tablet, who held up a finger until he was done typing. He then pressed a button on his comm and did a check- everyone was on and operational, so Tony had to sit there for almost a minute while Dawson fiddled with his vest.
. That was the name of one of his last-ditch backup plans; Laundry Day was a code that could be used by the other Avengers if Tony was killed and someone had acquired his tech. It was an override that caused every single armor he’d ever built to initiate self-destruct.
Tony had heard enough, so he crept away and went back to the main communal area. It made him uncomfortable how much Clint seemed to see right through his media persona, but he could put it aside to deal with more pressing matters. On top of them hating him, none of them trusted him. It stung a bit, since he’d never truly let any of them get hurt during a battle. There might have been a few last-second saves, but Tony was a multi-tasker like that. He knew what he was doing. He was a professional, godammit!
“I need backup, four of these-” Natasha said over the comms, grunting and swearing before she continued. “Four of these robots have me cornered. Location is-” There was a deep boom, and Tony felt it rather than heard it over comms. Natasha was silent after that and his nerves spiked, pacing around the jet and likely annoying the pilots.
“Steve? Have you found something?” Maria looked up and down the road, but Steve darted into the alley, nose on the ground like a dog. The rest of the team flanked him as he made his way to a dumpster. It reeked of garbage and rotten food, but there was something underneath that, and Steve was sure it was Tony.
“No! That’s not my point!” Steve shouted, throwing his hands up, and dropping his own helmet in the process.
Tony didn’t usually delve into his mind and work out his emotions, but the past month had been trying, and he wasn’t feeling like himself. When he was feeling off he usually had a few glasses of scotch to put things right, but that was off the table.
“Tony, take a deep breath. Peter is going to be fine. He’s incredibly smart, and resourceful. He’s not going to put himself right in the path of danger. He’d take back streets, keep tabs on the news, and make sure he could get around without being too near the fighting. Just breathe a bit and we’ll come up with our next game plan.” Steve soothed, gently rolling Tony onto his stomach and lying across his back so he could groom Tony’s ears.
when you need to do something or go against orders. I understand that you’ll see someone in danger, or you’ll realize the solution and need someone to cover while you do what it is that you need to do.
“Ready to take a trip to the province of Benevento?” Fury grinned at Tony’s confusion, but he didn’t elaborate. They were taking him to Italy?
“If Stark really is actually Loki, we need to go deal with that,
. For several moments there was a commotion all around Tony but he couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe.
“What’s going on? I didn’t know Tony had cats… Pepper’s allergic.” He stepped carefully past them, and began to race up the stairs that led to the roof. They all felt a bit put-out as they watched his heels disappear up the steps.
Peter looked a bit awed and vaguely intimidated, but he was right on their heels the whole way back.
“Paws, you mean.” Loki stood up and laughed, striding over a few feet and picking up Tony’s pile of discarded clothes. With a faint white glow and a matter of seconds he transformed himself to look like the spitting image of Anthony Stark. He gave Tony a smarmy grin before he changed into the jeans and shirt, and then nobody would have been able to tell them apart. Well, before the original Tony became a dog, that is.
but Tony sprinted past him and kept going, through the kitchen and into the dining room. He managed to get around Natasha by darting under the table and back into the kitchen, but as soon as he rounded the island she was there, and she grabbed him around the ribs and lifted.
“You can use one of the computers in my lab, Tony.” He said, and Tony jumped up with a sudden urgency.
Anyway. Secondly, he still hasn’t taken a bath since Afghanistan, and he would probably have a panic attack before the lathering could even begin, so it honestly wouldn’t be worth it. He’d rather stand on the mat until it melted off.
“Well, I’ll give Fury a-”
It was peaceful, and Tony felt a small bubble of content blossom in his chest. The team felt more like home than the mansion itself ever had- and likely ever would.
Otstupit = Retreat, back up, step back, etc
Tony lured them all the way to the docks, hovering over the water while almost half the grasshoppers slipped over the retaining wall before they could stop. The remaining bugs chattered angrily and a few even jumped at Tony in a vain attempt to avenge their drowned brethren. At least, that would probably be their motivation if they were sentient, but they likely just wanted to eat Tony’s gauntlets off.
Steve gave a tiny nod, as if he decided he’d said everything he wanted to say, and went back to attacking his PB&J. Tony sat for a few seconds to digest the half-lecture half-speech and set his jaw. He understood what Steve was saying, but sometimes he didn’t have
It was all fine and comfortable until they reached the door of the bathroom. Tony’s legs froze and he stopped, unable to make himself go forward. What if he got shut inside, alone, in the pitch-dark?
“I shall show you.” He took off Tony’s old collar and fastened the buckle on the new one.
as he went to get out the cookies, setting them on the racks to cool off. After he put in the next batch he then proceeded to climb up onto the fridge and crouch there with a slingshot ready. He had a whole bag of what looked like marbles; he had one loaded and he kept his gaze trained on the door, except for when he glanced at Tony and waved his hand as if to say,
“Two active agents, one emergency medic, but we can have another jet down in less than ten minutes.” One of the pilots said, zipping up her suit and getting a gun out of the weapons cage. The other pilot got out Tony’s gear and he could barely make himself sit still as he was suited up.
“Hey Stark, Thor is back. And we’re also getting a dog, hope you don’t mind.” Thor and Tony were at the front of their little group, and when Loki turned around, he looked them up and down with a look of mild interest. He searched Thor’s face and seemed to realize that he knew, dropping the expression for one of disdain.
“Hi, uh, sorry, Miss Potts, I’m Peter. I’m cat-sitting for Tony Stark, while he’s out of town. For business. I think?” It was an uncertain ending to a lame excuse, and Pepper was growing more and more skeptical as they stared in the awkward atmosphere. “I have clearance from Coulson. Phil. Uh, Agent Phil Coulson?”
“That was exciting.” Natasha rasped, and Tony whipped around to see her laying in the other bed. They must have brought her in while he was asleep. Tony’s tail wagged a bit and he didn’t really mind the affectionate display; he was just glad that she was alright.
“There are different sides to Stark, according to Pepper. And after she pointed that out-” Clint was thrown over Natasha’s shoulder, and hit the mat with an
“Steve, please calm yourself.” His voice was a deep rumble, and when Steve actually pushed down the fear that was trying to choke him, he recognized the tone and the odd way he structured his sentences.
Tony looked up, and Bruce’s lips thinned before he took a few steady gulps of steaming coffee.
There wasn’t another delay as they got back on the quinjet as left Italy- and Tocco Caudio- far behind.
No one would ever know, anyways. It was Tony’s secret. And he was going to take it to the grave.
It would have been mildly annoying if she had locked him in the bathroom with the light on. It was terrifying that she hadn’t even bothered with it, and Tony felt fear begin to crawl up his throat and start to strangle him.
Oh well. He had work to do, anyways.
, but Tony’s conscience was louder. It was screaming
Tony’s eyes landed on the tree he had been under. It was only a couple feet from the fence; maybe he could jump off of it to reach the top?
“Alright, alright, don’t panic. He can’t have gone far. I’m mobilizing a team of operatives who will be there shortly, so please give them some room to work. Once I’m done with my meeting I’ll be right over to help, okay? I’ve got to go.” Coulson hung up without saying goodbye, and they all sat there for a few seconds, angry and unable to do anything about it.
“You just really want to be up there, don’t you?” He cooed, setting Tony on the bed before turning to open his closet. He felt slightly insulted by the coddling, but he was really liking the petting more than he cared to admit. Peter changed into a pair of fleece pajama pants that had little penguins all over them (Tony almost burst into laughter at the sight of them, but it hurt his throat to laugh and it just sounded like a hacking noise anyway), schootching the cat out of the way so he could clamber under the covers. “We’re getting up early tomorrow, so I suggest you go back to sleep.” Peter said, before rolling into his side and falling silent.
“You can go now, Tony, I’ll turn off the locks.” Bruce said, getting out his phone and tapping at it a few times. Tony wasted no time in limping across the house and down the stairs, right into Bruce’s lab. He hopped up on a stool and prayed that his paws would register on the screen.
, shuffling out of the kitchen and hopefully towards the bedrooms, where he could get some real rest. He’d mentioned not being able to get more than four hours a night, which even in Tony’s book wasn’t nearly enough.
“Tony, what do you think?” Steve asked, which stopped their chatter for a few moments while they all zeroed in on Tony.
“Why is your tail twisted in such a knot? Did you think I was gonna finish him off? I was just making sure he’s still alive. I’m not going to hurt him when he’s unconscious, that just takes all the fun out of things.” Clint scoffed, gently rolling the cat over and checking to make sure he was alright. Tony felt suddenly adrift, not sure what to do. Of course Clint wouldn’t do that.
. You and Steve are totally dating, right?” The rest of the cats dissolved into quiet chuckling, while Tony gave a small nod. It wasn’t…
“We’ll figure this out, Clint. Loki is in the same boat we are, he’s bound to change us back once he wakes up.” Steve sat down, twitching his whiskers in confusion when he saw the blank look on the archer’s face, which slowly turned to a look of horror, and finally settled on irritated acceptance.
Tony was still exhausted when he got off the quinjet and shuffled his way to Fury’s office, half-heartedly scratching at the door in lieu of knocking.
It wasn’t always a matter of secrets or discretion, though. Most of them didn’t want to be seen as weak or mentally unfit to be an active member of the team. Tony especially was careful, since his position was rocky, being signed on as only a consultant for SHIELD. He knew that Fury would probably jump on the opportunity to give him both the metaphorical and literal boot.
Tony had barely finished his food when Peter’s chair suddenly screeched against the tiled floor. They both hissed and looked over at him in time to see him vanish into the hallway, footsteps echoing for a few moments before it was quiet again. Pepper looked after him with an incredulous frown on her face.
“I’m fine, sour-patch. Right as rain.” Tony said, wishing he could gloss over that little episode without anyone talking about it. Luckily, Rhodey always knew what Tony needed.
Steve stopped mid-step, and Coulson barely avoided stepping on him.
“Okay! Well, we can confirm that he’s… a little enhanced. But nothing crazy. He’s mostly just specially trained.” Clint cut in, a smirk curling his lips. “And you can definitely pet him. He doesn’t bite.”
He kicked his chair, and it smacked into the wall with a dull thwap. The kid sat down on his bed and put his head in his hands. Tony, feeling oddly guilty after the display of aggression, bumped his head into the kid’s arm. He heard a sigh.
“We need to split-” The agent started, but Tony barked loud and harsh, and she fell silent. He turned and cocked his head side to side before he made up his mind, nearly sprinting through the halls towards the faint yelling he could hear. The agent was following behind and swearing as she jumped over beams and fire, doubling her pace when she seemed able to hear the noise too.
“They can be in here, but they are
“Normal dogs would have already gone into shock, but you’re even up and moving when you really shouldn’t be. Which was a mistake on my part if I’m honest. You need to be laying down with oxygen and monitored fluids until you heal.” Hannah continued as she led them into a standard hospital room and pointed at one of the two empty beds.
He hoped they would believe him.
“Lastly, why the
Tony was cold to the bone but it didn’t stop his entire body heating with shame. He wanted to curl under a rock for the rest of his life because he was such a pathetic
Tony had always made his number one priority his teammates’ safety. When he was on the field with them, he could keep an eye out and prevent injuries. He felt less than useless as a dog; benched and forced to
The sarcasm was strong.
“What’s wrong, Clint? Why are you baking so late at night?” Tony asked, softly, since the silence felt akin to some testy creature- one he didn’t want to wake. It felt like a wrong word would make everything so much worse, and upsetting Clint further was the last thing Tony wanted to do.
“Well, I, uh, can I have some time to think about it? Joining the team, I mean? I can keep quiet about, uh, whatever happens here.” He assured, head moving minutely between Fury and Tony as if gauging their reactions. He’d definitely caught on to the fact that Tony had human-like intelligence, at the least.
Tony used his nose on the tablet screen, finishing up the sentence he had been typing.
“Well what the fuck is his problem, then?” Clint burst out, gesturing widely with both arms. “He’s usually an ass, but he’s really outdone himself these past few days. Nothing drastic has happened, nobody has hurt him or anything. Why the hell is it our fault that he hurt Natasha?” Clint was pissed, and he strode across the kitchen to start another batch of coffee. Tony saw Pepper’s nostrils flare and he flinched, preparing himself for the shouting. Instead she smoothed a hand down his back and gave him a few reassuring murmurs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m fine Tony, really. I’m actually more worried about you-”
Tony lifted his tail in success when Dum-E came rolling back with a glass of water. He didn’t end up spilling (they were both delightfully surprised) and set it down for them to drink.
“-ony, Tony! You’re fine, slow down-” Someone’s hands were on his shoulders, but Tony still couldn’t breathe in enough, his lungs burned like he was drinking fire instead of air and the panic hadn’t left, he was going to suffocate because of his stupid damaged lungs and the stupid-
It had been nearly a month since his first stealth mission, and this time, there was something in France- though he was going sans-assassins. Steve was immediately anxious that Tony had to go by himself, but he could use comms now, and he wasn’t helpless anyways, thank-you-very-much. Clint and Natasha hated it, too, but there really wasn’t much to be done. Natasha was benched until her new leg boot was off, and
“-Hurt?” Finley asked, and Tony whined again; he didn’t know if he needed to say yes or no.
Even if you manage to find where I place it, once armed, it will go off at the gentlest touch. So consider your options carefully.” He finished, smacking Tony’s head against the ground once more and leaving him to see stars.
“Well, it seems the party is over. It’s been rather dull if I do say so myself, and I must be off.” Loki sneered, raising his hands as if to cast more magic. The rest of the team tensed up for the fight, but Loki didn’t act upon his threat. Instead Loki looked down at Tony and put his fingers together as if ready to snap them and vanish.
He was so exhausted and drained; he didn’t even want to get up, didn’t have the energy to find Bruce or chew on a rubber bone. Tony wasn’t sure what he would do if he was put back into the dark again; maybe his weak heart would finally just give out and he could have a peaceful rest for once in his hectic life.
“Dude, slow down, you’ll trip and break your-” Steve didn’t catch the rest of Clint’s sentence, because he overstepped and was sent tumbling down the lower half of the flight. Clint’s pawsteps pattered down to where Steve was sprawled on his side. “What did I tell you? Are you okay?” Clint leaned down until they were almost nose-to-nose, and Steve groaned, rolling away onto his stomach. He felt a bit bruised, but otherwise he was fine.
These people were all crazy.
Tony wallowed for what felt like forever, until suddenly the lights turned off, and the whole ward was plunged into near-darkness, save the soft safety lights that lined the hallways.
“If you want to stay here, that’s fine by me. I’m going to help my friend- who is a small helpless teenager, by the way- and keep him from getting killed. I’m going to go and do my goddamned
Tony lunged up and sunk his teeth into Loki’s leg, biting down as hard as he could. To his surprise there was a sick
She groaned, sliding her hands to the floor and heaving herself into a standing position, leaning against the wall since she couldn’t put any weight on her bad leg. Tony rooted around the room and brought back a two-by-four that hadn’t been burnt for Natasha to use as a crutch. She seemed groggy, but she limped after him as he led her back towards the steps.
Tony nodded and dipped his paw again, spelling out one giant word in all caps.
“Calm down, man. You’re too tense. Mi casa es su casa, or however that goes.” Tony was the first one done eating, and he jumped up onto the granite countertop to hang out with Peter. The kid was in awe; he couldn’t keep his eyes still for more than a few seconds.
The quinjet touched down after a five-hour flight and they all stretched, though they still had hours before night fell. They at least had plenty of time to prepare.
“Tony, seriously!” Steve shouted, skidding as he slowed down to round a corner without running into anything. Tony was already halfway down that hallway and going as fast as he could, but Steve had more traction and was faster in the long stretch, managing to scoop Tony up as they reached the end.He had to quickly slow himself down to keep from hitting the wall with their momentum.
“You could have gone about it any other way! Instead, you let yourself get
“Is there something else? Did you leave something? You’ve got all your equipment.” Clint started muttering to himself and he made his way back, stopping when Tony backed up an equal distance. They stared at each other for a few moments and then Tony stomped his feet impatiently, backing up further before he turned to lead Clint back to the town. Something was
That started a whole new round of whispering, but by then, Peter had found his voice.
Tony felt nausea and panic rise up in his chest and he heaved in a breath, noting how much easier it was to breathe without so much weight in his chest. Wait-
“So wait, are you sapient? How? Are
The people were swiftly crossing the living area towards the kitchen, and Tony had scarcely a second to scramble as quietly as possible around the island to hide. He wanted to shout the alarm, but he’d likely be dead before any of the other Avengers could make it out of their bedrooms.
“Hey, Steve. Thanks.” Tony grabbed a sandwich and gestured to a spare seat, where Steve sat down and started in on the rest of the sandwiches like he’d been starved. Tony could swear that the man lived half his life in the kitchen.
Tony shifted impatiently in his seat and whined, pulling against the straps they always insisted he wear. Clint glanced over his shoulder and shook his head.
Steve was incredibly Not Impressed when he found them a few hours later, but he seemed to understand as he helped Clint clean up the mess and toss the unused dough in the trash. His only question about the whole incident was,
” Tony barked out a laugh, wrapping his tail around his feet while Natasha jumped up onto the table next to him.
Tony’s legs were still wobbly and weak from all the exertion and smoke he’d breathed in, but he limped a few shaky laps around the exam table. Hannah jotted down some notes on her clipboard and then set it down with a hum.
At some point, he heard the door open and feet fade back out of the bedroom, but it must have been another hour before he could make himself open the cabinet door and force himself back into his bedroom. Tony felt so exhausted and weak that he crawled under his bed with a blanket and slept in a small nest where no one could find him and put him back in hell.
“Are you sure bringing Stark in is a wise choice?” Clint asked, as blunt as ever. Tony would have been insulted, but to be quite frank, he was wondering the same thing.
He inwardly cursed the reflex and heaved a sigh, turning to face the other way before he flopped down and stared at the wall.
Tony growled, unable to pick up on the noise with all of the extra input. He could tell it was on a lower floor, but where exactly, he couldn’t figure out unless he could track the noise.
“My… name…. Is…. Tony.” Peter read aloud, watching in amazement as Tony typed on the small device. He didn’t look like he could believe his eyes. “Holy
Tony did his best not to worry, but thoughts crept into his head without consent, and he was starting to get antsy.
Until there was a resounding
“You’re not coming, Stark. One rookie mission for SHIELD doesn’t mean you’re ready for a combat situation. There isn’t much you can do without the suit, anyway.” He added as they touched down a block or so away from the fighting. Clint and Natasha ran off immediately, while the pilots started setting the interior up as a makeshift medbay. They were in the opposite direction from where the carnage was heading, so they were safe enough to stay put.
“Well, let’s go get this test run out of the way. Suit up and meet outside at the van in five.” Fury concluded and
“He went in alongside Agent Finley and they found a family of five. They were the last civilians in the building, since Nat had evacuated everyone else before she was cornered. She stopped responding on comms and none of us could reach her- which is why Tony even went in the first place.
“I thought JARVIS was just pissed! You mean he hasn’t been giving us the cold shoulder? He’s offline?” Bruce squawked, making the others all look over at him with confused frowns. Thor had gone to the kitchen after Steve, but now he was sticking his head back into the room, ignoring the dusting of what seemed to be flour in his hair.
“He completely trashed the mansion, made a mess of the kitchen, and then bit me. We put him in his bathroom for a few hours each time.”  Her eyes were scanning Pepper’s face, but her own expression was blank.
Tony looked down and nearly threw up. His reactor was gone, and he was going to die, the shrapnel was going to pierce his heart and kill him and the team wouldn’t even have any idea that he’d died and he would be put down as missing and never found again.
“I also don’t have a car. Or a license.”
“Dear God… Tony, did Loki get those specs off of the server? Why would he do that?” Bruce wondered aloud, fingers rubbing against his mouth and eyes wide as they watched the news.
a dog right now, Banner. Could you go clean up the kitchen? Clint will get the foyer, while Natasha and I get this room…” His voice faded out as Natasha continued down the hall, going into Tony’s room and opening the bathroom door.
we're almost caught up to where I'm at in the writing, so pray for me to type FAST. I know the direction, just gotta get 'er there. Hope you enjoyed the update!!
Tony didn’t want to turn his back on the
Tony’s head bobbed as he weaved between legs and avoided getting brained by briefcases and the occasional suitcase, hissing angrily when an oblivious businessman stepped on his tail. He felt overstimulated as he sped up, trying to block out the sounds and focus on the smells. He was familiar with many of the restaurants around New York, and if he could find one he recognized, he might be able to make it back to the tower with relative ease. Bolstered by his plan, Tony continued on.
His thoughts swirled.
Finally Tony heard something shift above him and he barked, voices muffled through the rubble but getting closer.
“He’s always got something we could be doing.” Clint muttered. They fell silent as they got aboard the quinjet and they almost made it halfway back to the mansion before an alarm went off. Steve immediately clicked onto the comms and the spies sat up straighter.
Tony didn’t feel cool stone under him as he ran but it didn’t matter- he just needed to get out, to find sunlight and Rhodey-
“Hey! Clint, knock it off!” He shouted, grabbing an empty cookie pan and using it as a shield as he ducked behind the island. “I’m not here for whatever you’re cooking. Fury is on his way.” That stopped the pelting and Clint groaned, draping his front half dramatically down the doors of the fridge.
Tony got up and wandered into the kitchen to see the oven on, two whole bowls of raw batter sitting on the counter next to the cooling racks.
“There you go. No fun-vee, no desert. You alright?” Rhodey asked, and Tony shook himself out, getting Steve to loosen his hold.
“Hi again. You just get into all sorts of trouble, huh?” Spider-Man said as he hurried back, crouching down to rub his hand across Tony’s side. “You okay bud?”
“It’s not the same as laughing as a human. You’ve gotta…” Steve trailed off and frowned, his nose scrunched up in concentration. Tony thought it was one of the most adorable things he’s ever seen. “You know that thing cats do, when they see a bird?” Steve imitated the noise, a quiet chattering sound. Tony made it back and Steve nodded. “It’s like that. Next time, try doing that, but louder and more of a… chuff, I guess.”
“Heartbeat is fine… No arc reactor?” He felt the fur around Loki’s chest, and when he didn’t find anything, he looked at the cats in confusion. “Is this Tony?” They all shook their heads no, and he seemed to perk up a little at that. Steve knew that Phil wasn’t very expressive when he was on the job, so the small shift screamed ‘relief’ to the people who knew how to read him. Phil set the cat down again and stood up. “The only other person up there was Loki. I’m guessing that’s him?” They all nodded, and he whipped out his cell phone.
“This is the Mark VIII, which sustained heavy damage during the Battle for New York. Mr. Stark decided not to perform repairs.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Everything snapped back into focus and Tony realized that he’d just made Steve chase him around the house and yard while he freaked out. God, he’d panicked- he’d completely lost it.
“Everything seems to be running fine, vitals are okay.” Hannah said, hanging the clipboard on the end of the bed. “Just press this button if you need help.” She tapped the ‘call nurse’ button and they all filed out, leaving Tony with Bruce, Steve, and Clint.
“Are you sure you want to go back in? It doesn’t look very stable. There’s nothing even here.” Clint objected even as he followed behind. Tony picked his way over to the heap of scaffolding and started to sniff around the whole area; another thing that had spooked him about the place. The only smell was crumbling brick and sharp dust, nothing alive and nothing green. Vegetation had only grown up the outside walls; grass was short and washed out while weeds were only as tall as his ankles. After thirty years of abandonment Tony would have thought that things would have been a little more overgrown.
“Loki transformed them all into cats.” There was complete silence on the other end, and they could almost hear the look on Fury’s face from the heavy quiet.
“Alright. The Avengers had a run-in with Loki, and he transformed them all into cats.” Coulson went right for the meat of it, without beating around the bush like SHIELD tended to do. Pepper stood there for a second and blinked at the phone. She looked down at the cats gathered around Peter’s feet, and suddenly her face went from blank to horrified.
“He traced words into the soil, so perhaps he needs dirt?” Thor said, but Steve shook his head.
The circumstances were almost identical to the last mission: abandoned town, strange energy signature, yadda yadda. Tony was surprised, however, when he saw that Rumlow was supervising the mission. he was part of the STRIKE team, and had no business on a non-combat mission. Plus the fact that Tony knew Steve hated him really didn’t help anything. The others were starting to rub off on him in their own little ways.
Tony knew better than to touch it, but he padded around the area, feeling the cold energy flow off of it in waves. It was the only place so far that had any kind of air movement. Somehow, it was colder still than the winter night. The chilled current cut right through his fur and prickled at his skin. He avoided the twisted metal debris to prevent himself from being shocked.
Tony was lying down underneath the coffee table when the pizza arrived, and the whole team (Thor included) piled into the living room, Natasha snagging the remote and turning the T.V. to ‘Say Yes to the Dress’.
“I don’t want to go to Malaysia or Taiwan, I just want to sit here and use up all of Stark’s flour.” Clint whined, twisting and landing on his feet as he fell off the fridge. Steve stood up from his position and set the sheet back on the table, giving Clint a Disapproving Frown as he made  his way back into the living room.
“The code was pretty basic, and all that’s left to do is have JARVIS record the motions.” Tony explained, hopping off the table and finding a clear spot on the floor where JARVIS could get him from all angles. Steve rolled back onto his stomach and peered over the edge of the table to watch Tony.
“I was thinking, hey, maybe we should get rid of these fucking locusts before they
He’d started around three-ish and barely had Dummy situated with a damaged boot before there was a soft
“What the hell? Scared the shit out of me.” He muttered, but Tony barked again, taking a few limping steps back. Clint frowned and scratched the back of his head.
Seeing Pepper, Tony was reminded how much he missed her, and even how much he missed being Iron Man. If he wasn’t turned back soon Fury would have kittens. Tony wouldn’t get kicked off the team, though. Right?
“So, what have we got here? You’re a beautiful boy… Tony, did you say his name is? He seems in really good condition.” Hannah picked up his feet and examined them, checked his teeth, his ears, and his eyes. She hummed to herself before jotting things down on her clipboard and then turning to Steve when she pulled off the Hawkeye hoodie and gently peeled back the gauze from the stitched wound on Tony’s shoulder. “This is really recent. What happened?” She asked, turning back and investigating it closer.
Two barks. There was a sigh over the comms before it went fuzzy and cracked again. Tony whined and only caught the end of her sentence as the sound came back.
“What is it? Did we miss something?” Clint asked as they came to a stop in front of the church. It was quiet and dead; not even the spiders still remained. Tony limped towards the door and Clint made an alarmed humming noise from behind him.
The content atmosphere didn’t last long, because- surprise, surprise- Tony got bored. Quick. The whole day he pestered the others, whining and constantly rolling over trying to make himself comfortable, which irritated them because -
“We’ll go see Natasha
“Well I don’t have the means or time- or, well, fingers- to make all the code for verbal communication. That would take a hell of a lot longer, and this is faster either way. I’m going to have JARVIS record me doing things like paw swipes and tail wags, and when I put them in certain orders, it’ll mean something to him and he can respond. Faster than morse code, and I already have a lot of human non-verbal signs coded in, so I only have to make an addition on top of those, and re-record the ones that can’t translate.” Tony was making his way through the paw motions he had pre-planned, JARVIS giving a helpful ‘bing’ whenever he was satisfied with the scan.
Most of the streets had been cleared of civilians, though the bugs were starting to chew through the buildings, and they wouldn’t be safe for long. Tony ran a few probabilities and wanted to swear at the results JARVIS gave. All of the available options resulted in civilian casualties and he refused to accept that.
“Sorry Vivian, I’m not gonna let you walk all over my stuff. I’ve already had several of these keys replaced.” He wheeled back from his desk and picked up Tony into his arms, scratching behind the cat’s ears. Damn, that was nice. What had he been doing? It probably wasn’t as important as this. He began to purr like a motorboat, and Peter chuckled.
“This might need stitches. Clint, get me the first-aid kit from over there.” Bruce ordered, pointing at the one hanging on the wall next to the doors. Clint hurried off and Tony scowled at Bruce when he started to press harder on the gash. “Sorry, Tony. Please sit still.”
“Can you guys distract her? I need to use JARVIS to find the nearest SHIELD team. They’re bound to be swarming all over the place.” Tony meowed, already trotting over to the armor and activating the wrist panel.
? Sorry to say it, Stark, but there is
Firstly, he wasn’t sure if he could survive having Steve lather him up and rinse him off over and over, having those strong and gentle hands all over his body…. Wait, he wasn’t supposed to be thinking like that! Steve was a loyal teammate and nothing more. Tony scolded himself, and banished the thoughts from his head.
“You want to go to Queens? Tony, I am not taking all of you over to that shitstorm. You aren’t active duty right now! You’re
“Loki-kitty antagonized the wrong cat, apparently. I was sitting here, minding my own business-” Tony rolled over and pointed at the table he had been laying on, “-when they both appeared out of thin air, fighting to the death. She kept telling me not to ‘get involved in something that does not concern me’, but that’s all the information I have.” They all looked at one another in uncertainty and Thor reappeared, humming in thought.
“Fury is stopping by later today.” Natasha announced, the thumb of one hand tapping at her phone while she ate a cheese danish with the other. “He says he has a debriefing for us, but I can’t say I know why he wanted to come here instead of us going to the Helicarrier.” Clint groaned from where his head was buried in his arms, and Bruce gave him a sympathetic pat on the back. Non-urgent briefings always meant that Fury had a stealth op for someone- usually the spy twins and occasionally Steve. Tony and Bruce were always exempt since they relied on brute force more than stealth.
“Tony, there’s not much we can-” Bruce started, but Tony cut him off with an irritated hiss.
Tony refused to die, he wasn’t going to go back to that bucket or that cave or those bastard men and he needed to get
. The entire floor was a shifting mass of black and Tony had no idea what it was until it started to crawl up the metal poles underneath him.
“Sorry. Anyways; team, this is Peter. Peter, this is team. Also known as Steve, Natasha, Clint, Thor, and Bruce.” Peter just blinked at them, but Tony kept going. “I don’t think you’ve figured it out yet- bless your young, naive soul- but we’re basically the Avengers, and-”
“Nyet. I am fine, thank you.” Natasha cut off agent jackson, passing by the team and picking her way to the aircraft. “We had quite a scare, Bruce and I, when the battle moved onto the mansion. We tried patching into the mansion comms, but the power grid has been knocked down and the generators aren’t working. You did a good job getting away.” Natasha said to him, and Tony’s tail wagged ever so slightly. He’d grown closer with Natasha after the battle in Queens that took them both out of commission, and getting her approval on his choices gave him a small surge of pride.
The second batch of cookies was almost done when Steve entered the kitchen, throwing up his arms when he was accosted by a half-dozen marbles.
“Alright, continue.” Tony got up and did a quick perimeter check, stopping when he noticed a muted blue light coming from one of the upper windows. Nobody commented on it over the comms so he went back to the main entrance and decided his point of entry.
that. Thor, how does that collar work?” Steve asked, leaning forward to get a better look at it. Thor chuckled and settled himself down in a chair that creaked ominously but held.
“Tis’ a common thing in Asgard, a normal spell put upon bracelets or jewelry for those who hath vocal or hearing impairments. Tis’ an enchantment that hears the thoughts of the wearer and projects them as spoken words. Not to worry, Tony-” Thor added when he saw Tony reel back in alarm. “-it only speaks the thoughts you wish to be spoken. Try once more.” He urged, and Tony leaned back when the others all leaned in expectantly.
“Relax for a second, deep breaths.” He whispered, demonstrating and trying to get Tony to copy him. He tried, forcing his chest to sync up with Clint’s, but there wasn’t enough air getting in and he started to hack again.
“Loki is gone.” There was a long few seconds of silence on the other end, and Tony wasn’t sure if it was because Coulson was trying to keep his cool, or if he had covered the mouthpiece with a hand and shot off a string of swears without them hearing. After a few moments he cleared his throat and Peter winced.
“You injured Anthony?” Thor asked, sounding like he’d been betrayed. It was a kicked-puppy sort of look that would make anyone feel guilty. Tony almost felt bad, but he had to remind himself that it was Loki, not an innocent civilian.
Steve let out an offended gasp, batting Tony playfully on the chest. “Language!”
is that-”
“Can I carry you, shchenok?” Natasha asked, bending down to his level. Tony could most definitely walk himself, but he’d gotten to the point where he didn’t even mind being carted around. So Tony nodded and allowed himself to be scooped up and carried down off the roof and through the mansion to the miraculously untouched briefing room. Since the backup generators were still off, the elevators wouldn’t work. Tony hoped that the food in the fridge wasn’t warm yet- but he likely wouldn’t need to worry, since without heating, the building’s temperature was slowly dropping. The random holes in the walls and windows didn’t help either.
Another explosion made the ground roll, and Tony’s priorities re-aligned to the possibility of the mansion being hit.
“Why did he bite Natasha? What made him do that?” Pepper glared at Steve, and he started to fidget nervously. Clint scoffed from his seat at the table and set down his coffee.
Twenty minutes later and Tony didn’t feel that he’d made much headway. He wasn’t tired yet, but he still had so much farther to go. Maybe he could cut through the alleys?
. Steve shot a quick look in Spider-Man’s direction, so Tony figured Steve was trying to be careful not to give away anything more than they already had.
Tony didn’t even have time to let go before someone clocked him in the side of the face. He was so startled that he let go of Loki’s leg and jumped back, barely managing to dodge the follow-up kick.
“You’re sure that you can’t speak to dogs? What the hell does he want?” Steve asked, subtly shuffling his feet and setting his jaw. The Jaw was never a good sign.
“None of us are close to her at all, we need backup. How many SHIELD agents are grounded?” He asked. The two pilots looked at each other before they shared a glance with Tony. They responded even as they started changing into their combat gear.
“Is she alive?” One bark. “Can you give me the number of barks for the floor you’re on?” Two barks. “Are you able to pull the tab on your locator?” She asked, and Tony shifted his head down, only to snap it back up when the plaster shifted. There was a heavy chunk above them that would fall right on Natasha’s head if he moved.
Either way, he needed to earn their trust and their acceptance. It hadn’t been easy just living with them, and Tony would have to swallow his pride to make them like him; but it was better, anyway. Tony probably deserved much more pain than he had gotten already and they were all inherently good people.
What wasn’t the usual was turning down into SHIELD medical. Even when they had injuries, it had to be severe for any of them to willingly accept medical care. Everyone besides Steve and Tony split off to go back to the hanger. Tony made to go with them, but Steve had his leash in hand (a requirement from Fury) and firmly tugged him towards medical. What the hell was going on?
“You’re welcome, Tony. You’ve got some dog-breath going on, though.” There was quiet for a few more moments before Bruce spoke up again, careful.
“Well, I suppose my ruse is up. Pity. I was so close to dismantling this wretched computer.” Loki stood up and didn’t even reach for his crutches before he smoothed out his shirt and took a step forwards. The other Avengers were finally convinced, murmuring to each other. Tony had already had enough.
Tony was the Merchant of Death, and if he had to spend the rest of his life seeking retribution for that, he was more than ready to clean the blood off his hands. No matter the personal cost.
Tony typed as fast as he could, unsure how long Natasha could keep the kid from noticing their conversation.
“If he breaks anything, or makes a mess-” She started, but Peter was already wrapping his arms around her and thanking her. Aunt May’s chin rested on his shoulder and Tony gave her a friendly pap on the cheek with a paw. She laughed and gave him a small scratch behind his ears. “He’s definitely cute.”
“Does she need immediate medevac?” She asked, and Tony took a moment to pause. The broken leg wasn’t life or death, the scent of blood wasn’t thick or strong. They could last a while as long as Tony could hold up the debris. He gave two barks.
Tony had no idea what he was supposed to do. The room was suddenly roaring with the echoes of the hairy insects and the scaffolding was screaming as it buckled; he was nearly thirty feet up in the air, and he couldn’t jump, he couldn’t climb back down because he likely wouldn’t make it in time.
“Stark is Coyote. Finley! I thought you said you had two agents responding? Stark isn’t an agent!” Clint said, and the agent- Finley- scoffed.
He jumped over a pile of snow-dusted bricks and looked around the lot, spotting what looked like the tesseract sitting in the snow- smack in the middle of the debris. It was sitting so innocently, but Tony’s instincts told him that it was there for a purpose. The energy was disinterested, neutral and uncaring- it was there to complete a task, and Tony knew it didn’t have the conscience to recognize morals. Obliteration was the only result of getting in the way.
“I wonder how fast we can get down the stairs…” Steve turned and hurried to the emergency stair access, meowing to let JARVIS know that they wanted him to open the door. As soon as it was open, Steve was bounding down the steps, Clint shouting behind him.
“You can’t communicate verbally, but you’ll still have comms to receive orders.” She said, pulling things out of a bag by her feet and hooking them onto Tony’s vest. “You’ve got a lot of equipment on, but we should get all the information we need so you can pop in and out really quick. There isn’t supposed to be anyone there since most of the town is abandoned, but always keep an eye out. And, if you’re in a jam and need help, rip this red tab out of here-” She tapped a small device she had fastened to the front of Tony’s vest, which was about the size of a gummy bear with a finger-length red paper stuck out the top. “-and it’ll send a distress call out to us. Agents Hawkeye and Widow will be the first responders, followed by the rest of the unit if backup also radios in. Got it?” She asked, and Tony nodded, running through the equipment once more to make sure he knew what he was doing.
“Aye, Steve. Loki cast a spell upon us in his rage, which seems to have altered the forms of us all. Even Loki himself.” Steve’s vision was different now, and he had to get up and walk around to see everyone. There were four other little bodies on the ground, and satisfied that they were all uninjured, he returned to his post next to Thor.
Tony coughed out a mouthful of water, head tilted up to keep his lips and nose above the rising water line.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Tony ventured, setting his head down on the cool counter while she stirred her tea.
“I don’t think you have the right to this cat, or to any of the others, for that matter.” Coulson and Maria both shifted slightly in their seats, exchanging a swift glance. Natasha and Clint jumped up into Hill’s lap while Thor wedged himself on the seat in between them. “Nobody who experiments on animals deserves to own any. Period. So I don’t know who you actually work for, or where you came from, but-”
He could do this.
“I know what we can do to inform Coulson of our predicament. Remain here, friends.” He raced over to the emergency staircase, and began to descend to their rooms below. Steve and Bruce looked at each other in confusion. He took a few minutes, and they finally heard him returning, the rhythmic sound of metal thumping up the stairs announcing him. When Thor stepped back into view he was dragging Mjolnir, walking backwards with his teeth gripping the cloth handle. When he came to a stop beside them, he curled his tail through the loop and shimmied underneath the hammer, balancing it on his back while his tail kept it steady. Steve was silently impressed that he could still lift it as a cat.
He wasted no time in using his teeth to pry apart the faceplate, tossing it on the table and using his paws to gently prod away wires and get a glance at the motherboard. Those were most
Uneasily, he slept.
, and away he went.
Tony wondered, and silently rose to his feet to investigate.
“Okay, Coulson, stop freaking him out! He’s just doing what he thinks is right, that’s all- Pete, bud, if you could stop squeezing me so tight-” Tony wriggled a little, shimmying his way out of Peter’s death grip. He licked his new friend’s chin and then got up onto the table, padding over to Coulson and papping him on the face.
“I’m really good at keeping things confidential, if you wanted to get anything off your chest.” Tony ventured, tilting his head when Clint huffed.
“I guess I don’t realize it, but I’m always doing something. I’m training, or painting, or reading history books and using the internet. I haven’t just sat down to breathe in a while.” Steve stared out at the cars passing by, and Tony stopped to think about that. He’d seen Steve as much as he’d seen the others the past two weeks, but he hadn’t actually seen Steve sit down much, besides for movie nights. The guy also seemed tense and wary the rest of the time which for the life of him Tony couldn’t guess why. If the others even realized how vulnerable they were without JARVIS they hadn’t let on, so it couldn’t be their safety. What else would Steve be anxious about?
“TONY!”
Through the haze of fear and lack of air Tony felt his body jerk as the grasshopper was pulled off. After a heartbeat of being dragged upwards he was suddenly much heavier, back on a hard surface and arms like lead, but still clawing at his helmet and unable to find the release. Someone else pushed his arms away and did it for him.
The agent gave a frustrated groan and pulled out a second mask and clipped it to Tony’s vest.
Tony started kicking his legs and twisting in an attempt to get down. The skin on his neck was screaming in pain from being held up for so long. It felt the same as being dangled by the hair on his head; Tony had experienced that more than enough for one lifetime.
“That was a lot of spiders. We lost the connection to your comms and the camera died, so I came in to check on you. What the hell was that crashing sound?” Clint wandered back towards the entrance to the church, but he was back in a flash and didn’t seem to realize that he was itching himself. Apparently the spiders hadn’t left yet.
When Tony sat up and shook himself out, he was met with a sight for sore eyes. Thor was looking at him in amusement as he lowered his hammer and scanned his biometrics to get in the gate.
Steve went about his usual morning routine and didn’t say much, besides asking if Tony would like to go with him on his run.
So they sat down and Tony recited the mission from start to finish as Fury stared at him with the same level expression the entire time.
“Stark is part of this mission. You want to keep your status as an Avenger, don’t you?” He directed the question to Tony, who nodded his head. If stealth missions were what it took…
“Friends, I have returned from my travels!”
“Well, we’ll need x-rays for his chest, too, so we might as well get it all done.” Hannah walked over to the curtain and grabbed the edge of it before she looked back at Steve and raised her eyebrows.
! Otstupit'!” She yelled, pushing a junior agent aside to reach the two of them, the agents stowing their weapons reluctantly. “Are you hurt, shchenok?” She asked, crouching awkwardly on the ground to reach Tony and check him for injuries. He minutely shook his head- he was a bit rattled from the day’s events, but he’d be fine after a little rest.
. Bruce put a hand on his back and scratched the fur until she was done.
Tony snarled and clamped his jaws down on the majority of Loki’s face, teeth sinking into the god’s cheek bones.
“Shit!” Steve spat, pushing past Thor to jump and slap his paw against the door release. It opened with a quiet hiss, and they all pushed into the room. Peter let Tony and Natasha jump down from his arms and he went to check on the agent, letting the cats search the room for any sign of Loki.
“Braddlebok is my favorite Asgardian dish. Mother used to make it when Loki and I were sick.” They all sighed with differing amounts of childhood nostalgia. Steve, at least, could agree that he missed Tony more than his mother’s chicken noodle soup.
“-and he’s not even…. What the fuck?” The footsteps stopped and Tony’s heart sunk; the stuffing. He’d just been so mad, and he had so much energy now, he was just- “STARK!” Natasha yelled, and Tony yelped, scrambling off the couch as feet started pounding after him and doors slammed open. Steve’s voice penetrated the haze of
“You defied orders and went AWOL in the middle of battle, when Clint needed your assistance.
“Tony, shhh, calm down-” Someone rested a hand between his shoulders and he would have laughed if he could get enough air to do so.
Tony meowed, which was the initial cue to JARVIS when he wanted to be scanned. He made a scooping motion towards his chest, followed by dipping his head once. After a second or two of Tony standing still JARVIS gave a ‘bing’, and Dum-E stirred from where he had been told to stay (after not-so-helpfully trying to help, and accidentally knocking Tony off the table), and beeped happily at them.
Tony sighed, flopping dramatically on his workbench. He
“Nothing happened. He’s just being an ass, like usual. Nat, could you put him somewhere out of the way while we clean up his mess?” Natasha turned with a nod and took Tony down the hallway.
Hey, sorry it's been so long. I have to be honest with you guys- this was originally written as practice, and I posted it on a whim, so nothing is pre-planned. The story is made mostly as it's typed (another reason I suck at updating, since the writing is sometimes slow going). So bear with me! Feel free to leave comments and kudos if you liked it, that really helps me to stay motivated, and reassures that this isn't a total crapshoot, lol. So sorry for the gap and I hope you stick around for the next chapter! :)
“I’ve got a good feeling about today, guys. Loki is in containment, There haven’t been any explosions, and I can fit into almost every small space I’ve found so far. It couldn’t be better.” They all exchanged exasperated looks, but Clint was already bouncing off to the kitchen where Coulson and Maria were putting together five bowls of cat food. None of them were thrilled about that particular development, but it wasn’t something that could be helped.
“You want a mission briefing, right? I’d like to get it over with sooner rather than later.” Tony said, waiting for Fury to step into the corridor and close his door with a resigned sigh. He led them down the hallway to a small meeting room, snagging an agent on the way. She didn’t seem pleased to be filling out paperwork instead of whatever she had been doing, but Tony couldn’t write and Fury was too high-ranking to do grunt work, apparently.
Tony’s brain didn’t work fast enough and the structure collapsed, taking him down with it. There was a harsh jerk every time he landed on the level below before it would jar him with the force of the impact. Tony was almost halfway down when the entire thing tilted forwards and he was sent sprawling into the hard ground and through the mass of insects. Bricks were digging into his side and his left hind ankle burned like it was on fire but he was running on adrenaline, he was already trying to get a purchase on the debris. The spiders immediately swarmed over him and Tony made an involuntary screeching noise as he scrambled to get up and sprint out of the church before the rest of the scaffolding fell and crushed him.
Loki, trying to get us to attack Tony. How are we supposed to know you’re telling the truth?” All eyes turned on Tony, and he pushed the roll with his foot to get more paper, smearing the last of the paint glob onto his paw and trying to use as few words possible.
“Where’s Tony? I don’t see the suit anywhere.” Thor trailed after Steve, his tail dragging along the ground.
. These spiders could eat metal and he couldn’t make himself move as they made quick work of the structure, causing it to jerk and wobble as the pipes gave out one by one.
for this irresponsible and reckless young kid. Many,
They waited for a few minutes and Tony was dozing by the time Hannah pulled back the curtain.
Let me know what you think about Nat's nickname for Tony! According to wiki, both Steve and Tony are fluent in Russian, so they both will be able to understand what she's saying, but I prefer just putting translations in the chapter notes instead of interluding to explain. Hopefully that's okay with you guys, but if I get any feedback that you want it the other way, I can change it :)
Then a few things seemed to happen at once; Tony looked over at Thor, who was spinning his hammer and waiting for a signal. As soon as Tony raised an arm that meant ‘go nuts’, Thor let loose on the group of bugs, and one jumped up in the time that Tony had looked away, grabbing onto both his boots and dragging him down into the water.
“Just a second, I need to take this call.” Coulson apologized, casting one last odd glance back at Peter before he left the kitchen and closed the dining room door behind himself. Maria had moved into the living room and they could just barely hear her voice murmuring through the open doorway.
“So this is Avengers Tower? It’s so…
“Well, that means we have an hour to kill. And Tony needs supplies.” Clint had a shit-eating grin on his face, but Tony had no idea why. He also detested the notion of supplies- he had anything he wanted there in the mansion. What else did Clint think he needed?
The shout seemed to trigger something, because the black cat flickered out of existence, and a junior SHIELD agent materialized, sprawled out and unconscious a few feet from the door. Loki was nowhere to be seen.
Please leave some feedback if you can, since I still think this sucks, and it really helps when you guys are encouraging about my writing! Every time i get more kudos or a new comment, i binge-write for at least an hour. It really helps boost my motivation! Not to say that you need to leave something for me to write more, or something like that. I just really love it! And I hope this chapter wasn't
“Thank God.” Tony huffed, watching at the scene of the fight grew closer on the HUD. JARVIS dropped them off near the beginning of Peter’s neighborhood and they all tumbled to the ground- scraped up- but grateful all the same.
coffee. This has got to be one for the books.” Tony found a plastic fork and plucked the takeout from the microwave, not bothering to let it cool before he dug in.
Tony wasn’t really sure what he was expecting. Fist fights? Maybe. Brawling over who got the last frozen waffle? Definitely. Avoiding each other and dishing out some cold shoulders? Only vaguely crossed his mind.
“What the
Tony was half-tempted to turn tail and run back to the quinjet.
She went straight for his bathroom again. “If you’re going to act like a child, you’ll get a timeout like a child.” She hissed, dropping him in the room and leaving before he could dart out past her legs.
“Where did you go?!”
“I’m bored out of my skull.” Clint whined, jumping up onto one of the sofas and dramatically flopping himself down in despair. Peter momentarily looked like he was going to take the collapsing cat seriously and check his health, but he relaxed a little when the other cats huffed and went back to what they were doing. Tony hadn’t come with them to the commons so he was in unfamiliar territory- literally. He’d never been there before, and he’d never truly met or gotten to know these people- well, cats- before. Bruce was happy to curl up in his lap and get a nice ear scratch but the rest? They all gave him a wide berth and seemed to prefer entertaining themselves to interacting with him. Which was fine.
“That smells awesome, what is it?” Tony asked, hopping out of the carrier and limping down the hallway to the kitchen. Steve padded behind him and his tail curled up when they turned the corner to see Pepper standing at the kitchen island. She was chatting with Peter and mixing something in a large bowl.
Time passed in the slow, repetitive way it seemed to be doing as of late, and Tony’s lungs cleared up. He was closer to finishing JARVIS’ repairs, thanks to a little help from Bruce. He sat with Clint in the kitchen a few times a week, though there hadn’t been any crying since the first time. Clint would bake whatever struck his fancy, and Tony would sit at the counter, licking his utensils clean when he was finished (as long as there wasn’t any chocolate involved).
“Stay out of the fridge, Stark. You have a bowl of food right here-” He nudged it with his foot, “- and you can’t have people food. You’ll get sick.” Steve went back into the kitchen and started to rummage around in the cupboards while Tony stood where he’d been planted and stared.
Tony dabbed the pad of his paw in the paint and started to write, being as neat as he could so that they could read it. All of them crowded around to watch, faces set in frowns as the sentence took form.
Sure, Loki was a bad guy- he caused the deaths of millions. He probably deserved everything he got. So why was Tony feeling guilty about watching him get ripped apart?
Though, it wasn’t anything he wasn’t used to. Tony Stark has been striving to go above and beyond since he was a young child. Proving to his father that he was worth attention, proving to SI that he was a competent CEO, proving to the world that he was good at being Iron Man. His father never gave him the time of day and he ended up giving the CEO position to Pepper, but at least the media agreed that he was good at what he did. The other Avengers? Not so much.
” Tony shouted, having regained some energy after nearly drowning. The team had benched him while they helped clean up since he’d refused to go to medical.
Did you check out the art in the previous chapter? If not, please do <3
“Tony?” Peter called, suddenly looming over him and scooping him right off the ground. Tony’s heart jumped with leftover adrenaline and he made a surprised screeching noise, flailing until Peter restrained him a bit. “Calm down, you’re alright! Relax!” Peter said, scratching at the back of Tony’s head while he watched the end of the fight and Tony waited for his heart rate to decrease. The rest of the group were all clustered around Peter’s feet, obviously itching to get involved but staying back since they all knew that Thor and Steve could handle it themselves. Tony watched Clint turn and make his way over to Loki and once again Tony felt a bit of panic, wriggling around and trying to free himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
have something.” Clint asked, frowning. Steve opened his mouth to answer just as Bruce flopped down into one of the seats between them.

Tony was seeing red and he wanted to hit something, or maybe chew on something. He took off at a sprint and went to the garage, noting with dismay that the doors had been closed since he’d left. Tony continued around the property to every single exterior door to find all of them firmly shut.
After their first night as cats, the team was more adjusted and ready to find their missing member. Clint especially, even though he hadn’t a clue what was going on when Natasha wasn’t tapping on him in morse code.
It was pretty much Tony’s fault, what had happened. He’d pissed Loki off, made the spell rebound, and dragged everyone out of the tower to go chasing after some teenager the rest of them barely knew. What was he thinking? That they could ‘save the day’? Granted, they found May, but all of those houses had people in them, and SHIELD was never too far behind with search and rescue. She likely would have been fine- just a few scratches and a minor concussion.
