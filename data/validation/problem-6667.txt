Like many people, he’d been taken aback with Toni when she’d introduced herself. Not only was her first comment with regards to his work as a scientist, rather than his monumental screw up in creating the Hulk, but her second comment had been the furthest thing from the disgusted mention of the Other Guy that Bruce could have anticipated.
Impulse had nearly thrown him right into the dent they’d made of the collapsed building, but it was a combination of Bucky and Rhodes, of all people, who’d pulled him back and dragged him to a spot of relative safety behind the floodlights that a construction crew had set up to help them continue their rescue efforts.
For a moment, both men were silent. Jim’s mind was racing, tormented by the fact that Toni had gone ahead and said her last words anyway, despite asserting that she wouldn’t. Did that mean that she knew something they didn’t? Something that might not give them the successful end that they needed? Because fuck that. If anything happened to her… if anything happened to her, he was going to bring her back just so that he could kill her himself.
To thank her, he was sure. His momma had drilled manners into him and he wasn’t about to forget them.
“You’re gonna kill me,” he groaned, half-resigned, half-euphoric as Tony swallowed his load down without hesitation. It was way hotter than it had any right being and Steve felt his softened member twitch in interest. “You’re gonna be the first person to kill a super soldier just by virtue of how ridiculously amazing you are.” His lover smirked, swollen, slick lips somehow adding to the sexiness rather than detracting from it, and rose gracefully to his feet while Steve got himself semi-decent, pulling his pants and underwear back up and almost wincing when the fabric rubbed across his sensitive member.
Stark. The anger cleared his mind, lit a fire under his skin. “Fuck them, and fuck all of you, too. I’m going to CT in three hours, I’m going to get my boyfriend back, and if any of you –
came the soft reply, free of her usual snark as Toni, probably for the first time, allowed herself to let go of her front. She’d kept it up for them, Steve knew, because it was her rock solid steadiness that always reminded them at the best and worst of times that they had someone else to count on. Now, they had to let her count on them.
She nodded reflexively, letting the words wash over her for a second and allowing herself to actually believe them. “I love you, Steve.”
He shrugged off the SHIELD agents with embarrassing ease, all but sprinting out of the door and trying to breathe through his panic enough to figure out where she’d gone.
“Rest well, young warrior,” Thor rumbled quietly, smiling faintly at the sleeping form of their precious little charge. “May good dreams follow you into sleep.”
Steve clenched and unclenched his jaw repeatedly as he stared into nothingness. His posture was ramrod straight and he was unmoving as a statue – in fact, at some point, he was pretty sure that he’d slipped into a parade rest – but his mind? His mind, on the other hand, was positively
The thing was, the Soldier wasn’t so much a mindset as a wholly different personality. Toni had explained it best, once, likening the Soldier to the Hulk, in that they both had a conscience and mind and decision-making and logical capabilities completely separate to that of their hosts, so to speak. The Soldier was created to the sole purpose of fulfilling a mission, but since breaking out of HYDRA’s hold, had gotten a chance to develop an existence through Bucky. That had just been another thing to freak him out, before, concerned as he was about how those developments would affect his ability to control the personality; and by control, of course, he meant pack away in the hopes of it never seeing the light of day again.
Choose between listening and not? Choose between who she was and who she would never be? It didn’t matter. It was still a choice, either way, and Steve had sworn, the very first time she’d smiled at him, that he would never be the reason that Toni changed any part of herself unwillingly.
Contrary to popular expectation, adopting Peter hadn’t softened Toni in that regard, not in the least. If anything, she became even more protective of everyone, although she generally hid it very well until it was brought out by the heat of the moment.
Biting back a curse, Steve gripped his shield; nothing else could withstand the force of his crushing grip. “Toni, baby, you need to tell me what’s going on so I can help. Let me help you,” he snapped, hoping that the harsh tone would be enough to bring her back from whatever place she’d fallen into.
Steve palmed her breast with his free hand, flicking her nipple, and leaned down to suckle the other one before she could catch her breath from the first sensation. She squirmed underneath him, moaning and arching off the bed helplessly.
“Alright, Winghead,” she nodded, and this time, the nickname made him smile widely. For some reason, it sounded all the sweeter, all the more special, coming out of Toni’s mouth. “You got it.”
Howard hummed under his breath, but there was no mistaking the keen interest that sharpened his gaze. For a fleeting moment, Toni thought about how much she’d done and given up her entire life, trying to get that much attention and recognition from her absent father, but in the next second, she realized just how little it meant to her anymore.
It made her wonder, for the first time in long years, whether there was any truth to the magic her mother had told her about.
Tony shrugged, but it was a motion that was forced to look casual. “We were kids. What did we know?”
Clearing her throat, she nodded. “I can do that,” she confirmed, heart aching at how instantaneous and powerful the relief was, that crossed Steve’s face. “I promise. I’ll be okay.”
As soon as he was put at least partway to rights, Steve wasted no time crowding Tony against the railing and kissing him. It was softer this time, almost lazy, like a slow-burn of desire rather than the inferno they’d just had. Because he could, Steve lifted his lover into his arms, waiting for the smaller man to wrap his legs around his waist cooperatively before claiming his lips again. He licked in as deep as he could, plucking the taste of himself from the inventor’s tongue and growling at how inherently right it felt that Tony tasted like him. Smelled like him, even.
“I may have doubted,” Thor admitted, still looking as jovial and guileless as a puppy. “Once. Possibly twice. But it is a mistake I will be sure not to repeat,” he added, softening visibly. Dipping, he pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek. When he drew back, some measure of solemnity had darkened his eyes, and it was one of the rare times that Thor had ever deigned to be serious, so she listened. “You were missed, Toni, verily. And though I applaud your actions as a warrior, I must beseech you as family, not to scare us like that again.”
Before Barnes could comment on that, Steve was cut loose, and Tony abruptly shifted his attention from the door to his advancing lover. Banner wisely finished taping his wrist and made tracks, but Barnes stayed behind. Steve’s usually soft and playful blue eyes were now flinty with fire, and whether that was anger at Tony being there, or anger that the goons had laid into him, he couldn’t be entirely certain.
What he didn’t know, was why he found himself standing outside Stark’s room, knocking tentatively as soon as the Senator had left, after throwing plans and logistics for his new job at him.
“You and Toni managed to figure out that power source problem yet?” he asked lightly, because he worried about the risks Stark had offhandedly mentioned when they’d first talked about the suit and its potential problems. He didn’t know what exactly the soldier was doing to himself, in order to be on the frontlines and have Steve’s back in this war, but he hoped to God it wasn’t anything that was hurting the guy. Hoped even more that Toni had managed to find a solution.
“Mrs. Navarro, can you tell us what it was like to be forced to leave the safety of your son in the hands of the most notorious mass murderer of our generation, and the most cold and uncaring women the world has ever known?”
Thing was, he knew firsthand how it felt. He’d been dealing with Toni being in danger, not since she took over at the helm of the company, as most people thought, but since before that. Since college. Which became extra horrifying when one realized that Toni had been 14 when she’d started at MIT, and 14 still when they’d become friends.
Nat slipped back into the kitchen, a slightly pouting Peter trailing behind her. “It was nothing personal,” she offered, sounding vaguely apologetic, but not remorseful. She reclaimed her chair and waved at the one Clint had vacated, in an invitation to join her. Steve sat down heavily, all at once feeling every bit of his years, even the ones under ice.
,” Tony spat under his breath, still rankling at the idea. Steve thought he needed to be treated like a wilting flower? A damsel in distress who needed protecting from his mob boss boyfriend’s enemies? Tony was going to withhold sex for such a long time. Hours, even. Probably.
“Breathe, Steve!” Nat snapped, dropping to one knee next to him, and Steve abruptly realized that he was hyperventilating. His chest was tight and achy and sore, and it felt like he was going to pass out, and oh
There was no one, not a single person on the face of the earth, who he would rather have at his side when his back was against the wall. When all hope was lost, when he was staring down the barrel of a gun, he wanted Toni to be the one he had watching his six. Because for all that he knew and trusted so many good and loyal men in the army, there was just nobody like Toni Stark when you needed to make the impossible, possible.
“Steve.” Tony’s voice was wrecked as he stumbled out Steve’s name, pulling back, but the super soldier chased his mouth insistently. With another little groan of acquiescence, Tony kissed him back, moaning prettily when Steve turned them both around and pressed him against the railing, slipping his thigh snugly between Tony’s legs. “Jesus, Steve,” he whined, breaking the kiss as his head fell back when Steve rocked gently against him. Heady pleasure fogged the super soldier’s head but Steve had enough presence of mind to seize the opportunity to latch his lips on to Tony’s exposed throat, biting and suckling until he was sure a nice, noticeable mark would form. “Fuck, oh
She passed the bodies on the floor with barely more than a cursory glance. Remorse might have taken root for any other person, in any other situation, but not for them. They only had themselves to blame for partaking; for being brainless enough to even look in the direction of one so precious to her heart.
It took conscious effort to uncurl his fists when he realized he’d clenched them. “Maybe she’s tired. You shouldn’t bother her.” Then, without much thought to the words outside of trying to divert Bucky’s attention, he added, “Why don’t you go ask Peggy for a dance? I’m sure you’ll be able to charm her into it.”
Although, judging from the shrill cry that pierced the still air around them, it might not have been too late after all.
The action was so reminiscent of her son that a lump formed in her throat. Toni fought back surprisingly insistent tears that sprung up at the thought of her family, and the phone call she’d had with them just a few hours ago…
“Ah, what could have been, Madam,” JARVIS deadpanned back, making Toni laugh in delight at the snark that her brilliant AI had somehow developed. Some – or, more accurately, most – of the Avengers had laid blame for that on her shoulders. “Alas, you chose Captain Rogers.”
Steve kissed her temple, swallowing the dizzying relief for a time when he could appreciate it more. After he’d taken his turn at the men who’d targeted his son.
It made his throat tighten a little, both because of the salute to his mother and because it was the perfect way they could have ever toasted her.
“There’s no repayment necessary,” she told the woman firmly, shifting Maico in her arms so that the strain lessened on her aching muscles. “You have a wonderful son, and I’m just grateful I could return him to you.”
world, that you won’t stand in front of, to protect him. He will live the rest of his life knowing that you will always defend him, and will never let anyone hurt him, not even family. He will live the rest of his life knowing that if anyone dares to threaten him, you will put them on their asses faster than they can realize what hit them.” Steve allowed every word to resonate with the fierce pride he had felt since the moment he’d realized what and who Toni had been fighting for. For her part, the genius had tears swimming in those beautiful big eyes that he had so often become lost in.
Toni trembled as she sank to her knees in front of the familiar statue. Her eyes traced the words she’d arranged to be inscribed there:
taking his love out for a romantic dinner, he would have taken Tony to this little Mom-and-Pop Italian joint that served the best homemade carbonara in the state, hands down. Tony had also told him once, during one of their deep and intimate conversations, that he was far over the clubbing scene, with all its pumping music and sweaty anonymity, so
Just the thought made a smile curve his lips. This wasn’t a life he could have ever predicted for himself, but at the same time, it was a life that he was constantly grateful for having. He had a beautiful, amazing girlfriend – and every day that he was with the infamous Toni Stark, he found himself falling deeper and deeper in love with the woman behind the name – and they had somehow ended up leading a group of the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, and that had been enough for him. But Fate had intervened, as she was wont to do, and Toni had one day saved a little boy from an attack that had already wiped out the rest of his family; the very moment that Steve had seen her curled protectively around the three-year-old, he’d known that their lives were about to change again, and true to form, barely a month had passed before he and Toni were adopting Peter to cap off their little family. It wasn’t conventional by any stretch of the imagination, but this family was his, and Steve loved every moment of the time he spent with them.
“I spent most of my adult life trying to do and be the person he’d meant for me to be,” Tony continued, gaze trained unflinchingly on Man-Child, who was beginning to lessen the pressure of the blade just slightly. Not enough to move, but enough to stop digging into him. “I made decisions that I told myself would make me happy, because it would have made him happy. It took me too long, and too much bloodshed and pain before I realized that I was trying to make a dead man proud of me. A dead man who had never cared about me in life, and probably sure as fuck didn’t care about me in death.”
Rhodey would have complained, only it worked wonders on Toni. Sounding a lot less frazzled, she answered,
Fear, that Tony was so careful never to show. Anger, that he was so quick to find when someone hurt one of the team. Affection, that Steve loved to see in his absurdly animated orbs. Pain. Regret. Apology.
He whistled, low and sympathetic, when he unwrapped the tape and caught sight of the bruised mess that was Steve’s knuckles. “Really did a number on yourself here, Captain,” he commented quietly, those clever and nimble fingers translating well into caretaker as he soaked a cotton ball in anti-septic and gently swiped it over the cuts. He blew across it lightly, a tender act meant to ease the sting, and it worked as intended; soothing both the sting of the alcohol and the sting to Steve’s pride that had been festering since that night. “The healing factor’s already kicking in,” Tony added, as if reassurance about his knuckles was what Steve needed. “You probably won’t even need it, but I’m gonna wrap it anyway…”
“Toni, what the hell was that?” he demanded, but the usual bite of command in his tone was replaced by something fearful and almost pleading. Oddly, the change seemed to work in his favour, because where the genius normally bristled whenever he used that tone, now she looked vaguely touched and definitely remorseful.
But never – not once – had Natasha considered that the earth would conspire to take its best defender outside the fire of battle.
About how she got upgrades done without Steve ever seeing another soldier spend enough time with her.
He was chewing on the name when Stark – the female version – entered, and he was a little surprised when her arrival wasn’t heralded by the customary snark or dramatic flair. Instead, she didn’t spare a glance for anyone, her face stony and set as she made a beeline for the submarine that the HYDRA agent had left behind. She tinkered around in the open panel, and to his credit, Howard Stark didn’t stop her, but him, Colonel Phillips and the Senator all simultaneously swiveled their heads her way when she casually remarked, “I can reverse engineer some of this. Scavenge some of it, too. Maybe try to find some distinguishable signature to something that we can try our hand at tracking.”
Which was a large part of the reason why he still didn’t know that she’d gone back to see her father after the incident, before he was sent back to the past.
“Nope,” Tony shook his head, still sounding like he was battling for his legendary composure as he tried to explain. “Ryan… he was the first person that I ever loved.”
Swallowing around her suddenly dry throat, she yanked the wire in her hands viciously. “Leave Steve out of this,” she demanded in a low voice.
Of that, Steve was already pretty sure, having seen some of Toni’s genius more than once. “I’m not really worried about that, but… you’re all going to be in some trouble at the lab after this.”
And what better way to honor his mother, and the sacrifice she’d made for him, than to turn SI clean?
“Of course, my darling,” Steve answered dutifully, sarcasm thick in his voice. It might’ve offended her if there wasn’t also affection dancing in his eyes. “Everything alright over there?” He paused, studying her, and something like worry made his forehead crease. “You haven’t slept since we left.”
Maybe Steve recognized the futility in arguing with her, or more likely (given his penchant to argue with her anyway, when he believed himself right) his fatherly instinct to protect Peter from fear and trauma overrode his own fear and trauma at the thought of Toni being in pain, but for whatever reason, her lover nodded once in resignation. He touched warm lips against the cusp of her shoulder, a tender admission of understanding, and Toni felt the tension unravel inside her until she breathed easy again. She did so hate making Steve worry, but Peter had been through enough in his short six years. He did not need to foster the fear that he would lose any more people he loved and counted on.
He closed the distance between them with big strides to go with his big grin. “Lady Stark!” Toni braced herself, and without preamble, Thor engulfed her in his arms. Miracle of miracles, his hold was exceptionally careful, likely seeing that she was hardly fit for enthusiasm in any nature. “You have triumphed in your battle! I had no doubts, I assure you,” he said as he pulled back, and Toni grinned in amused disbelief.
Finally, it was the nickname that did it, and Peter looked up at her from underneath wet, clumpy eyelashes. His face was red and damp from the crying and his eyes were pools of sadness and confusion that positively broke her heart.
Pain rippled over her after she automatically tensed, but Toni couldn’t help laughing at the typical entrance of their resident archer. It was so endearingly normal that she loved him all the more for it.
Shellhead hesitated for a beat before replying carefully, “We’re working on it. There are still some avenues left to explore.”
Steve laughed, finding that he was enjoying the company of whichever soldier was piloting the suit of armor. “Not just you,” he assured the man as they made quick work traversing the uneven terrain toward the compound, thinking back on how irritating it had been that Stark had flirted with Peggy right in front of him. Not to even mention the abhorrent way in which the man treated Toni, honestly, he wasn’t going to be winning any father of the year awards.
Snark was Tony’s default, as anyone who knew him could attest, so the fact that one of the men in the front of the van huffed audibly in barely veiled irritation meant that they really didn’t have any clue who they were dealing with. If it really was one of his rivals, then they clearly hadn’t done their homework.
“’Kay,” Peter nodded sleepily, snuggling into his bed and clutching the teddy bear that had been the only thing he’d wanted from his old home. “G’night, Mommy.”
Look just where it had gotten them? Okay, it was great that she’d saved that kid, the archer couldn’t possibly negate that, but what was the cost of her actions going to be? How could they be sure that it wouldn’t be the unthinkable, this time?
Toni piped up, and with all the experience Rhodes had in Toni-speak, that actually managed to clarify things for him.
Peter nodded against her and Toni hated to do this, but she knew it was necessary. The longer the little boy was here, the more fearful he would be. This whole ordeal needed to be over for him, and it wouldn’t be for as long as he was inside this room.
showed anything but the utmost respect to mothers in general. Mothers – the ones who did their jobs with love – were amazing and wonderful creatures, the truest miracle even in a world that had superheroes.
He was sorely tempted to call her on it right then and there, but another thing that the years with Toni had taught him, was when to push and when not to. The genius had a way of seeing multiple possibilities and charting several possible outcomes to a single action, so it was more than likely that her worry was based on a worst-case scenario, and none of them needed to be reminded of that possibility right now. It wouldn’t help Toni and it certainly wouldn’t help their rescue efforts. So Rhodes kept his mouth shut.
Tony awkwardly maneuvered his hands into the collar of his t-shirt to grab the butterfly knife still hidden along the arc. It took a ridiculous amount of restraint, but after a few minutes of sawing to the background track of Slime Man’s monologuing – which was surely another Bad Guy Requirement – Tony was out of his binds with minimal cuts and abrasions to his wrists in the process.
“You’re forgetting that Toni is the genius behind JARVIS,” Rhodes added, completely unhelpfully, but since Steve wasn’t really in the frame of mind to explain something he was only half sure he understood himself, the super soldier didn’t judge.
“So what happened?” he prompted, flicking his gaze at her arms. Toni rolled her eyes slightly but leaned into him, something that made Steve bite back a huff of annoyance.
Even when she frequently gave him heart attacks and arrhythmias with her tendency to prioritize her safety below that of others’.
He was midway through his internal rant before he realized that the grenade hadn’t gone off, that Erskine was smiling, and that Toni had stopped in her tracks. For a moment, all he could do was look at the brunette and idly register that for the first time, she had no cocky mask in place. Her face showed only clear and bone-deep relief, dominating just barely over sparking temper.
The events after his debut as a super soldier were fast and in a flurry. Before he could begin to marvel at his new body’s capabilities, he was being taken back to where they were discussing the group of German spies who had apparently infiltrated their base.
Drawing the covers over her sleeping son, Toni leaned down to press a kiss to his cheek. Peter barely stirred – a welcome change from the nightmares and sporadic sleep patterns of the last two weeks – and Toni latched on to the tentative hope that the worst of the trauma was over.
Thankfully, neither Clint nor the presumably present but silent Natasha, said anything to contradict her insane promise. Instead, the Toni was treated to the shuddery breath and the quick sniffle that meant, happily, that Peter’s crying was easing off.
From his left, Howard Stark was positively gaping. “We actually did it,” he muttered to Erskine, eyes a little crazed with excitement in a way that wasn’t nearly as attractive on him as it was on his daughter.
“A headshot,” Bucky repeated, standing over Slime Man’s body as another of Steve’s guys worked on his restraints. Incredulous blue eyes shifted to Tony, whose gaze was locked calmly on the goons as Steve’s people – Barton and Romanoff, as he’d heard it – led them out. It wouldn’t do to let any of his targets out of his sight until the room was secure. “A headshot, with a fractured wrist.”
With them being distracted, it had been easy for a reporter to sneak past the barrier, and unlike him and the Lieutenant Colonel, she didn’t have any qualms intruding on a tender family moment.
Because time was running short, she made quick work of the barricaded door, rather than drawing it out and indulging in a little psychological torture. Bullets sprayed across the expanse of the room, drilling into the armour as if they were peanuts being thrown at a tin can, and Toni waited for the assault to end with the patience of one who knew exactly how the world was going to end.
That said, he could safely say that his brain had entirely shut down on him as he attempted to comprehend any of the words coming out of Brock Rumlow’s mouth.
Steve entreated, and for all that he’d probably meant to sound gentle, there was still an edge of desperate misery that pulled at Toni’s heartstrings. Part of her immediately resented that she’d been weak enough to call her lover, and subsequently caused him the pain of spectating her own pain, but the insistent voice in her head (that always sounded rather like Steve himself) repeated that there was only strength to be gained by the connection between them. Shutting all her thoughts up, Toni focused all her energy on listening to Steve, letting her eyes fall shut on a ragged exhale.
As the guys began to heckle Hodge, Steve noticed the USO girls lining up to take the stage again, and gratefully made his escape. He heard it when the men’s attention shifted back to the dancers and he shook off the stage aide’s comforting words in an attempt to catch Stark before she invariably disappeared.
Not only had the man, reticent around everyone except Steve, allowed Toni to work on his arm and then eventually replace the bulky, HYDRA-made model, but he also willingly ventured into the genius’ workshop on an almost daily basis simply for conversation. The two could talk for hours about cars or mechanics, and according to Bucky, Toni was the best person among them to ask for help transitioning to all the new technology and era developments. It had been difficult not to be wary at first, and indeed, he’d had several moments where he’d wanted nothing more than to duke it out with his best friend, history notwithstanding, but in time, Steve had managed to look past his jealousy. He’d seen Bucky smiling and laughing and being more himself than he had been in decades. He’d seen Toni come to grips with the past and let it go, in favour of a future. He’d seen two of his favourite people become thick as thieves, and with the help of Nat, realized that they had done it because of him.
“Goodnight, sweet pea. I love you more,” Toni murmured, and uncaring of the audience, began to sing softly.
An argument for another day, he decided, as Peter clambered up on to the bed and gently shook Toni ‘awake’. As he’d suspected she might, the genius made a great show of pretending to be completely surprised, winking surreptitiously at him when the enthusiastic four year old threw himself at her for a hug. He sent her a responding smile, feeling love unlike anything he’d ever known spreading through his entire being for the amazing woman who had agreed to be his. There was no one in this world like Toni Stark, Steve knew that, and for all the ups and downs they had, God help him, he loved her. More than breath.
“What else can I do, huh?” he demanded, the Brooklyn accent getting a little thicker in his ire. “I’m just one guy! I’m just an experiment!”
Steve nosed his way along her jaw and pressed his lips to the spot behind her ear. It felt like an apology. “I was scared of hurting you,” he murmured back, by way of an explanation. “I didn’t know whether I would, by mistake, whether I could trust myself not to.”
It was like every dream he’d ever had, coming true all at the same time. His veins turned to liquid fire and desire went from a low simmer in his belly; like it always was around Tony; to a blaze that raged all the way up his chest. His arms went around Tony’s waist, yanking him so close against Steve that he could feel every inch of their bodies pressed together, and he swallowed every little gasp and hitching sound that fell from the other man’s lips.
Impassioned speech taking a backseat in light of the (amazing, fantastic, wonderful) development, Steve croaked unsteadily. “You’re not?”
The truth in that statement extinguished the worst of Steve’s panicky rage. There was no guarantee that he would have been able to unearth himself from the spot so that they wouldn’t have to keep digging, and the odds were good that he would have hurt himself in the process, which would have stopped him from the rest of the efforts to save Toni. Not to mention that his girlfriend definitely would have had all their asses if Steve had pulled a stunt like that and she’d gotten wind. Toni hid hers a lot better than he did, but she was equally as protective of him as he was of her. He knew that for a fact; he’d seen it up close and personal, after all…
Even when she’d hated him – or, well, she’d thought she’d hated him – she’d still been thinking about him. In the little cushion of time between the battle of New York and when Steve had shown up at the Tower with a duffel and a look that was equally lost and hopeful, Toni had spent an inordinate amount of time alternately worrying about what the super soldier was doing and how he was handling the shock transition into this century’s tech-filled travels, and muttering under her breath, mostly to her bots, about how stupid, self-righteous Captain America could shove his stupid, self-righteous shield up his stupid, self-righteous ass if he looked at her one more time like he was measuring her and coming up short.
“Fuck, baby, you’re this wet for me?” he asked in a rough growl. “You like feeling me here?” Demonstratively, he brushed his thumb across the sensitive bundle of nerves that he knew would wring the most pleasure from her, rewarded by a wrecked whimper and breathless string of
Toni laughed thickly even as another wave of emotion flooded through her. She was grateful for the clouds that covered the vast majority of the night sky, because she was pretty sure that the starlight would have made the tear that fell down her cheek glisten ostentatiously. As it were, Nat was the only one that felt it soak into her shoulder, and her only response was to hold on to Toni tighter, a wordless commiseration of the fluctuating feelings that came from a close call like this one.
Returning his attention to his grinning friend, Steve put his book down, marking the page with his thumb. “If I’m smiling, then it’s almost always because I’m thinking about Toni,” he admitted brazenly, smirking slightly at the put-upon gagging that his best friend was doing.
Some deeply rooted instinct in Steve told him that there was something more to the question; something underlying; something that would either send him down the path of no return or steer them back to safe and familiar territory. The former option would open him up to the risk and uncertainty of unchartered waters, but the latter… the latter would close the door on something that he could no longer deny he wanted, with every fiber of his being.
Steve,” she said plaintively, leaning forward to press a persuasive kiss to Steve’s collarbone. In so doing, she rocked furtively against him again. Bit back a smirk at the full-body shudder it caused. “No holding back. I’m yours. You’ve got everything I am,” she reminded him as she drew back, moving her arms to drape loosely around his shoulders. “Don’t take yourself away from me.”
“Miss Toni?” Maico ventured softly just before she could issue the command to close up the armor. She hummed slightly in an invitation for him to continue, and felt her heart melt when he told her shyly, “I don’t think your name means ‘one who talks a lot’. I think it means ‘real good as a mama’.”
The little boy looked like he committing the name to memory, intelligent eyes thoughtful as he gazed upon her. “Mama says she loves me all the way down to her toes. Do you love your son like that?”
“Toni, let’s be reasonable here,” Steve coaxed, and pinned her with those lethally big blue eyes; an expression he damn well knew was a weakness of hers. “What if something happens on the flight home and I don’t know how to help?”
He wondered what it said about him, that the voice of reason in his head sounded like his lover and so was pretty much the only one he would listen to, but Steve didn’t care either way. His consciousness/inner Toni voice was right and he would have regretted a blow up like that, especially knowing how everyone in their family loved Toni. Because he had to, Steve took a few minutes to calm himself down and clear his head.
For a few moments, Barnes didn’t speak, but Tony didn’t blame him. Must have been difficult for the man to realize that he just might not be the most dangerous man in the room, anymore. It had been the same for Tony when Rumlow had started blathering on about Steve’s business.
Dimly, he registered Bruce slipping earphones on; he didn’t begrudge the man the motion, and could admit that it was probably for the better, lest they have a Code Green in mid-air. For their parts, the rest of the Avengers gathered closer, instinctively on guard despite the fact that the threat was nowhere near them.
A high-pitched whine that was quickly becoming familiar reached his ears a split second before a potent blast of heat took out the remaining four guards at once, before they could reach for their guns and fire at him all together.
She loved their surrogate family for staying immobile as she and Steve made their way slowly forward; for sensing, correctly, that she needed a moment with her son, a moment she only wanted shared by Steve.
Dread hit Steve all over again as he was reminded of the cost she paid every time she donned that suit.
She tapped to answer and had to wait a few seconds for her AI to scramble the signal, before she was treated to the sight of Steve’s smiling face. “Hey, hot stuff.”
And he would win, too. Steve remembered Toni telling him once, during one of their many shared nights in her workshop, that she was coding his biometric and voice signatures to have access to everything in the tower and to all her tech. He recalled it so distinctly because it had been the first real, implicit show of trust in him on her part, and he also recalled promising her and himself that he would never take any sort of liberties or advantage of the privilege. As it were, he had hardly ever used the access to her tech, but if ever there was an extenuating circumstance…
Against all reason, he didn’t feel any of the hesitation he’d anticipated feeling. Instead, Steve was drawn almost magnetically to where Tony was, standing alongside him close enough to let their arms brush.
Rogers, on the other hand… well, he’d had faith. Jim had seen the way the man’s face had lit up with optimism and hope and damn if he didn’t actually feel bad for the Captain when the suit had revealed no Toni in sight.
Cutting off without saying goodbye – because that word suddenly held much deeper, scarier connotations – the genius began to do what she did best.
…” Stark whispered, the word punched out from her gut as she scrambled to the scientist. Seeing that she was up and moving made relief crush Steve’s chest like a rockslide, but it turned smothering when he realized that there was a distinct bullet hole right over Erskine’s heart. “C’mon, Abraham, don’t you do this, not now, don’t do this to me,” Toni was muttering, seemingly without even knowing it.
“No,” the voice snapped, losing its taunting edge for a moment as he got flustered. “I meant The Captain. He should say hello to you.”
“My magic is more suited to trickery and mischief,” Loki muttered, clearly disgruntled. “Locating her is beyond my abilities; not that Odin would consent to it, anyway. Have you asked Heimdall for his assistance?”
If she was infallible, there was less of a chance that people would try to take advantage of her. They took a lot more shots, of course; there was some deeply rooted instinct in people that seemed to take a thrill out of trying to take down anything that didn’t seem possible to destroy; but people rarely tried to take her for a ride, which had proven invaluable when she’d first stepped up and taken over SI.
“Go for ice-cream,” the blond declared, standing up. Speaking the idea only strengthened his belief that it was a great one. “Let’s go for ice-cream. Chocolate ice-cream. With sprinkles.”
Sighing inwardly, Steve slipped back into parade rest. Until he touched down in Argentina, there was nothing else he could do except count.
He looked relieved at the answer, gifting her with another sweet smile as she got back to work on the helmet. “Miss Toni?”
An irate Black Widow striding towards Toni the minute she got off the Quinjet, was not an auspicious start to arriving home.
“Forgot about that,” she muttered unenthusiastically, lifting the blouse without compunction and baring her midriff. Steve might have bothered to blush, or get chivalrous and turn around, if not for the mess of blood that was still sluggishly dripping from the wound; what looked to be a nasty bullet graze.
“I can’t handle sending you out there knowing that I haven’t given you everything at my disposal to keep you safe,” she replied softly, and damn if that voice, her words, the way she was showing him her heart without qualm, didn’t burn Steve’s heart with so much love he thought he would combust.
Even so, while it was being offered, Bucky couldn’t help reaching out for it. Reveling in it and taking comfort from it. For the longest time, he’d waited for the other shoe to drop, so to speak, since it had been a while since he’d been able to trust in something solid. But he could remember with crystal clear clarity the day that the last of his uncertainty and reservations had been broken down by the genius herself…
“I guess it makes sense.” Rhodes’ voice interrupted his thoughts. “Toni doesn’t usually cop to the things she does that can be remotely construed as caring.” Then, as an afterthought, the military man slanted him a glance and added, “I still don’t like you, though.”
Emotion stole Toni’s words. She knew, intuitively, that this gift wasn’t one that she could refuse or return; there was meaning behind it, an unassailable intent that was unspoken but understood, from one mother to another.
With a huff that Steve was sure was part frustration, part affection, Toni snapped out Barton’s name and hurried off after him, presumably to try to stop him from killing Howard. The super soldier thought about helping; Clint or Toni, he couldn’t say with any degree of certainty, because honestly, if he saw Howard again, he wasn’t sure what he would do; but instead, he stayed where he was. Steve was a possessive and protective boyfriend at the best of times, but facing Howard with the knowledge that he had hurt Toni? Had dared to put his hands on what Steve considered to be his? There would have been very little, if anything, that would have stopped him from killing the elder Stark, and he doubted that Coulson would have appreciated the paperwork.
This one was a little delayed, because Bucky muse was being a little jerk, but here it is! So sorry for the wait, lovelies, and also sorry for the (probably) horrific translations I used in this chap! Blame Google translate for whatever mistakes may have been made, please XD
The plan to thank Toni had to wait a little longer, because at around about the same time that Bucky called out, “Let’s hear it for Captain America and… uh… Iron Man!” Steve realized that the genius, along with the suit and its pilot, was nowhere to be seen.
“Close your eyes, Rogers,” Toni instructed him softly when his gaze shot up to hers. She edged her palm a little closer to his eyes, making him close them automatically, and rested her fingers lightly over his eyelids as Erskine began to count down. His hand, a little warmer, cupped Steve’s shoulder, and he focused on the twin touches as serum suddenly flooded his body. Toni muttered something, fingers smoothing at the top of his jaw when he clenched his teeth against the pain, and he only realized how much he was clinging on to the comforting feel of her hand against his face when she took it away.
She’d never been very good at saying no to Peter, or to kids in general her entire life, because she couldn’t stand to disappoint them. She knew all too well what it felt like to be disappointed, had known the feeling since she was far too young to even properly comprehend it, and she’d never been keen on letting other kids feel that before they absolutely had to.
get caught up in trying to keep them from offering her as a sacrificial lamb to enemy camps, just so that they can get some work done without her trying to undo it all.”
A blatant lie, it had to be said. It was a well-known fact among the Avengers that, despite their near-constant battle of wits, pranks and general ribbing of each other, there existed a very unique and specific bond between Toni and Clint that defied all reason but prevailed against all odds. When it came down to it, they were both rather enormously protective of each other, and Toni wasn’t sure just why it was that way for Clint, but she knew exactly what had triggered that bond for her. Of the entire team, it had been Clint who’d been the first person to make her feel like she was part of something bigger; that the Avengers were a family, their family. In the same way, he’d been the first person to make her appreciate the notion behind coming home…
After giving them their orders, he set off to find his best friend, daring to fuel the hope he’d sustained that Bucky had survived the capture and apparent torture. Tangling with a group of guards, Steve relied on adrenaline and willpower to fight his way through, but as it turned out, he had a bit more than that.
Toni sighed a little and twisted her hands, still in his grip. Steve took the motion for what it was, releasing her, but he was happy when she didn’t get up and turn away from him; only shifted back so that she was comfortably seated in his lap again, rather than being pressed up against him.
– Steve began to plead. “JARVIS, I was a complete moron, I wasn’t thinking… I didn’t know. Please, tell me where she is, I need to apologize. I need to make sure she’s okay.”
still feel that. “How could you have known?” she asked reasonably; or, her closest attempt at it. She still felt somewhat like she’d been scraped raw from the inside out, and was trying to clumsily find her feet with reality again.
Steve rose to his knees and brushed his fingers along the inside of her thigh. “Think you’re ready for me, baby?” he asked, even as he shucked off his sweats and boxers. Toni grazed her teeth over her bottom lip automatically, fighting against the needy sounds that were building up in her throat. “None of that,” Steve demanded when he glanced up and caught the movement. Pointedly, he thumbed her bottom lip until she released it. “I want to hear you, sweetheart. Every. Single. Sound.”
Before Rhodes could offer anything else by way of comfort, Steve stepped in. “You got it, sweetheart,” he murmured in response to her small plea to get her out. “And we got you, okay?” Then, softer, “I got you, doll.”
Bruce had never thought that he would ever reach a point in his life where he saw the Hulk as anything more than shameful evidence of his failure.
He answered her without detaching himself from the death grip he had her in, and it was so muffled that she had to ask him to repeat it. “Maico.”
As predicted, Steve’s arrival was heralded with the slamming of their door, but where it was normally Tony’s place to silently bait his lover until the former soldier snapped and yelled, this time, it was the brunet who was bubbling with palpable rage. Even though he knew it would only rile Steve up further, Tony preceded his words by thrusting the folder unceremoniously against the other man’s chest.
Adopting a mock innocent expression, Tony asked, “Aren’t you the man with the plan, though? Star-spangled and all? I think I’ve even got the tapes somewhere around here to prove it…”
A soft sound of distress left Laura’s mouth, enough that Clint knew the visual was scaring her in the same way it was scaring all of them there at the Tower. She’d gotten closer to Toni, slowly but surely, and the two woman had become close friends, similar to how Laura had befriended Nat. Though his wife was removed from the action, so to speak, it didn’t stop her from worrying about them; case in point.
For those of you who were looking forward to some Clint and Nat in this chapter, I do sincerely apologize, but I promise they will have some generous word-space in the next chapter! I've already got it mapped out, so stay tuned for it!
“I missed you.” The words escaped Toni without her permission, and she hid her face in Steve’s shoulder when she felt him pause his ministrations. Vulnerability would never be something that came easily to her. “It felt like I didn’t have all of you.”
Toni knew better than to think Steve didn’t care about Maico; no, her boyfriend was simply trusting her to handle her priority while letting her know what was his; but the words lit a whole other kind of heat in her chest. She never tired of hearing Steve refer to Peter as theirs; never tired of reminders of the family that they’d somehow patchworked together. It fueled a resolve in her that she’d always had, making it more potent now, and no matter what it took, Toni was going to see herself out of this along with Maico. She was going to get back to her family and get Maico back to his.
“Who did?” he asked, all too happy to keep Toni tucked against his chest. It felt like a piece of himself being returned after having been ripped out the day before; and he never wanted to feel the fear of losing it ever again.
Glancing uneasily at each other, and then at the unmoving corpse of Slime Man, the goons made the executive decision to put their guns on the ground.
, and took out the entire vehicle I was in. I was the only survivor. All those soldiers… they died because of me.” Whether she knew it or not, tears were slipping from pain-filled brown orbs, and Steve couldn’t stand to be silent a moment longer. Not now that he knew she was blaming herself for that.
Before he could offer any response, Loki was gone again, and Thor was alone on the rooftop with no chance of Toni Stark sneaking up behind him and granting him the comfort that he so deeply wished for.
She didn’t realize she’d begun to tremble slightly, until Bucky spoke. “Do you want me to get Steve?” he asked softly, so gently that it made irrational emotion surge in her chest.
It was the truest words she could have spoken, because both of them would have heard the falsehood in it, if she’d apologized for her actions. A little boy’s life had been spared with her intervention, and there was no way Toni would trivialize that by even feigning remorse. What she was apologetic for, was the fear she’d caused her family.
By the time she awoke the next morning, Clint and Nat draped over her legs, Bruce on Peter’s other side with his hand resting innocuously on her forearm, Bucky sprawled over Steve with his head resting against Toni’s hip, and Thor along the foot of the bed with her feet tucked underneath his stomach…
He followed the same procedure, miraculously keeping his tears from falling, and when he turned around, his efforts were aided by the blood droplet he spotted on the floor.
He nestled as close to her as he had before, and on the bright side, it took the pressure off her injured arm. “Hey, honey.” She cuddled him gently, pressing her lips to the top of his head. “Are you okay? Did the suit protect you while you came back up?”
She’d changed his life irrevocably that night, and though he hadn’t known it at the time, Rhodes was profusely grateful to whatever deity had given him the chance to be there, to save her and then be saved by her in a much more profound way later on. Not for nothing, she was one of the most important people in his life and he wouldn’t have it any other way.
Her lifeline approached her in human form. “Brucie bear!” she fairly beamed at her fellow scientist, and the brunet stopped warily in his tracks a few paces away from her. “Bruce will be there the entire time, he can handle anything that might happen,” she stated confidently, unrepentant even when Steve aimed a glare at the hapless scientist.
The worst part about being trapped underneath a goddamn building wasn’t the multitude of injuries she’d sustained in the wreckage, nor the inability to dig herself out, or even the dreary lack of light.
Not to mention, she’d had a sick feeling in her gut since yesterday, when the team had departed for the mission, and it was a small comfort to know that she could get to them even a fraction faster with the new armour.
He could sigh and grumble at them all he wanted, but Coulson had never failed to have their backs, and through all their ups and downs, he was the only person with SHIELD that Toni trusted, outside of Nat and Clint.
With a courage he didn’t normally possess – certainly, he couldn’t talk this openly to any other dames – Steve mused aloud, “It isn’t the worst thing… feeling. Even the bad things. It proves that things were once good. That we loved.” When he realized that Toni’s unyielding, intense orbs, almost amber in color now, were trained on him, he turned a little sheepish. “That’s what my Ma used to tell me, anyway.”
Her breathing hitched as Steve’s hand untangled from hers to skim down her body, until his thumb was teasing the waistband of her lacy panties. He changed direction suddenly, cupping the inside of her knee and lifting just high enough to slip his leg in between hers. Pleasure burst inside of her as his thigh pressed against her core and Toni rocked shamelessly against him as the thin lace began to soak up her arousal. A whine slipped from her lips when Steve met her rocking hips with his. Slid his hand up underneath her t-shirt to cup her breast.
Even as she spoke, Toni was shaking her head, trying awkwardly to use her free hand to pat Mrs. Navarro’s shoulder consolingly.
“We have to go in,” Steve grumbled when Fury eventually hung up. He didn’t lift his head, so she didn’t stop petting his hair. “Apparently there’s something we both need to see.”
Finally, it was Bucky who shifted their light conversation to something deeper. “You scared the fuck out of us, you know?” he said without preamble. A wry smile twisted Toni’s lips – it was just like Bucky to strike right to the heart of the matter without any warning at all – but she heard the residual pain in his voice clearly enough not to make light of the words.
Tony’s eyes were wide and a little glazed, and Steve wasn’t entirely sure that either of them was breathing anymore, but after a long moment suspended in time, the brunet exhaled shakily.
Without needing verbal agreement, they set off in opposite directions, and true to his word, Steve’s path was clear getting to the rooms where Bucky was apparently being kept. Fury and sorrow in equal measure assaulted him when he found his best friend, strapped to a bed and half out of his mind from the torture, but it was replaced with knee-weakening relief when Barnes recognized him.
And then there was the simple distinction of being family; something that never threatened to awe Toni like the first time she’d created something out of virtually nothing.
She was alive and she was there and she was doggedly hanging on by her last reserves because she had fought to come back to him, to their family. Steve knew right then that he couldn’t have possibly asked for anything more.
In times like this, it became all too clear just how much Peter remembered about the loss of his family. Although he’d come such a far way in recovering from that horrific experience, and although he had been young enough not to understand most of it, there was still the irrevocable end result; loss. A baby or not, Peter had always been aware that he’d lost something that day. To have latched onto Toni as he did, and to lose that again, could cause such damage to an already fragile heart, and obviously, Peter had cottoned on to the real possibility of it in the past two days.
Her repulsors took care of the door to the pathetic excuse for a bunker; JARVIS had already located the only one that she was concerned about protecting, and she was secure in the knowledge that he was ensconced safely in a room on the lowermost level of the supposedly secured place. His captors – the ones that would die the slowest – were cowering in a room of steel, barred and barricaded as if any of it would stop her.
“I’m right here, honey, I promise,” she told him, and slipped away from him just long enough for the armor to close up around him. His resulting scream broke her heart, but at least he was safe. Without needing a prompt, because JARVIS was amazing like that, the suit immediately shifted to cover her as much as possible from the falling debris. When she was curled underneath it as much as she was able, she thumped a fist softly against the torso of the suit. Maico stopped screaming at the sound and Toni grabbed the opportunity to get a word in edgewise. “See? I’m right here, Maico, I didn’t leave. I’m here, sweetie, everything’s going to be okay.”
Steve grinned, feeling a rush of warmth and ease that he never would have thought he’d feel around a dame, leave alone Toni Stark. This newfound friendship of theirs was definitely preferable to arguing like cats and dogs, though some part of the super soldier was relatively certain that some of the arguing was bound to still happen.
Without much conscious thought, he found himself speaking. “So beautiful, sweetheart… you look so beautiful like that, on your knees for me, wrapped around my cock. You’re so good for me, baby, can’t believe you’re doing this for me. My perfect babydoll.”
For as long as he could, he held out against the scream building in his throat, for some reason thinking of the tension in Stark’s voice when she’d been trying to soothe him through the serum injection. Perhaps she was holding out the hope that it would be a relatively painless procedure, and oddly, he wanted to spare her the blatant disproving of the theory. When he couldn’t hold it back anymore, the sound scraped at his throat until it was tender, and yet for all that he was the one screaming, he could still hear Toni’s yells through it.
After a long moment, Bucky pulled back. “Iron Man, if you ever take off that fuckin’ headgear, I swear to God I’m gonna kiss ya.”
Toni nodded, albeit reluctantly. “I’m pretty sure you promised me 36 hours,” she reminded him with a smirk, trying not to lament what could have been. And she didn’t just mean the I-missed-you-so-much-sex. Transferring her hand to his face without taking her forehead off his, the genius caressed Steve’s cheek. “This might not mean much,” she prefaced with a faint note of warning in her whispered voice, “but there wasn’t a single second that I didn’t think you would find me.”
“Always am,” Jim parroted back, and a soft kiss landed atop her head. After a moment of silence, Rhodes hesitantly spoke. “Say the word, baby girl.”
She didn’t know what she was apologizing for, but God knew that Maria Stark could certainly take her pick. Toni had put her mother through more than her fair share, growing up. Even now, without meaning to, she was probably hurting her mother; Howard had been sent back not long after their fight yesterday. Coulson had come around, visibly fuming, and had extracted the spitting mad elder Stark himself, frog marching him out of Stark Tower like he was a misbehaving toddler. After that, the agent had lit a fire underneath the guys who were investigating the time warp that HYDRA had opened, and before she’d even put Peter to bed, Toni had gotten the call that Howard had been returned to the past, sporting only a few more new bruises, courtesy of Clint and presumably Coulson himself.
“In that case,” Bucky grinned charmingly, and how he could pull it off after walking umpteen miles straight after being tortured, Steve didn’t know. “You have my gratitude, ma’am.” He tipped an imaginary hat at Peggy, who only smiled indulgently.
“Would you say something, please?” he asked irritably. “I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall, here.”
And it was that thought; that isolated image in Steve’s mind of Toni being approached by suitors of all sorts who wanted to court her, probably without even appreciating how amazing she was, probably just so that they could have a piece of her, a slice of heaven that they didn’t deserve; that finally obliterated any rational part of his brain that favored logic. All that was left was the primal part of himself that Steve had been steadfastly ignoring for weeks.
“You’re a pain in my ass,” Steve replied, but he was chuckling as he spoke, a fond expression leveled at the smirking genius. “Just grab a jacket and let’s get a move on, huh?”
“Peter,” she nodded, taking a steadying breath. Toni dropped her head against his shoulder for half a second. “He’s downstairs. I’ve got him. I’ll get him.”
Bruce appeared in her line of sight, wordlessly tapping a shock blanket before laying it out on one of the beds in the medical area. He knew better than to try and make his presence known; not while Peter was still so on edge and Toni was not much calmer.
Toni rasped, and the fact that she wasn’t snarky something witty; the fact that her voice was dull and anguished instead of light and careless; told Steve that something had gone wrong. Terribly wrong.
Speaking of whom. “Steve mentioned your little household AI,” he commented, and now, Howard sounded like the same disapproving, disappointed man she’d known as a child. “If it was a failure as an experiment, why flaunt it in your home?”
Stark Senior’s tone was confident, bordering on careless, but for as different as they were, Howard and Toni shared a few similar traits and mannerisms. One of them, was the way their voices got a little fluttery and fast whenever they were hiding fear or worry, and Steve’s trained ears picked the tell up easily from his lover’s father. It was the only reason why he didn’t snap at the man and let him know exactly what he thought of the Stark patriarch’s parenting skills, if he was proud about that.
were a private security consultant,” he shot back evenly, still a little stung at the lie that Steve had been telling him for over five years.
from him. This was the only opportunity he was going to get to do something and Tony knew it. There was no way to guarantee that there was nobody behind him, stationed as a guard for the room, but Tony hoped that their continual underestimation of him meant that they were leaving him alone for the time being. Because who would think that the poor, defenseless inventor would try anything after being stomped into the ground?
Rolling her hips back against him, she relished the sound of his harsh groan. “I need you.” Dragging her eyes open (when had she closed them?) Toni repeated the motion and watched as Steve’s eyes turned an even darker shade of cobalt. “I always need you. Anything. Everything. Just you.”
Like, for example, last Thursday, when he’d been working on the prototype of a watch that was meant to be part of a new line of combat gear he was developing. The watch itself was designed to be virtually indestructible, connected to the comm unit of the rest of the battalion, containing a tracker which was also virtually indestructible and activated based on the whether or not a soldier’s heart rate ratcheted up above the threshold that Tony had determined as the baseline for pain, and perhaps most notably, was embedded with nanotechnology that could be enacted to cover the wearer’s arm with flipping panels made from a gold-titanium alloy. Instant impenetrable arm shield in case of a sudden attack.
There were only a few words exchanged by Bucky and Natasha, all of which Steve blocked out as not being remotely important right then, and after a brief pause, Peter came on the line.
“I’m not with Ryan,” he said, somewhat weakly, as if it were the only words he could manage. Steve blinked in confusion, both at the words themselves, and its apparent meaning. Without prompting, Tony elaborated. “Coleman and I aren’t dating.”
A jaw-cracking yawn made Toni finally stop her work for longer than half a minute, straightening and stretching and relishing the series of pops her spine made as it cracked back into place. She’d been in the workshop since 2am, having only surfaced once that morning in order to greet her boyfriend and Peter, who’d brought her a breakfast bagel. Glancing at her watch, the genius cringed when she realized it was well after 4pm.
put some idiotic protocol in place that basically tells me to fuck right off and let you die, then you and I will have nothing left to say to one another.” His voice broke multiple times as he spoke, composure cracking now that they were safe and at home and
It worked to an extent; Steve sent her a wry little smile that that seemed to say her efforts were noted and appreciated. “Neither,” he answered as he took a few steps towards the barricade that had been put up between them and the crowds and media circus. “I’m gonna give them the “Steve Rogers Is Gonna Swing Back If Anyone Swings At His Girl Again” threat. It’s a little more graphic than the usual,” he added, a hint of cheekiness in the smirk her threw back at her.
It had taken the better part of a month before Jim had felt comfortable letting her out of his sight, again.
“Deterrent?” he asked, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees as he realized what she was saying. “You’re talking about... using the suit to end wars before they even begin?”
Reaching up to take Uncle Loki’s hand with his, Peter began to drag him to the window seat. It was big and comfy, usually used for bedtime stories with one or both of his parents, or a lullaby with Mommy before bed, and a couple times, Mommy had shown him the stars from there. Most importantly, it was the only place that would work for his plan.
Okay, so I took a bit of a different turn in this one, including some Bucky POV, so please let me know if it works! If it does, then I'll try writing in some other Avengers' perspectives :D  Gotta have equal amounts of fluff to combat angst, right?! :D
“…assume that they will kill him once the three hours are up,” Rumlow was saying, and once again, he was a nanosecond too late in disguising the smugness that filled his eyes at the thought. Tony’s stomach turned and he fought against the sudden violent urge to slam his fist into the lawyer’s face. Taking a cleansing breath, he made himself listen to the rest of what the man was saying. “Though in a situation not of his doing, the Captain still instructed our firm, in the event of
Tony moaned around him and the vibrations made Steve growl involuntarily and rock deeper into the inventor’s mouth. He was careful this time, so Tony stayed around him, and with another few deep breaths and a dose of persistence, the other man’s mouth was finally stretched taut around Steve’s cock. Tony kept his mouth there, entrapping his whole dick in that wet, warm, perfect cavern, just for a few seconds, before pulling away and settling into another rhythm, suckling the sensitive head of Steve’s cock while stroking what wasn’t in his mouth with his hands. There was a delicious contrast between the slight callouses of Tony’s hands and the perfectly smooth, warm suction of his mouth, and it wasn’t much longer until Steve exploded too.
But for all the bad feelings, there was also understanding there. It didn’t surprise her because out of everyone, herself included, it always seemed like Steve was the one person who had the deepest understanding of Toni’s relationship with Peter. At times when she didn’t even understand it herself, Steve somehow did. He had yet to be surprised by the level of love and devotion that Toni had shown towards being a mother, even when people like Rhodey and Pepper and Happy still expressed some level of reservation. Even when Toni
Having lived through a war, and then the sort of battles that made war look like child’s play, it was a safe assumption to make that Steve have seen a lot of thing in his lifetime. He’d seen strife and suffering. He’d seen loss. He’d seen light, the lightest, and he’d also seen dark. So much dark. Part of what made him the immovable, reliable, steady Captain America, was his ability to see all those things and still find it in himself to stiffen his spine and keep going. It got under his skin, of course, but he never let it show. That was the burden that came with being a hero; a leader; an icon of bravery and a symbol of hope.
They spent the next few minutes playfully roughhousing, Steve doing everything he could to evoke laughter from his girlfriend, and Toni doing everything she could to fend Steve off. As it somehow always did, it ended with them locked in a long kiss, and forcing himself to remember that they weren’t at home, Steve reluctantly broke away.
Without thinking, Steve stiffened as Bucky approached him. His best friend had been the first to firmly declare his intention to accompany Steve to Argentina; his exact words, Steve vaguely recalled, were
“I’m okay,” she murmured reassuringly, after taking a few deep breaths. The terrifying black lines of palladium which had been creeping up her neck earlier, a sick parody of a tattoo, had receded some, her eyes were clear, and she was lucid, and Steve would take what he could get until they got back to base and she could rest and allow the lithium dioxide to work properly.
In eight years, this was the first time Tony was breaking his vow. But it was okay, it had to be okay, because this was for Steve and Tony wasn’t going to let anything happen to him. Not while he could prevent it.
“Yeah,” he answered for them, clearing his throat and stubbornly pushing away the little flare of unfamiliar heat in his chest that tasted a bit like disgruntlement. He didn’t care if Toni and Bucky were friends, or more than that. He had no reason to care about something so stupid. It probably wouldn’t even last very long, anyway. “We kind of owe her and Peggy for the rescue.”
Part of Clint settled at the way his wife very pointedly didn’t ask what the rest of the Avengers were asking; whether or not Toni was still alive. “There’s a plan,” he answered heavily, dragging a palm over his eyes. “Thor, Nat and I are holding down the fort and keeping an eye on the kid, so I’m not too sure what’s going on over there. Our latest update was a couple hours ago. Bruce just said that she was trying to climb while they dug a little.”
With slow, deliberate movements, Steve lifted his body to hover over Tony’s. The brunet sighed in contentment at the heat radiating off his lover, but pouted when the blond refused to blanket him like he usually did. Stupid ribs, stupid bruising, stupid everything. Tony knew for a fact that it would dissuade Steve from hot, life-affirming sex, and for that alone, Tony wished he could shoot Slime Man again.
“It isn’t all it’s cracked up to be,” Toni replied, pursing her lips as she regarded her half-empty glass, and the fact that she wasn’t mocking him made Steve smile a little. “Although sometimes, dulled senses are a damned blessing.”
When he felt like Bucky was done, or as close to it as Steve was going to get, he heedlessly continued his story. “He was talking to Rhodes, I think, remember him?” Bucky only grunted resignedly in response, and Steve took it as acknowledgement. “Anyway, he was telling Rhodes that he… well, that he was over me.” Now, his voice took on a tone that was plainly confused, because Steve could honestly say that he was just that. “I don’t… I mean, when was he under me?” the blond asked bewilderedly, brow knitting together as he thought it through for what felt like the thousandth time.
So, yes. She had forgiven him and Toni could no longer be hurt by what had happened two years ago. They’d grown since then, as a couple and as a family, and just because his mind was intent on pointing out all the times that he’d been less than what she deserved, didn’t mean that Toni didn’t know how much he loved her.
It didn’t really lend authority to the anger he was hoping to still hold on to during this conversation, but it did serve to melt his lover’s eyes back to their usual soft blue. “Do you understand me, Steve?” he demanded, realizing belatedly that there was something hot and moist tracking down his cheeks. “If you ever do that to me again, if you ever put yourself in that situation and… if you… and expect me… I swear to God, Steve…”
Pressing his thigh against the bulge in the front of Tony’s pants, Steve found some relief of his own as his aching cock pressed against Tony’s hip. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for right then. “Want you, Tony,” he confessed mindlessly, his voice rough and deep. “Can I touch you, sweetheart? Will you let me? Please let me, doll.” As if to supplement his plea, Steve mouthed a trail from the spot behind Tony’s ear, across his jaw and then down his throat, ending by tracing the hollow at the bottom of the other man’s throat with his tongue.
The sound of the nickname had lifted her lips slightly, but it was Barnes’ second comment that elicited the first proper smile on Toni’s face. “I leave him with you for a week, Snowflake, and this is what I come back to?” she asked with her best put-upon tone, able to vividly picture the look of dual affection and exasperation that would come over Bucky’s face that Toni’s own nickname for him.
In his defense, Steve hadn’t known, hadn’t even had an inkling of knowing, that Tony had been right outside the goddamn door.
Toni glared stonily at the EMT, defiance radiating off her from the clench of her fists at her side to the stubborn set of her jaw. “What part of ‘No’ didn’t you understand, you overgrown…”
“It’s great,” he nodded, trying to muster up his usual level of conviction and failing dismally. “Yeah, it’s a good thing. We can just keep goin’ as we were.”
With the same lack of consideration Peggy had shown, Bucky strolled into the tent. “Honey, I’m home,” he called out jokingly, making Steve shoot him a disapproving look. Both men were distracted, however, by Toni freezing in place, having just pulled her shirt on. It wasn’t the closeness of nearly catching her without it that had them all stuck in place, but instead the array of colorful bruises all up and down her exposed arms and, if Steve had seen it right, along her back, too.
Toni kept speaking; an absent-minded rundown on the progress of her meeting before everything had gone to hell in a handbasket around them; until Steve slipped fully into sleep. As much as he wanted to, and had been taking care of her, Toni felt it equally imperative that she look out for him, and supersoldier or not, Steve didn’t function well, going on 36 hours with no sleep.
Taking charge once again, Steve assessed injuries and was pleased to note that the casualties were minimal. “Bucky and I will take the lead. Hey, Shellhead, you mind taking up the rear to keep a lookout for us?” Steve directed the soldier, more of a veiled order than a question.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” he snapped, sounding harsh even to his own ears, but surprisingly, Stark didn’t take the bait. Instead, she simply raised an eyebrow at him, staring at him unimpressed until he huffed in frustration and bit out a completely insincere apology.
It made her particularly protective of the genius, it had to be said. Toni was the only sister she’d ever had; even Laura and Pepper had never broke the final barrier on that one. It wasn’t an easy course to follow in life, loving Toni Stark, because although it was worth it (so very, very worth it) it was a path that came with a lot of pain and fear. Quite simply, because Toni was a hero. She was a hero in every sense of the word. She protected and defended and stood for the entire world every single day, even if it meant putting herself in the line of fire. Too often, it meant just that, and for Natasha; and the rest of the Avengers; it meant constantly wondering whether they would have to give her up for the good of the rest of the world.
Not giving him a chance to get back in his head, she engaged him once more. “Well, I think we could use some of that. I’m Toni, by the way. I think my name means ‘one who talks a lot’.” Her attempt at a joke elicited a wider smile and even got the kid to loosen his grip on her a little. Small successes. “How old are you, Maico?”
Blue holograms filled the air around him, but even the comforting familiarity of his own space couldn’t negate the sickening feeling in his gut for what he was working on.
For all the wordless communication that could pass between them, Toni also heard one more thing. “You have to go, don’t you?”
to reveal a look of cool implacability. To anyone else, he might have looked cold and uncaring, but to someone who knew Tony as well as Steve did? Well, it was easy to see the tension that thinned his mouth. The way a muscle in his cheek jumped from how stiffly he was clenching his jaw. The combination of anger and apprehension that darkened whiskey-coloured eyes into a dark, murky brown.
Steve would have liked to pretend to be the bigger man – pun completely intended – and offer some kind of comfort to his best friend, but after all those years being dragged around by Bucky, who always had the eye of every dame in a ten-foot radius? “Don’t take it so hard,” he smirked, patting the other man’s shoulder patronizingly. “Maybe she’s got a friend.”
Those notions, and that childish hope, had been obliterated with the missile, sold under the table from SI itself, that was fired at the car he and his mother were occupying on the way to an army base to meet with his father. Along with that, they had also been struck with an even harder blow; the death of Maria Stark.
Steve winced slightly, knowing how much the title set Toni’s teeth on edge with her perceived inability to bear it, but to his surprise, his lover only sighed, almost inaudibly, and got to her feet with a softly returned, “Sweet dreams, honey.”
Trusting her gut had saved her life, and the lives of her family, more than once. It felt wrong to dismiss it now, but she’d had little else in the way of choices.
If she hadn’t realized it before, then that image would have been a glaringly obvious sign that she’d really put her family through the mill this time. Toni couldn’t help feeling guilt, like lashes across her back, even as she knew that she couldn’t in good conscience regret her actions.
Part of her couldn’t help the gratitude, though. Steve was the best thing that had ever happened to her, until Peter, and he was still the dream come true that she could have never anticipated she would find, let alone deserve. The thought of them still pining after each other was unimaginable, especially not when she could attribute most of her fondest memories of the past few years to her super soldier.
Steve lifted his head, and like a dance that Toni knew all the moves to, she was shifting around to meet his questing lips. Contrary to his indolent assault on her neck, he kissed her now with fervor and purpose and urgency. When he deepened the kiss, it was a demand, and the way he plundered her mouth left no question as to who was dominating it. Underneath the assault, sang an almost desperate relief, and Toni met it with soothing submission; with understanding and compassion and easy comfort.
After they’d rewarded his failure to come unarmed with a quick round of Tony-The-Piñata, he’d been blindfolded and tied up and thrown very unceremoniously into the back of a black van. Even as he snarked at them, he catalogued the turns and distances they traveled, trying to create a mental map on the incredibly off chance that his tracker, Bucky and the comm unit Bucky had insisted upon, were to fail. He felt a little insulted when, with the lack of any spontaneous and twisting turns, he realized that they probably hadn’t bothered to do a dry run. Did they honestly think of him as that weak of a target?
The genius was drawn from her thoughts by the familiar chime of her Starkphone. Without needing to be asked, JARVIS connected to the software of her phone, and in the next second, the screen of one of her monitors was filled with a picture of the love of her life.
“I said I’d take proper care of myself,” Toni interrupted calmly, using her good arm to tug at the jacket Steve was wearing. Obligingly, he started to slip out of it, and the inventor spared a moment to concede how much she loved him. “And I will. But I’m not going to let Peter’s first look at me scare him to death.” Pulling away from Steve with a badly concealed grimace, she started to struggle into the jacket.
It was only much later, under the cover of dark and with the love of his life curled up against his chest, when Steve realized Toni had done something she’d never done to him before in the course of their relationship. Something that shouldn’t have been a big deal, for how small a detail it was, but to him? To someone who knew Toni Stark like he did? It was a big red flag.
She could deny it all she wanted, but Peter was bringing out the softer side to Toni more than anyone else besides himself could. If it were anyone else, she wouldn’t have bothered to preserve the surprise of breakfast in bed, but for Peter? Somehow, she knew how important this was to the kid, and she was doing what she could not to spoil it for him.
Though the thought was so far from comforting, there was an element of working the numbers that steadied her nerves. Her hands were no longer shaking and her stomach wasn’t tying itself in knots, although getting in a breath was still difficult.
Barnes, for once, didn’t rise to the bait. “Stevie…” his voice faltered just slightly as he spoke his best friend’s name, and though it was wrong, Tony still felt a vicious spike of vindictive pleasure because it
Tony, by this point, had managed to inch his way right in front of them, and a distressingly vulnerable hand slowly slipped between Steve’s neck and the blade. “I’m listening,” he stated simply, gaze locked on the kid’s even as he laboriously urged the scepter away from Steve. “I swear, kid, I’m listening. But you gotta stop this, right now, okay?”
The little boy himself was completely oblivious and instead, tongue stuck out to the side of his mouth, carefully took the food over to Toni’s side of the bed, completely unaware of the steadying hand that Steve had underneath the tray. His back protested lightly at the hunched positon but it was a better alternative than risking Peter falling and hurting himself.
The denial came swift and easy to his lips, but before Steve could give it a voice, it just… died there. The words wouldn’t come. Couldn’t come, because honestly… “I never thought about it,” he admitted softly, sounding troubled as he fixed his gaze on a spot on the bedspread. “I don’t think I am, but I just never… I didn’t even realize he had feelings like that for me,” he eventually managed to get out.
Peter seemed to consider this for a long moment, hiding his face against her neck again and absently fisting the material of her vest. Eventually, he pulled away to look back up at her. “D’you promise?”
Erskine was the one who finally stopped her frantic movements by grabbing on to her hand, holding it securely in his without care of the blood that slicked between their palms. He linked his fingers with hers and rested it against his ribs, wordlessly forcing her to stop and accept the inevitable, before directing his gaze at Steve.
“Steve… Steve, stop, I’m gonna… I can’t…” Tony whined softly, so out of it with desire that Steve had to reward him with a slight twist on the next upstroke. It made another stunning sound break free from the inventor and Steve watched, captivated, as Tony’s face creased in pleasure, bottom lip caught between his teeth.
As she grabbed a bunch of papers and a few gadgets, she spoke. “Counter-offer: I’ll convince Dad to fly you guys out; second best, I know, but what can you do; and I’ll send in a prototype I’ve been working on to provide some additional artillery support to the good Captain. No guarantees of how successful it’ll be, but better to have a watch at your back than nothing at all.”
His voice had caught in his throat and suddenly, his anger had taken a backseat to the protective concern that swamped him. She was a fighter – he could tell from the way she straightened her back and faced him head on despite how crappy and scared she must have been – but for some reason, Rhodes had felt an innate desire to step in front of whatever and whoever she was fighting.
And then, because he thought they both needed it, he raised his glass a little in toast. “To Dr. Erskine.”
That would have been it for their little family, if not for the attack ten months ago, which had brought Peter into the fold. He was already one of them because, unspoken though it might have been, he was Toni and Steve’s. Whether or not they had intended this course of action for their relationship, was irrelevant; the very moment that the dust had settled on Toni’s attack on their resident bad guy, and Steve had seen her holding a little bundle of trembling three year old in her arms, curled protectively around him, the super soldier was already halfway gone.
“JARV, feel like slicing me out, here?” she muttered, low enough that she hoped the kid wouldn’t hear her. Compliantly, and without the reprimand she’d expected from her AI, the suit lifted an autopiloted gauntlet and shot off a quick blast. The heat from the proximity made her grit her teeth, but the effect was beneficial and two-fold; not only did it break off the piece of the beam so that she wasn’t pinned anymore, it also cleared away some of the debris to widen their space, thankfully without causing any collapses.
“Somebody’s gotta have your back, Captain,” she murmured, a small smile curving her lips before she ducked down and kissed him, swift and sweet. “Keep this bird in the air, give me as much time as you can,” she instructed him, and though he was usually the one giving the orders, this time he realized that he was out of his depth. Toni, however, was right in the middle of hers.
Toni was looking at him, wide-eyed and speechless, with the expression of one who’d been given a gift that they’d never in a million lifetimes dream of actually receiving. Steve was well-acquainted with the look; knew it intimately, because he knew that he looked at Toni like that every single day; but having it reciprocated, even now while his heart was still trying to thud out of his chest with the realization of what Toni had done, was still the best feeling Steve had ever had coursing through his veins in his entire life.
“What’s it to ya, punk?” Bucky shot back challengingly, but there wasn’t any animosity in his eyes. They were calculating, almost encouraging, and if he were any less lost to the storm of anger and heat in his chest, then Steve might have noticed as much. “It’s Toni’s choice, and I’m sure I could charm her into it.”
He gave into the urge to steal another kiss – or three – and when they finally pried themselves away from each other (because superheroes arrested for public indecency was something that not even Coulson could spin) Toni wrapped her arms around his neck and leaned back in his arms to look up at him.
Thank you all for the patience! My tests are over for now, so here's another nice, long chapter for you guys! I thought it would only be appropriate to update this series today ;)
Toni’s lips lifted in amusement at the sight. “Yeah, he was exhausted. Nodded off before I finished the first two verses of the lullaby.” Because she knew Peter would love it, and that Steve would love it just as much, she took the plushies and laid them with the sleeping child. She would deny it to the ends of the earth, but a part of her was still deeply touched by the fact that Peter felt safer when he clutched on to her and Steve’s stuffed toys.
“That’s great, doll, do that,” Rogers instructed, the relief in his voice premature, but Jim graciously didn’t point that out. “We’re going to start coordinating from up here, we’ll get you out of there, I promise.”
Whatever she’d lived through to make her so accustomed to pain didn’t have any of the trappings of a typical rich kid socialite who’d been handed her life on a silver platter.
She knew those eyes with the same type of familiarity that one had with their favourite book, or a well-watched movie. It was easy for her to read the fear there; fear that she knew hadn’t left Steve since he’d first heard of the incident. She’d seen it plenty times before on his face, and some of those times not even in the field. It was one of her least favourite looks on her super soldier.
She drifted in and out of awareness, Steve and Bruce taking turns to keep her just conscious enough to stay awake. Exhaustion weighed her body down like a load of bricks and pain was a constant companion but she couldn’t sleep; Bruce was too leery about her concussion and in all honesty, Toni wasn’t sure that she’d be able to drudge up the energy to wake up after a mere few hours, if she slept now.
He found, however, that he was forced to do just that a moment later, when everything around them exploded.
She licked her dry lips and hoped against hope that Steve would respond to her epiphany with amusement. “There’s no reason to send all the Avengers away to meet their own ambush,” she pointed out quietly. As she spoke the words, they only made more sense. “The only reason they’d send everyone there, is if the ambush was happening
Steve paused at the familiarity he could hear, even in the disembodied voice, as the other soldier spoke about his best friend. So that was it… this was someone Buck had befriended, probably also part of his regiment, who had agreed to come with on the chance that they could save him. The show of loyalty earned Steve’s trust, admiration and loyalty right back.
Rhodey nodded, and Toni knew she did the right thing when she felt his muscles relax. She didn’t take it personally; if it were up to him, she knew, Rhodes would have stayed, but it was impossible for him to put his wants and needs above that of somebody else’s. That honor, that nobility, those were the qualities that made him the phenomenal man and soldier that he was.
Toni laughed, and though it was a slightly hitching one, it was enough, for now. “So he’s my son when he’s cheeky, and yours when he’s an angel?” Before he could answer, she cocked her head to the side, considering. “Actually, that sounds about right.”
“I gotta ask you something,” Rhodes announced out of the blue, coming to stand with him. The man was out of his armor, this mission calling for a bit more finesse than the War Machine suit was capable of, but even in his fatigues, he looked formidable.
“What do you mean?” Steve pounced on the hint of reservation. He needed to know everything if he was going to go to every end of the earth until he found a way to save her.
Maico nodded solemnly, as if he’d expected that answer, and the adorable sight made it a little easier to handle her own heartache. “Would you be angry with your son if he got stuck because he wasn’t supposed to play in the old warehouse?”
She didn’t see the SHIELD agents, who looked poised to intervene on her behalf. All she saw, was that Peter was standing there, wide-eyed and pale, having obviously witnessed enough through the transparent windows to know that she hadn’t tripped.
He thought that he’d never feel more idiotic than when the other soldiers met him with utter silence, but then the taunting began and wow, there it was. Worse humiliation.
Trust aside, he felt himself bristle slightly. “Not all of them,” Steve replied, voice light but firm. “I wouldn’t be so quick to paint Toni with the same brush as her father.” He pointedly ignored the fact that he’d done just that, and while he was at it, Steve also ignored the irony of him being the one that was defending Toni. He would analyze it later.
Tony seemed taken aback enough for them both, but no one had ever accused the man of getting flustered under pressure. “Yes,” he answered matter-of-factly after a brief second. Though the answer was delivered almost carelessly, it didn’t escape Steve’s notice that the brunet tensed slightly. “Is that what this is about? You’re… are you…?”
Maico giggled, blissfully unaware of the danger that would soon become a lot more noticeable. Toni estimated that they’d been down there going on three hours, at least, and she could already feel her lungs start to smart a little. Thanks to the distraction her charge was inadvertently giving her, the genius was able to keep the stirrings of a panic attack at bay (after the cave and Afghanistan, small spaces were really not her favourite thing in the world) but even through the talking she was doing in an attempt to keep the child’s mind off their predicament, Toni knew that they were approaching dangerous territory. They didn’t have an oxygen supply because they were totally surrounded by rubble upon rubble, and the space was simply too small for two people.
Time passed in a bit of a blur after that, especially after Steve’s first official meeting with who he now knew was Johan Schmidt. He was forced to put it to the back of his mind when the place began to explode, fire and heat crackling menacingly in the air around them.
But still, not even that had been enough to show Tony that he was with someone who didn’t know him at all, and even now, the genius was out with
Perhaps it was the cuss word that he never used in front of Peter, or maybe it was his own enhanced hearing, but Bucky was suddenly all business, face grim and jaw set as he closed the gap between them. He stayed angled, so they could have a clear line of sight towards a blissfully oblivious Peter, but he was close enough that he could still wrap a steadying hand around Steve’s bicep.
Idly playing with the charm calmed Steve; forced his thoughts away from the scary and unthinkable, and towards strategies and plans. When they got there, he would be able to glean a clearer picture of things, but until then…
What did surprise him, however, was the sudden explosion of rubble behind him and the achingly familiar sound of repulsor boots.
As they rode home, Toni felt a deep peace settle inside her, the likes of which she’d only ever experienced before the first time Steve had kissed her. Whatever challenges lay in front of her, she was going to handle, because the alternative simply wasn’t an option; losing this, messing this up, simply wasn’t an option.
Toni knew that without needing to be told. No matter whether they had something as small as a difference of opinion, or as big as a blowout fight, Steve never dismissed her thoughts and feelings, and it helped to know that he was being on guard while he was out there. It didn’t take away that horrible feeling, but it helped.
“That kid is going to be the reason I die,” Barton muttered under his breath, feigning exasperation even through the affection in his eyes. Wisely, he hoisted himself back up into the air shaft before Steve could make a move on him, and Toni only laughed when he called out a hasty, “I’m happy you’re home safe, Robo-Girl,” before disappearing once more.
(In all honesty, Jim still got them an uncomfortable amount as well, but there was definitely some merit in telling himself that he could roll with the punches and Toni would still come out fine.)
Steve’s mind helpfully provided the replay of Toni shutting down the soldier who’d been taunting him by reminding him of how she kicked his ass. If that had apparently extended to more than just Hodge, he could see why Bucky would be worried about that.
She raised an incredulous eyebrow, lips twitching in amusement. “You’ll have to forgive me for not believing that, with the stories I’ve heard, soldier boy.”
Steve had been the one who’d offered him a new job on the side of good; but Toni had been the one to offer him a new
Fear turned to fury, because it was so much easier for Steve to handle. “You promised me you wouldn’t, Stark,” he barked, the voice of the Captain taking the place of the lover. “But if that doesn’t mean a goddamn thing to you, then…”
Okay! For the Italian that Toni says to Steve, you guys can feel free to google a translation, but if you want to be surprised like Steve, wait till next chapter! I'll have Toni telling him there ;)
Heaving an exaggerated sigh ( because Mommy sometimes did that and it always made Uncle Loki smile before he quickly pretended not to) Peter pushed the tall man on to the window seat before scrambling up to join him. Opening the curtain as wide as it would go, he beamed at the sight of the stars, happy that he could see them. Checking the Avengers clock on his bedside and seeing that it was still 11:06, Peter decided he had enough time to explain, and turned to face his companion.
That in itself was another small comfort. Toni had fought, before, to return home, and would fight doubly hard now because she had him, the Avengers and Peter to come back for.
For now, he spun his lover around, bringing Tony back against his chest with a strong arm around his waist. Instinctively, he ground against the other man’s ass, unable to keep himself from indulging a little, only to find that there was a unique sort of torture in pressing up against Tony’s perfect ass with the full knowledge that he wasn’t going to get to be inside him just yet.
Tony rolled his eyes slightly, but there was a hint of pleasure evident in his eyes at the undertone of approval in the words. Why did this guy’s endorsement mean anything to him, anyway? The past was in the stupid past, and it needed to stay there as far as Steve was concerned.
“I’ve heard ‘bout couples mimicking each other’s behaviors, but that’s just eerie,” Bucky commented with a grin. “It’s like she’s here, ‘cept she’s a fella.” Steve rolled his eyes with an amused smile, but before he could quip back a retort about how he’d love Toni as a man just the same, Bucky continued, “Where is she, anyway? I haven’t seen her in a week.”
Hope rekindling in her chest, Toni forced herself into a semi-upright position, the boy still dozing peacefully half across her lap. “Alright, J,” she murmured. “Patch me through, would you?”
He turned on his heel and started to walk away, and reflexively, Steve reached out and caught his wrist. Gently pulled Tony back against his chest and wrapped his arms around the smaller man to keep him trapped there.
“Thought you were done with the weapons of destruction thing?” Bucky asked, somehow managing to sound both snide and accusatory, and Tony had to actively remind himself that Steve loved his best friend and probably wouldn’t be pleased if Tony used him as target practice.
Rogers seemed to absorb that as well, his fists clenched so tightly that Jim would bet his knuckles were stretched white. On the plus side, he supposed, the man hadn’t taken a swing at anything yet, so at least there was that to look forward to.
“I wish I could have spared you the worry,” she amended, and knew that those words had more of an impact as Rhodey’s eyes softened. In a tender gesture that wasn’t out of place between them, the Lieutenant Colonel raised his other arm to engulf her in a gentle, but secure embrace. She heard more words from that gesture than she had from him:
The thought steadied her frazzled nerves and she turned her attention back to the kid clinging to her. A cursory inspection as soon as the dust had settled, had revealed that he had sustained no real injuries aside from some possible bruising. Which was good, awesome even, because she had no Goddamn clue how she would have dealt with a scared kid who was also hurting.
It was odd that Toni’s way of being a good friend, was to refrain from pointing out that Nat loved Toni too much to hurt her, too.
He dropped his head to rest against her collarbone and Toni automatically lifted her hand to run through his hair. “Take it,” she consented softly, turning her head to press a kiss to Steve’s temple without ceasing the motion of her fingers through the silky strands of hair. “We’ve got the whole day.”
“Let’s get one thing straight, Snowflake,” Toni said mock-haughtily, lowering herself gingerly on to the seat next to Bucky’s. “I’m nobody’s co-pilot.
“We have had very different upbringings, Rogers,” she murmured, sounding equally matter-of-fact and weary, and it made something deep in Steve rumble quietly. Made him wish, inexplicably, that he could have known Toni a little younger and dragged her to the tiny place he had called home, before throwing her at his mom and letting Sarah Rogers fix her the way she seemed to be able to fix anything.
Rather than waste time asking while Toni looked like death warmed over, Steve rested her with utmost gentleness against the leg of the desk, loathe to leave her but not seeing an alternative, and all but sprinted to the little desk near the mouth of the tent that held all her things. In another instance, he might have felt a spark of chagrin about rifling through the inventor’s things, but as it were, his mind was consumed by nauseating fear that Toni was sicker beyond what he was capable of comprehending.
Without another word to Bruce, and trusting that the scientist would understand, Natasha hung up. Thor, watching the news, understood enough – she could see as much on his face, usually so lively and jovial but now marked with the lines of a warrior who had known too much death not to think of it, now – but there was still another person who needed to know.
Tony was no passive participant, and as he swiped a thumb against the spot just underneath Steve’s ear, the super soldier groaned, standing up in a quick motion and pulling Tony with him. Ceaselessly sexy, the genius instinctively wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, and they could only hope that none of the team was hoping to use the gym today because they certainly weren’t going to make it to a bed.
“You want me,” Bucky started incredulously, eyes widened slightly, “to go ask the dame you have eyes for, to go dancin’ with me?” He huffed a laugh, sounding like he was trying to tell Steve something that he just wasn’t hearing. After a moment of silence, in which his best friend looked at his expectantly and the super soldier just shrugged in response, Bucky rolled his eyes in disbelief. “You’re even further gone for her than I thought.” And before Steve could snap, ask just what he meant by that, Bucky continued, “Okay, well, you have fun figuring everything out with Agent Carter. I’m gonna go spend the night with the smartest and most beautiful dame this city has to offer. Maybe the morning, too,” he added with a salacious grin that normally would have had Steve shaking his head in fond exasperation.
She hadn’t removed her tear ducts, she hadn’t been created by her father to be the most highly functioning robot in existence, and she certainly wasn’t just inherently a sociopath.
To his credit, Steve knew the very second the words left his mouth, that they were a mistake of epic proportions. There was no part of him that meant them, but he’d frozen so spectacularly, shocked even at himself for the words he’d thrown at her, that he couldn’t figure out how to backtrack, to apologize.
still did. He didn’t even bat an eyelid about her first priority being getting back home to her son.
About the bruises she’d been sporting the night they’d come back from rescuing the soldiers from the 107th.
Well, a mother bear protected her cubs with her life. She fought to death, and then a little further, and showed no mercy when a threat was presented to her baby. She would never let harm come to her cubs as long as she was around.
There was only quiet. The sound of her own ragged breath and the looming certainty that those breaths could very well be limited.
Just when he was starting to entertain the notion that these USO shows weren’t the absolute worst things in the world (the kids, at least, were really cute) Steve had to do a show for one of the regiments serving in Italy.
“Looks like I missed all the fun,” Toni continued, the comment deliberately light even as she nearly stumbled with the unsteady, unplanned flight they were taking. She took the helmet off, shaking out her hair. “Honestly, you keep benching me for the all the interesting missions.”
how many times I held my breath and prayed that the suit was as indestructible as I hoped, that my friend hadn’t died in a bid to save my life, and that was when I only thought that there was a soldier in there who’d become my ally. But now… now, I have to look back on all those times and see that it was
“You make such pretty sounds for me.” He husked the words into her ear like it took a great deal of effort to form them. If she had the presence of mind for it, Toni might have felt smug about that. “My gorgeous girl.”
“One at a time!” he ordered Bucky, heart in his throat as he watched his unsteady pseudo brother cross the beam to the other side. To safety.
Things had simply grown from there. Natasha had not only gotten proof that Toni Stark was the furthest thing from what her report had suggested, but she’d also gained an ally. And then a friend. And then a confidante.
“Hey, baby,” he crawled to her, fear clogging his throat and making him forget everything except for Toni and the fact that she was hurting. “How bad? Do you need to shut the suit down?” They would have a hell of a time explaining just what the inventor was doing there, and they’d need to find a way to get the suit off the train without anyone realizing that the pilot wasn’t in it anymore, but those were all semantics. Steve only cared about Toni in that moment.
How was it possible for a man to look so achingly beautiful? The sun cresting over the city was a miracle in itself, and yet it paled in comparison to the soft smile that quirked full lips. The sky was lightened with the promise of day, but it was shadowed by the sparkle in honeysuckle eyes that lit Steve up from the inside out. Manhattan’s most impressive high-rises were as stunning as Lego towers when pitted against the sharp cut of Tony’s jaw, or the graceful arch of his neck, or the deceptively lean but powerful set of his shoulders.
Despite his earlier words, Tony found himself answering as he stashed away another two butterfly knives. “I’m the front-running name in clean energy and defensive combat tech in the world, but what a lot of people forget, is that I was groomed for my whole life to be a weapons manufacturer.” Straightening, he fixed an unwavering gaze on Barnes. “I grew up in war, around war, immersed in war, and somehow, people think that I did that without ever being part of it, but that’s not true. Weapons – whether it’s designing them, making them, or handling them – is practically coded into my DNA, but because I don’t use that knowledge, it’s easy to assume that I don’t have it. But I do. And just because I don’t use it, doesn’t mean I
Tony pulled away a split second before Steve could physically pull him back, which was probably for the best, but the super soldier’s luck ended there. “On the hunt for ice-cream,” he answered, as though it should have been obvious, grinning as he looked over the other man. “It’s been years, Ry,” the brunet commented, sounding like he was lamenting the time that stood between then and now. Then, almost as an afterthought, Tony shifted to put Steve a little more in his line of focus. “Let me introduce you. This is my buddy, Steve Rogers.”
Efficient hands tied off the sutures, taped a piece of gauze over it and secured a bandage around her abdomen, as good as any field medic in Steve’s opinion. Toni dry swallowed two painkillers and packed her kit neatly away before Steve broke the comfortable silence.
Only a handful of months after accepting her invitation to live at the newly christened Avengers Tower, Clint had been caught between a rock and a hard place after a call from Laura, which had revealed the slightly pressing problem of their son’s increasing rebellion. Cooper wasn’t a bad kid, but he was a hyperactive one, not unlike Clint had been, and his perceived forced confinement at the farm had been enough to make him go a bit stir-crazy. The kid loved music, in every form, but with no real way of learning how to play an instrument, his only outlet had been playing outside; which, as he grew older, had lost its appeal quickly.
was the first thing the redhead said, sounding tearful and scared but a lot more composed. Something, Steve distantly recognized, he probably had Bucky to thank for.
“James Buchanan Barnes, how dare you?” Toni gasped dramatically, feigning insult. It made Steve’s lips twitch, even more so when she pointedly put her nose in the air and marched over to link her arm with his. “Steve, you are now officially my new favourite. You’re going to get all the coolest, most fun weapons and upgrades from me, and the only thing Barnes is going to get, is all the boring old guns and military approved equipment.”
“Not a chance, baby,” he murmured roughly, the endearment slipping from his lips accidentally, even as he thoroughly enjoyed the pretty little flush that came over Toni’s cheeks. With a tenderness that was at odds with the hungry way he’d kissed her before, Steve pressed his lips against the inventor’s collar, right at the top of the painful looking lines. “What’s going on?” he asked softly, only a hint of command underlying his voice. “What are these? Are you… are you sick?”
And was rewarded when, against the backdrop of the rising sun painting the Manhattan skyline a soft orange, he spotted Tony.
“Language, darling,” Tony drawled lazily, drawing on his innate ability to appear completely unaffected by his situation. “Honestly, I don’t know where the fuck you learned it.”
He wasn’t entirely sure why, but he told her about the Senator’s offer; about his new, upcoming role promoting the sales of war bonds in USO shows. About being a national symbol. Captain America, they wanted to call him.
It was enough for Steve to follow her right over that edge, too, and with a groan muffled into her neck, he came hard inside her. The feel of him, warm and pulsing and deep inside her, was so intimate that Toni could only hold her lover close and sink into grateful bliss, unable to fathom how she’d gotten so lucky as this.
Thor had been the last, not for a lack of enthusiasm about the idea, but because of how long it had taken him to sort out the mess with Loki, and then things on Asgard, and then his issues with Jane, the woman he’d fallen in love with two years prior. The Norse God had been thrilled to be counted among the few who had a place in the Avengers Tower, and had settled in with far more enthusiasm and an almost innocent joy.
Eavesdropping on Tony’s conversation had been wrong, but he couldn’t keep making things worse by pretending that he hadn’t heard what he’d heard. “Why are you over me?”
Though Rhodes had to have come to the same conclusion, he didn’t seem eager to tell Toni as much. “I got you, kid,” he said instead, and it rankled Steve equally that he was offering platitudes like Toni couldn’t handle the truth when she was stronger than any of them combined, and also that, well, he was offering platitudes. Offering comfort. Which Steve could have done himself, thankyouverymuch.
She rolled her eyes slightly, but smiled and lifted two fingers to her forehead in a lazy little salute. “You got it, Winghead.”
Fixing her attention back on Peter, she reached for the rag that she always had hooked to her back pocket. Thankfully, since she’d been working on wiring today, the cloth was clean, and she used it to gently mop at his face and help him blow his nose. They were about done, and she had just coaxed a giggle from her little companion with loud complaints about how he’d scared her when he’d yelled at Howard about being a bully, so of course, that was the moment that the door to the roof swung open to reveal a slightly wild-eyed Steve Rogers.
In his life, there’d only been one time and one person who’d managed, not to erase his helplessness, but at least to ease its sting by turning it into an opportunity for growth. It hadn’t been Laura, who was his lifeline and savior and angel nevertheless, and it hadn’t been Nat, who represented his salvation, to him.
For his part, Steve was awkwardly perched on what was left of the window seat now, stretching his arms around them so as to encompass both Toni and Peter in his embrace. It was probably for the benefit of their son, cocooned between them all warm and safe, but it worked wonders on Toni as well; gave her a sense of sturdiness, a foundation and a pillar of strength to lean on, and unknowingly, even soothed her own inner turmoil about the uncertainty of the future. Because whatever happened to her, if anything should come to pass, she knew that Steve would be there for Peter, and Peter for him. She would fight tooth and nail not to let it come to that, but there was a certain comfort in knowing that they would be there for one another, because they were the most important things in her world.
Toni laughed, the sound breathless to Steve’s trained ears, but rather than crack something back like he expected, she only dragged herself to the wall, propping herself against it.
For the longest time, she hadn’t known what to do with it. With all this unconditional love and affection and acceptance. Nobody had ever taught her that – the Red Room had been about survival and about becoming cold, soulless, bloodthirsty machines who lived, breathed and existed solely for the mission. The only mention of love in that thrice damned place, had been how to use it as a tool of manipulation for the good of the cause. Because that was what it was, as she’d known it; love was a tool.
Toni wrinkled her nose slightly, a contemplative look in her eyes. “Not a good idea just yet,” she shook her head in the negative. A couple months ago, Steve might have accused her of wanting to draw out the design to maximize attention for herself, but now, he waited patiently to hear just why she had doubts about her creation. “There are some tweaks I need to make to the design,” she explained finally. “And the suit is… it’s complicated. It runs off a very potent, potentially unstable power source that isn’t very easy to manufacture alone, forget about mass production. And there are a lot of risks in using the power source. Risks to whoever wields the armor. Risks I can’t take on other people, other soldiers. Not even for a weapon that could potentially act as a deterrent to war entirely.”
And his smile? God, Tony’s smile lit up every inch of a darkened space. Steve did whatever he could on a consistent basis, just so that he could have that smile as a part of his day. Whether it was lounging on the couch in Tony’s workshop, or bringing him lunch when he forgot to eat, or listening to him even though Steve only understood about half the words, he did it all, because the only thing better than Tony’s smile was his laugh, and on the best days, Steve got to hear that, too.
She would be leaving behind a family, now, if the unthinkable should come to pass. She’d have to leave Peter; her son, who’d lost so much in his tender six years already, and didn’t deserve to lose another person. She’d have to leave Steve, who’d given up so much for the world, for this job of theirs, and who she knew would find a way to shoulder the blame and break his own heart. The thought of that alone was enough to cripple her, enough to turn her cold right to her bones, and that was even before she thought of Rhodey and Pepper. Of Nat and Clint and Bucky and Bruce. Thor. Coulson. Loki. Even Fury, to an extent.
enemies. His rivals? Oh, fuck, Tony had rivals. He had thought that he’d left that all behind the day he’d turned his back on his father and Stark Industries.
. She sounded hysterical, panic of the worst sort, and the Captain’s heart froze in his chest, because anything that had Pepper sounding like that, saying his name like a goddamn prayer, couldn’t have been good.
Drawing away, Toni didn’t fully register her brow knitting with concern. “Is it an assignment?” she asked solemnly. It was never any easier to let Rhodey go off into dangerous territories, not before or after knowing what she did and having felt what she’d felt, but Toni had long ago mastered the art of composure. Regardless of how she felt about it, she would never do anything but gracefully relent to watching Rhodey go, her heart in her throat and a fervent prayer to a God she didn’t believe in on her lips.
“Alright, sweetie, we’re gonna get you home, okay?” she promised softly, gratified when the words made Maico look up at her with heartbreakingly earnest hope and trust in his eyes. “You’re going to have to close your eyes and trust me, honey, can you do that for me?”
There were a few false starts as the man, ostensibly in charge, struggled to find the words to reply. It gave Tony a brief pulse of satisfaction because although he couldn’t see, it was enough to hear the man flounder. Served him right for kidnapping Steve.
In an instant, Peter was wide awake, scrambling out of his covers. Earlier, when Aunt Nat and Uncle Clint and Uncle Thor had thought he was still napping, Uncle Loki had come to visit. He
Her entire succinct report made Steve feel sick. It was glaringly obvious that there was no way around this impossible situation, that didn’t include some part of his world being in danger. Helplessness turned to anger, that started to crackle deep inside him, burning away the nausea. “What are you going to do?”
“Eight,” he answered softly, making her feel a little sick as he reminded her even more starkly of Peter. Who, she hoped, would never find himself in a situation like this.
Unfortunately, a side effect of his smart mouth was getting into altercations, and the fact that he was tied up and blindfolded didn’t seem to stop Steve’s abductor. A fist buried in his gut without warning, and the surprise of the attack left him unable to bite down a pained gasp of air or plant his feet to avoid crash-landing to the floor. It didn’t really matter, in the grand scheme of things, because barely an instant passed before someone was kicking him in the stomach, and then someone else in the middle of his back, while another person connected with the arm he’d hastily thrown around his vulnerable head.
Breaking the kiss, Toni lifted her hands to frame Steve’s face, hoping the action would impress the seriousness of her words upon him. “I’m right here, Stevie,” she murmured. Amber eyes locked on blue. “I’m not going anywhere. Be here, with me. You don’t need to worry that I’m going to break at the slightest touch.” Very deliberately, she put her hands over his and clamped down until he was holding her tightly again. “I want
God, how he wished that he’d known this before. Howard’s time in this century could have been so much better utilized with Steve beating the hell out of him.
behalf; not aimed at him, and certainly not meant to belittle him, but in defense of him and the respect she thought he deserved.
As it were, he possessed no such ability, and since he was not content to leave his post unguarded for long enough to call forth for the bifrost and ask his friend for an update of the Woman of Iron, the Thunder God had to settle for getting a little breathing room when Lady Natasha came to relieve him of his watch.
“That could work,” he muttered absently as he envisioned the armor in his mind, making the mods with blurrily quick fingers so that the hologram reflected what he saw in his head. There was no time to fabricate an entire suit of armor, of course, but one sleeve and the chest would more than do for now. If they took a headshot at him, or a shot at his femoral artery, that would just be tough luck.
“We’ll take it,” Peggy answered swiftly, before Steve could. She turned to him and offered a quick reassurance. “Toni’s prototypes are generally good enough that they go directly into the main manufacturing line without any more tweaks, unless they’re from her because she wants to get creative. It would be God sent to have some Stark weaponry at your disposal for this.”
He gentled his lips after a few moments, and Toni dimly became aware that they were both breathless. When he finally pulled away, it wasn’t very far, and his forehead dipped to rest against hers in a gesture of tenderness that made her the back of her eyes sting.
Several beats passed before Steve realized what he was saying; and realized that the words were so true, they felt etched into his very bones. Toni was his. She was
She held the little boy close to her, pressing kisses to his face that tasted salty when it mixed in with his tears. “Oh, my baby,
The words worked as they were intended to; comprehension dawned over Steve’s face and something close to empathy eased the combative stance that Kevin-the-stupid-paramedic had fallen into. For his part, Bruce didn’t falter for half a breath as he worked on her injuries, but the genius didn’t miss the shuffling motion that brought him a little closer to her.
It only took a fraction of a second before Steve got with the program, taking control of the kiss and pressing in as close as he could manage. The sexy little moan she gave when he deepened the kiss made him want to hum in approval, but instead, he just kept savoring the unique taste that was Toni and dragging his teeth along her bottom lip just to hear her gasp. And then swallow that sound right up, too.
Steve felt something solid and heavy drop into his gut, making his stomach churn. In the weeks after that battle, he’d gone off the grid, attempting to reconcile his past with his present and also chase down some closure on the time he had lost by trying to reconnect with old friends and familiar places. It was only when he’d realized how pointless an endeavour that was, that he found his way to the Tower and into Toni’s – their – home. By that time, the negative publicity must have died down, because he hadn’t heard anything about it, but the thought of Toni ever facing so much hatred and vitriol without ever telling them how long she’d been doing it for them… it made him sick.
The second, was that she was totally self-absorbed and had absolutely no regard for anything but herself. The woman actively tried to antagonize everyone from Dr. Erskine to Colonel Phillips and showed absolutely no hint of giving a damn as to how disrespectful and downright infuriating she was being. It was honestly a mystery to him, how she was still around, and for that matter, how everyone still seemed to be able to speak of her with equal parts affection and exasperation.
“What’s your name, honey?” she asked softly in fluent Spanish, trying to distract him while her mind barreled its way through calculations and probabilities and backup plans to backup plans.
Not unsurprisingly, his father had disagreed. Loudly and vehemently. The fight that had followed was the worst they’d ever had, ending with Howard laying into Tony like a punching bag, and Tony packing a bag of meager belongings when he could stand and showing up, beaten to hell and sobbing himself hoarse, on his best friend’s doorstep.
Later, they’d told him that he’d been lucky. That his mother had shielded him with her body, which was what had kept him alive, and that armed forces had been quick enough to respond before the hostiles could take advantage of the situation and kidnap him.
Steve didn’t need to ask, to know that his best friend had had backup plans to backup plans this morning. If the talking hadn’t worked, he had no doubt that Tony would have thought of something else to make sure that Steve walked out of the battle alive. That was just who Tony was; always thinking, always solving, always ten steps ahead. Twenty. Thirty.
Steve had apologized and Toni had forgiven him; not even in that order. The genius had forgiven him even before he had asked her to, because she was just special like that, but nevertheless, he had apologized. He’d fixed his mistake. He’d healed the wound he’d inadvertently inflicted. He was sure of it…
And if it crept closer to 48 hours… well, then, Toni was just glad that they had plenty of babysitters on hand.
There were people around them – medics and rescue workers and their friends – and a whole swarm of reporters with flashing cameras and screaming questions. Steve was pretty sure he even heard the distant sounds of the kid Toni had saved, trying to come forward. But just for one brief instant, nothing existed outside of him and the love of his entire existence.
him. And knowing that he meant that much to them went a long way towards tempering his possessiveness.
“Liar,” she accused him mildly, the smirk on her face softening the response. Her grin widened when he sent her a sheepish smile and Toni swallowed down a laugh, knowing that her ribs certainly wouldn’t thank her for it if she didn’t.
For all that she tried, Toni couldn’t help the way her lips pursed at the title. She’d told everyone – Steve, more than once – that Peter was not her son. She was not the kid’s mother. She had taken him in as her ward, sure, and she was his legal guardian, but she was
Steve could admit, in the relative comfort of his own mind, that eavesdropping on Tony’s conversation with Rhodes had probably been wrong of him. Okay, it had definitely been wrong of him, but in his defense, it hadn’t been his intention; all he’d wanted to do was join one of his best friends for another one of their sleepless nights made easier and better for each other’s company. Nightmares plagued both of them on a more than frequent basis and after a while, it had become second nature for one of them to seek out the other when the images in their heads got too bad to handle alone. It had been a natural progression to go from helping each other out to becoming best friends, and an equally natural progression for those nights to go from necessary to voluntary. And why wouldn’t it have? Not only was Tony fascinating company, but being the sole focus of his attention was also a heady thing, not least of all because the man himself was so vastly different when they were alone, as opposed to when they were in public.
For her part, Toni simply cast her gaze away from him, but not before he caught the pained weariness that still lingered in her expressive eyes.
“Toni.” Steve cut her off with a gentle smile. “It’s okay, you don’t have to say. I don’t want you to get into any more trouble. If you could just tell him I said thanks, that would be great.” The last thing Steve wanted was for the inventor to work herself into a state, although he had to admit, seeing Stark ramble on, so far removed from her usual cool, composed self, was pretty… well, adorable. That was the only word that he could think of to do the sight justice. She was adorable like that.
“He went down alright?” Steve asked in a low rumble from Peter’s doorway. He was laden with an armful of new plush toys; this time, the rest of the Avengers to go with the Iron Woman and Captain America that the little boy was currently snuggled up with.
So what if she’d rescued the adorable three-year-old baby after the latest attack on the city had left him orphaned? So what if she’d thrown her considerable power around to ensure that he stayed with her, because he only felt safe around her and had no other living relatives? So what if she’d hit their villain of the day with a blast from her repulsors so powerful that it had taken him out for a full week, when he’d mocked the child clinging to her like a limpet? None of that spawned from any sort of sudden maternal instincts. It was, more likely, attributable to her need for atonement combined with a deadly possessive streak to make sure that no one touched her things.
But the promise was a sacred and precious thing between them, which was why they only used it sparingly. Toni couldn’t bring herself to take advantage of it, especially when it could create a precedent for herself; there was the distinct risk that she wouldn’t let Rhodey leave for a mission again. Which wouldn’t have been fair to him, and Toni couldn’t have asked him to.
Dismissing it uneasily, he followed Tony out of the lab, allowing the brunet’s incessant chatter to sooth his mind and his confusing feelings. The walk outside had definitely been a good idea; the crisp nighttime air combined with great company and peace in the city that he loved made for an effective distraction from what had knocked him all the way off-kilter since hearing that Tony had had feelings for him.
Toni hushed him softly, pulling him closer and running her fingers through his hair as she continued to rock him. “No,
“You probably won’t for much longer,” Fury commented, and an ominous feeling crept up Toni’s spine. “Not when you find out that your boyfriend offered Howard a room in the Avenger Tower until he can make it back home.”
her mind suggested helpfully, and it almost made Toni snort in laughter. Not because thinking of Steve was a bad idea, but because she spent most of her waking and sleeping moments thinking of the man in some way or another. He wasn’t ever truly out of her thoughts.
If her voice was a little strained and her eyes a little shiny, Steve wasn’t going to be the one to say anything.
Steve thought the answer was obvious. “It was an emergency trip. I had to stay to look after Peter.”
Rather than Steve, it was Bucky who answered, sounding playful and light on the surface but with an undercurrent of throbbing relief.
Not even the emergency surgery and temporarily having a car battery and electromagnet shoved into his chest, could compare to the pain of losing his mother.
Natasha Romanoff had known one, irrefutable truth for the better part of her whole life: Love was for children.
Steve nodded once in agreement before taking off to hitch a ride with the last van. Getting in was tense, but easy enough with his enhanced capabilities, and it wasn’t too long before he found the prisoners from the one-oh-seventh.
Two fingers slipped around the barrier of her panties and pushed into her with an almost embarrassing ease. Toni tried to rock down on them but Steve still had a grip on her waist, and he growled low as she strained underneath him. Evidently, she was his to control this time… something Toni could distantly understand, since Steve had been robbed of all control in the past few weeks, ever since Argentina.
Distantly, he heard Pepper’s voice, asking him what they needed to do, if there was anything she could do, and then Bucky’s voice was joining hers, trying to urge him out of an inaction that he wasn’t totally aware he’d fallen into. Before he could figure out how to answer them, remember how to be the steady Captain instead of the terrified lover, a voice came over the comms.
Chances were good that whoever this was hadn’t gotten the memo about Toni staying behind. It wasn’t a regular thing for her to sit-out of field missions, not when she was one of only two that provided aerial support to the team. More to the point, if they’d been banking on her absence, the attack couldn’t be directed at her or the tower. There’d be no point, as they wouldn’t be able to gain access to her lab, and nobody else was home. It was just her, and…
“Designs, I’d wager,” Peggy replied when he asked, her tone a little curt in a way that Steve could tell was meant for Howard Stark. “Wouldn’t be the first time that we needed to bend the rules a little and needed Stark Senior’s help to do so. He’ll take credit for her work in exchange for what she’s asking him to do.”
around, actually, I think is what I said,” she still managed to shoot back, hazel eyes sparkling with amusement. “I suppose I could have been a little more tactful,” she allowed lightly.
What little color she’d regained quickly drained from Toni’s face again, in the split second it took for her to realize the mistake she’d made. For a few tense moments, silence reigned between them, broken only by the occasional shout of the soldier still looking for him, but heading thankfully in the opposite direction now.
“No, it’s okay,” she pulled away, taking a breath to steady herself. Smiled shakily at him. “I’m okay. Just got ambushed by everything for a second.”
So instead of begging her to wait for him, instead of pleading with her to stay safe until he could get there and keep both her and Peter from harm, Steve swallowed his fear and rage and asked, “How will I know where to come when I get there? How will I know where you are?”
The next few moments happened in a blur of activity. Suddenly, the door was opening, and the rest of the Avengers were flooding in wearing identically grim expressions. Bucky snatched the phone from him, talking to Pepper in harsh, low barks, Clint intercepted Peter, who was rushing towards Steve, and Natasha and Bruce made a beeline for him.
, he’d claimed this morning, and when he sent her a subtle look, Toni had known with a blast of affection that Coulson had been talking about protection for
“Seems like a bust. You might’ve been right,” he admitted, conceding defeat to the argument they’d had just before the team had left, in which Toni had insisted that the Intel they’d received was faulty, and also too vague and directionless to amount to anything. “There’s been no evidence to suggest that anyone’s used this place for at least a decade, least of all a secret HYDRA base.”
That perceived indestructibility, along with her history of brilliance splashed out across the media, had lent her the reliability that she’d needed to smooth talk her way into the heart of the Board. Having their confidence backing her had given her the juice to make some of the more outlandish moves she’d made in her tenure as CEO, and those risky ventures had all culminated in turning SI into an international empire.
And the stubborn woman still insisted that she wasn’t mother material, whatever that was supposed to mean.
Dimly, she thought that Steve would probably disapprove of her line of thinking, if only because he didn’t take her near-death experiences as lightly as she pretended to, but it was the God’s honest truth. Fire flared between them with the barest of provocation, and when it was combined with the sweet, dizzying relief that they’d survived whatever had been trying to take them out? It was positively
And that, Toni thought, that was actually the easiest part about this whole thing. “I do,” she replied without hesitation. “I trust you. And you’re coming for me, I know that.”
And it worked, despite everything, because Tony loved Steve more than life and the rest of the world combined. He would do anything for Steve. Even this. Even… building weapons.
To the best of Bucky’s knowledge, that interaction between them had never seen the outside of Toni’s workshop. Not even Stevie knew what had transpired between them, as evidenced by the punk’s incessant badgering about it, and neither of them made any move to enlighten the curious Avengers.
Suddenly, a smirk broke out over Tony’s face, easy and amused. Though the tension didn’t leave him, his eyes lost some of its hardness, likely sensing their precipice of victory the same as Steve. “Neither,” the genius admitted brazenly. “It’s from Lion King 2.”
“Is she okay?” she demanded when the call connected, refusing to acknowledge the shakiness of her voice or the grim look of understanding that passed over the Thunder God’s face. “Is she still alive?”
The soldiers erupted into laughter and jeering, this time directed at the guy who was putting his pants to rights and sitting down with a few muttered curses and a crimson face.
The words, combined with the searing kiss they shared and the wonderful feeling of her around him, and Steve came hard, his own orgasm throwing Toni off the edge one more time as well. For a while, they stayed like that, locked together and sharing breath as they fought to move back from the edge that they were perched upon together, and when they finally did, the first thing Steve did was press his lips firmly against hers.
