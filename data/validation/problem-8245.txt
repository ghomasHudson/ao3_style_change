“Gallivanting…working her ass off…such synonymous phrases, really.” Rhodey smiled, sarcasm doled out in perfectly measured helpings. “Not like she isn’t the second highest ranked officer in the Nova Corps and has a
Natasha raised her head, pixie-short hair curling under her earlobes. She’d left the grey at her temples untouched. “It was time.”
A couple sections are unbetaed, I'll probably revisit once I'm a bit more coherent. Quotes taken from the Avengers (2012) and Captain America : Civil War (2016), as well as from the prequel to this story, namely Clint's little monologue.
, Steve wanted to say – the foreignness of the thought prickled at him. It was… it was out of place, in this picture-perfect scene, out of time, because he’d never have known to have the thought if not for pop-culture and watching movies about the seventies in the futu–
In typical fashion, something had to happen to interrupt this pleasantly domestic scene. A faint trill filled the air, and FRIDAY said- “You have an incoming call from Miss Potts.”
There was an almost untenable pause at the end of that, like Sam knew what he wanted to say and didn’t know whether to say it. “Tony knows about the farm.”
(and this was the part where the grip should’ve slackened, but Steve’s pulse under his own stayed steady. Waiting.)
Blue eyes regarded him, calm and non-judgemental from the safety of a reflection. He’d evidently been mistaken.
One handed was no longer enough. Tony brought his left hand in and swung double-handed, straight at the waist, only for the shield to shudder back so badly that it felt like his wrist bones had slid free of their sockets. He bit through his lip and powered through, skin on the inside of his left knuckles dragged raw with the force of the hits. Nothing, nothing, nothing. It was like pummelling away at a wall. A wall that wouldn’t relent, wouldn’t give up, wouldn’t listen no matter how hard and desperately you tried.
, amplified and echoing through the solidity of the pillow pressed under Tony’s ear, and he’d breathe deeper and drift off to sleep.
Steve wasn’t following the script, the traditional wry half-grin replaced by something warm, yet serious. His gaze was steadfast. “Genius has nothing to do with it.”
For a second, Steve stared at the phone in his hand, wondering stupidly if he’d managed to pick it up after all. Then the source of the voice registered, and…of course. Tony Stark wouldn’t let himself get snuck up on that easily.
It was real, in another, deliberately forgotten lifetime. Five years, and they weren’t even the worst of it.
Tony glanced down and was greeted by a whirring arm, rising and falling in cheery motions. A little flicker upwards of the lips- Tony leaned a hand down to pat DUM-E’s strut, then continued stroking in continuous movements, loathe to leave contact. “Crept up on me while I was busy, didn’t you. You’re getting sneakier.”
“My wife cleaned that.”
more maneouvreabili–”
, this never used to happen when he was back at the Facility-
For a second, Steve couldn’t breathe.
Silence.
He’s sitting in the gym with the armour half on, steaming over his wounds, when Steph walks in. She’s taken off her boots which takes off several inches from her height. Her uniform jacket is tied around her waist, strands of hair plastered to a grimy forehead, face lined and drawn and weary. She looks smaller, and tired, and Tony doesn’t think he can describe the sharpness of the guilt lancing through him.
Steve’s eyebrows were practically meeting at the centre now, a perfectly-formed tableau of confusion. “Is that what they’re calling transistors these days?”
Keeping all that in mind…..irony would laugh itself silly at the fact that
He’d missed it. They were all significant in their own rights, the Mark I that set him free, the Mark II that lifted him to the clouds – but there was something inescapably…singular, about this one. Maybe it was just the nostalgia, maybe the visceral sensation of being inside the suit of a hero on a team of heroes. This was the armour that had dismantled a Chitauri whale, that had directed a repulsor at Loki’s head, that had been caught on countless cameras and immortalised in photographs…the very first ones, of the Avengers.
T’Challa paused, the black eyes surveying and scrutinising Steve to his very soul, it felt like. “Of a kind. I’m actually heading out to meet the very topic of our just concluded conversation.”
These…..remnants, swirling around his head. They didn’t feel like acceptance. They smelled faintly of regret, and Steve was starting to realise that maybe it was the difference between letting something go, and chucking that something against the wall to see it shatter before your eyes.
“And make another apocalypse bot? No thank you.” He didn’t mean it, not really; it was an easy excuse. An easy excuse his brain came up with wayyy too quickly, but self-awareness was for morons and Tony wasn’t playing.
He wasn’t going to pick up, Steve realised, hollow and helpless. His thumb was poised, inches from the screen, locked into stillness. Now it only remained to see if he could muster the courage to swipe left, and end things.
But everything else was falling short.
Three jars of blackberry jam on the counter, not counting the ones presumably-almost definitely filling up the fridge. The breath whistled out of his tightening chest; deceptively, despicably light. Sometimes Clint wished he and Nat weren’t half this brutally honest with each other.
She, on the other hand, is made of better stuff.
“Not sure if they still keep you in the know, but I tend to do the calling these days.” The swagger was nowhere near Stark levels, but unmistakeably present. It was brilliant.
“What about now.” Tony’s voice spoke, low and emotionless.
“Maybe.” Another quicksilver smile, Stark’s eyes searching Sam’s own features with unerring accuracy. “You ever wish you’d done things differently?”
“Yes, of course. That was silly of me.” Ridiculous. JARVIS was never silly. “Are you cold?”
All those years of fighting face to face and fighting back to back, banter rising and falling, arguments simmering and boiling over, ebb and flow and yield and
So of course, what he ended up saying was an astoundingly unhelpful- “Maybe we can stick it out together for the night?”
“You must miss your….. routine.” God, what a bonehead thing to say.
Steve’s eyes squeezed shut, but those fingers remained, a red-hot image burnt into the back of his eyelids. He knew, he didn’t know how since he didn’t clearly remember them from his own memory, but he knew that this tiny detail had not been altered. That Tony Stark had flinched back and looked away and covered his vulnerable head with his fragile hands in a vain attempt to protect himself from the final blow. A blow he’d involuntarily, reflexively believed would come, and be fatal when it did.
, not even a
He’d barely emerged on the sidewalk when men and women in emergency gear began brushing by him, stretchers already enroute for the unconscious goons. Must’ve been on standby at that perimeter Steve was talking about; New York was getting good at this. A couple cop cars, people in uniform reporting into their walkie-talkies, one ambulance parked ten paces away and another visible up the road, an EMT comforting a woman wrapped in a blanket (probably from Jersey). His mics were even picking up the whoosh of a nearby fire extinguisher, some good Samaritan hosing down the geraniums.
Tony said nothing.
The underlying disagreement still existed. Trust….was in short supply. They were both going out on a limb and a half- the wounds had been inflicted too deep, and were yet to scab over. This was just duct tape- to messily hold the blood within. There would be scars, and ramifications, and nothing was ever going to be like the olden times ever again.
“Now now, Cap.
A wave of subdued understanding broke over memory-Tony’s features. He took a step towards the car door, and paused for a second. “You alright?”
“You seem like you know a lot about us.” Everyone did. All those splashes in the papers, the gigantic headlines. Captain America and Iron Man, standing back to back against a portal opening in the sky. Captain America and Iron Man, gauntleted fist against vibranium shield, while an airport burned in the background.
“But myself.” The stoic face morphed into one overcast by pain, a kind that Tony knew too intimately. But T’Challa’s lips were curving up, through it all- words final and undeniable. “Men of science you called us, Tony Stark- yet before that, we are men of the people. The people whose wellbeing we feel personally responsible for; the people whom we’ve sworn to protect. We do not have the luxury to feel hurt, as others do. Our hurt is but a tiny drop in an ocean of millions- but we, unlike most, have the power to make it matter. It is therefore on us…” And the Black Panther exhaled a little, irony and resignation coiled into one, “To make sure that we don’t.”
“When you’re off being a shrink to people-”
“It would seem so, wouldn’t it?” Tony shut the door behind them, patting his sense of responsibility in the back a little while he did it. Robbers were a great problem in Queens, he’d heard. Though it would be the epitome of bad luck if a burglar chose Spiderman’s apartment of all the shitholes in the place…..a couple of broken bones at the very least, and a great deal of humiliation. The kid liked playing around with his food, a little. As long as the morsels were appropriately-sized, Tony had absolutely zilch problems with it. He was even a little proud.
building stone and when he steps even closer, close enough to smell the sweat off her leather and old-fashioned talc, she goddamn refuses to move.
And…..what could Steve say to that, really? His voice was deceptively steady. “I’m… sorry, Clint.”
He stretched his neck from side to side, a yawn of enormous proportions cracking through his jaw. Most of the screens and holograms had powered down, leaving behind a quiet that took the creaking of the creeper under his weight and the clink of his spanner as it hit the drawer and returned them back in echoes. Most of the downlights were still on – powerful beams that lit up the workshop in sharp, symmetrical lines, shadows in between.
that didn’t have the faintest idea about heroics for a group of heroes that didn’t care enough to
“Hey.” Steve strokes his fingers over the burnished bark. “I’m back.”
There are just too many of them. White dots, multi-coloured dots, drowning in the expanse of a gigantic black sky.
The water sloshed against his calves as he moved, mud and grime sticking under the grooves of the armour plates as they flexed and released. Rice stalks squelched under his heel, even as he tread past that leather-clad shoulder, eyes affixed straight ahead. Stride and stride and stride, unfeeling of the water that trickled steadily into the seams of his chestplate, ran past the unyielding metal jaw, left tracks down the glass of his reactor casing.
“If you’re awake enough to say geriatric, you’re awake enough to pick your suit jacket off the floor.” Contrary to the words, Tony could feel someone nose into the soft crook between his neck and jaw - he tilted his head into it obligingly, soft wisps of hair brushing his cheek. The next words were quieter, gently winding into the shell of his ear. “You know I’d do it myself, if you’d trust me around your clothes.”
Steve didn’t……if there had been any specific moment that Steve could pinpoint, where the lead in his gut solidified to cold, hard regret- it would be this. He spoke on- because that’s what he did, pushed on no matter what, but he didn’t recognise the sound of his voice. “Vision.”
The hold shifted from Steve’s neck to the back of shoulders that were almost insensate, another arm cupping around his waist – till Tony had hauled him right up, and pressed him close, dark hair brushing over the tip of Steve’s nose. His voice in Steve’s ear was barely above a whisper, barely a question. Maybe it wasn’t even meant for him. “Why.”
ago. Add to that the fact that no one read that fast, and Tony had been the MIT Bar Bros’ (which was decidedly
Which was where they were now, maybe – there were mats under their feet and the training equipment around them looked halfway familiar; somewhere in between what had been in the SHIELD barracks and the Avengers facility gym. On the wall behind, off to the corner of his vision: the edge of a logo set into the plaster gleamed metallic under the afternoon light.
, he wasn’t a heathen. All ticket proceeds to high school art programs… ooh, maybe a competition? Children under 16 submit a design for what the next Mark should look like, god he should call Pepper– no he shouldn’t, terrible idea
Sam smiled tiredly. “Doesn’t matter. It doesn’t change things if I know now, and it wouldn’t have changed things had I known anything back then.”
Steve lifted his chin, and stared at Tony’s face, frozen inches away from his.
Looking at a world he had no place in had never felt this…satisfying, though. Like Steve would be content to watch all his life.
He usually tried not to fly in the rain – friction wasn’t a concern like with cars on the road and the suit was waterproof, but he called it a preference and left it at that. If past, not-quite-related experiences moulded his preferences, it was none of his concern. Half the joy of flying was in the view anyhow and the rain smeared that; fog oftentimes thickening the wet air several miles above ground, shutting out the sun and stars. The wind that playfully batted against his shoulders while he sliced through the atmosphere turned demonic, gale-like force strong enough to sometimes twist him awry from his course. The world grew greyer, darker – everything running in on itself to turn into a sopping, indistinguishable mass of water and nothingness.
“You could’ve broken your neck.” Tony’s voice was more expressionless than it had any right to be.
you guys enough?”
“Look at this.” Steve shoved the phone screen under Tony’s nose, which had a bit of an aquiline thing going on but still wasn’t any more qualified to be in intimate contact with an Apple product. Yeurgh. “It’s a game.”
“Hm, you’re right.” Tony tapped a finger on his bristled chin-had Steve always found beards attractive? Was this a recent development? It sounded probable, except now Steve found it hard to imagine a state of mind where he didn’t find stupid ass, sculpted, louche like facial hair one of the most irresistible things in the world. “I teach the classes at Coburg on Thursdays.”
“You came.” Two words breathed out, like they were obvious and world-changing, all at one go. “Not because you’d stopped believing in the Accords, but because you…momentarily disagreed.”
“-eventy seven degrees outside, with no rain expected. I have taken the liberty to cancel your ten o’clock, as it is now ten-thirty, and your 12 o’clock as it was with Amazon.”
to question your judgement.”
“I wouldn’t take it personally.” Tom’s lips twisted, humour tainted by the words.
your type.” Peter looked straight back at him, sincere and honest and true, not denying a single word, and Tony tried to not let his throat clog. “So I make things for you. Armour, better shooters. Hell, a sexier mask. I keep you
Long, deep, full breaths. The sun was in his eyes, bright and smarting. His chest didn’t hurt.
“5:43 am.” FRIDAY murmured, quietly. “It’s March the twelfth, two thousand and seventeen. You’re in the new Avengers facility. Good morning, boss.”
Well then.
“-and I already have an internship. Signed an agreement and everything.”
“Me neither, darling.” The words sounded thick in her throat, but Peggy wasn’t crying. She leaned forward, cupped her warm palms over his whitening fingers, “Always.”
“Hrm?” Tony shifted on his creeper stool, tailbone twinging with the motion. The legless torso of the Mark XLVI was suspended at his eye level, cable entrails dangling to the floor.
The first book in general Clint had heard in its entirety was Crime and Punishment, in the original Russian. It was a bit of a jolt, the very first time-he was unused to foreign voices in his space, let alone his safehouse, and equally unused to KGB agents camped out in the sole armchair in said safehouse, for all that she was apparently a traitor to her kind. She’d moved the chair, set it in the corner of the room with the most light and murmured the lines out loud, the language spilling out of her lips not quite harsh, not quite lyrical. It was the first time he’d seen Natasha Romanov uncurl from within Natalia Alianovna Romanova-in the shape of words spelt out in an unfamiliar lilt, almost dutiful in its pronunciation- she said she wanted to keep her accent sharp.
“Why do I have to–”
“Besides,” Ross continued, eyes sharpened. “Didn’t you
“You should.”
“Rules serve men Rogers, not the other way round.” Tony smiled again, and it was mirthless; but at least it was still there. “While we should probably hammer out the details at some point- you’re still a fugitive and I’m still the government’s poster boy. Better get going. Pretty Nature won’t keep out the blood-sucking fiends, a la journalists forever.”
One beat. Two. Sam didn’t avert his gaze. “How did we get there?”
He had to unlatch his gauntlet- powered down as it was, it would only mess with his grip. The shield was cold to the touch- burning, almost. Poisonous. Scalding the flesh of the unworthy.
One year, one year one yearoneyearone –
of traits.”
“I promise.” He said, and it was hard, but he did. He trusted the Avengers; and if Tony said that a situation didn’t need his involvement- well. He said he needed Tony to keep him on the straight, and for once in his life, he wasn’t going to be a hypocrite.
“Steve.” Something hit Steve’s cracked lips, tingling there – if he flicked his tongue out, he might taste water and salt. “You can’t give up like this.”
A kid was screaming at his brother, in the restaurant outside. The sounds filtered through the walls, and Steve still hadn’t dropped his vague shadow of a smile. “You like strategy.”
Tony could recall some choice, singularly brilliant rants against Queens- emitted by yours truly on better days. He could compose a soliloquy on the grand opulence of Manhattan verse the shabby…..shabbiness of Queens (see? Even his tremendously creative masterpiece of a mind was stumped when it came to describing the blandness of Queens).
And her long fingers cover the reactor, and it’s only when she drops her gaze to it that Tony realises how long she’d been looking at him, just him. “Like a star.” Steph breathes, almost in wonder.
was what Steve always looked like? “Thoughts of what, dying babies?”
“In the wake of SHIELD and Hydra being lambasted openly in the public, there was a clear and obvious shortage of funds.” A small thread of what sounded like exhaustion snuck into Ross’ words. “Congress, or indeed any other nation’s government, could not continue giving money to SHIELD, not while its reputation was still so tainted-state budgets tend to be public things. An intelligence gathering organisation like SHIELD needs its resources: money for bases, weaponry, tech. Helicarriers aren’t built out of goodwill. Fortunately, companies like OsCorp have been much freer with their trusts and purses.”
“See you in a minute,” Steve whispers, and disappears.
Anyways……excitement. Yeah. Not something to be found in great abundance in Steve’s life nowadays, for someone who was technically an ex-superhero. Being on the run wasn’t very conducive to most life pursuits, forget ones involving any actual action. Things would have been so much more convenient if he had a secret identity.
DUM-E rolled back, and bumped into Tony’s ankle again. More rapid motions. A light exhale of air hissed past Tony’s teeth- he was surprised to find that it was amusement. Or maybe affection was a closer fit. “Want me to stay here, huh. Okay.”
Natasha helped, with that sort of thing. For someone who slipped skins on and off so easily- she was more aware than most, of the….things, about a person, that didn’t change. Never changed. Immutable. That a person couldn’t simply will themselves to perfection, no matter how desperately hard they tried. Letting the monster breathe, she called it. Said if you sealed it up too tight, cracks would appear on the surface- and it would come bursting out, wild and desperate and ugly, imploding at the worst of moments.
His eyes moved from the roof to the other source of light in the room, though barely that. It was a line of white, peeking out from between a cemented sill and musty, dark drapes. A window, then.
He knocked.
“I’m coming to the Japanese part of the exhibit now.” Steve fished out the phone from his jeans pocket, business end of the earphones plugged into the top. Tapped at the little rectangle, with the tiny red circle on his homescreen that he learned meant camera after six weeks of unmotivated fiddling. The Japanese ceremonial helmet that he’d paused in front of zoomed up on his screen. Steve waited for it to focus.
That, and the ridiculously neat handwriting on the page announces that it’s the doing of the only other museum artefact residing in this Tower. Tony takes a glance down at the words, reads
“What should be mathematically impossible?”
“It’s there, both of us sitting on the middle bar of the A like a park bench, that he tells me, ‘I think I wanna marry MJ’.” The good-natured laughter so far quietened down; everyone’s gaze redirected to the couple in question – but Peter and MJ were looking at him, soft-eyed and perfect.
Not acrylic or oils, heavily wielded – but something softer, like swathes of water colour splashed across the canvas of the heavens. That strange shade that dwelt between pastel pinks and blues, freely flowing from one to the other – the colour of daybreak, fresh and clean.
, his mind sneered back- god, what was he even
raised his eyes, and turned to fix those dark irises on Steve. It was like a physical blow, and Steve barely kept himself from flinching- if there hadn’t been a trickle of triumph at the fact that Tony was finally facing him.
“Full time access to the common areas of the Avengers facility wasn’t so you could play peekaboo.” Tony was rapidly remembering why he’d given the finger to government-sanctioned assholes not too many years ago-they were assholes. Secretary of State or not, Ross and his unimpressed eyebrow could go screw themselves, however that was anatomically possible. “Be an ass on Halloween like everyone else.”
“Tony.” His tone wasn’t cheery – Tony wasn’t a miracle worker – but the irrepressible fondness in Steve’s voice, etching out Peggy’s image from picture-perfect memory, had remained. Strange. “You’re smarter than you give yourself credit for.”
“Nothing’s changed.” And Steve watched on as Tony turned his back to walk away, everything done and over with, all the anguish and turmoil that Steve had been bearing on his shoulders for the past months completely futile.
Only to be greeted by a completely unexpected voice. “You look well.”
They moved onward. The room opened up-it was definitely a room now, made clear by the brush of moving air against his prickly skin and the dance of ghostly lights over walls and ceilings as Iron Man moved this way and that. Sam raised a finger to tap over his visor-it wasn’t night vision per se, but the basic infrared sensors indicated the lack of anything remotely living within a mile of this point. Which was absolutely no reason to relax one’s guard, warrens like these messed with sensors more than anything else.
…or maybe not. Sam burst out in cackles again over ‘octopus’, Steve sullenly glaring at a two-hundred-year-old Japanese artefact decorated by waving tentacles all the while. Several faint wheezes later- “remember to Google hentai at some point.”
“We might reach earlier than expected.” Sam let out as gently as he could, and Steve drew in a breath and didn’t release it. The last streaks of a dying sun were shooting over the horizon, making his eyes gleam glass-pale and brittle.
Tony completed inside his head, and stopped his thoughts right there. Respect for the dead, and all that.
He didn’t need to say the rest out loud. Tony stared back all too comprehending, something close to horror shading his thoughts and eyes.
(And for all of that, Sam still knew better than anyone the importance of-sometimes-keeping yourself deceived.)
century India (
“Fine, I misplaced my cufflinks,
“I think I would just cut the wire.” Tony says, and she flares up in response, igneous to the core.
The repulsor powered down with a whine, and Steve blinked and blinked again, taking in the stunned silence. Bucky’s face was as blank as it had ever been, but there was the beginning of something waking in his eyes; the dull, disbelieving shock of a man whose execution order had been incomprehensibly, impossibly stayed. Memory Steve could barely keep the awful gratitude off his face, trying and failing not to sound relieved beyond all measure as he asked- “What was…why did you-”
Steve had left the shield. He’d given Tony the Avengers. That’s what he’d written in the letter. Hadn’t he? Hadn’t he?
Minutes crawled by in silence. Three waves had crashed into the shore, and ebbed back out, before he found the voice to speak again.
The happiness was still surging, strong and sure; so much that it barely registered a blip when barely forty eight hours after they’d crawled out of Siberia alive, Bucky told him that he wanted to be put back in ice.
This has never happened before. Steve has no memories to compare it with, and catalogues every detail to add to a rolodex of sensations, for safekeeping; Tony’s eyelashes fluttering against Steve’s skin, the way the callus on his thumb digs into Steve’s chin when he’s holding it steady, the soft skin in the crevices between his fingers as their hands wound tighter together, the happiness of an impossible moment.
Before he could do more than twitch though, Clint had already begun- sharp yet resigned. “What do you want me to say, Cap? I miss my wife. I miss my kids.” The eyes swivelled away, tracing some unseen path through the undergrowth. His lips curled briefly to the side. “I miss my bloody best friend who’s apparently forgotten
Tony stared at his best friend’s face, and wondered why the thought left him joyless and hollow.
It’s always been the shade that caught his eye the quickest.
“I think,” and Tony stretched his hand out, watching it shake almost imperceptibly. Watched Steve catch it in his own trembling palm, fingers snaking through the gaps and pressing the tremors into their knuckles. Hands clenched tight, heartlines aligned. “this isn’t how it happens.”
he say? All the words were jumping up and down and falling all over themselves, utterly inadequate. Sorry- but he’d said that in the letter already, and it solved nothing. How is Rhodey doing?- but that would probably burn worse than a half-baked apology. I wish I could do everything over- but wishes weren’t horses, and the things he’d already
Two seconds-enough to categorise heat and smell and touch (not taste. Not yet.) Steve whispered against Tony’s mouth, feeling the breaths rise and fall in tandem. “Don’t have to teach me everything.”

Except Steve wasn’t stupid and they probably weren’t, were they – courtesy of a certain Wakandan royal. The man had probably spilled the beans the second he was out of the UN meeting; the Last American Hero and his buds were ensconced right in his backyard, after all. Wakanda: home of the tech-savvy and asylum for the vigilante.
This wasn’t helping.
A beat. “I went as a friend.” Stark said, something ineffably hopeless about those words. “I did.”
It felt like the best day of his life.
For all of the different versions though- there was never one in which Tony Stark didn’t come to Siberia. Didn’t go behind the back of the very authorities he was trying to support, because he’d made a mistake and needed to fly to the aid of a friend. Apparently, that version was too unrealistic (
Steve’s lips flickered. “But–”
“I think,” Natasha began slowly. Clint raised his head, and she was mirroring the little upturn to his lips. “The word people use here is ‘preach’.”
that it would only lead to me blowing your friend’s fucking head off-“
Rhodey shrugged, shoulders rising up and falling unassumingly. “Good motivation for all of us.”
There had never been a better moment to change that.
“Where I’d want to be buried?” She summarises bluntly. It’s like a wound getting cauterised – relief and pain making everything insensate.
He jerked awake, the satin sheets sliding against the cold night sweat that soaked his limbs, lips parted in a silent scream. Sleep mocked him gleefully, beckoning him into its mindless embrace and then shoving him out, terror ringing in his ears and hands scrabbling down his chest to feel warm skin instead of cold meta-
“I think it has.” And Steve’s voice wasn’t as steady as it should have been, but he couldn’t care less for that. “Would
…and just like that, his heart rate skyrocketed, the poor organ slamming into his ribcage so hard that Steve couldn’t breathe. He turned, slowly.
The air was far less musty in the passageway than he’d expected-there were probably built in ducts, for better circulation. The blast had caused the barrier heap of sand to blow inwards, plastered to the wall and crunching under their feet, but far less in volume than expected, probably as the ceiling had already begun and there was only so much sand that could occupy a space. A space that terminated in a door, as it turned out-also helpfully taken out by the blast. The corridor stretched on ahead, blanketed black and seemingly endless.
“I was here.” Natasha said. Voice steady, ever constant. “Three weeks. I was here.”
Tony smiled back, sharp and cordial. “Trying to endear yourself by projecting a sense of humour? I’m petty as shit though; I’ll just yell trademark infringement.”
trust.”
A few seconds of silence. Sam spluttered out laughing, the line twanging in feedback.
“No.” Natasha said simply, and the press of her hand against his was not a lie. Reddened as they were, her eyes still looked peaceful. “It was nice. Like a warmth in my chest, of… getting to throw aside all that my life had been used for, and choosing what it was going to mean.”
of Clint’s motions- and Steve was intensely grateful to that.
He finally looks up. Steph looks more desperately, obstinately uncomfortable than all ‘Star-Spangled Man’ reels put together. It helps him speak.
The Avengers logo blazed on the wall behind her head, the corner of the A obscured by her curls. It felt, for a second, that his knees might give way after all.
Tony breathed, freer than he used to. Sometimes, the absence of the arc, that heavy weight, still stunned him. “If remembering the bad means I can keep the better – I’m okay with that trade.”
in reality: for someone was going to do it in the future, foe or friend, and they wouldn’t be half as considerate about it.
Tony doesn’t think back to the instant he fell in love. Not merely because it was no single instant, but… after the ceaseless march of years and decades and what seems like entire ages, it almost feels unimportant.
“How’s Colonel Rhodes?”
“Morning FRIDAY.” He stretched his arms along the sides of the bed, rustling through the silk sheets. His toes uncurled, brushing against the fluffy down of the comforter that he’d thrown off his body sometime during the night. Everything was deceptively comfortable.
“But one woman-” Steph clears her throat, and seems to forge ahead with a determined air verging on desperate. “-loved the pilgrim soul in you. And loved the sorrows of your changing face.”
It wasn’t judgmental, but Clint let his voice sharpen a little anyway. “Let me decide that.”

.” The word sharpened imperceptibly. “That tells themselves emotion had nothing to do with it, are lying.”
John Oliver couldn’t seem to contain his glee.
But he was so attuned to Tony’s response, and there was a pause which stretched on too long- and a lack of steadiness there too. “He-“ Tony started, and then grew louder, more out of defensiveness than truth. “He can’t be held captive, and he can’t be allowed to roam the streets. He’s too dangerous.”
Steve pulled his feet out of the sand, watching the grains slowly trickle down the back of his ankles. “I’d always wanted to study art, or maybe history. Never completed college.”
Tony breathed, long and quiet. “I’m listening.”
Measured footsteps followed in his trail as he stalked across the living area, heading towards the kitchenette. Once the refrigerator was opened and water bottle withdrawn, the urge to rest his brow against the cool surface of the door was overpowering-Tony resisted the urge, and kept off the scowl threatening to overtake his face with supreme effort. He had a
The thought had barely passed his mind before Tony’s jaw inadvertently began to crack open in a yawn- hell, this was going to be a bad one. Cold air rushed in against a dried, tacky tongue as his jawbones seemed to drop inhumanly wide-
It was incomprehensible, Steve thought, eyes flickering from head to toe of the statue, to think of the hands that had shaped this, that had mimicked delicate folds of silk and brocade in cold metal. The intricacies of the necklace that hung heavy on that neck, the anklets that curved around delicate feet. The expression. So peaceful, so benign. A smooth wide forehead, high, arching brows shaped like the bend of a bow. Thick lips pulled into the gentlest of curves, closed eyelids looking within. The statue had many heads: one facing forward, one back, one each on the right and left. There was a towering headdress made of more heads yet, looking to all four directions, each terraced layer growing smaller and smaller but with the same peaceful expression on his face.
“I do know. It isn’t my fault, won’t ever be my fault, I couldn’t take responsibility for it if I tried.”
except that ran itself out before it even fully started, sputtered out to death under the onslaught of the rain.
“That’s not what I–
“I’m fine.” Tony growled, sprained toes be damned, and
“I’m sure you have.” Sam muttered. Then, a little louder, “Don’t worry about it, I’ll hang around.” Sound faded, with just the line crackling intermittently.
And there was something quiet and childish and wheedling about the next words too, though not spoken out loud.
“Thought.” The next words were unbearably hard to get out, the burn flickering at the hollow of his throat. Steve struggled through it, single-minded, like every asthma attack, every bully’s fist, every bullet and hit that had ever threatened to keep him down and never succeeded. “Thought tha… that was a… fella’s name.”
“…not quite.” Tony threw back, with a lightness of tone so forced that it even disappointed him. Hell, he needed sleep.
Steve gave him a minute nod, and lifted his chin, jaw firming up. Sam’s wings unfolded to their fullest span, and he pulled in a breath. Seconds later, the ground had shifted away from his feet and he was careering away-cutting through shear and the blast of wind in his ears, following the scarlet trail.
There were lines of brown-green pots: Chinese cooking vessels, the placard said, from the tenth century. Round bellied with short, engraved legs, bronze polish turned sage green by the corrosion of the centuries. He moved towards the closest one. The roughened, imperfect surface had small ridges-rectangular lines spiralling inwards and simultaneously spanning the girth of the vessel, like a maze.
“It’s like… a call to arms, for lovers.
Then Tony turned, swivelling on his heels, moving over to the other end. Steve’s heart crashed into his sternum, fingers folding tight over the card, stiff edges crinkling in his palm. It was warm too, and slightly sticky. Like something phantom still lingering on its surface.

wants. And damned be the person who got in between. So when you came down to it, I was–am,” Steve corrected, unamusedly scrupulous, eyes distant on the high heavens. “Selfish. For a given value of selfishness.”
“Forty two to forty five. Right during your rise to prominence, actually.” Tom smiled again, tiredness creeping over the expression. “We were legally a British possession till forty nine, only established independence from Australia in seventy five. We still have close ties to them, though.” And the smile waned again. “Largest aid donor to the country.”
The words were coming slowly, shaped by Tony’s inadequate voice with as much significance, as much unadulterated earnestness as they deserved. “He says, ‘We share things in common, but… it’s more that it already feels like we’re a team, me and her. We don’t always get each other, but we listen. We always listen. We have our fights, but we try to communicate
Hands all wiped clean, Steve crumpled the soggy paper into a small ball. Paused for a second, then dabbed the soapy tap head spotless too. Tony sighed. “For fuck’s sake Cap, if you care so much about your bathroom routine, you can’t be entirely indifferent to your terrible dynamics with a teammate. We just saved the world, numero tres, for heaven’s sake.”
it didn’t sound physical, as much as Tony strained to jump to the worst conclusions. It sounded…wistful. Pained.
Tom hadn’t stopped looking at him, gaze keen and acute. And…sombre, in the strangest way. “The army won’t…ask for permission. Whoever you…they’ll be safe. Don’t worry.”
fool himself again, “Cut that, that was definitely irresponsible of me. But I trusted you to make your own choices, and you’re almost as strong as the fucking
“Right.” Sam’s words were as buoyant as ever. There was still something churning in Steve’s gut though, deep and unsettling- like once it started, it wasn’t stopping easily.
Feeling around for his 14 mm spanner, Tony registered a rustle of static like a sigh. “I will poke you in thirty minutes.”
A split-second of silence. When Iron Man’s voice came, it was interrupted by bursts of static; like the voice behind the emotionless recording was panting harshly.
” Tony resisted the urge to groan, or facepalm when he was wearing a metal suit of armour. Which Steve was Not Wearing. How hard was that to grasp? “And now I hath taken the Lord’s name in vain. I’ve not missed being on a team with you.”
Steve screwed his eyes shut as the remembrances flitted by- the last burst of warmth he’d felt towards Tony Stark, watching that MIT presentation video (not quite right, there had been that aborted gush when he’d realised those were
Cold all the way through the marrow, even as he pinned that agitated blue gaze. “Then why are you telling me this?”
What did come, after several seconds of drawn out silence was a faint chuckle. His eyelids fluttered open despite themselves, and he watched another Tony Stark crouching in the shadowed corner, clad in the same sweats and a different tank top, regarding the scene before him. Hollows beneath his eyes even darker than before, if that was even possible, mouth twisted into some bitter slash of amusement and….deprecation was too light a word. It was like that same dark flicker in his eye when he’d been talking about that youth perishing in Sokovia-
Tony’s features twisted into a disbelieving scowl, and Steve had to resist the urge to throw his hands up into the air. “Governments have agendas, we’ve been over this before-“
But as Tony walked away, shoulders pulled back straight, the night coming alive with its myriad sounds in the trees and grass around them- Steve let himself feel a smidgen of hope anyway.
Steve twisted his head, meeting Tom’s eyes easily. They were lined several times over, an abundant smattering of spots on the eyelids. Crow’s feet.
He was…he was almost surprised, at how easy it had been to forget, about the existence of those things. But Steve hadn’t been fighting with a clear head. His mind had been flooded by a deluge of panic and fear and guilt and
Memory-Tony stopped halfway from getting into his car. “Yeah Cap?”
“See, you say that,” Tony began, light and unconcerned, the last couple of minutes not unforgotten but…laid to rest for now, perhaps. “but I have this sneaking suspicion that Carol’s off gallivanting on Xandar at this very moment, yes?”
“Well fuck the Director then,” the response rose to Tony’s lips all too naturally. “The Director can pay for my expensive back surgery. And my chiropractor.”
of getting to hear their voices, see their faces, unblemished, every day.
Because this wasn’t entirely a comfortable silence. Heck, it shouldn’t have been a silence at all; Clint should have been snarking and tossing out ridiculous jokes for Wanda to mock, leaving Steve to fill in the gaps with dry comments interspersed with concerned questions. But here Clint crouched by the stream with a very, very obvious shadow under his eyes, Wanda was out of sight and Steve…..couldn’t quite bring himself to ask how they were doing.
“D’you need me to say more? ‘Cause I think I might’ve just given myself an ulcer with the deep and penetrating wisdom.”
Tony hitched himself onward, mental map tracing a route to the main workshop via the underbellies of his cars. The Bentley he crawled under shook above him – the front wheel in his vision tilting slowly to the right as if the entire car was being… oh shit.
. He thought, and laughed soundlessly at his own joke.
“Thirty minutes not done yet?” He called out, part wry and part hoarse with dehydration.
Notes: there are some topics raised in this chapter that are potentially sensitive, and neither the characters I write, nor I claim to be the best people to write about them, but we're doing our best. Do contact me if you think I could have handled something better, but I'm also making no apologies for what's up. Factual details therein have been researched, tell me if I got any of those wrong.
Tony stared at that face, the straight jaw and honest eyes- he should have closed this recording off ages ago. Maybe the point was wrecking a good memory he didn’t even remember he had, watch for himself what a concerned, blinded idiot he had been-
“What,” Steve asks – turned morbid by the laughter and press of people around him. Fifty percent. It never happened here. “What about you?”
Except- that….that was a lie. Because there was a red and gold gauntleted hand, palm open, not five inches away from Bucky’s face. Screen Steve was too far away, the white noise was mounting to a screaming climax, the laptop was beginning to dent a little under his tightened grip, but nothing,
taped across his wall, which-he knows what she’s doing here, brook and water and…this is actually incredibly lame and a little creepy considering she snuck into the place he likes to trim his nose hair in, and definitely shouldn’t make him snicker like the way it does. He washes up and lopes into the kitchen for his coffee, only to find
Sam appeared oblivious to that though. Or maybe he was pretending. He was kind like that, sometimes. “Besides, not like I’ve missed any kid birthdays lately.”
Sam’s lips curved to the side, quick and reflexive, almost deprecating. “T minus thirty.”
It would have been convenient, for some sort of snarky commentary to float past Tony’s head right now, but his mind was blank. Steve breathed again, soft and so very careful. “I made it up to my navel, the last time.”
His stale tongue scraped against the top of his palate; yeah, maybe giving the coffee a rest would be a good idea at this point. Did coffee dehydrate you, or was it one of those modern myth thingys? He…he seemed to remember Pepper saying that coffee was dehydrating…or was that diuretic? No, weren’t those opposite things? Hell, Pep would probably say that coffee contained belladonna if it got him to stop treating it as his entire diet…ah, anyway. It wasn’t important, now.
“She did have family,” Clint says, almost as an aside. “Sisters, a few others.”
(He didn’t know if he hated or feared To- Stark’s ability to push him this way, push and push and push, till the very concept of lines had been erased from one’s head and gravity was reversed and he could never know if he was being propelled to heights he’d never imagined before or falling to depths that he’d never comprehended.
That….didn’t make much sense. Unless…..and it was a bad topic, but the word scraped out all the same, “..Tony?”
to move her eyes from Tony’s face, which is a complication because he can feel the heat building up in his face like fucking magma before an impending volcanic eruption-and fuck his mind and his bloody scientific metaphors, this is how he got here in the first place. Being swept off his feet by poetry from bloody
Sky-blue tee, beige chinos. No shield. Steve emerged from his uninspiring position of cover, jogging over to Tony with a face that brightened as it got closer.
, never came. “It’s one of the pitfalls of being a larger-than-life hero: no one notices your big brain.” Rhodey murmured back, and Tony’s next exhale was more delighted laugh than anything else. God, just.
“You should pick that up.”
“So he let us go.” Clint said, flatly. “Doesn’t change the fact that we shouldn’t have been there in the first place. In fact,” And there was a step forward here, Clint’s shoulders straightening and pulling back, eyes as flashing and condemnatory as they’d ever been. “There were a great many things that happened that
Tony smiled, quick and uncaring. Pain was beginning to reassert its existence in his muscles, not content with being ignored for too long. “You could have just called.”
His voice was climbing in amplitude. He knew it, and could do nothing about it. “She never intended to-”
Steve didn’t know how long he stood there, hopelessly caught by dark, flashing eyes and joyous laughter-till the outbreak of applause startled him out. The song had drawn to a close, and two of them were, dear god…Tony and Rhodes were standing a metre apart, face to face, legs together and backs military straight, saluting each other. The sound of his own laugh, small and helpless, caught Steve by surprise-oh god this was…this actually made him empathise with those hordes of girls on campus squealing their hearts out over one thing or another…it was all just so ridiculously
“What do you think we’re here to talk about, Captain?”
Steve didn’t need to watch the recording any further, to know what was to come. It took a surprisingly long time though, silence dragging on and on as Tony raised his eyes from the screen to meet Steve’s, visibly struggling to keep control. The scene splintered.
Another shift, sheets rustling quietly; Steve had moved up to sit behind him now. “Is that what you feel? Or what you think you should?”
It had never hit him, before this moment – staring into a glowing, blue emptiness, and finding it staring back.
Or had the king secured some kind of peace that Tony had never even dreamed was possible?
The breath stopped still in his chest for a second, refusing to move onward. Steve didn’t blink, bile burning in the base of his throat. “That’s…not the same thing.”
And that built frame sidestepped him and walked away, door swinging open and shut behind Tony’s back not seconds later. Tony stood still, hands flexing inwards and out, trying to absently figure if the emotion curling through his gut was regret.
Tony regards him, hum falling silent. There’s a dam there, in those eyes, holding back a wave of slowly stirring anger and injury that Steve fully intends to weather – but is leashed now, for some reason.
Clint is sleeping, mouth open on the couch-even though Tony is half tempted to toss an apple or something at his head, to see if he catches it mid snore. Thor is looking incredibly bored, mostly because he’s the one who’d started the topic in the first place by praising some or the other epic a
, he thinks, because it’s a building stone and she’s Captain America. And if you can’t believe Captain America when she tells you you’re like every other piece of scrap iron on the street, who can you?
“Wasn’t aware that Norman Osborn was a superhero.” Oh. Oh god. He hadn’t just said that.
, alright? And besides, it isn’t even happening.” The phone stopped buzzing. He folded his arms across his chest. “So there.”
those kind of colours back…
So no. Not a surprise at all. The ceased motion, or the rapid turn. Sam couldn’t see the thin smile Stark was sporting in the darkness, but it made its presence known. “I do.”
Steve blinked, and blinked again; it felt like he’d fallen asleep on his moving feet and drifted off into a dream. Could the serum do that? It was designed to keep him going regardless of the shape he was in-could it detect that his mind had waved a white flag and thus sent it off to bed? Because this…this was…
“I don’t know, maybe it’s the constant disappointment.” Tony shot back, more vicious than anything else, common sense thrown all to hell. Fuck, he was just so
“Seems a little hypocritical, I know.” There was a rueful twist to Tom’s mouth, his large hands coming up to settle peacefully against his thighs. “But when people aren’t fighting over our lands, or building prisons on them…the biggest challenge we face is the rising waters. The warming airs, the melting ice and higher waves. Five islands have been lost to the Pacific, so far.” The words that followed were serious, somehow like only a joke could be. “His suit may be shiny, but he revolutionised clean energy. And I appreciated that.”
Steve’s brows creased, endearing topped with delightful. “Pardon?”
Clint breathed in deeply. The shadows were lengthening across the countertop, the sun sinking lower. They’d all be getting in soon, light pattering feet and quiet giggles, petering off the second they saw the two shades seated on both sides of the kitchen.
Tony was expecting something a little cocky in return,
Tight and tight, more than a man could bear. “Thanks Tony.”
“You know me Rogers, forever the contrarian.” The flippancy, the distracting jovial tone was all there, all the requisite ingredients, but there was still something off. Tony’s voice was stiff, like an actor repeating his memorised lines for a play with none of the conviction, none of the belief. Stiff, and unconvincing. “Figured, if a supervillain wanted you to do something really, really badly, it only made sense not to do it, right?”
“But you still have his base codes.” It wasn’t a question.
Oh, but it was far more nuanced than that. In moments, that yawned long and crushingly heavy, the future seemed nothing more than a wasteland. And yet, here was a friend grinning at him from across the ring, and his breath shivered in his chest with the realisation, a truth sitting in his chest too simple to ignore – “I’ve got more than that.”
The sound of a repulsor charging hummed through the air-Sam could feel the hair on his arms prick up, goosebumps breaking over chilled skin. A quiet, focused blast-the colour of gold sand and concrete walls flashing in the sudden burst of light-and then everything faded back to silver and shadow again. Leaving behind a gaping maw of blackness that led below ground.
“People from…outside find it a little difficult to pronounce our names. So I stick to something easy.” A small pause. “You’re a paranoid man, Captain Rogers.”
she’d told him once.
Tony Stark had no agendas here. He just wanted to sleep.
? And Hawkeye was like
…how did he know it was tin? There was another sound blanketing the ambience, a faint
“A, a little bit.” His right hand was still clawed into the icy ground, where the shield had fallen away. His face was numb. “You won’t be able to spot me, though. Not even with the hot rod red. The lights are dead.”
The world was falling away, breaths slowing and heart drifting to a stop, and it felt nothing like the ice.
“Well then.” Natasha tilted her head one last time, light gleaming off the devastating line of her jaw, eyes teasing like he’d remember her best. “What’re you waiting for?”
Steve dropped his gaze to the dancers, head ringing. They were feisty, energetic; every vigorous jerk of their heads set free a shower of sweat droplets. The stage was fairly vibrating under the force of their tapping feet, he could feel the tremors pass into the concrete under him, though he was fairly certain no one else could. Broad smiles, on each and every face, except….
And just like that, Steve couldn’t breathe.
“Four hundred and seventeen if you want to count today – but yep.” Rhodey’s eyes were still fixated on his precious baby designs, but there was something softly pleased about that tone nonetheless. “The closest we came to a code green was when some space surfer dudes slipped past the Guardians – the Avengers were ready and waiting topside, but SHIELD Helicarriers showed up outta nowhere and shot them out of the sky before they could even make planetfall.”
He didn’t have a broken collar bone; else he would be in agony right now. Steve moved his head to the side, inch by inch, and looked up at his caretaker.
Steve, watching, hoping, praying- still felt his stomach twist with unease. He’d known this was coming, anticipated it five recordings in, from the time this had started so many months ago. Still- strangely,
“And you should shut your gob.” Steve threw back, and hailed the bartender for another beer. They were both in dark sunglasses and baseball caps, naturally- well, Steve had been, and Sam had forewent the cap, and Steve had plopped one on his head with Sam grumbling all the way about Steve apparently buying out Target’s entire stock (he wouldn’t be entirely wrong).
But of course Sam voiced nothing out loud, and Steve’s pale eyes dropped further, searching for a thing that couldn’t be found on the cockpit floor. The thin line his lips had compressed themselves into curved up in the facsimile of a smile. “Bypassed straight into voicemail, left a message. Which I guess still technically meets the terms of our agreement.”
(Except…well. Didn’t men always doubt their faith?)
The air pumped through his chest, hard and heavy, throat dry with gasping. His hands were braced on his thighs, view obscured to the gap between them – sweat-slick fringe whipping in his eyes when he bent over and tried to regain his breath.
Tony and Pepper were dancing cheek-to-cheek. His eyes were closed, cloaking those dark irises peacefully; even as they swerved from one side to the next, feet barely shifting. The song was coming to a close.
Rhodes was ducking under Tony’s elbow now, hand raised to his brows, looking hither and thither in exaggerated ‘I can’t find you’ motions. Tony stood at his back, back of his hand pressed to his forehead in parodied distress. The other couples had pulled back to the periphery, clapping and cheering, the blonde with the purple lined waistcoat catcalling the loudest. Tony and Rhodes turned around together, eyes widening dramatically in ‘there you are!’, stepping back close again. The saxophone piped high, drums flourishing in not too far behind, and Tony jigged his butt to the beat; Rhodes covering his face with a hand, forehead sinking to his friend’s shoulder, overcome with laughter.
“So the offer’s rescinded?” Tony asked, still seated and chin raised; eye level half that of Steve’s and still looking him down.
“I don’t know them.” Tom returned simply, eyes falling shut for a second as if to feel the drizzly wind better.
The sky looked like something out of a painting.

Steve matched his gaze, eyes roving against the horizon. There, somewhere between the line where grey sea met grey sky. Something red and gleaming, growing larger.
bottle of water. She walks over to the counter, and actually groans out loud. Because Tony needs that kind of imagery.
“What’s her name.” Steve whispered it on a rasping breath, and Tony’s voice broke off. “Your… daughter. Tell me her name.”
He smiled a little, at the thought. “The Avengers, ladies and gentlemen. So twisted up in guilt that we broke each other.”
“I suppose I got so caught up in the fight for the little guy,” Steve watched the ocean in turmoil, watched his words fleet away after the winds in pursuit. “That I forgot to ask his permission.”
appeared to be the only place nowadays where Tony could feel some fraction of peace.
A tiny, thrown-off pause.
to outstrip it, outwit it.
with helplessness, and his voice had to call out. “Hasn’t it?”
Natasha blinked. “Do not tell me you’ve come here to take up my extremely limited, government-sanctioned time for a
But of course, that was his younger, naïve self- he flushed the dream of heroism somewhere between MIT and Stark Industries. Then Iron Man happened and……well. Maybe the naiveté was a bit more resilient than he’d thought.
Stark blinked at him again. “Al..alright.” And then, like a rush of words falling one over the other, “This whole ‘conviction-in-other-people’ thing you have going on. Very impressive. I can almost understand your rising popularity.”
Onscreen, Tony’s hands were jammed into his pockets, as he waited- frozen in time, for the light to turn green, among a crowd of strangers.
“Hm, I see it. Ten-foot bamboo plants along the walls, windchimes. Get the feng shui goodness goin’, bring down some of the masculine energy of this place.”
Tony’s face stared down, lips clamped down tight like his teeth were biting through the skin on the inside. There were streaks of shining moisture on his cheeks, clear tracks running down the grime. His voice rang like iron. “No. No. Not good enough, Rogers. I don’t accept this, I can’t–”
And Tony broke it, not just because he was Tony fucking Stark. “This doesn’t mean we need to hook up.”
“Alright then.” He drew a breath in, straightened his back. “Tell me.”
“Except you haven’t.”
And just like that, the specs ricocheting off the walls of his head changed; morphing to older, more familiar forms. Tall-ceilinged bedrooms for gods unaccustomed to Midgardian dwellings, a gymnasium built to withstand the workout of people with super strength, a biomechanics lab for the likes of one of the best biologists in the world. A shooting range for a peerless marksman, an obstacle course for a fighter who never lost her balance. An art studio for…
it became almost incomprehensible to think that making a choice wouldn’t be good enough. That
So yeah. He takes his time to get on board with things; maybe it’s the obstinate contrarian in him, maybe it’s the paranoid bastard. Almost all the sore spots in his memory stem from absent wishes: to have been faster off the ground, better.
But then Steve doesn’t meet his eyes, and maybe he knows anyway.)
Tony stared and stared, the injured muscle under his scarred chest dully thudding away. A blankness overtook memory-Tony’s face, all mirth and intimations of closeness wiped from his features in a flat second. It wasn’t even the fact of the words being said- though it was, oh it was. It was also the words in themselves, the way they had been phrased. No introductions, no justifications. No prevarications. No
Steve smiled back, a wondrous little curve of his lips, like it was a reflex utterly out of his control. “And an amazing speech."
Steph’s flush says everything.
Tony hadn’t attended a pool party in…well, he didn’t quite remember. And the time he’d been giving the Avengers a Terrific Tower Tour, he’d averted his eyes from the glint of sunlight on the clear, chlorine-scented waters. He didn’t think anyone had noticed.
on the couch.
It was the softest sound, softer than rain running down a leaf, or silk brushing against human skin. Spider legs, scratching against glass as a critter crawled up a window. He’d emerged into an entirely new world of sound after the serum.
The kind that made him move constantly and without purpose, against restraints that weren’t physical, that made him create noise in silence. Energy pushed inwards, reverbing uselessly, without direction or drive. The kind that made best friends of fear and hope, playing hide and seek in a stoic jaw and unseeing eyes.
But then something made him hold his tongue- and he took a step back in his head, and paused. Put aside what he wanted, for a second- and considered what was on offer. Pepper’s head was tilted slightly to the side, her expression firm but unsmiling- she was proffering a hand of support. Someone who’d pull him out of the bottles if that was what was required, make sure he was eating and sleeping, take care of him.
“Yes. Later.” Steph seems to force out through gritted teeth, even while her eyes seem a little dimmed. Wow. She must have really wanted those damn shakes. Maybe it’s a Depression era thing because they’re obviously going to have to chuck the bagels? She had really insisted on paying for both of them today.
Past, present, future swirls together in his serum-perfect brain, gibbering over two words, a fact so carefully forgotten; his breaths grow shallower and shallower, pain shooting through his chest with every hitch, black-spots-inverse-stars shimmering in his vision–
“Fight, I know. What with all the positive word-of-mouth, the Black Widow’s lessons on
His fingers smoothed the surface unconsciously, patting down the most recent creases. Folding it down and tucking it back into his pocket.
“Couldn’t give less of a fuck.” The reactor light gleamed off the whip-sharp curve of whitened lips. Stark offered up another smile for the gallows. “Do you guys make up scenarios? Imagine ways in which things might have gone, hypothesise?”
but the words were strangely less gloating, and more desperate. “We’ll be there.”
“I wish you wouldn’t.” Tony swung into the comfy leather seat opposite her frankly
, and Thor is glaring at her with his expression the epitome of,
Ah, a girl after Tony’s own heart. And in more ways than one – Bruce’s wan, haunted face loomed in his memory, Harlem and Johannesburg and all the ugliness that came before and after.
Funny, how different the world appeared when he had something to look forward to, small and ephemeral as it was.
Two seconds. Two seconds in which neither of them inched forward, but personal space seemed to shrink anyway, two seconds in which the walls seem to close around them and whisper tales of intimacy, two seconds that were enough for Tony to catch Steve’s gaze slipping to his lips, just once.
Fifteen minutes later- Steve was sitting up on the bed, spine pressed against the headboard, laptop propped on his thighs booting up. His heart was a constant drum in his ears, unending deep thumps like he might be underwater. His fingers were tapping out a restless pattern against the cool grey plastic- he stilled them with conscious effort, and immediately felt like he might scrabble out of his skin. This was…this…damn, he didn’t know. He didn’t know what to expect. He didn’t know if he should expect anything at all.
Tony’s eyebrows climbed. Steve jabbed again.
Except he did live with it, just not at that particular time. Steve cleared his throat, dry to the bone, something like ash lingering at the back of his tongue. “I had to… had to carry on, for five years after. At times, it was harder than the ice.”
(See the end of the chapter for
, raises her head from where it’s been bowed over a sketchbook all this while and says, “Really.”
Tony’s eyebrows had been climbing progressively to his hairline the longer the seconds passed without a reply-once it actually hit the air, his lips turned up into a now-familiar curl of amusement. Oh god oh god, his mouth was doing that because of
(Or maybe Cap is just being an obstinate twit as always, bent on proving her point.)
“Up to par, boss?”
Fuck those aliens.
Well. The similarities had to end somewhere.
And then Tony stepped forward, better to deliver the fatal stroke, even as Rhodey stood there and watched him silently with tightened eyes. Because why leave your best friend in physical pain alone when you could wound him emotionally too? “You though. Pepper. Howard.” Tony smiled, icing on a poisonous cake. “Steve. You wagged your fingers at me, and I felt better. Because it had to mean that you thought I could do better, right? That I was capable of better.”
The memory began to dissolve away. Before all its components could be stripped away, the green grass, the tall building housing a family of superheroes in the background; Tony caught a glimpse. Another Steve sitting on the other side of the road, jean-clad legs pressed into dew sodden grass, white t-shirt gleaming in the sun. No cowl, no shield, no white A shining across his forehead, no red and blue. He was sitting, and watching the two men come to an impasse by the roadside, outside the grounds of the facility that stood for everything they had given their lives to, over and over.
“He’s doing fine.” Stark repeated, words holding less emotion than the synthesised voice of Iron Man. “He’s…recovering.”
“I still don’t see why a SHIELD agent can’t run their own damn spy nest.”
“Did you not have presents in your time?” Tony asks, part snark and mostly befuddled, the multicoloured gleam of fairy lights dappled in his hair.
Please
“You know it never went away. And so do the denizens of the world, what with the highly publicised rescue of the Sokovian citizens during Ultron’s rampage. SHIELD has and continues to do good, regardless of the Hydra debacle…we’re just planning on making it official.”
Except this Iron Man would just point out in a monotone that there weren’t any visible light sources around, even though they would have had to light up this place somehow. He didn’t look too distant from a character in a horror tale himself-you couldn’t look at him straight, the only source of light, harsh and blinding, in a passageway of darkness. The light from the circle in his chest cast shadows underneath a glinting, square, deathly sharp jaw; light emanating from palms encased in blood-gold metal gauntlets that could punch through walls.
Granite, vibranium, carbon. Wrong, all wrong.
is touching his lips, laying claim to the words he cannot say but that she bared, over and over. She’s kissing him, and Tony closes his eyes and lets her-lets himself believe that he doesn’t need to stand out, to be anything special in order to be loved.
“Thank you.” He whispered, sound barely escaping the ash, the hoarseness, the throttling gratitude. The Reality Gem shone on like a constant, Time a quiet counterpoint to the side.
“-ny Stark met with the Chinese foreign minister to ease out some final wrinkles with the Accords, in a step that rang out assurance for all Asian powers that were concerned about ‘superheroes’ being too Western-centric-“
Well. He hadn’t said any of the rest of it. Figured something would escape eventually.
Then, like an afterthought, to a statement completed before. “Tony Stark doesn’t seem half bad though.”
– but Steve was looking at him now, gaze unswerving, face drawn and eyes pale; looking like he didn’t need Tony to verbalise his honesty, like he could read Tony’s rage off the impassive glint of a blood-and-gold helmet. And that was what prompted his next response, maybe– that it didn’t sound like a taunt, or an accusation, that it sounded like Steve was genuinely
Steve blinked, and blinked again, each second punctuated by the flutter of whisper-thin lashes. By the fifth time, his irises had gone glassy, though his voice wouldn’t shake. “What do you think?”

This time though, in this particular reimagining, it wouldn’t be the sound of the reactor casing smashing. A thud instead of a clank, the sound of vibranium slicing through flesh, severing bone from bone. Steve’s eyes stayed closed, the sound never came, but his imagination had completed the task and it was like somebody had squished his insides all together. His eyes were burning again.
Scattered amongst the rubble though, were higher mounds of sand, dirt, cement. Piles of bricks stacked next to every dilapidated edifice. Fluorescent signs of construction, flags and tape, orange and bright yellow- heavy machinery. And here and there, almost discreet enough to be invisible, but not to Steve’s eyes- the black print of the Stark Industries logo.
Tom raised his eyes to the sky. “Can you?”
“You need to stop saying that.” Peter turned back to his little paper plate boasting a fajita tower of over six inches, easy. Hell, to have a metabolism like
So all casual like, because they’re friends, he says, “Steph, open this jar for me, will you?”
He’s just about to offer to store the bagels inside his…suit chest plate cavity or something, when Steph just takes off without a sideways glance, shield withdrawing from…somewhere. Tony blinks dumbly in her wake for several seconds, before activating the call on his own suit bracelets. He has a sneaking suspicion there won’t actually by much left to do by the time it gets here.
Steve stepped further inside. It wasn’t a traditionally walled room, space itself seeming to bend and curve unnaturally with the stylistic architecture. Smooth grey walls rose from polished wooden floorboards, curving away to form shadowed alcoves. Three echoing footsteps-and Steve was within one of the cubbies, observing objects mounted in the recesses on the wall, sealed behind glass, softly backlit.
“Do not let him die.”
A beat.
Another second of quiet.
“Pah.” Natasha said. She sounded a bit like Ebenezer Scrooge, but Russian, it was
The murder counts still stood. Howard and Maria’s…….oh god, the images still made the bile rebel and rise in his throat. But the crime that Bucky had specifically, physically not committed…..Tony had them dropped. Of course he did.
“Again, Rogers.” Tony’s voice was deathly quiet. “This would have been a hell of a lot more touching if you hadn’t pulled shit that indicated anything
It’s a good feeling. This odd, until now mythical sensation of not being alone. He wants to make her feel the same, and he opens his mouth but Steph’s already gone off again, with, “I was thinking we could have milkshakes, the place is a couple of blocks away, and there are these artists in the local gallery we could have a look at, the things they’re doing with thrown away material is just
A quiet, unmistakeable uptilt. “Tell him that?”
, he was making a circuit around the stage, handing out passes to the grasping, flailing hands from the crowd. And Steve was…he was right
Sounds blared in and out of his mind like a fractured record, somewhere beneath the peaceful drumming of the rain on the roof. A cascade of images flipping past his eye too fast to see: the ground shaking under their feet, the roof crumbling, the bars lining the cells twisting in place. Repulsors flashing white in the dark, his heart frantically thudding against his ribcage, words being pushed past cracked lips.
“What did he say?” Sam Wilson, concentrating on the relevant facts. Fucking
“They get turned away.” Rhodey replied simply. His dark eyes clouded over, because of course he was the kind of man who felt more for the suffering of others than his own. “The Australian government refuses to accept illegal refugees on its shores. Whether they’re fleeing from war or starvation, doesn’t matter. Thousands from Syria, Congo, Afghanistan…”
, except to him the stars always look like they’re flashing feebly in a canvas of nothingness, dying out in sputters. And they are-it’s dead light that the humans on the face of the earth admire, dead light from gas giants that blew up millennia ago that gets written about in poetry. And still the stars try, flashing on in a vain attempt to catch attention while there are millions of them out there, too easy to mix up. They call famous people stars-which makes no sense, because a non-astronomer can’t tell Rigel from Betelguese. They’re all the same. Glowing spots hopelessly trying to light up a perennial darkness, no different from the billion other glowing spots. And they try and try to shine brighter and brighter…and boom. Nova.
“I said some things to Steve too.” His words were short.
)- but as the last few minutes proved, that ship had long sailed. Plus, not many people had his contact details, and even if they did, a phone call over heavily secured lines would have been far more in line with expectation rather than an innocuous text or email.
How could a weapon of war be so beautiful?
Green, green grass. That’s what the screen opened to, though Tony was barely focused on that. No, what brought his flitting eyes to a standstill was the particular quality of the pixels, their flickering edges- particularly around the blurred outlines of objects. To anyone else, this would look like standard video footage. To particularly keen observers, it might even appear a little dream-like. To Tony Stark’s sharp, proficient eye…he didn’t even need a second to quantify it.
but it was what had happened and Steve could deal with that right now. He….memory-Steve was raining blows down on Iron Man’s armour, metal screeching against the wall. A deafening series of
Steve was painfully, incandescently happy the day he saved Bucky Barnes.
She lands, and her elbow bends in a flawless right angle when she whacks the guy straight across the nose with the body of the shield. Blood erupts from him like a faucet, speckling blue leather and the exposed pink of her face in a colourful spray. A drop of red sneaks down the white of the shield, trickling across the face of the star. Tony stops breathing.
Another little crackle of amusement ripping through the frozen air, and it almost hurt as much as the clanks.
in his breast, his heartbeat thundering along in his ears as accompaniment. But what they had was better – a snapshot of what their city was and could be again; limitless skies stretching over their heads and the symbol of their team, tall and gleaming and untouched.
“Of all the places you could go to on holiday,” Sam sounded resigned and amused all at once, like Steve had no comprehension of how entertaining and simultaneously pitiful his antics were, “you had to pick the one where everything can possibly kill you.”
He stared ahead, gaze affixed on the distance like Tony’s was, had to be. Appropriate, perhaps. Two sightlines reaching for a common goal, forever parallel, never meeting. “Running errands for Mrs Hosemann down the street, even though she could probably lift the washing more easily than I could. Making breakfast for Ma before her five am shift at the hospital, every morning. Facing down Mikey and his thugs in the alleys. Basic training in the Army. It wasn’t about whether it was unpleasant, or…scary, or difficult. Sometimes it was all three. I
That….that was. It took several seconds for his genius brain to compute, for his body to stop freaking out that it was breathlessness, his chest drawing tight- in a good way.
One snap, and the world came back to life.
He didn’t have the shield. But hell. He was still Captain America.
, fuck no.
They reach the Tower entrance, and the elevator zooms them up in mere seconds. They step into the common living room and she actually
The server opened his mouth, and shut it again. Hitched his tray of Captain America themed canapes a little higher, like readying himself to fling it into Tony’s face at the slightest hint of danger. “Uh. This is an anniversary party?”
It’s a poem.”
“And I’m alone.”
“As Walt Whitman would say – I contain multitudes.” The curve of Tony’s lips grew more pronounced, delicately balanced between a smirk and a smile. “I’d quote more,
“I didn’t know the stakes.” Clint huffed a short laugh, fingers tapping on his thigh faster. Any time now. “I was stupid. Everyone was stupid, sides be fucked to hell.”
“Again and again,” Steph begins quietly, dabbing away at his scraped collar bone with motions that ache in their gentleness. “even though we know love’s landscape. And the little churchyard with its lamenting names, and the terrible reticent gorge in which the others end.”
Zemo; but anger was not the right response here. This was merely a copy- there were others out there, and if this, god forbid, got released to the
“Sure.” Tony drawls, and Stephanie flushes a little and ducks her head. That was…unexpected, he always made fun of Cap, that’s how their little relationship worked…though now that he thought about it, she never really disclosed many non-Cap related parts of herself-Tony, you tactless idiot.
the point: the axis around which everything else revolves, the destination at the end of a long, tumultuous journey. Realisation, confession, resolution. Happy ending. That’s how it goes. And love
Not that there was an astonishing wealth of silence greeting his words – to add insult to injury, Tony could discern the faint, peppy tones of some cell phone game playing in the background. The xylophone was unmistakable. So was the blond head bent over a minuscule screen; the only visible body part peeping over the back of the ginormous team couch in an otherwise unoccupied room.
Steve should…Steve should pause it. Close it. There were better things to do, like worry about how the hell this got captured on film anyway, it was probably that
It took Steve ten minutes to navigate his way out of the crowd flocking outside the NGV ornamental fountains. Bodily integrity and personal space firmly reclaimed, he walked up St. Kilda, moving towards the spires of Flinders Street Station. It was slow moving, with camps of people randomly stopping in the middle of the road to cluster up together and make exaggerated, pouting faces at their cameras-revelling in their ability to do so without being mowed down by cars or trams. There was a slouching girl in front of Steve, head firmly bent to her phone screen, shuffling ahead like one of those creeping things in that show Sam had shown him…
This moment…required something. A swelling crescendo of music to mimic the rising tide of
Iron Man’s helmet cracked open, revealing jagged edges and Tony Stark’s face, gaunt and blood-streaked, defiant and terrified. It…it wasn’t quite like the memories either. Steve had remembered the grief. He hadn’t noticed the fear.
emotion instead of a stoic mask…could sound so different.
It felt like the sound had leapt out of the floor, deep enough that it was still reverberating somewhere behind his sternum. One of the bots, probably. It came from the far end of the workshop, out beyond the bend of the L-shaped space, where their charging stations were.
Atonement. That seemed like a common theme with her and Stark.
The last thing he remembered was the whitened knuckles of her hands, as she was finally easing the book shut.
“Excellent.” Tony cut across with brusque efficiency, proffering a hand. Peter took it and propelled himself up- a vast improvement from the first time Tony had offered a handshake and Peter had poked at it to see if his finger would pass through like that of a ghost. “We can swap stories then.”
“–and isn’t that why you’re here in the first place? Or was it some other guy in a tin can who ‘retired’ a year ago?”
and Tony had spent close to a hundred thousand dollars over the years bribing people to not mention it to Steve. “You seemed a little out of it, there, after you finished.”
“Hmm. So you
Over this sound of his blood thumping crazily in his eardrums, he hears the other Avengers not-so-stealthily making their retreat. He only knows they’re gone when the sound of Natasha pissing herself laughing finally dies down-and here they are, Tony staring determinedly at a closed jar of applesauce with his frozen feet apparently incapable of movement, and a blue-eyed stare boring a hole (
. Steve wanted to say, but couldn’t, because one ear couldn’t be exchanged for another- and Sam was more than a ear. He was the most empathetic person Steve had ever known, with a staggering touch for healing. It was almost cruel to keep him away from helping people.
Steve resisted the urge to fling his phone at the wall. With any luck, he’d smash the phone
“Do you often get distracted by poems mid-celebration?” Steve enquired, throat bobbing in the process like a prime target for strangulation. “Overcome by the literary genius of Wordswo–”
God, he looked so grim. Hair turned completely white, straight-jawed. The Howard from back in Steve’s time would have spluttered his drink all over his collar, if he’d seen this. He’d probably still be buzzed that he didn’t lose all his hair with age though, the vain prat. And it wasn’t like he’d changed completely. The way he interacted with the teenager on screen- that snark was still there.
“Right.” Steve said, again. He almost wished for an actual drink rather than an empty can- it always looked so…..peaceful maybe wasn’t the word, but something like it, when a hero stared into the bottom of a drink in the pictures. Like he had found all the answers. “He should go back to the farm.”
Steve blinked. Sleep suddenly seemed very distant.
“If this has to work-“ Tony began, and Steve almost didn’t want to listen anymore, he could have agreed to
And she was also far more forgiving of his vices. “That’s not what a good head of R&D does now, is it.” He dropped onto the couch, jacket sticking uncomfortably to his skin, left hand darting to the side table to pick up a stylus. “Now go occupy your servers surveying the world for trouble. And processing the latest upgrades in the armour. Being my nanny is far too much of a waste of your brilliant abilities.”
Steph, for her part, is simply
He’ll explain, he’ll explain it all later because…because now his hands finally tighten over her shoulders and he kisses her, and the breath leaves her chest in a hitch and they’re pulling closer and twisting tighter, tongues flickering out and her hand like a brand over the back of his neck. Deeper and deeper, while the memory of drowning flickers at the back of his mind like something he can never really leave behind.
“I’ve been thinking about it.” Steve said, and silence fell- cold and intractable.
That dark brow quirked up. Tony’s mouth curved to the left, as if to say-
Tony approached cautiously – Wilson had nearly cannibalised him over ruining his Angry Birds Space score, attributing his drop to five hundred and seventeenth place in the leader scoreboards to startlement-via-Stark. Tony was surprised enough people still played Angry Birds Space for there to have been a five hundred and seventeenth place. Regardless, his steps were mincing and dainty-like until he rounded the front of the couch and Steve exonerated him from all future accusations by mumbling out a distracted, ‘hey Tony’.
“This isn’t a slap dash job.” Light knocking, like metal fingers over glass. Iron Man tapped at the far wall one more time, then prised it to the side-it was a sliding door. Stepped through: Sam could hear boots striking the ceramic of tiles. A lab then, maybe. “I can’t find any ports, forget actual systems and hardware that I can hack into for information. No cabinets with physical records to ransack. There isn’t even a single piece of furniture in this place.”
Nevertheless, Peter Parker remained a sneaky bastard who wouldn’t answer a straight accusation. Instead, his thin brows went winging to his hairline, eyes flitting up and down Tony’s frame dubiously. “You look…shiny.”
His fingers brushed over something cold and smooth- he pulled his phone towards him, shifting on his stomach in the process, and used the base of his palm to rub out the condensation on the screen. A quickly typed out pass code later, the screen flashed to life. One new email. No subject.
“Thanks Mr. Stark, but…uh. Wow, it’s so hard to say this.” Peter sent a hand through his messy bangs, eyes darting a million directions per minute. “I’m in school-”
“She told me…she told me I needed to allow Bucky the dignity of his choice.” So fond, despite it all. Desperately fond. “Sometimes I wonder if she used to tell herself that, after the plane went down.”
up close though. The Black Widow- god, how does she
Steve’s expression was just as candid, but there was something flickering under the depths there- something in those eyes. His voice didn’t waver. “I need to tell you something.”
More so because granite’s the
“I like poetry.” Stephanie says, and Tony mimes falling over in shock to the great entertainment of-absolutely no one, not even a single laugh, ugh, the Avengers were
Steve was half braced for a muttered ‘nerd’ or ‘dork’ or whatever other interchangeable insult people had fashioned these days for a person passionate about their interests. It didn’t come, just Sam’s patient voice from the other end. “And what’s White Night?”
“And that value’s been…expanding, to say the least. Since I woke up in this century, since I numbed myself to this world.” The words dropped like they were perfunctory, like they’d been stored up for a while, for days and months and years – but there was no relief, no fanfare. “Since I thought trading my past for people’s future was a fair bargain.” A flash of feeling, there and gone in Steve’s eyes. “It’s been a steady climb…but this isn’t about that. Though I wish a million times over that it was.”
Tony exhaled. Waited for the tightness at the base of his throat to pass, before the words crept past his lips, quiet and steadying. “I wouldn’t have pictured you doing this…not twenty years ago.”
“And Bruce?” Steph actually asks, kicking her heels up in her long stride like she’s enjoying this. “I have a feeling uranium would be a little insensitive.”
At least Natasha wasn’t looking expressionless anymore.
“You do.” FRIDAY sounded a little….distracted, the way she always did when she was perusing information in her servers and talking to him at the same time. JARVIS never used to do that, even though their programming had been identical in those respects. It was wondrous, and endearing. “You could probably put them off till Thursday, they’re fairly urgent but will not impact too much on delay-“
bread which I take great umbrage to because have you even seen the
A loose wave of the hand, and holograms came to life in the space above the conference table-blue and transparent lines sketching out an overhead map of what looked like innumerable, small landmasses scattered over limitless sea. “Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Manus island. Some of the prominent locations with detention centres. A closer look at some of the islands towards east Guinea…”
“But it doesn’t work like that.” And Steve smiled again, maybe not quite as idealistic, shadows peeking from the edges – but all the stronger for it. “There are things and people that exist outside my…scope, my understanding. The kind that are worth respecting, the kind that change minds. Kings and wizards and Norse aliens, even a space cowboy or two. Inspiring, heroic people.” That weathered smile again, this time just for him. “Stubborn people.”
you only live once. Don’t wait, or you might be too late. That kinda thing.” Tony released the skin, watched as the crease remained before he smoothened it out with a thumb.
Just that one day, Steve had apparently disappeared from his then-safehouse and somehow had a tete-a-tete with Tony Stark. Sam didn’t know the details of what had happened that day, just as he didn’t know what had occurred when he’d sent Stark off on a wild goose chase from the Raft and only Steve and Barnes had returned. Steve didn’t offer to share, and Sam didn’t ask.
express how much I appreciate you…taking care of me like this-”
New physical evidence brought to light. Tony’s face in the flickering light of the Siberian bunker, drawn tight with apprehension as he explained what he had found, how the international police and media had been duped. His half-hearted quip to Bucky to lower the gun, that there had been a ‘truce’, that he’d made a mistake.
(the interruption didn’t come as a surprise. His stomach twisted with unease, with the utter
probably didn’t teach the classes, even if Steve mustered up the courage to go. And if he did…Steve would still be an outsider, peeping into a bright, vivacious life that had no place for a relic, a withdrawn shell of a man.
“How long are you planning on staying in this place? There is a party going on outside, I hear.”
“Mr Stark gave it to me.” Vision said. As if there had been any other possible answer. As if Steve had been expecting anything else. “He told me to keep it, and call if additional assistance may be required on a matter, as per my judgement.”
Tony smiled, small and absent. “We aren’t exactly rose
? Okay, two flights, but still. He dragged his feet up the last couple and leaned sideways on the wall to catch his breath, stitch in his side burning fiercely. A few controlled exhales and he pushed himself straight, sweat-sodden sleeve leaving a streak on the wall as he inched forward, automatic doors to the main floor sliding open with a swish.
Steve’s feet were moving – he’d fallen into the dance, the pattern, unaware of even making the first step, the two of them circling each other around the ring. How many times had they done this? He should’ve… he should’ve kept count.
“About…about Zemo.” Tony turned his eyes away for the first time all conversation, gaze flitting from one background object to the next. “How do you.” He stopped, then started again, T’Challa watching him with impassive eyes all the way. He forced it out. “How did you forgive him?”
That wouldn’t matter though. This was Pepper he was talking about. She’d keep her feelings out of it, and do the right thing. So he matched her gaze, just as steady, and held it throughout as she spoke without as much as a segue way-
Of course, Rhodey wouldn’t let it rest. Why couldn’t he? Wasn’t he supposed to be the sensible one? They weren’t the ones responsible for his legs. Tony was. And Tony was the only one personally wron-…
look loosely propped on a wire hanger, but rather like it…fit. Those eyes would always remain the same though – idealistic spark and impossible kindness twinned in dark irises.
“You think those are from the quakes?” Sam asked instead, chin bobbing up towards the cracks wreathing their way up the walls. Iron Man paused, repulsor light darting over the patch of wall-there were no jagged edges of plaster visible, just solid concrete and spider-like cracks that were clearly more than skin-deep.
Another second, drawn long and taut. Tony turned his head away, heels tapping down the stairs, vanishing behind the stage.
“Leaving so soon?”
The lines breaking around his mouth pointed towards him being in his fifties at least, maybe more judging by liver spots and blemishes.
“That’s right, Captain Rogers.” Vision’s voice replied, levelly. There were no pleasantries following it. That….answered all questions about whether the android could feel emotions, Steve supposed.
is he even remotely-”
The light changed, and Steve moved-each succeeding step lighter and lighter like he might float away.
,” and his mouth twisted further in incredulous contempt- “rather than knowing that any bit of paper isn’t worth throwing his teammates in
“No.” Tony lied, eyes skimming over the little screen mounted in the device he’d fished out in a millisecond. His shoulders were already beginning to curl up in tension, the lightness in his chest dissipating as fast as it had appeared. The words weren’t anything he hadn’t seen before, but that didn’t stop them from being ominous.
It isn’t even that big of a deal anyway. Tony had seen a goon aiming for Steph from behind like the loathsome little coward he was, swooped in to intercept and got blasted into a subway station for his efforts. Yes, she’d already seen the guy, Tony, yes she could just have dodged the shot Tony, yes you’re a self-sacrificing idiot with no regard to his own safety, why the hell do you keep on doing this to everyone Tony
“You have never openly shared concern over your nighttime terrors previously.”
. It was easy to forget, how many decades Tony Stark had spent on this world, until Steve saw that unblemished, unlined face, the almost innocent eyes. Still not happy though. And then
“People that would stand by me if I was doing the right thing, who’d stop me if I was going the opposite way.” And there it was again, all the change of hearts withstanding – that firm-jawed conviction that could still steal Tony’s breath. “People who would save the world if I ever wasn’t good enough.”
“So we’ll handle the rescue, and leave the sneaking around to people who’re a little less shiny and don’t attract magpies.” The words escaped without thought. Like the decision had been made unconsciously ages ago, and Tony was only being made aware of it now.
Steve was already standing at the intersection up ahead, lips moving as he spoke to some earnest-faced, freckly-cheeked officer. Chin bobbing as he listened intently to a response, sleeves of his tee pulling tight around the bicep as he gestured to the opposite end of the avenue. Hell, what thirty-going-on-ninety year old had the right to look this authoritative in a round-neck? In beige cotton pants? He didn’t even appear to have
When he opened them again, Nat’s blues were scoping over the lines of his face- quiet and sympathetic and aching. “We’ve all made mistakes before. The crux is that we regret. Stand responsible. Atone.”
Then why. Why did they have to, why couldn’t this be–
to them?” Clint bit into his lower lip and released a scoffing laugh, eyes bright. “And this from the man who wouldn’t stop harping about his teammates keeping secrets from him during Sokovia.”
obtained that I’m smarter than the rest of you sane, mature, non-epiphanised people.” And glassy-eyed or no, Tony still toasted the air with more than a slight touch of glee, voice hoarse and delighted all at one go. “I told you so.”
In a set of pastels, blocky and chalky-soft and colour staining on his fingertips – always the pop of red towards the end that his gaze drifted to, where it lingered. The colour that could change the very way you looked at things – like when sunrise lit the tenements of Brooklyn in rose-gold-cinnabar, gleaming off bicycle pedals that used to look dusty and camouflaging the cracks in sour-cream building walls, clothes left over on the lines at night flapping gently in the wind – like filtering it all through this shade could alter reality itself.
bizarre branch of science liked; but he could still throw in a particle accelerator for fun-damn, the kid’s eyes would probably fall out of his skull when he saw Tony create vibranium in his baseme-
Must be strange. To have your pots and pans, the ones you brewed broth and chicken soup in, spooning mouthfuls into your sick son’s throat, on display like this hundreds of years later. For strangers to stare at, and imagine what it was like. Leave smudges from their fingers on glass, never touch. Forever separated. Because they couldn’t imagine, could they?
“But you said it might be a matter for the Panther.” Now, of a sudden, it was like he had too many words- clumsy, ill-forged ones, but they still weren’t the ones he needed. “Are you…are you going to fight with him?”
Heart slowly thundering in his chest, Steve stared at the screen, the bright white rectangle sending bright spots dancing in his vision every time he blinked. His thumb hovered over the attachment, wavering in the air. One inch, one brief movement, and it would download and play.
(…what would Bruce have done, though? More than anyone he knew, Bruce
The quinjet touched down silently. Everything in sight was green and gold, like a vision out of a Tolkien novel.
And Steve had a million words bursting on the tip of his tongue- all the ways he could have shared information earlier, all the ways he could have trusted better. The way
“Maybe they were just mad at the customer service.” Tony shot back a weakass smile of his own, then realised the faceplate was still down and flipped it open with a command. Ugh, amateur hour over here.
Sometimes it was important to keep oneself deceived. To focus on the restless motions of your best friend on the flight over, and not think of what was coming ahead because Sam’s mind was a blaring field of static now-as the cold light behind War Machine’s eyeslits stared back at him, and he couldn’t bring himself to raise his head.
It was infuriating. He raised the shield over his head and struck, again and again and again. The join between the shoulder and the torso, the jut inwards of the hip, the vulnerable missile ports at the fingers and collar bones. Nothing. Not even a scuff. Vibranium left scratches on vibranium…but he’d found a way beyond that.
This time, the effect was definitely lost on Steve. “Would it be okay for you to pipe down for a couple of minutes? I’ve found something interesting.”
“Where? At the local paper?” Tony arched an eyebrow, more than aware that he was being incredibly
into him with all of its metaphorical shoulder-setting glory – the impact thudding through bone as it jolted back into place, pain radiating through muscles gone loose and watery...the kind that made you gasp with the relief of it, the kind that flared white-bright for a second before ever-so inexorably beginning to fade.
“But-” Steve appeared to be wrestling with a moral quandary, possibly considering who he’d become as a person if he endangered the welfare of a fictional character. Or you know, maybe that was just his struggling-to-hold-in-the-pee face. “Fine. You do it.”
“Our home is beautiful. Eight hundred and fifty two known languages in the nation, twelve of whom have no native speakers.” Tom’s face looked wan in this light, lighter splotches and blemishes on dark skin, itself broken up into a thousand lines. “But we have a messy history. The northern half of Papua New Guinea was ruled by the Germans since 1884. The southern half, by the British. When the Great War broke out, all of that was transferred to the Australians.”
More quiet – Tony glanced to the side to meet those blue irises again, that seemed distinctly unable to pull away. Steve’s jaw worked silently for infinite moments, before words seemed to spill out unconscious of himself and everything else, soft and faintly remembering. “S’been a while since I heard you talk like that.”
He’d admired Steve for his faith, too. In retrospect, it all felt a little ironic.
“But to answer your question….” But the pronoun was too unspecific. The Panther couldn’t know who was being referred to. And yet there was something so
A released breath. “Never mind what I thought.”
Once, twice, thrice. Three eardrum-piercing clangs and Tony staggered back by several feet, legs somehow still standing. Back slumped, shoulder pulling back, arm tensing-he let the shield fly for a last time, vibranium slipping out of sweat-stained fingers.
Crawling silence. He wouldn’t know if it had been seconds or minutes, while he watched Steve’s gloved hands flex uselessly at the edge of his sight, twice and thrice and four times. Watched his lips flicker minutely, eyes affixed to a point ten metres to War Machine’s right, where a circle of light glowed in a scarlet-and-gold chest. Witness an indrawn breath, sound just about to take birth-
“Don’t know about them, I’m afraid.” Tom’s voice was deep, and gentle. “I know a couple of my friends are taking care of some of the recovered detainees, but we didn’t find anyone else from the building we pulled you out of. Was there someone else?”
and Steph’s straight back finally gives way, head bowing under all that pressure -
Tony didn’t much notice the rather long, uncharacteristic pause before the next sentence, as immersed as he was in the integrity of his omelette. When it came though-
“I dunno.” Peter said again, face scrunching up like he was just another teenager that hadn’t just completely blindsided Tony fucking Stark. “You’re pretty old.”
“It’s been two hours.”
he dropped his gaze to the watch on his wrist, wow-
, Tony continued silently within his head. “They’re rerouted and sent off to any number of the Pacific Islands, where they’re usually hosted in detention centres.”
It’s nothing more than the plain and simple truth.
The words echoed, up to the industrial ceiling and back down. They weren’t deigned with a response.
Tony, by contrast, was all about sketching and resketching over the same figure, models A through F scrawled over each other, somehow coalescing into one whole coherent to Stark eyes alone. Rhodey sketched out broad skeletons, defined each major part before fixating on the details – while Tony just ran from specifics alone, building upwards and outwards till the details sort of tumbled into critical mass, somehow forming a bigger picture. Yet, they worked. Both of them.
The memory winked out and left Tony blinking, the workshop just as quiet and shadowed around him. His voice seemed foreign- strange, somehow, even as the words emerged almost inaudibly, “Lights, thirty percent.”
“No.” Steve said, and it felt…..not good exactly, but like a release of pain, to finally let the words and voices free. “But that doesn’t change the fact that it was the biggest fucking lie I’ve ever put to paper. Because- what I should have written- what I’ve come to see-“ Two breaths, quick and rushed, in and out. “-is that I might need you. To question me every time I’ve got an idea in my head that I won’t let go of, to be the wall in my path when I’m pushing forward too hard, to pull me down to the ground every time I climb on a ruined pedestal. Because-“ And he thought of his friends again, Sam and Clint and Natasha and everyone else, people who’d questioned his beliefs but ultimately followed or relented, because he was Captain fucking America. “Because no one else has refused to move.”
“The records I’ve been able to retrieve indicate Christmas morning, when you were eleven.” FRIDAY responded, even more quietly.
Steve kept walking.
“I can’t.” Peter exhaled in utter defeat, the sound of his chin clunking down on the wooden shelf clearly audible. That mop of hair more suited to the business end of a broomstick pulled itself out of the chests, the gangly frame almost plastering itself against the wall as he slid down to crumple on the bed that didn’t fit him.
“It’s right here.” Iron Man’s modulated tones answered, the machine rasp staticky over the ocean breeze. He was standing maybe fifty metres ahead, but off to the side, by the obsidian-black rock overhang. The gold of his suit was cast pallid in the shadowy, unearthly light.
He just couldn’t
“And so should you,” There were just bodiless lines of light in the air visible, where the armour plates articulated, and a ringed blue-white circle. For several moments, there was just that-and then Stark loomed out of the dark, eyes cold and flashing. “this whole ‘wise counsellor’ bit you have going…very entertaining, but some of the most fucking condescending
(The importance, of keeping oneself deceived. Sometimes, it was more than just sometimes.)
“The organisation that prevented a dozen world-ending events and protected several generations from harm? Yes, the very same.”

with all this. The words were escaping without reservation, whetted on the blade even as they were being made, and he got colder with every single one. “Reminds me of you sometimes, really. Best friend. Or Pepper, the great big love of my life. Or my father. Each and every one, with the same little patented expression, the crossed arms and the disapproving looks.
. Is Rita the anthropomorphised form of Nature in her sexy youth? Is Rita devastatingly jealous of her twin brother Peeta? Green represents prosperity too-is Rita a rich brat and the number of inches in her skirt denote how many buffaloes she owns? Maybe Rita just likes green. Did anyone ever think of that?”
Being this…(worked up? Stressed?) ...
“DUM-E.” Tony said, with the second he had left. The Iron Man’s helm swivelled back in his direction.
Debris. Dust and stone raining down, supporting columns collapsing like cards…oh god, the
A second of silence.
“Steve.” Tony repeated. His lips curved up, eyes blinking dreamily.
“Is that…” No matter how many times he cleared his throat, the rawness wouldn’t subside. An open wound, every word flecked with the pain of it, “Is that why you…”
But he was a futurist, and it…didn’t matter anymore. “If the earth is still spinning by the time Thanos is gone, the people are going to be too grateful to care.”
The quiet resurged. She didn’t drop her eyes, even though her voice broke again. “Why are you mad at me?”
“Bodhisattva of compassion.” Steve read on. “Bodhisattva is an enlightened being who stays on earth to help…” a pause, barely noticeable, “people escape the cycle of life, death and rebirth.”
Completely exposed, Tony lifted his chin and stared up at the Iron Man, barely able to hear his own words over the ringing in his ears. “You owe me over six-fifty grand.”
“Should I,” FRIDAY asked, almost gentle; Tony startling because it had probably been close to a minute of full silence and there were firebreathing jerks out there who did not care for his current breakdown at all. “Keep the suit waiting at the landing pad?”
“Maybe.” Tony assented, and meant it too. “But not the best version possible.”
Play.
A flash of blue light, arc reactor blue, crumpling- it was falling. It had to be falling.)
The place was still desolate, even while Melbourne celebrated life and living in the world outside this building; monument really, built to honour the passing of time. So silent. Or not…not really. There was a constant hum in the space, quiet yet overpowering. Pitched at a single note, permeating through halls and corridors and little nooks and crannies. Steve had come to be used to it-it was the hum of the air conditioner, the device that people used these days to isolate themselves from the heat of the sun and the warmth of the outside air. It reigned in every room, the sound, every building he set foot in-within the closed walls of the place he was first thawed out in, the airy spaces of his classrooms, the cabins of the airplane that took twenty-three hours to fly to the other hemisphere of the world, via Los Angeles and Sydney airports (all, all humming); to the quiet abode of his own apartment. A perennial, emotionless sound filtering in from the shiny white machinery mounted on the walls, or tiny vents in the ceiling.
“I do?” Tony queries, standing above his shoulder. The couch is low and he towers over Steve. “I don’t remember that being covered by the history books… unless I’d fallen asleep, of course.”
It was a square platform, about fifteen square feet, with wooden flooring that shone under glossy spotlights. There were four poles erected at each corner, with what looked like fibre rope running along the sides, from end to end, winding around the poles; like a boxing ring. People thronged around the edges, some hoisting kids to their shoulders for a better look. But all that wasn’t the surreal part.
A strange feeling was beginning to crawl through, somewhere underneath the righteous anger- but then Iron Man caught the shield by its edge and blasted memory-Steve in the side; of course Iron Man wasn’t going to be taken down that easily. Memory-Steve buckled to the floor, between two pillars.
Just a tall, stately oak towards the side – foliage in full summer splendour. There’s already a circle of dropped acorns around the base, ready to sprout into a hundred, newer lives.
It was still a jolt to the brain, a brief shot of cognitive dissonance on watching him turn – that square jaw, more well-shaved than baby-smooth, a head of hair that had truly outgrown its teenaged-mop phase, the black lines of a suit that
He hasn’t been alone on the trip, of course. Steve’s been there: sometimes three steps behind, sometimes waiting up ahead by the turn of the road. They’ve sprinted and stumbled, sometimes stood still and refused to move on ahead, sometimes thought of turning away altogether.
He snorted into his towel, drying his face rigorously. He didn’t remember this bit, from the dream. Had he asked about Amazon at all? God, he didn’t retain mundane details even when he wasn’t trying to pry them back from the jaws of the Sandman.
“Cool.” Tony said faintly. “If you’d mentioned you were feeling cooped up, I could’ve arranged some playdates with the other one-year-olds in daycare. Barton’s spawn was born last year… Neville? Nemo? Nessie?”
Ten minutes elapsed before Rhodey straightened up again, having carefully erased the sweep of his wings to draw them more sharply angled to the fuselage. “What do you think?”
And the silence stuck, thick as the humidity that stifled the air, interrupted only by the torrents that battered the earth. Moments passed by, heavy and oppressive, strung tighter and tighter as they stretched longer and longer. Maybe this was the end. Not a bang, or even a whimper. Just a throttling silence, too vast to ever be bridged. The resentment of words left unspoken sliced deep, but this was a curious kind of pain all on its own – or perhaps the feeling that followed pain. Drained, hollow listlessness. Two people who had nothing left to say to each othe–
… oh.
Not that it would take much to decimate this bed. Peter shifted a bit to the side and the springs emitted another ghastly squeak. His feet were still waving around the air like berserk severed appendages. Tony twitched.
He’s curled on the couch, apostrophe-like; dry-mouthed but breathing slower against Tony’s denim-covered thigh. Tony drags blunt nails over his scalp, quietly humming under his own breath.
Clint said nothing.
“May I know your name?”
Steve p’shhhd against his shoulder – it was not very polite. “You would’ve been incredible. With or without me.”
His fingernails curled inwards, driving into the articulated grooves like hooks. Strengthening his grip. If not, he might actually have fallen.
Sam shrugged loosely. “Can’t lie. I’d just renovated the kitchen at the DC ‘partment, even though I spent most of the week in the Facility. Mrs. Harris from the bakery two blocks over was nice. Always gave me free apple-and-rhubarb muffins.”
“We’ll only know after testing.” The harsh light made it almost impossible to see, but Tony could barely glimpse any blue in that circle. It pulsed on, white and powerful.
to Jupiter and back. As it was, Tony just smiled, bright and blinding. “Thanks hon. I’d do it more often, except that would put party planners out of business. And that would
(Insult. To. Injury.)
FRIDAY made a corresponding sound of interest. Tony went on hastily, “If that’s something that interests you, I could talk to Rhodey about the War Machine armor – though I can’t really speak to the experience that positively myself. From personal, um, experience.”
, fighting bad, alongside some of the best people I’ve ever known. I want spies and gods and rage monsters and robot suits- and I want to know that they still want me too.”
...more than 20k, and they still haven't officially re-met yet. I think you guys are getting a sense of how slow this slow burn is going to be :P This fixing-job is hard, guys. But half of next chapter is going to be just Steve and Tony, actually interacting with each other, so there's that to look forward to XD Comment if you liked!
A silent swivel, and Iron Man was pacing back, glass door left open behind him. “There was something here, but they haven’t been here in a while. They left, and had a decent amount of time to wipe all traces of their presence.”
“No blueberry?” Steve asked, almost on reflex.
Steve tugged the earphones out, winding the wires around his fingers before stuffing it inside the back pocket of his jeans. He moved towards the baggage collection area, retrieved his small backpack with a smile. Sucked in a breath, nodded at the doorman. Passed the ornamental wall of falling water, stepped outside.
Right across the faceplate. A deafening clang…then nothing. The blank eyeslits of the Iron Man armour stared back, unaffected.
“It’s…it’s unconventional, but simplistic and…it’s gonna fly, Rhodes.”
His lips curled, ironic with a touch of truth. “Something is better than nothing.”
Tony propped his palms on the flat of the table and pushed himself off, landing on his heels with the smallest of winces. The room was lit gold, dust motes shimmering in the setting sun. He was warm from forehead to toe, and the world looked flawless. “Good motivation for the kids, huh.”
are projections attached to the main body of the aircraft ahead of the main wing – ergo, cans – and you’re all soft and squishy on the inside like a particular orange vegeta– hey, why didn’t you use elevons in this?”
After that third night, there was a four day gap, during which Steve tossed and turned and decimated punching bags and did a thousand push-ups and longed desperately to talk to Bucky or Natasha. One had decided to seal himself away from the world, one had taken to the wind to vanish from existence it seemed. Sam would….would focus too much on trying to
Steph’s watching him, and it’s like her eyes have been tracking his entire train of thought. “And you say you don’t get poetry.”
Tony watches the soft black stains smear between those fingertips, watches them run over the grainy page in skilled, dextrous movements. And vibranium is perfect for Captain America, but this Stephanie Rogers deserves something more. Something more multifaceted, like the carbon she uses to translate the world around her onto the page. The soft graphite that smears on her fingers, the hard diamond that shines as bright, that can’t be cut down by anything else.
A creak, as gloved fingers dug forcefully into hard leather, knuckles pressing at the seams. “And the world would be saved, and the world would celebrate. And I’d be left here, still wanting. Talking. To empty air, to a stone in the ground.” A crack of thunder in the distance. “To a patch of earth six feet under.”
“You giving up on the fight, Rogers?” Natasha stretched her hands above her head, jet black leather-and-Kevlar creaking with the motion; rolled the joints in her neck, hair clinging to sweaty skin. “Misery of existence getting you down?”
“I took the liberty of pre-empting heat or cooling issues-we should be facing no icing problems.” FRIDAY almost sounded excited. “I’d advise you to run simulations first, but JARVIS’ recordings indicate that you’ve never been more exhilarated than while blindly test driving a new suit, regardless of how indecorous he might have found your whoops-”
“I want.” Steve said, then pressed his lips closed. Thinner, more ragged, than Tony remembered them to be. It was irrelevant. “I. I don’t know what it’s like, I think, to do something I don’t want.”
It was almost dark by the time he made it outside- the stars were gleaming: cold, white pinpricks of light. The blanket of white snow was now a bleak expanse of glittering grey. His boots crunched into the icy powder, took a few steps- then that ineffable thing, beyond strength, beyond sinew, maybe called will- finally gave out. He landed on all fours this time, shield slipping from a numbed hand and rolling to lie flat on the ground beside. One exhale, crystallising inches from his mouth, and another. A third, final- and then he pulled his useless right hand back to fiddle with the catches on his right shoulder. One little wiggle of the lever……there. There. GPS on.
He walked to the attached bathroom, still barefoot, splashed water over his face and throat. Avoided his face a little in the mirror, brushing his teeth and speaking through a mouthful of foam, “This what, the third time we’ve cancelled on Amazon?”
“I…understand.” He tasted the word, tasted the coarse sand on his tongue. It was so cloudy, but he could see out to the sea for miles. “More…rightly. I can’t.” An exhale, tossed away in the howl of the wind. “I suppose that was the point.”
Natasha watched him over the counter, hollows under her eyes. The light didn’t look like it was limning her every feature, now. Just putting her shadows on display.
It was his own voice in his head this time, and Steve would have given in to the urge to laugh hysterically- had said laugh not died a quick, miserable death in his throat at the sight of the same man plastered across his screen.
Maybe there was still a flicker of hope, persisting beyond the reach of logic somewhere in his brain. Something that lived for a grand total of fifteen minutes, before dying an ignominious death – as he pulled himself to a standstill six feet above
“As scintillating as that is,” Sam was a liar, he absolutely found that interesting, Steve
split a lip on – and felt something rise to his mouth, too darkly joyous for a smile. “I think we go out there – and we fight for the right to stay alive,” He brushed chapped lips over those ruinous knuckles, a quiet promise, “and we fight to come back to each other.”
Tony closed his eyes.
“The possibility that everything I’d’ve given up my life for was a sham, was terrifying.” A deep, bracing breath. “The prospect of trusting other people was terrifying.”
(Or, he doesn’t want her to think him a lower piece of pond scum than she already does. But fuck acknowledging that-he’s masochistic, but not enough for self-honesty.)
Steve could hear the ocean when he woke.
Back at the beginning, when he’d been dropping off the Tesseract at Camp Lehigh – he’d briefly considered it. Dropping off an envelope on Peggy’s desk with the coordinates of the Valkyrie, so that the other him could find… something. Maybe a happy ending, maybe just a chance. But all of time and its knowledge had been laid out before Steve, and he hadn’t resisted one extra indulgence.
The world blazed bright. Steve let go.
Natasha’s swift look in his direction seemed to agree with him. She smiles at Stephanie a little and murmurs, “We are disclosed by the lies we tell,” and Bruce appears to smile at her in turn.
“I appreciate it, Mr Stark.” Tony looked up, lost as he was among his ever-expanding mire of regrets, and saw the boy’s eyes practically shining with determination. It was…..it was a little awe-inspiring, really. “I can’t tell you how
That little thrown-off pause was identical to FRIDAY’s not even a minute ago- huh. Seemed like he’d ferreted out his source of inspiration for her after all. Being more than two years old though, Pepper made a far more dignified recovery. Replying straight back. It was almost funny, how unusual that was for them. “Enough.”
“Yes.” She’d been in exceptional form, as always.
“With an Itsy Bitsy Spider mug, no less.” Tony cast a last, disconsolate look at the fajita table and turned away. “Also still can’t believe she lets you call her that.”
“FRIDAY.” FRIDAY responded. “My parents were hippies.”
The people in front of him had come to a standstill, so had the people at his back. Maybe it had something to do with the raised platform right in the middle of the street.
“Wasn’t expecting you to stay back and broom the café floors.” Steve smiled, though it was a weak twist of the lips more than anything. “Thought we could discuss… possible culprits? Motive behind attacking this location?”
The clock ticked. The sun had dipped almost completely under the horizon; just leaving orange streaks on the glossy surfaces that shone into Clint’s eyes. What was keeping Laura and the kids?
Sam smiled, faintest of the faint.  “Steady,” was all he said, and they began on their thousands of feet long descent.
But. This.
He liked to fight. It was a sour thing to swallow- but swallow it he did. The Ultron debacle had been good for that, at least. He liked the physicality of it, the feeling of leaving an….impact. He liked proving himself, over and over and over and over. And it wasn’t just a flaw to acknowledge, and do his best to eradicate. It was something to accept, however unwillingly, and be at peace
“Cute.” Tony said, almost flippantly, but eyes feverish in their fixation on the vibranium edge not two inches away from his memory-self’s throat. Then, practically bipolar in its sudden shift, from casual amusement to impatient rage. “But we aren’t here for fucking fantasies.”
“Yeah.” Steve stared out at the surf, heart thudding away steadily. “It is rather wonderful.”
T’Challa inclined his head, just a couple of degrees. “You know how I dropped Zemo off at the mercy of the international authorities. I’ve been meeting with Everett Ross myself every couple of weeks, following up on speedy indictment and punishment.”
Sam exhaled. The empathetic pain in his chest twisted tighter. “I know.”
“I hate running alone,” Steve tells Sam, who’s standing but two paces behind. He strides forward to catch up, reaches out and wraps Sam’s solid fingers over the strap of the shield in one motion. “Hold this for me, will you? Be back soon.”
“I don’t know, kid.” He relinquished the chair with one last flourish, and a single fatal creak, walking over to stand next to Peter before the window. Outside, Queens bustled- in its crowded, closeted, comforting way. “I rather like your world.”
“Sorry.” A quick, perfunctory curve of the lips, playing at a smile. Then back to a featureless canvas, tone calm and inscrutable to match. “Got lost in thought, for a minute.”
In the search of a, what, pillow? that wasn’t there, his insensate fingers discovered a smooth, curving slope- a nice, rounded shape raised from the ground. He tugged it toward him, snow scraping to the side as it moved, and curled his body sideways to curve around the object. Right shoulder hitting the ground, his cheek came into contact with cold, unforgiving metal- polished to the smoothest of finishes. His thumb stroked across the surface under his head, but he couldn’t see the colours in the dark.
It opened in what looked like…..a drawing room? There were Christmas decorations in the background, and a very familiar-looking woman playing a grand piano in the fore. Steve’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion……but yeah. Yeah. There, to the side. That was definitely Howard.
“Seventy five, point two three zero six north, ninety nine point one one three zero west.” With every blink, Steve can see her memorising the numbers. “Find him, kick his ass into gear. Don’t let him run.”
“I don’t suppose that’s a rare occurrence for you.” Turn off the flash. Okay. He…could do that. Absolutely. Steve tapped at the little gear symbol on top of the screen. A menu opened up…white balance, ISO, exposure settings…dear god. What the hell happened to point and shoot? Why was all this so
“But that doesn’t mean…” Sam started, and stopped in frustration, because he needed to get this across clear and unimpeded. “If you insist on accompanying him back to…back to where we’re keeping Barne-”
Still- he couldn’t quite care about that right now. His voice was still a mystery to him- composed or hoarse, unsteady or emotionless. He didn’t quite know. “How did you- …which phone are you calling from?”
It was immediate, the hot, crawling shame sliding through Steve’s veins- Tony’s fingers were coming up to massage the bridge of his nose, when Steve shut the recording off and dropped the phone, the device falling to the mattress with an inconsequential
with it for once.
; and yet that shadowy thought persisted –
Something flickered over Steve’s face, there and gone – and then he was turning around, shooting out briskly, “I’ll catch their attention and take one out, you come in through the front and get the others.”
Tony is not ashamed to admit that he’s a little terrified. “Um, Steph. We could always have milkshakes later.”
When Tony’s face finally came into view, Steve drawing level with the bench….it surprised him, somehow. He’d seen Tony a dozen times on the news following that day- but strangely he’d still been expecting a bruise under an eye, blood seeping from lips and running in a straggly line through the beard, darkly accusing eyes. Not this withdrawn, lined, yet somehow still bland mask.
The game soundly rebuked them for throwing away their life like that, what with being the only self-aware piece of bread in existence on the planet and all. Steve looked positively enthralled.
Nothing but the regular hum-and-whirr of the workshop, and Don Henley’s vocals. Tony frowned, “M I forgetting something? Oh yeah, send a copy to
“Considering the Avengers have been privately funded by SI for over two years, I’m hoping you have a point to make other than hypocrisy.” Ross returned, sharpness shooting through his tone just as quickly.
Peter grabbed at the first glass that floated by on a server’s tray and shoved it into Tony’s hands. His fingers curled around the glass stem on autopilot – ooh, Dr Pepper – even as he stumbled a few steps ahead, being not-so-gently-nudged at the back by a
He lay there for what felt like ages. There were no sounds. No rats scrabbling in the rotting ceiling boards, no plinks of dripping water. No distant cries from the Siberian wildlife. No wind. It was like death itself came to sleep in this desolate, forsaken bunker.
if I did it to spare you or him or spare myself- I don’t. Bloody. Know.” His breaths were falling, fast and harsh, and it was like waking up from the ice and pounding on punching bags all over again. “I don’t know how to fix this. I don’t know what to say to make it better. I don’t know who should apologise, what was right, what was wrong, what will be right, what would be wrong- I.” Phantom asthma, clutching at his chest, making every inhale hurt. “I don’t know if either of us trust each other. I don’t know how to make you agree with me when you don’t, or me agree with you when I
“Steve.” There was a gentleness about her, a sense of care he’d never deserved. “I did what I had to so you
“I was looking for a happy ending.”
“You were miserable.” Rhodey said. “And I was so, so proud.”
Steve Rogers, for his own bloody part, didn’t seem to miss a beat. Unwavering gaze and inflexible jaw and all. “So are you.”
“Your one-dimensional opinion of me is much appreciated, Clint.” Natasha says lightly. Poor sod. He’s going to get eaten tonight.
Even now, she wore a well-tailored blazer that seemed to hang comfortably from her shoulders, but not align to her every curve. Her head wasn’t angled to catch the best lighting, the sunlight skimping on the cream of her cheek to glint off her greys instead; a furrow to her brow and the beginning of crow’s feet at the ends of gloriously pale eyes.
“Because.” Steve started, and paused to pull back a breath. Tony watched on, head still pounding from migraines, tongue dried at the back of his throat, eyes screaming for sleep desperately fixated on the echoes of a memory that had never happened this way. Filled in the blanks for himself
“Found it.” Peter declared, and that would have been enough except he followed it up with, “I keep forgetting that you-it feels good to have someone
A faint
“No, but they’re surprisingly lenient with the rent, so we make do.” Peter muttered in return, in that fantastic mix of deprecation and hyperbole he managed to bring to his humour. Tony never quite knew whether to take his jokes with the sincerity they came served up with. Plus, the kid had been apologising less and less these days which just made things so much bette-
Braced for a repulsor to the gut, he stayed still in breathless defiance – only for his eyes to widen at the all-too-familiar whirr of the shoulder flaps opening up. Mounted short-range missiles… those took three point two seconds to arm, in the Mark VII. That was…
Tony groaned. “And the bird went into flat spin and made straight for the ground.”
There was an interminable silence, seemed like it was spanning several lifetimes. Then-
“I’m so sorry Mr. Stark, I can’t believe my life is coming to this-”
“You do.” Tom turned to look back at the sea, water droplets peppering his bristly hair.
Sam moved, not thinking of traps that were too easily set, his booted feet sinking into the scratchy sand. And they kept sinking-his left foot was plunging deeper than the right, coarse granules piling to the level of his ankle, till his heel hit something hard and flat and solid. Something sparked off at the back of his brain, and Sam pushed his right foot forward-and it sunk even deeper, sand brimming up to mid-calf before his heel found something hard and load-bearing again.
His breaths were already starting to fall heavily. He forced it to a snail’s pace, air pulling at his nostrils and filling his lungs with each cold inhale. His jaw remained tight.
“That I lived in Japan.” FRIDAY responded demurely. “American companies, labour outsourcing, you know how it is.”
The surprise smooths out of Bucky’s features, so does the staidness; he squeezes Steve’s elbow once and for a second, that grin seems alive.
. “You do not need to tell me how awful your high school life is.”
that surged within a little difficult to contain. “And that’s a detail that we long-in-the-tooth, stodgy adults – with all of our realism and all of our practicality – forget so easily. To put it in sporting terms: it isn’t about the player of the match.” And it was the most involuntary thing in the world, to raise his eyes again and meet Steve’s steadfast eyes, that littlest curve of his lips from across the hall. “The love of your life, the most incredible person you’ve ever known. It’s about the team.”
“Tony?
A debt to repay. The words struck something, grasped for something – past the skin of his chest and aching muscle, through the defences of his ribs and right down to his unenhanced, beating heart.
“They’re shiny. Silver.” Tony says, bruised eyes, dim with a kind of terror Steve has lived through first-hand. “These big, heaving whales in the air… and everything else is dark. All of you are dead.”
“If you did the best you could, victory or failure was outside your hands, and there was no space for fear. Now, you need to consider if you’re standing for, fighting for the right thing.” A soft exhale. “Now you stay awake at night wondering if you’ve ruined things beyond saving.”
His knees dropped to the floor, cold concrete coming up to slam against bone with a painful crack. He twisted around, and threw himself chest forward under the chassis of the car, teeth gritting as he caught his weight on his elbows. He scrabbled forward, belly to the ground – the Ferrari Roma above him had a steel-and-aluminium body at least a meter thick, which gave him a few more seconds before it could be sliced through, maybe longer if the repulsors were initially on concussive mode.
echoing quietly in the otherwise deserted washroom. Noise still rumbled faintly from the outside, the usual clamour of a kebab joint in Midtown at noon, for all that robots had hit the avenue two blocks over and the Avengers had thrashed their asses soundly. New Yorkers were a resilient species.
“We’re men of science, you and I.” Tony smiled, with all of the teeth and none of the mirth. “And it’s truer of us than anyone else- an idea is the most resilient parasite. It’s almost anathema to kill one. With the help of this one, and a few of my past mishaps,” Extremis, though T’Challa probably knew about that too, “-I hope to fashion something a little more….bleeding edge, let’s say.”
, he was probably arthritic, or something. Old people got arthritis, right? Osteoporosis, or maybe that was just for old women. Everything-in-your-body-is-breaking-down-isis, yeah that seemed about right. Even his brain, because he stupidly clutched at the arm of his chair while he was getting up and it wheeled to the side under the pressure, sending him staggering in the same direction. Another step, and something stabbed at the heel of his bare foot- probably a stray bit of ceramic from one of the broken mugs. He contemplated raising his foot to check if it was bleeding, but nah. Sleep deprivation wasn’t great for balance, and it was barely a sting compared to the rest of his achy body anyway, so it could join the freaking line.
, Tony tells himself firmly, and sits down to eat. Thor and Bruce seem locked into a fairly engrossed conversation, which is an interesting sight, and Clint keeps trying to down his food in more and more scintillating, athletic ways-which is either going to lead to some sort of Guiness World Record (they have that for literally anything) or Natasha scissor-strangling him at the end of the day to extract a piece of food gone down the wrong tube. He’s calm, and relaxed…and this closed jar of applesauce is really giving him a lot of grief. He wants some with his breadroll, dammit, and yes he’s one of those revolutionaries who like breakfast foods for dinner. But his shoulder fucking hurts and this lid was apparently super-glued shut.
But it soon became apparent that he wasn’t grinning at the audience at all; the dark-skinned, stately man was scowling over his own partner’s shoulder, decidedly unimpressed. He tucked a hand around his companion’s elbow (straight trousers, short, voluminous blonde locks) and moved right. Tony and the redhead moved right. And then left, and then into a quick turn at counts five and six, exactly like the couple two feet away from them.
“Of course, I understand comple- I’m sorry, charges dropped?” Steve was all aboard on the train of placation, but those words were too grabbing not to demand further elaboration.
“Just spider solidarity.” Peter positively beamed, and Tony could have recited the next words in his sleep because it had to be the fifty thousand and seven hundredth time he’d heard them, “She first taught me how to–”
.” Well-tailored as they were, Peter’s sleeves still flapped with his gesturing, aforementioned cufflinks glinting under the light – blood-red hour glass shapes embossed on plain obsidian circles. “Just because she hangs on your every word with all the fangirling and ‘Mr Stark’s–”
Steve stared at Tony, at those features lined with exhaustion and determination, but steadily growing darker and more worried. What would it be this time, what would be the change- would he be quicker on the drop, try to down both of them before they could really put up a fight? Take them in, hand them over-
“I didn’t.” T’Challa said, and something twisted in those black eyes. “I wish to wipe him off the face of this earth just as much as the day I learned that he had murdered my father.”
Man, but I have principles.” And it wasn’t even the banter that made his chest rumble in satisfaction, really. Ten years ago, Natasha wouldn’t have absently acquiesced to the Black Widow being a hero, forget drawing comparisons to Iron Man.
“He should have an Avenger with him.” Steve murmured, too quiet to be heard.
“I am not Ultron.” Tony said, and wondered if he believed himself. But hey, he now had a UN council to watch over his shoulder, just in case.
“Steve?”
Not twenty metres away, Bucky stiffened- and just like that, Steve’s mind was clear: muscles curling in preparatory action, right arm rising slightly in defence (and that, was the first drop of something infiltrating the purity, the faintest sense of displacement and something not being the way it used to be and….saudade).
, you bet your wedded ass I’m gonna lean into it.” Tony smoothed down the lapels of his own three-piece – dove gray, just a few shades lighter than his hair, with silver pinstripes. Shiny was one word for it. Awesome was another.
“Where’s the bathroom?” His voice escaped, clipped and distant.
, a little guiltily sure, like she’s a little kid that got away with stealing from the cookie jar; except for the fact that she just broke a man’s bones and is wearing his blood and
He lifted his eyes.
Bruce muses out loud, “That’s E. E. Cummings, isn’t it,” and the calibre of Clint’s poker face would impress the hell out of Tony if he wasn’t so busy being stunned speechless.
do that. So he psychs himself up, tells his terrified looking reflection in the mirror to deal, and goes up for dinner.
Tony’s free hand reached up to tug at his own lapels, fingers smoothing over the outline of a chain through the silk of his shirt. “Ten years ago, this young little upstart, newest addition to the Avengers, vanishes in the middle of a post-mission clean up. I attempt to track him down, for reasons that have everything to do with a touching, almost parental concern; and not influenced at
(Howard used to hate that saying).
Planting yourself like a tree was all well and good. But he was starting to feel the soil erode away from beneath his feet, and he didn’t know how long he could keep standing.
“SHIELD was your first real anchor. Something you could hold on to, come back to. And then, suddenly…you couldn’t.” Natasha blinked twice during the spiel, facial expressions barely flickering. “I understand you felt you couldn’t trust a higher power after tha-”
“Peter wasn’t telling me how great MJ was. He was telling me how great they were

and now he had an illegal flight to guide out of airspace crawling with military aircraft and he couldn’t fuck this up for T’Challa-
Tony leaned closer before he was even fully aware, eyes sharpening in growing pique. “I’m guessing you didn’t add the bright orange dots just for the pretty.”
He looks at her. Natasha’s lips curve straight up, soft and reassuring.
“Obviously.”
Natasha breaks it. “You failed high school English, didn’t you.”
Tony leaned back on the creeper till his back creaked, dropping the Torx screwdriver in his hand into one of its numerous drawers. Whoever first came up with the idea of drawers on workshop stools needed a raise. Or a million dollars. Fuuck, his hand was cramping.
Right, so. Make it to the main workshop, get a gauntlet manually from a later Mark. Three shots, fully charged, to the arc reactor. Okay.
“Good.” Tony twisted the hat under his fingers further; Steve resisted the urge to pull it away from his hands, stroke his knuckles to soothe the anxious movement. “My name’s Tony, by the way.”
“Stark, I swear– ” Steve’s hands rose as if half in mind to physically remove Tony out of his path, but they froze in mid-air, blue eyes darting to the urinals and back to his fingertips again, before they fell to his sides reluctantly.
I’ve watched you, Steve thinks hazily – watched you raise a child, watched you be blissfully married, watched you speak to Howard, father to father, and dole out more understanding than he deserved, and let me walk you away from your pristine life and give me more trust than I had ever earned. I watched the silver grow from the temples of your head to the longer hair-strands, to the scrub of your goatee, up to the fleck of your brows. And the longer I keep watching you now, the more I know I’m watching someone else.
And that was…Steve was almost frustrated with himself- because what
Natasha’s eyes were clear, and unwavering. Clint’s eyes burned.
“This is getting a little morbid.” A cartoon loaf, with a single separated piece of cartoon bread, materialised on screen.
Sam raised an unimpressed brow back- Steve resented him for it, because he’d never been able to pull that particular trick. Not like he’d ever say that out loud though. It was so sneakily satisfying to let Sam think that Steve was better than him at (mostly) everything.
Natasha gave a brief shake of her head. Her eyes had dropped to the linoleum tiles, scoping something in the cracks where one slab fit into the other. “Before, in the helicarrier.”
Finally, Steve raised his head three inches above the pillow and groggily opened his eyes. The room was dark, yet his eyes still burned- there must still be a couple of hours to go before sunrise. There was a flash of light, reflecting off the darkened walls after every three seconds. The part of his brain that wasn’t still in the throes of sleep (or swearing up a litany of curse words), realised it was a notification on his phone. Probably what woke him up.
Tony thought, and
“I was.” Steve said, and there was something about that that wasn’t quite right. Spoken too lightly, frivolous and easy. Lacking the import that words like that deserved.
It was hard, to remember a point in his life when he had felt such…..singular emotion. One thing, and one thing alone. Untainted. Casting out, bleaching out everything else. It was like his heart was going to shake apart in his chest.

The scene winked out.
“World hangs in the balance.” Clint felt the words weigh on his tongue, pulled from archives of old memory that would never grow dusty. “And you bargain for the life of one man.”

Aaaand the jackass was back. Wow, that had been short-lived. “No, it’s a regular old
on the screen. Hell, wasn’t super-serum eyesight supposed to be impeccable? Did those pixels need to be in such close vicinity to Steve’s Grecian nose?
(A remarkably grim way to look at it, Steve had thought at the time. Then he’d glanced to the side and seen Natasha’s completely enamoured expression- and tried not to think about what the Hulk and the Black Widow found romantic. Probably Nietzche.)
And Steve…moved, because he was tired of holding still, tired of being stuck in stagnation, tired of letting life fleet him by. He moved, and he could feel Tony’s startled breath under his lips-and he didn’t know if they were the softest lips he’d ever kissed because he wasn’t looking back, he was staying in the present. This present, this…
