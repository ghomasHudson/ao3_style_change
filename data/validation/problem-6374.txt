He gasped as he felt something prick his neck, and he turned in time to see another agent holding an empty syringe. He put his hand up to his neck and took a deep breath to keep himself from succumbing to panic, and the woman that had first cornered him in the hallway days earlier said, "Let her try to fight it. I love watching as the struggle slowly goes out of them."
"What?" Steve asked with a nervous laugh. "I'm just saying when you first, er, became like that, they were really nice, and now they're kind of, uh…"
But the hell he was ever going to admit to them that it was anything remotely approaching a good idea.
And no, he did in any way, shape, or form envy this other Tony's happily domestic life. "How 'bout eggs?" he asked as he looked over the bare necessities stocked therein.
"It really won't be that much longer now, Tony," that asshole Bruce said, and Tony just grunted and nodded but didn't really acknowledge him any other way. Bruce could say whatever he wanted. He didn't care. He knew better than Bruce ever would, and Bruce
around here, right? He didn't have any dolls for her to play with, and he wasn't sure he had anything for her to color with. The Cap might have — he was sure the Cap had some art supplies — and even though this was his future or alternate-universe daughter, purportedly, he didn't think it was a good idea to go and purge his art supplies for the entertainment of a child. The Cap had had such a hard time allowing himself such a frivolous purchase that Tony, as it turned out, had had to make the transaction for him in the end.
But, not wanting to dwell on that, he let it slide and instead, abruptly changed the subject, asking Pepper if she knew of any designers that had any experience with maternity evening gowns. She seemed startled by the change but still was able to get control of herself enough to say that she did, and two days later, two people in tailored and expensive wear appeared at the Tower to take measurements. Not particularly enthused about letting them into the penthouse — or any of the Avengers' personal spaces — Tony instead met them in a lower floor conference room and stood there in his underwear (which he was
It was another nearly twenty minutes before Tony seemed to come out of his own post-coital haze, sitting up and groaning like he was just waking up from a long nap. He shivered a little and looked down at himself, and Steve, towel wrapped around his waist, got up from where he'd been sitting at the computer attempting to do some research on the being they'd encountered for that brief moment and stood in front of him and said a sheepish, "Hey."
But the words didn't bring him relief or a sense of calm nor did they induce panic. They didn't do…anything, really. It was a boy. They were having a boy. Somehow, he knew he should have been relieved by this, but he wasn't. Actually, if anything, he was actually a little…
"No," Natasha said and reached out a hand to stroke his hair, and DUM-E picked his arm up a moment to watch the scene in front of him, "it's labor. It's just going a bit slow for you. That's all."
Feeling trapped, Steve sighed, closed his eyes, and bit off the smallest portion of the cookie that he could be bothered with.
" and dropped his fork against the plate in protest. Barnes smiled at Steve and said a sincere, "Thanks," to him before the look turned smug as he turned to Wilson and gave a very proud and taunting shrug of his shoulders to him.
appearance. Well, he was going to have to get used to it. He wasn't about to make a 'Howard' of himself. His kid would know he was loved and wanted. His kid wouldn't be wracked with guilt for damn near decades because he'd never said 'goodbye.' His kid was going to be so loved and wanted he'd be smothered by affection, which…yeah, OK, maybe wasn't the best option either. But the point was his kid would be loved and know he was loved, and that's what mattered.
"Well," Tony said with a shrug and continued to clean up the mess he'd made, "I mean, you could argue every holiday on the calendar is a con perpetuated by retail outlets looking to make a buck. And can you blame them? I mean, Black Friday is called 'Black Friday' because it's traditionally when all these stores finally get out of the red and start turning a profit. And don't play all high and mighty with me. The commercialization of Christmas is a time-honored American tradition that people were complaining about even back in your day, you old codger. And I know they had wrapping paper back in your day, too, so don't even try to give me that shit that they didn't."
Dinner settled after that, with the assorted group breaking into smaller conversations — Wilson telling Natasha about his recent counseling work, Barton, weirdly, discussing the cultivation of plants with Bruce, Rhodey and Thor and Hill getting into a debate over…Asgardian versus Earth politics? Whatever.
"That's the second time you've said that," Steve said, eyebrow quirked and lips twisted in equal parts annoyance and amusement.
"'m fine, Brucie," he mumbled and went to close his eyes until he realized there was a weighty lump in his arms. He looked down at his little newborn, and he frowned when he realized he couldn't very well fall asleep with her in his arms, no matter how much he wanted to.
"Yeah," he said and yawned, fighting to keep his eyes open. "You guys are needed more elsewhere. I'll be fine. JARVIS can monitor my vitals — you know, in case I stroke out or start to hemorrhage or something."
Tony shrugged and decided to take it for the ass-backwards compliment it was. "He's good at what he does."
" at her, but his tone must have gone clear over her little head, as she just said, "My crayons are gone!"
"Huh?" he said and made a disgusted face as he tossed the offending clothes aside. "You want me to dress like I normally dress?"
"I've seen you polish off a large container of pork fried rice in like ten minutes. No way in hell are you getting just that."
But he wanted Steve there. He wanted Steve there with him so badly. He wasn't afraid to admit — to himself, anyway — that he was scared, that he was terrified, that no matter what Bruce had said about him being blessed by a fertility goddess from space, he'd done the research and he knew there was still every possibility he could hemorrhage or worse. He could die. It may have been the twenty-first century, but childbirth still came with its share of risks, and even in twenty-first century America, women died during childbirth. He could very easily become a statistic, but if Steve was there — at least if Steve was there — then at least he would have that. He would have Steve with him there until the end, and a very selfish part of him wanted to be able to say that — to at least have that, have Steve with him and have Steve by his side right until the very end.
"I still know how to properly feed and care for my Tony Stark," Steve said and gave him a gentle squeeze. "Come on," he said and led him over to the buffet table. "I'm kind of hungry myself."
The one that was clad in purple overalls, her hair pulled back into a ponytail as she clutched what looked like a plush Captain America doll tight in her arm. He wasn't good with ages, but he'd peg this one at about three — maybe a little older — and his stomach did a somersault as her mother said to her, "Emma, come on, over here," and beckoned for her to follow over to another row of chairs near to some children's play sets.
"You know she can't really see that far in front of her, right?" Rhodey asked, but Barton shrugged again.
Now he was going to have to wait eight more fucking hours to see Steve again. God, he didn't even know if he'd make
He glanced up at Barton, who was busy looking at the folder of requests with Hill and Steve and said, "You're quoted in this."
"Stark! I need a fix!" he called out, and Natasha rolled her eyes as Barton met up with them. He dropped the bow on the table in front of Tony, seemingly unconcerned with the fact that Tony was now quite noticeably in possession of two 'X' chromosomes. "Something went screwy and got fried when I tried to use it."
"Oh." Tony brightened. "Well, then, I guess we'll just have to see about doing something for lunch then."
But he'd loved him from the start, even before he'd known he was a Stark, that he was the heir to the Stark fortune, that he was expected to take over the Stark Industries empire. No, he was forever and always
"Good," Tony said and clapped his hands together. "Then it's settled." He motioned to a cot in the corner. "There, or—?"
He sighed and went over to the elevator, which opened even without him having to press the button. He smirked a little, the right side of his mouth pulling up, and said, "Yeah, don't think this gets you off the hook. All right, common floor, J. Let me go grab my phone so I can try to track down my missing husband that is
Steve hummed out a thought then said, "I think it's sweet. First song we ever danced to." He was quiet a moment before he added, "I kind of think of it as 'our song,' I guess."
"You people feed off our residual energy," Tony said, and Thor looked at him in amusement. "I suppose that is one way of putting it."
Steve just frowned, a deep furrow forming between his brows. "Is there any of your stuff left in the fridge?"
He did and allowed Steve to lead him over to what he was pretty sure was the bed. When he was close enough, Steve unhooked the leash from the collar then took his bound wrists and held his arms out straight until he felt the telltale feel of the sheets beneath his fingertips.
Barnes left not long after Natasha had, and it was as Bruce, with DUM-E's help, was cleaning up the remnants of cloths and implements and whatever else he'd used in the course of the birth, that he said, "Um, hey, Tony?"
"If you wanted to make some more for her, I'm sure she'd be happy to have it," Steve said and set the bottle down. He wiped the excess formula away from her mouth then tried the bottle again. "I know it's not as good as the stuff Mommy used to give you, dolly, but it's good for you. Or so they say."
"Uh huh," he murmured and relaxed fully into the bed, content with the knowledge that his baby was safe while Steve's scent in the duvet made him feel like he was safe, too. The lights went down, JARVIS seeming to deem that he was deep enough into his relaxed state that he was close to falling asleep, and DUM-E rolled over into what he knew to be his charging station, and the last thing he heard before sleep fully overtook him was Bruce saying, "I guess that's my cue to leave."
Steve pinched his side, wrenching a squealed shriek from him, and he reached back and slapped the side of Steve's ass, the crack of flesh against flesh ricocheting around the room, and said, "You filthy, old man," realizing too late that slapping Steve like that was a sure-fire way of getting him rock-hard again.
Steve laughed and dropped his hands then steered him over to the sink. "Fine. Clean up. Then get changed and cuddle up." He went back over to the toilet and flushed it for Tony, and as Tony pulled out his toothbrush and the toothpaste, he added, "When I get back here, I want to see you comfortable and curled up on the couch and fast asleep."
"I mean, we could probably walk," Tony said as Steve slid into the heated leather passenger seat. Steve didn't even own a car let alone one that had heated leather seats. "But it's after midnight, and we're in Manhattan. It's not Morningside — is that still a bad part? — but I'd rather not take my chances. I don't know about you."
"Yeah, but it was a really neat gimmick," he said and went to take Tony's tablet, seeing no other alternative.
"Five minutes," he said, and understanding what Tony was demanding of him, he jumped up from his seat and said, "I'll be out in two."
contraceptive precautions because, well, why would I? I figured everything would just go back to normal once I got changed back. And I got changed back for two months before I realized that, yeah, I wasn't just getting older. I actually
Something weird constricted in Tony's chest at that. There was a funny tone to the Cap's voice as he admitted that he couldn't sleep, and Tony knew it wasn't something as simple as just not being able to sleep. There was more to it, probably more than even the Cap wanted to admit to himself at that moment in time, and Tony, god help him, almost offered to help him work through that.
Rhodey rolled his eyes and dropped his fork down on his plate, and Tony winced a moment like he thought Rhodey was finally, after all these years, going to deck him for something stupid, but Rhodey just grabbed his own cup of coffee and switched it out for Tony's, saying, "There.
Tony shivered at the feel of Steve's hands on his. Fuck, could he make Steve just keep his hands on him forever? "One," he said, the word coming out as a murmur, and Steve snorted a laugh and said something about how he guessed he'd have to take it then kissed his temple then left the bathroom.
The clerk was silent a moment, hands steepled and mouth resting against his fingertips, before he said, "I honestly can't think of any other way of proving that you're really Tony Stark. I suppose I could make you submit an affidavit signed by two people that have known you at least ten years attesting to the fact that you
She paused in thought a moment, her hands stilling like she was trying to thinking of what next to say.
God, he really hoped he hadn't just spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on fakes. And was it him, or were Other Tony and Tracy kind of weird? Like
"I do," Steve said without question. "Welch is an ass, but he knows the right people — or the right people that would tell him this stuff. Ross tried to get more super soldiers. As I understand it, he ended up with a Hulk and an Abomination—"
"I know you wish you had disposed of him before the King had been crowned and you are now stuck with him. I know you wish you had more control over the King, and it angers you that a
. She thought he would need someone to take care of him and pull him out of the trouble he always got himself into. She knew I couldn't do it forever, and she knew she couldn't do it forever." He looked at Tony. "Boy, she would have loved you."
"Yeah, Steve? Look, I just need you to— No, he's fine. He's OK. We went out for— Yes, he's going to be angry you found out, but right now I need you to— Wait, Steve, listen— Steve, I have to warn you, a reporter spotted us. Huh? Yeah, she, she got something out of him. What? Your appointment at the ob/gyn's. Yeah, Tony wasn't thinking. She was trying to trap him, and he didn't figure it out in time. No, I'm trying to— I'll explain when we get there. Here, I just need you to— Yeah, if you could."
Natasha just shook her head, her face completely devoid of any kind of judgment. "No," she said then smiled briefly, the smile actually meeting her eyes if only for a moment, and added, "I hear it's best for them, anyway. Plus, it helps you two bond."
had rattled her, something she couldn't quite keep off of her face no matter how good she was at making herself look as blasé and neutral as possible as she scrolled through something. DUM-E was off in the corner making sad little whirs, arm down like he was actually depressed about something, but that was par for the course for him. He was
The next thing he knew, it was dusk, and the size and firmness of the thigh he had pillowed his head against had changed, and squinting through tired eyes, he looked up to see a familiar super soldier sitting there, jaw set and eyes hard as read over what was displayed on the tablet he had balanced on the arm of the couch. He must have felt Tony stirring, as he tore his attention away from the tablet and, like the flip of a light switch, the hardness vanished, leaving nothing but a soft tenderness as he looked down at Tony and said, "Hey there, sleepyhead."
"I know what you said, Bruce! Jesus Christ, is that—" He looked at the monitor, and he squinted his eyes, and if he…if he looked at it the right way, if he purposely looked for what he thought he was seeing…
Steve moved his hands to Tony's thighs and hoisted him up, Tony wrapping his legs around his waist, and Steve, barely breaking the kiss, carried him over to the steps, intent on wishing Tony a 'Merry Christmas' in his absolutely favorite way.
Tony shook his head, marveling at the romantic, old-fashioned sap he'd gotten himself mixed up with, and said, "You can take the boy out of the '40s, huh?"
Sam just looked at him pointedly. "Think about what you know about those two and how they communicate."
He shrugged but wouldn't meet Tony's eyes. "I guess I just… I don't know. Maybe?" he said, unsure, then quickly launched into, "I know that sounds weird. I know it
"Princess?" Sharon asked with a laugh, and she glanced to Tony good-naturedly and said, "What, do you turn into a pumpkin after midnight?"
Olivia pursed her lips and put a finger to her mouth. "It 'pends." She began to count off on her fingers. "Sometimes it's 'Steven.' That's when you're telling him stuff and you think you're right. Sometimes it's 'honey' when he's bein' 'xtra stubborn 'bout stuff and you think he's bein' stupid. Sometimes it's 'babe.' That's usually when he comes home and you two
He sprinkled some red sugar on a candy cane, and Tony stared another moment and said, "You're a goddamned troll."
"He is preventing our kingdom from having a God-anointed heir!" the third man said. "The King will not even think of doing right by his people so long as the
He stopped thinking about that as he stuck his head under the showerhead again to rinse the shampoo out of his hair. God, how had he fucked this up so badly? How could he have let this get so far away from him? Captain America should have stayed nothing more than a fantasy to him.
"Hell of a way to treat your family, Stark," Barton said, shoveling cereal in his mouth as he sat perched on the back of the couch. "You know if we never spent any time here, you'd whine to Cap and JARVIS that nobody liked you and nobody wanted to play with you."
Steve just stood there, hand on his belly, and smiled. "Yeah," he said as the little creature thumped against him a few more times, and Tony would be lying if he said there wasn't something equal parts comforting and pleasurable about the way Steve's firm hand sat against his abdomen, both possessive and protective. He moved his hand so it sat atop Steve's, and they stood there, together, hands over each other until the movement settled again.
"Yeah. Seriously, go. Take care of business. Don't worry about me. Besides, if anything happens, I'm sure JARVIS will be more than happy to alert you to it."
Too late. Steve and Barnes were making their way back into the living room, and Barnes was taking the chair once again while Steve sat on the couch, this time on Tony's other side so that Tony was sandwiched between the arm of the couch and Steve. Steve crowded a little into him, and he put his arm around Tony's shoulders and pulled him in to give him a kiss on the cheek and said, "What're you doing?"
Tony felt something shoved against his ear, and from a distance, he heard the most soothing voice imaginable.
"Hey, he ever gives you any trouble, though, you let me know," Rhodey said before he released him from the hug.
Steve hadn't removed his hands from Tony's waist, and he kneaded his fingers in gently and rubbed his thumbs against the satin-covered flesh above Tony's hipbones before he nodded once and said, "OK."
"What Steve didn't know wouldn't hurt him," Hill said plainly, though Tony could tell from the rapid blink of her eyes and the tone of her voice that she was having a hard time admitting to herself the truth of Steve's condition.
gave me the idea? Please. Weren't you the one that said not to buy anything because Steve wouldn't like it?"
Steve nodded, and he swallowed and kissed Tony's forehead again and said, "I'll be back in a bit. Any requests? So long as I can find an open doughnut shop, anyway?"
Tony groaned again and splayed himself out over the table. Yeah, it was a bit overdramatic, but it fit the mood.
Steve just stared at Thor, but Tony rolled his eyes and said, "Yeah, that doesn't make any— First of all, what the hell does this 'bonded' thing mean? And Steve and I are bonded? How the hell are Steve and I bonded?"
where they know how to do this stuff. And Steve will be there every moment of it to hold my hand and tell me how good a job I'm doing and not take offense when I threaten to cut his balls off. Repeatedly."
"So, what are you sketching anyway?" Tony asked as he scowled and did away with the design upgrade that had put USB ports and what looked like a mini-jack for a set of ear buds into the Black Widow suit. What the hell was she going to do with those?
Afterward, with no TV and no Wi-Fi, there wasn't really a whole hell of a lot to do, and Tony honestly wasn't in the mood for sex at the moment. Maybe later, but not right then, which was a little odd considering how horny he'd been lately, but maybe he was still good from what they'd done last night? So, Steve, ever the health-conscious boy scout, suggested they take a walk.
a crapshoot in book-form. Steve hadn't been there, had missed it all, and Tony wasn't sure he would ever not regret that — not wish he'd been the most selfish he'd ever been and begged Steve to stay behind, to choose
"S'all I ask," Steve said and stood from his seat. He reached down and helped Tony from his, and under watchful and prying eyes, Steve led him over to the dance floor crowded with couples swaying and laughing and chatting with each other. He pulled him over toward the bandstand, and he let go of him for a second and asked him to wait before he went over and got the bandleader's attention. The bandleader leaned down as Steve evidently asked him something and then nodded and made some motion with his hand.
Steve gave a curt shake of his head. "I didn't say anything like that. I just said I think she grabbed my ass."
"I'm not crying into a tub of gelato," he muttered and stabbed the spoon into the creamy, frozen custard mixture again, which got an actual laugh out of Natasha.
Tony rolled his eyes again, his fingers grasping the edge of the box in preparation of opening it. "I could actually show you what's in here, or we could debate twist endings to twenty-year-old movies."
Esmeralda waved off Bruce's concern. "Yes, I understand that. As I'm sure your shamans or medicine men will be able to tell you, that body he now possesses is in
Cap, but the Cap that he knew — and so he instead asked "Said you'll be gone yet another week, right?"
The table was too fucking uncomfortable — everything was too fucking uncomfortable — and so he spent much of the next several hours pacing around his lab, a hospital gown Bruce had rummaged up from somewhere covering him and sharp, mind-blowing pains coming at regular intervals. The gown he'd been provided with after his water had broken and soaked through his clothes, and he wasn't sure he'd ever forget the humiliation he'd felt as he'd stood there, fluids leaking out of him as ever-present confusion and slight disturbance spread over Barnes's face as he pointed at Tony's soaked bottom half and said, "Uh, are you having control issues?"
Thor shook his head and sat in an adjacent chair. "Nay, still no word on that most dangerous implement. It is something...much more personal to you and the Man of Iron."
"Eh, you're not missing much, really," Tony said and touched the side of the pot to see if the water had cooled to room temperature yet. He'd been in this kitchen over half-an-hour trying to mix up a bottle for his daughter, and he was about at the point where he was considering asking Thor to go find Nutsy-cuckoo and ask her to change him back again — just until Olivia could subsist on solids, anyway.
He served himself some of the delicious foods Steve had brought home and even deigned to take some of the salad as well, which — of course — did not go unnoticed by Steve, who just gave him a knowing smirk as he watched Tony shove a bite of salad in his mouth.
" to him as they crossed back through the broad expanse of the floor to make their way to the elevator that would take them to another floor that Tony would then put on lockdown until their friends got out of their system whatever it was they were plotting.
She shrugged. "I dunno. You 'r Daddy's usu'lly around. We're not 'lowed to be by ourselves. You 'n' Daddy 're 'fraid someone's gonna try to take us."
Bucky continued to complain about his slight, but Steve stopped listening beyond the 'gonna be around forever' bit. He stole a glance over at Thor, who conveniently was watching whatever corny little stop-animation thing was on the TV and thus wouldn't or couldn't make eye contact with him, and he thought about what Thor had said — about outliving his family, watching his loved ones grow old and wither, the offer to live out his days on Asgard — and he suddenly began to feel very...cold.
"Yeah, OK. Fine. Maybe that— But, uh, there's a 'Wanda.' You know any Wandas? Or Visions, for that matter?"
He fumbled with the catches and was able to get it off, which was quite the feat to do while flat on his back with his legs spread wide, and he dropped it on the floor beside the bed and reached up to cup his own breasts.
"What? So? We're currently in the process of taking in refugees from the hospitals. Just tell someone to bring some of that shit over here when they're coming!"
He scowled at the image that accompanied the brief text about 'Captain America and his Baby Mama,' and Steve shook his head and said, "I don't like that they can do this — make it seem as low-brow and disgusting and
A dream, he realized with no small amount of crushing disappointment. It had all been a dream. A very vivid, very warm, very lovely dream. Of course it was a dream. To believe that Hydra would still exist in 2015! (And wasn't that an odd year to dream about?) Or that he would marry
"Not even a hint." He was smiling as he said it, and he reached out and brushed his hand over Olivia's head, smoothing down the wispy blonde strands. "But trust me. She's
"How would Barton even know?" he snapped and shook his head. "Jesus Christ," he muttered. "This can't be happening to me. You must be reading it wrong."
"God," Tony groaned and twisted just a little to get Natasha to hit a prime spot in his back. "Please don't tell me they expect us to fix that, too."
thing I've ever gone through. I'm almost kind of looking forward to playing dress-up after everything settles back to, well—" He patted the flab of the belly that he still hadn't quite lost.
"Anyway," Tony said and looked at the boxes of food, "and why even— Don't you people get paid enough to get yourselves big, fat Christmas gooses?"
, Tony!" was pretty much all he said as Barnes wheeled the concoction out from the kitchen, wincing at the flicker of sparklers stuck with methodical precision (he'd allowed DUM-E to help him) along the top and sides of the cake, which was done in a mockup of Steve's shield.
He choked out a laugh, unsure of why he even felt the need to do it to begin with, but all that did was break open the dam, and the laugh morphed into something a little more dour and disheartened until he was clutching at the sink, leaning on it, head bowed as he sobbed out all the disappointment and remorse he'd been doing so much to tamp down from the moment he'd realized Bruce had known it was a 'boy' but had still been doing all that he could to get Tony to believe that
"And here I thought maybe you'd watch it for pointers," he said and stepped onto the elevator once it had returned from dropping Rhodey off on Bruce's floor. "And no coffee!" he called out as the doors closed.
"Oh, Brucie," he said with a shake of his head. "Looks like you could have used the patented Natasha Romanoff makeover." He motioned over himself. "This is what happens when you let Nat dress you."
"I just— Because I don't want to say, yeah, OK, that's totally going to happen and then when it doesn't— Look, you didn't spend any time with her, so you—"
"Who knows?" Barton said and pushed at the cereal in his bowl again but didn't scoop up any. "But it's here to stay, Cap, so you'd better get used to it—" he pulled his spoon out of the bowl and pointed it at Steve, "—especially when they're talking about
Bruce had explained to him the way — laughing the entire time — the kid had shown him how this other him and this other Steve Rogers sucked face, and she'd gotten all coy and bashful at dinner when Bruce had asked her if the other him and the other Cap had told each other they loved each other. She, at the least, was very much under the impression that her daddy and her papa loved each other or were in love with each other.
"You can't tell me you want to go again," Steve said, amused smile on his face as he reached up and began to rub his hands up and down Tony's arms.
Natasha bit into her slice of jellied toast and shot him a pointed look, and Tony looked amongst all four of them before he dropped his own slice of toast on his plate and said, "So, I take it Steve isn't wearing his Captain America uniform then?"
The thing was, he didn't want to beg for one, either. That was just tacky. And so he hinted — at Steve, at Bruce, at Natasha, at asshole Barton, and hell, even at Thor — that he wouldn't be averse to a little soiree thrown in his honor if anyone was up to it. Unfortunately, he picked the wrong time to hint to each of them. Steve he brought it up to when Steve was down in the gym breaking one of the heavy bags, no doubt still annoyed by the continued internet presence of #JabbatheSlut. A disinterested 'uh huh' was about the most he got out of him. Bruce he bothered while he was working on something in his lab. At least Bruce was a little more forward, telling him with tired and frustrated eyes, "Tony, I'm trying to work on something here. Could you come back later?"
from that 'verse was able to cross time and space to grab her," he explained, figuring telling the Cap that they were evidently married and the parents of two daughters in another universe would be too much for the old man to handle.
And then Steve brushed his finger against something, and Tony let out the most obscene moan that he was sure had ever been uttered in the history of mankind. Steve mouthed his clit, taking his sweet, sensual time about it, but then he pulled back and began to work it with his thumb, using his other fingers to rub at that
Barnes was once again as uneasy about this as he was, but there was little choice in the matter. There were no other Avengers there, Hill was busy tending to their hundreds of guests and trying to keep in some kind of contact with the others, Pepper was on the other side of the country, and Steve was, if the media was to be believed, fucking
He motioned to what Tony knew was his place setting and saw a large mug of steaming hot coffee sitting there.
He looked up and met Steve's gaze again only to be greeted with not anguish but steely resolve. "All right," Steve said with a resolute nod of his head. "Then that's what we're going to do."
"Not that," Steve said with an audible groan. "I mean can I…" He glanced over to the bassinette before he turned back to Tony again. "Would you mind if I…held her?"
She just looked between him and the receiver then took it and tried to mimic what she'd just seen him do.
Steve just folded his arms and raised an eyebrow at him. "Well, maybe if you didn't put the speakers up there."
"Oh," Steve said and pulled out quickly, and Tony let out a high-pitched cry of desperation. "What did I tell you? You come when I say you come. And you're not allowed to come yet."
He shrugged. "I don't know. Maybe it's been there since I woke up. Before? Last night, now that I think about it? I'm not sure. It's kind of annoying, but I can live with it."
Barton and Wilson paused in mid-action and stared at each other before they both turned to Barnes, and Natasha smiled a bit and put a hand to his shoulder.
Thor shrugged. "I cannot sense it myself, but she can. It is in her nature. It is her gift. As I said, there are those that are bonded and those that are not. She sensed the bond that you and the Captain share. As she understands it, such a bond necessitates conception."
She shrugged. "Nothing much. Pepper wasn't in a very good mood because Tony went spouting that off last night, so every Tom, Dick, and Harry that thinks he's Tony's 'Steve' was harassing the company today—"
Look, he wasn't depressed, all right? Fucking freaked out, maybe, but not depressed. He wasn't about to put a gun in his mouth or anything. Hell, if he wanted that, he could just get himself an abortion — well, so long as Esmeralda wasn't full of shit and he really would die if he got one. For as much as he complained, honestly, he wasn't any more comfortable chancing that than Steve was — not that he'd
He loved that even as a woman, he was still a little taller than Natasha. He didn't often get to use his height to his advantage.
"What?" he asked and tipped his head up to look at Steve, but Steve was stone-cold-serious as he met his gaze.
They remained as they were, Steve lying and Tony half-sitting up, their eyes doing a dance as Tony seemingly contemplated his next movements. Steve didn't want to beg — didn't want to make Tony feel like he was being forced into a decision — but he stared up at Tony and hoped to God that he was conveying to Tony all the love and trust that he knew Tony was searching for.
"Steve can't think straight when it comes to you — no pun intended," she added as he opened his mouth to make a crack about her wording. "It actually worries me what he'll do if anything happens to you that can be directly linked to that witch's spell."
Steve opened his eyes and glanced back and, in the passing streaks of light, watched as Olivia grumbled and pushed her feet against the back of the seat.
Steve gave a slight nod and said, "She's a very sweet woman, and we had a very nice conversation." He went silent for a moment then added, "I think she grabbed my ass."
, they thought wrong. The King and his Chancellor were Godly men, popular and righteous. A request from the King was tantamount to a demand, and while the Church was recently finding itself in a power struggle with the King, the Church elders were not about to sign their names to the fallout that might occur if they did not heed the demand of the King. Not yet. Not over something like this. If that silly and stupid King wanted to be legally wed to his closest advisor, who just so happened to be a man, then so be it. It mattered not to them.
"To him, they might as well be dead. He's a Brooklyn kid, Tony, from the first half of the 20th century. He probably spent as much time at the ball park as he spent at his home."
"Yeah, but he's such a…motor-mouth," Barnes said because clearly he was jealous of Bruce's top spot on Tony's I'm-going-to-kill-the-son-of-a-bitch-when-I-have-the-chance list and had decided to challenge him for the title. "I thought he'd be shrieking out obscenities left and right at everyone."
Tony lay back down on the table, making sure to keep his legs together, and the doctor chuckled a little and said, "You can relax your legs."
"Oh, good, two of them," Tony said. "That makes me feel safe. Hey, uh, happen to know where the rest are?"
His eyes went a little wide in horror as Steve glanced over to Natasha and nodded at her, and Natasha's face went sober and serious as she nodded back and made her excuses to Pepper and Happy. She passed by Wilson, Barnes, and Barton on the way, snagging hold of Barnes's arm, dragging him away from whatever discussion, argument, or pissing match he and Wilson were currently engaged in — and this, of course, did nothing but give Wilson some hollow sense of victory if the proud nod and the grin were anything to go by.
Honestly, what he needed to do was talk to Steve, but, at the same time, the last person he wanted to see right then was Steve. Steve had promised him the world and then only a few hours later had made his choice on who he was siding with, and it wasn't Tony. OK, maybe driving away like he had had been a
"Sure! And hell, you're Captain America! That pretty much guarantees you to be the greatest teacher even known to mankind."
Every eye in the room turned on them, and after a moment of silence, Barton said, "Uh, I just meant it as a power thing. I didn't know it was a sex kink, too." He looked at Steve and added, "Wait, you're not getting off on us calling you 'Cap,' are you?"
"Close enough," he said, surprised that there could ever come a point in some world where he would be able to take out the arc reactor. He wasn't sure how that was possible — did that mean he was able to finally rid himself of all the shrapnel? — and even though it was a bit painful or uncomfortable or maybe caused him slight breathing problems, he had come to accept it as part of him, not as a burden but as a privilege, a terrible privilege but still a privilege.
But Steve just pulled him closer, and Tony put his arms around Steve's shoulders as Steve brought their mouths together, and Steve's hands went to his sides and his back, caressing him, holding him, tongue and teeth and saliva as they kissed slow and intimate, and when Steve finally pulled back a few minutes later, he murmured, "I mean it," his breath ghosting over Tony's mouth as he spoke. "I'd wait another seventy if I had to if it meant I got this at the end of it."
Bruce frowned and began to press his fingers into Tony's abdomen. "I'm thinking it could be appendicitis," he said and pressed a little harder. Tony winced a little, but only because of how odd it felt and not because it actually hurt. Bruce read it wrong, however, and he pulled his hands back and said, "Did that hurt?"
He swallowed and looked up at Steve, meeting his eyes a moment before he said, "Something bad happens. Something— I don't know what, but something bad was happening. You — you were a mess. You were definitely just coming out of the middle of something. Your uniform was all torn up. You had blood all over you. You just looked beaten up."
The room went oddly quiet at that, and Tony turned and stared at their blank looks in a little confusion before Bruce cleared his throat and said, "Oh, yeah, that's mine. I, uh, I was going to write down some things I thought we needed from the store, and I, uh—" He scratched the back of his head. "Didn't I write anything?"
Not that it meant anything. Whatever. Alternate universe. That he was totally going to work on getting her back to when she went to sleep. Which hopefully would be halfway through whatever movie they could finally settle on.
"Whatever," Tony muttered and rolled his eyes but then set a sharp gaze on Barnes. "What's this about 'magic words'?"
"Jesus," Barton muttered and pushed his chair away from the table. He left the room, and the others looked at each other in slight confusion for the few moments it took Barton to return, a small paperback book in his hands.
Tony really didn't want to think about 'Antonia' in this context — that was something only Steve got to call him — and so he huffed and said, "Tony. Just call me 'Tony.'"
Natasha's face went a little softer. "That's not the only reason to do it. Honestly, maybe if you see it, it'll make it a little realer to you."
Steve glanced up from his tablet and eyed the TV with unease, shoving the slice of bacon in his mouth as he did so.
"Eh, we all need hobbies. Nat has her ballet. Wilson does group therapy. Bruce seems to think he's a horticulturalist. Thor's a little
Steve met his gaze again but didn't deny Tony's insinuation. Instead, he said, "I was used to loss, you know? Never knew my dad. Ma died. Didn't have anyone else besides Bucky and his family. I mean, there was Peggy, but she… Then Buck— And then I put the plane into a nosedive. Thought I was going to die. Ended up waking up so far into the future there was nothing of my life left for me. Everyone was dead or— And then came the Avengers. And you. And even though I can still remember that dream and how
Natasha just shook her head a little and murmured something in Russian as she went about applying the first coat to Tony's toes.
"It's in the blood," Tony said, but he was smiling at Steve as he said it. He then made a 'hmm' sound and grabbed another small, black, rectangular thing and pointed it at the sideboard on the far wall. Music started streaming from somewhere in the vicinity — more of those supposed Christmas songs — and Tony said, "Too quiet. Besides, last day we can listen to this crap, anyway. Wait, wasn't I supposed to be recording this?" He thought about this a moment then shrugged. "Oh, well. Maybe next year."
Cap closed his mouth and nodded some, and Tony swore he saw a slight rose tinge come over the tips of his ears and the apples of his cheeks, like he was embarrassed but was trying to hide it.
This was the little girl that had come into his life like a whirlwind and left just as quickly, the little girl that had gotten him wrapped around her little finger in record time, the little chatterbox that had unwittingly ruined one good relationship on him only to help steer him into the arms of the best thing that had ever happened to him. This was her, this tiny little ball of righteous fury, the one he'd convinced himself for so long he could never have and was never his to begin with. But she was. She was his, and she'd always been his, and here she was back where she belonged, back in the embrace of the man that had braved time and space to steal her back, the one that had met her long before Tony ever had.
"Uh, the fourteenth, I think. August fourteenth. That's what Doctor Ganford said before. Weren't you listening to her?"
Steve swallowed, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down, and he took a steadying breath and said, "Are you sure?"
"Whatever," he muttered and pressed closer to Steve, resting his head on his shoulder as he rocked with Steve to a rhythm that didn't fit the song that was playing oh-so-quietly around them. "J?" he murmured into the darkness. "Maybe change it up to something more appropriate for slow dancing?"
"Why? What is it? What's wrong?" Steve asked, sensing something from Thor's tone that had gone clear over Tony's head. Thor focused his gaze on Tony, almost as though he was inspecting him, before he turned his attention to Steve.
"Hmm…" he said as he crunched on the drywall shavings. "Not the worst thing in the world," he told his sleeping daughter. "Milk adds kind of a sweetness to it. Still think I'm going to chip a tooth, and I'm trying really,
"The Iron Man faceplate. Kind of our way of being ridiculously possessive of each other. Nat thinks we have a problem. Wilson thinks it might be unhealthy. Banner just sighs a lot over it. Barton calls us 'Stony' like he thinks he's the cleverest son-of-a-bitch ever to walk the face of the earth. Rhodey thinks you're either an idiot or a saint. Pepper and the One-Armed bastard, strangely enough, seem to be the only people that don't give us any grief over our life choices.
Steve just folded Tony's legs and began to finger Tony's hole, sliding one in and gently working him like he'd done so many times in the past. Tony sucked in a sharp breath with the first finger, but he relaxed a little once Steve had begun to stretch him in earnest, first one, then two, and then three, pushing in further every now and again to brush against that most sensitive area that, true to what he'd remembered, made Tony gasp and mutter a, "Fuck,
"I don't know why it's not..." he said, the words sounding as clouded as he was sure Tony's mind was right now, and deciding they didn't have time for that, he switched his comm back on again then ordered JARVIS to fly the Iron Man armor back to the Tower.
"Yeah, fine," Sam muttered then whispered to the baby in his arms, "OK, as soon as I put you in his arms, you force out the biggest, stinkiest poop you can manage. Yeah? Can you do that for your Uncle Sam — your cool Uncle Sam—"
And Tony… Steve was good. Steve was very good. Steve was phenomenal. Hell, he'd volunteer Steve to teach a class on cunnilingus if he didn't think it would probably break some moral decency laws. But he'd heard it mumbled over the years that only a woman seemed to know what worked for her own body, and, truth be told, Tony kind of believed that. Because while Steve was
To his confusion, Tony just sighed and dropped his gaze to the floor. "Damn it," he muttered, and Steve's senses went on heightened alert. He tried to prepare himself for the fight that would come next, but a kid in his arms kind of complicated things.
He decided not to ask, feeling that to do so would be just too embarrassing a maneuver for him. Instead, he focused on another word that had caught his attention but made no sense to him.
As it turned out, Doctor Ganford wasn't able to lend Bruce an ultrasound machine — well, not one she was willing to have transported back to the Tower.
Natasha just nodded and moved over to his side, but Tony instinctively shared a look with Barnes, who could not have looked more uncomfortable by that prospect if he tried.
"Did you eat anything? We found a pizza place a few miles away. Not very good, but it's in the kitchen if you're interested."
"And what the fuck do you mean 'not much pain'?" He looked back down at his tablet. "Says right here women that have never done this before usually have more pain
"He just said he doesn't know for certain what happens," Jim cut in. "Just what old man Odin probably told him as a bedtime story."
But then he'd crashed a plane in the Arctic in 1945 and woken up in New York in the new millennium, and it turned out the one thing he thought was unfixable about him wasn't wrong after all. He wasn't
Tony exhaled a heavy, sad breath. "Tell you the truth, Cap, until a week ago, I hadn't really given it any thought."
"No," Rhodey said with a curt shake of his head. "I didn't say that. It just turns out that you and Steve are one of those really annoying married couples."
struggling with their identity, and you know what? Fuck you, I could be a real girl. I mean, technically I
"You, uh, you get your results?" he asked, deciding that it would be better to work up to the making love rather than just grabbing Tony and slamming him down on the nearest flat surface like a goddamned caveman. Much as the latter was a very appealing prospect to him at the moment.
Part of him thought that they should be more concerned with, well, some random magical being turning Tony into a woman and then disappearing, but there was another louder and lazier part of him that told him not to worry about it. It probably wouldn't last too long, and even if it did, it wasn't like it was hurting Tony in any way. Sure, the novelty would wear off after a while, and Tony would be desperate to get back into his own body, but it wasn't making him sick, and it wasn't killing him, and, so far as he was aware, he hadn't been marked as a virgin sacrifice or mate for some Lovecraftian Great Old One, so if Tony had to remain in a woman's body for a while, then so be it. It wasn't the end of the world. It was just...inconvenient, he decided as he finally left the now-darkened workshop and made his way over to the elevator where Tony stood waiting for him, hands on his hips and unimpressed look on his face like Steve was taking too much time and delaying his fun.
She nodded and strode across the room, that strange tinkling sound following after her. She came to a stop before the large floor-to-ceiling plate glass windows, and she looked out over the dreary cityscape of a mild but rainy Christmas Day and said, "The Son of Odin says you are troubled."
future me. Well, I mean, I'm the past version of future me. I think I'd know what future me is thinking better than you, and right now, I don't think there's any problem with us discussing my future self's sex life — or lack thereof."
He met Steve's eyes, determined, resolute, a gnawing fire in his belly and a desperate need to have this man inside of him. He'd heard it was a natural desire come this time of the...
When it was over and they all had stepped back behind the curtain to assess the situation, he smiled up at Steve and said, "See? Was that so bad?"
But what sucked — what fucking sucked more than anything — about it was that it wasn't by choice. It had been done to him against his will, and he shivered at the very thought that someone could have that much control over him. So, he didn't think about it. In fact, he tried to pretend like it hadn't even happened. That he hadn't been turned into a woman. That the rest of the team didn't see him any differently.
Steve nodded and dunked another fry in ketchup then stuck it in his mouth. "Yeah, but didn't I see chocolate's supposed to be good for you?"
It was as he was browsing the headlines for the day's news that he felt eyes on him, and he shot a surreptitious glance to his left and saw two women sitting several tables away (along with another one that was completely oblivious), trying to hide behind their food as they stared at him. He had a sneaking suspicion they were the same two from the bathroom, but not wanting to cause a scene (no, seriously), he continued to look over his phone as he waited for Steve to arrive with his bounty. But he could still feel their stares burning a hole into his temple, and forgetting his previous promise, he turned to them, petulant, lips pursed into a tight smile, and tilted his head as though to ask a bitchy, "
...at communicating his feelings," she eventually murmured, her fingers starting up again. "I'm sure if they had awards for those sorts of things, he'd sweep the competition every year. He needs to make things right with Barnes. He failed him once; he can't allow himself to fail him again. But he needs you by his side to do it. He doesn't just want you to support him, he
And then, because God hated him, Tony leveled him with a probing look and said, "Have you ever been in love, Steve?"
Steve rubbed the back of his neck. "Yeah, Buck— Uh, Bucky told me about that. It was a little weird for him, too." He looked up at Tony. "But you seem to have worked past—"
"They're..." Steve tried to think of the right word. "Sharp. I mean they're... They don't glow, ah, warm or—"
Tony rolled his eyes, and Bruce directed him over to the couch. "You can't tell me you've never done this before. You mean to tell me you never encountered this during your philanthropic backpacking tour of Calcutta?"
"Nothing," Natasha said without looking up from her tablet, but Barnes glanced away and wouldn't meet his gaze. He stared at Barnes a moment longer then turned back to Natasha.
"Then everything can go back to the way it was, and you can go back to sucking my cock, and I can go back to standing up to pee. Seriously, squatting is
"My Antonia," he murmured and pressed kisses from one shoulder to the other, hands splaying over his back and around to cup his breasts. "My Antonia Natasha. You're just— You know, I really feel like you were made just for me. Honestly, I do. I feel like you were created just for me, just this perfect, perfect partner for me. So perfect. So gorgeous. So, I don't know,
would end at that point. Tony would still be a woman, as he was one now and forever, but at least the most uncomfortable aspects of it would be over with. Or what he presumed were the most uncomfortable aspects of it. He really didn't have the background to be able to say, but he was pretty sure what he was and had been going through since, really, last November was pretty fucking uncomfortable.
"The amount that I needed. Are you OK?" Bruce said and crowded him a little in concern. Tony waved him off.
"Be a terrible thing," Steve agreed and rubbed gentle hands over Tony's back, dipping down to the small of his back and the rise of his ass. He ran his hands down, digging his fingers into the firm flesh of Tony's gorgeous behind, Tony's interest in their endeavor making itself known as it pressed into his thigh.
"Everything that just happened over the last two days, and you're just shrugging your shoulders and saying it's no big deal?"
His asshole friends had decided that he and Steve weren't allowed to see each other until the actual ceremony.
Arms resting on the table and holding the slice of pizza over her plate, she nodded a little shyly and said, "Yeah," in the most bashful way that Tony didn't think she was capable of.
He shot them both annoyed and perplexing looks before he muttered, "Whatever, fine, I'll get it. Is this it?"
The scene from the movie flashing through his mind — yeah, he knew now why he'd wanted to crack the remote — he flexed his hands a little, frustration thrumming through his body, and instead of going back upstairs to spend time with his family — his aging family — he wrapped his hands back up and took out his— his— he didn't even know what the word was for it, but he took it out on one of the heavy bags, not stopping until he'd punched it off the mount, sand pouring from the hole he'd torn in it.
"I know," Steve said again, picking up his fork and cutting into his food without taking his eyes off the baby. "God, she's so tiny."
"They stick you guys on everything, don't they?" Barnes said and looked at Steve, but Wilson just humphed and folded his arms.
Thor chuckled some more, and he said, "I believe this is where your bonded would say that you can take the man out of the Depression but you cannot take the Depression out of the man."
Steve just looked up and gave Barton a disapproving look while Thor read aloud from the instruction manual, and Barton looked back to Tony for confirmation that he wasn't wrong and letting Steve and Thor assemble the chair was a bad idea, but Tony shrugged and said, "I have to imagine it's idiot-proof."
He took a breath and nodded for Tony to hold out his left hand. He did so, and Steve very gently took hold of his hand to steady it and slid the band of gold down to the hilt of his ring finger. He made sure it was secure and then pulled Tony's hand up to his mouth and kissed the ring, gently brushing his lips over Tony's knuckles after he'd done so.
She just made a face and rolled her eyes, pushing her way in between Tony and Rhodey and sitting down between them. She pointed to the baby and said to Rhodey with the utmost seriousness in her voice, "That baby's mine next," before she turned to Tony.
, Jim. And I don't mean the kind that cross the border from Mexico. I flew through a portal suspended two hundred feet above my roof—" He swallowed the nerves and the bile that plagued him at that thought. Later. He could do his freak-out later. "I fought side- by-side with a god of Norse mythology. Is an alternate universe really all that far-fetched in comparison?"
"You do this on purpose, don't you?" he teased as he reached in and picked her up. He carried her over to the changing table and set her down, moving his arms out of the way of her grabby little hands as he reached out for the assorted sundry items that he needed. Fresh diaper, wipes, and baby powder at the ready, he set about changing her diaper, finding that, yes, it did become easier and easier the more he did it—
. I think he thinks people are a little too casual with the fucking now. Calling it 'making love,' I think to him, makes it mean more. It's not just sex, it's more than that. Yeah, we do some pretty…dirty stuff, I'll be honest here. But it's not just sex for him. It's something more than that. It's…"
He shook his head and used another fry to soak up some of the juice on his plate. "No, came in by jet. Haven't been downstairs since yesterday."
Barton shrugged and turned back to the stove. "In the face," he replied. "Your face is fuller, kinda fleshed out. That's one sign."
"How do you know? We're 'bondmates' or whatever," he said, using finger quotes on the word. "Maybe if we're not within arm's reach of each other at all times, we die?"
Thor took it all with good humor, finding Barnes' questions more amusing than insulting, and somewhere along the line, Barnes had clearly come into familiarity with '50s sci-fi movies, especially considering the, "Hey, Klaatu barada nikto, man," he'd offered him one time during an argument, which went over both Thor's and Steve's heads and prompted a late-night watch of
Tony ignored that, though, and focused on the kiss and what he could hopefully feel from it. It was relatively chaste for one of Steve's kisses, sweet and gentle with very little tongue, and Tony grabbed Steve's hand and put it against his abdomen, thinking maybe that would do it.
"Chances are they're already far ahead of whatever we could even begin to counteract," Hill said. "Our best bet might be to let the next two fall and try to head them off at the third."
"I can only speak for myself," he finally said, "but it's a lot more...fun...with someone you love. Especially if that someone's a dirty old man."
He reached out and grabbed his phone from the table, though Rhodey just pinched it between his fingers and took it from him. "Uh," he said and turned to his oldest friend. "Who said you could do that?"
He cried out in delight as he grasped hold of it, and Tony smiled and settled into the bed and said, "Just like a boy scout. Always prepared."
"It wasn't anything like that. It was just… You know sometimes, even now, it still feels like…That stuff only happened a few years ago for me. It's been decades for everyone else."
"The stubbornness," he said as he swallowed down the remnants of the gulp. "I was a very easy- going child. I'm going to assume you weren't."
, and he was more interested in punching a bag than he was having a serious adult discussion with me."
Warmth surrounded him, soft, comfortable warmth. He stretched his legs out and recognized the sensation as being tucked into a bed. He stretched his right arm out and smacked against something hard that his mind took to be a bedside table. Whatever was atop it, probably a lamp and an alarm clock and other sundry items, rattled from the hit. His other arm was curled around a form — a human form — snuggled up against him, and Steve opened his eyes and looked down to see a messy, dark head using his chest as a pillow, an arm thrown over his abdomen as though to hug Steve. His arm still around this person invading his space, he spread his palm out flat against the person's back and felt over the sharp angles of bone and muscle he found.
Tony ever-so-slightly tightened his hold on his baby and averted his gaze, knowing that Barnes was talking about what he — or more the Winter Soldier — had done to his parents and really, really,
"Sweet! Bagels!" Barton said as he bounded into the kitchen, Thor at his heels. Both took seats at the island and began to fight over the bagels and the various plain and flavored cream cheeses, and Tony rolled his eyes while Steve pressed a kiss to the crown of his head.
it," he stressed again. "It's… It's weird, all right? And it's uncomfortable. And it takes a lot of getting used to. I'm still not used to it. Look, I'm sorry if I'm not acting the way all the articles online say I'm supposed to be acting. But I just… That's not me, all right? Rubbing my stomach and telling it how much I love it isn't me. Singing fucking lullabies isn't me. I'm still trying to come to terms with the fact that this is something that's been done to me that wasn't my choice and this is the way I'm going to be the rest of my life and— What? Wait,
Steve just gave him a flat, sour look in return, like he was humoring Tony but wasn't happy about the situation overall.
"And then you hit a certain point when you realize there are limits to what you can do," Steve cut in, arching an eyebrow at Thor.
Still, the idea was to play this off as casual — as normal and natural and something they weren't even thinking twice about. Getting Tony out in public as he was — as he would forever be now — not hiding it, not acting like they were ashamed of it, making small talk and such with what the public knew to be Tony Stark's comrades and compatriots — his friends, his
Tony turned around again to say he would be fine and he didn't need anyone, but even he could admit to himself that was a filthy lie, so he just nodded and turned back around again to leave, and he was pretty sure he didn't imagine Bruce muttering, "I can't wait until Steve gets back."
She frowned and stuck her bottom lip out as she bounced in her chair a little bit. "Pwease, Papa? Pwease can I stay there still? I'll be good. I won't beat up any bad guys. I promise."
," Wilson said through gritted teeth, "we weren't going to say anything about that in front of the Cap?"
"How 'bout I take you home, and then I'll go out and get some gelato for you. It might not be the exact kind that you want—"
"Honey, you've got to give him time. He's not going to snap back to his old self overnight. Hell, he might never snap back to his old self."
Without thinking, he let his hand slip down to his belly, and he brushed his fingertips over the swell.
to do (though he was 99.99% sure he never would have chosen it or wanted it if presented with the opportunity), but being forced into it, being coerced into it, well, that was… He supposed there were words for that, but he really,
They finished breakfast after that and lazed around a little more, and by that time it was approaching the noon hour, and with resigned sighs and grunts, they pulled themselves from the bed and clambered into the shower to freshen up, and it was as Tony was walking back into the bedroom with a towel wrapped around him just under his armpits and a towel tied up in his hair that Pepper and Natasha let themselves into the suite, barging into the living room with a garment bag and another smaller traveling bag stuffed to the gills.
Tony grinned and began running specs for something he'd been working on for Natasha. "He'll never admit it, but yeah, he's about the only person he trusts with that stuff."
— before he slid in beside Tony and closed the door behind him. Tony just glared at him, but Steve ignored him and instead leaned forward to give the address to the driver in that damned, thick Brooklyn accent he used when he was trying to disguise himself, which honestly made him look like such an asshole the way he was dressed that Tony was almost —
Rhodey just shook his head, and Tony quirked his head a little and said, "No, I changed my mind. I'm going with Sly and the Family Stone."
Barnes just nodded silently, either humbled and moved by Tony's words or smart enough to bite his tongue when he knew he would never get the last word anyway.
"Humph," Tony muttered and made the last cut into the dough. "OK, maybe not complete. Look, once I get these cookies onto the sheet, sprinkle some of that sugar on them and stick them in the oven."
"Have we been here before?" he asked as he followed Tony down the sidewalk. He saw a lighted awning up ahead that looked like it had the name 'Spring Palace' printed on it, so he figured that was the storefront they were heading toward.
feel right. And then I find out that I'm pregnant. I'm a man, and I'm pregnant. I have a uterus and a fetus growing inside me. And then the troublemaker that turned me into a woman in the first place comes back, turns me back into a woman, and tells me not only can I not terminate this pregnancy, but I have to carry it to term unless I want to prematurely end my life. Because she claims she's bound the parasite's life with mine. Because she says my fiancé and I are 'soul mates,' and this is what all 'soul mates' want. Because she's insane.
Tony wasn't sure whether or not the words were met with a dour response or snickering from the dark humor of it all. The moment the word 'frozen' had hit his ears, he saw a chirpy little blonde in a purple t-shirt sitting on his couch and singing out a three-year-old's rendition of 'Let It Go.'
Tony stopped at the door, Steve right beside him. "Uh, we just drove god knows how many hours to the middle of Bumfuck, Nowhere, and you don't even know if it's going to
"Whatever," he muttered and sat back against the chair. "Order up some bras in the right size. It does feel a little…unprotected without one."
She merely shrugged but said nothing to that and instead nodded her head toward the bed and said, "Why don't you go take a nap?"
Hill nodded, and Tony glanced between them for an answer before Natasha said, "Stockings," and left it at that.
"You know, I really didn't think I'd have to worry about that," he admitted as Olivia let out a small burp with not one drop of spit-up to show for it. Thankfully.
Steve made a face, and he gave a slight hand motion as though to demonstrate as he said, "The, ah, the
Tony pushed out of his chair and went over to the counter where DUM-E had left the blender carafe with the smoothie mixture in it.
Steve joined beside him, folding his arms as well but standing upright instead of leaning onto the chair. "It's a very thoughtful gesture, but you really didn't need to get us a wedding cake."
"You would," Tony grumbled but nestled his head further into Steve's shoulder and continued to sway with him as the romantic music of the verse swelled into the chorus. He closed his eyes after a few moments of swaying with Steve and the baby, and a few moments after that, he felt Steve's warm lips pressing against his forehead.
And was promptly given reason to never, ever cradle their child in his arms without wearing at least a t-shirt.
Steve smiled lazily at him and rubbed a gentle hand over the bed covers right where Tony's leg was. "Outside of the fact that the media again ran with a story they never should have run, I seem to recall something similar happening to you out in Malibu."
Before either Tony or Bruce could say anything, she ran over to the table beside the couch that Tony had put in the lab, and she stopped cold and stared at the table before she turned back and said, "Papa! That man stolded my pitcher!"
"That it was a girl," Tony said without fanfare and motioned to the baby cuddled in Rhodey's arms. "That she was a girl."
Tony smiled at him, his heart warming from the sincerity of the words, but he just waved Steve off and said, "I love you, too. Go. Before too many people wake up and you find yourself tricked into handing out bottled water at a firehouse or something."
But that was a move borne out of a defensive measure. So long as he didn't just get swindled, he had no reason to be defensive any longer. He would age the same as Tony would now. Sure, he would always look a good dozen or so years younger than Tony, but the gulf that had been formed between them and had grown at an ever-increasing rate from the moment they'd met would grow no longer. Steve would age the same as Tony would. They would get to grow old together, and if what Esmeralda was saying was true, they had another forty years together to find that out firsthand.
He frowned, a dancing robot in his hand, and took several cautious steps over to the radio or whatever it was that the sound was coming from. He listened to it, noting the phrasing and the way the instruments were timed.
She stuck the glob of cheese in her mouth and began to chew, and Tony added the names to the ever-growing list of people he might have to deal with in the future. He was still pretty sure she was from another dimension.
Barton shrugged and folded his arms while Tony grabbed onto the ankles of the suit and began to pull.
"And what do you wish me to do about that? You distrust the Chancellor and think him to be using the King to take over a kingdom that had been promised to him by the King's father."
She sighed a little and checked her watch. "OK, half-an-hour," she said. "I have a Board meeting at one-thirty."
He didn't bother to acknowledge him. He just lay there curled up on his side, the little monster inside of him doing his evening workout, though, like before, he did find something almost comforting about the movements — almost as though, if nothing else, at least he had this.
Steve sighed as he set his brown-bagged lunch down on the security station's counter. "See what?" he asked a too-excited Sam. Bucky just rolled his eyes and muttered, "Oh,
Steve didn't answer him, and Tony about jumped out of his skin when he heard the unmistakable sound of a tree branch snapping beneath a foot on the other side of the road. He stopped to turn, but Steve said, "
you got, the more real it got, and then just everything I was reading, I… I don't know." He shrugged, almost embarrassed, and kept his gaze on the baby in his arms. "I was kind of looking forward to it. I wanted to be there with you. I wanted to be there when my own child was born. I wanted to be the first person — OK, maybe not the
Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes, pushing those previous thoughts from his mind. "No, I programmed him to actually be useful. He must have gotten hit by a bolt of lightning and it fried his circuits."
Steve shifted his gaze back to Tony and watched as the program mapped out the contours of his body, Steve's own artist's eye soaking in each and every dip and curve of Tony's new figure and itching to draw what he found — from the jut of his chin to the peak of an erect nipple to the soft curve of his abdomen to the small mound of hair — and nothing else — between his legs.
"Can't. Don't Ask, Don't Tell is dead as a doornail, and according to the laws of the State of New York, we're very definitely married. Hell, even the Supreme Court says it's legal now nationwide. Yeah, there's a lot that's changed about society, babe. Some things you're going to love; other things…not so much."
Steve finally found the courage to look up at him, and now that he was looking at Tony — and not, well, checking him out — he could see the telltale flush of arousal that spread from his cheeks down to his chest. There was a slight look of confusion in his brown eyes like he wasn't quite sure why he should be feeling like this, but more than that, Steve saw the hunger of lust in his dark irises, which sent a shot of need right down to his groin, and he grimaced at the pang of desperate want that throbbed inside him, only because there was a rational part of him that knew he really, really, really shouldn't have been feeling this way at that moment.
Tony dug a spoon into the gelato and paused before sticking it in his mouth. "I'm sorry. It is the most disgusting time of year, I have a twenty-pound weight strapped to my front, I haven't been able to see my feet since the beginning of May, am I
"You told me to be as factual with you as possible, so here it is: It's Christmas Day 2015. We're at our home-away-from-home upstate. Why? Because you're a sap, and I'm a sucker. This," he motioned to the toddler in his arms, "is Olivia. Our daughter. She's sixteen months old and too stubborn for her own good. She gets that from you— Could you please stop looking at me like you're going through all fifty ways you know to snap my neck in two steps or less? Trust me,
"Oh, you don't know what you're missing. Greasy spoons are the best. They're not worried about all that arugula and bean sprout and other health-food crap. Nope, just good, old-fashioned butter and lard."
Clint rolled his eyes and, as Steve strolled into the kitchen, said, "Hey, Cap, your spoiled-as-fuck other half just hit me with a spoon."
"Yeah, so, anyway, I'm good. You don't have to be up here any longer if you don't want to be. I know you've got more important things to deal with."
"Yes, it is," Natasha agreed, but Tony didn't know if she actually agreed or was just humoring him. "But, look, you need some time too cool down, and as well-intentioned as Steve is, I don't know if he's the best one to do that for you right at the moment."
His hands left Tony's shoulders, and Tony next felt him undoing the bonds around his wrists. He wasn't afraid to admit that he frowned a little at this, as he liked the feeling of being tied and under Steve's control, but then he felt his arms being repositioned behind his back, and Steve told him to hold the position while he went around to the other side of the bed. Tony felt the bed dip with Steve's weight as he came up behind him, and he felt the silk wrap around his wrists again as Steve redid the bindings.
them. Cap was of that generation that was too proud to take a handout, and though Tony saw the items more as a gift, he wasn't sure that the Cap would
He shoved his hands in his pockets and shrugged. "I know you're not as much of a jerk as you want people to think you are."
Hey, he'd finally gotten that promised massage after all. Just…not from the person he'd wanted to get it from.
He left through the back and swung around to the street to make the short jaunt to the subway station, and it was as he approached the front of the stately old building that he spotted an unfamiliar car parked at the curb, a man leaning against it and staring down at a phone in his hands. Steve was about to pass him by and continue on until he realized that while he didn't recognize the car, he recognized the man—
Tony hummed a little in thought then said, "She understands more than she can say, but as you can hear, she tries to say as much as she can."
Finger quotes. Barnes used fucking finger quotes on the word 'dating.' Even Steve didn't know how to properly use finger quotes.
knew what had been going on with the Avengers the past few months and, evidently, didn't think much of either him
The little girl tugged at her shirt so it was splayed out over her torso, and with dawning horror filling his gut, she pointed to the Captain America emblazoned there and said, "That's Daddy," before she moved her small finger over to a fierce-looking Iron Man and added, "That's Papa."
"All right," Happy said, like he didn't approve but didn't have a choice, and he circled the car around before he drove up and out the exit ramp. Tony made sure the car was clear then hit the button to shut and lock the doors, the elevator doors opening immediately thereafter.
Steve left after that with one final reminder that he would be just up in the penthouse, DUM-E whirring a little in disappointment as he watched Steve leave, and then Tony was left alone with Barnes for the first time, well,
Steve dug his fingers into the soft and sensitive flesh beneath Tony's thighs, and Tony gasped and began to fondle his breasts, squeezing and tweaking the nipples and rubbing them between his thumb and forefinger, all in the way he was embarrassed to admit felt really damned good, sending quivers of pleasure all the way down to parts of him that had been grossly underserved up to this point of the evening.
Whatever, the point was that the longer the hours dragged on, and the longer they went from hearing from the man himself, the harder it got to convince himself that his gut feeling was 'right' and the news reports were 'wrong.' He still didn't
Steve grimaced because Tony's back was to him and he couldn't see it. "Sure, honey," he said, his words completely belying what even he could admit was a wary tone of voice.
Not that he was that egotistical that he thought Steve should spend his time talking about nothing but the man or woman or whatever the fuck he was that Steve claimed was the love of his life. But it might have been nice to have
The guy crowded him some more and reached out to rest a hand at Tony's hip. Tony tried to pull away from him — seriously, what in the
Steve looked up again. He met Steve's fierce, blue gaze, and Steve just stared back at him, resolute, and said, "I mean it. I ever see that man again, I'm knocking him into next week."
He opened his eyes and furrowed his brow at his surroundings. This…didn't look like his bedroom. It didn't look like his bedroom in
anymore, and he says he knows that, but I'm not really sure he does. And everyone else has been, I don't know,
Tony just stared at him, blinking. From somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew that. He knew that was going to happen, but it really wasn't actually something he ever thought about happening — not to him, anyway. He remembered another internet search that had led to a message board and discussions about all sorts of weird stuff other women had passed through after giving birth, and he looked back down at the pad and the underwear resting at the foot of the bed and realized what an absolute ass he had been for ever thinking negatively about the female menstrual cycle. Not that he could actually think of any scenarios where he'd ever used it against a woman, but if he had, he regretted it immensely.
— all listen to you. Everyone listens to Captain America. You're the only one that can corral that passel of misfits and turn them into something resembling an actual team. Even I can't do that."
Tony scratched at his jaw. "Yeah, well, wasn't sure how well our hedonistic new millennium sensibilities would mesh with your old-fashioned 1940s Norman Rockwell values. You're not yelling at us to repent our ungodly ways, though, so I guess that's a good sign."
Howard was being an ass as usual. They were going to the airport. He hadn't given it any thought. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary. He couldn't have known it would be the last time he'd ever see them.
"Just have a seat," the nurse said, a warm smile on her face as she motioned them into the room. "The doctor will be right with you."
Ordinarily, the age JARVIS claimed he physically appeared to be, he would say he, as a woman, had a good ten breeding years left. But if the Goofball Esmeralda could turn him into a fucking woman — and de-age him at that — who was to say she couldn't keep him from aging? Keep him the thirty-six that JARVIS claimed he was? Keep him and continue to breed him with Steve until they had their little army — or they had enough specimens they could breed from that?
"That's the version everyone knows. Are you sure?" Tony stepped a little further into the room and frowned at Steve.
Anthony was an intelligent young man, but he also possessed a naiveté. Too often he had fallen into the trap of people that had wanted nothing from him but his name and his money. The Council had had to disentangle him from many an ill-match over the course of his young life, all because the young Anthony was a giver and a lover and a dreamer. Intelligent and cunning and a wise leader, yes, but also one that could easily fall into the charms of someone out to seek power, influence, and even the crown from him.
No, no, that was still definitely labor and childbirth, painful and exhausting as it had been. That… was definitely not something he could have
"You did!" Tony crowed, amazement filling his voice. "Steven Stark-Rogers, I'm going to wear you down yet!"
"No," Tony said with a sigh, "and I've just now come to the conclusion that I've told you way too much already. They don't, but a couple of the others do. None of them live at the Tower with us, though, which is probably a good thing — for the kids, I mean. Safer that way. Livvy's the only one that's there all the time."
"Well, no more than might be had in what your kind might consider a more 'conventional' situation. Besides," she said and stepped up to Tony, going around Steve as she reached a hand out to Tony's abdomen and drew an index finger from his lower abdomen up to his heart, "these lives are connected and have been from the moment of conception. Where one ceases to exist, so shall the other."
"Do you guys seriously hear yourselves?" Tony asked Dumb and Dumber as another person showed up in Natasha's apartment, and Tony glanced back to see a contrite-looking Steve letting himself in. His eyes were trained on Tony until something in the periphery caught his attention, and he stopped just to the side of the couch and looked over at where Barnes was still sitting on Wilson's lap, 'contrite' turning sober and serious.
"I just know these things, OK? Short of shooting you up with drugs, really the only thing you can do is let nature take its course."
"Yeah," Tony said as Barton wiped out the pan and began the process of cooking up some eggs for himself. "Down on the communal floor, which this is not."
"I don't know what you're talking about," Steve said with a laugh then pulled the empty bottle away from the baby and set it down on the counter.
They went down to the garage in the basement of the building, and Tony hit the button on the fob to unlock the R8. The lights flashed, and he made to go over to the driver's side, but Natasha gently nudged him aside and, when he wasn't paying attention, took the fob off of him.
Wilson stared at him like he couldn't believe what had just happened, and he shook his head again and said, "
Ella hummed in agreement then said, "Well, no one's come forward with any information on her." She motioned to the other panels and added, "As you can see, she was very popular with the music scene of the time. It's a shame what happened to her. Could you imagine the beautiful prints we would have had of Woodstock?"
"Really?" Steve asked him, flat and a little disappointed and still red with embarrassment, the tips of his ears gone adorably pink with mortification.
"Steven," Tony said, his voice even but serious, "get out of that train of thought. It wasn't your fault. You did everything you could. I know you just lost him, and I know this makes me sound like a complete asshole, but all the blame in the world that you heap on yourself isn't going to bring him back. Mourn him, sure, but don't deny yourself happiness because of circumstances beyond your control. Would he want you do to that?"
"Even if he wants nothing more than to provide for you — to allow you the freedom to pursue your interests?"
"I don't have a problem with you marrying a man, Tony," Bruce said. "I just don't think it's something you'd want us discussing."
But before he could duck out of the way, she pressed her finger to Tony's lips, sending a wave of shock and heat through his body. He felt the world disappear around him, his body going weightless, his eyes going sightless, his hearing nothing but a strange buzzing, and the next thing he knew, he was flat on his back on the floor, and Steve was screaming, "
Because to believe it would never happen was one thing. He could manage that. He could deal with that. But to know that in another time and place — in another world — it
Pepper just put her hand on his arm, gently, like she was trying to break bad news to him. "We may just have to."
"Yeah, yeah," Steve muttered and pulled the door open. He stood there expectantly as he waited for Tony to climb in, and knowing he wasn't getting around the determined six-foot super soldier crowding him in, he sighed and sat down in the passenger seat.
Tony waited a moment — until Wilson had felt it safe to drop his hands and open his eyes — then added, "He's a bit of a biter, too. In fact, he's really into nipple—"
Now, strangely — or maybe not so strangely — Barnes wasn't as excited about this turn of events as Steve was, but he just shrugged and said sure, he'd go back with them, and climbed into the back seat as Steve took the wheel and Tony got into the passenger. Steve completely ignored this blasé attitude and instead rambled on about all the amenities the Tower had and how much he'd like the other Avengers and how helpful JARVIS was — neglecting to inform him that JARVIS was a computer AI. Tony figured Steve was saving that for a surprise.
"But it's true. I never really thought I would find someone like you — I never thought I could have someone like you — and I just couldn't ever imagine having to…"
that he wanted to keep this quiet, and what had he gone and done? Made a snap decision and told a reporter —
The worry and concern still hadn't left Steve's face. "Yeah, I know," he said and reached a tentative hand out toward Tony's abdomen but stopped short of actually touching him. "But I'm not the one that ended up…"
, if she can do this to me, she can do that, too. But actually, yeah, no, I wondered the same thing, but Thor says this is her MO and this is par for the course and that she does it to
," they both said in unison again, and Barton looked at the others and said, "I know Stark pisses and moans that we're not on a sitcom, but doesn't it sometimes feel like we are?"
"Hey, that's what they do in the movies," Tony replied, and Steve watched as he moved presents from one place to another.
Tony swallowed and nodded, and he stared down at the baby a moment before he said, "Evidently, there is a way to control the Winter Soldier."
," JARVIS replied, and the music started up again, soft and quiet, almost more white noise than anything that could be completely discernible. Tony knew it was something old, which wasn't offensive in and of itself — Steve was old, and he loved him — but it was at least postwar. Steve had very gladly taken everyone's suggestions into consideration when trying to catch up on the popular culture of the last seventy years, and Steve was a music fan, but there were some things — OK, a
"You will always have your bonded. Perhaps not in physical form, but you will always have your bonded. You are forever entwined with one another."
Steve turned on him, fury in his eyes. "Did I ask you to follow me?" he asked, seething, and even Barton seemed surprised by his tone of voice.
No, of course you were—" He grimaced and groaned and dropped his hand back down to his side. "Look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything, and let's just let bygones be—"
"Yeah, well," Tony said with a blasé shrug, but didn't qualify the words after that, and so Steve steered the conversation in another direction.
He shut the fridge and checked his watch. His shift didn't technically start for another ten minutes, and he thought about bringing up that video on his phone — the one where Tony had looked dead into the camera and said Steve owed him a ring. It didn't mean anything; he knew it didn't mean anything.
So, the gown had shown up after Natasha had informed Bruce of this newest development, and Tony had slipped into it, Natasha helping to tie it in the back for him while Bruce and Barnes averted their gazes and DUM-E quietly mopped up the small puddle Tony had left on the floor.
him on the team. Tony Stark was the very definition of a liability in the field. He wasn't sure anything would ever convince him otherwise.
The birthday boy himself wandered in at one point after his run, sweaty, his shirt clinging to him in all the right places, and he eyed up the horror show, a grimace on his face as he said, "Tony, you really didn't have to go to all this."
Steve pulled away from him, still holding him by the shoulders, and he shook him a little to get him to look up at him. Tony did and saw anger and hurt and confusion staring back at him, Steve's gaze raking over his face like he was trying to find evidence that Tony was joking or wasn't fully serious about what he'd just said.
no words for this. There were no emotions. He was a man — and very happily so — that had been turned into a woman that had been impregnated, and now was forced to endure this impossible pregnancy to its end unless he wanted to die. Esmeralda the Insane had sold it as some kind of fail-safe to protect the clump of cells growing within him, which would be all fine and dandy if he actually
"Uh, so…you like 'em? They're OK?" Tony asked as he slid his arms around Steve's waist. Not as easy to do as it had once been — stupid , gigantic stomach was in the way — but he was still able to get a good hold on Steve, and Steve was still able to hold him in his arms and brush his lips over the top of his head and murmur a soft and sincere, "
"It's… I don't know, it's hard to explain. Wait, no, it's not. Cap's perfect and Steve isn't. Captain America is this righteous, virtuous Sentinel of Liberty that you kind of try to force yourself to be as good as. Steve Rogers is a horny-but-lazy old man."
"I just know," she said, running the brush over the nail on his pinky toe. "You'll curse out Esmeralda before you curse out Steve."
Tony glanced up to the half-hard voyeur that was doing nothing to hide his obvious attraction and said, "You heard what the lady said."
Tony reached over to set his hand on Steve's thigh. He gave it a gentle squeeze and said, "Steven, you are
His hold tight on Stark’s wrists, he forced him forward, Stark bending at the waist as Steve pressed him down onto the table. Stark hit with a grunt, turning his face so his cheek rested against the tabletop, and Steve, leaning over Stark and using his weight to pin him down, grabbed a towel hanging on the other edge of the table and twisted it a few times to use as a binding agent and then stood back up, holding Stark’s wrists together and tying them with the towel.
"There's a built-in voice modulator. I haven't really used it since the beginning. All I have to do is keep the faceplate down and turn the modulator on and no one will know."
Tony was right. It didn't take two-and-a-half hours. Between getting him back into the bedroom to put some underwear on, drying his hair, styling his hair, doing his makeup, and getting him into the dress and situated so that the tie sat just under his left breast like so (because of course that's the way all of these dresses worked — evidently it looked 'cute' or something) and the rest of the material draped over his belly the way it should have, it took exactly two hours and seventeen minutes.
Tony scoffed and said, "Throw it over the couch for all I care. You do have a couch underneath that pile of crap, don't you?"
Not that Tony hadn't tried to seduce Steve the best ways he knew how, and not that Steve didn't desperately want to give into his libido. But through a combination of common decency and Clint's oft-repeated reminder of 'jail-bait,' he was able to keep his cock tucked into his pants—
"Of course," he replied, a little more heat in his words this time, and Thor smiled a little and seemed to understand the feeling that was driving Steve's lack of enthusiasm.
"Yeah, it figures," he said and grimaced just a little as he got down on the floor with her. Again, just shy of forty-two. Not an old man. He set the books and the pencil case on the table, and Olivia gasped at it.
Really, it was just an excuse to suck on each other's fingers in a somewhat sultry manner. It was actually a pretty damned good cake, but yeah, the entire thing — at least on Tony's end of it — was to provocatively suck Steve's fingers in front of their friends.
"You are stardust. You are energy. You are a being of life and creation. Your physical form matters little in the entire scheme of things."
He stripped off his shorts and his underwear and placed them aside in a neatly folded pile, and wrapping the sheet around him, he
The man stared at him a moment, and Tony tried to play it off like it was nothing, but there was something a little odd about the way he looked at him. Like he was trying to figure something out. Like he was trying to figure where he'd seen Tony before.
"Well, I wasn't boyfriend-of-the-year material, either. But I know that was one of her problems. She was afraid I was going to die, and she couldn't handle that." He shrugged. "Whatever, it happens."
Steve took a quick, nervous look around the establishment, and Tony frowned at him, almost in sympathy.
An odd chill overcame the room at that, but there was no breeze to produce it, the flickers of candlelight dancing as they had been in the moments before the chill, and the man or creature known as 'Viz' continuing to sit in his chair and whittle his piece of wood.
"The turning me in to a woman thing? Yeah. All her. The getting me pregnant thing? All Steve." He cringed. "Sorry, I know it's not exactly cool to talk about your new flame with your ex—"
calls him that," Tracy reminded him. She let out a disgusted groan and added, "Every time I see him on TV, I want to punch him, and I've only met him twice. Such a scuzzball."
Steve nodded yet again but said, "Well, it doesn't matter. She might not be that Olivia, but she's still our Olivia."
But Tony shook his head to wave off his concern and said, "No, no, it's— It doesn't matter." He got hold of himself and looked at Steve. "OK, yeah, so, next time you want to surprise me, try not to give me a heart attack, huh?"
"I have projects to finish, and I want to make sure they're all taken care of. Pepper, Rhodey, the Avengers…Steve. I need to make sure they're all taken care of. I don't need the board swooping in and taking control over everything. They'll cut the team right off, and now that SHIELD-slash-Hydra is at the bottom of the Potomac, I'm the only one funding them. There's still a lot of rats out there, and we know Loki's scepter got lost in the shuffle along with a lot of other things that should have been under better lock and key. Steve won't rest until all that stuff's back in the right hands."
But Bruce just said, "Tastes really good," again as he cut into his syrup-slathered waffle and shoved another bite in his mouth.
Sad-eyed, Steve just leaned in and pressed a kiss to his temple as he put a hand to his back and gave a few soothing rubs.
Bruce just shrugged and went back into the bathroom to clean up his small mess, and Barnes, with Hill's aid in steering, wheeled the bed back over to the bassinette.
Rhodey jerked a thumb at him and said, "Is this guy for real?" while Barton rolled his eyes and said, "You say that shit on purpose because you think it's funny, don't you?"
"I assure you, my friend, it is quite possible," Thor replied, no trace of anger or malice in his voice, only amusement.
Tony shrugged and picked up his mug. "Santa's the one that spent a year in art school but didn't even think about trying to disguise his handwriting." And then, he changed his voice a bit, almost like he was mocking someone. "
Steve, caught out, didn't even try to hide it. He just smiled a little, his cheeks flushing just the slightest as he said, "I always wanted to do that. Ask the bandleader to play a song for me and my date to dance to."
"I mean, I'm still sore as fuck, but — according to Brucie — sutures held up. Didn't…re-tear anything…down there. I mean, truth be told, it
He chanced a glance upward and sat Tony was still sitting at his worktable, but he was slouched back in his chair and giving Steve a cautious and questioning look-over, those sharp, dark eyes raking over his body, his mouth contorted into a flat line. He reached out and grabbed his grass- and-dirt smoothie (or whatever it was actually called) off the table and took a gulp, never once taking his eyes off Steve. Steve felt the heat spread from his cheeks to his ears, and he knew then he must have been burning bright red.
It was the door slamming that did it. He didn't know why, but it was the door slamming shut and the reporter outside begging for more dirt that made Tony realize—
Knowing the only way to fight fire was with more fire, Steve got into the digital age, attempting to combat #JabbatheSlut with the more regal-sounding #LadyLiberty. Which was…sweet, but kind of lame-sounding, no matter how proud of it Steve was or even if some people had actually taken the bait — and not just the other Avengers under assumed handles and avatars reblogging and retweeting positive things about Captain America's very pregnant paramour. Though they did. A lot. Maybe they had more fun with it than they should have?
He stayed quiet a moment, and he set his fork down and sat back into his chair again. He turned his attention to the skyline beside them — the lights and the dark outlines and the sky hazy with cloud-cover — and he seemingly contemplated something a moment before he said, "I don't know what it is, to be honest. I mean, there's so many great things about the future — the vaccines and the food and the attitudes are a little more…open. You can get free transfers on the subway! All the lines are operated by the city now. Jesus, back then, you wanted to change lines, you had to pay because there were three different companies operating the lines. All the Els in Manhattan are gone — or most of them are. Trolleys don't exist. The little corner stores are pretty much wiped out. Costs an arm and a leg to live almost
Iron Man?" She nodded at Tony's abdomen. "There's a part of me that thinks that kid's going to take over the world."
Tony rolled his eyes and sat back against the couch. God, fuck, he could use an icepack right about now. And a change of underwear, probably. And he was pretty sure he did indeed tear whatever it was Bruce had stitched back up.
Bruce stared at him a moment then heaved out a sigh and said, "You're not going to listen to a word I say about this, are you?"
"Yeah, well, tea also sucks," he said and dumped a heaping portion of sugar into his coffee. Thor nodded his approval while Bruce made a face.
Barton whistled low, and Tony winced and said, "Uh, yeah, that's the sort of talk I really want to hear coming from my fiancé—"
He rolled his eyes. "Yeah, he got that from Barton, and Barton is full of shit. Don't listen to him. Don't ever listen to him. We treat each other with dignity and respect, and you think I'm a goddamned genius, which is why you go along with what I say. Because I am a goddamned genius, and I'm right, and that's all there is to it, and you recognize that."
"Think you don't like him?" he finished for him. "Kinda, seeing as those are the words that he used."
Steve laughed and reached out to take hold of Tony's hand, and Tony let him, watching as Steve played with his fingers.
the time. 'n' sometimes Unca Rhodey joins 'em, too. 'n' Unca Bucky's there a lot. He didn't go this time 'cuz he's gone somewhere else with Unca Hawky 'n' Mr. Ant-Man 'n' Mrs. Wasp."
So, he worked in silence, running wires between terminals and reading whatever popped up on his computer screen and making adjustments as he saw fit, and after several long, quiet minutes that felt more like an hour but was maybe only around a quarter of that, Barnes swallowed rather audibly and said, "I saw that... I read about Steve and you. A lot. Thought you were a fella?"
"OK," he said as Steve sat away from him and went back to poking at his dinner, "those are the two unsexiest words you have ever spoken. Barton is never right about anything."
of these knuckle-draggers to go through actually giving birth to a child and not come out of it a changed person. Like I just…I know how they're going to frame the whole 'mom' thing if it ever came out, and I don't want to put any of us through that — not you, not Olivia, not the other Avengers—"
"Said we're heading back out," he said and tried to call the suit to him. When it didn't respond, he frowned and looked down at his forearm. He felt for the sensors he'd embedded under his skin and found to his surprise that there were none.
He shook his head. "Honestly? No. I think he was happy to get rid of them. I think he thought it was weird that his grandfather even had them in the first place."
" Rhodey murmured, but Tony just shrugged and didn't have a chance to explain as the tot in question came running in from the living room, clothes askew and hair all but fallen out of the ponytail holder that was hanging on for dear life. She climbed up onto the chair and began to dig in to her dinner, and Rhodey shot a pointed look between Tony and her and said, "Tones, look, if you're serious about this, maybe you might want to read a few articles about how to properly
He could only figure it was hours later before Bruce determined he was ready, and with no other choice in the matter, he climbed up onto the lab table that
"You know, Stark," Barton said and stabbed at some of the scrambled eggs on his plate, "if you're not careful, one of these days we're going to stop coming here."
"—some screwball cosmonaut shows up in the middle of a battle already in progress down in the Financial District. You remember that, don't you?"
while the clerk just smacked her chewing gum, and wasn't that completely unprofessional? Chewing gum and working the city marriage license bureau?
Steve's face went a little hard at that, a little firm, like he had slipped into overprotective mode again. "I'll have a talk with the others—" he started to say, but Tony shook his head.
"I didn't think so," Steve said with a sigh. "Look, I'm sure the formula's fine. Are you almost done?"
Steve was down to his boxer briefs, his want painfully apparent, and he sat at the edge of the bed and swallowed as he raked his gaze over Tony's body. He opened and closed his mouth a few times, blinking as he went to say something then thought better of it, and Tony tilted his head to the side, hands still at his lace-covered hips and said, "Cat got your tongue, or did you blow a fuse?"
Thor frowned as he chewed, and he swallowed and said, "As I understand, 'tis quite natural for those in your condition, and I did not hold it against you for a moment."
He pulled open a cabinet door and groaned at what he found there, but he didn't feel like cooking, there were no bagels or pastries to be had, and toast would take too fucking long to make. Yes, toast. Shut up.
more to it, I'm sure, than just masturbating," sounding like she couldn't believe she actually had to say those words.
"Hmm… Well, then I think what you need is to take a nice, mid-week vacation out to New York where you get to watch me marry the world's youngest WWII vet."
"That…sounds horrible," the same woman said, visibly shivering as she seemingly pondered the mere thought of it.
He handed the fork to Steve, and Steve took it and examined it a moment before he went back to eating.
Tony just looked back down at the little girl sleeping in his arms, and he rocked in the chair a couple times and watched as she opened her mouth in a gummy yawn but kept her eyes closed, and she gurgled a bit as she settled more securely into his arms. Olivia. His little Olivia.
He motioned between them, as though Tony didn't understand he meant the two of them, and Tony nodded and said, "Yeah, we're good. I'm not really in the mood to go over that shit now, anyway. But I might run it past Nat and Hill if I were you."
"Oh, well, it's — it's kind of hard to explain. The way he was with that agent, it was… It was cute, you know? He was like a puppy with her — soft smiles and bashful looks and that kind of shit. She was the first woman that he liked that ever liked him back, which says more about those other jerks than it does him. And not that I don't think Steve had it in him to know how to, you know, figure out how to
"Look," Tony said and she turned her attention to him, "I'm not saying you didn't have our best interests at heart, but maybe, next time, you might want to, I don't know,
"I am not the only person under eighty with a landline," he told Sam then directed to Bucky, "Sign me in, would you?"
Tony felt Steve's hands slide beneath his arms, and he gently tugged him to his feet. Steve pressed his body up against his, and with Steve's hard cock pressing into his belly, he felt Steve reach behind and undo the bindings that held his wrists. He then pulled Tony's arms so they were in front of him again, and he put his wrists together once more and bound them yet again.
"Oh, my god, if you give me the it's-not-you-it's-me, I'm going to repulsor your ass into the next zip code."
from the forties," Bruce said and rolled his eyes. "Are we going to talk science, or are we going to talk Steve?"
Steve glanced at Bruce in the rearview mirror and said, "I've been trying to get him to read stuff for months now. He won't."
The deputy clerk just raised an eyebrow as she glanced between Steve and Tony later the next afternoon.
"Hmm…well," Tony decided, "things are a little different this time. For one, you're mine, and I don't like people taking or touching my stuff, so someone did something like that to you? Yeah, a world of pain coming for them and also me coming to rescue your ass from wherever you are.
Rhodey rolled his eyes yet again, but it was a fond roll of the eyes. "Bye, Tones," he said and squeezed his shoulder before he headed out of the kitchen and over to the elevator.
But Steve was not deterred, and trapped between a giant super soldier and that super soldier's loyal jogging buddy, Tony squawked out a few more times before Steve's mouth was on his, and Tony made sure to keep his mouth shut tight in case Steve tried that same bullshit he'd pulled on him at the cabin. But Steve just kissed him chastely and pulled back, the picture of innocence.
Rhodey's eyebrows almost hit his hairline at Olivia's familial name for him. "Not now. He's charging."
— but it's been seventy fucking years for him, Steve. He's spent more of his life as the Winter Soldier than I've fucking been alive!"
, like it pained him to even have to consider the possibility, and Barnes said, "You know, that would be kind of fun to have our own."
"I know, Steve. But we're running out of options here. The longer the fetus gestates, the harder it'll be to…fix…things."
Barnes nodded his understanding. "You got it, Chief," he said, the words sounding like gravel in his throat. "And before you ask, no."
"How, uh, how long do you think it'll take Pepper to finish packing up? And do you have any suggestions for how to keep Tony Stark's four-year-old from getting too bored?"
Tony just clamped his mouth shut and nodded, shuffling his way out of Bruce's lab with his tail between his legs.
"OK, I only brought the coffee in. I have to go back for the bagels. I mean, I guess I could have brought everything in on a nice serving tray, but since when the fuck am I Rosie the maid?"
"Dance," Steve replied like it was obvious. Then he nudged his arm and said, "Come on," again. "Just like we're back home."
"Look," he said and swung Steve's arm a little bit to pull him out of his head, "when we get back to the cabin, I'll spread my legs and finger myself and let you watch—"
"Wait! Hold on!" he said then unfastened some trinket-y bracelet from his wrist — the typical sort of tacky souvenir thing sold at a tourist mecca.
That they'd never liked Tony Stark to begin with, so what did it matter that this bitch was clearly dancing on the grave of his relationship with Captain America?
"For the exercise," Steve said, slipping into his 'Captain America' voice. "You both clearly have enough energy stored up." He nodded toward the door. "Let's go."
, it read with two bold lines drawn underneath it and a disapproving-looking little frowny-face next to it. He scowled and read what else Steve had scrawled on it.
"For all I know, nothing would happen! For all I know, the worst that could happen is the serum ups your tolerance and you need more drugs than you normally would. But I don't know that that
"You know," Rhodey cut in, and Tony glanced over and saw he was talking to Pepper, "I'm starting to get what the others were whining about."
Thor took a breath. "Because, to the Goddess, there is no greater manifestation of the union between two bondeds than to conceive a child together. It was actually considered the utmost honor to be blessed in such a way by the Goddess. There are many across the galaxy that could only wish to have the Goddess Esmeralda bless them so and would envy you greatly for that which she has bestowed upon you."
Bruce grabbed a tube of silicone gel and turned to Tony. "Uh, Tony, you're going to have to pull your pants down a little bit."
Tony glanced up at Steve to see if he believed that to be the case, and when Steve nodded his approval at him, Tony sighed and did what was instructed of him, closing his eyes and telling himself it would all be over soon.
The table went deathly quiet at that, and after a few moments of silence, Tony tweaked a smile and said, "Awkward conversation and painful silences? Yep. Feels like Christmas."
Though, to be honest, the worst he'd dealt with on the street since the press conference was some middle-aged asshole asking, "Your tits real?" with his hands close enough that it was like he wanted to get a feel of them just to confirm. He'd wanted to snap back some pithy, condescending comment, but he couldn't think of one fast enough, and besides, Steve-the-Killjoy had been there to pull him away before he could get himself into any trouble.
Natasha ducked her head and began to make like she was sucking at the side of Tony's neck, and Tony… Tony…
," he said as it hit him — the strange and almost caught-out look Steve was giving him. "Oh, you crafty son-of-a-bitch, you already asked JARVIS to show it to you, didn't you?"
After they'd finished showering, Steve asked if he was hungry, and when Tony said he could go for something to eat, Steve just smiled and nodded and said he'd be back.
"Goddamn it, Steve!" he said, turning back to face his pale and half-conscious lover. "What the hell were you thinking? You can't
No. Just— Dear god, he couldn't do it. He couldn't fucking do it. This wasn't— He wasn't— This had only been manageable or tolerable because he'd known it wouldn't last forever. He'd have this baby that Esmeralda claimed would 'complete' his relationship with Steve (which was already complete enough, thank you very much), and he'd go back to being the man he was, and that would be that — no 'ifs,' 'ands,' or 'buts' about it. No, it hadn't been the worst experience in the world, and there were a great many things he'd found he enjoyed about being in a female body — indulgences and desires society would look askance at when he was a man — but it wasn't permanent. It wasn't supposed to be permanent. It was supposed to be a temporary thing that would end when he'd finished the task Esmeralda had set forth for him, and that had made it tolerable or bearable or something that didn't make him want to jump off a bridge.
"Wasn't it a severed head?" Barton asked and looked to the rest of the group for confirmation. Thor just looked puzzled, and Natasha shrugged, but Bruce said, "I don't think they actually
Steve just continued to hold his hand out, hovering over Tony's abdomen like he was trying to work up the courage to actually make the contact or shame himself over what he'd done. "Bruce said it isn't safe," he murmured.
Tony frowned at what he saw on the plate and said, "Hey! I got ice cream to go with this! Where the hell is the ice cream?"
"Because that's the 'in' thing now," Barton said as he met up with them, Thor dragging the Iron Man armor right behind him. "It's a way of involving the father in the pregnancy, too, I guess. Think it's kind of stupid myself, but some people think it's some sort of—"
"Alone," he said and pushed himself to his feet, wincing at the ache between his legs that wasn't entirely numbed by the ice pack he'd been sitting on. "Go ahead and say it. I'm all alone in this now."
Steve turned to see Olivia sitting beneath the tree again, a small half-wrapped package in her hand, the corner of which was stuck in her mouth as she chewed on it. Steve sighed and set his mug on the coffee table then stuck the remains of his bagel in his mouth and reached out to pull the small box away from her.
He finished up in the bathroom, and he switched the light off and made his way back into the bedroom where Steve sat up on the bed, back against the headboard, tablet in hand, fresh sheets that didn't bear the hallmarks of the thoroughly licentious things they'd done to each other an hour before. There was a tray of food sitting on Tony's side of the bed, and he went over and sat down, tucking one leg underneath him as he picked at the grapes and the cheese and the pretzels.
about it. It looked like an average, normal living room — he supposed from 2015, anyway. He didn't have a good frame of reference. Most of what he'd seen had been 1939's impression of what the future would look like, and truth be told, it hadn't looked anything like this.
Tony struggled to sit back up some and finally deigned to let Steve help him up, his big-ass belly weighing him down. "Look, this is so sweet and wonderful and thank you so much for it, but at the same time, twelve hours does not a honeymoon make. Think of this as a trial-run — you know, to see if we like it."
But instead of getting up like Steve was doing, Tony just sat there and gave him his saddest and most pathetic look imaginable. Steve stopped for a moment and stared at him, but he just pointed to the door and said, "March."
. Saying 'I'd let Captain America knock me up in a heartbeat' is evidently not something to be ashamed of and is clearly something to shout proudly out of a bathroom stall."
He stepped away from the computer and paraded over to Steve, and Steve swallowed as he let his gaze rake over every single inch of Tony's supple and shapely body. "God, you're beautiful," he heard himself saying, and Tony tweaked a lopsided smile at him and tilted his head somewhat, standing what Steve was pretty sure his exact same height as when he...well, was a man.
"Being your daughter must count for something," Rhodey said, and Tony shot him a sour look before he turned back to the brat and said, "Fine. Whatever. If it'll make you happy."
Tony blinked out of his reverie and looked beside him to where Steve was looking in the little girl's direction and shaking his head.
Steve smiled and nodded, and he kissed Tony's cheek again and got to his feet. "I'll stop on my way back from my run."
"Yeah," he said with a nod. "I did— I do. Besides, if the bastard tries anything, I've got his information. I can easily make his life a living hell."
But Thor just shook his head. "You fail to understand. You are not 'stuck' with one another. You are bonded with one another. You are the perfect balance to one another. In theory, bond mates do not actually need camaraderie or companionship from any other being, and they are often most happy when they are left to themselves without interference from others."
Steve shook his head and grunted out a negative response as he stuck the orange juice back into the fridge.
Rhodey turned to look over where DUM-E was rolling around chasing after a squealing Olivia, and Bruce was staring at them nervously, biting his lip and telling them to be careful. He shook his head a little and turned back to Tony, but before he could say anything, Tony beat him to the punch.
"Esmeralda, enough!" Thor yelled, more annoyed than angry, and Steve just stood beside Tony, arms folded and jaw set.
Maybe, if he really thought about it — really looked — he could see where and how Tony had aged in the past two-almost-three years that he'd known him. He could delineate which hairs were silver where they had once been nearly black and which wrinkles had formed where the skin had once been soft and smooth. Maybe he could do that, but he didn't want to do that — look for imperfections. Tony was not a perfect man (and he himself was far from one as well), but those imperfections were not of a physical nature. Steve was the last person that could ever judge someone for what they looked like. And he would never judge Tony for that because Tony was gorgeous, and he knew that thirty years from now (forty, if what Esmeralda was saying was true), he would still feel the same way. Aging was a part of life — a natural process and something that had been robbed of him for too long. He would always look a good deal younger than Tony, and if Tony was OK with that, then so was he.
Tony and Rhodey glanced back to see Happy looking at them expectantly, like he was awaiting information for their most-pressing issue, and Tony and Rhodey exchanged glances before Rhodey said, "Nothing, man. Sorry. I was just asking Tony if he was happy because I switched out his shitty coffee for my better one."
"I still don't understand what your problem with it is," he said as he poured himself a hefty serving of the black liquid god that did not have the power to do
to throw him off, Nat leans over and grabs me and kisses me. And she may have felt me up a little bit, too. But does it work? No, guy just says it's a sandwich he'd like to get in the middle of. I mean, did he
"No, no, that's fine. I'm hideous. I get it. You'd rather get some from that resting murder face of Barton's—"
— strode into the workshop looking every bit the beautiful and powerful and wonderful woman that she was. She smiled when she saw Tony and made headway to kiss him, but the little demon spawn instead ran at her, screeching out, "An' Pepper!" as she threw her little arms around Pepper's legs and latched on tight.
Tony stared at him, that odd sort of look on his face that he got when he was stuck for something to say but still didn't agree with what he was hearing. He cocked his head to the side a little bit, lips pulled into a slight smile, and finally said, "What, have you been having secret chats with the space case?"
Steve's stomach made a wretched sound as soon as Tony said this, and he cringed and hoped Tony hadn't heard it, but Tony just glanced at his abdomen and said, "Guess that half-a-hot-chocolate wasn't enough to hold you over, was it?"
"Yeah, no, that's how your pal describes you," Tony said as Steve pressed a kiss to his temple. "You can't steal that from him. That's completely unoriginal. It's like plagiarism. Don't plagiarize, Steve. It's tacky."
like he was having a hard time of it. Granted, he couldn't blame the guy if he were. That would be a hell of a thing to wake up to for anyone. But it didn't
He pulled away from Steve slightly, making Steve frown at him and open his mouth to ask what was wrong, but before Steve could formulate his thought, Tony said, "You goddamned sap."
Steve offered nothing but an unimpressed glare as he looked up from his tablet while they sat around the penthouse living room about a week after the gallery event, but it was Barton that said, "Anyone have a bottle of brain bleach?"
"Nope," Steve said and took a sip of his large. Tony reached out to take it off him, but Steve just produced…a fucking
He sighed and popped the cap on it, and she looked at her plate expectantly like she expected him to squirt the offending substance onto the eggs he'd just slaved to cook so…
"If it's a fake, it's a good one," Bruce said. "The card stock on the picture, the way the edges are worn on the folder, even the way it's yellowed — if someone took you for a ride, they definitely put a lot of time and effort into it."
Steve turned to him, and Tony turned to glare at Rhodey and said, "Thanks, man. Way to have my back."
"I'm sure they would have liked to," he said and stuffed some more paper into the bag. "But the city's not going to clean itself up."
"Nah," he said and followed Tony over to the door. "This place might get Steve all hot and bothered, but it doesn't do a thing for me."
He looked down at himself, at the breasts and the swell of his belly and the long, dark hair falling in his face.
He just twitched his mouth from side-to-side and reached up to scratch the side of his neck. "I think you're both full of shit and you're trying to make me feel better. Look, can we start by not focusing so much on what I look like? How 'bout we concentrate more on my abilities and talents and what's on the inside?"
Bruce just looked him over then said, "Yeah, thanks, Tony, but I'm not sure I could pull off a black evening gown as well as you."
Tony just eyed him a moment and nodded, and he made to walk into the living room, but Steve caught him by the waist, and they stood together in the doorway a moment, their eyes dancing together, and Tony seemed to understand what Steve wanted — what he'd wanted from the moment he'd set eyes on Tony this morning — as much as Steve understood what Tony was looking for.
"What do you mean bank card?" he asked as they strolled down the street, Tony on his arm like, well, like the way he'd always imagined having his best dame— broad— girl—
"And there's not going to be any funny business when I turn back, right? I'm not going to find out in another two months that I'm pregnant again, right?"
It was just going for six when Steve strolled into the kitchen with a large bag full of Styrofoam containers, and he set the bag on the tabletop and stepped over to where Tony stood at the counter and read over the directions for how to properly prepare the infant formula.
"Hmm...always did know how to woo a fellow, didn't you?" he teased then reached out andnplaced his hands on either side of Steve's waist. The lopsided smile morphed into a sultry leer, and Tony ran his hands up from Steve's waist to his chest where he flicked his thumbnails over either of Steve's nipples and gently kneaded his fingers into the firm flesh of Steve's pecs. Steve could only think for a fraction of a second of how different and yet similar it felt before Tony was all but purring at him, "Mmm...show me what you're made of, soldier."
"As soon as I saw you and your boy pop up on the monitor," Sam explained, "I bet Grumpy over there you'd do something stupid like make a date with him."
When Natasha and Pepper had finally finished, and Tony was able to join the other two back in the living room, Rhodey looked down at his watch and said, "You sure you're ready, Tones? You have, like, thirteen minutes left."
Tony grinned at him and nodded lasciviously while Steve said, "First name was easy. We both wanted to name him after our best pal."
"You're doing well, Tony," Natasha said and somehow reached her hand up from where her arm rested supportively against his back to pull damp hair back away from his face. "You're doing so well. Just a couple more pushes, OK?"
"Is that what the kids are calling it nowadays?" Sam mused. "Oh, hey! What about that German grad student? What was his name?"
Tony scoffed again. "What? That he 'flips houses' with? Please. He's probably doing some side- work for that patch-wearing superspy that claims to be 'dead.'"
"Still," Steve said, his tone of voice all business, "it's something to keep in mind. If you ever do think you're at a place to join us."
He jumped up from his chair and went over to the toaster, and he jiggered the handle to get it to pop up. The toast wasn't exactly burned, but it was getting there, and he grabbed a fork from the flatware drawer and used it to pull the pieces out without burning his fingers.
Pepper wasn't in the mood for his defenses, and the little monster went to say more, but Bruce thankfully ushered her out of the room, and the door locked shut behind them. Pepper just stood there, still pinching the bridge of her nose with one hand, the other planted on her hip, and Tony grimaced again and said, "I can explain—"
Steve nodded like that was what he'd figured. "Yeah, we've never made a big deal about it before, right?"
'Unca' Bruce. Jeez, this was not the sort of weirdness he'd thought he was getting himself into back in Calcutta.
Barnes's eyes shot up to the Hydra agent's at that, and Tony saw a little bit of cold hatred wash over his face but he didn't otherwise move a muscle.
"My favorite photo of Jimi Hendrix. You know, she was young, but she really was talented. She had this great perception of light and shadow. It's really neat the things she was able to do, especially with her city shots — New York and London and places like that…"
"Yeah?" Tony said, and there was a teasing smile on his lips and a glint in his eye, and Steve steeled himself for an insult. "They also used mercury to treat syphilis."
Barnes was the one to snort the laugh this time. "If you're waitin' for that to happen, you're gonna be waitin' a long time. Steve's never gonna change. Gotta take 'im as he is. I kept hoping he'd stop trying to pick fights with everyone — stop trying to prove his fucking usefulness. He hasn't stopped picking fights in seventy years, I don't think he's gonna develop any more tact, either."
He tried to catch a glimpse of the person in the reflection of the glass, but the lighting wasn't good
"Really?" Barton asked, almost like he was genuinely surprised by the promotion, and Bruce said a slightly hurt, "Hey," at the exact same time. Rhodey just rolled his eyes and sipped at the non- alcoholic punch, secure in the fact that Tony was full of shit and would never replace him.
—" he said above Tony's attempt to protest, "—I mean in your life period. How could you know Stane was going to try to have you killed in Afghanistan? How could you know someone you were too drunk to remember meeting at a conference years earlier was going to be the one to save your life? It would be one thing if this all happened to you and you didn't do anything to course-correct it. If you just kept living your life the way you had been. But you didn't. You stopped building weapons. You stopped drinking. You converted your company's mission to clean and renewable energies and technological advancements. You became the hero you were always meant to be — even without your suit. You gave a bunch of wayward souls a home. You're right. I don't know that Tony Stark, and I never will because he doesn't exist anymore. But I know this Tony Stark — this amazing, wonderful, brilliant man — and, god help me, I'm in love with this Tony Stark with all his neuroses and all his eccentricities, and nothing he says is ever going to get me to change my mind that he is
Steve had gotten up from the couch by this point, and he looked over Tony's shoulder and said, "Oh, yeah, you, uh...you had a hard time with it at first."
"Eh, you're a thousand. I'll let it slide— Oh, subway grate with these heels? I don't think so. We gotta go around that, Steve."
" he hissed as he looked down to see himself half-hard, even with a wet lap of liquid chocolate. He cringed and tried to sit so his arousal wasn't that obvious, but somehow, Tony happened to come back into the room just as Steve had positioned himself to make his arousal
She just looked at him like the sun rose and fell with him. "You did!" Then her brow furrowed, getting that strange but familiar crease to it as she added, "But Daddy said,
"Stark?" Steve asked, finding that to be the first familiar thing he'd come across all day. "Like Howard Stark?"
He flexed his fingers around the bag of coffee beans he held in his hand, and he sniffled and wiped at some tears that had collected at the corners of his eyes, and as he scanned the counter for
Pepper sighed, her shoulders slumping a little, and there was a little less fight in her voice as she said, "Tony, I don't think I can stave them off much longer. They're talking about filing an injunction—"
Steve poured out a glass of orange juice for Tony and then began to drink the rest straight from the carton. Tony watched him a moment then said, "Is this because I said you're a sucky cook?"
"Well, that's not very nice, is it?" Bucky mused, and Natasha shook her head and muttered something else that Steve didn't know the translation for. Thor smiled and said, "You are very lucky, my friend. Your little one is much-loved."
But he just continued to grind against him, and Tony realized he hadn't heard him, especially when the guy said, "What?"
"Right here good?" he asked and held his arms out as though to await the shot of whatever it was she did to change him from one body to the other.
It was a defensive measure. Steve had seen Tony through enough good times and bad to know a patented Tony Stark Defensive Maneuver when he saw one, and rather than rising to the bait, he just nodded and said, "I know. I'm sorry."
Ugh... He shivered. He could handle anyone's blood and tears except his daughter's. And pretty much Tony's, at this point, as well. In fact, there was a terrible and horribly selfish part of him that was tempted to pull rank on Tony and put him on 'permanent leave' from the team. Tony hadn't had any downright horrible mishaps in the field just yet, but that was the thing. He hadn't had any horrible mishaps just yet. Steve didn't know how much longer their luck could hold out, and now he had an entirely new reason to keep Tony safely away from anything that could harm him or, to be frank, kill him.
Tony sighed out a breath. "Not your fault, J," he said and sat down at his worktable. "Wish you could explain the situation to me."
But the doctor smiled and him and shook her head and said, "No, the baby doesn't feel it — not like that, if that's what you're worried about. The baby doesn't know what's going on. If you're worried about scarring you baby for life because of normal sexual relations, don't. I can assure you that baby is very happy and healthy."
She just hummed, her mouth thin and her eyes flat. "Hmm…I much prefer when the Captain is here. He, at least, hangs on my every word."
"Did something happen?" he asked, not liking the tone of Tony's reply. "Don't I speak to them? I mean, my kids would be older than you, wouldn't they? Did I have kids?"
Tony turned, sandwich halfway to his mouth, and saw a yawning Steve entering the kitchen, scratching his stomach as he shuffled into the room. He ignored the question and took the bite, savoring the taste, and Steve checked the wrapper on the counter and said, "Oh, good, you found it."
Steve whistled, marveling almost at what he'd just heard. "Jeez, back in my day, you just kinda had to wait 'til it was born to know if it was a boy or a girl. Sorta made it a little more fun — more like a present to open, I guess." He shrugged, a little embarrassed. "I don't know," he added and looked down to Tony. "It's up to you."
"No," Other Tony countered with a curt shake of his head. "It's 'Steve Edwards.' Or was. He's been dead almost thirty years."
Steve patted the hand that still rested against his chest. "Yeah, JARVIS told me about that. I'm sorry. I didn't want you to— I just wanted to surprise you. When you started dropping your hints about it the other day, I was afraid I was going to give the whole thing away—"
Barnes heaved out a breath. "Yeah," he croaked out after a moment. "I remember… Howard didn't give a shit about Steve. Thought he was a science project of his and nothing else. Not really."
"Mmm…he's such a good husband," he murmured and then grimaced and grunted as he got to his feet. He was feeling better, sure, but that didn't mean he still didn't feel fucking
"And it's in Steve's nature to make things 'right' — or what he thinks is 'right,'" Barnes added. "You hate this—" He made a slightly airy motion with his flesh hand. "Steve's gotta find a way to make it better for you."
But Tony wouldn't look at him and just said, "Nope! Don't even try that coy, bashful, golly-gee-willikers shit on me! Might work for some people—"
Tony nodded. "As much as they can be led, anyway. Barton, that asshole, likes to call us 'Mom and Dad.' No, I don't know who's supposed to be who, though I can guess, and the fact that
Steve sighed and held the clipboard out to him as though he expected Tony to take it right back. Tony just looked at it then looked at Steve and said, "Yeah, I don't like to be handed things."
Tony, how I knew you were still in there, were your eyes. They were the only thing about you that remained the same."
Barton just smiled like he knew something Tony didn't and took a sip of his drink. Whatever. Barton was just a fucking idiot.
"I can't lose you," Steve said suddenly, and Tony glanced up and met his gaze, seeing determination staring right back at him. "I know you can be Iron Man, but I just…" He shook his head some. "I can't lose you, and if grounding you is what it takes to make sure it doesn't happen, then that's what I'm going to do. I'm sorry, Tony, but that's just the way I feel."
shabby — well, when he was younger and before he'd damaged it with booze and arc reactors — but this body was actually kind of gorgeous. In fact, one of JARVIS's scans had even shown an almost perfect symmetry, with his bust-to-waist-to-hips ratio the culturally agreed upon ideal. His dark hair was thick and glossy with only the slightest of natural waves, and his facial features had been softened and brightened, his brows thinned, his lips slightly plumper, but his eyes were the same brown that caught different shades depending upon the light and his eyelashes still thick and black and curly.
"What?" Steve murmured, but Tony leaned forward like he was trying to get a better view of what the doctor was seeing on her tablet and said, "Wait, I didn't actually mean to write that."
He took Steve's hand and made to lead him back to the stairs, and Steve started to follow until the slightly ajar door across the hall caught his eye. He stopped, forcing Tony to stop as well, and somehow, Tony seemed to know exactly what he was thinking.
While he had enjoyed looking at them in general in the past, he did not enjoy having breasts of his own, which always seemed to get in the way whenever he was trying to fold his arms or make a point of some kind, and while bras were, again, annoying as fuck, it was even more annoying to not wear one. And he had remember to sit down to pee, which, for whatever reason, he had to do a
Steve shrugged again but said, "A couple of times. Wrecked hell with my asthma. I used to have to smoke those asthma cigarettes from time to time—"
Bruce just looked at him, sighing, like he'd already resigned himself to his fate. "Let me go make a call," he said, and Tony grinned and said, "Yay!" like he was an over-excited child.
"Right." He sat up. "Look, it's like I was saying. There was that incident in the Financial District that the Avengers were tied up with several months ago."
"Oh," he said but wasn't sure how to feel about JARVIS's explanation. It would almost seem like they were trying to hide something from him — or at least from JARVIS — but Tony had seen no reason for them to do so. After all, it's not like they'd pulled anything like this in the past. Maybe they were just stepping out for a drink or something?
He ended up scrambling himself some eggs with a couple slices of toast on the side, and he pulled open the fridge and looked for anything to wash it down with. He saw the nearly-empty carton of orange juice from this morning, and he thought long and hard about just pouring the damned thing down the drain, but he left it to fester and instead pulled out what looked like a small bottle of apple juice. Not the tiny bottles that had sat in his fridge for the longest time because there was a small part of him that was convinced that someone would be back to drink them, and she would be
"I'm kind of partial to the cow catapult, myself," Bruce said, and Tony stole a glance at Steve to see him making a rather amusing 'what the fuck?' face.
He tilted his head back and forth like he was weighing his options before he said, the words feeling false on his tongue, "Kinda, yeah. Been looking forward to it since January. I mean, don't get me wrong. It's been… Well, it's been interesting. Wouldn't really say it's been a
Barton shrugged. "Hey, she may be, what, a week old? But she still looks at all of us like she's disappointed in us."
"I can't believe Clint caught the bouquet," Steve muttered but didn't look up from the tablet, and Tony snorted a laugh.
"It's OK. It's OK. You've done this before," he said, evidently using the tip of his dick to determine whether or not his hole was loose and pliable enough, and before Tony could say or do anything more, he pushed himself in. Tony groaned out but pushed himself further down onto Steve's cock until he was fully seated on it. It was a familiar feeling, a welcome one, and he didn't even falter as Steve put gentle hands at his sides and pulled him away from the headboard some so he was resting against Steve, kneeling, legs spread, impaled on his cock, and blind to the world.
She turned on him accusingly. "You said I'm not s'pposed t' touch that stuff! You said, 'Those aren't toys for you t' play with, Olivia.'"
Tony watched as Bruce sighed a little, pushed up his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose, and said, "Yeah, Tony, for
Steve just shrugged. "Don't know. Don't remember. My ma would have been the only one that could've told you that."
" he said before Barnes could counter him. "Look, I get how you see it, and you have every right to see it that way, but that's not the way I see it. You didn't do it. James Barnes didn't kill my parents. The Winter Soldier did. And everything I know about James Barnes has led me to realize that he would never willingly do something like that. The Winter Soldier killed my parents, but James Barnes saved me and, by extension, my baby, and— Look, you saved my kid. You saved my baby. I'm…
"You don't get it, Steve, do you?" he said and began to crowd into Steve's space, forcing Steve to back away from him. "You really don't. You think all you have to do is not get yelled at by Natasha and then come back here and throw some flowers and candles and food at me, and everything'll be hunky dory. Well, guess what? That's not the way it works. I'm not even going to get into you almost breaking my wrist—"
Or Howard Stark, he supposed, now that he thought about it. Stark could run some improvements on him. It would give him something to do. Hey, if he was Stark's property (ho boy, he really should have read the fine print on those papers he'd signed!), he didn't have much of a choice, now did he? Dear God, tangled up with Howard Stark for the rest of his life. He wasn't sure he'd survive it.
He'd name Darcy as 'Exhibit A' for that latter one, but Jane was 'and Company,' and there was no question in his mind that if Jane showed up, so would Darcy. Hell, even if Jane
"Tony," Rhodey said, gentle, not without fondness, "if you actually wanted it…I think you might have a chance to get it."
He couldn't say that because it hadn't been an abomination or the worst thing imaginable or nothing but misery. It hadn't been a revelation, necessarily, but it hadn't been an abomination, either. It had actually been...kind of fun. The sex was definitely nothing to complain about, and dressing up and playing with makeup was kind of fun, and getting Steve to practically wait on him and-and-foot was pretty fun, and people not saying a goddamned word if he took a nap in the middle of the day was nice as fuck.
did I tell you about mentioning any of that in front of Steve?" Tony snapped, though Steve just set that sad-eyed look on him at the reminder of his less-than-stellar health.
Bruce ignored him and continued on with his point. "You've got to admit it's raising a lot of eyebrows, and with good reason. Tony disappears, and suddenly you're out with someone that was also spotted getting manicures with Nat yesterday."
"OK," Bruce said and stood up again. He reached out for her hand, and she took it, and just when Tony thought they would get her out of there without any other problems, she had to go and fucking ruin it on them.
"Fine by me," Tony said, grabbed Steve by the waist, and shot up through a hole in the ceiling and into the sky, Steve screaming at him to put him down the entire time. He flew them far enough away from the inferno before he settled them both down where Barton had left the jet, and Steve shoved away from him, looking sweaty and smoky and, he had to say, pretty damned pissed off.
Steve, still with his hands around his hot chocolate, said, "Well, I didn't want to be right on top of you."
seemed odd about it. It looked like any normal living room— Well, that wasn't exactly true. It didn't look like any living room Steve had ever been in but only because it looked so
Both men turned to glare at her like she'd just committed the most ultimate betrayal, and she just smiled a little and sat back, pleased with herself for what she'd said.
"Look, kiddo," he said and stretched his muscles some, "I don't think we have any Lucky Charms in the house. You might have to settle for some of Uncle Bruce's muesli."
"Whoa!" Barton said and came into sight, his tux a much better fit than Bruce's was on him and a glass of something in his hand. "Catty Stark is with us tonight, I see."
Because not only was that other body in much better shape than this one — more youthful, healthier — but when it came down to it, it was also much, much more attractive. His female form had practically been a work of art and beauty and symmetry and the perfect hourglass ratio of bust to waist to hips. He was younger in that body and pretty, and miraculously it didn't bear those ugly, ugly scars from reactor surgeries. This was the body he'd been born with, this was the body he'd thought he'd wanted to get back to for well over six months now, but ultimately it was nothing more than a step down, trading in a brand new car for a used model with too many miles and too many repairs under the hood.
Again, the room went silent at that, and Bruce leaned in close and murmured ever-so-softly to him, "
He scurried on down and yanked open one of his desk drawers, and he was just about to shove the box in and be done with it when a glint of gold caught his eye. He left the box on the tabletop ahead him then reached in and pulled out the bit of shining metal, holding the band in the palm of his hand as he weighed its significance. He frowned at it a moment then took it between his thumb and forefinger and slipped it onto his left ring finger. Even with the added weight and water retention, it still was too loose, and so he pulled it back off and went to put it back in the drawer for safe keeping, only holding back at the last second when he realized that the desk drawer in his lab probably wasn't the best place to keep sentimental bits of jewelry that he would never be able to wear again unless he got it resized so that it fit his smaller hand.
like the guy more than that, but you're convinced he doesn't see you as anything more than a vain, spoiled, entitled brat, so you keep telling yourself he's a jerk and he's not worth your time because admitting that other thing? Well, there's a chance you could get hurt that way."
Tony considered this a moment then shrugged a little, a small smile on his face as though to assure Rhodey he wasn't wrong about his assumptions, and Rhodey just sighed and shook his head and said, "I can't believe we're talking about this."
As Olivia gurgled and waved her tiny arms in the air, the pediatrician just smiled at Tony and said, "That's
"OK, what do we have here?" he mused and scrolled down the marriage bureau page of the city clerk's office before he sat down at the island again. "Uh…thirty-five bucks. I guess I can afford that. Oh! We can fill it out online!" He glanced up at Steve. "Well, that should get us around that whole, uh—"
As Natasha pressed the buttons to confirm the cost and add the tip, the driver stole a quick glance at Tony in the rear-view mirror. Tony, hiding behind a pair of sunglasses per usual, stared right back at eyes that he could tell were trying to figure him out, and he was just about to say something catty and snappy when Natasha popped her door open and grabbed his wrist.
But Rhodey just stood there, arms folded and murder splayed over his face as he glared at Steve, who stood beside him looking equal parts apprehensive and annoyed.
As Tony slipped the sunglasses back over his eyes, she pulled Tony over to the back door, and the reporter said, "But the public deserves to know what happened to Tony Stark—"
He didn't even notice he'd been crying until the roadway ahead of him went a little blurry, and he blinked and felt a flood of tears fall down his cheeks. He sniffled and lifted his non-aching hand from the steering wheel to wipe them away, resolute that he wasn't going to cry over this. Fuck him. Fuck Steve Rogers. He was not crying over that son-of-a-bitch.
Tony rolled his eyes and playfully slapped at Steve's face. "You're such a pain in the— Steve Rogers is
and Steve reached up and took the little article of clothing out of his hands and said, "Nat's right. She's our daughter. She could easily do both if she wanted. There's no question she'll be smart enough and talented enough to."
"Well, isn't that convenient?" she said, a bemused twist to her lips. Tony shrugged, bouncing just a little with each pushup Steve did.
"Evidently we're more of a 'hindrance' than a 'help,'" Sam replied, and Steve frowned again and went to ask him what he meant by that when the scent of baking cookies wafted through the air.
Tony stared at him as he crunched on the cookie, and Olivia reached out to grasp hold of it, but Steve pulled his hand away to keep it out of her grubby little hands.
"You know? 1944 Steve is as much of an ass as his 2015 counterpart. I don't know why I thought you would be less-so, but you're as big a jerk as he is."
comes to the realization himself that it needs to be changed. He can drive you up a wall sometimes."
"Well, whatever it was," Tony said and took the book out of Steve's hands, "it doesn't matter. Wasn't this life for either of us."
"Who says they don't get it? And why don't you have any right to be happy? Have you really done anything
"Yeah, 'bubonic plague' wasn't an option," Tony muttered, but Steve blew out a breath and said, "Well, my ma got hit with TB. That's what did her in. Dad died in the war. Mustard gas. Never met him."
For some reason, Steve got the feeling he was more babysitter to this group of nuts than anything else.
He moved over to the elevator, Bucky and Nat and Jim following him over while Thor, oddly, held back, and Steve looked at the others and said, "Not staying?"
"I just realized," he said and glanced down at himself. "I'm, uh…" He reached up and scratched the back of his head. "I'm still kind of, um,
Olivia fell back against him again after losing her balance trying to pull on another box that was bigger than she was. Mug in hand, he stuck the bagel in his mouth and helped her get back up, and she toddled right on back to the presents and began tearing and ripping again.
Some strange and confusing emotion welled up inside of him the moment those words translated in his brain. The best. His daughter didn't just love him, and she didn't just
And then he'd shrugged like there was nothing he could do about it and took a drink of water from the glass on the table on his side of the bed. Tony watched for a moment then said, "I'm sorry,
"It means," he said, trying to choose his words carefully in case things where Olivia came from didn't quite match up with what he knew, "that Daddy thinks I'm a better person than my daddy was." Goddamn, it was weird having to call Cap 'Daddy.'
Barnes nodded at the agent, evidently deciding that was the way he was going to take the question. "He down for the count or—?"
Steve fixed him with a glare that surprisingly shut him up quick, and he took a sharp inhale of breath through his nose and said, “If that’s the way you feel, you can still walk away—”
The clerk nodded, and he reached out and began to toy with a pen on his desk, almost like it was helping him to think, before he said, "So, why not wait until this
"They would," Bruce said, rubbing his forehead like he was nursing a headache. "If Steve was there, they would have pulled the same stuff with him."
He jerked his thumb at Welch at that, but Steve was just staring at the man, confusion reigning before he sat a little straighter and squared his ridiculously broad shoulders and said, "I've never laid one hand on you."
"It is," Tony said with a throaty gasp, Steve's fingers taking a leisurely stroll around the aching nub of his engorged clit. "Oh, god, it is."
"It's the principle of the thing, Steve!" He motioned at the photo again. "Those dresses don't leave much to the imagination. I mean, one of them loses her balance and goes tumbling off that wall, the mystery's gone!"
"I'm serious, man. Captain America just told you how to hit on him. He gave you explicit instructions for how to hit on him. I think he, at least, is under the impression that this isn't an alternate universe."
Tony glanced up, raising an eyebrow at the man that was doing his best to stare back at Tony, innocence written over his face. Tony stared at him a moment more before he blinked and shook his head, telling himself he was crazy. He was looking for correlations and connections where there were none. This was just some guy from Jersey that — somehow — was in possession of Steve's old photos. There was nothing 'there' beyond that.
, Pepper does the dealing with the company now. That's why they pay her the big bucks. I'm just a figurehead."
The crazy space lady turned me into a woman so you would knock me up because we're 'soul mates,' and she says that this is what all soul mates need to complete their 'bond' or whatever-the-fuck it was she said."
"Eh," he said with a shrug. "Could be worse. Could be a lot better, but could be worse." He frowned and tilted his head in thought. "Wanna get a cup of coffee?"
He took a breath and exhaled it, his gaze boring into the flicker of candlelight on the table, and like he was recalling information from long ago, he said, "I remember…talking to Peggy. Making plans with her. We were gonna go to the Stork Club. It's not even around anymore. I remember telling her I didn't know how to dance. I don't… I don't recall the hit. I think I got thrown. I was lying down when they found me, I guess. Last I knew, I was sitting in the pilot's seat."
Tony opened his mouth to snark that Steve made it sound like he weighed a ton, but opening his mouth only led to another yawn, and Steve chuckled and kissed his forehead again.
Steve shrugged. "We'll take our car. I overheard someone say there was valet parking." Tony hedged, not really comfortable leaving his car with the valet, but Steve shrugged. "Or we could walk over. It's up to you."
"He was a fucking flirt that was playing the field, babe. You were looking for a soul mate. He was looking for a good time. How do I know? Because I
"A dresser drawer is perfectly adequate until we can get a crib or a bassinette," Steve countered like he was some kind of authority on the matter.
Tony continued rambling, but Steve had pulled himself together long enough to focus on what Tony had said about he and Howard having 'something going on together.' He didn't want to know what Tony had meant about Howard spending the rest of his life looking for him, though if this was true — if Steve had gone back with the knowledge that he'd
Luckily, it had just gone onto the wrapper Steve's sandwich was sitting on. Served the backwashing bastard right.
"Oh, my god," Tony said and turned to her. "Did you just call it that? Are we in a bad bodice- ripper or something? No, I don't just want my dick; I want my whole body back."
Inside was a small, white box used for clothing, and Tony pulled the top off and pushed aside the red tissue paper to reveal an infant's article of clothing — a maroon onesie with a 'Future Graduate' printed on it along with what looked like a school crest and, in smaller print, 'Rhode Island School of Design.'
of getting her back there. The future, an alternate universe, that is so far beyond the realm of what we can accomplish, it's not even funny, and I can't— We can't keep her here. I can't
"What happened? Am I dead?" asked the voice whose inflection sure sounded like Tony's but whose tone was anything but, and Steve choked out a laugh but hedged on exactly what to say in reply.
Steve laughed. "It's about time it hit you," he said and got up, taking the tray of food with him. "Climb under the covers and close your eyes. I'm gonna take this back to the kitchen so it doesn't end up all over the place in the night."
. You're what keeps him sane. You're what gives him a reason to get up in the morning. Like I said, he has the team and he has the mantle of Captain America, but that's not a reason to
"Well, in that case," he said with a light laugh and made a point of turning from the appetizers to the entrées, "I guess I can look at this side of the menu."
"I want… If we do this, I want… I want to make something clear. I want to try something. I put this on you, you're my Antonia Natasha, understand? I know you're still Tony; I know what you still think of yourself as. But if I put this on you, you're my Antonia with everything that comes with it. I call you 'Antonia' or 'Antonia Natasha.' I tell you 'good girl' instead of 'good boy.' I treat you exactly as I would if you had been born this way, which, really isn't that much different than I treat you now, as far as I'm aware, but with this, there's no question. You're 'Antonia.' You're not 'Tony.' If you're OK with that, I'll put this on you. If not, then I won't, and we'll just do what we've been doing, OK?"
"I'm still surprised by the fact that there is one growing inside of you," Bruce said, and Tony sighed, his shoulders dropping, but Steve shot daggers at him, making Bruce wince and cower just the slightest.
, Tony, male or female. I love your mind and your heart and your sense of humor and your intelligence and the way you yell at me for drinking orange juice straight from the carton or because I'm too lazy to load a dishwasher. I love the way you made the future not so scary for me when it could have been overwhelming, how you taught me how to dance, how you insist I cheat at poker even though you say I can't lie for shit because no one's that lucky at cards. None of that is dependent on the body you're in. That's who you are. That's what I'm attracted to. That's who I'm in love with. The body's just a perk, whether it's hard lines and a cock or supple curves and a clit. As long as I have you, that's all that matters."
Steve froze a moment as though caught in the headlamps before he let out a hefty sigh and said, "Yeah," nodding to firm up his case.
"It's not cruel. Not at all. It is a fail-safe, a measure to help prevent against miscarriage early on in the gestation. The newly formed life is fragile and is at risk. To connect its life to the life of the mother guards it from any means that might prevent it from developing to term."
Both Pepper and Natasha put their orders in for one of those half-price cosmos, and Tony frowned and suddenly wished he'd thought twice about agreeing to come to someplace like this. He'd been dry for well over a year now, but he knew there would always be that urge in him to have just
" Steve murmured, more to himself than to Tony or Rhodey, and Rhodey shook off his concern and said, "Don't worry about it. Tones's pop culture references are just forty years out of date."
But she looked up, eyes big and brown, and she stared right at Tony and said in a choked voice, "Papa!" and scrambled to her feet before she threw herself at him, wrapping her arms around his thighs and pressing her face into his hip.
"Maybe he just didn't meet the right one yet," Tony said with a shrug only to receive a very flat look from Steve. "I'm just saying. We started out by taking pot-shots at each other on a Helicarrier. Now look at us: old and married and set in our ways."
Steve looked a little sheepish, averting his gaze as he looked down at the rumpled sheets between them. "Nat gave me some stuff to read."
"What Cap tells Stark every night," Barton said, and Tony rolled his eyes and decided not to dignify such a stupid comment with a response.
Tony put his hands up. "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hold up there, slick! What are you apologizing for? As I recall, there were two of us there, and I remember not just being an active participant in the shenanigans but actually encouraging it."
"What? Speculating on Cap's sex life — or lack thereof, anyway? Come on, you don't think he's some ninety-three-year-old virgin, do you? And even if he were — especially if he were — don't you think he'd be practically salivating to get his rocks off already? Guy's a fucking monk, as far as I can tell. And, look, I get that he's older than dirt and he comes from a time where people were more backward and repressed than they are today, but that's not the repression of someone that fantasizes about the half of society that has two 'X' chromosomes. That's the repression of someone that fantasizes about getting on his knees and sucking brain."
He swallowed the lump of emotion that had bubbled up into his throat and said a gravelly and unsteady, "Yeah, sure."
Tony eyed it warily for a moment before he handed his bag over to Steve and then squared his shoulders and stepped up onto the riser then sat down on the hard vinyl, the paper crinkling beneath him. He lay back against the pillow as the doctor directed him to and then pulled up his shirt and pulled the waistband of his pants down some when he was directed to do that, his belly — because, honestly, that's what it was now — sticking up in the air.
Hill and Natasha nodded their agreement — at what part of Rhodey's statement, Tony wasn't sure — and Tony frowned and took a breath before he said, "Yeah, I should probably call her to explain, shouldn't I?"
. I just—" She reached out as though to put her hands to his belly, and she bit her lip a little and looked up at him to make sure it was OK to do so before she did.
He looked down at his naked form, at the small belly that bulged out in front of him, at breasts that just wouldn't seem to stop growing. He felt the baby move within him, and he reached down and tried to comfort himself with the touch again, but the shitty bathroom light reflected off the ring on his finger, drawing his attention to that.
"Negatory on that, Widow. Sounds like you guys and gals could use my help whether you want it or not. J, take me where I'm needed most. And if these doors open back up to the penthouse, I'm giving you to the Golden Slumbers old folks' home, got it? Not for the staff but for the residents. Let's see how you enjoy dealing with octo- and nonagenarians. Not all of them are as tech-savvy as Steve."
"Don't you mean am I still going to marry you? I already asked, and you already said 'yes.' And does this mean you're actually going to try—"
