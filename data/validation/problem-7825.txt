you don't mean that," Steve said after DUM-E had taken off after it again.
Tony turned, greeted with the sight of his returned paramour. "Finally. Where the hell did you park the car? Hoboken?"
Tony reached out and grabbed Steve's tie, and he pulled himself up to a sitting position with it and said, "This goes, too," before he loosened it and pulled it away from him. They both worked at a frenzied pace to get the buttons undone on Steve's shirt before Steve just growled and ripped the damned thing open, buttons popping and pinging off various surfaces in the room.
"Do it. Try it. You have to."
"Guess it was too much to hope for the fairy tale bright sunshine and chirping birds, yeah?" Tony mused as Hill passed out umbrellas to the group.
Tony shrugged. "Actually stumbling into an alternate universe? Hasn't so far. Getting a glimpse of an alternate universe, though?" He scratched at his jaw. "Yeah, we might have some experience with that."
"No, bullshit, something's over there. Something's got you spooked. Something—" He gasped and turned to look as well, even though Steve kept dragging him back up the road toward the cabin, dirt and gravel crunching beneath their sneakers. "Fuck! Fuck, I knew it! What'd I tell you?"
He shrugged. "Go ahead. Knock yourself out."
"Yeah, really sounds like a thrilling prospect for you."
"Uh…who is this man?" he heard Bruce ask Rhodey.
Jesus, they marketed the shit out of the Avengers wherever this kid came from, didn't they? He hoped someone was making decent money off the stuff.
Bruce just shook his head. "Whatever, Tony."
"What're y' doin'?"
Bruce grimaced. "Not a visual I needed. Thanks, Tony."
"That's OK, snicker doodle," Tony called out to him. "You've heard worse about me."
Tony snorted another bitter laugh. "I can afford to be. There's still a tiny part of me that thinks Steve really is going to walk off that Quinjet with the rest of them."
He sniffed one more time and wiped the remnants of stray tears from his face before he swallowed and signaled to pull back onto the road, waiting until the sparse amount of traffic passed before he pulled back onto the roadway. He drove in silence for what was probably a couple miles before he snuffled, wiped under his nose, swallowed, and said, "Look, not that you can hear me — and even if you could, not that you could understand me, but...did I ever tell you about your grandmother...?"
"You will."
"He's going to be OK, Tony," Bruce said, sounding like his patience was wearing thin.
"She gets it from you," Tony was saying as he walked back into the room, and Steve turned, chocolate still in hand, and watched as Tony went around the couch and snatched up his coffee from the table.
is so funny,
Tony reached out and put a hand to Steve's face. "Look, I love you. You know I love you. I'm just—" He clammed up and shook his head. "Forget I said anything."
"This — this thing. This baby. Is it just a baby? It's not something… It's not something more evil than that, right? Is there any way to tell? I'm not just an incubator for one of Hydra's more deranged plots, am I?"
He smiled against his lips when his husband moaned at that, loving how sensitive his perky little knobs were.
“Peter, ignore nosey-rosey over there. You don’t have to talk to us about it if you don’t want to,” the blonde said pointedly as he brought out plates for everyone. The arachnid shook his head fondly, long since aware of his darker-haired father’s antics.
“No,” he cried again, “she doesn’t even love him, so he’s only my Daddy!” Peter tightened his tiny arms around the brunette, head buried in his stomach – away from his bandaged heart – as he continued crying his little eyes out.
“Are you encouraging me to date a masked vigilante slash possible bad guy?” Peter teased with a smile.
“It’s...well...it’s incredibly unlikely, but would make sense of the unplanned pregnancy…”
He and Tony were walking Coulson to the elevator, still skeptical about the young superhero. None of them were exactly sure who he was, after Coulson had informed them he had spoken to Charles before coming to see them. When the elevator doors closed, that’s when they heard the scream. The two fathers looked at each other before running to Peter’s room.
“Ah...she ever get you between your legs?” the blonde asked with a smirk as the brunette returned the smile.
, he thought as he chugged the water he had also purchased and made his way to the fast food chain next door to use their bathroom.
“Where is he?” the blonde growled out, startling Tony who’d never heard him that angry before.
“Thank you. You are of course invited, Wade. And well, your Dad wants to invite half the planet for a big blow out.”
Even when the pizza arrived and Steve let everyone eat in the living room, she stayed disengaged until she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned, blinking in surprise when she saw her Tati moving to sit next to her, unaware that he had even moved.
“I wanted to…” Wade fumbled again. He handed Peter the flowers in lieu of continuing. Peter took them happily, glad Wade had remembered his favorite flowers.
Him dozing off in classes, drool and everything.
“What time do you want us there, babe?” Steve asked, suddenly aware of the slip of the nickname, neither having said such an endearment to each other. Tony’s eyes widened like Steve’s as they looked at each other, a smile spreading across the brunette’s face in glee.
“As a heart attack. Get it?” he quipped with a smile, only earning a glare from the teen.
“Oh jeez, I genuinely thought I was going to have a meltdown all over again! That was the quickest diffusion ever. Well done, Cap-i-ton,” she joked in a rhyme. Steve could still see the smile in her eyes as she said it. She continued laying on her back, her knees brought up to take some of the pressure off her bottom.
“Seven years?” Bucky choked out with a growl, eyes on Clint though he could see his daughter put herself in front of the blonde defensively. If he was in his right mind, he would’ve congratulated her, but right now his head hurt from the influx of information he had registered in the last few minutes.
“–me too…” his husband whispered.
“It’s…been challenging,” he said honestly, crossing his arms over his chest, looking away from his Pop as he thought over the last week with his foster son. “He won’t let me anywhere near him, barely let’s Wade close enough to comfort him from his nightly screaming terrors, which we've had to pad his room to keep the twins from hearing it. He keeps looking at me like I’m going to hit him or...worse…” he trailed off as he let his Pop pull him in for another hug.
“Who’s here, Keisha?” Mrs. Rhodes asked, standing up from the table where the family was in fact eating dinner. There were two other girls sitting at the table, the youngest in a high chair.
said about you because you are without a doubt my daughter; but again, none of that was
Steve somehow – who was she kidding, he was a damn super soldier – managed to pin Em under his legs, holding a squirming Peter in his arms, taking a breath before speaking again.
“Wait!” she cried with her hands extended to stop him. “Aren’t I too old to…” she fully cringed before finishing “…go over your knee?” She opened one eye back at him, opening the other when he actually looked like he was thinking it over.
“What would Pepper say if you wore it to a meeting?” Steve asked curiously, pausing another moment to readjust the genius. He chuckled at that, wondering himself.
“Emerson our session is over, I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am that you’ve told me this. It hurts and it’s still raw, but I promise you this is what progress looks like,” Kate said quietly. Emerson nodded before standing up, offering a small smile before leaving to the lobby. Her Dad was waiting for her, sprawled on one of the seats – playing on one of his tablets. He smiled at her when she went to stand in front of him.
“This doesn’t have to change anything, okay? I mean I get it changes things, but we don’t have to let it? If that makes sense?” Tony offered kindly.
“- Ooh! Mama grab the photo of Steve and Bucky in tutus!”
“Just have fun and be safe, Peter. You have our numbers in case you need it,” Steve said.
“Hush, bear, none of this is your fault.”
why I married you,” the bastard finished with a raised brow.
But then that wonderful man of his pulled him into a quick kiss, pulling back to say a quick but passionate “I love you too.”
“What do you want Rumlow?”
“Great,” Steve said under his breath as they heard the ding of the elevator followed by the two agents arguing over one another.
And to top it all off, his dau-   well… foster daughter – was spending the night at a “friend’s” house. She had called him after school to ask and well… he couldn’t say ‘no’ right?
She literally shudders at the thought, what would’ve happened if she’d lost both? She would’ve ended up in foster care. No one would want to adopt an epileptic twelve year old. And she’s heard enough stories from an old classmate of hers in foster care that was only in her school for about a month. The horrors some of those kids go through…
“I love you too, Tony,” he responded immediately, smiling when he heard his love hum happily.
“No, you don’t get it.” She finally looked up at them. “They were asking me about dick sizes and wanted comparisons! I told them I saw those men as “uncles” and never thought of them like that. That’s when…” she trailed off breaking eye contact again.
Morgan was holding what little was left of her ice cream cone, adorably covered in chocolate and sprinkles in Steve’s arms - which were also covered in chocolate.
“Looks he’s not the only one who needs to get laid. Happy to lend you my services, Romanoff,” Rumlow sneered at her as she offered him a middle finger in response.
Daci kept an eye on the woman, unless she was kissing or groping her father. Then she looked anywhere but. She had talked to Clint about it when he was showing her how to shoot her new toy bow. He said it was normal to be selfish about spending time with her father. He wouldn’t say the words, but she could tell he wasn’t a big fan of Vivienne either.
“I’ll have you know I was a ruffian myself at her age. Actually, I was twice as bad as her, a few drinks in the daytime really isn’t that bad.”
He focused his attention on the beautiful man in front of him, running his hand through the brown curls that were getting long.
…but then she remembered what has been bothering her about this woman…
“You’re awake, sleeping beauty,” Steve said fondly, hand moving to caress Tony’s cheek. After several more kisses from his love his son joined them, unaccompanied by his sister. After being reassured Sam was with her, he focused on hugging his oldest. And then not much longer, she was finally there. Beautiful and watery green eyes bored into his before she moved to curl herself up around him.
“Mr. Stark, I don’t take accusations lightly–”
Tony just kept that shit-eating grin on his face, wiggling his eyebrows as his friend groaned loudly before following him back inside. As they sat together on the couch, Tony found himself thinking about Joey and what she was doing today. He knew Steve had a 24 hour shift, so she must be bored out of her mind stuck at the apartment. He pulled his phone out to text Steve, not remembering if she was still in trouble or not.
“Oh y’all wait till the next game where y’all can’t gang up on me,” Sam said sending a glare to Emerson.
“Excuse me,” he whipped around to face Steve, “your children
“Don’t insult Tony,” Steve countered, though it fell on deaf ears.
grampa!” she laughed as they broke apart and made their way outside to the parking lot. She was surprised when she was lifted off the ground, fingers digging into her ribs.
“Good afternoon bambino! Did you have a good nap?” Tony cooed as he lifted the pup up into his arms and kissed both of his cheeks. “Let’s get your diaper changed, handsome. I was thinking we put you in some little swimmers and a hat and then later we’ll wear your ‘I love my Papa’ onesie. How does that sound?” Peter answered with some more babbling, which the Omega interpreted as agreement.
“What? I don’t hate it, I just don’t like it. It’s a preference thing, I’ve always coughed up a lung when I tried smoking. I know you smoke, doll. I know it helps with your anxiety and stuff. I wouldn’t step in unless I thought you were doing something addictive.” Clint continued staring at the brunette a moment longer, sitting there in awe until Lucky brought him the rope toy to play with.
She didn’t hear anyone trying to stop her, nor would she have listened.
His one eyebrow raised smirk that he often saw Peter doing on his own.
“Let’s see what he’s doing first. J, what’s Barton up to?” Tony asked his AI, since the archer was most likely asleep. It was after noon after all.
Pepper and Rhodey both suddenly appeared in front of the family, smiling and redirecting them out to the other exit.
Well, maybe two…
“I am obviously in support of speaking to someone for help but I’m not always so keen when people get forced into it. So, allow me to both apologize and thank you for coming. I imagine this…can’t be easy for you…”
"Jarvis where is my son?"
Steve thought seven was a reasonable time for Tony to finally wake up – but apparently Peter thought it was five. Insisted on it, according to May’s voicemail. She had to go to work anyway, so Pepper and Rhodey met her at the hospital to take Pete for her.
.” She kept staring at the colors until she heard the bathroom door open again.
She made her way to the lab and punched in the code Tony had given her to enter the lab. She found Tony just as J had described – minus the pool of drool. She carefully walked around DUM-E to grab his arm. “Come on big guy” she grunted as she helped the grumbling toddler into a sitting position. Brown eyes peaked through the thick eyelashes at her, almost in disbelief.
EMERSON
“Daddy?” Peter asked sleepily.
. It took her another moment to recognize the figure was Spiderman, the masked vigilante who her parents had been talking about recently. He dropped from the ceiling walking to the touch-screen on the wall.
"He can call me Flower if he wants to," his Dad quoted the movie as he walked with their Pop into the kitchen to eat.
“Thanks for teaching me, Clint,” she said before she pulled back, reaching for the bow before they were interrupted by the ceiling robot.
The day of their wedding, Steve was having trouble wrangling the four and a half year old into his tiny tux. Joey stood unimpressed by their side.
“He...he apparently has moved back to take over his father’s company. And yes, Harley, he does want to meet you,” Tony said, eyes still on Steve who deflated from the statement.
“I was a goner from the moment I met you two and you tackled your father into the mud,” she said with a laugh, making Bucky join in. “Even if your Dad didn’t want anymore kids, I would’ve been thrilled to have you guys. Although I wouldn’t trade what I have now for the world.”
“Why? Because I’m right?” she sassed. The blonde took a long breath before continuing in a lower tone.
“No, it’s obviously not noth-” Clint stopped abruptly when it clicked in his brain. “James?”
But once again, Cheryl was right and he was totally wrong. Clint’s mental health had improved drastically and he truly loved that pup.
He turned to his husband, smiling at seeing him with his arms crossed and looking so damn proud of their girl. Joey quickly released her captive before walking back over to her dads with an adorably shit-eating grin.
“That’s totally fine,” he said quickly, feeling a bit silly for thinking otherwise. He needed to trust her more.
"Are you fucking kidding-"
and tease Clint for having little kids and...I didn't know if you two would want to meet him let alone let him stay here or anything like that -"
“What?” Steve asked as Tony moved to stand up.
"-YOU'RE IRON MAN?!?" the boy screamed in excitement, causing the genius to stumble a little before standing up to steady himself. Tony nodded to the little boy jumping around his sister and screaming.
“No way in hell,” Steve answered quickly, looking to see if his husband disagreed. The man didn’t, probably just as concerned about the injury as he was.
“Hey,” the brunette said, hands on his hips as he looked down at Clint.
“And you must be the famous Harley! If I didn’t know any better I’d think you were Steve’s secret love child.” Steve cringed at his Pop’s words, watching as the pup considered those words before pinching his face together. But before the boy could loudly say how wrong she was, Becca made her way over to the group..
Peter was taking his nap while the party continued but Tony would wake soon. The Omega watched the monitor as the baby began to stir and blink his eyes open. With a smile, Tony stretched his limbs out before standing up and making his way back inside.
Later that night they ordered in, feeding each other the decadent dessert and ruining the nice couch.
Of Steve finally,
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s a big deal! Twenty years of being blessed as my trophy husband, why wouldn’t you want to celebrate it?”
“Night sweetheart,” Tony said before letting her go.
“…I can’t sleep thinking about seeing him again. Last time I saw him…” he trailed off thinking about watching police arrest a drunk Ty that had broken into Tony’s mansion.
Steve found himself too exhausted to try and reprimand him, simply humming in response as he fell into a peaceful slumber wrapped around the love of his life.
“Apa?” she asked the man, who finally tucked and rolled to face his kid. Steve turned towards her and let out a laugh, since the baby had her head on the ground and butt in the air.
“Your uncle tried to get me to take you off his hands when your dad died.”
The reasoning would have to do for now, as she turned sharply on her heels to head to her next class.
,” Clint rushed out, still feeling the pang of fear and rawness from being so open.
EMERSON
His mother burst into tears, catching Tony a little off guard and unable to stop more tears from spilling down his cheeks. His father sat stoically and stared off at a wall, silent.
“Hey,” was all she offered to the Asgardian.
“Oh, you don’t have to,” Joey started to say.
It was only about an hour and a half later when he heard the elevator ding. His love walked in with a crockpot in both his hands and was sporting a backpack as he made his way into the kitchen. Peter moved around to greet him and helped him with the crockpot, accepting the kiss on the cheek Wade gave him.
That image did not help his heart, though he pushed through the pain to walk over to the boy with his arms reaching out for him.
“Yeah, I was thinking about that…” Peter began, smiling when Wade hung his head before continuing. “I thought of a few ways you could make it up to me…”
“And? You’re going to meet tons of beautiful people. Ones that are crazy smart like you…”
“It’s illegal?” she tried. He smiled and nodded before responding.
“Like I’m going to strangle you once I get off this floor,” the former assassin growled, laying on the floor for a few moments longer as his head throbbed. After a moment he sat up and rubbed his head, which now felt incredibly foggy.
“Speaking of birthdays…” Sam said with a smile as he placed the trey on the table between them. “Happy thirtieth man.”
"Congrats Emerson!" the boy shouted as he nearly tackled his sister in happiness. She couldn't get a word in to thank him as she was smothered from both sides by her parents who also offered their congratulations.
“I found… look, I don’t know how to describe it. They didn’t look at me like I’m some disgusting dying animal they feel obligated to take pity on. And they don’t see me as a toy for their own using. Need I remind everyone they are also gay and therefore have no sexual interest in me –”
“Xa – did you know they would do that?”
One by one they took down every team that tried to take them on. Carol and Rhodey, Sam and Ororo, Pepper and Happy...they completed dominated Tony and Steve, high fiving each other as the other teens made excuses and demanded rematches.
Tears began welling up in her eyes at the thought of her flashback.
That she was still savable.
} he said before pulling her back into a hug. After a moment, Daci spoke quietly.
“Jo?” he asked quietly, causing more tears to spill down her cheeks as she looked up at him. He had anger and fear and pain combined on his face.
“If you’re about to ask me to perform tricks or something…” he whispered angrily.
“Okay?” she asked between planting kisses all over his face, one of her hands supporting the back of his head to keep him in place.
Relief washed over her to the point she started crying again.
“An engagement ring, yeah.” She threw her hands up in excitement as she let out a cheer, letting out a laugh when some bubbles got on her father’s face. “I take it you like the idea?”
“I haven’t shared a heat with him yet! It can’t be possible, right?” he asked after showing Bruce the very stick he had just recently peed on. And the doctor noticed as well, leaning away from him as the two sat in Banner’s lab.
.” He took this opportunity to tuck some of the hair behind her ear as she looked down, finding the next words to come out more easily for the seasoned father.
His family waved to the boy in acknowledgement but didn’t otherwise crowd him. Instead they focused their attention on the one toddler attacking the teen, while the other crawled over his grandfather to join in the assault. Laughter spread throughout the room as Pete noticed a small smile appearing on Leo’s face.
When she had passed out in his arms in her bathroom, Tony felt a mixed rush of emotions. While he was thrilled to get to hold the teen close like this, the circumstances weren’t…the preferred method. After Steve cleaned the wound, he instinctually pulled her into his arms, following the blonde into the living room where his husband almost had a full meltdown.
“Edward,” the brunette said proudly, which did not change the frown on her face.
“Steve, say something bad about your husband. Show Bucky that in normal relationships you can say something negative about your partner, even your spouse,” the doctor said to Steve, confusing everyone but the genius’ further.
"How did you even meet a woman?" Nat asked suspiciously, not appearing to be happy about the news either.
“Emerson,” the woman whispered voice thick with tears. The teen remained turned away from her birth mother, but her feet didn’t move as she waited. “Remember,
“Joey!” he said excitedly as he ran over to the teen, who stumbled a little as the toddler climbed onto her lap. She gently pushed the cup away as she got her bearings, wrapping her arms around the boy in comfort.
“Ashley?” Steve asked in a more confident voice as Tony suddenly remembers she had another name in her past life. The blonde then gently sat next to the man as they both cracked the door open a little more to see.
“You’d need to be inside the restaurant to see her doing that…” Tony said accusingly, smiling when his boyfriend’s cheeks blushed harder. “But I appreciate the gesture,” he added as he also placed a hand on Steve’s inner thighs, making the blonde blush even harder as his cheeks turned red.
He made it back to Peter’s fairly quickly, swinging through the streets and making sure no one could see him before changing in his brother’s backyard. Peter had built what looked like a shed, but housed all of Spiderman’s suits and weapons. After throwing on a pair of sweats, he climbed the stairs of the back porch before letting himself in through the backdoor.
touch it, Pops!” Steve hid his laugh with both hands covering his face while Tony just continued laughing openly, head thrown back.
“Uh huh. You didn’t follow me out here to get me alone?” the brunette purred, which had the Alpha melting a little next to him.
And then he flipped to the more adult rated drawings, eyebrows shooting up as he heard his boyfriend chuckle next to him.
“Hey, remember our rule? No one can be held accountable when they’re brainwashed. Clint’s still breathing, he’ll be okay. I promise no one blames you for this, cub.”
“Daci? Want some help doing a handstand?” he asked the girl as Peter started walking on his hands, still being assisted by his uncle. When he looked back toward the girl, he burst out a laugh seeing the look on her face.
“I won’t sugar coat it. That
“Dad if you love me you
“Fine, I’m Sonny. I’ll just never go skiing,” he teased. Tony laughed at that, taking a glance at the teen behind him – who had a small frown on her face. When she realized Tony was looking, she instantly switched to a polite smile. Tony turned back to Steve to see if he’d noticed, only to find he hadn’t and was staring at a picture on the wall.
"Why do they want to send him away?" Tony asked gently.
“Come on Tony, don’t play dumb with me. I know the chances of high school sweethearts surviving long distance relationships is minimal to none.”
“Uh, yeah, that’d be awesome,” she said with a blush, looking like she genuinely loved that idea. He can’t remember the last time the two of them had done something fun together, noting that in his head for later as he pushed away that guilty thought.
“Joey this is Pete, Pete this is Joey,” the brunette explained with a smile.
Two cop cars and an ambulance were parked outside the place, along with a red truck parked half way on the sidewalk.
Which, if Peter was being honest with himself, he’d never get tired of.
“Peter Pan!” the man shouted just as excitedly, throwing the three year old up in the air a few times. “Did you have a nice nap?”
“Yeah...look I should apologize…” the Omega began, shame coming off his scent.
“What’s wrong, Bambi?” Tony asked.
He turned her around, still wobbly on her two tiny legs as she squealed at seeing how happy her Daddy was. Bucky looked close to crying, scooting back to see if she could add a few steps. When she did, he lifted her up into his arms in joy.
“A week,” James confessed, shrugging a shoulder when Clint looked back up at him. “I’ve known for a while though…”
She smiled as she stepped away from the curtain shaking her head as she heard her named called, falling in line to accept her diploma. She walked on stage and heard the deafening cheer from her family as she stole a glance at them before accepting the paper; laughing aloud at the sight of them all on their feet cheering - plus Wade's sign.
Around 3 in the afternoon, Sharon came to the rescue. She had just gotten off a 24 hour shift but was kind enough to take the remainder of Steve’s as he promised her multiple favors in return. Before he left he sent a text to Jo’s phone, letting her know he was coming back. He drove a little over the speed limit back, having felt terrible when he told Joey he’d forgotten the night before. The kid looked damn terrified at the very idea, but nodded because what else could she have said?
“Yeah but...tell me you haven’t at least had second thoughts about all of this! I mean come on Stevie, you’re in your prime already settled down,” Bucky said, waving his arms around for emphasis before finishing his drink. The kids’ drawings littered the fridge and there were two stuffed animals currently occupying the other bar stools. The blonde rolled his eyes fondly before crossing his arms over his chest.
There...that made Tony feel better. He took two deep breaths before heading back into the living room to try and help his son get through this.
destroy their careers as well as their souls," Peter spoke up, still hugging their little brother. Pop groaned before moving his hand to cover his son's mouth as well in exasperation.
“It was his favorite movie as a kid,” Steve explained. “He dressed up as Bambi for Halloween and was incredibly cute doing so, so the nickname stuck.”
He froze as his uncle grabbed the knife and quickly yanked it out of place. He gritted his teeth this time, breathing harshly to not reveal his identity in any way. The superhero pulled some bandages from his belt and instructed Spiderman to hold them to his shoulder.
“Joey?” she heard Tony ask as he rested his hand on the blanket over her hip.
“You’re right, he’s actually a coward. You could totally kick his ass,” he said confidently as she wiped her eyes tiredly.
"Well, before we get to that, you guys should open this box," Peter said as he handed the box to his excited Dad and ignored his Pop with his one raised eyebrow.
There was a stare off...or more words could have been said.
“How’d you and Tony meet, May?” she asked as she sat next to her on the couch. Peter had just fallen asleep after Jo read him a few stories, willingly obliging her little brother’s request when he had asked her.
hadn’t returned Steve’s call and had just let her come back early? Without her meds? He was planning on giving her a piece of mind about that.
"Fine, did uh...did you sleep okay Pop?" she said looking questioningly at his unshaven face. He rubbed his cheek absently, a little self conscious of it.
“That doesn’t make them fish, Steve! Dolphins swim but they’re mammals, not fish.”
It got through to her, you know…for the most part.
Before Steve could ask a follow up, the tiny super soldier did a back flip that ended in a handstand. It earned a well deserved applause from everyone else, whose attention had turned to the little acrobat.
He heard shouts coming from somewhere inside followed by the sounds of pounding feet. Eventually the door opened and there was Tony - covered in grease and looking surprised.
Leonardo Rodriguez, a ‘troubled’ seven year old who was recently taken by the state away from his father. His abusive, drug addicted, violent motherfucker of a father. Which in turn, unsurprisingly, made Leo a ‘violent child’ according to his case files. He’d never hold that against the kid, but he had two babies (and honestly, his own mental health) to consider.
“Don’t be.”
“For what? Wanting the love of your life to
After insensitively comparing her PTSD to that on the battlefield, she angrily reminded him that voluntarily signing up at eighteen is different than not even being old enough to offer consent.
“Cause they’re my family and I love them.” She thought those words over and considered what the Avengers meant to her. They certainly treated her like family, maybe it was time she did the same.
Steve slowly walked over to defiant teen. “The punishment, my son, is being tickled until admitting defeat. Now,” he said this with an eerie calm as he leaned over, inches away from Peter’s face, “I’m going to grab us some napkins. And when I come back, this seat had better be empty.” He gave Peter a quick peck on his nose, which cause the two teenagers to erupt in laughter.
"Gotcha," he said mostly to himself, pulling his phone out to snap the pic before turning his husband back around to face him.
After several more drinks, Steve focused all of his energy on not touching the Omega, even though his instincts screamed to wrap him up in his arms and kiss him silly. He was just so pretty. And kind. And so smart it made Steve feel like an idiot, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
“Steve also has ears and is standing right next to you,” the blonde groaned out as he joined the others on the couch. “Why don’t we go back to Bucky cheating on Clint?” Steve knew, okay? He knew he shouldn’t have said it, cause he knew exactly who his brother was.
“See? Tired of having his brother. It just comes with the territory, son. Let Harley pout now about no longer being the baby and later they’ll be thick as thieves. You’ll be wishing they were more separate instead of joining forces and plotting against you two...which...can come from two boys.”
“–you know Kevin that sounds an awful lot like an excuse, which I distinctly remember saying I don’t need right now…”
“…you hate hiking,” the blonde pointed out before slowly walking over to the man.
When she pulled away, she gave him a look that confused the genius before she turned to the other two.
Joey really liked May and loved that she made her feel welcome in her own home. Not a lot of parent’s ex’s would willingly watch their new partner’s kid. But as Joey was learning, May was a damn Saint.
“Can I see him?” Leo asked excitedly, bouncing on his feet. Two nights ago the kid had a nightmare that his father was beating him to death - Peter only knew because Wade later told him. And now, well, Peter couldn’t deny the kid the right to see his father.
“De unde a venit asta?” he asked her in a quiet voice. She shrugged a little before replying. {
"Hey Petey, how's mom and Ben doing?" he asked their son.
“You’re starting to grow on me, Barnes. I never approve of the schmucks dingus over there brings home, but you seem like a decent guy.”
“You know, you used to be fun,” Joey muttered, though loud enough for Steve to hear.
want to
“Wade…”
haven’t watched the twins solo.” He took the opportunity to eat more of his fries before his Dad responded.
” he croaked out, feeling emotional whiplash as the brunette presented him with a small box. He watched as the man he loved opened it to reveal a silver ring inside. Clint was frozen, felt stuck between a dream and the reality of what was happening.
“Yeah he’s just being a clingy leach today.” Daci wrapped her arms around Morgan as a thought popped into her head.
(three sessions later)
“Babies smell like that Tony,” Joe said behind his magazine, unfazed by the glare the genius threw his way.
“Everything okay?”
“The baby can hear me?” Harley asked, trying to hide a smile as he leaned closer. “Hi baby, I’m your brother. We have the same Daddy, but know he was mine first.” Tony chuckled and hugged his son again, planting a kiss on his pup’s head.
He still felt guilty, even though his husband reminded him many times on the plane ride over that they needed this. It wasn’t until he looked out the window and saw the beautiful island that he was finally starting to agree with his husband. He turned to the man who was equally giddy with excitement as they began their descent.
"No sweetie, that's not what we were talking about," the genius said gently before stealing a look from his old friend. "Of course I want you Miles, I just... I was scared because..." he stumbled, unsure how to explain it.
“Fuck you,” she said in disgust.
“Steve’s bonded, who cares? Did you know my Alpha wants to fuck another Omega?” The attention temporarily turned to Bucky who looked shocked and angry from the question.
They hadn’t discussed Joey calling them anything other than their names, figuring she’d feel weird about calling either of them ‘dad’ after her own died. Yet here she was, calling him by the name he’d loved hearing from Peter’s mouth. The grin spread across his face as he reached his arms out and quickly pulled her into a hug, ignoring her immediate protests.
“I’ve got plenty of those, what I need is some damn answers.”
So he walked after the ball in one of Steve’s comfy hoodies, enjoying how the sun felt against his face. He should’ve known his good day wouldn’t last, as a purposeful cough caught his attention just as he reached the ball.
“I know, Steve,” the brunette said, ducking his head away and walking past him. Steve turned around and watched him walk towards a table with some mechanical device on it. He followed him, looking at all the machinery and computers until he heard a kind of chirp sound.
“It’s what it always is, Steve. My stupid insecurities getting the better of me,” Tony said as he laid back against their bed. Steve laid beside him, propped on his elbow as he rested his other hand on the man’s chest and waited for him to continue. “You know how I’m old, right? And you’re going to outlive me and...I don’t know maybe I want a say in who replaces me a-”
“Oh...well, that means she’s the one who he’s been meeting with all this time at SHIELD. She’s been making sure he’s okay.” Daci frowned at that, because she realized why Steve said it was illegal...and wondered why Clint was almost defending her.
She had a seizure last night.
Maybe he should’ve taken those sports scholarships he was offered. Maybe he should’ve applied for more schools. Whatever. None if it mattered now.
He dunked the man in retaliation, quickly resurfacing him as he brought him up enough to kiss his lips. The two laughed after another wave rolled over them, holding onto each other.
“Oh god it’s morning! You guys can’t go five minutes without groping each other?” Peter asked, bypassing them as he poured himself a cup of coffee. Steve smiled before gently letting Tony down, moving to whip something up for breakfast.
Two chapters whaaaaaat? I honestly just hate Stone and want yall to meet Pappy. This fic is like 99% done so maybe I'll upload 2 more tomorrow >:D also thank you so much for the lovely comments - they always inspire me to write more! Xoxo
“Tony,” he heard his husband say. He looked up into those beautiful blue eyes, knowing he could read his mind. “He’ll get through this. He’s our kid, remember?” The genius smiled at his love, knowing he was right. His smile faded as he looked down to the hand on his arm, the one with the silver band signifying their union.
“Eh,” she said while waving her hand, just to be a little shit.
“Yes, well…about that. Peter?” his uncle asked, turning to the once-again frozen teen.
“Auntie can you get da toys?” she heard one of the toddlers shout, looking behind her at the numerous inflatable toys. She stood up to get out of the pool, climbing out and calling back to her niece and/or nephew.
“Are you a monster?” he asked fondly, watching her cover her body in more bubbles.
“What do you wanna do about Pete?” the blonde asked quietly.
"Whatever feels right baby boy, we'll love you no matter who you end up loving," the brunette said as he walked around and kissed the boy's cheek. Emerson smiled before she started leaving the kitchen again.
He sat waiting for her on the couch, sprawled out comfortably as he swiped across his tablet, playing a game Peter had got him hooked on. He was wearing his reading glasses with the TV on in the background, still dressed in his work clothes sans shoes and jacket. A moment later, the elevators dinged and Joey walked in. Though she threw a small smile in his direction, she still hesitated in the entranceway before coming closer.
“No, sorry that actually wasn’t sarcastic. Dad used to say the
“That’s great,” Steve said with a smile.
"You're not taking my puppy on my birthday," Steve said with a pout, splashing his brother while the other hand rested on Tony's thigh. The water also got Harley who was clinging onto Bucky's neck.
The three sat in silence on the ride home and in the elevator and continued until Peter spoke up when they all arrived back to their living room.
Now that James had baseball practice after school, he was able to use more free time to smoke his brains out. Cause when he did, he didn’t have anxiety attacks or flashbacks. He just got to zone out, usually listening to music and eating junk food.
“Xavier! Hey buddy, good to see you,” he said as he walked over to give the shy teen a hug. The young man was taller than Tony, but that didn’t stop him from treating him like the kid he was.
“Oh yeah, that conversation. What...wait how would talking about his now girlfriend upset you?”
tell him while I help Miles take his bags upstairs," Steve said as he moved to stand up off the couch. He noted that his daughter grimaced at the prospect, tucking that away when they'd eventually be alone. Currently, though, Tony was trying to intervene with his husband finding the possibly over abundance of toys when Miles helped postpone the inevitable lecture with an interruption.
"You formed this big family that we love, you helped Peter get the courage to date the man he'd eventually marry, you brought Miles into our lives...we just wanted to thank you, Emerson. With your past...we're just so proud of the person you've become. And we love you so much for it," her Pop added, smiling when Emerson felt her own eyes water at the sentiment.
“Wait…no…” she began to say, because it almost seemed like he had planned to see her just as she was walking to a certain teacher’s classroom…
“Wow...can not believe Steve finally found a mate. And with a beautiful Omega, no less,” his sister, also an Omega, said as she threw a wink Tony’s way. Steve stamped on his inner Alpha from growling at his sister, who had recently come out as only being attracted to other Omegas. “And what a cute pup! Hey Harley, wanna come play some XBox?” she asked the boy who looked like he was trying to resist the offer. Ever since they arrived, he’s been glued to Tony’s hip.
“That I had no idea but that he should get you something nice though since apparently you’re paying for everything,” they both smiled at that. “And that, if he hurt you I’d rip his dick off and feed it to him.” Peter almost immediately fell off the bench from that. He regained his balance, looking at her smile realizing fully what she was saying. So, he did have a date for prom. Wade did actually say yes.
,” she whispered back against her pillow, feeling warm and safe and so very…very tired.
“Nature didn’t make you fall on your face,” his husband pointed out obnoxiously. “Trying to grab my ass while not paying attention did that for ya.” Tony huffed in response.
“It’s fine Tony, the market is on the way here,” Steve said as he placed the bags on the counter, pulling Tony into his arms once they were free. “Plus I got to show off my arms when carrying the bags,” he teased, flexing his arms as he said it. The air momentarily changed to the sweet smell of Omega arousal before the brunette shook himself and blushed.
“Fine, Jesus when you said you were moving back I was actually excited…” Bucky said in fake disappointment, laughing when Steve just shoved him playfully. “Just let me text Sam, he’ll probably want to mooch a ride too.”
hear her right? She drove drunk?” he asked. The teen groaned in his embrace before burying her face back into his neck, shoulders hunched in shame.
“There’s uh...there’s another one,” Steve said quietly, turning his gaze to the ceiling as he handed another sheet of paper to the genius. The first drawing was gently put to the side as he used the second one to cover his now growing erection.
He saw her eyes water a little at that, mouth open once or twice trying to find her own words in response.
“What?” Steve asked, looking at the pup with a smile.
though!?” he asked not caring how whiny he sounded, hating that on top of everything else going on in his life, his little brother had stolen and copied his superhero identity.
They had prepared the kids on the plane ride over by telling them about meeting him, and the results weren't surprising. Peter was excited about seeing his Uncle Bucky, Emerson was weary of meeting her father's ex, whiles Miles was excited to meet any friend of his family's. The kid pointed out that he loved Aunt Pepper who used to date his Dad, so he was sure he'd like Mr. Bucky. Kid's logic never ceased to amaze Steve.
He looked down, prepared to deliver his wrath when he noticed whose hand it was.
“I met your ex today,” he answered quietly. He looked up and couldn’t help smiling as Tony’s face scrunched up in embarrassment.
“So what do you think, Petey? Should we make Daddy cookies or brownies?” Peter looked like he was thinking it over before jumping up and down excitedly.
"Peter!" he heard his Dad croak out upon realizing his son's presence, causing the other zombies to raise from their blanket grave. They offered mumbled greetings before their Dad started coughing up a lung.
“It’s only the nuthouse when you show your ugly mug around here,” Becca sneered at their brother, dodging the pillow Buck threw at her.
Bucky was starting to wonder if he could do anything right.
,” he said confidently.
“I’m-”
“Tony’s been pretty good about behaving himself…”
“You were with Carlton?” she guessed quietly. He startled at that, looking at her incredulously as she hit the nail on the head.
"I can walk," she said with a small slur as Steve tried to help her off the table. He ended up picking her up anyway, as his stubborn child almost fell flat on her face.
“Tony, we were Captain America and Iron Man for over forty years. When we met and formed the Avengers, we were the only super heroes out there. But we’re not alone anymore. The world has the Guardians, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, not to mention the new Avengers team. They don’t need us anymore. And as much as I loved fighting for what was right...it killed me to be away from my family. Away from you. I retired because I wanted to spend more time with you. And our kids and grandkids. Plus, don’t you remember the last time I got injured? The serum took longer to heal. We’re not young men anymore…”
And now some sort of sharpness slid over the mask, and there was an almost dangerous look about him as he said, one eyebrow raised, "Yeah? Well, no offense, but you kind of haven't been around me the last several years, so you're not exactly the best person to ask about it."
He waved his hand in the air. "Got it, J. I remember. Stuff for SI."
"Something I should be worried about?"
"A little?" Steve said, somewhat amused.
"Doesn't have to have been…
. He didn't want to completely give it up. Really, when it came down to it, he wanted to have it both ways. Have his cake and eat it, too.
future. But it was so hard to reconcile the, well,
And then, Bruce had sighed a little, and he'd pulled his glasses off and rubbed his eyes with his thumb and forefinger before looking straight at Steve and saying, "
How many sexual partners have you had in your lifetime?
"Maria!"
like this the rest of his life.
He sat up and put his hands out in front of him, turning them over and almost laughing in relief as he spotted the years' worth of nicks and cuts and burns in them. He reached up and felt his chest, flat and muscled and not in any way tender — not in the way he'd grown accustomed to over the last nine months, anyway. He pulled at the collar of his shirt and spotted the scars from the various reactor surgeries, and he laughed again and didn't think he was ever so glad to see so many glaring imperfections on his body.
He blew out a breath and thought about how best to explain it. "It's a tough kind of life," he finally settled on. "A lot easier to just find yourself a dame and settle down with her."
"Steve, trust me, Livvy and I are your family. We're your only
She nodded vigorously.
JARVIS switched the station to one airing what looked to be a war epic, and Tony realized what it was at the exact second that Steve did.
Tony glared at him.
He went over to the adjacent bathroom and did his business, and it was as he was washing up that he caught sight of himself in the mirror ahead of him. He stared at the woman that stared back at him, at her long, thick hair and the soft curves of her face then shifted his gaze down to the rather prominent bulge of swollen breasts that ached and an abdomen that had gotten so big it had begun to push out his belly button. Not taking his eyes off his belly, he shut the water off in the sink then put his damp hands to the swell, rubbing it gently, feeling the movement going on within, the diamonds and sapphires on his left hand glinting in the light. He swallowed, feeling a jab against the side of his abdomen, and he pushed a finger back against it.
Barnes still seemed a bit unsure, but as Tony carefully cradled Olivia so as to hand her over, Barnes cradled his arms, and satisfied that Barnes had enough control of the situation that he wouldn't accidentally drop her, he placed her in his covered metal arm, which allowed him to reach up and stroke her cheek with his flesh-and-blood fingertip.
Sam just looked at him pointedly. "Think about what you know about those two and how they communicate."
Tony stopped and turned, and Pepper murmured beside him, "Tony,
"What else am I going to do?" the Cap asked quietly, and Tony stopped what he was doing to look up at him. The Cap didn't meet his eyes, preferring to concentrate on his task of ripping the napkin, and Tony set the tablet down and remembered back to the Cap's quiet admission of not being able to sleep when he'd 'accidentally' dialed him. He wondered how in the world SHIELD had ever cleared the guy for active duty.
"You did it to me again, didn't you?" he said and looked up at the spacey crackpot.
Tony sat back up and moved closer to Barnes to finish up the repairs, DUM-E moving back into place with the magnifying glass. "Yeah? He sure gives a shitty impression of it from time-to-time."
"We have reason to believe there are several Hydra factions in operation at-current, all of them planning for something within the next few weeks or months," Natasha explained, and Tony only realized then that she had a 'serious business' voice the same way that Steve did.
Steve scratched at the back of his head. "They, ah— Any of them around? I mean, any chance we might bump into any of them?"
A picture you take with your phone. As if he could have ever imagined something like that was even possible!
The bacon was making him sick, and even the coffee was…unpleasant. He threw the covers back and ran into the bathroom and threw up again, but given that he hadn't eaten anything since the last time he'd thrown up, there was nothing to come up except for bile.
"It does not say that!"
Outside of being in the Iron Man suit and a horrendous evening at a club that I'm half-tempted to buy and bulldoze, I haven't been outside of this joint in
They both turned their gazes down to what looked to be a baby name book, and from the slightly worn condition, it wasn't something Barton had just picked up at the airport.
Thor darted his gaze to Tony a moment then turned back to Steve. "I am afraid the Man of Iron shall be…in that form for longer than intended."
"I haven't had a
It was the first time he'd said her name, and judging by the surprised looks from Bruce and Rhodey, this knowledge didn't go over their heads, either. He ignored them and kept attention on the kid, who huffed and started naming names as she poked at the remnants of her slices of pizza.
But Steve took a breath, and the Snickers bar going soft in his warm hand, even through the wrapper, he stepped closer to Tony and shook his head ever-so-slightly.
Tony's lips thinned. "Yeah."
in a monogamous relationship. The only reason we'd use it is to keep down the mess and…if you must know, sometimes that comes into play, no pun intended."
"Really? That's not too, uh,
The matter was dropped after that, and Tony tried to relax a little in his seat until he realized—
"Yes, I swallowed, you sick son-of-a-bitch!" He made a couple of disgusted — and over-the-top — gagging sounds and said, "The fuck did you do that for?"
He'd intended it solely as a petulant joke on his part, but Barnes's face clouded over a little at that, his gaze breaking and darting to another part of the room, and Natasha pulled away from Tony and pushed into Barnes's space and said, "Let's go get something to eat before Thor and Steve eat most of it."
Steve went back to reading over the tablet. "It's amazing. It was… I guess it was considered a 'woman thing.' Fathers weren't expected to know about this. They weren't expected to be a part of it. A father's responsibility was relegated to getting his wife to the hospital and passing out cigars in the waiting room. Now, I mean—" He swiped his finger over the tablet to scroll down the webpage. "They're right alongside the whole time now." He stopped swiping and frowned, a small crease forming between his brows.
But Tony just shook his head, and he grabbed hold of Steve's hand before he could tumble off the bed in horror and pulled him back, and as Steve blathered on about how sorry he was and how he should have asked and he should have made sure, Tony reached up and met his lips, kissing him, putting his arms around his neck to hold him close. God, he loved him. He loved this man so much. He didn't know what he'd done in a past life to deserve such a man, but he'd do it all over again just so that he could have him, so that he could have
"You know she can't really see that far in front of her, right?" Rhodey asked, but Barton shrugged again.
Tony grinned in return, unable to help himself, and he didn't fight it this time when Steve leaned in to kiss him again, this time much less chaste than the last.
"Yes, god forbid we don't answer Steve immediately."
"So…you made them think like everything was A-OK with you and nothing was wrong—"
"It's my arc reactor."
"That, I will agree with," Rhodey said, glancing up from the baby to look amongst the group and nod his approval.
Tony just stroked his hair and said, "Well, when I invent time travel—"
He took another breath. In. Out.
"Why?"
Steve thought he heard Tony grumble something about 'living with Oscar fucking Madison,' but he ignored it and instead helped himself to more cookies.
"I'm really robbing the cradle, you know."
He must have been blushing because he felt heat flood his face, and he willed himself to get his emotions under control as he said, "Yeah."
"Do you
Steve made a face, and he gave a slight hand motion as though to demonstrate as he said, "The, ah, the
Steve — giving him that soft, intimate look that that other Steve had offered him, the one that made him feel like he was the most important thing in the world to that Steve. God help him, there were moments where he thought maybe this Steve was thinking about laying one smack on him like that other Steve had.
"Yeah, yeah," Bucky said before Sam added, "Say 'hi' to your boyfriend for us." Steve, mature fellow that he was, flipped them off.
He had no idea who 'Nat' was, but he thought he was a pretty good liar when the occasion called for it. Erskine was the only one that had caught onto his multiple enlistment tries; none of the other dopes at the draft board had ever figured it out.
"Yeah, that's not happening," Barnes said, and Tony frowned up at him through squinty, tired eyes.
"Wait, did you
Which did not go unnoticed by Steve.
OK, no, not the time to freak out. He kept his eyes open so that he could use his surroundings to ground him, and he took several short, panicked breaths as he tried to get control of himself. He couldn't close his eyes. If he did, he'd see it, and he couldn't— he didn't—
"Yeah, well," Tony said with a blasé shrug, but didn't qualify the words after that, and so Steve steered the conversation in another direction.
"Would you want to be seventy and chasing after her?" Bruce asked and nodded his head at Olivia, who was busy pulling the cheese off her slice and eating it with her fingers.
"Gripe all you want," Barton, who also had his phone out, said. "You know deep down you're loving this."
Tony hesitated, and Steve seemed a little surprised as he asked, "Could you do that? I mean, you can tell that just from this?"
"Ugh," he said and looked around the barren floor. "J? There a supply closet or anything anywhere around here? Someplace we can get some zip ties?"
Soon, the open spaces of the outskirts gave way to the congestion of a downtown, lights and traffic and decorations as far as he could see. Tony swung the car around a few blocks then pulled into a parking space at an angle, the curb and a parking meter directly ahead of it. He whistled a bit as he shut the car off and popped his door open, and Steve followed suit — almost strangling himself with that seat belt-thing in the process — and watched as Tony ducked into the backseat to grab the baby and then something he'd previously called a 'diaper bag.'
"Honey, you know if I could, I would."
" He snorted a bitter laugh. "Don't worry. I'll make it easy for you." He turned on his heel and marched back to the car, gravel crunching under his sneakers.
"You're saying I'm the one that would be on my knees for him?"
"I don't usually go by 'Steven.'"
"If that was the case, he had several opportunities to do that during the afternoon."
So, he got in the scalding hot shower, asking JARVIS to put the temperature as high as it could possibly go without burning him, and stood under the spray and soaped himself up, almost as though trying to wash the events of the past forty-eight hours off his body — trying to wash this thing from his body. He rubbed the cloth over his chest and shoulders and neck and back and then his abdomen, his hand coming to a dead stop over his lower abdomen where he knew… He flexed his fingers, the water cascading down his body and the soap suds swirling around the drain, and he wished… He wished more than anything he could reach in and rip the offending organ out. Like
"You want toast?"
"Way to be a responsible parent there, Tones," Rhodey muttered, and Tony shot him a glare before he turned his attention back to the kid.
about how much you hate the Dodgers. I'm sure you both can agree on that."
"I'm knocked up?"
He watched as they stood there considering each other for a moment — not like they were sizing each other up but more that they were trying to assure themselves this was real and this was really happening — before Steve seemingly felt brazen enough to reach out and pull Barnes into an embrace. Barnes stood frozen for only a second before he was reaching up with tentative arms to return the embrace in kind, though Tony saw the haunted look on Barnes's face as he rested his chin on Steve's shoulder and hugged him for the first time in damned near seventy years.
— and you'd just plunge right into me, hard and fast like you're trying to teach me a lesson, like you're trying to fuck me into submission.
Oh, fuck it, he decided as he grabbed a fresh pair of pajamas and dropped them on the bed. He was old, he was married, and he was
"No, no, it's a request."
Tony shook his head. "God, that would be equal parts awful and unbearable. But, it doesn't matter. We figured it out, we worked it out, and I think we're doing OK." He glanced down at himself then met Steve's gaze again. "Forced sex changes aside."
"That, too, kiddo," Tony said, and Steve reached out and gently moved her feet so that her legs were hanging from her seat. "Thanks," Tony told him, but Steve just shrugged and mumbled that it was nothing then asked, "Can she have Chinese food?"
"Yeah."
He shrugged. "Depends on what you're offering."
"It's a crazy life we've gotten ourselves into," Tony said with a grin, "but fuck it, if it isn't worth it."
They remained as they were, Steve lying and Tony half-sitting up, their eyes doing a dance as Tony seemingly contemplated his next movements. Steve didn't want to beg — didn't want to make Tony feel like he was being forced into a decision — but he stared up at Tony and hoped to God that he was conveying to Tony all the love and trust that he knew Tony was searching for.
"That's even before my time," Steve said with an amused smirk. "And don't exaggerate. Besides, I'm from Brooklyn."
He stopped and turned back toward Tony. "Yeah," he said, but Tony couldn't tell what sort of tone or sentiment was behind it. It wasn't as closely-cropped as Steve's was, but it was short and neat, and Tony couldn't help but wonder if it was a superficial change for him or if it meant something a little deeper than that.
For the first time in, well, months, Tony was feeling good. No, not good,
pointed look on him.
They both finished their business, toilets flushing and doors slamming open, and they continued their chatter over by the sinks but they had moved onto some other subject that was more personal and so Tony tuned it out and waited for them to leave before he departed the stall and washed up.
"What?"
"You left out the part where you used to be a man," she said but didn't move her hands just yet.
He carried the baby upstairs and into her room, and he sighed out a groan and said, "OK, kiddo, I don't like this any more than you do."
"Yes, of course," Thor said easily. "It is unfortunate that the average life on Midgard is so short. Asgardians, as you know, live for thousands of years. Your lives on Midgard exist in but the blink of an eye for us, as you will eventually come to find out."
"Well, to be fair, Captain America isn't the one the media has the problem with. Mostly."
supposed to fill this out."
He readjusted his arms, tucking his hands into his armpits and said, "You're going to feed our daughter artificial breast milk?"
up because even Hill showed up that afternoon and with a punchbowl and the ingredients for a brew of some kind. Hill ventured into the penthouse every so often, but it was for business only and never for pleasure.
"Which I know sounds crass and insensitive especially in light of certain—" he coughed and shot a glance at the couple that had been through more fertility treatments than Thor had boxes of Pop-Tarts or Barton had bad jokes in the last two years, "—uh, histories present, but I mean, it's not like this was something I ever thought
So, he went upstairs to get showered, luxuriating in the warm spray of water that cascaded down his neck and shoulders. He looked over his belly and watched the soapy water swirl beneath his feet before it disappeared down the drain, and he hummed and sighed a little, hugging his arms around himself.
But Steve just shrugged, and the woman continued, "— are sitting at my desk and trying to convince me that this 'mystery woman' is Tony Stark?"
"While I no doubt our friend with the eye of the hawk would be a fine and capable leader," Thor began before he nodded toward Steve, "my loyalty is now and always shall be toward our Captain. And his beloved bonded."
Steve tensed beside him, and Tony grasped hold of his arm and said, "Steve,
Tony scowled. "Could we not use that phraseology? I'm going to get hives just thinking about it."
"For?"
Tony faltered, but Bruce came closer and said, "Hey, Olivia, why don't you let your Aunt Pepper go, huh? You're going to get her nice chinos all wrinkled."
Tony scoffed. "Please," he muttered. "Thor looks like fucking Alfalfa compared to Steve."
"That is the poorest excuse for being a dumbass I have ever heard," Tony muttered but left it at that.
But then, it wasn't
as he stood there and took his shower — then said, "That doesn't really happen, right?"
He groaned again and steeled himself to sit up, turning onto his side and bracing his hands against the cushion beneath him to push himself up.
Steve laughed. "And you wouldn't support her if she decided she wanted to go into music. She could be the next, uh..."
"Oh, that had to have been a publicity thing! I don't think they were really dating. It was probably made up for the press."
"That…sounds horrible," the same woman said, visibly shivering as she seemingly pondered the mere thought of it.
"It sounds like VD," he replied.
Steve frowned. "There was no Maddie in that—"
You were— In that building. Everyone saw— How did you...?"
Tony put a hand to his belly. "You're going to make me walk down to SoHo in
Again, nothing he couldn't do in this body that he could do in his male body.
"How would Barton even know?" he snapped and shook his head. "Jesus Christ," he muttered. "This can't be happening to me. You must be reading it wrong."
"Blows over?" he asked without yet having taken a bite of his salad. "Why? How bad is it?"
Natasha, however, hadn't moved her gaze from where she stood there and stared at Bruce, the stare being more 'glare' than anything, and Bruce seemed to realize this, wincing some as he looked between them and said to Natasha, "Don't tell me he didn't know."
"Until now," Natasha said.
But there was a free period of time for it that afternoon. They would just have to go over to her office to use it.
tells Steve about this."
Steve's face went a little hard at that, a little firm, like he had slipped into overprotective mode again. "I'll have a talk with the others—" he started to say, but Tony shook his head.
" yelled at him by Sam and Bucky.
Bruce rolled his eyes and said, "And you were knocked out for twenty minutes. Ideally, I'd want to wait at least forty-eight hours for that to clear your system."
"So?"
That might have been just a bridge too far.
"Yeah, that sounds like fun," he muttered, but Steve just put a hand to his lower back and steered him down the hall in the direction the doctor had gone.
He sank down onto a chair and tipped his head back. "Yeah," he said with a slight groan then shushed his friend. "Don't need her waking up again."
Steve just stared at the bit of gold in the middle of his hand, and he sat away from the baby and set the bottle down on the table. "I'd wondered what had happened to that," he murmured and reached out to take the ring from Tony's hand.
"No," Natasha said, "you brood manfully."
Not that Thor seemed to notice this venom. If he did, he did a damned good job of hiding whatever he thought of it, as he just smiled at Steve, plainly, like what he was about to say was the simplest thing in the world.
I just… When this is— I mean when
said was, "No," and he only knew this because Tony startled like he'd just been slapped in the face and said, "Oh, well, uh, I know my method is kind of lacking, but I thought I did pretty well giving you a few basic—"
It was a work in progress.
that son-of-a-bitch still following him, and fuck, what he wouldn't give to be able to pull a repulsor on the guy. Just one, and not one he would fire, but just one that might give this guy — or any other bastard that was looking to corner him on the way to and from the bathroom — the hint to back off.
," in the way that Tony knew Steve had figured out exactly what Tony's problem was, but he still let Tony leave, and he gladly did so, going over to the bedroom and closing the door behind him. The room was relatively dark by this point in the evening, and he didn't bother to turn a light on, instead choosing to just flop down onto the bed and curl up on his side, pillow shoved between his legs again. Maybe he was being stupid or immature, but he didn't care. Steve, clearly, was more interested in spending time with his little pal from the bad old days, and Tony could give him that without sitting there pathetically and demanding the attention he thought he deserved from his husband during what was supposed to be a weekend getaway. Sort of. OK, it was more about riding out the shitstorm that he himself had caused, but whatever.
you can pronounce your 'L's."
He sat there staring at the ceiling a moment, trying to process what JARVIS had just told him before he said, "Has anyone, I don't know, tried to talk to Steve about this?"
"Sass-bot."
"I know, but you did, and if he's seriously giving you a second chance—"
"Very cute," Steve said, gazing outside at the rain-dampened skyline and what he knew to be
Steve started to say until he was shouted at by both Natasha and Wilson to, "
Steve just folded his arms, tucking his hands into his armpits, but he didn't fight Bruce's assertion in the least.
"You hear my words, but you do not listen. You are bondmates. You possess perhaps the strongest bond I have ever felt. Your lives — your souls — have been intertwined since time immemorial. You think you have a duty to people that you feel made you. No one made you, Captain. They did with potions and machines what I can do with a touch of the finger. They changed your form, but they did not change you, and whatever debt you feel is owed to them for that has long since been repaid. Do not continue to fight if your heart is not in it. You joined a fight because you believed in the cause, and perhaps you have now found a new cause, but do not dedicate your life to it just because you feel that you should to repay some debt that no one has any right to collect on. Tell me, Captain, what makes you happy? What makes you well and truly happy? When are you at your happiest?"
"Really? Because that's what it fucking sounds like, Steve."
But it was fucking terrifying, and the only thing that made it not as terrifying as it could be was the fact that it was Steve's. He loved Steve, he'd loved him for a long time, but he'd never, ever once thought about what it would be like to carry his child. Ever. OK, sure, he'd thought about what it would be like to combine their DNA, and he'd even, in the privacy of his own mind, toyed with the idea of it in a lab setting, but even then he knew he'd need a donor egg and a surrogate in order to pull it off,
Steve only now saw that Tony wore what looked like a pair of blue ones with…Steve's shield on them? Was he seeing that right? They looked worn, as though they'd been washed several times over, as did the pair Steve held in his hands. He eyed them carefully, wondering if there was something— Was this some sort of signal? But Tony was going on about the joke was on someone named Barton because his gag gift was the 'awesomest' thing he could have done for them and '
He was quiet a moment, staring down at the fidgety newborn in his arm, his other hand still firm at Tony's back, until he said, "I know you actually went with 'Olivia,' but she's not—?"
"On the list of stupid things you've done in your life, that probably tops the charts—"
"Yeah."
"Oh, yeah," Steve said as he looked over Tony's shoulder to read the headline. "They cornered me when I was out for my run. Figured it wasn't any of their business."
"I guess that makes you the Adonis to my Aphrodite."
"Yes, pwease."
"Then what are we supposed to do?" Tony asked, and Thor's head dropped to his chest as though in defeat.
"Yeah, it's where you release bad news late on Friday afternoon, and it gets buried over the weekend. People forget about it and move onto the next thing by Monday. Are there people downstairs?"
Tony heaved out a breath but didn't move his hand from Steve's thigh. "Yeah, and twenty-five of those years were spent in a glacier."
"Now, where have I heard that before?" Bruce mused with a small smile.
Tony frowned and looked up at Steve, cracker halfway to his mouth. "What's he talking about?" he asked then turned to Rhodey. "Cinnamon bun, what are you talking about?"
"Yeah, thanks, Stark," Barton said and shared a look with Romanoff. "I think we'll be able to contain ourselves. And hey, Doc, you still didn't answer Nat's question."
Wilson stared at him a moment, Barnes staring back at him like he actually expect an honest answer to his question, before he turned to Steve and said, "Seriously, I will defect."
Tony laughed a little. "He sort of stopped what he was doing, looked at me like he wasn't quite sure whether to believe me or not, glanced down at my crotch like he was trying to see if he could see it, so I said, 'It's called 'tucking,'' then asked him if he wanted to be in the middle. I think his brain short-circuited after that because he kind of just stood there before he stuttered out some bullshit excuse about how he had an early day tomorrow and he had some big-ass project to do, and he ran away after that."
“Naw man, he’s the auntie,” another of them piped in, causing an eruption of laughter among the teens.
He gripped the wheel as he sat in the parking lot he’d pulled off to, waiting for his reply.
It’s not that he forgot, it’s just the meeting ran a little late so he wasn’t home until twelve fifteen. Which, in Tony’s book, is still a decent time.
“That’s…”
Tony watched as the two began to stalk away, grinning when he heard Sarah shout the icing on the cake.
for you then-”
"Oh yeah?" Steve asked, suddenly nervous at the prospect of meeting him. His other half sensed that, grabbing his hand and leading the two back to his car.
*there's a joke about Steve lying about being gay and secretly liking vaginas. That is in no way meant to disrespect transmen, and I apologize if it comes across that way. I just think vagina is a funnier word than ladies.
Didn’t stop her from groaning in complaint though, smiling when he gently pulled the covers back and smiled down at her. She squinted a little at him, giving her eyes a second to adjust to the light as he gently brushed some of the hair from her face.
"No...but I like the historical approach...What about, Maximus? Max for short?" she said as she saw his eyes light up.
“Oh…do you know when he’s coming home?”
As they were eating, something magical happened.
“Huh, well I have one of my own,” Steve said before grabbing the pup under his arms and lifting him up before gently placing him on his back. He pinned him down...before mercilessly tickling the six year old. “Start counting ref!”
“What does that mean, J? They’re safe right? What’s Petey doing here anyhow?” Tony asked as panic began to set in. Before the AI could respond, the elevator doors open on their floor and they were greeted by a sight that nearly made the billionaire fall dead then and there.
Case in point - when he picked his son back up from Ty’s later, Harley was somehow both hyper and cranky after only being with the Alpha for a few hours.
Clint.
“Bad Daddy,” Joey muttered, getting another laugh from Steve and their Ma.
This unfortunately did not help her panic attack and she cried loudly – scared and not in control of her own body.
“Yeah of course,” Steve said, switching chairs to sit next to him and look. Tony quickly pulled his phone out and clicked on his boy’s photo album, hundreds of pictures of the chunky little mini-Tony and handing it over to Steve.
“Fine,” Peter said with a sigh as he went to grab one of his little critter books.
Fuck he was so cute.
"That's right Peter rabbit, I'm your bubba," Harley cooed, kissing the baby on his head before gently releasing him back to their Papa.
He settled the two more comfortably on the bed before placing the screen in front of them. He smiled when she shifted only slightly, settling in as he found one of their home movies. It was the one where she learned to walk – one of his personal favorites – as she let out a laugh before the two sat in comfortable silence.
Mrs. Jacobson and Ms. Lang approached the group quickly before the boy could really say anything in retaliation.
“Boyfriend, huh?” he whispered against the brunette’s lips, smiling when Tony nodded in response.
“Well,” Dr. Chase began, pausing to look at the kids playing a board game with their uncles, “I wouldn’t advise too much outside stimuli…if you would like to see him alone I think it should be fine. We’ll bring your kids in when Mr. Stark is feeling well enough. I’d be happy to escort you back to his room.”
“Fine! OKAY! Papa PLEASE!” he laughed out. Both grateful as Steve gently put him down, who then moved to tussle the teen’s hair.
“Yeah well, can you blame me? I almost lost my brother…” He felt James gently pinch his chin before bringing his face up to his, soft smile on his handsome face.
“Not to…” Peter admitted, Tony easily imagining his son adding a pout to it.
Her first seizure happened in her sleep when she was only ten years old. She didn’t know what it was, just that she woke up exhausted and on the floor next to her bed. The second time she had a seizure, it was on the couch while her Dad was in the bathroom. They were having a Lord of the Rings marathon. He told her when he came back and saw her shaking on the floor, he ‘damn near pissed himself’ after just using the restroom.
Pretty foolproof plan, if he did say so himself.
“-OKAY okay I get it. I...actually think I have someone in mind.”
He had a son. Two now.
“Morning baby,” her Dad replied as he had to stand on his tiptoes to kiss the kid on the cheek.
“I want my Daddy,” the pup cried before going into a coughing fit. Steve was unable to hold back this time, reaching over and rubbing the boy’s shoulders in comfort.
She watched with a quirked brow as Steve drew lines along the paper, some solid and some dotted, before carefully writing a word she assumed was her name.
“What happened to her when she was 12?” she asked, familiar with this tale of her mother. The woman smiled at her before rolling her eyes fondly.
“Yeah.”
Tony watched as the handsome devil, dressed in black slacks and a white button up, walked across the gym towards him. Anxiety suddenly dropped in his stomach at the thought this was all some long hoax - when the blonde was suddenly in front of him. Smiling at him with an adorable blush.
isn’t you,” Tony grumbled, still sporting a smile as he grabbed the magazine out of Steve’s hands. “You do look good with a mustache,” he added, wiggling his brows.
“Wow, thank you both for coming to my place of work to gawk at my employee,” the blonde said with an eye roll as he began to make his own plate. “If you’ll both excuse me,” he said with a mock-glare before taking his plate back to his office.
"I don't know how you do it man," his friend said in amusement, looking back at his family. Steve looked over at him before he continued.
“Disney world? When are we going?” she asked with a brow raised.
He was smiling at her as her thoughts drifted, waiting for her to return the smile before exiting his car.
“Everyone’s alive, I assure you, they just got…injured,” he said as he weaved in and out of traffic. “And by them I mean Tony and Peter – yes Peter – who apparently skipped his final brainiac competition to quote unquote help. He got hurt saving your dad, who is currently in a medically induced coma from being crushed under a building. I’m taking you to the hospital where Steve is waiting for you,” he finished with an unsure cough.
The conversation was interrupted when the pair heard tiny footsteps join them. Steve looked up at his sleepy youngest, rubbing one eye while carrying Spiderman in the other - sporting an Iron Man suit-like pair of pajamas. He looked over to Emerson who gave the father an exasperated look, which he simply shrugged his shoulders in response.
“Okay,” Peter offered, taking the toy with him out of the room.
“I don’t want you to do any of those things, Steve.” Tony said, suddenly more serious. “I don’t want you to give anything up for me, I just want you. Just, you.” Steve stopped him from rambling with another deep kiss, wrapping his arms around his husband’s waist and lifting him up off the chair. The genius squawked in response before laughing at the man he’d chosen to spend his life with.
“I don’t know, maybe it’s just a weird gut feeling I’m having,” he began turning back to the dishes before his husband interrupted him.
“Should be home tomorrow, little cretin refused to have his daddy pick him up from the trip. Like I’m embarrassing or something, can you believe that?”
“I am not that bad!” Steve said, crossing his arms in defense.
“No, no sorry – Carolyn’s here. Not psychopath, I would’ve knocked him out myself,” Sam said pointedly.
.” She was shaking with rage, wanting nothing more than to inflict as much violence as possible on this imposter. But she knew her Pops wouldn’t let that happen, instead deciding to grab his hand and power walk to his car.
“How about you climb up on the stool and help me with the green beans?” Steve asked, pulling a bowl out to hand to the boy. Harley complied, silently watching Steve break off some ends before mimicking his actions. The silence only lasted another moment.
“Oh my grandson, have I got some stories to share with you,” Howard said, standing up and grabbing the pup’s arm. “Come along to my study, I have a few photo albums to show you.”
As selfish as he was, he had become increasingly selfless since marrying captain handsome and adopting his questionably not biological son – not to mention the six months he has been blessed and cursed with the most recent member of his family – he smiled as he thought to the person in question who abandoned him tonight.
“You really don’t mind that I want to call Clint, Daddy, right?”
“New couch is a necessity when your
Currently, he was watching Spongebob while laying out on his couch – his brain working overdrive to think of a solution to this. That ‘doesn’t involve killing him’ …
“No I...I feel it too. This just feels, weirdly right,” Tony said quietly, his turn to blush as he felt the gentle hands of the blonde turn his face towards him.
Tony let out a snort of laughter, knowing Ruth better than the two. Steve smiled fondly at the man’s reaction and his kid’s sudden glare.
“Like you said, Obie. I’m a smart guy. Which means I did my research. I know your company is tanking in the stocks and I don’t need that kind of energy at my new company. Nor would I want you to betray me down the road and steal half of my staff,” Tony said as Steve joined him in standing while the blessed waiter came back with their bagged food. “You two enjoy your lunch.”
The meeting about the accords, did not go well, to say the very fucking least. His husband not only disagreed with him, loudly, but made it a point to remind Tony his ex and the planet would always come before Tony, before their kids. It infuriated the genius to no end. So it shouldn’t have surprised anyone when Tony took his private plane home early – alone – leaving Steve to fend for his damn self.
After too many medical tests to count, the doctor told her and her dad she had epilepsy. A disorder with no known cure that made her helpless in her own body; something that she would literally be stuck with for her
“Who are you?” the boy asked as he wiggled out of his uncle’s embrace to confront the teen.
Tony sat back. "
"What man?"
The other three groaned, and Natasha looked at him pointedly and said, "You're not
Barnes, he could only assume, was fine being there so long as someone else was there but was uncomfortable with being left alone with his best pal's laboring other half. Oh, not that it was anything personal. He just didn't think Barnes would have been comfortable being left alone with
“After your Dad died, I thought about how little family you had. You just had me. And if something happened to me? ...I got scared and I emailed her, asking her if she’d like to be a part of your life. And that
“Peanut butter blossoms, your favorite,” he said, feeling his cheeks blush.
Which of course was the perfect time for May to call him. He pulls his phone out, frowning before answering it.
So part of it was Clint was sensitive about that, good note.
Also Umma is Korean for Momma, according to Google.
“-Please Mrs. Rhodes, I know Howard is a powerful man but there must be someone we can call?” he pleaded, not wanting to get into the middle of this explosive conversation, but not wanting to witness it either. There was a pregnant pause as the mother and son shared a look before the woman took a deep breath.
“What are you talking about? She was here this morning, right when I woke up.” Peter stayed hidden, not responding to him.
“Daddy come on Jarvis made his yummy sandwiches!” his pup yelled, followed by the sounds of his Mama quietly hushing him.
“Night padres,” she called back without turning around on her journey.
“I thought you’d never ask!” immediately laughing after, giving Steve an excellent reason to shove his shoulder in reprimand and jest. Sam got off the couch first, offering Steve a hand as the blonde gratefully accepted.
“Of course, baby,” Tony said after giving him a quick kiss on the cheek and tightening his arms around him in a hug. They walked back over to Steve to say goodnight.
“Jo…” he started sadly.
“I love you too, Emerson.”
“Excuse me?” Nat asked quietly as Steve got up off the couch to stand next to Stark.
“Cause he wants another kid?” his Pop asked gently, ignoring the offended scoff from his husband and his muttered “
“I heard you had an evaluation today, how did you fair?” Thor asked as he sat down on the couch next to Peter.
His abilities will help him heal, but that didn’t mean it would make it hurt any less. He thrashed as he felt hands try to life his mask up. It was only because of his super-hearing that he picked up the sounds of things whizzing by, suddenly aware the foot was lifting before he heard several thuds. He rubbed his neck as he gasped a few breaths in and out, seeing arrows sticking out of the remaining men – all incapacitated.
“Excuse you?! You gave Barnes a handjob at the movie theater! And you didn’t even wait until the lights got dark!”
“I don’t want to meet her,” she said a little more clearly, eyes downcast.
"So Tati, does this mean you two are...together?" his daughter asked, hope in her eyes and voice as she looked back and forth between him and Clint. The archer had downed the entire coffee before putting his empty cup on the bedside table, freeing up his hand. Which Bucky took with his metal one before turning to his kid and nodding. "Yay!" Daci cheered in excitement, getting a laugh out of the adults as Bucky felt the grip on his hand tighten.
a question now?” She looked up at him then, frowning when she saw the angry look on his face. She could see Tony throwing a glare in his direction but didn’t respond, just kept staring at Steve to gage his reaction.
“Yes,” he replied to his husband, who was standing two feet away and looking at the opened bedroom door. The brunette shot a quick glance at the blonde before turning his attention back to the door.
“You two are gross,” Clint spoke up next to them. It made Steve frown, only because it made the warmth of Tony leave as the brunette whirled around and sat up in offense.
“I went ahead and called Ms. Carter for you! You guys will be hearing from her soon, since you're in violations of her terms and all!” she called out, hand covering the mic part of the phone before bringing it back to her ear.
“Ah! Daddy I’m sorry…it won’t happen again!” she cried as her fingers dug into the comforter in front of her. He shifted her on his lap, and for a brief moment she thought it was over, until he lifted his leg up to get her sit spots.
friendly with each other.
“I don’t know, baby. That’s for your boyfriend to decide. But...I might have an idea to help,” she said as Bucky shot back up, looking at her desperately as she tapped her chin with her finger. “Let’s talk again after dinner,” she said mysteriously before standing up to leave. Bucky quickly stood up to stop her, grabbing her wrist gently.
Her eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets, before a giant grin spread across his face.
“…well I am now!” Tony said blinking in surprise, getting a laugh from the blonde. “No but seriously – depending on how good you are – I know plenty of spaces that could use some color. I would, of course, have to see your work before making any offers.”
“You two going to start making out or what?” he sneered, encouraged by the small group of fellow fuckboys behind him.
“How are you feeling son?” Howard asked as he walked around to the other side of the bed.
“We should probably go back inside befo-”
“I agree Peter, naps are gross,” Rhodey said with Peter on his hip – just to be obnoxious.
It’s why he’s been redrawing himself from social outings, like another one of Thor’s parties. This weekend was especially bad, lying to James about spending the weekend with Nat and not even telling his best friend about it. He knew she was out of town with her aunt, and also knew her well enough to know she’d cover for him if Bucky asked her.
"Sounds like she absolutely adores you, her, ah,
Steve."
"Oh, my god,
There was a slight hitch to his voice, and Tony took that opportunity to lean against the table some, holding his arms so that his breasts pressed closer together and gave even more of an impression of cleavage.
Tony hummed as he shoved a bite of pancake into his mouth and savored the syrupy goodness, an array of breakfast foods spread before him. Beside him Steve, shed of the white bathrobe he'd pulled on to answer to door and not horrify (or entice) the person that had come to deliver their room service, sat in all his gorgeous, naked, alabaster glory as he scrolled through various news feeds and social media alerts on his tablet, a concerned look on his face and a slice of bacon halfway to his mouth.
“Don’t look at me,” Tony said with his hands raised in surrender. “You’re the one who shares the same genes as her.” Steve rolled his eyes at his husband as Tony walked over to his two boys, planting a kiss on Peter’s cheek before moving to kiss Steve’s lips. The blonde wrapped an arm around the genius’ waist in response, the two kissing again until they heard their five year old complain adorably.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Green really isn’t your color, Barton,” Tony sneered back, a smile still on his face as he turned to look for Steve. It was of course at that time that a certain head cheerleader, still wearing her crown - which Tony realized Steve had taken off and left somewhere - sauntered her way to him.
“Hey…” she began eyeing the weapons area, “could you teach me how to shoot an arrow?” His eyes widened comically as a smile slowly appeared on her face. When she and her Tati trained together, he didn’t allow her to use any weapons. In fact, he kept it strictly to her powers and how to use them.
“Yes! Thank you Pop,” she said before sticking her tongue out at the other man. Who, of course, maturely returned the gesture.
Who took her side against Steve when he was being hard-headed.
He took a moment to smile at his family curled in bed. Emerson lay on her side with her back to her brother, looking up at her father with a small smile. He pulled the blanket back to join her, waiting for her to curl herself up around him before he settled to get comfortable. He placed a kiss to her forehead before tightening his hold on his girl, finally letting his brain shut down and sleep.
beat his ass,” she corrected, smiling at the thought.
On top of that, he was driving Harley to school and back and still working part time at his Pappy’s gym.
After she threw the majority in, she grabbed a unicorn tube and set it in the water before climbing in. The water felt warm and amazing, and she was enjoying watching Peter and Wade beat each other with pool noodles while the toddlers cheered them on. Dad was with Leo in the shallow end teaching him how to float, while Miles and their Pop did handstands.
“Come on Joey, don’t be stupid. She’s using you.”
“She thinks you don’t want her, Steve!” he confessed, evident by the gasp and silent “Tony” that came from the passenger seat.
“What are you most upset about, honeybun? The fact you have a living grandma you didn’t know about? Or that she wasn’t what you hoped she’d be?”
“As I’ve said,
“Really?” Leo asked quietly next to her.
“Alright monkeys, off Uncle Tony,” the genius grumbled when Pietro had joined the two, holding onto the baby as the toddlers screamed and ran off, while the other hand delicately held the coffee.
like what people had said about him. Tony Stark was kind and thoughtful and literally wanted to make the world a better place.
“HA! What was that, soldier? No no, you see she belongs to
“Have him check you out. Here, at SI where no one has to know.” Tony frowned at that, still not liking that plan.
“Or, you know, we
“You’re an easy target, Clint,” the girl replied without much sympathy, which got another laugh out of the super soldier. Clint gasped in fake offense as the elevator dinged again, revealing a sleepy looking Bruce.
“No shit Sherlock!” he shouted at them and slammed his hands on the table. He saw Pepper out of the corner of his eye raise a brow at him, but it didn’t stop him like it normally does.
“Alright boys, the food is getting cold. Come and eat,” Pops called from the kitchen, trying and failing to get the pup out of her mates arms. “Honey you haven’t put him down yet, why don’t I hold him while you eat?” Steve watched the two fondly, sitting down with his family and helping himself to some roast beef.
“Fine, we’ll go. Just know El Toro sends his regards, puta.” He spit that last word out, Peter recognizing the words were Spanish for “the bull” and “bitch.” He hadn’t noticed he had also stepped in between Emerson and the gang until he felt her hands squeezing the back of his shirt, angry and powerless as they walked away.
It was the ‘are you fucking kidding me?’ look.
“No no, I was thinking the three of us go out for the day. There’s museums, a nearby carnival, whatever fun we can do that’s 3 year old age appropriate.”
Steve and Tony both stood frozen, watching their teen in shock and amazement. When Stone simply laughed at her, she resorted to an impressive right hook to his crotch. The small crowd of people gaped as the man plummeted to the ground in pain.
“Why are you here alone, anyway?” Bucky asked, no filter even when he wasn’t drinking.
Maybe he was worried for nothing.
Forgot all about them when they eventually made their way home, where he scented his younger pup before cuddling up with his mate to feed them.
“Can you keep a secret?” he asked as she nodded quickly in response. “I bought a ring last week.”
STEVE
“What I was going to say, Emerson, is that…” he sighed, not really knowing what he was trying to say. That it was all going to be okay? That they will get their due justice? That she didn’t deserve any of this? She would immediately cut through that line of bullshit.
That made it okay, right?
This woman had always been crafty about getting him to talk. Once when he was twelve, he tried to blame a mess he made on Andy (which, like, foolproof right? Andy was a baby and couldn’t defend himself) except she literally convinced him to confess. Crafty witch.
“Maybe…” Steve said with another shrug, smiling like a dope at the shorter man’s chuckle. The beautiful Omega in front of him gave him the courage to do something he never imagined he’d do. “So...wanna come back to my place?”
“-woah, woah! I would never meddle in your marriage. Just observe from the outside and call you things like ‘dumbass’ and ‘man-child.’” Tony only glared at Rhodey as he heard the sounds of his family greeting each other, following his friend who led the way back to the living room.
That it wasn’t her fault.
,” Tony tried to say before stopping when Emerson suddenly burst out laughing.
And one of the thongs, was also the only purple pair in the group.
“He’s six,” Tony answered for him. “I was seventeen when I had him. He’s um, the reason I dropped out of school. The pathetic sperm donor fled to Europe when I told him and it’s been us two ever since.” Steve was looking at the cute pup who did indeed jump off the monkey bars but picked up on the tone of Tony’s voice. Turning back, he frowned at both the look and smell coming off the Omega - a combination of sadness and insecurity.
“Don’t believe anything that traitorous Charlie says,” he quipped back at his husband. Dr. Charlotte Chase had been a friend of the billionaire’s for over ten years, doing a good brunt of the non-profit part of one of his non-profits. “She can’t be trusted,” he joked. “Clearly there is some kind of conspiracy,” smiling at his family’s chuckle.
“Fuck you too!”
when she comes over for breakfast tomorrow, then. Tell her why there’s a new couch? Why the teenagers are so…distressed? I’m just not sure she’d like to hear that, you know, considering
They were still laughing at Sam’s expense when a nurse came from down the hall the surgery was taking place. They all stopped and turned to her. Emerson stood up and walked to the nice looking woman.
"Take lots of pics for me!" the man offered as he left their apartment.
“And so you’re an idiot, because while you’re screaming about your personal agenda…your very very insecure husband hears you saying you’re… not a team.” She looked up, her beautiful green eyes connecting with his. “That you will always choose him. Even if that’s not what you are saying or what you mean. He hears you constantly reminding him that Bucky was the first love of your life. And he is second to that. Tell me…are you still in love with him?”
“I’ll be Pocahontas!” Lillian suddenly spoke up, catching the group off guard as they all turned to look at her.
“Well for the record,” she heard her Dad say. “Captain America and Iron Man wouldn’t go down so easily against a pathetic, D grade, wannabe gangster, child-raping, fuck-face, shit-bag – okay?” She couldn’t stop the laughs rumbling from deep in her belly, nor the few more to follow when she heard Steve hitting Tony, eliciting an “ow!” from the genius billionaire.
"She's not a baby, she's a Momma." Steve chuckled as he used his free arm to wrap around Joey.
He brought his arms to wrap around Tony, pulling him somehow closer into his embrace as the brunette snuggled his head into his neck.
"Yes."
At the pet store, they ended up maybe going a little overboard. Cat tree, litter box, food, food bowls, treats, flea and tick meds, collar, leash and harness, a million toys and other scratching posts. Oh, and a cat bed that doubled as a cat tent.
” she hissed at him, trying to pry her arm away from his grip. “Are you serious??”
The music was loud and the place was crowded, but it didn’t deter Clint’s enthusiasm as he dragged the two to one of the living rooms.
"She's still my baby, just like your hers," he explained as he felt Jo chuckle in his embrace.
“See?” Peter said, sticking his tongue out at his dad for good measure. Tony, always the mature one, returned the favor as Rhodey laughed at the two.
“You’re both stubborn as hell, have incredibly short fuses, fiercely protective of those you love, never back down from a fight and always stand your ground…should I keep going?” he added with a smile. Steve glared at his husband, not wanting to give him the satisfaction of being spot on; which he obviously was.
“Amazing,” she said with a smile, squishing the bubbles between her fingers. She watched as her Tati took a scoop of bubbles and placed it on her head. With a giggle, she returned the favor which started the two putting bubbles on each other. He gave her a beard next, which delighted her to no end.
Those thoughts are interrupted when she heard a small knock at her door. She closed her eyes and took a big gulp, before welcoming him in.
“Friends! Now that the children have gone to bed, we must drink in celebration!” Thor bellowed out as he pulled a flask out of nowhere.
He was perfect except for the constant screaming. Tony didn’t sleep the first seven days of his son’s life. Too scared that something would happen to him and unable to sleep for the half-hour increments Harley decided to shut his eyes and stop screaming.
It took longer for Miles to regain consciousness this time. When he did, he noticed he wasn’t crushed to death. Glancing around showed that he had fallen clear of the majority of the debris, but was still kind of trapped underneath some metal.
“Come nap with me, Alpha,” his beautiful, intelligent and caring mate said, taking the Alpha’s hand and leading them to their bedroom. They woke several hours later when his Pop had dinner ready, their six year old greeting them enthusiastically.
The three sat in Dr. Carmichael’s office as she looked over the test results, Joey sitting in between the two men across from her.
Shuri ran at them and started beating the absolute shit out the men. Emerson didn't even process that her plan had worked and she was safe as she stared at the woman she was head over heels for. The princess made quick work of the men, unarming them and taking them out in a matter of seconds.
They were alone in Harry’s lab in his father’s mansion, both on either side of the glass containing the colorful spider.
Peter experienced a short moment of shock before he wrapped his arms tightly around the boy, resting his cheek on his mop of black hair. He gently shushed him, rocking the two and using one hand to rub the boy’s back. They stayed like that for a few minutes, Leo slowly calming down and breathing more evenly. When his crying eventually stopped, Peter expected some kind of scramble of embarrassment to occur or for his foster son to lash out in anger.
Having Tony as a creator apparently meant Jarvis could easily read bullshit and she would be lying if she didn’t admit she was glad for that.
She knew it wasn’t the same. She knew she wasn’t back there and no one would hold her head under. This was her Tati and a bubble bath that
The question hit Tony in the very gut currently carrying the bundle of cells that would become their child.
Another smile broke across his face, genuinely laughing at this little ridiculous child.
“So I bring my nieces and nephews presents and you pay me back with a sticky gremlin? I see how it is…” Rhodey teased as he handed Morgan back to Steve. “Don’t go asking me for favors anytime soon.”
going to be here? It’s his fucking mansion.” Steve reached over the couch to flick her ear.
“Calm down, Bambi. I was showing Leo here my white sixty four impala,” his Dad said nonchalantly as he walked towards the man and reached for the towels.
“Hey!” Clint cried indignantly around a mouthful of donut. Steve couldn’t help but sigh at the two, hating that he promised the archer he’d stay out of it. He watched as Buck waved his goodbyes before leaving for the elevator. “Your Tati is a bully, Daci.”
“Steve didn’t drop Rogers?”
It didn’t hurt anymore and was wrapped in a white bandage…but she was still upset she had not only had a seizure while she slept and was
“Jarvis!” Peter shouted, startling the teen girl next to him. “Where are they?”
“Seeb!” she cried out, trying to plop down in order to crawl over to him. Bucky grabbed her again and hoisted her upright, determined to get her to walk.
Clint whimpered out, unable to stop himself from shaking. “
The doctor he met before the surgery was talking to Rhodey as Peter and Emerson joined Sam and Bruce. He walked around the game of Candyland to join in to what the doctor was discussing. She stopped once she saw Steve and smiled at him before continuing.
“Tony, I swear to god I’m going to wash your mouth out with soap,” the soldier said while staring at the ceiling. Tony turned back to his husband.
,” over and over again. The sight broke the father’s heart more, aching with pain at his son’s loss. How his piercing cries hadn’t tapered, barely muffled by Tony’s shirt.
One who believed in Tony, who loved him mind, body and soul.
“Cause I did the one fucking thing I shouldn’t have done?” she cried out, pillow stained with her puddle of tears. He sighed, and she was curious because it almost sounded like he was regretful…but if he was…
"You're Mama was a smart woman, Miles," Tony said at a smiling boy who suddenly jumped into the genius' embrace.
“Hey” was all the blonde offered, suddenly nervous. Tony looked up at that, offering his own small, “hey.” “Did you sleep okay?” he asked, continuing to avoid any real conversation.
They eventually released, Tony stealing one more kiss before finally relenting – smiling as the man grinned back and watched him drive away…with a promise of tomorrow.
“You did it! Holy crap Daciana that was awesome!” the archer exclaimed, reaching his arms out before recoiling immediately.
Often the boy, much like his Daddy, would watch Steve’s face while he read; not needing anything else to help imagine the story in their minds.
,” Peter interrupted exasperatedly at the same time that Steve had smacked the back of Tony’s head.
“No problem Aunt Tasha,” she said with a grin, immediately taking off when Hulk gently placed her on the ground. It only took about ten minutes of chasing before Hulk collapsed next to her aunt on the ground.
wear a diaper.”
“What did you call her?” he snarled out.
“I can’t carry Barton and Morgan at the same time,” her Tati argued, even if she knew he was teasing.
"Who's in Wakanda?" Miles asked curiously.
He had good manners, after all. He wasn’t raised in a barn.
"Aw, what's the matter, tinkertoy? I thought all you wanted was my everlasting happiness?"
There. At least Steve thought he'd done the right thing. "Then again, I almost lost
Her fingers faltered only a moment before she was back to massaging in a gentle and soothing rhythm.
Steve rolled his eyes and snorted a derisive laugh. "Head-shrinkers," he muttered.
She hummed again and said, "You are not mortal in the way you once were. You grow older, but you do not age. You wound, but you do not scar. You have not changed one bit from the moment of your transformation — aside from your hairstyle and your apparel choices, at least."
"What about you going out on national television and just saying, 'Hi, my name's Captain America, and I'm the lucky bastard that knocked up Iron Man.'"
" he cried, tears all but streaming down his face as he tried to shake Steve off his foot. "
"No," he said with a sigh. "It wasn't you. You were dead."
The only light being the moon high above, Tony watched as Steve grinned at him and said, "Yeah, some asshole took down the whole system last year. Really screwed a lot of things up."
Steve snorted a laugh and led him down the hall to the doctor's office. "No, I'm not," he said with too much assurance in his voice.
He shrugged and stabbed another forkful of egg, sausage, and pancake. "I don't know," he said and shoved the bite in his mouth. "Clothes, I guess."
"He's down in his workshop," Bruce said as the downstairs came in view, and he saw Tony just stepping off the elevator and making his way across the broad living area toward the refurbished bar. Olivia went flying down the steps, not even bothering to hold onto the railing, and Bruce's heart jumped into this throat as he watched, waiting for her to take a massive tumble.
"I know, Mister— er, Miss— uh—"
But Thor just met his gaze, seemingly perplexed that Tony was perplexed.
"Wait, hold on. The man that let a German scientist and my asshole father shoot him up with steroids and then throw him in a radiation chamber has a problem with
About the only upside Tony could see to that at the moment was that Barton had lost his stupid fucking bet.
"Did you eat anything? We found a pizza place a few miles away. Not very good, but it's in the kitchen if you're interested."
," he said as it hit him — the strange and almost caught-out look Steve was giving him. "Oh, you crafty son-of-a-bitch, you already asked JARVIS to show it to you, didn't you?"
"Then yeah, I guess he is going to be a hundred."
OK, that was not the look of someone in the know. He definitely hadn't figured out that Tony had already helped himself to the junk, and as far as Tony was concerned, he was never going to figure it out.
"I'm sorry for what I'm about to name you because it's not fair to either one of us. But it's the name your father and I picked out when we didn't think we'd even need it, and we never decided on another, so, welcome to the world, Miss Olivia Louise."
"I ever see him again, I'll gladly take a swing at him," Steve said with an earnest and curt nod of the head. "And I'm not that much of a pervert. I just...enjoy playing with you."
"Cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake with whipped cream. And get me a large Coke, too."
Other Tony stopped abruptly and exchanged a look with Tracy before he turned to Tony. "Uh, well, like I said—"
"Did you have a nice nap?" Bruce asked because, yeah, it figured even
Tony 'tsked' and shook his head. "Shoulda gotten that prenup."
. I thought the guy was a crackpot. Couldn't understand why the government was contracting with
Ah. So, he was picturing Cap—
"You said so. Why? You don't
"And?"
But Steve just sighed again and dropped his arm. "If it'll make you happy," he said and pushed himself to sit up.
"Hmm…that's sweet that you would think that."
"Kids. Do they have kids?"
It had been a while since Tony had done the club thing, so he was a little out of practice, and he'd forgotten how deplorable the whole thing could be when you were single and desperate for a hook-up. He tried to be polite as could be as he stumbled his way through the crowd to get to the bathrooms — fuck, he'd never had to pee so much in his life as he had the past couple of months — and he gritted his teeth as someone bumped into him and splashed their drink on him.
"What are you?" Tony muttered. "My therapist?"
"The only one she doesn't seem to know is JARVIS, who she keeps saying sounds like someone called 'Vision.' She knows Pepper and the Spy Twins. She's mentioned a bunch of other people I've never heard of. In fact, the
Steve rolled his eyes but said nothing.
There was another cloud of silence that hung over the crowd before, at once, everyone began talking and shouting at him, and above the din, he was able to make out one shouting to him, "
"Hey!" Steve said and put his hands over Olivia's ears. "Don't use that kind of language around her— What?" he asked and cocked his head at Tony's rather bemused expression.
"You're kidding me, right?"
He watched as Steve swallowed but said nothing. Oh, he
Still, he scowled and waved Bruce off as the kid said, "Yeah, I know, but Daddy always does it."
Or something more.
. Again, what's the point of that? The baby doesn't have any concept of time. It's floating around in a bubble of goo and gets fed through a tube in its stomach. Talk about a fucking charmed life."
Steve shrugged again, setting the glass down and turning to tuck his legs under the blankets. "Just…a feeling, I guess. I don't know. He— He's always around with Sam or Nat or Clint or even Thor or Bruce. I don't— I don't see him much. Try to talk to him about things that happened to us or places we used to go, and he just…doesn't seem interested. I guess I can't blame him."
more stubborn than he is? It's like you people don't know him at all."
"Yeah, she can't stay here. None of her stuff's here. Hey, you want some eggs? Clearly, I can scramble eggs. Just don't ask for an omelette."
her. And did you—? Did you hear what she
He put his other hand on top of Steve's so that Steve's hand was sandwiched in between his hands, and they stayed like that a moment, neither one saying or doing anything but staring down at Tony's abdomen, and Steve was the one to finally break the silence by saying, "You know, if we really want to make that appointment, we'd better leave now."
"Yeah, but we could protect them better than anyone—"
"For all I know, nothing would happen! For all I know, the worst that could happen is the serum ups your tolerance and you need more drugs than you normally would. But I don't know that that
"You know, if he just joined us permanently, he wouldn't even have to worry about getting a leave. In the real world, they're called 'vacation days.' Or 'sick days'—" he stopped rubbing Steve's shoulders for a moment to use finger quotes on the phrase, "—which, for whatever reason, always seem to happen on the nicest summer days."
at an obstetrician's office — with a noticeably pregnant brunette female."
"You said. How?"
The doors closed, and Bruce said, "Tony, listen to me. Things are a little crazy right now. I can't promise Denise is even going to be able to get to you—"
"Well," Bruce said, and Tony wasn't sure if he was relieved or annoyed that he had some rapport with the brat, "maybe your Aunt…Pepper…thought it was time to pay some attention to your sister, too?"
He sat down in the vacant chair next to Tony, and he handed Tony the clear one, and Tony kissed in his direction in thanks.
Tony pointed the stylus at him. "That stays between us."
Tony made a face. "No, don't call them 'speakers.' That sounds so… Call them 'auditory feedback relays.'"
done a stupid fucking job of this whole thing. If the entire purpose of life on this earth was to keep making more of the species, then Mother Nature should have figured out a fucking way not to make the grand finale of it so goddamned
" Steve murmured in insult behind him, but Tony scowled at Barton and the rest of the quickly-departing moochers and was about to open his mouth to tell them he was happy to see the backs of their heads because they spent too much time up there eating him out of house and home anyway, but they all left the kitchen, talking amongst themselves as they headed for the elevator.
Again, it wasn't like there was ever a chance of it happening. It couldn't happen, could it? Wait… much as he loved her, 'Olivia' was an old-lady name, right? So, chances were that the Cap had picked out that name for their little chatterbox sprog, right?
Steve sat back, perplexed. "What?" he asked, but Tony took that opportunity to step into the elevator and direct JARVIS to take him down to his lab.
"I don't mean just that. I mean what about JARVIS? What about DUM-E and poor U?
Wilson's eyes lit up. "Wait, seriously?" he asked, turning to Barton.
He felt Steve brush his lips over the crown of his head. "I know, but I mean it. Anything for you. Always."
He tried to appear casual, and he tried to sit down at his workstation like it was nothing but he couldn't sit still, and he kept fiddling with anything he could get his hands on, and he was up and down off his chair at least five times in a span of five minutes. Maybe it was just nervous energy he was trying to get rid of.
So, Steven Grant Rogers would get to marry Anthony Edward Stark after all.
"Yeah," Tony said like it was the simplest thing in the world.
Daddy.
"I'm just a kid from Brooklyn that wanted to do the right thing. That's all. You ask anyone that knew me then, before all this—" he motioned over himself; Tony presumed he meant the very fit body, "—they'd tell you I was a snot-nosed punk that didn't know when to back down from a fight, that I had something to prove. I'm not a saint. Far from it."
The entire congregation went silent at that, not out of reverence for Thor's words but more because it seemed none of them really knew what to say to it.
"I didn't. I let him fall. I let him die. I—"
Three compliments, and not one comment about his breasts. This was verging on a record of some kind.
"Don't even joke about that. I'll drag you down to fucking Fort Lauderdale if I have to."
"Might be some ex-SHIELD medical staff bumbling around here somewhere," Barton suggested.
"Don't care," Steve reiterated and guided Tony over to the bed. "Where do you want me? Do you want me to stand? Sit? There's a chair over there. I can sit—"
Steve pulled out with a thoroughly debauched squelch, and as Tony gasped and pressed his forehead into his bound hands, he felt Steve kiss his shoulder again and say, "This was the second time. One more, and then it's your turn. Then you can come. Still OK, Antonia?"
