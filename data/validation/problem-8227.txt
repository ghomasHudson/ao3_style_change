“Oh. Does Steve know that?”
“Drink, Cap?”
(Luckily, Happy ended up finding new clothes and toiletries for the Captain, and Tony was in a personal hospital suite, so he would shower in the en suite bathroom, ignoring shaving to save time from being away from his Omega).
“Okay, okay. Commencing eating… now.”
“Yes…”
“Tasha, don’t you dare!  Please, if you love me at all, don’t say it!”
’ he thought strongly. ‘
Tell me what you think!
“Since childhood. Any more questions?”
“So, I’m your guinea pig then?”
“They’ve both been shot!”
“Ugh, really?!”
“Morning, campers!” announced lightly.  “And, isn’t it a fine morning?”
“Damn! And, I thought I would get you with that one.”
“You don’t know me like that, Romanov… have you been stalking me?”
“Someplace to talk…” Tony replied.  “In peace…”
“Monitor the Captain’s activities, whereabouts, what-have-you tomorrow.  I want to know what’s so important to him that he had to go home early.”
“Good morning to you, too,” Tony responded softly.  “You stayed…”
Steve grinned at the omega adoringly, making the officer’s warmth radiate up from Tony’s hand, through his arm and outward towards his whole body.
The beta took a few deep breaths, before gradually putting the Sig Sauer down and back in its secure hiding place and putting the car in ‘drive’.
“No, I was not having a heart attack, Feathers!”
“Yeah, Tony?”  The physicist wondered back.
He winked at her, and with a smile, he left the office, but not before snagging a sucker out of the candy dish on the doctor’s desk.
“That sucks ass…”
“You alright, Tony?” Nat questioned, seeing her friend’s twitch.
“Because you know why, sir…”
“Well, he’s smart, and he’s learning how you are…”
“How many laps has that been already?” Natasha questioned.
“That bedroom of his though… yikes!” Tony muttered under his breath toward his husband, who merely shook his head and rolled his eyes in annoyance.  He mouthed ‘
“Tony, you did nothing wrong; no one did anything wrong. I just have to head back my apartment. I’m not usually out this late, and I have to be up early tomorrow. I’m also really not the best at small talk, so it’s better that I go now, before I thoroughly embarrass myself.”
Happy reading and enjoy!
“Did I?  Tony, I never said I need you to help me make it.”
Tony had something to hide, but he obviously didn't hide it well enough.
“I have no idea.” Natasha responded.  “Clint?”
Steve grabbed the other man’s hands and held them in his own.
:  strong language in this chapter! Be aware!!]
A faint beeping sound…
“Sam didn’t deserve this.” Clint piped up.
His darkened goatee isn’t manicured like it normally is.  A shadow of stubble was visible evidence that he hadn’t shaved that morning…
He could tell Tony was back from his appointment without even seeing him first.
“Tony… don’t be a stalker…”
And, as always, happy reading and enjoy!
Steve opened Tony’s airway again and gave him another two breaths. He went back to doing 30 chest compressions and another two breaths.  After he did his fifth round of compressions, he felt and smelt another Alpha’s presence.  He turned to see Natasha running onto the pool deck, grabbing a small box out of the closet, before moving over to him and Tony.
’ old!” Tony reacted, pointing to himself alone, before getting dirty looks from Steve and Bucky.  “Sorry, boys.  Present company included.  ‘
“No, F.R.I.!” the teenager mumbled into his pillow.  “Too er-wee!  Go ‘way!”
“Well do, sir…”
“Yes!” The oldest Stark-Rogers boy cheered.
Nat and Sam trotted their way around the reservoir for the second time. Steve ran past them again making sure to wave at them and state lightly “On your left…” before jogging towards The Metropolitan Museum of Art (MoMa) for the umpteenth time.
As soon as the elevator doors closed on Sam’s floor, Tony and Steve couldn’t exactly keep their hands and mouths off of one another.
“Jarvis, I can’t stop CPR to get it!  Please send help!”
“Мы встретимся снова, капитан,” the mysterious figure stated matter-of-factly.  “Я без колебаний завершу свою миссию по уничтожению тебя.”
“True, but…”
“Natalia Alianovna Romanova, I don’t believe you!” Tony exclaimed, feigning shock.  “How dare you! I’ll have you know that I’m incredibly nosey.  ‘
“Oh-kay, but you do know that that’s never gonna happen. Happy’s not even strong enough to take me down.”
The pressure's high, just to stay alive
((What do we think about these latest revelations in the storyline?  Let me know!))
“Say that one more time… this time slower…”
“Fine…” the man choked out, clearing his throat.  “Just fine. Brucey?”
“Yeah, I guess she does, doesn’t she?”
Sorry, this has taken me so much time to post.  This chapter was done, but RL made it hard to find time to do so.
“And so?”
“Really, Tony?  Now, I need to know what brought on this whole state of affairs.  Spill it, or I’ll use my alpha voice again…”
“You’re not going to strain off the grease?” Tony wondered aloud.
“Nat, are you teaching my J things?  Because he just said that same exact sentiment to me not 5 minutes ago…”
Layers of ham, turkey and chicken interlaced with Colby, Swiss and provolone cheese on nine-grain bread with fresh greens, mayo and cranberry mustard.
“Hey, it’s your place, Tony… but, it is still really early in the morning, so I would suggest not starting to drink this early…”
How could he have been so blind to it?
“Whoa, I scored a virgin…”
“Guess you can call me a ‘neat freak’ in that aspect, Tony,” He retorted. “The only times it smells like my Alpha are when I’m in rut and when I come back from my workouts...”
“Steve…” Tony gasped as he tried to catch his breath.  “You have to… Uhhhh, you have to s-s-s-stop…”
“What-the-hell happened?” Tony demanded to know.
“No, I’m going to eat; I’ve just never made either of these before, that’s all.”
“That is correct, Ms. Romanoff. Peggy Carter was a beta military officer, as is Sharon Carter. Mr. Wilson is a fellow alpha. Ms. Carter and Mr. Wilson are not mates, nor is she the mate of Captain Rogers.”
“Do better than your best, J.” Tony piped up.  “Make Daddy proud.”
“Naw… that was Bucky’s mom.”
Would Tony even want him as his Alpha after all of this?
“Amen to that!”
“No, I’ve never been an alpha before.  I was a lonely beta before everything happened.”
“I’m in Hell, J… A Hell of my own making.  Do I want to know what Cap is doing this morning?”
“Too frisky?  Is there such a thing?”
“Hey, Steve…” the redhead spoke up first.
If he slept, that is if his body allowed him to, he would do it in the other bed in the suite for a very short time.  As soon as he awoke or not, he would take a shower, rinsing away the former day from his mind.  He’d change his clothes and underwear, then comb through his hair, before not before brushing his teeth and putting on deodorant & cologne.  Then, he’d tie his shoes and mussed up his short ‘beard’, if you want to call it that, he’d go back to his seat next to Tony’s bed and his current novel to read aloud to the philanthropist.
-- C.E.C.
Hello, friends!
“Fine. You want my honest opinion about all of this?”
“Why is he suddenly ‘my’ son, when he doesn’t want to wake up early?” Tony wondered aloud to anyone in hearing distance.
I am so sorry this chapter took so long to post.
Even though all four of the kids had half of Steve’s serum-enhanced DNA, the doctors Strange & Banner were more worried about the half of their DNA that came from Tony and Tony himself.
“Yep, I’ll just roll up my sleeves and get these fixed up tout suite.” The other man responded with a smile.
“Okay, big boy…” Tony piped up, moving away from the man’s grasp.  “That’s enough now…”
“And, that’s a bad thing?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right away, sir…”
He didn’t want to go towards it, because people always say that when someone is dying, they see a light and want to move towards it to end their suffering. He didn’t want to do that; he was still too young… in a manner of speaking.
“And, who is J?” Steve whispered to the other man.
“Right now, my game card is all filled up… Maybe sometime later…” was Steve’s answer.
“Honest truth right here & right now, Cap:  Tony had a tingling sensation in his arm that woke up him up…” Sam stated to his friend.  “And, his buddy Jarvis, whoever the hell he is, knew exactly where we were today…”
Not for a second.
He decided to go on strike… well, sort-of.
Behind him sat Dr. Tiffany Ben-Hamin, longtime therapist to the stars and to one Anthony Edward Stark.  At 5’5” tall with olive skin, dark brown hair & eyes and a strong, sharp jaw line & chin, Doc (as Tony calls her) was seated behind her desk, listening to her patient’s words intently.
“And yourself?”
’ He thought to himself.  ‘
“Language, Harold! They are children in the car!” Tony responded brazenly, before getting a dirty look from Steve.
“Cap, I don’t know what you got going on in that knot-brain of yours, but this isn’t going to happen right now…” Tony stated swiftly.  “We need to discuss all of this first.”
“Too damn late for that, Cap.  Bullet’s already in the chamber, ready to fire…”
“I’m a rather annoyed Omega, J.  And, right now, do you really wanna be packed up and allow Friday her time to shine in this house?”
He was out for blood… in a manner of speaking.
Annoyed by this new feeling in his arm and frustrated that he was awake at an ungodly hour, Tony threw his bed covers off of his body.  Lying there in just his Iron Man boxer-briefs, he sighed loudly in disgust.
“Nat, I’m sorry,” Steve started, looking at his friend.  “But, I don’t see --”
The three adults continued to bicker with one another over everything; it would get someone upset, namely Steve, who was dealing with a lot of emotions at that moment (mostly due to lack of sleep).
“Steve…” the billionaire responded back.  “Are you back to yourself now?”
I may bring a little bit of smut or sensuality to the next chapter.  It would be Steve & Tony's 'first time' so-to speak.
“You are predictable as a squirrel going after a nut, sir…”
Tony took a few deep breaths, relaxing himself before asking into the ether, “Hey, J?”
For the first time in his life, Iron Man was flustered around an Alpha.
Out of the blue, the recognizable ringer of a cell phone entered their head-space, pulling them apart slowly:
And, with that, Tony made his way swiftly out of the space, avoiding everyone including Pepper, who was shouting at him asking him where he was going and that he was going to be late to several meetings.
“Yes, but how-in-the-Holy-heck am I wet?  What happened here?”
“But, I didn’t see that gun coming, and I should have.”
Steve continued to caress Tony’s scent gland with his left hand, but now incorporated the curls of hair at the base of the billionaire’s head, knowing that this would get a rise out of him.  This new stimuli was quickly escalating Tony’s already fragile libido, much like before with the sandwich.
“I would like to try this slowly, Tony…”
“Oh, yeah, she would.”
“Sadly yes…”
“I’m not researching anything, sir…” Jarvis suddenly piped up.
“Can I answer that one?” Rhodey piped up, as he winked at his best friend.
“So, are you saying that you’re not having ‘a beautiful day in Mr. Rogers’ neighborhood’?”
“What, Tony?”  Steve wondered, concerned that he was missing pertinent information.  “Say again, ‘Mega…”
“Okay… Islickedwhenyoumoanedandyousmeltmeandcameafterme, soIhadtosprayyoudownwithwater…”
“Not exactly…”
“No, Tony, this is not you… you can talk to anyone…”
Looking like he had not a care in the world…
“Hey, guys…” Sam finally spoke up.  (Everyone had forgotten he was there).  “I’m gonna head out.  I don’t think I need to be here for this…”
“He’s where?”
The military man pressed his nose into the crook of the billionaire’s neck, taking in the engaging scents of the throbbing gland.
“No, Tony! Right now, you’re an asshole … a really big asshole!”
“I thought we needed to discuss some things, and I wanted to see that you were well-rested first…”
“Tony?”  the Captain asked softly, approaching the hospital bed.
Here are some links to things mentioned in the story:
“So, what should we do now?”
“Don’t worry, J… I will make sure he doesn’t get wet and doesn’t eat after midnight.”
“So did my father, but genetics:  what can you do, huh?”
“I can’t either…” Sam replied.  “He’s a machine…”
Yes, he was rescued by Steve.
“Have you either of you made any plans about your future together?”
Before anyone else could saying anything, a memorable voice exclaimed as he approached, “On your --!”
“Tony, that’s not what I mean.”
“More like day-by-day, Tony…”
“Oh my word! Captain America ‘not’ such a prude after all?” Tony stated with fake astonishment, clutching his own chest.  “How I am just hearing about this now? Someone call the newspapers immediately!  Captain America is a horn-dog!”
-- C.E.C.
Steve turned back to the billionaire, grinning, “And, have you found the best yet?”
Steve looks between the panel and Tony. “Tony?” he says tentatively.
Steve watched him. “Sounds reasonable,” he replied, noncommittal.
“You’re repeating Clint,” Steve murmurs, dazed.
“A personal favorite of mine, I must confess,” the Ancient One said. She settled on a divan and crossed her legs neatly beneath her. “Now, we have about twenty minutes before Dr. Banner shows up. There are unintended and unforeseen consequences, it seems, to Tony Stark’s sacrifice.”
“Swordfish are endangered,” Pepper says severely. “I can’t–you know what, never mind.”
Steve exhaled wetly. “Sure thing,” he said, sounding a little steadier. “Don’t expect any meaningful responses, though.”
“Hey,” he murmured, “Hey, Tasha. You saved the world. Nay, the universe.”
“You have
He and Bruce watched him go. “What do you think she’s doing?” Bruce murmured.
Bucky hugged him. It still felt just the smallest bit odd, being taller than him.
Sam stared at him. “Don’t you need it?”
“Relax,” Pepper said, pushing at his shoulder a little, enough to steer them into a slow rotation on the carpet. “You barely even have to move your feet, and I’m leading so you’re not about to step on mine.” She smiled. “Eyes on me. Don’t look down.”
Fury, once—his expression, as always, unamused.
“I guess you weren’t kidding when you said Stark was helpful, when you were sailing to shore.”
Thor sees his brother.
“You base your judgments on predictions
That night, Steve dreamed of a rambling, indefinable house, seemingly visible only through warped mirrors blanketed in a heavy mist.  Hallways spiraled and bucked, felt familiar but he didn’t know from where, and occasionally he found himself ducking down to avoid a streak of light that projected overhead, or to one side of him.
“You talk a lot.”
When Tony first inherited Stark Industries, he was deluged by paperwork that Obadiah had to walk him through, reviewing each department and what he could expect from it, each project and its progress. Among them was a yearly expedition that was run in collaboration with the Navy.
Tony had only tightened up when Steve had asked about Howard: “He’s dead I’m afraid, Cap. And we weren’t on the best of terms, so I’d rather you read up on him, if you don’t mind.”
“What?” Steve snapped, feeling absurd about addressing a voice in his head and a floating green gem, but that’s all he’s got, so. “We’re out of danger, you made your sacrifice and fixed everything, there’s no reason for you to die now, not when we have this chance!”
“I dream about Dad a lot,” Morgan said, nodding. “It’s nice to see him.”
Darcy pokes her shoulder. “Drink your coffee, have a shower, get some actual sleep in a bed, not under your desk. Erik’s got some stuff he wants to show you when you’ve got a second, but it can definitely wait until tomorrow. If you’re really good, I’ll talk him into putting some pants on too.”
“Think about it,” Tony said lightly. “And lemme know when SHIELD finally lets you out of this prison of a government building. Got a room in Stark Tower with your name on it, same as your big band buddy over here. Google the place–you have figured out Googling by this point, yes?–I think you’ll find it’s prime real estate. Better than Brooklyn, which is unfortunately overrun with hipsters now.” He looked at his watch. “Pepper might destroy me in the face if I’m late for this meeting, so I’ve gotta go. But I’ll catch you both later. Ciao.”
“Tweed, Steve, really? You’re going with tweed.”
Five years to let go. And Steve was still holding on tightly. Though to what, he couldn’t quite tell anymore. It seemed like it was changing all the time.
From behind him, he heard the distant shouting of Fury. “Rogers! Rogers, what the fuck do you think you’re doing?”
“Extract him into what?” the Ancient One countered. “His body is ash, Captain, per his wishes. Moreover, he will need to gain mastery of himself in each of the Stones, not just the Mind Stone, before he can be extracted in one piece. I can see that he’s begun this process, but he has far to go.”
Tony cocked his head. “I think I did more to prevent him coming home than anyone else.”
Steve didn’t miss a trick. He scowled and let a breath out. “Kind of hard to tell. She was more of an impression than an actual, you know,
He startled, and turned to find Pepper leaning in the doorway, holding a glass of something amber on ice.
“Not so far as we know,” Fury said. “His cells have aged, albeit not very much while they were effectively cryogenically frozen. We’ll know more after Rogers has had more than a few days to stick around.”
Tony’s voice gentled.
“Coulson,” Natasha finishes. They all look at her. “We were his team. They need Coulson to do the debrief.”
“You have it.” He tipped his head towards Morgan, who was deeply concentrated on the rhythm of
They stare at each other for a long moment. Then it’s Tony who exhales.
“Most dirty jokes are terrible in some way or another.” He coughed again.
“Okay,” Steve said in resignation, “Have it your way.”
“You too,” Natasha said. “I wish it were under better circumstances.”
“I use punching bags,” Steve said. “Does what you do help?”
“Put it back,” Tony murmured, over and over. “Put it all back.”
Bucky chokes.
“Sorry,” Steve hastened to add. “Not talking to you.”
“And you, Mrs. Potts.”
He was quiet for a moment. “Maybe. But that’s different.”
Tony has his hand curled around his forearm, where the gauntlet ends. “There isn’t a seam,” he says, deathly quiet, to himself.
“Wrong. Military staff maybe, but my property, my expedition.”
“You’re a fucking car wreck, Stark,” Bucky says, striding forward. “A hot mess without the hot.”
“Have you not been here before?” Steve asks incredulously.
Natasha smiles grimly. “He doesn’t exactly need all of us on the small stuff, does he? But this looks…”
“I know what I’d do, usually,” Tony says. He drinks, sets down the glass. “If it were just me. If they weren’t watching us.”
Tony looks at him, and Steve lets him. He doesn’t know what Tony sees. Realizes that he hasn’t cared about that in a while, but he does now, suddenly and strongly.
Tony manages a wan smile. “No, but I’ve got this feeling I know what he’s talking about.”
“No,” Tony said eventually. “However, I have just about had it with this one super irritating bug in the suit’s ventilation system, and need to talk at someone who isn’t a product of my brain in order to maybe get to the bottom of it. Can that someone be you?”
“Tony?!” Jim took a step forward.
“That’s new,” Steve said, nodding at the projection on one wall of the elevator, of a broad expanse of the city.
more reliable than this, it seemed to him.
If Steve touched him, he was certain he would burn.
Tony closed his hand around Steve’s gauntleted wrist. It burned again, but this time Steve could feel something else underneath the closed circuit, something like intent, something like
When Tony closes his eyes and leans into him, Steve just wraps his other arm around the small of his back, and lets him stay that way.
“Well they don’t have him!” Tony throws up his hands. “Coulson’s–”
I don’t think they were expecting much trouble from me on this end. Probably best if you find me a secure network off of SHIELD’s system, though.
Steve sighed. “That by defeating Thanos, we might have called unwanted attention to ourselves, from other universes who weren’t so lucky. She wanted us to be on our guard.”
“No, not you, Strange. God, he really is an idiot. Couldn’t just let me drift into the ether like a normal superhero, had to be the last goddamn guy to lay down on the wire—”
When the world cleared, the first thing Steve became aware of was salt.
“It’s efficient. I like efficient. Will you make bacon for breakfast?”
No, they weren’t.
“Don’t be on Facebook, you’ll only learn about how terrible all your friends are. Try Twitter instead, there are already fifteen Captain Americas on there at least, you’ll blend right in.”
“If you’re keeping me a secret, am I allowed to walk around here?” Steve asked.
Steve dodged out of the way of a line of guards, slunk past a colonel and then darted through a staff door that was inches from swinging shut. He took the stairs two at a time, and came out on the twentieth floor. There, he swiped a key card from a passing pilot, and went back into the stairwell. Ten more flights, and he was keying into the rooftop landing pad. He walked normally from there, and then dropped into a crouch behind a pile of crates.
The lights around the lab brighten slightly. Tony’s not really sure if JARVIS meant them to. “Of course. How could I forget?” JARVIS says, perhaps even warmer.
Bucky tensed and then settled in the space of a second. “Good choice.”
“Hear that, guys? Don’t split up, best you can.”
“Hey, I
“A productive journey,” he amended.
“Gotta be a sorcerer thing,” Steve murmured. “All the drama.”
She swallowed. “Yes, well. He’s not my husband.”
At first, Steve just thought he’d gotten sweat in his eyes. He blinked and swiped at them, and then looked again, but then it became undeniable, the oil-slick iridescence in the air, just slightly taller than the door frame, rippling faintly.
He didn’t want to know. He had to know.
“I’m sorry.”
“You look wrecked,” Darcy observes, sauntering over and putting a mug of coffee on the desk. “More wrecked than usual, and not the mopey my-boyfriend’s-gone-off-to-do-god-stuff kind of wrecked either. What’s up?”
“Good. Thanks for bringing him home.”
God damn it. “I should punch you for that.”
“Holy shit,” the second one repeats. “If you’re Tony Stark, then he’s actually—“
“Yeah, I guess,” Steve echoed. He sounded awful. His eyes were red-rimmed. He sniffed, and scrubbed a hand over his mouth. “Can I help with anything? Toast?”
Steve loves New York so much.
Steve huffed. “Probably.” He looked around. The room was bright with sun coming in through the skylight overhead. “How long?”
All of that amounted to having to build some sort of port between the suit and the Cradle, which meant designing some adaptations.
First stop: 2012, the Time Stone to Bleeker Street. He just needed to make the first stop, and then the next, and the next, and then go home. And try to move on.
"Destroy it,” Tony answers. He wants to look away, but Steve has him pinned, his stare heavy with his expectation, unreadable and unmovable all at once. Fuck it, Tony can’t look away, but he doesn’t
“Sleep well?” Jim asked, finishing with the eggs and sliding one portion towards Morgan, who immediately started digging in.
Pepper narrowed her eyes. Tony tried to start walking again; she put a finger on his chest. He stopped. She crossed her arms.
“The lipids make our tongues go ‘mmm’!” she announced. “It’s evolution!”
He fought down an onslaught of nausea. Stumbled a few more paces towards Bleeker Street before he nearly dropped the case.
“They’re letting you near me?” Steve asked dryly. He’d overheard a
She was so goddamn beautiful.
“Water will help,” Helen said, handing over a bottle from one of the storage shelves. Steve cracked it open and offered it. Tony nodded, and let Steve get a few swallows down his throat. His eyes were wide, shocked.
“Whenever you are, Dr. Cho.”
“Right,” Steve said. Drew back slowly.
Tony flipped up his faceplate, and grinned back. “Adrenaline junkie. Takes one to know one.” He waited for a second, half expecting Steve to say something more, but when he didn’t, he rocked back on his heels and said, maybe a little too brightly, “So, wanna see your new digs, then?”
It was sort of funny.
“Maria Hill,” Fury said, by way of explanation. “She and Coulson are my top clearance staff members. At the moment, your identity is Need To Know. I don’t have time for the bullshit that your presence would incur, should word of you get around, so I’d appreciate it if you kept your personal security tight. Believe me when I say that you are not prepared for modern media, Rogers.”
“I cannot find any technical problems, sir.”
“Tony?” Her neck was broken. There were soft places at the back of her skull that shouldn’t be soft. Nausea pulled at the back of his throat. “Please?”
She knelt and touched the herald, and he disappeared.
Steve raised his eyebrow. “Because people want to know that about ‘Steve Ryerson’?” It was the alias Steve had been given at SHIELD, at least for the staff who weren’t in-the-know. Steve didn’t think it suited him at all, but he hadn’t said anything about it.
“Your neurons are adapting and reconnecting at an unheard of rate,” one of the techs explained. “We’d like to record the progress.”
Hell, maybe he already could. He was overfull, just like Tony, ever expanding with possibilities.
He shrugged, “As ready as I’ll ever be. We need to get them back there, so.”
“Tony’s mad as hell about it,” Steve said. He wavered on his feet, and then steadied again. God, he was tired. “Keeps telling me I should’ve let him go.” He saved a new set of algorithms with a hand-wave. “He sounds like you, Buck. Worrywart. But I couldn’t.” He pulled up a file that he was only half-sure he could decipher. The symbols and shorthand were all mixed into one another, but the logic...huh. He could follow the logic, and maybe fill in the blanks from there.
“Can you look straight forward for me, Captain?” Helen cut in. “I’m just going to take some general readings.”
“I noticed,” Bruce said, “That you had a look at the Stones yesterday.”
“Mm. I’m afraid if I have one I’ll be a weeping mess within the hour.” She cut him a crooked smile. “I’ll save that for when you’re all gone.”
“Panicked,” Tony finishes. He gets up and ventures closer to where Steve is standing. The bundle turns its narrow, thin-boned face towards him, blinks twice, and cocks its head. It’s bizarrely cute. “JARVIS, run those clicks it said and try and crack the language.”
“Pie,” Sam supplies, looking, if anything, more embarrassed. “Dean introduced—Christ, uh,
Tony gave him a long look from across the table. “I certainly hope that’s true,” he said roughly.
“Yeah,” he said. “I’ve got time.” He covered her hand with his. “You got a radio in here? I think I owe you a dance. Then I’ll let you be.”
“Tony.”
He didn’t need the rig to take it off after mark one, even when it was badly damaged; Dummy just picked it all up and put it back into embrace of the hydraulic arms that sorted all of the parts, sending the damaged ones off to be reshaped and reassembled while the usable pieces were readied for the next time Tony needed to put them on.
Bucky and Sam headed off soon after. “Got a call from Fury, he said he had something for us to look into, if we’re interested.”
felt like a dagger slipped between his ribs.
“What will happen to him?” Steve asked, gesturing to the herald.
“What hold up?” a voice says from behind Thor. “And who the fuck are you?”
But Natasha was off on her mission, and Dr. Feranza was taking his answers with more and more caution, given his willingness to go out of bounds.
“I’m fine,” Steve said, pawing at the sofa in a bid to pull himself upright. He had no help in that regard; Tony pushed him back into the cushions, and Pepper parked herself close to his ankles, where she could hold his knees in place. He exhaled in halting puffs, and then looked up at Tony’s faceplate. “Natasha came to see me.”
“It’s important,” Steve said.
He shut his eyes tightly for a second, and then turned, taking care to modulate his voice. “Hey, Morgan. What can I do for you?”
Steve half expected it to be more tea, which didn’t sound appealing. His mouth tasted burned, like he’d eaten charcoal. Also...artificial coconut?
Fury sighed. “Get in here, Coulson. You too, Agent Hill—and shut the damn door behind you. Have you told Barton, Romanov?”
“It had better,” Rhodey muttered.
“On cleanup?” Steve suggests, looking around at the wreckage. They’re all stuffed to the gills with shawarma, and it’s kind of a great feeling, but Clint’s pretty sure that if he tries to do more than get into a bed and lie down he’s going to just do himself more damage, so yeah.
“Please,” Steve said, maybe too quickly.
Natasha made a face. “We recently switched security systems and haven’t gotten Starkphones to support them yet, it’s kind of tragic.”
“We usually knock first,” he said. “It’s the polite thing.”
Steve pinches the bridge of his nose. Wonders if there’s a chance of escape, any at all. He was a super soldier–it should be possible, even in a room full of Avengers with gleeful looks on their faces.
to choose me after you got to know me. Three years, Steve? Really?”
It wasn’t often that a man elicited that particular adjective from Tony, but then again, Captain America was hardly an average man.
The space around them was very...orange.
Anyway. The damn bridge malfunctions, because there’s no other reason for why Thor should end up in Kansas for fuck’s sake.
I’m seeing her again next week. Maybe she’ll be better. It was good to see her.
Which is saying something, considering that half of New York is in shambles, so technically
Which was how Steve ended up splitting his enormous amount of free time either sparring with Natasha or reading heavily redacted files.
“Fuck,” he whispered.
to, either. “Leave nothing but a smear on the asphalt. I know we’re supposed to salvage something, so we can study it later, but I. No. If someone else sees it ever again, it’ll be too soon.”
When Tony showed up in the cafeteria, he was carrying the suit in briefcase-form, and was wearing a black t-shirt and rumpled jeans stuffed into what looked like stolen SHIELD-issue combat boots.
And that had been that, until today.
“Residential still. Just…clear.”
“The strong man–hm, we should have brought Thor…”
Pepper thought nonsensically. Less like armor, more like a wirework model of a person, or primitive graphics come to life. It encased Steve fully, and then seemed to tighten around him, like it was learning his contours, polygons giving way to smooth curves.
“Um. I’ll think on it.”
“Mrs. Potts,” Strange started.
A lot of trouble and paperwork could have been avoided if Ethan had just called earlier.

“You shouldn’t,” Natasha replied. “But you shouldn’t worry either, not for a while. With his herald taken from him, he’ll be a while looking for another. And we’ll be issuing a warning to him. That should keep him away from this Earth for some time.”
Life at SHIELD HQ was…regular.
“How are the other residents?” he’d asked, when the real estate agent was showing him around the too-good-to-be-true apartment. He’d already tested all of the faucets and checked the ceiling for leaks, and so far things seemed scarily in order.
And now the whole city looked like sheet metal and glass. Yet he was approaching it like his mother had as a little girl—Ellis Island to his right, filled with the names, true and false, of those that had come before him. It was a strange juxtaposition.
“Dude, littering,” Clint says, and Tony flips him off.
Bucky didn’t even jump; he must have known Steve was waking up for ages. “Hey, punk.” He put down the book he was reading. “That was some stunt you pulled.”
Jane, did you not learn that in grade school?
ready too, for reasons he is not entirely ready to face yet. Never mind that what he’s constructing is worryingly tailored to his tastes.
“Well, you let me know if you need any more reading material for him,” Pepper said.
Bucky looks at the ceiling, and wishes for death. “You idiots are missing my point,” he says.
“Okay. What’re you building?”
Bruce only gets a little green around the eyes, a little bulkier. He figures it’s because he’s been using the Tower’s gym.
When he couldn’t sleep, he usually sat out on the porch until it got too cold to stay. He found Pepper out there more nights than not. Sometimes her eyes were red. The first time it was like that, he moved to go and she’d said, too sharply, “No. Stay,” and from then on, he just sat with her and stayed quiet. He hoped it helped.

He was shaking his head before she even finished speaking. “Bruce—”
“I just dream about the cold,” he blurted out.
Steve exhaled. That was…not as bad (or, well,
“You’re damned right it’s about guilt,” Tony snaps, hand coming down on the table flat. “What happened in Sokovia was all me, and like it or not, I should be tried for it. But because Iron Man got some good press about it in the States, fighting the good fight with the Avengers, we as a country have decided that I’m a-okay, I’m fine, besides, Eastern Europe doesn’t really matter, we’ve ignoring what goes on there for
“Fuck, fuck, fuck, come on Steve, snap out of it,” the suit chanted, sounding like Tony but also very much not. It got its arm around Steve’s back and knees, and then lifting him bodily off the ground like he weighed nothing. “Can we clear a way to the couch?”
Pepper looked away. “Thanks. I miss her, too.”
Steve stutters to a halt. He had not prepared for this contingency.
She did it anyway.
Next to Natasha’s cool, pale head, the Soul Stone glinted, and then vanished.
“I don’t look that deep. It’s rude.”
“We were fighting something, I think. Or running away from something. Anyway, it felt very familiar. Very...plausible? And then I woke up, and thought he was
“‘Kay,” Morgan said amenably, and turned away, blissfully unaware of the history she’d just excavated and then promptly re-buried. “Mom! Steve’s gonna stay!”
For prompt: "Steve being kind of worried about people's reactions to stevetonybucky, but when he makes the announcement (or when they all find out) no one cares at all. (Tony may be a little offended that no one even raises an eyebrow.)"
Tony made a dismissive noise. “Your input is not necessary. Your presence, however, is invaluable.”
Steve felt like he should bow, something formal and distancing like that. He almost stepped away to do so, but then he realized how close they were. Pepper’s hair smelled like freesias. She sighed against his chest, and didn’t move. He could feel his heart pounding in his ears.
“Your wish is my command, Capsicle.”
“What year is it?”
“Well that sounds...highly inconvenient, if vague,” Tony offered. “Though maybe a good argument to keep me legally dead for a while.”
“You made a promise that I…?” Strange started, peering at him.
“Understood,” Steve nods. “I don’t—I don’t want to fight.”
“So, uh,” Bruce said, “I need to bring some stuff up from the basement, and the Hulk can’t fit through the door. Could you give me a hand, Steve?”
Now that there was no longer the imminent danger of Captain America’s entirely avoidable death, Tony braced himself for having to explain everything. Normally he loved explaining things, but.
He watched Cap—
A woman broke off from a group off to one side and walked over to Fury. She was dark-haired and high-cheeked, with a stubborn tilt to her chin, and even though everything else about her was nothing like Peggy, Steve felt his whole chest contract.
Pepper took Steve’s face in her hands, her gaze sharpening and then widening. “Steve, why are your eyes
“A lot,” she nodded, with a smirk. “Don’t tell him that, though. He’d never let anyone forget it.”
with them back. We all need to take care of communities first, ground level, and I have a little experience with that, so. Probably go and see where I can do the most good.”
“You girls gossiping? What about, do tell.”
point,
The next email was just an IP address. Steve saved it, and went on with his life. Or at least, what was counting for it, nowadays.
“We had something they didn’t.”
Steve meant what he said. He’s glad Tony’s still here.
Steve blinked at her. She was strikingly beautiful, slim but clearly well-muscled, with a shock of smooth, bright red hair that ended in a bob at her chin. She met his gaze evenly, eyebrows just slightly arched upwards, not quite a challenge, but close.
“Provided we actually can break cover,” Tony pointed out. “Fucking shoddy architecture. Who builds an evil lair without a sense of where to put load-bearing pillars?”
“It’s nice to meet you, Steve,” Tony says. “Now go. I’ll fix everything, you’ll have the most swag apartment in Brooklyn when I’m done.”
“Take care, Captain,” the Ancient One said.
The problem is, there’s no one to tell. No one
“I’ll get you a tablet when we reach New York. Electronic thing, holds the information of a million books in one slab of silicon,” he added, when Steve raised an eyebrow. “I’ll teach you how to use it before Fury gets hold of you. SHIELD will give you a sanitised version of the truth; or at least, a highly selective one, and I assume you don’t want that.”
Christ, Steve was definitely red now. “Well—I—not that I don’t, that is, but I just…you have the suit, and a phone that does all the things you want it to, and I just wanted to see what that was like when it was a place that you lived in. And I haven’t actually been out in the city much, besides going for runs, so I thought…?”
“Huh?” Steve blinked. Then blinked again. Squinted. “Did everything just get...really blue to you?”
Tony took an unsteady step back from the display on the coffee table, and lowered himself onto the couch. “So you are, Captain. And has it?”
), and so he had to keep them in his coat, or in a drawer. They would have looked more welcome sitting on his desk, waiting for him.
“I’ll take it,” he’d said, because he was pretty good at dodging knives, and seriously. This apartment was great, and a straight shot to work on the Q. That’s like a precious sparkly unicorn in this city.
“I don’t know what you
Steve swallowed. “The walk?” he echoed.
“That’s fine,” Fury had said, “So long as you allow medical to have a look at you.”
The song meandered back into a chorus, then a slow bridge that spiraled up and up before cresting and winding back down on the recapitulation, a mournful clarinet crying at the close. They slowed and then halted.
“Out of curiosity,” he asked carefully, “How’d she seem?”
Particularly when, the very next day, Hill forwarded him several tabloid headlines inquiring about the ‘new blonde in reformed warmonger Tony Stark’s life’.
“That saying is older than I am!” Bucky called back. He looked at Steve. “I’d say don’t do anything stupid, but frankly, you’ve already gone and done it. I’ve got no stupid to bring with me, because you’ve depleted the resource, you asshole.”
She nodded, regal and calm. He more or less ran away from her.
He just tried to be good. To do well by his host, do the work he was tasked with, and stay away from where he wasn't wanted or needed. It wasn’t too hard, and it didn’t require a fight. And it felt okay, for a while.
“Problem?” Carter said.
She gestured to a squashy leather chair. “Please, have a seat. I’m going to have to do a bit of digging, we had to put this on the back burner after the Snap.”
Steve didn’t say anything.
“Where are you, Cap?” Tony asks, suddenly realising that he’s lost visual. Five minutes until SHIELD support.
for you for a moment there.” She pointed at the Mind Stone in the case.
“Good,” Pepper said, straightening a bit. “I’ll have a look at your proposal, and let you know of any questions. Is that all right?”
Maybe sometime soon, when things were settled, and there wasn't a distant threat on the horizon, he’d show Tony one of the emails he’d never sent, one of the more important ones.
“I will!”
Bruce finished his work in three weeks; record time, all considered.
Tony waves dismissively. “Drama queen. JARVIS, I programmed you to be the epitome of understatement, have you misplaced your British sensibility? Because I can recalibrate it–”
“Fine.”
“Yeah,” Steve nodded. He became aware that his throat had gone all tight. He hadn’t talked about Bucky to anyone, not in this century. “I couldn’t reach him.” He took a breath, and then another. “I dream about that too, sometimes. But no matter what, on a train or in the water, it’s always cold.”
To: tstark@starkindustries.com
“This is the communal elevator,” Steve points out.
“Well, how about non-technical ones? Come on, JARVIS, it’s a damn glove.”
“It’s a maybe.” He could feel her receding, becoming hard and faceted. Then, glittering and remote: “Now don’t fuck it up. You’re running out of time.”
Steve keeps his eyes on the floor. Maybe it will swallow him if he wills it hard enough.
“Everyone.”
Pepper swallowed. “Bruce is helping her out with her short-wave radio. It’s keeping her pretty occupied. She’s already planning modifications.”
Rhodes handed him a beer. “I know it doesn’t do much for you, but.”
“Eye for your ass, more like,” Rhodes added. “Sorry, Cap, but it’s true.”
Tony watched him steadily. “Barnes,” he said. “He fell, just before you.”
Bucky breathes in plaster dust slowly. He’ll get them both out.
“Feed him, for god’s sake,” Pepper said, padding in from the porch with her laptop under one arm. “He hasn’t stopped since four this morning.”
“Pepper needs a dance partner to finish out this song, and I want to read this,” Tony said, and then his chin abruptly tipped down, as if he’d surprised himself. Maybe he had; Steve was plenty surprised.
Shards of light followed him down, down—
It wasn’t as if he had very much to lose.
The look of him lingered with Steve for a long while after that. Hadn’t ever faded, he was now realizing.
Steve turned, and felt himself smile involuntarily. “Hi, Tony. What brings you here?”
“You better be right, Banner. What’s the thing?
“Now? I’m on vacation. Gonna help Pepper with some paperwork, and probably just hang out for a while, keep her and the kid company. This house is gorgeous, but it’s far from civilization. Doesn’t seem right to make it lonelier than it already is.” Rhodes cut a glance at him. “You could stick around for a while too, you know. House is big enough, and eventually Bruce is gonna call you back.”
“What am I looking for?”
Oh wait.
Rhodes gave him a long look in the morning, but only suggested that Steve bring a phone with him next time. “In case the world needs saving,” he added, with a half smile.
“It was nice knowing you, Steve. Go home.”
“Where’d he go?” Pepper yelled, repulsors powering up.
“You won’t be. We’ll figure it out.”
For ashinan. JARVIS vs. the corporeal.
Because somehow, in the interval since things stopped exploding in Times Square, Tony and Steve have managed to sustain an argument through hazmat cleanup, debrief, and fucking
do, now that we know what to look for, is test the transport system.”
“Everyone back where they were, just how they were. The way they’re supposed to be.
“Well, sir, I’m contracted to get in touch when it looks like the mission’s been successful.”
Bruce huffed. “Yeah, well.”
“Of all the things that Tony Stark is,” Natasha said, smiling slightly, “Normal is not one of them.”
Tony eyed him. “No,” he said slowly.
Tony gave him a look. He was maybe a bit offended. “Why wouldn’t I?”
Tony looks at him, affronted. “You don’t know what you’re talking about, Rogers,” he says, waving the Starkphone in question around, “Monochrome is simple, it’s easy and readable, it’s–”
Steve felt his head turn as if from far away. “Sorry, Pep,” Tony said, the syllables clumsy in a mouth that didn’t belong to him, “If I’d known this was how things were going to shake out, I definitely would have given you a heads up, if only for the paperwork. Bringing people back from the dead is a logistical nightmare, believe me, I’d know. But like I said, it’s really good to see you.” He blinked hard. “He’s losing ground, we need to move fast.” He pulled up another file. “Ah, here we go. I just need to adjust some last parameters so I don’t blow us both to kingdom come. Give me five minutes.”
There’s a man in the lobby, standing out like a sore thumb among all the blue-shirts in an impeccable three-piece English suit. There is even a proper black umbrella hooked into the crook of his elbow.
When he had returned the Stones, he’d left the old gauntlet behind. It was sitting on a wire shelf, amid other half-disassembled things. He hovered over it for a second, and then cautiously slipped it on.
Natasha blinked, but her expression didn’t change. “No charge,” she said, after a long moment. “That one’s pretty easy to get. A lot of the stuff’s been un-redacted in the last decade or so. Though if you want a current address, you’ll have to jump through some hoops.”
Tony flinched; he couldn’t help it. “Buddy, you have no idea,” he said. “But in this case, I guess I’m sorry for just blurting everything out. Probably should be breaking everything to you gently or something. There’s probably regulations for this sort of thing. Then again, maybe not. I’m pretty sure there hasn’t been any other cases of resuscitation from cryogenic freezing out there, so. Yeah. Sorry about that.”
In the evening, after scouring Pepper’s notes and scrawling out as much material as he could muster, he went out to the garage again. Opened up the case and sat in front of it again.
Tony pecks him on the lips, a barely there, yet unmistakable gesture of intent. Steve shuts up abruptly.
“Never mind the house. Anyway, if you’re dead still, there’s no reason for me to move, it’ll only arouse suspicion. We keep things normal right up until we can’t.” Pepper thought for a moment. “Do you think Carol would take her, in an emergency? She’s been staying at Maria Rambeau’s for the last few weeks.”
“I think we’ll need to,” Helen chimed in, from behind her constantly shifting set of screens. “We’re running out of space, now that Tony’s gone full engineer.”
[Sent at 2:38 AM.]
“No,” Pepper replies, and has the passing thought that she should really be considered for sainthood, considering just how even her tone is in this moment, “Thank you, that won’t be necessary.”
“I…okay? Thanks?”
Steve poked at his phone. “This user interface isn’t particularly stable,” he remarked. Tony had shown him his phone on the ship, and it had been a
“We’ll give you clearance and an alias,” Fury supplied. “You won’t have to answer any awkward questions, I can guarantee that. And while I’d ask that you not leave the building, at least not yet, you’re free to go wherever your clearance level will allow you.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony said quietly.
For rachelgamage's prompt: "Teen Wolf (or any fandom) based off of Buffy Halloween episode where everyone turns into their costumes."
Something’s going on here,” Tony says over chinese takeout. They’ve all just basically moved into what’s left of the tower because seriously, what’s SHIELD’s damage?
They pulled it down on the front lawn, sparks flying, Steve with his gauntleted fist around its throat. “What do you want?” he asked.
“I keep telling you, I’m not the one who told you two to hang out,” Steve pointed out.
But that was all right. Steve made the very deliberate decision not to avoid either Tony or Pepper, and he stuck to it. Despite his complete inability to walk away from a fight, he’d been very good, over the years, at running away from non-fights. But this was too important to run from, he was pretty sure. It felt fragile and infinitely precious. And if he messed it up now, he’d never get another chance. They’d be kind, but they’d close ranks, and they’d be right to. So he needed to not run away.
By god, Stark Industries workers had better be unionized, or he and Tony were going to have
He shook his head, turning to try and follow her line of sight. Nothing. He said, “Steve misses you.”
“Off the record,” Bowers said, “I’d say keep him close, then. Men like him, if he’s anything like the stories tell, shouldn’t just disappear.”
Steve shook his head. He still had another test to endure.
Tony sat back in frustration, and then startled himself by trying to wipe a hand over his face and having it scrape unpleasantly, metal against metal.
“Colonel Rhodes, I presume?"
Tony smirked. “Yep. When I saw what Fury was giving you in the way of cultural briefing, I was kind of offended on both yours and Steve’s behalf, because seriously, Cap, all of your issues with the 21st century totally make sense now–”
He stared at her. “We’ve established this.”
Visions assailed Steve, oversaturated and otherworldly: the Avengers tower, but strange, covered in dust, the air sulfurous. Away, to Sokovia, then the stars, winking into nothing, one by one. A growing, pursuing hunger.
He had almost sworn he heard JARVIS huff. “I know how you work, sir. You begin from the inside and work outwards. I had organised my observations in that order.”
“I don’t know,” Tony says through gritted teeth.
“I thought about it,” he said finally. “And I knew that even if I shouldn’t, I wanted to all the same. But you were back here, and Sam was, and everyone else. And then Tony happened, and it all stopped mattering. What I thought I had wanted didn’t mean anything anymore.”

Tony jabbed a finger at him, charmed despite himself. “You’re funny. It’s weird. Captain America doesn’t get to be funny.”
The shimmer swung the sword twice, and
“I’ll be damned.” He stared at the readings. “Does this mean we can manipulate subatomic particles now?”
“Stupid soul seems to be made of taffy,” Tony muttered. “You’d think he
Tony seemed not to know what to do with that. When he did choose to engage, it was usually with pleasantries, nothing deeper than surface level, so Steve kept his peace, and waited.
“I wish for that too, but it hasn’t happened yet, and we don’t know, if it will…”
“Boy, Stark, you don’t disappoint…” the Captain spoke up, adjusting himself, as he walked over to the edge of the pool.  “Does this happen every time you get excited?”
“Huh? Yeah. Oh, I’m sorry…” Steve responded moving swiftly out of the cab.  “Zoned out for a second…”
“Nurses just came in to do his vitals. Nothing has changed.”
Someone came out of the shadows of an empty space in close proximity to the two men.  Someone who had been watching that entire moment happen with no reactions or movements.  Someone who unbeknownst to them would change the trajectory of their relationship for many years to come.
“Yeah, in my arm…”
“He’s not in a fucking coma, Pepper…” Natasha reminded the older woman.  “He’s in an unconscious state…”
The newly revealed Omega glared at the redhead crossly as she left.
Looking over at his cell phone, he saw the time on the screen light up:  5:00am.
The elevator pinged and the door opened swiftly.  The billionaire walked into the cab and stood against the wall.  He looked up at the younger man and wondered, “You coming?”
“Before I forget, Cap, thank you for this…” Tony stated softly, before taking a sip.  “Not just the wine; the food, the company, everything.  Thank you.”
“He’s gonna keep doing that, isn’t he?” Sam questioned aloud.
“Thought I could us some good karma for once in my life...”
“Mr. Stark… please…”
Every time he asked himself a question about that day and the mitigating circumstances around it, he would get the same answer:
’ he thought to himself. ‘
“Wishful thinking, so my friend wouldn’t get hurt…”
“You wanted to see them?”  The Captain questioned worriedly.
“You hungry?” The captain asked clearly.
“Thought you’d say that.  God, you’re so responsible…”
“Not always… well, maybe… sometimes… sometimes… okay, this was the first time,” Tony tried to explain.  “Please don’t hold this against me…”
{Chapter Two's title is "You Go To My Head" sung twice by Frank Sinatra (in 1947 & 1960). I heard it and it was perfect.  I posted some of the lyrics at the end of the chapter.  To hear the song in full, go to:
“Cap?  You home?”  Tony questioned aloud, as he traveled throughout the residence.
Hi, all!
Steve got up from his seat at the island and made his way around to where Tony was standing.
Hope you like where this story is going!
“Ugh, I hate you, J…” Tony growled as he sat up to a sitting position.  “And, yes, please pull them for me…”
Tony leaned closer to the Captain, laying his head against the man’s strong, broad chest.
“Jarvis is an A.I., Sam,” Steve replied promptly.  “And, I bet he has Jarvis watching all of his friends’ activities…”
“Hence the reason you asked me to come over after my appointment?”
Without warning, he dove down into the water, fully clothed, finding his way to the bottom, where the billionaire was at.
“A month?!  Awww, come on!”
“Morning…?” He responded, perplexed by where the sound was coming from.
And, with that, Tony sunk back down under the water, but he didn’t come up seconds later like he did before.  Steve continued to watch to see what the Omega was doing, but after a minute, then two minutes, he began to worry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, we do, Stark,” the captain responded, kissing his husband again.  “The best.”
“You are always welcome, sir...”
“I was with Steve tonight, so no,” the billionaire remarked.  “Cap?”
“I think that would be sensible…”
“Hacked?  Hacked?!  I think not, Legolas.  He’s fortified and protected by the best firewalls and systems, so that ain’t gonna happen.”
His very last memories were of Steve and the pool, and the water surrounding him.
“Fine, just fine” the billionaire said hastily, before changing the subject and walking towards the door.  “Let’s head out, Capsicle.”
“Damn it, fine!” The billionaire took a deep breath and answered quickly, “Islickedwhenyoumoanedandyousmeltmeandcameafterme, soIhadtosprayyoudownwithwater…”
The philanthropist sprayed the officer again; this time, the chilly liquid shocked him as it suddenly hit his face.
“For once…”
Before their ‘fight’, Tony thought they were happy.
“‘Someone threatening me’?!” Tony retorted with a chuckle.  “Happy?!  Really, Steve?! He would never threaten me! He’s just being protective!”
“Cancel the lock-down, and let Nat & Bruce up…”
“What?” The other two adults questioned back sharply, still frustrated by their current conversation.
“Yep, I think he hates to give up a good thing…”  The Black Widow responded.  “Kinda reminds me of Tony…”
“And, why’s that?”
Eyes like enchanting azure pools of ocean water…
“Then, get a new drink, and get him one…”
And leave us nothing but grief and pain,
“More like two…” Nat muttered, only to get a look from the doctor and others.  “What? It’s true.”
“Well, excuse me, Chef Rogers, but I don’t think I need to learn how to make pasta carbonara. I am half-Italian, and I ate it a lot growing up… with handmade pasta from my grandmother no less.”
The loud voice shocked the young man enough that he fell off the bed and onto the floor, covers and all, with a loud thud.
I could really use some suggestions about Steve & Tony's attitudes towards the whole situation.
A handsome alpha no less.
“Do you think your friend Dr. Banner would be able to figure this out?”
“Yeah, he’s here with me.  What’s going on?”
So, its my birthday today, so yay me!
"Thought maybe you wanted to be alone."
“Probably not.” Tony looked up at him, when Steve stepped up to him again, chuckling.
Steve chuckled. “Right. Let’s go. We’ll continue this when we’re back.”
Tony rolled his eyes, but let Steve continue. “So, I’m on the date with Lincoln who was really tall and nice, handsome and..”
That was also very Steve. Instead of asking why the hell Tony wanted to meet in front of a bar in the afternoon, his only problem with it was that it was raining. And oh well, now that he reminds Tony. But he couldn’t bring himself to care. Actually, wasn’t kissing in the rain considered romantic? Was that what he was going to do? Should he just march up to him and kiss him? Okay, so his plan wasn’t completely elaborate. He needed to consider what he wanted to do or say.
“Tiffany.. She’s..” Steve paused and seemed to retain himself from saying something impolite. “She’s very.. straight forward and hands on. She’s.. it’s horrible, Tony.”
“Are you serious? Just for the record, our whole relationship is based on a lie,” Steve chuckled. Sure, he had lied and Steve supposed Tony didn’t want his secret to be revealed, but Steve was way more amused than angry or mad. He smirked at Tony, who at least looked a little sheepish.
that was defintly the moment his brain lost the ability to form coherent sentences. Keeping a steady rhythm, Tony licked up his cock before sucking it back down again. Steve clenched his fist, trying to stop himself from thrusting up, from moving at all, but couldn’t help but to push one of his hands into Tony’s hair, gripping it tight without pushing or pulling. Low moans proceeded to escape his throat when Tony moved faster.
Tony peeked down at their entwined fingers before looking up at Steve again, a sheepish expression on his face.
“Cap, the world needs you,” he said, voice dead serious as if the earth was being attacked by aliens once again.
“Thank..you?” Steve gave him the same look as just a few moments ago before adding, “you too.” Was Steve a little flustered? That would probably be a good sign. Tony decided to keep going.
“The meeting was just as idle as the last four of them.”
Minutes after she had already left, Tony still stared in the direction where she just stood. When he finally snapped out of his trance, he shook his head in an attempt to clear his mind. What the hell? Did this really happen or was he maybe sleep deprived enough to have imagined the conversation? Nope, no way, he decided. No matter what state he was in, this was not something his brain could just make up, that much he knew. He groaned and grabbed his mug. Instead of sipping on it, he gulped down the already chilled beverage, hoping it would magically help him understand what was going on. Logically, Tony knew that not even coffee had
Laughing, Steve just shook his head. “I really don’t know. But she was under pressure.”
“Why would I?” He asked as innocently as possible with a fake frown on his face, making Steve chuckle.
“Why?”
“No it’s.. strangely, I’m not even, you know, opposed to that idea, to be honest.”
Instead of answering Tony only rolled his eyes, raising his glass so that anyone could bring him another scotch. What had he done? That was not how this was supposed to go. He would need to find a way to turn this whole thing around.
When he entered the café, Steve instantly jumped out of his chair. He had been sitting as far away from Tiffany as possible and seemed to have counted the seconds to Tony’s arrival.
Steve feared he might start hyperventilating or worse actually leave. He gently took hold of his upper arms. "I'm not seeing anyone, Tony," he quietly told him. "And on the contrary, I'd very much like you to stay."
“Being a genius?” Steve prompted.
The following days were like every other day in Avenger Tower. Even though Steve would have prefered to have a few days to himself and not run into Tony, he made sure to not deliberately ignore him. The last thing he needed was anyone noticing that something was up. Not that long ago it was normality, but the team wasn’t used to Steve and Tony
“Yeah, I guess. But what does that have to do with anything?” Steve knitted the eyebrows, he had no clue where Bucky was going with this.
“You know, you’re looking really good tonight, Rogers.” Tony was serious, but he couldn’t keep the flirty tone out of his voice. He had a mission after all.
Tony supposed he had looked like a kicked puppy because Steve reached out for his hands, squeezing them in order to comfort him.
It was a Friday evening when Steve, later than usual, made his way back to the tower.
“I.. He.. What? Did.. did he tell you?” Still processing what he just heard, Tony wasn’t able to form coherent sentences.
It was the first time they really shared a lingering, chaste kiss without any kind of urgency or intention to take it further. It was soft and sweet and in a way it was their first
“So, you don’t mind the thunderstorm?” Steve tried to keep his voice neutral.
Now it was Steve’s turn to sound not amused. He probably tried to go for a warning tone and look, but his confusion was still written all over his face, so Tony decided to leave it at that.
When he reached the tree, Steve positioned Tony right in front of it before stepping around the tree to take the backside. He raised his arms to put them around the trunk, but when he tried to pull his hand from Tony’s, he didn’t let go. Glad that the tree was between them so Tony wouldn’t see him, Steve’s cheeks heated. He cleared his throat.
“Oh come on. You’re seriously the stupidest genius ever. Your brain really can’t come up with a single reason why Steve doesn't wanna be friends with benefits anymore?”
Tony bolted upright. Did he just kinda think about him dating Steve? Sure, Tony wasn’t blind, Steve was good looking. He was easy to be around and Tony liked spending time with him, they weren’t friends for no reason. And maybe Tony even caught himself thinking it was cute how Steve didn’t get references or was irritated by 21st century things. But Tony guessed he was just too invested in Steve’s dating life right now and that’s where those thoughts had come from. That must be it.
“Sure.”
of the elevator that indicated that Steve had reached the penthouse. Unsure what to do Tony hurried over to the counter and leaned against it, hoping to appear nonchalant and not as anxious as he actually felt.
Only a few minutes after he started working on his project again, he was interrupted by a knock. Since he had left the door open, it could only be Steve. He came down there quite often, lounging on the small couch, keeping Tony awake during all-nighters and company during the days. But he never just entered the room, he always knocked. No matter how many times Tony had told him to just come in.
“You’re a good man. You helped save so many people, without you we couldn’t have done it at times. But more than that you’re a role model to the younger Avengers, you make boring meetings fun. Actually you’re what’s holding the team together. They miss you.. I miss you. Don’t you want to come back to.. us?”
“Wanna go upstairs - ” “We need to talk - ” they both started talking at the same time.
“Hey,” he softly greeted him.
When his phone beeped Tony jumped, too lost in thought to expect any sound. Steve had massaged him
Tony hummed and after a brief pause he added, “you know what always helps with a good night's sleep? Orgasms.”
The friction of their skin rubbing against each other was overwhelming, almost too much, but not enough at the same time. No matter how much skin Tony touched, it wasn’t enough, he needed more. Clutching his waist, Tony turned them until they were lying next to each other, faces only inches apart. He slid his hand over his hip until he reached his destination. When he gripped his dick and started stroking him, Steve moaned with pleasure. He brought his hand to the back of Tony’s head to pull him into another kiss while his other hand moved to grab his erection, causing him to moan into Steve’s mouth.
When Tony arrived in the lobby, Steve was already waiting for him and
“What do you mean?” She asked, brows drawn together, confusion written in her face.
At first he had always checked if nobody was around to see him, he would never live down the teasing from the team, but he quickly learned that nobody seemed to go on walks out here. It was just him and if he was honest, he was glad about it because -
Tony practically beamed, he had never been fond of reporters but right now he couldn’t care less. On the contrary.
When his third attempt at making Natasha’s widow bites -as she repeatedly told him they’re called instead of ‘taser thingy’- stop blanking out whenever there was a certain kind or radio signal, failed, Tony groaned and decided it was time for coffee once again. Maybe the way he just wasn’t making any progress with the project was what bothered him so much, he had always hated it when things didn’t go as planned.
“Thanks.” On impulse Steve hugged him before making his way to the tower.
When Steve entered the room Tony was glad to see that he seemed to be just as nervous. He probably tried not to let it show, his posture upright and imposing as ever, but his steps were tentative. After a glance at Tony, he averted his eyes, fixing a spot to Tony’s right.
“Yeah, it’s known to have positive effects on your health.”
oversharing. Do you want me to.. uh leave? To.. you know.."
When silence filled the room and Steve didn't seem to say anything, Tony asked, "uuhm.. was that oversharing again?"
If only he knew, Tony thought but just started walking towards the general direction of the garage. He had yet to decide which car they would take. Right now the best choice would be a van with one of them in the driver’s seat and the other one in the back, as far away as possible. Unfortunately Tony only owned sports cars.
“Don’t you think it’s kinda unfair to lead them down the garden path?”
This time Tony only groaned. Rolling his eyes, he pulled Steve in for another brief kiss.
“Well, alright. I’ll be happy to not owe you any longer.” Steve offered him a little smile before he took a bite from his sandwich.
“Of course they are.” Steve kissed the tip of Tony’s nose. “And they’re beautiful, too.”
“I don't know? We don't really have the best record? We usually can’t get five minutes without fighting? One normally doesn't.. Do stuff like that with his teammates? A thousand reasons, actually." Steve snorted amused. Now that he thought about it, he could come up with a few reasons. Not that he had spent much time thinking about it until a few minutes ago. Sure, he would lie if he said he never noticed how attractive Tony was. Not only external, but also his personality, even though Steve would also lie if he said he never found himself checking out his perky butt.
It took Steve everything not to look away, not to just leave but to wait for an answer.
three words.
Steve looked down at Tony’s hand and cleared his throat. “Uhm, thank you,” he said, mirroring the movement, awkwardly patting Tony on the back.
“But..” “Nuh-uh, I’m talking now.”
uncomfortable?” Tony made sure to stress the pronouns so there wouldn’t be a misunderstanding. There were only three options, either he heard it wrong, Natasha misspoke herself or.. Nope, Tony wouldn’t go there yet. Not before he knew for sure.
“Yeah, she’s from accounting and she has way more than ‘a lip piercing’. In fact she has eight piercings and about fifteen tattoos, she somehow lost count. She was very happy to share.”
Taking a few more steps back, his voice cold as ice, Tony said, “do what you have to do.”
When Steve looked up, his eyes were a little wider than usual, he probably didn’t expect Tony to talk about Bucky. At least not in a nice way.
“Don’t.. don’t get this wrong. It’s just.. I suppose it’s an Army thing. When there’s just you and your comrades for months, it’s nice to..,” he trailed off.
“Remember those taser thingies Natasha liked to use? Before they, you know, malfunctioned, at least. A few days ago I came up with an idea how to- Steve?” He interrupted his own jabbering, looking at Steve, brows furrowed with concern. “You okay?”
“Steve Rogers, are you asking me to be your boyfriend?” Tony teased softly, but Steve just moved his free hand to cup Tony’s cheek. “I’d like that very much,” he whispered, lowering his eyes to Tony’s lips before asking, “may I?”
“You, too,” Steve answered just as quietly. And he meant it, he had really missed Tony even if it had been only a few days. He wasn’t sure if Tony had avoided him or if he just had been busy. When he worked on important projects he still tended to spend several days in his workshop, even though JARVIS now usually made sure that he ate and slept enough.
“You can just jerk me off.. If that’s okay for you,”
“Let me guess, Frozen didn’t beat Beauty and the Beast, right?” Steve startled a little when Tony’s voice interrupted his meditation. Looking around, he noticed that everyone else had already left, before his gaze landed on Tony. He was smirking a little and Steve couldn’t help but mimic the smile.
It was far from fair play and initially he wanted to keep this favor until he would really need it, but he knew Steve wouldn’t ask another question if he brought this up. And to be honest, he really wanted him to agree to his plan. Tiffany had been one of those ladies Natasha had tried to set Steve up with. And to say the date was horrible was a huge understatement. It took about ten minutes until Steve had called Tony and basically begged him to get him out of there. So he had, but not without mentioning that he owed him of course.
“I’m telling you..” “Oh my god, are you serious right now?” Tony interrupted her again, knowing that slowly but surely he brought her to the end of her tether, but he just couldn't care.
It wasn’t easy for Tony to not just say what he wanted to say, but he felt like it was necessary to ask about Bucky first. He was important to Steve and Tony thought it would help him understand that Tony was serious about what they had. Besides he needed to hear that he was fine, because otherwise Steve wouldn’t be either.
“Liked what?”
Decision made, he took the phone and sent a text to the only saved number ‘
Others were too fancy, smart but appeared to be know-it-all or just seemed to try too hard. At the end there were only two options left and Tony still wasn't happy with the choice.
body part. Nobody, absolutely nobody would say their penis is
Steve, always the knight in shining armour even though, technically, they weren’t even speaking right now.
"Who programmed your manners? For sure it couldn't have been Tony."
"It's no secret that I don't sleep much, but I know for a fact that the same goes for you. I sometimes hear you in the kitchen on my nightly strolls."
Tony watched him for a moment before he got rid of his own shoes and pants and crawled onto the bed and on top of Steve. He braced his elbows on either side of his head, leaning down for another kiss, opening Steve’s lips with his tongue. His tongue darted out, meeting Tony’s halfway, his hands moving up and down Tony’s back. They stayed like this for a few minutes, licking and nibbling at their lips until Tony broke the kiss, shifting back until he sat on Steve’s shins. He leaned forward and bit the skin just above the waistband of his boxers before he tugged at them. Steve lifted his hips, letting Tony pull them down to his knees. He was hard already and Tony enjoyed the sight for a moment, even though he was trying not to stare. He slowly licked along the length of Steve’s cock from base to top, causing Steve to pant for air. Tony watched him. “Want me to go slow?”
“Oh fuck. So.. he’s.. he.. he might have feelings for me.”
Looking at the screen Tony pondered for a few seconds if he should read the message or not. Was Steve texting him good news or rather bad news? He wasn’t sure. After a few painfully long seconds he finally opened the text, which just said ‘Staying at Tasha’s tonight’. Well. That hurt more than Tony wanted to admit, even to himself. Given the text and knowing how stubborn Steve could be, he had only texted him, because Natasha insisted. And wow, he never thought they could have
how to be rude, but you could tell how bad he wanted to get away from her by the way he didn’t take his time to apologize adequately.
"Anyway, we said we'd always tell each other the truth and that's why I'm here..," Steve trailed off, not quite ready to say more yet.
Steve gripped the back of Tony’s head and pressed their lips together again, before he laid down on the bed.
“Contrary to popular belief, not the journey is the reward, but the reward. And it was definitely worth it.”
it real. And there was the problem. Even if it had felt at least kind of genuine for Steve, for Tony it sure as hell didn’t. Which was the exact reason he really should put a stop to whatever they were doing, because there was no way Tony would want anything more from him than some fast sexual relief and Steve was only getting hurt more the longer he would continue this.
“Yeah, sure,” he told him while Steve just slightly shook his head. He was probably already fed up with Tony and the way he acted, but there was no way to let that opportunity slip. He took Steve’s plate and placed it, together with his own, on the buffet table.
Natasha smiled at him one last time and walked away. Before she could leave, Tony called after her, “hey Natasha? Uhm, thank you.”
Narrowing his eyes, Steve tried to follow, until he finally realized what he was talking about. "It's not about that. I didn't mind what you said the other day. I knew you didn't mean it. It's okay."
Steve groaned and caught a glimpse of Tony’s smug smile right before he turned them around until Tony was crowded between his body and the wall. When Steve thrust his hips forward he found Tony was half-hard already and he couldn’t suppress the moan forming in his throat.
“Tony,” Steve cut him off before he could ramble on. “Come on in, you’re dripping wet.”
“Should we get the check?”
Everything kind of fell into place again and even though he noticed the effort the team put in to distract him, he was thankful. The way Sam joined him on his runs, Natasha made sassy comments whenever he used 40’s slang or Bruce told him about some phenomena he read about, made him forget about
Tony had to suppress the urge to snort at Steve calling him a good man, but that wasn’t the point right now. He still couldn’t deny that hearing Steve’s words, hearing that he apparently appreciated him made his anger die down a little.
“None taken, I wouldn’t want you anyway.” Bucky smirked at him. “But I think you should talk about this. Just tell him what you told me.”
“Yeah, maybe I finally found someone to accompany me on museum visits, since all of you are philistines.”
“What are we watching?”
Steve winked at him. “No, it doesn't.”
"Steve, come one," Tony interrupted. "I told you I was sorry, I didn't mean it."
“Tony and I had a fight..,” Steve trailed off. He considered how he could tell Bucky what had happened without it sounding like it was his fault. He knew that Tony wasn’t too fond of him, but Steve didn’t want him to feel guilty.
A little surprised, Steve made an affirmative noise. Who would’ve thought? Of course Tony had to have a lot on his mind, he was a genius after all. But Steve had wondered if all those hours he worked were at least partly to distract him from his thoughts. But then again you couldn’t run forever, not from yourself or your own thoughts.
Technically Tony shouldn’t even wonder that she knew, it was kind of in her job description, but then again it had happened only a few times and he didn’t think anyone would pay enough attention to notice. Or did Steve.. unlikely. Tony just couldn’t imagine Steve casually telling Natasha about them fucking.
Steve grimaced. “I know, Tony. I know and I’m sorry. I was wrong. I just couldn’t.. I was so scared that you would get hurt. This was never about trust or the decisions you made.”
Tony took a deep breath, getting ready for what he was about to tell him.
Tony’s thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of his phone. As soon as he answered, not even waiting for a greeting, Natasha started to speak, “everything worked perfectly. Steve still thinks Happy is driving him to some kind of interview. When they’re on 59th Street and 6th Avenue Happy will kick him out and tell him to walk to the Pond, where he’ll find you. ETA about five minutes.”
Turning around, Steve watched Tony for a few moments. “What’s with the matchmaking? Since when do you care so much about my love life?”
“I just thought you could spend more time together without being away from me too much. It’s actually rather selfish and I’d understand if..”
Steve watched him closely as he entered. “What, no pet name this time?”
“Yeah, figured,” Tony snorted.
While the first two chapters were from Steve's POV, this one will be from Tony's. But I guess you would've figured this out real quick :D
Of course finding out about those few dates hadn’t satisfied Tony the slightest and he had kept on bugging Steve about it. About a week ago he had started suggesting different women they knew that could be interested in Steve. Just like he did with Shannon and Kirsten right now.
“But you’re my best friend and I’ve told him a thousand times. Why would he think something like this?”
Tony stared at the letter, trying to process what he just read. His look went to the phone that had accompanied it and back to the letter. Pinching the bridge of his nose, he let the paper fall on the desk, only to reach for it again only a few seconds later. He read the words again and again without seeming to understand the meaning of them. Finally he decided to let the letter be and got up to make his way to the workshop, but not without pocketing the phone first. Maybe his latest project would be able to get his mind off of the words whirring through his head.
Surprised by the sudden movement and noise, Steve jumped a little. “Gosh, Tony. Give a guy a warning.”
Half an hour later, laying on his bed, he was still nowhere near sleepy. Even then his lips still seemed to tingle from Tony’s kisses. He had been almost a little surprised that he had kissed him in the first place. Sure, there had been other kisses before, but those happened rather impulsive, not as intentional and nearly affectionate. Nevertheless, there was no way he could deny that he had liked it. Tony’s soft lips caressing his own, his tongue licking in and around his mouth and.. other parts. Steve still blushed at the thought, now that the adrenaline had worn off. Closing his eyes he pinched the bridge of his nose. This is really not how he should be feeling.
“I could.. give you a hand.”
When Tony turned around, he was proven right. Steve leaned in the doorframe, a half eaten sandwich in his hand, but otherwise still looking the same with those sweatpants that were just tight enough to show off his perfect ass and Tony didn’t want to get started on that t-shirt again. He had probably just returned from the gym. As if he would need to build more muscle, some day his shirts would just rip apart.
“Yeah, you know, when you’re surrounded by the same men for way too long. It was probably a stupid thing to say, sorry.”
Considering just going to the gym, ignoring all of this for one last time, he made a decision and finally got into the elevator. As soon as the door closed, JARVIS welcomed him. "Good evening Captain Rogers. It's good to see you."
“Yeah, sure.. so?”
There was silence for a few moments in which Tony probably considered his words. "You might have a point there.. So what're we gonna do instead?"
Steve chuckled but decided to ignore the question. Instead he put his hands on Tony’s thighs while he leaned down to kiss him again.
When they parted, Steve still smiled at him. “Oh Tony? One more thing, don’t slap my ass while everybody is watching.”
“Mm.” She tucked a stray bit of hair behind Morgan’s ear. Morgan squirmed, so Pepper set her down, and watched as she wandered down the steps towards where Bruce and Clint appeared to be napping beneath one of the larger oak trees. “He wanted his people close. Though I’m not nearly so generous as he was, I’m beginning to understand the impulse. And there are some who could probably use it more than others.”
“This boat has been sealed,” Fury said. “You are no longer authorised on the premises.”
Captain America was alive, he was coming to, and Fury was letting
For RCMcLachlan's prompt: "civil war averted"
“So you’re having nightmares. And…you have been, without telling me, for more than a month.” Dr. Feranza said. He pinched the bridge of his nose. Then he exhaled, and nodded at Steve. “That’s normal, these things take time.”
Bruce cleared his throat.
“Two,” Sam continues, “You talk. Maybe you work something out, maybe you don’t. But at least you’ll know why Stark’s doing what he’s doing. You might not agree with it, but better to know than not.”
“And you didn’t point this out earlier because…?”
I’m glad it was you.
Standing in the vicinity of the gauntlet felt like being bent around an event horizon. Steve couldn’t imagine touching it, let alone wearing it now. It wasn’t like this before; Thanos had worn it like he was wielding a hammer, something stable and knowable. Bruce had worn it like it was a nuclear bomb, exploding slowly and inevitably.
“Neither do I,” Fury replied. “Yet.”
No one could seem to say anything back. Rhodes managed a wave.
Bruce shrugged. “You don’t have to be here if you don’t want to be. I can just call you when we’re ready.”
“Holding steady,” Pepper said, rallying. “We’re deploying a lot of support to post-Snap restoration organizations, which is depleting some of our general capital, but we’re making enough with new sales and reinstatements to keep the lights on.”
When he didn’t, when there were bad days, he wondered a bit what it would be like to do something selfish, that he wasn’t sure was right for everyone, but might be right for
Steve stills. Tony outright freezes. “You have no evidence,” he hisses.
But he’s exhausted and he’s hurting and the adrenaline is draining out of him so he almost doesn’t hear it when Clint turns to Tony and says, “The hell were you gonna do if you got stuck on the other side of the universe, Stark?”
He wondered if this was how Pepper felt all the time.
“Bribes,” Clint nods. “Hefty ones.”
“We need the room,” Tony says. “Please?”
“Sounds good.”
“He’s eaten a whole one, hasn’t he?” Tony says, smirking.
Bucky followed, his smile a little searching. “You know where you’re headed, punk?”
“Yep.” He closed his eyes again. Nestled further in against the trunk of the tree. “You know he’s gonna be the one taking the trip.” He could stay here for a while yet, until Laura came and got him. Hopefully by then the emptiness wouldn’t howl quite so loud inside of him. Bittersweetness could taste worse than tragedy, sometimes.
Tony bared his teeth. “Thanks. Appreciate it.”
“Mom said. Dad always said you weren’t, but then she told him he was lying, and that the more he lied the more true it was.”
“It’s gonna be fine,” Steve rasps, his gaze gone soft even while glazed with pain.
Tony whistled low. “I had a feeling, but.”
“You’re the landlord?” Steve splutters.
The Ancient One raised an eyebrow.
“How long’s it been?”
When she noticed him, it was with only vague surprise. The line of her lips curved up.
“Well, there are deffo a lot of scientists working on it, I mean, that’s what CERN is for, right?” Darcy says. “You wanna switch specialties, go hang out with them for a while? If so, I'mma need a heads up, because I’m pretty sure Ian and I are gonna need to find us some other work in that case.”
“How much time?”
“Don’t know what that is, don’t care,” Tony said, settling himself on the thing’s legs.
But then Fury happened, and all the rest of his fellow fuckups happened (he supposes Natasha isn’t a fuckup really, but she’s definitely the exception that proves) and then they were in New York,
Steve pointed at him, narrowing his eyes. “That was not my fault. That was all on Archie.”
“Hi,” Steve said weakly. “Hi, Peggy.”
“Tony!”
“Goddamn it, Stark,” Fury snapped.
just an empty suit right now, except for maybe some electron patterns, which...yeah. Not really enough foundation for a human person, generally speaking.
"It’s stuck on the dark world or whatever though, right?” Darcy says, after a second. “Thor said it was taken care of.”
Steve smiles at her, “Morning, Miss Potts. I’m fine, thank you.”

Steve flushed, very slightly. “Um.”
Deep in the guts of Mark XIV, he heard his private cell phone ring. He ducked out of the armor and squinted. “Time, JARVIS?”

“Much more recently than you,” she said, waving a hand around. “You know I have no patience for superheroes. He’s just been trying really hard lately, to pay attention and learn, and he’s been
He went on a long run around the lake, trying not to think about anything but the taste of the air and the path in front of him, and then instead of heading inside afterwards, found himself wandering the property and ending up at the garage.
He nodded. “Steve’s been staying there. I think he’s been helping out around the house?” There wasn’t a lot of bleed over from Steve on that, but there was some and it seemed...
her, the energy she trailed, like tight-coiled atmosphere before a lightning strike. It took some effort not to flinch away.
She regarded him with eyes unbearably like her dad’s. “Mom asked me to ask you if you wanted to stay here tonight.”
“Our dark matter?” Darcy prompts, “Or the,” she wiggles her fingers eloquently, “
It was a lot harder to be on the outside of a process like this than the subject, he was realizing. Tony had the same hopeful conviction Steve remembered having before stepping into Howard’s Vita-Ray machine.

“Cuz that hasn’t bitten us on the ass before, right?” Darcy says dryly.
all him on his own, no one got to take that—
“No,” Tony agrees, meeting his eyes for the first time. “Not at this point. But there should be laws in place that will make it harder, not just for me, but for all of us, to fuck up. Because I know I’m the merchant of death, but you’re not fallible either, Cap, and neither is Natasha, and neither is your friend.” He makes a considering look at the ceiling. “Sam, on the other hand, possibly infallible. He is almost inhumanly even-keeled, especially for a guy who likes flying around on actual metal wings.”
“Chop chop. That shit’s a temptation we don’t want around here any longer than we have to.” Clint could feel Bruce peering at him, so he finally opened his eyes and looked back, then jerked his head in the direction of the house.
Layers upon layers of clear glass displays, glowing with files and video and reports on covert ops.
“If it’s too good, we may have to keep you on,” she warned. “I don’t cook as a matter of both skill and principle.”
He hears Steve exhale on an
“Rude,” Barnes muttered.
“Huh. I like it. Come here.”
“Tony!” Steve leans forward. “Taking you out of the picture isn’t going to fix anything.”
“Noted.”
“He made that much clear. His reasoning isn’t totally flawed,” Steve admitted.
“You and I have very different ideas of what constitutes ‘had to’,” Bucky commented. “For Stark? Really?”
“I think that the mistakes you made were forgivable, in intent if not necessarily in result. I’m not sure if you could say the same for me.” Steve exhaled hard.
“What?” Tony asks, resting his chin on Bucky’s shoulder. “You want in on this, Barnes? Because I, for one, would not say no.”
hadn’t just been the fact of a warm body. Hugs and handshakes from other people weren’t like that.
Steve cast around. “What parts of you are missing?”
Startled, Steve laughed.
“No,” Tony agreed. “They shouldn’t.”
Steve
“An in-case-of-supermodels thing, or an in-case-of-international-incident thing?”
“Sure. Thanks. I’m just going to,” Steve gestured at his sweat-soaked t-shirt, the general dusty state of himself. “I’ll be down in a few minutes.”
“Wait!” Helen shouted, throwing out a hand, “It should be working!” She typed frantically. “It just—oh my god. Tony, the molecular binding.“
“It’s okay,” he said, in a voice he didn’t fully recognize. “We’re okay.”
they broke up for good.”
She managed to smile. “And I’m glad he brought you back to me.”
“I would really like a shower,” Natasha says decisively.
She tilted her head. “What file?”

“God,
She gave him an odd look. “No, why would we do that? No sign of frostbite, some buildup of fluid in the large joints but those are draining--”
She regarded him. “It worked?”
“Good morning, Morgan.”
“It’s not really my style?”
That, in particular, had made for some
“Say yes to what?”
“Tony?”
The back door to the house slammed open. At the sound, Steve roused himself, but he couldn’t seem to find the earth under his feet. “Hey, Pep. Wow. It’s really, really good to see you.”
And that was as loaded a tone as Steve had ever heard, so he’d let it go.
“I’ll take that as a no. Cap, you’re gonna need to be more specific.”
"Trying to sleep would be a good start, maybe?"
“We need to talk.” With that Steve grabbed Tony’s arm and dragged him to the back of the room. They walked through a few aisles without saying anything. Steve looked around from time to time, probably searching for an unoccupied spot. After a few more turns, Steve opened a door that read ‘storage room’ and basically pushed Tony inside.
“Cheers,” Steve repeated. “Should we find a table? I picked up that the speeches are about to start.”
, was just plain stupid and therefor wrong, of course. The next person took some time to think, before cautiously deciding to go with
It wasn’t that he didn’t like Shannon for example. After Natasha had tried to talk him into asking her out months ago, he had almost agreed. But if he was honest he was glad that now that she was exposed as a SHIELD agent, she was off the table and he didn’t have to go out with her. He didn’t think they’d work out. Same would probably go for Kirsten even though he didn’t even know who exactly she was. It wasn’t even about them in particular, it was rather about Steve who felt like he wouldn’t be able to open up to someone and he wasn’t even sure if he wanted to have a partner. Him being Captain America would get in the way sooner or later, he was sure about that. He had even deliberated over the different possibilities
“Hey babe, sorry I’m late,” Tony greeted Steve as soon as he stepped out of the elevator. He was sitting on the counter, already waiting for Tony. He rarely left the penthouse these days and it’s been weeks since he last spent a night at his own quarter. After they had started dating a few months back, Tony slowly but surely made sure that Steve made himself at home in his flat. He liked waking up next to him, coming back from conferences to find him waiting for him or Steve coming down to the workshop to keep him company. Tony just liked having him around as often as possible. The transition wasn’t too easy at first, it took Tony some time to accept that he had actual feelings for someone. He had been quite confused by the desire to be with Steve all the time, especially when he discovered how nice being domestic with someone could be. But they had worked through it, because what they had was serious. Both of them were sure of it, even though it was still relatively new. In spite of that they still tried to work on their communication, let alone saying
“Steve, you don’t have to..” But he was interrupted again “I know, but I want to.” His voice was rough, but steady. He seemed to be sure.
But apparently Steve had other plans, because this time he was the one that did kill the mood. “Ready for breakfast?”
for a few hours a day.
Steve just rolled his eyes and made his way to the kitchen, he really needed coffee. Preferably black, because Tony would probably go on for hours, just like he had done for the past weeks.
“Sounds perfect, actually,” he heard himself say before even really thinking about it and a second later he was already being pulled up from the couch.
on his way.
It took some time but they built this beautiful, strong friendship. Everything that had once stood between them made their bond even stronger and Steve loved not only Tony as a person, but also the companionship they had.
He forced himself to look away, he wanted to save at least a little bit of his dignity. He stood up and took his empty plate, but before leaving for the kitchen he gently stroked Steve’s hair with his free hand and
“Oh come on, even you must have noticed how I sometimes stare at you. I used this whole rumors thing as an excuse to shamelessly watch and touch you. And I liked it, Steve. That’s what’s up.”
“Ms. Romanoff has a message to deliver and I quote ‘I’m sorry to interrupt, but get your asses down here, we have a mission. Oh and since both of you didn’t attend breakfast I guess congratulations are in order.’”
“Did we really just take the car for like 5 blocks? We could’ve walked, Tony,” he sounded a little accusing.
hand caused a well known warmth to rise in his body. Going by his ragged breath Tony was just the same. He thrusted up his hips and came only a few seconds later. Steve almost expected him to loosen his grip, but he kept on stroking, making Steve follow only moments later.
“No, I actually like it. Why would I..,” Tony trailed off, slowly turning his head to look at Steve who was simply giving him a very pointed look. “Oh..”
“How about both?”
Tony made his way over to the coffee machine, putting his hand in the small of Steve’s back as he came to stand next to him.
Opening his eyes, he glanced at the alarm clock on his night stand, 22:19. Maybe an evening run would help him clear his mind.
No matter what he thought he would find, he would never have guessed this. Steve blinked as if to check if the image in front of him would disappear. It didn't. Tony was standing in front of him, his sweater soaking wet from the rain, his hair hanging into his face and his expression kind of wretched. And still Steve wasn’t sure if he was really awake, if this was real. But before he could continue to rack his brains, Tony started talking. “Steve, I.. I’m sorry, I..”
There was a pause and when Tony didn’t answer, Natasha added, “it’s gonna work, Tony. Trust me.”
Steve laughed a little at Tony’s curiosity and made his way over to the small couch. His steps deliberately slow just to tease the other man. The sound of chair casters scraping on the floor indicated that Tony was impatiently shuffling around on his chair and Steve somehow enjoyed keeping him in suspense. When he sat down, Tony just about stared at him, still waiting for an answer.
Groaning, Steve was about to snap at him, but Tony held up his hands. “I’m just.. interested.”
Gripping his shoulders, Tony turned him a little, navigating him further into the workshop and even though Steve didn’t fully understand what he was up to, he was happy to play along. Anything as long as Tony’s lips wouldn’t leave his own. He grunted, discontent, when just in that moment Tony broke the kiss to breathe. He didn’t move far though and made his way to Steve’s jaw until he was sucking on his neck, causing Steve to let out another sound. A much more pleased one, this time.
Tony had to close his eyes. He could try and tell himself that Steve was lying, but Steve didn’t lie and his voice clearly gave away that he was telling the truth. That was the confirmation Tony had wanted but still was scared of. Brushing his free hand through his hair he exhaled audible.
After they had made it through another equally as boring speech, the worst part was over. Another drink might have been the only reason Tony survived.
Steve turned around, just watching Tony for a few seconds without saying anything. The look on his face didn’t reveal what he was thinking or feeling and it made Tony’s stomach turn to not see the usual smile on Steve’s lips. So much for him not being mad.
“Well, I’m not drunk, but this is what you wanted, right?”
“Well, did it work?” Tony asked once Steve let go of his lips.
“You wish what?” Tony interrupted him harshly. “You know what I wish? That you’d rather spend time with your boyfriend than someone else.”
Steve slowly entered the balcony, his steps rather hesitant. Apparently he also wasn’t sure where they stood.
Tony knew better than to keep his hope up, but his heart still skipped a beat at the beginning of Steve’s sentence. But he really wanted to stop and unfortunately Tony was out of ideas to convince him.
. Not that he had spent too much time thinking about it for several reasons. Mostly because he had never been sure if they were friends or still enemies or probably both depending on the situation. But also because no matter what he would feel for Steve, he would never reciprocate. At least that’s what he thought. After reading the letter again and again he wasn’t so sure anymore. Maybe Tony just read something into it that wasn’t there, but somehow it didn’t feel like he was imagining it.
“We've been talking about jerking off for the past 10 minutes, of course I'm hard. But fuck, that feels good.”
“I’m still not over the fact that you know about this and that we’re actually
“It’s not? And here I was getting my hopes up.” His voice was steady, his gaze fixed on Steve, he was sure of this.
Steve chuckled. “Yeah, like forever.”
“I’m really glad that you’re okay.”
When they broke apart, Steve planted kisses along Tony’s jaw until he reached his ear and stopped to nibble at his lobe. In a swift move, Steve turned them and crowded Tony between the wall and himself, before he kissed his jaw once more. When he reached the spot behind his ear, Tony moaned softly, causing Steve to fondly smile at him even though Tony couldn’t see because his eyes were closed, his head leaned back against the wall. Once Steve continued gently biting Tony’s neck, he raised his hands to loosely hug Steve, his fingers slowly tracing up and down his back.
When Tony pushed his tongue into his mouth, Steve lowered his body until he was firmly pressed into Tony. Shifting ever so slightly, he rolled his hips forward, causing both of them to break the kiss, groaning. And for the first time they acknowledged that they’d been half-hard the whole time. Steve instantly brought his lips back to Tony’s, kissing him a little more passionate, but still savouring. Tony buried his hands in Steve’s hair before he let one of his hands wander until it reached his ass. Grabbing his cheek, he pulled him down even further. Steve closed his eyes and let his head fall back as another guttural noise escaped his lips. He slowly started to move his body, rolling his hips forward again and again. Their growing erections perfectly lined up, brushing together with every thrust. Moaning, Tony’s hands started to move again, trying to cover as much skin as possible, while Steve went back to nibbling at his neck without stopping the movement of his hips.
“Thank you, Buck.” He pulled him into another hug. “You’re okay, yeah?”
“Oh come on, we’re just having some fun,” Tony tried to convince him. After he had a taste of what it was like to be like this around Steve, he wasn’t ready to give this up just yet. At least not without a fight.
“Yup, he does. Seriously? You’re such idiots, you know that?” she laughed and shook her head at him, the fond smile growing even wider.
“I read Natasha’s text earlier, so I’m guessing this is what you want. Am I right?”
When they parted they stared at each other, catching their breaths, trying to process what just happened.
After only a few seconds Tony felt Steve’s arm around his waist and his other hand on the back of his head, sliding into his hair. He even pulled Tony closer, as his lips gently moved against Tony’s.
Zapping through the channels, Tony didn't find anything particularly interesting so he decided to go with Family Feud, which never failed to amuse them.
“Sooo, uhm I was thinking, could we.. you know.. expand the dating pool? Maybe add some.. men to the mix?”
“We should stop with this whole rumor spreading. It’s getting too far.”
“That doesn’t exclude slapping your ass when we’re alone.”
Tony had the decency to look like Steve just insulted him. “Come on, Cap. We’re friends, I just think you deserve someone special.”
kiss, which made it kind of perfect.
Shortly after Steve had left, Tony’s phone indicated an incoming call. He hesitated, his first assumption was that Steve was calling him. He didn’t know how long he had been gone, it could have been a few seconds or several minutes, Tony didn’t know. He felt empty and had regretted their fight as soon as Steve was out of the door. His anger was still present, he was hurt and mad that he had been stood up for Bucky
“I’m not jea..” Tony paused, taking a deep breath, before he continued a little bit calmer, “it’s not that. I just.. I can’t do this, Steve. I can’t come off second best in this.”
sleep. I should be in the workshop and, well, work. You think Barton hides some Scotch around here?” He definitely needed sleep the way he was talking a mile a minute.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I..,“ Steve seemingly wanted to answer his question, but he didn't. Instead he said, “this isn’t just about the rumors, is it? What’s really up, Tony?”
Tony’s expression was back to confused and Steve was kind of sorry for stalling, but just because he wanted to be honest didn’t mean he needed to blurt things out.
When Steve finally arrived at the penthouse he was surprised to find Tony sitting in the big armchair next to one of the floor-to-ceiling windows. The surprising thing wasn’t really him sitting there, but how calm and relaxed he appeared. His head rested against the chair, turned to the side as if he was watching the rain and lightning outside. This was a whole different picture than last time a thunderstorm had raged over New York, Steve reflected.
At least Tony was right: orgasms did shut up your brain and made you sleepy. Take it from a genius.
Actually Steve still had full access just like he did when he had lived at the tower, but Tony didn’t want to let him know. At least Tony had two more days to mentally prepare for the encounter.
When they parted, Tony smiled sheepishly. "I'm so sorry. I promise I'll try to do better. I really want to make this work. Us."
“So, just to get this straight. You found out that I have feelings for you, which made you realize that you also had feelings for me. And then you what? Block Central Park and prepare a picnic date for us as a first date? At the Pond where you first..-”
“Alright, take me to the penthouse, please? And better tell Tony I’m coming.”
“I don’t.. I’m not,” he objected, even though it was a rather weak protest with the way his voice was way too thin.
A possible opportunity arose two days later when Clint announced it was time for movie night again. Even though usually the whole team was around during movie nights, Tony and Steve sometimes stayed back when the others already left. Being the ones used to little to no sleep, they often enjoyed each other's company, talking or relishing the quiet before going to bed way too late. So with a little bit of luck, Tony would be there tonight and would stay longer than the rest of the team. Then Steve would only have to muster the courage to talk to Tony, hoping he wouldn't ask too many questions.
“Yeah, well, nothing new. Out of the two of us, you’re the party-goer.”
Steve cleared his throat, checking if anyone had seen him getting carried away, but he was still the only one around and Tony was still working, so he was in the clear. Sighing he made his way to the door and when Tony startled at his knock on the doorframe he was sure that he hadn’t seen him staring at least.
She patted his shoulder. “Take your time and think about it. But do me a favour, talk to him. Just.. talk and you’ll figure it out.”
And that was it. Just like that. No awkward silence, nothing. Apparently Tony didn’t even care, which meant a lot since he was one of Steve’s best friends at this point.
Turning around, Tony made his way back into the living room. “Come on in. Unless you’re here to mother me as well. In this case I’d advise you to leave.” He threw a scrutinizing look over his shoulder, but smiled at Steve before he kept on walking.
“Steve..,” Tony started, but trailed off, momentarily distracted by the way Steve’s eyes were watching him thoughtfully, making him look a little sad but kind of hopeful at the same time. Clearing his throat, he started again. “Look, I think.. we.. There was this misunderstanding and you thought.. and I thought.” Tony knew he absolutely didn’t make any sense, so instead of continuing to stumble, he did the only thing he thought would tell Steve what he had wanted to say. Closing the distance between them, he got up on his tiptoes and brushed his lips against Steve’s. The contact was soft, chaste, but felt oh so good because of how long Tony had wanted to do this.  After a few seconds just in time with him breaking the kiss he felt Steve’s hands on his upper arms. He was gently shoving him backwards, which wasn’t really a good sign. But at least he didn’t push him away. Did Tony read something wrong? Maybe Natasha had misunderstood Steve? Tony felt his hopes falter and when he stepped back and saw the pained look on Steve’s face he was sure that he wouldn’t get to have this. But before he could apologize or run away Steve started to speak. “Why did you do that, Tony? Are you mocking me? Because if you are..” “No, no, Steve. Wait!” Tony interrupted him.
“For you it might just be fun..,” Steve paused and sighed before he continued, “but I’d say the others took the bait like ten minutes after we started this. I’m sure that at this point they’re convinced we’re.. together. There’s no need to keep this up.”
They wandered around in silence and even though it wasn’t uncomfortable, it still felt odd. Usually Tony was talkative and energized and blunt, but he never seemed as calm and relaxed as right now. He only ever became silent when he didn’t agree with what was happening and he was about to shout at someone or when he wasn’t able to solve whatever problem he had at hand. Either way they were not good kinds of silent, more like the lull before the storm.
Tony arched his eyebrow, grinning. “Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss me.”
"I.. can we please do this in person, Tony?" Steve was almost pleading now.
“Capsicle, hey. Come on in. How’s it going? What brings you here?” Tony rambled. Well, that sounded suspiciously like sleep deprivation.
"Uhm.. Yes. To both. I'm horny and I don't really know when I overshare."
He indeed did sound fine, which was exactly what surprised Steve. Last time his answer was nowhere near convincing.
“Aww, you’re such a charmer,” Tony sneered because, well, even if it was kind of true, Tony just wasn’t good at accepting compliments, never had been, especially not from Steve. Thankfully, he knew the procedure and didn’t argue.
tension.
“Hey, it’s okay. You don’t have to explain,” Tony interrupted him, patting him on the shoulder while giving him a small smile.
Tony chuckled while his hand continued his way to grip the hem of the fabric, trying to get rid of the underwear. Assisting him, Steve raised his hips and used his free hand to help Tony push down his boxers. As soon as the clothes were gone Steve felt the unexpected soft skin of Tony’s hand against his dick and couldn’t help but moan at the contact.
“Wow, you really meant it when you said, you're horny,” Steve chuckled without stopping his movement.
“Isn’t it? Why does it feel like it so damn much?” Tony exclaimed. He didn’t want to hear that it was his fault. He was the only one allowed to make himself feel guilty.
“What are you doing?” Tony eyed him wary.
“Not anymore. Not since you made me stop drinking, that is.” He wasn’t serious, he knew he could do whatever he wanted to do, he was a grown up after all. But most of the time he couldn’t help himself, he just loved teasing Steve.
Steve snorted. “That’s how it is? You’re horny but you’re above taking care of it yourself?”
The next day he made sure that everyone was able to see him off and he told them that he’d be back to bother them with training sessions sooner than they’d like. He didn’t want it to look as if he was bolting.
“Nope, you’re coming with me.”
Tony didn’t really sleep that night, it was rather tossing and turning, overthinking and then finally falling asleep for about an hour before a notification on his mobile woke him again. Groaning, he dragged himself out of bed. Now that he was awake, he might as well get up and get some work done. Sleep was for the weak, after all. When he made it to the kitchen, he stopped dead in his tracks. Of course Steve was awake already, how did Tony not consider this? For a second he thought about just going back to his room, Steve didn’t seem to have noticed him yet. But then again, they were roommates, they wouldn’t be able to avoid each other forever. And maybe, just maybe, Steve wasn’t even mad, maybe he hadn’t even noticed what almost happened yesterday.
“You're going through that much trouble just to not have to ask me out?” Steve was teasing, but his eyes had widened at Tony’s statement in what was probably surprise. But at least he didn’t just turn around and leave, so there was that.
“Balcony,” Tony called out to him.
Tony stared at him for a few seconds. Did this really happen? At first he found out that Steve might be kinda into him, then he got to kiss him and now he was really telling him that he had real feelings for him? He had definitely not expected the evening to go
, his hair was even softer than it looked. Tony had to suppress a groan. This was just unfair.
“Tony, please,” Steve interrupted him. He leaned back just enough to look at Tony. “I’m just so anxious all the time. I’m constantly worried about him, about you. Every time Bucky calls I’m afraid something could happen to him. And then I’m instantly worried about our relationship. But nevertheless I shouldn’t have ran off. Again. I’m sorry. He’s way better already and I promise he’s just a friend that needed my help. Nothing else.”
Even though he had spent the last few months trying not to think about why he was kind of drawn to him, deep down he had known the reason. And that’s exactly why he shouldn’t have allowed himself to be this close to him, it was bound to mess everything up. Starting now, apparently. What got him the most, though, was how different this time had gone. Their whole encounter had been so playful and kind of sweet, actually, like they gradually stepped up their game from an almost anonymous handjob to something that could almost be real. It had made Steve want to keep kissing him, holding him afterwards,
"Oookay. I'm not following, Cap." Confusion was written all over Tony's face.
“Where are you?”
Steve cleared his throat, he didn’t exactly expect Tony to return the favor but he was definitely not going to turn him down. “Yeah.”
“Huh, is he angry that he’s the last one to notice,
Taking a deep breath which turned into a soft chuckle, Steve shot Lincoln a smile. Going by the look on his face he already noticed something was off.
After they figured out how to angle their arms so they wouldn’t interfere with one another they found a matching rhythm: fast and hard since getting off rather quick was the ultimate goal. And it felt
“All right. Wanna come up with me right away?”
“Did you just say
“Hey.” He paused shortly before he continued, “is he okay?”
Last chapter, here we are!
“You sneaky..,” Tony stopped at the look Steve gave him. No swearing then. Tony made a mental note to keep a list of how often he would be told ‘language’.
When the last Chitauri had been defeated, the only thing Tony wanted was to shower and spend some time alone with Steve, but apparently that was just too much to ask.
“I never said I wouldn't get anything out of it.”
Steve had told himself that maybe Tony was right and it would be good for him to get to know someone. That’s why he had agreed to meet Kirsten in his favorite café. At least he wanted the date to take place in an environment he was used to. The first few minutes had been quite awkward, the smalltalk rather brusquely and they hadn’t known what to talk about. Until they had agreed that they both couldn’t imagine anything between then. From that point on they had been much more at ease, talking about music and art they both liked. It had turned out to be a really nice afternoon even though they would never be more than friends at most and that’s what he told Tony.
“Because you love him.”
“I’ve asked myself that very question a thousand times, I honestly have no clue.”
Clint had left an hour later and Tony was about to make his way over to the couch where Steve had been sitting when the alarm went off. So whatever they wanted to do had to wait until they saved New York City once again.
It wasn’t often, but Tony didn’t know what to say, so he just went with, “yeah.. okay.”
“I’ll keep it in mind. Even though late night snacks are not my preferred late night activities..”
"You too, Cap," Tony answered so quietly he wasn’t even sure Steve had heard him before he hung up and let the phone fall on the table to bury his head in his hands.
“I think ‘a baby’ was the obvious one, I don’t know why it wasn’t on top.”
much better. Tony smiled. That was enough of a promise for now. Maybe he would get to wake up next to Steve more regularly after all.
“You know what also releases Serotonin and Oxytocin?” He whispered.
“Oh, that’s a good one. Five bucks someone’s gonna say ‘penis’.” Steve burst out only seconds later.
“Did you..” Tony’s lips twitched, a smug grin appeared. “You hugged that tree, right?”
“So..,” Tony started, he’d be mute long enough apparently. “You hug trees?”
Hearing Steve confirm his statement was enough for Tony to lean in again and press their lips together. Just a second later Steve kissed him back, gripping Tony’s lapel, pulling him in close. Tony nibbled at Steve’s lip causing him to moan into the kiss. In return Steve pushed his tongue forward, opening Tony’s lips enough to push it into his mouth until their tongues were swirling around each other.
Instead of answering, Tony made a grimace, looking down to his crotch. Following his gaze Steve saw that his fly was undone. Blushing, he noticed a suspiciously looking wetness on his pants. When he looked back up, Tony shrugged, looking a little sheepish. “Couldn't wait.”
“As I told you therapy is working and it’s true. I know you’re just caring, but I’m getting better. But I’m kinda worried about you.”
Gripping Steve’s hips for steadiness Tony raised himself on tiptoes to bring their mouths together. Steve hummed content and tilted his head to meet Tony, who gently licked along his lips, asking for entrance. Opening his mouth, Steve took the opportunity to nudge Tony’s tongue with his own.
“Alright, calm down. What’s wrong?”
“Sorry, I’m.. uhm.. bed. I’m off. To bed,” Tony stumbled while turning around, practically running off to his bedroom.
Steve chuckled at Tony’s soft ‘Really?’, but instead of answering he just leaned in and kissed him.
When Steve stood up as well, he briefly contemplated what to do with the slightly less sticky mess in his own crotch, but just followed Tony’s lead, pulling up his pants, closing the fly. He’d be going for a shower as soon as he’d get to his room.
Just as always, Romanoff, or ‘Ms. Cruel Punisher’, as Tony liked to call her whenever he was allowed to finally leave the gym, wasn’t satisfied with their performance. Tony didn’t get why he and Banner had to train basic close combat when one of them only fought in armour and the other one turned huge and green. And Steve was good enough anyway. But Natasha insisted that they should be able to defend themself every second of the day whether they had their resources or not. Maybe she was right, not that Tony would tell her, but he still hated her drills. The only good that came out of their sessions was that he got to watch Steve. That might actually even be the reason why his fighting wasn’t improving. Again, Steve was pretty distracting. The way every twitch of muscle was visible through his shirt and his sweatpants tightened around his thighs and ass with every movement. Much less the way he moved, swift, powerful and capable. With him in the room you didn’t just look away. At least that was how it was for Tony.
“Where are we?”
“Nope, just got distracted.”
A few moments none of them said anything until Steve, who was still standing in the middle of the room, finally looked at Tony again and said, “I’m glad that you invited me over.”
Another afternoon, another date, but this time Steve was facing a man instead of a woman. Not that it made him any less anxious. Maybe even the opposite. He didn’t really make a difference, new people in general unsettled him, but at least he had slightly more experience dating women. He had noticed that he was attracted to men years ago, but that was about it. He had never mentioned it until recently and he especially had never acted on it. Until about half an hour ago when Lincoln had entered the café.
Natasha was the first one to find her words again. With a wide grin she said, “get a room, you two!”
“There you are,” Steve greeted him.
When he slowly came back to himself, opening his eyes, sitting up a tad straighter, he glanced at Tony, who was still crouching on the floor. A small smile played on Steve’s lips. “You want me to..,” he trailed off, vaguely gesturing in Tony’s direction.
Giddy, soppy, infatuated? Definitely not.
Indecisive Tony watched him, probably pondering if he was serious or not. “So.. does it help?”
“...and you really need to get laid.”
That had been about three months ago, but right now it didn’t even seem to bother Tony that the thunder was rolling and lightning lit up the dark sky he was watching. He hadn’t even noticed Steve. Concern coursed through him and he stepped a little further into the dim lit living room. He still wasn’t able to see the expression on Tony’s face, but his assumption that he was calm and relaxed seemed to be true. Stopping at a safe distance in order to not startle him, Steve quietly greeted him, “hey Tony. Sorry, I’m late.”
“No, thanks.”
“I did and I’m gonna do it again if you start rambling again.”
Steve nodded and after a few seconds he took hold of the waistband, pushing down the underwear until he hesitantly took Tony’s cock in a loose grip as he started to stroke him. He glanced up at Tony who moaned at the touch but managed to nod slightly, trying to reassure Steve. It seemed to work because his grip firmed up and he soon found a rhythm that was rather fast. Tony knew he wouldn’t last long, he had waited too long for this. Even though he wanted to watch Steve jerk him off, he closed his eyes, hopefully making it a bit easier for him. It took only a few more strokes until Tony felt his body stiffen before it went slack when he came with one last moan.
Tony didn’t even try to hide his laughter anymore. “No awkward silence at least, right? I’m really sorry.”
“So, anything to take account of? Anyone we need to talk to or something?”
He should be fast asleep. Almost too tired to keep his eyes open, he still forced himself to do just that. The pictures of a demolished New York were still way too present, shattered buildings, scared civilians and the far too close call when one of the aliens almost shot Tony out of the sky. Steve breathed in, but cut off the sigh before it could escape his mouth, just remembering that he wasn’t alone. Stuffed in a tiny bed, for a supersoldier at least, he laid next to Tony. On their backs, shoulder almost touching, they just about managed to not have any body parts hanging off the edges of the bed. It wasn’t comfortable and sleep was nowhere in near sight, but just because he couldn’t sleep didn’t mean he needed to keep the other man awake, too. Even though Steve mused that he wasn’t the only one having trouble sleeping if Tony’s not so even breath was any indication.
Tony pushed himself off the counter and walked up and down the kitchen. Fuck, fuck,
“I could’ve even flown us here.. which would have actually been kinda cool. But the point is, you don’t just walk to events like this, Cap.”
“Yeah,” Tony replied just as quiet before Steve raised his hands, attempting to grab Tony’s face. “May I?”
“I think I should talk to him.”
The last thing he saw was Tony's eyes widening before he pulled him in for a hug. Holding him tight, he whispered, "I missed you, Tony. Of course I still want this. Want you."
“Tony,” Steve said, tone warning.
“You think he would mind seeing me?”
“I just.. I thought..,” Tony stuttered, but Steve must have noticed his tentativeness, because he gently cut him off, “No, no. Sorry, that was definitely not how I meant it.” Reaching out his hand, he took Tony’s and gave it a small squeeze. “It’s perfect, Tony. It’s really thoughtful, actually. I’d take this over any fancy dinner every day.”
“God, please don’t call it that!” Tony groaned, after this conversation coffee probably wouldn’t do the trick anymore. This felt like a ‘passing out drunk’ kind of turn of events. “Maybe it’s just.. Maybe he wants something solid, a relationship or something. I don’t know.”
“Mornin’,” Steve finally mumbled. “I’m going for a run, coffee’s ready.” With that he left the kitchen, faster than Tony’s whispered ‘thanks’ could even leave his mouth. And Tony just stood there, unable to move, repeating the most awkward encounter they had ever had in his mind over and over again. Until Steve apparently left the flat, the slam of the door rousing Tony from his trance-like state. Shaking his head in order to get rid of the thoughts he made his way over to the coffee maker. If he wanted to make it through the day, coffee was more than essential.
“Oh come on, Tony. He’s my best friend. I didn’t wanna say something, but he told me what happened, he’s miserable. He feels so bad about how uncomfortable he made you. Even though I didn’t even know that was possible,” she tried to joke, but all that Tony heard was how woeful Steve was and that it was Tony’s fault.
Where did that come from? That was definitely not Tony’s plan. He should have known better but sometimes he simply forgot how sassy Steve could be.
“Uhm, sorry. What were you saying? Tony asked, a little sheepish.
The meeting with SHIELD had taken longer than he had anticipated and still produced less results than he had hoped for. To top it all, the announced rain had come early meaning he didn’t make it home in time before the rain started. Steve wasn’t too mad about getting wet, but when he heard the first distant roll of thunder of an approaching thunderstorm he cursed himself for always insisting on taking the subway. He could almost hear Tony’s voice inside his head telling him to ‘take the damn car’ or ‘let Happy drive you’. Not that he’d admit it, but for once he wished he would have listened to him.
“No, I just.. wait, what?” Steve’s eyes widened. He looked genuinely confused.
When Steve arrived at Bucky’s flat and didn’t get any response after knocking, he was on the brink of kicking in the door. The worst scenarios played out in his head, making him think that he was too late. But then the door opened, revealing Bucky. “Hey Ste..” He was interrupted by Steve pulling him in, giving him a bear hug.
Probably prepared to be yelled at, Steve didn’t flinch, but he opened his mouth as if to say something, but closed it again. Maybe because he knew, Tony wasn’t done. They still knew each other pretty well.
“I really don’t want to hear his name right now. You’re ditching me the third time in two weeks. When do I have to stop competing with him? Maybe you should finally decide who’s more important to you,” Tony almost yelled. It was unfair and he knew it, but he still couldn’t help himself. The way Steve stood him up again and again just to be with Bucky had led to more than one argument the past few weeks. Tony had even accused him of having a thing with Bucky. It hadn’t been rational, he knew that, but having self-confidence issues made you do shit like that.
"Just so you know that
Possibility D: the potential partner would figure out how different Steve Rogers and Captain America really were. Once they would find out that Steve was, at heart at least, still a scrawny, anxious kid from Brooklyn when he took off the uniform they would break up with him. And that one was possibility E at the same time, because Steve really was still anxious and didn’t even know how to have a relationship so he would screw the whole thing up all by himself if anyone would make it far enough.
After leaving the elevator, they swiftly passed the living room and even though Steve was actually curious to take a closer look at the penthouse, this was definitely not the right time. He followed Tony into an adjacent room that turned out to be a well-spaced bedroom, but stopped on the threshold. This was so different, he realized. Watching Tony standing in front of his huge bed, watching him, waiting for him, actually being invited here not just slammed against the next wall out of an impulse. He didn’t know if it was any different for Tony, but for him it definitely felt like it was more intimate, more real. The realization made his chest ache, anxiety starting to creep in. Standing here in Tony’s bedroom he could almost imagine what their life could be like. Spending their evenings cuddling on the couch, enjoying their time together after a busy day before deciding to call it a night, falling asleep with their limbs tangled, knowing the other would still be there when they’d wake up. This was all he wanted, all the more it hurt to know that it would never happen.
A few days later spinning around on his chair, Tony immediately dropped everything when Steve entered the workshop. Apparently he was desperate to hear about his date. “Heeeey. So, how’d it go?”
Bucky laughed. “Yes, I am. Now go, make up with your boyfriend and for the love of god
“I’m hungry, let’s get another Shawarma, shall we?” Thor suggested and instantly obtained approval.
And that realization left him sad, hurt, angry and disappointed all at once.
About fifteen minutes later Tony stumbled into the kitchen just in time to watch Steve flipping a pancake over by throwing it in the air. Tony rolled his eyes but pressed himself against Steve’s back, wrapping his arms around his waist. He kissed his neck, before he asked, “did you seriously just flip a pancake by throwing it in the air without messing it up?”
“I think your ass is perfect, too.” Steve smirked before he leaned in and kissed Tony.
“Only if we’d make it. Didn't think you'd even consider. I was kinda.. talking without thinking."
Steve sounded worried now, but Tony didn’t want to linger over it.
This time he did pause, he probably wasn’t sure what to say exactly. For a brief moment Tony noticed how Natasha tried to hide her grin behind her hand and Banner’s slight smirk. But he was distracted by the big smile on Steve’s face. If Tony didn’t know better, he’d say it was a genuine smile meant only for him. That was wishful thinking of course, but he still found himself returning the smile, maybe even brighter than Steve’s.
Pepper just chuckled before she hung up.
As soon as the phone his hand stopped vibrating, it started to ring again. He hadn’t deliberately ignored the call, he just got lost in thought. A quick look at the display told him that it wasn’t Steve, it was Pepper and there was no way he would be able to disregard her, she would just try over and over again.
“You didn’t say anything when I kinda told you that I like men, too.” It was rather a statement than a question.
Tony pressed himself into Steve’s side, putting his head on his chest, tracing the muscles of his abdomen.
“You mean other than them basically having heart-eyes everytime they so much as look at each other?”
He took a deep breath, bracing himself for what was about to come. Usually Steve wasn’t resentful or feisty, but Tony didn’t know how much he had fucked up exactly.
“Oh god, Captain America is a tree-hugger, I can’t believe it.” Tony was laughing now. “You know what, scratch that. Actually I can. Of course you would be. Steve Rogers, telling people to watch their language and hugging trees since 1918.”
was a genius after all. And a playboy. And billionaire and philanthropist, not that it mattered right now but for the sake of completeness. But at least being a genius and playboy should help him in his situation.
At least Steve seemed calm and didn’t sound angry or mad and even a small smile appeared on his face.
Stopping briefly, Tony took a deep breath before walking up to Steve. Now that he was closer he could see that Steve was as soaked as Tony. He had been right, it
“Always at your service.”
“Huh.”
“Would this be.. awkward?”
There was a brief pause, before Tony spoke, “actually I just don’t want to kick you out of bed just to.. well.. “
Tony looked up at him. “You know, I was thinking.. Maybe Bucky could move into your quarter. You’re up here most of the time anyway, and you know.. I mean only if that would be okay with you.” He had started to stumble towards the end. Maybe it was too soon to suggest something like this, but now he had said it.
Lowering his gaze, Tony seemed to notice that he was still holding Steve’s wrist and swiftly let go. “I‘m sorry.”
“Just wrap your arms around. Lean your head against it, close your eyes and.. breath,” Steve instructed as he did just that.
“I think I’m done for today. Maybe I should get some sleep,” Tony broke the silence.
Kicking off his shoes, Tony tiptoed into the living room to find Steve still awake. His tiptoeing seemed to have been useless because Steve had still noticed him, head turned his way. So maybe stealth wasn’t Tony’s strongpoint, who cared? But this time he couldn’t even blame the alcohol, since he only had a few drinks.
There was the moment Tony always kind of dreaded when he talked to Natasha. It was the moment he realized that she knew something he didn’t know and not uncommonly she became smug about it. And Tony hated it. From not knowing something to racking his brain about what it could be.
“Continue not to, for fuck’s sake. As of now, what I say here doesn’t leave this room until further notice.” He looked challengingly at Natasha, who demurred with a slow blink. Then he turned to Steve, and exhaled. “All right. Go ahead and introduce yourself, soldier.”
Except that two weeks pass, and…no one gets called in.
“Hey!” Steve shouted, and chucked the hubcap at it.
“So go,” Bucky says. “Go before you start a fight you don’t want to finish. Idiot.”
It was like punching a lightning rod. There was no rebound, just magnets sucking themselves together, closing the circuit, and then Steve wasn’t inside himself any longer.
It was worse—his arms came up around her, so carefully, and she could feel him trying to soften. Trying and failing.
“What he’s suggesting isn’t justice.”
He steps out. Steve looks at Bucky. “What?”
They all watch as Steve’s expression gets stormier and stormier. The suited man remains placid as he gestures vaguely and grants Fury some pleasant, empty smiles. Fury looks less and less impressed with him.
On instinct, Tony stepped forward again, putting himself between Rogers and Fury. “He just woke up a second ago. Cut me some slack.”
“Sure. Sit there and look pretty. Ask questions if you’re confused, I always enjoy answering things, it helps me troubleshoot.”
“It was a logical conclusion to make.”
He thought it was better.
He was struck, suddenly, by the memory of sharing a cramped bed in Clint’s farmhouse, of suggesting sleeping head-to-toe and Tony making a disgusted noise.
Answer it!”
“If that’s what we’re doing, I call Thor’s,” Tony calls from the sofa.
“Why didn’t you go to medical?” Bucky mutters, leading them both over to one of the benches where he spies a first aid kit lying nearby. “Do you actually want some more battle scars?”
“You okay, mister?”
“Hawkeye, cover her,” Steve orders.
Tony’s phone rang. The tune was ‘Star-Spangled Man’.
“I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be able to make it through a movie without jumping both of you,” Tony interrupts, focussing abruptly. He looks at Steve, smiles crookedly, and then transforms the smile into an all-out smirk that Bucky automatically finds himself matching.
Subject: Re: sorry
“What are you talking about?”
Ethan swung around to look at him. “Explain,” he said.
“You don’t see it?”
“Yes, sir,” Steve murmured.
“Not too awful, considering our measures to keep everything mostly steady even with half the clientele gone during the past few years. A few hiccups, but nothing too serious.”
“Stark,” he said, looking tired, “This was not part of our agreement.”
“We do,” Natasha agreed, “But my work is here.”
“I think so,” Steve nodded, shuffling his feet. “Had a few starting ideas I wanted to run past you.” The two of them together, at ease, made him unaccountably nervous.
Tony exhaled, and turned. And then without meaning to he found himself striding over to where Steve was slowly getting down the stairs in order to make sure he didn’t misstep on the landing and break his neck. “What are you, why are you out of bed? Go back to bed.”
“That was—wow,” Steve said, grinning a bit.
“Yeah,” Steve choked. He couldn’t feel his fingers. He looked out at the water and didn’t see it at all.
Subject: WHAT
“I’ll try,” Steve replied. The sounds of chaos from uptown were waning, which meant that Tony’s trip through the portal was over. He took a deep breath, and headed out the door.
“Me, obviously. Now I’ve gotta cough up five bucks just for a damn thought.”
“A month. Give or take.”
Steve woke to earnest, young eyes staring at him. He blinked twice, ran through several stages of panic and a few of grief, and said, “Good morning, Morgan.”
“That’s JARVIS. Artificial intelligence, a brain made of computer bits that lives in the house,” Tony explained. “Say hi, JARVIS.”
“I think Tony should wear Cap’s outfit,” Bruce says mildly. And then he adds, “Oh wait. He already has.”
“Yeah,” he said, nodding, tentative at first, and then with greater certainty. “Civics.”
Of course. The continuum—the Stone they were bringing back was the one Clint had taken away, but that didn’t erase its own path through time and space.
She waited.
Steve and Tony looked at each other. Hesitantly, Steve raised the gauntlet in a small wave. Tony stared at it. “You used that? It’s broken.”
“You too,” Helen said, equally dry. “I think.”
“Port system prototype. We’re gonna use it for testing.”
She sucked in a breath, and her gaze landed on Steve like the coronal flash of the sun in an eclipse, piercing the darkness. “Oh,” she said. “Good answer.”
“Been successful? I think so. I think we’ve found him.”
“I’ll drink to that,” Pepper said, and raised her glass. “To all of you, our family, thank you. And to—to having time.” She looked at Steve last, and nodded over her raised glass.
“SHIELD has been giving you materials, I understand,” Feranza prompted.
She raised an eyebrow. “Tony.”
“Gotta say, I was impressed,” Dean replies.
“It damn well better be,” Tony says fiercely.
“Terminal velocity?”
Steve snorted. “I’ve seen him once since the boat, for less than an afternoon.”
“Crowded. But kind of nice. Sam and Rhodes are bonding over pilot stuff. Gonna have to pry him away with a crowbar if we stay much longer.”
“Who?” Benji said. “The mark?”
Conference room, all iron and glass. Could be anywhere, but Tony was wearing the same tie he wore when he asked Steve to sign the Accords. “Hi, Tony,” he heard himself say.
“Convenient is...good?” Steve asked, wanting badly for the bedclothes to rise up and strangle him.
“I ain’t sweet on dumbasses who insist on coming on missions while sick.”
” Her grip on him tightened. He didn’t let her go.
“I imagine he means me,” the Ancient One said. Steve jerked his head back to look up at her. She looked back at him with preternatural calm.
“I am not missing that,” Clint agrees, falling into step with her. He calls over his shoulder, “Any time you wanna join us, Stark, just come on up.”
Steve sighs. “Tony. This is my first class at this job. I’d like to get my head together.”
"No, sir.”
“You know him?” Steve asks, from her other side.
Both Tony and Steve turn red.
Pepper was already tucked under Rhodes’s arm, clearly torn between watching and hiding her face. Steve found her free hand and squeezed it, nearly too hard. She didn’t seem to mind. She was going to cut herself if she bit her lip any harder.
“Stark?” Cap echoed, struggling to sit up. Not wanting to turn his back on Fury, but feeling concern anyway, Tony turned to help him and put a hand tentatively on Cap’s wrist. Cap looked at him, watchful, but more trusting than Tony deserved. He tried to keep his voice steady.
“No.” Steve agreed, and then the legs of his chair scraped as he pushed back from the table. “But some of it deserves more respect than others. Thanks for the toast, I’m gonna...yeah.”
“Kidding, jeez. About the replacement, but not about the interesting. Stark’s got a mouth on him, just like his old man.”
They were dancing.
they bonded with the stuff the Stones were made of, and those bonded with what the nanosuit was made of, so it all got mixed up and became more or less inextricable.”
Behind one of those seals was the aether, utterly unreachable, as it should be.
“Can we pretend I didn’t just say that?”
“What the fuck,” Clint says.
Steve shrugged. “Not much. I have a schedule I keep to. I’ve been reading a lot, trying to catch up. It’s interesting.”
Tony looks at the three men (or two men, one god…whatever), and shrugs. The board meeting can wait. “I like pie. Also, I’m kinda impressed by how much you’re not freaking out at Thor’s—” He gestures vaguely at Thor, “Thor-ness.”
Jane waved vaguely at the sheets of paper surrounding her. “Data.”
Tony made an unconvinced noise. “I was led to believe they were one and the same.”
“I get it,” Steve cuts in, and Bucky can’t fucking believe it, he might actually be pouting. “I just don’t think we should treat him like we think that. Have a little class, for god’s sake.”
“I don’t know what to do with him,” Tony said, the emotional exhaustion of the day turning him honest. “Five years ago he left me for dead. Now he nearly killed himself bringing me back. I don’t know what to do with that.”
“The Initiative.”
As she slides into the back of the town car and exhales in a huff, Happy casts a look at her in the rear view mirror. “Where to, Pepper?” he asks sympathetically.
“Uh...”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Just a little. Sure.” He crossed his arms. “Stark’s downstairs working on building himself a body. It’s creepy as shit. Do you want to see?”
Pepper held out a hand, a hint of challenge in the set of her gaze. Steve was a sucker for that kind of look from a lady. He sighed, and gingerly stepped forward. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he confessed. “At all.”
“Can confirm, on my end at least,” Steve murmured.
“Frankly, we’re on way better terms with the non-Judeo-Christian types at this point,” Sam says. “When a rogue EMF signal manifests as a friendly Norse god, it’s a pretty good day for us.”
“No,” Steve echoes, too quietly.
“Dr. Cho,” Steve nodded. “Thanks for coming.”
“I hope Helen has some ideas,” he said.
“While maintaining control over the situation, you mean,” Steve clarified.
Steve’s on a side street, and he’s taken down two bots already, but there are three more and they’re gaining ground. His left side is red from the shoulder down with blood.
“Morons,” Natasha says.
“Override accepted,” JARVIS says, with almost audible relief. “Welcome, Lieutenant Barnes.”
hey let’s not talk about it let’s talk about you, they haven’t drained all your blood yet and stuff, right
“It definitely worked,” Steve assured, looking back up at the Ancient One. He took another sip of whisky. It was shockingly delicious. There were layers to the flavor he’d never noticed before—not just the standard burn and woodsy sweetness, but delicate layers of mineral and peat, overlaid with smoke and bitter earth.
“There is a misplaced circuit in the fourth finger, sir. I believe you will be electrocuted.”
“Tony.”
why you now have my private cell number. Use it wisely. Or not at all. But yeah, wisely would be better.”
Sprinted.
“We’ve got a few of those running around the house,” Pepper agreed. “I think we can probably fit one more.”
“You seem weirdly happy about that.” Tony pulled up his screens again and started sorting back to where he was, while Helen pulled out a diagnostic kit.
"Let’s burn this kingdom down.”
“Wait, just a moment longer,” she said, her lips pressed into a thin line. “I need to adjust the organic compound mix to accommodate the change in overall profile...okay. Okay. 46% viscosity...yeah, that should do it. Jesus. He’s gonna owe me so many drinks after this. Stand back, this might be a little Frankenstein’s monster.”
"All about it until the unintended pregnancies,” he counters dryly.
“Hush. 47% complete. 70%. 86...92%....data-read complete.” Helen typed in a few commands.
He never sent them. But somehow, having Tony’s name in the address bar helped.
“Oh fuck,” Tony said suddenly. “That means…” He looked up at the cluster of them across the room. “Gonna be fine,” he promised. “But uh, don’t be alarmed.”
“Oh. Uh. Okay.”
Blazing white.
“You can try. And that was once. I hadn’t eaten in three days.”
“Hey, Cap. Long time, no see.”
“Among universe-hoppers, of course,” Natasha said dryly. “Turns out, there are a fair few of them.”
The tall one, Sammy, makes a protesting noise but doesn’t deny it. Tony preens.
Steve looked back at him. “You’ve been sticking around this whole time? How’s that been?”
Steve said, “Everything you did, I get it now, why you did it, even if I don’t necessarily agree with the how’s. When I told you I trusted you, it was because I meant it.”
Steve considered it. Would that be so bad? Tony has a family to come back to, and Steve—
“How long’s it gonna be before we can send the stones back?” Clint asked.
“So,” she echoed. “You’re...you weren’t. You were in the Stones? This whole time?”
“Sure,” Steve said quickly, and then seemed to regret it. “Well, that’s…there’s nothing wrong with it. No one does anything I’m not comfortable with, not really.”
“None,” he admitted. He looked back at her. “What if I’m stuck like this?”
In the end, it’s Bucky who decides.
“Hey,” Clint shrugs, “At least it’ll get the team back together.”
“Tony didn’t move on. He just moved forward. He didn’t really change, not at his core; he just discovered new facets of what he could and should do. You can do the same. You don’t have to stop, you don’t have to shut anything off. You just need to find what you’ve got that can be put to new purpose.” She squeezed his hands. “You don’t have to
Steve goes.
“Sometimes Fury sends me out to scout for talent,” Tony says, sly grin firmly back in place. “Let’s just say I have an eye for it.”
“You haven’t done anything wrong,” he insists.
And if, late at night, he occasionally wrote Tony long rambling emails about the distance he could feel between himself and this world, about the people he missed, and the lies he’d told that day just to get through without friction, that was his business.
“I know that,” Steve said, sounding muffled and wet. “I do. Just.”
Steve stared at the iron blue of the water, and felt cold.
He paused. Probably did no good to badmouth his dad in front of a former colleague, unconscious or not. He took a breath, and continued. “And of course, Fury doesn’t tell me shit, because that’s what he does, he’s like a pirate-ninja, it’s ridiculous. One day I’m going to steal his eye-patch and probably get tased for the trouble, but it’ll totally be worth it. Come on, Cap, work with me here, I’ve only got ten minutes before they kick me out and—“
Steve planted his feet, and stared down the shimmer.
Tony blinked rapidly, and managed, “I do, Captain. What can I do for you?”
Steve went over, instinctively shying away from the empty space where the herald had been. “Do we need to worry about anyone else?” he asked Natasha. “People coming for Tony?”
“A little off,” Steve admitted.
“Have I missed an appointment or something?” Steve asked.
Tony sighed. “Yes, it worked. We got the Stones, we used them. Now we’re putting them back.”
The business card sitting in his jacket seemed to weigh it down, when he slung the thing back on.
“I’m sorry,” he repeated.
“And because it’s great foreplay,” Tony adds. He frowns. “Which reminds me, Steve, we haven’t actually followed through with that, yet.”
Tony's steps were whisper soft on the carpet. His feet entered Steve's peripheral line of vision, and Steve studied the ridged lines that articulated his arches, the flat flex of where his toes should be.
“Arguing with me, mostly.”
“Thanks,” Steve said. “I think.”
Darcy pushes the coffee cup further towards Jane, and then leaves in a whirl of knitwear. Jane breathes, staring through the stack of energy readings in front of her. They were unanimous and clear: the laws physics were working again. The holes between the realms are sealed, impossible to reopen without another convergence, or the help of the bifrost.
“Tasha?”
“Night,” he echoed, staring after her as she ascended the stairs.
“Tony?”
“Don’t think they’re worth that much, even with inflation.”
Bucky marches over and bodily shoves himself between them, and—wow, there is not a lot of space here, actually. Apparently Steve and Tony are both not only marathon arguers, but also
Tony exhales. “Yeah. I guess you are.”
Tony gave Steve a long look, unreadable and almost hesitant. “Got any afternoon plans?” he asked.
“Uh huh.”
Steve stopped in the doorway and stared.
The third week in, it’s finally Clint who puts a stop to the madness.
Steve laughed quietly, a disbelieving huff of breath. “Sure,” he said.
“Yeah.”
—opened his eyes.
Steve smiles back.
“I literally have no idea, Steve.” Tony’s faceplate rippled again. It was an unsettling sensation, especially since he couldn’t quite pinpoint what emotion he was actually betraying with it. “It’s like Helen says—we don’t even know what I am right now.”
“Thanks,” Steve said, grabbing one off the coffee table. “Tony?”
Just…thanks.
“But Steve’s down here!” Tony exclaimed. “I can’t say hi to a friend?”
Stephen Strange crossed his arms and leaned against the door frame of the house. Flickers of past and future lingered at the corners of his eyes. Pepper slid past him to wave goodbye to Scott Lang and his family and then exhaled heavily.
“Who is he?” Tony asked.
“I should never have taught you colloquialisms,” Tony says, wincing, his head becoming visible behind a fortress of broken Iron Man parts. There are visible lacerations along his neck and shoulders, and he’s hunched like his ribs are giving him trouble.
Fury tried to argue that they could get a helicopter to take Steve back to SHIELD in a fraction of the time, and normally Tony would have agreed, but he looked at Steve staring out at the sea, bundled in spare Navy uniforms and sweaters, his hands wrapped up in the sleeves, and he had the sneaking suspicion that suddenly appearing back in the city would probably just compound the surreality of Steve’s position. So he dug his heels in, and they stayed on the boat.
“Up, Rogers, I’ve got your permission slip, we’re going out,” he said.
“Of course she is.” He couldn’t understand how he could exist in this nanoparticle coffin and still be whole. Where were his neurotransmitters? Where was his grief getting siphoned off and neutralized? Why did he still feel like his hands were shaking when he didn’t have a brain, or adrenal glands, or
He’d gotten frustrated with trying to calculate models based on a wing and a prayer anyway, and was therefore consoling himself with some more tangible materials, even if they might end up a complete waste of time. Maybe instead of building a port system to the cradle, he’d end up with a teleportation device. He’d done worse.
Steve gathered a small bag—inconspicuous, topped off with one of several history textbooks issued to him by SHIELD. Underneath that, a change of clothes, and a shaving kit. He slung that and his jacket over one shoulder. He typed into his phone as he walked.
She smiled briefly. “I always wonder what might have happened, if he and Steve hadn’t fallen out. Are there universes out there, where that happened?”
“Ferragamo on Fifth Avenue,” Pepper replies, and folds her hands very neatly in her lap. “Tony’s black AmEx is desperately in need of some exercise.”
“Tony and I. We took a long road, forgiving you.” Her mouth twisted. “I’m still on it, if I’m being perfectly honest.”
“No. Should it have been?”
Steve sat down slowly in front of the open case and stared. Wondered if he could wear the glove for just long enough to bring Tony and Natasha back. He knew Bruce tried, but.
And then there was Tony. Steve had accumulated a lot of those, despite having only his memory and the occasional press release to go on. Scribbles of quick hand movements, steady eyes, mid-conversation. The armor, or what Steve had remembered of it after the fact, full of gleaming surfaces carved out of the pencil lead with judicious eraser.
“That’s it, platypus,” Tony said. “Coast is clear.”
“I’m just a guy,” Steve said, a little stubbornly.
That he
“You never know.”
Quiet inhale. Quiet exhale.
a decent question, thank you. Very difficult to tell—it’s always harder to identify absence. I’ve got math, I’ve got some memories, though not all, I suspect, and I’ve got—hm. I’m very calm, am I always this calm?”
“Good,” Pepper murmured, low and emphatic. “Good.”
” the herald said, covetous, reaching towards Tony with an open hand. Tony leaned back. It didn’t seem to bother the herald, who just closed his fist on air, and then
Tony hissed through his teeth. “How long’s it been?” he said at last. “For you?”
Tony levered himself to his feet with a whisper of metal plating. “That’s my cue.” He unnecessarily circled the coffee table on his way towards the kitchen, brushing cool fingers over Steve’s shoulder as he went, just across the collar of his t-shirt, just enough for his index finger to touch the skin of Steve’s neck. Steve inhaled, blinked slowly, and listened to his footsteps retreat.
Hope you’re well. All is in order here.
Natasha walks forward and kisses his cheek. “Relax, Tony,” she says, “You’re team now. Come on, Barton, we’re doing spaghetti westerns tonight with Thor.”
Steve thought to himself.
“I don’t think I was fully aware, then,” she said. “It took a while to get myself together.”
Steve only stayed for an hour before getting back on the subway towards Manhattan.
“I hope that’s not penance anymore,” Steve commented.
“Technically, it was Howard’s.”
“You guys feel like we should be doing something right now?”
“–so I figured I’d let the internet do the talking this time. Did you know that I had to divert a satellite just to get you a wi-fi signal in here? SHIELD is kind of really intent on you only hearing what they want you to hear.”
cooler.”
Tony waggled his eyebrows at him. “I’ll call my driver.”
“Guess that wasn’t what the newsreels liked to show,” Tony said lightly. Steve sighed.
Tony breaks the ice, because of course he does.
“Please tell me your eye isn’t why I have this job,” Steve says flatly.
“You’ve actually got great timing, in a way,” Tony said, looking slightly uncomfortable. “I was going to turn the reactor power on tonight—hook it up to the grid. Provide the surrounding three blocks with free power. It’s gonna be a nice little light show; Pepper will come by too, so you can meet her, she’ll get a thrill out of that.”

“They’ll come looking for it.”
Steve looked at him, then at his SHIELD uniform, and then down at the ground. “Sure,” he said eventually. “A few.” It’s not entirely a lie, if he counts Maria Hill alongside Natasha. And Fury. People who watch him like he’s part-golden ticket, part-ticking time bomb. Everyone else called him ‘Agent Ryerson’, and Steve couldn’t quite manage to consider any of them ‘friends’, no matter how friendly they were.
Steve is almost too wiped to notice.
“Well yeah, I thought you were some hallucination or manifestation, I thought—”
“Sure,” Tony said. He sounded a little like radio static. “We can talk later.”
“We won,” he said. “We won seventy years ago. My name’s Tony Stark. I’m Howard’s son.”
“Newton?”
“You’re an old, of course it’s not your style.”
Tony hummed, and awkwardly rocked the folder in one hand to get a look at more of the pages. “Civics?”
Natasha’s eyebrow paused, and then went high up on her brow. “I was talking about the tower,” she said slowly. “But good to know.”
“There’s nothing about you that’s virgin, Barton,” they hear Natasha retort, followed by what sounds like a slap fight.
Ethan screeched to a halt in front of a large, unwieldy looking building in the Village and snapped, “Go now. Stage one is now in progress. Here’s the guy you’re looking for.”
“Right. So yeah, I’ll get you on the internet, where all the crazies live. Don’t let Fury know you’ve been there.”
Since then, Tony had been treading carefully around Steve, but had made a point of being around, answering Steve’s questions with patience that Steve doubted was characteristic. He’d shown Steve some common technology around the ship—newest designs in radar and navigation, and then a handheld device that seemed to serve as not only a telephone, but every other conceivable connection to the rest of the world. Steve almost couldn’t believe it, but he’d seen the ‘Iron Man’ armour up close now, and…well. That was hard to beat.
Tony looked just the same as he always had. A little younger, maybe, than when Steve had seen him last—hair darker, fewer lines at his eyes and mouth. The wear of starvation that he never entirely lost after his trip into space was smoothed away.
Steve tried to accept that there were now
The ship docked in Iceland to refuel and then headed for New York.
His eyes were glowing.
“Everything’s fixed,” Steve murmured. “Except.”
“It would be okay if you weren’t okay with it,” Steve added, swallowing down the harder, more pressing words behind his teeth.
He opened his hands, a little helplessly. “The choice should be enough, don’t you think? We made our choices, and we’re not taking them back. But we’ve still got shit to do, don’t we?”
“Can you?” Pepper said, cocking an eyebrow at him.
There was a crisis in Burma, quickly dealt with. Steve only heard about it in passing, and Hill refused to give any further details.
Steve paused, and then nodded.
Steve felt wrong-footed, staying behind with the people who Tony was closest to. Who had never stood against him, never left him.
“Where else would you like to be?” Fury replied, face giving away nothing, as usual.
He watched Dr. Feranza quickly mask a frustrated expression, and waited for the hour to wind up. He was looking forward to the new reading material Tony had uploaded, which was apparently vetted and compiled by someone named ‘Pepperpot’.
“Infrastructure restorations?”
“No,” the Ancient One said. “But I’ll hazard that everything got very
“JARVIS, what’s the issue?” he says, shaking his arm as the team files into the living room. Steve rolls his shoulders slowly, over and over. Natasha clicks her tongue, a sharp, metallic sound amid the shuffling of dirty clothing and tired steps.
“I’m so glad,” Steve said with all the dignity he could muster, beet red to his ears even as something clenched in his chest, “that at least he appreciated me for
He visited the Stones a few more times. Each night after, his dreams were vivid, and they always featured Tony, in varying states of distraction. They didn't always talk, and usually when they did, Tony did most of the talking, about things that didn't wholly make sense, and which he didn't bother to explain. In fairness, Steve didn't try very hard to understand him; dreams weren't meant to make sense. It was like what Morgan said—it was nice to just see him, sometimes.
“Five bucks for your thoughts?”
“Is this how you treat your friends, Cap? Throw yourself out of tall buildings, hoping they’ll catch you—“
“What’s wrong, Tony?” he asks.
Tony had stopped, blinked, studied what he had been about to do with the gauntlet in his hand, and frowned. “Why?” he asked.
interesting reading. “I’m aware.”
When he reemerged out the back door of the garage, the shimmer had moved. Liquid and still transparent, it had shifted shape to form watery tendrils, curling together and then resolving into something resembling a limb. Slowly, slowly, it was aiming for the door knob.
Steve wagged his head on the pillow in an approximation of a shrug. “Did what I had to.”
Bucky sighs. “And we’re the only ones who think that. He doesn’t think that. You’re not talking to his level. And again, I mean that in the most complimentary way.”
“Seems like you’re letting him just fine, why should I get involved?” Steve replied, resting his elbows on his knees.
Tony smiles, and puts a hand on the arm closest to him. It’s cool, well-formed and pale, just like the rest of what it’s a part of. “Whenever you’re ready,” he repeats, and then turns back to another project.
this is an insult, I am insulted. And a few week’s not gonna do shit, what have I already told you about how long it’s been since Afghanistan. Hang on, you’re gonna need to lean with me on this turn.”
“In fairness, you couldn’t do those things normally,” Steve pointed out, a little dryly.
Subject: sorry
“I was bought when you caught me falling from the Chrysler Building, really,” Clint admits. “And when you lied to Fury about my fractured scapula.”
Dear Tony,
Tony raises his eyebrows. “You get confused with undergrads?
“That’s...patently untrue,” Rhodes said, after a weighted pause. “And I’m pretty sure if Barnes heard you talk like that, he’d whoop your ass.”
“Either I talk or I start panicking,” Tony replied, a little too flatly for Bucky’s liking. And then more quietly, “I hate closed spaces.”
Steve stared. “How…?”
“Get a job!”
Tony exchanged a look with Pepper.
“Oh boy,” Natasha murmurs. “This is going to be interesting.”
“Not many,” Stephen replied. “But some.”
A lot of Tony’s dream-rambling started to make sense in retrospect.
“But you’d be back somewhere familiar,” Bucky countered. He shoved his hands in his pockets. “Seems like something you’d want. Something you’ve wanted.”
Helen looked over his shoulder and said, “You promised I could have a look at him if I asked.”

“Right. Thank you, Bowers. Surface as soon as you’re able, and radio your coordinates to me on my personal line. I’ll be there as soon as I can.”
It wasn’t transmitted with malice, or even with any pointedness, but that didn’t make Steve not feel like shit all the same. The feeling of an oncoming migraine had abated, but now it seemed to curl back on itself, pulling at his attention.
(And that’s how the Avengers accidentally adopt a lost prince from another universe, and there may or may not be an intergalactic incident or five because of it).
Fury gave him more history textbooks.
“Slutty, slutty children,” Clint says.
“I miss you,” he blurted, because nothing was shooting at him this time, and he was tired of running away. “All the goddamn time.”

Stark Tower loomed overhead, and Tony tilted up to make a wild curl up its side before rolling back down onto the landing pad.
“He talked about you a lot.”
Tony sucked in a breath, and his hand closed around Steve’s wrist. His callouses were just the same.
“It sounds like someone needed to,” Pepper said. She sighed. “You’re so young, Steve.”
Steve looked around, and didn’t seem disappointed. “I’ve done a lot more with a lot less,” he said. “What do I owe you? I’ve heard I’ve got back pay, hazard pay.”
“Incorrigible.”
“...Tony?”
“Thanks,” Steve started to say, but the dream was already fading. He didn’t wake immediately, but he remembered when he did.
Nobody notices it, not really, but something definitely feels off, and everyone notices that.
“Kind of hard to do that when I don’t know what it is you’re really asking,” Steve countered.
“I need a place to put myself,” Tony replied, with all the sincerity Steve’s voice could muster, which was considerable. “Every second I’m in here, I’m killing him. So I’ll put myself in the suit, and then we’ll call Helen Cho and see about alternatives, but getting out is the most important thing right now.”
She made a pained noise. “
“Is there a way to extract him?” Steve asked, no energy left for further preamble.
“I’m glad you made it,” Steve says suddenly. “We make a good team, all of us.”
“And SHIELD’s gonna poke at him until he gives up the secrets to the serum.” Tony twitched. “I can just feel it.”
“Come on, come on,” he muttered, lips hidden behind a flat plate of nanobots. Pepper couldn’t tell who it was praying. She stepped forward.
This was a better scenario, and he was getting dragged into a massive espionage mission. Yes.
Steve had to force himself to breathe. After a moment, he nodded.
“He won’t
As promised, Steve made breakfast the next day. There was bacon involved, which bought Morgan’s automatic affections.
Steve grumbled disapproval. “Would you just get over here?”
Steve looks at Sam, who’s been watching them go back and forth for the past twenty minutes, not saying anything, arms crossed. At Steve’s expectant look, he raises his eyebrows.
“I just need you to listen—”
“I know,” Tony said, suddenly and acutely miserable. “I told him not to.”
“Guess you were just
“Ah,” Natasha said, mouth twisting into something resembling a smirk. “I suppose I could get his file for you. For a price.”
“My pleasure, you guys always give me the most interesting and exasperating work,” she replied, giving both him and Tony very pointed glances. “Captain, since you're awake, would you be willing to undergo some diagnostics? I’d like to see what impact Tony had on your system while he was…” She gestured vaguely.
“In equally complimentary terms, I’m sure.”
“Good.” He relaxed back into the couch and closed his eyes. “Good.”
He’d been gunning it back from Iraq in the War Machine as fast as the damn thing would go–Tony would say that
Tony pulled out his phone, and showed him.

“It was good,” Steve said. “Different. The future felt…more real, somehow, after talking to him.”
“Scars are sexy, so I’ve been informed,” Tony says.
Pepper inhaled sharply, then let it out slow. “Ugh,” she said. “That’s probably what he would have said, too. You’re no help.”
“Only thing I could, under the circumstances.”
“You know,” Steve says hesitantly, “People would probably like those better if you used a wider colour palette.”
“That’s her, all right. Jeez. This is all...” He waved a hand.
And Tony’s grip had been steady, firm and warm. It had done a lot for Steve, in the first moments of waking.
“Huh,” Dr. Cho said, after a while. “Interesting.”
“Been a while since we’ve all been on the same project, hasn’t it?” Tony agrees. “Fury’s been keeping us all squirrelled away. I don’t think Bruce has come out of the morgue in a month.”
Steve takes a slow breath. “I deserve that.”
“Except in very extreme circumstances,” Coulson murmured. Hill shot him a look, but didn’t disagree. The three of them were fascinating, Steve thought. Three distinctly different brands of military training, composure, and poker faces. Hill and Coulson were more similar to each other, with the squared shoulders and straight backs Steve recognised from training camp, but somewhere along the way they’d had divergent career paths before ending up at SHIELD. As for Natasha...Steve couldn’t get a read on her at all. He suspected that this was, for her part, on purpose.
“Come on, then. Upstairs.”
“I rarely am,” he replied. “But think of it this way—transform something small, and it remains small. Transform something vast, something with boundless energy and vision, something...larger than life, perhaps?”
“I genuinely don’t know who we’re talking to right now,” Sam said.
“Needs must,” Natasha said, with a twist to her mouth. “And Tony doesn’t sleep anymore, now that he’s a suit. You’re the next candidate by proxy, he left enough of himself in you for it.” The eyebrow she raised was
The voice, however, was unmistakable.
When he came to, it was to Bucky with his feet propped up on the end of the bed, sitting in a squashy armchair he’d pulled out from the corner of the room. Steve’s suitcase had been on it, before. He wondered where it was, now.
“What about the 52

. You seem like the type of man who’d like a limb with ammunition.”
“Um,” he says articulately. “It’s…uh…the noise?”
Pepper disconnected, and Tony wiped a hand over his face. It probably wouldn’t come to anything.
“Tones?”

apartment.
It’s Fury who actually goes up to the suited guy, bypassing the officer at the desk entirely. And yeah, when the Deputy Chief plays secretary, it’s fairly clear that something’s up.
Fury led the way to a conference room that was all glass-walled and steel-brushed. Steve sat down in one of the oddly-shaped black leather and metal chairs, and cocked his head. It was surprisingly comfortable.
“So I’m here until you want me to fight for you,” he summarised. “Frankly, I can’t guarantee I’ll want to. I know what shady government organisations look like, Director, I’ve dealt with them plenty in the past. I’ll need to know precisely what’s at stake and why before signing on with anything you’ve got planned.”
But then they have a bad day, as they were no doubt due for, and Tony can’t do it. They get to the mansion and he starts peeling off the pieces as he walks to the elevator, each piece nauseating to lose but worse to keep on.
“No.”
his eyes were blue. Tony stared into them and said, “A naval ship, off the coast of Iceland. Morning, Captain.”
“It was an honest mistake?” Steve tries, rubbing the back of his neck. Tony hasn’t managed to meet his gaze once since they got back and realised what had been staring them in the face for the past three weeks.
“Don’t worry about us,” Steve agreed quickly. “I can...make breakfast tomorrow?”
Steve walked to his room and shut himself inside, locking it behind him. He was sure any self-respecting SHIELD agent probably could gain access, but it was an important habit to maintain, in any case. He folded himself onto the bed, and stared at the sketches he’d plastered across the opposite wall.
class,” Bucky argues, “He’ll think we’re just being old fogies.”
“You think he won’t come back?” Bruce mused, after a few more minutes.
“You know what was the worst part about the desert?” he said. “The walk.”
Disgusted, Steve began to follow.
Steve looked back out at the water again, and took a breath. “Is everyone in the military like him, nowadays?”
He put together a broad syllabus and reading list, full of alternative media and accessibility features of all kinds, with as many freely available resources as he could muster. He set out logistical maps for transporting kids from their schools to their local government buildings, made an index of addresses and fax numbers for mayors, governors, representatives, senators. Proposed projects, both local and national, urban and rural, for theoretical participants aged 12 to 18. He had no idea whether any of it was good, or even worthwhile. But he liked the idea of it, liked the idea of making a whole generation of kids who’d been overlooked and given short hands fired up about taking ownership of their society.
,” she said slowly.
Steve took an assessing glance, planned a route. Stood up straight.
Steve grinned, and made to follow, a warm feeling growing in his chest.
“Very well, sir,” JARVIS says, and Tony hears the whine like hornets in his ears, shaking him apart, and then it rises and rises until suddenly it bursts out of him, a sonic boom of force that sends him reeling.
Clint shot him a look. “You mean to say that all that time you were riding around with him, he didn’t once consider just staying back there?”
Tony was buried to his ears in his own DNA sequence when he heard shuffling and low voices upstairs. He decided to ignore it for as long as he could.
For the anon prompt: "The one technologically-related thing (or one of the things) Steve is better at than Tony."
“See, that’s where you and I differ. What’s one more violation of privacy between friends?” She stepped back. “You should get back. Solve your problem. I don’t want to see you again until you have your own ride.”
“You’re a gem.” Tony kissed her cheek, and took off at a run.
“Well then,” Bruce says, as they stand around the television in the main SHIELD conference room.
“Jim and I are going to do some organizing upstairs, but call us if you need anything,” Pepper said, munching on toast. “I have the suit available if you need any extra heavy lifting done, too.”
“After I broke out. Made quite an exit, shooting straight up into the sky in my scrap metal tank.” He gestured the curve of his trajectory—up gracefully, parabolic, and then down with a crash.
He practically shrunk under her hand. “It’s okay. I’ll go for a run, that usually fixes most things.”
“Lieutenant, I’m afraid Mr. Stark is not feeling particularly friendly towards visitors at this point.”
He tried to ignore the fact that he felt bereft, all of a sudden. He remembered belatedly that Tony owed him a ‘tablet’.
“Penny for your thoughts?”
, but it was hard going, there was nothing to hold onto except a vague sense of familiarity and loss, and–
“Yeah, I’m that Tony Stark, don’t worry about it. I don’t like putting my real name on the lease in case people get nosy. The water’s gonna be great, I just need to get it sorted. How’s the heating?”
Tony regarded him. He was so much easier to read now, without a mask in the way—dark eyes sharp, that tell-tale tick at the corner of his mouth that could pull up or down at a moment’s notice.
Motor functions seemed very hard. Steve fumbled with the space-time coordinates. “Are you sure—”
–and he still sees the massive explosion from ten miles out, and then his heart is in his throat until he touches down.
Clint went from half-asleep to concerned verging on panicked. “Hunt? What the hell?
Steve had narrowed his eyes at the guy, Mostly harmless in New York could mean anything from “occasionally plays loud music on the weekends” to “collapses in front of your door in a heroine-addled stupor and jabs a knife at you when you try to get past them”. Steve had dealt with both in the past. It’s probably the latter in this case, given how goddamn nice this apartment was.
Pepper exhaled. “He said he’d stay.”
“What did I say before about staying under the radar? Stark
floor for?”
“Hey, Cap,” Tony said from behind him.
. His autonomic responses seemed to just...fall asleep, like the circulation was getting cut off. And then Tony would reach out in a panic, jiggling the lax muscles, sparking the neurons back to life, and every time it was like reaching into a tub of non-Newtonian fluid—easy to stick a hand in, very difficult to yank it back out.
Bucky growls. “It may not be my fault, but all of those awful things in that—that
Steve just stared down at the Stones, almost willing them to spit Tony out, just do
“Can I ask you something?” she said.
“You know I’ll never say no to that.” Darcy slurps from her own coffee. “But seriously, is something up? Something about the aether, or whatever?”

She pulled back and cupped his face in her hands. “Why are you here? You used the Stones?”
It wasn’t hard to make the logical jump.
“Nay, Man of Iron!”
Steve pulled himself upright and brushed sand off. He was still in the torn remnants of his uniform. He supposed he should be thankful he’d lost his helmet in the fight; he wasn’t sure a kid would have dared approach him while he was masked. He breathed deep, salt clinging at the back of his throat.
“You’re like a younger, better me. Respect.”
“Please.”
Steve sent, with the mental approximation of a shrug. He sounded faint, like he was already half an echo.
“Nope.” Tony shrugged. “I’ve been told it gets better.”
“That...is that what you’re going to make the suit into?” Steve asked.
“Star Wars,” Steve says, a little sheepishly, “Apparently I had to understand just how much the prequels sucked so that I could then rightfully deny their existence.”
“I really don’t like the sound of that.” Tony commented.
Bruce made a point of patting him on the shoulder. “I’m glad to have you back. Whatever the circumstances.”

She threw her arms around him. She weighed nothing, but her grip was strong—it was like being squeezed by a strong wind. “What are you
“I couldn’t,” he repeated. Hmm. That was an interesting file. He should look at it. His arm didn’t seem to be working, though. “Tony, do you mind?”
Tony looks tired, when Steve comes into the offices at Stark Tower. It’s…disturbing. Steve’s seen Tony tired before, of course, numerous times, but it’s always been tinged with manic energy, a last crackle of fight that keeps his tongue sharp and his eyes focused. The bags under his eyes this time speak of slow, grinding exhaustion that Steve remembers seeing in the eyes of his men, when they’d been walking for weeks, sleeping fitfully in foxholes.
“Yeah,” Jane agrees.
“Sure. Whatever you need.”
That gets everyone’s attention at least.
Pepper held back a sharp intake of breath and immediately looked at Jim, who’d stopped halfway through plating the eggs. He flicked a glance back at her and gave her the most speaking of looks.
“Then am I—” He stopped. There was only one explanation, other than heaven or hell, which definitely wasn’t this. “I’m
For the anon prompt: "Tony attempts to buy each Avenger's friendship with technology. He doesn't realize he's already won them over through entirely different means."
It was a lot.
For shinkonokokoro's prompt: "Okay but, Steve+Tony on the run. And they manage to get 2 male passports. But they have the same last name. So they spend x-weeks on the run pretending 2 b a couple on 2nd honeymoon + then when safe, they figure out the passports are just brothers."
