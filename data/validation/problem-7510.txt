"Huh?”
All he found, though, was that Steve obviously thought Tony was the biggest asshole on earth, who went out to hook up with someone.
Tony pulled the corners of his mouth up suddenly feeling not so playful anymore.
”Car!” He said, rolling it over Tony’s thigh, who was still between something like pride and what might be his biggest panic attack he’s ever had. ”It’s the fastest one I have. But Papa liked the blue one better, anyways.”
Tony thought he’d throw up right there.
And also he knew he didn’t deserve this life. So better push it away before getting used to it, just to lose it. Because he would. He didn’t know lot by now but he knew for sure that he just couldn’t keep good things. It was just how his life was, this whole situation was just further proof of that.
Tony grinned in his vague direction loop sided and giggled a little, “Eau de résistance.”
He might remember soon.
Tony hummed and blinked one eye open, looking up at Rhodey, who looked like he was patting himself on the shoulder on the inside,
”But Lucky!” Peter whined, before crossing his arms over his chest, pouting half heartedly.
Tony just tried to put on a happy smile, putting on a mask, which he had hoped that he’d never have to use on him.
“Right, yes.” He held a big folder in Tony’s direction, who swallowed hard.
was sheer will power and the fact that his lips felt as if they were glued together. He really should drink more water, but that’s just the next point on his ‘whatever list.’
He had no business with it.
Steve had his hands on his belt buckle again, towering Tony by a few inches, still having this incredulous look on his face. ”So you do remember your father and you still have no desire to be better than that?”
He leaned back, suddenly too exhausted to keep himself up and sank back into Steve’s arms, who took a deep breath himself.
He groaned and grabbed his head, clenching his eyes closed.
Tony breathed heavily and looked his friend up and down. He was
He had just genuinely thought that he wouldn’t set a metaphorical fire when building a child’s toy.
“Tony.” He said then, looking up into his eyes. He looked like he couldn’t decide whether to try and hide his emotions or leaving them open on his face. Tony hated it, normally Steve always let anything be obvious visible, so Tony could easier relate to what he felt.
They had never been an obvious match. Not by any stretch of the imagination. This whole thing had been a big stroke of luck and Tony knew better than to believe in that.
Everyone around him watched his every movement, as if they were waiting for him to blow up or collapse, to break down again and lose control, even though he’s never had a solid ground to stay on ever since Steve’s shield went smoothly through his suit, just
, Rhodes. This man is crazy, honey, help me.”
Then again, he didn’t know anything right now, so whatever.
”Sleep well, Tony,” Steve said, before walking to his son’s room to probably tuck him in. Tony didn’t join them, but he thought that, maybe, he could be ready to actually help a bit more with Peter than just play with him.
Steve grinned bright as the sun and Tony instantly felt warmer. Yeah, it did. He
Tony threw a laugh back at him, before Peter grabbed his hand and all but pulled him out of the kitchen.
“I don’t know, Tony, that’s what I’m asking you.” Steve moved a bit closer to him, towering over him both like a warning and a defense mechanism at the same time.
Steve just sighed and shook his head, answering nothing.
just ask Steve
“See? You’re okay.”
Sure enough, he had dog tags on his neck. No way. There just wasn’t a way he had ever served. Tony’s breath quickened for a second before he got a better look at them.
Peter giggled, louder than Steve’s low protest.
He had all the evidence right here, open and clear, all the proof that he wasn’t even
Also also: my busy ass still sits down like every night after studying and work (hi hello I hate life) to write and anyhow, my angsty brain thought of these two things: "Tony can hear the true answer to any lie he's been told and is now terrified to hear Steve tell him that he loves him because he would hear that it isn't true" and also "trauma causes actual damage to ones heart - let's rewrite the story of the arc reactor" and lemme tell you. I thought it is a great thing to put these two together so :) Get ready for Angst ™ (with happy ending cause what else)
Tony laughed and then just smiled fondly at Steve, who looked him up and down, till it seemed to dawn to him.
He couldn’t believe how much of a Dad he was, after only having this kid around him for a few months.
”Don’t think I don’t know what you’re trying to do here.”
Tony looked up from his coffee, not knowing what to say to that. Yeah, of course it had been a lie but it was unusual for Steve to call him out.
”Sure it is,” Tony answered sickly sweet, before focusing on his plate again. He tried to tune his
”I love you,” Tony said to that without missing a beat. Three words and they still felt way too big for this small room.
Rogers looked at his pained expression and raised one corner of his mouth tiredly. ”The child seat is behind the driver seat in my car but behind the passenger seat in yours, because you always wanted to be able to keep an eye on little Pete, no matter what car.”
Tony hated that it was low key working on him.
Thinking of it, yeah, Steve totally knew that.
”Uhm, yes you would. That you didn’t surprised both of us and you know it is true.”
Sam was about to get up from his chair, presumably to walk around the bar towards Tony, but the shorter one stopped him with a cocky hand motion.
looking at the kid once, still hoping he would just forget that he used to have two fathers.
Tony had gone through many painful things in his life. Had lived through abuse, betrayal and helplessness.
”To finally be home again was really what we all needed, man. Zemo was such an asshole.”
He cursed his past self, before nodding at Rogers again, his sweetest smile on his face.
He also didn’t know why the ‘don’t care about me’ left this bitter taste in his mouth; as if those words didn’t belong there. They shouldn’t exist, not out loud and not as thought, because they weren’t true. Tony didn’t want to think about why it was like that. He didn’t care about Rogers.
proposed to you?”
He also couldn’t shake the thought that maybe this was it. Maybe that was the reason why they had deleted so much of the footage. To make sure he’d never know how much they had let slide and just passed off as something 'Tony would do'.
“Sure,” he nodded, and so they stood there and just looked at each other for the longest time, till Tony scratched the back of his head and looked around once more. Well, that was not what he had searched for.
The last time he showed any emotions like this was —
He was a little red around the tips of his ears, but evidently determined to act like he wasn’t. Instead of giving Tony a big reaction, he just shook his head, huffing.
Steve sighed and then got up, walking to the kitchen, beginning to wash the dishes silently, obviously still thinking about how to say something. Tony was about to run out of the room when he saw a plastic plate with little rockets on it, but then Rogers stopped his motions, turning to Tony. He kept his eyes on the plate in his hands though and Tony really began to hate Rogers for always looking like he had a lot of precious memories attached to about anything.
bubble up in his chest, like it wouldn’t that be impossible.
And then it had all went to shit and he had no explanation as to why.
He didn’t mean to make the child cry or anything. He just didn’t know what to do. He never asked for this, he didn’t want to be a father, he didn’t want the white picket fence life.
“Love’s weird. That’s what it is. You look at someone and are like
Tony pressed his palms against his temples and took a shuttering breath, trying to keep his eyes open and not miss a second of the footage playing in front of him. He knew it by heart, knew every little thing that would happen in it but he couldn’t stop watching nonetheless. It wasn’t all of it either, the others made Jarvis delete a lot of it, saying it wouldn’t help his recovery.
”That’s the guest room,” Tony scoffed mockingly and then smirked bitter sweetly at Rogers. ”You don’t even give me the master bed room and here I am, having taken you for a gentleman.”
“You can’t have it back, pal, losing my arm twice would just look like I’m careless. That’s not something ladies are looking for.”
”Hey, Big T.”
”Our,” Blonde answered strained, as if it physically hurt him to have to explain that to Tony. He had to, though, because of all the words he could have said, that one seemed to hit a blank in Tony’s brain.
Tony suppressed that thought immediately, this was nothing he should think of again, ever. This whole thing was over and finished. Steve was
Steve looked really uncertain for a second. Like he was mentally trying to put pieces together, not liking the picture they showed. When he spoke, his voice was hesitant. ”Have you — are you planning on going out?”
. No words found their way out of his way too dry mouth, and he just gaped at her silently, trying to let his brain catch up with everything.
Tony thought he’d break his neck by shaking his head as hard as he was. Both Rogers and the child didn’t see it though.
”Pardon, he was what?”
“Nobody, but
Tony was about finished with this whole night. Maybe even the whole week. Definitely his whole new life.
He shouldn’t, anyway.
Tony rubbed his head and groaned, looking around for a coffee machine. ”Oh yeah, I hoped that this was just a fucked up dream.”
”I hope you’ll feel better soon,” he said, before walking to the hallway, seemingly wanting to say goodbye to his nephew.
He had done everything to make sure that he’d live his life exactly like he deserved it, alone but heavily partying. He did never mean to pull other people into this and also — what were the chances. The chances that his life had made a 180 turn and he had ended up with a future that was the polar opposite of how he had pictured it?
As always: I am always super happy to read your comments!! They make my whole day.
”The point is, you don’t have to. I have been through a lot, Rogers, a few new nightmares won’t bring me down.”
if it didn’t
“Nah.” Tony smiled widely and waved it off, “I had to go over some details about the news SI tech, I kinda lost my feeling for time there.”
Tony shot a smile Steve’s way, still not knowing how
the word too loud.
He shook his head and tried to focus on the low feeling of happiness inside of him. Steve had said yes to the date even though he knew the way Tony was. It wasn’t as if it would come as a surprise to him when Tony wouldn’t act like the persons he usually went out with. Tony felt a sharp pain through his heart when he thought of that. He looked down on his chest in confusion till he realized that this must’ve been
And it was terrifying. Tony had been taken and captured. He had been tortured and he had suffered. He had an open heart surgery without narcotics in a
”Yes!” He exclaimed loudly, giggling again, ”When I move around a lot, his shirt gets all wet, look!”
But golden boy Steve obviously wanted to talk things through; he always had a wounded—puppy expression and opened his mouth ever so slightly when Tony was about to leave after they exchanged a few sentences, trying to say more, but Tony couldn’t.
Tony raised his eyebrows in confusion over his strange thoughts, like,
”Yeah, I did. You told me you were mad about me always ruining your surprises, but your eyes were a bit too watery and happy for that to be true. When I said yes before you could even ask you were making jokes about how you’re not accepting to have cooked dinner and bought a gold ring for me to say yes without you actually asking anything, but in the next second you were smiling so brightly, I was convinced for a moment that it had the energy of the whole city behind it.”
Tony didn’t think he’d ever get used to hear Steve say little things with so much honesty, so much meaning behind it, as if every word he said was important.
”Tony,” his voice had a completely different tone behind it now. It sounded husky and rushed, as if Rogers tried to get as many words as he could out there, before Tony vanished or something. ”I’d sign the papers. Everything. I know you don’t trust me, but I would make it easy for you, I promise.”
“You can't," he says bleakly. ”You can't fix me.”
Tony was aware that his breathing was stocking and quick, but he couldn’t help himself. This couldn’t be. This shouldn’t be. He had always been careful.
But who did this? Who would give a part of his happiness just like that?
”It’s too late to abort it now, isn’t it?” He asked, hoping to ease the mood. Rogers let this joke fall flat as well and Tony really began to think that it had definitely not been his humor that had charmed him into marrying him.
and roll his eyes to the ceiling. Tony could think of 337 different ways to kill Steve right on the spot and hated it that he couldn’t decide which one was the most painful.
doesn’t want to play now,” Tony bit out, harsher than he intended to but he couldn’t care less right now.
Chewing, swallowing, done. Hell, everybody could do that.
He’d be the first one to admit that it wasn’t his most genius train of thoughts, the second he got to the parking lot not knowing what the fuck kind of car his future self was even driving. Rogers had the decency to not look too smug when he caught up to Tony, standing in the middle of the lot, looking lost.
Rogers stood around in the middle of the room, looking around as if he’d never seen it before in his life.
person. He could feel his past self shaking his head at him.
”Tony,” he said carefully, ”are you okay?”
”You were over the moon,” he said silently, eyes shining in a bright blue, making him look way younger than 34.
He tried to change and really make it work; in fact, he’d never before in his life worked for anything as hard as he’d strived for this. And he couldn’t just let it go. Because once it was gone, what was he ?

he could concentrate without being interrupted every other minute, he began to drink.
This kid was spoiled if he thought that he could just pout his way to get everything. Tony never had family dinners, he never had play time with his father and look at him now. He was doing alright.
Steve stumbled a step back and stared at Tony as if he had just realized something. Tony would’ve given about anything in that moment to know what was going on in his head.
“How does it make you feel, that your parents are worried about you?” She looked at him through thick glasses, searching his face for something, but he couldn’t say what.
He took the steaming cup and was about to throw two sugars in it, without even thinking about it, when he stopped himself. This motion was so familiar: two sugars, three spoonfuls of milk. It’s how he drank his coffee, how he did for years, but right now he stared at the two sugar cubes, that lay innocently in his palm, and he couldn’t help but wrinkle his nose. His life was way too bitter, no sugar could help with that. It wouldn’t fill the emptiness inside of him, it would leave him feeling worn out and damaged, like the alcohol did.
Clint didn’t even bother to turn around to look at Bruce, eyes fixed on Tony, not doing as much as even blink.
“I can reassure you that I am still able to fight any battle, thank you very much.”
The scream that punched its way out of Tony got muffled by his violent sobs that shook through his body. Only one thing clear in his mind.
”Pete, how about you go to your room and search for a book to practice reading? I’ll be with you in 15 minutes, yes?”
Tony put his chin on his hand and blew a raspberry.
Tony didn’t feel like the third wheel in the room even though he had expected he would. He rather felt really fond, as if those two bickering was something normal for him.
Steve rolled his eyes, seemingly knowing what Tony’s strategy was. “God, Tony.”
let them all move in, even Steve
Tony just wanted to rub his temples and go back to sleep, getting the kid of his one night stand out of his hair.
Rhodey walked in.
”I can grab around your whole wrist.”
”Uncle Clint isn’t home this week, Petey,” Steve
Steve smiled tiredly, before nodding again. ”Thanks, Buck.”
Steve didn’t laugh this time, he just pulled the corners of his mouth up a little, looking nostalgic. ”If I said it was your idea, would you believe me?”
Dinosaur voices.
Steve seemed to get that something was up rather quickly, because he turned the stove off and walked up to the two of them. ”Tony, what’s wrong?”
Jesus, all that Steve was doing was putting Tony’s fires out, it was always a good call to have him with him.
and SR
“There’s been speculations that I was involved in the events that occurred, in the national hospital and the R&D department —”
He couldn’t get those pieces together, disappointment, frustration and self hatred in his veins. And then he met Steve Rogers.
“Very well.”
“You know what I can’t do?” Tony felt his hope dropping out of him, but he couldn’t stop here. Hope or not, he had things to say and he won’t let other peoples distrust ruin his life once more, “I can’t have a good day unless I’ve seen you and not a terrible one if I have. I have felt pain all my life long, I have suffered every
Did he say he had dropped the ball?
Maybe right now, he was just begging Tony to give him a reason to.

. This stranger was apparently his new family and he didn’t even know the name.
secret he tried to hide away so badly. She was not supposed to know that. She was not supposed to
Tony woke up with a silent scream on his lips and sweat on his forehead. He didn’t know if it was real but it felt like it. He had never been more relieved to wake up, but still so damn terrified. He could tell this was more than just what his brain tried to tell him was potentially real.
but so what? It wasn’t as if he rammed a shield in his upper body and than left. But somehow it was him not eating that much anymore far worse, huh.
He decided against it, again. Rogers seemed more like the kind of guy that you could make mad easily but way faster with actual words.
“You are not. Evil that is.”
“I never said you were a superhero.”
He didn’t know who he was.
”Fuck,” he grounded out, regretting it immediately. Yeah, he shouldn’t talk before drinking something first.
Steve nodded sadly and then huffed, in a downright hopeless way. ”I know you.”
”He sure will, little one,” Rogers reassured, shooing a glance in Tony’s way that was no subtle hint. It was a clear warning, there was no misunderstanding the message. It had a threat to it that made Tony swallow heavily and then nodding, slowly.
Tony rolled his eyes about the whole scene. He went on distance with the kid, always avoiding running into him. He didn’t want to explain to the kid that he wasn’t his kid. Like — he was but he wasn’t. Not anymore. Tony was not ready to be a father and also didn’t plan on ever being ready.
Yet, he didn’t mean to say it out loud. Especially not to Peter’s face.
Tony took a deep breath and looked around himself. He was lying on the couch now, his head still aching.
“Rhodey, this is just Mark II, even if you destroyed it, you won’t change a thing.”
And hell, yeah Tony knew. Steve felt guilty for the nightmares and thought that the best option would be to bring a bit of distance between the two of them. Tony couldn’t suppress a sigh. This was not what he wanted to achieve. And also, just as an aside, the action was worthless. It didn’t matter where Steve was, Tony couldn’t shake the pain of the shield hitting his chest, ghosting over his whole body. It didn’t matter if Steve stood right in front of him or visited Mars, the feeling was always there.
When Peter and his Uncle Bucky returned in the evening, they did in fact, not have a dog with them. Steve’s shoulders sagged down with so much relief, that Tony could barely keep himself from laughing.
He looked conflicted to say the least.
Tony scoffed and walked a few steps in the direction of
Clint sat there, holding lazily on to his own steaming cup of coffee and flashed him a teasing grin.

”Finally grew out of the sugar age and arrived in the adult world, Tin Head ?”
Tony didn’t really look too much into it though. He just wanted to make it happen, not know who or what. His last thought about this whole thing was that will all work out.
Steve didn’t want to get these texts, but he was worried about Tony.
Tony was all but napping on the couch when the door got slammed open and started him awake.
Steve sighed again and ended the call walking over to the couch, obviously making the effort to be quiet to not disturb Tony. When he saw that he was awake, though, his whole expression lit up.
Tony took another deep sip from the bottle in his hand, looking vaguely at one of the two Rhodeys he saw in front of him.
So it was better to make this really clear to Steve before he just ended up disappointed in Tony.
Tony actually huffed at this. It was so clear now, that he didn’t even know how he’d even been able to fall for it. He had been replaced the second he became inconvenient and something better came around.

It meant having your father shout at you for no reason, none you could grasp anyway. Having him hitting you because
“What a good thing that you’re not actually my mother then.”
Tony cringed but then tired to put on a smile, and turned to the kid, might as well play his role before he’d be the one who had to explain everything.
He guessed.
Tony shrugged and then fixed Steve with a heavy gaze.
he had lost without remembering any of it anymore, so right now their only hope was hope.
He learned a valuable lesson in the next second. He was deadly terrified of water and had not even the hint of an idea how to deal with something like that.
Nobody should look like a happy expression was out of place on their face.
Which he didn’t consider was the silence that would stretch around him the second the door closed behind the super soldier. Tony wondered if it was worse than feeling like he was suffocated.
Not high.
by creating a new element while being poisoned. For god’s sake, he survived months in a cave with a car battery running his heart. He survived flying into a worm hole and his fall to earth afterwards. He could eat Mac’nCheese.
”You don’t even look!”
Rogers just nodded as answer, huffing slightly. Sad expression on his face as if it was the only look he knew.
Even less so since there wasn’t a logical way to think all of this through. There was no explanation for any of that. It seemed made up because why? Why would the demon chose to possess him to torture others? Because that had been exactly what was happening?
Tony looked closely to see any of Roger’s reactions. He would succeed to make this man angry and he was definitely coming close to it right now. He made his hands into fists, obviously trying to seem unbothered, as if he was swallowing the words 'don’t talk about him like that'. All he did answer in the end was a bitten ”Yes” through clenched teeth.
“Five minutes. I swear it will be worth it, I brought an omelette.”
He looked at Steve and pointed with his thumb at the box on the counter behind him. Then he shrugged on his jacket, laying a hand on Steve’s shoulder and then came over to Tony doing the same.
. It meant not being able to cry when your mother dies, knowing that
inside, the kind of void that could never be filled again and it felt ridiculous to even try and drink something. He knew it would fail, would leave him feeling worse, and in the morning, Steve would be disappointed by him.
He worked for months, trying to find the easiest way to transmit the information that contain emotions from one brain to his own.
Tony grinned, nodding, “You love it.”
that is. He was certain he did. Yeah, he might haven’t had the most experience with this kind of thing and only practically was this short of impossible, but
Steve raised an eyebrow, unconvinced, causally leaning back against the counter and crossed his arms.
He’d show Steve that he wasn’t his trained dog anymore. He did what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it. And if he wanted to drown in an expensive bottle all in one go, than so be it. It was his problem and nobody else’s. He can take care of himself. The others will realize that eventually, the sooner the better.
He hoped it didn’t surprise Steve as much as it surprised himself. He didn’t know why he still had the feeling as if he had to prove himself to Steve, even though he had just looked at Tony and Peter together as if his world had just found its balance again.
He felt like he was a prisoner here. People had expectations and there was always somebody around. The only time he really was alone, was when he was in his room.
Tony felt no doubt on this side, who else could it be, really? Rhodey wanted to, he had talked to Tony about it so often, tried to let him do it, but Tony didn’t want to take even part of his happiness away. Rhodey deserved to have it all.
If that made things better or worse was a question beyond Tony to answer but it certainly showed that Steve was a self-destructive idiot.
As if.
Tony blinked some more. Then shooting a glance at Steve who closed the door and then walked over to them. ”That is — cool?” Tony tried, not knowing exactly if it was.
Tony didn’t need to humor himself with the hope anymore that Steve would oversee this like all of Tony’s mistakes.
Tony really needed that drink because he didn’t know why thinking about it made his insides hurt the way it did and he really didn’t want to think about it, either.
Rhodes sat down next to him, sighing sadly.
“You have no reason to apologize to me.”
He looked deadly unhappy, as if he had never ever wanted to say words less than those.
A moment, before he might be ready to try again. Maybe take another step. Maybe finally be the man everybody expected him to be.
He looked up after he finished reading and then stared at the frown that had built up on Roger’s forehead. ”Yeah, seems about right.”
serve?
Peter rolled his eyes before turning to his father, groaning. ”But I don’t want to read, I want to play with Daddy!”
And then with one snap of a finger, he wanted that too. Being happy, that is. Or just now what the big deal about it all was.
Because the bigger problem was that Steve might have either already fallen out of love with Tony, — and honestly who could blame him for that — or loved him for a person he no longer knew how to be.
He looked like he had just failed a mission and now had to pick up the pieces.
”Tony ?” Steve said in his just-Steve-tone; the tone that Tony craved so much, the tone behind the voice, something so soft and light. Tony nearly forgot that this was how Steve said his name for all the time they had been in a relationship.
He needed answers though and he really didn’t want to ask Rogers about them. He couldn’t trust him. He didn’t trust
”Thank you for letting us stay here again, we really didn’t know where else to go.”
Rhodes blew his cheeks up and looked from a second to the other more sober.
“My love for you is the only thing that I know for certain is real right now,” he whispered softly, not quite meeting Steve’s eyes anymore; hoping that this whole scene was real. Hoping that he wouldn’t wake up in the trunk of his own mind again.
He loved to face his problems the easiest way, the opposite of head on. Even more so when there was literally nothing he could do. He’d love to remember everything, finally get the answers he craved, but he couldn’t just press a button and remember, so he had to hope for the best.
When a deer runs into the road, it is so startled by the headlights that it doesn't move for a few seconds instead of running away instantly. For the first time in his life Tony could totally relate to this. When Tony walked into the kitchen everybody watched him with careful eyes, guilt all over their faces screaming
, who raised this guy, this was his own home.
Tony must’ve zoned out looking completely defeated, because Steve just sighed and stared at him with so much love and understanding. Tony wasn’t sure if he was able to handle the way Steve looked at him like he was the greatest thing since tabbed browsing.
He was really certain that Steve loved him. But not him. It was fairly obvious that Steve was a loyal and honest man, he wouldn’t leave his husband that quickly.
who could take him away, because, Jesus, Tony was awake for 5 minutes and he really didn’t need that right now. He wanted something to drink and then sleep and maybe even find his one night stand again and see if she was up for another round.
Steve let him down on his bed, standing by the foot of the bed a bit longer, looking down at Tony. He looks back at Steve, who is obviously pretending not to be worried.
The kid pulled his bright eyebrows together and looked for a second like the exact mini-version of the man carrying him, who also wore the same expression, but then his little face eased into a little giggle and then another yawn.
He never planned for this to happen, he never even
Spectacularly so.
Tony was about to scoff and disagree but Steve raised his hand and shook his head determined. ”Don’t. I do. I know that you have a heart even though you try really hard to not let it show. You don’t have to, I know you don’t trust me with it. But Peter has done nothing wrong. He deserves to have his hero and I know that you don’t think it’s you, but it is.”
“You have nightmares again.” Steve nodded slightly with his words as to bring Tony to dismiss or confirm the answer.
Bruce was a good man, he’ll sit down and think about everything until he got the whole picture and there was no way to stop him from doing so. It might take him awhile to put all the pieces together, a day or two, but he’d understand eventually. All Tony could do now was avoiding the other man until — well, until everything was really all right again.
And it was so good. Until it wasn’t.
Steve nodded, obviously anything but convinced. “Promise to call me if you need something?”
Tony could hear a faint ”Well, Pete, your Papa is the bad guy. He says no to a dog,” over the phone and then Steve sigh.
Rogers nodded and walked one step closer to Tony, till he seemed to realise what he had just done and came to a stop, still a respectful distance away.
Yet, this might be one of his worst throwbacks.
Steve sat down and then looked him straight in the eyes.
He woke up to a not quite steady beeping sound. It fluctuated between irregularly fast and sluggishly slow, missing a beat completely from time to time. Yeah, definitely his screwed—up heartbeat.
, while he sat in his chair, not knowing what was expected of him.
His room, that he spend most of his time in, because before today, he had avoided the kid like the plague.
Who the hell fell for — him.
real.
Rogers looked up from where he was cleaning the table. ”You actually quit drinking.”
Yeah, more like he had thrown the ball.
noticed him, he made a little hand motion and flashed Tony one of his tiny smilies, that still made his frail heart pump a little faster.
“Stark, how do my new wings look, man?” Sam addressed him over half of the table, looking excited like a little child. Wings, right. Something Tony should have been working on instead of wondering what the rest of his fellow members thought of him.
So I'll get back to a completely different fanfic in which I am now like 23k world deep and my dudes, just: aaaaangst. It's 90% aaaangst and I am like only half way done with it
He was five by the time he overheard his mother sobbing and crying, wishing for a normal kid. It wasn’t true, he did care for them, he guessed. His mother was funny and sweet, she baked delicious cookies.
”You want me to undress right now so you can continue to minimize our marriage to how I look?”
After the third week, Rhodey had enough though. He stomped into Tony’s work shop, telling Jarvis to lighten everything up and pulled Tony, who was still more passed out than awake, into a sitting position on his couch and then just stared down on him, with his arms crossed and his eyebrows pulled down.
Tony laid his head back and laughed in honesty. Everything was so beautiful, the sun felt warm and his best friend was here with him. He felt so glad to be alive for the first time in his life; this thought alone nearly made him tear up again. He could jump up and down in excitement, he felt invincible.
”I just wanted to say that I am sorry and also — We live together, Tony, we can’t keep on ignoring each other.” Like hell Tony couldn’t. Steve should just watch him avoiding to talking again forever.
”Did you stop loving me, Daddy?” His eyes were teary and his lip wobbling. Tony didn’t know that looking at a sad child could be the most devastating image he had ever seen but here he was.
He had a little genius son.
Tony has never been more disgusted with himself as when those thoughts had passed and all he saw was Steve’s painfully honest face.
Also Bruce came back. Tony felt like he could breath again for the first time in months; he wasn’t all alone anymore. Because that was the point right there. He wasn’t
nodded seriously and then ran off to the door, struggling with the handle for a second before running outside, shouting ”Uncle Bucky!”
”I like to believe that those skills weren’t the ones why you stayed with me.”
Well, Tony would
He sat up and rolled with his chair to the other end of his work shop so fast that he became dizzy for a moment. Steve’s touch still ghosting over him like 100 bugs, he couldn’t help but shiver.
Tony screwed his nose up and tried to lift his arms to get that boy off him but couldn’t even raise his arms a centimetre without groaning in pain.
(Also also - do your self the favour and go see Rocketman. Richard Madden is in it for a hot second and it's so worth it. Guys, I mean it. The hottest fucking second. Y'all just deserve that. My best friend and I were blown away (hint hint).) (Also Taron is also totally a reason to watch it, balding or not, gotta just love him).
It was Steve who dragged him out of his room in the end and made him sit down with all of them at the dinner table. Somebody had ordered pizza in but it all tasted like paper to Tony.
Barnes, hurt badly sure, but not killed. But was that making this treatment okay?
She had cried, looking at pictures of bombed cities, while he shrugged and told her that he’d fix it.  Now she always laughs so bright that her eyes crinkle up, when she sees another laughing kid, enjoying their new prosthetic.
”Yes,” Steve still had this little smile on his lips. Tony liked to watch it. ”Sometimes I swear he’s already smarter than I am.”
Still, hearing the kid confirming that he saw it, too, broke something in Tony he couldn’t quite put into words.
What he did have, though, were little tells. It took Tony a while to figure them out for what they were but now he just saw Rogers clenching his hands to fist, blinking twice as often or sigh in a tired way and Tony could see that he was about to snap.
What a killjoy.
”A-okay.”
Steve looked at him, honest, with his blue eyes shining like the damn moon but all Tony could see was yet another person on his list. Another person he had trusted, just to get betrayed. Because that seems to be all what people did around him. Waiting for him to tell them his weakness and then rip it right out of his chest.
Rogers huffed, it was in such an unamused way that it seemed as if it pulled every little sign of humor out of every aspect of the whole apartment.
Rogers answered with silence, he just crossed his arms more tightly about his chest and shot Tony a look that was a warning as much as dismissal in a way that was much louder than words.
They laid around in silence for a while longer. Tony was in deep thought about all the times he flinched. It was the closest thing he had to an emotion. Weird.
Every day in my life would have been different if it was a different emotion. Point here being: Every fucking thing I have ever felt was just a random fate kind of thing, which I don’t believe in, but you see where I am going, right? Everything had been fake, but this. Everything but
He needed to get the machine up and running again, because he cannot go on like that. He can’t only feel sadness and nothing else, he was
“What the actual
Not even he was that much of an asshole.
No. Not The Kid.
Rogers swallowed once, closing his eyes shortly, looking like Tony does, when he tries to sort out his thoughts, order them in different boxes. ”You were terrified,” Rogers huffed eventually, opening his eyes again,” but also so happy. When she told us that it had worked, you were all but crying.”
He just ruffled his blond hair then and looked at Tony with that tired sad look he always seemed to have going on. It was so weird to also see faint wrinkles around his mouth and eyes. Picturing Rogers laugh so often, that his face wrinkled up? He couldn’t. Rogers looked like one of those people who were just doomed to be sad, but maybe he wasn’t. Maybe he had been really happy before it all. It was more than possible, judging everything.
Tony nodded mockingly and began to stand up. ”Sure.”
He sighed deeply and went upstairs to get coffee and maybe a fruit bar to avoid blacking out again. He wanted to eat more than that but at the same time he really didn’t, so all that was left was an itch inside, leaving him unsatisfied with everything he did and he never wanted to turn all his emotions off as badly as he did now.
“That’s weird,” Tony answered dismissively.
All those people that were killed because he was ruthless.
Tony tapped an uneven rhythm on his chest and then startled out of it, when his fingers hit something hard. Confused did he pull out the chain around his neck, pulling his eyebrows down.
He wanted to beg them to just tell him the truth because Tony felt more and more as if he was losing his mind. It had felt so real, everything about his dream felt like he was reliving a moment of his life, and he just couldn’t make himself believe that it wasn’t real.
Natasha went straight to the point.This was an interrogation alright.
Tony had long since given up on acting like he wasn’t completely gone for the kid so he just smiled at him proudly, ignoring the fond look with which Steve stared at him.
4th of July, of course. Of course Tony was married to Mister America himself.
What if he stayed this way?
His mind was all but screaming at him to comfort Steve.
He was right, though, it was a hell of a thing to say.
”Is winter coming? It’s hot in here.”
But he didn’t do anything.
He had built up the hope that he might be back to his old self soon enough, but it just didn’t seem like anything would happen anytime soon.
“Did I hurt you?”
that they won’t catch on.
”Like I said, I’m grown up, I can go whenever I want.”
His smile hurt his face, it felt like it was tearing him apart. He jumped from the counter he sat on and walked to the door in hurried steps, his heart beating painfully fast against his sensitive ribs again.
and now you too? I am an adult, Steve, I am capable of knowing what I feel.”
, together.
. Fear flowed through his body and he made a fist with a hand, trying to not just throw Steve out.
He readied himself, suppressing another cough that would only make his throat burn like hell, and attempted to open his eyes again, blinking through the white lines that crossed his sight and then settled his gaze on the child.
The blond man stood in the lobby of the Stark tower, talking to Pepper, before turning in his direction and smiling. Tony had yet to get why people even smiled, but he returned it politely anyway.
”Can’t you just be my Daddy again?” Peter’s eyes were wide and innocent, looking up with so much hope that Tony suddenly understood why his future self had fallen so hard into the family life.
Peter babbled happily with his uncle, the two laughed a lot. Tony wondered if he had been a good father once. If he had been the one to bath Peter and get his fruit loops, before. If he had been the one to laugh with him.
Tony whips around in his seat and just stared at Rogers, who shook his head and turned the key to start the car.
Steve just nodded once more before looking him deep in the eyes, “Take care.”
His dream shouldn’t have been terrifying. He had bad and worse nightmares and this wasn’t one. He was sitting on a bench, seeing Steve throwing an easy laugh in Bucky’s direction. It shouldn’t have been terrifying at all, but, God help him, it was. Because he had never felt more alone and empty in his entire life. He woke up with a silent scream on his lips and an aching pain in his chest.
“I thought it was lying, Tony.” Tony huffed, yeah Steve sure had hoped it did. “I thought it was mocking me.” Steve looked him right in the eyes but still seemed really far away. “It had always told the others things to hurt them. Things only you knew so they wouldn’t question it right away. I had thought it was doing the same thing to me.”
Yet, he didn’t expect those words to hurt quite as badly as they did.
”Yeah,” he said lamely, shooting Steve a grin that had no specific meaning behind it, but Steve nodded as if it had. ”I’ll just —,” Tony pointed with his thumb in the direction of his bedroom. ”Good night.”
“I can try, but love is a complex thing, nobody feels it the same way.”
His life must have sucked.
As answer, though, he opened his arms wide in question. ”Congratulations! What am I supposed to do with that?”
do it right. It had always been this way and probably will aways stay that way, too. He wished he could do better, he really did, but what did it help.
Their son, Tony reminded himself.
”What was that?” Steve asked, a bit startled.
Also also, I have like 37k words for the Stucky fit I've been writing (and a few other thousand words for like 34 other fanfics and thousands of words of notes for 34 other stories - my dudes)
The most important day of his life must’ve been when he met his new roommate. He was a tall guy, looking him up and down and then saying something snarky with a bright laugh, Tony instantly didn’t mind his company.
problem and this is
Tony only nodded as an answer, avoiding to look any of them in the eye. As he sat down, the conversation carried on but he didn’t do anything to be included in it. He just sat down and observed. He looked at Clint, sitting cross legged on the other side of the coffee table, Lucky having his head on his thigh, his one eye on Tony.
”Peter!” The blonde tall guy exclaimed, making Tony cringe. ”Get off his chest.”
Fucking Steve.
So no, he did not long for it or something, he was just —
He has had so much anger inside him and it just exploded when he found out just
And hell did he want to spill all the beans. Wanted to tell her that for the past nights, when he did get sleep of exhaustion after all, all he could see were blurry images without any context or sense. That for the past nights all he heard over and over again was a voice whispering inside his head.
Steve’s gaze was cold as ice and yet burned him alive. Tony shrunk in on himself but Steve just kept looking. He had seen the man draw many lines when Tony came here and then close both eyes when Tony overstepped them.
Sam licked his lips and nodded with a thoughtful expression.
Tony hated that he thought the last one in a far more fond voice than he had any right to. Then again, he was his husband, so sue him.
Was the outfit too much? Too little? Did he want to show something off or should he go easy? He sighed and threw his hands over his eyes. He did not hate what he was wearing and that was as close a he could come to actually liking it, so it had to do. If not? He wouldn’t ca— well, he would. With all the emotions he had at his disposal right now he’d most likely hate himself more than ever before. But then again, he didn’t really know if he could feel heartbreak.
Bad enough, he avoided thinking about it so much, even more since his eating habits changed. He just didn’t need yet another thing to worry about. He buried himself in his work. If he stopped doing anything, everything would be so quiet, and he’d have nothing other to do than thinking about everything he doesn’t want to think about.
Steve raised an unimpressed eyebrow, obviously not buying anything Tony just said, but knowing that he was in no place to really argue about it either. He lost this right, ready to never gain it again ever.
Tony was about to just yell at him that he was mistaken if he really thought Tony would pull something like that.
Rogers had an incredulous expression as if he couldn’t believe how stupid Tony’s statement just was. ”You can’t just stop being a father,” he stated, disbelieving that he actually had to say that out loud.
Except he really couldn’t.
This wasn’t him drawing a line.
The silence spread out all around him, making it dark and ugly. He could taste his fear in the back of his mouth.
Tony huffed and shook his head some more. This was
“Good morning, Sunshine.” Tony leaned on the counter next to him, avoiding to step into Lucky’s drool puddle.“How was the morning run?”
“No, you listen. He — he could be
“Are you okay?” He asked, so damn concerned that Tony had to bite his lip to not tell him that he didn’t deserve the worry.
because you should know all that,” Rogers spoke up, placing the plate on the counter, finally facing Tony. ”You should know when your son was born. You should know your husband’s full name. You did know that. But now you don’t and you don’t even care about it, do you?”
11 years older than he thought he was. 11 years of which he had no memories. As far as he was concerned, he was still 27, company owner, playboy, billionaire, genius and oh yeah
But right now with the drink in his hands it just felt
”I —,” the kid hiccupped, grabbing his father’s shirt hard. ”I don’t want to not see Daddy anymore!”
Steve’s voice sounded oddly heavy with emotions when he answered. ”You two enjoyed to built things together. Like little robots, which I won’t even try to understand the schematics of.”
but you
Tony had no idea what he should say to this. It seemed like Steve really believed that he would do good with this kid.
in that moment was just because he was completely frozen in shock.
”After me and my great thighs, yes, sure.”
Rhodey was there for him through it all, mostly telling him to
. Everything bad that is. But it was like it was oddly dimmed, as if his body had drawn a line too, as to how much misery he could feel.
He looked around and laughed, confused and — and light. He felt
It sounded like it could be fun. Or maybe just a good get to know each other outing. Then again, he’d actually like to have a few hours to himself.
. He didn’t need their pity help, however, okay, he
stop calling him James, since this had been what Hydra called him too. Bucky couldn’t bear to think about that anymore, the nightmares were enough and he couldn’t stand to hear the name James when he was awake as well. Bucky had looked so hurt, all his emotions open in his eyes, he didn’t even bother to hide them; he didn’t hide anything in fact. He was completely open and honest, so trustworthy that Tony couldn’t help but feel empathy.
disappeared out of his mind and a whole other notion got to him.
”Sure thing, pal. Visiting hour is over in 10 minutes so make it quick. I’ll be outside with Sam and Petey.”
Let me know what you think of this chapter, I hope you liked it !!
and then you want to spend time with them all the time and when they leave it hurts.”
”How are you doing, Tones?” Tony didn’t think he’d ever hear Bucky sound so serious. He was usually always full of jokes, turning everything into something easier. Tony had silently appreciated that trait of his character for the past months.
Steve narrowed his eyes at him.
Tony sat back heavily and let out a breath, trying to get his thoughts in order. This wouldn’t be the only thing he’d failed today.
”Thanks,” Tony nodded and then coughed again, to which Tall Blonde smiled at him again and then settled the boy on his hip before giving Tony an ice chip.
He just needed to breathe for a second. Walk around freely for a bit, not thinking about anything, just being all by himself for just a moment.
“Do you know where I can find Steve Rogers per chance? Like, it was really nice meeting you but I really didn’t come for you.”
Clint huffed without any humor and walked to the foot of Tony’s bed. He eyed Tony up and down one more time.
Steve laughed behind him, knowing what he did. ”Don’t be cruel, Tony,” he said amused.
This night was all Tony could think of, whenever he was asked, what he thought what anger was.
“Tell me about it,” he demanded, purposefully vague. He didn’t know how Rhodey would react and needed to be able to have an easy way out, just in case that the question back fired on him again. His father had always been extremely mad, when he had asked what emotions felt like.
, all of the sudden, that Tony had to think just
Steve just didn’t seem to understand that ever since Tony had the chance to yell at him for all he’s worth, everything else just seemed numb. He’s said all he needed to say to Steve back then and now everything he did was empty and felt unimportant and all that’s left was the constant need to tell Steve that he was so
out again, but the kid reached out and pulled on his sleeve.
”Override code 4753 —”
The kid walked in, holding the hand of a tall guy with long brown hair and lack of a left arm. Tony was rude enough to not even hide that he was staring for a second. He knew that he was an impression in all of those people’s minds; a different person. Better make them used to who he actually was before they got their hopes up.
He closed his eyes and pressed his palms against his temples, groaning at his aching head.
“But you
Before he could even get out of the kitchen, though, the kid looked up from his fruit loops and then pulled his eyebrows together, a look that made his tiny face look like his father’s.
“You said you had some drawings I’d be interested in?” Tony prompted, raising one eyebrow and began to tap his fingers impatiently against the surface of his desk. Steve turned back his eyes on Tony in a second and cleared his throat.
Tony knew all that but he couldn’t stop either. He didn’t know what of him would be left when he dropped his defences. He didn’t want to find out either.
Tony ignored the low bad feeling in the bottom of his stomach, that told him that he truly had fucked up. Steve didn't even expect him to actually just wanting to ask questions anymore, he just thought bad something had happened that forced Tony to talk to him.
shield, finding its way into my chest and I just can’t shake it off. I am falling, Steve, and there is nothing to catch me.”
”Well, if I am this hard to put up with, then you should have rammed your shield into my head and not just into the reactor.”
He had his eyebrows drawn down, looking like he’d walk out of here and win a war.
Probably in the directions of What No, Don’t Be Ridiculous. Or something more reassuring.
”I don’t, didn’t, nor will I ever, in my whole existence, wear skinny jeans. I wear Ermenegildo Zegna suits, dear, can you even spell that?”
Tony looked up at him again, seeing him pouting and pointing to Tony’s arm, which true enough was in a cast, which spotted a crooked little dog, with big ears and uneven legs.
Steve looked
The first proof of hope.
Was this really what he thought of Tony?
Her tone was pure business. There was no question, there was nothing to answer, but Tony felt the strange need to defend himself. This was
Maybe dropping a few more balls, too.
from his chest, ”Daddy that’s a no-no word.”
Tony took another sip out of his cup and watched Sam’s eyes glow in amusement and challenge.
let me know what you think !!
, he couldn’t remember the last time he had been in so much pain; maybe never.
He fled into his room before Steve could do something stupid, though, like thanking him for not cheating or something.
”So,” he said slowly, not quite knowing if he even wanted to hear the answers anymore. ”I
another thing, he was always cold now. But that’s what heaters are for, right? No need to overthink that. Tony was a genius, he knew that this was in fact something to think about, but he just couldn’t. He had enough problems as it was and putting himself behind them all was the right thing to do.
Tony actually huffed,
back from the hospital.
Another week later, he found himself back in the exact same position, having spend the last hour just staring at his tablet like he was trying to set it spontaneously on fire. He was rubbing over the wedding ring on the chain around his neck, when a booming headache fell over him.
It was not, but Steve seemed to agree to silently pretend that he wasn’t lying.
”That was Bucky. Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes. He’s my best friend.”
”What did we use to do?” Tony asked after they both stood around in silence for some time, both deep in their own thoughts.
”I’ll bring him home in a sec, do you mind watching him a bit longer, though? I want to say goodbye to Tony.”
When he lay down in bed that night, sleep didn’t over come him, but more thoughts did. Funny enough, that he never thought of this outcome.
His next attempt had been to turn his head and try to listen, see if anyone was still here, or if whoever he went home with had left him alone.
In retrospect, Tony guessed that the most scary part about it was how long it actually took the others to figure out that he wasn’t him. Then again he’d watched the footage. The one hour that the others hadn’t deleted of the time he was
He had never felt as strong as he felt right now.
The man in front of him had always looked incredibly sad. But seeing his eyes swim in tears, that could be happy ones if they weren’t marked with so much miserable nostalgia, it nearly was too much for Tony.
Tony nodded determined, he knew himself, this will certainly be discussed anyway.
And Tony just
“That’s sick, dude. Ain’t no chick gonna break your heart, huh?”
“I grew up like that, I spend my whole life feeling things,” Steve answered with a sigh. His eyes looked equally determined and pained.
to tell somebody that. He needed to tell
In the back of his head, he knew that this was a bad idea and that it was definitely the best thing he’s done since waking up, because that kid deserved to have both his parents.
There was only so much he could do. He tried to take Steve out, but also give him space. Watch movies with him and actually listening with interested to whatever he had to say. And then Steve looked up at him and laughed as bright as the damn moon and Tony just knew he was gone. He didn’t know how it was possible, he knew that it
About what he did care, however, as far as possible, that is, was the response to his program. Many people had signed up to be the first one to donate emotions.
Fucking Steve.
“Tell you about what?” Rhodey’s eyes were half closed and he sat up as if nothing but will power was holding him up.
Tony woke up with another silent cry dying on his lips. He was breathing roughly, felt as if there wasn’t enough oxygen on this earth to ever fill his lungs again.
”Please don’t give them back to me.” Voice heavy, as if Tony had just asked something impossible of him. He looked back to the chain his hands, not really know what to do with them. They didn’t belong to him, he didn’t need them.
. As if Tony wasn’t working his ass off, bending over backwards to make everyone happy.
The only thing he had gotten out of this conversation was that he now felt bad when not attending the family dinners, so here he was. He couldn’t even remember what Rhodey had said that made him feel guilty when he ate in his own room, but he cursed his best friend for it every day.
He turned around and was ready to just lie back down in his bed, when Peter answered him. Tony only barely suppressed a roll of his eyes.
“Mr. Stark,” Steve said, extending his hand, which looked clean, but Tony still wrinkled his nose. He took it anyway.
and Tony’s head hurt bad enough as it was. And also-also, it wasn’t as if Tony didn’t
Steve nodded nonetheless as if it had made all the sense in the world for him.
He bets.
“Then fix it.”
Steve took another deep breath, but didn’t lose any posture. He stood straight, his head high, as if he was prepared for any outcome.
Tony blinked a few times and then looked away from the footage in front of him. He had seen enough but not what he was searching for.
“What’s it like?” Tony didn’t bother to take the screw driver out of his mouth before he asked the question, only half focused.
He didn’t know where he was. There was a warm body against his back, which was odd. All he remembered from his off time was the cold. It had always been so unbearably cold. He suppressed a shutter and choked out another cough.
If he was lucky, he might have about 15 minutes to find the words to explain what the hell had happened.
Steve blinked and then swallowed. He looked deeply moved, definitely more ready to cry than not. ”Yes! Yes, you bought that blanket. I hated it at first, because really? Spiders? But Peter loved it. He's still got it in his bed.”
He didn’t answer, though, he just keep on staring at Tony, who tried to look as open and honest as possible. The outcome of this conversation will shape his future, it will change who he is.
Tony ground his teeth, he hated not to know what was going on in the other's mind. Why did he act like that?
Tony scoffed, rolling his eyes and looking back at the child, who was looking what Tony had huffed about, one curl of hair falling in front of his eyes.
Rogers obviously wanted him to ask questions and get to know them, to make sure he’d finally relearn how to act around the kid. This morning hadn’t been the first time he had made him cry and he was honestly sorry about it. He got why Rogers wanted him to finally learn how to talk to a child.
Fucking Steve.
Steve had always looked at him questionably when he had so much as even looked in the direction of the door. As if he was about to ask Tony if he needed company out there. If they wanted to go out together as family.
Steve ruffled his hair again before getting up. ”Peter, just put your plate in the dishwasher and you’re allowed to go. I’ll take care of the rest tonight.”
Tony didn’t know if he should fear what Rogers will tell him now. If he should be terrified, just because the man in front of him looked haunted, as if his worst nightmare might just come real soon.
Tony pulled his eyebrows together. What the fuck was this man on about?
”I — I am not 27 anymore, am I?” Tony asked, his voice wavering and all but breaking but he couldn’t care less about it right now.
to be just joy.
and a bunch soldiers together who were literally trained to notice odd behavior.
Rogers’s shoulders fell a bit, as if he had been hoping to this point that Tony would deny that he didn’t care. Tony sure could’ve but why would he? He had too much to figure out, to also be able to make other people’s lives easier.
They ended up standing opposite to each other, just smiling in silence that was equally weird and comfortable. Tony just knew that this was the closest he had ever gotten to actually feeling fully content with himself and everything.
Steve huffed a little laugh, still sounding a bit watery.
This thought was out of his head in mere seconds. He didn’t think he had acted
What was he supposed to do? Ask?
Fucking Rogers.
Steve pushed his hand away with a cooky grin, “Don’t be mean, Tony, you’re ruining it.”
Rogers nodded and got up. He pressed one kiss to the top of his son’s head, who had closed this eyes, still having one of his hands in his Uncle’s hair, holding on to it.
Tony looked up into his eyes, searching for —
”No,” Rogers answered slowly, sounding insulted by the idea.
It was not fine.
' so he thought about more reasons for his sudden sickness when he just thinks about meat. Thought about death and destruction and after a while all he could see when he looked at meat was blood and suffering. His head was playing games with him and he knew it but he couldn’t help it either. And it also didn’t hurt anyone, so whatever.
Steve looked slightly amused by it, till the amusement  got washed away from his face so fast that Tony really had trouble telling if it had ever been there to begin with.
“You know that I know — what?” Steve prompted, looking to the world like a lost puppy.
He brought the glass to his lips, his head yelling at him that it wouldn’t help him anyway and that this hole in his chest was so much more than just the missing part of his sternum, but he didn’t pay attention to it.
Rhodey swallowed hard, seemingly also swallowing about 50 reasons why this was bullshit down too. “Stay on point, Tony, this — ”
that Tony would just feel anxious if he asked questions about the whole thing and that the best way of handling it was to wait until Tony was ready to talk.
”So I guess the dog tags around my neck are yours?” He asked, his voice sounding oddly loud in silence of the big hospital room. Definitely a private one. At least he still had his money in the future, better than nothing, he guessed.
”Eight.” Rogers had gritted his teeth, Tony felt like he had won, but he didn’t feel better. It occurred to him later that the reason for that could be that he was playing a dirty game and talked as if he was winning when really he just was the only one even in on it, the only person who would even make something like this about winning.
Something in him broke some more as he finally realized that no one would save him. This was his fight, and there was no chance for him to conquer. He wouldn’t even know where to
Tony shook his head, still just staring at Steve. He just got ripped from his thoughts when Peter pulled on his sleeve, pointing to his picture. He was searching the 17 now. Before Tony could point it out, though, Steve ruffled Peter’s hair, ”Don’t cheat, Pete. You know what comes after 16.”
Rhodey stepped one sharp step closer to him, leaning down, breathing hardly.
Peter continued making motor sounds while playing with the bright red car, that was missing a wheel.
And that had seemed to be it. One year, he thought he had time. But, in the end, everything just runs past you.
And it wasn’t a total lie, of course not, but he sounded so
“Steve Rogers. I am here because of the Art Collection. I’ve called Pepper, who’d told me that you might be interested in some of my art works.”
Tony scolded and then sat down heavily, as far away from the obvious plate for a kid that was already set on the table.
It felt strangely heavy. Not because it was definitely pure gold, but because it was more than that. It had memories attached to it, it was as if Tony could grasp them but then they went all blurry and far away again.
That night Tony learned that he could feel pain just fine, when Howard gave him a full five to his cheek, before leaving his room in a rush, muttering
Rhodes got up and sat down next to him, putting Tony’s feet on his lap.
Tony turned around sharply and looked Steve right into his eyes, something he hadn’t done in like
He had seen many expressions on this man’s face, this hadn’t been one of them. Tony swore he could feel the paint being pulled off the walls at the gaze.
“Don’t be like that.”
Food has never been his problem. A main topic in his life, yes, but never a problem. He used to do so well, really. Food was his anchor, his safe spot, but in a healthy way. The thing he had control over, when he had nothing.
