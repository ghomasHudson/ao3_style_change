He hears Tony before he sees him, and the omega comes into the living area with a big grin on his face. It’s something he hasn’t seen before, and he’s thrilled to the bone to have Tony here and happy. His omega should always be happy. Steve should feed him more. Maybe Steve should learn new recipes from this era, like the Mexican food Tony likes to order sometimes, or the Thai. He doesn’t like spicy food, but he knows Tony doesn’t mind it.
“Yes. He’s—Father, he’s so frustrating. He doesn’t do anything I tell him to, and everyone I talk to about it seems to think it’s my fault that he—well, he ended up in the hospital with a false heat. And I’m ashamed I didn’t see that he was that stressed, but I don’t know what to do to get him to be the omega he should. You’ve seen him, I presume. How he acts. I just, I know this is a confession, but I’m in need of guidance.”
He’s tired, worn down from spinning the engine as fast as the suit could go so that the whole helicarrier wouldn’t come down. The suit itself is once again wrecked, but he has to stay inside of it, letting the sweat trickle down while the blood from a small gash sticks to the inside of the helmet. He sits calmly at the table with the Captain, head hung low over the death of Coulson. Coulson who had been his contact with SHIELD since Fury had introduced them. The one who had pulled him into this with a rather desperate plea in the form of a data dump.
. He can’t conceptualize a world in which he’d never done these things.
Steve’s mind grinds to a halt. This is exactly like Iron Man told him. Every part of him cries out to refuse Tony, to say he’s not worthy. That he doesn’t want to be Tracy’s husband who just wanted the heats as if they were his by right.
“Say my name, Tony.”
That desk, that couch, this floor. He’s going to take Tony on all of them, legs hooked up to Tony’s face while he drives into his mewling Omega.
“And what about Steve? I know you’re fighting, but I can’t be yours if he’s going around—”
“Fuck, Rogers, what you
“You don’t dictate the terms of this, Steve. You just agree to them when I give them to you.”
That’s when the rest of the crew stumbles in, and Banner hones in on Natasha. Tony remembers somewhat from their conversations how Bruce came to be here, and it’s not looking good for Soviet Nat. He asks her whether she knew, and of course, Natasha deflects into concern for Banner. Feigned or not, Banner doesn’t take the bait.
Steve thinks that even if Tony weren’t Howard’s son, he would stick around anyway just to contain the damage that Tony has done to his life, for the sake of everyone in Tony’s.
It’s been another week since his conversation with Nat. Tony successfully downs his fifth pill, and being in the home stretch is grating on Steve something fierce. He’s going to take good care of Tony. Better than the kind of care Tony has heaped upon himself. He just has to make sure that Nat doesn’t interfere.
He lays there for several hours, still thinking about Tony.
“Can’t wait.” Tony winks and breezes from the room as if Nat and Bucky weren’t there at all.
“I’m not mad Tony. That’s the worst part. I’m just disappointed. Because now it’s not a question of whether I can accept Iron Man or not. You are Iron Man. You’re him, and Iron Man makes the kind of decisions a leader does, not a partner. We can’t be— we can’t be that. I’m so sorry.”
As for the text, distance makes the heart grow fonder, and if Steve wants to lay hands on Tony, he’s going to have to come to him. It’s a good day to be Tony Stark.
“Steve, please, don’t make me wait. I can’t—” Steve swallows him whole while pressing a single digit to the tight circle of Tony’s ass, the rhythm of sucking and circling Tony’s hole in seamless tandem. Despite the liquid warmth of Tony, the little circle of muscle holds Steve at bay for moments before Steve presses in. But once inside, it protests the removal by suctioning onto Steve as though Tony’s ass never wants him to leave. The push-pull reminds him of Tony’s heat, and even like this, Tony’s hole is so greedy to be filled. If this is all Steve is good for, it’s enough. It has to be enough.
“Your funeral.”
This is dangerous. Tony is dangerous.
“And you, you want me?”
Of course, that’s when Nat strolls in, right on time to throw a spanner in the workings of Steve’s inner turmoil.
“You mean it?” Tony asks as they land on the platform of the tower.
“We have contracts for production of armor and vehicles, not bribes! Now, that whole thing with Christine Everhart?”
“Be a good boy and take it, Tony. And then I’ll give you what you need.” Tony cries out in
“Diner across the street?” Bucky nods and they make for the elevator. They don’t talk on the way down, Bucky, per usual, sensing that Steve isn’t going to open up until he feels that he’s in a secure place. It’s good to have such a close friend, and Steve is grateful that he’s had the opportunity to have a second chance with Bucky.
“Over there? Closer to you? But—” His wings puff up at the thought that they’re wanted, that Steve wants Tony over there. By Steve. In Steve’s arms. Like Tony has always dreamed about.
“I don’t think so, well, maybe. Maybe one person. But everyone else in my life is upset with me. They wouldn’t spit on me if I was on fire.”
“No, wait.”
“Tony.” Steve had turned around now, taking a step across his invisible line. If he could just get Cap to come the entire way–
“I think, I think I’ve changed my mind. We can’t just– no!” Tony was fighting it and losing.
“Okay, one, that involves telling a secretive heat service, well, a secret, which isn’t secret if you tell anyone, and two, how in the hell does spit swapping now include not knowing whose spit you’re swallowing? What, am I going to wear the Iron Man helmet and a long sleeve shirt to cover the reactor? I’ll look like I’m really bad at cosplay!” Well this wasn’t happening. He could imagine right now just how hot a moan coming from his voice modulator would be, like a cyborg cat in heat.
“Bucky, please! I’m not sure—”
“You know, I had this thing put into my head. This dream. And it seems normal at the time, it seems right. I was an Avenger. That I was more than what they made me. That—” she pauses, “I want you to understand, the red room only takes Omegas as trainees. It’s their long held secret.”
“—Oh what, I can’t be on the field? Yeah? Well what are you going to do about it?”
“Tony,” he calls. Tony perks up, dropping the stained towel he’s wiping his hands with.
“Tony you’re being an idiot–” Steve was reaching behind his helmet for the safety latch, Tony’s head bowed in acquiescence.
Tony does.
Steve has already been in him so many times, but he treats each time as though it was the first, teasing and stroking, drowning Tony in sensation. He feels each touch more keenly than the last, the slide of Steve’s cock against the seam of him an unhinging of his person.
Even if this is all there is between them, Steve is sharing it with Tony, and nothing can take that away. He shivers, just thinking that Tony might still ask him to stop, to go. And Steve would have to. But he’s hopeful that Tony won’t. That Tony will keep him here in this twilight place, where time doesn’t dwell, where for once he’s thinking of nothing but this moment, here.
He’ll have Tony, whole and complete, whether Tony puts up a fight or not. He wants to swallow Tony whole, to consume every bit of what he squeezes out of his mate. All he needs is time.
“Oh god, I’m so sorry. I’m so fucking sorry. I thought he was going to court you proper–”
But the alternative is that the world ends, so Tony figures he’s forgiven for the suicidal decision making.
The workshop is where Tony can be found the majority of the time, and today is no different. He’s filthy, grease slicked in his hair, patches of iron dust all over his hands and bare feet. He’s also gorgeous, his brown eyes taking that sheen of dark chocolate, as they do when Tony is intensely focused. Guns n’ Roses blares in the background, which Steve only knows because Tony loves bands from that time period.
They make it to the bathroom, Tony’s eyes slitted with exhaustion as Steve puts him down, helping him stand on wobbly legs. Tony leans against the wall as Steve makes to fill the tub with water.
The man gets ahold of his wrist and yanks Tony back to stand chest to chest with him. At first Tony tries to struggle away, but Bucky gets a hold of his other arm, and soon they’re both clamped down, ending the tussle.
But Steve wasn’t looking at him. No, Steve was focused on the front of Tony’s pants, where Tony suddenly realized he had a full-on erection straining to escape.
“Ha! Guess I’m that replaceable, huh? Harsh, but true.”
“I’m getting to it. The current laws at the time deemed omegas to be property. That was only changed in around 1963, though omegas still didn’t have the right to vote on their own until 1967. At that time, suicide rates went down to 200,000 in 1964 and 145,000 in 1968, with lifetime attempts at a stable 750,000. So better, but still not great.
This is step one.
He’s dressed by the time the suit arrives, and Tony steps into the suit like a babe in his mother’s embrace. The familiar hum of the suit lights him up, and Tony smiles, closing his eyes as JARVIS takes him to his next destination.
“Not there. Not the chest. I have scarring.”
“Are you, Stark?” Well, shit. It’s possible that Barton knew he was Iron Man, and told Loki. Or there’s some other manner that the god is able to tell what is under the armor. He’s going to have to deal, however. And if he’s going to suffer through this, he’ll do it with some libations.
hurts him is not in the list of things he has responses for.
“I know. But I guess I just wanted to feel something good.” Tony gets out of the car then, and Steve follows. There’s a little trail of scent that drags behind Tony, and Steve floats on it to the elevator and up into the penthouse.
“It’s just, whatever this alien did to me, it has me crazy horny. It’ll pass, but… it’s so hard to concentrate on anything but—but you.” Tony scrunches his arms to his side and cants his hips back a little bit, just to give his cock some much-needed breathing room before he spills over the floor like a pathetic teenager.
They’ve done this before, as taboo as it’s apparently supposed to be, and Steve works him with the familiarity he has of his own body. One finger and then two, twisting and spreading, and soon enough Steve is inside, moving with every slide of Tony’s body across the bed. Their fingers entwine and Steve ripples, every end of his sinuous undulation ending in a sharp jolt inside Tony.
Tony darts out of the room.
“Right! It’s worth a try, and if it’s successful, we can let more in from the street and get them to safety. Yes, it’s a plan, I mean, I bet I could crop dust the entire street anyway, but that would be complicated—” Tony is muttering to himself, looking into a microscope and fiddling with the lenses. Who knew they’d gotten so small.
“All right.” Tony grabs his shirt and pants, and walks out, leaving Steve alone with his newfound and unwanted desires.
Bucky, just as Bucky saved Steve. It’s an old, human story, and yet here they are, rending it apart with a vicious emotion’s claws. Everyone knows that two Alphas living in close conditions can often become competitive, but this is something else.
“That’s, wow, that’s really nice of him.”
“Say it again, Tony. Say you don’t consent.” Steve breathed the words down his neck, the press of his body hot and heavy on his. He felt powerful, standing up to his Alpha.
Tony tosses his head back and whips his head to the side. It’s so much sensation. His body is fire, melting into the mattress and being turned inside out. Steve is remaking him, molding every crevice of his body into something that’s solely for him. When Tony opens his eyes, his cheek pressed firm to the bed, he sees Bucky there, watching with a hunger that should frighten him. He sucks in a breath, thrilled and terrified all at once, watching on a cliff’s edge for Steve and his orgasm.
“Tony, Tony it’s ok, I’ve got you. I have you sweetheart. Going to make you mine. Be a good boy for me, relax, let it go. You’re here.” And it works. Like nothing but JARVIS telling him where he is and the date and time has ever worked. The panic subsides, Steve running his hands up and down Tony’s arms and shoulders, calming and soothing.
On the Quinjet, Steve echoes Tony’s concerns about Loki’s capture, and Tony reigns in a smart comment. Tony is a real actor. Fuck Broadway; pretending to not be a superhero was the real qualifier for theatre.
“Nothing much, just thinking.” Tony is chastened by his behavior. He’s always so reckless. With the team, with his life, with his stuff, with other people’s hearts. That’s why he’ll never have someone like Steve. Bucky seems like he could handle Tony. Steve does too, but Steve doesn’t deserve to be hurt. Tony isn’t sure he
He strides over, thinking Tony has overslept, and makes to pull the covers off. Underneath is Tony, shivering in the throes of some illness. Tony is completely curled in on himself and is squeezing his legs to his chest while he pants out little breaths that sound off. The smell is cloying, lovely, and Steve reaches out to the bed to steady himself. It’s bearing down on him, and it’s overwhelming.
“I think—I was an omega. I was so broken, physically. I needed medical treatments all the time. Treatments my mother could barely afford. And I was a burden on everyone. My mom, Bucky. I couldn’t even have proper heats, I was so useless. No one would ever want me. I didn’t want myself. If you’re asking who the weakest omega I knew was, it was me.” He looks at Iron Man desperately. Needing some kind of confirmation that the man inside the suit understands him. Knows exactly what Steve is talking about.
“For you sweetheart. I’m hard for you,” Steve promises. Then Tony moves, and Steve lets out a sound like Tony is
Steve’s eyes turn hooded, eyelashes fluttering over his now darkened eyes.
“I… made a mistake, and my husband ended up hospitalized. The team—the team isn’t on speaking terms with me for the most part.”
It’s utterly wrong.
“I’ve really messed up. I think—I think I’m a horrible person.”
“Good.” Steve kneads at Tony’s ass, gripping the pliant flesh in his palms, wondering what Tony might need next that he can provide.
When Steve pulls out and moves, little arcs of sensation travel up his entire body and he gasps, enraptured. Tentative, but then more sure, Steve shifts and thrusts again. Tony cries and wails, his eyes scrunching closed as tears leak out the sides. It’s so very good. It’s the best thing Tony has ever been, has ever done. He doesn’t know why he ever avoided this.
. It’s your hubris. Not your principles. You don’t have a problem telling people to accept your authority no matter what state you’re in.” Tony pulls the glass away from his mouth, looking infuriated. His mouth works a couple of times before closing.
“They’re closer than I thought, an hour away,” Steve said. Tony sighs and gets up.
“But for how long? Tony’s life, his livelihood, is at stake here.”
, you love being stuffed full, don’t you? Maybe I’ll have to let Stevie have you again if this is how you are when you have two cocks working you over.”
“For this month, yes. We’re a little short-staffed. We’ll be seeing a new priest soon. An omega! I’m very excited. As a beta, I always have trouble reaching them, even though we’ve been helping omegas for years. They have reason to be scared though, I suppose. But! It’ll be good to have an omega around to help guide the flock.”
Like an eclipse, Steve mounts him there on the floor, blotting out anything and everything.
“Tony—” Steve looked pained, yet there was no way Tony had sympathy for any Alpha who was told they would have the privilege of spending heat with an Omega. What other purpose did Alphas even serve, anger tainting his own scent causing it to go slightly acrid.
“Ok, I don’t want to join your super secret boy band, and nor does Mr. Stark. If I have to associate with people, the likelihood of my survival is directly related to the size and quality of my rag-tag group of associates. Are you a welder, Fury? Maybe a lock-picker? A snake-thrower who can throw snakes at my enemies? No? Well then, I’m not sure you can help me.” He’d heard of SHIELD. They’d ghosted about the perimeters of his life, but he’d never done anything naughty enough to warrant their attention. Besides Iron Man, apparently. And to be fair to Fury and his little Avenger’s initiative, a SHIELD agent would know what to do if the world broke down, because a SHIELD agent already lives in a world without law anyway. They’d seized property before, just never his. But Tony wasn’t interested in making it easy. SHIELD would inevitably want what all bloated, militaristic intelligence agencies wanted: weapons. And when they came for them, Tony would slap them with so much lawyer-y paperwork, their little agent heads would spin like the exorcist chick.
“I’ve never seen anything like this. The sheer amount of circumstances that have to align for this to be possible is unprecedented. But ultimately, it is binding.” The lawyer is from outside of SHIELD, the organization that Peggy ended up founding, along with Howard, that happened upon what they thought was his remains. The lawyers at SHIELD had already declared the contract valid. Steve thought he would try one more time to see if that was the case.
, to get satisfaction from the man.
“JARVIS, run a scan, see if you can see any foreign DNA floating around.”
“It’s a betrothal, we didn’t know each other that well. And I don’t think he wants it.”
The next day he does his run and then goes to SHIELD. He half expects Edith to be waiting for him, but instead, it’s just Natasha.
“Tony.” It’s Bucky. Fuck, of course, it’s one of the people on his mind. It’s like he’s calling them to him with his fucked up thoughts.
“Add fat to the pan, turn it to medium.” Tony does as Steve says, before stopping and waiting for further instruction.
“—to hurt you—” Tony is
They make it up to the tower in record time, all six of them eying Loki from his position on the floor.
“Iron Man, these things are still coming.”
“How dare you.” She walks straight up to Steve, with his burnt hands and bullet holes scattered in his arm and punches him right in his wounds. Again, like with Rhodes, he lets it happen. They are entitled to their feelings, and at least one good shot at him.
Her face contorts as she takes swift strides to the bed, teeth bared in a rictus of hunger. When her broken fingers reach for his arm and shoulder, he almost lets her bear down on him, mouth poised to bite before instinct kicks in and he launches her away from him with his foot. She clatters to the floor, not bothering to protect her head or body, a puppet without strings.
“Make your move, Reindeer games.” Captain comes to stand next to him, agitated. Tony thinks the Captain could handle a little more tossing around. Maybe straight into Tony’s unoccupied fantasies. He curbs that impulse as soon as it crops up. The time for a pubescent boy’s indulgences is not while there’s a genuine super villain on his knees in front of them.
“Right. Army.” They are so fucked. Out from the hole comes humanoid figures armed to the teeth with alien technology. Tony doesn’t know what their guns or other weapons do, and while he’s not eager to find out from personal experience, he knows he’s here to save as much of New York as he can. It’s what he wants to do; he steels himself before charging at the incoming soldiers, Loki be damned.
His face is wet.
He only cared on the pettiest level that the government had the suit. What were they going to do? Attach pistols to its legs like that grindhouse movie?
A click behind him has Tony turning. The door had blocked it before, but Tony now has an excellent view of a camera pointed at the bed, a red light blinking at him.
“I wouldn’t care, Tony,” he promises.
“What? I do not control the speed at which my motivation to listen to you dies.”
“Maybe you wouldn’t mind checking for me. I’m not so great with computers myself, honestly, and I don’t want to break anything.” Steve hasn’t used a computer more than a few times.
He walks up the steps to the entrance, his hand trailing along the handrail as he does. He pushes the doors open and walks up until he’s standing in front of Steve’s old apartment door. Another letter and a StarkBox lock hang from the doorknob.
“Are we done here?” Cap asks. From the look on the man’s face, they most certainly are.
biology. He was– he identified as an alpha. Not omega. Absolutely not. No matter if Steve was about to put him down and mount him, he would always be Tony Stark, alpha. And further, maybe he’d always cherished the idea of finding a romantic partner, not someone who looked down on him like Steve.
“You paying attention to me now, doll? That’s right. Good little omega. My fucking good boy. I loved watching you take him. Maybe I’ll let him use you again, as a public service, but you’ll always be mine—”
“There’s always this. There’s SHIELD,” Iron Man protests.
“I will. And thank you, again.” Steve feels like a burden he’s been carrying has been lifted. The catharsis is profound. He hasn’t apologized to Tony yet, but he feels like he can. Like things can possibly be okay.
It’s then that Sam’s serious expression cracks, and the tiny upward tilt of his lips is like a blessing. Just because Tony can survive without Sam’s approval doesn’t mean he
“Steve, Steve I need your fingers. I want to fuck myself on them.” Tony reaches down and grabs at Steve’s hair, gently guiding him up and down. Steve is helpless to challenge that. He pulls his arm loose from under Tony’s thigh and reaches for his hole. He finds it wet with slick, already producing just enough for Steve to get his fingers in without hurting Tony. Tony’s hole is furled, and the gooey essence that leaks from him squelches lewdly against his finger. Tony opens ever so slightly, and Steve presses his advantage, delicately tracing the strong muscle, feeling every wrinkle and contraction. Just the tip of his finger is dipped into Tony’s beautiful heat, and Steve’s desire is sent soaring. Slowly, so slowly, he presses in.
“Of course. I’ll be in the nest.” He gets out of the tub and grabs a towel, wiping his body down with it. He’s not clean, exactly, but he did get most of his groin washed off.
“I never thought it would be like this. I’m glad it was you.” And, he is. The alpha feeling is still there inside him, but it’s less upset than he would have guessed. He’s always liked Steve, always wanted the other man.
“Hmm. Well, what did he say when you apologized?”
“Tony, baby, it’s ok.”
It’s awful.
“Sounds like you’re having a midlife crisis. Let me be the first to inform you that I won’t be staging an intervention.” There are stars in Tony’s blue eyes, the glint of Extremis tingeing them a lighter blue. He’s going to bind and leash each one.
“I like Whole Foods best. Prepare to spend an arm and a leg there though.”
“No. I like making you food. I like it when you eat what I make.”
“But going forward things will be different. I understand.” Steve agrees.
The war had taken all of the time he would have had to learn how omegas worked, how they functioned. He’d only had a singular view that omegas were as unattainable as they were vapid.
When he gets down, he sits at one of the tables there and watches the ebb and flow of traffic. He pulls out his phone to fiddle with, as he has nothing else. He’s nervous, uncertain what Natasha will say or do. Really, this is the first time they’ll be able to have a conversation about everything that’s happened thus far.
With a sigh, Steve leaves two 20s on the table and walks out.
“I’m going to the gym. I need you to know I’m not staying here full time. I have an apartment in Brooklyn. We’ll talk later.” Tony sees Steve deflate, all of the anger subsiding into something sadder and frustrated. It makes him want to soothe Steve, but then he remembers he doesn’t care at all. Steve is bringing all this upon himself. They’re fine. Both of them are fine just being teammates and not needing to get along outside the battlefield. This is as good as it gets and as good as it ever has to be. Steve doesn’t have to live here either. Not if he doesn’t want to. Yeah, it’s good.
“Why do you ask?” It’s casual, and anything but.
Unlike the first gender, which was coded in the individual’s body, the changes for being omega or alpha were circumstantial based on the parent’s contribution; scientists didn’t always understand what made for the change, but that it had something to do with stress. Every alpha contained the equipment to be an omega and vice versa, but it acted recessively based on whatever hormones were in the parent’s body at the time. Thus, Steve knew for certain that he’d just been placed in a stressful environment and that his temperament was more suited to being alpha.
“Steve, please, I can’t—”
The time that one of the first Kaijus in Sicily snapped a claw off right next to Tony’s body, almost impaling him. Or when they both passed out after taking a direct punch to their container, bodies tumbling and hitting the wall. There’s been worse times than this.
They’ve left the Avengers Quinjet, though he doesn’t know how they got away otherwise. He’s not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.
“Do we know why Tony lasted as long as he did without turning?”
. Want me to get on my knees, show you my neck. You marked it, it’s yours. You could take me now right here, on this floor. I’m such a whore you know I couldn’t deny you what’s yours by right. I mean, I’ve probably taken loads of knots, right? You want yours to be the one I remember.” Tony finishes his rant with his breath puffing up into Steve’s face. Every word has his hair standing on end. The scent alone will haunt his dreams. His breathing is shallow and he’s ungodly hard in his underwear, which is thankfully tight enough to keep most of his mass hidden from Tony. But it’s not enough. Tony looks down and a sly smile crosses his face.
Tony tore through each bag with more fury than Fury, inhaling and tossing them all over the head of SHIELD’s floor. Nick seemed like the kind of guy who didn’t hire someone to clean due to paranoia, and it gave Tony a special pleasure to think of Nick having to pick up after him.
“Still upset by my brash nature? You’ll have to get used to it, sunshine. I’ll be begging for you come my heat. What will you think of me then, I wonder?” Steve tries to balance the sensation of Tony saying he’ll beg for Steve against the idea that Tony will beg at all. These things seem incongruent sensations, and they won’t reconcile. Steve feels momentary jealousy and agitation at the thought that Tony has spent time with other alphas and betas. That he’s taken knots and other men’s cocks freely, as if his body was to be used. Steve doesn’t want to use Tony, he wants to worship him.
Steve turns his hand, his index finger slipping down Tony’s crack. It’s not the right angle, and Steve wrenches Tony’s pants down in response. The cold air on his ass is harsh, but Steve starts to rub his warm hands over the globes of Tony’s ass, and it feels immediately better.
“On. Now. I won’t ask again before I toss you into the shower.” Natasha will do it, Tony is certain. Begrudgingly, he starts to undress, uncaring that Natasha is watching him closely, as if he can’t possibly dress himself on his own.
. Perfect little slut, just for me.”
There’s dead silence for a moment as they wait.
“I’d say beggars can’t be choosers, but…” Pepper trailed off.
Tony first goes for the eggs, cracking them on the counter in a messy crunch that leaves flakes of shell all over, including in the eggs themselves. Then he doesn’t use oil in the pan, using a fork to mix the eggs up, which Steve knows scrapes the non-stick off the pan itself and into the eggs.
“Clint accidentally drank the expired kreyla juice the other day. He didn’t quite make it to the toilet before vomiting up the purplest upchuck I’ve ever seen. Kreyla juice is blue, so it was unexpected.”
Clint’s pig is stumbling around, knocking into street signs and parked cars with impunity, but it’s not falling over. Steve tosses his shield at the pig’s head and it cracks into it, causing the animal to slump over. He isn’t sure if it’s dead, but at this point they’d take anything.
“Tell me to fuck you. Tell me where you want me.” Steve is running his hands over Tony, his ass, thighs, back. Wherever the man can reach as he has Tony pinned to the bed. It’s compulsive, reverent with need. Now, it doesn’t seem like so much of a battle over Tony’s body, but a protracted siege.
“So you did something stupid, and you’re here to try and un-stupid yourself. What’d you do?” Trevor sounds accusatory.
“Tony. Want you to come for me, baby. Want it so much.”
in the home.
“Well if you’re willing to admit your mistakes, he won’t turn away from you.”
Thousands. There are thousands.
His heart is starting to pound, and his hands are clammy with sweat. He pulls his elbows tight to his body, his shoulders clenched together.
Steve is silent. He’s been quieter since the accident. Maybe he’s punishing Tony. Maybe he’s teaching him.
Finally, he’s in front of the door, and he swiftly breaks down the number lock there as well, thanking the powers that be that it’s not dissimilar to the one from his room and that disabling it doesn’t seem to be setting off any alarms.
“Gonna to make you into something else, gonna make you this, just this, for me. Want to fill you up, make you complete and mine.”
“Can’t wait, stop making me wait!” The impertinence of Tony practically shouting those words against Steve’s lips makes him chuckle into Tony’s mouth and break the kiss. His sassy Omega wants his Alpha. It’s better than he could have ever anticipated. Steve lets up off of Tony, leaning back on his knees as he grasps Tony’s hips off the bed, hauling his ass towards the apex of Steve’s thighs. He pets Tony’s thighs, fingers dragging down the sparsely haired legs and back up to the perky ass that’s staring him in the face.
“Um, yes, well, I have a brochure for you, if you ever need to call, or you can give it to your omega.”
Pepper and Steve both. Tony has never
“Listen, I know this is hard for you, but we do have to work together on this. Don’t make this more difficult for yourself. I will enforce strict discipline.”
Steve aims the shield like a bludgeon, slamming it again and again into the face mask and torso of the armor.
This is their first kiss. Even at the marriage ceremony, they’d only bitten each other. Now, as Steve strokes at the gland where he made Tony his, he feels for the first time that they’re one. There’s hope here. Small and tentative, but blossoming nonetheless.
Food finished, they all meander back to the tower, Steve and Thor righting flipped over cars that they pass by. Tony’s armor is heavy around him, the power barely able to maintain his ability to walk. He’s this close to slinking out of the armor and letting it fall to the ground, but his pride won’t let him.
“Fine.” Tony’s eyes roll back in his head and he slouches back up to the justice. Steve thinks they’re going to have to work on comportment as well.
Whatever happens, he’s standing in front of Tony’s workshop. He sighs, and walks in.
And Bucky might just let him.
“Does it matter?” Stall, just stall until they get here.
“Iron Man.”
“I cleared out this corner over here.” Tony points to a spot where indeed there’s no furniture. He tucks the pad into the corner and goes back for the blankets.
“He’ll be ready to go when we find out where Loki is.”
“Mouth. Suck me.” Those words make Steve shiver and he leans forward, thankful that Tony’s gland is on his left side and they’re laying on both their right sides. He brings his lips closer, feeling the heat radiating off of the little pucker of flesh. He licks once, and the taste hits him. He jerks, like a puppet on wires, and
His orgasm hits him like waves crashing again and again, roiling forward and back out to sea. Tony is lost there, and he’s as found as he can be while he’s with Steve. And Steve, amazing, devoted Steve, drinks all there is from Tony’s deflating cock, licks his fingers that were inside Tony as he stalks up on all fours to give him a searing kiss.
“Tony is mine.” The look Nat gives him is calculated. Steve’s forgets all of his reservations, his concerns. He can’t help but look at this interaction between Nat and Tony and see himself as the better option. Tony will be an Omega and Steve is going to mate him as soon as the change is complete.
SHIELD is a nondescript building not far from the Tower, and he finds himself in a barren conference room, much like the one in which he examined the contract between Tony and himself.
The world hasn’t changed much.
He doesn’t linger, though he very much wants to. Omegas are too tempting by half. The scent is positively overwhelming now, and he wants to keep licking and sucking at the gland. Technically it’s within his rights. He could mouth at Tony’s throat for a good while before laying on a bite, or he could bite Tony, then take him home and scent him to his heart’s content.
“Sir we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.” The next plan Tony has in mind is quite possibly a gambit. It’s foolish, reckless, and Tony is all about it.
Before Afghanistan, it’d been about fifteen years for Tony. He could acknowledge that maybe that hadn’t been the right play. Now, he couldn’t put his body off for much longer.
“No, should be fine, thank you for your time.” Steve gets up from the hideous looking chair and makes sure not to bump his head on the ceiling.
“I’ve had such luck with this program, honestly. All my heats have been so professionally handled.” The Omega splayed her fingers out in attempted commiseration at the sorry state of the market for top-shelf bondmates. She was finely dressed, clean lines in the designer clothing she wore. Understated, poised. The kind of balanced where ten people who met her the same day would give different descriptions of her personality. Tony knew what that was like. Being a chameleon.
“You mean that? If I wanted to leave you, right now, you would let me go.” Tony is assessing, his emotional state inscrutable to Steve. The anticipation now is almost worse than when he walked in. Tony holds Steve’s future in his hands.
“Tony? I have your blankets and pillow.”
Steve reels him in, drawing those plump lips of Tony’s ever closer until he locks his own onto them. Tony hums and it vibrates his whole mouth as Tony flicks his tongue out between his lips to taste Steve’s. The kiss turns hot, open-mouthed, and deep. They’re lapping at each other’s lips now, sloppy tongues catching the edges of each other’s mouths as they seek out tongues and teeth.
They go on like this in silence for about ten minutes before Natasha pulls into a nondescript building.
The kiss they give each other is all kinds of sloppy and needing, lips diving in and out of each other’s mouths. Bruce flees the room as Tony laughs.
“So you’re concerned.” There’s a knot in Steve’s belly, and the sensation ratchets higher with each breath he takes. Having super soldier senses gives him a fine-tuned control over his body, but Nat has always been a reader of body language, even when there’s no body language to read . He’s too still. He can’t move as he normally would, so he stays in this frozen position, hoping she doesn’t see how terrified he is. She knows something is up.
“I needed something on one of the other floors, and I stopped by to see Pepper.” Steve doesn’t know why he feels such relief. But the idea of Tony going and meeting another alpha, or anyone to be immoral with, leaves him feeling out of sorts. Tony is
“You don’t need a budget higher than $150 a month for clothes, first off.”
“Sir, I don’t think you’ll like what you’ll find inside.”
“Yeah? You need this?” Steve is pawing at his burgeoning erection. Tony can see it outlined in shadow, the heavy weight of his balls, the burgeoning knot at the base attached to the longest and thickest cock he’s ever seen. Of course his alpha should be well equipped. Steve was the best alpha, and he was picking Tony. Undeserving, lonely Tony who had always wanted Steve to notice, to
“You love it when I bring you food?” His little fantasy of feeding Tony might not be that far off. He can see them sharing Tony’s heat, Steve pressing sweet berries to Tony’s plump mouth. He wants to kiss the juices on those lips, lick Tony’s mouth clean. His thoughts of Tony have never been stronger, and it’s like his body is a live wire now that he knows in a couple days time he’s going to be sharing Tony’s heat.
“No sir, I’m unable to do so.”
“Oh, I’m starting to want you to make me.” Steve prowls around to Tony’s left, Alpha command in every line of his body. Tony’s separate instincts roar at each other.
“—shocked and upset that there’s government officials masquerading about while they plow each other secretly—”
He goes to look in on Tony and he’s met with the hard faces of medical personnel who usher him away from the room. His chest clenches with a feeling that he doesn’t have a name for.
He breathes deep of Steve and the smells of cooking. Steve hand made the ricotta. He can tell.
“I’d like to try and start over, Tony.”
Barton grabs hold of him as they skyrocket up.
“JARVIS, give some Black Sabbath and make it loud.” Thinking about this is going to give him hives, he just knows it.
Domesticity suits them. Steve takes Tony to bed, enforcing his bedtime rules, and Tony grumbles as a matter of course, but happily complies.
apart. Tony watched the footage. He watched as Steve was tossed into the dark, unyielding sea.
Steve is in love with the best person he’s ever known.
“You were once an omega yourself. How did you ever justify doing to Tony the things you did when you knew what it was like?”
“JARVIS, I said no visitors!” Tony’s robot, Dum-E swings over bearing a fire extinguisher in its grip. It waves it at Steve threateningly before Tony barks at it to stop, and that everything is fine.
The integrity of this daydream falters under his hands. He stutters for a moment, his cock softening even though the very thought of Tony like that arouses him more than anything ever has.
“I’m sorry, he seemed like a good man.” Of course he was. He was steadfast, and while Tony didn’t believe the same things as the other man, the conviction with which Coulson did his job was a trait he was well-familiar with. Even if Tony kept his dedication to atonement close to the chest. In a twisted way it’s still selfish, because although he can say he doesn’t put on the suit for himself, the very act of doing so in order to right a wrong is a form of arrogance. And he’s well practiced at playing that.
When JARVIS unlocks the door, it immediately opens and Steve strides through with a momentum that makes Tony think he was pacing just outside it.
He approaches the doors and pulls them open. Inside, the church looks completely different, and yet somehow the same. It feels the way all churches feel when you go in them for the first time. This isn’t home, but somehow it is.
A distant part of him screamed.
“Okay, okay I’m sorry. I can feel you staring at me through the phone. Hopefully undressing me with your eyes, although maybe not.” Tony cringed as he lifted a hand off of a Camloc Drill Jig, dropping several screws that had plastered to his arm in the process. He was going to be stomping on tiny pieces of metal for days. Unless… an air-core magnet attached to Dum-E could do the trick. It was overkill compared to an electromagnet, but he didn’t want to deal with frequency-dependent loss when he could simply circumvent it. To build it small enough, he’d have to—
Tony sucks in a breath, his chest expanding and limbs twitching.
“How do we do this?” Nat is all business. She’d make a great second in command to Cap, who is the logical leader here. Iron Man is just a grunt in a suit as far as many of them know.
Steve doesn’t stop anyway. Tony can feel the tight ring of muscle as it fights every inch, every bit of Steve. When Steve seats himself, that last part is the most painful. It stretches him harshly and he cries out. Steve releases his hand off Tony’s mouth and moves to hold Tony’s hips as he starts his first slide back out.
“Steve, please fuck me, please.” And Steve is on him, rewarding him, fingers finding the space between his crack, fingers seeking out the heated channel of his body.
“Make me.” Which, after he says it, Tony is sure that this man could, given the first class glare he’s receiving. In a robotically voiced huff, Tony dismounts the doughnut and goes to meet what is surely another attempt by Stern to commander the armor.
“Not ok, not ok with that.” Yes he was. The idea of Rhodes wrapped up in Tony’s armor felt right. But he wasn’t going to let Honey Bear get away with thinking that stealing suits from friends was cool.
“You will count them.” Steve brings his hand down. This gives him no pleasure. It’s pure punishment and he doesn’t make the slaps easy. They’re intended to bruise and warn Tony of the next time he opens his mouth to think about what he’s saying.
by those who were. Apparently this was very bad for statistical analysis.
On the last burst from his cock, Tony gives a little mewl.
A cell phone clatters out of the package, and Tony stares at it, a smile creeping over his face. He should be repulsed, disgusted with the man who is saying he wants Tony so much, he had to hurt him. And that now he’s haunted by his own desire.
They swarm as one, their limbs moving irrespective of the others around them. It helps, as some of them trip, fall, and are trampled underneath the oncoming horde.
“It’s worth a shot,” Bruce says, as if he and Tony are of one mind.
“How will your friends have time for me, when they’re so busy fighting you.” The hooked end of the staff tinks against his reactor, blue energy spiraling up the end of the metal to burst out ineffectually at his chest. His sigh of relief is loud in his ears. Tony never thought he’d be grateful to not have enough of a heart to mind control.
“Alcohol doesn’t seem like it would help that any.”
“Oh ho ho, that’s it, isn’t it? You want to knot me. You must figure I’m such a slut for it, yeah?
But it takes another step, head dipping down to scent the ground while keeping its eyes on Tony.
Steve reaches for another, a raspberry this time, and offers it up. Tony licks the tips of Steve’s fingers and sucks the tender flesh of the fruit from them once more. Steve feeds Tony like that, piece after piece, making his way through the cheeses and fruits. When Tony finishes, he hands him the juice to drink, which Tony obediently swallows.
“Ok, I understand.”
Loki puts his hands up and it’s all over, though it shouldn’t be. Tony thinks that Loki must have something else up his sleeve, and he wants to insult the man by grabbing him by the horns to see if he does anything about it.
Empty.
“Bucky, yes,” he hisses as one digit penetrates him.
. He isn’t their first priority.
“He’s done for. He’s been drooling here since he’s been found.” A tech leans over and whispers to another tech who has just entered the room.
“It didn’t work did it, Tony? I picked Bucky over you, and it didn’t make me feel better. I give up. You’ll be hearing from me.”
“I understand Tony.” But inside, he feels close to disintegrating. He can feel pieces of himself splinter and crack at the thought that Tony will
But that’s not why Bucky doesn’t want anything to do with Steve anymore.
They shower together before Steve slips off to make breakfast.
“That’s three,” Steve says with resignation.
“Oh, good. Yes. Bring them over.” Tony scrambles up, and Steve tries not to look at his bare legs, his bare everything.
“I don’t know. You make a fine Alpha, but you’d also be an amazing Omega.” Steve worries he’s blown it just then, but he can’t help himself. If he didn’t have such fine control over his body, his pheromones would be coming off him in waves. He wants Tony with a fierceness that makes his head and cock ache. He’s so nervous that Tony will figure it all out before the changes are complete. That somehow Tony will pinpoint the delivery mechanism, or the day that his hormones spike.
Finally, finally he knew what Steve smelled like, and he’d never hated it more.
“No doubt. But you’re not really narcissistic are you?”
“Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity.” Loki is in full medieval garb, carrying his staff like an emotional support weapon. Despite the location and circumstances, Loki looks nervous.
Tony sidles over, dodging a Pakled and squeezing past an Orion, who may or may not be here willingly. If Tony had the suit, or any kind of firepower for that matter, all the slaves that he sees would be freed. Yeah, Tony has
“It’s never too late to try Nat. You did the best you could.” Bruce’s voice was soft, and it made Steve lurch into awareness that this shouldn’t have happened.
He doesn’t self-castigate for not being able to focus; afterall, he’s got less than ten minutes probably before one or both of them show up. Tony tells himself that he’s got it under control, but if that were true, he wouldn’t be sitting here now. At this point though, he can’t extricate himself from events. From them.
Somewhere inside Tony, he just knows—he
Nonetheless, he should probably stop his self-imposed isolation and let the world back in. He’s going to have to face the music anyway and tell Bucky that Tony isn’t cut out for this.
“No, I’m—well, I’m trying to help. I know that I hurt you, and that you must think I don’t care, but I do. I’ll do the cooking for now, until we figure something out. Maybe a cooking class, or I can teach you.” He’s still holding the plate, which is rapidly cooling in his hands.
“A unique perspective, one that I’m inclined to help you out with.”
The water is streaming down his back and he’s lost in his thoughts, which is why he doesn’t hear anyone come in until the stall next to him starts running.
Another spurt of slick escapes Tony, and he’s never been so thankful to be an omega as he is in this moment.
But he’s good. He’s— he’s the best of men. Tony can tell. He can always tell when someone has ulterior motivations, even if he doesn’t know what they are. So the calm and expectant look on Rogers’s face when he then asks if he can hitch a ride to the carrier, well, Tony can’t say no. Tony would follow this man wherever he might want to take him, which means he’ll take him all the way to where he wants to go.
“But what if I didn’t.” He says in a tone that might be better suited to someone being held over a fire. She shakes her head.
“Tony, what’s wrong? Are you hurt? Let me see–” Steve kept coming forward, hands out in supplication.
“Let’s say you’re right. You think I should be doing something other than what I am with my Extremis.” Tony stays where he is, lingering over the bottle of liquor.
. If we can get all jaeger pilots to do this, we could prevent complete loss of control of the suit when one partner is disabled—”
“Do you have to do that?”
“God, fuck, it hurts!” His legs and arms begin to ache, and the pain in his belly sharpens into a fine point. Slamming his hands on the ground before him, he braces himself for the next wave of sensation. Which is when he notices the hair on his hands darkening and becoming longer, his nails extending into tips.
His eyes mist over, and he blinks rapidly, turning his face away from them.
“Can we just not? Can we please?” He begged, voice tinny.
Sometime during the night, he gets a text from Fury telling him to come in tomorrow at 0800 hours and expect to be there for four. Steve thinks that’s fair, though he doesn’t know what he can learn in four hours time. But he knows he wants to learn. There has to be practical knowledge these days on how to manage omegas that he’s just not grasped as of yet. Hopefully, there will be time to figure those things out.
“It’s not a privilege to socialize, it’s a necessity. People need other people.”
Bucky is writhing on the floor now, his metal arm barely attached at the seams. Tony has a vicious sense of satisfaction at the thought that the metal hand would no longer be an option for the Winter Soldier. Nothing should be an option for him, if Tony can help it.
“I can’t fucking believe you,” Bucky hisses, his metal hand flat on the table as he leans over it. “Never, when I gave you those pills did I think you would do this.”
Tony pauses, examining each of them. Steve is wearing his too-tight white shirt and running pants combination, looking oddly out of place with his bare feet. His muscles ripple as he clenches his hands together and there’s a tweaking movement in Steve’s jawline that Tony registers as similar to the anxiety that Steve displays when they’re in the field.
“I just didn’t realize how generous he is.”
“That’s a very roundabout way of telling the story, but letting you have your narrative doesn’t conflict with our end goals.”
His heat has started, or it’s just about to.
. So perfect and amazing, and everything Tony has ever believed him to be. How could Tony not care for him?
Steve approaches tentatively, looking for a way to speak with the man. Thankfully he’s telegraphed his intentions well enough and the man he’s now sure is a priest makes his way over.
There are no handholds inside this monotonous breakdown that he can grab hold onto. Instead, he physically loops his arm around Steve’s elbow, grasping on for dear life. Steve, who knows the taste of Tony’s fear, leans in and becomes the only thing propping Tony up as Sunset drones on about her successes, some of them old iterations of ideas she stole from him. He thinks she takes secret delight in trotting out her crimes. Her accomplishments.
“Much. It doesn’t hurt anymore.”
Searching for Steve doesn’t work. Tony is left clutching the covers to his knees, staring into the darkness as holograms of cameras flicker through the air, but none of them stop on Steve’s face.
“Bucky—”
“Steve, do something! It fucking hurts, oh god. Please!” Steve reaches the door just as Tony has his outburst, and Steve almost kicks it in, but manages to turn the handle in his hands to push it open.
He shuts the memories away. They lead to places he’d rather not go, realities he only wants to confront when he’s in his lab, working on a way to prevent them.
“Steve, you want to do this here?”
It takes minutes to get to Fury’s office, but it feels like hours.
“Captain Rogers. Mister Stark.” Killian slips by like an oil spill, and Tony exhales when the door clicks shut behind him.
Steve doesn’t wait; he can smell the beginnings of slick and the musky scent of Tony. He devours it all, taking Tony down to the root in one long suck. Tony cries out and humps at his face. Steve lets him but presses Tony’s hips down with his hands. He curves his fingers over them, feeling the delicate bones press against his fingertips down to the hollow where Tony’s legs meet his groin. There’s a heat to Tony, rising off his body like an invisible mist.
“I can feel him. He’s in here, he’s—”
He feels sick. He needs Tony.
“Adopt? Mate? Tony, there are terrorist cells more nurturing than I am,” her face softened, and she continued, “that’s lovely of you to say, but I’m happy with how I am. And not because I was forced to accept it.”
“Tony, stop please, don’t do this.” He’s not above begging. He’s not, if it’s Tony.
He paints, he works for SHIELD, he rides his bike, he cooks, he has Bucky, and still, still, in the twilight hours he lays awake and scrutinizes what he’s missing. There is no discontent in the materials of his world—every night now he’s warm and detached from his formerly ice-filled dreams. Sleek covers lay tightly fitted to the mattress under his body, and if anything, he’s comfortable. Which is just another word for complacent.
“You’re not that old. But here, here’s a towel for padding.” Steve slips a folded up towel into the water as Tony rotates to kneel on it, the water sluicing off of him as he pulls his legs apart and presents. The tub is large enough for both of them, and Steve slips in behind him, hands steadying himself on Tony’s hips. There’s a beautiful pattern of bruises there, and he presses his fingers until they indent Tony’s skin while Tony twitches his hips backwards, arching his back into Steve’s grip. His hole is wet with water and slick, and he watches Tony’s rim pucker and squeeze out a dollop of come, and a wave of possession grips him. He reaches over and wipes it up with his finger before leaning forward and rubbing it into Tony’s gland.
Tony pulls off first, groaning, and kisses Steve’s palm that was holding his cheek. He lets go, dropping Steve’s hand, and in a movement that’s almost shy, turns around, revealing his perky ass for Steve’s purview as he struts over to the nest.
“Yeah, Alcohol is a real shit show. It’s like the TLC of beverages. Hence why I drink it.” He raises his glass to the bunch of them. On accident, he meets Cap’s gaze, and locks in for a moment on the man’s eyes. They glitter with irritation, and something inscrutable.
“But it’s Tony. He’s working on the cure.”
It’s easy to gather up the necessary supplies in the kitchen: fruit, cheese, and juice to drink. He brings this to Tony, who is still curled up in the nest, though he’s started to doze just a bit.
Tony drops his hands into the water, which comes up to their thighs.
“This is the one I picked because it’s as humiliating as you swearing all the time is. The punishment fits the crime.”
“I wouldn't know.” And christ, this is what Steve has been reduced to. Taking the Lord’s name in vain in his own mind and lying. He has a fleeting thought that he doesn’t know how he got here. That this was all harder than he had in mind and while the fruits of his efforts are worth it, he doesn’t know if he’ll make it to the other side unscathed. There are so many factors that can go awry, including the one in front of him.
“We’ve got one introduction to do before we start. Captain, this is Tony Stark. He likes solving problems and he’s going to help us track the cube. The only problem he can’t solve is how not to be a complete ass.”
Even if they had been promiscuous, they didn’t deserve this.
Time has lost some meaning, but Tony knows it’s late. No one will be wandering the halls like he is. He’ll have the best chance of getting to the practice room if he hurries along.
“Fine. What is going on? Who are you? Why am I locked in here?”
“Ok, thank you for telling me. Would you sit and eat with me?”
“So you would say that Tony can take care of himself on his own?”
“You have a lot of homework.” She looks pensive, retreating into her CEO shell as she says this.
The soft click of the automatic lights when he moved had him closing his eyes to press back the burning sensation of only having shut them not that long ago. Even blinking hurt.
“Seems like that’s not much of a question.” Steve is peering down at photos of the omega man he’s been given. There’s a certain vanity in the man’s eyes, a bit of rebelliousness that Steve just knows he’s going to have to curb, if he can’t get out of this. He has to believe that his friend, Howard, would have never betrothed his son to Steve if he had known what Anthony Stark was going to turn into.
“I am sorry for hitting you. It was wrong, and I won’t do it again. I thought I was enforcing discipline, but I realize that it was hurting you and wasn’t helping at all. Is there anything I can do to make it better for you? I would like to commit to doing that.”
for Bucky. When Bucky first came, he was scrambled, lost, but slowly he had come around to display a wry sense of humor, a teasing and mischievous manner. It sat in the counterpoint to Steve, who was always sweet and kind, when he wasn’t deadpan or tight with worry.
“It doesn’t. Just– don’t touch. Please.” What was with this sudden honesty? Fuck, he was obeying Cap. Just like that, all the walls and self-control he had built up were crumbling. Fear gripped him.
Steve pulled off of him, and Tony mewled, helpless. There was a yearning in him, vast and raw, eating him up inside if only Steve would sate it. Steve’s eyes were black, even in the glow of the repulsor light, his eyelashes a shadow on his face. Even still, Tony could see him surveying the scene before him, the slump of Tony’s weeping cock against his stomach, the obscene mess that Steve had painted on his cunt, and Tony’s naked need written on his face.
“Hmm. We’ve had some battles, some ceasefires, maybe even a peace treaty or two. You know what, I think that making love or war is an unrealistic demand. We need a hybrid.” Tony leans forward into Steve’s space, solicitous. And Steve is not ready. The heady feeling of Tony in his orbit makes his head spin, and Steve barely manages to stop himself from reaching out to steady himself on Tony’s shoulders with his hands.
“Yes! Yes, Steve, god, don’t stop, please, I need it.
“Steve, I want you to soothe me using my gland, and stop hiding your hard-on for me, I can smell how much you want me.”
He sits down, and grabs at the food in front of him, not willing to converse about any of it. Bruce lays a gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder.
Outraged, he tries to ignore it.
“Well?” Tony is standing there, armor bent and scraped, almost apart at the seams, Friday warning him that his systems are going to go offline, that he won’t be able to make it out of Siberia on his own. He could die here. Would die here, with Barnes and Steve all wrapped up in a frozen tomb where he never has to confront the fact that the best man he knew justifies his decisions on selfish aims.
Steve latches onto the next one, which feels like silk. It ripples in his fingers and he immediately knows that he wants some of this one. But in a blanket or what?
Tony hasn’t changed entirely, but every morning when he walks into the kitchen, he looks more well-rested than he has in some time. Steve serves him a cup of coffee, handing over the warm glass to Tony’s waiting hands, which aren’t trembling with low blood sugar or otherwise jittery with the need for caffeine. Tony himself is all-too-perfect, hair giving way to feathery waves that have no purposeful direction framing his sleep crusted face. He really is beautiful.
“Pep?”
Sam’s gaze pierces Tony’s soul, like Tony is a mess of wires and Sam knows just how to untangle him. “If you hurt him, there isn’t a force alive that’ll stop me from getting to you. You know that, right?”
He has Tony. That’s what matters.
“Yeah, I hope you found what you were looking for.” His hands are clasped together, because if he doesn’t keep them that way, they’ll shake.
They both freeze in their seats before eyeing up the other with unconcealed disdain.
” Clint whoops over the coms, and Steve reaches a hand out to grasp Tony’s. Not all of it is made right yet, but it will be. Their fingers twist into each other’s, and it’s perfect.
The weight of Steve’s gaze now is like touch, rolling over the planes of his body with sweet pressure. Slowly, Steve lowers himself, cock already in hand. Tony doesn’t know when he pulled it out, but he doesn’t care. It’s
The first letter is the hardest. It’s to Pepper, Tony’s CEO and friend, maybe something a little more than a friend. Part of taking Tony is ensuring the connections he has don’t go unfulfilled. That the people in his life understand what’s happened and don’t make attempts to alter what is set in stone. Pepper has to understand that nothing can be done.
Most omegas ceded nest protection to alphas, but there was a small subset that took the duty of caring for the nest to its fullest extent. Steve was one of those rare omegas, though not surprisingly, who considered it their sacred duty to physically defend their home. And Tony, he loved it.
The air tenses between them, stretching out between them as they both wait for the other to attack first—and then Bucky does, coming in hot with a human fist toward Tony’s side. Tony dodges, slinking around with feline grace as he shoots forward, aiming to intrude upon Bucky’s personal space, past his impenetrable defenses. But Bucky, much like Steve, is so much faster than Tony ever will be; he whips back, out of reach, and reveals the letter from Steve tucked into the back of his belt. Tony tries to drag his eyes away from it, tries to employ the training Natasha has given him, because the last thing he wants Bucky to know is that Tony has seen it.
“Get to it, sport.” Bucky is toweling off his hair that’s limp with sweat before he drags the rag down his arms and chest. At one point, Bucky had been a beta, but Hydra had changed all of that. Very recently, Bucky had had a surgery to help correct some of the issues with the change that Hydra hadn’t seen fit to do.
“Don’t do that again.” The demand comes out brittle, uncertain.
“Captain America’s on threat watch?” Banner has his arms crossed, looking defensive and incredulous.
His insides simmer with anger.
“I could murder your eidetic memory right now.” Tony snapped, angered by his attraction. Steve eyed him like he would do anything to shut Tony’s mouth and Tony involuntarily shuddered. He hadn’t taken his suppressants in more than 24 hours.
Steve wants to learn the shape of Tony, and he takes his hands back down to Tony’s ribs, gliding up and down Tony’s sides, and then begins to move his hands to the middle of Tony’s chest.
“I can’t tell you that. But whatever is going on that’s causing this stress, has to stop. We don’t want to come here again. Do you understand?”
“Open wide, yeah that’s good.” Bucky pinches at Tony’s jaw as Tony obediently parts his lips. It’s not a perfect alignment, but Bucky makes do as he bends his cock just so and slides the tip of it into Tony’s open mouth. As gentle as he can be, Tony suckles at the head, moaning at the taste, the now poignant thrusts of Steve, and the overall feeling of being
“You’re not allowed to die before SHIELD gets what it needs. I’m not above calling your CEO and ratting you out.” Fury says, his tone twisty and more sincere than the content of his words. Like he, they, needed Tony, not just Iron Man. Like Tony deserved to live, and not exist as a tool for manufacturing weapons. He supposed this was Fury’s gift; no real leverage but saving Tony’s life.
And then there’s Steve. Steve, who he loves, who has hurt him but has come back and achieved Tony’s forgiveness. They’ve spent so much time together, knowing each other so intimately before they ever had a romantic moment.
“Ah-ah Cappy. That’s not going to get you what you want anymore. Learn to use your words like a big boy.” He watches Steve clench his fists and unclench them, eyes glued to Tony’s face. Steve would love to put his hands on Tony’s neck, make him submit, Tony can feel it. He half wants the man to try it, maybe see if he can escape. And if he runs, Cap will track him down, and then—and then—he kills that train of thought.
“So you decided for him. I’ve always known you had a selfish streak, but this is beyond the pale.” Steve can’t believe his friend is so completely against this. They agreed that this was best for Tony, and yes, maybe Steve didn’t ask Tony, but he doesn’t see Tony complaining at all about not being an Alpha. Of all the things he expected, the first was that Tony would put up some kind of fight, and yet, there’s been radio silence on that front. If Tony didn’t want this, he would have taken stabilizers a long time ago.
And no, Captain America isn’t dead, but he should have been.
“Ok, I guess I understand.” He doesn’t understand, exactly. They are married. They have to make this work, and to be perfectly frank Tony has only demonstrated the same behavior that Steve has a problem with. If the priest hadn’t said that Tony’s sins are his own, he would have had Tony over his lap in an instant.
“Yeah, those were hard days then. Things are better now, but still not great. But the House is about to vote on removing the ability to use any form of physical punishment in an alpha-omega marriage! That’s big news! Have you heard?”
Tony doesn’t think there’s another answer other than ‘yes,’ though he’s deeply ashamed that he wants Steve and Bucky, together, all at once. He can’t extricate the sensations of both of them touching him, and wanting to is impossible; they’re under his skin now.
“Ok, I won’t.”
“You’ve done nothing wrong. But let’s wait and see if this change is sticking around, yeah?”
“That’s twenty-three, and you will say thank you for each one.”
“I know there’s ways now of keeping yourself free of pups, but how did you manage back then?”
“No, nope, this isn’t happening. You are not happening to me.” When Steve walked in, Tony didn’t just know he fucked up, he knew he was about to be put on a solid time out pinioned on all-American-dick. He wasn’t an idiot. He knew he’d rejected everyone but the one scent, and without the scent cover he developed for SHIELD on either of them, Rogers’ smell, the one he’d tried so hard earlier to get a whiff of, wafted around the room, mixing with his.
“What is this?”
“Yeah, right. We’re ordering in,” Tony says.
“Care for me? What does that even mean?” He doesn’t want to hear Steve’s excuses, his lies, not anymore. Steve has never treasured Tony as Tony does—did—Steve.
learn to cook for yourself. You also haven’t done laundry since we’ve been married. It’s been more than two weeks. You’ll work on that tomorrow until it’s done.”
Maybe Steve will come back. He said he wanted Tony.
“Already on it sir.” The whoosh of the movement barely distracts him from Tony’s pleading. It’s agonizing listening to him disintegrate into a puddle of ‘please’ and tears. Steve never should have left Tony’s floor. He should have stayed. What was he thinking? Everything tonight has moved too quickly for his mind to process. The confrontation, Tony’s acceptance and his final pill. Steve hadn’t counted on the heat being so immediate in its need for satisfaction.
over here.” Tony was in the process of trying to bend over without using his wings as a counterbalance, which wasn’t working very well at all. He’s used to the suit and its numerous stabilizing features, but wings, wings are something else.
“Babe, Tony. Say you’ll be mine.” Tony wants to answer yes. He very much does, but he’s shocked into silence when he feels teeth on his shoulder, clamping down just under where his mating glands are. It’s a threat, a promise.
“I think you know.” Tony’s voice was low. Steve choked, turned around and pressed his forehead against a smooth piece of concrete, still gripping his face. He looked so good like that, muscles defined by the suit Tony had designed for him. Maybe subtly he’d always been more omega than he thought.
“Democracy is fantastic Pep, but it’s also fucking dull, and corrupt. Didn’t you buy the rest of the people not in Stern’s high school clique?” Stern wasn’t even the ultimate Mean Girl. That award went to General Ross. The man had a perpetual boner for any supers, if his obsession with Dr. Banner was anything to go by.
“It’s no trouble at all. Not a lot of people remember the past and who was in it these days. I’d like to think they’d be thankful someone took the time to care what became of them.” The priest leads him to the sacristy then, dropping the cloths in a waiting laundry basket before gesturing at him to follow him down some stairs. The ceiling on the way down is low, and Steve has to duck to make it through. And when they get down there, his head is almost at the ceiling. It’s cramped and smells faintly of sewage.
When a morning comes where Tony isn’t in the kitchen, Steve waits for an hour before going to look for the omega. He finds himself in front of the closed door to Tony’s room. Steeling himself for it to be locked, he attempts to open it. Surprisingly, it swings open, and Steve sees a lump of blankets on the bed.
“There’s not a lot I don’t know, Steve. Did you enjoy your time in church? I don’t know what you confessed to the priest. That’s just a step too far for my privacy invasions.” Tony smiles, and it’s more unguarded than Steve’s seen in the past.
His vision starts to blur as tears threaten to spill down his cheeks. He doesn’t know where the urge to cry came from, but now that it’s here, he’s holding on by a thread, trying to keep his sanity. Getting away feels impossible, but he
“That doesn’t answer the question.” He taps the glass with a finger, not wanting to allow Tony to leave him here without answering all his questions.
When he pulls away, there’s something fathomless in Tony’s dark eyes as he stares at Steve. His expression is blank, devoid of happiness or anger. It’s unnerving, but it doesn’t last long because Tony moves in, reaching up to Steve’s open gland with his mouth.
Tony slams himself against the wall after he passes the corner, hands smacking roughly against the surface. Hopeless. They can scent him out wherever he is anyway, but he needs to catch his breath—catch his mind. There was a way out of this, but maybe he had passed it on the highway of this misadventure long since past.
“That’s about right.”
His half-Omega recovers quickly, tongue darting out to drag across the top lip and back down into his parted lips. Lips that so rapidly have captured Steve’s attention.
now. Clenching and squeezing as if he wants every drop of Steve’s come and he’s determined to have it as deep as possible.
“Not really. Fine. So tell me your fascinating ground rules.” Steve pauses here, waiting out Tony’s impatience until the omega focuses. Like training a dog, you have to wait for them to have their full attention on you.
With every loving touch and kiss, Tony takes back into himself all the things he thought he’d lost. Steve gives over completely, allowing him access, entry into his mouth, and his heart. Steve gropes to the side, his hand smacking the nightstand before clutching at the handle and pulling open the drawer. Lubricant in hand, he slicks up a finger and reaches down to circle at Tony’s entrance.
“Luck doesn’t have anything to do with it. This is a numbers game, sweetheart. And while the numbers have always favored me—love me some math, you know—I’ve scented more people than you’ve met. And I have an extensive distrust of institutions that measure compatibility via personality tests.” Some personality tests worked, it was true. And he wasn’t about to admit that they’d mostly pegged him, but for his occasional need to be chased and dominated. Sometimes controlling trauma was a matter of repeating the same incidents, but this time, with victory on the mind. He tried not to think of Yinsen; the Alpha’s gentle hands haunted a place in his mind he never wanted to go back to, but lingered like a ghost in the hallway anyway.
Steve grunts as his orgasm hits him, his cock spilling out over the floor, twitching. Tony yanks his fingers out and comes around to stand next to Steve’s face.
The suit is practically humming with contained energy. Tony has always been reckless, and this is where Steve knows he’s got the other man. Control. It’s all about command over one’s faculties. Steve has eroded Tony’s, turned his boundaries into mud.
It doesn’t work.
“Another time, I’d bathe you. Let you rest and rub those sore muscles out.” The ‘but’ hangs in the air.
“Good, let’s get to it then.” Steve pulls up a chair to the counter and gestures at Tony to sit down. Tony does, slamming his smoothie on the counter as he settles in.
“I’m sorry I’ve forgotten what you’ve just said.” Tony’s voice is a lazy drawl, and he cocks his hips as he settles back to look at the justice and give Steve a wink. Those heavy eyelashes flutter and Steve finds himself angered.
He’s startled from his thoughts by a somewhat raucous laugh that dims into a fit of giggles. He watches an alpha-omega couple standing by the doors, smiling at each other over some inside joke.
But it’s Steve who is looking down at him with a paralyzed expression, his lips parted and eyes wide.
“What is there to know? How, since at any point in the past three years since the Triskelion incident you could've told me? No, I’m fucking done with this.” Tony showers Steve in repulsor energy, the shield bouncing each beam back, some sliding harmlessly past while others push him back up into a wall. Steve is there then, shield in hand.
“I think you need to invest in less risk-averse categories. How about some mutual funds?”
“Of course, sir.”
“All right, let’s set the phasers to fun and keep them occupied.” It’s then that the Quinjet, in an attempt to interfere with the fight between Thor and Loki, takes a direct hit and whirls down to the ground. He has to trust that they’re fine. That drawing enemy fire is the best he can do.
“So good to meet you. Do I call you Mr. Stark? Mr. America? Or just Captain?” Ty holds out his hand, his oily smile still lingering at the corners of his lips. Steve looks at it and realizes he has to shake it. He grips at it hard, not hard enough to break bones, but close. Using his strength, he yanks Ty closer, the man’s face showing evident strain under the handshake.
“Kiss me. Hold me.” Steve approaches cautiously, and Tony looks up at him, eyes hooded and stormy with need. “Kiss me,” he repeats.
“Shh, baby. We’re going to help you choose. Just lay back, and let me have you. I’ll be so good to you.” Steve caresses Tony’s face, his hands rough from use, before he pushes Tony’s shoulders back down. Steve then reaches for Tony’s pants, and Tony slaps his hands away.
“Yeah, I can do that,” he says, not sure if she can hear him.
, burying himself into Tony’s body. Tony blinks, like he’s waking up from deep sleep, and he reaches out, wrapping his arms around Steve’s shaking frame.
He stomps back upstairs and sets the plate down hard on the countertop. It thankfully doesn’t break this time, but Steve almost wishes it would.
“It makes you omega.” Steve leans back on the couch, and wonders whether he’s going to have to demand Tony bathe, or if he’ll do it himself. There’s no way he’s looking forward to cleaning the omega. It would involve Tony being nude in front of him, and his very nature as an alpha wants that, even as Steve himself loathes the idea.
The priest provided no clarification on how to get Tony to obey, but he’s willing to accept that maybe he should do what the priest said, for now. Just let Tony make his own decisions, his own mistakes. And further, that he should resolve himself to observing Tony in his environment. Noting how he behaves and whether it’s genuinely as problematic as Steve has assumed.
“Will you listen to me as an equal, Steve? Will you agree to be my partner in all things?” Tony’s chin is tucked up by his shoulder as he turns his head to look at Steve, who’s chest to back with Tony, Tony’s eyes dark with promise and so close to Steve’s that he can’t look away.
“I care. They’re mine. I don’t want you to look.” Steve knows he can’t press, but it’s devastating to him that Tony doesn’t want to share this intimacy. He’ll respect it, even though it makes him feel awful that Tony is afraid of what Steve might think.
“I’m yours,” he repeats.
“See? Done. No signature, no problem, thank you for your time and goodbye.” He stalked out, snatching the stack of papers that contained more information than the average person’s facebook, ready to face the wrath of his assistant.
“This isn’t, no, this isn’t what I want,” he mumbles. His mouth isn’t working and there’s drool freezing on the floor below his mouth.
“So not consensual.” The flat look in Dr. Nowak’s eyes should make Steve feel evil, wrong.
. He hopes against hope that he’s Tony’s biggest, that if he couldn’t be first, he would be last and best. It’s an ugly feeling, jealousy, and Steve wishes he was above it, but when it comes to Tony, he’s not. He’s as low as any animal, and it shames him even as it drives his desires higher.
“Sit! Sit! That lovely girl told me you’d be coming. She’s getting me a hot chocolate. Do you know how long it’s been since I’ve had one? It’ll be heck on my tummy, all that sugar, but a gal’s gotta live a little.” She has a strong Brooklyn accent, and Steve can’t help but smile at her. Her scent is that sourness that all the elderly have, but with his superior sense of smell, he can tell she’s omega.
“Fine. I found— I found a really good scent.” He mumbled, pulling away to fidget with his lapels.
“Yes, I know who you are; the Omega who wants to be a warrior. All out of place. What do you think your team will say when they find out what you really are?” Now, Fury may not have a problem with Tony being Omega, but he won’t be helping him deal with the public in a meaningful way for Tony. Anything to cover SHIELD’s ass will be the order of the day.
Steve is silent for a moment, thinking. It may be all for the best that the doctor is on Tony’s side in all this. He needs Tony to not lie to his healthcare professional. But the balance to be struck here, is if the doctor is willing to do anything illegal in order to facilitate Tony’s freedom. Which would be next to impossible to do with a mating mark, but the very thought makes Steve grind his teeth.
shrieks, lifting one curled claw out of the water in order to crawl forward, its hideously empty yellow eyes locking tight to the jaeger.
. And now you want me to do it again?” Disgustingly, there’s a part of him that
“Tony, I’m sorry. If you don’t want this— I’ll— I’ll leave.” Steve folded in on himself, somehow managing to look small, defeated, his scent turned sharp with disappointment.
The frenetic tension in Steve’s body is a warning for how badly he’s going to get it. Tony isn’t sure he’s going to be able to sit straight after. And everyone will know, they’ll know what he is and he’ll never have any self-respect again as he imagines his teammates, people who he could have called friend, thinking about what Steve did to him in this cluster-fuck of a cave-in.
“I’m sorry Nick. What were you lying? These are for a threat that doesn’t exist, Fury. Do we have a loch ness monster defense system? No, no we do not.” Tony talks over them and whips the monitor around, showing schematics for weapons that were powered by said Tesseract.
Tony wipes at it, disconcerted. Is he crying?
Floor 37 goes off without a hitch in execution, but the results are savage. Most of the people are already dying of secondary infections, which leaves Bruce synthesizing antibiotics at accelerated rates with limited supplies. Some of them crash to the ground after and don’t wake up again. Others wake and proceed to scream and claw at themselves and everything else in fear.
“I—I can’t do this!” Tony tears off, scrambling down the hallway to the stairwell. There’s a snarl from Bucky before he hears a body hit the wall, and he knows they’re fighting.
“And if you find someone you like enough to spend your heat with, you won’t regret it.” Tony sucked in a sharp breath, trying so very hard not to begrudge Pepper’s satisfaction with Happy, a calm Alpha who saw Pep through her heats that Tony hadn’t scented as being all that compatible, but damn if he didn’t wish that were the case. Happy smelled like warm blankets and breakfast food.
The morning light is creeping through the curtains, and he figures that it’s time to replenish themselves with food, so he slowly gets up from the nest, trying not to spook Tony. There’s no reason to throw on clothes, as he’ll be needed again soon for Tony.
“Maria shouldn’t have tried to stop me,” Iron Man says simply before he draws his fingers down Steve’s arm and grasps at his wrist, pulling Steve towards him into an embrace. Being with Tony is like riding a tornado in a rainstorm; he holds on tight and hopes they land standing up.
That would always sting.
“I won’t antagonize them if they don’t go on about how they need the Iron Man suit for things like ‘peace’ and ‘deterrents.’ They plan to weaponize my armor—” And that was the crux of the matter. In the minds of the military, humanity is nearing a final, glorious stage of Darwinian evolution, in which mankind and guns emerge from a shared chrysalis, unconstrained by conventional morality. Nevermind the “free guns for me, but not for thee” approach always seemed to backfire.
Inside is Fury.
Steve eclipses everything, blotting out the petty insults, the fears Tony had regarding Alphas. Steve subsumes it all, curling Tony’s negative feelings in on themselves until they’re only a writhing mass of pleasure that Tony feels burgeoning underneath his skin. He has a moment of despair before the heat takes him, and he
It shocks him then, but only momentarily, when Steve leans over, the planes of his stomach bowing Tony’s back further and pulling his upper torso closer to Steve, and bites down hard on the meat of Tony’s neck.
“Uh no, as thrilling as that conversation would be for you, we don’t have to discuss a thing.”
Heat is rolling up his spine, and it’s like a fist in his gut how badly he wants Tony. But patience is something he’s had to live with, to turn into a virtue.
As he goes upstairs, he contemplates what he’s going to scale back on. The very first thing he thinks of besides the food is that he shouldn’t continue with the spankings. Tony’s arousal is going to bring about his own, and Steve doesn’t think it’s a fair punishment if he’s getting something out of it.
“I understand.” Omegas being with omegas were common when he was young. Some omegas wanted to spend heat with their kind. It was allowed and encouraged when an alpha couldn’t get time off work. It looks like that hasn’t changed much.
“I am not a ship, Tony!”
“Ok, Tony.”
It’s like a truth serum, and Tony
“I was wondering if you can tell me anything about what the church did in the ’30s and ‘40s regarding helping omegas.”
“We need you to look this over. As soon as possible.” The binder in Coulson’s hands looks important, but the man is seriously ruining the moment he’s having with Pepper. He hasn’t given up on the possibility of them, even if Pepper hasn’t reciprocated his feelings entirely. She’s still upset about the lying, which she has every right to be. Tony wonders if she’ll forgive him, or if it will stand between them forever.
“You can’t be serious. Oh my god, you are serious.” Steve sits on one of the many couches and pats his leg once. He doesn’t expect Tony to come right away, but he does want him to come over of his own volition. Blinking rapidly, Tony makes his way over carefully, as if he’s picking through some kind of obstacle course. When he comes to stand before Steve, Steve pats his knee again.
“Since you’re not going to be knotting me, children are none of your goddamn business. And my friends know who I am and care for me despite what you may think of me. You and SHIELD pay too much attention to the media. As for SI, fuck you. Just, fuck you. Nurture my ass.”
“I think we can stimulate the blood we have already collected to grow more antibodies, but yes, we’ll need more at some point. I think we should test aerosol delivery. Tony, are the lower floors still filled with zombies?”
“Bribes schmibes. What about Christine? One tiny disagreement and everyone’s making it out like we had a cat fight in the press room! She’d be a tough fighter. I don’t think she wears shoulder pads, at least.” He should have never invited her over that one time. Nope. Not ever. But he’d been on schedule for his monthly hook-up with another omega to prove—well, that Tony Stark wasn’t constrained. That he was enough. And more. Something his father had told him he’d never understand.
“Funny things are.” Tony feels as though he’s on uncertain ground. He doesn’t know if Steve means what he says or if he’s privy to the game that they’re playing.
As Steve loses control, he groans, and Tony feels the burgeoning sensation of his own impending orgasm. Steve is taking him higher and higher, pushing all thought from his mind with each tender stroke.
Tony is a splintered mess under him, tacky and drying cum over his abdomen, and he’s also the most gorgeous thing Steve has ever seen in his life. Tony is his now, precious, and cared for, loved beyond reason.
Steve doesn’t know what to do at that point. It’s not late in the evening, but it is past dinner time. He decides to go for a walk and a subway ride, maybe towards his old neighborhood. It’ll take about an hour to get there, but it’s worth it. As he boards the train, he watches people. He’s always looking for things to sketch, but today it feels like he has a different reason for looking. Steve is supposed to find the names of three successful omegas. There’s a part of Steve that can acknowledge that things aren’t like they were, which is why it was more important than ever to ensure that omegas have proper deportment. There were more temptations.
It feels as though the atmosphere has breathed a collective sigh of relief at Clint’s recovery.
“What has he done to you? This is my fault, I should have mated you. We should have made something work.” Rhodes comes back over to the bed and grasps onto Pepper’s arm and puts his other hand over Pepper and Tony’s conjoined hands.
“Go wild,” Tony says. Steve scoops up some of his spend and reaches for Tony’s glands on his neck, rubbing it into them with quick caresses of his thumb. He shyly takes some of Tony’s essence that’s left on his stomach and pushes it around his own glands. Tony watches with half lidded eyes and his eyes widen just a little bit as Steve smears his glands.
?” It’s a slap to the face. Tony has never put it into words, into context, but he’s always known that to some degree Iron Man is atonement for sins committed. Sins that Steve doesn’t and will never connect to Iron Man. It’s an injustice that Tony can barely live with suddenly. He wants to call the suit to him, cloak himself in its strength and force Steve to
Steve has always been there. Steve will always be there.
“That’s the joke he made. I suppose you’re right then. I should ask him what he needs. But then if he can’t cook at all, how is that a compromise? That’s just giving in to him. And he needs to learn.”
Of all the things that he expected, that was not it. Clint? An omega? How on earth did SHIELD give him this job? How did he even get so skilled? Clint had the moves of a beta, and as far as Steve knew, the man presented as one. He couldn’t smell a thing on Clint. Widening his nostrils, he tries to do so now instinctively.
“If you insist.” Her alpha looks down at her indulgently.
“So pretty. So gorgeous. Want you to keep these. Does that feel good? You like it when I touch your wings?”
“Yeah. I was thinking that he’s going to go into heat soon. And I heard it’s hard for omegas to be without their alpha during. But I don’t think I should spend his heat with him, if he dislikes me that much.” Steve shakes his head.
“No, you may not.” Steve’s face is carefully blank. It’s the most emotion that Tony has ever seen his husband show in a situation like this. Usually, he can muster a shy grin and a twinkle in his eye.
He sucks at Tony’s hole, devouring Tony’s ample slick, which tastes mildly salty and sweet at the same time. Tony thrusts his hips back into Steve’s face, rocking into his mouth, and tilting himself up and down. Steve eats him out with vigor, tongue flicking back and forth while he suctions at Tony. He pulls away, admiring his handiwork, Tony’s skin glistening like silver in the light.
get better. Already, Tony isn’t talking back as much as he usually does, opting to stare off into the distance and poke at his food.
They spend the rest of the evening tweaking sensors. At around nightfall, Tony gets the results from SHIELD’s servers. He does not like what he sees.
Sometimes Tony thinks they’re sentient, or that whatever was controlling them had ideas.
Tony has seen this horror movie before, and he’s not here for it.
Rhodes’s apologies are hollow, beseeching, and Tony doesn’t want to hear it. He’s so brittle, that the small cruelty of shutting out his friend is all he has that’s truly his anymore. Everything else is Steve.
He stops by this little Italian place that Tony loves and orders a carbonara for Tony and spaghetti and meatballs for himself, one serving for here and another to-go. He’s not picky, and nor is Tony when it comes down to it.
It’s too much. Tony scrambles for the letter and continues reading.
“Is it possible to do?” Steve has his palms flat on the table, waiting with bated breath to know if this is an option for him. He’s heard of people transitioning to Alpha. A lot of betas give it more than a second thought. But transitioning to Omega? It’s uncommon enough that Steve isn’t sure about it at all. Omegas have more rights than ever, but it doesn’t detract from the fact that there’s still discrimination and even sex-trade issues. Now, Steve is a believer that Alphas aren’t entitled to Omegas. If Tony transitions and he doesn’t want Steve, he’s going to accept that. Maybe not lying down, but he will.
“Mr. Stark, there’s protocol—” The Omega woman did a quick pump of calming pheromones that were noticeably potent, but wouldn’t work on Tony that easily. He’d known she wasn’t just a pretty face, but it took special talent to issue soothing scents on command when a situation had gotten stressful. He wouldn’t be surprised if she was also the Alpha recruiter.
“And I should have hurt them. But now they’re gone.”
Tony is rattling off curses and otherwise begging for release or more, maybe both. Steve can’t tell. It’s impossible to stop thinking about how he’s impaling Tony on his fat cock, and how absolutely perfect it is.
Steve would never do that to Tony completely, but he realized he had made it impossible for Tony to make his own decisions financially. It had never made more sense than when he realized that omegas need a way to get out, always.
Steve is silent. This is the crux of the matter with Bucky. Steve is no expert at navigating the line between telling as much of the truth as he can without dooming his cause.
“I stay. If I lose him, it doesn’t matter anyway.” With that, Tony doesn’t argue, though he tosses Steve a careful expression that Steve thinks says ‘don’t let my friend die.’ He won’t.
The wolf bites down, not as hard as he knows that it can, but hard enough to pierce his shirt and sink into his shoulder. Tony cries out. It’s ungodly painful, and he’s been bitten by a dog before. This is nothing like that. The teeth are razor sharp and of all the stupid things he thinks of as it happens, are that he could get an infection. He should be so much more worried about the fact that he’s being bitten, which is a precursor to being eaten.
“Steve. Steve. Steve!” It’s like his mouth won’t work around his tongue, and everything that comes out is slurred.
Steve tilts his head forward, pressing their foreheads together, noses lined up just perfectly that their tips touch and tease. Tony blinks, his eyelashes brushing at Steve’s cheek, a teasing sensation of shyness before Tony flows forward to meet Steve at the apex of their lips. There’s a feeling like a freshwater spring, bubbling and rising inside of him.
“I haven’t had a solid meal in a week, I needed something.”
Tony slammed against the door once more before going silent. Despite his silence, they all knew it wasn’t over. Tony’s mischievous nature turned deviant when he was in rut, and the silence could no more be trusted than his tantrums. If anything, he was probably looking for tools to take the door off its hinges.
He wishes he hadn’t ruined everything.
“J, you’re sure you can’t test the DNA?”
“Yeah, he does that. He’s a good man.” Steve thinks of Tony in his workshop, working away on software like this.
The shower is hot as Tony vigorously rubs the soap over his body, grabbing Steve’s favorite shampoo to use in his hair. He’s never gotten dressed so fast, stumbling into his pants and falling back onto the bed as he struggles to pull them on. He only hesitates for a moment before grabbing the letter, some instinct saying he should carry it on his person. Spurred on, he races to the kitchen, the pads of his feet smacking against the floor as he bounds through the hall, skids on the rug in the entryway, and leaps forward into the room, finding it—
It’s kind of the end of the world though. And there’s no police here or other authority figures to stop them if they want to spend it with each other.
Tony complies beautifully, licking up Steve’s cum like he’s born to do it. As far as Steve is concerned, he is.
Tony’s hitting him now, fists clenched and striking at his chest, upwards towards Steve’s face. Steve hooks his feet over Tony’s writhing legs, pinning his shins down with his strength. He snatches one wrist, then the second, pressing them down next to Tony’s head.
“This isn’t acceptable Tony. Where were you?”
It’s 4 am and he’s shuffling along the hallway to his room when Bucky slides out of the darkness and blocks his path.
There.
He lays there, planked over Tony, not pressing his body down hard on Tony’s slighter one, trying not to think about how awe inspiring it would be to
Maybe he should have asked Nat. He’s not quite sure of her feelings on the matter, but she is an impartial ear at the least. And she knows how bad Tony’s ruts have been in the past. Bucky is really only a recent guest at the tower.
“We’ve been—intimate, but surely that wouldn’t be relevant?” He prevaricates.
As they make their way into the gala, Tony snatches a stray champagne glass from a tray and hands it to Steve, grabbing one for himself.
Everywhere inside of Tony exists a structure that’s been started or otherwise touched by Steve.
Tony watches every bit of motion, all of the rippling of Bucky’s body over his own, Bucky’s arms pressed hard into the bed at Tony’s sides as the man rocks into him before snapping his hips forward. And his eyes, oh his eyes. They’re pinioning Tony in place. He feels buried by them, the sharp-dark blue of them in the low light stabbing at Tony’s heart. Despite what Steve has said, Tony knows with a surety he can’t explain that Bucky means to stay with him. That he means this.
Nat laughs, the sound crystalline and bold. It’s all Alpha, and Steve feels rankled, like he’s been smacked upside his head.
“No, no, it’s nothing like that! I didn’t do anything besides what’s already happened, I promise. I just—I shared his heat with him. I think it went well.” Steve waves his hands at Fury’s inquiry, trying to promise with his body that he’s not a threat to Tony anymore.
They fire from behind him as he weaves and dodges, managing to take out a few. Rhodey is in his ear, frozen in the suit, but he can’t think about that right now with the repulsor blasts being aimed at his head.
“What happens after this?” Steve is languid as Tony asks his question, his furnace of a body behind Tony, encapsulating him.
“Also assuming you can get those past the Hulk.”
“Are you even sure that’s a good idea? You’ll hate every second of it. You already hate me, so just imagine a room full of me, except it’s mostly alphas and betas, so I suppose you wouldn’t mind me as long as I wasn’t omega. Ok, yeah, fine. I’ll get you a suit. It’s in a little less than a week.”
“What was that?” Tony looks at him with something dark lurking under the surface of those complicated brown eyes.
“Whatever.” Tony looks moderately chastised for a moment before his mask falls back into place. It’s not much, but it’s a start, if Tony is at least deterred by the spankings he’s going to get.
“You can’t guilt me into being a sycophantic supporter of your agenda. So sorry, but I have lunch with my husband right now.” The clock turns over to 1 pm and the flood of relief hits him like a jolt of caffeine. It’s time. Steve is coming.
The doctors pack up and leave then, not a single one of them pays Steve any mind as they go, but he can hear them talking amongst themselves and a few of them look back at him with eyes like flint and lips set in a rigid line.
“Want to smell me alpha? Want to make sure I’ve been fucking faithful to you?” Tony stalks over, body sinuously graceful as he inserts himself into the space in front of Steve. The scent is so strong and it coils in Steve’s nostrils like a snake. He fights to think above it, his mind clouded with want for what his body is telling him is on offer.
“Fury must secretly like you then,” Nat says.
“I never would have left if he hadn’t hit me, you know? The whole time he’d just been making me miserable over food, over where I was and who I was with, leashing me and dragging me around for show. He’d tell me he was a good husband, providing for me, but I would have rather eaten at the poor house on some days. I should have left sooner. It always gets worse with those kinds of alphas. I didn’t know it then.” Edith is holding her cup, staring deeply into its contents. There’s a little cream from the hot chocolate stuck to her upper lip where she’s been sipping it. If she were his Ma, or his Grandma, he’d wipe it away. He feels like he knows her, like she’s his. If he’d been alpha then, he would have protected her.
Steve can’t help but put his hands everywhere, Tony’s soft flesh calling to him to cover, to protect. It’s too easy to drape himself over Tony, hands reaching down and under to grasp at Tony’s wet and leaking cock as Steve positions himself at Tony’s entrance.
“Not enough. How pathetic you are, needing this more than you value the lives of other people. What would Peggy say? I suppose you’ll never know, exactly. But we can guess, can’t we?” Tony went in for taunting, and it was only Steve’s experience and patience that kept his mouth shut against the barbs that Tony dug into him relentlessly. He liked the way Tony made him hurt. It kept him awake, aware. It was no less than he deserved for failing the mantle of Captain America like he has.
Maybe Tony was always meant to be an Omega. It’s possible something happened in the womb. He wouldn’t have put it past Howard to give his Omega wife a sufficient dose of hormones to ensure the designation of his child. He’s heard stories of it not being as good of an idea in practice, but if anyone could have worked that out, it would have been Howard.
It makes the man go colder, and maybe Tony is wrong about how Cap gets when he’s
“Nonetheless, we’re going to do this my way. And I promise at the end of it, things will be better.”
“Smile, sunshine,” Tony says, his face beaming in that false way Steve has only seen in pictures.
Tony twists around as best he can, extending his neck for more of Steve’s ministrations. Steve obliges, now moving towards Tony’s glands, gently suckling the skin in a way that draws arousal from deep in his belly, preparing him for Steve.
“Oh, shit.”
“So you want this. That’s—what in the fuck.” If Steve is being honest, he is curious about omegas. Before his serum, he had been an omega himself, but Erskine had rightfully fixed that. Steve had never acted like an omega in his life. The serum only validated what had been true all along, that Steve was meant to be an alpha. He’d been so sickly that he’d never even had a heat, nor a strong desire to nest and mate. Steve figured that his body had somehow turned omega in the womb as a defense mechanism for his failing health.
This all happened because Howard gave his omega son too long of a leash. Anthony wasn’t an alpha. He wasn’t capable of the kind of resilience and focus that alphas were. And it showed.
“Now fuck off back to SHIELD like a good boy. Don’t tell them all the obscene things I did to you, unless you want to come to me indefinitely. I don’t think you’re ready for that though. So keep lying, my honey buns. You do so well at duplicity these days.”
“You know Tony, I thought you’d changed. It wasn’t so long ago you promised a younger, more idealistic version of me that you’d meet me on a rooftop. You never showed.”
“As much as you want me.” When he bumps his cock against Tony’s hardness, the other man gasps, breath a puff on Steve’s face. Steve reaches out, grasping Tony as he pulls the other man into his embrace, the bones of Steve’s hips bracketing Tony’s. The narrowness of Tony’s waist is its own sweetness, and he thinks about Tony bare before him, impaled on Steve. Steve, inside him, consuming him and polishing until all what’s left is a shining star of destruction that’s all Steve’s.
“But he’s omega—”
If it were Tony, he would either call other military powers to help, or he’d consider it a lost cause.
He doesn’t stop.
“Do you really have to antagonize him?” Bruce asks.
Tony gulps. They’ve done this before, somewhat, Steve asking Tony to pleasure himself while Steve is deep inside Tony—but this is beyond what he’s used to. Even so, Steve has asked him to do it, and Tony doesn’t want to say no.
Tony is speechless. He’s reminded that he had tentative hopes that he and Cap would get along, but he knows hope is disappointment in advance. He’s always been entitled, afraid. And those are the root of hope, aren’t they? The need for a happy ending, that things turn out okay. As they are most certainly not ok now.
Bucky goes to shower and so does Steve before they meet in the Penthouse common area. Tony and Bruce are in their respective workshops, per usual, while Nat and Clint are playing “darts,” which turns out to be knife throwing. Thor is off-world. The tower never feels quite empty, but in times like these, there’s a quiet that settles over each floor. Like Steve can hear every bit of noise. It sets him on edge more than when there’s movie night or some other gathering, and the sounds become a blur.
Bucky stiffens all at once, and before Tony looks up, he knows it’s Steve. Only Steve could make Bucky act like he’s on red alert.
than Bucky’s fingers, and Tony bucks instinctively, the invasion of Steve’s flesh a sharp burning pain inside him. He keens, high and sad, and begs Steve with his eyes to let up.
Daredevil to deal with. The first thing he does is fix Daredevil up with a cocktail of Extremis designed to give the man his sight back. Teen Abomination makes himself known by
Okay. Hmm.
“Do you want the deal or not?”
“Here’s hoping you won’t need to step in, J.”
Steve’s heart swoops down to the bottom of his stomach. All of his best-laid plans, going to waste. The version of Tony in his head gives a sly smile, as if Tony himself knows that he’s unattainable. It makes Steve burn all the more for want of him.
“I wasn’t able to work when I was with him. I have no job experience now. He got me birth control, but not suppressants for the heats. Those he wanted. Sometimes, sometimes I was tired. The doctor said my body was reacting poorly to being in heat so much. It happens sometimes with omegas, since we’re built to be pregnant a lot of the time. The suppressants work by making your body think it’s pregnant, which is important for us like it isn’t for betas. Alex… he wanted what he wanted. I just wanted the choice, you know? Just the choice would have been nice. To have some time without a heat, or try to work. But he always steered me away from those things.”
“Because—because, dammit Nat what are you trying to get at?”
“It’ll work. It has to. And he hates being strapped down. That’s
“Oops,” Clint says through the coms. They haven’t otherwise said a thing to him.
“You can’t afford me.” Tony’s decision to lead an Alpha-free life was not a choice of health, and it was kind of Fury to frame it that way. The truth was that he couldn’t tolerate anyone in his space after Afghanistan. Not without remembering Yinsen. The careful way he’d handled Tony, shielding him from inspection by their captors so that Tony could build their way out. His intimacy had been lost somewhere in the tunnels, with Yinsen’s body. He’d thought he could try again with Pepper, with someone who wasn’t obligated to like him for his designation or ability to make money.
The wolf’s grip tightens on his shoulder and he feels the slide of its cock up and down his crack, a wet warmth that makes him shiver and shake. This is well beyond anything that a wild animal would do. He’s not sure if he’s more frightened by the idea that the wolf is semi-sentient and isn’t interested in his consent, or if this really is just an animal that’s interested in… fucking him.
“He can take care of himself. He’s a billionaire. He could eat out every day of the year and never put a dent in his money. So what’s the problem if he does?”
“You want me–like that?” Even after everything, his Tony is still so insecure that it makes Steve’s heart ache. Tony was never so vulnerable as an Alpha, but being Omega shouldn’t make Tony feel so down on himself, which means that Tony always felt this way. Steve is going to dedicate so much of his time to building his precious Omega up so that these utterances are a distant memory. Tony should be treated with reverence and cherished.
Steve wasn’t an inactive participant; the man has a plan, and it was star-fucking-spangled, as fireworks go off in Tony’s head. There’s a tongue in his mouth, hands at his hips, a hard cock pressed against his own, and Tony was flying.
He pays the barest attention to the coms, but when Natasha says she can close the portal, he has the best idea ever.
“Have you given more thought to medication?”
“Where’d you go pumpkin? Get back here, and bend over like I trained you to do for me. I want to use my fuck toy.” Steve obliges, getting up and turning around, reaching his hands behind him to spread his cheeks and reveal his hole. While he’s here with Tony, his ass belongs to him. That’s been made clear.
“I’ll tell you what. I’m going to finish my drink and my fries, and then I’m going to get up from this booth and pretend we never had this conversation. Clear?” His friend shoves the last of his fries into his mouth, gets up, and does just what he said, the door clanging shut behind him.
When Steve slides in, someone, possibly him, lets out a low, keening whine. He can’t think anymore, Steve’s cock a brand inside his used body. It burns satisfyingly as it stretches him, and Steve all but croons at Tony when he finally hilts himself inside.
There’s nothing to say.
“I can’t keep doing this anymore. I’m not cut out for it. I’m falling behind at SI and I haven’t had anything decent to eat but the sandwiches I can make. This isn’t working Steve, you have to see that.” Steve almost agrees, but he knows that things have to get worse before they get better. Tony looks awful.
“No you’re not.” Steve loops his arms around Tony’s waist and lifts him. Tony whines and writhes in his arms, and Steve plops him back into the center of the bed. He picks up the covers and tosses them back on Tony, who is glaring at him as if he can light Steve on fire with the power of his gaze alone. Tony goes slack then, defeated.
“Tony, what are you talking about? I like you!”
Clint and Natasha are there, each of them trying to wrangle a pig down with their weaponry. Clint’s pig looks like a pin cushion, the skin thick enough to prevent most arrows from going in too deeply.
When he gets there, the lights are off and there’s no one home. Anger, hot and heavy, erupts in him. He had asked one thing. One thing only. That Tony tells him where he is if he’s going to be somewhere. And dammit, the omega couldn’t even do that.
“Pretty omega. You just want to be owned, don’t you? Collared and leashed at my beck and call for when I want to use you. I’ll take such good care of you, pet. Keep you sated.” Bucky’s whispered filth has Tony overwrought, and he squirms between the two men, his own already hard cock rubbing against Steve’s as he half-heartedly tries to escape. Omegas are built to orgasm again and again, almost limitless in their pleasure.
Tony hovers in the kitchen, debating on whether he should try one more time to get a coffee, or if he should give it up and go back to whatever resembled work these days.
Steve takes Tony on his hands and knees again, fast and hard, brutally fucking into Tony’s ass, making it red with hard use. It’s just what Tony needs, as the omega comes with a howl, clawing the bedding underneath his fingers as Steve knots him.
Steve shuffles his body around Tony, his pectorals pressed so pleasingly against his back. He’s floating, warm. Inside him, something like an orgasm builds, responding to the delicate thrusts of Steve’s digits. He’s making noises he’s never heard come out of his mouth before. When Steve reaches to touch Tony’s cock with his other hand, he almost cums right there.
“Lights fifty percent.” And he waits. He listens for the soft swish of the doors to the elevator opening and closing. He hears the tinkling of keys on the counter. He notes the footsteps that move so quietly down the hallway.
“I think Captain America just came on to me.” Tony returns that smile with a playful smirk of his own, marred only by the smallest amount of apprehension. Steve wants to kiss it away.
Sunshine.
“Shh.” Bucky presses two fingers to Tony’s open mouth. “I’ll be seeing you around, Tony.” With that, Bucky stalks out of the showers, leaving Tony feeling fractured and confused.
“Stern is going to serve you a subpoena soon. So if you lie, just don’t do it under oath Tony, please?” He knew what Ross and Stern thought of him, and like he gave a flying fuck. Those two were windbags who liked the sound of their own voice and the possibility of selling someone's, anyone’s, grandmother for some bullets, including their own. They didn’t know how to ask the right questions, nor would they ever presume to care who piloted the suit so long as they got their literally bloody hands on it.
Ok. Ok. That’s reasonable. He doesn’t want it to be the rational decision, but it is.
“In my experience, it’s generally best to listen to the person in question about what it is they want and need. Just forget that he’s an omega, and treat him like he’s your equal.”
“Oh god, Bucky, please—”
“For now, I’m going to ask you to contain yourself and get back to the ceremony. I will explain after.”
Instead he hovers closer, closer, letting the warmth of his breath bounce off of Tony’s face and back to him in a loop of soft heat. Tony’s lips are parted in askance, and there’s just the barest hint of saliva on them. They look soft, plump, and pink. Steve’s eyes dance back up to Tony’s, waiting for permission.
Tony cries, tears leaking from his eyes, when Steve reaches down to pluck at the head of his cock, his slick having dripped down to coat him entirely. Steve twists at his cock, hips a rhythmic plunge into Tony’s depths.
He steels himself, picks up the plate of food, and goes to Tony in his workshop. The doors open as easily as they always have, and Tony doesn’t turn around. He never turns around now.
He should have expected the hammer, but he didn’t think the man could throw that thing with the sheer amount of power he does. It slams him through several trees, scratching his precious armor and destabilizing his flight as he drags the suit on the ground attempting to stop some of the momentum. His read-out flickers, which is bad news.
Tony is not athletic. This is not what he planned to have happen on his first time camping. He doesn’t think anyone would plan something like this.
“Help? No. I suggest you apologize.” Which doesn’t seem to phase her at all.
“Tony, that’s disrespectful.” Tony throws down his toast and swallows around what seems like a large lump of unchewed food. He bolts up and strides over to Steve, his body filled with serpentine, tempting grace. He’s still wearing his several day old clothes, but it doesn’t matter. Steve feels the telltale tightening of his pants and takes a step back.
The heat was searing now, burning his nerves into waves of hot need. He crawled towards Steve, one hand in front of the other on the dirty cement floor. Steve waited with fraught patience, arms crossed tightly across his chest. He looked as though if he moved, he would jump Tony. It made him preen; he was beautiful for his alpha. Somewhere inside, another part of him howled in despair.
Inside there’s a round table where a few omegas are sitting, chatting with one another. They go on alert as soon as he and Natasha enter, eyes sharp with assessment. Steve is reminded of the omegas in the church basement. Their faces look like they’re waiting for something. Waiting for an alpha to prove he’s just like all the rest, and hurt them. It breaks Steve’s heart to see so many omegas living in fear of what an alpha can do.
“Steve, ah! Need you.” Tony needs him.
The only promises Steve makes are to Tony.
“So that’s it? We just go back to how we’ve been the entire time?”
Not the version of Extremis he has, no. He may be benevolent and generous, but he’s a selfish God. There’s no room up here for anyone else. Well, there is room at his feet anyway. Particularly for Captain Handsome.
Tony has done something to him.
Now he just feels dirty, like he’s an intruder in his own body. It’s insistent, this little niggling thought in his brain, that all his orgasms belong to Tony, but it won’t go away. Instinct tells him he should have been inside Tony last night.
“I don’t like it.” Steve leans over to whisper to him.
“With you here, I think that’s more than just a dream, Tony.”
“Personality overview. ‘Mr. Stark displays compulsive behavior.’ In my own defense, that was last week. ‘Prone to self-destructive tendencies.’ I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? ‘Textbook narcissism?’ In an Omega? Well, agreed. Okay here it is. ‘Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.’ I gotta think about it.”
Because that’s the crux of it. Anthony is everything Steve has been taught that an omega without guidance is, and that’s a problem. Steve grasps at his face, rubbing circles under his already bagged eyes. He’s been going over this for a week now.
Tony thinks he’s going to like whatever new game the boys come up with. He might not even mind if he ends up being pursued all throughout the tower. Either way, he’s gotten what he wanted, and he thinks that his alphas did too.
But the money hides it. It hides his violent rages and lack of control while he’s in a rut.
Truly, he thought he’d flown the coop on evolution. Designations didn’t, shouldn’t, matter, and even then the worst offenders were muzzled by political correctness. Discrimination happened institutionally, but not to people like Tony. It made his decision to not tell everyone he was Iron Man that much more difficult. Yet he couldn’t deny that while the people who had attempted to bend Tony to their will were either incapable, or dead, if the military put their mind to it, Tony was certain they’d find a way. They’d find out about his little situation with heats through basic sleuthing. And if they did, Tony wouldn’t put it past them to regulate their way into his bed. He could take suppressants for only so long, and the timing for publicly and privately available suppressants were well documented. Frankly he wasn’t sure exactly what they would do, but he didn’t want to find out before getting the rest of his house in order.
“We’ve known each other for years and have been through some difficult times. He’s not had an easy time of it. This is for his own benefit, I promise.” Afghanistan and Tony’s other brushes with death should have never happened, but Steve can only help soothe the symptoms now, as soon as Tony is his. The nightmares that Tony lies about will die down with the stabilizing presence of an Alpha. Tony’s terrible eating and sleeping habits will be curbed and kept in check with an Alpha command. Even SI will benefit from this. And Steve, well, he’s going to do everything possible to ensure Tony loves him.
his subconscious whispers. He bats away at the thought and pays closer attention to Clint.
And yes, Tony was aware of the contradiction that, if he believes Steve is a part of him, Steve telling Tony it’s over is as good as confirmation that Tony is either crazy, or that Steve only lives inside Tony. Now, and forever.
They arrive at the gala, and Tony exits the car fairly quickly as a doorman pulls open Steve’s side. Steve steps out, and Tony comes around the side, swooping his arm to hook Steve’s. There’s a photographer who is crouching off to the side, taking picture after flashing picture.
The wolf rolls its hips, snapping its cock hard into Tony, the length of it expanding now to lock into Tony. Fuck, the wolf is knotting him, keeping their bodies together in order to pump Tony full of his come, filling him up. It doesn’t take long, and he can feel the rippling of flesh inside him, the spasms of muscle that come from the wolf’s cock inflating.
“He’s not malnourished. He eats!” Steve protests, because it’s true, Tony has been eating a little of what he makes. Even if it’s not well-made food, it’s still food.
Everything smells like them now, a mouth-watering flavored combination of their scents.
“Maybe. I’m behind on a lot of things.”
Can't one human being not like another human being? Can't we all just not get along?
“It’ll have to do. Thanks J. If I ask later if there’s any possibility of leftover DNA, lie to me, ok? Now I’ve got a serum to catch.”
Looking wrecked, Rhodes starts to cry, and Steve wants to turn away from the other man’s emotions, but he’s not able to let Tony out of his sight with another Alpha in their midst.
Tony is panting now, little droplets of sweat dotting his forehead, a sheen of it coating his alluring chest, cock at perfect attention for Steve. Steve’s legs spread wide to press apart Tony’s, his knees coming up under Tony’s thighs. It allows him the vantage point from which to gaze down at where he’s connected with Tony. The rim is dusky pink, stretched precariously around Steve’s knot, where it looks like it wants to slide down or over it, completely in or out.
But soon that’s over, and Tony is eying him up as a contender. Alphas can’t really help it, and Tony and Steve have been in a dominance fight since day one. Tony is twitching now, hips shifting on his chair and his lips vibrating with unspoken words. Likely insults, knowing Tony.
There’s a moment of tense concern that JARVIS will speak up, will stop him, but nothing happens. Tony is still lost in his moment when the computer screen before him flickers and goes dark.
“You gonna hurt me good, Steve? Is that what you want?” Tony cants his ass up, letting Steve’s fingers sink deeper down the fabric, grazing his ass with cold fingernails.
“And what do we get in return?”
“Yes! Yes, yes, yes. Oh, fuck, Steve, are you serious? You’re serious. Yes!” He jumps up and down as Steve chuckles and rises from the ground, ring in hand. The ring barely matters to Tony as he sees Steve with new eyes, the eyes of a fiancé, someone who will be with Steve for life. They’ll marry, and bond, and spend the rest of their life being good to the other, saving the world and being with their family. All of the Avengers seem to be smiling harder, if that’s even a possibility. Tony retracts the hand of the suit and Steve, who is shining as though he’s the sun, takes Tony’s hand and slides the ring home. Belonging has always been something Tony has struggled with, but today that pain is a distant memory, something that no longer belongs to him. Instead, he’s wrapped up in the safety and love of one Steve Rogers.
“Oh god, Steve, I need you now. Don’t stop, don’t stop touching me.”
It’s the wrong thing to say. So very wrong.
The door makes a loud thunk behind him and he looks around to make sure he’s not disturbing anyone. There are a few people in pews and he goes towards one himself to take a seat.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to say. I want his rebelliousness. His steadfast refusal to cave. I want the sassiness of his mouth and the way he can just cut you down to size like it’s nothing. He’s so blindingly beautiful I want to worship him. And he’s so clever. The things he’s built, I could only dream of. He runs his own company. He’s everything that an omega should be. Tony’s my standard now. And yes there are different omegas, who lead equally as valid lives, but him, he’s—he’s something else. I can’t explain it. And I know, I know I don’t deserve to have him. And selfishly I think about how he’s married to me, stuck with me. But even then, I can’t get him to love me with just that. And I think if he asked, if he really asked, I’d let him go. Even though it would kill me inside. There’d be no purpose after him.”
“Is Iron Man coming?” They could really use his repulsors right about now.
“This is only to get away from my parents. I’m miserable at home, and you guys are the only thing that keeps me sane. I’m here for you, not any other reason.” He makes grabby hands at the flask and Pepper passes it over.
“You liked it, I liked it, it’s enough. We’ll talk later ok?” And Steve is gone, leaving Tony feeling a wreck, standing there in a pool of his pants and underwear.
Tony watches as Steve grips his own hard cock—somewhere in the mix, Steve has shucked off all his clothes—and it’s the first time that Tony’s had a good look at it. It’s huge, with a purpling head that’s tight and shiny with precum and arousal. Steve hefts it, aiming down towards Tony’s entrance, the concentration on his face wrinkling his brow. Steve is so handsome, the lines of his jaw perfectly straight, the cream of his skin making his blue eyes stand out like jewels in the soft light of the bedroom as he focuses on Tony. If he’s being honest, Tony never thought Steve would look at him like this, like Tony matters and he wants to make it good for him.
“Things have changed so much since I was young. But I’ve seen how much more vibrant my omega parishioners are, as our laws march towards equality. There might be something to their happiness being the result of being given a choice.”
He pulls Steve out from under his nails, saying goodbye to the intensity and passion which he inflicted on the other man. He scrubs Steve from his glands, flushing his ignorant body’s hopes of anything that looks like permanency. He uses a chemical agent to dissolve his mucosal plug, letting all of what Steve put in his womb slough down his legs and into the drain, where dreams of children and white picket fences go to die.
“Well then. What do you think we can get up to while the kid takes nap time?”
“I do care,” Steve tries.
There’s also the fact that there’s at least ten of them wandering about, knocking over trash cans and breaking into stores. He almost laughs seeing a pig bust into a coffee shop straight through the windows and go for the pastries.
“Yeah that’s right, take his cock. Taste yourself on him. You’re going to take me so well, aren’t you omega? Gonna make you squirm on my knot.”
“Hmm, maybe there’s hope for you yet, Rogers.”
The rest of the Avengers are left arranging transportation and cars, Natasha passing Bruce his bag as he gets into Tony’s car while Clint and Natasha get into hers. He’s done everything to avoid Steve, who is still lingering in the background, seemingly waiting for something. Skirting around Nat, Tony hops into his car.
“Do I? Spontaneous designation changes are rare, but they do happen. I looked it up.” He turns back to Bucky who is idly picking at his burger bun, tossing little bread pieces onto the plate.
But what can Steve do?
“Oh I wouldn’t worry about that much. We’ll figure something out. Probably soon.”
“I need one shot for America, and one for the rest of them. And if it gets really bad, keep me away from the tequila, will you?” Tony’s tone is easy, but Rhodey understands the implication that Tony needs to be on his toes tonight.
“I think what I know is that Tony shouldn’t be messing around with half the things he does in his lab, and that if something has come back to bite him, I should be there.” He tries so hard, but it comes out biting and sharp, too emotionally invested.
his house, which is a good deal since he’s the bait for SHIELD and as such, Captain America.
“No, the rules are we stay. One flier at a time, and one to two ground units. We can’t afford to send Thor, and I need you here.”
Tony clamps down on him hard, his ass milking at Steve’s fingers. Tony is coming then, a cry that sounds torn from Tony’s throat.
“Not if you can’t go about this in the usual way. It sounds like you’re coming to me because you need us, not the other way around.”
“Hey Captain Fuckface, starve anyone today?”
“I’m sorry that happened to you. That never should have happened. You deserve better.”
“Hey, my conscience is clear. I mean, technically alcohol is a solvent.”
Really, Tony should get over it. It was an earlier hurt than Sunset. It was small and stupid, like they had been.
“You’re so pretty when you ask for my cock. Ask again?”
“God. Steve, you’re so big, god how are you so big?” And Steve, Steve is wondering how Tony is so unbelievably
I decided to add a little bit more to this for people who asked for Tony's friend's reactions. They are not happy. :)
“You can and you will.” Steve is thrusting hard now, adjusting his position as he’s balls deep inside of Tony, and it’s agony. Tony thinks he’s tearing, Steve’s cock splitting him wide open. He looks across the floor and sees Barnes, out cold. He should have killed the man when he had the chance. He shouldn’t have pulled his punches on Steve either.
So he makes her wait.
“Look Steve, this isn’t going anywhere. I don’t think you care about what you did, not really. You don’t really want to change. You just keep insisting that your way is correct, when it’s not. Did you feel like a monster when you denied him access to food? Did you feel anything at all?”
“You’re on the right track.” Steve has never been one for bullies. And he feels like trapping someone in an unbreakable glass cage counts as bullying.
“You will listen. You will not interrupt. This is already a waste of time. You’re a lost cause, Rogers. Fury seems to think there’s something redeemable here. I disagree, but he wants me to try.” That seems… harsh. He’s made some mistakes, it's true, but he only had the best intentions for Tony. He only wants the omega to be a little less flippant and irresponsible and just conform to what omegas
Tony cries and pleads some more, and that’s all it takes.
“No, they’re not.” Yes, they are.
Finally, they detach, Steve’s hands unclenching themselves.
“Oh! Hello again. Did you find what you were looking for?”
“That’s it babe, take my knot, fuck—” It undulates through Bucky, his orgasm reverberating back to Tony as he starts to come once more, cum oozing out of the slit of his cock this time, creating tiny little puddles on his belly that drip down his sides as Bucky rides Tony to his own completion.
“Nat, come on,” Tony implores.
There’s spittle connecting his mouth to Tony’s cock, and it spasms up in front of him, tapping the bottom of his chin. Steve looks up at Tony’s face, seeing his omega staring back at him slack mouthed, a vision of need and arousal. They lock eyes, and it’s like a shock to the system, like a cold limb being plunged into hot water, almost painful. It’s overwhelming, the intimacy of it, the way Tony looks and
“Less than a week after I married you.”
“Hey, if I do anything, it’s so we can have a better world the second time ‘round.” And Steve understands the look in Tony’s eyes. Aspirations for a remade world. There’ll always be corruption, but there’s something illuminating in helping save so many people, that they think future governments will be built on top of the selflessness of humanity instead of its blind ambition.
“Then give the pills back and we’ll think of something else.” Bucky releases the bottle to Steve, slouching back down into the booth as if he regrets it. Contemplative, Bucky rubs his jawline, scruffing his hands against his 5 o’clock shadow.
“I suppose you’ve heard then?”
“Damn.”
That’s more than enough time to stay away from public areas. Which means it takes a week for Rogers to corner him, and he must have solicited someone for help. Probably Natasha, that creeper, which is genius but also cruel and unusual.
Now that the battle is over, they’re all stuck in a fog of silence, each reviewing what happened that day in their minds. Tony still sees the wormhole, the edges of it so bright blue it burns his eyes as he zones out while staring at the dinged up chairs and tables. The flash of the bomb going off, the pull of gravity at his freezing body as he falls.
“Steve, please! Knot me, knot me,
“Steve, please.” That’s Tony begging to be let up, Steve knows, but it doesn’t matter to his Alpha brain. The Alpha hears something else entirely. It’s a goddamn symphony to his ears.
“We didn’t.”
—but he gets to have this.
“Listen. I’m one of the richest men in the world. I can buy my freedom, bucko.” Something about the way Anthony says that makes Steve recoil. Maybe Howard never intended for them to be together, but Steve can imagine that he certainly didn’t think his son would turn out like this. Anthony is nothing more than a fop with expensive and dangerous tastes. Exactly what happens to omegas when left unchecked.
had to keep Steve’s rescue from Tony even a second longer than necessary? I could almost accuse you of setting this up. If Tony doesn’t make it out of this…” Natasha trails off, accusing and threatening all at once.
“Do that, and we don’t have a problem,” she says, searching his eyes for a confirmation. He tries to give it to her, not looking away from her scrutiny.
He pressed the button again, just to feel something as he looked at the toxicity levels in his blood, to know that he was closer to death after wearing the Iron Man suit for probably not the last time, but one of the last. Heck, he could die in the thing if he wanted. The Iron Ghost in a metal coffin.
“Meet with them. Fifteen minutes, that’s all.” Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match, Tony thought. If he could keep choosing suppressants as his one-and-only, he would. They don’t steal the covers and not text you back. And like an NDA was going to keep an Alpha from bragging about being with Tony. It seemed everyone knew about Tony’s sex life but Tony, anyway.
“Colonel Rhodes is his guardian, and I’ve already gotten his permission to court Tony, which is legally binding as an approval for stealing him away.”
“You’re in love,” Iron Man says it with something like awe.
When it happens, Steve fights to keep his face from breaking out into a genuine, bright smile.
“Alpha.” Tony says it like a breath, wispy with unrepressed longing. “I want to sit up. I need—” Steve presses his arms under Tony’s torso, fingers catching on the fabric of Tony’s shirt as he rolls his hands underneath. Tony’s body is light, and it’s effortless to lift him, hold him. Tony splays his arms out on either side, helping Steve push Tony the rest of the way up.
He’s shushed with a kiss, Steve working his lips over Tony’s, kissing corner to corner before licking into the press of his mouth. Tony opens easily under him, his tongue coupling with Steve’s. They press into each other, teasing and testing, before Tony has to turn his head to the side to gasp.
“That is not how the drift works.”
But hell, Bucky. He doesn’t know what Bucky wants.
“Tony, you have to know. You have to.”
An hour. While being sandwiched between grade A Extremis. He wrenches the hair back on a well-muscled blond man, and thinks of Captain America, as another woman who he can’t see lays wet kisses down his sunscreen-covered back. That must taste disgusting but it’s not his mouth, so he couldn’t care less. The man in front of him is a perfect specimen, and he laves his tongue over a nipple to watch him shudder with wanton abandon. There’s nothing better than booze and a warm body. Well, maybe if it was Capsicle, then all of this would be elevated to a new level.
Tony kisses the way he fights, fast, brutal, efficient, giving no quarter and taking no prisoners. It’s like falling, flying, and floating in zero-G all at the same time. The way Tony moves should be banned in several countries, and it feels like Tony is examining the real estate of his mouth to settle indefinitely.
“I wouldn’t cheat. I may have few other rules in life, according to you, but I wouldn’t be unfaithful as a mechanism for getting out of this marriage. It would cost me a pretty penny to divorce under those circumstances. And it’s not bad enough to warrant that, yet.” Tony shakes his head and brings his hands up to cover his eyes and run them down his face. “Can we be done with this, please.”
“Ok, you got me. What is it this time?” Tony sighs and turns around, setting his tool down on the counter.
The door opens and they stand in an entryway that looks like it has some serious security. Natasha hits an intercom and tells them her name, and the door buzzes open. It leads to a second room where a beta is waiting for them.
The double doors leading out from the room bust open at that point, and Natasha and Thor are bodily carrying Clint between them. The man is covered in blood, and Steve’s stomach drops. He doesn’t know the man, but any human would feel upset at watching someone else suffer, only to turn into a mindless creature bent on consuming other people. It’s horrible. Everything about this is a special kind of awful.
“Very well. Blackout in effect.” JARVIS disappears.
But now that his Alpha and the rest of Steve were in agreement about the mouthy Omega, there was no reason to delay any plans to make his desires a reality.
“And you think they’d take it away from Captain America’s Omega?” Steve is certain they wouldn’t.
, and a ridiculous grin splits Bucky’s face wide. It’s then that Tony realizes—this is a lot like tag football. He just has to get a hold of the letter and Tony will be home free.
—that’s not what it is.
It’s with that, that Tony begins to scrub Steve off of him, a ritual in preparation for removing Steve from his soul.
chitters, low and curling, its sleek body whipping through the storm with a lazy sway that belied the danger therein. Rain comes down in torrents, and even through their helmets they could hear the pat-pat of it battering the cold steel that sat between them and their enemy.
Steve doesn’t know what to think, and he wonders what it was he felt on Tony’s chest, but he’s not about to press his luck.
Yeah. That seems like a good plan.
“Enough with the nicknames.” The goodwill drifts away from Steve’s face, and Tony forlornly remembers a time when he didn’t have to deal with people.
“Tony!”
Fury gestures for Steve to step outside the room.
, and
Tony flips the paper over, knowing full well there’s nothing on the other side yet nonetheless feeling as if he has to follow the motions of investigation lest his eyes water and the tears fall.
“Tony, baby, sweetheart, I’m going to knot you. Can I knot you baby?”
“So this can kill me?”
But Tony isn’t going to let him forget what they’re here for, even if it feels like breaking apart.
“Tell me Cap, is all that self-restraint worth it?” The little vixen in front of him is coy now, neck bared towards Steve, and Steve can hardly believe that three weeks worth of pills have brought him to this point. So succulent already. Tony wants to be plucked.
“Do you know why Howard did what he did?” The question stuns Steve momentarily.
Steve finally gets up to take a shower, using the cold water to dampen his desires. It’s effective enough, and he steps out, toweling off his hair and body. He looks in the mirror and sees someone he doesn’t know anymore. Was he really the alpha who had come in and decided for another person what their life was going to be from now on?
He’ll never get to hold him close after a long day of work, or tuck Tony into his bed. At least he can do little things, like feeding Tony or making sure Tony has dates for his events. Maybe even scent clothes if that’s what Tony wants. Anything to make him happy. Tony is in his veins now, coursing through him with every beat of his heart.
“Ok, we’ll try to reverse engineer this. Why do you think omegas are what you said: flighty, insipid, vain?”
Tony is rooted now, his mind planted firmly in the present moment where all he feels, all he is, is Steve’s. The thrum of his pulse roars through his ears, his senses dulled by the single focal point of the knot that is already inflating inside of him. It grows with each aborted thrust, each steady pump of cum.
escapes Tony’s throat at the vibrant red plug nestled inside. This had originally been one of Tony’s with a golden jewel at the end of it, but Steve has apparently borrowed it, removed the jewel, and replaced it with the image of Steve’s shield. “Oh, fuck, Steve.”
The ride back is only made possible by the suit’s navigational abilities, Tony staring into Steve’s eyes as if he’ll disappear the very next second. But Steve doesn’t. He stays mind-blowingly, maddeningly present, and Tony feels like his world has been flipped inside out and back again.
“You really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? What’s your secret? Drum circle? Capoeira? A big bag of weed?” He ignores the Captain and refers to Bruce for the sake of agitating the man. Steve has such confidence; he wants to
“Yeah? Well, it’s what I want. And I’ve waited long enough to take it.” Tony’s heart stutters. Steve is a sadist. All the times Steve has hurt Tony, he’s wanted to. It’s been a long road of not understanding why Steve treats Tony the way he does, when Tony wears his pain on his sleeve. All along it’s been a game to Steve. It stings worse than the pain of Steve pummeling his ass.
It’s only in Tony that he can lose himself, lose the past. Inside Tony, there is no loss, no drifting, or feelings of inadequacy. He’s sure he’s with the right person, doing the right thing, living the right life when Tony is in his arms.
“Stark!” Fury barks.
Fury is silent.
“Let me fucking clarify. He’s looking in the drift.”
“Take this and plant it within five feet of his main computer terminal. It’ll give you anywhere from ten to thirty minutes, but if it were me? I’d lean towards the lower end. We’re not more advanced than Stark, you’d just have the element of surprise and proximity. What is this for anyway?” The tech is distracted, but too curious. Steve is going to need discretion. He considers, only for a moment, killing this man. But Fury wouldn’t like that, and he has to trust that the head of SHIELD would only give this task to someone trustworthy.
“You could use SHIELD’s heat service. We know the efficacy of the pills you take. Where do you think they came from? You have months at most before you go into a heat that could kill you without an Alpha, without a change in suppressants.” Tony stopped at Fury’s words. Without turning around, he spoke.
“Sleep now?” He has to reign it in, maintain control. He’s the alpha, the one who should keep it together. Yet all he feels are the jagged edges of his self-mastery grinding and sanding themselves into dust.
Tony tells himself that Steve almost violated his consent. That maybe the man did. But inside he feels tremulous guilt, because if that’s what he could have from Steve, he would take it. He’d take every last bit of pain that Steve was willing to heap on him, because Tony was made to bear it. His jealousy rots in him; Barnes is with Steve right now, where Tony wants to be. He can acknowledge that now, and the reality that whatever Steve feels, it might be love.
In Steve’s hands is Tony’s future. Their future. These six little pills are going to free Tony.
“Bruce, he bit back.” While normally he’d be happy to see one of Tony’s teammates come to his defense, Steve thinks that Clint isn’t particularly concerned about Tony’s wellbeing. It makes Clint’s words sour, and Steve contemplates what he’s going to do about that. He won’t have Clint upsetting Tony, not anymore.
The gym welcomes him, the musky scent of sweat and exertion settling in his nose. He meets Bucky’s soft grin, the Alpha wolf’s pointed ears and fluffed tail hypervigilant as always.
“Good work team. Iron Man, a word?”
The door opens and Steve appears, as though he might not have been the one behind the door all along, or so Tony’s mind tells him.
He raises his eyebrows at Cap, entreating the man to parry his next words.
“What are heat prevention tactics and gland rubbing?”
They sleep then, for an hour or two, Steve doesn’t know, until Tony wakes up again and starts crawling over to Steve.
“Well, in this case, I’d say love isn’t blind because I’m gorgeous.” Tony tries to be nonchalant, but Steve can hear him swallowing saliva back. He can feel the heat rising off Tony like steam off bathwater as the man steps forward once more.
“Of course. Would you like to sit somewhere?”
And Tony doesn’t want to confirm.
“Please, don’t fight?” Tony begs. Bucky and Steve both are clenching him tightly enough to bruise, and Steve is pressing his cock hard into Tony’s body as he growls at Bucky. They’re close to a dominance fight, their pheromones coalescing in the air, thick with animosity, and Tony doesn’t think he would make it out from in between them if they decide to turn their anger into a physical altercation.
“You making dinner tonight? I don’t really want to cook.” The omega gives her alpha an exaggerated frown.
The nuke is speeding along at a cool 400 miles per hour. Tony’s suit can reach it in seven seconds, and once he does, he can match its speed exactly.  He’s got time.
“You never appreciated him like he deserves, Stevie. It’s only now that you want him, just because I do. Because suddenly he has value that I recognize. That’s all.”
Blasting out of Malibu, the suit propels him faster than any commercial airline, though not too close to cracking an SR-17 Blackbird’s time. He’ll fix that on rebuild.
“I know this might not be the ideal time, but I wanted to say you can do whatever you need to with your money, on the stock market. I shouldn’t have said anything.”
So unlike a slow-motion film, one moment their arms are loose about their captive, and the next they’re holding onto the Kaiju for dear life as it bellows out its pain. The unibeam releases a torrent of pure, unadulterated energy, slamming into the scaly skin of the Kaiju and shredding it like tissue paper. Gleaming blue blood saturates the window in front of them while
“You are not his friend.”
“I’ll take you to Fury.” Natasha gestures for him to come as Clint salutes goodbye.
“Shh shh baby, let me. Just let me.” And Tony does. The super-soldier, in a show of gentle that makes Tony aware of the raw power in Bucky’s hands, grasps his bare cock, towel now a sad victim of gravity.
“Will you come in with me?”
“It’s too late. She can’t stop now.” Selvig is turned around, and Tony can see the offshoots of sparks stemming from the machine before them. It would be beautiful, fantastic, if it were only the science to be concerned about. Spinning in place, the electric arcs look as though they’re getting stronger and more focused.
The man’s smile is like a wood chipper; it wants to rend him to pieces whether he likes it or not.
Steve smiles and huffs, but his pupils are more dilated than they should be as he looks off into the distance. Is it possible he’s reeking pheromones? There’s no way to tell with the suit on.
“When is it not about money Pepper? The city isn’t going to stay beautiful for free. Watch.” All around him, the sheep he’s shepherded into the gates of heaven, fall, and turn into their former, uglier selves. Witnessing their tears of agonizing stupefaction is more fun than he expected, and he chuckles as he pulls out his phone and sets the price at $99.99 a day for Extremis.
“Fine. That’s just fine.” The muscles of Tony’s face are tight, his jaw set, and he looks alert, more so than he’s been the past week. The meal must have done him some good, and Steve feels the sting of guilt that Tony might have genuinely been suffering without food. But he reasons that there’s always the sandwiches he’s been eating for lunch. So he’s not starving.
“That’s not going to work Tony and you know it.” Yes, but he would have liked to pretend a while longer that his whole life wasn’t crumbling down around him. SI would try to oust him now; there had been no provisions regarding his being an omega because he never presented as one, but that would hardly matter. The laws were clear on omega-alpha property being joint. Since all omegas bonded young, the joint property was to
Behind him, the doors swish open and clack back shut. Tony spins around in his chair to see his new favorite pal, Bucky.
“Just a– I’ll fucking kill him.” Nat stood at attention then, eyes glued to the door that was still jiggling as Tony tossed himself bodily against it. The room inside would be destroyed by the end, bedding clawed up and clothes torn to shreds. This was a particularly bad one by Steve’s estimates. He usually didn’t get violent with Pepper.
“I’ve wanted to ask, Tony, can I touch them? Please?” Steve was already in molestation range, the tips of Tony’s feathers hankering to drag themselves along Steve’s biceps and torso, to wrap themselves around Steve in a soft, plume-y hug. Just because he can’t control them, doesn’t mean he doesn’t know what their dirty little plans are.
“How were they even supposed to slaughter these things if they were bred to be eaten?” Clint asks the obvious question they’re all thinking.
“But you are. Clothes, on.” Tony glares up at her from his place on the floor. But Natasha takes no shit, stomping over to his closet and wrenching the doors wide open, tossing a clean shirt at him along with some socks, boxers, and a neatly folded pair of pants. Pants that Steve had folded.
Things don’t improve from there, but Tony thinks it’s still a fair equilibrium. The worst times are when they complete a mission.
“Tony. Tony, wake up.” Steve reaches over and grasps at Tony’s prone form, shaking him gently. The medical team starts to move, but Steve waves them off.
“I didn’t know that either.” Pepper doesn’t even attempt to dissemble.
“Who is he?”
“Now, I think you could take over the world, and it might not be such a bad thing.”
“So you’ve been waiting for me, is that it darlin’?” Tony turns over to his stomach before hitching up his hips, exposing his ass for Steve.
“He’ll go under conservatorship, and likely another Alpha in his life will take responsibility for him. It wouldn’t be your concern.” This omega shouldn’t be his problem at all. To wake up to this has been worse than he can imagine. Yes, everyone he knows is either dead or quite old, but to be shackled to a pale shadow of his past through Anthony Stark? Anthony, who represents everything he despises about omegas. Vain, flighty, self-obsessed, loose, addictive in personality. It’s too much.
“Time to look beautiful for me, San Francisco.” The air is cool, crisp, and glides around him like water. The world is his, and it sings it with every whip of the wind on his face.
“Is there anything else I can get you, Tony?” There has to be something that Tony wants that Steve can acquire. Maybe Tony will let him into the nest again. Maybe he can give Tony another toe-curling orgasm. The sweet little moans and keens from Tony still haunt his waking hours. He’s been half hard in his pants for most of the day, just ready to please Tony.
Steve pulls out the brick shaped phone that they gave him and dials Fury’s number. As he waits for the doctor to show up, he stands sentry at the foot of the bed, unable to move. He’s put the covers back on Tony, which has helped with the smell, but now that it’s in his nose, it’s impossible to forget or remove.
Not that the omega had likely done much to warrant looking after besides his lavish lifestyle. Steve saw that SI had stopped making weapons and had generally increased their market share while investing in clean energy, medical technology, and a host of other, smaller investments. Anthony must have good advisors.
“Now, which of these shoes best conveys my love for schmoozing?”
“I’m fine, I’m—oh fuck.” It hits again, crashing and battering against his self-control. He doesn’t think he can get up now. He’s only just realized that Steve can probably see his massive hard-on.
“Beg prettier, Tony. And maybe I’ll listen.” Oh no, oh god no.
Tony feels like a fucking slut, slamming his cock greedily into Bucky’s fist. He whines unevenly, ashamed, and Bucky steps forward to lick at Tony’s parted lips. His mouth almost snaps shut, but it’s too late; Bucky is inside, tongue tracing teeth and flesh. It’s impossible to keep silent, his pathetic little groans sneaking past the seal of Bucky’s lips.
“Ah! Oh yes, ok, um, well, is right here ok? I’d do the booth but we’re already talking face to face, unless you’d like the booth?”
Sometimes it was almost enough to forget Stane.
“At least you’re honest.”
“If I did this, I wouldn’t want to remember, because it’s not me. It’s just this body, this biology. And I have a right to never have to knowingly see the person who gets me through my heat, ever.” He lies. It’s a conversation, right?
“Easier than Tony is now?” Because Tony’s ruts are worse than unpleasant. He’s no longer allowed in his workshop or anywhere but his room when one comes on. Sometimes Pepper, a beta, joins him. Other times she won’t even go into his room. An interior decorator comes once every three months to repair the damage Tony does. If the man weren’t so obscenely wealthy, there would have been consequences long before this point.
under Steve, canting his hips up against the Alpha.
The door opens to reveal an agent that he’d seen before, but hadn’t formally met.
“Tony isn’t soft.”
“You’re forbidden from going out, even if your friends pay, until you figure out how to cook for yourself. I can’t believe this needs saying, but you’re circumventing the very consequences that will teach you how to take care of yourself.”
“I’m sorry, did you say…?” Tony has a vicious sense of satisfaction that Cap can’t keep up with the conversation. How dare anyone so pretty treat Tony like he’s the gum on the man’s shoe.
Steve had stayed silent and patient throughout Angela’s story, but the idea that an alpha had stolen her hard-earned funds, had coerced her into a pregnancy, something about it got to him. He’d controlled Tony’s finances. What if he had been coercing Tony and he had also taken away Tony’s money? He wasn’t as bad as David. He’d never tried to force Tony into a pregnancy, but something niggled at him that Tony should have the right to try and get away if he felt he needed to.
“Well, we got its attention. What the hell was step two?” He pauses to watch it lumber through the air before realizing he should probably regroup with the Avengers. It takes no time at all to find Cap, Hawkeye and Widow duking it out with an endless stream of Chitauri foot soldiers. He watches as Thor lands next to them. Tony zips by, playing air control over their little group. Most of what he hears is over the coms.
“But well, let’s get down to business here, shall we? You want to know how it was for us omegas in the past. Well, it wasn’t all peaches and cream living in the heart of the Apple, let me tell you. I was a real looker those days though. All my sisters said so. I was a cat looking to be a canary when I met Conall. He had this way of talking that made me feel like he saw every part of me.
Because Steve was right. Bond-dodging was illegal. At least your first bond. Divorce was allowed, with good reason and a year-long waiting period, and no one was forced to bond twice. The law was being protested in courts currently, with a great many promising cases for it being overturned. It hadn’t reached the Supreme Court, but it was expected to, which had three alphas, five betas, and one omega. It was a good ratio.
It’s nosing in his ass again, warm breath tickling his perineum. He doesn’t dare move, even when a long, wet tongue wedges itself in between his cheeks and
Tony, who takes him so well each time, babbling endearments while Steve pummels him. He’s brilliant and whip-smart in a way that Steve can’t compare himself to. Even if Steve’s blood hadn’t helped solve this crisis, he thinks that Tony would have figured out a way on his own at some point.
to me. Yes, I’m yours! Let me come, Captain Asshole!” Hearing Tony beg is doing it for Steve, and he pushes himself harder, pistoning in and out of Tony.
“You gonna come for your Captain, baby? Tell me you’re mine.” He watches Tony reach for his own cock, but bats the hand away from it, as Tony lets out a pathetic gurgle of want.
Right now, Tony has a hunt to go on, has to find Steve. He practically purrs at the thought of Steve playing hide-and-seek with him; his instincts all but demand that he seeks Steve out to tackle him to the couch, kissing and licking his cheeks and neck and chest.
The alcohol delivery system he’d rigged together so he didn’t have to remove his mask seemed childish now. Tony wondered why he didn’t just out himself sometimes, but his thoughts always circled back to designation. Omegas were fickle, emotional, flighty creatures with furnished souls.
“You feel so good. I knew you would be. Tony, have you ever even taken a knot before?” Steve is so close to orgasming again, but he thinks it’s unfair that Tony hasn’t even had one orgasm yet, so he refrains from moving too quickly.
!” It’s warm inside of him, hot, burning. Deep in his core, he’s being stretched, warped. Pressure has been building, like a flood against a dam, and he’s tight with anticipation for it. Finally, finally, it releases, sweeping him in a torrential haze, so strong it makes him spasm and twitch, arching his back towards Steve.
“—iridium. What do they need the iridium for?”
, even if he’s not, not really.
“Better get that. Can’t go to battle without our moral and upstanding Captain America.” It cuts him, the insult, and he scrunches his feelings down inside further. He’s messed this up again.
Sunset isn’t deterred. He’d call it brave, but what it’s always been is a serial disregard for the boundaries of others. As if she sees the wall, and thinks that its existence offends her, and she must scale it to see whatever is on the other side, even if there’s bloodletting in the process. Moth to flame, once again she walks towards Tony’s castle of emotion, sticky hands feeling for a way in.
“Don’t thank me yet. The first is that I’m going to say a lot of things I don’t mean during heat. You are not under any circumstances to assume I mean them when I’m done with heat. Is that clear?”
Tony howls, there’s no other word for it, and Steve grips at his hips harder, trying to hold them both together from shaking apart. Tony’s face is scrunched up with what looks like a painful desire, his body hunched and his skin shining with sweat.
They land back in the forest, tumbling away from each other.
And oh god, Steve really believes this, he realizes. The conviction he’s holding is that there’s been a grievous error with Tony. Something so wrong, that it would be a crime to not do something.
He’s not sure why he’s drawn to do it. In perspective, Nat said that she was on Tony’s side, and that Tony wanted Steve. Which, he could see it now. Scent it even.
“Omega, no.” Steve’s command is stronger now, and he can’t disobey. Doesn’t want to. He feels like he’s floating a little, and he pulls his jaw shut before Steve realizes that Tony was about to drool from just those two words. Reining it in is his top priority right now.
“Come on. You don’t want to be late,” Maria says.
Rhodey is tired. Does Tony look as tired as that? He must. He must look worse.
“Right now? I want that fat alpha cock in me, and when you’re buried knot-deep, I want you to spank me. Make me squirm on you.”
Cock already straining to orgasm, Steve sees a spark of awareness on Tony’s face. He needs to get on with it before Tony gets the idea to bite. He shoves back in, setting a sharp pace as he thrusts his cock halfway between Tony’s lips and out again. Steve thinks he’s got it measured now; only about three inches before Tony starts to choke, but it’s more than sufficient.
“None taken, sir.” Not that JARVIS didn’t have his own Opinions. For every harridan’s origin story, there was a haranguing mother-type lurking in their past. His just happened to be the person in charge of his life and an AI. JARVIS was forbidden from saying anything about Tony’s situation to anyone else, but he gave an earful to Tony when he could. At least until Tony threatened to mix him with concrete and render him inert.
There’s so many.
Tony felt a single digit, wet with lubricant that he has no idea how Steve got ahold of, penetrate him. Roughly, he jerks himself back on it, embedding the finger up to the last knuckle.
“They’re soft. They need protection! I don’t understand where we’re going with this.”
“I tried filing for divorce, but the judge issued a marital estoppel because I was pregnant. It said that because I agreed to the marriage, and the life of the fetus was potentially in jeopardy otherwise, I couldn’t go back on my marriage claim. There was no way to escape. I had no money, no job, and here I had this baby that was going to be born into this, this life. David wasn’t a bad alpha, a bad man. I know that. He was doing what he thought was right. But what he did, it’s wrong. I don’t regret being pregnant, but I lost my entire life.”
