It’s not just his Uncle Bucky who wants to color; Uncle Sam and Auntie Nat are the next ones to ask for a crayon and page to color. It’s not long before the Avengers-minus his Papa- are coloring.
“Yeah. Me too.” Tony smiles and rubs the bump lovingly. The idea of becoming a father was still terrifying and in all honesty Tony didn't know how he was going to do it. But at the same time he was excited to meet the little boy that was transforming his life.
The man turns away for a moment and presses his finger against his right ear, speaking to someone Steve can’t see. Steve eyes him closely, straining his ears to pick up any information that could be useful.
“You seem to be better at this than I am. I’ve been reading up on caring for babies and I still can't grasp it. I guess I’m not meant to be-”
“Okay,” Steve takes a moment to think it over. It would be easier and not as overwhelming. “You’ll be there, right? I won’t be alone?”
He scratches at the mark, wishing he could peel it away. He never should have let Tony bite him. He never should have believed that Tony was different.
A knock on the door captures his attention and he calls out for them to enter. Pepper enters the office and Tony shoots her a bright smile, only for it to falter when she doesn’t return the gesture.
Happy honks the horn, the sound startling Tony and forcing him to lift his head and pay attention to the situation. He had been expecting more traffic, or perhaps an angry driver. The last thing he expected to find was a stranger in front of the car with his hands resting on the hood.
His hands have gone idle, just like they had for the past few years. As much as he tries to distract himself with his inventions, he can’t find the motivation to do it.
“Good,” Brock’s tone is lighter, but still can’t be trusted. “Was that so hard? Know your place and we won’t have any issues. I’m in charge of you. You’re just an omega. The only thing you’re good for is getting fucked.”
The meeting is cut short when Tony’s phone chirps in his pocket. He fishes it out, trying to hide his grin when he sees Happy’s name and face over the screen. He answers the incoming video call, already expecting Happy to yell at him. Sure enough, the beta’s irritated voice fills the room.
Steve lowers himself down beside Tony and opens up his arms, smiling brightly when Peter is placed in them. “Hi, Petey. Are you happy to see me? Yes you are, huh?” Steve coos.
The rest of the party goes smoothly. Steve does his best not to let his anxiety get in the way and ruin a special occasion. Just as he suspected, his son wakes up and starts moving after Steve helps himself to a slice of cake. Natasha is closest and gets to be the first-technically second- to feel the baby’s little pushes and kicks.
“No, it’s not. You did nothing wrong.” Tony knows his attempt at reassurance wasn’t going to be enough, but he didn’t know what he was supposed to do or what he was supposed to say.
“Yes!” Peter cheers and throws himself at Tony, wrapping his arms around his neck and hugging him tightly. “Thank you, dad.”
Peter shakes his head at the bantering and continues to sort through the movies. His eyes fill with tears when he comes across their ridiculously huge Disney collection. His papa had been alive when Disney released their first film, and that’s when Peter figures his love for Disney started. They used to curl up on the sofa and watch Disney films together. His papa loved catching up on what he missed, and he made sure his son was there to experience it with him.
“I can drive you,” Tony immediately offers. He’s out of his seat in seconds, already ordering Jarvis to shut down the lab and open the garage.
“This. I wondered if I’d ever get a chance to do this again, and now I have him. And this time I promise to never let him go. I’d do anything to protect him.”
“You can just leave that there,” Tony gestures toward a spot by the door. Peter nods and leaves his backpack behind, then follows his dad into the living room. “You thirsty?”
“I know that!” Tony cries out. He panics from his outburst and steals another glance in the direction of the door, thankful to find it still shut. “I know,” he says, his tone softer than before. “Believe me I wanted to get him help, but he had been so worried about the baby and I guess I just thought it would be better to wait until after the baby was born. I didn’t want to stress Steve out anymore than he already is.”
Tony rolls his eyes and makes a gesture for Happy to shut up. He opens the door for Steve and helps him get out. Steve is still hesitant.
But his papa always told him if he wanted to meet his dad then he should. His papa would never be mad if he did.
“I’m not an anesthesiologist,” Bruce deadpans. “Unfortunately, this is going to be a natural birth. This is what you wanted, right?”
Steve takes a shaky breath. “This is fine,” he tries to convince himself. “Everything’s okay. I’m fine.”
“Fine. Trying to catch up on everything. And I know you’re calling about those contracts. I swear I’ll get to them.”
Peter rolls his eyes. “That’s not why I’m telling you this. I don’t want to be with you. You’re an asshole.”
Steve only groans again and he hangs his head. The pain is worse, preventing him from forming any words. Happy must understand because he answers for him.
Steve nods and opens his mouth to speak, only for a groan of pain to come out instead. He leans back in his chair and wraps both arms around himself. When he opens his eyes, he’s met with two sets of worried brown eyes. Doctor Patterson lays a comforting hand over his shoulder.
Then there was the last night they saw each other. Steve had been heavily pregnant then. Tony doesn’t blame Steve for that night, even though a part of him wants to. It had been him who had ignored Steve when he had been trying to tell him about their son. Tony had let his anger and disappointment get the best of him.
“Probably not as much as he used to,” Peter replies and takes a seat at the table. “But you totally freaked him out and I’m surprised he even wants to help!”
Since the devastating fall of an Avenger, Director Nick Fury vowed to never have the world suffer from a loss as great as that one again. He had made it his mission to find a way to revive the heroes the world so desperately needed.
There was nothing to worry about. Steve was safe under Happy’s care. Tony trusted Happy with his life, and he knew the beta was the right choice to keep his mate safe.
Steve’s eyes flutter and Bucky quickly reaches out to cup his face. “Steve. Hey, Steve look at me. Come on.”
“You should’ve gone.” Tony’s eyes glance down at the wound on Steve’s side, noticing the large red stain.
“Peter?” Steve raises a questioning brow. They hadn’t decided on a name for their son yet; whenever they tried it turned into a small argument over their chosen name, and eventually it got dropped. “Since when have you been picking out names?”
And for the most part Steve did. He continued to go to his meetings and create new relationships with the faces he encountered every Wednesday and Friday. Steve felt safe and welcome in his group, but more importantly he felt as if he had a purpose now.
“Steve, wait! Don’t!” Tony calls out to him. Steve stops and turns around to face him, eyes bright with tears and flooded with pain.
“Steve, don’t.” Tony comes closer until they’re standing near each other. He places both hands over Steve’s shoulders. “Whatever thoughts you’re having right now, don’t listen to them. That voice is a liar.”
“It’s just for a little while okay, sweetheart? I’ll be out of here soon and back home with you and daddy. Go easy on him okay? I love you so much, and I promise I’m going to do everything I can to get better because I want to be there for every milestone. I’m going to miss you so much. Don’t forget about me.” Steve leans down to press a kiss to Morgan’s head, letting his lips linger for a while.
“I’m scared. I know I’ve done this before but...it was different then. The doctors were cruel and...and Al-” Steve cuts himself off and buries his face back in the crook of Tony’s neck.
The day Steve brought home the dog, Tony knew his world was about to be turned upside down. It wasn’t that he had a dislike toward dogs; with the right training, they could be tolerable. But the one Steve found on the streets of Brooklyn wasn’t going to be easy to tame.
“Tony, if you truly believed that, then you wouldn’t be here telling me how worried you are about him being alone with Morgan.”
Tony is careful when he does get Steve into the shower. The water is tinged pink when it mixes with the blood, it’s an unsettling sight, but nothing compared to what he had walked into before.
“Dad?” Morgan says quietly and steps further into the room. He doesn’t even stir. “Daddy?” She tries again and this time gently shakes his shoulder. That does the trick and he lets out a small groan.
Tony takes his full mug over to his computer monitor and has Jarvis boot it up. He sips his coffee as he waits, and then once everything is up and running, he has Jarvis search for Steve again.
It’s a struggle to keep his eyes open. Three figures are looming over him. Then everything fades to black.
Hydra. Tony’s sure he’s heard that name before. It sounded so familiar to him, and yet he couldn’t remember where he heard it. He tries to think back on that night with Pierce, but his memory was still failing him.
“She’s right,” Bruce adds with a sad sigh. “Steve wouldn’t have wanted this. He wanted Tony around, remember?”
His fingers begin to tighten and squeeze around Steve’s windpipe. The baby would lose oxygen. It would die and Tony wouldn’t have to worry anymore. He just needed to apply a little bit more pressure and-
They ride in silence for a couple of minutes. Peter finds the courage to look up at his dad, hoping he’d say something first. He never does.
“Sorry, Papa, but I have to go.” Peter scrambles to his feet and gathers his backpack, tossing it over his shoulder. He makes sure the flowers are still arranged perfectly, then he lays a hand over the bronze shield. “I love you.”
“Are you done?” Rhodey questions. “We can talk if you’re done. I’m not doing this with you, Tony. I’m tired of seeing you this way. All you ever do is beat yourself down.”
Peter is absolutely perfect. Steve can’t bring himself to look away from his son’s beautiful form. He’s tiny and fits perfectly in his arms, like he was meant to be there and nowhere else. His hair is dark just like Tony’s and Steve already knows his deep blue eyes will fade to brown.
With each passing hour, the contractions get worse and more intense than the ones prior. Steve was usually pretty good at handling pain, and even though he’s been through labor more times than he likes to admit, the pain of bringing a child into the world never failed to to test his limits.
“That makes two of us. Be good for your papa okay? He’s scared. Do you blame him? You’re gonna be a handful, aren’t you? But we love you anyway.”
“Really? The bed, too?” Tony huffs, tugging harder on the blankets around him to get the dog off. His efforts prove futile. The dog peers up at him from its new sleeping spot, and Tony glares at him.
“Steve?” It’s Tony. His hand is rubbing along Steve’s shoulder, trying to stimulate him awake. “Hey, it’s okay.”
“I believe you and Peter need more time to get to know each other and create a bond. You have 15 years to make up for.”
They still struggle to find time for more dates. But that was to be expected with a new baby and the changes that came with parenthood. Tony wasn’t going to give up though. If he couldn’t treat his husband to a night on the town, then he’d find other ways to pamper him. Steve deserved it after everything he’s been through.
Bruce can only nod his head. He was at a loss for words. It didn’t make any sense. One minute Tony was happy and on his way back to New York, and the next his face is on every news channel with a headline Bruce never imagined seeing.
“I needed a distraction,” Tony says, turning around to pick up where he left off. He doesn’t get very far.
The door shuts behind his uncle. Peter dresses quickly, fighting with the t-shirt that he assumes belongs to his uncle Bucky. It’s too large around his small frame but it beats the suit he was forced to wear for most of the day.
Steve obliges and wraps his lips back around the head of Tony’s cock. The alpha hisses in pleasure and throws his head back, his eyes squeezing shut as he focuses on the sensation of Steve’s hot mouth. Steve works the rest of Tony’s cock with his hand, smearing the mixture of precome and saliva along the length. He cups the alpha’s heavy balls and that’s what brings Tony over the edge.
The guilt he has still weighs heavy on his shoulders. His son would be home if he had taken better care of him. He wishes he could go back somehow and do things the right way, care for his son the way he was supposed to have. It was a miracle that Peter was even alive. Steve would never forgive himself if his son didn’t make it.
The pups all gather around when daddy comes home with a special present. They know it’s for mommy, but they can’t help but grow curious.
Tony leans in and pecks Pepper on the cheek, then he’s leaving the office to meet his new interns. All he can think about is Steve and the pup while he shakes hands with SI’s future employees. He still has his doubts, but the more he thinks about the baby, the more he yearns for it to be his.
It’s not surprising when Morgan is picked up from school one day and she finds the backseat empty. Happy explains that Peter was staying behind to practice for his decathlon and would arrive home later. Morgan doesn’t mind. For once she’s able to talk about her day.
“Okay, okay,” Tony chuckles. His gaze falls on his oldest, a sad sigh leaving him. James was so quiet. “James, come here.”
Steve sighs and flips through the book, skipping over most of the letters until he’s in the P section. He doesn’t even bother reading the ones he comes across, knowing Tony will only harass him.
Steve nods. Tony can see how shiny his eyes have gotten just by speaking about his former friend. He decides not to push for details. The last thing he wants to do is pour salt on the wound.
Steve is wheeled up to the side of the bed and he takes Tony’s hand, squeezing it as if to say ‘you got this.’ And that’s all Tony needs.
Steve has to turn away to hide his growing blush. And just in time too because he catches Harley climbing up the stage steps and toward the podium.
“Come on, Steve. Push!” Tony encourages, excitement growing in his voice when the baby’s shoulders emerge next.
Tony smiles. It falters quickly. He doesn’t want to go. He doesn’t want to leave Steve behind. But this had to be done. Steve needed this.
If you haven't noticed I'm adding tags as I go lol. I keep getting ideas for this story so that's why new characters are popping up and tags are being added.
Natasha chuckles from somewhere behind him. Steve turns slightly, wincing from the dull ache that has yet to disappear in his lower half. He finds her sitting on the bed beside him.
Steve inhales sharply and continues to flip through the book. He doesn’t mean to get so frustrated. He was usually calmer than this, but now he’s annoyed, more so than he’s ever been. And all because of a name. Well, Tony’s behavior, but even then he rarely got this pissed off.
Steve reaches up to tangle his fingers in Tony’s hair, pulling on the strands and forcing a groan from Tony’s lips. Tony grinds down, feeding Steve the friction he’s desperately craving. His own clothes are still on, robbing him of the feeling of Steve against him. Tony breaks the kiss to shed his own clothing. Then he’s finally able to feel Steve.
The guards are ordered to leave and the door shuts behind them. Steve doesn’t move when the alpha comes close to get a better look at him. Steve feels like he’s on display, every inch of him is being looked over.
The room he’s been wheeled to is just down the hall from Tony’s private suite. It’s smaller in size and lacks most of the accommodations of the other room, but it has a bed, an armchair, a connected bathroom and a space for the doctor to gather any supplies.
“Better?” Steve asks once Tony has been administered the drugs. Tony hums in response, a smile forming over his face.
He had never expected to have such strong feelings for Steve. Falling in love wasn’t something that happened very often for Tony. He was reserved and decided being alone was better than risking hurting someone he loved. But Steve opened new doors for him, showed him that love did exist and that he wouldn’t have to go through this life alone.
At the sound of his name Tony is wiping away the proof from his crying. It’s obvious Peter knows, but he doesn’t call him on it, and instead he’s coming over and sitting down beside him on the floor.
As usual, Morgan is up early and demanding food. Steve stirs from the familiar sound, but before he can get up, Tony is already climbing out of bed to tend to her.
Morgan continues to stare up at him. Steve’s smile grows brighter. He couldn’t get over how perfect she was. His heart fluttered every time she looked at him.
“I’m not…no no I’m not pregnant. Tony, I swear I’m not -ah!” Steve cries out abruptly, throwing his head back against the couch when the cramps start up again. They’re coming faster now and more intense than the ones before it.
“Not as perfect as you,” Tony whispers and leans down to connect their lips again. He trails a hand between them, letting it settle just below Steve’s belly button. “I want another pup.”
Peter is even more excited about the tower than he was about the car. He doesn’t stop talking and pointing things out that excite him. Tony has to practically drag him away and out of sight from anyone still working. He prays that Happy and Pepper don’t cross their path. He’s not ready to introduce Peter to them yet.
His stomach is upset again, but this time Peter doesn’t pin the blame on his morning sickness. He was nervous, more so than he’s ever been. For the first time in his life he was ditching school. Not once has he ever gone against the rules, but today he had no choice but to be rebellious.
Steve turns on the faucet and gathers some water into his cupped hands, splashing himself in the face and along his neck. His stomach churns again and he gathers more water, this time to drink.
“Yes! Yes, fuck, Tony!” Steve cries out when each thrust hits his prostate, and he writhes, fighting against the cuffs keeping him in place. The bed frame creaks in protest, threatening to give out.
“I won’t hurt you,” Tony says again and he steps toward her, raising both hands up to show her that he wasn’t going to take her life like he had just done to the alphas. “I want my son. Tell me where he is.”
“It was just gas, hon.” Tony teases. He chuckles when Steve frowns. “I’m kidding. He almost smiled for me. Maybe he just likes you better.”
“Oh my God,” Peter groans. “Who cares! I’m the one who has to deal with the weird looks and the comments. You’re not making any sacrifices here.”
Steve is aware of the agonizing screams he’s producing, but he can’t bring himself to stop. Bucky is doing everything he can to comfort him, but his attempts aren’t working anymore.
Steve shakes his head and leans down to kiss Tony again. Tony quickly takes control of the kiss, pulling Steve closer and flipping them over until Steve is on his back and he’s hovering over him. Dodger barks again, and Tony groans.
“It’s not okay,” Peter says, then to his uncle he adds, “leave him alone. He didn’t even do anything wrong. Stop trying to be him because you can’t.”
“We’re fine. She’s smiling more and has officially fit her toes in her mouth.” Steve laughs at this, the sound bringing a smile to Tony’s face. It’s been so long since he’s heard that beautiful sound. “And she’s so smart. Tummy time is the best. I think I enjoy it more than she does.”
“I’m sorry,” he whispers and his eyes fill with tears. “But I can’t keep you. I can’t. I’m not ready to be a parent.”
Bruce nods and slips his glasses back over his eyes. “Keep him comfortable. The stress isn’t good for him or the pup.”
Steve chuckles and places a hand over the growing bump. They have yet to feel their son move, and he couldn’t wait for that time to come. He knows once he feels his son move for the first that he won’t be able to get enough.
Tony doesn’t even wait for Steve to get her, not that he was really expecting him to. Morgan is calmer now that she’s in Tony’s arms, her brown eyes transfixed on his face and warm smile.
Aww they’re gonna get married. The three of them make such a cute family!!! I think this story probably has one more chapter and then it will be complete. It’s been a fun ride 😊
Steve was on his mind every second of every day. When Pepper handed him new contracts or forwarded him emails he needed to reply to, all Tony could think about was Steve. His company was going to crumble if he didn’t put all his focus into it, but sometimes Tony didn’t care. He’d let SI fall.
“You are,” Tony says, almost as if he can read Steve’s thoughts. “I don’t know what the others did...but I won’t do that to you.”
“What if it is? I can’t lose anyone else. And my uncle Sam he...he’s the one leading us right now. Everything will fall apart for good if he’s gone.”
Flash approaches them, eyeing Ned for a moment before settling his gaze on Peter. “Can we talk? Alone?”
A few feet away is his uncles, both in a similar position. For all his fifteen years, Peter has rarely seen his uncle Bucky cry. He was always strong, never backing down from anything and ready to stand up and fight. But now he wasn’t himself. He was broken.
This little family is going to get their happy ending. They deserve it after all of this. Thank you so much for reading! ❤️
The topic of Steve’s death never popped up in conversation. When Tony was curious and needed answers, Peter avoided talking about it. Tony knew it must be difficult for the poor kid to talk about the death of his father. Tony could relate. He didn’t talk about the death of his parents to just anyone. He kept that pain buried deep inside until finally he couldn’t push it down any further.
Steve goes limp and Natasha has no choice but to set him down. She curses and props him up against one of the walls that’s still standing. She’s able to get a good look at him now. Steve’s skin is white, all of the color draining from his face. He’s panting heavily, his chest rising and falling with each intake of air he takes. One glance down shows how hard he’s holding himself, his glove and surrounding material of his suit drenched in crimson.
Peter smiles and turns to leave, only to rush back to his uncles and hug them, making sure to start with Bucky.
“Why did you have to go?” Peter sobs, his body trembling from both the cold rain and the intense sobbing. “You promised you’d always come back.”
“But if I didn’t have the serum you know I’d be dead right now. The point is, I hurt myself and I could easily do it again, or worse, to you or Morgan. And I can’t, Tony. I can’t do that.”
“Shh,” Tony soothes and rubs along Steve’s back. “It’s okay. Don’t apologize, sweetheart. It’s not your fault.”
Tony tips his head back, his own eyes falling shut as he focuses on the feeling of Steve’s walls gripping his cock. He forces his eyes open, not wanting to miss a second of Steve’s enjoyment. Just watching his mate take what he needs and enjoying it brings Tony closer to the edge.
Pepper rolls her eyes. “Not even a little. Seriously, Tony you need to stop this. The event was for you to shake a few hands and contribute to their cause. And instead you get drunk and sleep with the first person you find.”
It wasn’t to say that the rest of his teammates weren’t happy about the news; they all made sure to congratulate him, and for the most part they seemed sincere. But the silence that followed only meant that they had questions.
“Let’s go see Papa,” Tony whispers to his son, taking Peter over to where Steve is sitting. Steve glances up, quickly using one hand to wipe away his tears.
He purposely picked one of the happier messages Steve had sent him. He’s listened to all of them, but the one he could listen to forever was the one Steve had sent when Peter was just a year old. There was a hint of sadness in his tone during the first half of the message-the part Tony struggled to get through-but then he sounds happy as he talks about their son and the first step he had taken.
Steve groans again, gritting his teeth when the contraction peaks. The pup drops lower, creating an uncomfortable pressure deep in his pelvis. He manages to glance around the room, heart sinking at the realization that he’d be giving birth here and alone.
Steve can only sob harder. The sound is painful, and a part of Tony hates that he’s the reason for causing his husband such immense pain. But it needed to be done. It was for the best.
“I can’t.” Steve pants and he pulls back. He leans back on his haunches and runs a hand through his sweaty hair. “I’m sorry. Tony, I just can’t.”
A commotion ahead has Steve back in defense mode. He takes the first incoming men down with a combination of his shield and his fighting skills until there’s only one of them left. Steve half expects the man to drop his weapon and run in the opposite direction, but Steve isn’t that lucky and the fight continues, all while the compound falls around them.
He finds none of those things upon entering the kitchen space. He frowns, brows wrinkling in confusion as he wonders where the alpha had gone. There’s no note or any sign of his presence. It’s a little unnerving.
His relationship with Steve was changing. Ever since they kissed and expressed their true feelings, they’ve grown closer. There was still so much they needed to learn about each other, but they were working on it.
He appears to be the only one that has a dislike for the team's four-legged member. Everyone else on the team has taken a liking to the dog, some even suggesting that the dog become the team's mascot. Tony shut Clint’s idea down real fast.
“You’re not!” Steve’s voice rises slightly. “You’re not,” he says again, this time a little calmer. “I need to do this. Look what I did, Tony. I tried to kill myself...and for a second I was successful.”
Happy grumbles and releases the firm grip he has on Peter. Peter peers up at him and mutters a ‘thanks’.
“What if you hadn’t been this lucky? If I lost you I don’t know what I would do. I can’t-Tony, I can’t lose you. I…”
Morgan doesn’t fuss when Steve straps her into the car seat. He lays a blanket over her tiny form then rushes around the room to grab her diaper bag. He doubles checks the contents and adds a few more items, then he takes Morgan downstairs.
The bed is cold when Tony wakes, a surge of panic rushing through him when he realizes that Steve isn’t lying beside him. Tony is out of bed in seconds, rushing down the hall and straight for the nursery. One glance inside the room shows Morgan in her crib peacefully sleeping. A sigh of relief escapes him.
Tony lingers around the nursery, putting away the new items. He can’t help but smile to himself as he pictures bringing his son home and showing him the room they’ve built.
”I’m just saying, boss.” Happy holds up his hands in defense. “The press will say anything these days.”
It’s bittersweet. He wanted to experience everything Tony was lucky enough to go through to bring their son into the world. He wouldn’t mind the constant aches and discomfort or the mood swings and food cravings. He’d love to feel the little kicks and rolls from inside.
But the damage was done and Peter had managed to sneak aboard the jet and hide out until he was sure the Avengers had landed. He didn’t even risk revealing himself. His plan was to hide out until the team left the jet, and then he would crawl out of his hiding space and try to help. And if it went well, then he'll reveal himself and everyone would be happy that he was there. And if it failed...well...there was hiding back on the jet and hoping they never noticed him.
Steve rushes toward the toilet, dropping down to his knees and emptying the contents of his stomach into the bowl beneath him. The nausea passes, but the uneasy feeling in the pit of his gut remains. He moves away and until he’s resting against the wall. His hands travels up to his head, fingers grasping his hair and pulling hard. More tears are spilling from his eyes now and he no longer cares about his appearance.
“Aw.” Tony places one hand over his heart and comes over to properly greet his son. “I missed you too, kiddo. But daddy had to do boring business stuff.”
“Steve, look at me,” Tony says and Steve does. “You’re beautiful. You’re perfect. Let me see you. Let me see you enjoy this.”
It would be easier to come clean and confess that he had strong feelings for the Captain; it would surely lift that incredulous weight off his shoulders. But then there was wondering what kind of reaction Steve would have, and it sends Tony spiraling into another panic.
But regardless of the heart he had, he still managed to destroy someone else’s. He never woke up every morning with an agenda to hurt people. His company was proof that he cared about others. He wouldn’t be creating new tech to clean and save the world if he didn’t.
Steve wears a fake smile for most of the party. The last time he had all of his friends together like this was during the party Tony had thrown to celebrate their successful mission. It seems like such a long time ago.
Steve tries the door across the room, somehow hoping that it would open and he would be free. But the lock is still in place, preventing him from leaving.
Steve curses again for an entirely different reason and sets his phone down on the kitchen counter. He places both hands on the sides of the granite surface, fingers gripping it tightly as he waits for the contraction to taper off.
“Speak of the devil,” the omega says with a roll of her eyes when Tony steps out of the elevator and into the room. He’s whistling a happy tune and has a brown paper bag in one hand and a disposable cup holder with three large, white paper cups in the other.
Steve moves slowly toward his mate, planning his next words carefully. He had been where Tony stood, quietly struggling and not knowing how to talk about the issues he was dealing with. Tony had been so good to him then, and now it was Steve’s turn to comfort his mate.
Peter whimpers, his face contorting again in distress, only to relax when Tony continues talking to him.
The cover is worn out from years of use and the damage it sustained from the latest mission. It was too hard to look at it and all the images inside, so it was Peter’s decision to put it back where it belonged. He changes his mind now and flips through it, smiling at the sketches he finds.
Steve is currently in the living room, sitting on the couch and eyes transfixed on the bassinet beside him. Morgan is sleeping peacefully. Steve hasn’t made any contact with her since that night of his latest outburst. Tony’s been having to do a majority of the caring. He was fine with it, but at the same time he hated seeing Steve so distant with their daughter.
He stops right under where Peter is hiding, speaking into his comm. Peter can’t make out the other half of the conversation, but he knows it's his other uncle. He can't help grimace from the sappy exchange he's forced to hear. Sometimes he preferred it when they bickered instead.
Steve nods. He knows the cry, too. But instead of asking for her, he surprises Tony by saying, “There’s a bottle in the fridge. I’ll warm it.”
He just wished the one time Tony decided to sleep wouldn’t be when their daughter was going to be born.
Tony’s said it a thousand times, and he’ll say it again. He wished he could go back and change what he did and the pain he caused.
Tony scoffs. “Trust me I’m trying not to. This kid has been the only good thing in my life. You know, besides you and Rhodey and Happy. You guys are my family.”
“I want you so bad,” Tony assures. “But I don’t want the kids to come down stairs and find us like this. And I want to make love to you in our bed.”
He finally gets to tear into the gifts halfway into the party. He’s eaten more than he’s ever had in his life and he wasn’t about to complain when Pepper suggested he sit down on the sofa and open presents. He almost didn’t want to rip apart the perfectly wrapped boxes but his curiosity won over and he couldn’t help but shred the paper until he was making a mess on the floor.
“Hey.” Tony rounds the island to get to Steve and he places both hands over his shoulders. “I want to. I think I owe it to you.”
Tony was a wonderful father. Steve had been hesitant at first, not sure how Tony was going to be taking on a huge, responsible role. There was a difference between running a billion dollar company and raising a couple of pups. But Tony was already proving that he could do both.
“Hey she’s not the first thing I’ve saved from an alley,” Bucky defends and scratches under the cat’s chin. She continues to purr.
“I’ll do it,” Pepper says and she rises to her feet. She walks toward the door, then she turns around to face him. “Be careful, Tony.”
“She’ll be okay. Just relax and enjoy tonight.” Tony smiles and brings Steve’s hand up to his lips, placing a kiss to the soft skin.
Steve growls in warning, but it does nothing to ward the alpha off. A dark chuckle leaves Rumlow’s lips and he steps closer, backing the omega into a corner. His strong hands are on Steve in an instant, manipulating the omega and forcibly turning him around, pressing him into the cement wall.
Steve lets out a huff and glances down at his watch. Ten minutes. That’s what Tony said was all the time he needed to get ready. And that was twenty minutes ago.
“I know, but we haven’t had any time together since she was born, and it’s obvious you need a break.”
Peter sits down as instructed, his hands in his lap and head cast down. He sneaks a glance when he hears his parents, his stomach coiling at the sight of them. He does his best to keep calm, but something tells him that he was in a shit ton of trouble.
“Let me go!” Steve screams and he wrestles against the man pinning him down. Steve’s eyes go wide when his throat is gripped tightly. His body writhes against the alpha above him, his legs kick out and his arms fly up to try and push his abuser off. The room fills with the sound of the omega’s struggling.
When they break apart, they’re both crying. It’s Steve’s turn to wipe the tears from Tony’s eyes. He cups Tony’s face in his hands.
“I’m only trying to help,” JARVIS replies, his tone cool and collected. It only pisses Tony off more.
“Then how do you know? For all you know he could have made it up for money or publicity. Stories like that happen all the time.”
Tony can’t take his eyes off the little smiley face staring back at him. He frowns, his expression opposite from the result the test shows. Was he supposed to be that happy? Was he supposed to wear a huge grin?
It’s at this moment when Tony remembers the folder he’s kept tucked away and out of Steve’s reach. The results of the test is just a painful reminder that he had done something behind Steve’s back and made it worse by continuing to hide it. He should’ve come clean about the test when he first asked Bruce to perform it, and again when the results arrived.
“James,” he calls out to the oldest, but the pup doesn’t regard the name. He probably doesn’t even know that’s the name his mother had assigned him at birth. For all Steve knows Hydra could’ve called him something else. “It’s okay,” Steve assures, keeping his tone calm. “I won’t hurt you.”
It must be noticeable too, because as soon as Tony senses Steve’s presence, his smile is fading and a deep, concerned frown takes its place.
Steve follows Tony out of the room and down the hall toward the large master bedroom. It’s been too long since he’s stepped foot in here. Everything was still the same. The only difference was the bassinet set up beside Tony’s bed.
It’s coming together nicely. Steve regrets not helping in getting their son’s room in order. Clearly more needs to be done. Piles of clothes and blankets are on top of the dresser; Steve figures Tony couldn’t figure out where to put the smaller items and set them aside for later. It was a task Steve could handle.
Peter doesn’t immediately go home after his first encounter with his dad. It would be too suspicious to come home early when his aunt and uncles believed he had gone to school. There was always telling them that he left school early because he couldn’t deal with being back, but that would just be another lie.
Keeping a secret as big as this one for years wasn’t difficult. Nick was used to hiding information. But occasionally he would get the urge to let at least one person in on his project.
Steve is left to watch as his mate is thrown into the backseat of the SUV before a sack is placed over his own head and he’s given the same treatment.
“I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Steve continues to scream, his throat burning. A hand is placed over his mouth, blocking out any more of his screams.
Tony fights the urge. He wasn’t about to force himself on this omega. He was raised better than that. He may have a past playboy reputation, but even in those days he knew how to respect omegas. They weren’t property and sexual objects.
“Can wait. Come on,” Tony takes Steve's hand and leads him away from the counter. “Come back to the party. Bruce just got here.”
He’s at Steve’s side in seconds, taking his hand and intertwining their fingers. “I’m here. It’s okay,” Tony soothes.
“I don’t know but I think you need to be careful. You can’t trust people, Tony. And I know you feel sorry for him but...for all you know he could be a really good manipulator.”
Steve is pushed forward and the hand on his shoulder tightens as Brock steers him out of the room. The little pup still in Steve’s arms whimpers into the dark.
It was pathetic loving someone who was never going to love him back. He wishes that they never met. He was better off working alone and marrying Pepper one day. But the vision of them together was clouded. All he could see was Steve.
“Tony!” Pepper calls after him when he rushes out of the office and toward the elevators. She follows him. “Tony, what is going on?”
Tony tries to bring Steve close, and this time he’s granted permission. He holds Steve tightly, letting him cry and get whatever pain he’s feeling out. Tony talks sweetly to him and trails a hand along Steve’s back.
The small whimpers his son makes is enough to force Steve’s fears aside, and let his instincts take over. He comforts his son, holding him close and softly shushing him until he’s calming down.
“That is not why I marked you.” Tony can’t help the small snarl that escapes. His own emotions were rising, the anger quickly becoming something he knew he wouldn’t be able to control for long. “I did it because I love you. I wanted you. I wanted us to be together and raise our son.”
Steve is exhausted by the time they get back to the compound. He wasn’t used to the fatigue. The serum made sure to take care of that in the past, but as of late he’s found himself struggling with the new changes his body was going through. Now that the pregnancy was over, he thought he would be bouncing back to what he used to be, but he was quickly learning how wrong he was.
“I love you, Morgan. I’ll always love you. Be good okay?” Steve leans in to press a kiss to her head. “I’m sorry,” he whispers against her hair.
Feeding isn’t so difficult anymore. Peter already knows where to go when Steve positions him near his chest. The sensation is still odd, but Steve enjoys this time with his son. This was their chance to bond.
Tony walks Bruce back to the jet and waves goodbye. He watches as the jet leaves and eventually disappears into the clouds. There’s a giddy smile on his face when he goes back inside. All he can think about is Steve and their baby.
Steve shakes his head and releases his hold on Tony. He backs away. “No you don’t. You don’t do the things that you did if you love someone.”
They clean up together, then settle in the living room. Tony pours himself a glass of wine while Steve sips from his glass of water. The conversation of their parents comes up, a topic Tony had been hoping to avoid.
And maybe Peter could too. His life would be harder and he wouldn’t share the same struggles as Ned, but he could still graduate high school and get into MIT. He could still have a life. Maybe not the one he originally envisioned but he could have one just the same.
His experiment was supposed to help his son avoid doing what he had done years ago. Tony had hoped if Peter relived that moment that he might come out stronger than he had before. But now as Tony watches Steve’s final moments, he regrets putting Peter through this a second time.
At the sound of his name, Tony is rushing back into the room, carrying a few towels in his hands. He doesn’t even need to ask what’s wrong, the sight of blood and Steve’s panicked expression is all he needs.
Tony gives up on creating a suit to join his son. They spend rest of the evening watching the videos and remembering Steve.
“No!” Steve screams, reaching out to take his pup back. He’s slapped again, this time harder than before. He grabs his cheek and peers up at the alpha with tear filled eyes.
Bucky opens his mouth to interrupt again but Sam stops him, squeezing his thigh to tell him to back off.
The elevator takes her to her destination and she’s grateful that her auntie is home. She’s greeted with a warm smile and that’s when Morgan loses all of her composure and breaks down.
“Fuck.” Tony growls and leans down to capture Steve’s lips in a kiss. Their lips move sloppily. Steve pulls away, head tilting back when Tony hits that spot inside of him. Tony grunts and aims to hit that spot again. “Does it…feel good?”
“Relax,” Tony assures with a grin. “It looks good on you. A little small but...good. I just want you to feel comfortable.”
“No. That’s shitty of me to let you do that. It’s my fault, right? You clearly didn’t ask for this.”
“Yeah. Yeah, of course.” Tony twists his body to rummage through the nightstand drawer. He comes back with a bottle of lube and a condom. “You meant this right?” he teases and Steve rolls his eyes.
“You feel so good,” Tony grunts and thrusts forward, burying himself completely in Steve’s tight heat. Steve smiles up at him and stretches out his hands, begging Tony to come closer. Tony drops down, using his arms to steady himself.
It’s after school when Peter tracks Flash down. It was safer for them to talk when no one else was around. There would be a few lingering students and staff, but not enough that would make them both uneasy to be in each other’s presence.
“Where’s your other half?” Clint is the first to ask. Steve’s eyes flicker in his direction, not missing the bored expression on his face.
Tears have gathered in Steve’s eyes now and despite his best efforts to keep them from falling, he can’t hold them back and they roll freely down his face. He tries to pull his hand away to wipe at them, but Tony brings his hand back.
Brock eyes the knife in the omega’s hand, then he’s shifting his gaze and connecting their eyes. “Going somewhere, Omega?”
It’s hours later when he’s free to go. There wasn’t anything that could be done for him. All he could do was go home and rest.
Even JARVIS sighs. “He’s getting more decorations, Captain. Apparently, he needed to...up the scare factor.”
Natasha offers to help bake the cake with Peter while Bruce and Sam decorate the common room. Bucky disappears the moment the banner that reads ‘Happy Birthday Steve’ goes up.
Tony doesn’t move. He blinks a few times. “Would it-would it matter? Of course it would matter. Why would you say that?”
Tony nods and crawls closer to be near his boyfriend, happy to be able to hold him. Steve welcomes the embrace and curls up against him.
Tony thinks it’s a waste of time to paint the spare bedroom, but Steve insists that they do. In just a few months they’d be welcoming their first child. At just twenty weeks pregnant, Steve is already glowing and bursting with happiness. Tony’s never seen him this happy.
“Good.” Tony seems pleased with that answer. He directs his attention back on his son. “Now, kiddo, let’s go find your costume.”
Natasha and Clint are with him, watching from the other side of the large glass window as the pups are looked over.
“Maybe yeah. I don’t know. I came from...well, you know where I came from. Money, riches, fame; I had all of it.”
“I’m not scared of him,” Flash says, then he adds, “Well, a little. But I’m scared of the baby more.”
Peter sniffs and lifts his head, showing off his red rimmed eyes. “Papa, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I-I-I didn’t mean it. I swear.”
Peter was still too young and luckily didn’t remember being under Hydra’s care. The little pup wasn’t showing signs of the serum affecting him either, but Steve and Tony still kept an eye out just in case.
“And I wish you could see that even though you didn’t have a dad growing up, you’re still a great one. It’ll get easier. I promise.”
Steve whines when Tony hits that spot inside him again. He’s so close to his release. He tries to hold back, reminding himself that only the alpha can reach orgasm first. He needs permission.
Natasha must sense his sour mood because she swoops in to rescue him and remind him why they were celebrating in the first place. Steve forces Tony out of his mind to mingle with his friends. He’s surprised that both Thor and Clint had made it to the party. Thor was spending more and more time on Asgard, and Clint was busy taking care of his family.
Steve makes himself comfortable anyway. The small bag Tony packed for him needed to be unpacked. It only takes a few minutes considering he had only had a few items in it. Tony promised they would do a proper shopping trip for both himself and the baby.
Steve nods. It was good. Dr. Strange was supposed to be the best. Tony had promised he’d get the best of the best when it came to his family.
Steve brings his son closer and presses his lips to Harley’s head, allowing his lips to linger over the area. “I love you,” he whispers.
His absence is immediately noticed. Morgan squirms in Tony’s arms, turning her head in search of Steve. She begins to cry.
Steve hesitantly rises to his feet. His hand is grabbed and he’s yanked closer and toward the hall where the bedroom is located. The door is thrown open and he’s led to the large king bed.
The baby appears too small and it’s skin is a pale gray. Blood and other fluids cover it from head to toe, it’s light hair matted down against its head. The baby doesn’t move. It doesn’t cry.
Tony had decided to step down as CEO. His busy schedule was getting in the way of his family life. His family was his main priority now.
Tony smiles and raises his glass to initiate a toast and Steve mirrors him. “Happy Valentine’s Day, sweetheart. Here’s to many more.”
Tony steps in, stretching out his fingers to brush them along Morgan’s cheek. She reacts positively to his touch, calming down instantly and falling back asleep. Tony continues to stroke her face.
“Morning,” Steve greets, placing a kiss to the top of Tony’s head. “Hi, sweetheart,” he smiles at Morgan and gives her a kiss next.
“Good,” Tony turns back to the suit. He gestures for the picture in Peter’s hand and he studies it closely. “So is Spider-Man going to be the next Captain America? Sorry. I heard a little bit of your conversation...never mind.”
If Tony thought Barton was a pain in the ass, then Steve was giving him a run for his money. The super soldier/ WW2 veteran was one of the most difficult people to work with. He didn’t bother keeping his opinions to himself, which in turn led to arguments. Steve was a stubborn jackass, and that was Tony just being nice when it came to describing his fellow teammate.
“You better go,” Steve says, stepping forward to take their son. Tony releases a heavy sigh and passes Peter into Steve’s arms.
“Nah. We got a little distracted but we’re good now. Right, kiddo?” Tony turns back to Peter and tickles him gently, getting a coo in response.
Peter is still sitting on the sofa when Tony returns, and he jumps up, a smile forming over his face at the sight of Morgan.
Peter stops in his tracks and turns around to face her. He almost forgot about the doors his dad had led him through just hours prior. It would probably be better for him to sneak away.
Steve smiles. Peter never denied anything with chocolate. “Yeah, Petey. Chocolate chips. They’re yummy.”
“Yours?” The alpha questions and he shakes his head. Steve has never seen him so disappointed. “She doesn’t belong to you. She belongs to Hydra.”
“I wanted to make you happy. Guess I failed, huh? I’ve been an asshole. Don’t say otherwise. I know I have been.”
Alexander nods, appearing pleased that his event was suiting the billionaire. “It’s all for you, Mr. Stark.”
“When I was kid I would watch you on TV. I always told papa that he didn’t have to go on missions anymore. I said you could take care of the world and let him be with me instead. I didn’t know who you really were then.”
It’s getting late and Tony wants to use the excuse that they go to bed and sleep on it, but it’s clear that Steve is determined to end this here and now. He’s not backing down. Tony wonders where this attitude was before. Maybe then they wouldn’t need to have a difficult discussion.
Peter’s new behavior was odd and only getting worse. For two weeks now Peter was hiding in his room or lying behind his teeth. Steve had tried to get his son to talk, but obviously he was going to need either reinforcements or a new tactic.
Alexander stiffens at those words, clearly unimpressed with the response given. He forces a smile that Tony can instantly see through. “Of course, Mr. Stark.”
“James, come here,” Steve opens his arms, hoping that his pup responds positively and crawls into them like Harley and Sarah had. The pup peers up at him, blue eyes full of fear and concern. He glances at the other alpha in the room, baring his teeth and a small growl rumbling in his chest. “He’s okay,” Steve assures and James looks at him again. “Daddy’s okay.”
His alpha. Steve never imagined he’d ever be so lucky to have an alpha of his own. His mother always said there was one out there for him, but he never believed her words. Now he knows she had been right all along. He did have an alpha waiting for him and it had been worth the wait.
Tony is sitting in the chair beside him, oddly quiet now that they were alone. Just a few minutes ago he had been asking the doctor all sorts of questions. He was determined to know the reason behind the miscarriage, but unfortunately he was left with none.
“Not quite. Follow me,” Tony gestures with his head for Peter to follow and he leads him to another part of the lab until they’re standing in front of a glass display case. “What do you think?”
Tony smirks and turns to Happy. Leaning in for only Happy to hear he says, “I think he’s going to clash with me. I kind of like it. Is that weird?”
When Steve’s birthday rolls around, a heavy sorrow lingers over the team. His special day had never been shadowed with such a deep sadness before. The team never failed to bring happiness and joy to Steve on this day. Every year he had done the same for each of them. The team’s happiness and well-being always came before anything else. Steve put aside his own feelings just so that his family could be content.
Tony doesn’t say out loud that he wishes they had met under better circumstances. But at least they did cross paths. Tony was at least grateful for that.
“Shit,” he curses under his breath, eyes squeezing shut momentarily before shooting open when a familiar voice fills his ears.
Morgan isn’t surprised to find that her papa had already left for his morning run. The coffee pot is on, filling the kitchen with her dad’s favorite aroma. The smell of coffee was his wake up call, and pretty soon he’d be getting out of bed and they could start their day.
At least Tony has Rhodey now. I know both Steve and Tony aren’t perfect and they both made some mistakes, but I love them both anyway.
A soft knock on the door cuts through the silence and they both snap their heads up in its direction. The door opens and a nurse enters, wheeling in a standard hospital bassinet. Steve sits up straight, eyes filling with more tears at the sight of his son. The baby is clean and wrapped in a blanket. A light blue hat has been placed over his head.
“You came!” Peter cries in excitement and rushes to hug his dad. “I was almost afraid you wouldn’t.”
He could have a baby, and he could do it alone. His mother did it and he turned out just fine. He didn’t need Tony for this.
“And I have to do all of this again tomorrow.” She’s referring to speaking to the police. They haven’t left her alone since the story about Tony broke. She told them everything she knew, but it wasn’t enough. Something wasn’t right.
Peter steps away and shoves the photo back into his pocket and watches as Flash gets in the car and drives off. He crosses his fingers and hopes he does see Flash later.
Morgan rests her head on his shoulder, her cries dying down until they’re little hiccups. Steve continues to soothe her until the tears in her eyes have dried up.
“Don’t ruin it or I swear to God-holy fuck!” Tony cries out, his fingers wrapping around the plastic snack bag and squeezing the contents until they’re a blue mush. He groans and tips his head back. “Fuck, that one kinda sucked.”
Peter begins to wake, stirring and whimpering around his pacifier until it’s falling from his lips. His cries escalate until they’re loud wails.
Gunfire rings out through the room, the bullets flying past Steve. His shield comes to his rescue, blocking the bullets, and they ricochet off the heavy vibranium, hitting the first couple of men and sending them to the floor.
Tony smiles softly and brings Steve in for a kiss. The air around them has lost the pungent stench and Steve’s sweetness fills Tony’s nose again. The omega is calmer now, and he buries his face in Tony’s neck, inhaling the scent of his alpha. The soft sound of Steve’s purring makes Tony’s heart flutter.
Now though the holiday was aimed more for children, there was still one person who couldn’t get enough of the spooky day. There was no surprise that Tony Stark was a fan, maybe even the biggest fan there ever was. He found delight in the idea of dressing up as someone else. Maybe that was one of the reasons why he loved being Iron Man so much. Or maybe because he was awesome and loved saving people. Maybe all of those were good reasons.
Steve continues to go ignored. Alpha is ordering the other two to come closer and they force Steve to his feet.
“The world’s not that bad. Well, some things anyway. You just have to go out and see for yourself,” Tony says.
“Don’t fall asleep,” Natasha says and Steve snaps his head up at her. She yawns and holds out her arms, indicating that it was her turn. Steve doesn’t hesitate to pass his son over.
Steve chuckles lightly and pulls Tony close until their bodies are pressed against each other. If the circumstances were different, they’d probably find themselves in another position, but being this close to Steve, and wrapped in his arms was enough.
Just like Tony predicted, he’s getting up from the sofa and making his way toward the bar he knows should’ve been emptied days ago. He decides to change it up, reaching for his best bottle of tequila and filling his glass.
It’s becoming difficult to sit still and wait for updates from the doctor. He’s grateful he has the resources and a team of medical professionals to aid him. If it weren’t for them...Tony can’t even begin to imagine what would’ve happened.
Nick eyes him closely, too closely. Steve grows nervous, fearing that the rest of his secret was being revealed without him even having to open his mouth.
Steve shakes his head again and pulls Tony in for another kiss. “It has to be tonight,” he says, breaking the kiss for a moment, then he kisses Tony again.
“Let him go!” Tony seethes, his tone dripping with venom. He struggles to break free, but the restraints hold true and prevent him from getting to his mate.
Steve lays his head over the bump, smiling at the thought of his son. He flinches when fingers run through his hair and he peers up to find brown eyes staring down at him.
The day Peter is brought home, Tony is giddy with excitement. He couldn’t wait to show Peter the nursery he spent months preparing, and then of course there was meeting Dodger for the first time.
Steve screams this time, the sound painful for the alpha to hear. He’s never seen Steve in this much pain before, and he wishes there was something he could do to alleviate it.
“I guess this doesn’t involve us,” Pepper says and gestures for Happy to follow her out. She shoots Tony a warning look before leaving the lab.
“Uncle Bucky got a cat. Her name is Alpine and she’s so sweet! Uncle Sam says he doesn’t like her but I’ve already caught them taking naps on the couch. I wish you could be here...we miss you.”
It’s the smell of coffee that Steve picks up first, then he hears the sound of footsteps. Correction. Multiple sounds of footsteps. Steve turns toward the doorway just as his two sons rush into the room. Harley pushes his brother out of the way, earning a small growl from James.
Hello! Hope everyone is having a good day! I’m feeling better and my results for Covid came back negative. I have no idea what I had then. Anyway, here is the next chapter and I tried to make it longer. I hope you all enjoy it!
“Next time I won’t miss,” he threatens, then he turns and walks back into the room he just came out of.
Steve jerks his hips, needing Tony to hurry up and do something. The alpha can read his mind and he lowers himself down onto his belly until he’s eye level with Steve’s hole. The omega gasps when Tony places kisses along the inside of his thigh. Tony smirks and brings his mouth closer to where Steve wants, his warm breath ghosting over the sensitive rim.
Doctor Banner smiles warmly, but that’s not enough to calm Peter’s nerves. Peter eyes him closely, taking in as much of him as he could. Bruce seemed nice, his parents knew him from back in the day, but Peter was still hesitant.
“That’s it,” Bruce gives an affirmative nod. He types something onto the keyboard attached to the monitor, freezing the image. “You look to be about 7 weeks along. I just need to get a few images, okay?”
Bucky suffered along with him. Regardless of the serum running through their veins, sleep was still needed, and the lack of it was putting a strain on them. And it was only the first night.
“It’s okay. And yeah it’s not. I don’t know, maybe I can be a decent omega here. Maybe I have a chance of fitting in.”
Steve moans at the praise and the feeling of being full. Tony’s lips are on his again, kissing him sensually. He trails his lips down to Steve’s neck, kissing and sucking the sensitive flesh as he starts rocking into Steve.
“Yeah. I didn’t stay that long at the cemetery,” Peter says and shrugs off his backpack, settling it down in the foyer before entering the living room to collapse on the sofa.
“I promised,” Steve says again. “The day I found out about her I swore to never hurt her. She’s my baby. What kind of father would I be if I...if I hurt her? I did the one thing I was never supposed to do.”
Steve listens to his son’s rambling, watching the way Peter’s face lights up. From the moment Peter could talk, he didn’t hold back, especially when the topic was about something he loved. It was always amusing to watch him speak and the way his face contorted into different expressions. Half the time Steve had no idea what his son was even talking about, but he found himself too engaged to care.
Tony checks on the other pups and then returns to bed. He can’t even be upset about the younger alpha hogging Steve. Their bond was special.
“I should’ve done something!” Peter snaps and shrugs his uncle off. “He’s dead! He’s dead and it’s all my fault! If I would’ve just done something right...he’d...he’d be here. I screwed up.”
Slender arms are wrapping around him and Tony jumps from the contact. He turns around to hug his son properly.
Tony makes his way downstairs, and he’s immediately greeted by the scent of coffee and bacon. But it’s not the familiar aroma of breakfast that makes Tony stop in his tracks. The kitchen is decorated with balloons and streamers and laying on the kitchen island is a neatly wrapped present.
“Except his closet,” Peter says as he fidgets with his hands. “He was always putting a bunch of stuff in there. You know, like Christmas gifts or things like that.”
Steve is tempted to follow Tony’s lead and get some sleep, but he’s kept awake from the growing pain in his belly. The muscles contract tightly every few minutes it seems, each one getting stronger. Their duration has changed, and they’re no longer spread apart like they had been for most of the day. He wants to continue to shrug it off as nothing, but they’re becoming difficult to ignore.
The familiar bark is what interrupts Tony from his work, and he pauses the tinkering on his suit to greet Dodger.
Bucky throws a leg over Sam’s lap and straddles him, cupping his face with his hands and connecting their lips again. Sam moans softly, his hands trailing down Bucky’s back and settling on his hips.
Peter rolls his eyes and turns back toward the window. He wishes he had gone to see his papa instead.
The idea to build a suit of armor came to him during another night of insomnia. It wasn’t just Steve plagued with nightmares. Tony suffered through them more times than he’d like to admit. He’d never get the sight and sounds of his mate being brutally raped and tortured out of his head. He hides the nightmares and lack of sleep, knowing he needed to be strong and provide comfort to his mate and pups when they woke up scared.
A scream followed by giggles fills the apartment. Steve has to pause preparing breakfast at the sound. He was used to his boys roughhousing, and every time he had to take a moment to give them his undivided attention in case their play fight turns serious. He can recall too many late night emergency room visits.
“Depressed? How?” Tony directs his attention to his husband, brows drawing together in confusion. Steve is currently having a conversation with both Sam and Bucky, and Tony was sure there was a hint of a smile on Steve’s face. “He doesn’t seem-”
Bucky squeezes Sam’s hand tightly, fighting back the urge to get up and let his husband handle the rest of the conversation. He can’t help but feel he’s the reason why Peter wants to leave. He pushed his nephew away.
Steve can only nod his head in response. He wants more and as if Tony can read his mind, the rest of the finger slides it, pulling a groan from Steve’s lips. Tony takes his time, not wanting to hurt his boyfriend in any way. He adds more lube and another finger, stretching Steve out and exploring his velvety walls. He’s searching for a particular spot and he knows he’s found it when Steve’s back arches off the bed and he cries out.
Tony regrets those words the second they leave his mouth. He quickly glances at his son, finding the hurt expression on his face. It makes Tony feel like the biggest asshole.
There’s no point dwelling. He needs to be prepared for whatever is waiting for him once the doors open. He feels better now that he has two weapons, but it’s not enough. He was outnumbered regardless. He can only hope Steve is doing better than him.
“He almost tried to claim you,” Alpha says while shaking his head with disapproval. Those same cold fingers purposely linger over Steve’s neck, brushing against the one spot that should never be touched. Alpha grins when the omega flinches. “No one can touch you here. You belong to Hydra. You belong to me.”
“Yep.” Tony nods and takes a bite of the chocolate cupcake, humming in delight. He reaches out to grab another and he places it on the plate. He hears Steve chuckle. “Shut it, I’m pregnant.”
“Anyway. I want to make things right between us. I want to make up for lost time. I know you’re 15 now and I missed a lot but maybe we can still...yeah.”
Oh man I’m not gonna lie but this chapter is kinda sad. This whole story had been difficult but I swear they’re getting a happy ending!
Peter keeps his gaze locked on Tony’s, brows furrowing slightly, almost as if he’s trying to figure out who’s speaking to him. Tony laughs at the expression on his son’s face.
“I made a place for you on the couch so you can rest and take it easy. I have a trash can for you and some crackers.”
“He’s good.” Tony turns toward his son, relieved to find him still asleep. “He’s sleeping right now.”
At the sound of his name, Peter blinks rapidly, snapping out of his trance and turning away from the poster, settling his gaze on his father.
Rumlow scoffs and grips Tony tightly. He leans in close for only Tony to hear. “You’re going to regret that.”
Steve whines softly and hugs Sarah close, not wanting to leave her alone. She was too little. “Tony, please?”
Peter hits the training mat with a small grunt. He props himself up on his elbows, connecting his eyes with his aunt’s. He doesn’t miss the mischievous glint in them or the smug look on her face. She’s barely broken a sweat; her red hair is still neat and her face free of any sheen. He can only imagine himself right now; hair tousled, sweat dripping from his brow and panting heavily on the mat beneath him.
“Enjoying the cupcakes?” Steve’s asks, coming up behind him and wrapping his arms around his waist, interlocking his fingers around Tony’s protruding middle.
Peter waits until his dad is out of earshot before turning back to Flash. “Sorry. I didn’t think he’d come home early. Honestly, I didn’t think you’d even show up.”
“So…” Tony trails off, unsure what the hell he’s supposed to say next. He mentally kicks himself for not knowing how to act. He was better than this.
“You have no idea. I mean I love her to death but...it’s a lot. I think if you’re handing out breaks then give one to Steve first.”
It takes Tony’s brain a second to catch up and realize Sam was talking about the mate he lost. He blames his delayed thinking on the hours he spent watching
Peter comes down a few minutes later, just in time to witness the stare down currently going down. He awkwardly steps between them, moving toward the fridge to get a bottle of water.
Tony adjusts the blanket around his son, making sure he's secure and comfortable. Peter slips free and lays a tiny hand flat on his father’s chest, bringing a smile to Tony's face.
Tony smiles softly and takes Steve’s hand. “I know. You’re doing so good. I guess I just thought with the baby coming soon that we’d be too distracted and for once I don’t want to think about me. It’s always you and the baby on my mind lately.”
Tony had no choice but to give in and let Steve continue to have that control. All his life he had been told that omega’s were nothing and had to do everything an alpha ordered them to do. Tony promised to never be that type of alpha.
Steve eyes the strangers closely, a low growl rumbling deep in his chest. He clings to his pup tightly, baring his teeth when the alpha gets too close. She doesn’t growl back to show dominance over him, and instead completely ignores his warnings and comes closer, bright green eyes roaming over his dirty and bloody form.
Feeding was still another issue that had yet to improve. Steve struggled the most. At least, that’s how he felt. Holding his son was still foreign. The baby was so tiny in his arms, and Steve feared he might end up being too rough. He was made to be indestructible, a military weapon. How could he possibly hold and care for such a fragile thing?
Not many of the members in his group knew about his past life, but the ones that did loved to hear the stories. Many of the younger members only knew about him from the interview he had done years ago and the horrific story he had the guts to reveal. Everyone had their own experiences; some mild and others extreme, but at the end they were all the same. They were all trying to heal and move on.
But now he had a chance to raise one of his children and though it was exciting to finally be a mother, it was also the most terrifying thing in the world. He didn’t have a clue about being a parent. He was thankful he at least had Tony by his side.
Steve rises to his feet and Tony catches him when he sways. “Come on, honey. Let’s get you back to bed and I’ll make you more tea.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Sam waves a dismissive hand and turns back around to properly introduce himself. “You’re not the first one to scent me like that, and you probably won’t be the last. I’m Sam Wilson.”
Tony gives a small nod in response, then he leaves the room. He thought he’d feel better now that he talked with Steve, but their conversation didn’t give the results he had been hoping for. Those missing pieces had yet to be revealed.
“Is that what you’re worried about? That’ll I leave you hanging? Steve, I’m not going to do that. I already said I’m doing this with you. I know this baby was unexpected, but I gotta tell you I already love that kid to death and I’d do anything for him. And for you.”
Steve always considered himself to have a high pain tolerance. He could take the daily beatings from bullies, and fighting off aliens and Hydra was manageable. But giving birth was a whole other story. The miracle of life was beautiful, but it was the most painful experience he’s ever been through. His pain levels were being put to the test.
Steve steps further into the room and lowers himself down in the chair beside Tony’s bed. He reaches out for Tony’s hand and takes it in his own. Tony doesn’t stir when Steve soothingly rubs Tony’s bruised knuckles with his thumb.
He’s forced to stop struggling when an electrifying shock shoots through him. Steve screams and his movements cease. The alpha on his right doesn’t stop and he issues another shock with his stun baton until he’s sure the omega has stopped fighting for good.
The bed is massive, making him feel small. He can’t imagine what Tony must feel like climbing into it every night. Oh right...he doesn’t. Tony made it clear that he doesn’t sleep. Steve wonders if that was just an excuse to get away from him.
“Do you think he’ll have powers?” Clint asks. He means it as a joke, but Steve can’t help but take him literally. It was a thought that has crossed his mind. “It’s not a bad thing, Cap. Maybe this kid will be invisible or something cool like that.”
Just like Peter suspected, Ned is invited to dinner. Ned accepts, and Peter couldn’t be more relieved. His parents wouldn’t question his strange behavior if Ned was around.
