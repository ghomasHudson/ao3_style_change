Tony wiped at his forehead – and grimaced when his hand came away wet with come. Steve made a strangled noise, but before Tony could tease him about it Steve offered him the corner of his discarded pants, his face decidedly more red than before. “Here.”
Or – and this was a scary thought – Tony really was sick. What if his thoughts actually were... unnatural? Would this so-called treatment change who he was? The way he acted?
“In our pants? Really?”
“Okay,” Tony repeated quietly, and Steve shivered as Tony ran his hands down his back. “Nice and slow. I'm wet enough for you.”
Tony stopped short, turning on his heel to stare at her. “You know what?”
“You know, when I saw your username I didn't expect you to be this cute.”
“Holy shit,” Steve panted, and Tony laughed, bright and loud, before he pressed a kiss to Steve's nose.
Steve let out an uneven breath, his hands clasped so tightly that Tony could see his knuckles stand out white. “I didn't know you two were close.”
Avengers Compound, 102 E. Kent Street
“I'm ready, I'm ready, please –“
Steve made a muffled choking noise as Ignacio tilted his head. “And yet you have not claimed him as yours? Why is that?”
“Oh, boo,” Clint shouted, pelting him with popcorn. “Don’t waste our gift, asshole.”
Bucky's lips twitched into the shadow of a smile. "And here I thought I was your friend too."
over the years. Responses from other members of the parliament range from surprise to condemnation, with many already predicting the termination of Ross' office. Public outrage was massive, with #FreeTheHeroes and #RotInRaftRoss trending only minutes after the pictures were leaked. Thus far Secretary Ross has refused to issue a statement and continues to give no comment on the authenticity of these photos. We are told that the United Nations General Assembly is planning to hold a meeting to discuss this recent discovery, and can only hope that Secretary Ross will be held accountable for authorizing the construction of this hellhole.
“I can't accept that, Tony.”
“We don't know for sure if the timeframe is accurate. The serum –“
“Tony, we can't – You have no idea what it's going to do! What if it hurts you?”
“I want us to fuck a pie together.” Steve's face resembled a red stop light by now, but Tony still needed a moment to catch up to what was going on. Steve wanted to –
Tony's eyes flashed with gleeful delight before he walked closer, casually, but Steve could see the almost predatory glint in his smile as he stepped right into Steve's space, still keeping enough of a distance that they weren't touching. They might as well have been for how much it made Steve's skin prickle to be this close to another naked man.
Toni smiled, closing her eyes to just bask in the moment for a second before she put a hand on his thigh and looked up at him, their faces only inches apart.
Tony frowned. “When you smelled –“ He broke off, thinking back to Steve's reaction the previous night. “That's why you knotted me again? You smelled that I wasn't pregnant?”
"Why would you –"
“Do you want me to –“
We are getting into Black Panther territory, everyone buckle in ;) I hope you enjoy this!
“Yeah, Clint. What days? Since you felt the need to bring it up.”
T. Stark
“Now, now,” Tony said, his voice lowered into a purr, and Steve felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up. “We both know you don't
Tony felt warm with fondness and something else that he only realized was relief when Steve was already kissing him again. He'd never planned on Steve finding out about this, but knowing that Steve not only didn't care, but
NATIONAL CAPITAL JUDICIAL REDION
“No, it –“ Tony's mouth dropped open, his eyes wide as he stared unseeingly at the table underneath him, his hips jerking against the sphere on reflex. It was moving quickly, in a repetitive motion, and Tony had never felt anything like it. He'd never been this aware of his penis before, which was a weird thought because of course he hadn't, an omega's penis didn't exist for any purpose other than making water.
“That's good, Tony,” Steve said, voice hitching on a moan, and the praise washed over Tony like a warm balm, fanning the heat in his gut –
When she was finally done she released her grip, stroking her hand soothingly through his hair as she looked down at him, her stomach twisting with primal satisfaction at the dazed look in his eyes, the fluids smeared all over his chin and down his neck.
WARNING: There are dicks in this chapter!! Don't read in public unless you're some kind of ninja xD
“Yes. I'm a man,” Tony said slowly, and Steve's face twisted.
In light of recent events the UN has decided to deploy the Avengers to retrieve the accused James Buchanan Barnes along with the missing persons Steven Grant Rogers, Samuel Thomas Wilson, Wanda Maximoff and Clinton Francis Barton within the next 72 hours.
“That's good, sweetheart,” Steve said, the low undertone in his voice sending a shiver down Tony's spine. “Keep counting.”
He swallowed and felt a shiver run down his spine when Steve groaned in response, a quiet, broken sound that seemed to reverberate in Tony's chest. Tony looked up to meet his eyes, his heart pounding at the desperation he found there. He pulled back, moving his tongue all over the underside of Steve's cock before he let it pop out of his mouth and took several deep breaths.
“I think that's everything,” Steve said tiredly, giving everyone around him a small smile. “Debrief adjourned. You can go now.”
“We're taking the subway.”
“What if I want
Steve wrinkled his nose. “Lovely visual there.”
I believe he is the best man for the job.
it. Tony groaned.
"Yes."
“I do not doubt that.” T'Challa sounded like he very much did. “But isn't it preferential to treat someone as being above the law? Mr Barnes deserves to be prosecuted for his crimes like every other man.”
“Stop avoiding the question.”
No, nothing happened,” Tony said quickly, sitting up to give Rhodey a serious look. “I told you, nobody touched me.”
He sounded like he already knew the answer, but Tony – just to be contrary – crossed his arms and said, “I'd like to have my alpha in here, please.”
Steve pushed down his pants just enough to free his cock, spitting into his palm before he grabbed himself with more purpose now, a nice up and down stroke that made his thumb catch on the dip right below his glans. His eyes were closed as he thought of the last time he'd gotten a blowjob, letting his imagination fill in the gaps in his memory, the sight of brown eyes and a trimmed beard around his –
“It wasn't hard to guess.” Tony sat up a little straighter, inclining his head. “For what it's worth, I am incredibly sorry for your loss.”
From this close Tony picked up the doctor's scent again, something earthy and unobtrusive that made his mouth water. He quickly stepped away, hoping that the sudden heat in his cheeks wasn't visible, and the doctor gave him one last glance – Tony really hoped he wasn't imagining that his eyes darted down his body before he looked away – and opened the door.
“Yeah. Can you... a little harder?”
“I got you,” Steve murmured right before he took Tony’s dick in his mouth and Tony stopped thinking altogether.
“Say it, Tony,” Steve said firmly, spanking him again before Tony could draw another breath. “Say you're none of the things he said you were.”
“Fuck, okay. Wait.” Tony pushed at his shoulder, and Steve froze for a second before he sat back on his haunches, a little confused. He almost swallowed his tongue when Tony turned over onto his stomach, pushing up to his knees until his ass was right in front of Steve, his hole still so damn open, completely on display –
“I'm counting on it.”
“Like... the animal?” he asked in a tone that said he knew that wasn't it, and Clint's smirk widened.
“And it's been what, three and a half since he took out the implant?” Tony asked with a raised eyebrow that Steve apparently ignored. “Tell me the last time you slept for eleven hours. I'll wait.”
He'd figure out where to get rid of it tomorrow.
it. The tube was long enough that it was just barely sticking out of Tony’s hole, and watching it expand as Steve’s finger pushed in was like a punch to Steve’s gut, his heart suddenly pounding. Fuck, that was hot.
Tony froze for a second before he relaxed, running his hands down Steve's back until he was gripping his waist and holding on tight.
Steve's eyes went wide. “What – Tony, do they –“
“Trust me,” Tony said in a low voice as another set of vines came up to brush the hair back from his face. His eyes flicked down to Steve's crotch, and he smirked. “Who knows, this might end up being fun for both of us."
Tony huffed. “I was right on the edge and that dick startled me.
for his cock –
When he wrapped it around his cock in the bedroom later, getting crumbs all over the sheets as he fucked his fist, he thought about what Steve's face would look like if he could see him like this.
"Anyway. Next up, defense. I have my best lawyers lined up to make a case for you and Natasha is already combing through ex-SHIELD files to find whatever she can." He pushed the mirror into Bucky's hands, grabbing the scissors to clean them in the sink. "Trial's in a couple days. I'll get your therapists' reports regarding your progress with B.A.R.F and another one from Bruce and Cho –"
Of course, please do.
– turned to look at him.
Steve could only nod in response, shifting his stance wider to give Tony more room as Tony fingered him open. He hadn't done this since before the war, but his body still remembered how to relax around the intrusion, to push back on it so he could make it easier. The dulled sensation of it weirdly helped, and Tony had barely pushed in a third finger when he shook his head, reaching back to bat Tony's hand away.
U.S. Department of State
Toni punched him in the shoulder on her way over, and Clint staggered, but caught himself without dropping the bottle. Show-off. “Hey! Foul play!”
They both froze when a door banged open and someone's footsteps echoed through the restroom.
“But that was a battle rut, Tony, this is –“
Steve was pretty sure his mouth was hanging open as he stared at Tony in astonishment, but Tony just grinned, waving a hand at their surroundings. If JARVIS was playing any sound then it was too quiet for even Steve to pick up on it.
“We don't have to go all the way tonight,” she said quietly, and his breathing hitched. “We can stop any time if you're uncomfortable. But I think we're both ready for a little more than just kissing. What do you say?”
, his skin tingling with what might be the electric current, but might also just be his body going into overdrive –
“Alright. Here,” he said, then hesitated with his hand halfway outstretched towards Steve. He pulled a pen from his other pocket and scribbled a string of digits – presumably his personal number – on the card before reaching forward and tucking it in Steve’s shirt pocket, patting his chest with a wink. “There you go. Hit me up whenever you want. I know a great Greek restaurant.”
“Shh.” Tony leaned down to press a kiss to Steve's mouth, smiling when Steve immediately pulled him into his lap to deepen it. Steve seemed hesitant to take control, so Tony licked into his mouth, exploring him for a couple of seconds before he pulled back, resting his forehead against Steve's. “It'll all be fine. You'll see.”
“Tony –“ he choked out before he could stop himself, and Tony moaned, digging his tongue right into that spot until Steve was shivering uncontrollably, pounding into Tony as he felt his stomach pull tight, his balls drawing up –
He could feel Steve's hands clench where they were holding him up by the hips and Tony followed the silent command by wrapping his legs around Steve's waist, humming when Steve's hands wandered down to his ass and squeezed.
like.”
“Bite me,” Steve said, grunting when Tony twitched at his words, desire burning up in him like a stick flame. “Bite me again, Tony, please –“
Understatement of the year. Steve sucked in a breath that did nothing to calm his racing heartbeat, still staring at where Tony was stretched open, just for him. “If you could see yourself –“
“Nothing to be ashamed of, of course. Hell, if I had that kind of money I'd have a woman on each limb. Plus two for prosperity.”
, that he – okay. Yeah, okay. “I wasn't planning on doing that today, no. Maybe later.”
Tony narrowed his eyes for a split second before he forced a bland smile. “And what kind of man am I, my prince?”
“Yeah, well,” Tony said evasively, and Steve hummed, pressing a kiss to his cheek.
Steve's eyes were dark when she pushed her hands underneath the lapels of his jacket, sliding it down his arms until he was just in his shirt and tie which she got her hands on next, loosening it with a well-practiced tug before she slid it up over his head.
Hey guys! Sorry for being gone for a while there, but this week has been kicking my ass. Thankfully the weekend's coming up, so I'll have some time to relax and hopefully write. I hope this chapter makes up for the wait ;) Also:
“Look at me.” Steve blinked his eyes open, his head turning sluggishly, and Tony gave him a warm smile. “I want you to fuck me, Steve.” Steve's whole body jerked as he choked out a desperate whine, shaking his head again. “I can take it. Come on, Steve –“
Tony snorted. “Thanks, pantless wonder, but you still need to wear those on the way home.” He stretched his arms up over his head before he sluggishly pushed himself to his feet, gripping Steve's shoulder for support. “Come on. We can wash up in the bathroom.”
Steve buried his nose in Tony's wet fingers with a guttural groan, hips jerking forward in an uncontrolled thrust. Tony barely had time to blink before Steve was lifting him with both hands, positioning him over his cock.
“I want you to count them,” Steve said, and Tony took a deep breath before he nodded, bracing himself for the first hit. He still flinched when the flat of Steve's palm cracked against his ass, a sharp pain that only stung for a second before warmth bloomed across his skin, leaving behind an aching tenderness.
Tony swallowed hard. “Right.”
Tony leaned up to press a kiss just under Steve's jaw before he settled down on the pillow, feeling Steve's heart beat under their joined hands, just as fast and uneven as Tony's.
“No idea. Probably not eggs. More like seeds.” Tony grabbed for Steve's arms, patting them weakly. “Help me up?”
Steve choked on the rest of his sentence, looking at Tony in disbelief. “What?”
ATTY. NOEL ALEXIS D. RIMANDO
A quiet noise from Steve made him look up and cross his arms, trying to look as dignified as possible while staying halfway buried underneath a mountain of pillows. “What?”
want me to?” Tony asked carefully, and Steve breathed out heavily.
Tony moaned, something deep inside him lighting up with pleasure when Steve pressed two fingers inside him, the same way he did the night before except –
“He wasn't bonded though. And it's only been three years for me,” Steve said evasively, and Tony gritted his teeth.
“The meeting room is just down the stairs. They are waiting for you.”
PARTICIPANTS:      Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross
“Yeah, those,” Tony said, though it came out slightly choked when the plant bounced him up and down. Steve took a deep breath.
“Now cuddle me. I'm cold.”

“Do you have a name? Or should I keep calling you hot blond guy in my head?”
“I'm Tony Stark. I have two of
“Say it.”
“Mr. Stark?”
Dr. Yinsen's smile widened, and Tony had the distinct feeling of being played like a fiddle as the doctor stood up to call Obie back inside. Obie gave Tony a sour look when he walked in, putting a hand on Tony's shoulder as soon as he was next to him, looming with a slightly distrustful look at Dr. Yinsen.
Tony laughed breathlessly. “Yeah. Yeah, okay.”
"Sorry." Steve pulled away a little, but Tony shook his head, trying to keep him right there because that was - fuck, that was -
Tony had done this a hundred times. He had no reason to be nervous.
“You sure?” Tony asked even though he could already feel his fangs protruding from their sheaths, and Steve groaned.
.” He barely felt Tony's hand on his arm and the knowledge of how abnormal that was made the tears finally flow over. Tony's grip tightened immediately, and Steve took a shaky breath at the faint pressure. “Hey, it's okay. Look at me.”
Steve faltered at the stunned disbelief that looked a little too much like pain on Tony's face, but quickly caught himself. He'd get this out if it killed him.
Steve shuffled forward, reaching up to run a single finger down her folds with a lot less hesitation that she'd almost expected. Toni made an encouraging noise, shifting her hips forward to give him better access, and Steve did it again, his touch so feather-light that it was more of a tease than anything else.
Steve wasn't stupid. He knew that Tony would expect something to happen. But so far Tony had always let Steve set the pace and never pressured him into anything. Honestly Tony was the most patient man he had ever known.
“No, this is fine,” Tony said, and Steve hummed.
This was going to be a disaster.
Dr. Yinsen leaned forward in his seat, giving him a serious look. “Yes. But I'd like to hear about it from you.”
. It would almost be comical if the rest of his body didn't match it in that sense, bigger and broader than Tony on pretty much all sides. Tony's hand barely closed around it whenever he jerked him off, and his jaw ached for hours after giving him head. Tony absolutely
She came with a shout, gasping through tiny moans as she rode it out against Steve's mouth, fucking herself on his tongue and his fingers. Steve groaned, grinding his face into her, or maybe she was still dragging him by the hair, his free hand coming up to grip her thigh almost desperately, pulling her close like he was trying to keep her there.
“Yes, Obie,” Tony said with a false air of obedience that he could tell didn't fool Obie for even a second. But with the doctor in the room Obie couldn't do much more than scowl at him before he left the office and closed the door with a little more force than necessary.
Steve was probably going to knot his hands, but Tony was counting on that, sliding his hand up from Steve's balls to wrap it around the base of his cock instead –
Obie seemed to misinterpret his relief as something else because he chuckled, patting Tony's arm. “That's my boy. Don't worry, we'll find you a nice alpha. You'll see.”

nice.”
Steve sighed, pulling his finger out and wiping it on the towel. It was pointless. The doll was a nice substitute for some things, but it couldn't replace actual human connection, least of all being intimate with someone. For a second Steve felt almost desperately lonely.
“Is that what we're calling it these days?”
Steve felt the back of his neck heat up as he shifted in his seat. “It – uh. It's very well made.”
Steve grimaced. “You don’t know that.”
Steve froze, so caught of guard by the sound that he completely let go, and Tony opened his eyes, looking at him with a mixture of surprise and concern.
“Not much.” Tony took his glass over to the living room, waving a hand at JARVIS to pull up Netflix. “I'll probably go to bed in a bit.”
Subject: I've Decided
Steve swallowed around the lump in his throat, tearing his eyes away from Tony's exposed skin. “JARVIS, what do you have on the plant? Is it flammable? Can we cut it? Anything?”
“At least it wasn't CuntNCockDestroyer,” Pepper said, and Tony laughed, burying his face in her hair.
“So Tony loves Clint loves Sam loves Bucky loves Wanda loves –“ He raised an eyebrow at her, and Wanda went bright red, twirling her hair around a finger as she glanced at Natasha.
“Um. Excuse me?” Steve and Fury both turned to see Bruce at the door, his hand half-raised to knock and a sheepish smile on his face. “Sorry to interrupt, but we've had an emergency.”
Tony blinked at the non-sequitur, glancing down at Steve who was studiously looking at the wall.
With that he grabbed Steve's dick and licked a broad stripe all the way to the tip, making an extra swirl around the head that was already salty with pre-come as his mouth watered at the taste.

Tony grunted when his cock slid up in a way that pressed its head firmly against the sphere, massaging a spot that felt white hot even through the fabric of the gown, and Tony tried to hold still, to keep up the angle, but his hips hitched forward anyway and –
It took two days for Tony to even notice the difference.
“I have an idea,” Tony said abruptly, inhaling and exhaling very slowly before he tapped one of the leaves. “Okay, hentai plant. I know there's no way that you'll let me go just like that, so how about I just let you do whatever you want to me?”
“Now that's just perfect,” Steve huffed angrily, crossing his arms. “I've told you a
Everything Toni had feared would happen,
Tony lowered his head, blinking his eyes open so he could see his – oh, fuck.
Bucky slowly reached up to touch his face, turning it this way and that to look at himself from all angles. Tony pretended not to notice when his eyes got a little misty, turning away to give him a moment.
He wouldn't have it any other way.
“You want to get up right now?” Steve asked as he shifted so their legs were tangled together, pressing his cock fully against Tony's – and, fuck, Steve had a point. This wasn't going to take long anyway.
He'd told her those exact words more than once since they'd started dating, but it still felt like the first time every time. Toni basked in the compliment, stepping closer to slide a leg between his and grinning when she felt his hard cock against her hip.
“I'm leaking! Holy fuck, Steve, look at this! Come on, wake up!” Tony nudged Steve's shoulder until Steve followed his silent command and sat up, his disgruntled frown melting into genuine amazement when he looked at Tony's swollen nipples that were still sluggishly dripping onto his chest.
“Dignity? Never met her.”
“Remember the alien seeds from last Thursday?”
Thank you for your weekly report. The UN is overjoyed to hear that the Avengers are looking to expand not only their resources but also the active team roster. We have forwarded the required documents to Mr. Lang as well as the Avengers legal team. Please don't hesitate to contact us for additional information.
Steve chuckled, leaning back into Tony's hold. “Not something I want to do again, I don't think. But I'm glad we tried it anyway.”
“This,” Steve said, and the way that his fingers slid easily through Tony's crack made Tony realize just how wet he was. “Please?”
“Steve,” he said quickly, feeling his face heat when he realized that he'd completely forgotten to introduce himself earlier. “My name is Steve.”
The first time the thought came to him Tony was jerking off in the shower.
“Because –“ Toni swallowed hard, looking off to the side. “Look, I'm filthy rich, right? That's enough of a power dynamic as it is, no matter who I go out with. If you add an age difference into the mix –“
“It's only us and Pep. And she knows not to come out of her office before I say we're decent.”
Steve said and Tony gave up all pretenses, mashing their lips together with no intent of stopping anytime soon. He had no idea how Steve got them inside but he must’ve managed it somehow because before he knew it Steve was setting him down on a hard surface, fingers tangling in his shirt as he –
Steve shrugged, his lips tilting into a tentative smile. "Didn't have much time to sha–"
The sound was getting louder now, and Tony squirmed at the sudden feeling of a tongue on his neck, tracing circles into his bonding gland that felt white hot somehow, shocking enough that the sensation pulled Tony's brain into consciousness.
“Can I –“ Steve didn't finish asking the question before he leaned down and buried his tongue in Tony's ass, so deep that Tony's knees went weak. He could already feel the familiar clenching in his loins that meant he was producing slick and as he got a good whiff of the pillow Steve had been laying on it wasn't hard to tell why.
Tony knew that at one and a half inches his penis was a little bigger than other omegas' but he'd never thought that it could feel like
“Tony,” he croaked, and Tony shushed him, sinking down until the head of Steve's cock was pressed against his hole –
He couldn't hold back a groan at the familiar weight of a dick on his tongue, sliding all the way to the back of his mouth and filling him up just right. If Tony had his way he'd be doing this 24/7, just keep his mouth stuffed with a dildo until his jaw was aching, but alas, real life demanded him to speak from time to time.
, like Steve was giving him something too, and Steve squirmed restlessly, already desperate to feel the drag of Tony's cock against his walls again. Tony gave him exactly what he needed, lifting Steve up and pushing back inside until Steve felt like he would
“I – no. Sorry.”
“So what's the plan?” Natasha asked, looking between Bucky and him. Steve sighed heavily.
this, missed Steve like a lost limb.
Bucky was silent as Tony wet his hair, brushing it with sure strokes before he separated the first strand, squeezing it between his fingers to pull it straight. The snipping sound of the scissors seemed almost unbearably loud in the room.
Steve was pulling at his hair, an almost frantic groan tearing from his throat, and Tony moved back just in time to let Steve come all over his face, his cock tapping against Tony's cheek and chin with every pulse. Tony stroked him through it, his own cock throbbing in sympathy as he milked Steve completely dry until he was pushing Tony's hand away, shivering all over.
the problem.”
“I missed this. You’re always so responsive.”
Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
They both looked up at Steve who was leaning in the doorway, his arms crossed over his chest in a way that made his shirt pull taut across his shoulders. Tony had long since stopped believing that it wasn't deliberate.
Tony's frown deepened as he tried to – oh. Wait, no, that couldn't be – “Did you think I didn't want your opinion on this?” he asked incredulously and Steve's eyes dimmed for a split second before he looked away.
Tony swallowed hard. “I'm okay, really. I –“

“Okay, what the fuck is so important that you needed a whole team to take care of it?”
From: t.stark@starkindustries.com
Steve jumped again when a hand landed on his arm, reflexively reaching up to grab it. He boggled at the sensation of warm flesh under his fingers, following it all the way up an invisible arm to a familiar grinning face. “Tony?”
He only hoped that the plant would keep its promise in the end. Which was a sentence he never thought he would think.
“Throw you down on top of the nearest available surface and have my way with you?” Tony asked calmly, and Steve swallowed.
“I'm bored. Just get off and get it over with.”
,” Steve groaned, and Tony cursed, one arm wrapping around Steve's waist before there was a blunt pressure at his hole and Tony slipped inside, drawing a moan from both of them.
“I know what it feels like to lose control,” Bucky said and Tony was about to cut him off when Bucky suddenly grabbed his arm under the table, an unspoken warning. “I've felt it time and time again. When you've spent seventy years under somebody else's control you learn to recognize the signs of your mind slipping.”
“Does it matter? I'm stuck!” Tony tried to twist out of the plant's hold, turning pleading eyes on Steve when it didn't work. “Get me out of here, please?”
“Right. Yeah, that makes sense.” Tony plopped down on the couch, fiddling restlessly with his hands as Steve opened the boxes and handed one to him. He had no idea why he was so jittery, almost as if he was nervous.
“Steve?” Tony asked sleepily, and Steve's breathing hitched as he nuzzled Tony's shoulder again. “Hey, what –“
“You miss it?” Rhodey asked, raising an eyebrow. “I thought you hated leaking. You chewed my ear off about it all the time in college.”
. You think you’re compatible in the physical sense. And judging by what you told me Steve seems to return the sentiment.”
“I love you,” Steve said right in his ear, and Tony was pretty sure he was going to start purring when Steve's fingers found that spot at the base of his neck and dug in, massaging any of the lingering tension away.
“And what did you do?”
“Who cares, he’s here now, let’s get this rolling!” Clint squeezed through the gap between them, dragging them along by the arms to where Steve could already see a mountain of snacks on the couch table. “Jason Bourne, here we come.”
“What? I had to keep busy while you were away, didn’t I?”
T'Challa's eyes were so cold his gaze sent a shiver down Tony's spine. “I see. I assume you could not have foreseen what happened in Vienna, otherwise you would not be so ready to defend him.”
Tony clamped his mouth shut, but it was too late. Steve stiffened in his arms.
“You seriously don't know? I thought you and Steve spend ruts together.”
“I would never forgive myself. It's too dangerous and I love you too much to put you through that.”
“James Rhodes acquired that suit by means of –“
“Are you sure? There are other things we can do.”
“No, not –“ Tony huffed in frustration. “Don't just repeat it, say it... different.”
“Interesting. So he really was your intended.”
“Hm?”

“Thanks for saying that, Groggy, I'm glad you're enjoying the stream,” he said, smirking when he read the next one. “My ass
“Go for it,” he gasped, and Steve tugged his panties to the side, wrapping his hand around Tony's cock and stroking it once –
Steve's showers were very cold these days.
“Wait,” he choked out, and Tony pulled back immediately, looking at him with concerned eyes. “What's wrong?”
Thank you again for your visit. I hope that you enjoyed our hospitality as much as we enjoyed your company.
“Toni?”
“You're still sure about this, right?” Tony asked, and Steve nodded, touching the filling with one pointed finger and swallowing hard.
Tony blinked. “Come again?”
“Yep. No complaints here.” Steve pinched him in the side and Tony couldn't have wiped the grin off his face if he tried. “We still got it.”
Steve's hands clenched in the fabric of his trousers before he let them drop to the ground, straightening up from his slight crouch. Was he really going to do this? Apparently yes, if the way he couldn't stop staring at Tony's body was any indication. He could just imagine holding on to those shoulders as Tony bent him backwards over the rock next to him and –
Tony really wanted to make a joke about what other parts of The_Captain might be up for it, but he refrained. This guy seemed like a bit of a nervous nilly, and Tony wasn't about to make that worse.
, stuffing Tony's mouth, and he only had a second to see the wide-eyed surprise in Tony's eyes before they rolled shut and he let out a deep-chested groan that was abruptly cut off by what Steve could only assume was the plant pushing into his throat. He was fucking his fist by now, pressure building just behind his balls, flooding his entire body with heat as he tried to hold off, make this last a little longer –
, his mind supplied. He groaned as Steve worried his nipple with tiny motions that stung in that specific way that didn't quite translate to pain inside Tony's body. Instead it made his blood sing, his cock throbbing with every minuscule movement from Steve. It felt as if he was the string on a bow, pulled back until it was about to snap, and Steve was plucking at the edges, sending vibrations all the way to the center where they coalesced in a tiny knot of heat that sent waves of pure sensation to the rest of his body.
“Shit.” Tony looked down at Steve whose face was a study in desperation, his hands digging grooves into Tony’s hips where he seemed to be holding on for dear life. “
Steve's doubt must've shown on his face because Tony sighed and tapped a finger right under his eye.
Steve took a deep, calming breath before he gave Bruce a tense smile.
Tony closed his eyes, sinking into Steve’s embrace as his thoughts kept running in circles, reprimanding him for losing his shit, for letting any of this get to him in the first place when he knew better than to listen to some asshole’s opinion of him. But he couldn’t deny that it had struck a nerve, sent him back to a time he didn’t want to remember, a version of
Steve blinked, processing that for a moment before he groaned. "Oh my god, Tony."
“Okay,” Steve said quietly, and Tony pulled him into a real kiss, already tasting hints of rut pheromones on his tongue. His toes curled in anticipation, but Steve pulled away before things could get too heated.
Dear Mr Stark,
Steve’s touch was feather-light as he trailed his fingers down the side of Tony’s face and Tony caught his hand to hold it between their chests as he moved closer.
Tony clung to Steve like a limpet, burying his head in Steve’s neck as his anger fizzled out into an overwhelming shame. He’d acted like a complete asshole tonight, and nothing would ever justify taking his frustration out on Steve who was nothing but kind to him and always made things better.
“I just don't want to hurt you,” Steve said quietly, and Tony sighed, pressing a kiss to Steve's neck.
Toni was on her feet in an instant, grabbing Pepper by the arm to drag her out of the room. “Onwards! To the coffee!”
A particularly good slide of Steve's tongue across his made him moan, and Steve echoed the sound, gripping Tony around the waist as he leaned back against the couch, pulling Tony down with him. Tony took that as his cue to switch it up, cupping Steve's face in both hands as he pushed back, coaxing Steve's mouth further and further open with every swipe of his tongue. It was a bit of a power rush when Steve just
“Your body knows what to do.” Even Steve's voice sounded unaffected, but Tony's brain could not compute the possibility that Steve was this calm when Tony was a complete
He could see Steve's back flexing, thighs and ass clenching as Steve started thrusting against the bed, getting himself off on the mattress, and Tony wished he could see it, watch Steve's cock, hard and flushed, slide against the sheets as he -
“Yeah. That sounds about right.”
to do it,” Steve said, giving him an apologetic look. “But – now that some of us have signed it's –“
Steve couldn't help it. It bubbled up inside him like a tidal wave until he broke down laughing, holding a hand in front of his mouth until he realized it was pointless and he just flung his head back and laughed and laughed until his stomach hurt.
“Whu?” Tony blinked his eyes open, a little disoriented as he tried to find the source of whatever woke him up –
“Very well, miss.”
“I'm all yours,” she said, her voice coming out in a rasp, and Steve shuddered so hard that she could see it, his pupils blown so wide they looked almost black as he looked back down at where she was already throbbing for his touch.
The letter arrived on a Sunday.
Tony snorted. “Red light, yellow light. I remember the lecture.” Steve felt an arm wrap around his waist. “Lucky for me, this is my boyfriend we're talking about here. We do way worse on a daily basis.”
Tony forced a noise of assent out through his tight throat, his hands scrabbling on the table as his hips moved against the massager of their own accord, rubbing up against the vibrating metal. It felt like his cock was on
Steve sucked in a breath before his face crumpled and his eyes filled with tears.
Steve frowned. “Tony, what –“
Tony snorted. “Should be a short list.”
Tony gasped, his entire body jerking, and Steve realized all at once that the vines were
“Tell me to stop,” Steve begged in a low voice that sent shivers down Tony's spine. “If you don't – Tony –“
Steve's cheeks went a little red, but Toni blamed that on the alcohol. “Yeah. It's a great party, Toni. Thanks for inviting us.”
Steve rutted up against the fake tissue, biting down on a groan at the friction. His cock was still wet enough with spit that the glide felt smooth, and moving closer pushed his cock up until it was squished firmly between his stomach and the doll’s hip, rubbing up and down in the tight space. He was breathing heavily, his hands trembling when he wrapped his arms around the doll and pushed himself up until he had enough leverage to really hump its hip, the hot slide of it making his toes curl.
for a second that he could barely breathe. Fuck, he
“Just one? You mentioned at least four on the way here.”
“You're so beautiful,” Steve said, and Tony jolted, his eyes rolling back into his head when Steve pinched his other nipple next, another gush of milk spilling out over his fingers. It was a lot less than Tony was used to, but it was enough. It was
“I'm not gonna last long,” Tony gritted out and Steve laughed breathlessly.
Well, shit. Now Tony
Tony looked up at Steve who was leaning on the counter, giving him an innocent smile – and snorted.
“You sure?” he asked, his voice coming out a little strangled, and Steve pulled him into a firm kiss instead of an answer, holding the tray steady as he urged Tony into a rhythm with the hand still grabbing his ass. Alright then.
Steve let out a small moan when Tony rubbed out a particularly stubborn knot, mouthing at Tony's skin in a way that sent a shiver down his spine, and all of a sudden Tony had the perfect idea of how to make this even better.
“Yeah. Whatever makes you happy.”

“Holy shit, really?” At least he sounded genuinely surprised. “I thought they’d send you a questionnaire or something.”
“What do you say we take a look at it together?” he asked, stepping up to the camera before he started unfolding the piece of paper, his brain chanting
He hummed as he worked, cupping water with his hands to clean off his soapy arms and legs before he moved back towards the waterfall to rinse out his hair –
Tony pushed him up just far enough that he could struggle out of his jacket, taking his shirt right along with it. Steve tugged off his own clothes with military efficiency, and before long they were both naked, staring at each other with obvious admiration.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Black?”
“No, it's – Tony!” Her mouth clacked shut when he grabbed her arm, keeping her from backing away even further. Which – when did that happen? “It's not just about sex. I – I really like you.” Toni's eyes widened when Steve's cheeks flushed – honest to god
calm down!” Steve shouted. “You go! Tell them you – just tell them whatever, but I’m not setting a goddamn foot in that place!”
“Oh,” she gasped, rocking up against his mouth while holding him still with the firm grip on his hair, grinding her pussy into his face as his tongue kept sliding wetly across her skin, curling and slipping in all the right places –
"Move or I will move you."
Steve's eyes snapped up to his. “What?”
“Or we could get some grub first,” Tony said nonchalantly, nodding his head at the front door. “There's pizza across the street or a diner a couple blocks down.”
“Did you... want to? Have sex with me?”
A part of him wanted to throw it out without even opening it, but in the end curiosity won out and he grabbed a pair of scissors, cutting away the wrapping paper before he laid into the tape holding it closed. He pulled the carton apart, scooped out the layer of protective foam and –
“Yeah,” he said again, and she could feel his fingers trembling as he slid the zipper down until it rested against her lower back. She waited for him to make the next move, which he did after a moment of hesitation, sliding the dress off her shoulders and revealing the red lace bra she'd chosen for tonight. Steve looked at it intently, his eyes filled with hunger as he drank her in, reaching up until his hands were just barely grazing the underside of her breasts. Toni let him explore for a bit before she reached back and unclasped her bra, letting it fall to the floor with only a hint of trepidation.
Steve’s mouth snapped audibly shut. “But I –“
He’d deal with it later.
Steve choked on the rest of his sentence when Tony bit down, sinking his teeth into the spot just below Steve's ear. He could feel Steve's veins pulsing against his mouth, and he thrust his hips in time with that rhythm, feeling his eyes roll into the back of his head at the friction combined with Steve's
“Yes, of course. My apologies.”
“I’m also not thirsty.”
The elevator dinged as they arrived on the ground floor, and Steve stumbled out on shaky legs, taking a deep breath to compose himself before he briskly walked through the lobby, his hand still grasping Tony's.
Tony's breathing hitched, his hands clenching on Steve's shoulders. “You –“
“We didn’t read the whole terms and conditions, okay? Calm down!”
“The spell breaks when you say hurtful shit! Break their heart or whatever.” Tony frantically flapped his hand at Wanda. “Come on, try it!”
“But not – it's not the same. Please?”
He was babbling something, a litany of “please, oh god, please”, and Tony's breath was hot on his neck, on his chest, everywhere Tony could reach to press searing kisses into his flesh that seemed to leave burning hot marks all over his skin. Steve couldn't remember the last time he'd wanted to come so desperately, but something was holding him back, keeping him right on the edge until every thrust felt like it was forcing a tiny orgasm out of him, yet without providing any of the relief that came with it.
It was at that moment that Toni knew she was fucked.
Steve snorted. “I'm not sure I can even move right no–“ He gasped when Tony patted his softening dick, his thighs twitching spastically. “Fuck. If you keep doing that I'll –“
Steve snorted. “Can't I just want to visit you?”
He glanced around the car, but aside from them there were only three other people in it. Two of them sat with their backs to him, and the third, a teenage boy wearing a leather jacket, had his face buried in his phone. Steve sighed in relief. If he kept quiet it was very unlikely that anyone would –
Tony sniffed. “What does it look like?”
Instead he kept taking Toni out, letting
“Well, that's a lie,” Steve said, but the smile he gave Tony was utterly fond as he nodded towards the doorway. “Come on. Shower.”
Subject: Assignment to Retrieve Escaped Avengers
Tony's head snapped sideways so fast he felt a crick in his neck as he stared at Steve in astonishment. “What?”
“I'm not going to shackle you to the bed before I absolutely need to,” Tony said firmly. “You're not a goddamn animal. Stop trying to make me do this.”
Steve swallowed past the sudden lump in his throat, his heart pounding as he straddled the doll, sitting right in its lap. He felt a twinge in his oversensitive cock when his thigh made contact with a matching hardness in the doll's pants, his throat suddenly dry.
“No, I am. That's – that's not the problem.” Steve looked up at Tony, and the open trust and understanding in his eyes finally cemented his resolve. “
“You want to be punished?”
Him and Steve had spent most of the time lazing around, watching TV and occasionally fucking on every available surface of the cabin. It was a very nice change to their daily lives where they were lucky if they had the time to sleep in the same bed for a whole night.
Steve smiled warmly. “No need to thank me, Mr. Stark. I'm just glad you're feeling better.”
Instead of voicing his thoughts he lifted Tony into his arms, ignoring his protests as he carried him out of the workshop, grabbing a blanket for modesty on the way.
Bruce looked up from his newspaper across the table, a dreamy sort of haze clouding his eyes before he seemed to shake himself out of it, giving Steve an apologetic smile. “Sorry. No, nothing yet.”
“Okay, um.” Steve swallowed. “Your dick is really small.”
“Steve!” Tony called, drawing Steve's attention towards him. “Calm down. It won't let me go if we don't do this and besides, you'll be right here watching.”
Tony frowned, feeling along the suspiciously flat surface of Steve's shaft. Steve looked like he was ready to blow, how wasn't he swelling already?
“I know, baby. Just give me a second, then I can –“
could be Nomad in private,” Tony said with waggling eyebrows and Steve snorted, poking him in the side.
for your time today. Did you come here in a cab?"
Tony waved his free hand. “Oh, you know. Secret underground clubhouse. Vampires only though, so I don't think you'd be welcome there.”
It was biology and hormones and all kinds of shit that made Tony sway on his feet every time he entered a room Steve was in, that made Steve's pupils dilate in return, made Tony's eyes flick to his lips and stay there, imagining all the ways he could bite them red. From up close Steve's scent almost made him dizzy with want, his fingers tingling with the urge to touch.
“Just – look!” Steve opened the book to its first page and started flipping through it until he found what he wanted. “I kept drawing you. In exile, when we were – I drew you all the time.”
“You won't. And besides, we don't even know if you're going to rut yet.”
“Dr. Rogers will be with you in a moment,” Dr. Yinsen said before he closed the door, leaving Tony to his own devices. For a wild second Tony considered climbing through the window and making a run for it, but in the end it would be pointless. Without his legal guardian Tony couldn't get a passport, let alone pay for whatever accommodations he needed. He'd be stuck on the streets, and ill-advised medical treatment or not, Tony wasn't desperate enough for that.
“Don't worry, we'll take care of that,” Tony said with a wink, getting up and holding out a hand to Steve. “Do you trust me?”
“You just said –“
He took the elevator up to the penthouse, silently praying that Steve wouldn't be waiting up for him, but his vain hope was shattered when he saw Steve sitting on the couch, apparently reading a book. Tony veered left before Steve could see him, heading straight to the bar where he poured himself three fingers of Scotch. If he could just take it to their bedroom before – “Hey, Tony. You're home early.”
from New York. But me and my friends live in LA right now, so it wasn't all that far.”
“I hate this,” Steve said eventually and Tony sighed, pulling him a little closer.
“I’m glad.”
Steve made a small noise of protest, trying to pull Tony back into his arms, but Tony leaned back, sliding off the bed.
"No!" Tony grabbed Steve's shoulders tightly. "No, don't you dare!"
“You're a fucking cheater,” he murmured, and Steve chuckled roughly, nosing at Tony's chin before he pressed a kiss to it.
“Okay,” Steve said, still a little subdued, and Tony kissed him softly before he pillowed his head on Steve's chest.
“Of course you are. But you obviously do want to get with Steve. Who happens to be an alpha.”
“I could've sworn –“ The officer shook his head, scratching his neck as he looked back at Steve who raised an eyebrow at him.
, his muscles tightening without any strain. There was a pulse at the base of his spine that quickly spread to his entire body, a thrumming warmth not unlike slowly lowering himself into a hot bath.
“Steve,” he whined, and the arm Steve had wrapped around his waist tightened, prompting him to look up so Steve could press their lips together, slowly coaxing Tony's mouth open with his tongue until Tony felt like he would shake apart from the feeling.
this had been. He'd bonded Steve without knowing any of the consequences, without even asking for his permission. Tony had taken advantage of him, claimed him in a way that may be irreversible, and now they were stuck like this,
He also hadn't expected Steve to need more right away. Not that he was complaining.
“Yeah, I'm out of here,” Steve said decisively, getting up from his seat just as the door banged open and Clint stormed in, Tony hot on his heels.

“Oh, for sure. Steve, you ever heard of a cougar?”

“After the trial though?”
Former US General Thaddeus Ross put his career on the line earlier this year with his attempted incarceration of New York's favorite heroes – justifiably so, some may say. Now he is under fire for his involvement in the construction of a secret superhero prison, which by standards of the UNCAT (United Nations Convention against Torture) has been described as a slap in the face of human rights and shows just how cruel, inhuman and degrading the detainment and/or punishment of our heroes was apparently meant to be.
Steve laughed quietly, his hands rubbing firm circles into Tony's back. It felt so good that Tony couldn't help the way he melted in his arms. Steve smelled like soap and the bread he'd baked earlier that day, but when Tony buried his nose in his neck there was just warm skin and
The feeling almost paled in comparison to the sight though.
He blinked, looking down to find Tony staring at him with a confused frown.
They didn’t speak on the way to their bedroom, just kept stealing glances at each other that said more than words could anyway. Steve’s hands were slow and steady as he tugged Tony’s shirt over his head, pulling him into an embrace as soon as his chest was bare. Tony tilted his head back, shivering at the feeling of Steve’s beard scratching against his neck as Steve trailed kisses down his throat.
Steve bit his lip as he nodded, his mind whirling with despair. He couldn't do this. If Tony saw – he would –
"You're not hiding, you live here." Snip. "And they can't throw you in jail." Tony paused when Bucky snorted, frowning at the back of his head. "They can't. I bailed you out. The only way they'll have a reason to take you in is if you run. Don't be stupid, Bucky."
“I can smell you,” he murmured, and Steve leaned down to nuzzle Tony's hair, scenting him right back.
“Of course I would. But I don't think you're fucking any pastries to get off, so how would I know.” Steve's surprised snort broke the tension a little, which was exactly what Tony wanted. “I don't really know what to tell you. It feels good, obviously. Better when it's still warm.”
Steve came so hard his vision whited out, riding the pressure of his own fist as he pumped his cock until he had nothing left, slumping heavily onto his chair. By the time he could open his eyes again the plant had already lowered Tony back onto the floor, its vines retreating one by one until Tony's limbs dropped to the ground like they were made of rubber, completely motionless.
may expect more than one lawsuit, the most prominent of which would be filed against Tony Stark for perjury.
“The expulsion of fluids. Don't worry, it's nothing sexual. Purely stress relief, I promise.”
Steve gave Tony a slightly panicked look as he stood up, and Tony tried to look as reassuring as possible as he waved him along. He wasn't quite sure that he succeeded.
“T–“ Steve bit down on his admonishment, crossing his arms over his chest to hopefully hide the fact that his hands were trembling. It wasn't even that good, not nearly enough stimulation to get him off under any other circumstances, but coupled with the awareness of the people nearby who could look up and catch the flush on his cheeks at any second –
“Oh god, oh god, oh god,” he kept babbling, his voice raising in pitch when Tony grabbed his balls with his other hand, squeezing them gently as he twisted his palm around the head of Steve's cock. “
“Accent.” Tony gestured vaguely at his own throat. “Grew up around it, you could say.”
“You just fucked a pie with me. I'm not going to be complaining about anything in the near future.”
Obie nodded, straightening up as he wrapped an arm around Tony's shoulders and shook Steve's hand with the other. “Thank you, doc. We appreciate your efforts.”

“You like it?”
Tony hummed. “More like dog room at this point.”

“You can use your mouth,” she said, tapping a finger against the hand on her clit. “Right here. Lick it, suck it – I can tell you how as we go along.”
Another slap made him realize that there was a familiar pressure building behind his eyes, the one that he was so used to suppressing, but being held by Steve like this, utterly exposed, made it impossible to draw on his usual defenses. “Seventeen,” he choked out, and the hand Steve still had in his hair tightened its grip.
For a second Steve didn't get it, but then his cheeks heated as he pulled off Tony's cock and coated his fingers with lube.
“Come on, you know what's going on. You just don't want to think about it.”
“Here you go. Happy now?” he asked when he plopped back down, crossing his legs as he read the donation messages that kept trickling in now that he was sitting down and reading them. “Aww, The_Captain thinks I'm beautiful,” Tony said with a smile even though a ten-dollar donation usually didn't warrant him answering it. But sometimes he liked to encourage smaller donations, especially when they were sweet. “Ten gift coins for a ticket, people. We're drawing lots at ten thousand to see who wins the meet-and-greet. Might even lead to happy ending if you're lucky.”
“Promise me you'll let me field the questions,” Tony said and Bucky rolled his eyes.
“Yes, you can.” Tony hoisted his hips higher, and Steve moaned so hard his throat felt raw with it when it changed the angle and let Tony slide even
“Okay. Good.” Tony fiddled with the phone in his pocket, feeling a bit like there was a mental block between him and his usual small talk banter. Like his words mattered more than usual. Which was absurd because Steve was just like all the other guys he'd sucked off for a picture, aside from the meet-and-greet thing.
Toni clicked her tongue. “You're doing tricks for some petty cash? Does 'dance, monkey, dance' work on you too?”
But the arc had also taken things from him that he hadn’t even known he would miss until they were gone. Things that he’d always taken for granted. Rarely every thought about really.
“Right?” Tony shook Steve in excitement before he patted his chest with careful fingers, not wanting to disturb whatever had set this off. “Look at them! It's like I'm thirty-two aga–
Your work with the UN in recent months has been invaluable. But before I sign off on these accords I want to discuss some of the finer points with you.
“You're doing so well, Tony,” Steve said, and Tony felt the praise rush through him like a soothing balm, calming the storm that was still racing through his mind. “Why are you being punished?”
“Toni,” Steve whined, hunching his back when she pulled him forward by the hair, his hips jerking as he tried to fuck her fist, hands clenching on her shoulders. He was probably going to leave bruises, but god, did Toni not give a shit. “Oh god – oh god –“
Steve whirled around to see the creature standing behind him, leaning on one of the rocks and watching Steve with a wide grin. Apparently not at all self-conscious about the fact that its cock was still fully on display.
, and Tony chuckled at the noise Steve made when he pulled back, fingers teasing at the waistband of Steve's pants.
But as Tony writhed in the plant's bonds, obviously enjoying its touch, the green contrasting beautifully with his tan skin – fuck.
Steve jumped, whipping around with his shield raised –
“Which is why we will take this to your bedroom so you can open it in your own time,” Clint said so cheerfully that it raised the hairs on the back of Steve’s neck.
“Wouldn't expect anything less,” Steve said and felt himself relaxing when he realized that it was true. He knew just how capable Tony's hands were.
“Good boy.” Tony shivered, eyes dropping closed as Steve ran a hand through his hair. “What do you need?”
“Yeah, well,” Tony said evasively, and Steve tilted his chin up until their eyes met.
it,” Steve said, not in the least bit mocking, and something uneasy in Tony's chest uncoiled. "It's just... Doesn't this kind of defeat the purpose of me not being in the field?"
“It's stupid. You don't have to say anything. Sorry.”
Two months after Tony flew a nuke into space Steve asked him out on a date.
Tony nodded, watching as Steve took a deep breath.
Tony stared at him. “How is that – Steve, I could
But the doll was warm now, probably from his own body heat. Steve stroked a hand down its left arm and marveled at how realistic it felt, despite the synthetic texture. The weight of it felt good in his arms and as Steve’s brain shook off the last vestiges of sleep he realized that he’d slept better than he had in months.
“Yes, obviously.” Tony heard the condescending undertone only after he'd said it, and he gritted his teeth around a smile. “I mean, that's the standard procedure. For this kind of thing.”
“You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?” Steve mumbled in her ear as he led her across the dance floor, held securely in his arms. Or, more accurately, he let
Steve raised his head with enormous effort to meet Tony's eyes and the warm acceptance there made his skin prickle with relief.
That made Steve feel... some kind of way. Definitely not disappointed.
“I didn't know,” Steve said so quickly that he was almost stumbling over his words. “I love you so much, Tony, but – it just didn't – you smelled all wrong. I'm sorry.”
"You have a right to your opinion. But also, you're wrong." Tony grabbed the mirror and held it up, smirking when Bucky went very still as soon as he caught sight of his reflection. "Yeah, that's you. Not too shabby, huh?"
"You like it, don't you?" Steve asked, looking up at Tony with knowing eyes that twinkled with amusement and arousal alike. "You want me to go down on you?"
Steve blinked. “What?”
So they kept going on dates, and eventually Tony let Steve take him to his room and make love to him. Steve was almost painfully gentle, like he thought he might break Tony into a million pieces if he so much as looked at him wrong, and Tony took great pleasure in training that out of him, teaching him how to touch Tony exactly the way he liked. Steve didn’t have much experience, so Tony had the great privilege of learning Steve’s body alongside him, finding all the ways they could bring each other pleasure.
“Can we use it now?”
Steve's mind blanked for a second. Then, from one moment to the next, he was standing right in front of Tony, his chest thrumming with the same warmth that Tony's eyes held as they stared at each other. He could feel his blood rushing in his veins when Tony grabbed his hand and stepped even closer until they were almost sharing the same air, their noses only inches apart. Steve could barely draw a breath when he reached up to touch Tony's face, curling his fingers around the curve of his ear.
Steve shifted in his seat, his cheeks getting a little red as Tony stared at him. “Just wondering. There's gotta be a reason why you do it, right?”
Steve groaned, breathing wetly against the side of Tony's neck. “Yeah. Gonna –“ He choked on a moan that raised goosebumps on Tony's skin. “Gonna fuck you right. Good.”
“Oh,” he breathed, and Toni's pulse jumped when he carelessly tossed his pants aside to drop onto his knees right in front of her, his hands coming up to grip her thighs as he stared at her core. “Wow...”
Ignacio frowned, but Tony's eyes were drawn to Steve when he suddenly jerked, his right arm firmly held in another vampire's grip.
Steve shook his head as he walked further into the room, intent on just cutting the stupid thing down when his boyfriend suddenly let out a choked scream. “Tony!”
Wow, the last few weeks have been stressful. I hope you guys are doing better than me because hot damn, I just want to push a pause button on my whole life xD Anyway, please enjoy this chapter and I'll see you in two days!
“Please,” Steve pressed. “I want – just tell me. Why did you sign?”
, his blood absolutely boiling, and –
But that didn't matter. That was then, this was now.

Tony hummed. “Well, you're the artist. I trust your judgement.”
He ignored the circus behind him as he walked towards Tony, clearly the only sane person left in the room since he was tapping away on his phone instead of joining the madness. Tony didn't look up, even when Steve came to a stop right next to him, and somewhere deep in Steve's gut was that same knot of anxiety that always clouded his interactions with Tony now. They still hadn't found an equilibrium after what happened in Siberia two years ago, but Steve liked to think that they were getting better. At least they were talking to each other again.
“I've been dreaming about seeing you like this again. It's even better than I remember.”
“Or maybe it's just not going to happen this time, and that's okay,” Steve said gently, kissing behind Tony's ear, and Tony sighed.
Steve blinked in surprise as Natasha turned to give him an incredulous look. “What?”
Tony snorted. “We really need to get our sea legs back if a hand job makes you say wow these days.”
A bit of wiggling brought them close enough together that Tony's cock was trapped between their stomachs, all of his nerve endings firing at once. He could feel the pressure building as his balls drew up, writhing in Steve's lap as if he could get him even
“Of course you fucking did! All you had to do was sit on your asses and let me do my
"Okay," Bucky said hoarsely, squeezing his wrist once before he let it go. His eyes were very bright when he looked at Tony. "Thank you." They both knew it wasn't for the razor.
“Tony.”
Toni was just going have to deal with it.
The past couple of weeks have been a LOT (I moved and started at a new job, which I would suggest never doing during a lockdown because it SUCKS), so I'm still doing a lot of adjusting in real life. But I'm determined to get back to semi-regular updates on this. It might still take a while, but once I've settled back into a rhythm I'll finally finish this thing.
The doors hissed as they opened and Steve stepped inside, mindful to leave enough space behind him so Tony could maneuver around as he did what Tony asked, grabbing on to the nearest pole. Tony's arms wrapped around his waist and Steve widened his stance, his pulse jumping when Tony slid his hands across his stomach.
“I love you.” Steve pressed a soft kiss to Tony's slack mouth. “You don't have to say it back. I know, after what I did –“
“So that's settled.”
“Oh, wow.”
Tony slumped down on top of Steve as the waves cresting through him slowly ebbed into the sweet ache of aftershocks, trying to catch his breath. Steve kept twitching underneath him as he rode through his orgasm, his knot pulsing so hard that Tony could feel it in his ass, but eventually his body relaxed all at once, and Tony hummed as he pressed his face against Steve's neck, breathing him in.
“That's amazing,” Steve breathed so earnestly that Tony felt a little warm in the face, his chest glowing with pride.
“Oh,” Tony said faintly, and Steve couldn't even look at him. He realized distantly that he was shaking, his arm trembling with the strain even as he finally felt some sensation on his cock that went beyond a blatant tease. For a second he felt sick.
“For, you know –“ Steve gestured at himself, his face flushing a little. “Taking care of me.”
“What do you want?”
Steve would never admit it, but he
“Proud of yourself?”
“Hey, you still awake?” Tony asked quietly and Steve mumbled something unintelligible, burrowing his face deeper into Tony's neck. He sounded really content. Maybe they should just go to sleep...
“If I can't go over it with a black light without uncovering a Jackson Pollock I will castrate both of you.”
Another hit. Tony clenched his teeth when the pain lingered a little longer this time, his ass probably bright red by now. “Fourteen.”
“There are more Winter Soldiers,” Bucky said curtly and Tony blinked, looking honestly taken off guard for a moment.
“It does.” Tony shuffled his feet, feeling like his clothes had become a size too small for his body. “If you don't want me to, I won't.”
“Okay, yeah, it does. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. We can make it our own.”
“Who knows, maybe we'll surprise ourselves.” Steve's eyes were intense and Tony couldn't look away, his heart beating almost painfully in his chest. “I'll just say what I think. Correct me if I'm wrong, okay?”
“Yeah well maybe I don’t need your fucking help! Or your fucking opinion!”
The implications of it didn't really sink in until their first outing as a group, when Toni invited all of the Avengers to her mother's annual charity ball. Toni was wearing a low-cut evening gown that accentuated her curves and that the paps would probably call scandalously revealing for her age, and while all of the Avengers made comments, some more complimentary than others, it was Steve's reaction that stuck out to her the most.
It came out a lot more breathless than he’d meant it to, but Tony didn’t even blink, his eyes twinkling with mirth.
giving head. He'd be the first to admit that he had a bit of an oral fixation, what with him getting off on having his mouth stuffed full of cock, but it had served him well in this line of work. At least he didn't have to fake how much he enjoyed it.
This was going to be a long night.
“I could hurt you –“
“I know,” Steve said, not putting him down until they were in the shower. He didn't turn it on, mindful of what water pressure might do to Tony's backside right now, but he did wet a washcloth and wipe them both down.
Tony froze, his head snapping up at the familiar tone, and Steve eyed him for a long moment before he sat on the couch and pointed at his feet.
“Side effect?” Tony asked, and Steve gestured at Tony's crotch.
“It's round, Steve. You can stick your dick in from any end.”
And he came, messily, all over her chest and stomach as he sobbed out ruined noises and buried his face in her hair, his arms wrapping around her to hold her close while he shook through his orgasm. Toni stroked him through it, milking him for every drop until Steve started squirming on her lap, whimpering with oversensitivity. She wiped her hand on the sheets before she hugged him back, guiding him backwards until they were lying side by side, still wrapped up in each others' arms.
“Oh?” Steve smiled. “You think I’d cause trouble otherwise?”
He keened when she started stroking him for real, stripping his cock mercilessly as she dug her teeth into the side of his neck, tugging his hair
Steve let out a shaky breath and nodded, raising Tony's hips a little to find the perfect angle before he pulled out and thrust in again, swallowing the sound he wanted to make. Tony didn't have the same restraint, moaning loudly as he clutched at Steve's shoulders. Steve had the brief thought that Tony might be playing it up for him a little, but then Tony clenched around him, twisting his hips to fuck himself on Steve's cock, and Steve lost himself in the rush of sensation.
Steve watched incredulously as the plant wrapped another vine around Tony's waist to make him stop struggling, its leaves swaying eerily even though there was no draft in the workshop. “What the hell is that?”
“Next time we'll do something
Toni waved him off. “Nonsense. You guys rake in probably a third of the cash we raise. If anything I should be thanking
“Just let it out.” Tony poked him in the ribs. “Scream, curse, whatever you want. You never have, right? You should try it, it's fun.”
“Nah, just give me the juicy details,” Tony said distractedly, elbow deep in Iron Man's chest piece. He always loved when he got to blowtorch stuff.
Steve licked his bottom lip, shaking his head. “No. I really want to kiss you. If that's okay.”
“What days?”
“I don't want to be another bargaining chip for Ross to push Tony under his thumb. And as long as the Accords are under his supervision I feel like if I sign...” Steve shrugged. “I don't know. It just doesn't sit right with me.”
That was the whole problem, wasn't it. “I have no idea.”
Steve gritted his teeth. “If you think this is funny, Tony –”
a club?” Steve asked and Tony snorted.
“You get it now, don't you?” Tony asked cheekily, squeezing Steve's ass until Steve couldn't suppress a quiet noise. “I can do whatever I want to you and nobody will know. Just you and me.”
“Did you come on my face?” Tony chuckled when Steve pinched him in the side, feeling Steve's skin heat up as he kissed him on the cheek. “I bet you did. Did I open my mouth for you? Catch it on my tongue?”
Tony swallowed hard as Steve took his hand and led him inside. “Yeah. Let's get this over with.”
Avenger | Head of R&D at Stark Industries
“You're looking a bit overwhelmed there.”
“You don't think I've tried that?” Steve asked heatedly, anger simmering in his eyes. “Damn it, Toni, I
“You do realize that you might end up having to blow some sweaty old man with a micropenis though, right?”
“Nobody knows you came here, right?” Tony asked and Lang nodded. “Just go home then. I'll pay for the flight. Nat?”
“What's wrong?” Steve asked, and Tony swallowed hard, grabbing the fabric with pointed fingers to pull it away from his body.
“That is
Steve's palm came down in the exact spot he'd struck the first time, and Tony almost choked on the moan that was trying to claw its way out of his throat. “Eleven,” he gasped, all but squirming with arousal when Steve shifted just enough that Tony could feel how hard he was through his pants. Knowing that Steve was getting off on this just as much as him was its own sort of pleasure, the kind that made his chest swell with warmth and his blood sing.
“Do you want to sit?” he asked, gesturing at the couch, and Steve smiled with obvious relief.
“Okay,” he said hoarsely, and Tony's grin widened as he reached down and –
“Does it hurt?” Steve asked urgently, his face suddenly very close. “Mr. Stark?”
“Yes.” Maybe. “I’ll be alright. Bye, Buck.”

fault! Why are you –“ His breathing hitched when Tony slowly slid down his body, reaching back to line Steve's cock up with his ass. Steve was trembling, his muscles so tense that they felt like carved marble under Tony's hands, obviously trying to hold himself in check this time. “Tony –“

Steve shuddered so hard that the motion shook through Tony's back before Steve's first thrust knocked him flat on the bed. He didn't manage to get his bearings before Steve did it again, pushing Tony down until Steve was pinning him with his entire body weight, pressing him into the mattress. Tony grunted at the sudden friction on his cock.
Tony quickly pulled Steve into his side with a firm arm around his waist. “I have! He's my –“ He glanced at Steve for a second, hoping that he wasn't overstepping here. “Well, we're together. Have been for a while.”
Steve grabbed his coffee cup just in time before Tony slammed a package on the table, rattling Steve’s eggs and bacon. He sighed. “Is it worth assaulting my breakfast over?”
“Don't worry. I think we've got it covered.”
“I'll want to fuck you again,” Steve said bluntly, and Tony hid a smile against his chest.
Steve knew Tony's scheming face when he saw it. Knowing that Tony was already thinking up ways for them to repeat this experience was stirring up something between exasperation and arousal in his chest. Which was pretty much how he felt around Tony eighty percent of the time.
, Pep,” Tony said, dipping his can-cheese nachos in garlic powder. “And it doesn't fit my aesthetic. We've talked about this.”
“Thank you,” Steve said, but the concierge didn't even look at him as they passed, just closed the door softly behind them. Tony felt a strong sense of foreboding as he looked down the narrow staircase.
“Do they?” Clint asked innocently and Steve sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.
his face, his skin, right there – “Surprise?”
"Because we're hot and – okay,

,” he said, so quietly that Steve wasn't sure if he was even supposed to hear it, and Steve smiled, snuggling closer. He'd do anything in his power to make Tony as happy as he made him.
Tony laughed, and Steve smiled proudly before he turned to the stove to heat up some water. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself because he could already feel arousal thrumming deep in his stomach just from the implication of having Tony here, alone, at night, after they'd both just enjoyed a nice evening together.
Steve's heart was pounding. They'd been too loud, someone would – someone –
“I –“ Tony swallowed hard. “I let it... get to me?”
Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this one <3
Steve snapped his mouth shut, his stomach clenching when Bucky smiled wryly.
“Everything you dreamed of, big guy?” Toni asked, trying to lighten the suddenly heavy mood, and he looked up at her with something like awe and a lot more like love written all over his face.
“It's
“And I’m grateful every day.” Tony hummed when Rhodey stroked a hand through his hair. “Look, I’m sorry you don’t lactate anymore. Did the doctor say it’s permanent?”
"High praise from a genius."
"That's right," Tony said smugly and Steve sighed, putting his head in his hands.
Steve had always enjoyed hiking by himself. His mother used to get worried sick when he ran around the woods all day and only came back after dark, but Steve loved it, loved the fresh air and the smell of pine trees. Now even more so, when he could combine his errands in the next village over with a nice trek through the forest. It was good for his lungs too, or so the doctor had said.
“You're a peach, Pep,” Tony said around another mouthful of cheesy sin, and Pepper stopped typing.

“Yeah, yeah. Let's get a move on before you start fucking on the tarmac.”

“You could have seen it a lot sooner,” one of the older vampires said, and Tony waved him off.
“Better now?” he asked gently, and Steve nodded with a relieved sigh, finally relaxing as he made it through the endorphin rush.
"Yes?"
Steve's lips twitched up in a smile. “That's a weirdly specific number.”
“One,” he croaked, and Steve gave a pleased hum only a moment before his palm struck again, this time on Tony's other cheek. It felt just as good as the first one, and Tony already felt the way his breathing picked up speed, his cock slowly filling out against his thigh. He was sure Steve could feel it too, but if he did he didn't call attention to it. “Two.”
“I like you so much,” Steve mumbled into his hair, and Tony pinched him in the side until Steve pulled back to look at him, his eyes catching on Tony's cheeky grin.
Tony quirked a smile. “We have mountains of evidence to back up our claims. Why wouldn't I?” He pointed at a man in the back. “You, yellow shirt.”
So it seems that my muse has returned, hallelujah! If all goes well I'll be back on my every other day update schedule but if I have gap days somewhere in there, don't be alarmed. I'm alright :) Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this chapter!
“Hydroelectric generator,” Tony corrected, deciding to let it slide for now. “Remember general asshole? The one with the bush-stache?”
Steve's chest felt warm with affection as he smiled, bending down to give Tony a proper kiss. “The
“No! If I want a fucking drink, I’ll have a fucking drink! You can’t stop me!”
“It's been years since I've been on one of these,” Tony breathed so quietly even Steve had to strain to hear it. Steve wanted to ask why Tony had
“Oh! I thought I heard you come in, but I wasn't sure. Are you guys ready?”
Bucky huffed a laugh. “Okay. You’re sure about this?”
“I don't –“
“Ye of little faith,” Tony drawled, but Steve nodded, firmly grabbing at where he assumed Tony was. He blinked when his hand only met air.
“I wish I couldn't attest to that,” Natasha sighed, and Tony narrowed his eyes at her. “Relax. I meant that you two aren't exactly subtle. Or discreet.”
“Hey. You think Thor –“
“Alright, champ. Lead the way.”
“Closest room,” Steve mumbled and Tony only laughed louder when Steve pulled away to glare at him, the effect ruined by his beet-red face. “You said we were alone.”
"I do try."
“Oh really?” Tony drawled, a genuine grin spreading on his face. “Do tell.”
“I didn't think I could still do that,” Tony mumbled, and Steve made a quiet noise of assent before he pressed a kiss to Tony's shoulder.
“Only while sparring. Though I don't know if you'd call that sitting.”
“I'm full of surprises,” Steve deadpanned, smiling when Tony chuckled. “We both agree that the Accords are flawed and that we can't trust Ross.”
Steve chuckled, tapping a finger against the white star in the middle of his chest. “Are you terribly attached to the colors?”
“Technically not a whole floor,” he mumbled and Steve laughed, poking him in the ribs.
“Oh, no thank you, I don't drink,” Steve said, and Tony hummed.
“Not as a snack,” Tony said quickly, brow furrowing. “At least I sure hope not. I don't really know the rules to be honest.”
“I can't –“ Steve couldn't bring himself to say it, but Tony was already nodding, sliding off his lap to put some careful distance between them, and Steve
"You have a beard."
For a second it almost looked like Steve was going to say no – which, hello, what guy said no to a free blowjob, what the hell – but then he nodded stiffly, looking anywhere but at Tony.
"You should keep it," Tony said, and Steve hummed, wrapping an arm around him.
And Steve could
“Okay,” he said hoarsely, looking down at the two translucent sheets to avoid Tony's knowing grin. “Are you sure that glass is the best idea for this?“
– “You're going to feel a release. There's a lot of tension right now, but if you just relax and let it happen you'll feel so much better, I promise.”
“Happy birthday!” they both cheered, and Steve accepted their hugs and shoulder pats with a bemused smile, feeling a strong sense of foreboding as he looked back at the package.
“Tony? Are you –”
He looked up at her with a question in his eyes right before she felt a second finger prod at her entrance, and she nodded, tilting her hips up to make the slide easier as he pushed it in. She jolted when his tongue pressed down right on top of her clit at the same time as his fingers grazed over that spot deep inside her, the sudden friction dragging a moan from her, long and loud, her hands clenching in his hair. Steve echoed the sound when she tugged him forward, a little roughly, her hips jerking as his tongue jostled her clit with tiny licks.
“Yeah,” Tony said, realizing all of a sudden that they'd never really talked about this – “What would you change about them?”
The waved at the waitress as they left, shielding their eyes from the morning sun. For a moment Steve looked out at the city drenched in beautiful reds and yellows and felt a longing so fierce it almost stole his breath away. Bucky stepped up at his side and Steve leaned into him without a second thought, immeasurably grateful when Bucky wrapped an arm around his shoulders and gave him a little shake.
Steve's breath was hot on Tony's cheek, his nose bumping into Tony's. “I thought about your mouth. On me.”
It still feels a little weird to be writing T'Challa after what happened last year. So here's to Chadwick, I have so many fond memories of him, not just in the Marvel fandom, and he will be missed dearly <3 Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed this chapter!
Steve looked at him for a long moment, and Tony was just thinking he might have overstepped his boundaries when Steve lowered his head and laughed quietly. “You're not wrong. I mean, my buddy and I, we... We used to get into some scrapes when we were younger. He's my roommate.” His eyes twinkled as he looked up at Tony. “And unlike me he never grew out of that phase.”
Thanks to everyone who is still reading and I hope you enjoy this chapter. Thanks for your understanding and for all the support, it's really getting me through my days. Thank you, thank you, thank you <3 Now, on to the fic!
The thought that he might get it was almost overwhelming.
“I, uh. I think so, yeah.”
“Make it hurt,” he gritted out, clenching his hands into fists when he could feel a tremor run through them. “I want – I need to feel –“
Tony chuckled tiredly, feeling the urge to pat Steve's hair again, but his arms still felt like jelly. “I don't think I can move.”
His cock was still aching with oversensitivity, but the feeling was slowly shifting from a sharp sting to that same delicious throb that he'd felt before, his stomach twisting itself into knots. He was shaking all over, his thighs sliding against the table as he desperately tried to reach for that peak again, to make the tension burst –
Steve shrugged. “Assignments. You know how it is.”
“No dice,” Steve said, looking down between them with thinly veiled disappointment. “I knew it was too small. Can't even feel it really.”
Dr. Yinsen hummed. “And where did you meet those alphas?”
“No, you can.” Clint pulled out his phone, tapping around for a couple of seconds before he handed it to Tony. “There's all kinds of aids. You're not the first gay male omega, you know?”
The date wasn’t awful. In fact, Tony found himself forgetting all about it as they fell into their usual banter, catching up on what Steve had been doing in DC and all the projects Tony had been working on. It was… nice.
“Looks like we're all in, folks! Any donations from this point forward won't be going towards the raffle draw. But they'll sure be appreciated.”
“Not with me,” Tony said, his eyes narrowing suspiciously. “You seem weirdly... okay. With all of this.”
– you fucking
“This isn't about –“
“Oh! Yes, of course, Ms...”
“So you can't turn him back?” Steve asked, dread sinking into his stomach, but Bruce smiled.
Tony sucked in a breath before his back bowed as he came like a shot, completely blindsided by the rush of pleasure that swept through him. He yelped, clutching at Steve's arm with both hands as he rode it out with a few desperate jerks of his hips, breathing out heavily when he finally came down.
“Yeah, yeah, okay.” Steve gasped when Tony grabbed him tight, tight enough to feel it, and started thrusting. Hard. So hard that it was pushing Steve into the tube before pulling him back, and for a panicked second Steve thought he was going to come right away – “Steve? Are you –”
Tony made a soft noise, his clothes rustling as he probably sat down somewhere. "I'm sorry. You want to talk about it?"
Steve shrugged, his face bright red, and Tony's eyes were immediately drawn to his flushed cheeks, to the blood gathering underneath there because he knew how that
He grunted when Tony dragged him back by the hips, hands scrabbling against the table as his head spun from the sudden lack of pressure on his cock – and then Tony thrust into him, pushing his cock back into the tube and oh god, he couldn't stand it, he was going to fucking
Bucky looked at him for a long time with an unreadable look in his eyes before he nodded. "Yes. I trust you."
"You can cut it. It's fine." Bucky gripped his hair, twisting it around to look at the ends. "I just left it long for convenience."
“Only if we get the couch dirty. Which we won't.”
"Your dick and how much I miss it."
“Tell me what Tony did.” Steve frowned but Bucky just rolled his eyes, waving a hand at him. “You only get that kicked puppy look when it's about him. Now spill.”
"I built you

Tony's vision went dark at the edges, all sounds dulling as his focus honed in on that one spot where he was connected to Steve, his teeth aching in a way they never had when he drank a dead man's blood. He had no idea what to do, but his body knew it for him, sealing his lips over his teeth and pressing his tongue to Steve's skin.
About everything.
“Still not far enough, sweetheart,” Steve tutted. “Come on, you want me to feel you, right? So I can come even though your dick isn't big enough for me?”
As mentioned in previous correspondence the Sokovia Accords are meant to enforce guidelines for the deployment of enhanced individuals in combat situations. As one such group the Avengers will henceforth fall under UN jurisdiction and no longer be recognized as a private organization. The exact details of this arrangement can be found in section 2, article 1, §3-12.
And then he swallowed him down.
“You –”
“Ah!” Steve's legs wobbled when Tony suddenly rubbed him vigorously, hard enough to draw a noise from him that made Steve's cheeks fill with heat. Tony immediately slowed down again, but Steve could see the elderly woman glance up at him for a second before she went back to her conversation with her husband. Holy shit, that had been way too –
“I'm here now, aren't I? Let's get right to it, I have somewhere to be.”
You are hereby commanded to arrest the person/s
– bringing them skin to skin. Steve’s cock was so hard already, a hot red line against Tony’s stomach, and Tony couldn’t resist getting his hand around it, squeezing down just to hear Steve gasp.
Subject: Sokovia Accords
Steve nipped at Tony’s lower lip before he slid his tongue back in, shivering when Tony met him in the middle. Usually he could’ve done this for hours, really lost himself in it, but when he shifted on the bed his knee bumped the clear tube and he
Yeah, yeah, Tony. So much for not being a mentor. If you know the reference in the chapter title, I love you. I hope you enjoy this one!
“You squeeze them too?”
, he couldn't lie to Steve and say that he wasn't all of these things when he knew –
Tony braced himself on Steve's thighs as he shoved his hips down, his back arching when Steve's knot popped inside him, stretching him wide until he thought he would
Possibly to the point where he was obsessing over it, but the jury was still out on that.
“Can I see you again?”
He looked up at the doll, panting as he pressed his forehead against its cheek, staring at the line of its jaw before his eyes traveled up to its mouth, catching on the way its bottom lip jiggled in time with his thrusts. He could push his cock in there, fuck its throat the way he couldn’t with a real person, just go for it and –
Tony bristled. “With all due respect –“
“So you're serious? We're actually doing this?” Tony asked, and Steve leaned over to grab his hand, squeezing it lightly.
Steve swallowed hard, pulling the doll's hips up so he could arrange its legs underneath until it looked like it was kneeling, presenting its ass to Steve. It felt all sorts of perverted, but Steve was determined to try it out, just this once. He had to see it through now.
Steve nodded, his eyes rolling shut when Toni did it again, pulling on his hair with a little more force now. She could see his whole body shift as he rolled his hips, reaching down to grab himself –
“Furry porn?” Tony asked, and Steve's face flushed as he huffed a laugh.
Respectfully transmitted to the Station Commander of
.” Steve squeezed his eyes shut, his hips jerking as his cock throbbed so hard that Tony could see it. “I
For a long moment they were locked in a silent staring match. Then Toni took a shaky breath. “That was so fucking cheesy.”
“Urgh,” he said intelligently, shuddering when Steve suddenly bit his gland, the gentle pressure releasing even more of that soothing smell – holy shit, was that him?
“That’s handy,” Steve said, swallowing hard when Tony sat back on the bed and spread his legs. “Do you want me to… um.”
“Ready?” he breathed and Tony nodded against his lips as Steve lubed up the tube and pressed it against his hole. “Deep breath.”
“Tony.”
“Steve?”
“Oh wow. That's so kind of you, Destroyer,” Tony purred, because he sure wasn't going to be able to say CuntNCockDestroyer with a straight face. “You want to see it up close?”
“I said I don't do that anymore,” she said, her lips feeling strangely numb, and Steve's stance faltered a little before he seemed to catch himself, straightening his shoulders.
Tony braced his hands on Steve's abs and pushed himself up, his mouth dropping open at the drag of Steve's huge cock inside him. It always felt good, but there was something special about how much Steve seemed to love it right now, his hands practically ripping the mattress apart where he was holding on to the bed, head turned away and his eyes squeezed tightly shut as if he was trying desperately to stay in control.
Tony tapped at one of the drawings, and Steve looked down to see his favorite version of Tony's fond smiles staring back at him, the one that always made his blood pump faster and his breathing hitch. Steve swallowed hard, his face heating up with a blush. He remembered drawing this. That picture had been pure wish fulfillment because after what he did Tony would never look at him like that again –
, putting more and more weight on it as Steve tried to find his breath again, blood pumping through his veins hard enough that he could feel it in his throat.
“Shut up.”
Steve shrugged. “Didn't get that far. Wakanda's pretty big.”
“You can sleep for a bit if you want. I'll be here.”
, was that so much to ask –
“Wow, hurtful. I'll have you know, people generally enjoy my compa–”
“Perfect,” Steve sighed, reeling Tony in with an arm around his shoulders as he turned them over, twisting until he was lying on top of Tony, pressing him back into the couch cushions. Tony had absolutely zero complaints, and he let Steve know it with an enthusiastic moan as Steve ground down against him, still kissing him thoroughly.

,” Steve repeated, and this time Tony couldn't stop himself from joining in as Steve broke down in giggles, leaning heavily onto his chest. “Oh my god. How the hell did we get here?”
“Perfect,” he ground out, and Steve moaned, pushing up just enough to get his elbows under him before he started fucking Tony in earnest, forceful little thrusts that rocked Tony's cock against the mattress just right.
“No, ah – it's personal.”
“You drew all of these?” Tony asked incredulously, looking up at Steve with an indiscernible look in his eyes. “Why?”
They did, watching as the concierge pulled out a card and swiped it through the lock, holding his thumb up to the side of it. The light went green, and he opened the door, waving them through with a proper bow this time.
But he hadn't found the right people to fund his private projects yet, so until then he had to rely on his stream money and the generous donations from people who wanted to fuck him. Honestly, it was getting a little tiring.
Steve's breathing hitched. “It – I guess?”
Thaddeus E. Ross
It felt good, the way it always did, but better than that was that he got to watch Steve's eyes widen as he sunk his cock into the warm dough, his hand clenching on Tony's shoulder.
"I don't think so. It itches. I don't know how you do it."
“You're an asshole.”
Steve shucked his clothes a lot more methodically than Tony, his skin burning with anticipation. A part of him still couldn't believe that this was happening, that Tony was not only okay with this but actively helping him solve the problem. Actually, in hindsight he should've expected this. Tony loved coming up with solutions for everything.
“Nice try, short stack.”
“Okay,” Steve rasped out, steeling himself as he gripped the toy tighter. The first stroke already bordered on too much, the way the silicone squeezed his cock so reminiscent of how Tony’s ass felt around him that it stole his breath away.
“That’s good,” Steve said hoarsely as he watched the muscles in Tony’s ass contract when he clenched down, his throat suddenly dry. He only looked up when he heard Tony chuckle.
Steve moaned right in his ear, his next thrust hitting exactly where Tony needed him -
“Okay.” He walked over to Tony's desk to pull up his office chair, sitting down at the edge of the room with his shield propped up against his thigh, ready to step in if need be. “I'll cut it down if it hurts you. Until then I'll be watching from over here.”
“That'll be all, Ms Potts.” Toni slashed the air to make JARVIS close the call before she curled up on her side, hugging the pillow to her chest. Damn it, she hated this.
Tony made a choked noise before he twisted his torso on the next thrust, pushing his hips up as far as he could with what little leverage he had. His cock still didn't reach Steve's cock head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes,” Tony said, fiddling with his hands as Pepper closed her eyes and took a fortifying breath.
“Okay,” Steve said carefully. “But if you want to talk about i-“
Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “Is that so hard to believe? I’m not that desperate, you know.”
There were definitely worse places to be.
We've finally arrived! Man, it feels so satisfying to post this :) I hope you enjoy the reveal <3
“Tony,” Steve said, not quite managing to make it sound like a reprimand, and Tony grinned.
They kept kissing as Steve started rocking them together, slow but with purpose, getting the most out of the friction of the fabric between them. Tony had been half-hard since Steve entered the room, so it wasn't long before he felt that familiar tension building in his gut, his fingers clenching in the back of Steve's shirt.
He started by rubbing his palms up and down Steve's thighs, keeping his touch light and simple as he followed the motions of his hands with his eyes. Before long Steve looked to be faring much better, his muscles relaxing under Tony's hands, and Tony pressed a kiss to his still clothed knee, steadily moving along the inside of Steve's thigh. He only stopped when he felt Steve's zipper against his mouth, pressing a kiss to it before he looked up at Steve through his lashes.
“We're
Tony shrugged. “No idea. I guess I just like how much bigger yours is, I don't know.”
He watched with wide eyes as invisible fingers undid his zipper and pulled out his cock and then couldn't
“I think it worked,” he said breathlessly, and Steve chuffed out a laugh that quickly trailed off into a groan as he pressed his face against Tony's neck.

, requesting service and to return the proof of service within 20 days from receipt thereof.
It took a little longer than usual before Steve's knot deflated enough for him to pull free, and to Tony's surprise Steve didn't wait so much as a second before fucking him again, his cock apparently still hard and ready. Not that Tony was complaining, his own cock slowly starting to beg for release as Steve kept stroking him without pause, keeping just the right pressure to be a blatant tease.
good.” Steve was almost slurring his words now, and Tony grinned smugly, turning over just enough to see Steve's face. The alpha's eyes were glazed over with satisfaction, and Tony could've sworn he had his chest puffed out, shoulders back. Tony chuckled.
Tony pushed his head back into the pillows, baring his neck to Steve who leaned down and buried his face in Tony's neck, sucking in a deep breath. Tony frowned when Steve froze a second later, his whole body suddenly stiff. “Steve? What's wrong?”
Upon retrieval the aforementioned individuals will stand trial for their criminal actions and be punished accordingly. Should they continue to resist signing the Accords the UN will be forced to retire them from active duty indefinitely.
Steve looked up at him and the heat in his gaze made Tony's blood sing. "Not even a little bit."
“Yeah,” Steve said hoarsely, his heart suddenly pounding at the triumphant look in Tony's eyes. “I can feel that.”
“Tony... are you
“What have you been doing for
“Well.” Tony dragged the one syllable out as his smile turned to teasing, making something low in Steve's gut flare with warmth. “I might be in the area. Around noon. In two days.”
The raffle drum was already at least a quarter full, mostly from that one guy who'd dropped a whopping four hundred dollars right at the beginning of the stream, AssMaster69. For some reason Tony saw a distinct lack of ass mastery in his future.
“Hey.” Tony's hand came up to stroke his cheek, and Steve wanted to cry because Tony looked so kind and understanding for all the wrong reasons because Steve was too much of a coward to tell him the truth – “It's okay. We don't have to.”
Natasha grimaced. “Oh no.”
Steve reached for the ones on the counter behind him, but by the time he grabbed them the carton gave and Tony pulled out its contents with a huge grin.

“Come on,” Tony goaded, and Steve felt hot all over with the challenge, like he was burning up. His hands clenched on Tony's waist as he tried to push himself closer, deeper, fuck Tony with everything he had. And when he hoisted Tony's hips up even higher, wrapping his free hand around Tony's cock, Tony arched off the bed and came between them with a guttural groan that went straight to Steve's dick.
Rhodey blinked. “Okay?”
“Let's move to the couch,” he said, and Steve nodded but made no move to get up. Tony sighed, gently guiding him back to his feet – or rather heaving him up until Steve could stand on his own, before he led them both over to the couch where Steve flopped down on top of Tony, burying his face in his chest.
Tony didn't let go of Steve's hand all the way into the workshop, a delighted thrill running down his spine every time Steve's thumb brushed over his skin. They didn't really hold hands all that much since neither of them liked attracting paparazzi and even in private Steve usually preferred to wrap his arm around Tony's waist, but at this moment Tony would've rather died than let go.

Tony grinned as he kept working, mentally patting himself on the back for a job well done with every muscle he could feel gradually loosening in Steve's body. Steve was beautiful like this, all that strength and raw power going soft and lax under Tony's hands... fuck, Tony could get addicted to this.
“What do you need, Tony?”
To: t.stark@starkindustries.com
His voice held enough of a challenge that Steve felt his hackles rise to it, and before he could second-guess himself he reached out and placed his palm right in the middle of Tony's chest.
When he was finally done he sat back on his haunches, looking at Steve's heaving chest. “Okay, I'm done. That should hold you.”
"Yes, dear?" he asked cheekily, and Steve looked up at him with hard eyes and that
“Tony, this is serious! We have to –“ Steve broke off, feeling his expression slip for a moment before he steeled it into an unimpressed frown. “Tony.”
"Hey," Tony said gently and Steve sucked in a breath, putting a hand over his eyes when he felt them prickle tellingly. “Are you alright?”
“Oh yeah, tell us more about back in your day, grandma.”
“You're going to regret this,” Toni said, not sure if she way speaking to him or herself, but Steve's face lit up with a brilliant smile as he grabbed her hand and lifted it up to his mouth, pressing a kiss to her knuckles.
that it stole Tony's breath away.
“Okay.” Tony laid back down, pillowing his head on Rhodey’s leg. “Now keep petting my hair. I’m cold.”
“Hey there. How are we feeling?”
So, I know this isn't the chapter most of you were expecting, but I hope you still enjoy it ;) Thanks for reading!
The Avengers alarm blared. All of them looked up at where JARVIS was flashing a red alert signal. Great.
“Thank you,” Tony blurted out suddenly, grabbing Steve's arm before the doctor could lead him out into the corridor. “This was – just, thank you.”
“Steve! Help me!”
“Yeah, yeah, round three later. Come on, get your ass out of bed.” He twitched at a light slap on the back of his thigh, glaring at Steve’s innocent face. “You missed.”
Natasha smiled as Clint walked over to stand next to her, followed almost directly by Wanda. Sam hesitated for a moment but after a quick nod from Steve he joined them too. Tony cocked his head at Scott who was still standing at Steve's side.
“Oh.” He watched Tony's eyes light up in understanding before they softened with sympathy as Tony laid his hands on Steve's arms. “I'm sorry. I should've known...”
Tony's first thought was that he was pretty, long lashes and strong features and – wow,
“Is that better?” Tony asked through gritted teeth, and Steve tried to sell it, tried to thrust up into Tony's grip – but that just made Tony loose focus, his grip going slack, and Steve bit his lip to keep from making a forlorn noise. Tony was breathing hard from exertion already, and even if Steve could've gotten off with the pressure Tony could give him, he knew that Tony didn't have the arm strength to keep it up long enough to get him off. It was hopeless.
“That's great, Tony. I'm glad you do.” He leaned in close with a glance at Steve. “No funny business, right? He didn't touch you?”
Tony stroked him faster, pulling out every little trick that he knew would push Steve over the edge, rippling his fingers over the glans, adding pressure to the tip, swiping his thumb over his frenulum – but Steve didn't come.
Hello hello! I hope that you enjoy this chapter and that you have a wonderful day <3 Thanks for reading!
He caught the way Steve's hands curled into fists before Steve hid them in his lap. “So, uh. You like to... fuck pie.”
“I should –“
He was distantly aware of the way Steve's grip tightened as he pumped his cock back and forth in the scant inch of space that the knot allowed, but his mind was swimming too much to really track what was going on until Steve was already done, slumping down on the sheets with a groan as he pulled Tony into his arms.
That one didn't sound so good. Steve was about to ask what was wrong when he all but choked on his tongue as the plant spread Tony's thighs and he got a clear view of one of the vines pushing its way inside Tony's ass, writhing so much it almost looked painful. “Fuck, Tony, does it – Is it hurting you?”
Steve had his hands clasped in front of him, and it took Toni a moment to place where she'd seen that before – until she realized that this was what Steve did whenever he had to make a public appearance or give a speech. Which was... weird. At least in this context.
Secretary of State
“That's what I said.” Tony's voice was right on the edge of a hysterical laugh, and Steve grinned at him, so carefree and
Tony groaned when Steve came, just like that, letting Tony suck his orgasm right out of him as if it was nothing. He stuffed a hand down his own pants, jerking himself off furiously, and with the taste of Steve still on his tongue he followed him right over the edge, his whole body slumping with relief.
They both turned to see the Wakandan woman hiding a smile behind her hand before she straightened up, giving Steve a curt nod.
Pepper obligingly picked up the phone, raising an eyebrow as she scanned the screen. “The Iron Cougar? Toni, what –“
Steve's adam's apple jumped when Tony burrowed his nose into his neck, taking a deep sniff that made his fingers tingle, the same way he remembered from when he first met Steve.
New chat! There will be a bunch of those littered around the story, so I hope you'll enjoy this one! Also, did YOU know Peggy's funeral took place in London? Because I didn't remember that until I rewatched the movie. Thanks for reading!
it or something –“
“In my defense I thought we were.” Steve grimaced and Tony grinned, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck. “So. Where were we?”
“Has he been cleared for that by someone other than an Avengers therapist?” someone shouted and Tony forced a smile.
“Not here,” Steve said firmly, setting Tony back on his feet as he straightened his clothes. Tony barely restrained himself from pouting. “Let’s go to our room.”
“Me too,” Steve rasped out, sounding utterly wrecked, and Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck to hold on as the heat low in his stomach ratcheted up to almost unbearable levels, his thighs spasming with every other thrust.
“Huh?” The way Steve seemed to physically drag his eyes away from Tony's body was more than a little gratifying. “Sorry, I – yeah. You look beautiful, Dave.”
Tony's stomach dropped.
“Why am I not surprised.”
“What?”
“I'll text you possible dates. Stick to the schedule this week, Tony, I mean it.”
Tony's chest was heaving by now, his head thrown back so far that Steve could only make out the bottom of his chin, though he could still hear his heavy breathing that was interspersed with full-throated moans whenever the vines hit a particularly good spot. Steve would've loved to see Tony's face, but watching the plant fuck Tony like this, expertly wringing him in ways that made Tony squirm within his bonds – that was almost as good.
Ah. That explained it.
“It's beautiful,” Steve said in awe as soon as she parked the car in its intended spot, overlooking the city view just outside the windshield. “Wow.”
Now Steve's face was
Tony rolled over until he could fling an arm over Rhodey’s legs, burying his face in his hip. “You don’t get it. You have boring alpha nips.”
“Did you meet them one by one?”
“I – what?”
“Right back at you, sweetheart.”
The vine around Tony's cock had made its way almost to the very tip of it, enveloping the entire length in winding green tendrils, and Steve's cock throbbed in sympathy, his own grip tightening in tandem. He started stroking himself, quickly realizing that he'd unconsciously mimicked the rhythm of the vines pushing into Tony's ass, squeezing at the tip on every other pass.
Tony nodded. "Those are acceptable terms." He ran his fingers along Steve's jawline, smirking when it made Steve shiver. "I reserve the right to sit on it ninety percent of that time."
“Ready?” Steve grunted and Tony nodded right as Steve lowered him down, his fingers clenching with every inch that was pushing inside him. Tony's mouth fell open at the stretch, his thighs trembling when they met Steve's and Steve was finally all the way inside, his cock stretching Tony open in the most satisfying way.
“But that's only after I vetted them.”
“No,” Steve said immediately, then bit his lips. “But it's... my body. When you woke up and – I smelled... it felt wrong. I don't know.”
“Sorry, I – wow. You're beautiful.”
“It's not that I don't
Tony retracted his teeth, completely out of breath as he kept nuzzling at Steve's throat. Steve whimpered with every touch, his whole body jerking when Tony licked his neck to suck up the last traces of Steve's blood. There was an overwhelming buzzing in Tony's ears that only seemed to get louder when he pulled Steve fully into his arms so he could –
He tugged at Steve’s shirt until Steve took the hint and pulled it off in one go, his eyes burning into Tony’s. The familiarity of Steve’s skin against his was enough to bring a lump to his throat, his heart beating so hard it almost hurt, like it was trying to meet Steve’s in the middle.
, today is a good day!"
good,” Steve said emphatically, slurring his words a little. Tony smiled.
And if the next morning he missed several meetings trying unsuccessfully to get Steve to let him leave the bed, well. Tony didn't have any complaints.
Steve laughed, pressing a kiss to Tony's nose before he reached for the shampoo and squeezed some into his hands. "Alright, fine. I'll keep it for the week. But after that it's coming off."
This 3
Steve closed his book with a sigh, propping himself up on the couch as he turned to face him. Tony put down his phone, catching the weird vibes Steve was giving off, almost like he was anxious about something. Which was weird, considering they were just spending a quiet afternoon together.
, Tony.“
Accused.
hard. We'll figure it out, yeah?”
He looked up when Pepper put a hand on his arm, prompting him to meet her serious gaze. “Look, I've seen how you are with him, okay? He makes you happy. And I think you could make him happy too. This doesn't have to be a bad thing.”
“And then Thompson, get this, pulls out a fucking
Tony dragged Steve's bottom lip between his teeth before he licked his way inside, grabbing the back of Steve's neck to pull him closer. Steve moaned into the kiss, and Tony jerked when he felt Steve's fingers digging through the pie until he found the right angle to hold his palm and create a tight space for both him and Tony to fuck into. Tony broke their kiss to look down at where his and Steve's cocks were sliding together, speeding up until he was rutting into the pie, his balls already aching as pressure built at the base of his cock.
Tony grimaced. “Yeah, you're gonna be on probation for a couple of years, I'm afraid.” Steve nodded in acceptance and Tony pulled him closer, hiding his smirk against Steve's cheek. “But you can stay at the Compound. Get ready to be my kept husband.”
His stomach tightened when one of Tony's hands crept up until it was just barely teasing to slip underneath the hem of his shirt, tracing the edge of his waistband. He could feel his muscles twitch with every caress, his cock jumping when Tony traced the dip near his left hipbone while his other hand scratched very lightly over Steve's crotch. Then dug in deeper, hard enough to make goosebumps break out all over Steve's arms.
The walk to the subway station was a haze through all the thoughts tumbling over each other in Steve's head, one more inappropriate than the other. He couldn't believe this was actually happening, his feet tapping a nervous rhythm as he stood on the platform, waiting for the subway to arrive.
No, Tony just felt – content. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt like this.
“No. I mean, well...” Tony shifted in his seat, a little uneasy at the way Dr. Yinsen kept looking at him. “It's not like it needs to be fun, right? I'm supposed to find an alpha, not make friends. And anyway, I –“
“I have an idea.” Tony looked up when Steve grabbed one of his hands in both of his, his thumbs rubbing circles into Tony's skin. “Let's start with the things we both agree on.”
“Well, they invited me to the goddamn factory,” Steve snapped. “And it’s mandatory because you didn’t pay for anything, and –
He'd barely made it through to the other side before Tony was tucking him back in and zipping up his pants, standing up to give him another kiss. Steve hummed, licking the taste of himself straight out of Tony's mouth, and Tony groaned.
“I'll get the quinjet ready,” Natasha said and Tony nodded at her as he joined Bucky and Steve's side while the others cleared the airport behind them.
Steve's mouth dropped open, but before he could move past his astonishment, Tony stepped up on the bed and started jumping on it in full view of the window, still completely naked.
Steve wasn't even looking at him, sitting at his desk and sifting through papers with an air of professional distance around him that made Tony think that it
“Welcome home, Tony.”
He wasn't really thinking of anything in particular, just enjoying the warm pressure of his hand while the water beat down on his back, hot enough to make his skin prickle pleasantly. It was something he did so regularly that it had become routine, not really affording him the time for indulgence or any particularly elaborate fantasy.
“Okay.” For a second Tony dared to hope that this would be it, that Steve would just drop it so he didn't have to exp– “Then why did you say... I mean, what did you mean?”
Later, when he cuddled up to the doll for the night, he told himself that starting tomorrow he would listen to Bucky's advice and actually try to go out and meet people. Reconnect with society the way he should've done months ago. He could absolutely do that.
“I'll be back here in two days,” he said loudly, and Tony came to a sudden halt, turning back to look at Steve with a cautious expression that barely hid the hope underneath. Steve nodded decisively. “I have to run some errands, but I should be here around noon. Just so you know.”
“Well done, Mr. Stark,” Steve said from what sounded like miles away as Tony tried to find his way back to himself after his soul had clearly left his body for a few moments. “You'll be feeling fatigue, perhaps a bit of soreness, but that's nothing out of the ordinary. Just relax and let your body recover from the paroxysm.”
“I just got my dick sucked! And I fucking loved it!”
Steve chuckled, drawing Tony into his arms as he pulled the blanket up over both of them. “That's my job, isn't it?”
“You gonna need more than this? Cause I'll probably be pretty useless for a while.”
It was so fucking good that Steve wanted it to go on forever, but he couldn't stop himself from coming, his mouth dropping open as the tension inside him became unbearable –
Shit.
The live button in the corner flicked from red to gray, and Tony lowered his arms, blowing a raspberry. “Holy shit. I can't believe we hit our goal.”
They kissed for what felt like ages, but Tony still made a noise of protest when Steve pulled away, turning onto his back and guiding Tony over to lay his head on his shoulder. It brought back memories of a thousand nights falling asleep just like this, comfortable enough that Tony couldn't even find the will to complain about Steve ending the kiss.
“I'll go where you point me, Captain America.”
“I missed you too, Tony.”
“It's okay if you don't believe that now. I have the rest of my life to prove to you that it's true, and I'll do it until you believe me.” Tony was openly crying now, but Steve just kept petting his hair, his other hand laying gently on top of his throbbing asscheeks, pouring even more heat into the fire. “But until then, you have to trust me when I say that you're a good man, Tony. Even if you don't think so yet. Just trust me.”
. Seventy-pounds-soaking-wet Steve. And sure, it wasn't like Steve had never been wanted, even
times, Tony, you shouldn't touch things that – wait, what – what's it doing now?”
fine if it puts you in danger,” Steve said sternly, his face hard. “How long have they been trying to get in touch with you?”
Tony took a shaky breath, his heart suddenly pounding. “I – I'm sorry.”
“I'm sweaty,” Tony deadpanned, but Steve only hummed, rolling them to the side until Tony was looking straight into Steve's twinkling eyes.
“I resent that,” Tony lied and Natasha gave him a shrewd look.
Very well. I will review the accords one more time at my own leisure. If they are approved you will be sent a signed copy by the end of the week. Thank you for your efforts.
The thought was terrifying.
“Oh god, Tony, I can't –“ His whole body was shaking, trying desperately to hold on. “I'm so close, Tony,
“Did anyone listen?” Tony averted his eyes and Steve sighed, running a hand across his face. “We can't leave them as they are. You know that.”
He ignored the camera shutters as he took his place on the podium, sitting down in front of the center microphone. Pepper gave the usual 'Please ask about this, don't ask about that' speech while Bucky found his seat and Tony waited until she was gone before he looked up at the crowd and smirked.
This time he managed not to flinch when Tony made a noise, but his neck still prickled uncomfortably. God, logically he knew it was okay now, that no one would arrest them for what they were doing – in the comfort of their own home no less – but still...
“You gonna fall asleep?”
“I... I don't know,” Tony said uneasily, trying to pry off a vine that was starting to creep underneath his shirt. “Uh... Okay, that's - wait -”
Tony shrugged, pulling out from under Obie's arm as soon as they got to their car. “I guess the treatment worked.”
Toni couldn't let herself think about that. “I don't know.”
“I guess so.” Steve's brow creased in a frown. “We're not buying a pie though.”
His main channel,
“You look like a cat,” Steve said amusedly, watching as Tony added some finishing touches to the nest, fluffing the pillows to his satisfaction before he perched on the biggest one, giving Steve an unimpressed look.
Tony hesitated for a moment before he took off his jacket, prompting Steve to do the same. He discreetly checked out the way Steve's arms moved as he was sliding the fabric off his shoulders and draping it over the couch. There was an understated grace to his movements that belied his small stature, and Tony found that he kind of liked it. It was rare that he was the bigger man – literally – in one of his sexual encounters.
That didn't make her feel much better, but if Steve had finally decided to have a heart to heart about their differences, who was she to deny him? “Alright.” Raising her voice, she said, “Sorry, boys. I'll join in next round. Gotta use the little girls' room.”
“Tony –“ Steve murmured, but Tony cut him off with a kiss, tangling his hands in Steve’s
“You get it, right?” Tony asked again, his tone sending shivers down Steve's spine. “Like this I wouldn't even have to pretend I'm not touching you in the backseat. Or under the table. Or in the restroom.”
, bright red. “I'd really like to take you out on a date. Get to know you better. If that, um.” He cleared his throat, eyes darting away for a second before he looked right back at her, painfully earnest. “If that's something you want.”
“It might be a mental disorder,” Obie said with a grim look on his face, his hand clenching painfully on Tony's shoulder. Tony struggled not to shrug it off, which he supposed was part of the reason why they were here. “My nephew's omega came down with one sometime after their joining too. Tony isn't bonded yet, but we've been looking for potential partners, and he keeps behaving... oddly.”
"Boo," Steve deadpanned, flinging his limbs out like a starfish, and Tony snorted.
Tony was beautiful, made even more so by the cocky smirk he wore as he laid back on the bed, spread his legs and crooked a finger at Steve. “Come here.”
“It almost sounds like you're opposed to his methods,” Dr. Yinsen said, and Tony blinked, biting the inside of his cheek. He hadn't meant to let that slip.
The entrance hall was just as impressive as the outside of the building, lined with expensive looking furniture and framed by long rows of elevators that lead to however many floors it had. Steve didn't even want to hazard a guess.

Well, that just made Steve angry. “You're not too much. Or too loud,” he said firmly, and Tony raised an eyebrow at him.
Tony liked to believe that Steve was a reasonable man. That he saw through complex patterns and abided by logic when someone presented it to him. That he knew Tony's limits and managed to respect them without ever making Tony feel like he was getting coddled or that Steve thought he couldn't take care of himself.
Charles sighed, crossing his arms as he tilted his head to the side. “It is a very old tradition. Perhaps Mr. Stark wasn't aware –“
Tony bit down on a curse before he took the plunge. “Yes.”
Tony pouted. “You don't even know what I was going to say.”
“I’m looking forward to it, Mr. Stark!” Steve called after him, and Mr. Stark turned back to give him a grin that made Steve feel a little weak in the knees.
Wanda turned to Bucky and, cool as a cucumber, said, “Your hair is stupid and those shirts make you look like a hobo.”
"Not a chance, mister."
“So what if I do? It's not like you didn't approach

Steve hummed. “Not like there’ll be much else going on.”
suit." Tony patted the armor's flank, lingering on the red and white stripes that trailed up its legs. The design was completely different from Steve's suit, but Tony couldn't resist sticking with the red, white and blue. "You like?"
Tony's head snapped up. “Mine!”
Tony blinked. “What, really?”
“No, I –“ Toni swallowed. “Fifty just – it feels different, okay? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't do this anymore.”
He didn't know what made him do it, only that he
“You haven't seen anything yet,” he rasped, watching Steve's eyes go dark with lust at the sound of his voice before he went back down, swallowing Steve's cock like he was born to do it. He pulled out all the stops, fluttering his tongue over the head, licking the shaft like a goddamn lollipop before he took it so deep that he felt tears prickling at the corners of his eyes.
Obviously he could’ve done without the impromptu heart surgery in a desert, but Tony could see the good that had come out of it. The arc was a constant reminder that he had changed, that he wasn’t the same man he was in his late thirties. Tony liked to drum his fingers across the glass surface and remember that he had fallen and rebuilt himself from the ground up. That he had come out on top and survived.
Tony paused but Bucky didn't turn to look at him.
Steve nodded, his eyelids fluttering when she pulled his hair again before he closed his eyes and licked a stripe from his finger all the way up to her clit, keeping his tongue broad and flat. She guided him with the hand in his hair as he slid his tongue up and down, dipping in between her folds and circling her clit as he got familiar with the terrain. She could practically see him cataloguing every tiny noise she made, which spots made her back arch and her thighs shake.
“Well, I'm gonna need to hear it one more –“
“I can do that,” he said huskily, so she took her hand away and let him try. It took a bit of trial and error until he found the right position, and when he pushed down Toni bit her lip, trying not to grimace too obviously.
“We're not married,” Steve said, a crooked smile stretching his lips. “I guess that means I'll have more time to spend with you, huh?”
The creature's back was turned to him, and Steve couldn't help the way his eyes slid down its shapely form, catching on the drops of water that glistened on its wet skin before they disappeared beneath its fur. It had a tail, small and stubby, that kept twitching in a way Steve would almost call cute, and its ears stood straight up from its head that was covered in the same dark hair that its legs were.
“This isn’t the way to the dog bed, is it?” Steve asked as the elevator opened and Tony snorted.
“Your sketchbook?” Tony scoffed. “What, did you write Steven Stark in a bunch of hearts? Fuck, that sounds terrible, now there's another reason –“
“You didn’t get around to that part?” Mr. Stark repeated slowly, and Steve’s face suddenly felt very hot.
Steve gave him a tense smile that dropped off his face as soon as he walked past Tony. “Thanks,” he said through what sounded like clenched teeth, and Tony followed him, equal parts confused and curious.
“Probably yours,” Steve said as he pushed the button to call the elevator. “I know that Rhodey keeps count of the gray hairs you give him.”
“You want to try it out?”
“It's my job,” Steve said, his voice a little more distant when he spoke to Obie, but when his eyes landed on Tony he gave him a quick smile. “Stay safe, Mr. Stark. And let us know if you feel any recurring symptoms.”
CRIM. CASE NO.
Still, Steve looked nothing short of awed when he touched them, gently, like he was afraid of hurting her. Toni grabbed his hands and made him squeeze down a little harder, showing him how she liked it, and he gasped, biting his bottom lip and looking almost a little embarrassed.
Tony lifted his head just enough to look at him. "Who's picking you up?"
Tony felt tears pricking at the corners of his eyes as he nodded frantically, humping against Steve so hard his thighs were starting to burn. “Wanna be good for you.”
Bucky grimaced. “Don’t ask.”
“You're so hard already,” Tony breathed. “Won't take me long to get you there, hm? You want to come in your pants?”
Tony groaned when Steve clenched down on reflex, and Tony's cock
Steve gave a tight, jerky nod as he shifted his weight, praying to god that nobody noticed how hard he was in his jeans. There weren't all that many people at the station, but if someone happened to look they'd definitely –
“I fucking love your mouth,” Tony sighed, and the words, spoken so brazenly, made heat rush straight to Steve's cock. “Wanna pick up where we left off?”
U.S. Department of State
His usual sponsors were slowly trickling in as Tony rolled around on the floor, letting the camera catch the way his lace harness draped over his ass. He'd chosen it on a whim, but apparently his donors liked it, judging by the usual slew of compliments that filled the chat. It made it easy to slip into the role of Dave, camboy and blowjob connoisseur.
Tony slammed the bottle onto the bar, making the glasses on it rattle as he whipped around towards Steve. “Don’t tell me what to do!”
And this time he couldn't even blame Fury for it.
Steve swallowed hard, briefly feeling the urge to hide from Tony's all too knowing gaze. But then he straightened his shoulders and tilted his chin up.
For a second Tony had no idea who the hell David was supposed to be. Then he blinked and put on his most charming grin, shaking Steve's hand. “Hey, Steve, nice to meet you. You can just call me Dave. That's more familiar, isn't it?”
So, since the other chapter was so short I thought I'd post this one right along with it. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy it <3
Steve rolled his eyes, but his smile was fond when he leaned down to kiss Tony, shifting just a tiny bit more to bring their hips together. They both groaned at the contact and Tony wasn’t embarrassed at all by how quickly he spread his legs to allow Steve closer, pulling them flush together.
It took a second for Tony to process the command, but as soon as he did he fumbled for the buttons of his shirt, ripping it up over his head and squirming out of his pants. Being naked when Steve was fully clothed never failed to send a thrill down his spine, and it didn't this time either. Tony sat back on his haunches, keeping his head lowered until Steve pulled him to his feet, patting his spread thighs.
“Guess that answers the question of what it wants,” Tony said, his voice a little strained, and Steve felt his nails dig painfully into his palms.
“Still got a couple years in me, platypus. As for you, don't think I didn't notice the grey hairs. You should do something about that.”
“No. I mean, yeah. I mean... are you...”
Tony cocked his head. “For what?”
“It’s okay,” Steve said again, but it didn’t ease the knot of guilt in Tony’s throat that was still threatening to choke him. “Just let it out. I’ll be here when you’re ready.”
“Oh no. You're not blowing me off with some golly gee whiz crap! Not me!”
“I’ve heard that before, yes.”

"I'm not going to keep the beard, Tony."
But she was done with all of that. And in light of everything it would be a miracle if Steve ever even thought about her like that. Steve probably saw her as some cranky, old hag who was put on the team just to cramp his style. Well, Toni would show him cranky if he ever questioned her integrity again. That shit stung in a way she didn't want to look too closely at.
Steve froze at the thought even as his skin tingled with anticipation. “I don't
Tony glanced over at the stool, broad enough that it might just be able to hold both of them with the pie in the middle. Steve followed his gaze, his eyes narrowing in thought before he nodded.
“The honor is mine, Mr Stark.” It didn't sound like it was. “I understand you are the Winter Soldier's chaperone.”
Steve opened his mouth to respond, but – huh.
“Oh,” Steve whimpered, and Tony caught him when Steve's knees suddenly buckled, his hands coming up to cling on to Tony with trembling fingers. “Oh my
“That might actually work. If I can't move, then I can't – I mean, you'd be safe. From me.”
Well, that was bullshit. “I meant it when I said I always want your opinion,” he said and Steve's eyes snapped up to his before they went impossibly soft.
Tony let him, mostly just leaning against the wall to keep himself upright as he watched Steve work, his ass really starting to ache now that his blood was flowing freely again. “Fuck, that really stings. You said salve?”
Steve gave a tearful scoff. “It was
“I believe I was talking to –“
Toni sighed, taking a sip of her vodka sour as she leaned back against the couch, crossing her legs to let the slit of her dress travel up her thigh. “You know, back in my day we did handstands and cartwheels balancing beer bottles. I'm not impressed.”
“It's nothing. I...” He laughed self-deprecatingly, bringing one hand up to wipe at his face. “It's stupid.”
“Can I ask why?”
have eyes.”
“You think five years is a long time?” Tony gave him a wry smile. “Try seven and a half. How pathetic are we, huh?”
“Are you done?” Toni asked in her best bored tone, and Clint toasted her.
“You’re really warm,” he said nonsensically, but Steve made a tiny noise and shifted so he was caging Tony in with his arms, tangling their legs together as he rolled on top of him.
“Fuck,” Tony said heartily, grabbing Steve's shoulders to pull him closer, need ratcheting up inside him like a tidal wave. “Oh my
He gasped, fucking into Steve's fist once, twice, thrice more before he tumbled over the edge, dragging his dick back and forth as Steve's hand milked his orgasm from him with hard strokes and an uneven rhythm. Tiny shocks of pleasure tingled up and down his spine as his cock throbbed with every pulse, pumping his come right into the pie – or what was left of it anyway. It looked more like a kindergarten art project than anything actually edible now.
“No!” Tony yelped, jerking forward to stop him – and groaning when the motion made him grind against the vibrating metal again, his cock sliding along its warm surface. His entire groin felt rubbed raw, sensitive and throbbing and – fuck, he didn't know if he could stand it. But he didn't want it to stop. “I'm still –“
“Fuck. You'll be the death of me.”
“Don't.” Steve nuzzled his neck, pressing a kiss just under Tony's jawline. “Stay.”
“Happy to be here,” Steve croaked, and Ms. Potts gave him another smile as she slid a piece of paper across the table.
“No, we don't. Three guesses why.”
Views really
“I'll call a cab,” Steve said under his breath, not too keen on anyone thinking he was talking to himself. “Then you can do whatever you –“
It was like a curtain had been lifted, and suddenly Toni could see the nervousness that Steve had somehow managed to hide from her all evening, his fingers fiddling with his tie as he cleared his throat and swallowed.
“Yeah?” Tony croaked, pressing his head back into the cushions when Steve did it again, flexing his thighs to push his cock all the way in. “Fuck. Just like that.”
“You're incredible,” Tony breathed, like he was in
“Yeah,” Tony breathed, and Steve pressed one more kiss to his back before he laid down next to Tony and pulled him into his chest, dragging a blanket up over them.
“You have a new message, Sir. Would you like me to play it?”
"And here we are," Mr. Stark said, stopping in the foyer to shake Steve's hand, putting his free hand on his shoulder. Steve had to suppress a shiver at the feeling of Mr. Stark's skin against his. "We'll call you as soon as we -"
“How are you feeling?” Steve eventually asked, and Tony considered that for a moment before he frowned.
He'd just have to push through this.
Avengers Compound, 102 E. Kent Street
“If Tony says that he can grant you amnesty, he can,” Steve said confidently and Lang looked star-struck for a moment before he nodded once.
“What can I say? I'm full of good ideas.” He chuckled, and she smirked. “So what can I do you for, Captain?”
Tony sighed heavily, pulling a bag of nachos out of the pantry. “I can gain that back no problem. You know that.”
“Oh,” Tony said, his voice small, and Steve shifted in his seat, biting his lip because seeing Tony so overwhelmed by pleasure, clearly having the time of his life, well...
“God damn it, Toni,” Steve snapped. “I know what people are going to say. I know, and I
“I'm not used to it, okay? Back in my day the best you could hope for was a quick fuck in a back alley behind the local bar, and we couldn't – I mean, it wasn't –“ He swallowed hard, his hands clenching into fists. “I know it's okay now, but back then... I mean...”
Steve looked a little discomfited, but before Tony could try to fix that they reached the pizza place, and Tony wisely let Steve enter first this time. He wasn't prepared for Steve to open the door, step aside and bow with a cheeky glint in his eye as he waved him through. “After you.”
“Have you looked at your socials anytime this past week? Because that looks like anything but under control.”
They arrived at their private lounge arm in arm, greeted by loud laughter as Clint tried to balance a beer bottle on the tip of his nose. He was actually succeeding, the asshole.
“Try to keep up.
of every part of him. He was writhing in ecstasy, his muscles spasming completely out of his control, and halfway through he started laughing, like a knot of tension that he hadn't even known was there suddenly released all at once.
“Yes, Steve?”
Tony grinned, throwing his arms wide and smirking at the look of surprise that quickly turned into awe on Steve’s face as FRIDAY came in with the dramatic reveal.
ecstatic!" Tony laughed. Steve could hear the sound of typing over the phone. "You should turn on the news tomorrow around four. Or hit up Twitter, whichever comes first."
, Steve. You'll need someone to take care of you if you end up rutting, you
Steve gulped, his fingers curling as they hesitated on their path down to where they ached to touch...
"Do I have to?" Steve asked, but at a stern look from Tony he sat up with a sigh and stretched his arms over his head in a way that clearly showed off his biceps, highlighting the contours of his abs. Tony's mouth went a little dry.
And the worst thing was that Steve seemed to know it too, always strutting around with no scent suppressors, stinking up the air with those alpha pheromones that made Tony’s skin itch. It took Tony a while, and more than one screaming match, to figure out that Steve actually didn’t know any better. Apparently the forties had been some kind of magical let-it-all-hang-out land where it was perfectly fine to flaunt your status like it was nothing.
He'd thought he'd lost this, the feeling of his body doing what it was made for, and knowing that he could still feel that way was a gift he never thought he'd be given. He looked up at Steve, his heart pounding at the soft look in Steve's eyes, like he knew exactly how much this meant to Tony. Maybe he did.
Best regards,
Tony smiled, grabbing Steve’s hand to run his thumb over his knuckles. “Don’t worry. I know just how to fix that.”
Steve smiled sadly, his hand coming up to run through Tony’s hair, and Tony leaned into the touch without thinking, though it didn’t calm the storm in his mind the way it usually did. “Thank you for telling me. I’m sorry you went through that tonight.”
Tony wanted to fuck his
with a squeeze to Steve's cock that made Steve bite down on his lip. “You better not come until we get there or this might get really awkward.”
Clint glared at him but there was something vulnerable underneath the bravado. “You promise that you can turn all of this around?”
But he had fun with Tony. He could talk to him for hours about everything and nothing and sometimes, when it was dark and Tony'd had a few glasses of wine, they would talk about MIT or Brooklyn in the forties, and it felt like Steve had finally found something that connected him to this new age, a reason to keep going. He couldn't imagine losing this.
Pepper slid the basket over to him, and Tony made a show of picking it up, rolling his back in a sinuous wave as he stood to walk over to the machine. He stuffed the tickets in – the drum was filled to bursting at this point – and closed it up with a definitive click.
“What?”
“So. Do you come here often?”
Tony had no idea how he got this lucky, but he was way too selfish not to hold on with white knuckles and try his best to earn it.
“Need you.” Steve sniffed his neck before he groaned and rubbed his entire face against Tony's bonding gland. “Fuck. You smell good.”
“Cause you're a fucking dick! And I don't like you!”
Then he
Since Afghanistan has signed the Sokovia Accords the unauthorized deployment of said aircraft will be dealt with in accordance with section 4, article 12, §8 and result in a warning. The UN wants to once again remind you that any and all mission-related transport must be registered at least four hours before take off, no exceptions.
"What?" Steve asked, still basking in the moment.
“Betrayed by my own brother,” Tony sighed dramatically, slumping into Steve's side as soon as they got in and the door closed behind them. “You still love me though, right?”
And then Tony came, screaming wordlessly as the plant milked him mercilessly, stroking his cock until he was a shivering, babbling mess, and Steve –

“Tony, are you –“
For a moment they let the silence linger between them before Tony chuckled. "You know what this reminds me of?"
“You, uh. You like baseball, right? Is that on? I mean, is a game on? Cause we could watch that if you want.”
Tony grabbed Steve's hair to tilt his neck further, pulling him close, and Steve followed without struggle, his body going lax under Tony's hands as Tony drank and drank, feeling a warmth tingling under his skin that he hadn't in
Clint opened his mouth, clearly about to make a crass remark, when Natasha stood up and led him away with a tight grip on his arm.
Tony seemed to have stopped struggling altogether, his fingers caressing the leaves with clear fascination. The plant was still stroking his chest, but now that Tony wasn't squirming away from the attention – well, it painted a very different picture altogether. Steve swallowed hard.
“Okay,” he said quietly, and before Tony could even begin to wonder about his subdued tone he was out like a light.
“No, not – not exactly
"Boo," Tony said and Steve shook his head with a laugh, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist to pull him in and press a kiss to his cheek.
He was headed straight home after a grocery run when the trodden down path next to the main road caught his eye. He tilted his head up into the rays of the midday sun and decided that today seemed like a nice day for a bath. Sure, he still had rainwater collected at home, but why waste valuable water when he knew there was a pond not even two miles from here.
“No! I mean – I’d like to get to know you. Over dinner. If you want.”
That's a very big if.
Steve frowned. “And what do they want with you?”
Steve never lasted long in rut, but Tony was still surprised when Steve's muscles locked up not even a full minute later, his cock jerking back and forth inside him as his knot swelled and tied them together, his breath hot enough to burn against Tony's neck.
He could really feel it now, the tight pull of his heat that was twisting his stomach until it burned like fire, gathering at the base of his cock and building up pressure in his balls. His fingers were clenching uncontrollably in Steve's hair, but Steve didn't seem to mind, judging by the deep groan he muffled against Tony's skin, making him shiver.
“I'd like to say I've never gotten that desperate, but it pays really well, so...” He shrugged, and Tony found that he didn't even have to force the chuckle that bubbled up in his throat.
To his embarrassment Tony could feel tears prickling at the corners of his eyes as he dropped his head onto Steve's shoulder and hugged him tight, letting Steve rub some of the tension out of his shoulders. He already felt pounds lighter than he had coming here and he couldn't help the small smile when Steve nuzzled the side of his neck. “That's my line, Cap.”
Steve looked around, his eyes catching on the way Natasha was leaning onto the table, her legs crossed and cleavage on full display as she hung on to Vision's every word. Which, as far as Steve could tell, were highly complicated ways of complimenting Bruce's skin and hands and – character? Whatever 'solivagant nature' was supposed to mean.
“Tony –“
“Just trust me.” Clint took his phone back before patting him on the shoulder as he left. “And I never say this, but don't use protection!”
"Yeah." Steve was panting against his chest now, lapping at the liquid that was still trickling from Tony's nipples in a way that made Tony's cock twitch. Steve's tongue caught on the swollen skin every once in a while, and Tony could hardly describe the sensation, so intense that it bordered on pain, raising the hair on the back of his neck at the same time as it made his balls draw up tight against his body.
. I –“ Steve huffed out a breath. “I don't even know why I'm crying.”
“No.” Steve was panting, his eyes drifting down Tony's body. “I need
“You, uh.” Steve cleared his throat, glancing up at him. “You said you liked the pie better, didn't you?”
It was weird. Usually Tony had a much better handle on this part of the whole thing, where he was supposed to thank his client for a good time and send them on their way. But with Steve... it just didn't feel right to end it without even –
“Oh –“ Steve's voice sounded lost for a split second before he make a small noise that was absolutely
“Want to go home. Yeah, you said that.” Bucky crossed his arms as he leaned back in his chair. “So. What would you have to do in order to go home at some point?”
“You know what to do. You just don't want to do it.”
“I’m so glad we found each other.”
, Bucky, what the hell?”
“Should be here for
Oh. Holy fuck.
Except it –
“I love you too.”
“Please,” Steve whined, and Tony quickly moved forward to tug Steve's boxers down his legs, cursing as they tangled around his thighs – before he said fuck it and grabbed the multitool out of his discarded pants from yesterday to cut them clean off. With Steve's legs spread across the bed like this he wouldn't have gotten them off anyway.
real, Snufflepuff, but I'll take 'out of this world'. Sounds about right, what to do you guys say?”
“Oooh, bold words,” Clint said, and Rhodey gave her a wink.
“Do you want me to help?” Steve asked, and Tony took a shaky breath, head jerking up and down in a nod. “I need to hear you say it, sweetheart.”
He flicked his tongue out against Steve's already swollen bottom lip, dragging it between his teeth for a second before he licked his way back inside Steve's mouth. His right hand slid down to stroke the side of Steve's neck where he could feel his pulse thundering under the skin, and he swore his own heartbeat rose to match it. Steve shivered at the touch, turning his head just enough to draw a line of kisses down Tony's jaw, and Tony held as still as he could even though he wanted squirm at the feeling of Steve's hot breath on his skin.
“It’s my choice. I just don’t want –“ Tony sighed, running a hand through his hair. “I’m just – done. I don’t want heat partners or comfort alphas or – whatever. I won’t need it anyway now that my heats are gone.”
The audience was dead silent when Bucky took a deep breath before he continued. “I've been training with Mr Stark and the rest of the Avengers for five months now and my therapeutic treatment has been thrice that. Trust me when I tell you that it wasn't easy and that it took me a long time to get to a point where I can confidently say that I have changed. That I'm not going to fall back into those old patterns.”
Tony bit back another argument as he nodded. “Okay. So what would you suggest?”
Steve was shouting something, but Tony couldn't make out the words over the ringing in his ears, his mind quieting down until there was only the beat of Steve's heart, pounding through him with every suck, leaving him breathless.
Tony felt his shoulders stiffen. “He is well cared for at the Avengers Compound.”
Toni groaned. “Do I have to go?”
Steve hummed, and Tony could feel his smile where Steve was still pressing tiny kisses all over his face. “I know.”
Fuck, Tony
He turned to her with a look that made her breathing hitch in her throat. “I
The reply took even longer this time.
He wrapped his arms around Tony's shoulders when Tony lifted him fully off the ground, walking a few steps backwards before he sat down and urged Steve to straddle him on what Steve only tangentially realized was the tree stump he'd put his clothes on earlier. He was much too distracted by how far he had to stretch his legs to fit them over Tony's thick thighs, feeling almost a little exposed until Tony dragged him closer and – oh.
Tony came so hard he almost threw out his back.
"You're staying."
Steve looked at him wordlessly for a long moment before he took a step back, leaning against the bar with crossed arms. Tony nodded to himself, picking up the bottle again –
And then he pulled down the doll’s pants just enough to get at the synthetic skin on its hip. He threw a leg over it, shifting closer until he could take his hand away and – oh. Fuck, okay, that
But then I was like, you know what? Fuck this and fuck wallowing, I’m gonna get back into it.
Fairport, NY 14450
he didn’t want to remember. And the fear remained that he was still that person, that he hadn't really held himself accountable and nothing had changed.
“Don't I always?” Tony joked and Steve smiled almost a little ruefully.
A bit of practical research showed that chances of Steve hugging him or spontaneously cuddling him in front of others went up by thirty-six percent when Tony was wearing soft clothing. The rate at which Steve started purring when Tony was massaging his temples increased exponentially with how soft of a touch he used. And that one time Tony wore a fluffy jacket Steve practically molded himself to his back, barely letting him out of his arms.
“What is it?” Steve asked, and Tony shrugged, grabbing two sheets of what looked like glass and putting his loot on the table.
Tony regarded the doctor curiously, honestly taken aback. He'd expected questions about his medical history, maybe even about the misbehavior that Obie had mentioned. Not this. “Um. Well, I got up. I showered. Met some alphas.” He shrugged. “That's basically it. And afterwards Obie dragged me here, so I haven't done anything else.”
Well, when he put it like that. “How much did it even cost?”
“Oh, come off it, Stark. We both know that you build weapons when they’re necessary.” The general grinned conspiringly, leaning uncomfortably close. “The Iron suit? That’s the most high-tech weapon on the planet right now. If you were to extend your research to our R&D department, even just the basics of it, we could -“
Steve chuckled, turning Tony around and walking him backwards into the spray, his hands sliding down to Tony's hips. Tony framed Steve's face in both hands to pull him forward into a kiss, not so subtly playing with the edges of his beard. Steve snorted, catching Tony's hands in both of his.
Steve shrugged, but Tony could see hints of a flush on his cheeks. “Is that a crime?”
,” Steve ground out through clenched teeth. “I'll – oh,
Steve breathed in heavily and Tony rubbed a slow circle into his back. Then kept going when Steve didn't stop him.
JAMES B. BARNES,
“Delete,” Tony cut him off with a frown. “Fucking bastards. You'd think they'd take a hint already.”
“If you think I can keep up with your freaky supersoldier stamina –“
“Tony,” Steve breathed and it seemed as though Tony wavered for a second, revealing something soft and vulnerable underneath his anger.
“What the –“ He shook his head, waving Steve forward. “Step out of the stall.”
“You just wait right here,” Tony said when they were finally both naked before he jogged over to one of the desks, digging around in its drawers until he emerged with a triumphant sound and a bottle of lube in his hand. Steve wasn't even surprised.
“Oh my god,” Steve groaned, and Tony gave a strangled laugh, reaching down to grip his cock and hopefully take the edge off. He must've underestimated just how keyed up he was because that simple touch alone made him thrust up into his own hand with a desperate whine that he couldn't even try to hold back.
He smiled when Steve made a choked noise behind him, right before twin thumps told him that Steve had successfully rolled out of bed. Tony dumped their clothes onto the bathroom floor before he stepped into the shower, sorting through the many bottles of body wash.
“Uh –“ Steve stammered but Tony cut in before he could talk himself into a tizzy.
“Yeah. Sorry.”
Steve looked like he was barely breathing, his eyes firmly fixed on Tony, and Tony basked in the attention as he slowly undid Steve's buttons and pulled down the zipper, giving him ample opportunity to stop him. He didn't.
So yeah, trying to get Steve to relax and enjoy things was an uphill battle in and of itself. But it just so happened that whenever they were lying in Tony's nest, sharing the afterglow... That was when Tony had his best chance to get Steve to let loose and indulge in a bit of tenderness.
want you to?” Tony asked teasingly and Steve shook his head with a rueful smile, plucking the lube from their bedside drawer.

Because Steve and he were

“That's not all of it, Tony. What happened before?”
And so it begins ;) Thanks for reading and I'll see you tomorrow <3
He ran his fingers through Steve’s hair as gently as he could, curling the strands around the tips of his fingers. It felt almost like silk, and Steve made a lovely noise as he turned his head to give him better access, so Tony kept going, petting Steve’s hair while his other hand rubbed circles into his back. He could still feel Steve’s hard cock in his ass, but it almost became an afterthought when Steve nuzzled his shoulder, his breathing hot against Tony’s skin. Tony hummed.
“Fuck,” was all Tony managed to say before his jaw clenched, his stomach tightening as all of his muscles tensed in anticipation. “Steve –“
“I like
Thank you, Mr. President. I've been looking forward to this call.
“What?”
WASHINGTON
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Tony shrugged, and Steve once again noticed just how well-built his back was, muscles shifting under smooth, tanned skin – He bit his lip.
“Yeah,” Tony said, a little surprised that Steve remembered that.
“So how on earth does that translate to you needing to stop seeing him?”
Steve raised an eyebrow, a smirk playing on his lips, and fuck, with the beard it looked - god
Your proposal for the Super– and Metahuman Accords has been approved by the Senate, I believe?
Tony tossed the towel in the hamper as he pulled his favorite robe off the hook by the mirror and draped it over his shoulders. He paused in pulling it shut when he caught Steve's eyes trailing down over his naked chest, and quickly decided to just let it gape open around his pecs. It wasn't like Pepper was going to be offended by the sight.
The last chapter is heeeeere! I can't believe it's over, but at the same time I can. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you enjoy the finale! <3
As they came closer he recognized the man sitting in the middle of the desk as Charles Winston, the vampire who ran the New York Council. Charles was actually a pretty well-known business man, CEO of Winston Enterprises, and Tony had known him long before he knew he was a vampire. He was pretty sure he'd complimented him on the fact that he never seemed to age at some point. The cheating bastard.
“So? You've been with alphas before.”
Tony had missed Steve’s voice more than he could say, but he found that he’d missed their comfortable silences just as much.
“Oh look, presents.” Tony picked up the basket, holding it tight to his chest. “Those are going right in here.” He opened the drum and poured the tickets in, making sure to drop a few so he could bend over to pick them up. “Ten gift coins for a ticket, boys. Who wants a chance to play with me?”
“Then say it. Say that you're a good man.”
“Oh, since like a week after Afghanistan.” Tony scoffed. “Bastards couldn't
She looked down to see his thighs trembling where he knelt, his hand digging into the skin right beside his cock like he was barely keeping himself from touching. His cock twitched when she looked at it, dark red and so hard that it looked almost painful, the vein on its underside throbbing in time with his heartbeat.

“You're insane,” Steve gasped out even though he could feel his cheeks straining with how hard he was grinning, and Tony laughed, stepping off the bed to wrap his arms around his waist.
He was very aware of how pathetic that was.

Steve almost choked on his tongue when it slipped
“I don't think it likes you,” Tony mused, trying to reach up and get a grip on the vines that kept his feet bound. “Try talking to it!”
Best regards,
“Relax. We'll be in and out, and then they'll leave you alone, okay?”
“Sorry,” Tony mumbled, soothing that spot on Steve's lip with his tongue, and Steve willed himself not to be too disappointed.
Steve smiled sheepishly, and it was so charming that Tony couldn't resist pressing a kiss to it. “Yeah. I know it's not... but it feels –“
“Hey, new blood.” Tony turned to see one of the vampires walk up to them with a giant grin that revealed his fangs. Real subtle. “First time, huh? Let me –“
But even if it wasn't, Steve was so firmly off limits that it wasn't even funny. For fuck's sake, he was
Dear Mr Secretary,
“Oh,” he said stupidly before need took over and he rutted against Steve, high on the relief that he'd finally done it, he could make Steve come –
“What happens when you get kicked in the balls?” Steve felt his face heat all the way down to his neck and Tony's eyes widened. “No fucking way.”
“We can also agree that Thaddeus Ross is an asshole.”
“So this is where you were.”
“Okay, so,” Tony said after Steve's breathing had finally evened out to normal. “You can totally say no, but do you want to talk about this a little more? So I can get a feeling for what you need?”
He rubbed his palm over his chest, grimacing as he turned back over onto his back, the fabric of his shirt clinging to his pecs, as if –
Tony froze. “Whoa whoa, wait, what? No, nothing's on offer here!”
“Duly noted.” Tony saluted, and she quirked a smile as she closed the door behind her, leaving them alone in the room. He barely had the time to say hello before Steve was already pulling him into his lap until Tony was straddling him, his hands tangling in Steve's hair.
“Steve.” He looked over at Bucky who was giving him a somber look. “It was just a joke, okay? If we made you feel bad –“
something about it.
“Very.” Clint clinked his bottle with Bucky's before he toasted Steve. “To us, boys.”

Tony narrowed his eyes. “You think I wanted this? I'd rather have had a choice too!”
No, what pissed her off about the number was something much more personal.

him, making unhappy little noises as he did.
“Fuck,” Steve said emphatically, and Tony giggled, feeling almost a little high on endorphins.

“Yeah, but I happen to know that you have a fine piece of ass at home.”

She froze when he grabbed her arms, stepping right into her space.
Steve carried the pie over to the couch, and Tony watched him arrange it on the stool, then rearrange it. When he reached out to turn the tray again, Tony tapped him on the shoulder.
“Ordering one of each, Sir.”
“Okay. Together.”
“Not that this isn't fascinating, but do you want to get to kissing before we both die of old a–“ His quip died on his tongue when Steve muffled it with his lips, hoisting Tony a little further into his lap until they were chest to chest, no space left in between. It never failed to delight Tony that with him perched on Steve's thighs like this they were at the perfect height to kiss without it being uncomfortable for either of them.
“What do you say we get this off, huh?”
Toni flipped him off. “I'm old, not deaf, asshole.” She looked up when someone sat down next to her, smiling when she saw it was Steve. “Hey, there, handsome. Having fun?”
“So. Pie-fucking. Thoughts?”
She'd probably thank herself in the long run.
Bucky rolled his shoulders. "They'll find a way. They always do."
“I'm gonna fuck you again.” Steve's hot breath along with the words sent shivers down Tony's spine, his cock jerking in Steve's hand. “Do you want to come now? Or do you want to hold out?”
Steve realized suddenly that he was whimpering under his breath, pushing up into Tony's touch, and Tony shushed him, wrapping Steve up tightly in his arms.
Tony hummed when one of Steve's hands slipped into his hair and pulled it back, baring his throat to Steve's hungry kisses, and Tony couldn't hold back a groan when Steve nipped and licked his way down the side of his neck. His eyes fell shut, hand clenching on Steve's shoulders as he let Steve suck a hickey just under his jaw, where it would look like nothing more than a shadow thrown by his beard. Tony felt that familiar thrill of a shared secret light him up with heat, thinking about how the next day nobody would suspect a thing, but Steve would take one look at him and
“Can I make it better?” Steve asked, and Toni looked down at him, at his eyes that were shining with the desperate need to please –
“What I need is you with decidedly less clothes on,” Tony said, and Steve's nostrils flared, his eyes getting a little darker as Tony took off his own shirt. Steve was already reaching for him with clear intent when Tony said, “I want to cuddle naked.”
“I know, baby,” Tony said soothingly, trying to keep calm because Jesus fuck, seeing Steve like this, already so out of control, was as arousing as it was terrifying. “You just need to do this one thing for me, okay, Steve? Then I can make you feel better.”
God, it felt like he was going to splinter apart.
“It would exempt him from the ritual, yes.” Ignacio didn't sound very happy about it. “But since he is not, I'm afraid we can't let you just –“
to be better. For you.”
Steve's eyes were closed, but Tony could feel him take a shaky breath as Tony pressed another chaste kiss to his lips.
“It's not about your experience,” Steve said hotly, his hands clenching into fists. “It's about how you look at me and don't just see the stars and stripes. It's about how you don't cut me any slack when other people do. You push me to be better and I – I
Tony flipped through the book, slowly at first, then more and more quickly when it became apparent that
“I know. It's Ross.” Bucky shook his head. “That guy is a pain in the ass, not gonna lie. But knowing what we know about Tony... do you really think he'd let Ross take advantage of you?”
It wasn't wearing a belt, so Steve shifted up on his knees and just pulled its pants down until the doll's cock sprang out, bouncing up against its stomach. It was big, not so big that it was intimidating, but still very generously endowed. Steve touched its cock, feeling utterly ridiculous for a moment until the weight and heft of it in his hand properly registered and he grabbed it tight, giving it a firm stroke. That was – something.
Tony was pretty sure he could've fallen asleep like that if Steve's obvious sniffing hadn't brought him back from his almost slumber. “What are you doing?”
So. It’s been over a month and some of you have probably wondered what the fuck happened that made me drop off the face of the earth. Well.
The obstruction of his military rank obviously didn't go unnoticed because the general's eyes flashed. “Having the technology to save thousands of lives at one's fingertips and not sharing it with the people you claim to fight for? Some would call that selfish.”
“I did say I recognize when someone isn't interested, didn't I?” Tony asked with hooded eyes. “For some reason I'm not feeling that from you.”
“Oh.” Tony felt his cheeks heat at the sudden reminder that Steve
“I, um.” He could feel Steve's throat bob against his shoulder as he swallowed, slowly pulling away. “If that's what you –“
“Okay.” She didn't look outwardly nervous but Tony could recognize the subtle signs. And to be fair, he could relate. This press conference could make or break the public perception of this trial. And Tony recognized a battlefield for what it was.
“You smell –“ Steve trailed off into a moan when Tony tightened around him, pushing back onto Steve's cock with as much strength as his sleep-softened limbs allowed.
“Really.” Steve looked so serious that Tony couldn't help but believe him. Well, that was –
Steve's mouth twisted unhappily, but he did lie down on the bed next to Tony with an air of abject misery. Tony scooted closer, and Steve stiffened for a second before he wrapped an arm around his shoulders, pulling him into his chest. The skin on skin contact made something in Tony purr with satisfaction. They were both only wearing boxers, since neither of them would want to waste much time on getting naked once they were in the moment.
“I, uh. I was thinking. Do you want to come in? I could make some coffee.”
