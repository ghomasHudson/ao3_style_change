“I’m cooking dinner and already let the kids know you’d be arriving soon, will you take too long? Harley was excited to show you something new he was working on, and Mary literally just stopped crying about missing you when I let her play around with my art utensils.”
” Jarvis said, tone flat, “
” F.R.I.D.A.Y. asked, to which Natasha simply shook her head while laughing.
Now, two months later and as the mission came to a wrap once Barnes and Wilson had managed to collect the needed intel and, as a bonus, they brought an end to a criminal faction which happened to be terrorizing the small city Steve, Nat and Wanda had chosen to act undercover. When Nat told him, Tony couldn’t help but laugh. Only their luck to send them to a place where they would finish two missions instead of one. It was almost too absurd, but also satisfying — after all, they had saved the double amount of lives Tony had expected them to, and all because he wanted Steve to grow a beard.
Tony choked out a sob, hiding his face further against Jarvis’ sleeping tunic. They had been caught by surprise in the middle of the night, so everyone gathered was wearing nothing but their sleepwear, much for Tony’s discomfort. He liked to sleep in the nude, which meant he was wearing absolutely nothing under his robes, and that was unnerving when you were surrounded by barbarians whose infamy involved plundering and sexual-assault.
Natasha smirked and hugged Carol closer, burying her face on her girlfriend’s hair and lovingly whispering, “Aye aye, captain.”
"4080"
"Great! Thor is kind of a God, so he doesn't count anyway," Tony beamed, taking a hold of one of Bruce's lab coat's sleeve and dragging him towards the elevator, "Time to figure this out."
try to use Tony against him, lest we want him to figure out the truth!”
“I’ve seen it,” Tony whisper confessed, “Your talk with Bruce… I— I was bored, and Fri said she had a few videos from a few years ago she thought I should check. At first I thought it was nothing much, but then I watched when you arrived at the compound after rescuing Vision, and your talk with Bruce,” he bit his bottom lip, feeling his face warm up as he grew flustered to keep going, “Is it true… that you stopped caring about how you looked?”
So, after picking up his daughter and covering her in kisses while Pepper cried and laughed watching the both of them, Tony focused on fixing himself up and getting his head back in the game. He had a company to earn back, a child to raise, and no matter what Howard said, Tony would
Tears rolled freely down Tony’s cheeks now. He just couldn’t believe this was happening. “I am your son, not him! And you are practically condemning me to a life of suffering!”
Tony was supposed to be having a good day. He had woken up in a great mood — despite the fact he went to bed at 3AM after having a particular ingenious breakthrough —, got a big breakfast, and once he left the house while bidding Mrs. Rosa farewell with a megawatt smile that had the old lady raising a brow at him while she vacuumed the floor, he was 100% sure today was meant to be a fantastic day filled with great surprises.
Steve stared at him with those round blue eyes, which seemed to spark with both uncertainty and excitement, "Not sure if you'd like it."
“No, I’m tired, which is a bummer, since I’m sure you could go for a few more rounds.” Tony pouted, opening his eyes and seeing Steve, who had laid by his side and was staring at him adoringly, “What?”
“You talk like you have any choice on the matter, Anthony.” His father mused, an eyebrow raised. Tony saw red.
? Holy
The Viking leader’s expression went from peaceful to thunderous in an instant, “So that’s why? You thought their king didn’t exist, that there wasn’t really anyone looking after my people? The people you slaughtered for nothing more than a ‘training exercise’ to your army?” The man stepped forward, towering over Howard and causing the king to cower in fear, “The women from my people were violated, their husbands stripped apart, their children burned alive while their pets roasted on spikes to feed your murderer’s bellies, and you are telling me,” he stepped even closer, furious blue eyes pining Howard in place and making him shiver, “they were murdered just because… you thought… I didn’t exist, and therefore, you found yourself in the right to allow innocent people to die?”
That was until Peter decided it would be absurdly smart to deal with the vulture guy by himself, and nearly got himself killed in the process.
Tony worried his lower lip. There is no way Steve meant Strange or the kid, seeing he didn’t know either that well back then, so unless any other avenger had gone into space after him, Steve had most likely referred to Tony, and he had no idea how that made him feel. Happy? Shocked? Fulfilled? Confused? Tony groaned. Arousal was somewhat easier to deal with since it was just a carnal desire, but
Tony had a hard time picturing anyone being able to pick on Mr. Muscles and leave the conflict unscathed, "People bullied you? I have a hard time believing that since," Tony gestured towards him, or more specifically, towards said muscles, "you know."
Tony, however, frowned. “What gave you that idea? Oh, maybe the fact I’m justifiably uncomfortable having to talk with a guy that vanished from my fucking life without even bothering to say goodbye? Yeah, that sounds like a good reason, maybe.” He spat out, causing Steve to flinch.
“Alright, we just recently became friends, so you’ll have to explain exactly what you meant with ‘
Tony felt himself chuckle. That boy truly was something else. "Now, Peter, why don't you go outside and let Mrs. Romanoff know of your future extracurricular activities? Maybe pass by the infirmary to check on your buddy Ned as well. I need to have a word with your father."
Steve beamed at him, and Tony praised his own self-control when somehow he didn't jump the man for the third time for the past ten minutes, "I guess I'll see you tomorrow then."
Mr. Rogers paused at that, just so a curious smile could tug at the corners of his lips, "I thought only friends were on a first name basis with you?"
“You would offer up your own child,” Tony heard King Steve say, voice low and grave, almost thunderous, “to save
Morgan big her lip, “The truth of why my daddy is sad all the time.”
Obadiah clenched his jaw, raising his eyes from the paper he had been reading as Tiberius sauntered inside his office as if he owned it. He huffed and glared at his business partner, “What have I told you about entering my personal office without knocking?” Obadiah snarled, being completely ignored by Tiberius as he plopped down one of the velvet carmesin chairs situated in front of the mahogany desk.
in a matter of hours or minutes, not to mention the whole legion of robots you made in order to give us vital support. Of all the things I’ve got to know about in this new reality, you were the most impressive of all of them - way beyond what I remember Howard being,” Tony let out another shuddering breath before the mention of his father, but
Tony smiled against the mattress, “Sounds like a wonderful excuse to skip work, actually. ‘Oh, sorry I didn’t show up. It’s just that Captain America kinda pounded me into the mattress and my legs were not that functional.’”
, Tony needed a moment. Not to mention that stupid beard that gave the man a deliciously feral—
times that I was doing what I could, and that the universe is an endless place so the probability of me finding you without at least a little hint would be practically nonexistent, and every single time we argued about it — because the damn stubborn-headed ass wouldn’t let up for a single moment.”
to find skin, touch starved as they were for each other due years of wait and patience. The feelings were so overwhelming that Tony was a panting mess in a matter of seconds, his mind a complete disarray of desire and anticipation — scrambled everywhere like the stars that seemed to shine underneath his trembling eyelids. Steve’s touches were hungry, demanding, borderline
“Alright, so let me try to be more specific,” she pinned Tony with a serious look, which had him perking up and promptly focusing on her, “When I arrived on earth for the first time due Fury’s distress call, Rogers was sporting this ‘hot’ look you are so over the moon about, and quite frankly? He looked like
Morgan stared at her expectant look for a second, and then she remembered.
, Steve is a handful when he’s away from Tony. You had to see how he was during those two years of their separation — absolutely
bad?”
He smashed the letter between his fingers and growled quietly. That damn weasel of a king had just set the hounds loose after him, the bastard. Tiberius better get through with his part of the deal and get Tony ready for the next part of the plan, because they say nobody has ever managed to escape the Captain and his vicious companions before, but well, Obadiah was nothing if not tenacious, and after coming this far, he was decided to be the first man to achieve the impossible feat of escaping the Howling Commandos’ deadly claws.
Now, Steve Rogers? That man was stubborn, loyal, and afraid of his mistakes like everyone else was, and while the truth would probably tarnish Cap’s renowned reputation if it ever came to light, Tony learned an important thing about the man he came to love and cherish.
Tony smiled lazily at that response, “Ah, so I’ve successfully corrupted Captain Rogers? I am so deeply sorry, America! What a heathen!”
Tony backed out slightly, allowing Steve to lie down on the bed and looked up at him while he remained propped on an elbow. “That bad huh.”
“I’ve known you long enough to understand how your mind works, and I also know you see yourself as expendable when others are at risk,” Steve explained as a guilty smile appeared on his lips, “And I made the mistake of not listening to you before; about the ‘suit of armor around the world’, or even trying to figure out the accords together. I made the mistake of keeping things from you that I had no right to, only because I was afraid, and look where these foolish mistakes got us.” Steve’s expression became forlorn, sorrowful, and Tony felt his heart clench inside his chest. “I wasn’t there when you needed me, we weren’t together as I promised we’d be, and if you had used those damn stones to save us at the cost of your life, I don’t—” his tone wavered, and he inhaled sharply, “If you had died that day, I don’t think I’d be able to live with myself,” he finally confessed, closing his eyes in what felt like surrender, “You have no idea how empty life feels without you in it.”
Rogers hesitated at that, which only served to perk up Tony's curiosity.
“Of course I do,” Steve whispered, capturing Tony’s kiss-swollen lips in another gentle yet searing kiss and then saying, “I’m not making any decision until I know the both of us agree to it,” he looked at Tony with so much determination that Tony felt himself gasp, “
Natasha smirked, “Honestly,” then walked by him, not before smacking his ass and causing him to yelp, “Go get him, tiger.”
But that meant he wasn't usually in contact with the parents of the kids, once Natasha was the one who always took care of that, so he didn't really get to meet the people who cared for the few brilliant children who happened to succeed in his rather difficult scholarship tests.
“Technically, I’m still 97.”
“Rogers has returned from his trip to the North, and it has come to my knowledge that he has already learned of the Stark Clan’s demise.”
Steve stopped and widened his eyes, “He
It was Obadiah’s turn to laugh in amusement, “Sorry to break it to you, my friend, but Captain Rogers is probably
Steve sighed, “I understand that you are angry-”
apart,” he nuzzled Tony’s palm again, seeming to seek absolvation from his sins through Tony’s touch, “I didn’t deserve any forgiveness, but I was so happy you were safe. That you weren’t gone, too.”
He turned his attention back to Peter, "With that said, I'll let you go with only a warning this time, but I don't want this to repeat itself, yes? You are one of my best students and I would rather if it you stayed that way."
There was a moment of silence, which Tony was endlessly grateful for, and then he heard Rogers getting onto his feet and walking. For a moment, Tony thought he was walking back from whence he came, but was proven wrong when the man stepped beside him and gazed in the same direction as him. “Men are fated to commit mistakes and learn from them, so what you did or not doesn’t matter now, what matters is how we fix it.” Tony finally brought himself to look towards him, who eventually did the same, “Nobody’s perfect, Tony.”
His legs failed him when Steve actually pressed him against the wall, but the big hands that were still holding his released their hold on them and proceeded to snake through his waist, pulling him flush against the wall of muscles that was Steve Rogers, traveling through the expanse of Tony's back from under his shirt and successfully making him melt.
“First, I’ll make him grow that beard back, because I need to see it in person.”
Tony blinked dazedly, sensing Steve stepping loser, "How so?"
“I know he wasn’t, and you probably had the best intentions in the world, but doesn’t erase what happened.”
“Pretty pleaaaase,” Morgan echoed.
“A hot hobo beard.” Tony corrected, but Carol ignored him.
favorite anymore.”
He pulled up his Stark Pad and started to check through it as JARVIS sent the results to him.
Steve scoffed, rounding the table and heading towards the hut’s exit, “Maybe not, but it doesn’t matter.”
"That sounds great," Steve agreed, suddenly hauling Tony onto his arms on a bridal carry and causing the engineer to yelp, "off we go then."
And move he did.
“-and a heart that knows how to do what’s right, no matter what.” Steve finished fondly, earning a pout from Tony, which he promptly kissed, “Give Queens another chance, love. Disobeying or not, he did great stopping the scavenger, even though we failed to give him the benefit of the doubt. We owe him that, you know?”
” the Captain pressed his lips together, slowly turning his head towards Bruce with a haunted look in his bright blue eyes that had Tony’s throat burning, “
━ ☆ ━
Maybe Natasha and Carol were right. They truly were absolute idiots.
"Is that so?" Steve softly asked, interlocking their fingers and gently pressing the pads of his fingers on the back of Tony's hand, practically swallowing it, "I disagree."
King Steven smiled, the smile small and reassuring, and Tony could only blink in confusion.
Which was good, because there was no way in hell Tony would manage to hold himself back tonight. Not when Steve Rogers was this damn good with his mouth.
Tony blinked, taken aback. “Why? He doesn’t look so bad—”
Tony couldn’t help himself, and ended up pulling him for another round of breathtaking kissing, which turned out frantic and overly enthusiastic since in less than a few seconds. Their hands were everywhere —
Now Steve's? Somehow managed to make Tony's hand look small and fucking dainty.
He felt a spasm, and he took that as his body vehemently protesting against the idea. Tony huffed. What wouldn’t he give to be 20 years younger.
Morgan then turned back to Mary, only to watch her mouth move and form the words:
"No need for that. I thought you said you didn't regret anything, Peter?" Tony smiled warmly at the boy, "Or you are going back on your word? True men never go back on their word."
“Yes, FRIDAY?”
Steve blushed - actually fucking
succeed, Tony,” Steve had eventually told him, earning a glare from Tony that gained nothing but an easy smile from the Captain. “And even though I’m not a fan of him getting himself into danger either, we can’t ignore the fact he does have in him what it takes to be a hero. I thought you had told him that if he wasn’t nothing without the suit he shouldn’t have it? Well,” Steve had stepped closer, “guess he proved to you that he, in fact, is quite a lot.”
Her daddy smiled softly, “That’s nice, kiddo. I was wondering when you’d finally find a friend.”
“YOU CAN’T DO THIS!” He heard himself scream through the panic, “IF YOU DO IT, YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN HIM.”
Holy fuck! Did Steve just
“Steve Rogers is a scary man, Tiberius, but he can get even worse when he is set on protecting someone, so no… we cannot try to use Tony and the stone against him right now and risk him figuring out the boy is still alive.” Obadiah released a shuddering breath, pouring himself some more of the scotch, “We must take advantage of his current state. Anger and grief will cloud his better judgement, so I’m pretty sure he is not thinking as clearly as he normally would, which means we might have a chance of escaping, but I have no doubt his focus will return to him once he finds out Tony is alive and in need of his protection.”
!” The captain praised, face flushed with how much she was laughing, “I know you said those two had a lot of pent up sexual frustration, but that’s
Smart kids were his favorite, however. They were easier to understand, and far easier to entertain for him in particular, so if Mary was anything like Peter, then he was more than inclined to help her out.
’. He remembers how the already broken Steve seemed to shatter even more at his outburst, but Tony didn’t care back then. He was too pained; too mad to see any reason, mainly because he had to hear that Pepper had been dusted away too. God, it had been too much. They hadn’t been together since they broke things off before Steve and Tony had their apocalyptical altercation, but Pepper was still one of Tony’s biggest treasured friends, and to hear she was gone, too? Because he had been an incompetent? Because
So, he decided to do what he did best: deflect.
Tony released an affronted noise, "I'm not the smallest! Natasha is much smaller than me!"
Tony felt another wave of irritation crash against him. '
“Steve, are we seriously rushing into battle like this?!” Bucky bellowed in concern as he watched Steve jump on Dodger’s back, “We don’t even have a plan of attack yet!”
” He growled, “
Tony wasn’t proud of how Steve Rogers turned out to be his weakness, but it was useless to deny the truth any longer, mainly seeing how stupidly fast his heart had gotten upon watching Steve being heartbroken about their separation and Tony never having used that damn phone that yeah, he carried everywhere because he had some masochist hope that one day Steve himself would make contact. Tony sighed.
"Since when do you lead anything?" Clint asked nonchalantly, resritng his feet on the marble coffee table while throwing the cushion up and down without a care in the world.
“Never been much of a cuddler, but,” Tony yawned, shuffling closer and burying his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, “you are ridiculously warm, so I’ll allow this once.”
news for you.”
but where she currently was. Morgan felt some interest unfurl inside her little heart.
The kids surrounding her all perked up and smiled happily at the idea of getting a new friend, but Morgan just pouted and sunk lower on her plush chair. She was hoping something awesome and out of the ordinary would finally happen to make her day less boring, but apparently she was wrong - it was just another new student who would probably ignore or make fun of her, so she failed to be as interested and excited as the rest of the class.
Bucky followed right behind him as they exited and started to walk through their camping site, earning the attention of the other members of their pack as they walked by, “The

"What?! You'll take the word of some poor kid over mine?! I pay your bills!"
Morgan gasped. That wasn’t true. Her daddy was a

are the boss here.”
Tony sighed in relief while Steve’s eyes became wide as saucers as he stared at the ring, then at Tony, then back at the ring and back at Tony again, “What…?”
“Fuck,” he groaned against Steve’s mouth, who hummed hungrily in response, “you’re so hot.”
"Your hand! Lift it up!" Tony ordered once more, lounging for his lab partner's hand and forcing him to raise it, palm open.
Because, clearly, for him? When it is about Steve Rogers, falling a second time could mean certain death.
Steve laughed heartily at that, and Tony felt the need to pat himself on the back for making the man laugh yet again. "Duly noted."
Peter whimpered again, and Tony was about to jump to his feet to tear the woman a new one, when a deep masculine voice beat him to it, "What did you just call my son?"
Steve sighed and shook his head in amusement, "Alright, what do you need us to do? And Barton, get your feet off the table and stop being a brat. This is not your floor."
“You are clearly not in your right mind, man. You haven’t said a thing ever since we left King Hammer’s kingdom, and you have this look that is honestly fuckin’ terrifying to look at.”
Tony’s heated thoughts halted, and he re-winded the footage.
and don’t get her wrong - Just like animals, Morgan actually
Tony had read about those people. They went by many names, but the one that stuck to his brain had been just one: Vikings. Powerful men and women, who pillaged and plundered as they saw fit. They were pagans who worshiped gods different from the Christian one he had grown learning about, and who seemed to really dislike the rival religion. He lost the count of how many times he overheard Howard and Obadiah discussing the attacks to monasteries or Christian communities in distant kingdoms, or how the Scandinavian pirates seemed to be causing a ruckus at the seas. Tony was pretty sure one of their ships had been attacked by Vikings once, and he remembers that Howard had a particularly nasty mood during those days, but it had been just once. Other than that, no barbarians had been seen around their kingdom, seeing they were strategically far from the North where the Norsemen seemed to reside in; but that no longer seems to be the case, and Tony hated Howard more than ever for dismissing his ideas that would help fortify the castle and better prepare their knights for any incoming threat.
Until…
“Don’t worry, I’m not going down until I make those two pay for what they’ve done.”
could be compared to her awesome daddy.
Jarvis jutted out his chin, “
With a poor concealed frown, Tony decided to be a bit daring and ask, "And why don't you have a job in natural security or something? You are a consecrated war veteran, aren't you?"
“I don’t get it.”
Tony released a watery, disbelieving chuckle, “You idiot,” he softly hit Steve’s chest, prompting Steve to pull him closer and hug him tight against his chest, causing Tony to sob at the crook of his neck, “you damn
The weeks after that passed by in a blur. Tony refused to leave his room, and only ate when Jarvis begged him to. He didn’t want to see the king, nor his royal adviser or his bastard of a son. He knew things were already being prepared for the royal wedding that would take place, but he wanted to have no part in it. Just the thought of it made him want to throw up, hence why he hardly bothered to eat. Who knows, maybe if he becomes ugly and thin, Tiberius won’t be so keen to this marriage. Jarvis obviously protested against such foolish plan, but Tony didn’t feel like he had other options. In a week’s time, he would be married to the bane of his existence, a man who would never treasure his genius or who he was, other than perhaps his body. A man who would probably seek other affairs when Tony became too used and his body wasn’t as satisfying and exciting as his younger body used to be. A man who would make his father’s already cruel reign even worst, and would never allow Tony to give any opinion about it. In a week’s time… his life would officially end, and he would do nothing but exist. In a week’s time… he would be as good as dead.
Clearly that was the last drop for the man, as he finally let go of his chivalry and snapped at the woman with a commanding tone Tony could easily picture him using on the battlefield, "You better stop being a damn hypocrite and stop calling my son that. He was merely reacting to your kid's bullying!"
"Of course I am champ, and I'm sorry I'm late." He finally looked away from the woman to focus on Peter — who was now staring up at him — and the way his furious expression morphed into one of unrelenting tranquility as he offered his son a breathtaking smile, which caused a sudden wave of something warmth and unexpected to crash against Tony and leave him momentarily breathless. "I needed to wait for your uncle to arrive so I could come."
“What? No!” Steve panicked, and Tony had to hold back the urge to laugh at his fumbling, “I didn’t mean to- no, no you were great, you still feel great, you are-” Steve trailed off while looking up at him, and Tony felt a pair of calloused hands travelling up his waist and under his shirt, sending small sparks of electricity through his body that momentarily dazed Tony. Steve continued to look at him, seeming at a loss of words, until he finally urged himself to speak again, sounding as parched as Tony felt, “You are beautiful.”
It didn't cross Tony's mind earlier in the lab once he had this stupid idea, but Steve was much bigger than him. Maybe not as much as Thor or Hulk, but his physique of carefully crafted muscles made Steve seem far bigger than he actually was, which had Tony swallowing in hesitancy as he moved his eyes from Steve's ridiculously blue gaze towards his large palm.
“I am
That sobered Tiberius up, “Wait, what? What do you mean?”
“I’d have scoured the entire galaxy to look for you if I had to,” Steve fervently vowed; the sheer determination sparkling inside his cerulean eyes causing every single cell inside Tony’s body to tremble, “And I’d only stop once I found you.”
"She sounds like an amazing woman."
“I won't put them up because I feel like the kid is embarrassed enough as it is, but judging by what I see in here," Tony looked down at his Stark Pad and frowned slightly at the amount of terrible results, "he just barely reaches the passing grades, even though my teachers are trained to understand each one of their student's specific difficulties and aid them through it. Even the most challenged kids grow in the environment my darling mother has planned for them," Tony raised his eyes to meet the Thompson's again, "which means that the lack of positive results from your boy for the past year can only mean he doesn't care enough and you are wasting both your time and money keeping him here."
Which was exactly why Tony had decided to, in fact, give Peter another chance - that chance being a free pass to the Avengers and a brand new and fairly indestructible suit to pair with it. When he had announced his idea, most Avengers had protested (Wilson and Barnes mainly, since apparently the kid had annoyed them greatly) but Steve only laughed and supported the ludicrous idea, which was all Tony needed, so he prepared everything and had Pepper setting up the press just outside the compound where he would walk out with Peter and announce to the world that Spider-Man had officially joined their ranks and would officially be under Captain America and Iron Man’s wings.
"The 'solves college math problems at the age of four' kind of special."
Tony blinked dazedly at Steve’s sultry tone, suddenly feeling helpless under the intense gaze. Between their arguments and fights, Tony never stopped to
Tony closed his eyes and felt the bitter taste of guilt souring his mouth. He had never considered how that entire situation had affected Bruce, struggling as he was, because there wasn’t really any time for him to ruminate on that. Then the snap happened and there was so much pain and grief and—
When Tony started this story of ‘putting an armour around the world’, he had no idea things would turn out this way. How could he know Ultron would become a murderous robot that would distort everything he said into world annihilation instead of salvation? It was beyond what Tony could have imagined happening, and yet here he was, inside a dusty room inside a barn at Clint’s family farm - which, by the way, he didn’t even know existed up to this point.
Inside the Iron Man suit he felt safer, taller, powerful... Now outside of it? There was just so much his charisma and masked smiles could keep away. He felt vulnerable as he looked, and he fucking hated it, hence why Bruce's attempt of a praise had set him off. The idea of the team — of
Tony held back a scoff. His personal Greek God slaved away while fixing dumb ass boats probably for dumb ass rich people like himself? Unacceptable.
“Or what?” Duncan actually smacked her with Mr. Fuzzy, earning a yelp from the little girl, “You’ll go cry to your daddy? I bet he don’t even have time to listen to your whining. He probably don’t even like you!”
"No," Peter growled, and Tony could see him balling his small hand into a fist, "but you will. " Then he landed a punch square on Flash's nose, which caused him to land on his ass and proceed to shriek in pain.
God, how wrong could he be?
Jarvis gasped at the same time the burly sentinel smiled deviously and strolled back into the room, yelling something that riled up the other Vikings. Jarvis quickened his step and forced Tony to do the same as they followed the Viking King out of the castle, but even in their haste, Tony was still able to hear it: the unmistakable noise of a massacre taking place, and Howard Stark’s screams echoing through the frigid walls of his iron castle until they ceased completely. Realization struck Tony, and his eyes widened in both horror and amazement. The king had killed Howard after all? But why? Hadn’t he been the price to even things out? And if he would kill Howard anyway, why he accepted to take Tony and the servants away before he gave the order?
Tony felt something ugly and possessive twist his insides, which was clearly stupid. He had just met the man.
they obey."
But then, one day Steve simply vanished without even a single goodbye, breaking not only his promise but also Tony’s heart.
, he hadn’t even seen Barnes and Wilson pass by. “Told you I’d make him look ravishing.” She said with a proud smile, while Wanda chuckled against her hand.
“A-are you kidding me,” Tony moaned, grabbing fistfulls of the sheets when Steve quickened the pace, “you smug bastard, where did that shy idiot go?”
Was that man
at it. His movements were balanced between intense and comforting in such a masterful way that had Tony falling apart faster than he would have, but that didn’t deter him from asking for more, to which Steve happily obliged, only changing positions and proceeding to make Tony scream his name into the night every time he made himself home.
Steve hummed in approval, returning to his task and taking his sweet time with Tony’s already sensitive nipple. He squirmed slightly as another low moan escaped his lips, and concern started to pool by his stomach along with excitement. Steve hadn’t even
“Nope,” Tony moved a hand to caress one of Steve’s flushed cheeks, “I’m sure ain’t.”
“Shouldn’t you change the order of your
“No sweetheart, that will be all. Thank you.”
Steve hummed in appreciation, returning his hand to Tony’s hip and massaging the spot slightly, “As you wish.”
Tony brought a hand to Steve’s stomach, allowing his touch to wander through the rock hard abs that moved with Steve’s erratic breathing and seemed to glisten with a sheen layer of sweat. It was one of the prettiest sights that ever graced his eyes, and he honestly couldn’t get enough of it. “Fuck, you’re so damn pretty it’s a damn crime. I should call the authorities on you.”
Tony smiled, gently grabbing her hand and placing a kiss on her knuckles, "Wouldn't dream of it."
“I- ok, wow.” Tony was almost shuddering with the fire currently burning within him, and his arousal was the most overwhelming he had ever felt in his entire life as Steve touched him
the offer to join the Avengers.

Perhaps things had started rocky between them, and maybe their path together hadn’t been the easiest, but if there was anything Tony was certain about, was that a love that survives through adversity, grows to be the strongest of them all — and he was more than happy he had found it with Steve.
"I just wanna see something!" He explained, flattening his own palm against Bruce's, who kept eyeing him quizzically. Tony's eyes narrowed for a moment, and after a few seconds of consideration, he removed his palm from Bruce's with a triumphant expression, "Aha! They are the same size, even though you are a few inches bigger than me, so you got no business calling me small, brucie-bear."
times. He wanted to call and yell at him that he was a damn coward, that he would never be forgiven, and that he could take that half-assed apology of his and shove it up where it hurts… but, at the end of the day, Tony never did it.
Tony’s self-deprecating thoughts balked, and he turned just in time to watch Steve Rogers climb up the rest of the stairs. The hell? Did his thoughts of the man actually summon him or something? Tony frowned. “Hey Cap. Something’s wrong?”
"Be a dear and display Peter's academic history ever since he made into the academy."
Steve stared away for a solid second before giving out a resigned sigh, “Of course I did. I still do, in fact. After all, who figured out how to navigate through time travel in only one night and basically saved the universe?” He asked softly, a charming smile sprouting on his lips and causing Tony’s heart to acquire an even faster pace as the man stepped forward and towards him, “You are amazing, Tony, so yeah… I have no doubt you are the best of us.”
“Thank you.”
America, and much for Peter’s utmost bewilderment,
Do you know the real reason why Pepper wasn’t at the party?” He inquired sullenly, to which Steve only shook his head negatively, “We had a fight. I was supposed to let this whole superhero gig go after what happened with the Mandarin, when she
Tony leaned down and sealed Steve’s lips with a quick, but chaste kiss, “Together.”
“Because it was!” Obadiah slammed a fist against the table, causing all of the objects on top of it to either jump or tremble, “She was onto me, that damn bitch, so she was certain to provide Howard and Tony their own loyal hound for protection! And this is why I had to act fast, lest I wanted my plans to be foiled before they could even begin.” He shook his head, trying to calm down his hammering heart.
hours, only to get back home and get beaten nearly to death by my grieving drunkard of a father, so if you are honestly thinking you can just walk back into my life and that I’ll gladly open my arms and accept you back, I have
,” he tugged at Steve’s beard again, “then I’d have had the courage to do something I’ve been wanting for a long time!”
and it took me
"I'm not happy about a fight having breaking out on my school, but I can understand why you lost your cool." Tony then moved his eyes to Mr. Rogers, "Besides, with such a cool superhero as your father, I'm sure it would be difficult to just sit around and do nothing while a friend of yours is in trouble."
” Steve said with a tone so defeated that Tony felt his heart constrict inside his chest, “
Howard continued yelling and being ignored for God knows how long before something actually happened—that something being the throne room’s gigantic wooden door swinging open to allow passage to an entourage of new Vikings Tony had yet to see, and that had Howard shutting up almost immediately.
the Starks are, and they were the most brilliant minds in all the realms, which means this loss was not only ours! Don’t you get it? They were ahead in the studies of medicine and everything else that might help our people evolve and acquire better living in future years, or even to win future battles! No other clan ever compared to them on the matter of knowledge and power, so tell me how exactly am I supposed to be calm about this?!”
When the Sokovia Accords happened, they fought and argued, but when Zemo came into the picture trying to use Bucky as a trump card to tear them apart, Steve reached Tony about it, and they fought Zemo; accords or no accords,
hands found the skin beneath his shirt, grabbing roughly at his waist and causing him to gasp into the kiss. The heated touch seemed to be too much for him to handle, and his knees failed him for good, but Steve’s firm grip was there to bring Tony up enough so he could lock his legs around the supersoldier’s narrow waist and be kept aloft as if he didn’t weigh more than a plume.
Tony was head over heels for her, since for the first time in five years, he was finally able to forget Steve. Which was why five years later when they figured out Darlene was pregnant, Tony was absolutely overwhelmed with joy. He was planning to propose to her, his father wasn’t being as terrible as he used to be, and things seemed to be going absolutely perfect in his life.
“Don’t be, it’s not your fault I can’t keep not even my relationships together.”
… And perhaps other things as well, if the opportunity came to pass. Tony smirked inwardly. Yes, he sure could offer that man
“I haven’t attacked any barbarian lands, whatever do you mean?!” Howard countered acidly, causing Tony’s heart to acquire a frantic rhythm. “My armies remain by my kingdom at all times! The only time anything of the like happened was when— when—”
” Steve chuckled humorlessly, “
Steve's eyes widened, "12 x 340?"
Peter whimpered on his seat, while Flash seemed all too smug as his mother continued to bark more biased nonsense at Tony. He breathed deeply and did his best to reign in his sudden need to kick both the woman and her stupid brat out of the room —
Her daddy stared at Mr. Steve in disbelief, then groaned loudly and rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand.
of him pressing against himself - and goodness gracious, he was big down there too.
me for supporting this crazy idea of yours if we mess this up.”
" and the line went dead.
Steve shot his son an unimpressed look, which had the teenager raising his hands in surrender, “Alright alright, I’m going,” he sighed, walking out of the spacious living that was their kitchen/living-room and towards the corridor which led to the bedrooms, asking as he went, “should I call the others?”
“No we don’t, and I know this is stupid, but I can’t afford to let Stane escape.” Steve argued frantically, earning yet another annoyed huff from his friend, “Come on Bucky, help me out here. I know you are just as angry as I am, they were your friends just as much as they were mine.”
. However, that wasn’t the most memorable thing about him, but yes that fact that yeah,
“That’s such a shame! I was hoping to get to know him before I take what is rightfully mine!” He whined, pouring himself a glass of scotch from the bottle sitting on top of the desk and taking a sip, smiling widely as he did, “Ah, now that’s the good stuff.”
“Hey,” Steve called, which caused Tony to turn towards him and see that Steve had rolled to the side, arm bent with his elbow on the bed while his cheek rested against his palm and he sported a warm smile that caused Tony’s heart to leap inside his chest.
“Of course I don’t
. "Why don't you bring her around for her to have a look at our school? Our grades range from preschool up to the senior year."
"Do you ever shut up?" Tony complained, removing his hand and huffing slightly, "Your hand is kinda bigger than mine, which is ridiculous. You are not that much bigger than me!"
"That's bullshit and you know it." Tony huffed, "I bet Barton is the same as me."
Mr. Rogers chuckled knowingly, "I'm well aware. I volunteer on a place that rescues street animals on the weekends, and I usually take him and my youngest."
Tony lunged for another kiss, “Shut it.”
“I’ll use my mouth, then.” Steve announced easily as he nipped at Tony’s collarbone, catching Tony by surprise yet again, “I want to taste you as well. All of you.”
"Wasn't that too a bit too harsh, though? I understand the boy was way out of line, but he's still just a kid."
hadn’t been by his side to help against Thanos? It was too
"I am very humbled by your offer, and grateful beyond what I can out into words that you are giving my kids this opportunity, but I have no way to pay you back. I'm merely a boat fixer."
Steve Rogers was not a common person, just as his kids were nowhere near common children. He had somehow managed to raise Peter and Mary by himself for who knows for how long, and Tony was sure that he would continue doing great even without his intervention, but there was something specific that drawned Tony to him, something even above all the overwhelming want that seemed to be gnawing at his insides and torturing his mind.
Peter practically glowed, “Really?!”
"Nat is a woman, Tony," Bruce rolled his eyes good naturedly, "and for the average female height she is quite tall. I meant between us guys."
Tony was everything but graceful as he took a too big of a swing of his whiskey and ended up choking himself.
All in a low, deep voice, that was honestly pushing Tony over the edge and giving him energy at the same time, which was great, since Tony was already at an age that keeping up with the insane stamina of a super soldier was basically impossible, but Steve was so damn delicious in every aspect that Tony kept pushing through since he just couldn’t have enough.
and some more, which eventually rendered the shocked man into a sobbing mess that needed Steve’s shoulder to cry on for the next hours they had before they set off to fight Ultron.
"Just something I've been hoping to do for awhile now, but never really had the courage to." He smiled bashfully, his beautifully ivory teeth barely showing, "Nat has been helping me out with it."
Steve considered him for a moment, and Tony could almost hear the gears inside his head working until his face lit up with understanding and Steve gaped at him, “Y-You mean…”
"You mean—" Tony breathlessly asked, the question lingering in the air. Steve nodded.
Mary shrugged, “15000”
“You’ll fix nothing, you idiot! I rather go to an early grave with my dignity intact rather than bow my head to these savages!”
"Tony, what—"
Peter widened his eyes at him, seeming as awed as his father was looking. "You are not mad?"
of the picture of perfection Howard used to go on and on about. Captain America was righteous, obedient and proper in every way, but Steve had already proven himself to be a handful, and a look where he didn’t seem as impeccable as he used to in his day-by-day was like the metaphorical nail on the coffin that Steve Rogers — super strength and famous moniker aside — was just a man. He was not a deity that was far from reach, and whom Tony would never be deserving of. He wasn’t perfect, and he made mistakes,
make that face at me, Rogers. We are not fourteen anymore, I won’t fall for that.”
and caused him to unconsciously buck against his hand, “F-fuck. Alright. Damn. Whatever you want.”
Realization seemed to struck Tiberius, and his eyes narrowed, “You set Rogers up so he wouldn’t be around during the attack to help?”
aware of Steve’s body, which was still glued on him since he hadn’t backed enough to actually release Tony from his embrace. The hard planes of his stomach, the sturdy chest that was far too broad to be fair, the power thighs that just happened to be brushing against his own. Tony hadn’t really noticed how close Steve had been, but now that he did, he didn’t really have the strength to fight the man’s hold. Something told him to back away, to put some space between them, but a bigger part of his mind successfully shut that little voice as it slapped Tony with the actual truth behind his fears and his actions, and Tony heard himself gasp when realization dawned on him.
Tony continued to stare at him, completely at a loss of words. How was that man even real? “Yes.” He granted breathlessly, earning one of the most beautiful smiles to ever grace that fucking planet. “Yes, you can.”
When he arrived, Howard had been waiting for him, much for his surprise and horror. He remembers getting the beating of a lifetime and being locked in his room for an entire week as punishment, but none of that had been more painful that calling Steve over and over again, and still getting absolutely no answer. After that week, Tony spent another two locked inside his room, sobbing in silence for what was left of his broken heart, phone clutched in his hands with Steve’s number shining on the screen.
“I did!” Tony immediately spoke, ignoring Jarvis’ continuous begging for him to not. He eventually pulled himself out of the servant’s arms and stepped forward, chin up, heart on his throat, “I did, and you know I’m right.”
we should be concerned about at the moment. He is a dangerous man, and his allegiance to Howard and Maria was the reason why I took so long to set this plan in motion, or do you think I had the Northern Kingdoms attacked for no reason?”
“Yep.”
plan a little bit?” Carol questioned with a raised brow and an amused smile.
"But I'm sure you are aware of this. After all, that's why my counselors and coordinators have monthly meetings with the parents to let them know how their kids are doing under our care and to update them of possible difficulties they may be facing. Some of these difficulties may become situations exactly like the one that happened today, which is why Mrs. Romanoff is so adamant that all parents should attend," he looked down at his Stark Pad again, feigning surprise, "ah, says here neither you or Mr. Thompson ever did. How curious," he shot her an unimpressed look through the lens of his glasses, "isn't it?"
“122,474447138 plus lots of other numbers,” Mary confidently answered, causing the woman to blink in shock and gawk at her for a moment, and then proceed to reach for the calculator sitting on her desk.
. It’s like it has always been, and yet, he couldn’t bring himself to find pathetic the need of pleasuring the man currently in his arms. “You can tell me later. Confess all of your crimes and ask for forgiveness if you want, but please,” he moved again, rubbing his aroused flush against Steve’s and causing him to grunt loudly against his lips, “let me make a sinner out of you tonight.”
you would never fucking leave my side, I opened myself to you like I never did to
"As you can see here, Peter lived up to our expectations when he was first admitted into our school through the Stark Scholarship program I've set in motion last year. The passing grade was 75 minimum, but since he scored nothing less than 98 points on a test considered quite difficult for children his age, we had high hopes he would thrive in our school, which he did." JARVIS kept showcasing each of Peter's grades on the different subjects of the school, and the lowest grade had been a B+ up until now, "Now, regarding your much privileged son who actually got to easily enter my school without the need of any aid since you are able to pay it, I fear that the results are far less impressive.”
Tony felt his insides melt at the man's concern that his son still got a lesson out of this. The way Peter behaved on a daily basis was already a clear sign of Mr. Rogers’ excellent parenting, but seeing the man doing it in person was even more satisfying than Tony could have imagined, since Tony's own references of parenthood turned out to be a distant cold asshole and a backstabbing treacherous snake.
Morgan was staring at the wailing boy, still trying to wrap her head around what has just happened, when she felt a poke on the side of her arm that had her turning to Mary, “Here,” she said, offering Mr. Fuzzy to Morgan, “This is yours.”
He might have resented the image of Captain America at some point in his life, but there was no denial that most of his life he idolized the guy and everything he stood for, and right now, said guy was holding him like his life depended on it and was regarding Tony with so much affection and understanding that his knees would have buckled if he wasn’t being held in place.
Steve sighed, “
a repulsor blast noise, "
“Sure was kid, and you passed,” Tony patted Peter’s shoulder lightly, trying to ignore how warm his heart became when the boy beamed at him at the affirmative, “now get outta here, and try not to do anything I would, yeah?”
it looked on him.
Steve fished his phone out of a pocket in his pants, "... Squared root of 267000?"
Tony released a breath he didn’t realize he was holding, and then felt some relief wash over him. So they
“We are running out of time.”
? Holy
with you two morons being slower than a turtle and a snail during a race, so tell me, what do you plan to do?”
” The viking leader answered without breaking a step, “
“Holy… shit…” Steve croaked out, while Tony continued to moan underneath him. “That was…”
Well, that was the plan, until Peter refused the suit
Mr. Rogers hugged his son back and smiled that warm smile of his, "That's alright, champion. Just see it doesn't happen again." Peter nodded against his father's shirt, then released him and darted for the door, quickly opening it and running out as his father called out after him, "And no running!"
“The others are fine, but I have the feeling that you aren’t.”
Peter's eyes went wide as saucers, "Daddy, you cursed!"
"Daddy!" Peter jumped out of his seat and crossed the room in an instant, tackling his father in a tight hug and hiding his face on the man's midsection. The guy didn't even move once his son collided against him, only lacing an arm around Peter's shoulders while he continued to glare daggers at Mrs. Thompson. "You're here!"
“You fucking disappeared, Steve. Didn’t answer a single call, not you, not even that buddy of yours. God, I tried calling your
“That was a test, right?” Peter had reluctantly asked, seeming unsure if he had made the right decision. Tony opened his mouth, ready to deny that and insist, when he remembered a certain pair of patient and wise blue eyes. He sighed.
“That’s what you barbarians are always after, is it not? Conquest? Well, I have the biggest conquest you’ll ever find right here! Don’t think I missed how you were looking at him earlier, Viking lord,” Howard sneered, grabbing Tony’s face and making him whimper, “Such a pretty face, do you know how many offers I got for the hand of this boy? Countless. Countless, I say!”
The man sagged on the chair, running a large hand through his face and that thick beard that was far too inviting to be fair. Upon further inspection, Tony noticed the black circles under his eyes and how truly exhausted he seemed. His life definitely wasn't the easiest; having a low income, possible mental issues by consequence of his days on the battlefield, and two remarkable children who needed twice as much attention and care than a common child did. Tony didn't need to know him well to see the man was in a desperate need for help, and he was more than willing to provide said help.
“If you boys are done kissing each other’s asses, we are ready to leave,” Sharon appeared on Steve’s side on top of her mount, a pearly white wolf with bright green eyes and a caramel muzzle, and gestured with her head towards the assembled team, “with enough incentive, the wolves can get to the Stark Clan lands way before sunrise.”
"Peter." He interrupted, successfully shutting up even Flash. "You know better than to let your emotions get the best of you."
“75+53?” Mrs. Romanoff tried again.
“128.” Mary answered in a beat.
“The same as yesterday, or do you honestly think he’d suddenly forgive and warm up to the men who anihilated his entire clan?” Obadiah questioned with an arched brow, earning a pout from Tiberius.
"It's fine, he's a good kid and his heart was in the right place, so I rather don't be too hard on him. And besides," he gestured for Mr. Rogers to sit down, which he promptly did, "It's not like caring for animals is anywhere near easy."
Tony nodded, and then started to look for another subject to address. He didn’t really have anything else to discuss with the man, but he still wanted to talk to him for a bit longer without any bitch ogling him or any innocent kid around. Call him an opportunist, but something told him that if he allowed Mr. Rogers to leave through that door without exchanging a few more words with the man and getting to know him better, he would regret it – and since Tony was already impulsive by nature, consequences be damned.
“I suppose not, honey.” Tony leaned down and sealed Steve’s lips with a chaste kiss, talking against his mouth as their breaths mingled together and he felt Steve hardening beneath him, “There’s nothing about you that doesn’t sound worth it.”
Tony couldn’t help but to bark out a laugh, “Nevermind, not worth your time.” He then proceeded to trace lines on the planes of Steve’s pecs, taking his sweet time as he felt the muscles under his touch tensing up slightly, “But… that means you have never been with anyone
"Come again?"
Pepper had been elated, and Peter was absolutely over the moon when she told him, since apparently he had been a big fan of Tony Stark’s inventions and frequently asked his aunty Pep when he would be able to meet the man. Needless to say that when they did, they immediately clicked, since Peter showed a rather smart and creative personality that impressed Tony. In less than a year, Tony was “dad” to Peter, and no matter what bullshit Howard said about the kid not being legitimate his or a Stark, Tony loved and cared for him the same way he did for Morgan. Not to mention Morgan
They stayed like that for awhile, with Tony enjoying the heat Steve’s body irradiated while feeling side inside his embrace. Steve was awfully silent, but Tony didn’t hear his breathing even out enough to signify he had fallen asleep. He wasn’t panting anymore, since they had some time to let their hearts calm down, but he still wasn’t asleep. In fact, Tony was pretty sure Steve’s muscles had grown tense, as the arms surrounding him tightened their hold, and he couldn’t help but to wonder what was going on inside the knucklehead’s mind that had him so tense after the blissful and intimate moment they shared.
” Bruce told Steve, voice oozing frustration, “
"Sure, big guy," Tony agreed softy, reaching for Steve's cheek and caressing it, feeling his heart do a flip as the smile on Steve's lips broadened beautifully and showcased his perfect teeth, "I have some secret Italian recipes my mama taught me, so we can prepare them and bundle up on the couch for a Star Wars marathon."
With his throat burning, Tony did his best to try and blink away the tears pooling by the corners of his eyes, but it was proving itself to be a difficult task. To think their separation had caused so much pain to Steve when Tony spent all those years being angry and sure that Steve had never cared about him, sure that his name probably didn’t even cross Steve’s mind.
regardless of the beat up Captain America suit and the black circles under his eyes. He looked like a damn street hobo in a way one would never expect Captain America look, and Tony was just so damn angry at the fact that the infuriating man managed to pull off that look and look drop-dead gorgeous in it.
He couldn’t believe this was happening. He couldn’t believe what he had just heard from the man he was currently crumbling within his embrace, and who was crumbling just the same as he held him. Tony had been so sure,
’ Steve? Jesus
. What a powerful name. "Alright then. Were you saying, Steve?"
. What the hell was wrong with him today? He used to be more controlled than this.
“Seeing how the last time your brain conjured our current enemy, yes, I would.”
"And now you are throwing punches at people as a way of communicating! This is exactly why I don't tell you these things."
“What do you want, new girl?” Duncan demanded as he scrunched up his nose, but Mary continued to glare at him.
“What- oh my GOD!”
“I-I c-couldn’t,” Steve choked out, clearly not being able to think clearly due Tony’s ministrations, “It moved a bit, y-yes, but I couldn’t lift… all the way…”
Tony’s lips, hungrily swallowing his moans like only a starved man would. It didn’t take long for them to become blissfully naked after that — mostly courtesy of a very desperate Steve, whose impatience ended up causing him to rip off most of Tony’s clothes in his haste to get to feel his body. Tony would have complained, but the display of power and desire had been so absurdly hot that he could do nothing but moan and kiss Steve with the same enthusiasm he would have kissed him back at Clint’s place after Steve ripped that log in half; Steve who was already making him see stars as he worked with his tongue and fingers across Tony’s body.
' almost roll out of his tongue, but he ended up going with something else instead, "you tell me."
Tony couldn’t afford that. Not when he had two children who depended on him to survive.
“S-Steve. Baby, wait- Oh god. Oh god.” Tony released another moan, this one particularly loud when Steve actually gently inserted a digit inside, “A-ah! Okay, I was not ready for that one.”
“438.”
Peter shot him a determined look, "I won't."
“Maria asked me not to,” Steve ground out, his tone shaky, “She warned me something didn’t feel right about this, that she had a bad feeling. I thought it was something about our safety, so of course I did nothing but assure her we would be fine, because of
“Alright, now, it’s time for math!” Mrs. Maximoff piped in, erasing the blackboard and starting to write down her numbers. After a few scribbles that resulted on a simple problem of how much is 5+5, she turned back at the class and asked, “So, who would like to give a try today?”
“Daddy!” Mary called out, causing both to look at them in surprise.
” bearded Steve ground out in that serious tone that send shivers of pleasure down Tony’s spine, “
When Thanos’ children invaded earth to demand the stones, Steve Rogers had snuck into the country out of a gut feeling, and was there to fight by Tony’s side against Ebony Maw and successfully keep Stephen Strange and the time stone from being abducted. They succeeded because they did it
“No, just… come with me.” He demanded briskly, taking a hold of Steve’s bare forearm — he had folded the damn sleeves up to his elbows, the heathen — and dragging him along.
Tiberius only nodded brusquely, turning around and hurrying out of the office. Obadiah’s smirk immediately disappeared, and his expression grew both anxious and annoyed as he looked down at the letter sitting on the table - the one he had been reading when Tiberius invited himself in. In it, a brief message written in messy handwriting read an ominous warning.
Tony gasped against Steve’s mouth, feeling his entire body lit up like a furnace that grew wilder at every touch. It took him a brief second to understand what was going on, but when he did, he didn’t hesitate to respond in kind, opening his mouth to give Steve’s tongue free access, which the man enthusiastically took advantage of, practically devouring Tony’s mouth and ripping little gasps and huffs from the engineer as his mouth was plundered by the seemingly starving soldier.
"L-liar!" Flash spoke up for the first time since Tony had arrived, "He's lying! I started nothing, he just attacked me!"
But Tony didn’t want to think about
Tony groaned and shoved a nearby —
'? Did she really go there?
He wanted to scream, he wanted to throw punches, he wanted to explode and cry and never even
Steve, who clearly had taken notice of his reaction, frowned slightly, “Tony? What is it?”
Tony winced as he looked at his approaching boyfriend, “Yeah, about that, he kinda left?”
, right? There’s no way. Sure there had been two years since they had broken things off in terrible terms, and Steve did send that half-assed apology in the form of a letter and a prehistoric phone, but… there’s no way Steve could have such a high opinion of him.
Bruce snorted, "Whatever you say, pal. You are the billionaire."
Mrs. Maximoff, in other hand, just arched up a perfect brow and asked with a smile, “Already knows, huh? Very well then sweetheart, would you mind telling me how much is 20+35?”
"Well, if it concerns you that much, I can request Mrs. Romanoff to designate Peter to do some extra time after class and tend to the school pets." The boy's face lit up like it Christmas morning, and Tony's smile widened in response, "They will be his to care as well in a year, so might as well start getting acquainted with the responsibility."
King Steven eventually scoffed, shaking his head and stepping back, “Enough. I will hear no more excuses. I was expecting the least that was an apology for those whose lives were taken, but you are capable of not even that, Iron King, so we are done here.” He announced, turning around and walking back to his group and giving Tony a clear view of the silver shield strapped to his back—slick, thin, shiny and with the same star shining in the middle. He marveled at the intricate runes carved into the metal and surrounding the star, wondering just who had been the creator of such a masterpiece, but his admiration was short lived, since the next words that came out of the king’s mouth caused Tony’s blood to freeze and his heart to stop, “Burn the place to the ground.”
"I've recently fired my bodyguard since he was a useless buffoon and almost got my personal driver hurt, which means the vacancy is currently open, so... " Tony trailed off, taking a sip of the whiskey he had eventually poured himself during his earlier conversation with Mrs. Thompson. "I think you'd do wonderfully at it, Mr. Veteran Soldier."
Tony almost scoffed. Was he serious right now? “Wow, guess my response to your kiss wasn’t as good as I expected. In my defense, my head wasn’t quite working right, so I declare my sloppiness justified.”
Grunting and refusing to entertain any further thoughts, Tony lunged forward and captured Steve's lips in a searing kiss, what seemed to surprise the captain, if the gasp Tony greedily swallowed was any indication. The kiss was messy for a moment as Steve gathered his bearings, but once he did, Tony couldn't help but to moan against his lips as Steve fought back for dominance and won, parting the seams of Tony's lips with his tongue and plundering the insides of his mouth with gusto, successfully taking all of Tony's breath away.
Steve chuckled, watery and rough, but just as beautiful, “I have to confess, I expected less insults whenever I confessed.”
Tony scoffed at that, turning back around to gaze at the stars, “Now we’re teammates huh?”
Tony actually chuckled at that and looked away, “Yeah, right, almost had me fooled there, spangles.”
Tony honestly didn’t remember the last time he felt such an amount of overwhelming pleasure in his life, but it was being difficult to stay on his knees as Steve thrusted in and out in a languid pace that was nothing short of torture. His mind blanked out every single stroke, and he felt himself contract against Steve whenever he made himself at home inside, causing the man to grunt and growl like an animal and successfully spike up Tony’s overwhelming arousal. “F-faster,” he requested in between strangled moans, “Faster, S-Steve.”
Steve took his sweet time pleasuring and worshiping Tony in a way he had never experienced before. He had no idea for how long Steve did it, but by the time Steve was sliding into him in order to connect their bodies as one, Tony could no longer hold back his moans, and he could only mentally pat himself on the back for having made the room walls soundproof.
, Tony.” Steve vowed, his voice so firm and certain that Tony found himself believing in it, “I’ll be by your side from now on, in
Tiberius Stane, the son of Obadiah Stane—Howard’s most trusted royal adviser—was a man of easy smiles and awe-worthy politeness. For those who didn’t know better, he was nothing but the loyal and easy-going right arm of King Howard Stark—but Tony, of course, knew better. Tiberius was a man of a thousand faces, which he seemed to have inherited from his father, and his charming personality was nothing but a facade of his true intentions. True vile and twisted intentions, if the malicious looks he always directed Tony were any indication. A wolf wearing sheep-skin, and the King—a man so proud of his intellect and abnormal intelligence—seemed to fail to notice how his most trusted adviser and right hand were nothing but snakes that slithered around and seemingly waited for the right moment to pounce.
He smiled back, “Yeah?”
?! Tony didn’t remember EVER being thanked for willingly giving head, even though he was pretty sure he always did a great job, but Steve was just so genuine and absolutely
"So?" Steve's gentle voice pulled him back to reality, causing Tony to blink confusedly at his smiling face, "What is your veredict?"
"It's about respect, Rogers! Respect!" Tony rebuked, gesturing wildly, "How am I supposed to lead this peanut gallery with you if they don't even respect me!"
of polishing before that could happen. The kid had the brains, the brawn, and the heroics to become a pretty great addition to their team, but Peter was still, well,
He shrugged, "See it as me making it up to you, since my school promises the safety of our students and we failed to deliver that to Peter and his friend today. I should have expelled that boy when my assistant first told me about his first transgression."
"Put your hand up." Tony suddenly demanded, causing Bruce to arch a brow.
Mary, who suddenly jumped out of the swing and took her hand, walking away pulling her along, “Come.”
“Let me make love to you, please,” he begged breathlessly, thrusting lightly against Tony’s thigh and sending an electric spark towards his own erection, which made him whimper in delight, “I’ve been wanting you for so,
while tearing that log in half back in 2015, he would have done way more than just stare and lick his lips.

“You’ll love it, don’t worry.” Tony reassured while fumbling with the rim of Steve’s pants, which instantly had the man sitting up and holding his hands.
sorry, that I let you down.”
“Tony, I- Listen...” Steve ran a frustrated hand through his hair, messing it up quite a bit, “I know what I did was unforgivable, and I understand if you don’t wish to forgive me, but please, just give me a chance to try and make this right,” he inhaled sharply, “you have no idea how much I missed you, and how much I wanted to reach us for us to talk again, but I just
That had been the last blow, and before Tony knew, he had completely crumbled inside Steve’s arms, needing to be carried to the medicinal aisle of the compound so his debilitated condition could be taken care of.

of it and without thinking twice pushed Duncan
Rage and sorrow boiled Tony’s insides in a way that made him dizzy, and if weren’t for Jarvis’ arms firmly pulling him into a tight hug, he was pretty sure he would have disgracefully collapsed. Jarvis rocked them back and forth in a desperate attempt to comfort his prince, while glaring at his king in a way that if looks could kill, then Howard would have probably dropped dead right then. If the king noticed the act of defiance, however, he didn’t pay any mind to it, turning around once more to yell again at the Vikings and demand to see their leader.
“Wow, you really must hate me.” Steve’s weak chuckle startled him back to reality, having him look towards the man, who had a sorrowful look in his eyes as he watched their girls on the playground’s swings.
Steve hummed in agreement, coming to a stop next to Tony once they reached the door, "I'll be sure to bring her. Should I look for Mrs. Romanoff again?"
, and Tony simply couldn’t believe he was the one at the end of the soldier’s intense desire.
“Not that I want to interrupt our mighty leaders’ from biting each other’s heads off, but already interrupting,” Sam’s voice cut in, getting two pairs of fiery blue eyes to glare daggers at him and cause him to raise his hands in surrender, “No need to take a bite of mine as well, I just wanted to relay some important info I got ahold of.”
’, so I’ll repeat, and you better answer me this time: What. Do. You. Plan. To. Do?”
Steve placed one of his big hands on Tony's left shoulder and gave it a light squeeze before smiling at him one last time and finally opening the door to leave. The touch sent a spark of electricity throught all of Tony’s body, and he felt the need to ask Steve to wait; to try and come up with another reason for them to spend more together that day,
Sure, his family was everything but conventional and his white picket-fence house turned out to be a luxurious penthouse on top of one of the most expensive buildings in New York, but he had already come in terms with that "little" details by now. Tony sure didn’t rest until he did, which was adorable, even though the engineer absolutely hated when Steve used said adjective to describe him. Mary was his little partner in crime on the matter, since when

Peter shot his father a hopeful look, and Mr. Rogers quirked up a brow at the offer. Tony knew it was more of a prize than a punishment, but he wasn't really that inclined to actually punish the boy, so this would do.
The girls cheered and threw their little fists in the air, triumph clear in their faces while Morgan’s daddy laughed and Mr. Steve stared at him, dazzling smile on his lips as he looked at Morgan’s daddy like he was the most breathtaking sight he had ever laid eyes on.
without considering the consequences, then you definitely are not fucking fit to lead this damn team anywhere!”
This is
Howard rolled his eyes, focusing back on his scrolls, “Spare me of your theatrics, Anthony. It’s just marriage, not the end of the world. And besides, I’m sure Tiberius will become quite reasonable as long as you keep him satisfied. It’s come to my knowledge he fancies you and your useless petite body for some reason, so might as well indulge his needs since you are not good for much else.”
“Don’t worry, just follow my lead.”
were being mean to her, so you deserved it!” She yelled back, causing the boy to cry even louder.
The war was brutal once the armies clashed, and the battle would make into history books as the day life on earth as it was almost ended, but thanks to the overpowering conjoined leadership of Iron Man and Captain America, Thanos’ forces had no option but to retreat once their leader was overwhelmed by earth’s mightiest heroes, and as the Titan was defeated and his head rolled, a message was sent to all the other worlds out there: think twice before attempting an attack on earth.
A sharp inhale was what slipped out of his mouth next.
"Mr. St— Tony," Steve quickly corrected himself at Tony's frown, "That's very kind of you, but I can't possibly ask of you this kind of assistance. Mary can be a handful, and I really would rather if she could have a touch of normalcy in her life. Her grandmother already—"
"Mr. Stark—"
"C'mon Pete, it's not worth it..." Ned tried to intervene, only to have Flash pushing him off his seat with unnecessary brutality.
“Will you just stand the fuck down and listen instead of keep interrupting me?!” Obadiah ground out, his patience wearing thin, “He
A HD image of Steve was plastered on it, but that didn’t happen to be the most striking fact. No, what had Tony freezing the footage to stare, was the fact that one Steven Grant Rogers had been sporting
“J, where…” he asked breathlessly, “where are they…?”
If Tony thought the others had presence, then he knew absolutely nothing. This man’s presence was so overpowering he silenced the entire room in a way that if a needle fell, Tony would be able to hear it hitting the ground. His expression was solemn, unconcerned, and his bright blue eyes scanned the occupants room in such a thorough way that Tony felt himself shiver in fear. His hair was dark blond, longer than the brunette’s but shorter than the redhead’s, and with less braids, which allowed it to fall freely and beautifully against his armored shoulders with a grace nobody would expect from a barbarian. He had a full beard, differently from his other male companions whose beards were thinner, and had a pure white fur cape strapped to his shoulders. There was a star in the middle of his chest armor, which was clearly the work of a highly skilled smith if the intricate details in the metal were any indication. It looked sturdy, almost… impenetrable, and Tony couldn’t help but to be impressed. He had heard pagans were nothing but filthy brutes who knew nothing other than to kill and take, but if that was the case… then how were they able to create such amazing pieces? The weapons were just as impressive, after all. Even more than the ones the Stark clan manufactured.
“L-like I said. I’m a talker.”
A hand rose into the air, and then Morgan heard Mary answer, “10”
He looked up in order to ask Jarvis, but his words died at the tip of his tongue once he saw the horrified expression in the servant’s pale face. His eyes were wide and focused on King Steven, and now that Tony had stopped to notice, Jarvis arms were shivering around him. “J…?” He hesitantly asked, but Jarvis didn’t even blink. He looked like he was seeing a ghost. “J, what is it?”
Tony laughed, “
She smirked in satisfaction as Tony released her hand and moved to Barton, who was eyeing him suspiciously, "You won't kiss my hand too, right?"
Carol released an indignant noise, “Me, related to that knucklehead? God
“But I haven’t,” Steve argued softly, caressing Tony’s face in such a tender way that Tony felt like he was about to melt into the mattress, “And I’ll never stop trying to make it up to you. You deserve that much.”
“I know! It’s just… you had to see him, Steve. All righteous and adorable and talking about learning lessons and how he needs to grow himself before he could join us,” Tony pouted before Steve’s annoyed expression, “Couldn’t force him. Didn’t have it in me, and besides,” Tony’s pout merged into a smirk, “he sounded much like you, even asked if he could meet you.” And he sighed dramatically, “Guess I’m not his
Peter seemed regretful as well, "Yeah... I'm sorry for causing trouble, Mr. Stark."
"I have the feeling that we will get along just fine, Steve." Tony pointed out once he regained some of his dignity, getting up from his chair and prompting Steve to do the same. He started to walk towards the door, and Steve followed suit. "I'll have my personal assistant contact you about the job, but I'd like you to bring little Mary tomorrow once you come to drop off Peter. I'd like to meet her as soon as possible."
If Tony’s smile could widen more, it would have. Of course Mr. Perfect volunteered to care for rescues. "Ah, so he will already be somewhat familiar with some of the care. Good, but we have everything from chinchillas to horses, so I wouldn't worry about him getting bored."
A chorus of ‘No!’ and ‘We’ll follow anywhere, Captain!’ were the answers he got, and Steve couldn’t help but smile widely in response. It never ceased to amaze him how loyal the Commandos were. Most days he didn’t feel like he deserved such loyalty, mainly now that he was practically leading them into death’s jaws, but there was no doubt he was more than grateful to have them, and he would do his best to keep them safe through this madness.
“Hush,” Tony ordered, capturing his lips one more time and nipping at his lower lip, “something is keeping you from being truly worthy, Captain America? Is it the bad side you said I haven’t seen yet?”
Flash visibly gulped but still didn't respond, looking up to his mom in a clear request for help, but her attention wasn't on him. Tony quirked up a brow at the distracted woman, who was ogling Peter's dad just as bad as Tony had been. Worst, even.
is that possible?!”
He thought amusedly. He had been a possessive mess earlier, but now he couldn't quite blame her. His train of thought was all over the place as well.
Tony nodded, “Yes.”
TW: Asshole parents being mean to children and annoying the living shit out of everyone -.-
,” he suddenly ordered, causing the Vikings to stop and look at him in confusion, just like his group of advisers, “Who said that?”
Tender blues that held him captive, tender blues that looked at him like he meant something.
Tony stepped in, however, "In a jungle, perhaps, but this is a school and the students are meant to behave themselves and respect each other. If you don't see an issue with how your son acted, then it's clear he is not the only problem here."
"I honestly cannot believe you," Tony muttered, eyes softening like they never had before. To think Steve was going through all this trouble to impress him, actually planning a whole evening where he would confess and—
"Yeah, she was" Tony's smile faltered slightly and he tried to keep the sorrow from his tone, but if Mr. Rogers noticed it, he didn't show. "But enough about me and my family, it's yours we need to address. You see, my scholarship program is still a work in progress and I plan to expand it in the future, but the Elementary grade will have a different approach. I'm still working on it, but I'd love little Mary to be one of my first students to enter via the Elementary Scholarship program, just like her older brother."
Steve chuckled sensually and leaned down to nibble at Tony’s earlobe, only to say, “He got knocked out after you came so beautifully while calling his name.”
Bucky clenched his jaw, “And we
“I suppose…”
There was a pregnant pause, and Tony felt his eyes water as he witnessed just how distressed Steve had been. God, he had no idea, and the way he had yelled at Steve when they met after everything that had happened…
“Please, just answer.” Tony pressed on, feeling anxious as his courage started to fade away.
to me. And I’m sorry,” Steve choked up, gluing their foreheads together, “I’m sorry…

Not the kicked puppy look.
." Answered JARVIS' disembodied voice, causing the Thompson's to jump and the Parkers to look around confusedly. Soon the television flickered to life and started to show the high quality footage of the cafeteria, which had been crowded with students having their meals of the day. "
Well, the sight of Steve covered in motor oil and sweat sure sounded more than acceptable, but the rest didn't.
Carol grinned, “Tony is my friend, and Rogers may be a royal pain in the ass sometimes, but I like him. Besides,” she climbed up to kiss Natasha gently on her lips, “their happiness is your happiness, so there is no way I would just stand by and do nothing seeing how frustrated you were getting at those two butting heads.”
“Promise?” Tony choked up against Steve’s neck, and the loving embrace grew comfortingly tighter.
him - and shit, did it feel good to be cherished like this.
numbers, since her daddy just had this magic way of making
She offered Mary a small, grateful smile, “Thank you so much…”
“Definitely,” Tony agreed as he finally managed to open the pesky piece of fabric to run a hand over Steve’s sculpted abs and torso. He backed away slightly, and Tony couldn’t help but smile softly as their gazes met, “You always pack the best surprises, Cap.”
Tony felt the need to get up from the bed and go outside to run around and scream like a madman. Steve was so damn adorable, what the
Tony shivered, the sparks from that simple touch of Steve’s lips causing his entire body to react, “Yeah.” He agreed, breathlessly, mindful of the way Steve’s other hand was tight against his hip.
Suddenly, Tony completely forgot what he was even doing there as he was held captive by Steve's eyes. It wasn't fair, really. Tony was sure he had gotten over this stupid child crush he had developed for Captain America when he was a kid — Howard's obsession with the man helping to stomp down those feelings fairly easily as admiration morphed into hatred — but again, this wasn't quite Captain America who was looking at him with affection and as if he was something worth admiring, was it?
” Bruce assured him, and Steve pressed his lips together in a thin line.
lot of care." He winked unabashedly at Steve, who barked out a surprised but elated laugh.
Morgan was just… not being able to connect with the other kids. During playtime, the girls preferred to play with dolls and pretend they were mommies, which Morgan had nothing against, but wasn’t really much of her taste. She was more fond of plushies - Rilakkuma, in specific - and robots, like the ones her daddy used to make. The other girls, however, always looked at her weird whenever she mentioned her friends U and DUM-E, so after the third failed attempt, she just stopped trying altogether.
Sam had raised a brow once he finished his reasoning, and Bucky shot him a shit eating grin as he pointed out, “
The morning had been calm. He mostly solved a few issues regarding his company and attended to an early meeting per Pepper's (very passive-aggressive) request, which had been absurdly boring and uneventful, but as soon as he set foot in the premises of the school half hour past noon, his assistant was quick to reach him with a rather annoyed expression set in her usually stony face.
Steve narrowed his eyes, “Stop assuming things, that’s not what happened at all.”
It was ironic how all of this had happened because Tony wanted to prove to everyone he wasn't the smallest in the group. He had always been self-conscious of his height, growing insecure and worried that his smaller-than-average stature would look like an open invitation for vultures such as Obie to see him as easy prey, like Howard used to say he would be.
Soon enough, Tony reached his goal: the room he had been using for himself. He quickly opened the door and pulled Steve inside, making haste to close it behind him, chest moving erratically as he stuck himself to the door and stared at Steve, who was standing in the middle of the room with an arched brow and crossed arms.
“You’re welcome.” Natasha’s teasing tone dragged his mind out of the gutter as she and Wanda stood before him.
“So you have accepted my apology gift? That’s wonderful!” Howard chirped, causing Tony to huff and bury his face further against Jarvis’ tunic, “Now leave my lands. I have much to fix and allies to contact—”
arousal pressing hard
Mr. Rogers' eyes widened. "What?"
Tony felt those metaphorical butterflies that books speak so much about flutter inside his stomach. Why was it so good to hear Steve thanking him? "Anytime, big guy."
Steve raised his head to meet Bucky’s frown across the table where the map they were currently studying sat, and felt a frown of his own crease his forehead, “Why wouldn’t I be?”
She already knew how to spell the name of the animals. Her daddy always took time from his busy schedule to teach her about everything her little sponge of a brain could absorb, and it she
When Steve had to run with part with the Avengers because Ross was not going to let Bucky Barnes’ existence and Steve’s involvement go unpunished before Tony succeeded on working on the amendments for the accords, he left a phone with Tony so he could reach Steve whenever he needed, and Steve would be there. Because whatever it was they needed to face, they would face it
Morgan watched Mrs. Maximoff fumble with the device for a few seconds until her eyes widened almost comically, and she proceeded to look at Mary, then back at the calculator, then back at Mary again. “Oh my God.” She whispered, and after a moment of staring at the calculator, she rounded her table and reached for the phone also sitting on her desk, “Just a minute, sweethearts.”
On the recording, Flash arrived with his little group that Tony took his time memorizing the faces, and the good atmosphere on the table immediately evaporated, "Hey there, Parker. Hanging out with Flabby Pants again? You know, you'll end becoming fat by osmosis or something."
Tony sniffled and buried his face deeper against Jarvis’ tunic, wishing he could disappear from the face of the earth right then. Howard screamed something, which Jarvis—for the first time Tony had ever seen—responded just as venomously, and hugged Tony closer.
Bearded Steve looked older, mature, and much for Tony’s desperation — insanely
Tony smirked. "You remind me of Pep."
Mary, for the first time since she had arrived that day, smiled back, and Morgan felt happiness bloom inside her chest. If Mary had defended her, does that mean that they were friends now? Uncle Rhodey was very protective of daddy, and they are the bestest of friends, so if Mary saved her from Duncan’s teasing, then that should mean they were friends now. Maybe
“Are you fucking insane, you idiot?!” Bucky yelped, earning even more attention from their pack members, who were growing more and more restless at each word, “That’s suicide, even for you! You might be far stronger a d durable than any of us, but you sure as fuck is not invincible, and you know that!”
"I'm filthy rich, honey. I don't need to do anything I don't want to, and I want to help you and your children." He smiled in a way that he hoped it looked charming, "so please, Steve,
Mary’s mouth clamped shut and both girls turned their heads in alarm towards Mrs. Romanoff’s voice, only to find the woman standing by the door with her arms crossed tightly against her chest and a stern expression on her face. Behind her stood Mrs. Maximoff with a concerned look, and before either Mary or Morgan could answer, Duncan pointed at them and accused mid wails, “Morgan was being mean and then Mary pushed me!”
“Stark,” there was that resigned sigh that often seemed to accompany his name, and Tony tried to keep himself from feeling hurt once he realized Rogers
"Well, I suppose it works." He agreed and then looked down at his son, "You won't skip not even a single day, and no videogames for a week."
He inhaled sharply and rubbed at his face.
“Mr. Fuzzy is such a dumb name. I thought you had a genius for a daddy, so where is your smartness now?” He teased cruelly, keeping the caramel bear out of Morgan’s reach, “Stuuuuuuuupid.”
Tony smirked, “Language, Cap-”
Tony laughed heartily at that, resting his forehead against Steve’s chest, “That’s what you’ll argue with? Not the fact I just called you a virgin?”
Once they arrived, Natasha unceremoniously yanked the door open and entered, holding it open so Tony could pass through. He begrudgingly did so, only to find himself frowning at the sight.
get Tony to cooperate with you and do whatever you need to make that happen. See that it’s done by the end of the night, because we are leaving at first light. We need to put some distance between us and the Captain’s man-eating wolves if we want to have any chance to keep what we acquired.”
Turns out Steve’s beauty truly had left Tony more than famished, so he didn’t hesitate before giving the member a hard suck on the head and then proceed to swallow the whole thing like it was the most natural thing to do. Tony Stark did not have a gag reflex, and Steve had just found that out as he panted and stared with wide eyes. “O-Okay. I was not- SHIT!”
Tony chuckled weakly at that, “I hate you.”
“My husband Tony?
"Really?" Amusement was clear in Bruce's tone as he pocketed his hands and smiled teasingly at Tony, "Does that really count when I can turn into a giant green monster with hands bigger than your head?"
The video came to an end and television shut off, which left Tony to click his tongue in annoyance, "That's all there is, J?"
The screen froze once he hit pause, and Tony stared as his mind became a whirlwind of panicked thoughts. Steve couldn’t have meant
Steve stared at his phone, then at Tony, and then back at his phone. "Oh, wow..."
serious expression as she pinned Duncan down with a steely look that actually looked scary.
But before Steve could finish, Tony pulled the boxer down, freeing the throbbing member that had Tony staring in awe. “Holy
Natasha shrugged, “How can I not? They may be slow idiots, but they are
The abandonment had crushed him in ways Tony couldn’t quite put into words, not only because Steve was his one and only friend, but also because he had been Tony’s first love. Love which Tony planned to confess the night they agreed to sneak out to go to a little festival down in Brooklyn, that Steve always told Tony so much about. He had been so excited about it, albeit a bit nervous. Tony never got out much before Steve, but sneaking out with his silly and sickly little friend turned out to be the greatest and most fun times in his life, so Tony always felt excited for them, and this time was even more special since they would go to the neighborhood where Steve had grown up in. Steve had invited him to celebrate, since that day - may fourteenth - would complete three years that they knew each other, and Tony thought it would be the perfect occasion to confess his feelings for the smaller boy, so he made a thousand plans and rehearsed a thousand speeches, and when the clock ticked closer to the hour they had agreed to meet, Tony sneaked out of his room once more and went to their rendezvous point, excitedly waiting Steve to arrive.
“You are! You act all smartpants and stuff, like you know better than us, but I bet you do it just for attention. My daddy says it’s because you inherited your daddy’s arrogance, so you are a prick just like him!”
"But— but—" Steve clearly was trying to form an argument against the idea, and Tony let him. He sure was cute when he was fumbling. "Don't you have a company to run? And the school? I'm sure you have a lot of—"
And as the night went by, with them making a mess in the kitchen while cooking, enjoying their meal while cuddling and watching the movie, or even when the movie became far less interesting than exploring each other's mouths, Tony understood one thing: If he was small, it was only because he was meant to complement Steve Rogers, who made it clear they always would stand in equal footing — no matter his height — as equals, leaders... and
Could someone orgasm just out of hearing pleasantries? Because Tony honestly felt like he was about to.
And now the guy is not only cute, but also hot
?” Tiberius sneered, sounding disgusted, “How can a mere servant be useful as leverage against a rich spoiled brat?”
“Steve,” Tony whispered, loving the sensation of that soft beard brushing against his skin, “Fuck. I’m never letting you shave again.”
Steve reached for Tony’s face, and he placed a hand on top of Steve’s, caressing it slightly while taking in the person lying beside him and who looked at him with nothing short of raw adoration and fear, instead of disappointment and betrayal. A man whom he fought with non-stop, but still found strength within himself to see through Tony’s masks. Tony was Steve’s absolute opposite, but it was absolutely undeniable that they fit perfectly together. Be as team leaders, or as people.
Mrs. Thompson scoffed, seeming outraged, "My son said he did nothing! Are you calling him a liar?!"
Tony blinked at him, surprised, “Huh? Are you sure? You don’t need to-”
“Hm.” The king hummed thoughtfully, “
His skin was warm, far warmer than the other's had been, and his elongated and rather chunky fingers practically eclipsed Tony's own as he moved their fingers together and took a moment to understand the sensation. Steve had been watching him in silent curiosity, but Tony couldn't move his eyes away from their hands, and neither could he ignore the sparks of electricity that seemed to course through their conjoined digits.
“Very good, Mary!” Mrs. Maximoff praised, “Now, we will-”
He forced his legs to move until he was back behind his table and seated on his comfortable chair. His mind was racing, and he couldn't quite organize his thoughts as he poured yet another glass of whiskey for himself. He leaned against the leather backrest and brought the glass to his lips, having a sip while a thoughtful look came across his features.
” His playfull thoughts were once again interrupted, prompting Steve to look up from the pan and towards the ceiling.
Tony released a watery laugh, “Carol said you almost made her go insane looking for me.”
to us, so I cannot risk it, not to mention I’m pretty sure Rogers’ interest was part of some plan Maria had in mind.”
“The Stark’s butler.”
“I wish that was the case, but I have seen with my own eyes what that man is capable of.” Obadiah took another swing of his drink, his eyes seeming haunted as he proceeded, “His group may be large and vicious, but he makes it clear that they are mostly by his side out of option instead of actual support. Once I actually witnessed him going against an entire army of bandits that attempted to ambush us during a trip that Howard had him tagging along for protection. I had questioned him how only one man would be enough help in case we needed, but Howard assured me I would understand in case something actually happened,” Obadiah watched Tiberius’ eyes widening, “and understand, I did, since Rogers actually faced over thirty heavily armed men and came out as the winner, with nothing but a scratch on his cheek and somewhat rumpled clothes.”
Tony’s jaw clenched. Oh hell no.
When Thanos and his forces attacked Wakanda, the Titan was met with an overwhelming amount of resistance formed by countless heroes - all assembled by Steve with T’Challa’s help since the captain took Tony’s concerns about an incoming threat seriously, and had spent all of his time in isolation mobilizing fighters for their cause.
you,” another tear rolled down his cheek, while Tony was openly crying now, “
Tony, too dazed by the prospect of Steve being in love with him to care about Carol’s threat of bodily harm, shifted uncomfortably on the chair while worrying at his bottom lip, “You really think so?”
Morgan held back the urge to yawn for the third time in the last ten minutes. Her teacher kept going on and on about animals and how to spell their names, and there was no doubt Morgan
“Well, you are!” Tony argued petulantly, “Because if you had said all that before and maybe kept
"Holy shit," he gasped breathlessly against Steve's shoulder, "guess that answered if I wanted this or no, huh."
Until his ‘peace’ came to and end when Steve and Natasha showed up in his property accompanied of Scott and a ludicrous plan that sounded absolutely impossible and straight out of a sci-fi movie, but that surprisingly enough, ended up working out in the end.
“It wasn’t your fault.” Steve told him firmly, and Tony couldn’t help the dry chuckle that escaped his lips.
“No, I haven’t, much for his damn luck!” Tiberius crossed his arms against his chest and jutted out his chin petulantly, “I’d have decked the asshole on sight otherwise.”
And spill he did. He told Carol everything, from his idea to watch some footage in order to end his boredom to the discovery of Steve’s ‘hot look’ and all those absurdly nonsensical things he kept telling Bruce about how he missed Tony and how Tony was important to him. Carol just listened with full attention, her expression shifting from surprised to intrigued depending on what Tony relayed, and once he was completely done, Carol had this amused twinkle in her eyes that both unnerved and annoyed Tony.
But Mary continued, “Can we move along the subjects?” she asked, earning a surprised look from Mrs. Maximoff, “I already know how to sum. Will be boring to learn about that again.”
, ever since they locked eyes earlier. Tony felt the urge to look away, but soldiered on, refusing to give in. Whoever these people were, it was clear they were headstrong, so Tony doubted displaying any sort of weakness would be the right move. He needed to toughen up. After all, weren’t Stark men made of iron?
.” Tony breathlessly confessed, looking up from Steve’s chest to meet his thunderstruck expression, “I’m losing my sanity, I’ve lost Pepper… I
Steve audibly gulped at that, “Tony…”
Except... that he never did.
Tony considered his options for a minute, until he came across a good idea that would not only help Steve in a lot of ways, but also help himself, "If you insist, I have something you could do for me."
, because of you. Because you steered me through this strange new world I was thrust into, and you helped me understand I could belong somewhere else that wasn’t my past. You gave me a reason to keep going again, and then I lost you, I
again.”
“What now, boss?” Happy asked, and wasn’t that the golden question? Tony could only shoot his friend a helpless look, and before he could open his mouth to try and say anything, the big side door that gave access to outside swung open, giving passage to a very hurried Steve.
As if on cue, the door opened again, and in came the new student accompanied by Mrs. Romanoff. Morgan rose her look once more to meet the newcomer, and found herself tilting her head slightly. The new girl didn’t seem shy and out of place like most new students got. Instead, she had an annoyed expression and a frown that screamed she wanted to be
“For crying out loud- fine! But no sweets! I’m not dealing with two six year olds on a sugar rush, missies.”
"You know..." Tony rasped, tightening the hold on Steve's hands as the super soldier pressed both on the wall by the sides of Tony's head, completely pinning him down, "if this is some kind of dream in which I'll wake up from in a few seconds, I'll be pretty pissed."
“Proposition?”
Mr. Steve was so warm in a way, warm like the sun. It was amazing!
Tony grinned openly as he watched the kid beam at the Iron Spider, which gleamed from behind the glass case in which it lay waiting for the taking. He had been proud of Peter, and that was no lie. After his participation in the fight Tony ended up having with Steve about the accords and his old pal Bucky, which had ended amicably thanks to a lot of misunderstandings cleared and a stupid villain’s failure that consisted of the guy thinking that using something Steve had already told Tony about a long time ago would tear them apart - disclaimer: it didn’t. - Tony honestly thought the kid had it in him to become something great in a distant future, but still needed a
Steve raised a brow, "Who?"
“Christ! I’m so sorry, I didn’t- shit, are you okay?” Steve pulled him off the floor and onto the bed by his side, massaging Tony’s back while he gathered his bearings, “Tony?”
That actually startled out a laughter from everyone, even Tony, who just slapped his palm against Clint's, "God, I hate you."
“Tomorrow,” Sam pursed his lips, “They are leaving at first light.”
Tony snorted as he closed the door of Carol’s room and turned to her, who was seated on the bed and leaning against the cushioned headboard with her right arm in a sling; one of her eyebrows quirked up as she stared at Tony in both amusement and confusion. He sighed.
Jarvis huffed, hugging Tony tighter and kissing the top of his head, “
“God, Steve, sucking dick is not the end of the world, will you relax?” Steve blushed so damn red that Tony actually feared he would explode, so he laughed and pecked the embarrassed soldier on his swollen lips, “It’s really no problem to me, and it’s real good, so I feel like you deserve a good experience in your first time.”
Hey peeps. I have been dealing with some emotional hardships lately so I'm not feeling the best, which means I'm not overly satisfied with the quality of this chapter. I do hope y'all like it though, maybe I'm just being too hard on myself.
First were Wilson and Barnes, who remained the same except for Barnes who had miraculously cut down that wavey mane of his. They were engaged in a lighthearted conversation as they walked down the platform, soon to be followed by Wanda and Natasha, who were sporting perfectly sandy-blond wigs that helped on their disguise of looking like the wife and daughter of Big, Blond and Beautiful. They seemed to be laughing and talking about something Tony didn’t bother trying to decipher, since he was too busy trying to look past them to try and see—
She just didn’t understand why her aunty Pep was so demanding about her going to school. Daddy was heavily against it, and they had fought over and over again over the decision. She always spoke about how important it was for Morgan to be around other kids her age, but Morgan didn’t quite understand why that was so important, since it has been a bit of time already and the young girl had yet to make any friends.
" And then the big screen turned on once again, this time displaying Peter's impeccable grades and spotless history.
lower himself to his level, but he knew that even though all of this was absolute terrifying to him and that he was basically exploding with anger and resentment, there was no denial that even after all those years he never really got over Steve... and he wasn’t sure if he ever would.
? Tony was so damn sure he never fucking cared during those years, and now he finds out he did? And that he
“If you had seen what I did, you’d know that isn’t true. I destroy everything I touch.”
"I— He—" Mrs. Thompson stuttered, but Tony was not about to let her gather her bearings.
Tony released a humorless laugh, shooting Steve an unimpressed look, “Sure. As if you didn’t move on with your life, seeing you have a daughter and for some reason went from a sickly twig to a muscled log. Bet you had the time of your life with the ladies before you settled down, hm?”
“We are hurrying up because we need the power of the stone on its apex if we want to have
“I was expecting you to have charmed the boy to our side by now, but since you failed to do that, I thought It was time to give you a little push.” Obadiah took a sip of his drink, ignoring the other man’s unhappy frown at being called an incompetent,
“Did you keep himself from doing it in order to protect Thor’s ego?” Tony ground harder this time, successfully ripping out a low growl from the soldier, “My oh my, what an admirable leader you are, sweetheart.”
She had fiery red hair that fell over her shoulder until it reached her waist that was covered in intricate braids, and bright emerald green eyes that scanned the room with bone chilling precision. Tony felt himself shrinking in place, and if he was intimidated by the double-edged ax she carried in one of her hands, it was nobody’s business.
should look that good sporting something as common as beard and long hair, or even a damn
Once Peter was out of sight, Tony heavily sighed and ran a hand through his face, looking back at the Iron Spider suit lost in thought.
But before he could finish, Tony succesfully managed to turn himself just enough so their lips could connect in a breathless kiss, “The best fucking thing that ever happened to me… after doughnuts…”
per se. A team didn’t hide things from one another, a team shares trust and confidence - exactly what he didn’t have on anyone but Bruce when he decided to tackle his Ultron project. It was almost ironic how he had admitted earlier to Fury that his actions had been led by his fear of losing everyone; of his shock of seeing all of his friends die in front of him, but could he even call them that? Rogers and him were not even at a first name basis with each other yet, for crying out loud!
"The he'll it isn't! J?"
Tony wondered, opening his eyes and contemplating the situation for a moment, before he mustered the courage to ask, “The thing you need to tell me… that you wanted to say before we did this,” he felt Steve’s body go rigid under his touch, which had him momentarily biting his lip, “how bad is it?”
, which was quite the stark contrast with how the man usually carried himself — always so clean, prim and proper; the perfect image of an American golden boy.
“Shut it, I absolutely
and impressed that you are this much of a nonsensical asshole to just waltz in back into my life and try to act like nothing happened!”
But Tony had already opened the door, and the outside noise immediately drowned whatever Steve had been saying. Tony smirked in satisfaction.
Lemme know watcha think! Next chapter: Tony's POV :)
. He had been expecting pity. “She decided we needed a break, for me to evaluate what I want for my life, because she wouldn’t live a life with the uncertainty that I might not come back home one day.” He smiled sadly, “And since I can’t… I can’t just…
Steve sharply shook his head, “
Tony didn't even bat an eyelash, "267000"
Tony smirked wolfishly at her, which immediately caused the woman to freeze and shut her mouth. Flash stared at her with wide eyes, and even Peter's father seemed taken back by her words. Tony leaned forward, propping his elbows on the table and interlacing his fingers as he asked with a rather amused tone, "Impressive, Mrs. Thompson. If you have enough money to pay the bills of a billionaire whose current car is worth more than what your entire family probably earned in the past decade, I wonder why you decided to put your kid on my school. Was it for him to deliberately break my rules and piss me off, or just to have the pleasure of bragging to your high society friends that your child is being taught in the best academy currently existing in American soil? My, am I humbled."
An hour passed, two, three, and Steve never showed up. Tony tried calling him, his friend Bucky, and even his mother - Mrs. Sarah, who was a delight of a woman -, but no one ever answered him, so five hours later, he gave up, and went back home.
Hiya, back with another one. I hope y'all like it! I'm trying some real different stuffs with this story, and stepping through waters I have never before, so oof, hello insecurity!!!
concerned about allowing a teenager going off against the big guys, so Tony relented about benching the kid at least until everything about the adjustment of the accords was solved and they would have time to give Peter the training he needed to maybe become a part of the Avengers one day.
Suddenly, the blade of a double edged ax was pressed against Howard’s throat, the cold sharpened metal that was causing a superficial cut on his neck being more than enough to shut his mouth. Tony watched in awe as the petite redhead pressed the ax against his father’s throat, her expression steely as she hissed in a language unknown to Tony, “
Carol rolled her eyes, “Yeah, Stark, your damn golden retriever was a royal pain in the ass until we finally caught a whiff of that message of yours and I managed to go collect you,” she paused and quirked a brow at him, “only for you to arrive and yell at him until he looked like a kicked puppy.”
“No, Cap. We’re fine.” Tony assured, rather stubbornly, “I’m just… thinking.”
chance. A single chance, and if I disappoint you, I’ll leave you alone. I swear to you, Tony, but please,” he inhaled sharply, eyes glistening with unshed tears that Tony just now happened to notice, “don’t go where I can’t follow. Not again.”
Morgan already had contact with things such as percentages and even the pythagoras theorem, much for her daddy’s pride and delight, so how exactly something silly and easy such as a 5+5 problem would be interesting to her?
Tony's thoughts balked.
where he thought his night was going.
Steve, who hadn’t been suspecting a thing, looked at Tony in askance, somehow missing the way Tony’s face burned crimson as he hissed, “
long, sweetheart.”
It was a beautiful day to get engaged to Steve Rogers.
The hands around his waist tightened their hold, “Would that be so bad?” Steve asked shakily, looking at Tony with so much adoration it actually caused his heart to skip a beat. The engineer smirked wolfishly at the man beneath him, grinding against him with abandon and causing Steve to grunt deliciously in response.
My lovely friend from Twitter, Eva (@cosmicstony, GO FOLLOW HER SHE'S A DELIGHT) made a manip for my story, and it looks so good!!!! I'll put it up on the beginning of the chapter, and it's the scene where Steve and Tony recognize each other on the last chapter. IT TURNED OUT SO GREAT I'M JUST EMKFAELGMAEGKLAEGM!!!. Ugh, Eva, this chapter is dedicated to you, you absolute talented treasure!! I cannot.
Bruce chuckled from behind him, "Are you really calling someone out for making a scene when that's exactly what you're doing?"
Howard beamed, “Thank you, good sir. I assure you, you will not regret this! I’m sure we can talk business afterwards, maybe an alliance? A man of your power with my weapons, you’ll be able to take over the continent in the blink of an eye!”
that Tony actually felt like kneeling down again and giving the man a second round, because damn him if Steve didn’t deserve it.
Carol stared at him in disbelief, “Are you being serious right now? Because I’ll flung you out of that window if you are, broken arm or not.”
His wondrous thoughts came to a screeching halt when the familiar feeling of fear crashed against him like a considerably violent wave. Outer space may look beautiful, but it held dangers beyond what he could expect and comprehend, and Tony wasn’t sure he was keen to go for a trip on it after the whole Chitauri debacle. He didn’t know if he was capable of doing it after what he saw that night back at Hydra’s secret hideout. The world needed protection, and there was nothing he wanted more than to keep it safe, but look just where those good intentions had led him and his so-called team?
Then he was amazed, “
” Tony happily responded, sounding as beautiful and fine as usual. Steve smirked.
“Alright, that’s enough,” Mrs. Romanoff snapped, successfully shutting up all three children and turning to their teacher, “Wanda, go tend to the other kids,” She ordered, uncrossing her arms and placing her hands on her hips, “I’ll accompany our troublemakers to Principal Fury’s office. I guess we’ll need to have a word with their parents.”
Tiberius arched a brow, “What do you mean?”
“What truth?”
Steve laughed. “Don’t be ridiculous, Tony.”
Tony groaned, moving to his next test subject, "Please, stay away from the internet. The last thing I need is you communicating through memes."
” A voice, which was definitely not Tony’s, answered, causing Steve to quirk up a brow and walk towards the gigantic windows that framed the penthouse and offered a breathtaking view of New York city during the night.
Tony gasped in outrage, eyes wide, “Obvious infat— okay little miss, just put the damn video and hush unless you want me to donate you to the nearest college.”
” FRIDAY’s agreed sounding far too amused for a computer program. Tony huffed and shook his head fondly. Why did he need to give his creations so much personality?
Tiberius’ eyes narrowed, “That does sound suspicious…”
“No,” Steve backed away slightly to stare him right into his eyes, “Tony,
“H-hush, master Anthony,” Jarvis ordered in a whisper, voice shaky, “stay quiet, and whatever you do, do not attract that man’s attention to yourself, ok?
“And you are saying you were not aware of your father’s actions?” The king pressed on, expression once more turning tempestuous. Tony swallowed nervously.
Tony choked up, “I sent you away.”
“What? Don’t tell me you thought those were fabricated tales as well?” Obadiah humorlessly chuckled, causing Tiberius to dry swallow, “Well, those things are not called ‘Dire Wolves’ for nothing, and they also have other less than friendly animals tagging along, so I’d get on with it if I were you. We need to leave as soon as possible.”
Tony gasped in outrage, “You didn’t!” and then proceeded to hit him over and over again with another pillow while Steve roared a full belly laugh, “How do you even remember that?! It’s been over a decade!”
That had stunned Tony into a shocked silence. That had been the cruelest thing his father—should he even address that man as ‘father’?—had ever said to him in all his 20 years of life, and it had been too much for him to bear, so he did nothing but flee the throne room without waiting to be dismissed, heading straight to Jarvis’ quarters crying inside his caretaker’s embrace until he had no tears left to cry and passed out of exhaustion.
“Why not- Tony!” He sounded exasperated in a way that was almost cute, “You are talking about- this is not-”
Steve smiled minimally and lowered his head, “
“He is, but he is also coming home tonight,” Steve explained, turning back to the stove and to the meal he was preparing, “so we will be welcoming him with a family dinner. Your aunts and uncles must be arriving soon.”
“But that’s stupid! Even if he figures out about Anthony and wants to rescue him, he won’t be able if we use Anthony and the stone against him! Didn’t you just tell me you have leverage against him, so he will answer to us no matter what? Well, let’s use that!”
After the greetings, Mrs. Maximoff told Mary to go along and pick a seat for herself after she hung her backpack - which had Morgan interally gasping, since it was a
Tony hitched a breath, looking back up towards Steve, who kept eyeing him hungrily in a way he never imagined Steve would be capable of looking at anyone. He opened his mouth to say something, when he felt his back soflty collide against a nearby wall, surprising him and causing his mouth to fall shut just as Steve shortened even more the space between them, their mouths inches apart, breaths mingling together.
other times happened, that is. He could only hope.
was in low spirits, but Rogers? He never stopped to grieve like everyone else. He seemed hell bent on finding you, or at least trying to figure out if you were gone or not. I lost count of how many times he begged me to search for you, and when I returned empty handed, insisted I returned back there to try a little more, to go a little farther. I told him
Steve groaned in embarrassment and threw an arm over his eyes, “Please, don’t just say these things.”
Tony snorted, "And since when do you cook?"
“Of course I would! Anything for our kingdom.” Howard laughed, almost hysterically. Tony wasn’t sure if the man had gone full mad or not, but he didn’t really find strength in himself to care, “Isn’t that what he wanted? To save us all? Well, there is it! Everyone wins! Now take the little whore and get out of my territory.”
." She had reassured him when he was too panicked to actually be more of a constant in the academy. "
And to be really honest, Steve couldn't put into words how glad he was to find out how wrong he had been.
Then he felt it — Steve’s
Tiberius’ scowl only intensified, “I have, but I found them ridiculous. They sounded like exaggerations, attempts to make the man sound mightier than he actually is.”
“One would think the guy with the military background would be the strict parent.” Tony whined, “Do you know how difficult it was to take that suit away from him?!
Not only big, but also thick, which had Tony shivering in anticipation of having the man burying himself inside him. At the beginning, he had plans of topping and allowing Steve to feel all the pleasures sex had to offer since this was his first time, but after laying his eyes on the beauty he was now worshipping with his tongue and hands? There was no argument. He could show Steve Rogers’ the wonders and pains of bottoming another time if this ever came to happen again, but not tonight. Tonight,
“Yes,” Tony moved closer, pushing Steve towards the bed and making him sit down. Once he did, Tony easily climbed on his lap and straddled his hips, causing Steve to flush to a beautiful shade of scarlet as he looked up at Tony, “I’m currently single, and I find absurdly unacceptable how America’s biggest eye candy has never been properly unwrapped, so how about I show you a good time, and both of us can get out minds out of things for awhile? It’s a win-win.”
that had been suppressed for an entire decade. Their tongues moved together in a sensual dance that neither seemed able to have enough, and soon they were fighting for dominance, angling their heads for better positions as they kissed and moved and felt and
” F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s voice sounded above his head, almost like she had read his thoughts, causing him to jerk his head up in both anxiety and hope.
month
,” he rumbled, causing Jarvis to pull Tony closer again almost automatically, but the protective gesture didn’t keep the Viking from proceeding, “would you like to come with us?”
Tony gasped and pointed at the archer, "See? That's what I mean. No respect!"
Steve quickly washed his hands and dried them off with a dishcloth which was lying around, letting it rest on his right shoulder while he picked up the phone as soon as it rang; Tony’s contact name shining on the sleek screen as he answered the call and brought the phone close to his ear, “Hey babe, are you already on your way home?”
“I am
The woman startled back to reality, "What?" She blinked at Tony, and then her confused expression morphed into one of anger, "What do you mean 'potential misbehavior'? I already said my son is innocent! "
Rogers…”
Steve looked and sounded exasperated, “I didn’t have a choice. You don’t understand.”
“Is that so?” Steve smirked, sounding all smug, the bastard. “That’s good to hear, I was hoping to impress you.”
What the
Peter beamed at him, "Exactly!"
Tony regarded him for a moment, thinking about how that night had started and how much guilt and despair had been eating at him while he paced inside that barn by himself before Steve arrived. He thought about the nightmare that had been shown to him, how he watched the lifeless bodies of his entire team lay unmoving before his very eyes, and how the very man now staring at him had nothing but words of disappointment for him on his deathbed. How he said Tony could have done more, how Steve had been the one to say that, and nobody else.
“You know, king Stark of the south, I have met many kings during my voyages,” Tony heard King Steven say, and the next thing he knew, the man was aiding him and Jarvis to their feet, “and of all the horrible men I faced, you are undeniably one of the most despising of them all.”
Rogers.”
Tony smirked knowingly at her and gestured lazily towards the door. "It's not the first time I've hear that, so I'm sure my own lawyers will have a blast with yours. Have a wonderful day."
” She explained, having Tony to perk up in interesting, “
Tony smiled warmly at her, “I love you too, stardust.”
Steve Rogers was a man unlike any other, and it terrified Tony how suddenly inclined he was to turn the world upside down in order for it to fit Steve and his little family as it should.
“Father, please, don’t rile them up.” Tony hissed, earning a pointed glare from the man, “We saw what they are capable of, we shouldn’t—”
at it. A natural, who had Tony moaning and writhing in pleasure in less than ten seconds. His big hands grabbed at everywhere he could, leaving purplish marks on Tony’s legs as his mouth and tongue worked overtime to drive Tony absolutely out of his damn mind. He grabbed a fistful of sheets and moaned out loud when Steve left his entrance to give attention to his cock, which happened to be throbbing and a sticky mess of pre-come due Steve’s hand smearing all of it down the length. He licked and nipped at Tony’s shaft, while continuing to rub gently at his entrance, and Tony was on the verge of losing his sanity as he continued to moan desperately and squirm under Steve’s hold. He’s never been more glad to have listened to his isolating tendencies since, thankfully, the barn he had accepted to spend the night in was far enough from the main house for anyone to actually listen to his moans.
“Understatement of the year. Bra-vo. Do you want a cookie?”
“Stark?”
“No!” Jarvis cried out, pushing past Howard and completely ignoring the king’s angry shout. In less than a second Tony’s bare body was once more engulfed by Jarvis’ warm embrace, Jarvis who was shaking and hugging him like his life depended on it. “Please, please don’t take our boy from us. He’s the only thing we have left of our beloved Queen. Please Your Highness,
"Maybe I don't have to, but I definitely want to woo and spoil my special fella before making love to him," Steve argued, trailing kisses down Tony's neck and causing him to shudder and bite his lip.
The offended gasp from the other line actually had Steve laughing. Wasn't hard to picture Tony’s outraged expression, “
“300x50?”
That being said, TW for some homophobia, depressive thoughts, abandonment and the fact that Howards Stark is a class A MOTHERF*CKER in this story. That alone is a trigger warning, just, ugh. You'll see what I'm talking about.
“I don’t think—” King Steven attempted, but he didn’t get to finish since in the next second Howard successfully managed to strip Tony bare from his robe, and was shoving the young prince forward, causing him to fall by the other king’s feet completely naked and shivering from both disbelief and humiliation.
Needless to say that the only reason Tony didn’t crumble right then was due the fact Morgan had been in his arms.
“Hey! You are not great at that either, Mr. ‘Do It Baby I Know The Law’!”
They were talking about something Tony couldn't quite hear, but Barton and Steve were sitting on one of the couches while Natasha sat atop the kitchen island, munching on a PB&J sandwich. The sight was almost too domestic, and the thought of it warmed Tony's heart in a way he wasn't quite expecting.
” The guy sounded at a complete loss, “
angry voice erupted from the classroom’s now open door, “What on
“If we didn’t need to go on a life threatening mission in a few hours, you can be damn sure we wouldn’t be leaving this bed.”
.” Tony bit out, his sarcasm not going unnoticed by Howard, who finally directed an annoyed look towards him. “You might trust that bald weasel he has for a father for whatever reason, but I don’t. Tiberius already torments me enough as it is, imagine if I belong to him in any way!”
But it turned out alright in the end. Tony still struggled some to properly talk with the kids, but in most part he did well. It also helped that Natasha was the one doing most of the job, so there was that.
, but you know how families are.”
Carol smirked up to her, “Mr. Grouchy?”
The assassin grinned even wider as Carol sit up with a large smile, her scarred arm already free from the sling, “Did they finally talk things out?”
To say Tony was breathless was an understatement. “History books didn’t bullshit when they said you were good at this speech thing.” He was deflecting, and he knew it, but so did Steve as he sighed tiredly and closed his eyes.
The captain surely didn’t help, since after things went back to normal Steve became one of the most wonderful companies Tony could have around. His stubbornness had toned down quite a lot, seeing he was more flexible and inclined to hear Tony out when the engineer disagreed about something during a mission or on the casual days. He also was extremely soft and caring, always bringing him meals when he forgot to eat — “
Regardless!!! A few TWs for this chapter, lovelies. We will dwelve in Tony's past, and let me tell you, it ain't no easy ride. When I said he is struggling he is struggling A LOT, and you'll see why, mainly where Steve is concerned. We also will understand why little Morgan is so determined to make this work, and I can only promise you guys this: it will be heartbreaking, but necessary.
“Who is this?”
"Please, call me Tony."
King Steven seemed to grunt something unhappily in his mother tongue, ignoring whatever Howard was going on about and coaxing Jarvis and Tony to walk towards the exit. They did it without preamble, wanting to leave that place as soon as possible, and reached the main entrance where a big muscular and blond man awaited. Tony held back the need to recoil once the big guy glowered down at them with a single good blue eye—the one that wasn’t covered by an eye-patch. His beard was longer than the king’s, even allowing it to be braided like the rest of his bright blond hair. A thick hammer was strapped to his black armor’s leather belt, and the low rumble of a voice he possessed was enough to send terrified shivers down Tony’s spine, “
A laugh of disbelief erupted from the—oh God,
A low grunt reached Tony’s ears, “Tony… what are you…”
That only proved that Steve, even after all these years of pain and solitude he had brought Tony, still held an overwhelming amount of power over his heart and soul, and Tony wasn’t sure if that was a good thing. Because yeah, there was the possibility that Steve was the only one that could properly heal what was left of his broken soul, but that also means that... if Steve broke his heart a second time, it would be broken beyond repair, and Tony wasn’t sure if he was willing to take that leap of faith.
The aftermath was a disaster. Pepper had to step up to look after Morgan with the help of Rhodey, because Tony completely lost it. He threw himself into vices, never ending one night stands with both women and men, got himself a terrible long list of scandals that only served to rile up Howard more and more each day, so much that he transferred most of Tony’s power on the company to Obadiah - his until then “trustworthy” friend -, not that Tony gave a damn.
"Are the others in the tower?"
Howard, after finally being able to compose himself, narrowed his eyes at the man before him, “I have no idea what you are talking about, barbarian.”
The redhead held her position for a moment longer, before stepping back and removing the blade from Howard’s neck, who released a shuddering breath and clutched his throat. “
“Then how about you start by telling me
“You are something else, Stark.”
“Not right now, no, but tell you what,” Tony smiled, “swing by next week on Friday, and I’m sure Cap won’t object teaching you some of his moves, hm?”
Peter's expression clouded over in the video, while Ned only lowered his head. "Go away, Flash. I already told you I'm not going to join your little group, and leave Ned alone!"
, mainly for a guy of Tony’s age.”
The waiting warriors howled in agreement, raising their weapons in pure glee as the huddle of terrified subjects and royals to scream in horror and fear. Tony felt his entire world turn upside-down. All his hopes and expectations slipping through his fingers as the reality of what was about to happen struck him like a mace. They were going to die. The Vikings wouldn’t spare them, King Steve
"T-Then that should apply to that brat as well! He inflicted bodily harm on mine!" Mrs. Thompson argued, her panicked voice sounding almost like a shriek and bothering Tony's ears.
but my mother, who I don’t know if you fucking remember, died before you left me like you said you wouldn’t. Do you know how much time I spent waiting in that damn park for you, Steven? Five hours. Five
(See the end of the chapter for
difficult, and he’s not even actually my kid!”
Of course Nat would see right through him. Carol and her made one hell of a duo when it came to seeing right through Tony’s bullshit. It was impressive.
"Can you stop overthinking everything?" Bruce grumbled, turning his annoyed gaze to a pouting Tony, "I didn't mean anything by it, it's not that deep."
“But we have the Philosopher’s Stone!”
Tiberius clicked his tongue, “I don’t think I have ever seen you this agitated, Stane.”
Happy stared at both for a moment, until realization seemed to dawn on him, “Oh, yes!” and he proceeded to search his pockets, until he pulled out a single wedding ring while beaming a smile from ear to ear, “I’ve been carrying this since 2012!”
“For a one hundred year old virgin, you sure kiss like an expert, Mr. Rogers.” Tony teased, which had Steve backing away slightly to look at him with a half-smile and a quirked up brow.
FRIDAY's voice sounded almost amused, "
Tony mumbled something, but didn’t try to do more than that as he continued, anchoring himself by holding onto Steve’s thighs and feeling an absurd amount of pleasure to course through his entire being while warmth pooled inside his stomach and his own cock pulsed with arousal. He was having the time of his life while kneeling for Captain America, and when Steve’s strong hand grabbed a fistful of his hair and yanked him forward unconsciously, Tony felt himself drawing a blank.
The captain shook his head fondly. His children truly were too much like their dad, "Tell them to clean up as well. Tony and I will bathe Mary again after dinner."
Morgan offered her a sheepish smile and a little wave, to which the girl stared confused for a moment, until she replicated the gesture. Wouldn’t hurt to try and be friendly, right? If she seemed as uncomfortable as Morgan normally felt, maybe they could become friends eventually, right?
Steve's seductive look was soon replaced by one of concern as he straightened up on the chair and worriedly asked, "Are you alright?"
The Vikings hounded closer, and Tony watched in panic as they surrounded them with raised weapons with malicious smirks.
touched him down there yet, and his body was already this responsive? Tony was
Bruce frowned, “
, so Tony tried as much as he could to keep him away from harm and grounded before something bad could happen. Steve, ever the concerned Team Dad(tm), had also asked him to do so, and Tony couldn’t help but to smile as he remembered the Captain’s words when he confided in him that he had brought a fourteen year old into the battlefield back then.
"That I accept any punishment, but I don't regret what I did." The kid ground out stubbornly while crossing his arms against his tiny chest, "He hurt my friend and keeps trying to force me to join him and those buddies of his, and I don't want to! I don't like bullies."
“Always so bossy.” Steve shuffled around, removing his fingers from inside Tony - which caused him to gasp - and placing himself in between his legs, “If I remember well, we are equal in here. You are not the boss of me.”
Tony released a low grunt as heat pooled in his gut, causing him to clench his fists on top of the table as he attempted to gather his bearings. ‘
in his life, and that he literally described you as his ‘everything else’, which doesn’t seem to involve friendship
Steve blinked owlishly at him, “You actually want me?”
Tony swallowed past the lump in his throat and blinked back to reality and out of his dazed state as Steve’s bearded face remained there, practically taunting him and honestly making him want to scream in frustration. Ever since their disagreement back in 2016, Tony had been valiantly trying to move past his attraction for the captain — resolve that had taken quite the hit once Tony was returned to earth after their colossal failure against Thanos and Steve,
of them are going to pay.”
Mrs. Thompson looked between outraged and aroused, and Tony honestly had to bit his lip to hold back his laughter.
“I will not marry that man,
FINALLY, I MADE IT!
Later that same night, he had snapped at Steve; all the anger, all the pain and all the grief becoming too much for Tony to hold any longer, and in the next day, when Steve and the others returned with the crushing news that Thanos had destroyed the stones before dying, Tony snapped again — only this time he sent them away and yelled at Steve that he ‘
He was too deep inside his own hole of self-pity to give a damn about anything, after all.
"Hardly. Last time I checked, he was some inches taller than you. He got more bulk, too."
Tony whimpered and buried himself further into Jarvis’ embrace, “Please don’t hurt me.”
“Father, please—”
“I said he could swing by next week for some Captain America training, that alright?”
Morgan scrunched up her nose and and lowered her eyes to her colorful notebook. Math classes were the
“Yes?”
Trying to convince himself of that didn't keep the irritation from seeping through his tone, however, "Mrs. Thompson, wouldn’t you like to address your son's potential misbehavior?"
Steve rolled his eyes and placed the phone back on top of the counter on his way back to the kitchen, and soon he was back to work. "FRIDAY, can you please warn Harley to go clean himself as well?"
Thankfully, Steve had decided to ignore his friend’s nonsensical teasing and looked at Tony with a smile, “
They stared in disbelief at him for a second, but the redhead soon was pushing them away to do whatever they had been told to do. Tony watched wordlessly as they marched towards the castle servants and ushered them out of the throne room. They whimpered and hugged each other, some feebly resisted, crying out for Tony and begging for mercy, certain that those would be their final moments, that they were being carried to their deaths, and Tony could only continue to cry because… because he didn’t know either.
, but I couldn’t. I’m still afraid of what is going to happen, of what is
“Yeah, sure, so this is where you lie about whatever bullshit reason you had to leave, or...?
Steve backed away slightly but Tony chase after him, throwing his arms around the soldier’s neck and pulling him closer as he took his turn on getting to know each inch of Steve’s mouth. What was chaste and timid became wild and desperate, and after what felt like a lifetime, they finally moved away, panting against each other’s mouths with their foreheads glued. “God, that was better than I expected it would be,” Steve admitted breathlessly, to which Tony chuckled in amusement.
“If Tony doesn’t willingly accept you, good luck with forcing yourself on him,” Obadiah nonchalantly said, turning his uninterested gaze towards the papers he had been reading, “that boy is currently the most powerful being on the realm, so I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”
Standing by the door with a look capable of making even the bravest of people soil their pants, was possibly the most beautiful specimen Tony had ever laid eyes on. He had short blonde hair and a full beard that looked far too soft to be real, a pair of piercing blue eyes that burned with poor concealed fury and sent a pleasurable shiver down Tony's spine, who was having a hard time to try and stop ogling those absurdly broad shoulders and the ridiculous muscles that were just as poorly concealed by a flannel long sleeved shirt — sleeves which were folded up to his elbows. The worn out jeans and the brown shoes assembled an outfit that would usually make Tony scoff and look the other way — affronted by such an insult to fashion — but the guy somehow pulled off in the hottest way possible.
“I’m serious, Steve.” Tony removed Steve’s hand from his face and placed a kiss on his knuckles, “as heavy as it may be, I’m sure we’ll figure out. We can figure anything out, as long as we’re together.”
Obadiah rolled his eyes and walked towards the scotch bottle sitting on his desk and poured himself a glass, “Figured you’d be amused by that. Regardless, feel free to use the Jarvis card with Tony. I’m sure he’ll do anything you ask of him that way.”
“Maybe,” Steve agreed, moving a hand from Tony’s hip down towards his length, grabbing it and massaging the tip calmly with his thumb. Tony moaned loudly and landed another punch on the mattress, while Steve released a shuddering exhale. “You sound and feel so good, you have no idea.”
Tony's eyes widened in both glee and surprise. Steve's little girl was a genius?
How could these Vikings be his doom, when it felt like they had been his salvation?
And then the unthinkable happened, and Tony actually climaxed while

Flash's laughter in the video ruined the tender moment for Tony. "As if someone dirty and poor as you would know anything about how the high class behaves!"
Tony scoffed, “Wouldn’t you like to know.”
Peter had been so happy about the prospect of being in contact with the animals that he didn't even flinch before the added punishment. "Okay! No problem!"
Tony's expression hardened even more as he rested against his chair's backrest "And why do I find that hard to believe?"
Steve beamed at that, pulling Tony closer and placing a kiss on top of his messy curls, "I'm glad. It's been awhile since I last kissed anyone, so I didn't want to disappoint."
Tony narrowed his eyes as he stared at the screen. Surely looking into F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s recordings from past days due boredom wouldn’t be much of a fun activity, but he had done it anyway because... why not? Sure the compound had mostly been silent back then after the fall out between him and Steve, that ended up fracturing and tearing the Avengers apart, but at least Tony would get to check what he missed, even if they were little details he wouldn’t give much of a damn about in normal days.
Steve’s head jerked up at that and his eyes snapped open, “What?”
Steve brought his fingers to his mouth and sucked Tony’s come out of them, staring at Tony while doing it for some absurd reason the engineer couldn’t really understand other than maybe getting him to cum again. “You taste delicious, as well.”
Steve grunted against his ear, continuing to move inside on a steady pace that was sending all kinds of possible shivers down Tony’s spine. “You feel so good, Tones. Shit.” Steve growled against his neck, tightening the hold on his hips and causing Tony to moan louder and louder, “There. There you are.”
Steve, however, still seemed uncertain, "I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with putting Mary with the bigger kids. I know she will be safe, but she still is very small and might get intimidated, and I don't think I need to tell you she won't fit in well along with the other first graders..."
“Your highness, please stop—” Tony heard Jarvis faintly ask from behind them, but Howard continued as if he hadn’t listened.
"Tony," Steve called in a low voice, almost a whisper, regaining Tony's attention in a second, "thank you for stepping up for Peter today. You didn't have to, but it means a lot that you did."
“Yeah,” he chuckled humorlessly, “there’s always something eating at me, but it takes one to know one, and I know there’s something else other than your good intentions that made you do this.” Rogers smartly pointed out, once again catching Tony off-guard, “The enhanced girl made you see something as well, didn’t she? Like the rest of us?”
I didn’t get a letter, not even a damn phone call. You left me in the dark
"Well, if the problem is who to blame, why don't we just figure out?" Tony helpfully supplied, earning everyone's attention as he turned to the great television situated on the side of his office and snapped his fingers. "JARVIS, please recover the file from the cafeteria around noon today, please."
of reporters outside waiting to record whatever it was the big announcement Tony Stark would bring forth that day, and now that Peter had sauntered off happily into the sunset like the righteous good boy that learned a valuable lesson he was, Tony was left with nothing to show.
But that fact meant that Tony was about to see how Steve had allowed himself to look through these months, and now that he stopped to think about it, he had no idea if he was ready for it — or would have any self-control, for that matter.
of all people! Gosh, Ned would
That immediately caused Steve to tense up, while Bucky raised a brow at his husband, “This really is not the best time for this, feathers.”
Tony bit his lip, “Doesn’t matter.”
“What do you mean, your daddy is in danger?”
Tony inhaled sharply and closed his eyes.
“Tony, I didn’t say that for you- I don’t mean to force you to-”
Enjoy, and don't forget to lemme know your thoughts if you can! I appreciate it <3
"That's right, he should know better." Both Tony and Peter’s father whipped their heads towards Mrs. Thompson, who apparently had found her voice again. Wonderful. "He shouldn't go around punching other kids like that!"
“Tony!”
His retort was interrupted by a knock on the door, which caused Tony to snap his mouth shut and exchange heated glares with Mrs. Thompson. "Yes?"
had passed, and Tony wasn't just missing the captain like hell, but he was also terrified of what awaited him whenever his team landed back in American soil.
Once everything at Morgan’s school was solved - what ended on the Williams being very disgruntled as Fury warned them to keep their kid under control, since his behavior has been a headache for him even before he started to pick on Morgan - Tony found himself sitting on a bench park with Steve by his side as they watched their girls have a good time at the local playground outside the school. They were silent, since Tony was unsure how to even start a conversation with a man he hasn’t seen for the past two decades, and Steve was not trying to start any conversation either.
Talking about the harpy, Tony finally focused back on her just in time to hear her last sentence, "— and I should have known better than to allow Flash stay in here when you came up with this ridiculous scholarship announcement! If I wanted my child to be near dirty commoners, I would have placed him on a public school!"
Rewind. Stop. Play
Steve was his. Steve was finally
The pause was longer this time, but then there was some shuffling and Steve finally heard a ping, “Tones?”
“If it isn’t our best girl,” Natasha smiled, “what is it?”
He exhaled a shaky breath, immediately making his mind and getting to his feet, “F.R.I.D.A.Y., is Danvers awake?”
perceptive for a little girl of her age, and she knew her daddy wasn’t great with dealing with guilt -, so she really didn’t want to worry him more.
The elevator's doors opened, and Tony immediately sauntered off of it and headed straight towards the big living room where he knew his team currently was.
“Angry?!” Tony exploded, turning to glare daggers into Steve as he proceeded hotly, “Oh no, Steve, I’m not ‘angry’,” he made air quotations with his fingers, “I’m absolutely
“128+310?”
This went by for months, and Pepper desperately tried to get Tony to focus, to remember he had a little girl that needed him, but he could barely manage to even look at Morgan without breaking down completely. She looked too much like Darlene for him to be able to handle it, so for the first year of her life, Morgan barely saw or interacted with her father.
“I had other plans for him, but honestly, the brat is just too much work. I’ll just crown someone else I find much more worthy of the throne than him, and well, maybe you can use him to warm your bed before the sacrifice?” Howard manically said, tugging at Tony’s robe and making him fight back in fear and confusion, “I guarantee you you won’t regret it! Let me show you, good Lord, and you’ll surely see what I mean.”
He thought, almost breathlessly,
“But…”
WHO THAT???
“Honestly,” Steve laughed in amusement, resuming his assault against the skin of Tony’s neck and whispering against it, “you could have just asked, darling. I’d do anything for you.”
“Shut up,” Tony pushed his face away whilst laughing, causing Steve to chuckle and nuzzle against Tony’s hand and then nibble at it, “Stop it, you grizzly bear.”
That successfully pulled Tony out of his trance and back into the matter at hand. He frowned at Flash, "Is that true?"

“I don’t know,” Steve looked right into his eyes, in a way that made Tony shudder beneath the gaze that seemed to be seeing through his very soul, “are we?”

Steve’s hold on his waist tightened so much that Tony had no doubt the digits would leave marks, but he couldn’t bring himself to care, not when Steve pulled him down on his own accord and the hard clash of their bodies actually caused Tony to gasp as an unrelenting wave of desire crashed against him and left him breathless. Steve was fully hard beneath him, and Tony could feel
Rogers’ blue gaze clouded and the lines of his face tensioned considerably, “I’m not perfect.”
“You sounded beautiful, just now.”
Well, except for the beard. That was a change that was
“Tony…”
“I’m not telling you to be calm about anything, dammit! I’m only telling you to back the fuck down for a moment and let me plan this out, because if you honestly think that going head on against a fucking
“Did you mean it?”
He smiled lightly. As silly as it may sound, he did find a family in this gathering of freaks, didn't he?
. He thought, enthralled.
“Hm,” Steve hummed thoughtfully, kissing up Tony’s neck until he was nipping at his earlobe, “were you?”
The mission was in Europe, where Steve, Wanda and Natasha would play the undercover part as a distraction while Sam and Bucky sought out important intel S.H.I.E.L.D. needed recovered. Tony had been very specific about what looks they should acquire during their time in the United Kingdom, and perhaps he slipped to Steve that a full beard would be a great idea since nobody would expect Captain America to not look perfectly shaven. Steve had already complained how often he had to shave or cut his hair, since the serum affected that growth rate as well, so it was a perfect disguise that naturally would appear in no time; therefore, during those two months, Steve would let it grow — no razors allowed.
’ Steve was attractive, but confrontational ‘

“I have my secrets, and I assure you, that beard is as soft as it looks, I made sure of that.” She gently patted his arm, “Get ready though, he’s like a big puppy who missed his owner. Wouldn’t stop asking me about you during the entire mission, it was adorable.”
Bucky ran a hand through his hair in frustration, “You damn fucking-”
Steve's beard looked even softer from up close, and the need to run his fingers through that beautiful brownish-golden mane was almost too overwhelming for Tony to handle. The man was some inches taller than he was, but was still tall enough to force Tony to look up in order to be able to remain hostage of Steve's mesmerizing gaze. He seemed to be assessing Tony, trying to understand him and his motivations perhaps, and Tony was one step from closing the distance between them and making his intentions
Alright, that caught him off guard. He subtly looked in Peter's direction only to find the boy blushing and looking down as if suddenly his sneakers had become really interesting. Tony smiled.
There was a pause, and then, “Can’t really argue with the truth, now can I?”
"Jesus, what the hell? Do you two really need to be so good at sneaking up on people?" Tony complained, massaging the spot on his chest where the arc reactor sat. That earned him a chuckle from Steve and a smirk from Natasha.
Oh no. Tony’s breath quickened and his palms became sweaty.
Clint gasped, faking outrage, "Stark, you wound me! Whatever shall I do without your sweet kisses and praises!"
Tony glared at him, but was caught off-guard upon finding the man smiling teasingly at him other than seeming as serious and stone-faced as he used to be.
He didn’t know
Tony stared at him, arm trembling slightly in Steve’s strong but gentle grip. He wanted to say no. He wanted to yank his hand away and tell him to go to hell, to get away from him, to
Hell, he was finding a barbarian more pleasant than his own father, so he supposed that spoke for itself.
Steve blinked a few times, but nodded, “Yes, sorry, I just…”
"And where are Pete and Mary?"
“Yeah, Tony,” Mr. Steve cocked his head to the side, “pretty please?”
Tony watched as realization seemed to dawn on his father, and he saw Howard grow pale in a way he had never seen before, which didn’t bode well, “N-no, it can’t be. Those were just tales, there’s no way—”
Steve, ever the box of surprises he liked to be, was absolutely
Mary seemed thoughtful for a moment, which prompted Mrs. Maximoff to open a satisfied smile, “Mary, you shouldn’t-”
Natasha rubbed their noses together and giggled softly — a sight reserved to Carol only, “You big sap. Are you sure you aren’t related to Steve in any way?”
He never did, because he knew that as soon as he got to hear Steve’s voice, all his resolve and anger would dissolve and he would immediately crumble — probably caving in to the desire of forgiving Steve. He couldn’t allow it, not that soon. He needed time to allow things to heal, and he couldn’t trust Steve that easily anymore, not after learning what the man had kept from him out of fear he would attack Barnes.
To say Tony was surprised to see Peter Parker inside his office was an understatement. The kid was one of his brightest students, with an impeccable set of grades and exemplar behavior to match. Never, ever since Parker had been admitted into the Maria Stark's Academy, had he ever been sent to the principal's office for misbehaving, so Tony imagined the patched up broken nose Flash Thompson was sporting had something to do with it.
A knock interrupted Morgan’s wandering thoughts and the sloth paced lesson, and she rose her head just in time to watch the school’s monitor - a cool but scary looking lady called Mrs. Romanoff - appear on the door and ask to speak with their teacher. Mrs. Maximoff went to her and they started to speak in hushed tones, until Mrs. Maximoff opened a bright smile and nodded eagerly. Mrs. Romanoff then nodded and proceeded to leave, leaving Mrs. Maximoff to turn her pretty smile to the rest of the class and clap her hands excitedly, “I have great news, sweethearts! Seems we’ll be getting a new friend to join our little class. Isn’t that exciting?”
“I already forgave you, big guy.”
“Not lyin’! She pushed me!” He screamed back, pointing at Mary, who scowled angrily.
"I'm not lying! I never lie!" Peter barked back, and the boys clearly were about to fall into another fight when Zeus' offspring finally graced Tony's ears with his voice once again.
The kiss was intense and messy; a mix of despair and visceral
That was too big of a blow on his self-control, and a single tear rolled down Tony’s cheek, “I yelled at you.”
The name hit a little too close to home, but Tony decided to ignore that for now. "Seven? That's quite young. Where does she study?"
“Happy,” he turned to the silent chauffeur, who startled in response, “do you still have it?”
She never told daddy, however. Just recently he started to feel better - uncle Obie’s betrayal hurt him really bad - and started to accept the fact she needed to attend to school. She didn’t like it, and would much rather stay with him at all times, but she couldn’t be selfish right now. Daddy had a lot of work now that he couldn’t rely on uncle Obie anymore, and the only person who was helping him was aunt Pep, so Morgan didn’t want them arguing about her situation anymore. He daddy would be overwhelmed with worry if he knew of what she was enduring, not to mention how bad he would feel to know she was being picked on due who he was - Morgan was
Which was why four years later when Peter Parker, then 13 years old and recently orphaned for the second time, needed a new home, he didn’t hesitate for a second before taking him in. Peter had lost his birth parents when he was much younger, then being raised by his uncle and aunt. However, fatality striked again when the boy’s uncle was victim of a violent mugging that ended in his death, and with his aunt suffering from chronic depression and not being able to care for him anymore, Peter would have gone into the system until he turned eighteen. Pepper, who was a close friend of the family, brought the situation to Tony one day when he noticed she had been crying at her table. Her distress was palpable since she adored Peter and was heartbreaking to see May in the situation she was, so Tony decided to step in to not only take the custody of the boy, but also pay for May’s treatment and keep her bills and house paid without her needing to worry about it, all while allowing Peter to make her constant visits.
to grant Steve any forgiveness. He wanted to hate, and resent.
you need. Together, yes?”
"300 x 890?"
"They seem perfectly made just for mine." He huskly answered, causing Tony's heart to speed up inside his chest and almost push out the arc reactor in the process.
He shook his head, “That’s exactly what I meant by saying I’m not perfect, Tony. No matter what comic books or even history books say about me, I’m not a god, I’m just a kid from Brooklyn who happened to get juiced up by a mad scientist.” That fond and breathtaking smile made a comeback, “and isn’t it just ironic how I’m always getting entangled with mad scientists that just happen to turn my world upside down somehow?”
, and if Rhodey hadn’t been there to keep his head above the water, Tony had no idea how he would have made through the five years that passed after Tony kicked everyone out of the compound and ‘retired’ to some secluded farm in a remote location where he hoped nobody would bother him.
"So you know you were wrong, but still won't apologize."
But as Steve continued to look deep into his soul, Tony’s eyes captive of his own as he gazed upon him with both despair and determination, Tony found himself unable to do any of the aforementioned things.
“Obviously. What do you take me for, a fool such as yourself?” Obadiah sneered, earning an affronted snarl from the younger man, “Steve Rogers is no common man. In fact, he might not even be
… Could he?
He ran to Morgan’s room first thing, finding his daughter wailing and fussing inside her crib, clearly hungry as any newborn would be. He picked her up, distraught and confused, trying to soothe her while he tried to wrap his head around that entire situation.
“It’s fine, big guy.” Tony managed to say, even though his throat was awfully sore and his voice came out scratchy, “You were great, tasted great too.” Tony leaned forward and captured Steve lips, causing the man to grunt in surprise but kiss back with enthusiasm. Tony smiled and licked at Steve’s lips, hearing himself pant, “See? Delicious.”
Tony held back a snicker. How was 'damn' a shocking curse?
"Very well," he finally found his own voice after dry swallowing his want, "I don't think there is anything else to investigate here. It's clear that Peter’s reaction was nothing but a response to the aggression against his friend, whom I'm sure I'll need to speak with the parents as well since he clearly got hurt." Tony turned his hardened look to the Thompson's, finding a seething Mrs. Thompson glaring right back while Flash did his best to look as small as possible. "And I don't know if it didn’t get clear to your boy or yourself, Mrs. Thompson, but it's very important to me that my students respect my academy's rules, seeing how they are what makes this school as prestigious and safe as it is. I will not have your son breaking a rule as important as 'do not intentionally harm or intimidate a buddy' a second time for whatever reason."
"I'm saying I do not want the likes of you or your offspring anywhere near my property, so feel free to find yourselves a new school, since mine clearly doesn't live up to the expectations when your son is so inclined to be as disrespectful and laid-back as he is."
” She sneered, causing Howard to shiver in place as she walked back into formation.
“That settles it then!” Tiberius jumped to his feet, turning to leave, but stopping at the last second to turn back to Obadiah with a frown, “One thing, though, why only tell me about this now? I have been asking for you to help me with Anthony for
“So, has the little thing come out of his shell yet?”
"Well, even if he did, he shouldn't have priority over mine!" She turned back to Tony, "For the absurd amount of money I give this school, the least you could do was give him another chance!"
and Tony had only smirked in response, satisfied that all was going according to plan.
Flash stiffened on his seat and shuffled nervously, but Tony didn’t bother paying him any mind. Now, Parker-
All heads in the room whipped towards the source of the voice, and Tony felt all his rage and frustration dissolve at once as his eyes locked on the sight.
backpack - and once the girl hung it on one of the colorful hooks on one of the classroom’s walls, she went for a seat across Morgan and sullenly sat down; frown never leaving her forehead.
Steve smiled at that, “That’s good to know,” and then proceeded to remove Tony’s own shirt and force him to lie down on the bed this time, “my turn.”
Steve, however, stared at the device in such a painful way that one would think the thing killed his mother. “
Steve gently laid him down on the bed again and kissed him tenderly, travelling down with his kisses through his goatee and down his throat. His kisses were small and tender, but each time Steve’s lips touched Tony’s skin it was like that little spot had been electrified in the most pleasant way possible, and as Steve found one of Tony’s nipples and sucked at it,
“Info?” Steve frowned, “About what?”
Tony felt the telltale of a headache start to nag at his head as he pinched the bridge of his nose. Great. Another parent to have a scream match. "Sure. Let him in."
“No, it kinda is. If I didn’t need you so much by my side while we do this whole ‘saving the world’ thing, maybe you could have what Clint does.” Steve’s expression was clouded once again, his jaw clenching as guilt stormed inside his eyes. “A little farm with a family and nothing but peacefulness.”
"No," the boy deflated, "daddy already told me it isn't, and that we should always try to solve things with our brains before we use our fists, but I got angry."
Tony stared at Steve in a complete loss of words. Some days he had wondered if Steve truly was the perfect man everyone idolized and he absolutely
Steve’s laughter only intensified, muffled by the pillow which he easily removed from his face and flashed a shit eating grin at Tony, “I don’t know. You are pretty spry for an old fella.” Steve tilted his head, “What’s your thing, Pilates?”
to erase it, but surprisingly, it didn’t involve any punching.
Tony had to admit; he was impressed. That was some kind of bullshit only a teenager would be able to come up with, and not a twelve year old.
Mrs. Thompson was redder than before now, and if Tony didn't know any better, he would say she was about to explode. She took her son's hand and forcefully pulled him out of the plush chair he had been sulking in. "You'll regret this. My lawyer will be hearing of this absurdity, so consider your school's pristine reputation ruined."
Tony shot him a glare, which only caused the scientist to laugh more.
” Steve released yet another pained chuckle and dropped down on the nearest chair, burying his face in his hands and practically choking out the next words, “
. What took you so long— God I hate you so much right now,
Tony? What the
“What?!” He yelped, eyes wide as saucers and focused on the King as he sat on his throne and continued to analyze the papers in front of him, “What the hell you mean by that, father?!”
