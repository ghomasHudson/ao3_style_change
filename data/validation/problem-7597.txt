“Is that you and me?” Tony asked, trying his best to keep from tearing up.
He wanted to say more, to say he’d talk to him later, see him later—anything else. But he’d already broken the rules by calling.
But when he stepped out of the elevator, all of the lights were already on. For the whole floor.
Steve’s hand came to his cheek, but Tony didn’t allow a kiss. He was too afraid he might throw up. Things had just gone from bad to worse, and now he had to spend three months knowing he was going to ruin Steve’s life when he came back, because he couldn’t wait around. He’d be a father by the time the quinjet touched down on Stark property.
Tony kissed him then and Steve let himself relax even more as it deepened. Tony hadn’t been home in almost a week.
“So can I hang up then?” Steve asked, but the silence afterward was delicate, like he regretted saying it.
Steve almost laughed, at the joke, but he didn’t. “Works for me.”
“Do you guys need any help bringing anything in?” Steve asked.
“No, no. Just…Clint said something about a mission and he was being dodgy and weird about it.”
The low noises of Steve’s despair reverberated against Tony’s chest.
Steve shook his head. “I’m leaving, Tony. I didn’t realize I wasn’t welcome.”
And not a frown of disappointment. She really was his daughter.
“Explosive drone by the door,” Blaine announced before heading over to help him.
“I got you, baby,” Tony whispered, so close to him. “I got you. I got you. Shhh, Steve, shh. It’s me, I got you.”
“Another lap then,” Tony decided, tugging Steve along. “Just to get all the jitters out. You can tell me about all of the other shit I put you through.”
He thought back to that ballroom, the dark wood. Now it reminded him more of the nightmare that Wanda has shown him: his worst fear. “You finished the room.”
He wondered what other dreams Steve had. If he was in them. If Steve ever even thought about him. He wanted to ask, he wanted to go against every suggestion Bucky had made that night, just to see. Because Steve still hadn’t spoken to him, even after his texts had stopped.
It isn’t right that Peter feels the way he does about you. I’ve tried to explain it to him so many times, but he won’t listen. I never had any idea. I guess I wasn’t around enough—I still always thought he loved you like he did when his favorite part of the week was making pancakes at your apartment.
“Mhm.” Steve closed his eyes. It was nice to feel Tony’s body heat, even if they weren’t touching. His body began to relax, as though it knew the weight of the body next to him was the one he had been waiting for. “Slept a lot worse ways,” he added after a moment, a little smile coming to his face.
“When have I ever made a—” Tony shut his mouth, turning his gaze back to his drink. Shirley Temple. A favorite of someone not currently in the country. “It wasn’t a rush decision.”
“Copy. That’s a match. Take them and go, it’s about to get hot as fuck in there. Dogs are going in,” Cueball warned, and his voice was getting tight.
That was what he told himself.
“You adopted a kid while I was gone on mission and didn’t tell me about it,” Steve countered, his voice even.  “I needed time.”
Steve waved at him with a smile.
But Steve knew it was so much more than that. It would be for him, anyway. Here was a chance to make up for what he’d done, to win Tony over. To get back where they were before all of this happened. And if it didn’t work, they’d at least part friends. Actually friends this time.
He wanted this pain forever.
“Hey, Pete.”
Tony shifted in his own sleeping bag, shivering in the nighttime chill. Steve hadn’t put up the tent because he couldn’t tell if the sand would support it, and it was too dark to build it anyway. Besides, Tony could use a night under the stars—he probably hadn’t experienced a “camping” trip since the time Steve dragged him to the Rockies while they were still married.
Oh no. God no. Tony put his head in his hands, propping his elbows on his knees. Steve had seen it. “What’s—How are you?”
He looked at Tony, swallowing hard. “Is…Is it easier to know now? That you love someone?”
“What am I looking at here?”
Rambunctious cheers came in response. He loved to hate Manhattan.
“You’d love to, huh?” Tony’s lips curled to a smirk. “That’s a strong word there, Spangles.”
But stepping outside meant he was drowned in the noises of gnashing dog teeth, the clicking of ammo clips locking into place, and the shrill cries that signaled mortar fire.
“No, Steve. Okay? No. You’re his dad. Just like me. You’re his dad.”
He wondered if Pepper had ever felt this way about him and Tony being together. She was a professional woman and she had ended her relationship with Tony on good terms, but Steve always felt like she was hurt by them. Pepper went out with a few guys, but never married.
“Looks like you got some help from the best,” Tony said with a smile.
“Why don’t you two head up to bed?” Steve nodded toward Harry.
Steve smiled a little and looked to Sam. “Hey Sam, you ever been to Spain?”
For maybe the first time ever, Tony felt a twinge of sympathy for Bucky’s big, sad eyes.
With that, he hung up the phone, slamming it down on the countertop and shattering the glass screen.
“Mr. Steve,” Morgan announced proudly. “He’s good at art.”
Bucky put a hand on his shoulder again, smiling though it didn’t reach his eyes. Bucky was still worried, and Steve didn’t blame him. He wasn’t so sure he would make it through this without cracking apart. But he would be breathing, and that was what mattered.
Steve slumped to the ground and leaned against his bed, making a quick decision to grab his pillow before burying his face into it to just cry.
“I didn’t think so many people would be interested in air and space,” Tony said with a sigh as he dumped his wallet on the penthouse countertop.
Tony nuzzled against him, his arc reactor glowing between them as a constant reminder that they both weren’t completely human.
A strange kind of relief flooded his bloodstream and Steve sharply reprimanded himself. Tony could and should sleep with whoever he wanted. It was his choice what he did with his free time, not Steve’s.
He knew he wouldn’t get a response, and he knew he wouldn’t be seeing Tony for another few hours. He doubted the man who showed up would be sober either. In fact, Tony was probably downing more drinks and pills to prepare himself for their talk. Tony was no idiot. He knew exactly what what going to happen when he walked in the door.
Tony offered a little salute, and Steve stepped into the portal, enveloped in a churning rainbow of color and light. He was weightless for only a moment, and then surrounded with roaring noise.
Now that pissed him off. “Where the hell are you, Spangles?”
It wouldn’t even cross Peter’s mind.
“I don’t buy the technology and I sure as hell don’t choose where I work,” Steve growled. “Trust me, I’m just as angry as you are. I just wasted valuable time and valuable resources rescuing a stupid little girl with a death wish.”
“I fucking told—”
Who was the reason Tony hadn’t been there to pick him up? Why hadn’t Tony at least given him the decency of a ride home?
He didn’t have that guarantee with his Tony. Not by a long shot.
. Come on.”
Steve shook his head, staring down at the sink. Why had he even washed the dishes? They weren’t ever going to set foot here again. Thank God. “I made my choice, and it’s final. Should have done it a lot sooner.”
His usual spot was empty—all of the furniture rearranged so that the place where his favorite chair used to be was utterly bare. He wasn’t welcome here.
He realized with a sad thump in his heart that he no longer loved Tony Stark. He had not loved Tony Stark for years. A decade, maybe. Tony had been the name in his head when he thought about love, but that had been because he forced himself to spark the memories of what it had felt like to love, though they had all been old and worn.
Bucky’s cry found him too late.
“Blaine, let’s go.” Steve stuffed the hard drive into his pocket, glancing once more at the woman.
He wasn’t really that bad, was he? Steve couldn’t believe that both Tony and Peter felt he needed to see someone. He was so much better than where he’d been years ago, or so he’d believed. Evidently, Tony and Peter didn’t think so.
“Sorry?”
Tony wiped his brow with a towel and sat up from the creeper before giving his son a look. “Are you breaking up with Mary Jane?”
“She doesn’t like it very much,” he whispered, terrified to wake her. He hated to hear her cry.
He finished his final set and showered off in the locker room, his mind numbingly silent. Stupid. He was so damn stupid.
Thor grinned at him, the kind of grin that oozed intoxication. Tony should know, he’d worn that grin for most of his life.
He watched Steve when Tony didn’t. He caught the little smiles, the happiness—everything Tony wasn’t paying attention to. Didn’t pay attention to.
Steve switched out his sniper for the assault rifle mounted on his back, checking his ammo and eyeing down the scope once before nodding to Blaine. With that, they headed for the control room.
“Goodnight, Tony.”
Steve didn’t slow as they approached town. Groggy tourists huddled outside the lone coffeehouse, rubbing their arms and muttering to themselves, wary of the approach of two sprinting men.
Steve frowned. “I’m sorry for intruding.”
“It wasn’t just today, Steve,” Tony said quietly. “Right now is just the right opportunity to step in and help. Let me do that. Just let me do one thing for you, Steve. One thing.”
Blaine worked his jaw, his gaze probing.
He didn’t have time for protocol, and if anything were to happen he had a very strong not-boyfriend somewhere close that could probably defend him from whatever came his way. Not that Tony Stark needed protecting, but he did like to give Steve a job.
Steve turned, offering Bucky an apologetic look. “Look, Buck, I know it’s not what you wanted, but I think it’s the right call.”
“Negative on that one, Rogers,” Cueball replied. “The trees are too thick, I can’t see anything within ten feet of the fence line.”
“We’ll take our checks, please,” Steve said with a nod.
An impossibly tiny camera flickered to life, able to capture every line of Steve’s features down to the pores of his skin when he leaned in close. The other nanobots were already aligned to provide perfect audio to their origin, and a thousand others were at the ready to replace any that fell from their host.
Tony looked up from his phone for only a moment. “Great. Now you’re crying. Always making me the bad guy, aren’t you?”
Natasha didn’t look like she believed him. “It’s not? That’s not what I’ve been reading.”
He’d read plenty of times that pupil dilation was an indicator of love, of attraction. But he also knew Steve just had bigger pupils than most people as an attribute to perfect vision, and the room was dark. But there they were, big as saucers, crowding out that pretty blue.
“Steve,” he said, a little louder.
He paused briefly to notice that he was restrained, and the memories hit him like a freight train. He actually lurched, and slumped back into the chair, breathing harder than he ever had as an asthmatic.
“Captain, drink,” Thor prompted, offering the glass.
“It’s not yours,” Tony assured him. He looked pained. “I don’t mean to sound like a supervillain here—and I’m aware I look the part with you right now—but I didn’t want it to happen this way. I was…it was going to be different.”
Blaine shot him a look before taking his hand. “It doesn’t matter. We complete the mission. Augh!” He winced, then slung his right arm around a few times the same way Bucky did after he got his arm looked at.
“Gotta keep your head up to shoot, Rogers,” Blaine murmured, nudging him with his elbow before returning fire.
“Stop touching me,” Steve grumbled.
Steve hesitated for only a second and then followed.
Steve watched for a moment as a puddle of blood began to seep into view. He caught sight of brown paws and caught a quick glance of a dog lying on its side. He would have thought it was asleep if not for the hole in its skull.
He would always love Peter. That was an unchangeable fact.  But he couldn’t allow Peter to hurt him anymore.
Tony leaned forward to investigate, watching as the wine glowed gold momentarily before fading back to a deep, blood red.  He reached out, taking the glass by the stem and bringing it to his lips.
“That wasn’t a decision,” Tony murmured. “If it were, I’d have reversed it by now.”
“I have to see what I put you through,” Tony said. “Where you’ve been living. Gotta see.”
Tony’s hand rested against his cheek and Steve turned his head to press a kiss to Tony’s wrist.
are you talking about?”
Steve’s brow creased. “Are you in danger?”
Steve set down his glass and called over a server. “A bottle of sparkling grape juice, please.”
“Jesus, Rogers, you’re starting to make me think I could be an Avenger,” Blaine chuckled, picking up his towel from the sidelines of the sparring mat to wipe off the back of his neck.
“He just reminded me why I’m here,” Steve replied.
Stark Tower gleamed above, reflecting a gorgeous skyline. Of course, it was actually Avengers Tower now, but Steve never saw it that way, especially now that they had the compound.
“You’re a real ass, you know that?” Blaine growled, but there was a smirk on his lips. “Come on.”
Breaking things off with Steve had been one of the more horrible things he’d ever done in his life, but somehow this was worse. Probably because he had no finality, no tangible end, so he could obsess about every moment, lead his mind down the well-worn paths he’d made for himself that always ended in the same place. He was on a treadmill, and he had a hard time believing it wasn’t intentional—Steve giving him a taste of his own medicine from the three months he’d been away on mission.
“I more meant he hasn’t been social with me. I check on him every night, he just doesn’t know it.”
His therapist said to welcome Jackson. That welcoming him would make it easier.
“Of your men, I heard,” Maria snapped. “I find it interesting though, that you aren’t military, yet you use Stark Industries tech and we’re currently in a U.S. military base. Are you sure you aren’t mistaken,
His therapist encouraged him to be excited. She said that in the past few months he had really grown and changed. She believed Tony and Jackson’s wedding was actually helping him.
“And you’re going to be okay until then?”
Steve heard someone coming up the stairs and thought about fleeing to the bathroom, terrified of Peter finding him in such a mess. He should have waited for the damn car to leave. He should have waited. He should have—
“A little, yeah.” Steve held the phone closer, as though it might bring Tony faster. “You okay?”
Steve sat down on the edge of the helicopter and squinted as he looked out over the too-white sand and the beautiful expanse of ocean beyond. He didn’t look away when he heard the Velcro tearing as Tony freed himself to grab a bottle of water.
“You gonna tell me what happened?”
Peter actually didn’t want to be around him anymore. Peter actually didn’t like him or want him at the wedding. At least he knew now. At least he didn’t have to wonder any longer.
“Why would I—” Tony caught himself. Steve was his boyfriend now. He cleared his throat. “Steve can make decisions for himself. I don’t call the shots for him.”
Tony’s face was burning. Steve could see the blisters forming on his cheeks where his skin was exposed. He knew he was supposed to be telling Tony something…something about someone he loved but—
People had spat on him in public. People who didn’t even know him. A woman yelled at him for five minutes on the subway for being a horrible role model for her children. Old people shook their heads at him as though it was still 1942 and getting a divorce was the equivalent of marrying Satan himself.
Tony was the same. He never seemed to age. Perfect skin, the intimate scent of that cologne he fucking loved. Tony fucking knew. Tony fucking knew he loved that cologne. And who wore cologne to the gym?
Steve was pretty sure if Peter could have found a way to change that, he would have.
“Did you want to talk about anything else or are we done?” Steve asked rather quickly.
Steve couldn’t help but let out a little smirk at that, because he remembered that moment well; Tony’s wide eyes and quick breaths, freaking out with an infant Peter in his arms.
A wave rocked the boat upward, and a few rounds of a heavy machine gun cut through the thin walls. Two men fell, one screaming. One soldier turned to help, a medic, but the rest stared straight on.
“I bet you’re proud of that, huh? Never going on a date?”
“You know he didn’t mean that,” Tony said, dropping to his knees in front of him. “You know he didn’t—“
If Thor were coming, he would have been here already. And probably halfway through the alcohol supply too.
was all Steve heard.
“I will,” Steve promised, stepping back.
He should have known then.
“Me thinking makes you drowsy?” Steve teased, kissing Tony’s hair and looping his arms around him.
Steve stood up from the bed and went over to the vanity. Despite the frown he could feel all the way down to his toes, he looked completely normal. No bags under his eyes or red-rimmed lids. No evidence to the hole-ridden mass of pulp in his chest that might have once been a heart.
Steve hoped that Jackson wasn’t upset by him being here. Jackson had sent him an invitation, but hadn’t anticipated him actually coming. He didn’t know if that was worse. It felt worse.
Steve made sure he was equipped with everything he had brought: grenades, mute charges, ammo, and that the flashlight on his MK14 assault rifle was working properly. A smile nearly came to his face when the red light inside the cabin caught on the emblem painted on the side of his rifle reading “On Your Left” underneath a white star with three stripes on either side.
More so, Steve’s presence here had reminded him how overwhelmingly alone he had been before. Raising a kid by himself seemed impossible all of a sudden. Before all of this he’d been sure. Pretty damn sure.
With a quiet sigh, Steve finally stood, sleepily rubbing his eyes. His phone buzzed again, and he saw Tony’s name flash across the screen. Of course.
“Who are you texting?” she asked with a knowing grin.
Tony paused before he left the kitchen. Steve kept his eyes trained on his bowl.
A low growl of thunder rattled the sky, and Steve lifted his gaze.
The elevator stopped at the penthouse floor—another promising sign. Tony hadn’t denied him access. That probably meant his new lover wasn’t living here yet.
Steve didn’t reply, wiping the tears from his cheeks. There weren’t too many. He had gotten much better at stifling his old habits.
Suddenly Steve was on him, his lips warm and safe and everything he hadn’t been for the past six months. Tony tasted sadness, bitter and awful and so sour it make the inside of his cheeks tingle. The lump that had formed in his throat sank into his chest cavity, a deep-seated grief that sucked life from him in a massive draw.
“Yeah?” Steve leaned against the counter, daring Tony to say it. To think a seemingly meaningless morning in the gym could be leading up to
“Moving,” Blaine said, hopping up from cover and heading toward the fallen enemies.
Steve handed over their drinks with a smile.
“I think I need you to tell me,” Bucky said gently, lowering his hand again and thumbing Steve’s shoulder.
“I know.” Steve launched himself forward, but suddenly Blaine ducked lower than expected.
Steve gave him a sour look, tipping his head back to try to stop the bleeding. His healing would have it over and done with in no time. “Spare me the lecture. I know where my center of gravity is, Blai—“
“You really do love me?” Steve asked, eyes on his lips.
“In Jersey?! You sure your food wasn’t poisoned? You ain’t carryin’ any diseases?”
Steve dug through his pocket, pulling out his metrocard. He spun on his heel, but saw no turnstiles, no kiosks, no gates.
“I don’t know how I’m gonna do this, Pete,” Steve whispered into the darkness. “But I don’t think Daddy and I can stay together. I just don’t want to hurt you, you know?”
“Uh,” Steve shrugged. “I mean, nothing happened. We took a shower, made some food, went to sleep.”
“Hey, Nik,” Steve said shakily, scratching Nikolai’s neck. “It’s okay.”
“Really what?” Steve asked.
Tony had kissed him like this before. He really was a great actor—all of his PR grooming from his childhood took center stage when it came to putting on a show in the bedroom. Tony had slept with women all over the world for various reasons. And later, he’d done the same with men. Most of them meant nothing to Tony, even his summertime flings that lasted months on end. Fuel for the gossip rags, faked for attention. But Tony didn’t like his partners to be in on the game.
Sam hugged him tight, and it drove shame right into his heart. Shame for not being able to keep up his façade of happy, normal Steve for more than five minutes. Shame for acting so strange to the friend who had helped him so much.
It happened on a Friday night in spring.  The air outside was warm, balmy, and scented with fresh rain. The dinner table was quiet save for the sound of their forks scraping against ceramic, but Steve didn’t think it was an uncomfortable silence. Peter sat beside him, sifting through his Calculus III homework while Steve looked over his AP Literature paper for grammar mistakes, misspellings, and to correct any off-tangent rambling that Peter and Tony both had a habit of going into.
“I’m good, Shellhead,” Steve replied, but he could hear the lie in his own voice.
“This is why I worry about you,” Tony murmured. “You’re all alone in this apartment when Peter’s not here. That’s not healthy, Steve. You can’t sit here with your thoughts all day. Trust me, it only makes it worse.”
Beyond the sailor, other landers had already started moving out from their ships, dotting the ocean in perfect lanes, white V’s following each one.
“It’s not for another month, Dad,” Peter said, pulling away and brushing himself off in typical teenager fashion, quickly wiping his eyes. “I’ve still got two more times here with you before I go.”
“Dad! I just got off the phone with NBC—they want to do a story on me! An hour-long segment!” Peter blurted out.
Steve looked around the crowd of men. The new ones stared at him, dumbfounded, the older ones looked at him with every emotion from nonchalance to simmering disdain.
No--what I can’t forgive is you loving me the same way I love you, but doing nothing about it because you’re afraid of what it would do to your image. All of the people who would have cared don’t actually care about you. I do. More than you’ll ever be able to comprehend while you live on this earth, trapped in your youth.
“Yeah, back when we were on the missions, not running them. You and me.”
He betrayed himself as he slid into Tony, listened to him whine and moan as he worked himself deeper, inch by inch until he was fully sheathed.
He crossed his arms, gaze wandering around the hallway of glass panels that allowed views into various meeting rooms. There were rooms for tracking new potential recruits, labs for experimentation, strategy and tactical centers—anything they could possibly need. It was important to Tony that they all felt safe here. Avengers Tower was owned by Avengers. The compound was their home base, but the hard hitters of the team still gathered here out of habit.
Something hit his reactor and Tony could hear the crackle of an electric current as his armor started falling away.
“Yes, it is.” Tony crossed over to him, grabbing a napkin from the table and wiping his lips along the way. “What’s up, Spangles?”
Tony fought to contain a laugh when Steve almost started coughing.
“Manual override. Steve Rogers.”
He readied his rifle, checking the wind another time, calculating the distance and making the adjustments to his scope. His heartbeat became louder and his finger slipped close to the trigger.
“I care about you,” Tony said quietly. “I might not be in love with you anymore, but I still care, Steve. You’re still the one who’s most important to me.”
Emory shrugged and stuffed more sandwich into his mouth.
Alive, people could stay away from him without feeling bad about it. They could be perfectly happy without the guilt, the wondering if there was anything they could have done.
“How so?”
“Have some wine, Stark!” Thor offered, holding out a glass.
He heard the click of the call disconnecting as he dabbed Morgan’s forehead. As much as she was protesting, Friday indicated that the fever looked to be going down a little. She was going to be okay. Of course, he’d known that all along, but somehow he was certain now.
Rhodey pretended not to hear him. “But look, man. Every time you guys hang out, he always says yes. The only times he says no are when there’s no possible way he can be there. I love you man, but even I’m not that free.”
“Are you gonna show Daddy your French?” Steve asked as Peter continued eating.
“It’s okay,” Steve assured him.
“Steve.”
“No, no, Steve,” Tony said with a shake of his head that Steve couldn’t see. “Just a fever. I called her doctor and they didn’t pick up. I called Bruce, told him what was happening, he just said I had to wait it out. Wait ‘til it breaks.”
, he replied, and he meant it. Tony was the mastermind behind all of this, and the less he dictated, the better. He was doing his part to be Tony’s puppet, wasn’t that enough?
“Yes,” Tony sobbed. “I’m here, I’ve got you, baby.”
“I don’t think I need to, but I can.” Steve smiled softly. He cocked nhis head just slightly. “She loves you. She’s a totally different kid than when she first walked into my class on my first day, and it’s all been because of you.”
Fine. Fucking fine.
Steve nodded as though he had to process that information. “Any reason for that name?”
“I—“ He hadn’t been aware that he had a “shrug thing.” He probably didn’t. This was just Tony trying to get under his skin or trick him or something.
His waitress walked by, only giving hurried eye contact to see if he wanted anything.
“I know,” Tony replied, lovingly scratching Steve’s sides beneath his sweatshirt.
It made Tony’s heart ache with joy, an intense relief flooding over him. Maybe he’d actually been a good father after all. At least for this one tiny thing.
Two more shots just to be sure the man was dead.
I’ve been many things over my lifetime. I’ve been an asshole, I’ve been a father, I’ve been a husband, maybe even a hero, but I’ve only had only one constant, one unchanging thing throughout it all:
“Can I know the secret now?” Steve asked into the quiet.
Ant Man stayed hidden to protect his family. Steve knew his real name was Scott, but that was all he knew. He never asked. He never even asked Iron Man, and they were close friends. Best friends, even. Especially now that Tony was losing ground there.
Of course, Tony didn’t pay attention to minute cues when he didn’t feel like he had to. “What? He hasn’t aged a day since I met him. What’d you always say, Steve? I’d end up with the platinum crown, you with the gold?”
Steve looked up almost pleadingly as Blaine stepped back toward the warm light coming from inside the bar, but said nothing.
The tingling started to fade. “It’s wearing off,” Steve murmured.
Tony leaving would make things easier, Steve knew. He would be able to go about his life without the constant, obsessive thoughts about when he would see his ex-husband again, about if he could possibly win him back, about if he could show Tony that he was moving on. He would be able to have his life back.
Low candlelight reflected in the swooping curve of an empty wine glass, dancing along the smooth surface as waitstaff walked quietly past, not one of them whispering about the table’s only patron until they were out of earshot.
But instead, he dropped down in the boat, noting how small it was.Fifty men couldn’t fit in this boat.  It was hard to stand with the waves rocking it so fiercely. There were smooth steel walls on all the sides, and a platform for the sailors to navigate them in.  The boat was square too, not designed for travelling choppy seas.
Steve hadn’t been to church in a long time. He told himself it was because he was busy, because he’d been on the run, because the last time he’d been in a church was to carry out Peggy’s coffin. In all truth, he wasn’t sure the real reason. As he sat in his pew, he wasn’t intimidated like many people were. Church had always been a touchpoint for him. A community when he had none at home. His mother had done her best to tithe, to help the other ladies of the church bake pies for the bake sales or raise money for the homeless, even when most of them were dangling on the edge of homelessness themselves.
It was a choppy speech for a choppy relationship. Steve had only been close to Peter for half of his life. His Papa. Now he was the man who lived in a fictional world in his sad little house in Maine. Or so Peter and Tony thought. The reality was far worse: he was killing and fighting and going to sleep with a taste of lead in his mouth that he couldn’t get rid of.
Rhodey froze and looked up at him.  There was silence as they stared at each other, and it went too long for the silence to be shock.
“He’s not here,” Not-Tony said after a moment, his voice soft. “I’ll explain everything, I promise. But you have to trust me when I say you need to have lunch and get some rest right now.”
Tony smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Can I have some juice?”
The lab seemed quieter when they entered this time. Or maybe more peaceful. The soft clicks and whirrs of machinery seemed to still as they moved into their now-familiar places: Steve in the medical chair and Tony in the chair beside it, methodically strapping Steve into the various restraints. Tony’s hands were warm, and it lingered even as his fingers moved away. Though Steve kept his eyes on the straps, he could see Tony out of the corner of his eye, glancing up at him every so often to make sure everything was okay.
Steve chuckled. “You caught me. I didn’t want to go in the sim today.”
“I’m bettin’ he said somethin’ fuckin’ stupid that ain’t true,” Bucky replied. “But you gotta tell me.”
“You did not.”
Tony rubbed his jaw, looking over the map. Steve and Natasha watched intently as he assessed the locations and bullet points laid out on the screen that made up the table before them.
Hell, if he had known adopting a kid would be the thing to throw him out of the spotlight, Tony would have done it ages ago. Now he was just an old dad. Soon to be a washed up old dad when the public found out Steve Rogers dumped him for lying. It wouldn’t matter that Tony had already explained the lying part from the beginning, he knew. Steve wouldn’t be understanding of this, and Tony couldn’t blame him. All he could do now was his best.
Steve took a step closer to the man where he stood against a wooden support beam. The room wasn’t finished. Leave it to Tony to only finish the part of the room people saw when they got out of the elevator.
Steve lifted a hand and gave him a thumbs-up. A weak smile found its way onto his face. He would do this, and he would survive.
“But what’s this about a plan?” Steve asked.
“Oh, you mean recognize you,” Steve said, drawing the blade over his jaw another time, just to make sure he hadn’t missed any spots.
Steve ducked past the small crowd lingering in the church lobby, and headed back toward his apartment. No one called after him.
If Tony had been startled, he didn’t show it. His gaze lingered on his phone for a few seconds longer, but he did finally lock the screen and pocket his phone.
“I’m so sorry—“
“And when I started teaching this art class to meet her, I still wasn’t convinced. She was nervous every day. But then she started saying a few words to me, and after a few weeks she was always willing to talk to me. She used your phrases, your mannerisms, and it wasn’t hard to tell all that confidence was coming from you.”
“Before I left?” Steve couldn’t hide his shock. “This was happening before I left?”
Steve had been hurt many times in his life, used even. And Tony had warned him, to be fair. But this was something else. Tony was a liar like Steve had never seen. She’d been here the whole time.
He realized Peter probably had no idea where the glasses were.
When your time here does end--like mine will soon--I do hope it’s peaceful. For as much as you’ve hurt me, you still deserve to go quietly. I hope you die  surrounded by people who love you, like I will. I’ll even have a false version of you. It won’t be enough, but it’ll be more than what I’ve had.
“I fell in love with you again before I left,” Steve admitted. “But I knew it was going to be different this time because I did this. I love the person you are now. The Tony who takes his daughter to art class and cares about her more than anything.”
Tony took the drawing and held it out to examine it. He recognized Iron Man, and but there was also a smaller Iron Man—or, Iron Morgan. She was dressed in a purple and yellow suit, complete with a mini arc reactor. They were holding hands (circles with lines sticking out) and flying through the clouds. A wobbly heart hung in the air between them.
Steve gave a weak smile. “Okay, Papa’s done. No more sad talking.”
He could finally sell his wedding ring, he realized as he picked out shapes in the ceiling patterns above.  He could erase himself from this world in all but his being, and so long as he kept up the façade when people started feeling guilty and called him to make sure he hadn’t killed himself since last time, nobody would notice or care.  If he didn’t ask, Peter would never visit again, except maybe when his first child was bring and he and Mary Jane needed a break.
“Yes, sir,” Steve agreed with a nod.
The world became obsessed with them overnight. Tony was glad Steve had agreed to stay in the tower, as his apartment complex was overrun with paparazzi within the day (no, he did not have a security drone periodically checking on Steve’s place). The owners of the complex were presumably bribed, and Steve’s neighbor called to tell him that photographers were trying to break in at one point. To which Tony was quick to respond:
Steve gazed at the blue shafts of moonlight on the tile, dimly wondering just how long they were going to live. How much of it he was going to spend with a gun in his hands, his shield abandoned in his attic long ago.
Tony gave Steve and apologetic smile before stepping in and putting his arms around Peter too. Tony didn’t close his eyes and Steve didn’t either, so they just looked at each other for a few moments from opposite sides of Peter’s head.
Steve looked over to see Tony surrounded by hologram monitors, fingers flying over a hologram keyboard as he spun out lines and lines of code. He looked to be in a focused calm, a look Steve knew well from his own Tony.
Fucking Tony. This was such a bad idea. He wasn’t trying to feel
“You aren’t mad?” Peter asked quietly.
Jackson nodded thoughtfully. “I’m sure the tourists will be fun this summer. I have a villa in Tuscany—let me tell you, it’s impossible to go anywhere without waiting in line. My assistant has to drive thirty minutes just to buy milk.”
“Sounds like a wonderful plan,” Tony hummed, clicking off his tablet. “You pick, soldier.”
Lying to Steve came so easily. It didn’t even feel like lying, and that made his stomach twist up on itself.
Wait a minute.
Instead, he had just ducked, and he had gotten a perfect view of a .50 bullet cleaving half of Blaine’s face away.
Despite all of the noise in Steve’s head, the house was quiet and peaceful, the only sounds coming from the ticking clock on the far wall.
Steve walked Peter to the door and gave his shoulder a little rub before Peter was gone, heading down to the Audi R8 waiting in the alleyway, Tony’s rock music blaring.
“So why doesn’t Steve sit in Jackson’s spot? There’s no use in him sitting back here if there’s a free chair,” Tony said.
“Don’t let Candice take him away from us,” Steve whispered, his eyes fluttering open.
Tony swallowed. “Yes. I blindsided you.”
Bucky finished screwing on the muzzle break before replying.
“Uh, sure? Why?”
Foldout beds, for people who needed to sleep on the train.
“Yeah.”
Candice laughed. “We worked on that for what, six months all together? Every Sunday; a pancake breakfast, some time at the pottery wheel, and then to the metalworking.”
Morgan let out a little whine, and he gently shushed her, smoothing her hair and pressing a few more kisses to her head.
“Where are you?” Tony asked, trying to distract himself as he continued making his child suffer.
“Hey, while we’re on the subject of waiting, want to tell me where those divorce papers are?” Tony snapped, loosening his tie.
Tony shook his head. “Nah. Then you’ll say something that’ll keep me on the right track. I don’t need that anymore. I gotta make my bad decisions.”
A man entered the bathroom and said something with a smile.
“Steve?”
Tony didn’t care about him anymore. Tony didn’t ever think about him the way he used to. Tony had erased the past five years like nothing. Easy. No pain, no discomfort—the only unbearable part of it all was Steve. Stupid, sensitive Steve. The one who couldn’t leave it be, the one who had to keep wanting closure when the answer was just no.
Bucky nodded quickly. “Good.”
The engine ticked quietly.
Steve flinched at the touch, but didn’t shove it off like he probably should have.
Well, he’d done a fucking fantastic job at preventing that. Peter had left him years ago. Long before Steve had even recognized it as leaving.
Whatever had happened to Morgan, Tony decided he didn’t want to know until he had to for now. Because without Steve around to come after him to stop him from hunting down and murdering whoever had hurt her, he would definitely hunt down and murder whoever hurt her.
“Forget it.” He waved a hand dismissively. “It’s nothing. I’m just making it out to be more than what it is.”
So he slunk back to his seat without another word and sat. Tony said something to Pepper that he couldn’t hear, and then people were taking their seats.
“Ah, yeah.” Tony gave a little shrug. “Got it down to the post office this morning. Vision is kind of helpful for that.”
“I do,” Tony said with a nod. “My only limiting factor would have been Morgan, but looks like she likes you more than I do.” He glanced back into the art room when he noticed Steve hadn’t put his glasses back on, but decided not to say anything. He wanted everyone to know he was leaving with the most handsome man at the party.
Then they went to the firing range and tested themselves until they had completed a short, mid, and long-range test with at least 95% accuracy. Steve’s shooting had always been decent, but now he rivaled Bucky in every shooting skill except sniping—where Bucky would always reign king.
“Is Steve going to be doing an interview?” Tony asked, though it felt like his tongue had swollen up in his mouth.
Steve bristled at his desk, but said nothing. If he had truly gone above and beyond, wouldn’t Tony be sober now? If he had truly been a great husband, why was his husband still more interested in drugs and alcohol than him?
Bucky pulled the radio up to his lips again and clicked it on to speak. “Okay, let ‘em run.” He stood, hoisting his rifle up with his left hand. “This is where it gets fun.”
*Tony calling Thor Turtle is a reference to your new favorite so-bad-it's-good surfing flick: North Shore
“No, Pops, don’t be sorry,” Peter said, his voice muffled by Steve’s chest.
“Sorry,” Steve said curtly. “I have to get back to my team.”
just thinks I’m only around to create a scene. I went to my ex’s wedding three years ago. Talk about a mistake. Everyone thought I was there to try to ruin the ceremony.” He shook his head slowly, his eyes glazing over a little as he thought about how low he had gotten, how miserable.
He didn’t want to risk waking Peter, so he didn’t touch or kiss him another time, though he wanted to.
Steve looked down at his hands were they had curled into the comforter. “I’m sorry.” He didn’t really know what he was apologizing for, but the words felt right.
“Friendly!” Blaine called, his voice muffled. “Over here!”
“Let’s get your coffee.”
“Like, you knew it was gonna break his heart bad.”
Tony laughed and said nothing else.
“This is Overwatch, we’ve got a silent alarm triggered in the compound,” Cueball said. “Twenty plus tangos headed in, over.”
Tony sighed. “Yes. Because if how you’re acting right now is anything like how you’re going to act when we’re out in public, we’re not gonna sell it.”
“You wanna talk?” Tony asked, tugging at the collar of Steve’s shirt. Just lightly. “Let’s find a place to talk.”
“Um, yes. Yes, take me there.”
“You’re gonna regret that,” he muttered. He threw a hand up, firing a blast that hit the wall of the building across the street. Light bathed the alley in blue, but his attacker was nowhere in sight. Fast little fucker.
Then again, maybe not. Bucky would be most at risk, and no one in their right mind—especially a Russian—would ever go after him.
When he caught sight of reddish skin, Tony made his way through the crowd yet again and tugged forcefully on Vision’s silky, gold cape.
Steve blinked in surprise, but decided not to press. He supposed it didn’t matter anyway. It wasn’t his life, and this wasn’t his Tony.
Jackson didn’t pretend to like him now. Steve didn’t mind.
Even though he’d walked way too far to get here just to immediately leave, Steve wasn’t going to complain. He wanted out of here. “Sounds great. See you soon.”
“It doesn’t have to be.” Rhodey leaned forward in his seat, looking Tony over. “But if you wanna save it, you have to tell him. You can’t let him find out on his own.”
“But if I wasn’t here—”
“Right.” Blaine filled his potato crater with gravy. The soldier beside Steve stared longingly, but only scooped himself one measly splat of potatoes.
Tony would never forget what Steve had done to him, and there wasn’t much of a way to get past that.
“What was that, all of two minutes?” Blaine laughed. “You’re too used to fighting inexperienced grunts, Rogers. The guys who know what they’re doing will knock you flat.”
Steve focused on worrying Tony’s neck as he prepped himself, then fucked into his hand when Tony started to lube him up too. As with everything in his life, Tony was efficient and quick, leaving more time for the main event.
Then he caught a gleam of metal and he swore he could have sobbed at the sight.
Steve knew better than to try to explain to people his reasoning, so he just didn’t really talk to anyone anymore. His day consisted of training and eating. Every minute outside of that was spent waiting for when he could sleep. Except when Peter came over, of course. But Peter still wasn’t used to the apartment yet.
Steve kissed the crown of Tony’s head. “Sure. I missed you.”
“I can’t believe you,” he hissed to Pepper.
The dog whined loudly, then resumed barking.
Steve decided on a bronze sculpture of a falcon made by a local artist. There was no way that Tony and Jackson would have one already, and art was always nice. Besides, he knew Tony would probably melt it down and turn it into a toilet wand the first chance he got.
The next mission was in Brazil, a quick stint with only a one night stay. Ideally.
“You still paint, right, Pops?” Peter asked.
“No.”
“You know what? My people are going to love hearing about this,” Maria snarled. “As soon as I’m out of here, you’ll wish you treated me with respect.”
A clammy sensation ran up Tony’s back. “Did you ask why?”
Tony opened his mouth to say no, but he could feel the emptiness of the space bearing down on him even with Steve here. It felt rude to leave Steve to eat here alone. “I’ll have some, sure.”
Steve tried to find the proper curse to spew, but couldn’t get any words out around the gag.
“Do you still love him?” Iron Man asked.
He watched the screen as Iron Man switched to a private channel.
“But I can’t tell you what it is, and it requires a lot of public support.”
Steve had sketched him a thousand times like this.
“It’ll be easier if you’re civil with me in private,” Steve murmured. “You don’t gotta be extra nice or anything, just don’t…do this again.”
Sam was the first one to grin, but Blaine followed close behind him.
The boat in front of them hit a mine before they could even see land. A giant burst of white water shot up from the sea as though Poseidon had decided to try his hand at lightning.  The boat went vertical, a direct hit, tossed like a child’s toy. Men were flung into the sea. Body parts landed in Steve’s boat. A man’s hand landed on the helmet of a boy in front of him, still leaking blood.
Tony turned to him. “Do you know where he is? Did he—he’s safe, right?”
But maybe, just maybe, Tony had a point.
The machine clicked again.
“No, as soon as we’re done,” Tony replied quietly.
It wasn’t fair. They hadn’t fucked in so long, Steve had
Steve could only see how happy everyone was. Of course, there was a twist in his gut that came with the sight, because he knew that something terrible had happened. His brow furrowed slightly, and he peered closer.
Steve shrugged. “There’s wet footprints on the floor.”
Peter gave him a shy smile that said he definitely hadn’t, so Steve brought him back to the table where his cereal bowl sat half full. He sat Peter in his chair, moving around him to finish washing dishes.
“Are you going to be okay?”
One of the Howling Commandoes had rigged up a roadside explosive, except the caravan that triggered it had been American. They’d been given incorrect coordinates.
Here he was, ruining Tony’s wedding day when all he had meant to do was show support for what was left of his family.
The story had turned to a series of clips and pictures about Peter’s history with Mary Jane, how they met and how long they had dated.
“Long term surveillance of a high priority target, very skilled in tracking signals. We have to be low to the ground on this one.”
His kid would get a portion of his wealth, but he planned on giving the majority to the part of his  family that needed it most. His kid would have more money than he or she could ever spend, but after he was dead and gone, he wasn’t sure how long the team would be able to stay afloat. A few decades, sure, but what about after that?
But he did remember the tourists, the way they nudged him back and forth as he stared up at the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, dwarfed and awed by the magnificent work of art from centuries ago, still there in all of its glory. Restored, of course. Every crackling piece of fresco replaced and repainted when time took her tithes.
He wasn’t so sure Howard Stark would be proud of the way things had turned out, for one thing. An adopted kid was less than ideal in his eyes, preventing the continuation of proper Stark blood. Not to mention the fact that Tony was openly attracted to men, and dating (well, used to date) his father’s favorite hero. But he doubted even Steve Rogers would have been able to turn Howard’s thinking into acceptance.
“Pops,” Peter said from the other side of the door, his voice barely above a whisper. “Papa, I’m sorry. Can I please come in?”
Steve wanted to say. Oh god, was that pathetic. “No, I don’t want a hug,” was what he actually came out of his mouth, and rather harshly at that.
But he just couldn’t take a hint.
“So we will continue to withhold from Tony what made him most happy,” Wanda murmured.
“I don’t think sleeping next to someone counts as cheating at all,” Tony said distractedly, moving toward the bed to the side where the covers were undisturbed.
to give you apple cider vinegar, but you got balsamic instead.”
She wouldn’t call at three.
“They were smart kids,” Tony hummed, eyes trailing down to Steve’s lips.
“News to me,” Tony snarled. Oh, he did not like that. Who the hell had given Bucky access to a lab?
“I think I need to get some sleep,” Steve said, but the words felt unformed as they fell out of his mouth.
After checking their weapons, they headed deeper into the forest, scanning for more patrols. Cueball was manning a UAV above that could detect enemy movement, but with the thick cover of the pines, the margin of error was higher.
“Stay awake,” Blaine said, gently slapping his cheek. “EVAC is here. Keep those pretty blues open, fucker.”
It must have showed on his face because Jackson stepped in and shook his head minutely.
But the longer he sat there, the more he came to realize that there was no joke. This was real.
“It’s okay,” Steve said in a voice that gave Tony chills. He genuinely sounded as though it really was okay. Nobody would be okay with that.  “I just wanted to know if it was true.”
Peter crossed his arms, but then his shoulders slumped.
Tony moved slowly, watching Steve’s face for any sign of hesitation. Steve didn’t offer any. He would want to hear Tony’s heartbeat too, if he’d lost his husband. So he let Tony rest his head against his chest and it was strange to feel such a familiar weight and shape. Tony even nuzzled in the way his Tony had done when they fell asleep on the couch together watching a movie.
“He’s not my father. You are.”
He peered up at the route again, and took a deep breath when he spotted the Stark Plaza stop still in its same place. Thank god. Whatever was happening here, whatever year he was in, he was at least still in New York. Tony was still here, presumably.
“No, I’m talking to him. Where is he?”
Maybe they had some hope after all.
“Fuck!” Blaine swore.
Steve kept his eyes straight ahead, not wanting to look at his son anymore. His son who thought he was talking to a man younger than him.
Tony stood abruptly, offering his hand. “Figure out how to keep it hidden. I’ll let you know once I’ve told him.”
“Cloaking,” Steve repeated, doing the same.
He had forgotten how war gave him clarity. How the smell of cleaning grease and lead bullets and the taste of blood on his tongue made him feel alive.
Steve always acted different when they were around anything related to the military, Bucky had noticed. His spine straightened out as he walked, his steps became more deliberate, and god forbid he flash a smile. Steve had never been in Special Forces. He had only ever been an infantryman. Steve didn’t know the way things worked for the best of the best, though he was one. Black ops hadn’t really existed in their war, not on the physical battlefield. The Howlers had been the closest thing to it, but they still had a list of rules to follow, an affiliation with three militaries, and someone they had to listen to.
“I’m gonna take a nap and come check on you in just a bit, okay?” He leaned down, pressing a kiss to her temple. Still warm, but he knew that would fade. If not, he had an excuse to come kick Steve’s door in when his daughter was hospitalized for a fever.
“Peter!” he tried to scream, but only the wet copper rushed from his mouth.
A blaster materialized around his hand, and nanobots flowed from the reactor under his shirt, giving him a skin-tight bulletproof vest in a matter of seconds.
So she remembered his name.
“I want to live with Dad for the summer.”
It was making him pretty angry, actually, but he was not about to be the self-centered asshole that ruined his son’s wedding.
His eyes wandered back to the part on the counter and he picked it up, rolling it in his palm.
Steve’s smiled widened. Surely Tony meant something about their relationship. Surely there was no other way to interpret that.
“Bucky still thinks something might be wrong with me. Sam doesn’t pick up the phone ‘cause he knows I’m only gonna call about you. The team feels sorry for me. ‘specially since I stopped going to things. We’re divorced. Peter’s only my son on an adoption paper that your lawyers almost had me removed from.” He had never belonged here. He had tried so hard to fit himself into this world and he had failed.
They locked eyes for only a second before the both of them quickly looked elsewhere, and Steve punched the button to call the elevator a few too many times.
“Jesus fuck, Steve,” Tony hissed. “Stop doing that ‘n fuck me!”
“Donate, I know. I did that too. I also know that nobody doesn’t bring a gift to a wedding,” Steve said. “Is something wrong, Pepper?”
“But then you had to make it all about you.  Dad was so fucking scared that you were going to kill yourself. He wouldn’t sleep for weeks because he sat up all night waiting just in case he was your last call. He was the one that needed help, not you. You cut off your marriage. You did that and blindsided him.”
“Here,” Tony said, and Steve felt the press of a cold water bottle against his arm. “Just because you’re all super soldier-y doesn’t mean you don’t get dehydrated.”
It certainly hadn’t been his plan to spend the evening sitting at Steve’s dining table talking, but that was how things ended up. It was getting easier and easier for him to soften up around Steve, and there were only a few times that his quips were less than friendly. Otherwise they just talked, though Tony made sure to steer them away from anything too meaningful. Steve never pressed.
He should have climbed back up that ladder and hid.
But right now he had to focus on his daughter. He was only just starting to learn what time of sound meant what, and that her little grin turned sly just before he took off running toward the nearest dangerous object.
“Well,” Natasha said as she stood. “I think I’m going to call it. Wake up at eight?”
With no usable intel, they had to move on. There wasn’t much of a risk for additional enemy personnel, but they had a cleanup crew en route already and they had to get the hostage checked out.
“Does it have gills?” Steve asked, trying to zoom in.
“Yes, lawyer,” Winona said, offering a plastic smile. “But I was due back at my office twenty minutes ago. I’m afraid I’ve taken up too much of your time again, Tony. I’ll be seeing you soon—now, if you’ll excuse me.”
“And I know I can’t go,” Steve said in that same chilling tone.
“Tony? No.”
“Once we’re in the house, we have six minutes to disable the security and begin extracting intel,” Steve continued. “Cueball, you’ve got that under wraps, right?”
“Tell me what’s going on so I can understand,” Steve pleaded. “I promise I’ll sleep if you just tell me.”
“Dammit, Peter, tell me what you said, right now,” Tony snapped. Everything seemed too quiet. “When you were yelling at him, what did you say?”
He leaned over, pressing a kiss to Tony’s forehead. His lips lingered there until Tony relaxed a bit more.
“Steve,” he heard Tony say, but the room started spinning a little.
“Uh, iced latte.” He used to be fancy with his drink orders, but with Tony there, he didn’t want to seem like he was trying for anything.  The smile still hadn’t left Steve’s face, and his heart still swelled with more and more affection in each passing moment.
Bucky’s eyes flicked open when he heard the sound of cupboards closing in the kitchen. He rubbed his eyes, wincing a little as one hand pressed cold to his face, then sat up with a yawn. Even something as stupid as a yawn took a ridiculous amount of mental wrestling to achieve. Weapons did not yawn.
He remembered sitting in the dark with his little boy, practicing the speech he never actually gave.
No bruises had ever colored that peachy-pink skin. No nights had ever ended with Peter getting his stomach pumped at the hospital.
Steve couldn’t say he’d done the same.
Tony’s thumb instinctively rubbed against the underside of his ring finger, still somehow unused to the lack of a wedding band. His whole life he’d been single, and he gets married for six years and all the sudden he has habits he can’t kick.
“Working on it,” Blaine snapped.
Bucky turned with a look in his eyes that was a cocktail of anger, pity, and something like hurt.
“Ready,” he called as he fluffed up Tony’s pillow. He gave Tony the most protected side of the bed, just in case. Steve had just recently proven he could take a few more bullets than most.
Steve watched as Emory’s mind went to work, calculating the consequences this might bring about. Steve had never met someone more mentally skilled than Tony until he and Emory had been placed together.
Tony looked downright wary and Jackson was clearly regretting his decision to send that invitation. They were both flushed and happy-eyed, but all of that was fading away pretty quickly now that Steve, The Problem, was standing there in front of them.
Tony let out a snort. “Too late now, Rhodes.”
Whenever he imagined Peter in his head, it was always that chubby-cheeked baby that squealed with delight whenever Steve voiced a stuffed animal.
Steve took a seat on the closed toilet, frowning as he noticed the intense trail of blood that had followed him into the room.  The soft
Vision couldn’t consider the emotional aspects, or else the argument fell apart.
Unless Tony had brought it back with him after one of his escapes from New York. Where he seemed to run off to at least once a week now, and those were only the times Steve had caught him.
Steve looked away, ashamed. “Tony…”
“Steve,” Bucky tried gently, reaching out with his metal hand to carefully rest it on his shoulder.
“Of course. I wasn’t going to miss something this important for your dad.” His voice was shaking a little, humiliation still burning in his palms from Tony’s insult.
obsessive.”
Natasha’s voice.
“Hey now, he’s an attractive guy.”
“You’re m’family,” he rasped.
“What’s this?” he asked, letting go of Steve’s hand to scoop up his daughter.
“Remember, quick and quiet,” Blaine said over the comm. “Mute charges on every door. Treat anyone inside as hostile. Boone, you’re on dog watch. Intel says there’s six dogs on the property. Four guarding the grounds, two inside. Even if we kill six, I don’t want any surprises.”
The fight became useless, so Steve finally relented to save energy and begin looking for a possible point of weakness in whatever was about to happen to him.
Vision swiped a finger along the inside of the glass and brought it to his lips.
Steve put up a hand. “That’s worse. Don’t tell me that. Don’t tell me you planned on being there and still couldn’t make it.”
“Mission first,” Steve breathed.
Steve swallowed and looked over. Tony looked disheveled from a sleep, but as always, he was still incredibly handsome. Steve was tempted to reach over and ruffle his dark hair. Except, not really. He just…that’s what he would do if…If he were in a relationship with Tony, then maybe he would ruffle his hair right now.
“Yeah, well stop.”
Even so, he was truly abandoning his family.  Just as Peter claimed he had done twenty years ago.
“It’s just stupid little crush thing,” Tony confessed, staring at his pineapple juice.
“I know that’s weird,” Tony added hurriedly. “I know. But, um—the story about my Steve? I’ve only retold it once before, and Rhodey told everyone else so I didn’t have to. And I thought it’d be easier to tell you because you’re him, but…” He licked his lips, shaking his head. “I don’t think I’ll make it through.”
“A little girl,” Tony said, looking very much afraid now. “Her name is Morgan. She’s…she’s little. A toddler. Little kid. Doesn’t talk yet—we’re working on that—but she’s my kid now. And before you say anything, this wasn’t a split second decision. I started the process before we got together but they weren’t going to let me adopt. My public image was too fucked, I guess. And with whatever happened at that party that I still don’t remember, Winona said you were my only shot. Winona’s not my friend—she was my lawyer was handling legal for getting Morgan. She’s not—nothing like what you’re thinking.”
He continued walking.
Bucky looked like he was going to explode.
“Fuck off,” Blaine groaned, still chuckling.
“Yeah,” Steve replied, but it was heavy.
His excitement started to return a little.
“And who are these guys?” Jackson chuckled, though he kept his distance from the wet fur and slobbery tongues.
“Tony, are you—”
“It’s not fucking around,” Tony growled. “I’m giving him a weekly opportunity to fix this.”
“Oh, innuendos, huh?” Tony shot back, but Natasha was already in the doorway to her bedroom.
Steve had never actually screamed at Tony before. But he’d never ever been approached by someone while his heart was still in the process of cleaving in two. He clawed at Tony with all his might, but Tony held on tight, hugging him close. Gloating in his victory, rubbing all of the salt he possibly could into this fresh wound.
Tony hung up.
“Overwatch, package is secure,” Steve murmured into his comm as they advanced onto a rooftop. “Requesting extraction, over.”
“Do I get to know now?” Steve asked, gently massaging Tony’s scalp. That always used to put him right to sleep.
Tony rubbed his face as he shuffled across the floor and Steve turned on his heel, padding into the bedroom.
“Yes, darling,” Tony replied, turning his palm. “Didn’t realize you lived in such a cozy place.”
“Tellin’ yourself that doesn’t work for very long,” Bucky said.  He squeezed a little tighter, though Steve already felt like his ribs were going to fracture. “You’re still Stevie Rogers to me. You don’t gotta pretend like you ain’t scared ‘cause I’ll see right through it.”
“Great day, huh?” someone said.
He took a deep breath, and it didn’t shudder. There was no flaw, and it didn’t help the ache. His gaze turned to the stars, but there weren’t any. Just navy clouds, a few bits of sky that punctured them in patches too disorganized to focus on.
Steve wiped his eyes after shutting the door to Peter’s room and froze when he heard the sound of a spoon clinking against a plate in the kitchen. Tony was home.
“You can just give me directions,” Tony muttered, eyeing his skinned arms.
“Yeah, yeah.” Peter looked at Steve with a grin. “See ya, Pops. Don’t forget about lunch.”
Tears didn’t come anymore when he thought about it. Those had gone away long, long ago. Back when it was raw. Back when there was what seemed like a permanent indent in his skin where that ring used to be.
“Easy, watch those needles, Steve,” Tony soothed, gently easing his arms free, uncurling Steve from his ball just as soon as he’d settled into it. “You’re safe, you’re back at the compound in the lab. Nothing—Nothing’s gonna hurt you.”
“You do not abandon mission!” Blaine shouted, glaring at him with so much fury in his eyes that Steve would have shrunk away if he were capable of doing anything but pulling a trigger.
“Hey, I’m just telling you what I’m doing to knock you on your face,” Blaine said with a shrug, smiling. “That said, if I was fighting you for the first time—even if I knew you were Cap—I wouldn’t fight like I did in there. You’d kill me in five seconds.”
“Ride’s here!” someone called and Steve turned to see an approaching hovercraft.
“The whole entire time?”
“Thor gave it to me,” Tony offered. “Put a spell on it.”
He screamed. He screamed so hard he felt his lungs rip open and felt as they began to fill with blood. Blood was seeping everywhere. His organs were splitting at the seams, blood filling crevices he knew it shouldn’t.
Tony didn’t ask if it was Jackson. The way his blood ran cold…he knew who was on the line.
“Mr. Stark has requested that you meet him on the 66th floor,” the same female voice announced. She didn’t sound like Friday.
Blaine snorted and Steve cracked a little smile before opening his arms. “Sorry,” he said. “Hey, Sam.”
Steve cocked a brow. “Huh.”
His Tony would never just lie there staring at the ceiling while any version of Steve lay there suffering beside him.
“Why not, Steve?” Bucky gave a shrug of his shoulders. “Give Sam and me your invitation and you and Blaine go back home. Don’t go torture yourself there. Not for Peter. “
Tony’s puffy-cheeked smile fell almost immediately and his brows pinned. “Hey, what’s wrong?”
A long sigh escaped him as he took another look down the beach. As though something might have changed in the twenty seconds he’d been looking elsewhere. Nothing had—the waves still seethed at the sand, a few crabs skittered along the receding water, looking for prey. Everything was so cold and solid—like stone. The sea itself was just was churning, moving rock; ancient and unforgiving. Slow and merciless.
“I just sketch, mostly. I don’t paint or anything.”
Peter still asked why Daddy’s things weren’t at his apartment.
Steve had forgotten what it was like to be the public’s plaything. A few photos of handholding with Tony and suddenly he couldn’t leave his apartment without being bombarded with paparazzi. He’d never understood tabloid press, and he definitely didn’t like them, but he understood that the photographers were just doing their jobs. It was the writers and editors that spun stories out of nothing—much like they had done in this case.
Tony let out a huff. “Well, you called me. What did you call for?”
“Tony,” Steve’s voice turned serious. “I don’t really want to fake a relationship for the sake of public image.”
“I’m gonna have to breach,” Steve said, pulling a mute charge from his pack. He stuck it to the door and nodded to Blaine before triggering the charge.
“Me too,” Tony said.
“Of course, yeah,” Tony croaked, taking a step back. “Look, Steve, I’ve got to get back—”
He dimly wondered what this pastor would say about having a fake relationship, especially one with a man.  Except he sort of had an answer for the latter, because the same pastor had smiled and waved several times when he’d visited before. Had greeted him by name after service on occasion, and had never once thrown a disapproving look his way, even if he probably saw wrong in Steve’s choices.
With a few clicks, the static in Steve’s ears went dead. He sucked in a breath, listening to the noise of his oxygen system as it wheezed in his ears, as if to remind him he was still there, still alive.
“Fine. One more go. Then food.”
“I like those glasses,” Steve said, pecking Tony on the nose. “Makes you look mysterious.”
“Is this some kind of joke? Where’s Tony?” Steve didn’t know why his body wasn’t reacting the way he was telling it to. This guy was clearly an imposter, and something seriously fucked-up was going on, but he felt locked in a haze. Shock, probably. He couldn’t muster anger or fear, just frustration.
Tony laughed, squeezing Steve’s hand. “Do they? Like maybe I’m hiding me engagement from the world?”
“Yes,” Steve laughed, giving Peter a little squeeze. “How about I duck so he can’t see my head? Like this?” He ducked and raised Peter a little higher.
“I’ll have the cleaning bots handle the hallway, sir,” Francine said. “Out of sight.”
“I just don’t want you to be sad,” Peter added quietly.
Morgan smiled, but retreated back to him, hiding behind his leg as the woman approached.
Stark Tower (briefly Avengers tower) was built for parties like this. Hundreds of guests on a dance floor, surrounded by open bars, lounge areas, and none of the trashy clublike bullshit that had taken over luxury spaces. Stark Tower parties had class, and they also had plenty of room for the VIPs to escape the noise and the clamoring of fans.
Steve turned his head, nose brushing Tony’s hair before he settled his lips to the crown of Tony’s head. He would miss this. When everything inevitably ended, he hoped that this time he could properly remember this moment and not lose the lines to feathery sketches once more.
He wanted to argue, but he wasn’t sure he could. The past month had felt like friendship to Tony, but did it really count? Did any of this count?
Steve grinned, pressing a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “Absolutely. It’s just a big step, I’m trying to get myself ready for everyone else knowing about it.”
Steve blinked hard, scrubbing those thoughts from his mind. Jesus, he was going insane.
“Yep, I’m listening,” Blaine said, but Steve could tell that he was looking away just by the sound of his voice.
“Getting a divorce.”
His other worry had been the media circus, but thankfully news of Morgan’s adoption had hit right when some politician landed in hot water with uncovered HYDRA ties. The tabloids swarmed them whenever they left the house, but it hadn’t been nearly as tough as anticipated. The world was already forgetting about Tony Stark’s new little family.
Steve started pouring glasses and remembered why he had come downstairs in the first place. “You boys need to unpack. Might as well do it tonight before you start tearing up the town.”
“Let’s have a real party, shall we? Drinks on me.”
His throat tightened, then his chest. Almost the same way it did when a gal threw him a wink, or when he was caught staring at a dame’s lips.
Tony was sitting up on his elbows, watching Steve with an unreadable expression. Not even his eyes gave him away this time.
Steve remembered lying in bed with Tony, the way the morning sun had hazed through the windows. He remembered combing his fingers through Tony’s dark hair, talking about how they would grow old together. About how Tony would grow old and Steve wouldn’t.
“We’re dark,” one of the pilots said over radio. “ETA five minutes. Ready up.”
“Steve’s floor,” he instructed.
There was no cure for Tony Stark, it seemed.
Discarded pad thai was strewn on the floor beside the bed from lunch, noodles and vegetables strewn out on the hardwood. Steve could also see the remains of a bottle of lube they’d emptied, though now he wondered if it had always been that low or if Tony had been using it with Iron Man.
“Plenty of rest in your lifetime, I know,” Not-Tony finished with a sigh. “But look. It’ll be a lot easier on you if you just sleep first. There’s a lot your body is adjusting to that you aren’t even aware of.”
The wind kicked up, lashing Steve’s face and sending his hair whipping around above his head until he had sunk to his knees in the sand behind the cover of their shelter. The rain would start soon—probably a complete downpour, all at once.
Bucky blinked and he was back on the platform, Steve hunched over the table, his face buried in the crook of an arm.
“She seemed upset,” Steve said.
“I’ve given her Motrin,” Tony explained, trying to be patient. “And I understand it’s late. But you’re a pediatric doctor, aren’t you?”
“Okay, okay, hear me out,” Tony laughed, pulling out a tablet.
Steve fought the urge to scoff. How dare Tony come in and act like Peter was some kind of nuisance. He had probably waited to come home just so he didn’t have to interact with Peter and they could just fuck.
His blood chilled. Steve looked over at Tony again, this time only focused on his expression. “A…Someone likes me?”
“I’m—Congratu—Bye, guys.” He turned and strode off as fast as he thought would be acceptable. It wasn’t fast enough though, and he cursed himself for not bringing sunglasses as his vision blurred with tears.
“Cloaking,” Blaine murmured, pressing a button on his forearm.
Quiet. The constricting kind, though Steve had no idea of the noose tightening around his neck.
Blaine looked up at him and gave a little frown. “You know something bad’s going to happen tomorrow,” he warned.
“That’s what I—wait, you’re agreeing with him?” Natasha’s eyes widened. It wasn’t often that Steve heard Natasha surprised, but he was glad to hear it now.
The tide swelled in the night, and clouds moved in. No lightning yet, but Steve could taste rain in the wind, and the air seemed to tense. A storm was on the way, which meant they would need to find cover in the wreckage. Tony was almost awake, his eyelids fluttering in an attempt to keep conscious.
Tony let go, kissing his forehead. The pain ceased. Steve sank back into the mattress.
That was the kind of bullshit that had gotten him into this mess.
“You didn’t get any coffee,” Bucky said. “What’s up, huh?”
Tony just stared at Jackson for a few moments before peering behind him at Steve, who was frozen.
“Barnes?”
“That’s right,” Blaine said in a voice that might have been an attempt to soothe him. “And you did it. Mission accomplished. Now we go home.”
“I know we haven’t seen each other, Pops, and I’m sorry about that, but this was just supposed to be my weekend with Dad and Jackson, y’know?” Yet Peter didn’t sound very apologetic. “Maybe Dad told you this, but they aren’t going on a honeymoon. We’re going on vacation, ‘cause it’s my spring break. MJ’s coming too.”
“I…” Tony trailed off, looking down at his hands. “I appreciate you…handling this as well as you did. I know I probably seem a little crazy to you, or something.”
“Peter, cool it. The food’s the same here as it is over there,” Tony said.
“Go find Mrs. Freeman and have her go with you, okay?”
He did know this woman. He knew Candice, and he knew why she was so familiar.
Tony’s face twisted to a scowl. He knew that voice. “Get the fuck out here, Barnes. What the hell are you doing?!?”
“That’s what I thought,” Steve said, almost thoughtfully.
Steve didn’t wait for a response before he stood up, heading into the belly of the ship to grab some clothes. He should have done it ages ago, but he couldn’t allow himself to leave Tony’s side when he wasn’t awake. Old habits from a war long over.
He had tried to, many times, but feared that doing so would influence Tony somehow, change things.
The low purr of his McLaren P1 greeted him as he stepped onto the side street next to the restaurant, and the butterfly doors rose to meet him.
Steve fought down the well of pride. He knew it was misguided. “He’s great at saving face.”
“I love you,” Steve reminded him.
He sat down beside Morgan and gently dabbed her face with the damp cloth. She lazily swiped at him with a pudgy hand, and turned her face away with a groan when he continued.
“Mary Jane is going on vacation with you? Does your dad know about that?” Steve asked, because being the stern parent was the only fuse within him that was functioning right now.
Steve smiled weakly. Jackson was way too nice. “Thanks, Jackson. But this is your day. I didn’t mean to cause any kind of trouble, I just wanted to be here to congratulate you both.”
“Where’d you get that, a frat party?” Tony scowled, and scowled harder when Rhodey poured more than a shot’s worth in his glass.
Peter had the same eyes as he had when he was a toddler, big and round, still edged with those thick black lashes that were ripped straight off of Tony.  Peter had always been Tony’s son, not his. And himself and Peter…well, they had certainly tried. How strange it must have been for that little dark-haired kid who had once been so excited to make pancakes to figure out that his Papa was just a stranger who was good at playing house.
Steve gave him a tight-lipped smile. “Worked with you, didn’t it?”
“I said nothing, Tony,” Steve repeated curtly.
“Should I leave?” Steve asked like a fucking idiot—always thinking he was the problem when he was in fact the opposite.
I wish we could have fixed us. God, every day I wish that. I wish I could have been better for you.
Steve looked over at Bucky’s side to see Sam, eyes wide and smile glowing. It had been over five years since they had seen each other and Sam was definitely older, but he still had his goofy grin and charismatic swagger to his step.
Their time together was spent in the evenings after he got off work at his new job: training incoming SHIELD agents. Or maybe they weren’t SHIELD now, he didn’t really care. Bucky was beginning to associate Steve with sleeping, which was becoming an issue because he really did want to talk to him. Steve hadn’t been around for three months, and now he was able to come over every day so long as he wasn’t called in for a mission.
“Four hostiles heading our way,” Steve said as four red shapes appeared in the distance.
“What, did you think her parents had just decided not to show up?” Peter snapped. “That they had work conflicts, like you?”
“Okay, well, as comforting as it is being held, it’s pretty uncomfortable. You’re too warm.”
“Sorry.”
“I couldn’t tell you,” Tony said quietly. “I could
“Is that what you want to do?” Rhodey didn’t deserve to be stuck on training duty. He loved being War Machine, and Tony wasn’t about to let one of his suits get old from misuse.
“How many bots are left?”
Blaine frowned, but didn’t say what anyone else would have:
“Night, Barnes.” The car doors descended and clicked shut. Tony glanced out the window to see if maybe he could discern some kind of meaning in Bucky’s figure, but he was already gone. So he put the car in drive and floored it for home, wondering just how he’d come to a place where he was being even remotely cordial to Bucky fucking Barnes.
Steve never let anyone draw blood from him. He didn’t donate blood either, just in case someone was going to try to inspect it later.  There were enough traces of the serum in his blood that someone (though they would have to be smarter than Tony) could potentially piece together a new serum.
Steve snorted. “It’s my personal problems. They won’t affect the team. They haven’t ever affected it before and they won’t now.”
‘They were all over each other by the end of the night,’ says a party guest.
Ben smiled, and for whatever reason, Steve found himself smiling back. He hadn’t smiled in a really long time.
“Candice,” Tony said with a smile, not moving from his spot beside Steve. “I didn’t know you were coming.”
“Tony.”
Bucky scowled at him and looked like he might be reconsidering throwing a punch. Instead, he let out a sigh. “Steve didn’t send me, if that’s what you’re wondering.”
Steve’s tensed as though someone was winding up two balls of muscle in either of his shoulders. His throat was dry. “You—No you don’t. You don’t know anything about me.”
Tony just didn’t know how the hell Steve had messed up.
Steve was calm and as close to happy as he was capable of getting. The tremors in his hands were mostly still, and there was a warmth at the base of his spine that told him he was mostly safe. Pretending he was buzzed helped things, and had even allowed him to crack up at Sam’s story of when he adopted a bulldog and the neighbor kids had trained it to skateboard without telling him. Cue a ridiculous look on Sam’s face as he retold driving into his parking spot and seeing his bulldog flying by on a board.
He told himself that was the only reason he’d suggested it.
Steve turned to see Tony making his way into the kitchen, his sunglasses resting on top of his head. Jackson was close behind.
Steve stood at the edge of the grounds of the Avengers compound, the evening air thick with humidity, sticking to his skin and lungs and that fucking heart of his. Maybe if he coated his throat in enough damp air it would alleviate that dull
“Let’s get inside. It’s getting hot.”
Steve reared back, the only thing stopping him from running inside and slamming the door was the fact that Peter had spoken to him. His mouth opened and he flicked his gaze from Tony to Peter, as though he’d just been caught stealing.
Steve waved back.
Their unit had no name. A long time ago they were called Delta, and the Navy had the SEALs (mentioning that just made all of the guys laugh—calling someone a SEAL was an insult in this group), but now they were just
He glanced around to make sure no one had heard his profanity. He had to represent Morgan here, after all. Plenty of people were staring, but these people were used to staying silent around hot gossip.
“Shut the fuck up,” Blaine shot back.
Finally, Tony looked up at him with a smile and turned the tablet around.
Steve leaned over, kissing Tony in a way he swore he could feel on his own lips. That shoulder camera should have been on already, giving him a better indication of the message behind that kiss. He’d gotten very good at reading the visual over the past few years, even if he couldn’t feel it.
“I’m not sure this is a good idea. You won’t even tell me what the reason is. That usually means it’s something I won’t like.”
Steve blinked, then remembered he’d put it in his pocket to find the address. “Oh, uh, yeah.” He propped the falcon on his knee and fished out his creased invitation, handing it over. “There you are.”
After she had a shower and a fresh change of clothes, Steve was pretty sure he recognized Maria Richards. He didn’t watch the news or read the paper anymore (well, the electronic paper), but he did get glances.  She was a stereotypical reporter in Steve’s mind, but he knew women like her were no longer the norm.  Most reporters listened to the government now, ever since a news broadcast outing a secret military operation in Ohio had ended with two major cities bombed off of the face of the planet.
They didn’t even want wedding presents. They had asked for donations to charity instead—all of which would be matched by the newlyweds.
Steve burst through the glass doors into the tower lobby, not bothering with the hideaway entrance. He darted into the elevator, punching in his access code as fast as he could manage. This had to be right—it had to be. But he would only be able to tell once he saw Tony.
Nikolai whined, rounding to be in front of him and letting out a bark.
He had purposely tried to steer clear of things he’d seen in that dimension. He talked with Tony before they ever got too annoyed with each other, and he had made it a rule never to go to bed angry..
His therapist said it was his self-isolation that had caused him to get so bad. He believed her.
What choice did he have but to agree? Steve nodded slowly. “Okay. But if you need me, just call.”
“I think I can handle it.”
Normally, Tony would assume Steve just wasn’t comfortable with potentially tumbling into bed with him. But given that they’d started this relationship waking up in bed together in Steve’s tiny apartment, and judging by the look of dread in Steve’s eyes, he had to assume that wasn’t what this was about. No one dreaded having sex with Tony Stark. Especially not Steve Rogers.
He decided he didn’t care what Steve had done, whether or not it was right. He just wanted this, forever, and he wasn’t going to argue about the past anymore. They could have a clean slate, start over with everything put behind them.
“Nothing’s wrong,” Steve lied.
“Fuck me again?” Tony asked, hands moving down Steve’s thighs now.
Nobody asked him about his family. It was the unspoken rule of the unit. If someone didn’t want to discuss his personal life, nobody made him. But everybody talked about it at some point. The only person Steve had no idea about was Blaine. Blaine was career military—that was all Steve had managed to piece together on him.
Blaine glared at him before leaning down to cut the thread with his teeth. After a painful tug on Steve’s arm, he sat up again. “If there hadn’t been that hole in the fence, I would have thought you were up there trying to get yourself hurt.”
“Was I controlling?” Tony asked suddenly, looking over at Steve. “Before, I mean. Was I controlling?”
Well, at least Rhodey wasn’t dead, though Steve wasn’t too keen on trusting him if he was going along with this.
“Your eyes,” Steve rasped.
“We okay?” Tony croaked, blinking in the light.
Steve hurriedly wiped his tears, hating himself for looking so pathetic in front of all of these people. Someone was probably tweeting a picture of it as he sat there looking like a complete idiot. The media would freak if a picture of him were to leak now. Some people thought he was dead.
And it was worth every bit of confusion and hurt to see the way Tony smiled at him.
Steve stopped chewing. “Is It government related? Something like the Accords?”
Steve’s mouth opened to speak, but no words came out. Tony’s gaze flicked down to those beautiful lips before they moved back up to that furrowed brow and those dumb glasses.
Steve adjusted his collar for the millionth time before staring down at his plate. He was never sure how to eat at fancy parties. He had never learned what fork went where, what spoon was for soup and which one was for sauces (was it even for sauces?). But everyone else at the table was eating happily, making pleased noises at the taste of the tender lamb meat.  Steve wasn’t sure if he was supposed to hold the rib in his fingers and bite off the meat, or to cut it with his fork.
Steve Rogers, I love you.
Tony was angry at himself for not having a fake boyfriend sooner. Being able to go out to dinner with someone who didn’t want to talk about business was a welcome relief. Steve made it even better by also avoiding his personal life. They went to movies and ballets and anything else date-like Tony could think of where media might be present. Everyone ate it up.
“Just meet her, Steve, before you decide anything—”
Steve closed his eyes.
Peter didn’t recognize him.
Peter shrugged. “I barely remember when they were together. But I’d say it affected me, sure.”
“Big night, huh?” Tony said, gesturing out to the line of cars in front of them.
“Maybe this is bad advice, but you’re allowed to grieve forever if you want,” Steve continued. “Hell, I still grieve for Bucky and he’s sitting right next to me. But don’t let it ruin the rest of your life, even if you think you deserve it.”
Tony shrugged the blanket around his shoulders a little tighter and headed for the track. He didn’t really care if anyone saw him wandering around in a blanket at 4AM because if anyone had a problem with it he would happily kick them out and let them find a place to stay somewhere else in—
A little smirk came to Tony’s lips. “Right. Well, that’s not exactly what you said when you were drunk off your ass last night.”
“I will, kiddo. I’ll be there so soon,” Tony said, “Lickity split.”
. Not Tony. Steve squeezed his eyes shut, trying to rile up some sort of anger through the wet wool of devastation weighing on his emotion. Tony wasn’t allowed in here. They’d discussed that. They’d fucking discussed that!
Maria pushed the door open and rushed out with Franklin right behind her. Steve hugged close to the glass as he followed, and stayed within a foot of the door as Maria rushed into the arms of her father, who had tears in his eyes. With advanced hearing, it wasn’t hard for Steve to hear their conversation.
“Everything’s peachy, Spangles,” Tony said with a smile. “Especially since I won getting here.”
“No. I’ve spent fifteen goddamn years waiting for you to change your mind,” Tony snapped. “You are always my first priority. If you want to try again, I’ll drop Jackson. I’ll hate it, but I would rather have a second chance with you—I mean that.”
Peter looked puzzled for a minute, then looked at the floor. “Yeah. Should be here any minute, actually. But I didn’t want to leave without saying sorry.”
“Because you look like you just woke up. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that look on you.” He cleared his throat. “Y’know, because you never—“
“Love it,” Tony said with a grin.
“Bullshit,” Cueball murmured.
Steve licked his lips before re-forcing his smile. Trying to look like he wasn’t on the verge of breaking down at the table and making an absolute fool of himself.
Steve scowled, anger boiling beneath his skin. “I don’t get why you even came back here. It’s embarrassing enough to live here while you’re living with other people.”
. I chose this. Tony didn’t choose this, I did. I don’t have a right to be a fucking loser about all of it and begging for attention all the time and—“
Tony sighed. “Yeah, I know. Sorry. I’m sorry.”
He wasn’t really hungry anyway. Throwing up just beforehand had kind of ruined his appetite.
“I’ll get a stretcher to carry him,” Natasha said with a nod to Steve.
“You said it took him awhile to find the courage,” Tony murmured. He shook his head. “It wasn’t about finding courage. It was about deciding whether or not he could stand to live with himself if he chose to be with the man who withheld something so awful.”
“Well look who’s up early.”
“Harry, do you want anything to drink? Peter?” Steve asked when he noticed there were no drinks on the table. “I have water, apple juice, orange juice, and some ginger ale. Oh, and cream soda.”
But damn if his heart didn’t go haywire when his phone buzzed in his pocket. He realized three things when it happened: 1) he had to change his Tony-specific vibration pattern, 2) Tony hadn’t texted him since their breakup and 3) Tony was texting him for the first time in a year.
“You don’t have to thank me,” Steve said with a sigh. “I hope you didn’t think I was just going to leave you there to die or something.”
“Steve,” Tony called again, gentler. “Come out here, please.”
The log sprayed splinters in their faces as a Russian bullet ripped into the wood, but Blaine took care of the shooter a heartbeat later.
“So you were married?” Steve asked quietly, gingerly flexing his foot.
“C’mere.” Bucky pulled him in for a hug, and Steve happily returned it, patting Bucky’s back before pulling away. He reached up to ruffle Bucky’s hair, but Bucky beat him to it with the metal arm. Steve doubted that was an accident.
He hefted Morgan into her carseat and activated the safety protocols he’d designed to keep her protected while driving in New York. She was probably the safest kid in the world when she had his tech guarding her, but Tony didn’t like to take chances in cars. Especially when his parents’ murderer was still running around cornering him in alleyways.
Steve was beginning to understand what normal divorced couples felt like.
Nobody shot at them, so they all filed in.
Steve laid back onto his bed, still breathing.
“I’m getting that vibe,” Tony chuckled. He looked concerned, but rested his head against Steve’s chest anyway. “I was worried about you.”
“Sorry, I have to go handle that,” Tony said, hurriedly excusing himself to chase after his daughter who was not supposed to be running off. She didn’t even look back as she ducked between a group of parents taking up the whole entryway talking, and Tony almost bowled someone over to get after her.
“Look, we already know your stuff is going to be the best there,” Tony assured her. “It’s just a matter of showing everyone else.”
“Are you being held hostage somewhere?” Tony joked, but it fell flat.
“Isolating? Didn’t you have a movie marathon with Wilson Tuesday?”
“Cream soda for me,” Peter said with a full mouth.
Steve gave a tiny smile. “That sounds great, Pete.”
Steve never realized how careful Tony had been with him until that carefulness had disappeared.
“What’s gonna end?”
Children began to swarm Thor again, and he showed off little electric currents between his fingers and told stories about creatures that might not even exist. Even Morgan eventually joined his little posse as Tony looked over Morgan’s other drawings. Steve explained the different class units, and how Morgan had taken charge of each of her projects. All the while, Steve held his hand, and every so often pecked his lips in the middle of conversation just to be cute. If Morgan noticed, she didn’t say anything, and she didn’t look the least bit uncomfortable either.
Oh, Tony was a talented flirt. So convincing.
The door blew open and the familiar silence rushed over them as they charged into the control room.
“Listen to me,” Steve said, firm but gentle. “I’m not going to let you leave here thinking whatever you’re thinking. Just hear me out.”
Steve wasn’t stupid.
Steve shook his head. “Just going to the bathroom. I’ll be back in a sec.”
Time began to slip away from him. Steve couldn’t really remember where he was, or even who he was. Tony spoke to him in words he couldn’t understand, and he felt lips press to his forehead as his vision went black, though he was positive his eyes were still open.  The cloth slipped from his mouth, pulled away. He couldn’t move his mouth to speak anyway.
God, he wished it would.
“Yes, baby. I love you, I love you—”
Someone had gotten Tony to change his habits. Not even Steve had been able to do that in all of their years together. Buying a piece of furniture on a date was probably one of the only times they had jointly decided to make any alterations to the main house. He was pretty sure Tony had even been adverse to Steve’s clothing moving into his dresser at first. The man did not like change in his household.
Another crack of thunder caused Peter to flinch and Steve instinctively tensed to defend him from harm.
“If I die, then I’m not okay,” Blaine grumbled. “Let’s get the hard drive.”
Defense was a fool’s game now. It was kill or be killed, every hour, every day.
Tony scowled at him. “You don’t have any coffee. A coffee machine, but no coffee.”
“Why are you here?” Peter asked, his eyes sharp.
“I just wanted to check in and make sure, y’know. That everything is okay.”
Suddenly he was flying. Weightless.
Steve shut his eyes, willing himself not cry at his desk.
The sea was black as Steve started down the chain ladder into his boat. He remembered gripping so tight to the chains that his knuckles started to bleed from when the wind and waves caused the ladder to smack against the hull. There were loud, hollow booms when the boat hit the side of the battleship. Like a low, mourning bell.
Tony still asked him out for coffee to catch up. Tony still sat beside him at press conferences. Tony still threw him a birthday party and Tony still answered on the first ring whenever Steve called.
“If I could just…listen to your heartbeat. I could—that’d mean the world to me.”
Steve should have known.
“Better,” he mumbled. “Hands, though.”
“Well, I’m sorry she’s not feeling well, but I’m going to bed. Call me if it’s not better by morning.”
Steve grabbed his beer from the table and lifted it to the night sky, to the shadows on the rooftops, to the demons lurking in every unfamiliar sound. “To good friends,” he said.
“Mm. Right.” Tony shifted, rolling over to face him.
Blaine didn’t hesitate. “Wake me up in six hours.”
Steve noticed Tony was in his pajamas too—silk pants and a loose t-shirt.
Tony snorted. “Sure you would. If you were in love with me and I was in love with you—what would we wait for? We’ve already done the living together thing. You’d move back in the second I asked.”
With that, Peter darted down the stairs in the wash of the yellow porch light of Steve’s apartment complex.
“Well, you’re definitely going to see that,” Tony said with a snort.
“I have a new project coming up,” Tony began.  “A new…chapter of sorts. Totally new territory for me.”
“Good. Just dab lightly – too much and it feels way too cold.”
“Look at you,” Tony chuckled, kissing his shoulder blade. “Already getting hard for me.”
“Jesus, Rhodey—really?”
“I’ve got heat signatures on two tangos at three o’clock,” Pearson murmured.
to make it.
Jesus, had he really been that controlling before? Tony frowned. “I mean, is it a suicide mission or something? Now you’re starting to freak me out.”
“Wait,” Rhodey headed back to the table, taking the bottle with him. “Did you skip the UN meeting last week and go to that diner with Steve on a
Watching people die had once haunted him. Now it reaffirmed that he was doing good.
Steve’s teeth weren’t half as white as his.
But this time, Tony could see real worry in Steve’s eyes. The deep kind that said he wasn’t going to like whatever came out of Steve’s mouth.
Steve nodded once, and moved to open the door.
“Want any fancy chrome or anything?”
Bucky stood there in a worn leather jacket, black cargo pants, and a grey shirt that looked as warm and comfortable as he remembered home being. The white and black sneakers on his feet screamed civilian, and Steve could only try to smile. Bucky was out of the war.
Steve turned to see Tony dressed in sweats and a loose shirt, crossing through the open-air kitchen and into the living room with him.
“I think you know.”
Bucky shook his head before patting the couch for Steve to sit. Steve did so, flicking on the TV and spooning up some broth.
“Mr. Stark is in the elevator, Captain,” Friday announced, and Steve couldn’t help hearing a little coldness in her tone.
Tony eyed him carefully then, likely looking to see if that was what Steve had suspected all along.
Blaine sat up again, his moment of high now past. “Was it worth it?”
Tony smiled. “Well. Nothing you can clear up. When I kick the bucket, I think I’ll have a lot of questions to answer.”
“Who says I don’t?” Bucky challenged, grabbing Steve’s spoon and leaning in. Chicken noodle. Typical Steve.
“Fuck, Steve, not tonight,” Tony groaned. He got out of his chair as he swallowed some of his meal and turned to face him with cheesy lips.
He stepped forward and gave Steve a peck on the lips. Simple, meaningless. Force of habit.
Steve shook his head. “I’ll look into it myself, Peter. I promise I—“
A warm hand came to his shoulder and for a second Tony wanted to shrug it off and recoil, like Steve was going to catch him having some sort of affair. But it was Jackson, so he leaned into the touch because Jackson was his husband for crying out loud.
He couldn’t get over this guy’s face. He looked almost exactly like Tony, but with these jarring blue eyes that made Steve long for the real Tony. And he’d never realized how much he loved Tony’s crow’s feet and his smile lines until he was staring at a doppelganger who didn’t have any.
Steve gave her a weak smile. “I’ll try. Now go have some fun with your friends.”
Maybe he was the one who had problems with a crowded house, not Bucky.
“It’s fine,” Steve said gently. “You didn’t have to come at all, unless you wanted to.”
Tony gave a shrug, and Steve felt his eyes start to burn when he saw wetness in Tony’s. “As good as I can be, yeah,” Tony whispered. “I’ll make it. You’re the one who gets to start all over.”
Ben would love his apartment, and Steve just knew he would love Peter.
“Shut the fuck up, Tony,” Steve hissed, relishing in the feeling of his skin burning beneath his eyes, signaling the absence of wetness there.
“Right.”
Steve didn’t even look down. “Nice to meet you.”
Steve left the bookshelf and stepped on the dead man’s hand as he passed between Emory and Kissum. He only noticed when his boot slipped on the floor, the bottom slick with blood.
But Tony had called once, a year ago.
So Blaine stayed quiet, watching as Steve pulled the tourniquet tight and lined up the needle.
Tony was out of the car in a heartbeat, leaving Peter terrified but not daring to disobey.
The desk went blank, scans and video feeds vanishing into the glass, leaving Steve staring at his reflection. It was hard for him to look tired with how long it took for him to feel fatigue, but he barely recognized the man staring back at him, all hard lines and stern features.
He had a little girl waiting at home. A little girl who would be ecstatic to see him home a half an hour early.
“Stop bothering Steve.”
He put on a cocky grin, taking Steve’s hand to lead him toward the master. Steve hesitated a moment, clearly not buying it, but he didn’t say anything as he followed Tony through the living room.
Even if some days, he loathed its very existence.
Steve cracked a smile, something dark behind it. “Good.” He leaned back a little, thankful to be away from Tony’s breath. It smelled like celery about to rot.
“The usual, sir?” the robot asked, giving Tony a nod.
Steve’s heart stopped for a moment, and he had to war with himself to keep calm. Endless scenarios played out in Steve’s mind of what Tony might be about to ask. He had a habit of bringing up very important topics in a casual way—what if he wanted them to get back together? Maybe this was the gateway to a road that ended in their happiness, renewed vows, renewed—
Soft fur, soft fur.
“You sure?” Steve asked, cocking a brow. “You seemed awfully upset with me earlier.”
When he did go to church, it was a modern one—small, full of mostly young people. There were no grandmothers clutching rosaries, no words to recite aloud, no confession.  Sometimes he wondered if his mother would have disowned him by now, if her motherly love couldn’t extend to cover the fact that her son was gay, and not a practicing Catholic (though if anyone asked, he always said he still was). He also wondered if she would be angry at him for not living with less. For not giving more, for not serving the way she had.
“—can’t believe his ex-husband is even—“
in his chest that wouldn’t go away.
Steve obviously wasn’t thinking in terms of the child he didn’t know Tony was adopting. No, instead he was thinking about
Steve’s eyes opened mid-kiss.
It was like Steve could read his mind, even…wherever he was.
And even after Bucky had forged his signature on his Christmas cards, not one of his friends had called to ask about him. Nobody even knew he was half a world away from New York, about to kill a man.
“Rogers, I swear. You keep that shit bottled up and it ends up killing you,” Blaine warned in a low tone.
And god, he wanted to see his husband again.
Tony patted his hip. “Decent. Open your eyes, though, that part’s weird.”
Blaine held it away from him, but Steve already knew what he was trying to hide.
A part of him dared to think that maybe Tony had planned this as some insane, abstract, batshit way of getting them back together again, but he knew that was a lie. Those kind of lies kept him up at night, playing old memories, old kisses, old touches that used to make him feel warm and so safe.
He took purposeful strides around to the side of the house and forced himself not to think about how life would just go on if he wasn’t there.
“Stop. Just shut up and listen to me for once before you go making this about yourself.”
“Convincing enough?” Steve hissed.
God, he missed those vacations.
“Is that who you’re with?” Steve asked. Tony had pretty much confirmed it earlier. Steve just hadn’t been coherent for long enough to even start processing.
His therapist said that he was always going to find similarities between Jackson and Tony’s relationship and his and Tony’s old relationship. Tones was a completely reasonable nickname for Tony.
“To the garage, sir?” Friday asked as the doors opened.
Steve tried his best to school himself, to not gawk or stammer or fucking fall to the floor.
“Can’t wait to see him,” Tony replied, his voice soft. “You too, babe.”
Thank God Peter was actually Tony’s son. Tony’s lawyers had lunged, sticking Candice with so many legal threats and talk of repayment for all that he and Tony had invested in her that Candice had no choice but to hand her—
“Dammit, Steve, you know that’s not what I’m talking abou—“
Steve dared to settle closer, arms crossed under his chin. This moment would end, and he knew it, but…he’d make it last as long as he could. Just to have something close to normalcy for just a moment, even though he knew it never would be the same.
Steve’s lips pressed to a hard line. “You’re smart. I’m really impressed that you connected those two—“
Tony’s lip quivered, and he passed a hand over his face. “And then you just…you looked up at me and you still had whatever I had lost. I could see it in your eyes, your face. Every part of you still loved me. You smiled all dreamy and instead of feeling the same, I got this awful feeling in my gut, like I was…the closest thing I can equate it to is what it might have felt like to cheat on you and try to live that lie.”
“Oh my god, look at those cheeks,” Tony whispered, lifting a hand to gently trace over Peter’s cheeks with a finger.
“It’s not like that.”
Vision had seen the light pulled from Tony’s eyes.
Steve swallowed hard, shoulders drawn and tense as the doors opened.
“Asking me if I’d fuck my ex husband wasn’t a personal question?”
“Francine, let Rhodey know I’m on the way,” he said with a grunt as he rolled out from under the car.
“You’re coming home?”
Tony’s hand fell over his, and Steve pretended not to notice.
Steve gently pushed him away, though he kept his hands wrapped around Tony’s shoulders.
“Gotta say, I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone my age with the name Steve.”
“Yeah?” Blaine flicked his gaze back and forth between Bucky and Steve.
Work was always a bit of a different story. It had always been that way. They had never wanted their relationship to get in the way of tactical decisions. But even Tony’s disagreements there had become softer.
Tony was a great kisser, and even better in bed. Steve didn’t deserve the punishment of not sleeping with him one last time.
He could handle this.
Now he watched as Tony and Jackson walked up the aisle arm-in-arm, abandoning the practice of one waiting at the altar. Pictures were taken all over and phones sprang up from the crowd like weeds, capturing it all.
“Absolutely,” Tony said with a nod. “She has a great time here. It’s really helped her open up.”
“I like to appreciate my birthday presents,” Steve returned with a false smile. “Do you think it’ll be done by my next birthday, or will I have to wait some more?”
“I wouldn’t bring it up to you if I hadn’t thought it through,” Peter said.
“Morgan!” a voice called from the other side of the room.
“I have our bags packed,” Steve said, back to business. “Passports are good to go in case we need them.”
“You leaving?” Tony asked as he started to step away.
“I haven’t changed my mind,” Tony said firmly. “But this isn’t extending to my personal life. This is essentially a business move.  It’s a PR stunt, nothing more. Maybe it helps our friendship, maybe it doesn’t.”
“How did you manage that?” Steve asked. “What about the Avengers? All of the things you’re always working on in the lab?”
“I don’t just fight aliens and brutes,” Steve muttered, snatching Blaine’s towel and stuffing it under his nose to stop the bleeding.
Morgan didn’t look convinced, but gave a little curtsy anyway. “Okay.”
“You know what? Stay.” Steve motioned toward the bed. “I’m not him and I never will be, but if I can give you some sort of comfort, I will.”
“Fuck if I know,” Blaine muttered. “We just get the intel and get out.” Blaine looked up at him, eyes narrowing slightly. “We don’t ask questions that don’t pertain to the success of the mission.”
Tony touched his arm and Steve flinched automatically, drawing away. This wasn’t fair.
He could see it in Steve’s eyes sometimes. The want. The pull to come back, to remember what it was like in a world where he had been completely cherished.
“For Jackson. I didn’t know he wasn’t going to be here.”
“She’s really taken to all of the instructors here,” Mrs. Freeman continued. “And the kids. She has a great time.”
“Don’t worry, Mr. Rogers. I hold the dining hall record at Northwestern. Eight full plates from the buffet line on burger night,” Harry said.
He lifted his empty glass and handed the mic back to the DJ, who started into a base drop that did little to drown out the cheering.
Her name was Morgan. Tony had considered changing it, but that made her seem a little too much like a pet. Her name was Morgan, and that was that.
“Whatever happens when you wake up, you can’t stop it. It’s going to feel real, but like a dream at the same time, you understand? You can’t stop it. It has to happen.”
“My turn to scare you,” Tony said lightly, trying to joke.
He would skip his son’s wedding and he would survive.
There was nothing quite like being home, in bed with his husband. In their bed. Steve crawled into the warm embrace of their blankets and didn’t even bother to take off his sweatshirt. Tony kicked off his shoes and slipped in beside him, fitting snug against his chest. Steve looped an arm around his husband to keep him close and gave a lazy smile when Tony tipped his head up.
Tony paused, but Steve didn’t look up to see his expression. “There’s two chairs up there. Steve, why are you sitting down here?”
Shit.
None of this was fair to poor Jackson. He was so nice, and so welcoming. Yet he was going to live the rest of his life with Tony Stark, who had offered to end it all for a chance with his ex-husband.
“You have a real problem talkin’ to us like we’re fuckin’ new guys, Blaine,” Steve muttered.
“I’ll see you tomorrow?” Steve asked from the elevator threshold.
“Where the hell do you—”
There was a beat of awkward silence as Steve stared at Mary Jane like a complete idiot. Obviously—with oh so painful of a revelation—he was clearly missing out on something very important.
Tony’s throat tightened as though Peter had just said he didn’t want to live at the penthouse. His vision swam for a minute, and his heart clenched tight enough to expel the air from his lungs. Oh no. Oh Steve.
Tony puffed up for a sharp reply, but instead he just stood there shaking.
“Recognize, yeah.”
He fished his nubby pencil from his sweatshirt pocket (he always kept one there just in case he needed to sketch) and scribbled his number down on a clean napkin. He handed the napkin to Ben, who grinned.
Anger was bubbling up in him, the cold kind that made him nervous. He didn’t hate Tony. He couldn’t hate Tony, not for this. Even if he did feel betrayed, he wasn’t yet sure if he was allowed to feel that way. And where in his past he would have charged back swinging, Steve wasn’t the same person now.
Nobody wrote anything about him anymore. Nobody ever said he had ignited an old flame or found someone else.
“What did you want—"
A holographic keyboard was projected, and Steve typed his password.
Sensationalized media had made it look like Steve was an absent, uncaring, hobo father that didn’t want to speak to them. Not that Peter had helped the situation with his stupid comments.
“And we’ll meet all your friends, see all of their stuff. Then we can go get stroopwafels.”
easy. Maybe he really had been too focused on Tony.
The fix was pretty easy, yet Tony found himself unable to play God. Extremis was the be-all-fix-all. One easy injection, a few tweaks that only one man on earth knew about so as to prevent Extremis from getting into the wrong hands (again), and he would be ticking until he either “cured” himself as he had once before, or the world exploded. Or the sun fried them. Or the undead claimed him.
“Okay, that one was more Antarctica than it was Chile, and I don’t think it’s too crazy for me to be worried about my previously frozen solid boyfriend going to one of the coldest parts of Earth.”
It felt like someone running the muzzle of a rifle across his skin.
He could feel Steve rolling his eyes. “First of all, that’s not true.”
Surely he hadn’t heard that right. Surely Tony hadn’t just asked him...
“Should we come up with—”
“Eat,” Blaine demanded, shoving the basket toward him.
“So, you were saying,” Blaine murmured, watching as Steve sucked the drug into the syringe.
“Those are all fireflies?” Peter asked curiously as Steve’s front yard twinkled with little golden lights. He stared out the window like he was a child again, not a soon-to-be sophomore in college.
They hurried forward and into the door the man had left open. Steve grabbed the body on the way in and dragged it inside before shutting the door behind him. A security system flashed above, but the flash was green. Safe.
Steve cut him off with a kiss before Tony could ruin all of this talking about the divorce. Tony was very high now—he must have popped more pills while Steve went looking for the robe. He’d been on a downswing after the shower, but now he was talking about things he shouldn’t be and didn’t seem capable of being still.
Steve cleared his throat again, looking around. “I got free tickets to the Air & Space exhibit. One of those kinda pop-up things?”
“Wanna talk?” Tony asked.
Tony closed his hand around the cool metal sphere, shutting his eyes for a moment. Steve had to notice the kind of shit Peter was pulling. Tony just wished he could do something about it, but it was Peter’s life. He had no idea what kind of demon he had sold his soul to that made things turn out like this; Peter heralding him as the world’s best dad and Steve as…something else.
They didn’t say anything to each other as Steve headed for the wreckage, but he was conscious of every breath ghosting his chest, every place where Tony’s body heat warmed his skin. He was conscious of the eyes on his face, his jaw, the quiet sound of Tony’s lips parting with words that never came out.
“It’s okay,” Tony patted him on the shoulder.
Nikolai pawed at Steve’s sweats, letting out a whine.
Steve shook his head. He couldn’t process this here in Tony’s penthouse. Where baby things were now scattered around, carefully tucked away into little corners so they didn’t tip him off. Tony was still hiding from him, still keeping things.
Tony waved.
“No,” Tony said with a shake of his head. “But we should head to bed. All of that science made me tired.”
“It’s not the same.”
“You took half a year of time,” Tony growled. “You barely spoke to me. I had no indication that you even liked me anymore. You just vanished from my life.”
It was like a conversation between two ghosts. Two people who were no longer around to defend their actions then, to defend those words. It was funny to Steve that their last messages still included the ‘I love you’s when he remembered already feeling the pull toward something less than love.  The discontent had started the moment Tony told him about the Accords, the moment he had tried to swing them as something empowering when they so obviously weren’t.
The man’s palm alone could cover the target’s face. She snuggled into his chest more and then laughed. She had a missing front tooth.
“It’s fine,” Steve said quickly, clearing his throat.
“Is he doing okay?” Tony found himself asking.
The wind had picked up, and rain spit from the sky. Not enough to get them wet, but enough to be downright annoying. The men shifted and rocked, the sea of them churning and boiling and bubbling as they neared land.
“Great to see you, buddy,” Rhodey said with about the fakest smile Steve had ever seen. “Go right on in.”
“It helps break her fever. She may not like it now, but it does help, I promise.”
Once Tony was loaded in, Natasha stepped back with a little smile. “I’m gonna go blow everything up. You two have some water and relax a minute. You both look like shit.”
Steve sat up, instinctively turning himself just slightly to protect Tony if he needed to. He felt Tony shift in the sand beside him, moving up to his elbows. Steve knew he should have probably moved to get a weapon in case their guests weren’t friendly, but he couldn’t find the will.
Emory pulled away from his scope to give him a smile. “Quadruple kill. Nice. Six hundred yards.” He lifted a hand.
It was Steve’s turn to laugh. “Thanks, Buck. I’m really tryin’ here.”
His therapist said to talk to Nikolai.
“I don’t know how to explain,” Steve said with a shake of his head. “I don’t—It’s not important. What’s important is I’m back now, and I’m not gonna let stupid fights get in the way of us ever again.”
“Can’t,” Peter said tartly, using the same voice he had when he was thirteen and didn’t want to go to the dentist. “We’re going to dinner and then having family movie night at the house.”
After a moment, Rhodey leaned back in his chair, shaking his head. “Look, I say just see what happens with Steve. Let it flow, you know? Like, I was just at an embassy dinner in Finland of all places a few months ago. Just got finished dealing with some black market radar scrambler operation in Cairo and, well, I guess they wanted War Machine to make an impression. They do that sometimes, mostly for the foreign guys…”
“It’s bleeding, Steve,” Tony shot back.
Steve’s eyes flew open, his brow creased in confusion. “What? I’m going to the wedding. I can’t just miss my son’s—“
“I hate you for what you did to Dad and me. And to Jackson. Because Jackson has to live knowing his husband doesn’t even love him all the way, but instead loves some prick who lives who knows where doing who knows what. I have no sympathy for you,” Peter cut. “And if something ever happens to me and MJ, it’s because of what you did to me. Because you set the worst possible example anyone could have dreamed of for a dad.”
Peter was scowling at him. Scowling. “It’s true. We do literally nothing. Do you know how much better I’d be as a scientist if I just stayed home with Dad all the time?”
